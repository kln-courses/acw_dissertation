<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Stasis To Freedom, In Mihail Sadoveanu's The Hatchet By NORMAN SIMMS Romanian authors are virtually unknown outside of their own country, aside from a handful of writers living in Paris or elsewhere in the West and writing in French or English. It is rare to meet a critic who recognizes Tristan Tzara, Mircea Eliade, or Eugene Ionesco as Romanian writers, at least in spirit. Efforts recently by two publishers, Twayne in New York and Peter Owen in London, to bring out a series of translations backed by UNESCO have only begun to affect the situation. Perhaps the best hope lies in a trend begun in 1972 to hold scholar ly conferences on Romanian Studies' and to place Romanian among the offerings of established Romance language departments in English-speaking un 'The main Conferences have been at Seattle, Washington (May, 1972), MLA Convention in New York (December, 1972), Kentucky (March, 1973), and Romanian Studies Conference in Auckland, New Zealand (August, 1973).</page><page sequence="2">46 The Hatchet iversities. For despite the availability of translations of Romanian poets and novelists, a fairly solid grounding in critical, biographical, and cultural scholarship seems to be a prerequisite for the proper accessus ad auctores twentieth-century readers require. In this article, I hope to provide a small part of this introduction, by es tablishing the grounds for understanding an appreciation of a short novel by one of Romania's most prolific and popular authors, Mihail Sadoveanu. Not only revered as an essayist, short-story writer and novelist, Sadoveanu was a political leader and journalist. In his own person he bridged the remarkable history of Romania from the late nineteenth-century struggle for national identity, in which a romantic intelligentsia played a major role, to the anti-fascist rebellion of the mid-twentieth century which created the socialist republic. In his eighteen volumes of collected works (1954) Sadoveanu wrote about the peasants and villagers of Romania, but he also served his country as senator in the 1930s and vice-president of the Praesidium of the newly proclaimed Romanian People's Republic in 1947. The short novel Baltagul (The Hatchet), published in 1930,2 falls midway in his long writing career, and in theme and subject matter is typical of the author. Based on the well-known folk-ballad Miorita (The Ewe Lambj,3 this novel develops deceptively into a sophisticated psychological study of the main character, Vitoria Lipan, the wife of the hero of the ballad. This re-creation of folk motifs into the material of the novel is the main forte of Romanian letters, its "classical" period of literary development coinciding with the romantic age of nostalgia for the countryside and peasant-lore; yet, the adaptation of the rural matter into the urbane genres of western Europe was carried out with in telligence, profundity, and realistic awareness of historical forces. By looking at The Hatchet from the point of view of technique — the limited perspective of Vitoria's understanding of the events around her — and of theme (the author's own relationship to the action of the novel and its implications for a theory of human freedom), I hope to establish Sadoveanu's valid place within European letters. These questions of technical and ideological freedom of will and action within the novel coincide with the discussion in Jean-Paul Sartre's essay on François Mauriac's novel La Fin de la Nuit, but develop further along lines of realism and Marxist responsibility germane to Sadoveanu's artistic integrity. Mihail Sadoveanu was born in 1880 in the small northern Moldavian market town of Pascani. At that time, Romania, as an independent political entity, had been in existence only a short while, the granting of autonomy and the unifica tion of the Danubian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia being a part of the Crimean War settlements. Intellectuals such as Mihail Eminescu, Ion 2The main sources for biblio-biographical information contained here: Constantin Ciopraga, Mihail Sadoveanu (Bucharest: Meridiane Publishing House, 1966) and the annonymous Classical and Contemporary Romanian Writers: Notes on their Life and work (Central Office of the Roma nian Publishing Houses and Bookselling, n.d.), pp. 115-117. 3The complete text of the Vasile Alecsandri version of Miorita is available in the Albatros Edition (Bucharest, 1972), with introductory notes by Prof. Zoe Dumitrescu-Buçulenga; it contains an English translation by William D.

Cargiale, were establishing Romanian as a valid literary ver nacular and looking both to the Romanticists of France, Germany, and England as well as to the story-tellers of the countryside of their own nation for in spiration.4 The completion of national unity was still a burning question, as Transylvania was not ceded to Greater Romania until 1919, and the nationalist fervor continued to seek in literature an identity different from looming Turkish, Magyar, and Slavic cultures. In the northwestern cultural centre of Ia§i, Mihail Sadoveanu became one of the leaders of this literary-nationalist movement. He wrote stories and novels about the people, edited journals promoting Romanian culture, and was appointed director of the National Theatre in Ia§i. When the winds of fascism began blowing from the west, Sadoveanu had the honour of seeing his books burnt in the public squares by Iron Guard hooligans. He moved to Bucharest, was elected to the Senate, edited two anti-fascist newspapers until they were suppressed, and managed precariously to survive the war. From 1938 to 1944 his literary output came virtually to a halt, for the first time in almost a half-century. He had written novels of ancient Dacia and of the medieval principalities, but mostly dealt with peasant life from the late eighteenth century through to the early twentieth, seeing in the people of the countryside the preservers of a distinct Romanian culture against Byzantine, Ot toman, and Bulgar overlords. These men and women suffered more, however, under the burden of their own boyars, the great landowners. The popularity of his work survived the Second World War, and at the liberation of the country on August 23, 1944 he once more began to write. His essays and articles of this period were collated in a volume called Kaleidoscope. Political and literary honours were showered on Sadoveanu after the war, but his health began to fail. A few short works of fiction and some essays were written up till the early 1950s. His seventy-fifth and eightieth birthdays were national holidays in Romania. In 1961 he died. The ballad of Miorita, as the title implies, focuses on the miraculous ability of the ewe-lamb to speak and so to warn the shepherd, whom Sadoveanu in the novel names Nechifor Lipan, that he is about to be killed by two rustics who are helping him on the seasonal "transhumance," or shifting of the flocks from mountain to plains pasturage. Lipan does not take seriously the prophesy of the animal, and so he is slain by the two herdsmen. The pathetic intensity of the folk-ballad lies in the peasant's fatalistic deter mination to meet his destiny. In the spare language of the anonymous narrative, the tale of the shepherd and the lamb exists in a world without history or social complexity: the murder is a non-motivated given in an essentially static world, and the warning of the lamb comes as a moral testing of the peasant's willingness to accept the world as it is. What rebellion against the harshness of a divinely ordained universe there is, appears only in the bitter-sweet tone of the ballad, for without understanding the interconnections of the feudal structure nor the dynamics of history the folk-poets cannot articulate a sense of human responsibility which derives from and reacts upon the events of the tale. But this is where Mihail Sadoveanu steps in to create a novel. The static situa 4For a brief summary of the situation, see N.

This journey to find the shepherd who did not return from his seasonal expedi tion not only takes her out of her ordinary round of activities and her usual at titudes of passivity and inarticulateness, but forces her to see new places in new ways, to meet with new types of people, and to verge on the creation of new kinds of thoughts. The novelist, unlike the ballad-maker, must create and describe village and town societies, observe the representatives of many classes, and evaluate the relative influences of ancient peasant culture, Christianity, traditional feudal structures, and the beginnings of modern bourgeois in dustrialism. While Sadoveanu himself is aware of the long-term implications of the changes inherent in the picture he paints of Romanian country life at a moment when the influences of the western capitalist world are just beginning to be felt, he chooses to limit the perspective of the novel to that of Vitoria Lipan. She can not, by the very nature of her rustic upbringing in mid-nineteenth-century Romania, see clearly the social forces around her: she is limited by her Christianity, her superstitions, and her village pragmatism to a few emotions and ideas. On the other hand, the author of the novel must make the readers aware of the implications and meanings in Vitoria's quest, and he must do this without violating the essentially simple language of the ballad that he chooses to echo. A wedding-procession early in Vitoria's travels becomes an emblem of hope which is answered by the funeral cortège near the end of the novel, a procession which becomes an emblem not merely of grief but of Vitoria's new awareness of deeper implications in the events around her, even though she is only able to articulate these new feelings in the old language of cult and superstition. Hence, like Eminescu, Cargiale, and Creanga before him, Sadoveanu demonstrates the Romanian intellectuals' ability to recreate folklore as the material for modern fiction. Constantin Ciopraga, the one critic to write a major study of Sadoveanu in English, remarks of Vitoria, that this illiterate peasant woman stores up and relives the century-old experience of her country people: she knows what is right and wrong, she deciphers the psy chology of men, while from the social relations she retains the essential.5 She does this by being a part of the ballad Miorita's world, and yet outside it. The world of the ballad is static, while hers is dynamic. This is seen not just in the movement from place to place, but in the awareness of alternative modes of life and in the growing sense of the human will as a factor in the determination of events. Vitoria's sense of right and wrong derives from her peasant pragmatic sense of justice, of the need to carry out bargains and to enforce the law, and from a Christian sense of retribution and mercy: but, in her quest for her hus band, Vitoria finds the representatives of the Church and of the government un willing and unable to act in the forceful way she can, with her sense of family responsibility. Where the ballad had only four characters — the Shepherd, the two murderers, and the ewe-lamb — the novel has a great number, with only the two 5Ciopraga, Sadoveanu, p. 54.</page><page sequence="5">The Hatchet 49 murderers actually carried over. Nechifor exists partly as a memory in Vitoria's mind prodding her on and partly as a real presence, as though the ballad were already known and functioning within the consciousness of the characters. Vitoria's son, Gheorghi^a, is a masculine and active force, whose personality is for the most part an agency for the mother to act through. Other characters — helpful innkeepers, their wives, and the sub-prefect Balmez — not only fill out the background of the novel, giving the events the local colour of rustic Romania; they establish the social reality of Vitoria's actions, for she grows more cunning and develops a self-consciousness in dynamic interplay with these people. Unlike Nechifor in the ballad, who operates passively against the war nings of the ewe, Vitoria wrenches herself out of passivity, when she can find no comfort in the local priest, and begins to act with and upon other people. After Vitoria comes to the village of Sahu, on the far side of the mountain where Nechifor was slain, she begins to manifest a complexity of character not evident before in her single-minded search for her husband: in conversations with Mrs Vasiliu and Mrs Torna, two innkeepers' wives, she probes feelings and organizes thoughts. As the suspected truth of Nechifor's murder starts to materialize, Vitoria probes for confirmation and begins to manipulate people around her. The original curiosity and fear for her husband become less intense as newer desires for justice and revenge force her into action. First, she dissimulates in order to set up traps, but then, in the violent outburst of Gheorghita, into physical gestures. The recovery of Nechifor's dog, Lupu, indicates the end of passivity, in that she begins to operate forcefully in the search now, not for the body of her husband, but for his murderers; she is no longer prodded on by ghostly voices in her memory, but aided by the physical presence of the dog. Formerly she had been dependent on others for information; as Mr David, the Jewish merchant advised, she pretended she was in search of a bad debt. Yet this minor deception, like her frankness in saying she was looking for her husband, was not enough to solve the riddle of Nechifor's death. The mystery unravels only when she deliberately manipulates events. To depend on the kindness of others is the same as to wait on the consolation of priests and the bureaucratic comforting of local administrators. What Vitoria realises, once the body of Nechifor has been found, is that neither Saint Anne nor the ambitious prefect are going to help: she must find the murderers herself. To find out the murderers means that Vitoria must probe behind the static event of the ballad. In Miorita the slaying of Nechifor is a given destiny he sub mits to; but in The Hatchet the murder occurs for reasons of greed which are rooted in the bleak life of the mountain people. For Vitoria Lipan to find out who killed her husband is, then, for her to become aware, to a certain degree, which I shall discuss below, of the social forces around her. Insofar as Mihail Sadoveanu makes that awareness arise from conditions Vitoria can realistically feel and understand, he demonstrates the freedom of her will and — at the same time, if we look at the restraint of the author in not burdening the character with the meanings the novel has — the freedom of man in the world, a freedom which to a great degree can be understood as Marxist freedom. The quest motif which follows Vitoria from her house to the village of Sahu is only the beginning of the discovery of freedom in the novel. The surrounding characters show only a partial aspect of this freedom, and even Vitoria never achieves more than an approximation of the kind of freedom which is at the core</page><page sequence="6">50 The Hatchet of socialist thinking in industrialised urban states. Maria Vasiliu, wife of one of the innkeepers, provokes the wives of the murderers into a state of consterna tion, hinting at their sudden wealth as evidence of the crime and spreading rumours to make them nervous. But Mrs Vasiliu's motives do not arise out of the same incipient self-consciousness as Vitoria's. She is as much concerned to hurt those upstart wives who have threatened her privileged position in village society as she is to aid her new friend Vitoria. She translates the murder into terms which have meaning for her, and acts to preserve the status quo. In a similar way, the sub-prefect Anastase Balmez, for all his suave dignity and genteel mannerisms, mixed with his puffed-up sense of his own understanding of inferior peasant mentality, is confounded by the situation, fooled by Vitoria's subtle manipulation of evidence and passions, and fails to solve the mystery because his main goal is to preserve his prestige and position. When Vitoria offers the two accused murderers — Calistrat Bogza and Ilie Cutuie — an alibi by asking where is the missing third witness of their alleged business-dealing with Nechifor on top of the mountain, Balmez considers her a fool. He had thought he understood her motives in wanting to invite the suspects to Nechifor's funeral, but when she suggests a way out of their guilt, Balmez reverts to his snobbish superiority. He does not recognize intelligence in the pea sant woman, nor the self-consciousness which is the essence of her freedom. In a conversation with Maria Vasiliu, Vitoria explains her plans, at least so far as she understands them herself and is willing to tell them to another person. Referring to sub-prefect Balmez, she says: He understands how things are, for he is neither blind nor stupid; but I have asked him to let things slide for a while. All the proof against the enemy must be clear, according to God's will, and then I would like to see him struggling, as my own husband struggled for life in the ravine. That Vitoria trusts in the superiority of the sub-prefect's understanding and in God's will are evidence of her own limitations as a peasant woman. But she does not realise that she has outstripped the government official and taken God's will into her own hands. She is not really seeking legal justice or Christian retribu tion. For, as she goes on to say to Mrs Vasiliu, If I could strike him with the hatchet with which he killed Nechifor Lipan, I would do so and feel relieved. But that cannot be ... So I want to stab him apd slash him another way, that I may rid myself of the bitterness which has for so long stifled me. Here the primitive urge for symbolic justice becomes a metaphor for her inner state. The old folk-motif of analogous punishments acts more than candle lighting, praying, or petitioning, to purge the bitterness in her soul. The failure of church and state is indicated by the fact that there can be no relief until Lupu, Nechifor's dog, rips Bogza's neck and Gheorghit,a cracks the murderer's forehead with the hatchet that killed his father. Vitoria, by her own wilfulness, created a situation, where the primitive elements in the culture rip away the in effective facade of Christianity and feudalism, but her freedom is not enough to destroy the systems nor to replace them with something better. While hinting at the need for violent action against the whole corrupt situation in Romania,</page><page sequence="7">The Hatchet 51 Vitoria's solution is merely a single episode in her life, and afterwards she and her son return to their village to carry on in the old ways as best they can. The first portion of the novel rests on the tension between Vitoria's vacillating hope of finding Nechifor alive and the knowledge the reader has, via the popular ballad, that her husband has been murdered. Vitoria's conversation with Maria Vasiliu opens up another kind of tension. This tension is between the strong probability of the two suspects, Bogza and Cutuie, being guilty and the doubtful method Vitoria seems to use to prove their guilt. In the last section of The Hatchet the range of possibilities is increased, as the complexity of social relations and motivations in the village and mountains reveal themselves through conversations and descriptions. Earlier, the possibility that Nechifor may have run off with another woman was only half-heartedly put up to Vitoria as an alternative to his having been murdered. In the later part, however, Vitoria herself complicates issues by taking seriously the story the suspects concocted of a financial deal sealed on the mountain top in which Nechifor sold the sheep to the sheep-herders and was later robbed and slain by the third man, the alleged witness to the contract. In the first part of The Hatchet Sadoveanu kept his narrative eye focused on Vitoria, rarely shifting to the perspective of other characters. Nechifor's voice, thus, seems to arise from her memory, and the fatalism of the ballad mingles with a cry for revenge: both feelings being simplistic responses to static situations. He seems at first a spectre in a dream; she consults the local priest and village-witch. Neither gives her any meaningful comfort, so she follows her instincts and sets out in search of Nechifor. At intervals in the journey the dream recurs, foreboding her husband's death but at the same time reassuring her that her quest is just and that she is correct in following the traditional trail of the shepherds. Indeed, by the time she reaches Sahu, she is convinced that the vision "was also a decision from On High, to which her heart always submitted." While for Vitoria the vision is a real ghostly messenger from her dead hus band and divine guardian, for Sadoveanu it is a mixture of memory and desire for primitive revenge. Insofar as the novelist focuses clearly on Vitoria, the weird marvels of the ballad world of folklore are understandable as misreadings by an ignorant peasant; but when the focus shifts, then Sadoveanu is open to the same kind of criticism Jean-Paul Sartre levelled against François Mauriac for his handling of point-of-view in La Fin de la Nuit.6 (Sartre argues that the marr ing of continuity of vision — the consistency of fictional perspective — violates the freedom of Mauriac's central figure Thérèse; that, for the sake of an easy profundity, Mauriac substituted his judgement of the situation, an assumed om nipotence casually arrived at, for her fragmentary understanding. Actual events within the fictional world, Sartre believes, should give rise to dramatic speeches which show the characters discovering, in the process of time, meanings related to their own situations. Sartre blames Mauriac for an impatience with time, an unwillingness to let objects and characters disclose themselves, and consequently a debilitation of the freedom which characters ought to exercise in a novel. Sar tre's freedom is, of course, an existential freedom in which individuals derive meaning through action.) Sadoveanu switches focus in The Hatchet and so 6AII citations are from the revised translation of Eugene Farca in the 1965 edition, The Hatchet (London), the original was translated anonymously for "The Book" Publishing House, Bucharest, 1955. A major selection, unfortunately omitting the main scenes of Gheorghiça's violence, appears in Jacob Steinberg, ed., Introduction to Rumanian Literature (New York, 1966), pp. 29-76.</page><page sequence="8">52 The Hatchet threatens the action of Vitoria's free will; the freedom that is involved is not an existential one. In following the free-wheeling shifts in focus that belong to the ballad, where there is no depth of character, but only a variety of perspectives (emotional vantage points, one might say) on a situation that is not dynamic, which moves through static, semi-autonomous particles, little panels of separate action, Sadoveanu risks depriving his characters of the Marxist freedom of a dynamic universe and society and of the dialectical interaction of the human will in that process through self-consciousness. The novel opens with an anecdotal summary of a Romanian folk legend on the cosmology of the world, how God distributed various characteristics among the nations of the world. Instead of establishing divine or supernatural co ordinates for the action of the narrative, such as are revealed in the ballad, the novelist's device draws the story into the mind of Vitoria. When the anecdote is finished, the narrator moves from the general folk-cosmology to the personal and, indeed, to the psychological level of the novel's action. "That was how he told the story," as a phrase, forces the mimetic level inwards, indicating that the anecdote has not been a fortuitous generalization but a keen memory initiating both the action and the characterization of the protagonist, Vitoria Lipan. In reading the opening paragraphs, then, we have actually broken into the thoughts of Vitoria as she attempts to revitalize the image of her husband in her memory. She seems, as this point, to be passive, merely accepting the fate the world gives, as Nechifor does in the ballad: "the woman had added nothing but a few words about fields of corn and smooth-flowing waters." Yet in these seemingly unob trusive additions, Sadoveanu begins to reveal an emotional intensity greater than can be contained by the static universe of the folk-ballad. Her lively imag ination points towards her ultimate emergence as the dominant character not only in the shape of the novel, but within the fictional situation that develops in Sahu. Even at the end of the first chapter, when the author draws back from the action to register a general observation, he still is careful to give the effect of be ing limited by Vitoria's own consciousness: This was how she went on, worrying and fretting, obtaining no comfort and receiving no news from the place she expected. That night, towards dawn, she had the first sign, which was like a dagger in her heart and troubled her still more. She seemed to see Nechifor Lipan on his horse, his back towards her, riding through a great flood at sunset. In the second chapter, however, there is a momentary shift of focus away from Vitoria. The change in perspective is necessary for thematic reasons, but nevertheless indicates an unresolved technical problem. Vitoria's daughter Minodora "got up thoughtfully," "[an] idea struck her," "her thoughts reflected in her bright eyes." As Minodora plays so small a part in the novel, the shift might pass by unnoticed. She represents a new attitude towards life, a modern urge to follow fashions from outside the village and to reject the traditions of peasant society. At the beginning and ending of the book, Minodora's desires to live a more liberated life stand as understated threats to the old order represented by Vitoria, whose strength seems to come from her adherence to tradition; ironically, of course, it is Vitoria's unwillingness to buckle under to the pacifying answers of church and state which indicates more fully the direc tion in which Romanian life will turn.</page><page sequence="9">The Hatchet 53 Nevertheless, while Sadoveanu does break the continuity of perspective with Minodora, he does so objectively, allowing her thoughts and feelings to disclose themselves. In general, this is the narrator's method. He views from the outside, following the vision of the character he is describing, most usually Vitoria. Thus, in chapter three, when she visits the priest, Father Däniii Milies, we are told that Father Däniii "listened attentively, nodding his approval and smiling in dulgently." The last word, "indulgently", is the author's interpretation on behalf of the viewer, just as he remarks that "Vitoria listened . . . piously." The superior understanding of the author tends to be a superiority in articulation, in finding words beyond the grasp of the characters; but in doing so, he risks in truding into the action — like a god in his creation — and so interfering with the freedom of his characters to make sense out of their own situations and to act responsibly in terms of their understanding. The ambiguity of the author's par tial omniscience raises the problem of both an ideological and a technical flaw in the novel. As Vitoria sits with the village witch, Mother Miranda, we learn from the narrator in chapter four, what is rather unlikely that Vitoria would know: "Her tiny eyes never for one single moment left Lipan's wife." Is Sadoveanu sacrificing artistic integrity for the cheap creation of mood and a superstitious atmosphere? I think we can safely say that the superstitions are part of Vitoria's own vision of reality, and that by stepping outside of Vitoria's field of perspec tive the author is indicating the effective reality such mystical feelings have for her. Still, the projection of magic into the objective world, the enhancing of physical objects with psychic and symbolic meanings, is carried out by in felicitous means. Sadoveanu abuses the privilege of the novelist to tell, rather than to work out the technical means of showing character in action. He has not solved the problem of recreating the appearance of the ballad without actually indulging in the archaic elements of the ballad's point of view. In the next chapter, Vitoria realises that she must go in search of Lipan. At first, the action is decided upon in terms of the static universe, the changeless en vironment of the Romanian villages, where "everything was as in the days of Burbista, the prince of long ago." The sense that he might be dead, rouses in Vitoria a feeling "that her love was the same as in her youth." She seems to par ticipate in one of those cyclical rebirths characteristic of European folk-lore, and yet she is aware of the irreversability of time in the aging of her own body. As Mircea Eliade, the noted Romanian historian of religion and mythologist, has pointed out, one of the key elements in western religious thought is the "myth of the eternal return," the desire to obliterate history through ritual returns to the beginning of time, "once upon a time" or "long, long ago." The seasonal calen dar of the shepherds' transhumance, like the liturgical calendar of the Roma nian Orthodox Church, seems to offer a way out of the burden of history, and to free the individual from the guilt of living and dying. But the novel shows a far more complex situation. Vitoria feels her old love revived and sets out to dis cover Nechifor. By doing this, she transcends the ritual pattern, and in the duplicity and wit involved in tracking down the murderers she shows that humans act upon history and transform it. While she is finally limited by her own superstitions, she does illustrate a far greater degree of human freedom than either the church or state are willing to recognise. Her quest is ostensibly for mental relief from the anguish of unsatisfied vengeance, but it is also — in the implicit language of the novel's structure — an engagement with the world.</page><page sequence="10">54 The Hatchet In Marxist terms, Vitoria's travels are forays towards a new definition of man as a creative force in world-history. After attemping to find some answers among the monks, in chapter six, Vitoria visits the authorities of the state, the monarchy which she visualises in fairy-tale terms. Two interesting things happen during her interview with the prefect at Piatra. First, she realises that she has aroused a kind of sexual interest in the gentleman: "She was no longer young but there was an uncommon beauty in her eyes." This awareness confirms for her the revitalisation of youth which the renewed intensity of love for Nechifor had made her feel, the inner strength of character which releases from the passivity of peasant morality a dynamism she can only understand as obedience to her husband's memory. The other thing that happens is that the prefect articulates an obvious solution to Nechifor's long absence: "thieves have robbed and killed him." But while the icons she prayed to knew and were silent, the authorities of the king know and ask for petitions. In a last attempt to act according to time-honoured (and state authorised) tradition, she prays to heaven, asks Father Däniii to write out her petition, but — indicating a break from strict obedience — she says to herself, I'll settle everything here and go to Dorna myself. I have taken a decision in my heart; I have been prompted. Again, this decision does not have the sufficiently objective terminology to grant her the mature self-consciousness which true freedom depends on. "There will be no rest for me," she continues, "just as the rivulet Tarcau has no rest, until I have found Nechifor Lipan." The freedom she seeks is that of the old rituals, the synchronization of human activity to the felt-illusion of natural cycles. Nature is understandable only in anthropomorphic terms that imply a human passivity, a control over the environment that does not seek to change it, but to tame it through the medium of a supernatural realm of undifferentiated psychic projec tions. Throughout the adventures on the road to Sahu, the novelist maintains a basic focus on Vitoria with slight shifts to other characters, and so attempts to hint at the social dynamism of the world she travels through. He attempts to give both the static world of the ballad and a novelistic commentary on it a kind of sophisticated gloss on the old narrative. In the latter part of the novel, when Vitoria has reached Sahu and begins to unravel the mystery of Nechifor's murder, the novelistic shifts become more frequent and complicated. The situa tion now includes the interplay of Vitoria acting upon the personalities of other people, and not merely that of characters passively prodded into action from outside of themselves. In his shifts to the sub-prefect, to GheorghiÇa and to Bogza, Sadoveanu does more than fill out the scene and reveal clues in a murder mystery. He is less intrusive than before, allowing characters a greater freedom by not interpreting their thoughts in such impressionistic terms as "intently," "piously" and "indulgently," which he used earlier. The characters are now not motivated by voice or a dream but through their social relations in response to the realities of the physical world around them. The justice that Vitoria seeks and obtains, however, is bloody and primitive, a ritual blood-letting to satisfy the anxiety in her soul. She is alienated from objective reality: she still sees the world in superstitious terms, where evil merely is and God dispenses justice from</page><page sequence="11">The Hatchet 55 a sacramental otherworld. As D. I. Suchianu points out, "She is a steadfast pea sant woman, believing in God's justice and in man's duty to fulfil her destiny, to carry it to the end."7 These are acceptable traits within the old order, but "there is her cunning . . . concealed behind a feigned artlessness," which while also recognizable as characteristic of the peasant nonetheless indicates a freedom un accounted for in rituals of folk, church, or state. When Sartre faults Mauriac for denying his characters freedom, by intruding into the novel with easy interpretations of their actions and distorting generalizations, he is concerned with existential freedom. Man "is completely excluded from reality, nothing conditions or determines him."8 Everything in the world consequently becomes meaningless except man's ability to say yes or no to his existence; and in this absurdity, the only defining, meaning-giving fac tor lies in the struggle to overcome his indifference, and to say yes. In the ballad, Mioritfl, the ewe lamb calls on Nechifor to say yes to life, and so to avoid the im pending murder. But the shepherd says nothing and is killed. In the novel, his wife feels called on to revenge his murder. She is asked, whether by prefect, witch, or priest, to let others act; but she chooses to go out into the world and find her husband, and then his murderers. Yet she does not merely act for the sake of acting: her blind faith in God and in the divinely or dained function of the visionary figure of her husband make her act purposeful ly. The absurdity lies not so much in her ignorance, however, for that is nothing she can control, given the time and place of her life: but rather in the situation. In other words, Vitoria is not absurd: and she is not indifferent. Her involvement appears everywhere, and yet the social conditions around her fail to respond properly to her search for justice and relief from anguish. Vitoria's own will shapes the final scene of the novel. She organizes the funeral procession, using the traditional pattern of the church's rites and the villagers' own ceremonial customs; and she manipulates the events afterwards, in order to bring out the proper confessions from the two murderers. In Sahu and the other small villages, she talks with innkeepers and their wives, finding out facts from them, many of which they are not aware of. In this Vitoria, who began hesitantly and unclearly, unsure of herself outside the comforting sur roundings of her own village and her own set-pattern of life as a wife, now begins to act forthrightly on her own behalf and accomplishes what others could not. But having accomplished her final goal, the killing of her husband's murderers, she lapses into the old passivity; she becomes alive "to the many cares incum bent upon her." She wishes not only to return home and "resume the work we've interrupted," but also to prevent her daughter Minodora from marrying "that lanky big-nosed son of the chanter Topor's wife": that is, to continue the old way of life, fighting against the new, locked in the rituals of the past. The ambiguous proverb of Nechifor Lipan can thus be explained. "Nobody," he would say, "can overleap his own shadow." That means that people are con ditioned by the time and place they live in, and while they can exercise a great deal more freedom of will than is traditionally explained, they cannot be ex pected to think in terms completely at odds with what they are born to and what is confirmed in the ritualistic patterns of their society.
