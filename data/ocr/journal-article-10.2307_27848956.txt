<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. Evelyn Hutchinson Zoological Iconography in the West after A.D. 1200 From crude beginnings early in the thirteenth century, the descriptive and decorative aspects of animal illustration have been gradually woven together to produce works that are both accurate and beautiful In an attempt to look at animal ico nography from a zoological point of view we immediately encounter a peculiarly significant pitfall. Any thing that has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and many organisms merely with obvious anterior ends bearing sensory apparatus, can provide an image into which human character can be projected. In Cami's amusing illustration which forms the tailpiece of this paper, the giant tortoise tells us more about someone, no doubt called Freddie, who has failed to get into a Wodehouse novel, than it does about the chelonian inhabitants of Aldabra Island or the Gal?pagos Ar chipelago. The reader may enjoy all the other characters in this picture in comparable ways. Most animals de picted by distinguished modern art ists are in a sense zoomorphic Ror schach blots, often of great elegance, acting as vehicles for human feelings rather than expressing objective zoological facts. This is in keeping with the contemporary artistic ten dency to be primarily concerned with what is happening in the mind of the painter rather than with what is supposed to exist in the external G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Sterling Professor of Zoology Emeritus, Yale University, is well known to American Scientist readers for his occasional articles on a wide diversity of top ics. Dr. Hutchinson is grateful to the World Wildlife Fund for the invitation to give the lecture on which this article is based. Marjorie G. Wynne and Christina Hanson, in the Beinecke Library at Yale, and Susan Casteras, in Yale's British Art Center, gave immense help with individual works of art in their institutions.

Initially, I want to avoid, as far as possible, subjective interests and interpretations, though they will make an appropriate entrance late in my story. There was, of course, much zoological representation in antiquity, often combining accuracy and beauty in ways that had to be rediscovered in the Middle Ages (1 ). I shall, however, not treat of this, though I am aware of the possible influences of some late classical and Byzantine art on the subsequent Western European im agery with which I am primarily concerned. The subject of animal iconography is too large to consider as a whole in a single article, and in limiting my field, I naturally con centrate on the area that I know best. There are, I think, two main reasons for wanting to make pictures that give objective information about animals, or anything else, in the external world. One is to provide a description, in the most economical though not the easiest way, of the object in view. This we see in a child's reading book, where a picture of a cat gives a famil iar meaning to CAT, or in an illus trated dictionary or encyclopedia where the illustration may or may not call the reader to mind of something known, or in a scientific paper de scribing a new animal, where the in formative picture is of something that the reader is believed never yet to have seen. The picture in all these cases tells what the text is about. This is very useful, particularly when the artist is in the know. In a manuscript of about 1200, the Moralitates de auibus of Hugo Car dinal Folietinus, there are a series of pictures of birds that are clearly in tended to illustrate the text (Fig. 1). The painter, working in England, made a picture of a swallow of little elegance but just sufficient accuracy to indicate what the word hirundo meant. When he tried to do the same thing for struthio he failed, as no os trich was available in the English countryside as model. Using a model at all was a considerable advance, if one was trying to be informative rather than decorative, over most early medieval works. Half a century later a great number of descriptive pictures of birds appear in the Vatican copy of Frederick II of Hohenstauffen's celebrated work on falconry, De arte venandi cum avi 1978 November-December 675</page><page sequence="2">munenem? antma mcaturtJat&amp;cfhiaUOT meufqitcrjuo, Lr?fft-tnmo:ref|iumcmotftr nu lairmtiaui?c?fttrbmir? tm#cmrmmcouuatot*r ftn^iiastwct imitmntatmtam ^tommmmmngat? ?draftiujacoaiUBmatdt lomttc?iuimtco?mfl)9? untata mme mam \w Figure 2. This page (f. 55b) of the Grey Fitzpayn Hours, an English work of the first decade of the 14th century, shows an extraor dinary mixture of religious feeling, family pride, delight in natural beauty, and unres trained sauciness, highly characteristic of later medieval decoration. (MS 242; courtesy of Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England.) bus, each bird being accompanied by a descriptive label. Most of the birds are recognizable; the artist, perhaps copying lost originals by Frederick himself, concentrated on diagnostic characters somewhat at the expense of the inherent beauty of the bird. A great deal of the inspiration of these pictures must have come from a de light, partly scientific, partly aesthe tic, in the diversity of nature. There may also have been influences from antiquity through lost, presumably secular, late Byzantine mosaics that are, for example, known to have de corated the palace at Palermo. As well as descriptive realism there is a second motive behind accurate depiction of birds, plants, and other living beings, namely to bring in from the outer world and perpetuate on the page the visible if fleeting beauty of nature. This aesthetic realism de velops strikingly during the thir teenth century, and is exemplified by some of the decoration in two illumi nated manuscripts of particular in terest (2). One of these is the copy of the Histo ria scholastica of Petrus Comestor (B.M. Roy 3 D VI) presented by Ed mund Earl of Cornwall to Ashridge College, which he founded in 1283. On f. 234 the elaborate border bears the Cornwall Arms that he inherited from his father Richard, but also the arms of the King of Rome, an elective office which Richard had occupied earlier in the century. On several pages of the book birds are depicted, notably a blue tit (Parus caeruleus) on f. 116, a chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) on f. 104b, and a jay (Garrulus glandarius) on f. 234, with more accuracy and grace than anything done in north western Europe before 1283, the ear liest possible date for the book. It is particularly interesting that Richard Earl of Cornwall and King of Rome had been a great friend of Frederick II and had stayed with him in Paler mo about the time that the De arte venandi cum avibus was being fin ished. The second group of memorable il luminations in this tradition, the decorations on the early pages (ff. ll-18b) of the Alphonso Psalter (B.M. Add. 24686), was started for the wedding of Alphonso, son of Ed ward I of England and Margaret of Holland, whose betrothal was an nounced in August 1284. Alphonso died shortly after the announcement and the Psalter was laid aside, to be continued later, but in a very modest and unzoological style, for his sister Elizabeth. A number of birds and a beautiful green lizard {Lacerta viri dis) are included in the decorations; the lizard, not being British, may suggest a French or at least a Norman artist. On the first page of the Psalms, there is a splendid herring gull (Larus argentatus) at the bottom, between the coats of arms of the intended bride and groom. Around the border of the page are a wood pigeon (Co lumba palumbus), cock and hen bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), perhaps a spotted flycatcher (Mus cicapa striata), a goldfinch (Car duelis carduelis), a song thrush (Turdus philomelos), a green wood pecker (Picus viridis), a kingfisher 676 American Scientist, Volume 66</page><page sequence="3">(Alcedo arthis), and a crane (Grus grus). On later pages a blackbird (Turdus merula) on f. 12 and a raven (Corvus corax) on f. 18 are depicted as small incidental features of the decoration, but are of particular importance, the blackbird having a sleek contour and yellow on the bill and around the eye, while the raven has shaggy facial feathers and is wholly dark. This at tention to details of taxonomic sig nificance is most interesting. Though the painter put too many eggs in his pigeon's nest, he had a sense of life history, which comes out in a very curious way. He depicts a mermaid suckling her daughter: the mother has a bronze-colored fishtail, while the daughter, though with nicely devel oped breasts, has a pale golden fish tail, indicating a reasonable ontogeny for a mythological being. The mixture of accurate and mythological natural history in the book emphasizes that nature is here primarily interesting as a source of beautiful images. Since there is strong evidence of Do minican influence on the Alphonso Psalter, presumably through the royal confessor who was always a Dominican at this time, it is conceiv able that some memory of Albertus Magnus and of his writings on natural history influenced the decoration of the book. Both the works of the 1280s that we have considered thus may have links with the only really im portant contributions to ornithology made in the West in the thirteenth century, though in both illuminated manuscripts the interest is clearly primarily aesthetic rather than sci entific. The attitude apparent in these thir teenth-century decorations continued throughout the Middle Ages. In the fourteenth century birds continued to be of major decorative importance, reaching a high point about 1340 in the Hours of Bonne of Luxembourg, now in the Cloisters in New York. Vaurie (3) identified about forty species in this work, which is however still inadequately described and il lustrated. Animals as symbols?

Commonly regarded as one of the first feminist books, Le livre des trois virtus was written in the middle of the 15th century by Christine de Pisan, a French poet of Italian descent. Shown here is f. 16b from an elabo rately illuminated copy of the work. The use as decorative motifs of birds, such as the popinjay, the green parrot (or male Psittacula krameri), the bullfinch, and the chaffinch, or of insects, like the rather battered green grasshopper and the very inaccurate swallowtail butterfly, is characteristic of illuminations of this period. The other extravagantly decorated pages of this manuscript also have motifs from natural history. (MS 427; courtesy of Beinecke Li brary.) notably the pelican, associated with the Crucifixion, certainly had sym bolic connotations. The goldfinch, which appears in a majority of illu minated manuscripts in which birds are depicted, is associated with the infant Christ and also with the Re surrection. In the latter context the bird was often liberated at the time of the appearance of the figure of the risen Christ in Easter celebrations in Sicily and southern Italy. To a lesser degree, through the bestiaries and other writings, moral and religious attitudes were given to some other species. A page, however, such as f. 55b of the Grey-Fitzpayn Hours (Fig. 2) in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cam bridge, England (4), seems to me to be most naturally interpreted as largely a very beautiful piece of fun. The text is Psalm 6, Domine ne in furore tuo ("0 Lord rebuke me not in thine indignation"), which is the first of the seven penitential psalms. In the initial D there is appropriately a representation of the Crucifixion; at the bottom of the page Joan Fitzpayn, for whose wedding to Sir Richard Grey the book was prepared, kneels in 1978 November-December 677</page><page sequence="4">prayer. She wears an elaborate heraldic gown. On the inner margin her future husband, in chain mail with an armorial surcoat, is also kneeling, between two coats of arms. Piety and family pride came naturally in the first decade of the fourteenth century, but the rest of the illumina tion is in a totally different spirit. Along the top of the page there is a mammal that I think is a roe deer doe, and a muzzled bear, and a hedgehog. At the top of the outer margin is a badger in its earth, below it a mag nificent jay, and at the bottom a pigmy riding backward on a fox while playing a tabor. Along the bottom, separated from the lady in prayer by a couple of trees, is a lion engaged in eating its prey, and beyond him a couple of very strange figures?one a hominid lion, the other a woman with a veil over her mouth and a curious retort-shaped headdress?seem to be rather interested in each other. I do not doubt that with sufficient imagi nation, coupled with complete lack of critical caution and an overpowering desire for a higher degree, a symbolic interpretation related to Psalm 6, and leading at least to a master's thesis, could be distilled from all this; I do not believe, however, that such an effort would throw any real light on what I find to be one of the most en chanting and characteristic produc tions of the high Middle Ages. It is particularly important for historians of science to consider this, because many writers in the past have been so anxious to castigate the Church for being repressive that they have en tirely overlooked how much one could get away with, at least under some circumstances. An even more extraordinary example % is provided by the copy of the Golden Bull, essentially a constitution for the Holy Roman Empire, made for King Wetzel II of Bohemia (Vienna, ?st erreichische Nationalbibliothek Codex 338) (5). On f. 1 there are some admirable birds, including a lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), a great tit {Parus major), and a hawk with a very red breast and uncertain iden tity, decorating a most elaborate fol iate border, in which are set religious miniatures and at the bottom a knightly figure stuck in the initial W, as in the stocks, and surrounded by partly dressed young women?one of whom has a bucket?who are ob viously bath attendants. An immense Figure 4. Part of the marginal decoration of a German prayer book of 1514 shows a bullfinch, a cockchafer, a columbine flower, and what seems to be a rather asymmetrical aberration of the currant, or magpie, moth, Abraxas grossulariata, near ab. albomarginata. (Marley MS 9; courtesy of the Fitzwilliam Museum.) symbolic superstructure has been erected on this and similar scenes depicted in other manuscripts done for this monarch. I suspect, however, that they represent a fetishistic ob session on the part of the king and are no more philosophical or moral al legories than are the lapwing or the great tit. The first hint of ecological charac teristics in medieval painting is pro vided by scenes in calendars, of which those by the Limbourg brothers in Les tr?s riches heures du Duc de Berry (?), done between 1413 and 1416, are outstanding. Here hooded crows frequent a snowy farmyard in February, while rooks and magpies are feeding in a newly sown field in October. Insects, crustaceans, and molluscs It is obvious that the illuminators in the first half of the fourteenth cen tury had a good repertory of terres trial vertebrates, including forty to fifty species of birds, some mammals, and an occasional lizard. There are one or two fishes and at least one lamprey. They also painted a few in sects. The earliest example known to me is a white butterfly, probably the female of the common Pieris brassi cae, in a manuscript done in the west of England about 1309 (7). The insect is shown in a humorous context, having been accidentally shot by an archer who is now aiming a murder ous-looking hunting arrow at a beautifully drawn woodcock. The same motif, of the archer and the lepidopteron, appears in another slightly later English manuscript (8) . A good tortoiseshell butterfly, Ag?ais urticae, turns up on the margin of a French work*, the Belleville Breviary (9) , c. 1325, associated with the atelier of Jean Pucelle, in which there is also a recognizable damselfly, Agri?n splendens. Around 1380 an extraor dinary manuscript, the Cocharelli Treatise on the Vices {10), suppos edly Genoese but showing oriental influence, depicts dozens of insects, crust?cea, and molluscs, some of which had to wait till the nineteenth or even the twentieth century before they were properly figured again. This most puzzling work probably has some connection with the tradition of Frederick II. 678 American Scientist, Volume 66</page><page sequence="5">In the fifteenth century insects be came as important in decoration as were birds, perhaps even more so. In one manuscript in the British Library (Add. MS. 29433), associated with the painter now designated "The Master of the Brussels Initials" (11), we have the extraordinary use, in some of the borders done by a rather inferior as sistant, of a quite rare yellow and black mutant of a burnet moth (Zy gaena sp.), set off against the ordi nary red and black form of the same species. A more puzzling problem arises from an illumination (Fig. 4) in an early sixteenth-century vernacular German devotional book in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England (Marley 9, f. 246) (22). At the top of the wide decorative border there is an accurately painted bullfinch and an equally accurately painted cockcha fer, or May beetle, Melolontha vul garis. Below these, there is either a very inaccurate picture of an ordinary magpie moth, Abraxas grossulariata, or a more accurate representation of an asymmetrical aberration of this excessively variable species. Asym metrical patterns, though rare, are known in the insect. I have, however, not found any specimen to match the one depicted in the thousands of ex amples of the species in the Roths child-Cockayne-Kettlewell collection in the Natural History Museum, South Kensington. A few specimens of ab. albomarginata do, however, approach it. Though no single artist rivals the Master of the Cocharelli Treatise, a long list of insect species, mostly Le pidoptera, but including some Or thoptera, Hemiptera, and Cole?ptera, could be compiled from fifteenth century manuscripts. Along with them would be a few animals of groups not hitherto depicted in Western European art. There is a nice pond tortoise on f. 192b of B.M. Add. MS. 29433. A lovely frog, which from its middorsal stripe I take to be Rana esculenta, decorates a sumptuous copy of Christine de Pisan's Le livre des trois virtus, a very early feminist work, in the Beinecke Library at Yale (13). The same book, in which four pages have elaborate miniatures, is also decorated with birds and insects (Fig. 3). The Master of the Hours of Catherine of Cleves used Cancer pagurus with the correct number of emarginations along the carapace, and both Euro pean species of mussel, Mytilus edu lis and Modiolus modiolus, as deco rations for one of his pages. Some of the M. edulis bear barnacles. Snails abound in illuminated manu scripts and are sometimes recogniz able as Cepaea sp. Though often naturalistic, they may also provide part of the most peculiar hybrid creatures (14). One of these strange Figure 5. A detail from the border of M p. 268 of The Hours of Catherine of Cleves, done in the Netherlands about 1435, shows a quite ac curate tortoiseshell butterfly, Ag?ais urticae {upper left), and a much less accurate white butterfly, probably a female Pieris brassicae {upper right). Modern specimens are shown below for comparison. The painter was ob viously uncertain about his Pieris, giving its wing border the emarginate form of that of beings (see Fig. 6), apparently hunt ing a wren, is depicted in a charming little fifteenth-century Flemish Book of Hours, which is also so full of butterflies, if not all very good ones, that a friend of mine named it Les heures tr?s papillonn?es de M. Ra binowitz when it came to Yale from the collection of one of the great benefactors of the university (15). Though only a few pages of the Hours of Catherine of Cleves, a Dutch work of about 1435 in the Pierpont Morgan Library, have motifs from natural history, the butterflies are of partic ular significance, as they strongly suggest that at least preliminary sketches were made from life, in the field (16). The pictures of the nym phalids?the red admiral, Vanessa atalanta, and the small tortoiseshell, Ag?ais urticae (Fig. 5)?and the satyrid?the wall butterfly, Lasiom mata megera?are pretty accurate, but the large white Pieris brassicae Ag?ais or many other related butterflies. The tortoiseshell poses beautifully either in the position shown or with its wings fully open and flat. The white butterflies of the genus Pieris are more likely to flutter or to pose with their wings closed. These paintings were probably done from sketches made in the field, those of Ag?ais being more informative than those of Pieris. (Courtesy of Pierpont Morgan Library, New York.) (Fig. 5) is shown with an emarginate edge to the forewing like Gonopteryx, Vanessa, or Ag?ais. It is interesting to remember that Pieris flutters much more than the nymphalids, which can often be observed sitting quite still for minutes with wings spread or half open. Drawing the upper surface of a red admiral (V. atalanta) or tor toiseshell (A. urticae) from life is much easier than drawing that of any of the cabbage white butterflies (Pi eris spp.). 1978 November-December 679</page><page sequence="6">The surreal and the scientific All of the real animals depicted in medieval illuminated manuscripts may be accompanied by quite mythological beings, and very often naturalistic birds and mammals are used in strictly humorous and un naturalistic ways. Sometimes this involves a pure surrealism, compa rable in spirit to the classical fortui tous co-occurrence of a sewing ma chine and an umbrella on a dissecting Figure 7. The borders of Le livre de Lancelot du Lacy a French manuscript of about 1280, ascribed to Walter Map, are well supplied with satirical drawings. In this detail of the border of f. 94b, two rabbits return from a successful manhunt. (MS 229; courtesy of Beinecke Li brary.) Figure 6. A hybrid snail-man takes aim at a wren, from the border of f. 113b of the Alden ham-Rabinowitz Hours.

This is seen in an extraordinary miniature (Fig. 8) in the Rothschild Canticles (17), a Netherlands work of about 1320, in which a tree bears a tower on the top of which a pair of storks appear to be engaged in a nest-relief ceremony, while at the bottom of the tree are two wild boars, one brown and one gray, representing two color forms frequently recognized today in Europe. A pair of rabbits are seated nearby at the mouth of their burrow. One hopes that all this con jugal felicity has nothing to do with the text, a discussion of Saint Au gustine on damnation. A more moralizing spirit with strong social overtones is shown in the re markable drawing of two rabbits re turning from a manhunt (Fig. 7), one with the game over his shoulder, the other walking ahead blowing a horn (18). Comparable miniatures of rab bits conducting the obsequies of foxes are found in other manuscripts of like date. A number of motifs derived from Reynard the Fox are seen in medieval wood carvings and exemp lify the same critical point of view. It is, however, clear that as well as the humorous, allegorical, symbolic, and heraldic pictures of animals, the pe riod ca. 1280 to ca. 1480 saw the ac cumulation by artists of a great deal of understanding of the diversity of the living world. Some idea of in traspecific variation was also ob viously entertained. Though neither the brown and gray boars of the Rothschild Canticles nor the red and yellow burnet moths of B.M. Add. MS. 29433 are genetically more re markable than the red and white roses of the rival houses of Lancaster and York, the idea of using such morphs in conjunction as a decorative device is very interesting. There may well have been available a considerable amount of animal lore based on observations not only by artists but also by intelligent country people. We may perhaps see the in fluence of such a biological agraphia in the picture of an owl being mobbed by various birds in an East Anglian Book of Hours in Baltimore (Walters 105 f. 10b) or in the statement implying a knowledge of avian terri - toriality in Huchon's poem "Susan na." As with the equivocal gift to Ca nace of Chaucer's magical ring, There is no foul that fleeth under the hevene That she ne shal wel understonde his stevene And know his menyng openly and pleyn And answere hym in his langage ageyn. [F149-53, The Squieres Tale] Such lore, along with both the infor mation and misinformation that had come from antiquity, and the rich iconographie tradition, part of which we have just considered, formed the basis on which the first scientific naturalists started their work in the sixteenth century. With the invention of printing and consequent wide dissemination of books, illustration by black and white prints rather than individually drawn hand-colored paintings became usual, and the scientific illustration of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries became basically descriptive and often not very pleasing to the eye (19). The tradition of accurate but beautiful aesthetic realism now began to find another outlet, particularly in the Netherlands, in the works of the flower and insect painters such as Christoffel van der Berghe late in the tauganw</page><page sequence="7">sixteenth century and many others in the seventeenth century, of whom van Kessel was preeminent in his delight in insects. At the same time the im portation of exotic mammals and birds led to a great artistic interest in their appearance. Groups of exotic species in imaginary landscapes be came popular initially without any attention being paid to what lived where and with what other species. The same environment might thus support neotropical parrots, a cardi nal, and a European ruff {20). From a scientific point of view the most important insect painter was Maria Sibylla Merian {21). Though German Swiss in origin, she was brought up in the Dutch tradition, her stepfather, Jacob Marrell, having entrusted her artistic education to his student Abraham Mignon, a distin guished flower and insect painter. Her family apparently saw nothing odd in a young woman being greatly occupied with insects, but she was primarily an artist rather than a bi ologist. Classification, or indeed any form of generalization, meant little to her; what she loved was the sequence of forms as eggs hatched, caterpillars moulted, grew, and pupated, finally emerging as adult insects. Merian's great work, the Metamor phosis Insectorum Surinamensium, though it contained some errors, reconciled the old aesthetic realism of medieval origin with the new tradi tion of practical engravings in the natural history treatises. She was herself a skilled engraver, though in her later work she employed others to do most of this labor, presumably to set herself free for the time-consum ing task of hand-coloring. The book was widely disseminated and set a standard for the numerous very beautiful natural histories published in the eighteenth and early nine teenth centuries. She had done much to create an important applied art, Figure 8. A fantastically situated stork's nest decorates the border of f. 121 of the Rothschild Canticles, vol. II, a Netherlands work of about 1320. The unhappy cropping of the bottom margin is due to this part of the existing book having been bound up with what seems to have been originally an independent work with smaller pages. (MS 404; courtesy of Beinecke Library.) which continued to flourish for two hundred years after her great book was published, reaching its highest point perhaps in the various mono graphs illustrated by Edward Lear. While the elaborately illustrated natural histories were making known the external appearance of the larger and more conspicuous animals of the globe, an interest in anatomy was growing in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in France. The figures that were essen tial features of anatomical publica tion were for the most part rather undistinguished artistically, though some odd and not easily explained conventions arose in this type of zoological illustration. In the great Histoire naturelle, g?n?rale et par ticuli?re, for which Buffon was largely responsible, skeletons are de picted mounted on simple but often cracked classical plinths in parklike open-air surroundings (Fig. 11). There was doubtless some intellectual tension between systematic natural ists intent on the description of nu merous species easily distinguished by external characters and anato mists who felt that skeletons and viscera provided deeper and more fundamental insights. The idea of the animal having an environment was still curiously undeveloped, as may be realized from Daubenton's figure of a winter ermine (Histoire naturelle, tome 7, pl. xxix): the pelage has whi tened but not the appearance of the 1978 November-December 681</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9. Two Indians disguised as wolves hunt bison, which the artist George Catlin said paid no attention to wolves. (Catlin's North Amer ican Indian Portfolio, pi. 13, see note 23.) landscape. The Limbourg brothers, doing a calendar scene for Les tr?s riches heures, were far more sensitive to ecological matters. One of the first painters to be concerned with the environments of his animal subjects was Agasse, a French painter working in England (22). Though he used as models animals in menageries, he often took considerable pains to ob tain accurate information about the landscapes in which they occurred naturally. The majority, though by no means all, of the genera of larger terrestrial an imals had been discovered before the end of the eighteenth century, but a host of smaller forms, often of im mense scientific interest, continued to turn up and indeed still do so. Many of these animals were depicted, when first described, in charming hand-colored lithographs. The exploration of both North America and Africa produced a rather characteristic genre of nature paint ing, which may be called colloquially the art of the great open spaces. The spaces were, however, at that time filled with animals, some such as the quagga now extinct, others like the American bison that were conserved in the nick of time. Some of Catlin's paintings provide extraordinary ex amples. The one here reproduced (Fig. 9) shows obvious affinity in subject matter to a famous Bushman painting discovered by Stow in South Africa (Fig. 10) (23). Perhaps the most important aesthetic aspect of zoology in the nineteenth century was the discovery and de scription of a very large number of marine planktonic animals, ranging in size from the microscopic Radi olaria and Foraminifera to the some times immense jellyfish and sipho nophores. These animals, living in an essentially isotropie fluid of almost the same density as themselves, suffer little from the restraints imposed by gravity on free growth in all possible directions. The marvelous geometri cal designs of these organisms had an extraordinary fascination for Ernst Haeckel (24), who was at his best when illustrating them in his Chal lenger Reports. His more explicit at tempt to bring the geometry of living nature into art, Kunstformen der Natur, is less successful, having at times a feeling of what can only be called Biergarten Art Nouveau. The invention of various mechanical and photographic processes for re producing color plates at best im proved the accuracy but rarely en hanced the aesthetic aspects of late nineteenth- and early twentieth century colored plates (25). Today the development of photography as an art form has begun to produce animal photographs in which de scriptive and aesthetic realism are combined, much as in the great works of Maria Sibylla Merian or Edward Lear. I would particularly mention the marvelous pictures of bats by Nina Leen (26). Moreover, scanning electron microphotography is now revealing decorative patterns on a far smaller scale than were known to the nineteenth-century microscopists. Evolution and anthropomorphism We have seen now how from the cru dest descriptive beginnings in the early thirteenth century the art of animal illustration became a form of decoration, and then as the diversity of living beings became more and more known, the descriptive and decorative aspects were woven to gether to produce works which though primarily intended to illus trate a text and inform the viewer yet are truly beautiful in their own right, somewhat in the same way that na ture can be beautiful. This is the story that emerges from looking mainly outward into the external world, hoping that the immense subjective element is not overwhelming us. We saw at the beginning that if we start taking the internal too seriously the animals turn into ourselves; we may even find the rabbits are hunting us. We must, therefore, to complete the story, return to animal humor. The essence of animal humor involves a comparison of human behavior and what an animal might be supposed to do. The scene of the rabbits coming home from a manhunt imposes an ideal but unrealized symmetry on the behavior of Homo sapiens and Or yctolagus cuniculus.

I ^.^^ JT irf?L matic, but with more opportunities for fantasy, are the singeries so pop ular in the seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries, in which monkeys, often in the clothes or with the arti facts of man, are depicted as engaging in various human activities. Such pictures raise the question as to what a monkey, or for that matter a human being, really is, a subject which in pre-Darwinian days gave rise to end less and rather fruitless speculation. The concept of the singerie might be extended to embrace the whole ani mal kingdom, as scenes were painted of other animals similarly engaged. The most extraordinary one that I know is an animal college (see cover) by the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Cornells Saftleven (1607 1681). In this interior scene a number of animals with various human at tributes loll around a stove on the mantel of which, among other objets surr?alistes, stands an infantile or foetal skeleton, with a deformed head, a lance in its right hand, and a long thin tail ending in a bird of paradise plume. Above this is the skull of a stag with antlers growing out of its eye sockets. The only identifiable book visible in this parody of academic life is a Dutch translation of the late me dieval romance Amadis de Gaula. Saftleven, in this picture, achieves effects largely unknown in the works of other painters after Hieronymus Bosch, who doubtless influenced him, and before Salvador Dali. Though he was described as pictor noctium phantasmatum, most encyclopedic works play down this aspect of Saft leven's art. In later life he apparently became known for his masterly treatment of poultry in rural scenes. So long as Western man accepted the first chapters of Genesis as histori cally true, the affinities implied by such pictures were of a rather abstract sort, and although zoologists debated these affinities freely in the eigh teenth and the first half of the nine Figure 11.

[Histoire natur elle, tome 10, pl. xxiv, 1757.) teenth century, to most of them they officially did not imply descent, any more than did the similarities be tween the then newly isolated alkali metals sodium and potassium imply one being derived from the other. French rationalism had played with the idea of evolution, Erasmus Dar win and Lamarck had tried to postu late mechanisms by which it might occur, but convinced relatively few. When Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace provided a simple and essentially inevitable hypothesis as an explanation, all this began to change. Animals again became, as in the pre literate past of some of us, actual rel atives. As we now may conclude, the anthropoid apes are roughly millionth cousins of each of us. In his Civilisation (27), Lord Clark wrote, "Artists, who have been very little influenced by social systems, have always responded instinctively to latent assumptions about the shape of the universe." At first it appeared very odd that no obvious change in the attitude of artists to the animal world seems to have taken place as the concept of evolution triumphed throughout the nineteenth century. But further thought does suggest one thing. The post-Darwinian world is the world of Alice in Wonderland and of Peter Rabbit. Perhaps initially only children with a feeling of kinship to anything having two eyes, a nose, and a mouth and with a belief in progress?as I become a big boy or a big girl at the age of four or five or 1978 November-December 683</page><page sequence="10">six?were able to take in their strides the actual genetic relationship that had now become apparent. At least as far as my own memory goes, dating back to the end of this period, the kinship has always seemed obvious. Notes 1.

My friend, the late Laura Mangione, wrote to me in March 1953, "At Castelvetrano ... at the Messa Pasquale, on the daybreak, after the Gloria in Excelsis Deo has been sung, plenty of people crowded in the square, between two streets; the statue of Christ risen is at an entrance of one street, the Madonna Addolorata, covered with a black mantle is at the other. An angel is sent by Ges? to Maria to say He is risen. Maria cannot believe at first, but after the angel has come three times . . . Her mantle falls down and a flock of goldfinches or of sparrows come out." 5. Well reproduced in Franz Unterkircher, 1967, A Treasury of Illuminated Manu scripts (G. P. Putnam), pi. 17.

The great painters of the High Renaissance and of the Baroque were of course often interested in scenes involving large mam mals and, to a lesser extent, other animals. Recently, Cecile Kruyfhooft and Simone Buys (1977, P. P. Rubens et la peinture animali?re, Antwerp: Soci?t? Royale de Zoologie d'Anvers) have given a most in teresting analysis of the role of Rubens's chief "animalier," Franz Snyders. 20. The reference is specifically to a work of J.
