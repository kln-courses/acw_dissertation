PETERSON and A. TOWNSEND PETERSON* Centerfor Latin American Studies, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana 70118 and Museum of Natural Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803 U.S.A. Abstract. The exploitation of cloud forests by the Aztec empire was studied using information from codices describing the Aztec tribute system. Large quantities of sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) resin were harvested and transported in various forms to the Aztecs. Surprising quantities of feathers from several species of birds were also delivered. Judging from the quantity of resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) feathers indicated, the yearly harvest was at least 620, and may have been as high as 31,000 quet- zals. We suggest that many cloud forests and associat- ed flora and fauna may have been disturbed considerably over many hundreds of years. Key words. cloud forest, habitat disturbance, human activities, Aztecs, tribute system. INTRODUCTION The present distribution of habitat types in northern Middle America has been documented and described by a number of authors (e.g. Miranda &amp; Sharp, 1950; Rzedowski, 1978). A question of importance to both anthropologists and biologists is that of how to docu- ment changes in habitat distribution and condition over the long history of human habitation in the region. For instance, considerable evidence indicates that the tran- sition from Archaic to Formative times hinged upon the development of technologies and skills for altering original habitat structures: cultivation in situ of natu- rally growing plant species, domestication of wild food plants, and selective harvesting of timber (Coe &amp; Flan- nery, 1964). Classic and Post-Classic civilizations created elaborate networks for the trade and redistribu- tion of such geographically restricted products as shells, obsidian, dyes, and timber (Durand-Forest, 1971; Berdan, 1976, 1986; Bryant, 1983; Feldman, 1985; Hassig, 1985; Kolb, 1987). Basic subsistence products like corn and beans became part of this complex system of redistribution as a means to support growing populations in urban centres. Well before the time of the Spanish Conquest, long- term agricultural activities and exploitation of natural resources had resulted in substantial modifications of natural habitats. The forests of the Pet6n district of the Yucutan Peninsula appear to be a sort of secondary vegetation resulting from centuries of cultivation by Mayan peoples (Rzedowski, 1978). Similarly, by the time of the Spanish Conquest, the extent of pine forests in the Valle de Mexico had been greatly reduced by harvesting of trees for wood and charcoal (Rzedowski, 1978). Therefore, biogeographic analyses of present-day Middle America must take into account human use and modification of so-called natural habi- tats over time. Several potential sources of information regarding past habitat distributions have not been exploited fully. Archaeological studies of changes in habitat distribu- tions in Middle America are oriented toward areas of human occupation or agricultural use. Data on sparse- ly populated or 'undisturbed' areas are scarce, despite the potential availability of information from sources such as pollen deposition (Graham, 1975) and verte- brate fossils (Miller, 1937). Another possible source of data on nonagricultural exploitation of natural habitats are the records of tributes demanded by the Aztec empire. The purpose of this study is to correlate data on the *Present address: Division of Birds, Field Museum of Natural History, Roosevelt Road at Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60605-2496, U.S.A. 165</page><page sequence="2">166 AmVA. Peterson andA. Townsend Peterson use of animal and plant products by the Aztecs with known distribution patterns of Middle American cloud forests. We review documents listing tribute items from different regions of the Aztec empire, fo- cusing on natural products, and argue that some tribute items (certain bird feathers and tree resins) could only have been obtained from cloud forest. We then use the geographic distribution of suppliers of these items to obtain some indication of patterns and intensity of Aztec exploitation of cloud forests in the period immediately preceeding the Spanish Conquest in 1519. Definition and history of cloud forest in Middle America As a biogeographic entity, cloud forest can be defined as montane tropical forest receiving high moisture input from clouds or fog. These forests are typically dense and moist, dominated by epiphytes and tree ferns. Tree genera characteristic of cloud forest in Mexico are Quercus, Podocarpus, Juglans, and espe- cially Chiranthodendron and Liquidambar (Rzedow- ski, 1978). Cloud forest occurs along the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Mexico from Tamaulipas and Sinaloa south to Oaxaca and Chiapas, with a few iso- lated patches high on interior mountains such as the Cerro de Tancitaro, Michoacan (Fig. 1). Mexican cloud forests share a number of tree species with the deciduous forests of the eastern United States (e.g. Alnus, Fagus, Cornus, Liquidambar, Populus, Ulmus), which Martin &amp; Harrell (1957) interpret as evidence for an early bridge of humid temperate forest between the two regions; pollen analyses suggest that floristic elements of cloud forest have existed in their present distribution since the Eocene (Graham, 1975). Therefore, components of cloud forest have been in place since well before the earliest human occupation in Middle America (approximately 20,000 yr BP). L ~~~~~~~~~~0 N~ O.' 250 km Fig. 1.

Aztec imperial trade was based on conquest: as neigh- bouring groups were conquered and assimilated, they were assessed tributes of goods based on availability, value, and the degree of punitive intent toward that region (Berdan, 1976, 1980, 1986). Items demanded included gold, turquoise, jade, finished luxury cloth- ing, maize, beans, cotton, salt, lime, animal skins, birds, feathers, timber, shells, pottery, cochineal dye, rubber, and incenses (Clark, 1938; Matricula de Tribu- tor, 1980; Berdan, 1986; Mohar, 1983). Tribute was monitored and administered regionally by imperial tribute officers stationed in Cabeceras, pueblos which collected and processed goods from smaller, satellite pueblos (Berdan, 1976, 1986; Durand-Forest, 1971). Through this state-administered system, the urban Aztec populations were able to exploit many widely separated habitats to acquire a diverse array of consu- mer goods. Several of the tributary provinces exploited by the Aztecs contained extensive cloud forest, and forest products were demanded accordingly. The Aztecs de- manded feathers of the resplendent quetzal (Pharo- machrus mocinno de la Llave) for ceremonial purposes. Quetzals occur only in the narrow cloud forest zone from southern Mexico south into Central America (Fig. 1; AOU, 1983). Another important cloud forest product was sweet gum tree (Liquidambar sty- raciflua L.) resin. Liquidambar is a tree characteristic 35 33 32 23 18a1 25 19 24 Fig. 2.

Peterson and A. Townsend Peterson of eastern Mexican cloud forests (Rzedowski, 1978). Its resin, here referred to as liquidambar, was used in medicines, smoked with tobacco, burned as incense, and perhaps formed into figurines used in sacrifices (Alarc6n, 1984). In fact, when Cortez first met the Aztec emperor Montezuma in 1519, There were also placed on the table three tubes much painted and gilded, which held liquidam- bar mixed with certain herbs which they call tabaco, and when he had finished eating, after they had danced before him and sung and the table was removed, [Montezuma] inhaled the smoke from one of those tubes, but he took very little of it and with that he fell asleep. (DIaz del Castillo, 1956) Other products from cloud forests used by the Aztecs included vanilla beans, oil from particular varieties of trees (Chiranthodendron sp.), and certain bird feath- ers. Hence, products from cloud forests were impor- tant to the urban consumers of the Aztec empire. METHODS We examined the three primary sources of informa- tion on tributes demanded by the Aztecs: (1) the Mat- ricula de tributos (1980), a painted manuscript on native amate paper of probable Preconquest prove- nance annotated by an unknown Spanish hand in the sixteenth century; (2) the Codex Mendoza (Clark, 1938; Codex Mendoza, 1980), a painted manuscript on European paper produced in 1535 shortly after the Conquest to document Aztec political, economic, and social systems for the king of Spain; (3) Informacion sobre los tributos que los indios pagaban a Moctezu- ma, aino de 1554 (1957), a transcript of testimony by seven former Aztec scribes to the Audiencia of New Spain. Information on Postconquest tributes was ob- tained from Borah &amp; Cook (1958). Identifications of glyphs in the pictorial manuscripts followed Nahuatl and Spanish annotations in the Matricula and Codex Mendoza, and were corroborated by comparisons with the Informaci6n. From these sources, we extracted data on tributes from thirty-seven provinces. Geo- graphic locations of tribute towns were taken from Mohar (1983) and Clark (1938). All references to natural products were identified as precisely as possible and habitats determined from standard descriptions of Mexican flora and fauna (e.g. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, 1950; Miller et al., 1957; Rzedowski, 1978) and comparisons with AB C D Fig. 3. Glyphs representing various tribute items: copalli or copal, glyphs A and B; xochiocozatl or liqui- dambar, glyphs C and D; lovely cotinga, E; and a handful of quetzal feathers, F. museum specimens. Feathers sent as tributes in the form of headdresses and warrior costumes were not included in these analyses owing to difficulties in identification of source species. Distinct glyphs refer- ring to copalli and liquidambar (Nahuatl xochiocozatl) products were designated as A, B, C, and D (Fig. 3), and identified as to probable botanical source. Infor- mation on the current distribution of cloud forests in Middle America was derived from standard botanical references (Miranda &amp; Sharp, 1950; Martin &amp; Harrell, 1957; Rzedowski, 1978), as well as from results of ongoing exploration by the Museo de ZoologIa, Facul- tad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de Mexico.

Townsend Peterson species are most abundant in lowland tropical forests (both humid and dry): blue birds identifiable as the lovely cotinga (Cotinga amabilis Gould) from the de- tailed paintings in the Codex Mendoza, and spotted cat skins identifiable as ocelot (Felix pardalis; Clark, 1938). Both of these species were sent from Xoconoch- co (modem Sierra de Soconusco and adjacent lowlands, Chiapas), where they also occur in the wild. Another glyph is annotated as simply 'eagle' of undetermined species (Clark, 1938). Eagles were demanded from only two localities (Xillotepec and Oxitipan), both of which are on the southeastern margin of the Chihua- huan Desert. Since only one species of eagle is found in this region, we suggest that the glyph be interpreted as the golden eagle [Aquila chrysaetos (Linnaeus)]. Feathers of the resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinino) were an important tribute item. Quetzal feathers were demanded from five provinces: Coayxt- lahuacan (south of modem Tehuzcan, Puebla), Tlach- quiauco (modem northeastern Oaxaca), Tochtepec (modern Tuxtepec, Oaxaca), Xoconochco (modem Sierra de Soconusco, Chiapas), and Quauhtochco (modern central Veracruz and Puebla). Of these sites, only Xoconochco falls within the known distribution of the resplendent quetzal (Fig. 1), but the other sites lie more or less along known trade routes connecting southern Chiapas with Tenochtitlan (Berdan, 1976, 1986; Feldman, 1985; Hassig, 1985). The sheer quantity of quetzal feathers harvested for imperial tribute is a crucial factor. Quetzals and quetzal feathers were esteemed for their symbolic value but also for their rarity: even under ideal habitat conditions quetzals today are not abundant. Yet, from Xoconochco alone the tribute rolls record a yearly harvest of 800 bunches or handfuls. From the five trib- utary provinces mentioned above, yearly tribute in quetzal feathers totals 2480 bunches (Table 1). From descriptions in the annotations of the codices it appears that these bunches of feathers consisted chiefly of the characteristic elongated tail feathers (Clark, 1938). Based on examination of museum spec- imens, we estimate that a 'handful' would contain ten to fifty tail feathers, that a maximum of four long feathers may be obtained from each bird, and hence that the quantities of feathers recorded in the tribute codices would require a harvest of 6200-31,000 quet- zals each year. Although feathers may have been har- vested without killing the quetzals, this figure is staggering, given that even in undisturbed habitat in areas not touched by the Aztec feather trade, quetzals are typically scarce and difficult to find. Four of the thirty-seven Cabeceras (Fig. 2) deliv- ered Copalli or liquidambar as tribute (Table 1). Two Cabeceras sent Copalli (glyphs A and B, Fig. 3): Tlachco (modern Taxco, Guerrero) and Tepequacuilco (near modern Iguala, Guerrero). Both localities are located along the northern rim of the Balsas Depres- sion, an arid basin filled with semideciduous tropical scrub (Tzedowski, 1978); no Liquidambar is present in the region or in the general vicinity (Fig. 1). The other two cabeceras sent liquidambar resin (glyphs C and D, Fig. 3): Tochtepec (modern Tuxtepec, Oaxaca), and Tlatlauhquitepec (near modern Teziutlan, Puebla). Both sites hold extensive cloud forest dominated by Liquidambar (Figs 1 and 2). Quantities of liquidambar resin requested were large: from Tochtepec, 100 pots of resin yearly, and from Tlatlauhquitepec, 8000 bundles of resin yearly. DISCUSSION What are copal and liquidambar? The incense generally refeired to as copal was em- ployed in nearly every religious and political function in Aztec life (Hough, 1912; Motolinia, 1971; Alarc6n, 1984). The Preconquest importance of copal is dem- onstrated by cache offerings containing pieces of copal (Torres Montes, 1967; Navarrete, 1968) and great numbers of clay and stone censers with residues of carbonized incense found in archaeological sites throughout Middle America (Hough, 1912). However, considerable linguistic confusion surrounds interpreta- tions of Aztec use of copal and liquidambar products. The problem apparently began with one of the very first chroniclers of Aztec customs. Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, ethnographer of Mexican indigenous cul- tures in the sixteenth century, confused liquidambar with pine, the resin of which was also employed by the Aztecs for a variety of purposes (Sahagun, 1950- 69). Later authorities, such as Francisco Javier Clavi- jero of the eighteenth century, lumped liquidambar resin with other tree resins (e.g. Pinus, Bursera) under the term 'copalli' (Clavijero, 1971), thus obscuring the importance of Liquidambar as a source of incense resins. Despite the importance of copal incense in both archeological and ethnographic contexts, no modern studies document its composition, sources, and manufacture. Modern anthropological and ethno- graphic studies frequently apply the term 'copal' without any definition of its composition (Broda de Casas, 1971, 1986; Feldman, 1985; Hassig, 1985) or</page><page sequence="7">Aztec tributes from cloud forests 171 rely on vague references to Bursera, Pinus sp., and Li- quidambar in the botanical literature (Rzedowski, 1978; Ramirez, 1902; Sauer, 1950). In the painted manuscript codices (Matricula, Mendoza), four symbols (designated A, B, C, and D) are identified in annotations as incense composed of resinous substances (Fig. 3). Of these, A and B were called Copalli and sent from areas located in wood- lands with abundant Bursera and no liquidambar. Hence, glyphs A and B are best interpreted as refer- ring to incense made predominantly of bursera resin. Symbols C and D are annotated in the painted manu- scripts as xochiocotzotl, or liquidambar, and were sent exclusively from localities located in cloud forest con- taining Liquidambar and lacking extensive Bursera stands; we argue that these resins were obtained from Liquidambar trees. Identifications of all four symbols are corroborated in the Informaci6n. Hence, the generic term 'copal' (also termed Incienso de la tierra in sixteenth century sources such as Motolinia, 1971) refers to several distinct varieties of incense made from resins of different tree species. Another point of interest is the information on quantities of these incenses provided by tribute codices. The Matricula indicates that a total of 16,000 bundles of copal and 800 palm baskets of the more refined white copal were demanded yearly from the cabeceras of Tlachco and Tepecuacuilco, and 8000 loads and 100 pots of liquidambar resin were demand- ed yearly from the two cabeceras in the east. Hence, both types of resin were exploited in large quantities, indicating that Bursera resins and liquidambar both were in high demand by the Aztec state and/or urban consumers. The quantities and location of liquidambar exploited through imperial tribute networks suggest the presence of extensive Liquidambar forest in at least two eastern Mexican sites in the sixteenth century: the Sierra Norte of Puebla and the Sierra de Juarez of Oaxaca. Extensive Liquidambar forests exist in both areas today, although now they are now being reduced substantially owing to human activities. The degree to which harvesting activities would have mod- ified or perturbed the forests is unknown because of a complete lack of information on methods used in ex- tracting resins. Patterns of consumption It is possible that our identifications of Aztec tributes are overly specific. For example, the 'quetzal' feather glyph might refer to any long, green feather (e.g. from macaws, Ara spp.), and the 'lovely cotinga' glyph might refer to any blue bird. We consider this possibil- ity unlikely, however, because of the geographic dis- tribution of tributes of those items. The only green- tailed macaw occurring in Mexico, the military macaw (Ara militaris L.), is most common in the mountains of western Mexico, and yet all tributes of 'quetzal' feathers come from eastern and southern Mexico (and possibly farther south). If any blue bird had sufficed for 'lovely cotinga,' then tributes of bunt- ings (Passerina spp., Guiraca spp., Cyanocompsa spp.) and bluebirds (Sialia spp.) would be expected from farther north in the Aztec empire. Hence, we believe that the Aztecs were quite specific in the iden- tification of the items that they demanded in tribute. Other problems in interpretation of these data remain unresolved. For instance, some authors prefer to interpret the quantity of quetzal feathers demanded in terms of total number of feathers rather than total number of bunches of feathers (e.g. Berdan, 1986). Under this interpretation, the number of quetzals esti- mated to have been harvested yearly would be 620, which is still a startling total. Other unresolved prob- lems include (1) that the tribute rolls indicate what was demanded of each province, but give no indica- tion of what was actually sent; (2) whether the tributes demanded were typical of a long period of time, or simply applied for a few years; and (3) the degree to which goods listed as being demanded from a particu- lar province were actually imported from other regions. One problematic aspect of patterns of consumption of cloud forest products by the Aztecs is the differ- ence between the harvest of quetzal feathers and ex- ploitation of potential sources of liquidambar. Quetzals were acquired from all source habitats falling within the imperial tribute network, and appar- ently also from areas further south (Berdan, 1976, 1986; Hassig, 1985), in quantities that suggest over- harvesting of a limited resource. In contrast, however, liquidambar resin was demanded from only two sites (Tochtepec, Tlatlauhquitepec). Several other cabece- ras probably included extensive stands of Liquidam- bar trees: Quauhtochco, Cuetlaxtecatl, Tlapacoyan, Atlan, Ctzicoac, and Oxitipan (Fig. 2). It is odd that li- quidambar was not demanded from any of these areas. Because several of the unexploited areas are geo- graphically more easily accessible than are Tochtepec or Tlatlauhquitepec (e.g. Quauhtochco, Cuetlaxtecatl), economic or political factors may have prevented the</page><page sequence="8">172 Amy A. Peterson and A. Townsend Peterson Aztecs from exploiting liquidambar as they did quetzal feathers. Implications for anthropological studies Trade and tribute analyses are an important aspect of the study of Middle American Classic and Post- Classic civilizations. Much valuable information re- garding technologies, economic and subsistence pat- terns, and the hierarchical consumption of luxury items has been derived from studies of archaeological remains. When found in archaeological contexts, non- perishable items such as shells, obsidian, amber and other semiprecious stones have been used to demon- strate otherwise indiscernible economic and political relationships between geographically separated socie- ties (Berdan, 1976, 1986; Bryant, 1983; Durand- Forest, 1971; Hassig, 1985; Kolb, 1987; Lee &amp; Navar- rete, 1978). Likewise, studies of local workshops for the manufacture of goods such as obsidian tools and pottery lead to inferences about technologies and social practices centered around acquiring, processing, and transporting manufactured goods. Despite the fact that incense resins were historically important trade items, probably constituting a large proportion of the bulk of trade from some regions, and that these resins continue to be used in comparable contexts among contemporary indigenous groups in Middle America, no rigorous study of incense resins from production through consumption has been con- ducted. In Preconquest times, incense was burned at nearly every ceremonial or social occasion, as evi- denced by ethnohistorical sources and the large numbers of censers, braziers, and ladles found in archaeological excavations (Hough, 1912; Motolinia, 1971). In recent excavations of the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan, anthropomorphic statues made of 'copal' were recovered from cache offerings (Broda de Casas, 1971, 1986); similar items have been found in Maya caches (Nevarrete, 1968; Torres Montes, 1967). It is possible that these are examples of the very items referred to in the Informacion as 'hombres hechos de copal.' Although most of the glyphs for incense resins (copal or liquidambur) indicate that they were transported in perishable containers, glyph C depicts a pot (olla in annotation) full of liquidambar resin, which could well indicate a ceramic container for transport (Fig. 3). Considering the relative quantity of such pots of liquidambar resin being transported yearly, it seems likely that examples already exist in museum collections. Disturbance and human use of Mexican cloud forests The extent of Preconquest exploitation of Liquidambar forests, at least in northern Puebla and northern Oaxaca, would suggest some caution in assumption about 'dis- turbed' versus 'undisturbed' cloud forest habitats. If large-scale extraction of resin were taking place, as is suggested by the tribute information, Liquidambar forests may have undergone considerable modification by human presence over a very long period of time. However, such speculation is hindered by an almost complete lack of ethnographic data on how liquidambar resin was extracted, even though use of incense resins continues in contemporary indigenous groups of Middle America (Hough, 1912; pers. observ.). Populations of animals characteristic of cloud forest may also have been affected by the Aztec tribute system. Each of the species listed in Table 1 is uncommon or rare, even in areas protected from human hunting. If our sources are reliable, the quanti- ties of animals harvested are significant, especially given the apparent concentration of the harvest in par- ticular areas, such as Xoconochco. A harvest of 6200- 31,000 quetzals per year would have affected popula- tions seriously, even with some influx of feathers from trading with groups farther south in Guatemala; harvesting feathers without killing the quetzals would likely have interfered with nesting activities, further affecting populations. Similarly large harvests were made of other sensitive species, such as the lovely cotinga and ocelot. Feathers of many other species were sent as tributes in the form of headdresses and warrior costumes, although determination of which species has not been possible. Presumably, more common species also were harvested, if only for food or less valuable feathers. Hence, the degree to which cloud forest animal populations and distributions may be assumed to be undisturbed and at demographic equilibrium is uncertain.
