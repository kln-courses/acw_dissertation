<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dorothy J. Crawford, Jan Quaege beur, Willy Glarysse: Studies on Ptolemaic Memphis. Louvain 1980. XVI, 144 S. (Studia Hellenistica. 24.) 650 bfr. The book under review contains three longer studies and a shorter one. Only the first two studies treat an aspect of Ptolemaic Memphis while the 3rd shorter contribution uses as starting point only a visit paid to Memphis by Ptolemy II and the last contribution does not directly or primarily concern Memphis. I cannot agree with the editor of the series when he says in the Preface (p. VII): ?It is not a collection of studies unrelated but for a common theme.? On the other hand, we can partly subscribe to his view that ?the collaborators - - - came to a common view on Ptolemaic Memphis?. They are indeed all convinced of the important role of the old Egyptian capital Memphis, the Memphite nome and its inhabitants in (early) Ptolemaic history. D. J. Crawford ('Ptolemy, Ptah and Apis in Hellenistic Memphis', pp. 5-42) deals with the role played by the high priests of Memphis and their relations with the Ptolemaic court at Alexandria. Starting from the relations of the Ptole mies with the cults of the anthropomorphic Ptah and of the theriomorphic Apis, worshipped during his lifetime in Ptah's temple at Memphis, she investigates the changing attitudes of the newly arrived Ptolemaic rulers towards the original Egyptian inhabitants. To reach her goal she skillfully combines hieroglyphic and demotic evidence with Greek sources (papyri, inscriptions and the accounts given by Polybius and Diodorus Siculus). It is a problem that at certain times these sources are better represented than at other periods. Mainly by contributing to the burial and installation ceremonies of Apis and also in several other ways (the Ptolemies sometimes even attended the burial and/or installation of the Apis bull), the rulers of Egypt showed their respect for this part of the Egyptian religion. The deification of Arsinoe, sister and wife of Ptolemy II, brought the dynasty into con tact with the high priests of Memphis where Arsinoe became the consort of Ptah. The good relations lasted till the end of Ptolemaic rule as can inter alia be deduced from the royal cult in Memphis. Rightly C. says (28): ?it is difficult to know what the dynastic cult meant in real terms to the population of the country.? Her point of view, however, is more positive on p. 36: ?the cultic honours which the priests voted the king and his consort were not empty honours in the eyes of the Egyptians.? The fact that at least from the reign of Ptolemy V onwards it was the high priest of Ptah who crowned the Ptolemies may point in the same direction. After some reluctance Augustus recognised the im portance of the one particular family of Memphitic high priests which for almost 300 years had had a close relationship with the Ptolemaic rulers, but this family disappeared with the last known member of a secondary branch of the family, Psenamounis II, during the reign of the same emperor. Miss Crawford vividly shows how the ruling dynasty tried to stay on good terms with the temples and their priests. She does so by dealing with the good relationship between the Ptolemies and a special priestly family. By their acts the Ptolemies showed perfectly that they knew that the strength of the temples and their priests ?Lay in their terms of land and property, or (maybe she should have said 'and') their influence in terms of the hold they exercised over the native po pulation? (7). In his contribution ('The Genealogy of the Memphite High Priest Family in the Hellenistic Period', pp. 47-81) J. Quaege beur enlarges, based on his previous stu dies, on the stemma of high priests of Memphis given by C. on p. 20 of her study (on p. 47 one is wrongly referred to p. 99). His main purpose is to give a detailed account of this genealogical table and to justify the succession of Memphite high priests convincingly proposed by him on pp. 72-73. To arrive at this succession Qu. has to redate and reinterpret statue Alexandria 27806 (ca. 260 B. C), statue Moscow 5351 (ca. 220 B. C), the statues Alexandria 17533-17534 (ca. 220 B. C.) and the Chercel statue (ca. 180 B. C).</page><page sequence="2">824 P'J' Sijpesteijn: Crawford\Quaegebeur\Clarysse, Studies on Ptolem. Memphis He defends his chronology against the divergent views of P. Munro (Die sp?t ?gyptischen Totenstelen = ?gyptische Forschungen 25, Gl?ckstadt 1973), D. Wildung (LA II, 1977, col. 1202/3) and especially E. A. E. Reymond - J.W. Barns, 'Alexandria and Memphis. Some Histori cal Observations', Orientalia 46, 1977, 1-33 (this article was not used by C; cf. p. 42,1 n. and p. 47,1 n.). For each of the 37 known members of the family of the high priests a wealth of prosopo graphical material (now incorporated in PP IX: Addenda et Corrigenda au Volume III [1956]) is given. For a person like the present reviewer who does not know Demotic it would have been con venient if everywhere the Greek equivalent of a Demotic name or expression would have been given. Egyptologists, on the other hand, will look in vain for the con ventional transcription of the names of the stemma (52) given in their Greek form at the end of Qu.'s paper as is promised on p. 51. It makes the understanding of and working with intricate genealogical tables easier when homonymes are dis tinguished by a number. On p. 51 Har maches the son of Anemher II is meant. Qu. also deals with P. Ross. Georg. Ill 26 (this papyrus has to be dated later than the 3rd year of Alexander Severus, 223/4 A. D.; it probably has to be dated to January 235 A. D.) which mentions priests of a temple of Hephaistos at Alexandria. The mention of Hephaistos naturally brings to mind the god Ptah (cf. p. 74,4 n. ; in the reference to P. Oxy. XXXIV 2722, especially line 54 Owvi? 'H9a(.CTTaTo? too a?TOu speaks for itself). Qu. shows that this Greek papyrus does not necessarily - as generally has been accepted - prove the existence of a sanc tuary of Ptah in Alexandria in Roman times. W. Clarysse contributes two articles to the present volume. In his smaller paper ('A Royal Visit to Memphis and the End of the Second Syrian War', pp. 85-89) he connects a visit of Ptolemy II to Memphis in July 253 B. C. (cf. PSI IV 354, P. P?trie II 13, 18a [with a corrected reading of the verso] and 13, 6) with an extensive settlement of clerouchs in the northeastern Arsinoite nome as is attested in several Greek papyri of 253/2 B. C. He connects (following J. Lesquier, REG 32, 1919? 359~375) bc-tfi the grants of kleroi and the presence of Ptolemy II in Memphis with the end of the Second Syrian War. His second contribution ('Philadelphia and the Memphites in the Zenon Archive', pp. 95-122) is one of the by-products of Clarysse's collaboration of an international project on the Zenon archive, the results of which are now available in the splendid volumnes XX and XXI of the Papyrologica Lugduno Batava. Cl. proves that the contacts of Philadelphia, the main centre of Zenon's activities, were much closer with the Nile valley than with the Arsinoite nome with which it had mainly administrative con tacts. The chief port of Philadelphia was Kerke in the Memphite nome in which nome Apollonius also possessed a dorea. Pp. 105-121 deal with the provenance of both the Greek and the Egyptian popu lation of Philadelphia. Among the Greeks of different origin, Carians played an important role. As far as possible Cl. tries to establish the place of origin of the Egyptians (free persons as well as serfs) and he has some good remarks on theo phoric names. It seems that most Egyp tians connected with the Arsinoite dorea at Philadelphia originated from the Mem phite nome (71 persons) and relatively few from the Heracleopolite nome (16 persons). Cl. (115) rightly stresses that it would be unwise to draw conclusions based on the uneven distribution of places of origin for the 94 known persons from the Memphite, Arsinoite, Aphroditopolite and Heracleo polite nomes. There are after all several individuals mentioned for whom it is not possible to establish a place of origin. It is impossible to give a detailed ac count of all the smaller and more im portant problems dealt with by the three authors in the course of their main sub ject. For the present reviewer two things came to the fore. First, each author shows tremendous knowledge of his sub ject. This becomes clear, for example, when one realizes the wealth of literature mainly given in the footnotes. However, one should not be astonished that the authors are able to treat their subjects in such a readable and enligthening way. All of them have proven their mastership on the Ptolemaic period by many previous publications. One can only hope that they will be able to continue dealing with it,</page><page sequence="3">L. Morawiecki: Skowronek, Przedstawienia kultowo-religijne na monetach 825 especially now that they may be helped by many recently published Ptolemaic papyri and many more soon to be pub lished. Second, there is a significant tech nical difference between dealing with Egyptian and Greek documents, and thus collaboration between the students of these different disciplines is absolutely necessary for an accurate view of Ptolemaic Egypt. This is not a new view and applies also to the collaboration between Coptic and Arabic and Greek scholars. It should be practised more and more for the benefit of all concerned. Amsterdam P.J.
