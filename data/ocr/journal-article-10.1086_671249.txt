         <p>The picture also represents, but through itself, through the increment of meaning that it brings. But this means that in it what is represented—the “original”—is there more fully, more genuinely, just as it truly is .(Hans-Georg Gadamer, <italic>Truth and Method</italic>, 154)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Sikh religion begins with Guru Nanak (1469–1539). Sikh identity, philosophical ideals, ethical precepts, and daily private and public worship are embedded in his sublime verse. Curiously though, his image does not occupy much significance, so much so that it is even prohibited in sacred precincts. For sure Sikhism is aniconic: its theological singular Divine cannot be imaged; “it cannot be fashioned, it cannot be made” (thapia na jae kita na hoe), proclaimed Guru Nanak (GG, 2).<sup>1</sup> The ten historical Gurus are not understood as divine incarnations. In part, this rejection of the visual reflects long-standing debates in the larger south Asian religious cultural world between the <italic>sargun</italic> and <italic>nirgun</italic>, the embrace of the material of this world (<italic>gun</italic>) in order to represent the divine versus its rejection. The latter stance also finds resonances with the Abrahamic injunction against divine representation found in Islamic contexts. Sikhism positions itself firmly, therefore, against the lavish practice of image worship (<italic>murtis</italic>) in the neighboring Indic traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. According to SGPC (Shromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee) stipulations, images of their historical Gurus should not to be displayed in the presence of their scripture.<sup>2</sup> This prescription has been mirrored in the scholarship on the Sikh tradition, which has tended also to devalue or ignore the physical and the visual.<sup>3</sup> 
      </p>
      <p>But the trepidation about the visual representation of the Gurus is unnecessary. At some level, this anxiety is a manifestation of what the feminist philosopher Elizabeth Grosz diagnoses as “somatophobia,” caused I would say in the Sikh instance by the internalization of centuries-old taboos against the body in patriarchal north India.<sup>4</sup> Somatophobia exacerbated the binary between body/spirit, mind/body, material/transcendent, temporality/eternity, which the Sikh Gurus had repeatedly rejected. Their verse enshrined in the sacred canon celebrates the infinite transcendent within the palpable body, but because of some mental glitch, readers and exegetes are unable to receive its empowering somatic currents. In the epigraph, we hear Guru Nanak say that the divine name (<italic>nam</italic>) is lodged (<italic>nivas</italic>) inside (<italic>andar</italic>) the body (<italic>dehi</italic>). Clearly, any disregard or fear of the <italic>body</italic> goes against Nanak’s <italic>word</italic>. It goes against Sikh ontology, and it even goes against the liturgical praxis, which acknowledges the sacred text as the physical body of the Gurus.</p>
      <p>This essay studies the painted illustrations of Guru Nanak from one of the early manuscripts, the <italic>B-40 Janamsakhi</italic> (dated 1733). I understand these paintings to disrupt that somatophobia by their physical representation of Guru Nanak. My goal is to explore the cognitive and performative function of the Guru’s <italic>body</italic>: what do we learn from his physicality, and what does that knowledge do to us in our own historical and social context?</p>
      <p>Since they frequently set up a stage for his scriptural hymn, the Janamsakhis in fact disclose a symbiotic relationship between the biography of Nanak and his verse. Shortly after his passing away, mythic narratives (<italic>sakhis</italic>) about his birth and life ( <italic>janam</italic>) began to circulate and have since been very popular in the collective Sikh imagination. They have come down in a variety of renditions such as the Bala, Miharban, Adi, and Puratan. Despite the personal loyalties and proclivities of their various authors, the Janamsakhis invariably underscore the importance and uniqueness of Guru Nanak’s birth and life. Their quick and vigorous style lent itself easily to oral circulation and invited their visual rendering. Many of the narratives construct concrete scenes to contextualize Guru Nanak’s universal message. Those that are illustrated evoke lingering emotions through their symphony of colors and compositional elements. According to the leading historian Hew McLeod, Sikh art had its genesis in these Janamsakhis.<sup>5</sup> 
      </p>
      <p>To date, there are no extant portraits of Guru Nanak that would have been done during his lifetime, so we really do not know what he looked like. There is some mention of portraits made of his successors, but so far no authentic works have come to light.<sup>6</sup> In spite of the fact that the <italic>B-40 Janamsakhi</italic> contains illustrations painted two centuries after the passing away of the founder Guru and could not have reproduced his exact features or complexion, the illustrations end up being a hidden treasure for both the community and the academy. In “Materializing Sikh Pasts,” Anne Murphy convincingly argues that scholars need to shift their focus from textual and literary sources in order to rethink history and religion.<sup>7</sup> The <italic>B-40</italic> illustrations extend a visual element to the aural reception of Guru Nanak that I discussed in an earlier work: they render an exciting material quality to his theological and ethical message.<sup>8</sup> As a feminist scholar of the Sikh tradition, I particularly want to examine how these illustrations (1) underscore the finite structures of Sikh metaphysics, (2) locate Guru Nanak within a plurality of bodies, (3) reproduce a sensuous ontology, and (4) reveal the coalescence of poetry and physicality.</p>
      <p>Gadamer’s structural analysis of the “presence” evoked by pictures helps us comprehend the multivalent value of the <italic>B-40</italic> illustrations. He explains that a picture is not just an image and definitely not a copy; its real nature “belongs to the present.”<sup>9</sup> Strategically located between a “sign” and a “symbol,” a picture represents something “through itself, through the increment of meaning that it brings” to the spectator.<sup>10</sup> When we see Guru Nanak located in the continuum of time and space, something actually happens: there is an existential encounter with the founder Guru at one’s present point in life. The incremental meaning of Guru Nanak’s human representation brings about a subjective grasp of core values of the Sikh tradition for the contemporary society and simultaneously shapes and crystallizes them for future generations. From a global perspective, the Sikh Guru interacting dynamically with diverse men, women, and transvestites in a culturally and religiously rich medieval India takes on a unique relevance in a body-disparaging, world-fleeing, we-them polarized society. From a historical perspective, these scenes provide an important documentation of the processes of early Sikh identity formation and construction. Though the Khalsa identity with the five external markers (popularly known as the five <italic>k</italic>’s: <italic>kesha</italic> or uncut hair, <italic>kangha</italic> or comb, <italic>kara</italic> or steel bracelet, <italic>kirpan</italic> or sword, and <italic>kaccha</italic> or long underwear) given during the historic Basiakhi 1699 does not appear in the <italic>B-40</italic> paintings, they do exhibit a strong awareness of religious identities in precolonial Punjab. The symbolic indicators for “Hindu” holy men are distinctly different from the “Muslim” that Guru Nanak is seen conversing with, which should make us reassess the overemphasized role of the colonial machine in the construction of religious boundaries.<sup>11</sup> They also expose the artist’s predilections, for Guru Nanak looks more like the Muslim than the Hindu protagonists. And along with the global and the historical, these pictures have incremental value from a psychological perspective: the profound pleasure radiating from Guru Nanak’s proximity with Muslim sages and companion Mardana could be very therapeutic for the Sikh-Muslim wounds incurred in the horrific Partition of the Punjab in 1947.</p>

         <title>Background</title>
         <p>Named after its accession number at the India Office Library, the <italic>B-40</italic> belongs to the small surviving collection of the early Janamsakhi manuscripts. The first extant Janamsakhi is the Bala, with twenty-nine illustrations dated to 1658 (owned by P. N. Kapoor of New Delhi). The next illustrated extant Janamsakhi collection has forty-two illustrations. It is dated to 1724 and is held by Bhai Sikandar Singh of Bagharian in the Patiala district. The <italic>B-40</italic> manuscript dated 1733 came nine years later. It was compiled by Daia Ram Baol at the request of the patron Sangu Mal, and its likely location is Kapurthala in the Punjab, which makes the <italic>B-40</italic> geographically and historically close to the Bagharian collection.<sup>12</sup> In fact, there is a striking stylistic likeness between them.<sup>13</sup> The <italic>B-40</italic> is considered to be very important because it has extensive historical documentation. It surfaced in Lahore in the nineteenth century and was acquired by the India Office Library in 1907.<sup>14</sup> It has 239 folios, fifteen lines per page in Gurmukhi script, with rubrications in red ink. The name of the illustrator is Alam Chand Raj, which indicates his artisan background. The Raj Mistris (masons and bricklayers) along with the subcaste of Tarkhans (carpenters) have made distinctive contributions to Sikh art and architecture. Wherever sizable and influential communities developed, the familiar Janamsakhi stories were put in easily identifiable forms for them. These happened to be not only in the religious centers in the Punjab like Amritsar, Anandpur, Damdama, but also in Patna in Bihar, where the Tenth Guru was born, and in Nanded in Maharashtra, where he breathed his last. Patrons from these centers commissioned local artists, and, consequently, numerous Janamsakhis were produced in different regions and at different periods.</p>
         <p>This wide dispersion makes the dating and exact place of production difficult to determine for many of them. Nevertheless, it lends a fascinating variation. The first Guru is depicted in the Guler and Kangra styles of northern India, just as he is in the Eastern Murshidabadi or Southern Deccani styles. The artists who painted him were also Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, or Jain, and they presented the Sikh Guru through the lens of their respective religious beliefs. The stories they chose to paint depended on their personal interest, and much was contingent on their individual talent. The paintings from the family workshop of Nainsukh of Guler (1710–78) are especially lauded for their refined work. There are brilliantly subtle. In a classic example, we see Guru Nanak and his companions looking upon an ash-besmeared, scantily clad renunciate asleep on the ground.<sup>15</sup> Through this double gaze upon a figure lying listless on an ochre-colored cloth spread on a tiger skin, the utter futility of renunciation is brought home. The artist displays an ironic contrast not only between the oblivious sleeper and his wide-eyed audience, but also between his lifeless body and the dead tiger’s lively tail that seems to curl up from behind. Despite the differences in style and choice of topics, there is a remarkable similarity among the various illustrators. A creased sheet filled with thumbnail sketches of seventy-four events in Guru Nanak’s life has been discovered, proving the speculation of scholars that templates were in circulation.<sup>16</sup> Though the sketches are extremely minimalist, each episode is numbered, and identified with a brief inscription in Persian and Gurmukhi characters. Such templates would have been used by different groups of painters and scribes to portray Guru Nanak.</p>
         <p>The <italic>B-40</italic> manuscript features a vibrant style and content, which reflect quintessential Sikh ideals. For some reason, however, scholars have not been attracted to its style or to its wholesome perspective. B. N. Goswamy, who has done groundbreaking work in Sikh art and has offered exquisite analyses of some later Janamsakhis, dismisses the <italic>B-40</italic> for its stylistic elements: “The much written about illustrated manuscript, popularly designated as the ‘B-40 Janamsakhi’ is painted in a prosaic, somewhat sterile, style.”<sup>17</sup> Surjit Hans, who pioneered their publication, introduces the illustrations in a typical dualistic framework of the “qualitatively different levels” of <italic>lok</italic> (world) and <italic>parmarth</italic> (transcendental reality).<sup>18</sup> Hans’s volume is greatly appreciated, but his fundamental presumption separates the material world from the transcendental reality—disrupting the corporeal ontology of these early Sikh paintings.</p>
         <p>As a woman born into a Sikh home, I admit I miss some of my favorite episodes of Guru Nanak’s biography in Alam’s constellation. He omits scenes popular in oral transmission such as baby Nanak in the arms of his mother Tripta, a little boy playing with his older sister Nanaki, and a handsome man decked up to marry his bride Sulakhni. Especially endearing are the scenes with the Muslim midwife Daultan and sister Nanaki. Daultan is thrilled at the extraordinary qualities of the newborn Nanak she delivers; Nanaki influences her little brother with her love and companionship. The sister is painted in the Bagharian manuscript, which captures a tender moment of Nanak’s visit with her (we see a flood of emotions as the siblings move to greet each other with their outstretched arms). The female protagonists in Guru Nanak’s life receive their due attention in the series of forty paintings done by the twentieth-century artist Shrimati Phulan Rani for his fifth centennial (1969).<sup>19</sup> Considering that the text of the <italic>B-40</italic> account does not mention Daultan or even Nanaki (who is referred indirectly through her husband Jairam), their absence in Alam’s illustrations is understandable.<sup>20</sup> 
         </p>
         <p>When the Punjabi text names the artist, it uses the verb <italic>likhna</italic> (to write), so it equates painting with writing: “The figures [<italic>surta</italic>] are written [<italic>likhia</italic>] by Alam Chand Raj, the servant of the congregation” (Surta likhia alam chand raj sangat de tehlie). The corporeal figures are perceived as a script, which writes out Sikh ideals and values. In the same vein, Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665), a French painter, says, “just as the twenty-four letters of the alphabet are used to form our words and to express our thoughts, so the forms of the human body are used to express the various passions of the soul and to make visible what is in the mind.”<sup>21</sup> Undoing dualistic perspectives that reduce it to noncognitive matter, these artists across cultures recognize the body as language itself. Spectators are urged to read it closely.</p>
         <p>The illustrations of the <italic>B-40</italic> are done in a stylistic fusion. Along with Alam’s strong Punjabi rural impulse, we can discern the free and imaginative Chaurapnachashika style frequently employed to illustrate Jain and Hindu manuscripts and the charming folk art from the Rajasthani Malwa School, which was a major development in the history of Indian miniature paintings in fifteenth-century India.<sup>22</sup> Alam uses decorative patterns with enormous effect in a wide spectrum of material and aerial colors. Gadamer’s theoretical speculations on art are brought to life in Alam’s work. Each painting in the <italic>B-40</italic> “points by causing us to linger over it, for…its ontological valence consists in not being absolutely different from what it represents but sharing in its being.”<sup>23</sup> In Gadamer’s hermeneutic framework, images are uniquely situated halfway between a sign (pointing-to-something) and a symbol (taking-the-place-of-something). As he explains, their aesthetic experience involves a shift in attention that causes the referential character of the sign to retreat into the background and present something more: “What is represented comes into its own in the picture. It experiences an increase in being.”<sup>24</sup> Gadamer’s reflections incite us to access that “increase in being” produced by the dynamic intermediation between representing and presenting of Guru Nanak’s body. On the one hand, the <italic>B-40</italic> images indicate the historical, social, cultural, and political forces that played out in the biography of the first Sikh Guru; on the other, they evoke multivalent dimensions of meaning—presenting much more than what is represented, something infinite and unrepresentable. What Gadamer says about a picture in general applies to each of the <italic>B-40</italic> Janamsakhi illustrations: the “original” is here, “more fully, more genuinely, just as it truly is.”<sup>25</sup> Four vital themes of the Sikh religion now come into view.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc2">
         <title>Finite Metaphysics</title>
         <p>Guru Nanak is introduced in a realistic manner. Seeing him so makes his words more accessible and concrete. Over the course of Alam’s fifty-seven paintings, he grows from a little boy to a teenager to a dark-bearded youth into the gray-bearded middle-age man and subsequently to a full white-bearded elderly man (<italic>Baba</italic>). Guru Nanak’s physical growth is a sign of an organic and authentic mode of existence in this temporal world. Whether dark, gray, or white, his beard is spherical, and as it combines with his roundish turban, it renders an overall softness to his features. The sequence begins with a seven-year-old going to school (no. 1) and ends with his preparation for his crematory ritual (no. 57). During the course of his life, he communes with nature, gets terribly sick, leaves home, and travels with his Muslim companion Mardana to places far beyond the Punjab, meeting holy men from diverse religious backgrounds. At midpoint, he has a revelation of the singular Divine (no. 28) and continues to share his mystical experience. Toward the end of his life, he passes succession to his disciple Lahina, absorbing him into his own self and renaming him Angad (a limb of his body). In colors and vivid stage settings, we follow his biography and see him enacting his Divine passion and universal vision in this world. For the spectators, the Guru’s relaxed body communicates ease and comfort in their own bodies and with all those around them.</p>
         <p>Throughout, Guru Nanak is depicted in the most normal way: he is not too tall, nor too large, and does not occupy any more space than anybody else. I disagree with the observation that “the area covered by Guru Nanak is always more than any other person.”<sup>26</sup> Guru Nanak’s appearance is a validation and affirmation of the natural human body. The Guru is usually seated or standing on the same plane as other people in common open-air settings. Neither in his youth nor at a later stage do we witness any exaggerated signs of herculean muscle. Missing also are the markers of sovereignty with which later painters have depicted Guru Nanak—a halo around him or a devotee attending reverently to him with a fly whisk. Other saintly iconographic clichés like the water pot (<italic>kamandalu</italic>) by his side, an armrest (<italic>bairangan</italic>) under his left arm, or a book in his hand or in front of him are also missing in the <italic>B-40</italic> Janamsakhi renditions. These early paintings do not rely on such external deployments. With their colors, space, perspective, and gestures, Alam’s compositions subtly reveal Guru Nanak as a dynamic intersection between a historical person and timeless reality.</p>
         <p>In the entire collection, the Guru is the only figure in a three-quarter-view perspective. With the exception of Bhagat Kabir and an occasional male or female belonging to a cluster (perhaps to create an artistic variation within the group?),<sup>27</sup> Alam’s protagonists are in profile. Without overpowering us with the Guru’s frontality, he produces a unique perspective of Guru Nanak as a three-dimensional figure. Guru Nanak’s simple pose, whether standing, sitting, or lying down, and his gentle gestures, addressing people from various strata of society and personal orientation, spell out his intrinsic sensitivity and strength. As we see robbers and demons and religious leaders bow before him, we can feel tremendous force exuding from this sagelike reservoir of spiritual wisdom and personal peace. He fights no battles. He shows no anger. He is not dramatic. No matter what the setting may be, there is a perpetual calm and at-homeness in the world about him. Most often there is a lush tree above and, beside him, in simple profile view, his Muslim companion, the musician Mardana playing his rebec. Guru Nanak’s proximity with Islam and melodious vibrations is important to the artist, and they are effectively conveyed.</p>
         <p>Alam utilizes Guru Nanak’s attire as another marker of his spiritual identity. Again, his clothes may not be fancy in their fabric, but their design discloses his respect for his own body and elicits the same response from his viewers. In fact, the very first illustration tellingly establishes his inner authority and self-assurance (see fig. 1). The little boy on his first day at school wears a yellow full-sleeved robe coming down to his ankles, with an elegant reddish sash neatly tied around his waist and a matching turban over his head. The <italic>chooridar</italic> (literally “bracelet forming”) trousers peep out from below his robe, as do his curly locks from the turban on either side of his face. It is a most endearing portrait. Guru Nanak’s formal dress and upright demeanor are markedly different from the rest of the kids who are meagerly dressed and romping around. The turban customarily donned by Mughal princes, Sufi saints, and Rajput nobility imparts to Guru Nanak a maturity beyond his years. He confidently greets his mustached teacher dressed in the typical upper-caste Brahmin outfit of a pleated dhoti tucked around his waist with one end draping from his right shoulder down his bare chest. Caught at the liminal threshold between “home” and “society”—behind him stands his father and across sits his teacher on a pedestal with food and books—little Nanak displays phenomenal dignity.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Though the color of his robe changes from a golden yellow sometimes to white (nos. 6, 10, 29) or blue (nos. 8, 23, 30, 50), triggering change in the other color combinations, the red and green turban with yellow designs remains the same. The only exception is the white and black rather “postmodern” outfit (no. 45).<sup>28</sup> Unlike his other harmoniously flowing robes, this is short and half-sleeved; its black shirt has a V-neck with double white stripes at the trim that cut across Guru Nanak’s chest. From the waist down to his knees is a dhoti-like white outfit. Self-referential in its style to begin with, the stark black and white contrast is jarring to the eyes, and the sweeping diagonals spell a sense of fragmentation. What makes Guru Nanak’s outfit even more odd is that, in this case, the text describes him wearing a heavy long loose brown shirt, with a shawl around him, and sashes.<sup>29</sup> 
         </p>
         <p>His wide sash (<italic>kamarband</italic>) in number 1 is quickly replaced by a narrower and simpler version, more in tune with his normal everyday routine. It is quite likely that the artist wanted to convey the pride of parents who decked their only son with that ornamental sash for his first day at school. As he grows up, the style of his turban alters as well: the canonical shape in the first few pictures gives way to a roundish headgear, resembling that of Sufi sages. Except when he is ill (no. 4) or is bathing himself (no. 56), Guru Nanak always has his turban on.</p>
         <p>And except when he is asleep (no. 3) or bathes (no. 56), the Guru is invariably fully clothed (see fig. 2). Thus, he appears as an antithesis to several of his scantily dressed and shaven-head Yogi and Nath contemporaries (nos. 20, 23, 27, 44, 45, 46, and 57). As a sign of mastering their sexuality or the death of their bodies, ascetics from different religious traditions opted to wear little on their bodies, and many smeared themselves with ash. When Alam shows Guru Nanak’s robes flowing down to his ankles, they make the strips tightly covering the genitals of the mendicants beside him appear even skimpier. The example of the Digambara Jains, who for centuries have literally been “sky-clad,” is loudly denounced in Sikh scripture. Not those “who take off their clothes and go naked like Digambaras” (GG, 1169), but she who “wears the clothes of Love” (GG, 54) is prized. The Guru’s turban and robe are signs of his bodily sensations and active participation in the normal routine of life. His colorful outfits painted by Alam materially substantiate the textual verse: rather than “smear the bodies with ashes, renounce clothes, and go naked” (tani bhasam lagai bastar chodhi tani naganu bhaia) (GG, 1127), we must “wear the outfit of divine honor and never go naked” (painana rakhi pati parmesur phir nage nahi thivana) (GG, 1019).<sup>30</sup>

         <p>At times, Guru Nanak wears Punjabi <italic>jutti</italic>-style shoes, and quite attractive ones, too (nos. 5, 8, 9, and 19). His black  <italic>juttis</italic> with white daisies are especially noteworthy (no. 19). The Sikh Guru is very much in sync with the cultural trends and mores of his time. Overall, Guru Nanak’s appearance and gear reveal his affirmation of being in this world. These outward modes express his care and cultivation of his self within a sociopolitical context. Guru Nanak is not some static representation belonging to eternity; from his childhood to old age, we see a lively participant engaging meaningfully within the fluctuations of time.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc3">
         <title>Plurality of Bodies</title>
         <p>As Alam illustrates, the Sikh Guru traveling to distant places and meeting with people of different faiths and ethnicities shows the human body in its rich diversity. Over and again, we encounter Guru Nanak engaged in discourse with important historical figures popular in the Punjab, such as Shah Abdul Rahman, Hajji Rattan, Sheikh Braham, Bhagat Kabir, Gorakhnath, and Sheikh Sharaf. He meets with many other Sufis, saints, Siddhas, Naths, and with Kala, the god of death, as well. In his attempt to reproduce the Janamsakhi thrust, the artist depicts Guru Nanak as a genuine pluralist who does not simply accept or tolerate diversity but courageously reaches out to others.</p>
         <p>In his encounters, there is no impulse to convert, and there is no acrimony toward other religious leaders. Mutual respect and joy come through in the paintings, as though the discussants seated serenely were discovering some exciting new horizon. Alam’s brushstrokes transmit the Guru’s corporeality as the force that intensifies every<italic>body</italic> he meets. If we see Shah Abdul Rahman sitting with him in a rosy pink outfit amid flora and fauna (no. 7; see fig. 3), it is because the Sufi saint has absorbed Guru Nanak’s radiance. According to the Janamsakhi text, when Shah Abdul Rahman’s disciple comments on his flushed body, the saint replies: “Today I met with Khuda’s ruby” (Ajju khudai ka lal milia) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 43–44). The term “lal” denotes the color red or radiance or ruby or a lover. The encounter is complex: there is the initial seeing, which produces an immediate insight into the Sikh Guru as a radiance/lover/ruby of Khuda for the Muslim saint, transforming him into a passionate pink. That the body is the cause, the medium, and the result of their cognitive and spiritual experience is as effectively expressed as the Cartesian dualism is erased.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Other cross-religious encounters would be more difficult for the artist to present on his canvas. According to the Janamsakhi narratives, when the pluralist Guru Nanak met with people, he urged them to be self-critical so they would know about and live in tune with the fundamentals of their respective religion. Alam tries to relay this message in number 13. He portrays the Muslim saint Shah Rukandi sitting at the entry of a square structure while the Guru faces him. The architectural configuration with arabesques indicates its Islamic origins, but its darkness, against which Shah Rukandi is seated in a sapphire-blue robe with floral designs, renders a hidden interiority. The contrast could be Alam’s painterly attempt to write out Guru Nanak’s message that the saint be fully enlightened about his Islamic background and integrate his interior self with his exterior self.</p>
         <p>Some scenes, like the Guru meeting Hajji Rattan in number 14 (a very popular saint in the Bathinda region of the Punjab), would be impossible to depict materially. How could Alam ever paint the literary trope of “water merging with water”? At times, one wishes that he had been more literal in his visual translation, for when Guru Nanak meets with Sheikh Braham: “Then they kissed each other’s hand and sat down” (Tab in uno dast bosi kar kai bahi gae) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 66). Instead of zooming in on their exchange of kiss, which would have been relatively easy to depict, Alam shows the two spiritual figures seated together amid the sounds of Mardana’s music and the sight of the birds flying around (no. 15). So no matter what, through his bright colors and simple designs, Alam consistently succeeds in creating a joyous mood that replays the pleasures and corporeal sensations of the Sikh Guru’s encounter with Muslim saints.</p>
         <p>His illustration of the Guru with Bhagat Kabir (no. 31; see fig. 4), the leading Nirguna Sant of northern India, evokes quite a different aesthetic. Rather than the surroundings of nature, the two figures in this composition are much larger. Both are sitting on par with each other. Unlike the Muslim saints who wore different shades of blue (with the exception of Shah Abdul Rahman in pink), Bhagat Kabir is dressed in dazzling silver white. Does the artist intend to signify his <italic>sattva</italic> qualities? The Guru, on the right, is in golden yellow. Both are in three-quarter profile. Both must be around the same age, for Bhagat Kabir’s white mustache (no beard, whereas the Sufi saints invariably are portrayed with beards) parallels the Guru’s white beard. Bhagat Kabir commands great respect, especially with the mysterious whiteness around his eyes. Nevertheless, his face bent downward with his slanting mustache implies the Bhagat’s deference toward the Guru, who faces him straight across. Mardana, from the lower left of the composition, has his neck stretched up and eyes wide open to look at the figure quietly dominating the scene. The aim of the Janamsakhis is to portray the greatness of Guru Nanak, and as they do so, they fully project the respect and affection Guru Nanak has for other religious figures. Alam accomplishes their objective through his simple yet subtle language of the body.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>He also portrays Guru Nanak traveling hazardous terrains to meet and visit holy people and their sacred places in Kashmir, Achal Batala, Mecca, and Baghdad. Guru Nanak’s geographical journeys parallel his inner search. There is a curiosity in him to know about the foreign and familiarize himself with the distant, the other. In number 20 (see fig. 5), Guru Nanak is pictured with Nath yogis sitting on top of Mount Sumeru. Their shaved heads, lengthened ear lobes, and long earrings (<italic>kan-phat</italic>, “ear split”) signal their rigorous Hatha yoga practices and ascetic ideals. These figures impressed the medieval Indian imagination, for they are widely present in the art and literature of the Muslims too. A memorable scene from a Mughal album on exhibit at the Chester Beatty has a Kanphat yogi sitting with a dog—its devotion to his master being analogous to the yogi’s for Shiva. In the <italic>B-40</italic> illustrations, we do not get the sense of the Kanphat yogis as the exotic “others”; rather, they appear as significant holy men with whom Guru Nanak seeks to engage in serious conversation. In Alam’s composition, the group of shaven-headed yogis is sitting securely together, while the Guru is on the side—standing on the edge of the mountain, accompanied only by Mardana. A dark-bearded Guru Nanak has almost made it to the mountaintop. Even in his precarious locus, the young itinerant seems to have resolved to enter into the circle of these venerable Naths. Alam brings home the point that pluralistic ventures require tremendous courage and initiative; it is not easy to enter into somebody else’s ideological and geographical space.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>In number 46, Alam shows Guru Nanak interacting with a group of ascetics who appear to have a different lifestyle, corporeal insignia, and spiritual practices from the Naths. They too are “outside” society, but they are longhaired, they have buns atop their heads, they have long flowing beards, and some can be seen entering a body of water. The text describes the water in this Himalayan region as icy cold, with many of the ascetics dying after being dipped into it. To borrow the term from religious studies scholar Patrick Olivelle, these ascetics are engaged in the process of “deconstructing” their bodies.<sup>31</sup> The visiting Guru miraculously makes the water pleasantly lukewarm so the sanyasis can comfortably bathe themselves, and with his cupped hands gives out rice, ghi, and sugar to feed their famished bodies. Instead of deconstructing, Guru Nanak urges them to nurture their bodies and participate in the natural, social, and cosmic processes. What is particularly interesting in Alam’s rendition is the presence of a female sitting next to a male sanyasi across from Guru Nanak. The Janamsakhi text does not mention any woman. Seeing her wholesome figure on Alam’s canvas—with her long hair coming down to her waist, dressed in a pink garment and pretty earrings, and holding a mala in hands joined together in emotional and spiritual energy—reinforces Nanak’s emphasis on the corporeal richness of human existence.</p>
         <p>In illustration number 16, Guru Nanak is seen with yet another type of ascetics, the fakirs who go begging for food. This composition is vertically split in two segments. In the upper, Guru Nanak is seated in his typical pose under a tree, with Mardana across from him playing the rebab. But close behind the Guru is a group of men crouched together, and as these four disappear into the border, they leave the spectator with the sense that there are many more of them. In the lower perspective is a very different set of bodies. There are two musicians elegantly dressed in long robes and sashes standing on either side of the frame; one holds the rebab, and the other the cymbals. Between them are two distinctive figures in pajama-trousers (not <italic>chooridars</italic>) dominating the scene. Their youthful chests are bare, and they have narrow bands wrapped around their heads. They occupy extensive space as they flaunt their robust bodies in vigorous dance, with their arms excitedly in the air. Holding these two scenes together is a mosque in the far background, and in spite of the distance, its four minarets are clearly visible.</p>
         <p>The narrative is about the Guru in Saidpur, where the Pathans are celebrating merrily at a wedding party, utterly oblivious to the group of starving fakirs beside the Guru. Babur had sacked the town of Saidpur when he crossed the river Indus in 1520 (it was subsequently rebuilt by Akbar and renamed Eminabad). The Janamsakhi sets up the context for Guru Nanak’s hymn in which he bitterly twists the metaphor of a wedding procession to describe Babur’s brutal incursion that destroyed the Muslim Lodi Sultans, along with the Hindu and Muslim masses (GG, 722).<sup>32</sup> (Babur, in his autobiography, recounts his procession of warriors coming down from Afghanistan in a wedding-like festive mood as well.)<sup>33</sup> Alam’s painting poignantly catches the contrast between the local victims feebly huddled with the Guru and the ethnically and socially superior foreign victors from the North-West Frontier and Afghanistan region engrossed in song and dance. Along with the visual, there are sonic differences: while Mardana’s rebab raises empathy and human connections, the rebab and cymbals in the lower frame promote selfish indulgence. That the Guru’s melodious word connected people across religions, cultures, professions, and societal hegemonies is the central message of the Janamsakhi text. Its penultimate sentence is a breathless account of the variety of men and women who are attracted to Guru Nanak’s rhyme and rejoice in his presence: “Hindus, Muslims, yogis, sanyasis, brahmcaris, ascetics, ascetic leaders, sky-clad Jains, Vaishnavas, celibates, householders, wandering mendicants, nobles, chiefs, aristocrats, officials, agriculturalists, proprietors” (Hindu musalman jogi saniyasi brahmchari tapi tapisaru digambar baisno udasi grihasti bairagi khan khaneen umrao karori jimindaru bhumia) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 75). The way Alam paints the group of wandering ascetics—two quite dark-skinned and two quite light—all of them so closely nestled to the Sikh Guru, touchingly conveys the textual theme of the plurality of “bodies” drawn to Guru Nanak. Viewers are left with the hope that the resounding melodies from Mardana’s rebab will reach the dancers and make them aware of the plight of others.</p>
         <p>Another intriguing illustration is that of Guru Nanak in conversation with the Sufi Sheikh Sharaf (no. 50; see fig. 6). This celebrated figure in the Punjab lived two centuries before Guru Nanak. In Alam’s painting, he is a young black-bearded saint ornately dressed like a woman with all her feminine accouterment. In both content and form, it is a fascinating scene. The background with single-, double-storied, and some even triple-storied buildings, and a fluted dome reaching up into the skies, gives the impression of an urbanized Muslim town (identified as Baghdad in the text). The balconies and windows are intricately latticed, and the walls are decorated with colorful arabesques. On a closer look, we get a side view of a mosque set in a compound with its entrance opening up to the right. Its latticed window repeats the pattern of those far in the distance, exhibiting the genius of Islamic art—the conversion of stone into lace. With the dome of the mosque receding into the left horizon and the branches of a vibrant bush across from it into the right, the eye is left wandering beyond both borders. This bush in the compound of the mosque has been rendered realistically, for we can spot eight different birds sitting in a circle on its distinct branches and leaves. Quite unfamiliar in Alam’s repertoire of abstract foliage, it immediately evokes the proverbial <italic>Conference of the Birds</italic> by the Muslim mystic Farid ud-Din Attar. Rows of tiny shrubs, brownish-pink rocks, and sprightly flowers run parallel to the mosque and the discoursing birds.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Against this backdrop charged with Islamic aesthetics, the blue-robed Guru and the bridelike bearded Sufi are having their own discourse. They are sitting across from each other on their knees on the green grass. The bridal image has of course been a popular literary trope on the Indian subcontinent. The male Sufis, Bhagats, and Sikh Gurus have abundantly appropriated the feminine tone, psyche, and syntax to express their spiritual yearning. So pervasive is this motif that in Indian Sufism, the male devotee in classical Persian Sufi literature is recast as a female. But to literally see that poetic motif is quite something else. By choosing to paint the narrative of a transvestite with the outward signifiers of feminine embellishment, clothing, and jewels, Alam boldly questions socially constructed gender paradigms.</p>
         <p>The <italic>B-40</italic> text specifies that Sheikh Sharaf is wearing the conventional “sixteen” adornments, including henna, black collyrium in his eyes, and fancy garments, all very visible to the naked eye. Others like bathing, anointing with sandalwood, and eating pan among the conventional “sixteen” can only be assumed. What is strikingly visible in Alam’s scene is the jewelry bedecking the saint’s body. Drawing upon the useful <italic>Ain I Akbari</italic>, the detailed sixteenth-century record of Emperor Akbar’s reign by his Prime Minister Abul Fazl-I-Allami, we can identify quite a few items. There is the marigold-shaped <italic>binduli</italic> ornament on the Sheikh’s forehead, the pearl <italic>mang</italic> worn in the parting of his dark hair, and the marigold (matching the forehead ornament) <italic>karnphul</italic> (ear flower) as a part of the pearl <italic>khuntial</italic> (earring tapering in shape). Around his neck is the <italic>guluband</italic>, a choker consisting of several rose-shaped buttons of gold strung onto silk, and the <italic>har</italic>, a necklace of strings of pearls that glides down to his waist. His arm is full of bracelets, but Abul Fazl’s distinctions between the <italic>kangan</italic> (bracelet), the <italic>gajrah</italic> (bracelet made of gold and pearls), and the <italic>chur</italic> (bracelet worn above the wrist) are hard to make.<sup>34</sup> The Sheikh’s crimson scarf embracing his bearded face and upper body is drawn back just enough to show his elaborate ornaments.</p>
         <p>His image may disturb some, but the Guru is utterly unruffled. Actually nothing seems out of joint in this picture. The live marigolds and daisies are reproduced on the Sheikh’s scarf and jewelry, creating an intimacy between his embodied self and surrounding nature. As the two figures face each other, the rosary in the Guru’s stretched hand appears right in the middle. This rhythmic circle of beads horizontally reaches out to unite them, as well as vertically to the three roselike flowers and higher to the five daisies and still higher up to the mosque and finally to the houses and buildings in the distance. The overflowing artistic rhythm and the lack of anxiety on the Guru’s face visually spell out the textual question: “Baba asked the Sheikh, what is all this dressing up for?” (Babe puchia sekha eh kia saag kita hi) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 139). Alam’s illustration is fraught with the issues of sex and gender. Did the Sheikh see himself as a woman? Was his notion of the self in fact feminine? Was he simply following a prescribed gender ideology or was the Sufi saint in touch with his unique individuality? According to the text, the saint replies that he wanted to please God and did whatever he could to win him. The Guru then instructs that the Divine is won only with truth and adoring love. He does not put down the Sheikh for cross-dressing. In fact, he invites him to sing <italic>ghazals</italic>, for which he was renowned, and the Sheikh acquiesces by singing beautifully on the theme of love. The Guru looks upon him, and as the story ends, the saint’s agony is transformed into bliss. Especially interesting is that Sheikh Sharaf, like Shah Abdul Rahman in number 7, palpably feels the impact of Guru Nanak’s sight: “With Babaji’s look upon him, the Sheikh’s sight turned divine. His every pore became ecstatic. Inside every outfit, behind every burqa, he saw the Divine!” (Babeji di najari bhar dekhne nal sekh tai drib drist hoi gai / rom rom daru divaru masatu hoi gaia / hari jame andar har burqe andar brahm hi paia najar avai) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 140–41). The terms <italic>jama</italic> and <italic>burqa</italic> evoke the human body and bring to mind figures of <italic>jama</italic>-wearing men and <italic>burqa</italic>-wearing women. Physically touched by Guru Nanak’s visual pulsations, each and every hair of the Sufi saint literally stands erect in joy, and he begins to see the metaphysical Being in every corporeal figure.<sup>35</sup> 
         </p>
         <p>That there be total synchronicity between the internal self and the external self is the moral of the narrative—both in the text and in Alam’s perceptive pictorial rendition. Without the experience of authentic selfhood wearing too little or too much, dressing up in the masculine garb or in the feminine is utterly futile. Dressed in tune with his psychological being, Guru Nanak brings attention to the human body. In his words cited both in the <italic>B-40</italic> Janamsakhi and in the Guru Granth, the color red is the color of passion for the divine name, white is the color of truth and charity, and blue removes the stain of falsehood. The Guru even defines the robe he wears as being stitched with devotion, and the texture of the sash tied around him as spiritual contentment (GG, 16). Alam triumphs in illustrating the Guru’s garments and accessories as sensuous appearances of his emotional and spiritual values. In turn, spectators are challenged to think about their subjectivity. Do we simply follow conventional prescriptions? Are we enslaved to glossy fashion advertisements? For the Sikhs in particular, Alam’s images inspire a deeper communion with the five <italic>k</italic>’s they wear as part of their religious identity. His painting of Guru Nanak comfortably conversing with Sheikh Sharaf is popular with the group of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Sikhs as visual evidence that the progressive Guru Nanak did not condemn cross-dressing or same-sex relationships.<sup>36</sup> Alam’s scenes have great relevance, and if their visceral impact were to reach wider audiences, there could be a real shift in the oppressive paradigms dominating contemporary society.</p>
         <p>The artist evokes Guru Nanak’s human personality that transcended religious stereotypes current in his milieu. He accomplishes it by utilizing disparate motifs of the <italic>tilak</italic> and the <italic>seli</italic>: the Guru almost always has a vertical red <italic>tilak</italic> mark on his forehead, just as he has a woolen cord, <italic>seli</italic>, slung across his left shoulder coming down to his right waist. Explained by Gadamer, “What makes a motif is that it has unity in a convincing way and that the artist has carried through this unity as the unity of meaning, just as the viewer understands it as a unity.”<sup>37</sup> Evidently, the bright red line between the Guru’s dark eyes or the dark semicircle sinuously clinging to his yellow robe are not mere art designs: the <italic>tilak</italic> is saturated with the holiness of the Vaishnava Hindus; the <italic>seli</italic> with the devotion of the Muslim Sufis. Each has enormous unity of meaning for its specific community, and the artist brings them together on the Sikh Guru’s body to project his inclusive personality. (The Muslim Mardana is also painted with the <italic>tilak</italic>.) Alam’s motifs from two different traditions do not reproduce some sort of a composite or a hybrid model; rather, they convincingly convey to the viewer a figure beyond the either-or religious categories prevalent in medieval India. As we travel with Guru Nanak in his multi-ethnic, multireligious, and multicultural cosmos, we become sensitive to the multifaceted sensory richness of human existence and begin to realize that there is no single model of the body that dominates. As a result of Guru Nanak’s personal experience, the Sikh canon contains not only the verses of their Gurus but also those of Hindu and Muslim holy men belonging to different centuries, different social classes, and different regions and cultures.</p>

         <title>Sensuous Ontology</title>
         <p>Alam depicts Guru Nanak’s revelation (no. 28; see fig. 7), which in Sikh public memory is the starting point of their religion. As we discover, this mystical moment is not something abstract or static but a sensuous experience of the transcendent Divine. The unique theology and praxis of Sikhism arise from this sensuous ontology of Guru Nanak.<fig id="fg7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The Guru is positioned standing in the middle of a panoramic view. Trees and shrubs in a round horizon stretch into infinity, and bunches of little colorful flowers pop up all over the green grass. Bhai Mardana’s curled fingers spell out the vigor with which he is striking his rebab, making us see melodious sound waves bursting in the air. In this visually and aurally rich scene, Guru Nanak’s hands—with a rosary—are joined together in homage and reach above him. His face is tilted. Extending both below and above, it is an intriguing multidimensional perspective. According to the written text, “baba nanak” is endowed with Guruship in this “divine palace of the formless One” (baba nanak nrinakar de mahil vic) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 100). Evidently, the palace of the formless One is no different from this world of ours. The figure of the bird in the tree echoes Guru Nanak’s human body. The Guru appears in total ecstasy. With his eyes half-closed, his lips in a smile, he stands (<italic>stasis</italic>) outside of himself (<italic>ec</italic>), a perfect intersection of the physical and the spiritual spheres. Guru Nanak’s numinous experience is with and through his own body. His fluid emotional state corresponds with the expansive circular landscape. Demarcations between mind and body, individual body and the bodies of others, <italic>lok</italic> (world) and <italic>parmarth</italic> (transcendental reality), are totally obliterated. Without seeing the Divine in any form—whether physical or cosmic—Guru Nanak appears to feel the formless One pulsate in each and every form. His vision of the singular infinite formless Divine, his moral impulse to connect with everybody around him, and his heightened sensuousness constitute Guru Nanak’s revelation. Captured perfectly by the painter, these currents subsequently crystallized into Sikh metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics.</p>
         <p>But preceding this ecstatic moment was a long and arduous process of solitude, self-reflection, and psychological turmoil. In that traumatic period, Nanak does not seek out any Sant or Nath or Sufi master: Alam shows him communing in nature, all by himself, his body in the throes of incubating a new Reality (nos. 2 and 3). “Nanak visited by a physician” (no. 4; see fig. 8) is particularly effective in conveying his angst. Unlike his harmonious and expansive appearance in number 28, Nanak here is all scrunched up. He is sitting in the interior world of his home, which in the typical Malwa School of painting is pictorially compartmentalized. He is not wearing his turban, and his left hand languidly touches the ground beside his left foot. A very attractive woman (his mother?) sits behind him. Her revealing red outfit, heavy jewels, and striking pose are quite incongruous with Nanak’s sick demeanor. (In the literary version, his wife is anxious about his ongoing sickness and stridently asks the family to call in for a doctor. In the illustration, Nanak appears younger than the lady seated behind him, which suggests that the painter decided to depict a youthful mother Tripta and not wife Sulakhni.) A dark-complexioned mustached physician (looks much like the teacher in no. 1) kneels across from him. He attentively holds the youngster’s right wrist (very fair in contrast with his own) to diagnose his fever-stricken body. And though a peacock struts on the roof, and birds and fruit enliven the landscape, Nanak is not in sync with it. If anything, its nocturnal slate-blue backdrop illuminates the darkness of his spirit. Unlike the sweeping circular horizon in number 28, the angular architecture of number 4 draws up chasms and segregations. The white pillar stands between Nanak and his mother, the threshold separates him from the doctor, and the orange wall with its elaborate molding cuts through the composition.<fig id="fg8" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Alam’s disjointed iconography is the perfect setting for Guru Nanak’s poetically charged verse quoted in the Guru Granth, “the naive physician does not know that the pain lies in the liver” (bhola vaidu na janai karak kaleje mahi) (GG, 1279). In the Punjabi idiom, <italic>kaleja</italic> (liver) is the emotional, moral, and spiritual core of the human being. Whereas the physician with his scientific training fails, his mother pictured with her chin up and confidently raised left hand sees through her son’s biological organ and recognizes his spiritual disease. That the transcendent is not up above or beyond to be accessed by the mind or disembodied soul, but rather painfully felt by Guru Nanak in the recesses of his visceral organ so crucial to bodily functions, is profoundly illustrated. The scene testifies to Guru Nanak’s personal psychic trauma, a trauma that sets him on his spiritual journey, which ultimately leads to his divine revelation (no. 28). Subsequently, he shares his divine enchantment, and people attracted by his universal message and simple style start following him, calling themselves “Sikhs,” a Punjabi word that means “disciple” or “seeker” (Sanskrit <italic>shishya</italic>; Pali <italic>sekha</italic>).</p>
         <p>In almost all of his adult images, he has in his hand a simple circle of beads on a string, which ends in a tassel. The “rosary” is a widespread and enduring article. For men and women across cultures and centuries, the touch of the circular beads creates a synergy with their mental currents. In Guru Nanak’s immediate historical and geographical context, different Indic groups used specific types of <italic>malas.</italic> For example, the <italic>rudraksa mala</italic>, made up of thirty-two berries (or its double, sixty-four) from the special Rudraksa tree, was used for meditation on Shiva; the <italic>tulsi mala</italic>, with 108 beads made from the wood of the sacred Tulsi shrub, was used for the worship of Vishnu and Rama.<sup>38</sup> Similarly, the <italic>tasbih</italic>, with its ninety-nine beads, was popular among the Sufis for exalting the ninety-nine names of Allah. Actually, these three types are mentioned in Sikh scripture. Guru Nanak’s rosaries that we see in the <italic>B-40</italic> vary in color, material, and size. Some are black, some white. Their performance varies too: sometimes the Guru holds it in his right hand, sometimes in his left, sometimes with both hands, and sometimes he holds two rosaries simultaneously—one in each hand (nos. 8 and 9). The variations suggest that he does not uphold any established religious norms, and since it is almost always in the Guru’s hand—even when he is animatedly conversing—it is something other than an instrument for meditational practices. In fact, when he is pictured with them in both his hands, he is encountering the demon (no. 8) and the robber (no. 9), which indicates that the rosary functioned as the Guru’s weapon against evil forces.</p>
         <p>Alam’s varied depictions uniformly convey the profound sensuousness with which Guru Nanak embraces the artefact. In illustration number 28, we can literally see numinous joy pouring out from his fingers and palms, touching the circle of stringed white beads as he stands in the palace of the formless One. The circle in the center of Alam’s composition sends the mind reeling into infinity. We see no Being, and yet the sheer reverence with which Guru Nanak’s rosary reaches out to welcome evokes an awesome presence. In the language of colors, Alam writes down the Sikh liturgical verse: “the entire world is beaded on your thread” (sagal samagri tumrai sutar dhari) (GG, 268). On Guru Nanak’s rosary, the temporal and eternal, human and divine, finite and infinite hang together, giving us a glimpse of the variegated universe beaded upon the singular thread. Guru Nanak’s ethical message—the equality of class, caste, creed, race, and gender—is perfectly visible.</p>
         <p>Another item is the little white daisy in his right hand (no. 39), and the Guru appears to be fully absorbed in enjoying its fragrance. According to the long narrative, the Guru travels beyond Kashmir and is turned into a boy by a Rohila Pathan and sold several times over. A great deal of drama takes place in the text, but the painter chooses to focus simply on the aesthete par excellence smelling the flower sitting up on a hillock amid birds and flowers. A contemporary spectator can read here a visual hermeneutics of Guru Nanak’s verse recorded in scripture: “Only the relisher of fragrance can recognize the flower” (Rasia hovai musk ka tab phul pachanai) (GG, 725). Since the complex process of recognition ( <italic>pachanai</italic>) requires a physical act as well as a cognitive realization, the body with its sensuous experience is exalted as the conduit for metaphysical knowledge. In Alam’s artistic script, we discover the Sikh Guru fostering aesthetics as the approach to knowledge and spirituality. He comes across very different from Plato, who regarded the essence, the formlessness of a rose to be real, and all those that could be seen, smelled, or touched, merely mutable, temporary, and unreal. Guru Nanak so absorbed in the daisy—one among the many in the picture—validates the reality of all of them; his gesture points viewers to a universal force permeating each of those particular daisies, every bit in this world. In fact, the melodious sound from Mardana’s rebab on the lower right appears to float toward the flower in the Guru’s hand and augment its beauty and fragrance. The abounding smells and sounds and sights raise immediate awareness of a boundless pattern, confirming Gadamer’s theory, “An aesthetic Erlebnis always contains the experience of an infinite whole.”<sup>39</sup> No wonder Alam portrays the second Guru also enjoying the fragrance of a flower (no. 21).</p>

      <sec id="sc5">
         <title>Poetic Body</title>
         <p>Alam makes visible the invisible confluence of sublime poetry and Guru Nanak’s physical body. As we noted at the outset, many of the scenes are created by the Janamsakhi composers to contextualize the Guru’s verse. But interestingly, even the Guru’s figure and his concrete attributes are made of poetic materials. To begin with, the wooden board (no. 1) with a tiny handle carried on Nanak’s first day to school is a metonymic marker that its holder would write up a new morality. The reverence with which the seven-year-old carries it with both hands joined is strikingly reminiscent of the rosary in number 28. But whereas the rosary appears to be a delicate offering to the Divine, the board is held tightly from below—at a 45-degree angle, toward his own body. Sandwiched between the patriarchal world of his father and the upper-caste Brahmin teacher, the boy’s tight hold of the writing board foreshadows his “semiotic” script. The feminist philosopher of language Julia Kristeva describes “semiotic” as the maternal basis of language—its sounds, cadences, tones, and rhythms. Kristeva distinguishes this primordial modality from the “symbolic,” which she defines as the male construction and codification of language.<sup>40</sup> Her analysis has been very useful to understanding the semiotic nature of the Sikh sacred text.<sup>41</sup> When Guru Nanak envisioned the formless One, he burst into poetry. Without succumbing to the male symbolic governed by its linguistic, grammatical, and rational laws, his sublime utterances came with a gusty speed in a most natural momentum and took on artistic designs with alliteration, assonance, and consonance. The wooden board clutched by the little boy in <italic>B-40</italic>, Janamsakhi’s first illustration, would inscribe his somatic response to the Infinite and eventually concretize into the 1,430-page Sikh scripture the Guru Granth. Alam’s depiction of the youngster’s grip reveals the intrinsic bond between Sikh sacred text and Guru Nanak’s corporeal matrices.</p>
         <p>Another item in the Guru’s hand is difficult to detect at the outset (no. 6; see fig. 9), but looking at the full picture we realize it is a piece of fabric, used for food covering. It has to be thin muslin because the Guru’s palm can be seen through it. The text describes the Guru and Mardana returning to the Punjab after twelve years of travel. When Mardana goes to visit his home, Guru Nanak’s parents follow him to the spot where Guru Nanak is seated under a tree on a rectangular piece of cloth. Alam paints the parents in profile facing their son. Following the Punjabi sociocultural norms, they must have brought those two large platters of goodies to welcome their son that we see placed in front of him on either side. The one farther is smaller, creating an illusion of space. The round saffron <italic>ladoos</italic> and white squares of <italic>barfi</italic> so neatly arranged are apt to make any Punjabi viewer’s mouth water. The gooey sweets on the Guru’s left are partially covered by cloth—probably to keep bugs away. Those on his right are uncovered, and it is their covering we see in the Guru’s right hand. Alam’s brush captures the Guru’s gesture in motion—he is lifting off the cover from the sweets in a most inviting manner. The parents greet their spiritually exalted son, and he in turn greets the audience to partake of those delicious sweets while being cognizant of the transcendent Infinite saturating the wondrous landscape. The joyous scene sumptuously affirms the unity of spiritual and digestive processes, recalling the Guru’s wish that the Divine be remembered in every “morsel of food” (<italic>sas gras</italic>) (GG, 961). Alimentary canals are considered elementary to spiritual progress throughout Sikh scripture. Body and spirit are not binaries, and spiritual knowledge is not to be confined to the realm of Plato’s philosopher-king or the Brahmins of Vedic India. The delicate transparent text(ural) coverings and the covered delicacies are made of the same material. The saffron <italic>ladoos</italic> in the middle of Alam’s composition delightfully replay in the designs on Mother Tripta’s large full <italic>dupatta</italic>, on Guru Nanak’s turban, and on the sashes of Father Kalu and Bhai Mardana. Altogether, the festive platters create visual links among the four figures and feed us with positive associations for eating and learning.<fig id="fg9" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         </p>
         <p>Furthermore, there is a material transference of the Guru into his disciple, from Lahina is made Angad, literally a part of Guru Nanak’s own body. The corporeal succession started by Guru Nanak continued on through his nine historical successors and finally merged with their book of verse, the Guru Granth. Across continents, Sikhs revere their scripture as the embodiment of their Ten Gurus and conduct all their ceremonies and rituals in its presence. The poetic text as the physical Guru is a unique phenomenon in the history of religions and traces its origins to Guru Nanak’s performance. Alam illustrates that crucial identity with enormous interest and sensitivity.</p>
         <p>Lahina is depicted five times in the <italic>B-40</italic>. We first see him before he comes into the Sikh fold and materializes as Angad. He is going to the shrine of goddess Durga with three other men (no. 21). The bounce in their gait, their flexed knees and raised heels, and the animated birds and trees in the background impart briskness to the scene. All four carry banners in their hand. Lahina also has a tiny white flower in his right hand and appears to be enjoying its fragrance as he walks along. This image makes the ideological point that Lahina was the rightful heir to Guru Nanak (no. 39).</p>
         <p>The next one (no. 22) marks a nuanced reverse: the group is now entering into the frame from the left. The men are paying homage to Guru Nanak, who is seated under a tree in the far right with Mardana striking the strings of his rebab. Lahina, identified in the text as wearing “pure white,” is bowing to the Guru, who reciprocates by showering blessings with his extended right hand. The narrative reads, “From the beginning to the end you are me. You will not be parted from my body. You are born from my body” (Tun aadi ant mera hai / tun mere ang thi juda na hohiga / meriah angahu tun paida hoia ha) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 86). The painting tries to depict the quintessential phenomenon of Guru Nanak transforming his disciple Lahina into Angad, literally making him a limb of his body.</p>
         <p>In illustration number 54, they are symmetrically facing each other. Guru Nanak is on the left; Guru Angad is on the right. Guru Nanak’s beard is white; Guru Angad’s is dark. Guru Nanak has a rosary in one hand and looks into the far beyond; Guru Angad has his eyes lowered, and his hands are joined in veneration to Guru Nanak. The scene poignantly captures the moment of succession from the venerable Nanak to the middle-aged Angad. While Guru Nanak looks into his timeless and spaceless future, his younger successor with his folded hands accepts the responsibility to replace him as the Guru. The sounds of Mardana’s rebab merge with the spiritual flow from Nanak’s lips, creating a cosmic symphony that chimes with the music of the blooming flowers and the chirping birds. The red bird above is witnessing the scene. According to the Janamsakhi text, Guru Nanak says, “I have put my hand on you; speak whatever comes to you” (Mai tudh upar hath rakhia hai Jeo e tio aakh) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 146). The founder Guru of Sikhism is clearly transmitting his divine heritage of the formless word to the second through his corporeal touch. There is total coalescence of the physical with the metaphysical. But missing in the pictorial rendition is the Guru’s hand on Angad’s body. As spectators, we are left wondering: Was it merely a technical problem for the artist or some discomfort with physical intimacy?</p>
         <p>Alam’s next painting (no. 55) shows Guru Angad resuming his spiritual legacy: his chin is higher, his eyes are wider, and to the figure whose human contours appear to be merging with infinite space, he says, “You are the Guru, you are Gobind; I see no other” (Guru bhi tu hai gobind bhi tu hai duja koi najari nahin avda) (<italic>B-40</italic>, 149; also cited in Hans’s illustrated edition). What does not fully come out in the scene—and undoubtedly it would have been difficult to render pictorially—is Guru Nanak’s view of the human body as the supreme realm. Earlier in the Janamsakhi text, the departing Guru instructs his successor that the eight spheres are external, but it is the ninth within that holds the nine treasures of the Divine Name: <disp-quote>

               <p>[The eight spheres extend out. The ninth sphere is this body. This entire expansion is in the sphere of the body itself. The ninth is superior to the eight regions for what virtue? Because it has the nine treasures of the divine Name! By searching it is discovered. Those who search this realm of the body, they are the devotees of the Divine.] </p>
            </disp-quote>The human body is explicitly exalted as the reservoir of the Divine treasures, and everybody is exhorted to discover its wealth.</p>
         <p>The next and penultimate illustration drives Guru Nanak’s corporeal message further. The Guru is pointing to his black and blue skin near his rib cage (no. 56; see fig. 10). His torso is bare, and he is not wearing his turban. Iconographically, it varies from the standard Alam illustrations. The Guru stands on a small black square stool with two pots beside him in the middle plane. He is bathing himself with a jug of water while his successor Guru Angad watches him. Below front is Mardana playing his rebab. The usual tree above and the houses behind are missing in the patterned flat background. Along with Guru Angad, the viewer witnesses the porous nature of the Guru’s body—its fusion with his intangible word. Pointing to the skin on his waist, Nanak explains to Angad that a young shepherd was reciting his composition Arati, and since he somatically exists in his verse, he was with the shepherd and his goats at that particular time of the evening. The terrain happened to be thorny, and as the Guru brushed against some of the bushes, he was bruised. The Guru’s enchantment with the corporeality of sacred verse is strikingly conveyed in the painting. Clearly the <italic>body as poetry</italic> is not some plain old simile, it is not a figurative trope either, and it is not a literalist slip. His sonorous verse (<italic>bani</italic>) is the actual breathing, injured Guru. His verse is his body, and as the Sikh text claims, “bani is the guru, the guru is bani” (bani guru guru hai bani) (GG, 982). Shattering the tyrannical opposition of body and mind, language and reality, a new vision of being in the world springs forth. Centuries later, the lingering image of Guru Nanak’s bruises reflected through the primordial mirror opens fresh new possibilities for viewers to experience the sacred and the sensuous in their daily life.<fig id="fg10" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Subsequent artists continue to underscore the link between the physical and metaphysical identity so crucial to the founder Sikh Guru. In a late nineteenth-century watercolor (at the Government Museum and Art Gallery in Chandigarh), we see him in a mesmerizing full-sleeved robe.<sup>42</sup> With the patronage of the first Sikh emperor Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839), Sikh art had reached new heights. In this exquisite painting, the Guru has a full beard, but in addition to Alam’s iconography, he has a halo, his turban has a high flap and a domed top, and he is framed in a regal setting. One of the Janamsakhis recounts Guru Nanak receiving a cloak of honor during his visit to Baghdad, with verses from the holy Quran embroidered on it.<sup>43</sup> In the watercolor, tinted in a golden hue, the Guru’s robe is inscribed all over with calligraphy in Arabic characters in the <italic>naksh</italic> script. The Guru, deep in thought with a rosary in his hands, is seated on a terrace. Some branches, in brushstrokes on the right, echo his profile. In the far background is an impressionist rendering of sizable foliage. In the foreground, we get a glimpse of the Mughal-styled balcony balustrade with latticework. Closer still is a big round pillow cushion associated with emperors, and the Guru, with his left leg tucked under and the right one placed over the left knee, sits perfectly aligned with his royal backdrop. The rich horizontal folds of his pillow cushion dynamically intersect with the vertical stripes of his pajama-trousers; the circular designs on his turban rhythmically repeat the circles on the pillow, the necklace around his neck, and the rosary in his right hand; the triangles decorated with yet more triangular florets on his draping shawl join the rectangular border of the carpet he is seated on.</p>
         <p>In this scene of perpetual motion, the Guru is wrapped in a robe spun with verses from the holy Quran and the sublime Japji that cover his entire front and sleeves. The Islamic invocation <italic>bismillah al rahman al rahim</italic> and the Sikh <italic>adi sacu jugadi sacu hai bhi sacu hosi bhi sacu</italic> appear together.<sup>44</sup> The diverse threads of Guru Nanak’s dress powerfully weave That One who is beyond all external designs and forms. In its visual hermeneutics, the work unravels not only the meaning of the term “text” (derived from the Latin <italic>texere</italic>, to weave), but also the singular transcendent matrix from which all the materials are born. The call for <italic>rahimat</italic> or <italic>rahim</italic> is the perennial womb of Truth (<italic>sacu</italic>), which always was ( <italic>jugadi sacu</italic>), is (<italic>hai bhi sacu</italic>), and will be evermore (<italic>hosi bhi sacu</italic>). Without halting the mind anywhere, the painting gives a visual and sonorous push to imagine and intuit That Infinite One, common to everybody.</p>
         <p>Such visual presentations powerfully demonstrate Guru Nanak’s somatic existence in his word. They also foreshadow his tenth successor, who invested the Granth with physical Guruship. The bruised body in Alam’s scene is a palpable reminder of Guru Gobind Singh’s momentous action performed just before he passed away in 1708; it is a graphic explanation for the liturgical verse recited daily by the Sikhs: “Know the Guru Granthji as the manifest body of the Gurus” (Guru granth ji manio pragat guran ki deh; <italic>deh</italic> literally means <italic>body</italic>).<sup>45</sup> With his anthropomorphic depictions, Guru Nanak’s word enshrined in scripture only becomes more applicable in daily life. The Sikh community can shed its fear and anxiety about the visual.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The Guru’s body, his gestures, his garments, and the items held by him are imbued with enormous spiritual values. They function as symbols, for they bring about a “coincidence of sensible appearance and suprasensible meaning,” which Gadamer notes is the original significance of the Greek <italic>symbolon</italic>, “the union of two things that belong together.”<sup>46</sup> Palpably held by the Guru, the rosary, the writing board, the flower, the cloth covering, and the jug of water reach out to the transcendent sphere and bring back enchantment to daily acts—be they bathing, smelling, eating, writing, or contemplating. By choreographing the Guru’s performance, the painter puts us in touch with our own somatic bodies and orients us to a powerful ontological experience in this temporal world.</p>
         <p>Likewise, the scenes of Guru Nanak performing miracles depicted by Alam are existentially important for viewers. The Guru can read minds, he can make crops grow instantly, he can make the shade of a tree stand still, he can change a ram back to Mardana, he can make a mosque turn around, he can cool a monster’s boiling cauldron of oil with a dip of his finger, he can turn icy waters lukewarm, and so on. But these visual renditions do something more. Rather than miracles displaying or communicating Guru Nanak’s supernatural grandeur, they strike upon the inner eye and play upon our imagination. These are not miracles in the Western semantic sense. Full of wit and wonder, they wander from the protagonist to the wonders of our own bodies and those that surround us—human or natural—and incite us to expect the extraordinary events in the daily rhythms of ordinary life.</p>
         <p>When we see a teenage Nanak lying on his right side on the ground in the fields (no. 2), something happens in our bodies. His eyes are closed, and his face rests peacefully on his crossed arms. He is sound asleep while birds chirp above in the trees, and his cows and buffaloes graze freely around him. The illustration does more than tell the story that these rich crops grew miraculously after being devoured by the cattle while the herdsman Nanak, lost in thought, happened to neglect his professional duties. As the shadowy figures grazing in the rich wheat fields in the foreground and the birds amid the foliage of the trees at the back frame the sleeping figure, they evoke the vast dream world where anything is possible. Science teaches us that each cell of the human body is an elaborate biochemical computer with its own power management and information processing structures. The sleeping teenager in Alam’s painting opens us to the vast potential of the human body along with its exciting unconscious world full of “miracles.”</p>
         <p>The next illustration (no. 3) also presents Guru Nanak sleeping horizontally, with his upper body bare. This time, the immobile shade of the tree above protects him from the scorching sun, a pan-Indian symbol (utilized in Buddhist Jatakas) to mark his “supernatural” quality. Again, Alam’s painting accomplishes something more with its playfulness. We see a row of birds flying toward the left, ripe mangoes dangling from the tree above, the horse in the foreground galloping, its rider pointing excitedly, the guy across from him gasping in amazement, and the anthropomorphic face of the sun with his big eyes betraying a wild curiosity. In the center of it all we see the teenager blissfully asleep. His serene body seems to have gathered the multivalent energy of his landscape. Paradoxically, the sleeping Guru Nanak takes away the attention from himself and instead awakens the spectator to the richness that surrounds every<italic>body</italic> at every moment.</p>
         <p>Such scenes reproduce the somatic response of “Vismaya.” From the Sanskrit root <italic>smi</italic>, the word is etymologically related with the Greek <italic>meidian</italic>, to smile, and Latin <italic>miraculum</italic>, to wonder.<sup>47</sup> Importantly, scriptural evidence points to <italic>vismad</italic> (wonder) as the supreme aesthetic mood for Guru Nanak, and since it is grounded in his experience, the 1,430 pages of the Guru Granth are saturated in it. In Guru Nanak’s words, “wondrous are the forms, wondrous the colors…wondrous is the earth, wondrous the species” (vismad roop vismad rang…vismad dharti vismad khani) (GG, 463–64). Rather than steer us to some otherworldly sphere, Guru Nanak’s miracles—just like his verse—animate us so we too can see, smell, touch, taste, and hear the wondrous qualities of our fellow beings on planet earth.</p>
         <p>When Guru Nanak goes to Mecca, the mosque moves around—following the direction of his feet. In this popular narrative, the Guru falls asleep in front of the mosque, with his feet turned toward its <italic>mehrab</italic>. The Qazi in charge gets upset for the irreverence shown by the visitor, but in response, the Guru politely asks the Qazi to turn his feet in a direction he felt proper. As Guru Nanak’s feet are turned, so does the sacred mosque. Alam shows an astonished Qazi marveling at a blue-robed Nanak sound asleep (no. 12; see fig. 11). There is no need to consider it a historical fact; the motion of circularity simply shatters rigid mental formulas. That the Divine exists in every direction is the moral derived from the narrative, which is retold over and over in Sikh life and scholarship. But what has been woefully overlooked once again is Guru Nanak’s affirmation of the human body. This scene of the Guru in Mecca in fact brings attention to our own bodies: from head to toe, nothing is polluted; all parts are equally sacred. Guru Nanak’s act breaks somatophobic prejudice that upholds the thinking “head” above the corporeal “body”—along with all its hegemonic structures—and whirls the viewers into a vast wholesome horizon. His so-called miracles challenge society to interrogate their innate assumptions and simultaneously create “widening experience” (a distinguishing feature of metaphors for Gadamer).<sup>48</sup> Indeed, each of Alam’s fifty-seven paintings is a metaphor that allows his audience to read Guru Nanak’s transcendental understanding in their own bodies. They visually reinforce the Sikh scriptural message and concretize Guru’s aural verses into actions and reactions.<fig id="fg11" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Ultimately, Alam’s collection leaves us with a “biophilial” imaginary. Appropriated as a psychological and philosophical category by feminist thinkers, biophilial—literally, a love for life—reorients the preoccupation with death and the other world.<sup>49</sup> The above themes converge in Alam’s finale, a split narrative about the death of the Guru (no. 57). In the bottom scene are three yogis handing ashes to a young fellow, an attendant of the Guru. Youth is the channel to communicate to the Guru about his final moments of embodiment. The attendant has luxurious curls similar to the young Nanak we first saw. In the upper plane, the Guru as usual is seated under the tree, with Mardana playing the rebab. He prepares for his cremation in this final scene, an enigmatic replay of his preparation for school in the opening (no. 1). No eternity, no disembodied soul, no otherworld; in this biophilial finale, finite metaphysics sweeps into sensuous ontology. Mangoes and birds and roses—everything around Guru Nanak is in vibrant motion. His own departure fits in with this natural momentum of the universe. In the text, “Baba sat cross-legged on the funeral pyre! When the fire had subsided.…A divine fragrance hung in the air and there reverberated the unearthly cadence of falling waters, [with] the strains of all manner of musical instrument.”<sup>50</sup> The ash that he turned into will perpetually enliven the cosmos. So will his flesh that is his sublime verse. So will his fragrance, and that cadence of waters, and those musical strains. Pulling together the multifarious sensations, the anthropomorphic images painted by Alam Chand Raj render an intimate presence of the first Sikh Guru in this magical world. Spectators are viscerally stimulated to experience the infinite Divine in the very fibers of their physical, social, and cosmic reality. The Guru’s body is no different from his word.</p>
