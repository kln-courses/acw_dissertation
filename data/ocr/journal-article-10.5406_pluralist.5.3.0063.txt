<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Attention, Affirmation,   and the Spiritual Law of Gravity j. heath atchley Mount Holyoke College All of us had fallen from 100 stories. —John Leonard falling is rarely a good thing. It is something to avoid for safety, and  such avoidance, for those of us fortunate enough to be in good health, has  been burned into the unconscious memory of our muscles and bones. Un- less we find ourselves in high places (pursuing intense pleasure, such as rock  climbing, or performing work that few will do, such as painting a steeple),  or on some kind of precipice (the edge of a sidewalk, a balcony with a loose  guardrail), falling tends not to be on the mind. It is, most of the time, a  surprise.  But it is also always a possibility, in part because of one of those char- acteristics that define the human—our upright posture. Without this trait  that makes us bipeds instead of quadrupeds, that gives us a slightly greater  distance from the earth, falling would be less of an issue. Thus, one can say  in a rather abstract and grandiose way, that our humanity makes us prone to  falling (and makes falling a convenient and pervasive moral metaphor).  We are not, however, simply prone to a particular action but are also  prone to the force or condition that creates that action—gravity. While fall- ing might not often be on the mind, gravity occasionally is, finding its way  into thought and language. For physicists, especially of the theoretical vari- ety, gravity is the sticky phenomenon that has prevented the reconciliation  of general relativity and quantum mechanics, and thus it has proven to be  an obstruction to the much-desired Theory of Everything (TOE)—absolute  (scientific) knowledge. In addition to its physical pull, gravity has lifted its  way into metaphor. In philosophy, Nietzsche speaks of the spirit of gravity as  a nihilistic resentment toward life that prevents one from affirming life’s im- manent value; its antidote is the free-spirited practice of philosophy (303–07).  Simone Weil describes gravity as a metaphysical force that draws one away  from the transcendent light of god; its antidote is grace (1–5). And, of course,  the pluralist Volume 5, Number 3 Fall 2010 : pp. 63–72 63  ©2010 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois </page> <page sequence="2"> 64 the pluralist 5 : 3 2010 in everyday language, when something is described as grave, or a situation is  characterized by its gravity, what is indicated is a somberness and seriousness  that could well approach tragedy. To use these terms in such a way means  something has badly gone wrong. Gravity is troublesome. In our fantasies,  we wish to defy it (as superheroes do); in our everyday movements, we resist  it (as when walking or picking up things). : : : I come to these thoughts, in part, by way of Don DeLillo’s recent novel  Falling Man. The novel’s title refers to a New York City performance artist  who, in the days after 9/11, jumps off of buildings, bridges, and other high  places wearing a business suit, only to be caught by an inconspicuous safety  rope tied around one of his legs. These performances attract crowds and a  variety of emotional responses—from fascination and awe to consternation  and censure: She’d heard of him, a performance artist known as Falling Man. He’d  appeared several times in the last week, unannounced, in various parts of  the city, suspended from one or another structure, always upside down,  wearing a suit, a tie and dress shoes. He brought it back, of course, those  stark moments in the burning towers when people fell or were forced  to jump. He’d been seen dangling from a balcony in a hotel atrium and  police had escorted him out of a concert hall and two or three apart- ment buildings with terraces or accessible rooftops.  Traffic was barely moving now. There were people shouting up at  him, outraged at the spectacle, the puppetry of human desperation, a  body’s last fleet breath and what it held. It held the gaze of the world,  she thought. (DeLillo 33) At first, these performances seem to command to the viewer: “Remember.”  The collective urge to move on after a trauma is strong. Returning to business- as-usual indicates health, resilience—a grasping onto the life that remains.  This is why the reopening of the New York Stock Exchange the week after  9/11 was celebrated as a triumph: The terrorists have not stopped us from  occupying our hours as we do. It is time to get back to it. But wait. It is not  just that we were attacked. If that were the case, the response of resilience  might seem more appropriate (when knocked down, of course, one gets back  up). Something more has happened. People have fallen—not just died, but  fallen. And many of them were clad, no doubt, in the clothing of power. The  world was theirs, hence ours, to profit from. Until, of course, the planes came,  and the only place to go was to the ground, which was so far away. This is  </page> <page sequence="3"> atchley : Spiritual Law of Gravity 65 something to remember. We will never know it if we get back to business- as-usual too hastily and too desperately.  In the fictional world of Falling Man it is only days after the attacks.  Returning to routine would be a gut reaction to the shock and awe. For the  reader, however, it has been years. Routine has been going on for quite a while,  and its ill effects are clearly visible. The drive for retribution, the search for  a new enemy, and the remaking of an old one. Where has this led us? What  if we had better remembered the falling?  To remember requires, in the first place, seeing. That is why there is the  performance. To compel seeing: “It held the gaze of the world” (DeLillo 33).  The Falling Man’s performances do not represent or recreate the attacks.  There is no signification of planes, explosions, fire, or collapsing buildings.  No particular victims are portrayed. There is just falling (and then dangling).  Nothing more is indicated. The performance appears to enact a nearly ascetic  reduction in consciousness. All of the rhetoric and thought that emerged in  the wake of 9/11—the commentaries, explanations, promises, justifications,  prognostications, gestures of mourning, and sympathy—it is as if all of these  things are thrust outside of the mind, if only for a moment, and the only  thing that is there is the reality of falling, a reality so fundamental to this  event—to its possibility and its meaning—that it should not be overlooked.  But seeing it requires the effort of attention, the kind of attention cast aside  in the pursuit of ordinary business (busyness). The performance is an inter- ruption and a display: Look at this, because it has not been seen, and it is  worth seeing.  But what are we compelled to see? A human body that has surrendered  itself to gravity. This amounts to a vivid display of vulnerability. There is  the safety harness, of course, but during Falling Man’s free fall, he is utterly  powerless, completely subjected to the force of gravity. Once he makes the  jump, his will—his desire for any particular action or outcome—is irrelevant.  Then there is the dangling, gravity continuing to assert its presence after the  safety device has done its job, as if to remind us that the harness is a stopgap  measure; gravity does not go away. In one instance, Falling Man jumps from  the outdoor maintenance platform of a subway track three stories above the  ground just as a train passes by. Though a crowd watches him from the street,  his intended audience is the subway passengers who cannot see the safety  harness nor the end of his fall. All they see is the drastic action of gravity.  That we are vulnerable to violence conditioned by global politics is clear  enough after 9/11. What is also clear are the political and military actions that  have been taken in hopes of eradicating this vulnerability. Such eradication, of  </page> <page sequence="4"> 66 the pluralist 5 : 3 2010 course, is impossible, partly because the interconnectedness of contemporary  nation-states limits the measures any particular nation-state can take to pro- tect its people (especially from violence committed by non-state entities). At  a deeper level, however, vulnerability in itself cannot be eliminated because it  is built into our corporeal nature: we are bodies subject to forces beyond our  mastery. We know this already, but how often do we see it? When do we give  attention to the fundamental vulnerability of our bodies (of ourselves as bodies)  without immediately taking (or at least thinking about) protective measures?  Would such acknowledgement not have effects beyond the psychological ori- entation of an individual person? Along such lines, Judith Butler writes: Mindfulness of this vulnerability can become the basis of claims for  non-military solutions [to terrorism], just as denial of this vulnerability  through a fantasy of mastery (an institutionalized fantasy of mastery)  can fuel the instruments of war. We cannot, however, will away this  vulnerability. We must attend to it, even abide by it, as we begin to think  about what politics might be implied by staying with the thought of  corporeal vulnerability itself. (29) Seeing the Falling Man (in our case, seeing is also reading) is an opportunity  to attend to and abide by a primal helplessness buried within the core of  self-assertive, self-protective action. Thus, the performance is not merely a  spectacle or aesthetic phenomenon but is also an encounter with an unknown  ground from which ethics might arise. : : : There is more to these performances, however, than simply portraying the  “puppetry of human desperation.” Within such a dramatic gesture, it is easy  to fixate on the human element—the person falling and the people who fell  from the World Trade Center a few days before. But there is also the more- than-human element. There is gravity itself. Gravity, not just our precarious  relationship to it, is something we are beckoned to see. To follow this thought,  consider these lines from Emerson’s essay “Spiritual Laws”: Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways.  When the fruit is ripe, it falls. When the fruit is despatched, the leaf  falls. The circuit of the waters is mere falling. The walking of man and all  animals is a falling forward. All our manual labor and feats of strength,  as prying, splitting, digging, rowing, and so forth are done by dint of  continual falling, and the globe, earth, moon, comet, sun, star, fall for  ever and ever. (308, par. 10) </page> <page sequence="5"> atchley : Spiritual Law of Gravity 67 Falling is all around us. Not just in the form of accidents and tragedies. It is  present in the things we do and in things we observe. Ordinary actions nec- essary for survival are forms of falling. Movements within nature are forms  of falling. So while we try to avoid falling as a way of preserving bodily in- tegrity, we cannot elude it all together. We fall anyway, even as we work to  prevent the tumbles, drops, and plunges that might get in our way or even  end our lives.  Indeed, we are falling all of the time. The Falling Man’s performances,  then, display the most ordinary thing in the world. This suggests that they  are more than commemorations of those who were forced to jump to their  deaths on 9/11. Those tragic leaps are the immediate reference, but the Falling  Man’s gesture cultivates a more extended attention. In addition to remember- ing the lost, we turn toward a reality we normally resist.  There is a lesson to be drawn, according to Emerson, from such atten- tion: The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations, that our life might  be much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be  a happier place than it is; that there is not need of struggles, convul- sions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing of the  teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere with the optimism  of nature; for, whenever we get the vantage-ground of the past, or of a  wiser mind in the present, we are able to discern that we are begirt with  laws which execute themselves. (307, par. 6) Lines such as these, certainly, have contributed to Emerson’s reputation for  naive optimism, and I doubt they can be meaningful to anyone who has  experienced an inordinate amount of injustice or oppression. But the opti- mism indicated here is that of nature; it is not ours, not the kind of human  optimism that wishes for things to work according to our desires and plans.  Indeed, optimism in its typical human form gets in the way of nature’s op- timism, blinds us to it. When our wishes do not become fulfilled, when our  projections fall short, then comes the wringing of hands and gnashing of  teeth. Life itself then becomes responsible, so we think, for our disappoint- ments and despairs.  Still, it does not seem quite right to attribute optimism to nature. Na- ture does not wish. It does not seek out some greater, more optimum set of  conditions. It has no personality that demands or expects fulfillment. Nature  just is. But that is not quite right either; it feels too static. Nature is, but  nature moves (after all, falling is pervasive). Its being is infused with becom- </page> <page sequence="6"> 68 the pluralist 5 : 3 2010 ing. There is here an implicit (and perhaps surprising) criticism of theism,  the view that life ultimately derives from the will of a deity. Nature does not  satisfy our wishes and has no wishes of its own. This suggests that there is  no larger self—no anthropomorphic god—whose wishes, or designs, nature  does satisfy. So the way to remain vibrantly attached to a life that inevitably  disappoints is to discern that such a life rests in the midst of laws that are  constantly at work. There are no wishes, plans, or projections in nature (that is  the stuff of humans). There is just the reality of nature and its movement.  The impact of this reality is conveyed by Emerson’s use of the term laws.  Recognizing that we are in the midst of laws executing themselves—something  that happens when we reflect on our past experience or are in the presence  of a particularly wise mind—counteracts the regular interference we give to  nature’s optimism (its value separate from our desires). But what kind of law  could Emerson mean? Of course, he means natural laws, because he has been  describing nature, and the lines that describe the prevalence of falling clearly  refer to the law of gravity. But what kind of thing is a natural law? Emerson’s  implied criticism of theism suggests that there is no legislator who writes, en- acts, and enforces natural laws. A human law, on the other hand, is designed  to produce something specific—behaviors conducive to a more desirable social  world. Nature lacks this kind of intentionality. Its laws are our articulations of its  consistency. Pretty much everything is drawn toward the earth, and the earth is  drawn toward the sun. That action does not appear to vary, so it must “obey”  a law. Let us call it gravity. By doing so, what do we gain? In a scientific frame  of mind, of course, when we articulate enough of these laws, we can start to  predict natural phenomena pretty well, such that we can manipulate the con- sistency of nature in ways that contribute to our survival and prosperity. But  Emerson’s essay is not a scientific treatise, and no one could develop any form  of technology from reading it. Instead, the notion that we dwell in the midst of  natural laws executing themselves is meant to elicit an affirmation of the value  of life—a value that does not change when our fates and fortunes do. Life’s  value is there, no matter what happens to us. Realizing this fact entails seeing  through our own optimism (or pessimism) in order to see nature’s optimism  (which, strictly speaking, is not optimism at all but more like ontology). But  why does the recognition of natural laws elicit affirmation? Because the laws  are not just natural (in the sense that they are readily available for our empirical  apprehension); they are also spiritual. Natural laws are spiritual laws.  This apparent paradox dismisses any dualism we might posit between na- ture and spirit. Spirit is not otherworldly, and nature is not a derivative from  some higher realm of being. More importantly, however, it suggests that ulti- </page> <page sequence="7"> atchley : Spiritual Law of Gravity 69 mate reality (which, in certain moods, could also be called the divine) is not far  away. It is manifest in the movements of nature that we apprehend as laws. In  other words, Emerson’s use of the term spiritual means real, and real does not  just mean that which is not fake; it means that which compels our deliberate  attachment, our affirmation. The real, the spiritual, is life’s value. And it is as  easy (and difficult) to see as watching something (or someone) fall. : : : People and buildings are not the only things that fall in Falling Man. A white  shirt floating in the air makes conspicuous appearances near the beginning  and the end of the novel. Keith, one of the main characters, works for an  investment firm located in the World Trade Center. On the morning of 9/11,  he survives the initial impact of the planes, exits his tower, and walks north  in a trauma-induced stupor. No, the term stupor is not quite right. Keith  is certainly dazed and dumbfounded immediately after one of the planes  strikes his building; like everyone else there, he does not know exactly what  has happened; in his office, debris falls; he sees a close friend badly bleeding,  and he watches as the friend dies; he moves with other survivors to the stair- well; once out of the building, several people offer him bottled water, and  he does not know why; he walks uptown to the apartment of his estranged  wife, Lianne, and he does not know why. Befuddlement, however, is not the  only quality of his consciousness that morning. Keith appears, naturally, to  have loosened some of the grip he had on his accustomed world prior to the  trauma, but this loosening does not amount to a dullness or diminishment  of sensibility; his attention has sharpened in a peculiar way: In time he heard the sound of the second fall. He crossed Canal Street  and began to see things, somehow, differently. Things did not seem  charged in the usual ways, the cobbled street, the cast-iron buildings.  There was something critically missing from the things around him.  They were unfinished, whatever that means. They were unseen, what- ever that means, shop windows, loading platforms, paint-sprayed walls.  Maybe this is what things look like when there is no one here to see  them. (DeLillo 5) This seeing-things-differently is not quite consciousness as we might normally  understand it—that part of experience associated with apprehension and  knowledge. Perhaps that is what is missing; perhaps that is why things seem  unfinished. This unfinished quality might mean that all of the human-made  things that comprise the street have been jolted, ever so slightly, outside of the  purposeful human schemata that gave birth to them. They appear unfinished  </page> <page sequence="8"> 70 the pluralist 5 : 3 2010 because the ends to which they have been produced are no longer relevant.  Things are not charged with their usual expectations and teleologies. They  are unseen in the way we normally see them—things for us, extensions of  collective and individual will. But, clearly, they are not completely unseen,  because Keith is there seeing them differently.  One of the things he sees (differently) is a shirt floating in the air: The world was all this as well, figures in windows a thousand feet up, drop- ping into free space, and the stink of fuel fire, and the steady rip of sirens  in the air. The noise lay everywhere they ran, stratified sound collecting  around them, and he walked away from it and into it at the same time.  There was something else then, outside all this, not belonging to  this, aloft. He watched it coming down. A shirt came down out of the  high smoke, a shirt lifted and drifting in the scant light and then falling  again, down toward the river. (DeLillo 4) Amid the chaos of this scene, a falling shirt seems unimportant. After all, there  are people falling. Perhaps that is where the significance of the shirt lies—its  wearer was one of the falling. But there must be more to it than that. We do  not need the image of the shirt to indicate that people are falling, because we  already have the dramatic and overwhelming image of “figures in windows  a thousand feet up, dropping into free space.” Compared to that, the shirt  is nothing. Still, Keith sees the shirt, which means that there is something  to see, but it is not just the shirt, it is the shirt aloft, drifting through the air  toward the earth. Seeing the shirt is a way of seeing gravity. Watching people  jump from their windows, we see their desperation, making a decision in a  no-win situation. This pathos is worth seeing and could cultivate compassion.  But DeLillo’s portrayal of the shirt takes us deeper. It demonstrates gravity  as a presence, a condition at work in this tragic situation that is not human  will—not will at all. There is, after all, so much will at work here: the execu- tion of an elaborate plot to destroy the World Trade Center, the survivors’  drive to escape the buildings, the determination of rescuers to save everyone  they can. In the midst of all this human agency, there is an ever present force  that is attached to no agent. The shirt is a sign of a spiritual law. But this  law is not something to be obeyed, like an edict or directive. (How could we  disobey gravity? It cannot be refused.) Rather, it is a presence to be affirmed  (not exactly known), a nonhuman reality that conditions (and sometimes  threatens) the human. The affirmation comes from the seeing. : : : </page> <page sequence="9"> atchley : Spiritual Law of Gravity 71 Gravity is not the only word for this sense of presence. Another might be god,  but this term is tricky because it usually signifies a transcendent being whose  existence and benevolence elicit (hopefully) belief and the security that nor- mally accompanies belief. It is difficult, however, to avoid the power of this  term—the way it connotes ultimacy, reality, and divinity—even when one  considers an anthropomorphic divine being to be a human fantasy, a larger- than-life image of ourselves projected onto the outside of life. Lianne, Keith’s  estranged-then-reconciled wife, stumbles into similar thoughts: She saw the gray that was beginning to seep into her hair at the scalp.  She would not stain it away. God, she thought. What does it mean to  say that word? Are you born with God? If you never hear the word or  observe the ritual, do you feel the breath alive inside you, in brain waves  or pounding heart? (DeLillo 234) Though not conventionally religious, Lianne cannot be indifferent to the con- cept of god, especially in the days and years following 9/11, when this concept  is evoked in so many contexts with desperation and aggression. Notice the  physicality within her reflections—the gray hair, the breath, the brain waves,  and the pounding heart. Whatever the word god might signify in Lianne’s  reckoning, it is not something divorced from materiality, from the movement  and mutations of physical life. In fact, it is her thinking on god that leads her  to a poignant perception of her own physicality: She thought that the hovering possible presence of God was the thing  that created loneliness and doubt in the soul and she also thought that  God was the thing, the entity existing outside of space and time that  resolved this doubt in the tonal power of a word, a voice.  God is the voice that says, “I am not here.”  She was arguing with herself but it wasn’t argument, just the noise  the brain makes.  She had normal morphology. Then one late night, undressing, she  yanked a clean green T-shirt over her head and it wasn’t sweat she smelled  or maybe just a faint trace but not the sour reek of the morning run.  It was just her, the body through and through. It was the body and  everything it carried, inside and out, identity and memory and hu- man heat. It wasn’t even something she smelled so much as knew. It  was something she’d always known. The child was in it, the girl who  wanted to be other people, and obscure things she could not name. It  was a small moment, already passing, the kind of moment that is always  only seconds from forgetting. </page> <page sequence="10"> 72 the pluralist 5 : 3 2010  She was ready to be alone, in reliable calm, she and the kid, the  way they were before the planes appeared that day, silver crossing blue.  (DeLillo 236) To say “I am not here,” I must be here, in some sort of capacity. For the words  to be uttered, the voice must be present. God, however, is not here within  space and time; hence, there is loneliness and doubt in the soul. But then  there is the voice that utters these strange words. The voice is the presence,  but it is linked to nothing discernible. There is just the voice, just the pres- ence. Perhaps something has been left unsaid yet implied: “I am not here . . .  in the guise you’ve been told to expect.” There is no I here, but there is an  is. So what of it? (Has someone won an argument?) Maybe these thoughts  are just cognitive noise.  Well, there is the body—with its vulnerability and mutability, its ca- pacities for pleasure and for disintegration, its subjection to the constant  presence (law) of gravity. If one could learn to live with the body rather than  in it—if one were body through and through rather than a kind of ghost  occupying an empty shell—would not that change things, somehow? This,  it seems to me, is the crux of Lianne’s reliable calm. By thinking about god,  she has found her body and found it to be okay, which means that the life in  which her body partakes is also okay (in spite of it all). This is affirmation.  Lianne’s version does not match the elevated enthusiasm of Emerson’s. But  it is much the same (and perhaps more appealing to those of us who cannot  gloss over suffering too easily). Lianne has not figured out anything about a  divine being or the ultimate nature of reality. Her thinking has not brought  her knowledge—nothing she can report or display with the satisfaction of  expertise. This thinking has done something different. It has cultivated at- tention and elicited affirmation. references Butler, Judith. Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence. New York: Verso,  2004. DeLillo, Don. Falling Man.
