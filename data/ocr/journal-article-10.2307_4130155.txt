In 1971 he wrote a doctoral dissertation for the University of Birmingham on Francis Bacon's Natural Philosophy. In 1975 he published the first of a series of articles outlining what he calls Bacon's "speculative philosophy," an element in Bacon's work which, he claims, has been insufficiently recognized by historians of science.' In 1982, according to his own account, he formed the idea for a new edition of Bacon's writings, and with the help of Lisa Jardine submitted a publishing proposal which Cambridge University Press accepted in March 1986.2 However, when the first volume appeared, ten years later, the Clarendon Press at Oxford University had taken over the project, now said to be in twelve volumes." That length estimate soon had to be revised, for a "volume XV" appeared in 2000, sensibly absorbing the edition of Bacon's 1625 Essays by Michael Kiernan which the Clarendon Press had published in 1985.4 (Unfortunately, this volume was simply reprinted, not re-set, al- though its design differs from the rest of the series, and the edi- tor was unable either to correct misprints or to take note of scholarly 1 For a list of Rees's writings see The Oxford Francis Bacon VI: Philosophical Studies c. 1611-c. 1619, ed.

Reference is made in these volumes (IV: viii, and passim) to the "forthcoming edition" by Julian Mar- tin of Bacon's early literary-philosophical works, an event which has been eagerly awaited; but apparently that editor has now with- drawn from the project. It is to be hoped that the remaining vol- umes will appear well within the life-expectations of the editors, and this reviewer. The Oxford Francis Bacon is to be welcomed as a long-overdue replacement for the great Victorian edition by James Spedding, R. L. Ellis, and D. D. Heath.' Graham Rees draws attention, fairly enough, to some deficiencies of that edition which will now be put right: where the Victorian editors gave Bacon's major philo- sophical works pride of place in their three opening volumes (the Novum Organum and other texts belonging to his grandiosely con- ceived Instauratio Magna), this edition will present his works in chronological order; where Ellis and Spedding gave texts in their original Latin, relegating English versions-by other hands-to vols. 4 and 5, this edition will offer translations newly done by the editors themselves, on facing pages; where "Spedding and his collaborators did not provide bibliographies or systematic annota- tion," as Rees puts it7-although they did provide many valuable notes-this edition will do both. The superiority of the new edi- tion will be most apparent at the textual level, for the various revolutions (and counter-revolutions) in bibliographical theory and practice over the last century and a half have given rise to a com- pletely different set of criteria for editors, affecting the choice of a copy-text, the collation of surviving copies of early editions, analysis of press-work and proof-correction, and-in an old-spelling edi- tion such as this-the coherent treatment of spelling, typography, punctuation, and even paragraphing.8 Bacon's Victorian editors worked mostly from the printed texts, since few Bacon manuscripts I See my review of its original publication, Modern Language Review, 83 (1988), 403-5. 6 The Works, "Philosophical" (edited by Ellis and Spedding), "Legal" (edited by Heath) and "Literary" (edited by Spedding) appeared in 7 volumes (London, 1857-61), followed by Bacon's Life and Letters in a further 7 volumes (1861-74), edited by Spedding alone. 7 Rees, "A New Edition," 45. 8 Rees, "Instauratio Instaurationis," 45-7.</page><page sequence="3">146 REVIEW ESSAYS were known of. But, thanks to the indefatigable labours of Dr. Peter Beal, scouring libraries all over the world for his Index of English Literary Manuscripts,9 several hitherto unknown Bacon manuscripts in natural philosophy (among other topics) have been recovered. In the library of the Duke of Devonshire at Chatworth House Beal identified a substantial unknown work, De vijs Mortis, et de Senectute retardanda, atque instaurandis uiribus ("An Inquiry concerning the Ways of Death, the Postponing of Old Age and the Restoring of the Vital Powers"), which Rees edited in 1984 and which he in- cluded, in an improved edition and translation, in the Oxford edition."' Beal discovered, and for a time owned, a complete manuscript of Bacon's early "device" (a dialogue or disputation for four speakers) called Of Tribute; or, giving that which is due, which gives the first sketch of Bacon's ideas for reforming natural phi- losophy. Spedding had printed a fragment;"l but in 1996, with the help of Professor Henry Woudhuysen, I was able to include the complete text (now in the Kodama Memorial Library of Meisei University, Tokyo) in my one-volume edition of Bacon's major English works for "The Oxford Authors" series.'2 Beal discovered several other Bacon manuscripts at the Bibliotheque Nationale, where Giuliano Ferretti also found the complete manuscript of Bacon's Abecedarium novum naturae and a different version of his Historia densi et rari.'3 These new discoveries alone would almost justify a new edition, and they clearly represent a major attraction of the present ven- ture. (It is no accident that the first two volumes published by Rees include almost all the newly-discovered material.) In describing his original conception of this edition, which was to become his life's work, Graham Rees placed text-editing as the first priority: once the new edition is finished, it will stand or fall (above all) on the qual- ity, accuracy and ingegrity of the texts that it presents. Therein lies the per- manent value of any edition. The introductions to the edited texts will, in the nature of things, be superseded relatively quickly by new scholarship and innovative methods in intellectual history. Careful and effective textual an- notation will also be superseded though perhaps less rapidly than the larger- scale interpretative syntheses presented in the introductions.

If the edited texts are right the edition will have been a worth- while project, if the editing is weak then the edition will deserve to fail.14 Under these three headings, then, the text-editing, the annota- tions (or commentary), and the introductions, these two volumes invite evaluation. Michael Kiernan, to whom we are indebted for the best scholarly English'5 edition of Bacon's Essays, has produced the first text- critical edition of The Twoo Bookes of Francis Bacon. Of the proficience and advancement of Learning, divine and human (1605), to give its original title. Following the standard practices of modern textual bibliography, Kiernan identified 81 surviving copies of the first edition, and collated 31 of them by the laborious process of su- per-imposing images of each page in each copy, a process which reveals any corrections made during printing. Renaissance print- ers made sporadic correction while printing was in progress, stop- ping the presses to do so, and simply binding up the total sheets, corrected and uncorrected alike. Examining these 31 chosen copies Kiernan found 327 stop-press corrections, and even a proof-sheet of one forme, "preserved as an endpaper in the Pierpont Morgan Library copy of a translation of St Augustine's De civitate dei pub- lished in London in 1610" (lxviii). Such discoveries justify the tedious labour of collation. Kiernan provides a lucid analysis of the corrections, more than a third of which "correct substantives, that is, make changes which affect the meaning of the text," evalu- ating their implications for establishing Bacon's text (lxviii-lxxiv). By analyzing minute typographical differences (running heads, signatures, initials) Kiernan also establishes that the printing was shared between two well-known London printers, Thomas Purfoot and Thomas Creede, with additional and less careful work by A. N. Other (lix-lxvii). Shared printing was common in this period, especially with such a complex work as Book II of the Advance- ment, but Bacon may well have wanted the book published before the end of Michaelmas Term 1605 and the onset of holidays. Even 14 Ibid., 47. 15 Unfortunately, when working on his 1985 edition, Kiernan was unaware of the outstanding work by Mario Melchionda, Gli 'Essayes' di Francis Bacon: Studio introduttivo, testo critico e commento (Florence, 1979).</page><page sequence="5">148 REVIEW ESSAYS though the proof-corrections suggest that all three printers took care with the text, perhaps even assisted by the author himself, "many serious substantive errors remained and another effort was made to correct the text, this time using the expedient of an errata sheet," despite which many obvious errors still went uncorrected. To the modern reader these may sound like desperate measures, suggesting undue haste to get the work done in time, but Kiernan points out that "seventeenth-century readers were expected to be tolerant of such printing-house blemishes and read with quill in hand" (lxxv). After this forty-page analysis, summing up years of work, Kiernan records that all the factors he has identified "combine to create a textual climate of some unease for the modern editor" (lxxix), quite unlike the straightforward case of the 1625 Essays, which were carefully typeset and corrected. Sensibly, he considers each of the variants produced by stop-press correction on its individual mer- its, accepting neither corrected nor uncorrected readings un- critically (lxxxiv). Kiernan's "unease," I am glad to say, will not be shared by his readers, who can use this text in the confident knowledge that every relevant piece of evidence has been proper- ly evaluated. This edition renders all previous editions obsolete, and will certainly stand for the foreseeable future. Kiernan's Commentary runs to 160 pages, drawing on an ex- egetical tradition stretching from Gilbert Wats in 1640 to my own edition of 1996, meticulously crediting each editor's contribution to tracing "this most magpie of readers" (1xxxv) as he drew on his wide reading and capacious memory. Kiernan adds to our knowl- edge of Bacon's sources with reference to Louis La Roy's treatise De la vicissitude des choses (211, 214, 230, 285). He well documents Bacon's use of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, showing that in some cases successive passages reappear in the same order in Bacon, suggest- ing that he wrote with a copy of Plutarch open in front of him (210, 213). In annotating Bacon's reading Kiernan has missed little, but one source he has overlooked is Erasmus's popular collection, Parabolae sive Similia (1514, many editions), which Bacon used for the Essays, the Advancement of Learning, and elsewhere.16 I recently discovered that Bacon's famous praise of "letters"-both "writing" and "written documents"-which, "as ships pass through the vast 16 See David K. Weiser, "Bacon's Borrowed Imagery," Review of English Studies, n. s. 38 (1987), 315-24.</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ESSAYS 149 seas of time, and make ages so distant to participate of the wis- dom, illuminations, and inventions, the one of the other," is a more eloquent version of a passage in the historian Diodorus Siculus, also praising "letters": "Who could speak highly enough of train- ing in the art of writing? By this means alone the dead speak to the living, and through the written word those who are widely separated in space communicate with those remote from them as if they were neighbours" (12.13.2). Some of Kiernan's notes are longer, uesful miniature essays, as on medical history (211, 293- 300), Du Bartas (219-20), on the universities' curricula and their resistance to change, and on Bacon's geocentrism (286-7). Some aspects of the Commentary are less satisfying. Two gen- eral criticisms are in order. First, Kiernan laudably quotes Plutarch from North's sixteenth-century translation but he cites the un- paginated 1603 edition, instead of giving the standard paragraph references: to check Life ofJulius Caesar, Sig. 3P 3 will need a visit to a rare book room. Secondly, Kiernan unaccountably fails to use the standard work by Emil Wolff, Francis Bacon und seine Quellen. Band L Bacon und die griechische Philosophie. Band II. Griechische Autoren und riimische Dichter (Berlin, 1910, 1913; facs. repr. Nendeln, Liech- tenstein, 1977), which still provides the best documentation of Bacon's reading in classics, and even identifies some of the Re- naissance editions he used, including Latin translations of Greek authors.17 Strangely enough, Wolff's surname appears in Kiernan's text three times in notes borrowed from my edition (231, 322; that on 214 is not acknowledged), but without any indication of his identity. This is a rare lapse from an otherwise meticulous scholar. Among many helpful notes, Kiernan has missed a few significant points. Readers should be informed that the word umbratilis (214) has the pejorative associations the Romans usu- ally attached to umbra and otium; Bacon's much-used quotation from Ovid's Heroides (15.83), Abeunt studia in mores, is ambiguously translated as "Studies become manners" (217), where "become" could mean "suit": "pass into," or "have a formative effect on" would be better; the phrase "per otium" is translated "as if in idleness" (289), rather than "at leisure." In translating Bacon's attack on 17 For a valuable recent addition to our knowledge see Henri Durel, "Francis Bacon lecteur d'Aristote ' Cambridge," Nouvelles de la Ripublique des Lettres, 18 (1998), 29-60, who establishes that Bacon's father bought him an Aristotle in Greek and Latin when he went up to Cambridge in 1573, probably editions from Basle dating from the 1550s, and that Bacon read the Organon in the Latin trans- lation by Boethius, probably emanating from Venice.</page><page sequence="7">150 REVIEW ESSAYS Ramus a "compendiorum Patre ... qui cum Methodi suae &amp; compendii, vinculis res torqueat &amp; premat" as a "begetter of manuals ... who tortures and presses facts in the chains of his summary method" (320), Kiernan twice avoids using the word "epitome" for compendium, and renders res as "facts," where it really refers to the classical rhetorical category of res or "matter" (which Kiernan correctly glosses on p. 222). When Bacon expresses the standard classical and Renaissance view that "substance of matter is better than beautie of words," Kiernan adds a quotation from Ascham which says exactly the opposite (225), and while citing some unreliable modern sources Kiernan fails to note that Bacon's belief that words are arbitrary signs of concepts (314-16) reflects the dominant tradi- tion of Aristotle's Peri hermeneias in Renaissance philosophy of language.18 Kiernan helpfully glosses Bacon's use of the word historia as meaning a "systematic account," with no chronological implica- tions (228), but he fails to explain what Bacon meant by "philosophia prima" (277). He refers to Bacon's "idola metaphor" (309, 311), without noting that Bacon uses the word to mean "appearance" or "illusion" rather than "object of worship" (there is no entry for "idol" in the Glossary), and he simply translates Bacon's distinc- tion between Huomo [Kiernan reads Homo] di prima Impressione and Huomo di ultima impressione as "man of the first" and "last impres- sion" (335-6), without noting that it refers to "the impulsive" and "the cautious man" respectively. When Bacon quotes Quintilian's criticism of Seneca, that "Verborum minutijs rerum frangit pondera" ("He broke up weighty matters with trifles of words"), and adds "So a man may truely say of the Schoole-men Questionum minutijs Scientiarum frangunt soliditatem" (24-5), Kiernan describes the sec- ond piece of Latin as "untraced" (226), where it is clearly Bacon's riff on the first. The Glossary (363-86, double-column) is very helpful, but not impeccable. Kiernan defines an "undertaker," or one who takes on various schemes, more or less practicable, as a "charlatan" (227, 385), but something like the later seventeenth- century term "projector" (inventor of projects) would be more suitable. The word "absolutenese," used in reference to rulers, has 18 See Marie-Luce Demonet, Les Voix du signe.

These small blemishes aside, Kiernan's Commentary and Gossary are excellent. His Introduction, however, fulfils only part of what a reader, especially a beginning reader, might legitimately hope for. Entitled "Bacon's Programme for the Reform of Knowledge" (xvii-lvi), it is divided into three sections: a summary of the work's purpose and structure; an account of Bacon's hopes for support from the two universities; and a review of his hopes, equally fu- tile, for royal patronage. All three sections are clearly laid out and well documented, but they do not add up to an adequate account of the work as a whole. It is not easy to match Bacon's polymathic range, as I know to my cost,19 but an editor should try to evaluate Bacon's critique of extant knowledge, if only to register the bold- ness of these Twoo Bookes ... of the proficience and advancement of Learning. Bacon proposes a radical reform of the ways in which knowledge is collected and the goals to which it is applied, apply- ing theory to practice, and practice to theory. In his well-known letter to Lord Burghley (circa 1592) Bacon wrote "I have taken all knowledge to be my province," echoing Cicero's specification for the budding orator, whose range of reference "has no delimited territory, within whose borders it is enclosed and confined. All things whatsover, that can fall under the discussion of human beings, must be aptly dealt with by him."20 But Cicero's orator was only expected to talk coherently on all topics, while Bacon intended to "bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries; the best state of that prov- ince." Bacon's goal to review all human knowledge has often been described as 'Faustian' and unreachable. Michael Kiernan's reach has been more modest, but he has achieved an outstanding edi- tion of Bacon's boldest work. 19 Cf.

Volume XIII brings together six treatises: (1) Historia Densi &amp; Rari; necnon Coitionis &amp; Expansionis Materiae per Spatia ("History of Dense and Rare; or of the Coition and Expansion of Matter in Space"), of which Rees gives both a recently discovered manuscript version, now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, collection Dupuy (33 pages), and a longer version (66 pages), first printed by Bacon's chaplain, William Rawley, in his collection of Bacon's Opuscula varia posthuma, Philo- sophica, Civilia, et Theologica (1658), and included in the Spedding and Ellis edition; (2) Abecedarium novum naturae ("A New Abece- darium of Nature"), discovered by Peter Beal in 1980, and printed here for the first time (26 pages); (3) Historia &amp; inquisitio de animato &amp; inanimato ("History and Inquiry concerning animate and inani- mate"), also discovered in 1980 and appearing in its first edition (4 pages); (4) Inquisitio de Magnete ("An Inquiry concerning the Loadstone"), printed in Rawley's Opuscula and Spedding (2 pages); (5) Prodromi sive Anticipationes Philosophiae Secundae ("Precursors, or Anticipations of the Philosophy to come"), from Isaac Gruter's collection of Bacon's Scripta in Naturali et Universali Philosophia (1653), reprinted by Spedding (3 pages); and (6) Topica Inquisitiones de Luce et Lumine ("Topics of Inquiry concerning Light and Lu- men"), in Gruter (the chosen version), Rawley and Spedding (7 pages). As can be seen, this is a rather miscellaneous, not to say frag- mentary group of posthumously published writings, typical of so much in Bacon's vast and incomplete project. As Rees convinc- ingly argues, the Historia densi was designed for Part III of the "Great Instauration," Bacon's collection of natural histories, material purposefully assembled in order to provide the starting point for a new "interpretation of nature." Part IV would "present a variety of worked examples which would allow the reader to see ... how the interpretation of nature would operate in practice." Of this part, "Bacon completed nothing more than the introduction, the newly recovered Abecedarium," while three of the other works col- lected here (on the animate and inanimate; the loadstone; light) "look like little more than exploratory studies or sketches for projects which, Bacon knew, were out of his reach" (xx-xxi). For Part V, which was to include provisional theories and conclusions</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW ESSAYS 153 arrived at by the ordinary use of reason, Bacon managed only to produce the Prodromi or "Anticipations." Apart from the nearly- complete Historia densi et rari, readers of this volume will engage with "brief forays into territory which Bacon had mapped out but could not occupy" (xxi). Rees dates all six pieces to the period 1620-26. The reappearance of Bacon manuscripts after nearly four hun- dred years is naturally a cause for rejoicing, even though these "exploratory studies or sketches for projects" add little to our knowledge. Those discovered by Peter Beal had simply slumbered in libraries, unrecognized by cataloguers, but the shorter version of the Historia densi et rari has a curious history, which Rees out- lines, building on the work of Giuliano Ferretti.21 Apparently, Philippe Fortin de la Hoguette, an admirer of Bacon's work and an associate of the brothers Dupuy (who had a large library of books and manuscripts), visited Bacon in London in September 1623, obtained a copy of the De Augmentis Scientiarum, just pub- lished, and stole some of Bacon's manuscripts. These ended up in the Dupuys's collection, which they gave to the Bibliotheque Nationale in 1652. Rees gives a very full account of this episode (xlix-lxxiii), which hardly seems to warrant such treatment, as it has no bearing on the substance of Bacon's text. He then discusses the printed copy-texts, adds a valuable biography of Rawley, a faithful servant who preserved so much of his master's work (lxxiii- lxxxiii), and provides a meticulous analysis of the printers and printing of the Opuscula. Rees's editorial treatment of these miscellaneous works is ad- mirable in every respect. He gives us the Latin text of the Historia densi &amp; rari in the Dupuy collection, with meticulous textual notes indicating divergences and added passages (72 of them) in Rawley's longer version, which appears with an equally meticulous annota- tion and an English translation. Rees has persuaded his publisher to reproduce the use of larger and smaller type in the 1658 text, to distinguish material of greater and lesser importance, since this was probably found in the manuscript, and may represent Bacon's intentions. The remaining texts are less complex, but the quan- tity of textual annotation is occasionally considerable, and testi- fies to years of careful work. I cannot imagine that any other scholar 21 Giuliano Ferretti, "Un soldat philosophe": Philippe Fortin de la Hoguette (1585- 1688?) (Genoa, 1988), and other works listed by Rees, xlix note.</page><page sequence="11">154 REVIEW ESSAYS could match Graham Rees in his scrupulous care for detail, or that these texts will ever need editing again. The facing-page translations, Rees has declared, are intended "to reproduce the sense of the Latin in fluent modern English," although he is well aware of the difficulties involved (VI: cxv-cxvi; XIII: xciv-xcvi). Rees has identified some of Bacon's termini technici and defended his chosen equivalents, rendering schematismus as "schematism," not "configuration" (as in the Spedding-Ellis edi- tion), virtus as "virtue," magnes as "loadstone" (to avoid anachro- nism), vis as "power." As the first two examples show, Rees tends towards a literal rendering of the Latin, which is generally to be welcomed. But it occasionally raises further problems. The word schematismus belongs to Bacon's shifting and sometimes evasive vocabulary for discussing the constitution of matter, and Rees helpfully adds a note in his Commentary expounding the various senses in which Bacon used the term (308, acknowledging the "recent and valuable account" by Benedino Gemelli, Aspetti dell'ato- mismo classico nella filosofia di Francis Bacon e nel Seicento, Florence 1996). But "virtue" to the modern reader has an almost exclusively ethical sense, and a translator needs to bring out the connota- tions of virtus as "innate power" or "strength." Over-literal trans- lation confronts the reader with terms which she will only find in a large English dictionary, if at all, such as "densations" (55), "fore- fumes" (65), "introception" (75), "divulsion" (121), and "preda- tion" for depraedatio (118). On p. 121 Rees translates Distractiones as "disruptions," but on p. 125 he leaves it as "distraction," a word having far different connotations. Some passages are inelegant or ungrammatical, such as this conclusion to one of Bacon's many attacks on the Peripatetics: "So it would be bettter if they stopped splitting hairs and that the dictatorship should cease" (51). To be literal is not enough. Rather than "fluent modern English," read- ers will find too many passages of clumsy English and defective word-order, and at times they will be unsure of Bacon's meaning. "The nature of dense and rare, although it runs through practically all the other natures, is not run by their rules but seems only to have close consent with heavy and light. But I also think it can have consent with quick and slow taking up and putting off of hot and cold. So do an experiment ... ." (53); "All crude spirits attached to tangible bodies are also denser than air in my view" (65); "I have still not abandoned any care in its investigation" (67); "and accurate order thus leads in things like this either to repetition or er- ror" (73); "I wish to leave what I am about open to industry of everyone to copy" (ibid.); "A bladder or other tensile bodies (such as bellows) are blown up and extended by plain air to such a degree that they are hardened and</page><page sequence="12">REVIEW ESSAYS 155 can put up with being struck or thrown around" (75); "Spirit confined in putrefaction ... get animalculae going" (81); "Air is just dilated by heat" (87); "iron and glass seem ... to be dilated in respect of their enclosed spir- its, whence originates the working up of the tangible parts" (95). These translations are inferior to those in Volume XIII, where Rees was aided by Michael Edwards, a classicist. Bacon deserves better than this! Rees's commentary on these texts (269-336) is meticulously documented, illustrated from wide reading in primary and sec- ondary literature, and generally helpful.22 It includes some useful notes on Bacon's terminology: that he used coitio as a synonym for contractio (269); that "method" refers not to "the generation of new knowledge but ... the transmission of existing knowledge" (278); that apertura (which Rees translates, rather uninventively, as "opening") "denotes effects-such, for instance, as chemical reactions-in addition to mere expansion" (284); that perceptio can mean the automatic reaction of some substances to heat and cold (290); or that "for Bacon 'fossil' generally means a refractory stone" (292). Other notes on terminology bring out what I would describe as Bacon's selective syncretism, his attempt to forge a philosophical language for himself by adopting terms and categories from pre- vious philosophers of nature, endorsing some parts of their work and rejecting others. In these fragmentary treatises Bacon regu- larly attacked the 'Aristotelian' four-element theory (xxxv, xlv, 272), but much of his theory of matter is organized around what he himself decribed as "those virtues which may be reckoned as Car- dinal and Catholic in nature" (xxxvii). He groups them into bi- nary pairs not unlike the element theory of the Presocratics: dense/ rare, heavy/light, hot/cold, volatile/fixed, tangible/pneumatic. In the Abecedarium naturae, as Rees points out, Bacon organized "the simple motions ... into what may be called a 42 structure, i.e. to deal with sixteen simple motions arranged into groups of four" (xliii), necessitating some re-arrangement of the constitu- ent elements. Rees cannot explain this operation-"Why Bacon should want to multiply or dissolve distinctions at will in order to reach apparently arbitrary totals is anyone's guess" (xliv)-but it 22 There is only one quotation he has failed to trace ("sed quia ut ait ex politicis nescio quis, quaedam statim placent, quaedam temporis inualescunt," 172), and only one term, exporrectiones, which is "not found in any thesaurus or lexicon known to me" (307).</page><page sequence="13">156 REVIEW ESSAYS is reminiscent of traditional classificatory systems, like the "corre- spondences," in which material is arranged into given numerical groups (three, four, seven, and so on). There is certainly nothing here like the discovery of new and accurate categories reflecting the diversity of nature, which Bacon so often called for. As Rees points out, Bacon continued to use Aristotelian terms, "substance" and "accident" (xxxix), including the concept of antiperistasis, "a violent reaction of one nature against a surrounding and contrary one" (300-01). But when Bacon rejected Aristotelian categories it was only to fall back on those from Paracelsian alchemy, announcing at one point that I shall make use of the chemists' terminology for explaining this for, were we to use scholastic terms we would only be stuck with scholastic meanings (189). By the same logic, Bacon is now stuck with alchemical meanings, namely their classification of matter into "three principles: sul- phur, mercury, and salt." Bacon is not sure what the Paralcelsian alchemists meant by salt (he is not alone), saying that "if they mean ash and earthy dregs, it belongs to the inquiry concerning vola- tile and fixed; but if they mean it in its literal meaning," he will deal with it elsewhere. At all events, Bacon pronounced Paracelsus's other two principles, "the sulphureous and mercurial," to be "the truly primordial categories of nature and the deepest schematisms of matter" (189-91)-but they were not his categories. Bacon also attacked the alchemists' "impostures" in claiming that they could make gold (273-4), but he was content to derive his own knowl- edge of "fulminating gold" from Oswald Croll and Basil Valen- tine (295). Bacon attacks Telesio's notion of the inseparability of light, heat, tenuity and motion (252-3, 336), but his ideas on light nonetheless draw on Telesio and Patrizi (333-4). Eclecticism is a common feature of Renaissance philosophy, but for Bacon, who so often proclaimed his independence from tradition and his radically new approach to nature and to scientific enquiry, this selective syncretism indicates a failure to develop a new and dis- tinctive system of his own. Rees's commentary helpfully explains some idiosyncratic Ba- conian ideas in natural philosophy, particularly his "pneumatic theory of matter" (which may seem an oxymoron): The remark that pneumatic bodies are weightless indicates that Bacon's conception of dense and rare is remote from the idea of specific gravity:</page><page sequence="14">REVIEW ESSAYS 157 weight or mass is not an intrinsic property of matter but an attribute which can be taken up or lost altogether, and pneumatic matter can convert tangi- ble matter, which has weight, into itself and so cause matter to shed that attribute (272). In a further note Rees explains how Bacon conceived this remark- able metamorphosis of matter to a 'weightless' state could come about, the key role being played by inanimate spirits: These spirits are air-flame compounds with the airy component dominant; the spirit therefore conspires with air to break out of its tangible prisons; in circumstances where the spirits cannot escape immediately they convert tan- gible matter into more spirit and then escape into the air, and that causes weight loss in the tangible bodies affected. The activities of inanimate spirits can be curbed by putting a barrier between them and the air (paint and other oily substances) or by keeping the bodies moist and soft (294). The ultimate effect of this volume, like that of the previous vol- ume XIII, containing Bacon's "Philosophical Studies c. 1611-1619," will be to modify our picture of Bacon's place in the history of science. Although Rees rightly emphasizes that Bacon both de- signed and executed many experiments, using newly-available scientific instruments (277, 283, 292, 330), he also draws atten- tion to Bacon's allegiance to beliefs which elude all theoretical verification, such as the spirits' power to convert tangible matter into a weightless substance. As Rees says, Bacon conceived that the limit of density would be found in "places beyond direct hu- man experience" (302), namely "the entrails of the earth," which "consisted of super-dense, immutable tangible matter" (273, 296), and the heavens. The "Provisional Rules" that Bacon formulated at the end of the Historia densi &amp; rari included these two deduc- tions: 5. No vacuum exists in nature, either collected or interspersed. 6. Between the boundaries of dense and rare there exists a fold of matter by which it can curl up and unwind itself without a vacuum. (163) Rees drily comments that, "like the collected vacuum, the myste- rious plica materiae is not actually discussed in the text at all. This plica or fold would apparently allow expansion and contraction to be explained without resorting to the vacuum hypothesis" (302). Such postulated natural processes, invisible and unverifiable, might be the equivalent in Bacon's natural philosophy of Descartes's vortices, a purely theoretical postulate which does not seem to have damaged Descartes's reputation. But they should certainly modify the crude picture that some people still have of Bacon as a random collector of facts who eschewed theory.</page><page sequence="15">158 REVIEW ESSAYS Rees hopes to bring about a more radical shift in our concep- tion of Bacon by ascribing to him, as he has been doing for some thirty years now, what he calls a "speculative philosophy," for which there are two revealing entries in the General Index: "empirical basis strengthened in Historia densi, xxxiv; centrality of, xli." Ref- erence to Rees's Introduction at these points gives no warrant for the indexer's entry: the former page merely says that the "Historia densi is an indispensable source" for "Bacon's theory of matter," while the latter recalls that Bacon's distinction between tangible and pneumatic is "crucial to the speculative philosophy ... mentioned earlier." Although acting without textual authority here, the in- dexer was certainly true to the general thrust of Rees's claims on behalf of this "speculative philosophy," which he has set up as a complete and alternative system over and against, so to speak, the philosophy of scientific method for which Bacon has been cel- ebrated. In 1987, outlining his plans, Rees argued that the Spedding- Ellis edition "had its roots in the intellectual soil of the 1830s," a period in which two "interrelated developments" occurred: first "an extraordinary narrowing of focus in Bacon studies," in which "commentators began to concentrate on Bacon's method ... al- most to the exclusion of everything else"; and secondly, "the emergence of philosophy of science as a distinct and formal area of discourse."23 Rees cites the valuable study by Richard Yeo of Bacon's nineteenth-century reception24 to argue that commenta- tors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were interested in the full range of Bacon's philosophy, including his develop- ment of an inductive methodology. However, I have never found any substantial evidence of an interest in scientific method in that period, and I am more inclined to accept the historical interpre- tation of Antonio P6rez-Ramos, according to which a rather dif- ferent narrowing of interest took place in the seventeenth century, when "Bacon's purported heirs in the early Royal Society closed ranks in a conspiracy of silence intended to engulf the by then unpalatable components of his thought,"25 that Paracelsian-alchemi- cal-vitalist-anthropomorphic hybrid which Rees has uncovered with 23 Rees, "Instauratio Instaurationis," 38-9. 24 Richard Yeo, "An Idol of the Market-Place: Baconianism in Nineteenth-Cen- tury Britain," History of Science, 23 (1985), 251-98. 25 Antonio PWrez-Ramos, "Bacon in the Right Spirit," Annals of Science, 42 (1985), 603-11, an important essay review of Rees and Upton's 1984 publication of the De Viis Mortis manuscript.</page><page sequence="16">REVIEW ESSAYS 159 such dedication. So Rees's quarrel ought to be with the Royal Society, not the Victorians. Bacon's positive significance to his seventeenth-century followers was established by Thomas Kuhn, who credited Bacon's concept of "natural and experimental his- tory" with having created a new area of scientific inquiry.26 Rees is probably right to connect the Victorians' interest in Bacon's inductive methodologies with the emergence of philoso- phy of science, but so far as I can see this was a new turn in Bacon studies, one which still provides our main reason for studying his work, and justifiably so, I believe. From this perspective it is un- derstandable that Spedding and Ellis should have placed the Novum Organum first, and that so many commentators, from Herschel, Mill and Whewell to Thomas Fowler, who produced a notable edition of that text in 1878 (revised 1889), should have treated it as the prime work on which Bacon's reputation rested. Rees, however, deplores their collective view that his "philosophical works were the primary constituent of Bacon's achievement or failure," and he comments with some ressentiment on the Novum Organum being given pride of place: that is the work which represents Bacon to the Victorian mind. That is the field on which the debates about Bacon's philosophical significance were fought out. The Spedding edition is a monument to the constricted 'Novum- organocentric' Baconianism mentioned earlier-though it should be said that Spedding himself was far less a prisoner of 'Novum-organocentrism' than his collaborator and friend of Whewell, Robert Ellis.27 In a parallel announcement of the new edition published in an English journal, Rees made a similar complaint about the Spedding- Ellis edition, in which "the philosophical works were taken to be the primary constituents of Bacon's endeavour," saying that "the edition testifies to the bloodless 'inductivist' Baconianism of its time."28 These loaded metaphors-"constricted," "prisoner," "blood- less"-express Rees's ressentiment, but provoke the counter response: what exactly is the "philosophical significance," to use Rees's terms, of the "speculative philosophy" as he has reconstructed it? One answer to this question has already been given by Antonio Perez-Ramos, author of (in my view) the most penetrating study 26 T. S. Kuhn, "Experimental vs. Mathematical Tradition in Western Science," The Journal for Interdisciplinary History, 7 (1970), 1-31; repr. in Kuhn, The Essential Tension (Chicago, 1977), 31-66. 27 Rees, "Instauratio Instaurationis," 42-3. 28 Rees, "A New Edition," 17.</page><page sequence="17">160 REVIEW ESSAYS of Bacon's natural philosophy in our time.29 Reviewing "Rees's overall claim," he expressed doubt as to "whether there can be any meaningful talk about Bacon's two philosophies as two dis- tinct and ... irreconcileably contradictory creations."30 For one thing, in De Viis Mortis Bacon used methods of collecting and evalu- ating evidence very similar to the tabulae presentiae absentiae et gradus in the Novum Organum (Book II, Aphorisms 11-13), including even the technical expression verificatio seu rectificatio.31 In addition to this "formal continuity" of method bridging the supposed gap between Bacon's two philosophies, P6rez-Ramos showed that De Viis Mortis also displayed other, far better known aspects of Bacon's thought, including "the mechanistic and materialistic tenor of what to him counts as an explanation in natural inquiry," and "the anti- scholastic stance." Another recent Bacon scholar has shown that some of the passages cited by Rees in his "misleading suggestion" of "two separate and contradictory philosophies" do not in fact support that theory.32 The other answer to Rees's claims concerns his complaint that "Bacon's philosophical significance" for the Victorians rested on the philosophy of science in the Novum Organum. No-one today would limit discussion of Bacon's philosophy to that work, but I would argue that his lasting significance for the history of science rests partly on his discussion of scientific method-which included "various trends of thought (deductive, inductive, analogical and others)""33-and partly on other large ideas, his insistence on the need for a purposeful, controlled collection of data, to be evalu- ated by experimental testing, the organization of science as a collective enterprise, the free exchange of ideas, and the applica- tion of knowledge for the benefit of humanity. Here, it seems to me, Bacon found his own voice, making an original and fruitful contribution to natural philosophy. His "speculative philosophy," expounded with such learning and fervour by Professor Rees over 29 Antonio P6rez-Ramos, Francis Bacon 's Idea of Science and the Maker's Knowledge Tradition (Oxford, 1988). o P6rez-Ramos, "Bacon in the Right Spirit," 609. 31 This phrase occurs three times in the Novum Organum (ed. Spedding and Ellis, I: 172, 268, 364), and in the De viis. As I pointed out in reviewing Volume VI of the Oxford Francis Bacon (Isis, 90 (1999), 117-19), in the 1984 edition of that text Rees added a footnote (on p. 196) indicating the connection, but in his 1996 edition (VI: 281) he omitted it. 32 Perez Zagorin, Francis Bacon (Princeton, NJ, 1988), 118-20.

As Rees candidly described the "speculative philosophy," The system was eclectic to a fault. It grew and matured as Bacon raided dis- parate traditions for attractive titbits which he refashioned as a curious hy- brid which embodied some very peculiar alliances of ideas (VI: xxxvii). (We note the approving metaphors there: "grew and matured.") Rees shows that Bacon evolved, in the course of his reading, "a theory of the structure of the universe based on Paracelsian cos- mogony with ideas about celestial motion derived from an Arab Aristotelian" (ibid.). Bacon may have purged his Paracelsianism of its occult elements, and reduced the tria prima to two, but it is still questionable whether his mechanistic treatment of the vaguely defined substances (or principles) "sulphur" and "mercury" could lead to any fruitful results. As for the Arab Aristotelian, al-Bitriiji or Alpetragius (fl. 1185-1217), Bacon first used his theories in the 1592 device Of Tribute,34 and retained them until the end of his life. However, some doubt persists as to whether Bacon ever read Alpetragius' Theorica Planetorum, published at Venice in 1531."5 In his mature treatise De Principiis atque originibus (ca. 1612), as Rees valuably showed, Bacon "credited Alpetragian kinematic principles" to Bernardino Telesio, whose opinions (apart from periodic mo- tion) were incompatible with the Arab's (VI: xxxviii). As Rees indicated, Bacon's error shows that he derived his knowledge of Alpetragius from Campanella's Philosophia, sensibus demonstrata (1591), published not long before he wrote Of Tribute. Bacon's use of "deutero-Telesian sources," as Rees aptly puts it, will be familiar to anyone who has observed Renaissance authors quietly appropriating arguments or even metaphors at second or third hand, indifferent to questions of textual integrity or the original language in which they were expressed. But that comment could never be made of Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, or Newton (apart from his alchemical work). Their systems did not derive from raiding "disparate traditions for attractive titbits" to be spatchcocked to- gether-nor did Bacon's reflections on scientific method, or the 34 See Vickers (ed.), Francis Bacon, 35. 35 See R. L. Ellis, introduction to Descriptio Globi Intellectualis, in Spedding and Ellis, III: 72.</page><page sequence="19">162 REVIEW ESSAYS organization of research, or the role of science in alleviating the miseries of the human condition. The "speculative philosophy" is a cut-and-paste job in which, as was inevitable in the commonplace book method, excerpta from exceedingly diverse works, written in various languages at various times, using vastly differing assumptions and conceptual categories, become contemporaneous one with another-for just as long as the excerptor uses them. Bacon's speculative philosophy is all too typical of this method, original only in its synthesis. But his other contributions to natural phi- losophy transcended this philological base, enunciating some important considerations for the conduct and organization of enquiry, and breaking fresh ground in what we now call "the logic of scientific discovery." If this was the Bacon discovered by the Victorians, then all credit to them, for it is still our Bacon. As one of our contemporaries recently put it, Bacon made no new discoveries, developed no technical innovations, uncovered no previously hidden laws of nature. His achievement was to offer an eloquent account of a philosophy and a method for doing those things ... . In our terms, Bacon was a philosopher of science-perhaps the first one who really mattered.36 To revert to Graham Rees's own criteria for a successful edition, I would say that the textual work in both volumes discussed here could not be improved on; the commentary is extremely helpful, if not faultless; Rees's translations are a let-down after vol. VI; and Rees's claims for the 'speculative' philosophy remain unconvinc- ing. Nonetheless, this is an extremely valuable edition, which all students of early modern science will want to see completed as soon as possible. 36 John Henry, Knowledge is Power.
