<plain_text><page sequence="1">Freedom and Bondage in All for Love Jack D. Durant IF DRYDEN'S ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA FAIL TO PROJECT THE "patterns of unlawful love" purported for them in the Preface to All for Love (73), the problem lies not in the playwright's preference of "eloquence" over "life," a disposition once assigned him by F. R. Leavis (158), but in the authentic vitality asserted by the two great lovers. We sense this vitality in part, of course, because the playwright exacts from us a sustained emo- tional sympathy for his characters. Their plight envigorates our feelings. But we feel their life the more keenly because we gain passage to the depths and honesty of their love and consequently experience with them the full terror of their internal conflicts. Immersed in the crises of their humanity, we have little inclination to see them as "patterns" of anything. What best opens access to the internal lives of Antony and Cleopatra is Dryden's practice throughout his play of associating their love with the experience of spiritual freedom and their fear of separation with the ex- perience of bondage. This practice embraces both literal and figurative expression in the dialogue and issues naturally and coherently from the thematic concerns of the play.1 By casting the conflicts in terms other than love, it communicates keenly, even to minds fully outside the love relation- ship, the torments of distressed lovers. At the beginning of the play, a sense of entrapment, entombment, and enslavement surrounds the action. Phocae, dolphins, and sea horses floun- der on the mud flats of the Nile; dead Ptolemies lie exposed in their graves; and faint-spirited Egyptians pay homage "in their servile hearts" to Octavius (1.1.46), who even now lays siege to Alexandria. To this enslaved people, and especially to their queen, Antony is himself a "slave" (1.1.361), and his old companion-at-arms, Ventidius, whose relationship to him is that of "friend, not slave" (1.1.102), has come to deliver him thence. Now fallen from his former glory, Antony lies "cramped within a corner of the world" (1.1.179); his only empire is the ground on which he lies, and, racked by melancholy, he indulges thoughts of himself "contracted" in his "narrow urn" and "Shrunk to a few cold ashes," the property of his bitter wife, Octavia (1.1.219-21). The impression of Antony as a man enslaved and confined permeates the first act of the play, and even as he accedes to the deliverance offered him by Ventidius, he displays a mind yet held in 20</page><page sequence="2">Jack D. Durant servitude: "Caesar shall know," he says, "what 'tis to force a lover /From all he holds most dear" (1.1.433-34; italics added). The second act immediately involves Cleopatra in these impressions of enslavement. Her opening colloquy with Alexas finds her awaiting every hour the "victor's chain" (2.1.9). With the presumed loss of Antony, she has "no more to lose," and she calls rhetorically upon Octavius to pre- pare her bonds (2.1.13): "I'm fit to be a captive," she says; "Antony /Has taught my mind the fortune of a slave" (2.1.14-15). On seeking Antony in Cleopatra's behalf, Charmion finds him "Incompassed round . . . with iron statues" (2.1.48). He refuses to see Cleopatra or hear her appeals, and Alexas likens his defensive conduct to that of "A fearful slave, who fain would turn away, /And shuns his master's eyes." "My life on't" he adds, "he still drags a chain along, /That needs must clog his flight" (2.1.89-92); could he speak plainly, he would call to Cleopatra for rescue: " 'Come to my rescue, Cleopatra, come; /Come, free me from Ventidius, from my tyrant'" (2.1.101-02). After ordering the march against Octavius, Antony sighs, "1 long to leave this prison of a town," and to Ventidius, he cries "Lead, my de- liverer" (2.1.146, 148). But Alexas forestalls this march with messages from Cleopatra. He addresses Antony with the phrase, "Your slave the queen," but Antony disallows the term "slave" and insists upon the opposite one of "mistress" (2.1.196-97). A bit later, during her second-act reunion with Antony, Cleopatra swears that years before she had given her person to Julius Caesar "as to a tyrant," surrendering to him only what otherwise he would have taken by force (2.1.354-58). Even then, she had loved only Antony; and for his part, Antony had deferred then to Caesar as his "lord," a man too great for him to rival (2.1.269-70). So persistent is the language of enslavement in the first two acts of All for Love that it comes to define the states of mind of Antony and Cleopa- tra. They feel themselves to be enslaved, and their plight issues not out of political crises but out of personal ones: each feels forsaken by the other. Before knowing himself observed by Ventidius in Act 1, Antony declares his desperation candidly: "I'm now turned wild, a commoner of nature, /Of all forsaken, and forsaking all" (1.1.232-33), and Cleopatra expresses similar urgency in Act 2: "and will he not forsake me? / Am I to live, or die?" (2.1.36-37). To be sure, Antony gives other reasons for his distress, the shame of losing Actium, remorse for a misspent life, aban- donment of fortune, but his essential indifference to these concerns comes clear when he learns of Cleopatra's fidelity to him. Then, he flies immedi- ately to her embrace, abandoning all thought of the "fortune, honor, [and] fame" to which Ventidius would restore him (2.1.428) and quoting derisively Ventidius's charge against Cleopatra: "'But, could she 'scape without me, with what haste / Would she let slip her hold, and make to shore, / And never look behind!' " (433-35). Antony and Cleopatra fear not the bondage threatened by Octavius but the bondage imposed upon them by separation. 21</page><page sequence="3">Critic 51:2-3 Once reunited, they are free indeed. The liberating force of their love derives, apparently, from the mu- tual servitude to which they have committed themselves. As we have seen, Cleopatra's relationship with Julius Caesar had not proved liberat- ing; it was the relationship of servant to master. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra, however, finds distinctiveness in the roles of ser- vice they both cast themselves in. When Cleopatra has Alexas represent her as the "slave"of Antony, he insists upon seeing her as his "mistress" (2.1.196-97); Antony is, in fact, her slave. And his conviction in behalf of this commitment, a commitment of mutual servitude, enables one of the most significant speeches in the play, the one in which Antony, flushed by his transient victory over Octavius and in the full vigor of his character, addresses Cleopatra in lyric terms: There's no satiety of love in thee; Enjoyed, thou still art new; perpetual spring Is in thy arms; the ripened fruit but falls, And blossoms rise to fill its empty place; And I grow rich by giving. (3.1.24-28) It was long ago suggested that the final line of this speech recalls the tribute made by Shakespeare's Cleopatra to her Antony: "For his bounty, / There was no winter in't: an autumn 'twas /That grew the more by reaping" (5.2.86-88). By putting the speech in Antony's mouth, however, and by altering the focus of the paradox, Dryden has shaped the line importantly to his purpose, for the phrase "I grow rich by giving" complements perfectly the motif of mutual servitude already established in the play. It implies freedom through service and characterizes an experience of the highest spiritual love. As an index to ideal marital love, it restates the paradox offered by Chaucer's Franklin in the preamble to his tale: "Heere may men seen an humble, wys accord; /Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord" (791-92). As an index to divine love, it recalls the anthropomorphic paradoxes at the close of Donne's Holy Sonnet 14: "Take mee to you, imprison mee, for I /Except you'enthrall mee, never shall be free, /Nor ever chast, except you ravish mee" (12-14). It even recalls the "Second Collect for Peace" surely familiar to Dryden through The Book of Common Prayer. "O God, which art author of peace, and lover of concord, in knowledge of whom standeth our eternal life, whose service is perfect freedom" (59).2 What Antony and Cleopatra have found, then, is a love attuned to spiritual paradox. It brings riches through giving, freedom through service. To feel it threatened is to experience bondage; to feel it restored is to experience liberty; and as it associates itself in the play with freedom and bondage, it communicates to us its intensity, depth, and vitality. This love, which lifts Antony and Cleopatra outside the range of com- mon human intercourse, demonstrates its effects with striking prominence 22</page><page sequence="4">Jack D. Durant in the third-act confrontation between Antony and Octavia. When at that time Octavia proffers Antony intercession with her brother, Antony recoils at the thought of begging pardon of an equal. "Shall I," he says, "who, to my kneeling slave, could say / 'Rise up, and be a king,' shall 1 fall down /And cry, 'Forgive me, Caesar'?" (3.1.276-78). He also recoils at the thought that Octavia, never forgetting her favors to him, might hold him always accountable to her brother and thus make him her "branded slave" (3.1.286). She assures him, however, that she values his honor as her own, that "it shall never be said, /Octavia's husband was her brother's slave" (3.1.293-94). Then she adds the following misconceived assurance: Sir, you are free- free, ev'n from her you loathe; For though my brother bargains for your love, Makes me the price and cement of your peace, I have a soul like yours; I cannot take Your love as alms, nor beg what I deserve. I'll tell my brother we are reconciled; He shall draw back his troops, and you shall march To rule the East: I may be dropped at Athens; No matter where, I never will complain, But only keep the barren name of wife, And rid you of the trouble. (3.1.295-305) This assurance exacts immediate resentment from Antony because it reveals to him how empty Octavia's understanding of freedom is. "You would free me, / And would be dropped at Athens; was't not so?" he asks disdainfully; and to her response, "It was, my lord," he answers, "Then I must be obliged / To one who loves me not, who, to herself, / May call me thankless and ungrateful man:- / I'll not endure it; no" (3.1.317-22). In Antony's experience, love is the source of freedom, not duty, and as he accedes to duty moments later, he does so as a vanquished captive: "I am vanquished; take me, /Octavia; take me, children; share me all." "This is thy triumph," he says to Octavia; "lead me where thou wilt; /Ev'n to thy brother's camp" (3.1.363-64, 371-72). Given his experience of the liberating force of love, Antony can share no meeting of minds with Octavia. With her is only bondage. Nor does sympathy really accrue to her. In his Preface to the play, Dryden apologizes for introducing Octavia in such a way as to dissipate the sympathy due the principal characters. "But this is an objection," he remarks, "which none of my critics have urged against me" (73). No such objection arises, because Octavia establishes no emotional identity with Antony. She maintains the haughty remoteness of a woman scorned and, despite his declared resentment, perseveres in the pious conviction that she brings him freedom. "He was a Roman," she says to Cleopatra, "till he 23</page><page sequence="5">Critic 51:2-3 lost that name, /To be a slave in Egypt; but I come /to free him thence" (3.1.422-24). This misconceived sense of freedom reveals the distance sep- arating Antony and Octavia; she so lacks the faculty of extending him sympathetic understanding that she forfeits sympathy for herself- certainly from anyone attuned to freedom as Antony knows it. Sympathy prevails for Ventidius and Dolabella because, in the case of Ventidius, loyalty to Antony is unswerving, and in the case of Dollabella, Antony's own misjudgments are abusive. But these friends as acutely mis- understand Antony as Octavia does. Both perceive excellence in Cleopatra, but neither really senses the liberating miracle she provides, the "truth / Beyond her beauty," as Antony phrases it (3.1.233-34). Ventidius, associ- ating love with slavery (as we have seen), persistently urges Antony to the Roman virtues, which offer only false freedoms; and Dolabella, while even- tually sympathetic to the dilemma plaguing Antony, proves but a shallow friend in sobering him to duties now enslaving to him, duties of age and dignity and public status (3.1.190, 199-200). Cleopatra stands comparably isolated from her counselor, Alexas, who lacks entirely an understanding of her "noble madness" (2.1.17) and, in suggesting that she fire Antony's jealousy, guides her to a stratagem she cannot execute. Cleopatra and her lover dwell quite outside normal human intercourse. Theirs is the freedom that comes of service, the wealth that comes of giving. Through experi- encing with them the exhilarations of their freedom, we sense a love that soars "quite out of reason's view" (2.1.21) and so transcends the claims of "Emperor!" "Friend!" "Husband!" and "Father!" (3.1.362-63). While dwelling outside customary human intercourse, however, Antony and Cleopatra show themselves similar to each other. Both of them, for example, lack the capacity for deviousness. Cleopatra sees herself as "Fond without art, and kind without deceit" (4.1.93). So true is her love that she can "neither hide it where it is, / Nor show it where it is not" (4.1.90- 91). Similarly, Antony, after aggravating Octavia's final departure, muses (with some alarm) upon his "plain, honest heart, / Which knows not to disguise its griefs and weakness, / But bears its workings outward to the world" (4.1.432-34). By the effects of his love, he is "made a shallow- forded stream, /Seen to the bottom" (4.1.438-39). The two lovers also hold in common an unwillingness to see their relationship shared. "Tell her, though we shall never meet again," says Antony to Dolabella, "If I should hear she took another love, /The news would break my heart" (4.1.37- 39); and as she looks upon the dead Antony, Cleopatra goes even so far as to say, "'tis better far to have him thus, /Than see him in ... [Octavia's] arms" (5.1.449-50). But even as they guard their relationship jealously, and perhaps because they are debilitated by it from deviousness, they share an acute sense of its tenuousness. Each fears betrayal and abandonment from the other. Consequently, Cleopatra sinks quite down when she hears Dolabella report (falsely) Antony's harsh judgments against her- "the blot 24</page><page sequence="6">Jack D. Durant of my own renown, /And bane of all my hopes" (4.1.165-66). She believes the report. And Antony all too readily believes reports of her infidelity with Dolabella. This sense they share of the tenuousness of their relationship suggests yet another attribute Antony and Cleopatra hold in common: the necessity of living always on two levels of consciousness. However transcendent their love, they yet stand vulnerable to the force of reason (or at least what masquerades as "reason" in the play). In persuading Cleopatra to aggravate Antony's jealousy, then, Alexas appeals to her on grounds of reason, and she participates with him in reasoning the efficacy of the stratagem: "I grant you," she says, "jealousy's a proof of love, / But 'tis a weak and unavailing med'cine" (4.1.74-75). With divided judgment, she accedes to Alexas's idea. Elaborate reasoning also confirms Antony in his decision to banish Cleopatra and Dolabella. Abused by Alexas's argument that Cleopatra has abandoned him because she entertains conscientious scruples in behalf of Octavia- an argument called "substantial reason" by Ventidius (4.1.367)- he fortifies his resolve with subtle thinking: "I can forgive /A foe, but not a mistress and a friend. /Treason is there in its most horrid shape, /Where trust is greatest" (4.1.543-46). Thus, as Anne Davidson Ferry has so forcefully demonstrated, logic, through the medium of words, intrudes upon internal quiet and scatters the trust transcending language (187).3 While privileged with a transcendent love, Antony and Cleopatra give ear to the clamor of "reason" and sacrifice freedom for bondage. One other testimony to the two levels of their consciousness is the ca- pacity for shame that yet penetrates the absoluteness of their love. Only moments after finding himself to "grow rich by giving" (3.1.28), for exam- ple, Antony tries to elude Ventidius, the force of whose virtue "awes" him (3.1.35); and, in her awkward interview with Octavia, Cleopatra obviously chafes to lack the name of "wife": "For I have lost my honor, lost my fame," she says, "And stained the glory of my royal house, / And all to bear the branded name of mistress" (3.1.463-65). The force of conventional virtue yet touches them both, just as the force of human weakness touches Cleopa- tra when she starts to apply the asp in Act 5: "Coward flesh, /Wouldst thou conspire with Caesar to betray me, / As thou wert none of mine?" (1.483- 85). But Antony and Cleopatra share a willingness to confront shame for their love, just as they share a willingness to confront death for it, and nothing testifies to its honesty and intensity so poignantly as their aware- ness of the claims yet made upon them by conventional virtue and mere humanity. As they return to "enslavement" in Acts 4 and 5, then, Antony and Cleopatra accede to attributes they hold in common. They cannot deceive one another, and they guard their relationship jealously, but they yet sense a tenuousness in it, and they yet stand vulnerable to the intrusions of "reason" and of conventional morality and human frailty. Quite naturally, 25</page><page sequence="7">Critic 51:2-3 Antony feels the harsher force of these intrusions. Conventional morality stirs in him his political and familial duties. His suspicions of Cleopatra and Dolabella find reinforcement, moreover, in the code of friendship by which he has persuaded himself that Dolabella's affection for Cleopatra is identical to his own: Tor 'twere impossible," he says, "that two, so one, /Should not have loved the same" (3.1.105-06). Much presumed evidence thus robs his mind of trust even when he senses the innocence of his victims (4.1.586- 87), and he commits himself to a mental servitude broken only with the false news of Cleopatra's death. "What lethargy has crept into your soul," asks Ventidius of him then, and he replies, "'Tis but a scorn of life, and just desire /To free myself from bondage" (5.1.266-67). Lacking all hope of reconciliation with Cleopatra, he can only seek freedom in death. At the time of her banishment from Antony, Cleopatra expresses her plight in terms of servitude: "Would you cast off a slave who followed you?" (4.1.563). Their separation means slavery to her as to him; and for her, as for him, freedom comes only through death. She therefore addresses the asp in appropriate terms: "Welcome, thou kind deceiver! /Thou best of thieves, who, with an easy key, /Dost open life, and, unperceived by us, / Ev'n steal us from ourselves" (5.1.473-75). By this key, she rejoins Antony and eludes Octavius, the tyrant who would send her captive to Rome. The motif of freedom and bondage thus persists throughout the play. Although the language of freedom and bondage is conventional to liter- ature, it rises to notice in only one of the English dramatic antecedents to All for Love: Samuel Daniel's Tragedie of Cleopatra (1594). There, Cleopa- tra, in praying to Antony (whose death precedes the action of the play), admits that she alone can effect her own reunion with him: "These hands must breake the prison of my soule /To come to thee," she says (4.1162- 63); and as she takes up the asp, she supplies Dryden with the very words he gives his Cleopatra at this same grim moment: "Therefore come thou, of wonders wonder chiefe, /That open canst with such an easie key /The doore of life" (5.1533-35). But Daniel's queen, who confesses that she had not sincerely loved Antony while he lived (1.147-54), knows nothing of liberation through love. Her main concern relative to enslavement- a con- cern she shares with the Cleopatras of Shakespeare, Thomas May, and Sir Charles Sedley- is that she not be taken captive to Rome.4 In Antony-and- Cleopatra plays before All for Love , the language of freedom and bondage serves mainly, in widely scattered instances, to reinforce political conflicts; in no case does it constitute a thematic or structural motif. If other playwrights offered no precedent, Dryden certainly found it in his own dramatic practice, however, for nothing so dominates the conflicts of his own earlier serious plays as the issue of freedom. Freedom becomes a central concern in The Indian Queen (1663) when Zempoalla finds herself enslaved by her passion for Montezuma while he, her captive, continues emotionally free. "Does he command in chains? what wou'd he do /Proud 26</page><page sequence="8">Jack D. Durant slave, if he were free, and I were so? / But is he bound ye Gods, or am I free?" she asks incredulously as the grip of passion takes her (3.1.34-36), and the irony of her situation never lets her rest.5 In The Indian Emper- our (1665), the choice between death and bondage takes special emphasis as Montezuma, facing the loss of his empire, rejects even the liberal gov- ernment of Cortez and the Spaniards: Tie keep my freedom, though my life I loose," he says (4.2.22), and he proceeds at last to honor his word.6 Freedom becomes the obsession of Maximin in Tyrannic Love (1669) when he discovers that his driving passion for Saint Catherine reduces him to emotional enslavement while she, who stands fettered before him, claims freedom through her unrelenting piety: "Such pow'r in bonds true piety can have," she boasts, "That I command, and thou art but a Slave" (3.1.96-97).7 The Conquest of Grenada (1670-71) turns wholly- all ten acts of it- on Al- manzor's struggles to regain emotional freedom after suffering enslavement to his passion for Almahide. "Restore its freedom to my fetter'd will," he pleads to her (Part 1, 3.1.358), but relief comes only through his blind acqui- escence (late in Part 2) to the puzzling decree of heaven, "Which bounds our Wills, yet seems to leave 'em free" (4.3. 144).8 Finally, Aureng-Zebe (1675) builds conflicts on the emperor's efforts to break his marriage bonds and pursue his passion for Indamora. "Chains that are dragg'd," he says of his marriage, "must needs uneasie prove: /For there's a God-like liberty in Love" (2.294-95). His efforts to free himself, however, simply deepen his enslavement to passion.9 What Dryden obviously perceived early in his career is that conflicts expressed in terms of freedom and bondage facilitate the dramatization of emotional and psychological crises, that in offering a versatile means of "imaging" the minds of dramatic characters, such conflicts assist what is "properly the work of the [dramatic] poet" (as Eugenius puts it in An Es- say of Dramatic Poesy [Ker 54]). In shaping the dramaturgy of his serious plays, then, he constantly explored the commonplace that if "freedom" (by which he clearly meant harmony within oneself) reflects the highest condi- tion of experience, then abridgments of freedom occasion immediate, and sometimes desperate, internal distress. By the time he wrote All for Love , he was eminently well schooled in the conflicts of freedom and bondage, not through earlier plays about Antony and Cleopatra but through his own committed practice. In All for Love , however, Dryden departed from his customary practice in two striking respects: he turned his conflicts on the agonizing loss of freedom rather than on the frenzied struggle to achieve it (or regain it), and he represented love as a liberating passion rather that an enslaving one. The tragedy of All for Love is that two individuals who through devoted mutual service have experienced freedom in its rarest and highest form must sacrifice it to the pernicious claims of false logic, conventional morality, and human frailty and must ultimately embrace death to escape bondage. 27</page><page sequence="9">Critic 51:2-3 Despite Dryden's claims for the didactic intent of All for Love- that "the chief persons represented were famous patterns of unlawful love; and their end accordingly was unfortunate" (Preface, 73)- critics have long sensed experiential effects in the play that override its declared moral. Bruce King theorizes that between finishing the play and writing the Preface, Dryden had moved from an affective view of tragedy to a fabulist one and so had minimized in his comments the sympathetic appeal of his play.10 Douglas Canfield analyzes respects in which the love of Antony and Cleopatra finds representation in the play as a genuinely transcendent love, one blessed by heaven for the constancy it achieves, and he validates this analysis by placing All for Love in a long tradition of constancy plays based upon the Antony-and-Cleopatra story.1 1 The language of freedom and bondage in All for Love certainly participates in the sympathetic appeal of the play; and in reflecting the paradox of divine love ("whose service is perfect freedom"), it communicates the transcendence recognized by Canfield.12 In every way, it heightens our sense of the tragedy as experience , enabling us, through our own apprehensions of freedom and bondage, to identify with the internal crises of the principal characters, to feel in an intimate and sympathetic way the desolation, exhilaration, urgency, and release possessing them by turns. Matured to Dryden's purpose by long years of tested dramatic practice, the motif of freedom and bondage endows his play with irrepressible vitality and force, and it represents a singularly important respect in which he shows the confidence, as he puts it in the Preface to All for Love (73), "to take my own measures, in aiming at the mark" of the Antony-and-Cleopatra story. Notes Several critics of the figurative language in All for Love complain that it fails to establish coherence within itself or to relate itself naturally to the themes of the play. See Leavis, 165; Kenneth Muir, "The Imagery of All for Love " Proceedings of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society 5 (1940): 147; Moody E. Prior, The Language of Tragedy (New York: Columbia UP, 1947), 210. Two studies recognizing coherence and thematic relevance in the imagery of All for Love arrive at diametrically opposed conclusions. They are Derek W. Hughes, "The Significance of All for Love" ELH 37 (1970): 540-63, which sees the world of the play fragmented by isolation, subjectivism, and instability, and J. Douglas Canfield, "The Jewel of Great Price: Mutability and Constancy in Dryden's All for Love" ELH 42 (1975): 38-61, which sees the play as celebrating the redemptive force of constancy in human relationships. 2The prayer continues unchanged to the present time. In his Commentary on the American Prayer Book , Marion J. Hatchett remarks that the phrase "whose service is perfect freedom" derives from a meditation of Saint Augustine of Hippo that "might be translated more literally, 'Whom to know is to live, whom to serve is to reign'" (126). 3 "The hero is helpless in the toils of Alexas' rhetoric, easily manipulated by the schemer's conventional verbal tools of flattery, distorted logic, and lies." Antony is "set apart from the world and yet acted upon by its powers" (Ferry 183). 4 In Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra (c. 1608), language relating to enslavement enters the play only in the fifth act and attaches itself to concern with Cleopatra's political future (5.2.52-53, 185-86, 237, 306-08). The dates of Thomas May's The Tragedie of Cleopatra 28</page><page sequence="10">Jack D. Durant Queen ofMgypt and Sir Charles Sedley's Antony and Cleopatra are 1626 and 1676, respectively. A play earlier than Daniel's, the Countess of Pembroke's Antonius (1590), concentrates on Antony's moral failings and does not address issues of literal or figurative enslavement. In "Alexas in All for Love: His Genealogy and Function," Howard D. Weinbrot argues that Dryden knew the plays by Daniel, Sedley, and the Countess of Pembroke. H. Neville Davies, in "Dryden's All for Love and Thomas May's The Tragedie of Cleopatra Queen ofMgypt" indicates that Dryden also knew the Thomas May play. In another article, Davies discusses "Dryden's All for Love and Sedley's Antony and Cleopatra " 5The main political conflict of this play, as symbolized in Zempoalla's dream (3.2.28-45), also engages the issue of freedom and bondage. The play ends when the lion of the dream (Montezuma) is freed from his bonds by the dove (Amexia). Here, too, as in all Dryden's heroic plays, much debate is given to the honorable terms of freedom. At 1.1.92-102, for example, Acacis considers whether or not it is honorable to accept freedom from Montezuma, the general who has captured him. Here and elsewhere, the concept of freedom is sifted very finely. 6 Love enslavements of the sort suffered by Zempoalla in The Indian Queen also figure in the psychological conflicts of this play: Cortez discovers that he brought freedom from Spain only to lose it to his love for Cydaria (1.2.363-64); Montezuma, smitten by Almeria, discovers that love has suddenly become the king's king (2.1.6); Guyomar and Odmar struggle constantly in the chains of their love for Alibech. Some sense of liberation through love comes at the close of the play when Guyomar and Alibech expect freedom, through love, despite the exile they must suffer. 7 Maximin provides an especially intricate study in the subtleties of freedom as, in trying to ease the emotional fetters clamped on him by Saint Catherine, he threatens the liberties of his wife and daughter and discovers their internal freedom to be inviolable: "You'l find it hard my free-born will to bound," says his daughter Valeria (4.1.605-06), but he never really learns this lesson. 8While Almanzor must learn in this play to subordinate his own freewheeling sense of freedom to the will of heaven, Almahide must disengage herself from the fetters of a cold and over-severe self-discipline, a thing she does only at the bidding of Queen Isabella in the closing moments of the play. In secondary actions, Lyndaraxa's manipulation of Abdalla and Abdelmelech is consistently expressed in terms of freedom and bondage, and in one scene, Boabdelin, Zulema, and Abenamar conclude that there is no such thing as political freedom: "Freedom in Subjects is not, nor can be," says Zulema, "But still to please 'em we must call 'em free" (Part 2, 1.2.43-44). 9 Here, as in Tyrannic Love , an absolutist emperor must confront the fact that real freedom has little, if anything, to do with political power. This time, however, the lesson is learned, and Aureng-Zebe's loyal service to Indamora is rewarded by a reformed emperor, who says to Aureng-Zebe, "Receive the Mistris you so long have serv'd" (5.671). 10See Bruce King's "Dryden's Intent in All for Love" In reflecting on his Antony and Cleopatra years later (in "A Parallel of Poetry and Painting"), Dryden remarks that Sophocles had given him a precedent for drawing tragic figures as they ought to be, "that is, better than they were." The moral "deformities" of Antony and Cleopatra, he writes, had been "cast into shadows, that they might be objects of compassion." See Ker, 2: 146. 11 See note 1 above. [Z'ri Paradoxia Epidemica: The Renaissance Tradition of Paradox, Rosalie L. Colie writes as follows about paradox as a means of expressing transcendence: "The genre and rhetoric of paradox, since it exists, like love, in order to conjoin disjunctive elements and states of being, and to elicit wonder appropriate to such states of being, are proper manipulations of the lame language by which men attempt to approximate their sensations of love's transcendence, whether that transcendence be momentary or eternal" (141).
