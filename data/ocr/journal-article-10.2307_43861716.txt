Price: $ 55.00 "Kuna Art and Shamanism," an interesting and useful ethnographic experiment applying current models from Amazonian anthropology to a Central American culture, explores the connections between art and ontology among the Kuna of Panama in terms of the relationship between Kuna shamans and their auxiliary spirits, which are rep- resented by carved wooden anthropomorphic figures ( nu - chukano). The author, Paolo Fortis, argues that categories he glosses as design and image are central to Kuna con- ceptualizations of the human person and to their percep- tions of the world. In the first two chapters of the book, dedicated to the author's life among the Kuna, to the human spaces for economic and ritual activities, and to the forest beings that cause illness, Fortis characterizes Kuna perceptions of the forest as a dangerous space filled with spirit danger, but also as a source of curing. Chapter 3 is devoted to the carving of the figures rep- resenting auxiliary spirits ( nuchukana ). Fortis shows that this activity is linked to the fertility of Kuna elders and to their ritual skill in dealing with ancestral tree entities. Through mastery of wood carving, a senior Kuna man can manipulate the powerful fertility of trees, transforming his own fertility and giving shape (life) to primordial entities. According to Fortis, a carver, conceptualized as a kind of male midwife, transforms part of a tree into a person, ex- tracting a baby nuchu from its arboreal mother. The next two chapters describe the life cycle of Kuna nele s or seers, focusing on their relationships with both human kin and nonhuman beings. Fortis places much im- portance on kurkin , the somatic and spiritual attribute giv- ing humans their destinies and spiritual powers, in the case of seers their ability to learn from cosmic entities and human beings. Thanks to his kurkin a nele has the ability to see into the invisible world, though this power must be maintained through medicines throughout his life. Chapter 6 develops the idea that for the Kuna, shaman- ism is closely linked to what it means to be human. He presents the concept of tarpakana , entities associated in dreams with nele' s auxiliary spirits. Through tarpakana a seer can establish contact with the animals and acquire secret knowledge from them. Fortis develops this theme through the analysis of a myth about the killing of the mother of eight Kuna mythic heroes and the comparison with similar myths from Amazonia. The final chapters consider the connection between carved figures and alterity, in part through comparison be- tween Kuna and Xinguano myths and ritual praxis. Chap- ter 7 ("Images of Alterity") focuses on the relationship between a nele and his tarpakana , on the initiation cere- mony for a young nele , and on myths about alliances be- tween humans and animals as a source of power against enemies. Fortis argues that in the Kuna case, these alli- ances ended with the transformation of animals into their current form and their separation from human beings. In chapter 8 it is argued that nuchukana are the instantiation of those primordial beings in present-day Kuna life. For him, wood carving is linked to the mythological attempt to bring the dead back to life. To understand what a nuchu for Kuna is, he considers the connection between "double of the dead" and "soul of the dead." The meaning of carv- ing a nuchu lies in its key role of mediating between hu- man beings and primordial souls. The carvings represent the first people who lived on the earth, who were trans- formed into trees before today's Kuna appeared. As such, they are the instantiation of primordial entities in the pres- ent-day Kuna lived world. They are generic images of a person and a body which is endowed with subjectivity. In this last chapter, Fortis further explores the definition of kurkin and the relevance of its design. Throughout the book, Fortis foregrounds three visual categories (body, image, and design) that inform and or- ganize the way the Kuna perceive their world. The différ- ences between designs (in, for example, mola blouses) and images (such as nuchukana) consist of visibility vs. invisibility, and human learning vs. creation during myth- ic times. This opposition between image and design, ac- cording to Fortis, constitutes the elementary structure of the Kuna visual system, the basic opposition through which they organize visual experience. In this context, the body provides the synthesis through which image and de- sign can coexist. "Kuna Art and Shamanism" makes a worthy contri- bution to recent discussions in the Amazonian literature about the link between designs, personhood, and the body. How far Amazonian models can be pushed so far from home, however, is open to argument. In the Kuna case one difficulty concerns animal entities, which are conceptual- ized not as ordinary animals, but as the spirit masters or kings of animal species. Also problematic is the alleged separation between animals and humans. Fortis argues that ancient culture heroes transformed animals and sent them to a separate domain; it could be argued, however, that even today human social life also includes animals and that thus the separation is partial or illusory. On some points of fact, Fortis differs with other sourc- es on the Kuna. In chapter 5, for example, he asserts that, although women may become shamans in adulthood, only males are marked for shamanism from birth, a claim con- tradicted by Nordenskiöld (E. Nordenskiöld et al., An Historical and Ethnological Survey of the Cuna Indians. Göteborg 1938: 80-89), among others. Perhaps most im- portant, the opposition between design ( narmakkalet ) and image ( sopalet ), fundamental to the book's argument, can be understood differently in the Kuna language ( dulega - Anthropos 109.2014</page><page sequence="2">280 Rezensionen ya). Narmakked also means "to write" and sobed, "to build, to construct, to brew, to draw." The opposition be- tween writing and drawing confounds any invariant asso- ciation of sopalet with internal forms and souls, and nar- makkalet with externalities and bodies.
