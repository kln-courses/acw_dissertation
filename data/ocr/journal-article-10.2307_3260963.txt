SHEPPARD Union Theological Seminary, New York, NY 10027 This analysis focuses on what may be a single stage of editing within the longer tradition history of so-called First Isaiah. My own particular assessment will describe features both in the aesthetic craft of redaction as well as in the redactor's ideological Tendenz with the purpose of refining the discussion of "context" and "meaning" in the book of Isaiah as a whole. This effort stands in continuity with recent endeavors by a number of scholars to show how editorial changes in the "context" of Isaianic traditions produced changes in their "meaning" for later readers.1 Therefore, my goal is both to contribute to the continuing tradition- historical analysis of the book of Isaiah and to clarify some of the hermeneutical factors implicit in any talk of "the context" of a scriptural literature presented in Isaiah's name. Since the pioneering study by S. Mowinckel on the redaction history of First Isaiah in 1933, numerous efforts have been made to recover the editorial process.2 Some points of consensus have been achieved, but one persistent area of debate that remains is how to evaluate the oracles 1 E.g., P.

Because Isaiah originally spoke of Assyria as the instrument in the hand of God to punish Israel, oracles predicting the destruction of Assyria in First Isaiah are usually attributed either to a change in the message of the eighth-century prophet and his disciples or to a redactional reworking of Isaiah's oracles in a later period.3 Most recently Hermann Barth has mounted a detailed case for a late seventh-century reinterpretation that introduced a message against Assyria into the original oracles of Isaiah.4 Though Barth's conclusions in certain cases are speculative, the argu- ment for an "Assur-Redaction" (AR) during the time of Josiah shortly before the fateful capitulation of Nineveh in 612 B.C.E. is plausible on general historical grounds and highly probable in the light of Barth's provocative investigation. An editorial technique he found behind the displacement of Isa 9:7-20 and 5:25-30 is, I hope to show, a characteristic feature of the AR and can explain two other dislocations in the Isaianic tradition of chaps. 1-39, namely, 5:15-16 from 2:6-21* and 3:13-15 from 5:1-7.5 Finally, I will discuss how these dislocations help to create a literary context out of once independent oracles or collections of oracles and how the AR continued to influence the potential meaning of the oracles in Isaiah 1-39 even after the formation of the canonical book of Isaiah. 3 For a position based on change in Isaiah's message, see Friedrich Huber, "Der Wandel Jesaja's von einer pro-assyrischen zu einer anti-assyrischen Haltung in der alttestament- lichen Forschung," in his Jahweh, Juda, und die anderen Vilker beim Propheten Jesaja (BZAW 137; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1976) 35ff. 4 Hermann Barth, Die Jesaja-Worte in der Josiazeit: Israel and Assur als Thema einer produktiven Neuinterpretation de Jesajauberlieferung (WMANT 48; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1977). R. E. Clements's recent studies on Isaiah draw heavily on Barth's thesis with minor modifications; see his Isaiah 1-39 (NCB; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980) 5-6; and Isaiah and the Deliverance of Jerusalem: A Study in the Interpretation of Prophecy in the Old Testament (Sheffield: JSOT, 1980). Barth's estimate of the "Assur- Redaction" (AR) can be seen as follows (material written by the AR is italicized) 2:1a, 7- 8a, 9a-17; 3:1-9a, 12-24; 5:1-13, 18-29, 30; 6:1-11; 7:1-20 [20bj3]; 8:1-8a; 9-10, 11-18, 23b-9:6; 9:7-18a, 18ba, 19a, 18b/3, 19b, 20; 10:1-3; 4b, 5-9, 11*, 12b-15, 16-19, 27b- 11:5; 14:4b, 5, 6 ("Verfolgtwerden"), 7-20a; 20b-21, 24-25a, 26-27, 28a, 29, 31-32; 17:1b-6; 17:12-14; 18:1-6; 20:1-6; 28:1-4, 7-22; 28:23-29; 29:1-7, 8; 29:9-10, 13-16; 30:1-17, 27-33; 33:1-4, 5, 8a, 8b-9*; 32:1-5, 9-14, 15-20. 5 If one grants that the similarities between these texts suggest textual dislocation rather than free editorial imitation of a familiar tradition, one might seek a purely text-critical explanation of them. Such is the case in Vinson A. Dearing's "A New Explanation for the Discontinuities in the Text of Isaiah 1-10," in The Critical Study of Sacred Texts (ed. W. D. O'Flaherty; Berkeley, CA: Graduate Theological Union, 1979) 77-93. Dearing argues for the hypothesis that a textual disturbance resulted from Isaiah's own attempt to preserve his original scroll by burying it during the time of Manasseh. Through natural decomposition (Dearing speculates), the sheets of the scroll might have fallen apart, only to be later reunited in incorrect order by Isaiah's later disciples. As will be evident, I find the redactional explanation, though admittedly still conjectural, more convincing. 194</page><page sequence="3">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 I According to Barth, the AR extends throughout most of Isa 2:1a-32:20, but its perspective is best seen in the carefully reworked material from 2: la to 14:27.6 Form-critically and in terms of content, 5:25-30 and 9:7-20 once constituted the same unit of tradition, originally segmented with the refrain "For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still" (5:25b; 9:11b, 16b, 20b). The displaced threat in 5:25-30 begins with a "therefore," lacks an invective, and seems redundant in context with the reasoned "therefore" of 5:24. Probably 5:25-30 belonged originally after the invective that lacks a threat at the end of 9:7-20. Although most scholars (Duhm, Marti, Fohrer, Eichrodt, Kaiser, et al.) view this disloca- tion of tradition as an accident occasioned by the insertion of the so-called Testimony of Isaiah (6:1-8:18, Barth's "Denkschrift") or by some other textual disturbance, Barth provides a more plausible account of it.7 Barth explains how the placement of 5:25-30 after the six woe oracles in 5:8-24 against the leaders in Jerusalem is a literary device used in the time of Josiah to direct the judgment in the original oracle of 9:7- 20 + 5:25-30 not only against the northern kingdom (cf. 9:8) but against the southern kingdom as well. The refrain mentioned above epitomizes this message of God's unrelenting wrath. The refrain, occurring once in 5:25-30 and three times in 9:7-20, could, thus, function as a resonating theme across the entire context of 5:8-10:4a, preceding a collection that consists primarily of oracles against Assyria and promises to Judah in 10:5ff. This self-conscious use of the refrain served both to frame topically the traditions, as we shall see, in 5:8-10:4 and, by the addition of it at the end of the woe oracle of 10:1-4a, to mark the transition from a woe oracle against Judah to the same against Assyria (10:5-11). Following 10:4, the judgment of God against Assyria makes only general reference to the same "hand" of God (11:11, 15; cf. 10:13a, 14a; 13:7a) until the AR material of 14:24-27. There the ideology of the AR is the most obvious. An incontrovertible "plan" (14:24) of Yahweh to destroy Assyria is announced. Even as the same irrevocable judgment that Isaiah announced to the northern kingdom was redactionally reapplied to the south, so the demands of divine justice are now extended to "the whole earth" and to "all the nations" (14:26). In a direct play on the earlier theme the redactors declare, ". .. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations. For the Lord of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?" (14:26b- 27). By expanding the horizon of Isaiah's earlier prophecies, pro-Josianic 6 Barth, Die Jesaja-Worte, 109-19. 7 Barth, Jesaja-Worte, 110-17, 116-61. Among the few other scholars who view the displacement of 5:25-29 as a "self-conscious" redactional move, see Joachim Becker, Isaias, 44ff., esp. 51. 195</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Biblical Literature reformists could ground the changing political and religious climate in the authority of the revered prophet's own ancient word. Barth's proposal can be strengthened by the observation that the dislocations of both the refrain tradition and the woe oracle collection form a precise double inclusio around the Testimony of Isaiah: Seven woe oracles against leaders in Judah Invective threats against Israel IV | Testimony of Isaiah , v 5:8-24 + 5:25-30 + 6:1-8:18* + 9:7-20 + 10:1-4 The use of a double inclusio or chiasmus as a device to include additional material with other traditions occurs at several places in the Hebrew Bible. For example, R. A. Carlson has shown for 2 Samuel 21-24 how the parallel stories of David caught in perfidy, remedied by appropriate repentance, alongside lists of Philistine war heroes bracket the king's song and last words, reminiscent of Moses' last song and blessing in Deuteronomy 32 and 33.8 George Landes has pointed to a similar inclusio which holds the thanksgiving psalm in its place in Jonah.9 The same device perhaps explains the placement of the Korah and Asaph psalms around two additional collections of David psalms after the collection of Psalms 3-42, with an appropriate subscription in Psalm 72 for an old collection that once ended with the royal psalm of Psalm 89.10 Therefore, the inclusio in Isa 5:8-10:4 reflects an editorial technique by which materials from separate collections are blended together or new material is inserted into a more commonly recognized collection. When the judgment of both Israel and Judah are set around the Syro-Ephraimite traditions of 6:1-8:18*, even Syria is put under the same "outstretched arm." This judgment against Syria adumbrates the universal implications of God's wrath and anticipates the declarations of 14:24-27 and the oracles against the nations in Isaiah 13-23. Perhaps because Barth assigns Isaiah 12 to some period after the AR, he does not discuss it. Notwithstanding, his work sheds light on the text since one finds there the only other direct play on the refrain "For all this his anger is not turned away." This hymn of praise begins with the declaration" for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away and you comforted me" (12:1). The phrase "your anger turned away" (this noun and verb together) occurs in Isaiah only here and in the refrain under 8 R. A.

Whether or not Isaiah 1 forms a programmatic introduction originally to Isaiah 1-12, Isaiah 12 clearly provides a retrospective synopsis of traditions in chaps. 2-11.11 For example, 12:2, "I will trust and will not be afraid, for the Lord God is my strength and my song .. ," depicts the people joyously accepting "in that day" (12:1a) the counsel of Yahweh, which Ahaz (7:4-9) and the people (8:11-15, esp. v 11b) had previously rejected. The phrase "proclaim that his name is exalted" (12:4b) recalls a refrain in 2:6-22 (viz., 2:11, 17). Indeed, this distinctive verb -Mt with a Niphal meaning "to be exalted" occurs only in these three places in Isaiah 1-12.12 Sometime after the AR, Isaiah 12 came to provide a fitting summarizing conclusion to Isaiah 2-11 before the oracles against the nations in chaps. 13-24. If Isaiah 12 is exilic in origin, then at least it is a late witness to the literary success of the AR. The resonances marked by dislocating part of a tradition with a distinctive refrain, followed by the AR's original play on this refrain in 14:24-27, systematized the traditions of Isaiah 2-11 sufficiently to invite a still later play on the same repeated formulas. In terms of the structure of the later book of Isaiah, the play in Isaiah 12 on the aforementioned refrain is followed immediately by the statement "and you comforted me" (12:1b). This expression of God's "comfort" of the people of Israel may have been utterly foreign to the message of eighth-century Isaiah but is obviously quite frequent in the work of "Second" and "Third" Isaiah.13 In other words, 12:1 is the only verse in Isaiah 1-39 that anticipates verbatim this same pivotal term emphasized at the beginning of Isaiah 40ff.: "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God."14 Consequently, Isaiah 12 summarizes key motifs of the AR and 11 Similarly, Ackroyd argues, "the placing of this psalm material at this point and the clearly indicated new start in xiii 1 invite us to look back over what precedes as a whole" ("Isaiah I-XII," 35). Ackroyd concentrates only on key "themes" in Isaiah 12 reminiscent of the preceding traditions (pp. 37-38): the Exodus theme in 12:2, 3, 5 resonates with 11:16; the Zion theme in 12:6 recalls its Isaianic precedents; the "themes of the sole exalta- tion of Yahweh and of acknowledgment of him and his deeds by the nations" depends directly on 2:6-22, less so on 2:2-4(5), 11:10, 11-16, and if 12:1b-2 is spoken in the first person by a king who recognizes the end to the divine anger and the impending restora- tion, then a connection is implicit with 9:1-6, 11:1-9, and "the whole structure of the section vi 1-ix 6." For other implicit literary connections, see L. Alonso-Schokel, "Is. 12: De duabus methodis pericopam explicandi," VD 34 (1956) 154-60; and R. Lack, La symbolique du livre d'Isaie: Essai sur l'image litteraire comme element de structura- lisme (Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1973). Lack sees links between 12:2, 4, 5 and 2:6ff.; 12:3 and 8:6ff.; 12:6 and 6:11. 12 A Piel form of the verb occurs in 9:10,"raise up adversaries." Outside of Isaiah 1-12 a usage similar to that of 12:4 occurs only in 33:5; otherwise God is not its subject: 26:5; 30:13; 25:12; 33:16. 13 Isa 40:1; 49:13; 51:3, 12, 19; 52:9; 54:11; 57:18; 61:12; 66:13. 14 The only other occurrences of this verb in conceivably Isaianic material are 1:24 and 22:4. In the former, the verb is an idiomatic expression, "to avenge oneself of"; in the 197</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Biblical Literature points to a still future time after God's "anger turned," when "you com- forted me" (Isaiah 40ff.) in exile. In sum, we see a redactional device employed probably by the AR with specific characteristics. The editors chose a tradition with a refrain distinctive enough to create literary resonance when part of it was dis- placed. This resonance, along with the displacement of the woe oracles, formed a double inclusio so that the Testimony of Isaiah was joined into one context with later anti-Assyrian traditions. The literary effect was further marked by the redactional insertion of the same refrain after the woe oracle of 10:1-4a and by the direct play on the refrain in 14:24-27. The refrain, therefore, became a marked repetition in the text, a leading theme throughout the context of 5:8-14:27*. This same theme scored the movement of God's threat against the leaders of Jerusalem, against the northern kingdom and Syria, and, finally, with universal implications, against Assyria. Only later was Isaiah 12 inserted to anticipate the end of God's judgment by a retrospective synthesis of themes in the Isaianic tradition, including a play on the key theme of the AR in 12:1b. II Another candidate for evidence of the AR's redactional displacement of tradition is 5:15-16 and 2:6-22*. Isa 5:15-16 reads: v 15 Man is bowed down, and men are brought low and the eyes of the haughty are humbled. v 16 But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness. Although the alien character of these verses in the middle of the woe oracles and their striking resemblance to the threats of 2:6-22 are recog- nized by most critical scholars, their date and literary relation to this same tradition in Isaiah 2 are highly disputed. B. Duhm explained their position by the theory that a collector who possessed chap. 5, without the traditions in Isaiah 2, indicated in the margin a four-line approximation in order to preserve what he did know of these other Isaianic oracles.15 Later, he claims, this annotation inadvertently entered the text. Against his view of an accidental dislocation of the text is the evidence of an intentional placement of it after the claim that "the nobility" of Jerusalem "will go latter, the prophet tells those around him to offer no comfort in his remorse over the de- struction of Jerusalem. The latter, 22:1-4, probably belongs to the period of the Senna- cherib invasion of 701 B.C.E. See Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 182-83; B. S. Childs, Isaiah and the Assyrian Crisis (SBT 3; Naperville, IL: Allenson, 1967) 22ff.; and Otto Kaiser, Isaiah 13-39 (trans. R. A. Wilson; OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1974) 136ff. 15 B. Duhm, Jesaia, iibersetzt und erklirt (HAT 3/1; 2d ed.; Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1902) 36-37. 198</page><page sequence="7">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 down" (rn', 5:14b) to Sheol (v 14a). Verse 15 piles up related verbs to describe the "humbling," "bringing down," and "lowering" of the people with "haughty looks." Therefore, the concept of God's bringing the lofty down serves as a Stichwort connection between 5:14 and 5:15-16. Verse 15 adds the assurance that God, in contrast, "ascends in justice," a thought that offsets the consistently destructive theme of these woe oracles with the counterpoint of God's exaltation already familiar from the repeated refrain in 2:6-22.16 The alternative views to Duhm's textual theory regard these lines either as the product of a later interpretation of 2:6-22* or as a redactional displacement from a longer version of it.17 H. Barth assigns 5:15-16 to his latest stage in the postexilic period as an editorial interpretation. Since he does not discuss these verses in detail and defends this dating solely by the verses' sharing the idea of God's impending judgment, his case is not rigor- ously put forward.18 Clements similarly considers 5:15-16 to be redactional but recognizes that Isa 2:9, 11, 17 "may be quite intentionally alluded to by the redactor here."19 Conversely, O. Kaiser, like T. K. Cheyne long before, proposes that "traces of the redactor's work are also to be found in the displacing of vv. 15 and 16, which belong after 2:21."20 A reinvestigation of the evidence, together with the recognition of displacement as an editorial device employed in the AR redaction, makes more probable the position of Kaiser that 5:15-16 originally belonged to 2:6-22*. A close comparison of 5:15 with the material in 2:6-22 shows a verbal dependence that seems unnecessarily wooden and contextually undigested for a redactional invention. The opening phrase of 5:15, "Man 16 For the recognition of this contextual reading, see Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 64; F. Delitzsch, Commentary on Isaiah (4th rev. ed.; Edinburgh: Clark, 1892) 1. 161; and V. Herntrich, Der Prophet Jesaia: Kapitel 1-2 (ATD 17; Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1950) 84-85. 17 We must also recognize that 2:6-22 may not have been preserved free of redactional activity. For instance, Clements offers evidence that vv 18-19 could come from an exilic redactor who influenced texts in a similar manner elsewhere (see Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 42-43; and his "The Prophecies of Isaiah and the Fall of Jerusalem in 587 B.C.," VT 30 [1980] 421-36). Clements thinks that the original Isaianic unit can be found in 2:10, 12- 17. Barth (Die Jesaja-Worte, 222-23) claims that vv 9b, 20-21, 22 are "aus Griinden der Form, des Aussageduktus und des Inhalts" most clearly exilic or postexilic; everything else about their redactional reworking is without consensus. In his own reconstruction, the Isaianic material in vv 10 + 12-17 and 7-8a, 9a (fragmentary) is combined early with the redactional piece vv 7-17*. In the exile vv 6a,/b, 8b, 18-19 and then v 6aa were added; still later, vv 20-21, 9b, 22. Kaiser observes that since "the beginning of the great poem on the day of Yahweh has been so distorted . . . , attempts at restoration are conjectural" (Isaiah 1-12 [trans. R. A. Wilson; OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1972] 32). 18 Barth, Die Jesaja-Worte, 292-94. 19 Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 64. 20 Kaiser, Isaiah 1-12, 65; T. K. Cheyne, The Prophecies of Isaiah (New York: Thomas Whittaker, 1888) 33. 199</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Biblical Literature is bowed down and men are brought low," is identical to 1:9a, not disputed as Isaianic. The second half of the same line in 5:15 is verbatim from 2:1 la with a change only in the aspect of the verb. Though there is evidence of several other loose redactional plays on these same themes in Isaiah 1-39, only 5:15 and 29:4 use the root nntr ("to be bowed down"). Moreover, the assertion that "the Lord of hosts is exalted (n^=1) in justice" is remarkably close to the repeated "the Lord alone will be exalted (=A31) in that day" (2:1 la, 17b). This phrase in 5:16b is the only other occasion in Isaiah where God is described as "elevated" or "exalted," using a finite verb. Furthermore, the use of the =v in reference to God, as in 2:11, 17, occurs elsewhere in Isaiah 1-39 only in 12:4, as already discussed, in a retro- spective synopsis of the traditions in Isaiah 2-11, and once in 33:5, which most commentators regard as exilic or later. Therefore, in contrast to other more flexible editorial plays elsewhere in Isaiah on themes in 2:2-11, the unit preserved in 5:15-16 seems abrupt and self-contained, hinged to its present context only by a Stichwort connection. Contingent upon our viewing of 5:15-16 as a displacement of a unit of tradition from 2:6-22, we may ask how the unit might have originally appeared. Two options are immediately plausible. If we follow Barth's reconstruction, then the pre-AR tradition in Isaiah 2 begins suddenly with an indefinite antecedent: "Their land is filled with silver and gold. . ." (2:7a). Beginning this hypothetical pre-AR tradition with 5:15-16 resolves this tension and would produce a perfectly symmetrical piece with the same refrain at the beginning, the middle, and the end. The original tradition might look like the following: 5:15-16 Man is bowed down, and men are brought low and the eyes of the haughty are humbled. But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice, and the holy God shows himself holy in justice. 2:7 Their land is filled with silver and gold and there is no end to their treasures; Their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots. v 8* Their land is filled with idols v 9* So man is humbled, and man is brought low- v 10 Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from before the terror of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty. v 11 The haughty looks of man shall be brought low and the pride of men shall be humbled; v 12 For the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up and lofty v 13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan; 200</page><page sequence="9">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 v 14 against all the high mountains, and against all the beautiful craft. v 17 And the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall be brought low; And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day. If one retains 12:6 as original, contrary to Barth, this arrangement would work as well if not better. A second possibility might be to follow O. Kaiser's suggestion that 5:15-16 originally followed at the end of 2:6-22. If so, then 5:15-16 still helped to maintain the repetition intrinsic to the larger construction but also provided justifiable poetic variation at the close of the piece.21 The result would be to move the threats within the body of the tradition into a final register of theological vocabulary about the holiness, righteousness, and justice of God who is exalted while all the multitudes of self-promoting humanity are reduced to hiding in the dust (2:10), caves (2:19, 21), and holes in the ground (2:19). Returning to matters of editing, we recall the already described editorial device employed by someone associated with the AR at the crucial point of organizing the traditions in 5:1-14:27*. It is characterized by the displacement of a once unified tradition in order to create resonance between parts of a collection and, therefore, to subordinate all these traditions under that same motif or theme. Later allusions from the AR to this redactionally achieved resonance marked it linguistically and extended the range of tradition under its interpretive influence. When we examine the role of 5:15-16 in the collection, it conforms remarkably to this pattern with the same utilitarian benefit of linking diverse traditions together into a common context. According to Barth, Isa 2:6-22* is the first tradition (the promise oracle of 2:2-4 being added later) in the AR which runs from Isa 2:1a to 32:20*. The present reassessment suggests that 3:15-16 is a refrain that has been editorially displaced from Isaiah 2 and located on the other side of the pivotal Song of the Vineyard (Isa 5:1-7). By this means the editors of the AR topically linked the separate collections of oracles in Isaiah 2-3 with the construction of 5:1-14:27*; Isa 5:15-16 was located at the only place in the double inclusio before the Testimony of Isaiah which depicts humanity (here, "the nobility," 5:14) "going down," even to Sheol. The motifs of the high and lofty who are brought down while God is exalted is, thus, extended into the tradition of 5: ff. and gains sufficient repetitive momentum that a reader might even hear it again when the Testimony starts with the words "In the year that King Ussiah died I saw the Lord 21 D.

Freedman has recently reminded me that a modification of a key repeated expression at the end of a unit of tradition is a frequent rhetorical feature in Hebrew poetry in the prophets. 201</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Biblical Literature sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up . .." (6:1; cf. 57:15)!22 Here too the exaltation of God and the vindication of God's holiness and righteousness accompany the "outstretched arm" of judgment. Just as the previous displacement of 5:25-30 from 9:7-20 was also accompanied by new potentially AR material in 14:27 on the same theme, Isa 10:33-34 offers a fresh interpretation of a fixed cluster of motifs associated with Isa 2:6-21* and 5:15-16. Although Barth regards Isa 10:33- 34 to be pre-AR, I think, with Clements, that it is probably a part of the AR redaction and, thus, belongs to the same redaction responsible for 14:24- 27.23 Isa 10:33-34 continues (cf. 10:5ff.) God's threat now addressed to the Assyrians cast in language familiar from Barth's own formulations of what he calls the AR. The text reads, v 33 Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the great in height will be hewn down, and the lofty will be brought low. v 34 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall. From an editorial perspective, Isa 10:33-34 as a whole appears to summa- rize 2:12-17. The "Lord of Hosts" (10:33a; cf. 2:12a) will hew down the lofty bough, including those of Lebanon (10:33a, 34; cf. 2:13). While the mere portrayal of God destroying the forests can be found at various points in literature, the more abstract expression, "the lofty will be brought low (10:33b)," for example, recurs in Isaiah 1-39 only in the displaced tradition we have been discussing (2:9, 11, 12, 17; 5:15 [twice]) and once in an exilic passage, 26:5, which plays upon this and other motifs from Isa 2:6-21* and 5:15-16.24 Isa 10:33-34, therefore, probably belongs to the same redaction program and reinforces the marked resonance which the editors achieved for the purpose of creating a single context thematically, which could hold differing collections together.25 If we turn from this redaction and look for still later, post-AR appro- priations of this same resonating set of motifs, we find two overt references, in 25:12 and 26:5, and perhaps three allusions, in 13:11b, 29:4 and 30:18- 26. For our purposes the first two texts are the most significant and the easiest to date. They both belong to the so-called Apocalypse of Isaiah in 22 Cf. Isa 60:14. Other texts that directly allude to 2:6-22 are 10:33-34; 25:11-12; 26:5; 29:4; and 30:18-26. 23 Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 120-21. 24 On the imagery of cutting down the forest, see, e.g., 32:19, with a theme that is cer- tainly also implicit in 2:13. The only other text close to this formulation in 10:33 is found in 13:11, but the vocabulary describing the ones who fall is entirely different from that of 2:6-21* and 5:15-16. 25 Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 120-21. 202</page><page sequence="11">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 Isaiah 24-27. These chapters follow the oracles against the nations in Isaiah 13-23, are replete with quotations and allusions to earlier Isaianic prophecies and other prophetic books, and must be regarded among the latest traditions to be included into Isaiah 1-39. H. Wildberger already lists many of the allusions to earlier Isaianic prophecies found in Isaiah 24-27, but Isa 25:12 and 26:5 clearly should be added to his evidence.26 The resemblances between these two texts are so close that Kaiser suggests that 25:12 derives from 26:5.27 In any case, 25:12 is, as Ewald and Cheyne first recognized, an addition, one that builds upon the statement in v 11b that God will "lay low his [Moab's] pride" (cf. 13:11).28 Kaiser has already observed that "the choice of the verbs is reminiscent of 2:6ff. (cf. 2:9, 11, 17)."29 We have noted that except for these two texts in the Apocalypse of Isaiah and the other case that we argued belongs to the anti-Assyrian redaction, all six other occurrences of the expression that God will cause "the lofty" (from cii or n:i) "to fall" (fStt,) are found in 2:6-21* and 5:15- 16. Except for the case of 29:4, which I consider to be an allusion to the same, all the occurrences of the verb nnt in Isaiah 1-39, as in 26:5, belong exclusively to the tradition displaced by the AR (cf. 2:9, 11, 17; 5:15).30 Furthermore, the expression in both 25:12 and 26:5b that the lofty are cast down "to the earth" ("n'), epexegetically, "to the dust" (1Pw), is an unusual combination occurring elsewhere in the book of Isaiah only in 2:10 and 2:19 (cf. 2:21).31 Finally, the statement that "high fortification of your walls he will bring down" in 25:12 is not a common formulation in the OT. In the book of Isaiah one finds reference either to "fortified walls" (nin~ ,rnntz) or to their fall elsewhere again only in 2:15b. Although the expres- sion "fortified city" with this same adjective is familiar, this combination does not occur elsewhere in the biblical literature except in Jer 15:20 and Deut 28:52 (cf. Isa 22:10). Therefore, 25:12 and 26:5 represent a later engagement with resonance across differing collections, which originated in the earlier AR. This evidence, together with possible allusions to Isa 2:6-21* and 5:15 later in 13:11b, in 29:4 and 30:18-26, points to the influential employment by the AR of the same editorial device of displacing tradition that Barth 26 Hans Wildberger, Jesaja (BKAT 10; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1972) 2. 910- 11. 27 Kaiser, Isaiah 13-39, 204; similarly, Duhm (Jesaia, 154) regards 25:12 as belonging with 26:5 "als Variante dazu." 28 Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 211; Duhm, Jesaia, 154; Cheyne, Isaiah, 152. 29 Kaiser, Isaiah 13-39, 208. 30 In Isaiah 40ff. it occurs only once, in 60:14, which shows no direct allusion to the earlier Isaianic tradition. 31 The only two other references to "dust" are in 26:19, "dwellers in the dust," and in 29:4, which I have already mentioned as a possible allusion to Isa 2:6ff. All the other occurrences of the word in Isa 40:1ff. are free usages and show no dependence on Isa 2:6ff., cf. 47:1; 52:2; and 65:25. 203</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Biblical Literature identified for 5:1-14:27.32 As in the case of 14:24-27, which was a play within the AR upon the resonating theme marked by a displacement of 2:25-30 from 9:7-20, we saw that 10:33-34 reflects once again the application to Assyria of a theme scored across the traditions by the displacement of 5:15-16 from 2:6-21*. Later plays on this refrain in the so- called Apocalypse of Isaiah, and possibly looser allusions in 13:11b, 29:4, and 30:18-26 point to a still later retention of these marked redactional themes. This evidence also supports Barth's view, contra Clements, that the full AR started with 2: a rather than 5:1.33 The use of a specific redactional device further explains the order of the traditions by an appeal both to the craft of editing and to certain emphases guaranteed by placing one tradition or displaced part in front of another. III A third candidate for a redactional displacement of a single tradition is Isa 5:1-7 and the fragment 3:13-15. Barth offers no discussion of these texts but locates them among Isaianic material combined with other traditions around the Testimony of Isaiah in a pre-AR collection, perhaps around 701 B.C.E. Isa 3:13-15 reads: The Lord has taken his place to contend, he stands to judge his people.34 The Lord especially enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people. It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your house. What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor? says the Lord of Hosts.35 Both form and content indicate that these verses did not originally belong in their present context. From the standpoint of the redaction, scholars have long noted a Stichwort connection between "his people" of vv 13-14 and the twice repeated "my people" in the preceding verse. The frag- mentary character of the oracle makes it difficult to interpret as we now 32 Isa 30:18-26 is probably from the exilic period and has an unusual number of concep- tual parallels with 2:6-21* and 5:15-16; v 18, graven images, cf. 2:8, 20; v 25a, "(every) lofty mountain and (every) high hill," occurs in Isaiah elsewhere only in 2:14; and v 25b, "when towers fall," cf. 2:15. Isa 29:4 may be pre-AR, perhaps reflecting the typical vocab- ulary of the early Isaianic school. The combination of "dust" and "earth" appears here in tandem much as it does in 25:12, 26:5b, and 2:10, 19. The rare use of nnrl recalls 2:9, 11, 17 and 5:15, with other occurrences in Isaiah only in 26:5 and 60:14. 33 Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 42-43. 34 Concerning the textual problem of the MT rDtV, see Joachim Becker, Isaias, 48-49. 35 The 3"iK is probably secondary. Though the entire last phrase is omitted in the LXX, the formula is common in Isaiah (17:3, 6; 31:9; 30:1). Cf. Wildberger, Jesaja, 1. 62-63, 131.. 204</page><page sequence="13">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 have it.36 After a familiar introduction in 3:13-14 for a lawsuit, one finds with a transition an "indictment before a judgment (Anklagerede von Gericht)."37 However, the opening words of the indictment, "It is you!" or "Indeed you!," take the form of a disputation since they presuppose both that the hearers blame some other cause for the spoiled vineyard and that these hearers, who are thus indicted, are at the same time the judges.38 But these verses do not contain a juridical parable, in which such language is commonly found. Finally, the rare use of the metaphor "vineyard" in Isaiah's extant oracle, without any clarification, leads Wildberger to speculate that Isaiah's figural usage of this term must have been common knowledge.39 This explanation is not entirely satisfying since outside of Isa 3:13-15 and 5:1-7 the term "vineyard" recurs as such a metaphor only in a late play on these same traditions, in 27:2-4.40 In addition to features that suggest that 3:13-15 is a fragment from another longer unit, one finds some striking resemblances between these verses and those of 5:1-7. Within traditions from eighth-century Isaiah only these two texts speak of a "vineyard" in this metaphorical sense. Both texts portray this vineyard as "devoured" ('wz).41 Both texts have to do with judgment (cf. 3:13-14 and 5:3), based on the condition of the vineyard. Consequently, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that 3:13- 15 might have belonged somehow with 5:1-7, particularly since we can account for such a dislocation as an editorial device employed at two other places in order to create a larger literary context for once independent oracles or oracle collections and to apply a theme of judgment against Judah now to Assyria. The difficulty of attaining a single convincing form-critical analysis of Isa 5:1-7 further hints at a possible disturbance in the original piece. The two major options seem to be either to treat the present piece as some type of "love song" which becomes a legal complaint against Israel or to regard the text as a juridical parable.42 If one emphasizes 5:1b-2 as a love song, the 36 With his usual directness, B. Duhm (Jesaia, 25) observed, "wohl nur ein Briichstuck, es fehlt ein Darum!" 37 Wildberger, Jesaja, 1. 131. 38 Ibid., 1. 134. 39 Ibid., 1. 132-33. 40 Six occurrences in 5:1-7, elsewhere in the book of Isaiah in 1:8; 5:10; in the plural 16:10; 32:15; 36:17; 37:30; 61:5; 65:21. 41 Following the informal suggestion of Baruch Levine, I grant that the verb P3= in v 14 might have originally meant "trampled" or "brutishly trod upon" in a denominative sense from 'IP instead of the usual "burn," "consume," (RSV) or "eaten up" (JPS). The parallelism in Isa 5:5, where the same use of the verb recurs, seems to confirm this read- ing. Cf. Clements's Isaiah 1-39, 50. One might agree that the original sense was possibly "to trample" but that later "inner-biblical" interpretation took the same verb in its other usual sense of "to burn," cf. 9:17(18) and 10:17. 42 Cf. J. T. Willis, "The Genre of Isaiah 5:1-7," JBL 96 (1977) 337-62; Adrian Graffy, 205</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Biblical Literature identity of "my beloved" (5:la) remains ambiguous. On the one hand, H. Schmidt, K. Budde, and G. Fohrer view the song as sung by a bride to her bridegroom. Wildberger challenges, reasonably, that a bride would not sing such a "love song" in the first place and, in any case, the "I" of the song is identified in v 3 with the keeper of the vineyard.43 On the other hand, Wildberger follows the lead of A. Bentzen in order to argue that the singer is the "friend of the bridegroom," a technical expression familiar from later rabbinic Hebrew to mean the go-between and arbitrator for the bridegroom. Prior to the marriage, the bride and groom could not be in contact, so the services of the friend of the bridegroom could be available even to offer a public complaint against the bride. Following Bentzen, Wildberger regards the sentence of vv 5-6 to mean that the faithless lover will bear no children in her family. Hence, Isaiah maintains a double pseudonymity: he speaks supposedly for a friend but conceals the identity both of Yahweh as that friend and of the listeners, who, by condemning the faithless lover, pronounce judgment on them- selves.44 This explanation has several difficulties of its own. For one to interpret the Song of the Vineyard as really the groom's indictment of his bride translates one metaphor into another without any explicit warrant in the text's own interpretation in 5:5-6. Why would the "friend of the bride- groom" make his indictment so extensively metaphorical? Even the shift from the voice of someone speaking on behalf of a friend in 5:1a to the first person voice of the friend himself in v 3 works against such a thesis. However, a strict interpretation of 5:1-7 by itself as a juridical parable confronts other difficulties. A recent article by Gale A. Yee illustrates the possibilities and limitations.45 I think she correctly assesses the present text as a mixed form, both a song and a juridical parable, similar to Deuteronomy 32, which is both a song and a covenant lawsuit. However, when she tries to identify the various parts by comparison with other juridical parables in the Bible (e.g., 2 Sam 12:14; 14:1-20; and 1 Kgs 20:35-43), Yee recognizes some unresolved form-critical problems in her analysis.46 For example, she acknowledges that in the other juridical parables the sentence always comes at the end after the indictment and the interpretation. Since the whole point of a juridical parable is that the ones hearing unknowingly judge themselves, the sentence cannot arbitrarily precede the parable's interpretation. However, in the present order of Isaiah 5 the sentence of 5:5-6 occurs before the interpretation of v 7.

Long, "The Stylistic Components of Jeremiah 3,1-5," ZAW 88 (1976) 387. 206</page><page sequence="15">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 Moreover, Yee's description of 5:3 as "judgment" has problems since it is really an invitation for the people of Judah to judge, not a record of their response like that found in the three other juridical parables (cf. 2 Sam 13:5; 14:8-11; 1 Kgs 20:40b). Despite these limitations, there is still sufficient evidence of parts of a juridical parable in Isaiah 5 to attract some such analysis. My own proposal is that the mixed form of Isa 5:1-7 is the result of a breakdown in the original unit because of a redactional dislocation of a part of it to 3:13-15. If one returns this fragment to Isa 5:1-7 the original juridical parable could be reconstructed in typical form as follows: Juridical My friend had a vineyard . and he Parable: looked for it to yield normal grapes, but it 5:1b-2 yielded bad grapes. Judgment: (Implied as an activity of the listening audience) Interpretation: The Lord has taken his place to contend, he 3:13-14 stands to judge his people. The Lord especially enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people. It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your house. Indictment: What do you mean by crushing my people, 3:15 by grinding the face of the poor? says the Lord of hosts. 5:3-4 Now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard: What more could be done for my vineyard? When I looked for it to yield normal grapes why did it yield bad (or "sour") grapes? Sentence: Now, I will reveal to you what I will do to 5:5-6 my vineyard: I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down the wall and it will be trodden down. I will make it a waste; it shall neither be pruned nor hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. Summary For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the Appraisal: house of Israel, and the people of Judah are 5:7 his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteous- ness, but behold, a cry! Whether or not the parable was originally sung, it is told in the third 207</page><page sequence="16">Journal of Biblical Literature person as a ploy. Implied in the telling of such a story (5:1b-2) is an occasion for the listener(s) to judge the matter. For that reason, there is normally no transition between the story itself and the judgment on the part of the one(s) listening. In each of the other juridical parables the king announces a decision immediately; here a different audience is by implication summoned to contemplate the case, just as may be the case in Jer 3:1-5. Perhaps the setting is the time of the harvest and vintage festival (cf. Lev 23:34-43; Deut 16:13-15). The listeners could be trying to decide whether the fault for such a worthless harvest lies with the keeper of the vineyard, with land that will not be cultivated, or with some other cause. Suddenly the prophet utters an oracle (3:13ff.) cast in the familiar form of a lawsuit against the people and more specifically against the elders and the princes of the people. The interpretation "It is you!" (,Qn1, 3:14b) opens with a blunt identification in the same manner as in Nathan's response after King David's judgment in 2 Sam 12:7: "You are the man!" (0t,^ ,rni). The ones who contemplate the cause are the cause; they "devoured" this vineyard by robbing the poor and taking the booty to their houses. After this interpretation we find an indictment (3:15) cast in the form of a rhetorical question exactly as in other juridi- cal parables: for example, "Why have you despised the word of the Lord to do what is evil in his sight?" (2 Sam 12:9a) and "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God?" (2 Sam 14:13a). Similarly, 5:3-4 continues the indictment by asking rhetorically what else God could have done to prevent the vineyard's failure. The vocabu- lary itself ("me and my vineyard") presupposes that the listeners now know from the interpretation that God is in fact the "beloved" vineyard owner of the parable. Similarly, as in 2 Sam 12:7b-8 (cf. Deut 32:7-14), these questions indirectly remind the people of Judah of God's benevo- lent acts and deepen the irony of their predicament. The "sentence" in Isa 5:5-6 is introduced, as in the juridical parable of Nathan in 2 Sam 12:10, with "and now" (n,np). The use of such an introduction within speeches, prayers, or oracles denotes a turning point in the discussion.47 Two such openings in close proximity within the same discourse commonly occur and often lend to the force of the second a sense of "therefore," with a climactic conclusion.48 The wordplay on "devour" of 3:14 is clever: "You [particularly the rulers] devoured [or "trampled"] the vineyard so that it yielded only sour grapes; 47 Cf. H. A. Brongers, "Bemerkungen zum Gebrauch des adverbialen we'attah im Alten Testament," VT 15 (1965) 289-99. 48 Cf. Exod 3:9-10; Jos 14:10, 12; Ruth 3:11-12; 1 Sam 25:26-27; 1 Sam 26:19-20; 2 Sam 2:6-7; 2 Sam 7:28-29; 1 Kgs 5:18, 20; 8:25; 18:11, 14; 1 Chr 17:26-27; Ezra 9:8, 10, 12; Neh 6:7; Dan 9:15, 17. 208</page><page sequence="17">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 therefore, I will utterly devour all of it [including you] so that there will be only briers and thorns, no grapes or vineyard at all!"49 Besides accounting for the parts of the parable, this reconstruction resolves the problem of the change in voice found in 5:1-2 and 5:3-4. Finally, v 7 has characteristics of a "summary-appraisal form."50 There occurs here a shift from oracular speech in the first person to a third person description of its essential content. This statement is composed of two bicola in which the preceding material is simultaneously summarized and interpreted in general moral terms. If "house of Israel" is taken to mean northern Israel, then this generalization is applied, beyond the limited scope of a parable about Judah (cf. 5:3a), to both nations. As part of the original juridical parable 5:7 may seem unnecessary and awkwardly didactic. An "interpretation" was already present in 3:14ff. My suggestion is that v 7 was probably added by a redactor as a summary-appraisal once the original tradition had been fractured and displaced. It now compen- sates for the missing interpretation and generalizes on the content of the remaining tradition in Isa 5:1-6. Similarly, the identification of Isa 5:1b-2 as a "love song," though conceivably original, is just as likely a redactional reconception of what remained after the original juridical parable was broken apart. An editor's decision to designate it as a "song" may have been inspired by 16:10, one of the rare places where "vineyard" imagery occurs outside of 3:13-15 and 5:1-7.51 From the standpoint of our assessment of an anti-Assyrian redac- tion, v 7 sheds light on the craft of editing itself. In Childs's study of the summary-appraisal form, he discusses three instances of it in Isaiah 1-39: Isa 14:26-27, 17:14b, and 28:29. It is significant that all of these instances belong to the relatively few traditions attributed to the AR!52 The similarities in form and function of these occurrences suggest that the summary-appraisal form likely belongs to the repertoire of stylistic edito- rial devices employed by the AR to help create a new literary context 49 On the problem of rendering the verb "devour" or "trample," see n. 41. 50 B. Childs first proposed the existence of a "summary-appraisal form" in his Isaiah and the Assyrian Crisis, 128ff. The only missing feature here in Isa 5:7 is the presence usually of a near demonstrative pronoun which is arguably replaced here with the antecedent itself, "the vineyard." One argument for the direct use of the antecedent instead of a demonstrative pronoun may be that the text of Isa 5:1-6 has a problem precisely at this point. The missing interpretation of the vineyard invites greater precision in such a refer- ence. W. Whedbee's Isaiah and Wisdom (New York: Abingdon, 1971) calls Isa 5:7 a pro- phetic "statement of application" (p. 45) and confuses it, in my opinion, with part of the indictment of the juridical parable, by comparing it with 2 Sam 12:7 (cf. p. 47). 51 The same term, "vineyard," occurs outside the parable texts as a singular only in 1:8; 17:10; 5:10; 27:2, and as a plural in 36:17; 37:30; 61:5; and 65:21. Only Isa 27:2, which we will subsequently discuss, uses "vineyard" as a metaphor for Israel. Perhaps only 1:8 and 5:10 should even be regarded as likely Isaianic in origin. 52 Cf. Barth, Die Jesaja-Worte, 103-19, 180-83, and 211. 209</page><page sequence="18">Journal of Biblical Literature from older oracular material. Therefore, its sapiential tone might reflect its life setting within the scribal schools rather than indicate wisdom influence on the eighth-century prophet. By means of this device the editors could make topical generalizations about the meaning of older texts in a new and more extensive literary context. Likewise, just as the displacement of 2:6-21 and 5:15-17 created a loose thematic bridge between two once independent collections, the displacement of 3:13-15 creates anticipatory resonance in a previous collection and by repetition of key themes, motifs, and metaphors helps to move the various collec- tions into a common context. As in the other sections, we can turn now from an analysis of the displacement itself to see if the AR tried elsewhere to extend topically the message of 3:13-15 and 5:1-7 to Assyria and to examine any evi- dence of still later editorial plays within Isaiah 1-39 upon key themes or motifs so marked previously by the AR. We must initially take special note of the expression "briers and thorns" in 5:6. In Hebrew scripture these particular terms occur either individually with the meaning of "brier/thorn" or as a bonded pair only in Isaiah 1-39.53 But within Isaiah 1-39, the expression "briers and thorns" is far from rare, occurring seven times! Two of these instances, outside of the parable of the vineyard, probably belong to the prophet Isaiah, whose use of it retains an allusion to the vineyard parable as found in Isa 5:1-7. For example, in 32:13-14, it is announced that people will shudder at the failure of the "vintage" (10b), "fruit harvest" (10b), and "fruitful vine" (13). In place of a vineyard we find "the soil of my people growing up in thorns and briers" (32:13). At the same time, the vineyard's "hill and watchtower" (cf. 5:1b-2) has become occupied by wild animals (32:14b). Likewise, in 9:17-19, Isaiah applies this same imagery regarding the land of Judah to northern Israel as well. There, as in the case of Judah, "wickedness burns like a fire," and the people "consume" each other (9:17a, 19, cf. 3:14b). Consequently, the wrath of God will "devour the briers and thorns" (9:17a, cf. 5:5-6) and the land and the people "will be consumed" (9:18). From this evidence we can conclude that, already for eighth-century Isaiah, "briers and thorns" is a marked motif alluding back to the same scenario of expressions we find in the parable of the vineyard. In his own prophecy Isaiah has shown that what was said of Judah (3:13-15; 5:1-7; 32:9ff.) might be applicable to the northern king- dom as well (9:17-19), thereby giving the parable of the vineyard a 53 Isa 5:6; 7:23; 7:24; 7:25; 9:17; 10:17; 27:4. The only other occurrence of the word m'-t with the meaning "brier" is found in 32:13 paired with a different, more common term for "thorn" or "thorn bush." Other similar expressions using different terms for both mem- bers of the pair can be found in Gen 3:18; Judg 8:7, 16; Hos 10:8; and Ezek 2:6. 210</page><page sequence="19">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 pivotal role in the message of the eighth-century prophet much as it has managed to retain even in the later collection. If we look, as in the other two cases, for evidence that the AR freely applied these same motifs to Assyria, we find just such an instance in Isa 10:16-19. These verses refer to God's becoming a fire against Assyria that will "burn and devour his briers and thorns in one day" (10:17).54 R. E. Clements similarly recognizes that here the motifs of fire "devour- ing" "briers and thorns" allude to Isaiah's parable.55 This editorial usage of older tradition in 10:16-19 follows in the same pattern as that shown already by Barth in his treatment of the AR's statement in 14:24-27 regarding "God's outstretched arm" and in our previous discussion of God's "humbling the proud" in the AR of 10:33-34. Turning to a period sometime after the AR, we can see that this preceding editorial work did establish some marked lines of interpreta- tion which captured the imagination of later readers. The most obvious post-AR play on the parable of the vineyard belongs to the later Apoca- lypse of Isaiah in 27:2-6. Kaiser calls this text "The Eschatological Song of the Vineyard."56 The parallels between 5:1-7 and 27:2-6 are quite deliberate: in both, God is the "keeper" (27:3a) of the vineyard; the "planting of his delight" in 5:7 is in 27:2 "a pleasant vineyard." In con- trast, whereas the wall and hedge are torn down in 5:5, in 27:3b God will guard the vineyard day and night; whereas the rain is withheld from the vineyard in 5:6b, in 27:3 God waters it; and whereas "briers and thorns" replace the vineyard in 5:5, if they were ever to appear again God would burn them up in 27:4b. IV This analysis of the AR and later interpretation based on it in the context of Isaiah 1-39 raises the question of the semantic implications of the AR for the book of Isaiah as a whole. Of course, the AR belongs only to one major stage in the complex editorial history of the book of Isaiah. We did not mention, for example, the way in which promise oracles in 2:2-5 and 4:2-6 came to bracket the older pre-AR collection of judg- ment oracles against Judah in 2:6-4:22. The juxtaposition of oracles of judgment with those of promise is, of course, a common editorial device throughout the prophetic books. We also omitted any treatment of the many briefer "supplements" that seem to have entered into the text (e.g., 3:24-4:1). Our effort has only been to measure, in literary terms, one major editorial moment and the new contextual reading it commended for older independent texts or collections. 54 Cf. Barth, Die Jesaja-Worte, 28-32. 55 Clements, Isaiah 1-39, 91-92. 56 Kaiser, Isaiah 13-39, 223-26. 211</page><page sequence="20">Journal of Biblical Literature At a minimum we have sought to describe some specific features of a redactional process prior to the time of the so-called Second Isaiah. The literary significance for how the AR redaction still influenced the reading of older traditions in later generations will be pursued in two directions. First, we will examine traditions in Isaiah 40ff. in order to see if the editorial technique of the AR and its contextualization of Isaianic traditions influenced the editing of the book of Isaiah as a whole. Second, we will briefly discuss how the AR's contribution to the formation of Isaiah 2-32 sheds light on the current debate regarding the nature of a biblical book's "canonical context" and what kind of literal sense tradi- tions like Isaiah 1-39 offered to the religions of Judaism and Christianity. If we look at Isaiah 40ff. for signs of its dependence on the literary predispositions of the AR redaction, we are struck by the absence in these later chapters of some obvious themes familiar in the AR's redac- tion within Isaiah 2-32. For example, Israel is never described in Isaiah 40ff. under the metaphor of a "vineyard." In addition, with perhaps the exception of an allusion in Isa 55:13 cast in lexically different terms, the key expression "briers and thorns" occurs only in Isaiah 1-39 (cf. 5:6; 7:23-25; 9:18[17]; 10:17; 27:4; 32:13). At most, we find only loose allusions and resemblances to motifs stressed by the AR. Michael Fishbane suggests that 60:1, 5, 9, 14, 17 depend for some of their language on 2:3, 5, 7, 10.57 Likewise, the depiction of how the prideful bowed down to the "ground" and to the "dust" in 2:9, 25:11-12 and 26:5 may lie behind the similar description of foreign rulers in 47:1 and 49:23 (cf. 46:1-2; 60:14). God's wrath "against all the high mountains and against all the lofty hills" in 2:14 may have helped to inspire the recurring imagery in Isaiah 40ff. of mountains and hills that will be brought low, threshed, crushed, leveled, or made into chaff (cf. 40:4; 41:15; 42:15; 45:2). If in 2:1-22 and 5:15-16 the proud are humbled while "God alone is exalted," in 57:15 God is called "the high and lofty one" and in 52:13 it is God's "servant" who will "be exalted and lifted up." The AR redactional contribution of 14:24-27 portrays God as "trampling" on top of Assyria, just as the enemy nations are treated in 41:2, 25b; 63:3, 6. Another possibility of inner-biblical interpretation that follows the notes scored by the AR may be a play by Isa 43:13 on the refrain "his anger is not turned away (2tfrb) and his hand is stretched out still" found in Isaiah 1-39 (cf. 1:25; 5:25; 9:11, 16, 20; 10:4; 12:1; 14:27). The writer of Isa 43:13 similarly asks, "who can turn back (my hand)?" but elsewhere in Isai- ah 40ff. the threat of God's anger is replaced with assurance that now it is God's salvific "word" that "will not be reverted" (:1t K~) (45:23; 55:10-11). 57 M. Fishbane, "Revelation and Tradition: Aspects of Inner-Biblical Exegesis," JBL 99 (1980) 355. 212</page><page sequence="21">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 Even for a conservative assigning of the AR to a late stage in the ministry of Isaiah himself, most of the editorial implications would remain the same. In its use of key motifs and themes the AR succeeded in establish- ing a marked pattern of traces upon which future interpretation of Isaiah 1-39 often depended. Numerous examples have been cited to show how such later interpretation could stand in full continuity with the contextual leads of the AR (e.g., 7:23-25; 25:11-12; 26:5; 27:2-4; 30:18-26). Con- versely, Isaiah 35, which is a virtual mosaic of key themes from Isaiah 40ff., is inserted into Isaiah 1-39 without any attention to the marked features of AR's context. What seems noteworthy is how frequently late, post-AR traditions that depend directly on marked features of the AR have been edited back into Isaiah 1-39, rather than being used either to provide a connection between chaps. 1-39 and 40ff. or to offer a contextual guide for the organization of traditions in chaps. 40-66. In place of the marked traces of the AR, other features provided the principal connections between Isaiah 1-39 and 40ff. These features included the retrospective synthesis of Isaiah 12 in anticipation of chaps. 40ff., fresh inner-biblical interpretations of Isaiah 1-39 in 40ff. based on motifs not so central to the AR, the emphasis on God's anger which has turned to comfort and the stress on the "latter things" which are entirely different from the "former."58 The description above has concentrated solely on how a particular redactional activity influenced the formation of material in Isaiah 1-39 and came to be retained here and there in the later book of Isaiah. Both its speculative nature and its limited scope prevent such analysis from being equated with an answer to what is the "shape," as Childs has used the term, of the book of Isaiah.59 Consequently, such redactional investi- gation per se can provide no sufficient guide to the reading or construc- tive misreading of a canonical book as part of a still later scripture. In my opinion, Childs's discussion of the shape of biblical books frequently blends just such a descriptive-heuristic, tradition-historical set of observations with a different descriptive-prescriptive theological inter- pretation of the differences in the text.60 His prescriptive concern inevi- tably entails a commitment to a certain religious "preunderstanding" 58 Childs, Introduction, 325-36. 59 Cf. Childs, Introduction, 77-79. 60 My point in coining this distinction is to avoid a subjective/objective dichotomy. I think that Childs's terminology of "canonical intentionality" or "the Canon's intent" may create more problems than it solves, though admittedly the recognition that a text has its own autonomous meaning to its readers leads easily to anthropomorphic circumlocutions such as "the law says" (cf. Rom 7:7; 1 Cor 14:34) or "the Scripture says." However, if one presses this anthropomorphism to the point of assigning it to a full "intent," one risks dis- solving the internal pluralism too readily into harmonious categories of a single psychol- ogy and ideology of an imaginary mind. 213</page><page sequence="22">Journal of Biblical Literature regarding the nature and subject matter of scripture from within the Christian vision of faith. It is arguable that Childs's prescriptive proposal does indeed derive from the evidence of scripture itself and helps to provide one of the best possible guides to how a book functions contex- tually within Christian faith. His description of a book's "shape" should not, therefore, be dismissed as merely subjective. Nevertheless, Childs's own particular mixing of a tradition-historical assessment with a theolog- ical prescription for the reading of the same texts may be faulted at times for putting almost all the weight of interpretation on the unifying boundaries of a book, on its totalizing "shape" which integrates it into a larger canon of scripture. Such an emphasis lends itself to the appear- ance of his having interest only in lines of harmony or continuity at the expense of understating the degree to which a canonical context retains historical discontinuities, conflictual inner-biblical interpretations, and persistent vaguenesses, ambiguities, or contradictory intentions. Even the trope "shape" suggests a fixed form, a quantifiable dimension that may seem to lack room for the unshaped, tension-filled, uninterpreted quality of religious canons. My own approach here is to concentrate on how a redaction both interprets and ensures an uninterpreted dimension to any canonical con- text. Thus, I have separated tentatively these two readings-which I have loosely labeled the "descriptive-heuristic" and the "descriptive- prescriptive"-and focused on the former in order to understand better its implications for a modern or post-modern historical interpretation of the curiously constructed texts of scripture. Admittedly this former task is "descriptive" only within a specific language game ruled by generally accepted norms of a tradition-historical inquiry, even as Childs's pre- scriptive "shape" of a book may, in theory, be similarly "descriptive" in terms of how a scripture commends itself ideally to be read within a particular faith. My procedure will be to make only a few brief generalizations about how such redactional study heuristically informs any historical reading of a canonical context. At the outset, in literature like Isaiah 1-39 the meaning of the text cannot be simply identical with a redactor's intent, whether that of the first or the so-called last redactor. Still, a major redaction, like that of the AR, may attain a momentum that is not entirely overcome by later editors. In other words, much from preceding redactions as well as from the original prophetic oracles themselves may be retained, even uninterpreted, by later redactors. For example, the AR contributes little or nothing to the surface discourse of 6:1-8:8a or that of the woe oracles and invective threats surrounding these Syro-Ephraimite war texts. However, the AR's addition of 14:24-27 and other such free plays upon key themes, topics, or motifs from the earlier tradition has altered their context and, to that extent, their meaning. 214</page><page sequence="23">Sheppard: Redaction and Context of Isaiah 1-39 This partial reworking of older traditions by later tradents and editors, like those behind the AR, thus includes much of the pluralism within the prehistory of the resultant text. On the one hand, the effect redactionally does not simply dissolve all of the tradition history-with its ancient politics, economics, anthropology, sociology, etc.-into some kind of consistently synchronic, theological discourse. On the other hand, persistent and marked influences from editors, along with lucid survivals from earlier periods, do, in fact, give some conspicuous, sociopolitical recommendations for reading, which are retained in later canonical con- texts. Therefore, a canonical context offers only a partially delimited, surface structure or linguistic arena (Childs's "shape") in which diverse texts are to be read together as though they make in common a claim upon the reader. Of course, other factors, for example, the role of magisterial traditions and what one assumes to be the text's aim and subject matter, must affect how these contextual clues become warrants within a scripture for particular readings by a still later community of faith and how open one could be to a more dynamic, spiritual, or midrashic exegesis. Moreover, as Clements has suggested, some texts from an earlier period contextually begin to exhibit a "dimension of depth."61 For ex- ample, the AR's own eulogy of Josiah in Isa 9:1-6 gains messianic propor- tions for postexilic interpreters. They capitalize upon the ambiguity of the promissory context, which does not name a specific historical king and which points in florid terms to one who can turn the "darkness," even that of exile (8:21-23), into "light" (9:1). Such "reinterpretations," rather than being pious deceptions, reveal a confidence that the vitality of the voice of God in ancient Israel lent a depth of meaning to Isaiah's oracles that could be extended to times and places beyond the imagination of the living prophet. This assumption of semantic density may actually enrich once simpler texts with a mystery and ambiguity of meaning that even a prophet did not originally intend for them to possess. On the matter of what constitutes aesthetic or rhetorical criteria of excellence for such literature, one might also see different levels of tradi- tions which blur differing norms of "literary" competence together. The aesthetic and semantic features valued in a prophet's oral delivery of an oracle are not exactly the same as those of a collection to which is added, at a minimum, some prose narration and appropriate third person titles. Finally, a later editor may follow a different set of criteria appropriate to the craft of editing in the ancient Near East. Although certain parts of the context are heavily influenced, for example, by introducing oracles 61 R. E. Clements, Old Testament Theology (Atlanta: John Knox, 1978), 14, 33, 36-37, 151, Cf. P. R. Ackroyd, "The Vitality of the Word of God in the Old Testament Mate- rial," ASTI 1 (1962) 6-23. 215</page><page sequence="24">Journal of Biblical Literature against Assyria, others may be preserved and standardized through more "neutral" aesthetic principles of editing (for instance, the juxtaposition of similar oracles, Stichwort connections to justify the location of a frag- ment, the use of chiasmus as a device to combine diverse traditions or subcollections, and the technique of adding a gloss that broadens the horizon of an oracle so that it applies to another party without changing the original historically specific words of that oracle). These latter tech- niques may reflect an aesthetic that is partially governed by an anxiety of influence-editors capitalize upon the authority of older material and are not simply "authors" of their own original books. In sum, my own approach concludes with an emphasis on the interpre- tation of canonical contexts because of a pragmatic concern with living faiths and a preference for a historical assessment of constructed texts over a pious reading of a reconstructed history. By concentrating on one major redactional activity I have shown how the AR succeeded in recommending a reading of Isaiah 2-39 under key topics, for example, the pride of the privileged before they fall, the thin line between a country as fruitful as a vineyard and one that becomes as useless as a field of briers and thorns, and finally the role of the incontrovertible hand (providence) of God within history. Such a conclusion does not end interpretation by appealing to a fixed set of harmonizing themes; it only acknowledges that the dialectical tension between the past and the present within a canonical context is partially ruled by marked traces within a text so that the text itself is not without its own recommendations for reading. The lack of any thorough harmonizing of all the preceding traditions in terms of these topics only deepens the demand for a high and serious reading in search of a truth that lies beyond the mere words of the text. This kind of historical-critical research perceives itself in full continuity with other endeavors to understand how diverse historical traditions share in a common subject matter or offer any intrinsic criteria for valid religious interpretation. At the same time, recognition within a canonical context of conflicting traditions, partial retentions from varying moments in an ancient social history, and the cultural conditionedness of every human word of the Bible must only increase rather than diminish the need for historical interpreta- tion by those who look to the past in order to live in the present. 216</page></plain_text>
