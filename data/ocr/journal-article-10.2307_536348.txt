<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME SOURCES OF VARIABILITY IN KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY1 BY THEODORE STERN 3. STYLE AND ELEMENTS OF THE MYTH LOT, Episode, and Element. Plot organization and the arrangement of com- ponent episodes is a rich field for variation. It has already been mentioned that what in one form is one episode among several within a tale, in another version has independent status.2 Informants will, as a rule, recognize the latter as a component of a larger myth, but may feel that the episode has a measure of autonomy which justifies telling it alone.3 Again, the very order of sequent episodes may differ between variant versions of a myth. Concretely, HN's version of "Old Fish Hawk" reverses the order of the two episodes previously outlined for the visit made by Mink and Weasel to Fish Hawk (TL). As a result, he has the hostess immediately offering fish to her brothers, the sequence of the magic fish, and only subsequently the episode of the expanding seeds. At the end, rather lamely, the host offers Mink and Weasel another fish, which they refuse. It is often impossible to verify the direction of reversal, save where, as in this case, internal evidence provides leads. As against instances in which myths differ in the sequence of constituent episodes, there are other examples in which comparable myths differ by the elision or injection of an episode. HN regarded the occurrence of the fish-cooking episode in EB's "The Story of Mink and Weasel"-in much the form related in a preceding section of this paper-as a gratuitous insertion; properly, he contended, it belonged only in the tale of "Old Fish Hawk." HN's "Thunderbird" differs from that of TL by several epi- sodes absent in one or the other; and like remarks could be made of other, analogous myths. Of particular significance for variation is the occurrence of episodes which main- tain the same structural relationship to the plot, and which from this point of view may be termed functional equivalents. Thus Coyote, in the "Thunderbird" of HN, is wandering without eyes, having juggled them away. His sight is finally restored by the kindness of a man who patiently tries the eyes of several animals before he finds some that are satisfactory. In the comparable version by TL, Coyote spins about in shamanistic fashion until he has lured an inquisitive deer to approach him, then leaps upon the animal's back and wrenches out his eyes, which he thrusts into his own sockets. In the sense in which the term is used here, these two episodes con- stitute functional equivalents.4 At a still more distant remove from identity are those myths differing in plot which yet share a single episode. One may note such an instance in the correspond- ence between LL's "Aisis and Kemukamps" and the "Black Bear and Deer" of HN, which share an episode wherein two children, fleeing an old lady, leave their spirit- voices behind, instructing the objects within the house to keep their secret-but omit- 377</page><page sequence="2">Journal of American Folklore ting Awl-and burrowing down through the fireplace to make their escape. The old woman learns their secret from Awl and pursues them. It is this single shared episode which provides a basis for relating the two stories. An explanation of the way in which such parallels may arise is not difficult to find.5 In Klamath mythology they correlate with a similarity in the characters in- volved and with the type of relationship pictured as existing between them. Given a situation concerning such characters, the versatile narrator might advance the action by introducing an appropriate, highly favored, and familiar episode. The press of favor would thus constitute a factor making for such innovations. Moreover, where- as in Klamath society-there is little differentiation of role, it might be expected that distinctive characters and their relationships would likewise be fewer, and that the range of possible situations would be small. Again, from that range, only a few situations are presented, and these recurrently, as favored features of the plot. Thus, in an instance involving something less than an entire episode, restricted indeed to an element, LL's "Natanataas" details the manner in which Cottontail Rabbit, on behalf of his friend, Grey Squirrel, meets several tests imposed by Na- tanataas, his evil father-in-law. The major tasks involve contests with sets of evil beings, in reality the children of Natanataas, who must conceal his grief as he thanks the victorious Rabbit, while cremating the bodies of his slain children. In HN's "Makemkak," Kemukamps plays a similar role, though he is here the host who forces an unwilling guest into permitting his grizzly-dog to fight successively his own five dogs. The latter, in truth the children of Kemukamps, are torn to pieces, and the grieving father must magically revive them. A comparison of the Natanataas tale with the Modoc version recorded by Curtin6 shows the latter including among the tests imposed by Natanataas the climbing of a tree to secure eagle feathers, and the subsequent magical growth of the tree. It is precisely the episode centrally identified by all Klamath-probably as well by all Modoc-with the tale of Aisis and Kemu- kamps. It is noteworthy that in the two instances a passing identification seems to be made between Natanataas and Kemukamps. The fact that, like Kemukamps, the former is referred to as ,cIk'a 'old man' provides a clue; but far more can be attributed to the situation in which each finds himself. In "Makemkak," Kemukamps is a host who, against the canons of Klamath hospitality, forces his guest to pit his dog in a fight; in "Aisis and Kemukamps," he is a scheming old man, sending his foster son up a tree to get rid of him, in order to take over his wives. Natanataas is likewise a designing old man, setting a series of deadly tests for his son-in-law, in the hope of thus ridding himself of him. That in all these instances the young man is victorious serves further to link these situations. Accordingly, it is not surprising to find that myths otherwise unrelated in plot, but containing analogous situations, should resolve them by identical elements or episodes. In summarizing the preceding remarks as to forms which variability may take on the level of the episode, one recognizes identity in two myths as to the fabric of each of the individual episodes, the order in which they appear, and their number in each myth. Any of the three aspects may, of course, range from complete identity to total difference. (Thus, for the third aspect, a limiting instance would be the de- tached episode in comparison with the version wherein it is but one of many.) As a second qualification made upon identity of component episodes, there appears the 378</page><page sequence="3">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology principle of functional equivalence, in accordance with which episodes manifesting a certain dissimilarity perform the same function in two versions of a myth, a con- sideration which bears rather upon their degree of similarity than upon plot per se. In turn, the episode may be conceived as comprising a number of elements, de- fined as items of person, object, or action, which significantly advance the episode. Just as a given plot involves a series of episodes ordered and proportioned to fulfill an anticipated whole, a Gestalt, present in the mind of the narrator, so the elements within the plot gain sequence and stress within the episode. The large number of elements within a given myth exhibit, in the Klamath sample analyzed, the several forms of variation noted for the episode and would seem to be explicable in much the same terms.8 One of the principal nucleating factors in the development of the myths found at Klamath would seem to be the traits assigned to major figures among the dramatis personae, the mythic personalities which these latter exhibit; and in this respect they share broadly, of course, not only with other American Indians but with peoples far more widely distributed. A glance through the Aarne-Thompson index of tale types9 leaves the clear impression that a salient feature often selected for classifying tale types is the major characters themselves. That the Klamath are prone to offer such a classification has already been noted. In an earlier paper10 I have discussed the development of the trickster as one type of character and have noted the stability which marks the qualities of such stock characters from tale to tale. That stable mythic personalities exert a selective power in the development of myth seems indicated both on distributional grounds and in the light of the relationship between trickster char- acters at Klamath. Undoubtedly the grandest figure in Klamath mythology is the trickster-trans- former, Kemukamps, anthropomorphic like his cognates in Northwestern California and the Oregon Coast, transformer of the world in a myth of North Central Cali- fornia affinities, but joining with these attributes the greed and lechery so often asso- ciated with the character of Coyote, whose attributes are expressive both of local phrasing and of an historic position upon the cultural gradient emergent between California and the Plateau.1 Like his counterparts of Northwest California, Kemu- kamps may be viewed as cognate with the figure of Coyote on the Plateau. It is ac- cordingly of interest to note the relation he bears to the Klamath character, Coyote. For the purposes of this paper, it is adequate to point out that Kemukamps is asso- ciated at Klamath with many of the myths elsewhere told of Coyote, so that the latter is almost completely shorn of his Plateau transformer-traits and loses some of his tales of lechery as well. Coyote's monster-killing feats, as found on the Plateau, are rendered in turn to Mink and Weasel. Divested of much of the characterizing tales-or, phrased alternatively, entering the area so late that the tales had already been associated with other characters-Coyote is feebly developed at best, a growth stunted in the shade of two characters of major interest to the Klamath. Despite the fact that some Kemukamps myths at one point or another approach those of Coyote, there is no tendency on the part of any Klamath encountered to confuse the two characters. On the other hand, from the days of Gatschet to the present, informants have been prone to confuse the two transformers, Mink and Kemukamps.'2 At the same time, the ambivalent nature of the latter occasionally leads him to play a far different role from that of the worthy Mink, and he is thus in HN's "Makemkak" 379</page><page sequence="4">Journal of American Folklore the ungracious host, the buff who sicks his dogs on the beast of his guest-a role which Night Hawk plays against his guest, Mink, in TL's "Night Hawk." How far a latent identification of two characters serves directly as a bridge, trans- ferring items from a myth proper to one character to a myth associated with his analogue, is uncertain. Yet, from what has been said earlier of the way in which similarity in interpersonal situations may serve as a span, its power must be consider- able, for the personalities of the characters involved comprise a major portion of such situations. It is significant, in view of what has already been said as to the straightforward development of plot, that it is through action-rather than by means of direct de- scription or of illustrative episode-that the mythic personality of a character is de- veloped. It is rare to find the inner state of a person elicited. There are stock exclama- tions denoting surprise, horror, and the like; we may be told that a character "felt good" or "badly," but these terms must cover a broader wealth of emotions than do their correspondents in English. That a person is just or avaricious, bold or cowardly, is almost never explicitly stated; yet the tale does not leave the auditor long in doubt. Perhaps the chief exception in the use of such expressions-and she never goes as far as the terms cited here-is LL, whose extraordinary usages occur prin- cipally in her English renditions, differing from their Klamath counterparts perhaps chiefly in this regard. Style. Analysis thus far has touched upon the role for variability played by the cultural setting in which the myth appears and by the character and past experience of the narrator. Consideration has then turned to the manner in which formal com- ponents of the myth-plot, episode, element, and dramatis personae-enter. It re- mains to discuss the stylistic dimensions in which Klamath myths may be said to vary, again with an eye to relating them where possible to associated features. While much of the earlier considerations of myth components are germane here, present discussion will be limited to generic qualities of formal expression. Stylistic treatment, in this restricted sense, accordingly may be said to shape those elements chosen for inclusion, to emphasize those deemed important while shading down those that are to play but a minor role.'3 Some of the special characteristics of oral style have been well set forth by Boas, who contrasts ". . . rhythmic repetition of the same or similar elements ... in prose and in poetry as a rhythm of time, in decorative art as a rhythm of space . .. ," and a few pages later adds, "Symmetry in the rigid sense of the term does not exist in the arts built on time sequences. A reversion of time sequence is not felt as symmetry in the same way as a reversion of space sequence where every point has its equivalent point. In time sequences we have a feeling for symmetry only for the order of repetition and structural phrases."14 What might be termed the superficial aspects of style-in that they involve a "finish," the imparting of a surface to the larger elements already analyzed'5-is often intimately bound up with the properties of the language through which the tale is conveyed.16 As New- man has so well put it: ... each language, instead of shaping itself to our will, governs and directs the trend of our expression . . . languages have an internal resistance. Their materials are already shaped into a system of formal and conceptual patterns. These patterns, however, are merely the potentialities of style. A grammar deals with them directly.... To the native a grammar is always unconvincing, for it ignores the most 380</page><page sequence="5">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology vital and intimate network of values, of attitudes and expectancies that guide his selection of expressive tools.17 A number of features, by no means unique to Klamath, characterize the lan- guage and render their impress in narrative. The vocalic system is simple, its elements chiefly lax, with rounding only of a back series. These features impart a certain so- norous quality to Klamath speech and narrative, the effect of which is heightened by a form of vocalic harmony in prefixes and reduplicated forms. DeAngulo and Freeland rightly refer to its "phonetic subtlety," to the "phonetic euphony."18 The latter term they explicitly apply to a "relish for consonant clustering" and to "play with syllabic manipulation," in particular, metathesis and reduplication.19 It may be added that in speech there is a decided tendency towards simplifying consonant clusters, especially in final position. Taken together with the action of sandhi, the interjection of a rhetorical low-mid vowel between some words, and allied devices, the total phonetic effect is to render the spoken-and narrative-language far more flowing than might appear from textual renditions. Word-formation in Klamath often involves a wealth of affixes, together with re- duplication and metathesis, to produce an effect that on occasion can be far more precisely delimiting than in English. While English versions given by informants sometimes seem to be a translation of the native text, it is clear that much that lies etymologically within the word is not conveyed in the English counterpart. How- ever, it is at least a question how deeply the native auditor is aware of such nuances, and how far they remain only half sensed in the swift flow of words. Truly bilingual informants do, indeed, insist that Klamath is far more compact in expression than is English, but this is far from proving the point. It might be added that major de- pendence upon reduplication as a morphological feature has as a by-product an effect of assonance that, nonetheless, does not appear to be consciously sought after by the narrator. Onomatopoeia, on the other hand, serves not only in word-formation -as in the names of birds, which are often patterned after their calls-but as a device in frequent use in narrative. Since Klamath expresses relational concepts particularly by affixation and syllabic modification, word order is of only secondary importance.20 There is, nevertheless, a preferred order, as illustrated in the following sentence from LL's "Skunk as Shaman": cui hul~k at iblaiwas huuk nil ihuUk'ant hutk IcasIs sAswal'Iyantk Now this Eagle that hide with-which those Skunks (were ones who) had tied around their own heads \nanuk huyk to baksAm'nA huyk lwut- ambli huyk cu le ksdat. all this sister-his that [i.e., hide] put it back this flesh-upon. (Now Eagle put the hide which these Skunks had tied around their heads all back upon the flesh of his sister.) It is true that the majority of informants were able to vary the order of the com- ponent words or phrases within a given sentence, and with a considerable degree of freedom. That they habitually inclined by their own preference toward the favorite sentence type illustrated here seems to indicate that such freedom, while theoretically possible, holds little stylistic charm for the Klamath narrator. Taken together with certain formal rhetorical features noted below, it underscores the positive value 38i</page><page sequence="6">Journal of American Folklore placed upon simple repetition both in vernacular and formal prose. The range of variation offered by strictly grammatical conventions is narrowed by stylistic prefer- ences. Rhetorical devices are freely used by all narrators. Of the standard devices, per- haps the most frequent is the emphasis upon size or distance by a protraction of a medial or final vowel. Thus: mo: :ni 'exceedingly big,' do:: at di 'very far off.' In- formants not given to emphasis in other ways rarely failed to resort to these devices. In all the general qualities noted, Klamath speakers are in general accord. That they tend to channel rhetorical expression is undoubted; nonetheless, they offer suf- ficient scope for the imposition of personal speech habits upon the narrative. When dictating a text, HN and EB begin almost every sentence with the conjunctive phrase cui at 'and then,' while TL starts with cui hok at 'and that one then.' This is less true of LL, who shapes her train of narrative with fewer connectives, and whose style is correspondingly far more compact and telling. To judge by Gatschet's texts, his informants seem likewise to have made less resort to such phrases in the formal texts recorded.21 Even on tape recordings, where a normal rate of uninterrupted nar- ration is maintained, these individual mannerisms tend to be preserved. That such differences are no new development is evident from the comments of Gatschet upon his informants: Readers of Hill's text will notice that his diction is very concise, pregnant and to the point, and so is the speech of these Indians generally. But since that conversational lan- guage, or popular jargon, as we may not improperly call it, moves along in contractions, elisions, metatheses and ellipses, I have had to revise his texts many times with him and other Indians before I could make them practically available. In the myths, Dave Hill is not so pictorial and graphic as Minnie Froben, but in narrating his feats of war he readily furnished all the points that could be expected.22 A certain intensity factor may be said likewise to distinguish the style of narrators. In lexical scope there is involved the selection of words precisely appropriate to the subject and fitting exactly into the sequence of words to produce the desired effect. Observation of LL when youngsters casually visiting were caught in the web of her tale-the almost imperceptible pause before the dramatic word,23 the rounding of phrase, together with the devices to be mentioned below-all these narrative artifices had every indication of being chosen for their special effect. Her subsequent remark, when we were later discussing the tale, that "Those kids haven't heard anything like that at home, I bet!"24 is likewise an indication of the satisfaction which she as nar- rator feels in a sound rendition. It is entirely in accord with the manner in which a careful choice of element leads to a greater intensity of effect in the total narrative. There are, likewise, other devices whereby the narrator seeks to dramatize his utterances. Because tales were habitually recounted in the darkness of the earth lodge, where gestures would be lost,25 sole dependence is placed upon the voice, which quavers like that of an old woman, mimics the low gruffness of Owl, the high, clear speech of Coyote, and so on; and, skillfully indicated by tone, pitch, and timber, the distant, the tiny, the harshness of anger, the calm, slow speech of regret, the dullness of despair. Of my informants, LL made fullest use of these resources; HN less; while others resorted to them only occasionally. Of particular interest are the means used to indicate an imperfect imitation of the speech of another. In AC's "Kemukamps as Baby," the "baby talk" of the 382</page><page sequence="7">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology 383 trickster is signalized by initial nasalization of certain words, as n&amp;eo ,mpale for leo p'al. 'antelope stole and ate it.' Initial nasals again mark another impostiture, in LL's "Skunk as Shaman," where the forms are now termed "Skunk language." Thus, ,peup'gagi 'dance in unison' becomes ,mpeup'gagi. Other "Skunk" forms from the same tale are ,yamas for ,yamas 'north wind,' and ,'olaAstgi for kpokstgi 'I was surprised.' Again, in TL's "Kemukamps [Seduces his] Daughter," the impostor plays the part of a "foreign Indian," saying to the girl, "iwa tuljg tujk," of which only the first word is recognizable as Klamath. Such devices evoked the admiration of all informants who heard them, but occurred infrequently in the myths collected. It might be added that all informants include in their narrations words, and particularly direct quotations, in forms now obsolete but nonetheless deemed an integral part of the tale. This constitutes, perhaps, only a comment upon the devo- tion to traditional form by modern informants in the face of sweeping culture change. It is less clear whether it preserves a practice likewise to be found in aboriginal times. Briefly, then, Klamath mythic style can be said to be characterized by a strong feeling for sound, the marked appearance of assonance, a certain alliteration, onoma- topoeia, and upon the skillful employment of vocal contour and stress. To a lesser extent, individuals seem free to select words and phrases to point up an effect.2 There is in general little direct recourse to metaphor or simile. They do exist: in HN's "Gilili" the slain monster lies "like a little mountain," and his diminutive slayer must scale his sides to stand upon him; the old man in LL's "Aisis and Kemukamps" relates to the children a story which describes metaphorically the genitals of their grandmother. There are other examples, and the suffix -sltk 'like, resembling' provides a ready expression of simile. Nevertheless, though there un- doubtedly exist nuances which my informants were unable to convey to me, figura- tive speech in Klamath seems to rely more heavily on other devices already mentioned. It is just in the area of personal style that broad latitude is permitted the Klamath raconteur by his audience. But stylistic elaboration is a device more than tolerated: it is prized in Klamath narration. It has been remarked that narrators have their favorite tales. Those they specially cherish often present marked resemblances in plot and mood. There are indications that from such lips the myths take on an elaboration that other versions lack. The gifted raconteur gives to his rendition a more vivid portrayal, heightening the dramatic effect by mimiking the voices of characters, skillfully employing vocal contour and stress, and extending through repetition and elaboration certain selected detail. All these devices serve to set their individual products apart. General Considerations. A study of cultural variability is in essence a consideration of the degree to which, within a given sphere of behavior, there co-exist individual freedom and conformity. Even those differences, often minor in extent, which are attributable to factors largely within the psychology of the individual take place within a socio-cultural setting that may have direct bearing upon the event. Thus, when Klamath raconteurs today, in sequent narration of the same tale, forget items only to recall them in a later telling, their lapses are to be viewed as partly consequent upon the disuse into which mythtelling has now fallen. Pressure toward conformity may be exerted from an early age upon the individual, so that it becomes internalized, and the narrator feels compelled to relate a myth in standarized form. As a member</page><page sequence="8">Journal of American Folklore of the society he may equally regulate the behavior of others, and assist in pointing out the egregious errors in the version of a fellow-tribesman. Conforming be- havior and surrogate activity towards others may often be mutually reinforcing: it is my impression that those informants who adhered most rigidly to a set standard in their own narrations expressed the keenest criticism of the deviant tales of others. How closely, indeed, do raconteurs approximate an identical version in sequent narrations of the same tale? Information on this score, albeit in scantier volume than might be desired, comes from the revisions made by the narrator when the dictated text was read back to him, from the tapes recorded after perhaps an intervening week of analysis, and from a few texts dictated a year apart. The data at hand point to a considerable degree of internal consistency for the several major informants. The principal additions are interpolated elements or subsidiary episodes, said simply to have been forgotten in the first recitation. At the same time, when myths were read back immediately following narration, the raconteur often made minor altera- tions in wording in what may best be interpreted as an effort to achieve a more suit- able stylistic effect. It is worthy of note that the net effect of all these emendations, as indeed of entire repetitions of myths, was still productive of smaller distance between sequent narrations of the same individual than between the versions of two narrators. Individuals seem in this respect to be consistent through time-the time under obser- vation-in maintaining distinctive versions.27 To the stability of sequent narrations in the same individual may be related the fact that the details selected by the narrator for elaboration and the tale types which he favored are often consistent not only with each other but with known general features of his life as well. The result is accordingly often a "family resemblance," already remarked, in the myths told by a given raconteur. Each individual thus represents, in abstract terms, a competing mode in myth narration. Since, however, the recitation of a myth is a social act, fulfilling not only personal needs but social functions, the audience tends to regulate the selection of an appropriate mode. Within the stable, slowly-changing society of aboriginal and proto-contact times, limits were imposed upon the degree to which the narrator might freely develop an idiosyncratic version. For example, far more liberties were permitted in stylistic improvisation than in the ordering of episodes or the introduc- tion of major characters. A common, stable culture, in which myths performed a fixed role; common values, not least of all stylistic canons; and narrator-audience groups comprising all members of the society, and differing but little from one household to the next: all these features were productive of the shared qualities in the mythology of the Klamath. It was in effect the development of differentiated audiences, specialized as to composition and locus, together with concommitant changes in other areas of life, that led to the development, from the common store of myths, of variant forms appropriate to each audience. It is true that aged informants can still recall early forms of the myths, but the mythic forms in active narration today are the abbrevi- ated "dirty story" episodes and the lengthier, bowdlerized cognates told for the tender ears of grandchildren. There is some indication here-although the material at hand is inadequate for statistical treatment-that a single, broad behavioral mode28 had gradually become transformed into two mutually complementary phases with little overlap, of which the deviant, obscene tales may bid fair to survive their con- formant, expurgated counterparts. 384</page><page sequence="9">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology 385 NOTES 1 For Sections I.-2., see 1AF, LXIX, I-12, I35-146. 2 HN's "Makemkak" is, he insists, an independent tale, while the cognate "Night Hawk" of TL forms for the latter an integral (and concluding) episode in a Mink-Weasel cycle. 3 This matter is not conclusively settled. The attitude mentioned may be more proper to these days of changing views and practices, when the fairy tale for young children has set limits for length, than to former aboriginal times. 4Looking back to previous statements, it seems desirable to note that these versions are at least consistent with the outward characteristics of the two men. HN, blinded some twenty years ago, views with quiet gratitude the vain efforts made by a White doctor to restore his vision. TL is forever stressing the competitive in his tales, as in his daily life. Both men insist that they tell the myth as they heard it from the same individuals to whom they are indebted for other tales. 5 This explanation is my own, and not one advanced by informants. 6 Jeremiah Curtin, Myths of the Modocs (London, 1912), pp. 359-365. 7 All Klamath versions thus far examined contain this episode; and however scanty other de- tails, it is usually the segment most highly elaborated. For a Modoc version, see Curtin, pp. 1-I6. 8 In the terms "plot" and "episode" I follow the usage of Paul Radin, Literary Aspects of North American Mythology, Can. Dept. of Mines, Mus. Bull. i6, Anthro. Ser., No. 6 (Ottawa, 1915), 7-30. They seem to me broadly analogous to the "core" ("a series of incidents which form a coherent whole") and "incident" ("an aggregate of elements . . . its existence as a unit is rec- ognizable through comparison with other myths either within or without the area"), respectively, of Dorothy Demetracopolou and Cora DuBois in their "A Study of Wintu Mythology," JAF, XLIII (1932), 382. "Element," as used here, differs more markedly from the same term as given by those authors ("the minimum recognizable detail"). Cf. units involved in the discussion of "type" and "motif" by Stith Thompson, The Folktale (New York, 1946), pp. 415-416. 9 Stith Thompson, "The Types of the Folk-tale: Antti Aarne's Verzeichnis der Mdrchentypen Translated and Enlarged," FF Communications, No. 74 (Helsinki, 1928). 10 Theodore Stern, "The Trickster in Klamath Mythology," Western Folklore, XII (1953), 158-174. 11 Stern, pp. I70-173. 12 Stern, pp. I69-170. 13 Compare in this respect the statement by Meyer Schapiro, "Style," Anthropology Today, ed. A. L. Kroeber (Chicago, I953), p. 289: "Although there is no established system of analysis and writers will stress one or another aspect according to their viewpoint or problem, in general the description of a style refers to three aspects of art: form elements or motives, form relationships, and qualities (including an overall quality which we may call the 'expression')." 14 Franz Boas, Primitive Art (Irvington-on-Hudson, 195I), pp. 316, 320. See also his "Stylistic Aspects of Primitive Literature," reprinted in Race, Language and Culture (New York, I948), pp. 491-502. 15 Only in terms of units can they be said to be distinct. In view of the sequential manner in which they develop, both larger and smaller elements are evoked at the same time. It may be said, however, that the larger elements anticipate units more remote in the development of the tale, while "superficial" elements contrast with the more immediate. Analogous, perhaps, in the distinction between the segmental and the supra-segmental phoneme of the linguist. 16 This is not, of course, to restrict the properties of language to the superficial aspects of style. 17 "Linguistic Aspects of Yokuts Style," in Anna H.
