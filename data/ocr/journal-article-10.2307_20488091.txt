Vicziany@adm.monash.edu.au Jayant.Bapat@adm.monash.edu.au Abstract Mumbadevi is the patron Goddess of the city of Mumbai, one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities of Asia. Local traditions say that MumbMdevi was a KolI Goddess and worshipped by the indigenous KolI fisher community for centuries. However, since the turn of the twentieth century the temple of Mumbadevi and the rituals surrounding the Goddess have gradually been Sanskritised. Today, MumbMdevi is more closely associated with the Gujarati community. This paper examines this transformation and in doing so reflects on the survival of Mumbddevi, the ongoing popularity of Goddess worship in Mumbai and the failure of Hindu fundamentalists to subordinate the Mother Goddesses of Mumbai to a more limited range of Hindu Gods. Introduction Mumbai, the commercial heart of modern India and one of the world's largest cities with a population of almost 2o million, derives its name from Mumbadevi, the patron Goddess of Mumbai. The worship of Mumbadevi long predates European settlement in western 1 The authors wish to thank the following persons for their generous support to this project. Sanjay Ranade of the University of Bombay helped us to locate a number of Koj? shrines in Bombay and introduced us to the Kol? associations and the Kol? community leaders. Mr Kannan Srinivasan (Ph.D. candidate, Monash Asia Institute) helped us to see who in Bombay was working on the Hindu temples of that city and in the process was able to locate the important publications by Phiroze Ranade for the MMR-Heritage Conservation Society of Mumbai. We thank Phiroze Ranade for giving us a copy of his current work on the 'Worshipping Houses in the Greater Mumbai Region'. 511</page><page sequence="2">512 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT India, and it is widely believed that in the beginning she was the favoured Mother Goddess of the indigenous inhabitants of Mumbai, the Koli fisher community. Despite this pedigree, much touted in the tourist brochures of Mumbai, the city has only a single temple to Mumbadev1. Moreover, an extensive search of the literature has revealed that there are only three books that include an account of the Mumbadevi temple: a book in Gujarati by Dave (1985, pp. 238 265), Raghunathji's 1900 inventory of the Hindu temples of Mumbai (1900, pp. 29-32), and a modern inventory of the houses of worship in Mumbai by Ranade (2004, 2 vols.). Various histories of the city of Mumbai mention the temple of Mumbadevi, but no major archaeological, historical or ethnographic account has yet been written of this temple to the Mother Goddess who protects Mumbai. To write about Mumbadev1, therefore, would seem to be a thankless task, given the lack of written records and the impossibility of undertaking an archaeological excavation of the current site in order to unravel some of the hidden history of the Goddess and the temple devoted to her. This paper therefore seeks to piece together what is known about Mumbadevi and places that are within the broader context of the beliefs and lives of Mumbai's contemporary residents, including their worship of other Mother Goddesses. In particular, we were keen to investigate the extent to which the preoccupations which Hindu fundamentalists have with the Hindu God Rama have undermined the Devi in this throbbing city. Myths About the Origins of Mumbadevi Dave (1985, pp. 245-246) provides a useful summary of the various myths of origin associated with the temple of Mumbadev1. He notes that Mumbadevi belongs to the long tradition of 'Earth Mothers' that date back to the times of the Indus civilisation in about 3,000-1,500 B.C.E. He goes on to report that British residents of Mumbai in the nineteenth century described Mumbadevi as 'Parvati', the consort of Shiva. No doubt these reports were based on local information, suggesting that by the time of European settlement, Mumbadev1 had started to become 'Hinduised', a process, which is well documented for other Mother Goddesses such as the river Goddess Pampa at Hampi (see below). Maria Graham's journal describes the Temple of Mumbadevi in the following manner:</page><page sequence="3">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 513 The largest pagoda in Bombay is in the Black Town, about a mile and a half from the fort. It is dedicated to Momba Devee, or the Bombay goddess who, by her images and attributes, seems to be Parvati, the wife of Siva. (Graham, 1812, p. 14) A very different myth related by Dave associates Mumbadevi with a 'Muslim tyrant' called Mumbaraka (Dave, 1985, p. 246) who ruled western India in the early fourteenth century. This tyrant was subdued by the Goddess who then assumed the name of Mumbadev1, the first half of that name being derived from Mumbaraka. At least one popular tourist website repeats the myth of the 'sadistic giant' although he is not described as being a Muslim probably because his name identifies him as such.2 Like many other sources, this website claims that the Mumbadevi temple is very old (6oo years) when in fact no authoritative source is available to substantiate any particular claims about its origins. Indeed, the existing temple by the name of Mumbadevi dates from 1737, although earlier versions probably existed in Bombay before then. The myth of the Muslim tyrant or giant is also reported by Raghunathji in his 1900 inventory. According to him, the myth is based on a Sanskrit Purana of unknown date and authorship3 (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 31 footnote). According to this version, Brahma initially favoured Mumbaraka and granted him the benefit of eternal life. When, however, the Gods saw that Mumbaraka had betrayed their trust and was harassing the inhabitants of Mumbai, they implored Visnu and Siva to intervene. Together they created a Devi or Goddess with the explicit purpose of destroying Mumbaraka. In the ensuring fight, Mumbaraka was defeated, and in defeat the Goddess invited him to make a wish. He wished that his name and hers be joined 2 "Although the Mumbadev? Temple is not as striking as others are in the city, its resident deity, Mumbadev?, is the city's patron Goddess. The structure is about six centuries old, believed to be the handiwork of Mumb?raka, a sadistic giant who frequently plundered the city at that time. Terrorized by these unwelcome visits, the locals pleaded with Lord Brahma, Creator of all things to protect them. Brahma then 'pulled out of his own body', an eight armed goddess who vanquished the brute. Predictably brought to his knees, Mumb?raka implored Her Holiness to take his name and built a temple in her honour. She still stands there, an orange faced goddess on an altar strewn with marigolds: devotees believe that those who seek her divine favour are never disappointed." (Mumbadevi Temple, Mumbai on the Net, http://www.mumbainet.com/travel/Mumb?dev?.htm 3 Despite much effort, we have been unable to locate the Sanskrit Pur?na mentioned by Raghunathji.</page><page sequence="4">514 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT together to make 'Mumbadevl' and that the Goddess assume that name. Ever since then the people of Mumbai have worshipped the Goddess Mumbadevi. Raghunathji adds that the Mumbaraka to whom the myth refers is probably the Muslim king Mumbaraka the First, the head of an Islamic dynasty that ruled Mumbai in the early fourteenth century. Raghunathji adds that perhaps the name Mumbai had been given to the city by that Muslim ruler but that after his death, his unpopularity gave rise to a myth that was subsequently legitimised by the Brahmins in a Sanskritic Purana: It can also be supposed that the Emperor Mumbarak may have given this island his own name and called it Mumbapur or Mumbarak. That Emperor was a hater of the Hindu religion. For this reason the Hindus gave him the appellation of giant, and after his death composed the above account of his, which is now read and venerated as Puran. (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 31 footnote, para 4). S. M. Edwardes also refers to this myth of Mumbadevi but, in his case, we also discover that the person who first wrote about the myth and claimed that it was based on a Sanskrit Purana was Govind Narayan. He wrote an article about this in Bombay Past and Present (pp. 30-34 cited in Edwardes, 1909, vol. 1, p. 24 footnote i). Edwardes himself raises questions about whether Mumbaraka or rather Mubarak Shah 1 of Gujarat ever ruled Bombay, as his centre of power along the western Indian coast was Thane, on the mainland opposite the islands that constituted Bombay in the period of his reign from 1317 1320 (Edwardes, 1gog, vol. 2, p. 17). Muslim rule of this part of western India was shaky and alternated with Hindu overlordship until 1347. Thereafter, Bombay was fought over by the Muslim monarchs of the Deccan and the Gujarat for numerous centuries, although few Muslims settled on the islands of Mumbai.4 4 The temple of Mumbadev? is not the only one which comes down to the modern reader encased in a potential communal package. Edwards reported in 1909 that there was a local legend that said that Mah?laksm? was 'so persecuted during the period of Muslim rule that she leapt from the shore into the Varli creek and remained in hiding there until after the Portuguese had ceded the island to the English.' Local legend goes on to say that until a special temple had been re-built for Mah?laksm? at its present site opposite the equally famous Haji Ali darogha, the development of the central parts of Mumbai under the British continued to suffer from the rage of the Goddess expressed in the persistent inundation of land by seawater (Edwardes, 1909, vol. 3, pp. 356-357). In this instance, we are confronted by a myth that served the purposes of British rule. It was very useful for the British to find yet another legend that demonstrated the intolerance of the Muslim rulers whom they had displaced.</page><page sequence="5">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 515 The myths surrounding Mumbadev1 clearly reflect historical interpretations that were almost certainly created by the high castes, most probably the Brahmins. Indeed, it could signify the beginning of the appropriation of Mumbadevi by the high castes. One notes that the legend that links Mumbadevi to Mumbaraka also parallels the legends surrounding the origins of Durga, one of the most powerful manifestations of the Mother Goddess in India. In both cases, the power of the Devi is demonstrated through the slaying of the demon.5 A third myth related by Dave (1985, p. 245) states that the stone image of Mumbadevi in the temple by that name was brought by a merchant from its original location in Saurashtra where it had been worshipped by the maternal uncle (mdmd) of Ravana. It is said that the word Mumbadevi evolved from the term mama. In this instance, the legend of Mumbadevi links the worship of the Mother Goddess to the Gujarati community that has settled in Mumbai during the last four hundred years. In none of the other records we have consulted is there any evidence to verify this legend or explain it in greater detail. The fourth, most widespread and enduring myth about Mumbadevi states that Mumbadevi was first recognised and worshipped by the KolI tribal people, the original inhabitants of Bombay. This legend is also repeated on at least one internet site.6 Raghunathji also links the worship of Mumbadevi to the Koli fisherfolk. In 1goo he wrote that although nobody could remember who had 'consecrated' the Mumbadevi temple, local informants said that the consecration had happened some 400 or 500 years before at 'the expense of a certain 5 Clearly, the Brahmin author of the Pur?na wanted to show the supremacy and victory of a Hindu goddess over a Muslim tyrant. In the context of modern Mumbai, the Mumb?dev??Mumb?raka legend retains a particular potency given the history of Hindu-Muslim riots and bombings since 1992/1993 when the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants. Since the early 1990s, Mumbai has been characterised by communal tensions that have been deliberately encouraged by the ultra right wing Hindu fundamentalist parties, namely the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Given these circumstances, this particular myth of the origins of Mumb?dev? could be used to legitimise communal conflict. 6 "The temple was built in honour of the Goddess Mumbai, from whose name the word 'Mumbai' is derived. The original temple built by Kol? fishermen was demolished around 1737 and a new temple was erected in its place at Bhuleshwar. The modern shrine contains an image of the Goddess Mumb?dev? dressed in a robe with a silver crown, a nose ring and a golden necklace. To the left is a stone figure of Annap?rn? seated on a peacock. In front of the shrine is a tiger, the carrier of the Goddess. The Goddess personifies Mother Earth and is still worshipped by descendants of the Dravidian population of western and southern India. Tuesday is the chief day of worship." (Blessings on the Net, http://blessingsonthenet.com/temple/ tempdisplayi.asp?temple_id=Toi62&amp;deityid=Goo7o&amp;q=temple).</page><page sequence="6">516 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT fisherman.' Raghunathji found this myth of origins to be plausible, given the long history of Koli settlement in Mumbai. He also cited linguistic evidence suggesting that because a popular female name amongst the KolI is 'Munga', the Goddess was probably originally called 'Munga DevI' which later became corrupted as 'Mumbadevi'. His alternative hypothesis was that the Brahmins of Mumbai might have changed the 'ga' in Munga Devi to a 'b' as in Mumbadevi as it is usual with the Hindus to make changes and substitutions. (Raghunathji, 1 goo, p. 31, para. 1). However, not all Koli communities around Mumbai subscribe to the above myth. A recent interview with Kiran Koli7 (president of the Madh Island Fishermen's Co-operative Society near the western suburb of Andheri) revealed that Mumbadevi had no place in the mythology of these communities. Their myth did involve the seven asaras discussed later in this chapter, but Mumbadevi was not one of them. Somewhat surprisingly, the site of the Virgin Mary of Bandra was included in his list of the seven asaras. The association between the Kolis and Mumbadevi is also not universally acknowledged in literature. For example, in his account of the Kolis in 1922, Enthoven makes not a single reference to Mumbadevi or the Koli's connection to any Dcv1. Rather, his account of the religious beliefs of the Son Kolls,8 focused on their 'hinduisation' and in particular the manner in which they followed the teachings of Kalu Bhagat, a Koli guru who began to convert them to Hinduism during the times of the Peshwas (Enthoven, 1922, vol. 2, p. 259).9 According to Enthoven, the Kolis in the early part of the twentieth century worshipped Malhari-Martanda (Khandoba) at the Temple in Jejuri, which 'remains the chief shrine or centre of Koli worship'. (Enthoven, 1922, vol. 2, p. 259) The one thing on which British and Indian historians of Bombay agree is that the name Mumbadevi is a local, indigenous appellation rather than a Portuguese one. The Portuguese called Mumbai 'Bombaim'. Malabari noted in 9g1o that in the middle of the sixteenth century, the village and island of Bombaim was not known for anything 7 The authors are grateful to Sanjay Ranade who spoke to Kiran Koli on our behalf on March 17, 2005. 8 Enthoven notes the many different Kol? tribes of India and describes those of Mumbai and Maharashtra as belonging to the 'Son' group. 9 Enthoven uses the word 'Hinduising' to describe the changing beliefs of the Kol? (Enthoven, 1922, Vol. 2, p. 259).</page><page sequence="7">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 517 other than the location of 'the shrine of the old Hindu Goddess Mumbadevi (Malabari, 1910, p. 22). Malabari is adamant that the word Bombay itself is based on Mumbadevi (Malabari, 1910, p. 22, footnote +). Malabari also cites the view of Sir George Birdwood who also rejected, as many others have, the argument that the name 'Bombaim' derived from the Portuguese description of the natural harbour of Bombay as a 'good bay' or 'Boon-bay'. S. M. Edwardes, in his Gazetteer of 1909, provides a long list of European and Muslim travellers who referred to Bombay and the manner in which they spelt the name Bombay or Mumbai (Edwardes, 1 909, vol. 1, pp. 1 9-2o). The earliest of these references is to the Mirat-i-Ahmadi in 1507. After weighing up all the evidence, Edwardes also opted for the origins of the name Mumbai in the KolI Goddess Mumbadev1. (Edwardes, 1910, vol. 1, p. 21) To varying degrees, all these myths survive in the culture of modern Mumbai. The relationship between the myths and particular Bombay communities including the Kol, is, however, poorly documented. The rest of this chapter describes the physical manifestations of Mumbaqdevi in Mumbai today and the place of Mumbadev1 in the context of other Devi worship and more general worship. The Mumbadevi Temple The temple of Mumbadevi today is located behind Marine Lines, near the Gujarati cloth market. It was moved to this site in the nineteenth century from its prior location near the Victoria Terminus, Bombay's central railway station. According to Maria Graham who wrote her account in 1812, the temple was based in the 'Black Town' (Graham, 1812, p. 14). Other reports say that the original Mumbadevi temple was to be found in the Fort area of Mumbai until the British decided to rebuild that part of the town in 1737 (Edwardes, 1909, vol. 3, p. 357). Confusion about the history and location of the temple does not end here: some sources speak of the Mumbadevi temple on the Esplanade. The temple was rebuilt on its current site by a wealthy Marathi merchant from Bombay, one Pandusheth Sonar, of the goldsmith caste. His descendants were still managing the temple in 1909 (Raghunathji, 1909, p. 31). However, Edwardes agrees with this history but goes on to insist that tank in front of the temple and all the surrounding properties were the property of a Kapol Bania,</page><page sequence="8">518 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT Nagardas Navlakhya and his descendants (Edwardes, 1909, vol. 3, p. 359). The management of the temple, however, remained in the family of Pandusheth Sonar until 1888 when the advocate general of the Bombay Presidency filed a case against Vasudev Laxman, the husband of Pandusheth's granddaughter, for misappropriating temple funds. (Dave, 1987, pp. 248-249). On the 4th of October 1899 the court passed the temple administration to a committee of trustees. Because of the concentration of Gujarati merchants in the vicinity of the temple, the trustees would have been mainly Gujaratis and this has remained so to this date. This change in temple management may have at least partly contributed to the changing concentration of the worshippers who at first were predominantly the Marathi speaking Kolis and then increasingly Gujaratis. In the late nineteenth century, the guardian of the Mumbadevi shrine was a Gujarati Brahmin belonging to the Audich sub-caste (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 30). In 1900, the Marathi connection with Mumbadevi was revealed both in the clothing of the Devi (she wore Marathi drapes on ordinary days which were switched to silk for festive occasions) and in young married Koli couples visiting the temple to receive the Devi's blessings (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 30; Edwardes, 1909, vol. 3, p. 358). But already in 1900, the Koli were not the only community to have a special relationship with Mumbadev1. From 1900 till today, the Mumbadevi temple has formed part of a complex of nine temples dedicated to particular Gods and Goddesses. In the words of Raghunathji this group of adjacent temples constitute the 'Mumbadevi range'. Today all nine temples take it in turns to celebrate the nine nights of Navaratra. Edwardes, writing in 1909, noted that the other temples in addition to Mumbadevi were dedicated to Ganesa, Maruti, Mahadeva, Indrayan1, Murlidhara, Jagannatha, Narsoba and Balaji (Edwardes, 1909, vol. 3, p. 359). Raghunathji provides a detailed account of most of these but lists a number of additional temples that belonged to the same complex of shrines and adjacent rooms, namely, a second shrine to Narsoba, another room to Ganapati, a second Mahadeva shrine and two more shrines to Maruti. In Raghunathji's account, the most authoritative that is available, the Mumbadevi complex included no fewer than 14 shrines or temples. (Raghunathji, 1909, pp. 25-34) Temple pujaris or priests are chosen from all over India and at present there are two Marathis and four north Indian Brahmins providing this service. All the prayers and rituals are essentially brahamanical and the aratis (ritual songs) are often in the Gujarati</page><page sequence="9">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 519 language. '0 The temple properties are controlled by a trust, which has a majority of Gujarati members. We obtained conflicting information about the current involvement of the Koli community as devotees at the Mumbadevi temple. According to the Gujarati manager of the temple, these days the Kolis come to the Mumbadevi temple only once a year on Ekadas' Day when a Brahmin priest is employed to 'perform a Yagna at a specially built altar at the front of the temple.' This statement, however, was not substantiated by two pujaris at the temple who informed us that to their knowledge, no such ritual had taken place in the recent past. These pujaris had been there for eight years. Asked if Kolis attended the shrine regularly, the pujaris answered, 'we have no way of knowing if they do. These days people all wear the same gear and look the same. But there is certainly no special function for the KolI community as far as we know.' It is likely that there was a special day for the Kolis in days gone by and a Yagna for the KolI community was indeed performed. When Raghunathji wrote his description of the Mumbadevi temple, the sanctum sanctorum consisted of two stone images: that of the five feet Mumbadevi and to her left, the much smaller one foot image of Annapuirn. As it stands today, the shrine is divided into two alcoves and consists of three images. As the worshipper enters the inner sanctum, he finds that to the far left of the images is a silver Sri Yantra, the Mandala of creation, an ancient Indian geometrical image that captures the cosmic power associated with the goddess. The Yantra acts as a cosmic conductor of energy, an antenna of nature, and a symbol of creation, preservation and dissolution (Mookerji and Khanna, 1977, pp. 56-58). Next to the Sri Yantra is the image of Mumbadev1, which takes the form of an elaborately painted face covering the original stone, which is said to have arisen by itself (swayambhfi) from the seas surrounding Mumbai. Placed below this stone image is a brass tiger." To the right of Mumbadevi in a separate alcove are first the images of Durga and next to her, the much smaller image of Annapurna. Durga appears to be riding a large brass tiger 10 Dave (1987, pp. 238-244) devotes an entire chapter of his book to the Gujarati bhajans and ?rat?s sung at the temple. 11 The tiger was set up in 1890 (13 Sud Paoshya, Samvat 1947) by a pearl merchant Vithal Ischaram, and is daily washed and worshipped along with the Goddess (Raghunathji, 1900, pp. 29-30). Raghunathji says that the tiger was installed because it is the carrier of the Goddess. Mumbadev? at that time sat on a stone pedestal, and Annap?rn? was placed onto a peacock only during festivals.</page><page sequence="10">520 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT Figure i: Mumbadevi image (Photograph byJayant Bapat) (Figures 1, 2 and 3). When one of the authors of this chapter visited the temple inJanuary 2004, Durga carried a sword, but on a second visit in December 2004 the sword was absent. As it often happens with Indian gods and goddesses, the temple priests may add or remove the sword or other symbols at various times. During the second visit to the temple, a fourth image, that of the ubiquitous Ganesa, in the form of a calendar that had been hung just above the image of Annapuirna, was also present. The relative size of the goddesses gives some indication of their potency and importance for the temple: Mumbadevi is five feet high, Durga is about four feet and Annapurna is about a foot. The Sri Yantra is worshipped daily accompanied by chanting of the 'Sri Sfikta'. Installation of the Durga image and especially the Sri Yantra were obviously important steps in the Brahminization of the shrine. However, we were unable to ascertain when these changes were made.</page><page sequence="11">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 521 Figure 2: Durga and Annapurna Images Fiue 3. The ---i Yatr attetml (Potgrph byayn 1Bapat)i</page><page sequence="12">522 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT The most interesting thing about Raghunathji's description of the Mumbadev1 temple in 1900 is that there is no reference to the image of Durga. Given his detailed description of this centrepiece of the Mumbadev1 complex, we must assume that there was no image of Durga in the Mumbadevi temple at this time. Rather, Raghunathji notes the five-foot high image of Mumbadevi was accompanied by the one-foot high Annapurn-a image to the left of the Goddess. Annap-urn-a was 'seated on a stone peacock' on festival days. If this description is correct, then sometime during the twentieth century the image of Durga was added to these two and interposed between Mumbadevi and Annapfirna. In other words, Raghunathji's description helps us to understand the process of Sanskritisation that has been taking place in the Mumbadevi temple over the last hundred years. Evidence of Sanskritisation was already obvious in Raghunathji's inventory. For example, on the verandah at the entrance to the Mumbadevi shrine stood a 'four-foot high brass tiger' that Raghunathji describes as the 'Goddess carrier (Raghunathji, 1909, p. 29). It is more than likely that this same tiger now seats the new image of Durga that has been added since then to the Mumbadevi temple. However, the association of Mumbadevi with Durga was even older than this new tiger image that was installed in 1890, for Raghunathji notes that an 'old - rough stone' tiger image was lying in a 'corner of the compound'. (Raghunathji, 1909, p. 29) Further evidence of Sanskritization occurs in Raghunathji's description of the festival of Ashwin (October-November) when the keeper 'arranged Mumbadevi in her richest silks and costliest ornaments, and lays besides her a drawn sword and a shield' (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 30). In this sentence, the association of Mumbadevi with Durga is firmly established with the coming together of the images of the tiger, sword and shield. In 1900, however, Sanskritisation had not yet totally obliterated the pre-Hindu forms of worship at the Mumbadevi shrine. For example, at the start of Ashwin a reserved area before the entrance to the temple was planted with rice and millet. The fledgling crop was sown at the end of Ashwin (October November); the 'pale seedlings' were pulled out and presented to the Goddess (Raghunathji, 1909, p. 30). This ancient fertility rite no longer survives at the temple. In 1900 the links between the Koli and Mumbadevi were also stronger than they are now - on their wedding day KolJ couples used to come to Mumbadev1 for the blessings of the Goddess. (Raghunathji 1909, p. 30)</page><page sequence="13">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 523 Clearly, during the last one hundred years, Mumbadev1 has become more thoroughly Hinduised and made to blend more closely with the familiar representation of the Hindu Goddess Durga. During the ten day Durga festival in March each year, Durga's slaying of the buffalo headed demon Mahisasura is commemorated and all the temples at Mumbbadevi are honoured. The devotees do not distinguish between Durga and Mumbadev1, although they prefer to call the main temple and the images 'Mumbadevi'. The Devi, in other words, incorporates in her essence Durga, the protector and Annapurna, the provider. Both belong to the brahmanic pantheon and the much older Mumbadev1, the tribal Goddess of the original Koli inhabitants of Mumbai. Such confluences are common in India, and have been noted by amongst others, Fritz and Michell in their study of Vijayanagara. Here the river Pampa is associated with the original devi of Hampi, the local Goddess Pampa. Pampa became absorbed into the greater Hindu tradition by marrying the God Viruipaksa (an aspect of Shiva). Despite this, 'both god and site are defined in terms of the goddess'. (Fritz and Michell, 1991, pp. 49-50) The melding of Mumbadevi and Durga was probably facilitated by the importance of tiger worship amongst the Kolis. According to Dalmia, the Kolis share with other western Indian tribal people 'a common religious awe of the Tiger God, roughly carved wooden statues of him can be seen installed in all parts of the district' [of Thane] (Dalmia, 1988, p. 13). The Tiger God made Durga, whose vehicle is the Tiger, totally acceptable to the Kolis while for the Hindus the representation of the Tiger God made Mumbadevi totally compatible with the Hindu pantheon and Durga.12 Earlier on in her study of the Warli, Dalmia notes that 'the Warlis seize the Hindu festivals and make them their own with true poetic justice' (Dalmia, 1988, p. 58). Similar judgements can be applied to the relationship between Hindu and Koli beliefs in Mumbai and, more specifically, between the enthusiasm with which Mumbadevi and Durga have been worshipped by both the Koli and other Hindu communities. The confluence of Durga, Annapfirna and Mumbadevi also reflects the compatible characteristics of the Hindu Devi and the tribal Dev1, both of them extremely powerful and both of them tracing their 12 Figure 57 in Dalmia's study depicts a statue of a woman riding a tiger, further evidence of the potential compatibility of tiger worship and Durg? worship (Dalmia, 1988, p. 71).</page><page sequence="14">524 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT ancestry to the original Mother Goddess of India. The blending of the two Devi traditions was obviously facilitated by the unique characteristics of Durga. Of all the Hindu Goddesses, Durga stands alone; she is a virgin, unmarried and unaccompanied by any male partner. Durga is nobody's consort. Mahisasura the demon desired her and tried to seduce her, but she cut off his head. In destroying the demon she demonstrated her supreme power even over the Gods, as none of the Gods, individually or collectively, had been able to kill the demon (Wangu, 2003, p. 176). The pedigree of Durga is no less impressive than that of the original Koli tribal Goddess. It has been said that Durga's status as an Indian Goddess can be traced to the Indus Valley civilisation. Numerous seals depict images of the proto Durga: some show a Devi-like image accompanied by a tiger; others show the Dev1 emerging from a tree and hypnotising a tiger or in dialogue with it; and a third group show the Dev1 as having a human torso and a tiger's body (Hiltebeitel cited in Wangu, 2003, pp. 25-26; Jayakar, 1989, pp. 67, 72-76). The ferocious independence of Durga is an apt reflection of the equally independent, and equally important Mumbadev1. It is not that one is superior to the other; rather the two have co-mingled. This was recognised by scholars such as Pupul Jayakar and Wendell Beane, who have described the beliefs and rituals surrounding the Earth Mother throughout India. According toJayakar, When she entered the Puranic pantheon, the virgin Earth Mother became Durga, and, changing with provenance and tribe, her names and anthropomorphic forms are legion. (Jayakar, 1989, p. 156) In his analysis of the Devibhagavata Purana, Beane has shown that while the work describes Devi in her various forms, the primary intention of the work is the worship of the mother earth. (Beane, 1977, p. 64) The legends and beliefs surrounding Durga also have political potency. After the composition of Valmiki's Ramayana, many other Rama stories incorporated Durga coming to the assistance of Rama in establishing a stable polity (Kinsley, 1998. pp. 108-1o9). The reputation and popularity of Durga was further strengthened in western India through the heroic exploits of Shivaji, the Maratha leader who challenged and won out over the Mughal armies. Popular accounts of the victories of Shivaji over Afzal Khan, the Mughal General, say that Shivaji's sword was victorious because Durga Bhavani had entered it (Kinsley, 1998, pp. 109-1 io). The sword is one</page><page sequence="15">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 525 of the symbols of Durga's power and Shivaji named his sword Bhavn-1. Popular cloth posters of Durga sold on the streets of Mumbai show her with eight arms and wielding a sword in the right hand of the lower most arm. A South Indian Chola bronze from c. 1,000 AD shows that in earlier times Durga also had eight arms (Kinsley, 1998, p. 103, photograph of Durga with eight arms). Mumbadev1, in her own right and as a manifestation as Durga, is clearly the protector of the city of Mumbai as all the legends associated with her are stories of protection. On the other hand, the image of Annapfirna, who sits next to the image of Durga as part of the temple triad, brings in the benign aspect of the Devi as the mother goddess and completes the picture. She is the provider, nourisher and sustainer. She is Parvat1, the mother of the world. She is the great Mother Goddess manifested as the Goddess of the harvest, food and of cooking. She represents the other side of the Dev1, namely the nurturer. The rites of planting seeds and offering the sprouting seedlings to the Goddess, which were observed at the Mumbadevi Temple at least up to the late nineteenth century (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 30), explicitly celebrated that characteristic of Annapnrna. The rituals of nourishment are not merely linked to pre-historic or animistic beliefs but also express the highest forms of spiritual nourishment. The three images together thus represent a synthesis of brahmanic and folk Hinduism to represent the Devi in all her aspects. Not surprisingly, the most important festival that involved Mumbadevi was and remains Dussera, a ten-day celebration in the month of Ashwin of the Hindu calendar. Throughout India, Dussera celebrates the Mother Goddess, who in the case of Mumbai, is simultaneously Mumbadev1. In his description of Dussera in the early twentieth century, Edwardes writes: The largest gatherings take place at Mumbadevi, Bhuleshwar and Madhav Baug. Here the people worship the shami or apta tree, and after offering leaves to the Goddess distribute them among their friends and relatives. (Edwardes, 1909, vol. 1, p. 173) Again, the inclusive nature of Devi worship should be noted here-not only were the largest gatherings outside the largest temple complexes but again throughout India, Dussera has involved honouring all the Goddesses and Gods even though Durga is the centre of attention during this festival.</page><page sequence="16">526 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT Mumbadevi in the Context of the Mother Goddesses of Mumbai Mumbadevi is not the only Mother Goddess worshipped in Mumbai. Raghunathji's 1900 inventory lists a total of 403 temples of which 70 (17%) were Devi temples (Appendix 1). Appendix 2 provides a list of these Devi temples. An analysis of this material showed that the most numerous temples were to Kali (22), followed by 17 toJari Mari, the Goddess of Life and Death (sometimes described as the Cholera Goddess), eight to Sitala Dev1, the Smallpox Goddess, nine to Rakhma1, five to Laksmi and four to Radha (Appendix 2). The Kolis of Mumbai also worshipped a surprisingly large number of Devis and Devas in 1900, despite the myth that they were mainly followers of Mumbddev1. Appendix 2 shows that at the end of the nineteenth century, the Kolis also revered Laksm1, Kalka Dev1, Chandika Dev1, Cheda Devi, Golba Devi, Mhasoba, Jari Mari, Sitalamata, a sand lingam, and many others. Appendix 2 also shows that many devi temples in Mumbai were founded by Kolis. Recent visits to Mumbai and a study of the various works on the Koli tribes have confirmed that the religious beliefs of the Kolis have remained far more inclusive than the mythology of the temple of Mumbadevi would suggest (Ghurye, 1963, p. 190; Punekar, Ch. 7). 13 According to the head of one of the Koli Samaj (Association) of Mumbai,14 the Kolis today worship no less than nine Goddesses. There are about 23 Koli villages remaining in modern Mumbai. The seven that we have visited are dedicated to different Devis including Khadadevi, Harbadevi, Hingladevi, KhamgadevI, Mahalaksmi and the Virgin Mary. In addition to these Devis, the Koli also revere minor goddesses, the asaras or water spirits.15 It is said that these seven spirits are sisters, and they are accompanied by their seven brothers. In many of the Koli temples that we have seen, each of the brothers has a shrine at the entrance to the main goddess temple. It is traditional to pay one's respects to the brothers first before proceeding to the main Devi shrine. 13 Surprisingly, neither Ghurye nor Punekar mention any connection between the Mahadev Kolis or the Son Kolis and Mumb?dev?. 14 Interview with Damodar Tandel, January 2005. 15 The asaras are malevolent water spirits. The concept of a deity with both benign and fierce aspects, while common in Hinduism, is even stronger in folk tradition. The asaras, being water spirits, are naturally close to the Kol? mind and prayers are offered frequently so that they do not bring harm to the devotee. In their benign aspect, they guard the devotee against calamities.</page><page sequence="17">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 527 In Mumbai today, as in the rest of the state of Maharashtra, the supreme Goddess of the Kolis is Ekavird Devi. Her principal shrine is located opposite the Karla caves near Karjat. This contradicts the old myth that the main Goddess of the Kolis is Mumbadevi."6 The nature of worship around the Ekavira Devi temple is the subject of a forthcoming paper. Ekavira Devi has a considerable retinue of other Goddesses. We have visited seven Koli temples in Mumbai and discovered that each of them has a particular Goddess manifestation unique to that temple. The first of these studied by us is a temple built around the swayambhfi (self arising) stone image said to be that of Khadadevi. Khadadevi is the Goddess of the Cuff Parade Koli Village, but her shrine is located within the compound of the Colaba Police Station, about a kilometre away from the village. A separate paper about this temple and the rituals around it will soon be published by us. Our fieldwork has shown that even if a Koli temple is dedicated to a special, favourite local Goddess this does not happen to the exclusion of other Devis and Devas. The other objects of worship in the Colaba Koli temple include Ganesa, Laksm1, Maruti and even Buddha. In this manner, the Colaba shrine is a microcosm of the complex beliefs and worship of Mumbai's citizens. Raghunathji's report of 1900 already noted a similar cosmopolitan mixture. His inventory establishes for us the basic principle of a Hindu temple in Mumbai: in addition to the main deity many smaller shrines appear inside temples in order to accommodate a range of personal and family favourites. Hence Raghunathji reports that a shrine to Sitaladevi was to be found on the steps to the Siddheshwara Temple (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 217) and also at the entrance to the Mahadeva temple (Raghunathji, 1900, p. 256). Thus, the name by which a particular temple or temple complex is known is insufficient to determine which Goddesses and Gods were actually worshipped at these shrines by the devotees. Indeed, the conclusion that springs from Raghunathji's account is that it would be futile to attempt to develop a hierarchy of Goddesses and Gods as an index to what was more popular and what was less popular. It would be more sensible to simply note the complexity of the Hindu pantheon and the diversity of worship that continued to ensure an important place to the Devi, the Mother Goddess and protectress of 16 The manager of the Mumbadev? shrine, Mr. N.D. Kanabar, who has held the position for over 20 years, agreed with the temple pujaris when he claimed that he was unaware of the belief that Mumbadev? was the main goddess of the Ko?ls. (Interview with Kanabar and the pujaris, January 2005).</page><page sequence="18">528 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT India and the protectress of Mumbai in the form of Mumbadev1. These observations are as pertinent today as they were in 1900. We can apply an interesting test to this argument. Modern scholarship has noted that at the time that Raghunathji was compiling his inventory, the Indian nationalist leader Tilak was vigorously campaigning to establish the Ganapati festival and veneration of Ganesa as a major expressions of the nationalist sentiment of the Indian masses. As Kaur has noted, during the 189os the images of Ganesa assumed an increasingly ferocious and warlike demeanour (Kaur, 2002, pp. 69-75). Despite this only thirteen or a mere three percent of the temples listed by Raghunathji were specifically dedicated to Ganesa. Of course, Ganesa was worshipped in many of Bombay's temples and smaller shrines and at home, and remained a very popular god throughout the city. But in no way was this different from the worship of other Devas and Devis. Thus we learn from Raghunathji that even at the height of Tilak's campaigns during the 189os Ganesa did not achieve the kind of privileged position that modern historians sometimes have assumed. We believe that similar assumptions can be made today about Rama. Hindu fundamentalists have tried to elevate Rama into the supreme Hindu God, but there is little evidence to show that this has succeeded with the Hindu masses of India, including those living in Mumbai. Another temple, that of Laksmi-Ndrayana at old Nagpada road, was described by Raghunathji as of recent origin in 1900. Interestingly, this shrine had been originally built by a Koli fisherwoman only 12 years before (Raghunathji, 1900, pp. 161-162). At the centre of the shrine were two white marble images of Laksmi and Narayana, but other images such as those of Ganapati, Vithoba and Rakhmai and Hindu religious symbols were also scattered throughout the - 17 premises Raghunathji's description of the proliferation of Devi worship is something of which we have a better understanding today, thanks to the work of Hawley and McKean. The key realisation is that the Devis and Devas of India are not static entities. Rather, they are constantly 17 As it is well known, the worship of Laksm? and N?r?yana is prevalent in the Gujarati Brahmin community. The proliferation of other gods and goddesses around it suggests that it was a typical Brahmanic Panc?yatana temple where at least four other gods are worshipped in addition to the main deity, as decreed by the Adi Sankar?c?rya. A Kol? shrine on the other hand, is more likely to house an unsculpted stone as the presiding deity. Therefore, it is most likely that if a Koli fisherwoman did originally build it, it was hinduised soon after that.</page><page sequence="19">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 529 evolving and indeed giving birth to new incarnations. Hawley has described the emergence of a new Dev1, Santos' Ma, through the medium of Bollywood (Hawley, 1996, pp. 3-9) and McKean has analysed the complex interplay between nationalism, culture and religious belief in her description of the emergence of Bharat-Mata or Mother India (McKean, 1996, pp. 250-280). More recently Madhu Kishwar has reported the birth of yet another Devi in Delhi, the Cleanliness Goddess who is newly venerated by the street vendors. (Kishwar, 2005, pp. 1-13) Despite its unique qualities, Raghunathji's inventory is by no means a complete account of the Hindu temples of Mumbai in 1900. For example, Ranade's list of houses of worship, published in 2004 for western Mumbai names many temples which should have appeared on Raghunathji's account. One of these is the Harbadevi-Haradadevi temple at Madh Island near the Fort of Mumbai. According to Ranade, this shrine was rebuilt in 1954 but its origin dates to the early thirteenth century (Ranade, 2004, p. 42). Ranade has judged the existing site to be worthy of excavation and conservation for beneath the modern renovations lies the original temple dating to the Yadava era. The present temple is a very plain structure that remains intimately linked with the local Koli community who sheltered in the temple during the freakish weather conditions created off the coast of Mumbai by the Indonesian tsunami on Boxing Day 2004 (Thakurdesai,2005). As noted earlier, Harbadevi-Hardadevi is one of the Goddesses worshipped by the Kolis. The Madh Island temple is devoted to her but also to Hanuman. (Ranade,2004, p.42) 18 Mother Goddesses Within the Context of Hindu Worship in Mumbai Today As in 1900 and before, many of Mumbai's Hindu temples today are dedicated to the Devi in her various incarnations. It is unlikely that modernity has had any impact on reducing the number of worshippers who follow even those manifestations of the Devi that may appear to outsiders to be increasingly irrelevant. For example, it would be easy but foolish to conclude that the eradication of smallpox has reduced the followers of Sitalamata or that the social reform movement to 18 There is another temple on Madh island that is associated with the life of the Kol?s, namely the Killeshwar Mahadev Mandir (Ranade, 2004, p. 41).</page><page sequence="20">530 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT stamp out the devadasi system of offering young girls to the Goddess Yellama has caused the Goddess Yellama to be neglected.'9 For the vast majority of Mumbai's citizens, worship is not driven only or primarily by practical needs but rather by faith and belief, or by practical needs to which the most comforting response is belief and faith. This has not changed since Raghunathji published his study in 1900. There is another shrine of great popularity and durability in Mumbai. One large marble post on the corner of an elaborate cast iron fence that surrounds a former merchant's mansion of Mumbai has evolved into a holy Christian site. There is a cross at the top of the pillar and beneath it a grilled enclosure that houses figures representing the Virgin Mary and the babyJesus. Day and night, candles at the bottom of the pillar burn brightly and every Wednesday evening hundreds of people from all religious persuasions come to offer their respects in return for the hope that their wishes will be granted. Throughout Mumbai, Wednesday evening is an occasion of popular worship that brings non-Christians into the company of Christians to celebrate Novena. In the large Christian churches of Mumbai, a special prayer meeting is held after the evening mass, to help the needy and people of non-Christian faith are welcomed. In observing the popularity of the Mother Mary at this shrine it is hard not to imagine that many of the Hindu worshippers are in effect placing their hopes and fears before yet another incarnation of the Devil. As mentioned earlier, the Virgin Mary actually assumes the form of one of the seven sisters or asaras revered by the Koli community of Madh island. They have a special KoJi name for her, 'Maut Mauli'. Connections between the KolI devis and the Virgin Mary appear in many other stories about the beliefs of the original tribal inhabitants of Mumbai. For example, the well-known Church of the Virgin Mary at Bandra is said to have originally been a sacred site on which there once sat a Koli shrine. The potency of the Devi affects all aspects of life in contemporary Mumbai, depending on the beliefs and wishes of the individual worshipper. The majority of taxi drivers have images of Hindu Goddesses and Gods and burn incense while driving their clients. Many small shrines exist in shops; for example in 2005 the camera shop opposite the Regal Cinema displayed a tiny Ganesa with red jewelled eyes sitting on top of a glass display case. It is the benign form 19 Some estimates suggest that the annual dedication of girls has fallen from between six and ten thousand to about two thousand.</page><page sequence="21">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 531 of Ganesa that is now popular, rather than the warrior form of the nationalist movement (Kaur, 2003, p. 3). Interstate and international calling booths also have their favourite deities depicted on postcards and posters hung with marigolds amongst the most popular shrines are those to Durga. Street vendors and handicraft shops sell cloth and paper posters of all Goddesses and Gods in many sizes, colours and decorative styles. The most expensive posters are covered in glass beads and sequins stitched to the painted surfaces, giving them a shimmering quality. Again, Durga, KMfi, Laksm1, Parvati and Sita are great favourites. The Shiv Sena has not campaigned against these representations of the Hindu pantheon, in contrast to its other campaigns to ban the use of the images of Goddesses and Gods on wrapping paper and shopping bags. Even Internet cafes have small shrines devoted to the proprietor's favourite deity. In one of the largest Internet cafes in Colaba, it is not uncommon to come across tourists coughing uncontrollably because of the copious volumes of incense that the manager burns in front of his six-inch high brass Durga. The most dramatic recent example of the importance of the Devi to modern Mumbai occurred when Govinda, one of India's best known Bollywood actors, won the seat for North Mumbai in the national elections of May 2004. Prior to contesting the election as a member of the Indian National Congress Party (headed up by Sonia Gandhi), Govinda returned to his home-town of Virar and prayed to the Devi housed in the temple of Jivdani (Kumar, 2004; Lokhande, 2004b; Lokhande, 2004c). Virar is the final station at the end of Mumbai's suburban railway line. After a landslide victory which gave him a margin of over 4% against the incumbent minister for petroleum Ram Naik (Parliamentary Constituency: North Mumbai, 2004),20 Govinda returned to Virar to thank the Goddess by climbing the 1,200 steps to her shrine to pray before the image (puja) (Lokhande, 2004a). Govinda apparently had had no intention of entering politics but was invited to do so by Sonia Gandhi (Jha, 2004). Sonia herself comes from a dynastic family, which reached the pinnacle of its power under Indira Gandhi, widely described throughout India as Mahasakti-a term which translates as 'Great Female Power ' and is usually reserved to describe the potency of the Great Mother Goddess, the Devi. The sensational result of the May 2004 national elections, in which five out of six Mumbai seats fell into the hands of the Congress Party 20 Govinda won 50.01 per cent of the votes and Ram Naik 45.7%.</page><page sequence="22">532 MARIKA VICZIANY AND JAYANT BAPAT after the dominance of the BJP for some ten years, has no doubt further increased the popularity of the temple atJivdani.Jivdani has been growing in importance during the last two decades with some 25,000 devotees attending there every Sunday (Manju, 2004). Temple practices today include not only the usual blessings and offerings but also animal sacrifices. In response to the increasing pressure of pilgrims, temple renovations began in 1996 under the guidance of the renowned Mumbai temple architect Hariprasad H. Sompura ('Temple on hill gets a facelift ', i996). Conclusion Although very little is known about the history, culture and archaeology of the Devis of Mumbai, every so often the international press reminds everyone about the importance of the Goddesses of India. One such event occurred on 25 January 2005 when some 265 pilgrims were killed and more than 200 injured during a fire and stampede at the western Indian temple of Kalubai or Mandhardev1. Kalubai is one of the manifestations of Durga who is in turn one of the manifestations of the Mother Goddess of India. Like many other popular Devis in rural India, Kalubai originally belonged to the smaller tradition of village India and was worshipped as a matrkd or guardian goddess who ensured that the village was kept safe from harm. Today, the worship of KalubaI at Mandhardevi near Wai, about 250 kilometers south of Mumbai, has become a grander affair attracting some 300,000 pilgrims a year to the full moon festival (AP, 2005). The popularity of the Mandhardevi Temple near Wai is a microcosm of the high regard that remains for the Devi in cosmopolitan Bombay. Although the BJP attempted to elevate Rama to unprecedented heights of cultural and political importance, the Dev1, in all her various manifestations, retains a vigorous presence in the physical structure of Mumbai and in the hearts of her citizens. The temple of Mumbadev1 is only one of the thousands of temples that are scattered throughout the city, and the temples are only one manifestation of the religious life of Mumbai's citizens. Both the temples and the religious life of Mumbai are poorly researched and understood, with myths taking the place of established fact and scholarship. In that mythology, the Kolis have a special relationship with Mumbadev1.</page><page sequence="23">MOTHER GODDESS IN MUMBAI 533 As this paper has argued, since the early twentieth century, the hinduisation of the Kolis has resulted in their worshipping many Hindu Gods and Goddesses. First noted by Enthoven, hinduisation has continued without undermining the potency of Mumbadevi or other earlier Devis in Mumbai. Hinduisation has been accompanied by a parallel process amongst the Marathi and Gujarati communities in particular-these have appropriated Mumbadevi and incorporated her into their own Sanskritised traditions. The Mukteshwar Mandir in modern dayJuhu represents yet another example of this infinitely complex interaction between the Koli and the Hindu communities of ancient and modern Bombay. Built in i668 on a site long worshipped by the Kolis, the temple was rebuilt in the nineteenth century and again during the 1980s and today is the property of the Mukteshwar Devalaya Trust (Ranade, 2004, p. 26). But perhaps the most important conclusion we have reached about the potency of the Devis of Mumbai today is that they have not been overthrown by Rama despite the efforts to harness religious belief to the agenda of narrow minded, Hindu fundamentalist political parties. Thus, the Shiv Sena of contemporary Mumbai have failed, as did Tilak in the nineteenth century, to codify Hindu religious thought into a simplistic straight jacket of political narrative. Instead, contemporary Mumbai preserves the eclectic and syncretic traditions of western India in a celebration of religious diversity that provides the observer with an exuberant culture of complex religious practice and thought.
