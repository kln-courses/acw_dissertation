<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bells of Russia: History and Technology. By Edward V. Williams. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. xix+276; illustrations, tables, notes, glossary, appendixes, bibliography, in- dex. $60.00. If ever there was a book that could be said to epitomize the spirit of thisjournal, this fascinating volume is it. Edward Williams, professor of music history at the University of Kansas, has reviewed the technolog- ical, musicological, liturgical, and cultural history of bells in Russia over the past 1,000 years in a skillfully integrated account. The success of the endeavor derives in no small part from the fact that the author combines the skills of a musician, a historian, and a linguist. Bronze bells have been made at least since 2600 B.c. Thus, early in the Bronze Age man discovered that alloys in the Cu-Sn family in the vicinity of 20 percent tin gave an optimum balance of resilience (high elastic rebound), resonance (low damping), corrosion resistance, and lowered melting point (hence readily castable). The bell as a musical instrument, outstanding in combining high intensity of sound with pleasing tones, has also been associated with ritual and liturgical activi- ties for a very long time-specifically with Christian services since A.D. 535. Williams traces the history of bells in Russia from the 1 1th century, when they were first introduced from Western Europe, to the 1917 Revolution, which marked the end of bell founding in Russia. In the</page><page sequence="2">854 Book Reviews TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE interim, Russian bell founders surpassed their West European teachers in the size, quality, and decorative character of the bells they produced. (The Grigiorev bell of 1665 was, at 361,130 lbs., the largest ever rung in Russia; and the gigantic Tsar Kolokol, at over 216 tons, was successfully cast but broken before it was raised.) Their work embraced some of the most challenging technical problems of their time in three different areas: founding (the Tsar Kolokol required a coordinated pour of 6 tons/minute), raising (objects of over 100 tons to heights of 100-200 feet), and tuning (via both mold design and me- chanical cutting). The role of bells in Russia is perhaps unique to that culture, in what amounts to a virtual obsession with the instrument. At the beginning of the 17th century, Moscow alone is said to have had over 6,000 bells. Their collective sound (zvon) was not simply impressive but virtually ear shattering. Williams also shows that Russian bell technology and culture present a hybrid of European and Far Eastern traditions, although imbued with unique Russian elements. The Russians im- puted an anthropomorphic character to their bells, in that individual bells were baptized, blessed, named, captured, flogged, and even sent into exile! Only a small fraction of all Russian bells cast survive, because of the ravages of war, fire, and the antireligious attitude of the Soviet regimes. War was particularly devastating because the alloy "gunmet- al" is very close in composition to that used for bells. Hence many bells were taken down and melted to be recast as cannon in the 15th to 19th centuries. To the main text, Williams has added an equal quantity of scholarly apparatus: some fifty-five pages of notes, a bibliography of over 500 citations, a glossary of special terms in founding and campanology, and several appendixes covering lists of bell founders, bell geometries and weights, and lists of individual bells. He plans a subsequent volume that will treat the role of bells in Russian rites and their influence in architecture, in liturgical music, and as aural icons. The account is intriguing, well coordinated and fully researched. It might have been improved in but two areas: first, a better explication of the physical metallurgy of bells is needed (Williams fails to note the detailed work of Schad and Warlimont [Metall 1 (1972): 10 and Acous- tica 29 (1973): 1], which explains that bell quality results not from optimal control of composition but from good casting practice, which minimizes internal voids and hence lowers damping capacity). Second, and surprisingly, the relation of the theory of acoustics and of musical scales to the geometry of bells and modes of striking is more assumed and alluded to than clearly explained. J. H.
