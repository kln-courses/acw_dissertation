<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> SANTOS CASADO AND SANTIAGO ARAGO ́N* Vignettes of Spanish Nature: Imagining a National Fauna at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid (1910—1936) ABSTRACT Taxidermy played a pivotal role in the renewal of the Spanish Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid during the first few decades of the twentieth century. This essay examines the work of the brothers Jose ́ Marı ́a Benedito (1873–1951) and Luis Benedito (1884–1955) and their part in the making of a remarkable series of biological groups and habitat dioramas, mainly devoted to the most characteristic species of Spanish fauna. The Benedito brothers’ taxidermy mounts can be viewed as an attempt to construct a new image of a national fauna. From this point of view, taxidermic practices appear as an integral component of an ambitious educational and cultural project, with their foundations in the scientific work of the museum’s zoologists, and aimed at a broad, educated public, at a time of widespread political effort to reinvigorate Spanish society. Indeed, efforts to regenerate a troubled Spanish national identity and to promote science and education as drivers of social progress are typical of the critical turn-of-the-century period. In this context, the Benedito brothers’ work at the museum can be related both to an international trend to modernize natural history displays in museums around the world, and to more specific cultural and scientific developments characteristic of the processes of mod- ernization at work in early twentieth-century Spanish society.

KEY WORDS: taxidermy, museum history, natural history displays, nationalism and science, Jose ́ Marı ́a Benedito, Luis Benedito, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (Madrid) Taxidermy, especially as embodied by specimens and displays in natural his- tory museums, has provided an attractive subject for scholars anxious to ‘‘get beyond the consideration of the surface’’ of things; in this case, the surface or skin of stuffed animals.1 Taxidermy mounts have been revisited in search of the relationship or, even better, the ‘‘entanglement’’ of ‘‘nature and culture,’’ ‘‘specimen and artefact,’’ ‘‘techniques and meanings,’’ ‘‘art and science,’’ and so on, as a recent survey of ‘‘nature behind glass’’ has shown.2 A considerable amount of impenetrable jargon has thus accumulated around the stuffed remnants of antelopes, gorillas, eagles, bears, and the like. Among many other possibilities, they have been seen as providing ‘‘a close encounter with subju- gated wilderness, capturing something of the surrealist readymade,’’ or as ‘‘excessive material entities resisting complete ‘containment’ and retaining both aesthetic and ontological ambiguity.’’3 Beyond its scientific or educational value, a taxidermy specimen can be a ‘‘kind of transitional object,’’ a ‘‘transi- tional vehicle to help move between different kinds of knowing, a creature that can subvert our attention, under the skin.’’4 This essay adopts a more modest approach. We will attempt to situate a particular set of taxidermy displays, those produced by Jose ́ Mar ́ıa Benedito and Luis Benedito for the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid, in the context of the nationalization and modernization processes at work in early 1.

These studies also look at the new ways to apprehend nature and show it to broader publics that were developed by museum scientists, man- agers, curators, collectors, and taxidermists alike. Taxidermy, especially in the form of biological groups and habitat dioramas, has been identified as a key component in a widespread process of museum reform in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.6 However, little or no effort has been devoted to tracking the reception of these taxidermic practices in peripheral countries, as well as their subsequent acclimatization in new social and scientific contexts. In this paper, we explore particular historical trajectories in which the cultural meanings and purposes of museum taxidermy were reframed locally. Modern taxidermy has been incorporated in various ways into political and cultural discourses contingent on national contexts, while its technical proce- dures have essentially continued unchanged. In particular, we aim to broaden 5.

This reworking took place in the highly specific context of the aftermath of Spain’s turn-of-the-century crisis, so as to serve the new goals set by Spanish political and intellectual leaders within a broad project of nationalist modernization focused on science and education as tools of national regeneration. Moreover, the acclimatization of the habitat group in Madrid was dependent on con- tingencies both at an institutional and individual level. Acknowledging the influence of such contingencies as we follow the taxidermic career of the Benedito brothers not only serves as a reminder of the importance of studying local contexts and cases in order to understand broader historical processes of scientific and cultural change; it is also a safe way to avoid any temptation to write this story following the template of a simple, unidirectional, diffusionist narrative about the evolution of exhibits in natural history museums.

Established in 1771 during the scientific bonanza brought about by the reign of Charles III, a king usually regarded as the most enlightened among Spanish Bourbon monarchs, the originally named Real Gabinete de Historia Natural underwent a prolonged phase of decadence during the nine- teenth century.9 The reversal of this negative trend, prompted by a growing concern about the promotion of science in fin-de-sie`cle Spain, provides the dynamic background against which the taxidermic work of the Benedito brothers can best be viewed. Their stuffed animals were part and parcel of the broader modernization efforts pursued at the museum. The museum was, in turn, an institutional microcosm where the aspirations for cultural and edu- cational reform, promoted by a new scientifically minded Spanish elite, were being put to work, as will be shown later. In the following pages we will first provide a short account of the changes that occurred at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales during the turn-of- the-century period, under the charismatic leadership of Ignacio Bol ́ıvar. Next, we will focus on the professional development of the Benedito brothers at the museum. A discussion of their taxidermic work and its relationship to various aspects of Spanish science, culture, and national identity follows in the sub- sequent three sections. A final conclusion section summarizes the main points discussed in this essay, highlighting those elements that tell an alternative story, without losing touch with the interpretive framework afforded by an interna- tional comparative perspective. A NATIONAL MUSEUM The arrival of the Benedito brothers at the Museo de Ciencias Naturales was particularly timely. Once Ignacio Bol ́ıvar had become director of the museum in 1901, a thorough process of renewal and reorganization was launched, although progress was slow at the beginning due to a lack of institutional support. Bol ́ıvar, an entomologist by training, was an apt organizer and had been anxious to enhance the museum’s research capabilities since he first entered the center as an assistant zoologist in 1875. For a number of years he 9. For a factual history of the Real Gabinete and the Museo Nacional see Agust ́ın J. Barreiro, El Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (Aranjuez, Madrid: Doce Calles, 1992).

The Junta established in 1910 a new Instituto de Ciencias Fı ́sico- Naturales, which incorporated several preexisting research centers, together with newly created laboratories. These centers, old and new, nevertheless maintained their institutional identity within the Instituto.11 Bol ́ıvar, seizing the opportunities opened up by the new institutional framework, managed to transform the museum into one of the leading centers of the Junta. Space, or lack of it, however, remained a key issue—the museum had endured chronic instability due to the lack of a suitable venue. In 1910, part of the Palacio de la Industria y de las Artes, an exhibition building located in the then-fashionable northern outskirts of Madrid, was assigned to the museum, and has been its home ever since. A special exhibit was organized in 2010 to celebrate the first centenary of the museum’s move to this now historic site.12 An additional source of support, of a nonpractical nature but of great sym- bolic value, was the title ‘‘Nacional’’ that Bol ́ıvar gained for his museum. A decree issued in 1913 made the new denomination of ‘‘Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales’’ official.13 The initial aim of this new label was to demonstrate the 10.

Jose ́ Manuel Sa ́nchez Ron and Jose ́ Garcı ́a-Velasco (Madrid: Publicaciones de la Residencia de Estudiantes, 2010), 232–55. Bol ́ıvar’s merits as a leader and reformer have been almost unani- mously acknowledged by both his contemporaries and modern historians of Spanish science, although certain naturalists of his time found his leadership close to a monopolistic exercise of influence and control.

At the same time, this apparently subtle adjustment to the museum’s official name underscored a willingly accepted commitment to broaden the scope of the research and curatorial activities that the museum was expected to pursue. And Bol ́ıvar was ready to meet the challenge. If the museum was to be truly ‘‘national,’’ its natural history collections should encompass a broad tax- onomic diversity and the whole of Spanish territory, so as to provide the basis for the completion of a Flora Iberica and a Fauna Iberica, thus accomplishing ‘‘the fulfillment of a project that had for a long time been in the Spanish naturalists’ mind like an almost impossible dream.’’14 Finally, the expectations that the museum had to meet as a public and educational center were raised correspondingly. A thorough refurbishing of the exhibits was undertaken fol- lowing the move to the new venue, and, as we will discuss later, a new concept of the museum as a showcase of Spanish nature for a broad public began to take shape under Bol ́ıvar’s leadership.15 A broader focus is needed to understand the context in which these devel- opments occurred. An acute turn-of-the-century crisis had shaken Spanish society when the last colonies in Cuba and the Philippines were lost during the Spanish-American War of 1898. The Crisis del 98 stands as a major mile- stone in Spanish contemporary history. Social and political malaise had grown during the previous decades, and the humiliating defeat suffered at the hands of the American navy was a heavy blow to national pride. A profound reaction was ignited and radical reforms were soon proposed to rescue the nation from the accelerated decline that threatened to completely distance Spain from the realm of European civilization. Africa, some authors of the time contended, was the appropriate continent to place the languishing, backward, degenerate Spanish nation. Such was the menacing prospect imagined by Joaquı ́n Costa, the foremost representative of the strong—if loosely defined—reformist move- ment known as Regeneracionismo. ‘‘A difference between Morocco and Spain is still admitted,’’ Costa wrote in indignation, ‘‘but if we do not shake off our 14.

Learning from Eur- ope, sending students and technicians to study at European universities and laboratories, imitating European modes and mores in all aspects of political, social, and cultural life were considered the best ways to achieve the national regeneration sought by the politicians, journalists, and reformers of the Regen- eracionismo. And since science was thought by some to be the quintessential European project, science and science education were identified as key factors for the modernization of Spain. This European discourse was nevertheless framed in very nationalistic terms. Spain should retain, or recover, its identity as a nation, restoring a lost national pride. ‘‘We have been defeated in the laboratories and in the offices, but not at sea or land,’’ was the aphoristic explanation for Spanish inferiority as compared to the technological power of the United States made so painfully evident during the 1898 conflict.17 A new ministry for education, science, and the arts, the Ministerio de Instruccio ́n Pu ́blica y Bellas Artes, was created in 1900, prompted by a growing concern about the need to promote both general education and specialized scientific research. Science had traditionally enjoyed little social esteem among Spaniards, but now a growing interest in science was emerging. Neuroscientist Santiago Ramo ́n y Cajal, awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1906, was hailed as a national hero and heralded, so it was imagined at the time, the flourishing future of Spanish science. When the Junta para Ampliacio ́n de Estudios was founded in 1907, Cajal was the obvious choice as its first 16.

Twenty additional members were appointed to the Junta’s first executive board, Bol ́ıvar included.18 In this new and favorable context, Bol ́ıvar’s leadership faced a threefold challenge. His museum had to follow the route toward excellence in scientific research that all the centers of the Junta were supposed to espouse. Therefore, research in geology and zoology (botanical research was assigned to the Jardı ́n Bota ́nico de Madrid) should also join the europeizacio ́n project in which the very creation of the Junta was embedded. Secondly, the museum had to attain the national status it deserved because of its past history and its new institu- tional design. The new institutional link with the Junta, a nationwide scientific body, meant the end of a frustrating dependence on Madrid’s local university authorities. Thirdly, the museum, despite its deficiencies accumulated through decades of poor performance, continued to be the most salient center devoted to the display of natural history objects in Spain. New exhibits were required to modernize the museum. The Spanish public should have the opportunity to engage with a new version of natural history, closer both to the actual scientific research conducted at the museum and to the peculiar features of Spanish nature, now seen as the ultimate foundation of a nation in need of regeneration.19 Bol ́ıvar wanted new taxidermy mounts similar to those he had seen at Europe’s top natural history museums, to replace the old-fashioned rows of dusty specimens. ‘‘With regard to animals, current modes of display of [natural history] public collections should be praised, for there is a tendency to show them in a way that reminds us of the conditions in which they live in Nature, 18.

With them, the museum had at its disposal ‘‘the extraordinary skills of two artists,’’ and it was possible to address ‘‘the renewal of old, disconnected specimens, which should be incorporated into natural groups, following a practice now quite common in all or almost all [natural history] Museums.’’21 In all probability, Bol ́ıvar’s plans for renewal and his reference to ‘‘all or almost all Museums’’ had been inspired by his personal acquaintance with several European natural history museums, obtained during the long tour that he made in 1903 (and again in 1905) to visit natural history collections in Great Britain, France, the Nether- lands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany. As we will see later, it seems that Bol ́ıvar was particularly impressed by the taxidermy mounts he saw at the Leiden museum.22 THE TRAINING OF A TAXIDERMIST The most characteristic feature of the Junta para Ampliacio ́n de Estudios was its near-obsessive goal to improve the training of Spanish scientists, engineers, scholars, and artists by sending them to other European countries. For more than thirty years, the Junta promoted a scholarship program with this precise purpose. Hundreds of scholarships, or pensiones, as they were called (which is why the Junta was sometimes informally referred to as the ‘‘Junta de pen- siones’’), allowed several generations of young Spanish biologists, physicists, engineers, historians, painters, and musicians to spend several months at famed German, French, or British universities, schools, and laboratories.23 In the fields of zoology, botany, and geology, many of these young pensionados were formally or informally affiliated with the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Natur- ales. Such was the case of botanist Jose ́ Cuatrecasas, geologist Jose ́ Royo, and 20. Bol ́ıvar, Discurso (ref. 10), 14. 21. Ibid., 51.

In doing so, he consciously enhanced both the scientific and artistic status of taxidermy as a highly specialized skill. As will become evident in the following sections, the collaborative relationships between Bol ́ıvar and the Benedito brothers involved a considerable degree of autonomy for the taxidermists, whose authorship was often explicitly acknowl- edged within the museum’s institutional sphere. Bol ́ıvar exhorted Luis Bene- dito, then a young and promising taxidermist, to apply for one of the Junta’s scholarships to travel abroad and study with some of the best taxidermists in Europe. As we will see below, Bol ́ıvar’s scheme succeeded, but first let us examine how Luis Benedito became his prote ́ge ́. Bol ́ıvar had initially hired Luis’s elder brother, Jose ́ Mar ́ıa Benedito, also a gifted taxidermist. Jose ́ Marı ́a Benedito Vives was born in Valencia in 1873. Fine and decorative arts were an important component of the Benedito family environment.25 One of his younger brothers, Manuel, became a well-known painter and another, Rafael, was a professional composer and musicologist. Jose ́ Mar ́ıa had instead chosen to follow the profession of his father, Jose ́ Mar ́ıa Benedito Mendoza, who had worked as a taxidermist for the University of Valencia. It was in Valencia that Jose ́ Marı ́a Benedito (son) began his profes- sional career in taxidermy and he remained there until he moved to Madrid in 1907 upon his appointment as ‘‘chief taxidermist’’ at the museum.26 Jose ́ Mar ́ıa was also no doubt influential in Bol ́ıvar’s decision to recruit his younger brother Luis Benedito Vives. Luis had been born in 1884 in Valencia and also had followed in his father’s footsteps. Bol ́ıvar regarded young Luis as a prom- ising candidate to accomplish the complete renewal of the museum’s taxider- mic competencies. To this end, he wanted Luis to be trained at one of the leading European natural history museums where he had seen the new, mod- ern, dynamic, appealing displays he desired for his own center. 24.

Bol ́ıvar was interested in the Leiden museum not only because it was one of the leading natural history museums in Europe, but also because he was aware of one of its collaborators, the talented Dutch taxidermist Hermanus H. ter Meer.28 Although ter Meer’s work was held in high esteem in Leiden, in 1907 he had decided to move to the University of Leipzig, where he had been offered a better-paid position.29 Even after learning that ter Meer had moved to Leipzig, Bol ́ıvar agreed with the Leiden museum that Luis Benedito would spend several months training at Leiden.30 Conse- quently, Luis applied for and obtained his scholarship from the Junta. The initial plan was to travel to Leiden in the summer of 1911. However, disagree- ments between Madrid and Leiden led Luis to shorten his stay in the Nether- lands and resume his training later that year in Leipzig, where he met directly with Hermanus H. ter Meer and learned firsthand the dermoplastiker tech- nique ter Meer had successfully developed in previous years.31 It was the combination of dermoplastic method and habitat group format— along with its potential to endow taxidermic mounts with a lively and natu- ralistic appeal and its capacity to convey ecological information—that Bol ́ıvar had admired in ter Meer’s works at the Leiden museum and wanted Luis Benedito to import to Madrid. The dermoplastic method involved the build- ing of a manikin or sculpture of wire, wood, and plaster. The outer layer of plaster or clay was modeled to represent in minute detail the muscles, hollows, and wrinkles of the living animal. The manikin thus served as the structure on which the skin was carefully mounted, fixing it inch by inch with hundreds of pins, later withdrawn, to ensure a perfect final appearance.32 Various forms of the dermoplastic method had been advocated by taxidermists at least since the 27.

According to his own self-promoting words, he had succeeded in preparing ‘‘a kneadable paste with which [he could] model the animals to reproduce the finest details of their muscles.’’36 Luis Benedito stayed with ter Meer for most of the second half of 1911 and asked for permission to extend his stay in Leipzig by six weeks so he could finish the piece ter Meer had assigned: a large male roan antelope that was to be sent to Madrid, where it would serve as the final result and evidence of the successful completion of his apprenticeship.37 By February 1912 Luis Benedito was back in Madrid, and Bol ́ıvar was very pleased with the ‘‘extremely favor- able reports’’ his prote ́ge ́ had received during his European experience, reports that Bol ́ıvar astutely invoked when asking the Junta for new funding so that Luis could begin working at the museum as soon as possible.38 Luis was in effect hired that same year as associate taxidermist.39 But his new status at the museum was soon to be upgraded.

He passed the examination and his professional affiliation with the museum was thus secured.40 From then on, the professional duo of the Beneditos became firmly established at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (Fig. 1), and, under Bolivar’s leadership, the brothers would prove to be key players in the museum’s process of modernization. IMAGINING A NATIONAL FAUNA While Jose ́ Mar ́ıa had specialized in birds, Luis’s new skills opened up new possibilities for the duo to aim for bigger and more spectacular groups, par- ticularly those formed by large mammals, such as ungulates and carnivores. The way was now clear for importing into Madrid those ‘‘natural groups, today 40.

As many scholars of museum history and the history of taxidermy have shown, the habitat group played a major role in the natural history museums of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and, in many cases, it continued to be an almost inevitable component of zoological exhibits well into the second half of the twentieth century.42 Even though the most spectacular forms of the habitat group, such as the full-fledged habitat diorama, were not attempted in Madrid, a few simpler dioramas—with limited use of the illusionistic effect of painted backgrounds— and dozens of ‘‘semi-habitat groups’’ (that is, groups open to view from all sides, without landscape backgrounds) were created by the Benedito brothers during the 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s, until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.43 As its very denomination implies, the most salient feature of the habitat group is the attempt to display an integrated natural scene, ‘‘placing the animals in meticulously reproduced naturalistic settings that include the fea- tures characteristic of their surroundings, such as particular plants or rocks, or a leaf-covered forest floor.’’44 Because the relationship between a given animal species and its natural environment is thus made explicit, the habitat group was particularly suited to the new focus on Spanish fauna that Bol ́ıvar envisioned as the central feature of the museum’s renewed galleries.

In particular, visitors were invited to acquaint themselves with a selection of those vertebrates most typical of the Iberian Peninsula. A new series of exhibits was therefore designed to contain, in built-to-order glass cases, some of the zoological treasures of the nation (Fig. 2). The allure of the exotic was thus to be complemented by the attractive familiarity of that which was peculiar to a Spaniard’s own country and identity.45 45.

In New York, the American Museum of Natural History had created a whole series of carefully crafted North American dioramas, with the Hall of North American Birds leading the way in 1902. But these were eventually dwarfed by the spectacular African Hall, opened in 1936, where visitors were finally able to fully engage in the museum’s ambitious project to bring—as had been stated by its president—‘‘a vision of the world to those who otherwise can never see it.’’46 In a similar vein, in Germany— where many local museums had previously cultivated an ‘‘emphasis on local fauna’’—high-profile museums such as the Oceanography Museum, which opened in Berlin in 1906, displayed more elaborate dioramas that ‘‘connected the visitor to a distant larger world she or he was unlikely to experience directly.’’47 An inward-looking, self-exploratory, nationalistic discourse was, instead, characteristic of the Madrid museum during the 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s, as we will now discuss. The nationalistic approach adopted by the museum was by no means an isolated move. Rather it followed a general trend in Spanish science and culture. If the Spanish nation was to overcome its own decadence, as the writers of the Regeneracionismo had repeatedly demanded, an inward, critical self-examination of Spanish nature, history, and society was in order. The quintessential representative of the regeneration movement, Joaquı ́n Costa, had led the way with his philological and ethnographic studies, trying to capture by means of rigorous historical research the wisdom latent in ‘‘the experience treasured by a whole people,’’ so as to pour it into the ‘‘empty veins of modern political science.’’48 Free from such rhetoric excesses, the scientists - Press, 1993); Rebecca Bedell, The Anatomy of Nature: Geology and American Landscape Painting, 1825–1875 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002); Thomas M.

This commitment to science and the regeneration ethos was spread across a remarkably wide ideological spectrum, from moder- ate conservatives to radical republicans. Historian of science Thomas F. Glick advanced the idea that a ‘‘civil discourse’’ had emerged in early twentieth- century Spain to provide social support to scientific development notwith- standing ideological differences.49 To quote historian of science Antonio Lafuente, Spain itself was for the Junta ‘‘an experimental object.’’50 It was thus fitting that the first scientific publication ever issued by the Junta was a complete survey of the minerals of the Iberian Peninsula, the first of its genre to be published and authored by geologist Salvador Caldero ́n, a close friend and collaborator of Bol ́ıvar.51 Bolı ́var himself was ready to seize the opportunity to launch his long- cherished project of ‘‘publishing a Spanish Flora and a Spanish Fauna in which the enumeration and the description of the animal and plant species that inhabit our land would be included.’’ Translating this research focus on Span- ish flora and fauna into the public side of the museum required a new style of exhibits, and this is where biological groups of Spanish birds and mammals fitted in particularly well. ‘‘Those groups, although still not very numerous, arouse the curiosity of visitors to the zoological collection,’’ so that, Bol ́ıvar hoped, ‘‘the old collections will soon be withdrawn from public view.’’52 For the development of this project, the collaboration of disinterested gen- tlemanly hunters was sought. They were asked to secure for the museum’s galleries ‘‘representatives of the diverse wild animals that inhabit the woods of the [Iberian] Peninsula.’’53 The precise relationship of each animal to its particular locality was deemed extremely important, so hunters and collectors 49. Bol ́ıvar himself was a liberal republican (he was forced into exile after the Spanish Civil War), while the social milieu of the Beneditos points toward a slightly conservative, largely apolitical ideological outlook.

For example, when Jose ́ Mar ́ıa Benedito undertook the preparation of a group of common swallows with their wall-attached nest, ‘‘the section of wall where [the nest] was collected was so faithfully copied that even a nail and a piece of old rope were taken from it to be added to the reproduction.’’54 Even if the preoccupation with the truthful representation of the animal’s original milieu is typical of the ecological approach that charac- teristically shaped turn-of-the-century habitat dioramas and biological groups, it seems to have been emphasized at the Madrid museum, particularly with regard to the Spanish fauna groups.55 An almost obsessive concern for accuracy in the truthful reconstruction of the physical appearance of particular locations is found repeatedly in the Benedito brothers’ work whenever they dealt with Spanish species (Fig. 3).56 As part of the preparatory work for the fallow deer group, special permission was granted to Jose ́ Mar ́ıa and two assistants to travel to El Pardo forest, close to the city of Madrid, where they should ‘‘collect plants, sand, stones, etc., so that these materials may be used in the reproduc- tion of a natural terrain for the presentation of the aforementioned fallow deer.’’ And when the Beneditos secured two magnificent specimens—a male and a female from the province of Ciudad Real—for a projected wolf group, the local hunter was asked to send to Madrid fragments of rock and other material local to the area, as well as a sketch of the terrain where the wolves had been shot, all of which were deemed necessary for the proper design of the group that was finally executed by Luis.57 - Empire of Nature: Hunting, Conservation and Bristish Imperialism (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988), esp. chap. 2. 54.

EXACTLY FROM LIFE As noted by Robert E. Kohler with regard to Akeley’s and Chapman’s Amer- ican dioramas, the Benedito brothers’ groups ‘‘were not generic scenes illus- trating abstract scientific principles, but recreations of actual places, and it was this particularity of place that guaranteed their scientific—and artistic— authenticity.’’58 Being ‘‘true to nature’’ was vital if the museum was to attract 58. Kohler, All Creatures (ref. 6), 81. </page> <page sequence="21"> V IGNET TES OF SPAN I SH NATURE | 217 a large audience—following the lead of other natural history museums in Europe and North America—while maintaining over its exhibits a ‘‘form of scientific authorisation,’’ Lynn K. Nyhart’s apt phrasing in regard to coetane- ous biological groups in several German museums and the problems they posed for notions of scientific validity.59 Bol ́ıvar was also aware, as were some of his German counterparts, that ‘‘from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step,’’ although he clearly opted for the biological groups provided that they embodied ‘‘a faithful copy of the animal’s attitudes, resulting from a long and patient observation of living and completely free specimens, which is only possible in the field.’’ These requirements were met at the Madrid museum, Bol ́ıvar argued, thanks to the ‘‘extraordinary skills displayed by two artists whose collaboration as taxidermists has been secured by the Museum,’’ and thanks also to considerable sums—at least for the museum’s budget—which were ‘‘necessary for undertaking frequent trips, so that animals can be observed in the wild, paying attention to their more common attitudes, carefully copy- ing their lairs, collecting their nests when it comes to birds.’’ Accordingly, photographs of the groups created by the Beneditos were in subsequent years a sure choice for any publication concerning the museum as a public venue, and these pictures were sometimes accompanied by additional images of the previous work of the museum’s staff in the field, taking notes and measure- ments, and studying the animals in their natural environment.60 The artful capabilities of professional taxidermy needed to be governed by the scientific ethos of accuracy if the museum was to retain its scientific authority and avoid drifting toward triviality. While in the United States some scientists ‘‘believed administrators’ commitment to habitat dioramas symbol- ized the erosion of the larger scientific mission of natural history museums,’’ Bol ́ıvar and the Beneditos spoke proudly, both publicly and privately, of the naturalistic truthfulness of the Spanish groups.61 A cardboard label glued to the back of the bee-eater group, one of the most celebrated works by the Beneditos, stated that it had been ‘‘taken exactly from life [tomado exactamente 59.

It had more of a curatorial character, a piece of information saved for future reference, a value-adding device that likened this taxidermy mount to a collection specimen apt for scientific study.62 The bee-eater group was certainly among the finest ever produced by the Beneditos (Fig. 4).63 Although not restricted to the Iberian Peninsula—its breeding range extends from North Africa throughout southern Europe and western Asia—the colorful bee-eater (Merops apiaster) has some- thing of an African appearance, very much in accordance with the emphasis on 62.

Because the bee-eaters breed in colonies, the group format offered an excellent opportunity to display taxidermic virtuosity and the capacity of habitat groups to convey biological and ecological information. Three dozen birds are included in the group, capturing the busy atmosphere of a breeding colony, with instances of most phases of the reproductive cycle, including nests with eggs, recently hatched nestlings, and young birds being fed by their parents. The reproductive habits of bee-eaters also have another distinctive feature: their nests are not cup-shaped structures but tunnel-like burrows excavated in sandy banks. Hence, the educational powers of the display could be increased by offering visitors the opportunity to peep into the secret life of bee-eaters when they are in their burrows. To this end, a four-sided view of the group is provided: the front and left sides offer a natural view, so to speak, of the colony as it would appear to the observer in the field, while the right and back sides afford a cross-section view, as if the bank and the nests had been cut vertically.64 The Benedito brothers regarded themselves not only as taxidermists but also as naturalists, and they participated in many prospecting and collecting trips sponsored by the museum. For instance, one of Jose ́ Mar ́ıa Benedito’s first assignments at the museum was the exploration of the region around Melilla, a Spanish city in the northern coast of Africa.65 Some years later, when he was sent three great bustard skins from a local hunter, Jose ́ Marı ́a traveled to the spot where the birds had been shot to investigate the local habitat, which he later reproduced in painstaking detail in his 1918 great bustard group.66 In Spain the great bustard (Otis tarda) inhabit steppe-like dry-farming lands. The open landscape of the vast wheat fields of Castile is encapsulated in this otherwise limited and concentrated behind-the-glass scene.67 Wheat sheaves were requested from the local farmer to create the background of the group. 64.

While much attention has been paid—following Latourian concerns with ‘‘immutable mobiles’’—to the various techniques deployed by scientists to ensure the durability and stability of scientific inscriptions as they circulate across spatial and social networks, it is not always noticed that similar issues of stabilization arise when scientists attempt to physically mobilize whole chunks of nature, extracting them from their original environment so as to place them in a research collection or a museum exhibit.69 Habitat groups may have been one possible way to achieve this somewhat chimerical aspiration. To this end, museum scientists and taxidermists have tried to invest them with the author- ity that comes out of an allegedly perfect correspondence to nature or, to put it in their words, of having been ‘‘taken exactly from life.’’ Therefore, the scien- tific authority attached to these ‘‘slices of nature’’ does not depend solely on the material continuity represented by the somatic remnants of the animals, that is, the feathers, claws, horns, and skins that are a sine qua non component of any taxidermic mount (and that endows them with the quality of being ‘‘remnant models,’’ as emphasized by Nyhart).70 It also depends, more impor- tantly, on the supposedly exact correspondence between the scene depicted and a particular and precise moment in the life of those creatures. Groups created by the Benedito brothers could then be enthusiastically publicized as ‘‘tableaux extracted from nature.’’71 This aspiration to capture behind-the-glass realistic vignettes of nature is especially accentuated in the comparatively modest habitat group format. While the more sophisticated habitat dioramas may enhance their illusionistic effect by making use of painted backgrounds and other perspectival devices, their theatrical character is at the same time 68.

They are usually set in a niche in a wall, so that only their front side is presented to the visitor, who stands before them as before a picture or a stage.72 Smaller and simpler free-standing habitat groups, precisely because they are limited to a rectangular scrap of ground, a clump of rocks, or a bunch of branches (which usually can be seen from all four sides), seem to offer a more immediate, unproblematic, and straightforward transfer of the scene from nature to museum. However, achieving such simplicity often requires considerable doses of complexity. Of course, on the one hand, taxidermic skills have been consistently applied to render natural history specimens more appealing to the public. In this respect, museum taxidermy can be viewed as a cultural practice engaged in the manufacture of highly artificial objects.73 On the other hand, however, the aim of taxidermic artifice is to keep the displayed museum specimen as close to nature as possible—even if this closeness to nature is gained by adding addi- tional complexity and artificiality to the mount—and, as already noted, it is by this alleged truthfulness to nature that claims of naturalistic accuracy and scientific authority are attached to taxidermy displays. This paradoxical mix- ture of truthfulness and manipulation is far from unproblematic. Rather, it implies a dialectical tension between reconstructive techniques and scientific objectivity, between interpretive imagination and epistemic self-restraint; a ten- sion that has also been observed in the case of the spectacular dinosaur exhibits that became another hallmark of the leading natural history museums in the early decades of the twentieth century.74 PATRIOTIC LANDSCAPES Museum visitors presumably found the Beneditos’s groups more attractive precisely because of their scientifically backed faithfulness to nature. However, as we have seen, Bol ́ıvar cautioned that this was not without risks, and he and 72.

Even so, some indirect evidence points toward a favorable reaction among visitors following the renewal of the museum’s exhibits. Visitor numbers, which hardly reached the 50,000-per-year threshold during the initial years of Bol ́ıvar’s tenure (peaking at 51,552 in 1906), had almost doubled by 1925, when more than 90,000 visitors were reported. In 1935, a journalist writing for one of Spain’s leading newspapers concluded that, with so many visitors, it was surely ‘‘the most popular museum in Madrid.’’75 In order to achieve this success, Bol ́ıvar and his collaborators chose a mixed rhetorical strategy of spectacularity and familiarity, so that the museum’s new exhibits might offer the Spanish public a balanced combination of spectacular groups of rare animals confined to remote mountain regions, such as the chamois or the ibex—which will be discussed later—and familiar examples of common animals in unpretentious rural settings. The latter should be shown in easily recognizable scenes, so that they could serve as an index of the plain, straightforward factuality that implicitly permeated the museum’s new scientific and educational discourse. For example, the goldfinch group, barely a small rectangular scrap taken from a field of thistles, upon which the birds busily look for the seeds, presents these most easily recognizable (and among the most popular) countryside birds in a characteristic setting. That the relationship between thistles and goldfinches is a well-known fact is revealed in the bird’s scientific name (Carduelis carduelis). The genus name and the spe- cific epithet come from the Latin word for goldfinch, carduelis, which in turn is derived from carduus, meaning thistle.76 With so few elements to construct his 75.

Of course, these coarse-grained data say little about the actual perceptions of different publics and do not answer the question as to what extent visitors engaged in the idea of a distinctly Spanish national fauna. In this regard, a promising avenue of research may lie in the investigation of the reports written by primary and secondary school students after visiting the museum, to which end school notebooks preserved to this day should be traced.

The heads of the thistles gently bow under the delicate weight of the birds, adding that casual realistic touch sought by the Benedito brothers in many of their works. Another example of this type of reassuring familiarity is found in the azure-winged magpie group.77 While fairly common to the central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula, the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyanus) is absent from the rest of Europe—its unusual disjunctive distribution range includes two main areas, one in Spain and Portugal and the other in eastern Asia.78 This little blue corvid thus provided a convenient example of the peculiarity of Spanish fauna within the European context, while being, at the same time, a common bird with which many Spaniards were sure to be acquainted. Jose ́ Marı ́a Benedito was especially interested in securing good specimens of this species, which he repeatedly requested from his correspondents.79 Eventually, he obtained several indivi- duals in good condition with which he assembled the azure-winged magpie group. The birds were placed by Jose ́ Mar ́ıa on the branches of a stone pine, one of the most common and characteristic trees of the Spanish Mediterranean forest, all taken—birds and branches alike—from El Pardo forest. Of course, neither the goldfinches nor the azure-winged magpies were ‘‘taken exactly from life.’’ Nor was there anything simple or straightforward about the highly complex process required to assemble even the most elemen- tary of these groups. Rather, just as the aforementioned spectacular reconstruc- tions of dinosaur skeletons, the Beneditos’s groups can be described as ‘‘a kind of collage or assemblage,’’ put together ‘‘from a large number of disparate materials.’’80 However, their complex, artifactual character is not circumscribed to their material composition.

The etymological explanation seems to have been added in the English translation, being a somewhat unnecessary remark in French, for the French word for goldfinch, chardonneret, is obviously derived from chardon, thistle. 77. The azure-winged magpie group is currently preserved in the museum’s storage facilities. 78. Some ornithologists regard the Iberian and Asian populations as belonging to two closely related but distinct species. See Koon Wah Fok, Christopher M. Wade, and David T.

While sporting a self-avowed fidelity to ‘‘actual places’’—to rely on Kohler again—or partic- ular scenes as they are found in nature (the nail and the piece of old rope in the swallows’ wall, the local wheat sheaves and dry thistles collected for the bustard group), these groups also embody an inclination toward synthetic schemati- zation. They purport to capture and concentrate, within the limited physical space of a glass case, a synthesis of the key biological and ecological traits of a given animal species. In a top-down spatial and hierarchical order, male, female, and young are reunited by taxidermist to represent the core of the biotic portfolio of the species ‘‘as a dynamic, living whole.’’81 Although some groups are composed in a way that makes this sort of family format plausible (for example, the fox group, in which a family of foxes is charmingly depicted relaxing before their den in a moment of intimacy), in many cases the crowded mise-en-sce`ne and the male-female-young sequence result in an unlikely and disturbingly anthropomorphic family portrait.82 In addition, as many features of the corresponding habitat as possible are packed into the limited space of the glass case. Aspects of the species’ life history are also portrayed so as to convey complementary information of educational value, be it a nest with eggs, a bur- row excavated in a bank, or some recently captured prey. This desire to synthesize and schematize that, more often than not, shapes museum dioramas and habitat groups is precisely what explains the choice of the word ‘‘diorama’’ that Myers, commenting on E. O. Wilson’s Sociobiology, and Lynch and Law, analyzing bird field guides, have applied to the charac- terization of a particular type of pictorial illustration found in zoological books. These are pictures that ‘‘arrange their components in a way a photographer cannot, to make them typical.’’83 While they ‘‘suggest a natural situation,’’ these illustrations are at the same time ‘‘discretely framed synthetic schemes.’’84 The chamois group and the ibex diorama can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of 81. Haraway, ‘‘Teddy Bear Patriachy’’ (ref. 8), 24. Haraway’s oft-cited essay refers to the Akeley’s dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History, but this and many other points in her analysis can be fruitfully entertained when considering other nineteenth- and twentieth- century taxidermy displays. 82.

Both were displays devoted to large ungulates living in remote mountain ranges, far removed from the common Spanish citizen. Their symbolic power, which is discussed below, was parallel to their physical remoteness and their consequent distance from ordinary experience. Chamois and ibexes were chosen by Bol ́ıvar and his collaborators for those displays intended to add spectacle to the museum’s halls. In contrast to the cozy familiarity of the goldfinch or the azure-winged magpie groups, chamois and ibexes (and the mountains inhabited by them) had an almost legendary reputation, an aristocratic prestige attached to lofty and inaccessible places. Therefore, the composition of the groups could be set more freely, as an imaginary or ideal synthesis of a high mountain scene. Components taken from nature were certainly there—the rocks (or imitations thereof), the crusty lichens, the humble grasses of the mountain pastures, and, of course, the animals; male, female, and young—but the way in which those elements were arranged was not a truly naturalistic portrait of an existing natural scene. Instead, it was intended to visually convey an ecological re ́sume ́ of the natural history of the species. What is more, both the chamois group and the ibex diorama functioned as twofold nested metonymies. First, each group of ani- mals (three chamois, five ibexes) was, of course, a metonymy of the whole species. Second, each scene was a metonymy of the full mountain range where that particular species lived. In fact, it would be more precise to talk about subspecies, for, as we will see next, the close link between the animal and its specific geographical distribution was reinforced in these cases by emphasizing the subspecific level. The chamois group was created by Luis Benedito in 1913 (Fig. 5). It was an ambitious undertaking and the first large-sized mammal group to be attempted at the museum. To accomplish it, Luis drew upon his proficiency in the advanced taxidermic skills he had just acquired under the guidance of Herma- nus H. ter Meer. He succeeded, and years later, ter Meer himself explicitly expressed his approval. The ‘‘whole composition has a remarkable liveliness,’’ he wrote to his former pupil, emphasizing the pleasant ‘‘tender lines of the young.’’85 The group included three specimens of the Cantabrian subspecies of the Pyrenean chamois: an adult male on top of a large rock, an adult female halfway up, and a kid at the bottom. This was a creature especially suited to embody national symbolism. Iberian chamois populations belong to a species restricted to southern Europe (Spain and Italy), namely the Pyrenean chamois 85.Hermanus H. ter Meer to Luis Benedito, 31 Jan 1924, ACN 0295/008 (original in French). </page> <page sequence="30"> 226 | C A SADO AND ARAG O ́N FIG. 5.

Within the southern or Pyrenean species, a subspecies had been described by A ́ngel Cabrera in 1910, who claimed that the chamois of the Cantabrian Mountains ‘‘is a very different form from the Pyrenean one,’’ being ‘‘smaller in size and redder in colour.’’86 Cabrera, a renowned 86.

The specimens mounted in the chamois group had an additional patriotic value in that they had been presented to the museum by the king Alfonso XIII.88 An accomplished sportsman and hunter, Alfonso XIII had shot the unfortunate creatures during a hunting party in Picos de Europa, the highest massif in the Cantabrian Mountains. Not only were these lofty peaks an outstanding example of majestic high mountain scenery, Picos de Europa was also a place of intense historical resonance, apt for inspiring the grandest of patriotic sentiments. Twelve centuries ago these mountains had witnessed the legendary battle of Covadonga, frequently portrayed as the birthplace of the Spanish nation.89 Picos de Europa and Covadonga were thus an obvious choice to establish Spain’s first national park. On September 8, 1918, less than five years after Luis Benedito had completed his chamois group, the Parque Nacional de la Montan ̃a de Covadonga was formally inaugurated by Alfonso XIII.90 Under the institutional umbrella of the new park, nature and history were thus explicitly reunited around this mythical landscape. While the markedly vertical design of the chamois group, together with the fake calcareous boulders that reproduced the original high mountain habitat, attempted to embody the essence of the Picos de Europa landscape in a con- centrated, almost laconic vignette, the ibex diorama was a more ambitious - is provided by Cabrera in Fauna Ibe ́rica: Mamı ́feros (Madrid: Junta para Ampliacio ́n de Estudios e Investigaciones Cient ́ıficas, 1914), 306–09. 87.

Again, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) was a distinctively Spanish species, different from the heavier Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), native to the Alps and introduced to other European mountains. Again, mammalogist A ́ngel Cabrera had divided this species into several subspecies, of which one, the Gredos ibex (Capra pyrenaica victoriae), was restricted to a single mountain massif located at the very center of the Iberian Peninsula.91 Again, this quin- tessential Spanish goat had been seen as a valuable trophy for aristocratic hunters and for Alfonso XIII himself.92 And again, in 1915 and 1916, the king had presented several specimens to the museum, thereby establishing an explicit link between his royal patronage and the crafting of a public image of a Spanish national fauna.93 By attaching his name to some of the new displays, the king was publicly supporting the scientific and educational pro- gram that was being developed by the museum. Located in the ancient kingdom of Castile, in the Iberian Central Range, the Gredos Mountains could be seen as lying, both spatially and metaphori- cally, at the heart of the Spanish nation.94 The Beneditos decided to stage the ibex group as a full-fledged diorama, the first to be attempted at the museum. A background landscape and special lighting effects were designed to re-create a sublime mountain sunrise in the uppermost part of Gredos, near the peak of Almanzor. On this occasion two adult males were included in the final design. Facing each other, both bucks are ready to clash heads and horns. In an implicitly subordinate position on a lower plane, two females and one kid complete the required biological spectrum of the species.95 The privileged role assigned to ibexes as the ultimate representatives of Spanish fauna was confirmed years later when Alfonso XIII commissioned two additional ibex groups from the Benedito brothers. One was presented as a royal gift to the British Museum (Natural History) in London. The second one was also meant to be a gift from the king, this time to the Naturhistoriska 91.

In 1927, Luis Benedito was sent to London, where he remained for several weeks until the group was ready. On July 7, the Spanish ibex group was unveiled at a ceremony attended by Alfonso XIII and George V.96 Royal patronage and cultural diplomacy again coincided in the Stockholm-bound ibex group. In this case, Alfonso XIII was reciprocating an earlier gesture of friendship from the Swedish monarch Gustaf V, who in 1929 had sent a moose mount to the Madrid museum.97 Later that year, it was agreed that Luis Benedito should travel to Stockholm to assemble his third ibex group on the spot.98 It seems that Luis’s work thus gained some credit in Sweden, for a few years later another Swedish museum, the Natural History Museum of Malmo ̈, requested permission to have one of its assistants, Gunlo ̈g Bu ̈low-Hu ̈be, spend a training period in Madrid with Luis. Bol ́ıvar was happy to accept, and twenty-four-year-old Ms. Bu ̈low-Hu ̈be traveled to Madrid in March 1934.99 The development of Bol ́ıvar’s project came to a sudden end with the onset of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Before the war ended in 1939, Bol ́ıvar had gone into exile, and he died in Mexico in 1944.100 After the war, the Ben- edito brothers returned to the museum, which entered a long period of institutional weakness and declining scientific output.101 Public exhibits inherited from Bol ́ıvar’s period were kept with little change for decades. In the absence of new museological proposals, the Beneditos continued their previous line of work for a number of years. Jose ́ Marı ́a died in 1951, and Luis in 1955. 96.

In the case of Spain, biological groups and habitat dioramas were incorporated into a wider reformist endeavor with a nationalistic outlook. In this context, the new taxidermic techniques proved to be useful in two quite different but complementary ways. Firstly, taxidermic vignettes of Iberian fauna were part of a broader effort to construct a new image of the Spanish nation and to reinforce a shared national identity. Secondly, achieving the modernization of the public exhibits at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales contributed—in a particularly visible way—to the more general modernization process of the scientific and technical capacities of Spanish society, which was the explicit aim of the Junta para Ampliacio ́n de Estudios. Specific practices of display were thus endowed with new meanings and pur- poses in a peripheral national context. Therefore, and although it has been argued with regard to habitat dior- amas that ‘‘their popularity was concentrated mainly in Scandinavia and North America,’’ noting that ‘‘countries in these regions still possessed vast tracts of wilderness and identified nationally with this heritage,’’ this essay has shown that alternative stories can be told about the ways in which modern, sophisticated forms of museum taxidermy became entangled with national identities and reformist movements in the old, even decadent na- tions of turn-of-the-century southern Europe.102 Taxidermia moderna (mod- ern taxidermy) was imported to Spain in a very deliberate way during the first three decades of the twentieth century.103 Support from the Junta para Ampliacio ́n de Estudios, Bol ́ıvar’s leadership, and the technical and artistic skills of the Benedito brothers all made this museological acclimatization possible. Modern, dynamic, and aesthetically appealing habitat groups began to fill the halls of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, displacing, in Bol ́ıvar’s words, ‘‘old, disconnected specimens.’’104 Exporting Spanish ibex groups from Madrid to natural history museums in London and Stockholm marked the completion of a full cycle of assimilation, appropriation, and 102.

Their appearance in Madrid, from around 1910, could be interpreted as simply an expected outcome of a cultural diffusion process, flowing from the center to the periphery. But if ‘‘the significance of any piece of taxidermy is framed,’’ according to Rachel Poliquin, ‘‘by particular social, aesthetic, scientific, and ideological concerns,’’ then, as we have argued in this essay, taxidermy by the Beneditos must also be placed in the particular context of social and cultural reform that pervaded Spanish society at the turn of the century and in the decades that followed.106 In this context, the Junta para Ampliacio ́n de Estudios stands out as the foremost promoter of scientific and educational reform, aimed at the europeizacio ́n of Spain, while at the same time being part of a larger, collective effort to restore and invigorate Spanish national identity. New taxidermic techniques were incorporated into the Junta’s schemes to train young Spanish scientists, scholars, technicians, and artists in various European countries. Excellence in bird taxidermy, achieved by Jose ́ Mar ́ıa Benedito, was thus complemented by mastery of the dermo- plastic method, acquired by his younger brother Luis in Germany and the Netherlands. Habitat groups were greeted at the Madrid museum as a sign of a long-awaited modernization, but they also served as a convenient rhetorical device to convey scientifically backed images of a national nature with yet untapped educational virtues. As we have seen, the effectiveness of this museum-based cultural and edu- cational project was heavily dependent on the technical skills of professional taxidermists. Bol ́ıvar and his collaborators were willing to create convincing vignettes of Spanish nature, but they were also acutely conscious of the risks that modern museum taxidermy might pose for scientific respectability. Mastery in the dermoplastic technique ensured an attractive and realistic look 105. By using the word ‘‘natures,’’ in plural, we of course mean to emphasize both the idi- osyncratic particulars of local environments, as they are represented in habitat groups, and the changing cultural images of nature, especially as they are translated into museum displays. For a sociological reflection on the socially contingent character of ‘‘cultural readings of natures’’ see Phil Macnaghten and John Urry, Contested Natures (London: Sage, 1998), 19–23. 106.

However, groups and dioramas required additional museological skills. Both artistic sensibility and technical dexterity had to be combined in a delicately balanced blend if a verisimilar reconstruction of a natural scene was to be achieved. Yet verisimilitude alone was not enough. In the museum setting, the attractiveness of the illusionistic effect would be justified only if it served to convey relevant information about the physical environment, the ecological relationships, and the known habits of the animal. Accurate scientific knowledge, Ignacio Bol ́ıvar and A ́ngel Cabrera claimed, was the key to ensuring truthfulness to nature in the Beneditos’s habitat groups, and truthfulness was in turn the ultimate touchstone of excellence in museum taxidermy. Of course, the discussion about the complex entanglement of meanings and purposes that emerges when considering the verisimilitude issue and the pre- tension of being ‘‘true to nature’’ is by no means particular to the Beneditos’s work. Rather it is surely a relevant point with respect to many other instances of museum taxidermy in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. Historical and cultural analysis of these questions has sometimes been framed in terms of ‘‘authenticity’’ (or pretensions thereof).107 We have chosen instead to investigate the metonymic meanings invested in these objects, which were purported to teach the public about relationships between animals and places, embodying the expression of a genius loci both at a local and a national level. The particular emphasis given by the Madrid museum to the national dimen- sion (and the nationalist reading) of the new zoological exhibits made connec- tions between animals and places particularly important. Animal mounts should be shown as particular individuals living in particular places. Efforts were made to emphasize the specifically Spanish character of the specimens displayed (some of which belonged to Iberian subspecies of more broadly distributed species), and to re-create the equally specific features of the local habitat in which these particular specimens had been collected. Each group should capture a definite spot, uniquely placed within Spanish territory. At the same time, however, each of these particular spots should be representative of major natural regions and habitats characteristic of Iberian nature. 107.

When, on July 7, 1927, the sovereigns of Britain and Spain met in the central hall of the Natural History Museum and a large Spanish flag was drawn up, unveiling the glass case that had been concealed under its symbolic protection, a little chunk of the Gredos Mountains emerged before the select audience. A Spanish journalist reporting on the event underscored the ‘‘extremely skillful and artful procedure’’ deployed by the ‘‘great taxidermist sculptor Luis Benedito’’ in the mounting of ‘‘three perfect specimens of this exceedingly rare species, unknown in Britain.’’108 Three ibexes on a heap of granite rocks had been sent to London as the most genuine expression of Spanish nature and as an index of the cultural modernization sought by the Spanish nation.
