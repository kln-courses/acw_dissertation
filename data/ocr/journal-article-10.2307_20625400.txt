Robert French was the chief photographer for the firm of Lawrence, so that his work was for many years veiled in anonymity as a product of that firm. Though based in Dub lin, French travelled the length and breadth of Ireland at various times between 1880 and 1914, when he retired. The Lawrence negatives in the National Library of Ire land, which are the fruits of his life work, have provided a rich source for many com pilers of books, the most notable name being that of Kieran Hickey, who first established Robert French as a person dis tinct from the firm of Lawrence. No Mean City (the quotation is from St Paul, via the novelist George Birmingham) is a collec tion of French's photographs of the Belfast area, arranged more or less topographi cally. It is not always easy to date the nega tives exactly, as they were made over a fairly long period, but the presence or absence of trams and the source of power, whether horse or electric, provides a ter minus post (or ante) quern for many of them, as also do the known dates of con struction of buildings and the names of shopkeepers, which can be verified from directories. Amongst the more interesting photographs are that of Barre's Provincial Bank with the street-named Hercules Place clearly visible upon it and the view of Ballynafeigh Methodist Church with its original spire, sometimes said never to have been excuted. The text is in general relevant and and concise. Proof-reading has not always been as meticulous as it might have been. Most of the errors are obvious slips, but the date of Richardson, Sons &amp; Owden's magnificent linen warehouse in Donegall Square has been placed twenty years too late (1886-9 instead of 1866-9). I am slightly puzzled by the statement that the photograph of Belfast Castle was taken after 1894, "when an outside staircase was constructed at the back of the building," since the viewpoint does not reveal whether the staircase is there or not, at least to the unpractised eye of the reviewer. As well as the main topographically arranged section there are collections relating to the docks and harbour and to linen and shipbuilding. These are the only industries covered by the French photographs, since they were taken to cater for public demand rather than for purely documentary purposes. The return visits to Belfast by Robert French were clearly made for the purpose of updating the views of central Belfast, both in terms of electric rather than horse trams and the City Hall instead of the White Linen Hall. This is a book which can be recommended to any body interested in the history of architec ture and of the city of Belfast. Dr Pettit's book on The Streets of Cork is clearly a labour of love and is packed with information of all kinds about that city. The illustrations are many and various. There are some beautiful colour photographs by the author himself and a host of other illus trations drawn from various sources, in BRANDON an IRISH BOTH ENTERTAINING and testing,/4w Irish Literary Quiz Book gives a fas cinating glimpse of the range, diversity and richness found in Irish literature.

Some of Dr Pettit's pictures are quite unfamilar, to me at any rate, such as the noble and austere Ionic facade of the former Post Office in Pembroke Street, which recalls Stuart and Revett and the Temple on the Ilissus in its neo-Grec de sign. I had never before realised the origin of this building. Unfortunately the author, having whetted our curiosity as in these in stances, does not always do anything to satisfy it. There is not enough correlation between the text and pictures, nor is there an index or list of illustrations, so that the effect is that of a lucky dip, into which the seeker after information may grope for the desired item. This book is, however, with all its faults of arrangement, full of interest. Shannon through her literature is an en tertaining miscellany of literary extracts from such writers as William Bulfin and Michael Hogan, the Bard of Thomond, arranged topographically as part of a jour ney down the Shannon from the Shannon Pot to its merging in the waters of the Atlan tic. There are many illustrations. I was par ticularly fascinated by the early photograph of Bartley Harrington, the Leitrim post man, fully equipped with posthorn, mailbag and umbrella, having a sort of eyeball to eyeball confrontation with a rather beady eyed lady at her front door. It has never been my good fortune to meet a postman so well equipped. No wonder that according to the poem "The people of Leitrim came out to meet him, saying 'Tarry dear Bartley, with your letters awhile."' The pictures of river steamers such as the Countess Cado gan have a nostalgic charm, but my favour vite is the ESB advertisement of 1928 with its drawing of 90,000 horses being driven by a Cuchulainn-like character. Underneath is the interesting statement that "the Ameri can workman is the most prosperous on earth, because he has, on an average, three horse-power, the equivalent of thirty human slaves, helping him to produce." Those were halcyon days of unspoiled innocence indeed. The book on St Mary's Abbey, Bally haunis is of considerable interest, since this is a rare example of a house of Augustinian friars, founded in the fifteenth century and reoccupied by the original order. A ground plan would be a help in un derstanding the text, since the medieval church has been reroofed and enlarged at various times from 1833 to the present day. It would appear that a substantial part of the original fabric remains, though unsym pathetically covered with plaster and adorned with modem pinnacles and rose windows. The old drawings and photo graphs in this booklet provide a valuable re cord of what the church looked like at vari ous stages in its recent history. are all well worth reading but, for me,the highlights were the Proustian opening story and "The Water Garden" which begins with the haunting "As a child I spent a season in hell, along with Rimbaud ..." The second section consists of the aforementioned diary and two rather perfunctory pieces, neither of which transcends the type you'd find in any competent war novel. But it was the final part I most enjoyed, and here Mr Stuart's tongue is firmly planted in his cheek. One story is a manic mixture of Dostoevsky and social aberra tion while another (about an unlikely group of astronauts) scales new heights of surreal lunacy. However, it is "2016" which runs away with the proverbial palm. Ostensibly a futuristic fantasy, this cynical little snippet takes a swingeing swipe at some of our most sacred cows: there's an irreverent nod in the direction of 1916 and all that; the Irish Literary Establishment suffers a merciless lambasting, while a well-known mecca of God and Mammon gets an unholy knocking in a reference to The Pagan Place', so cal led "because it was supposed to be the only building in Ireland on a wall of which an ap parition hadn't appeared." I've never been a great admirer of Francis Stuart's work but I would warmly recommend two-thirds of States of Mind. But, once again, it's a pity about the terrible presentation. As someone who has an ambivalent at titude towards anthropomorphic literature (I liked Watership Down but floundered through William Kotzwinkle's much acclaimed Doctor Rat), I approached Run with the Wind with an open mind and, in the heel of the hunt, found myself completely captivated by the adventures of Black Tip, Vickey and their various vulpine compan ions. Younger readers will be enchanted by many of the incidents in Tom McCaugh ren's well-paced narrative?a raid on the duck-pond in Dublin Zoo, the victory over Lepus the Great and, in particular a mar vellous chapter entitled "Facing the Fun Dogs". Jeanette Dunne's realistic illus trations enhance the book's appeal but no praise at all for whoever decided to place one of them on pages 72-73; it completely spoils the suspense of the scheme to outwit the foxhounds. But that can be rectified in future editions, something of which I hope there'll be many. Highly recommended for anyone over twelve.</page></plain_text>
