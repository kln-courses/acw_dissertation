<plain_text><page sequence="1">446 German Studies THE CLASSICAL ERA By W. E. Yuill, Senior Lecturer in German in the University of Sheffield i. General bibliography and reference The first part of the revd. vol. 15 of Goedeke, Grundrifl zur Geschichte der dt. Dichtung, Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 664 pp., is ed. by H. Jacob. Meyers Handbuch iiber die Literatur, Mannheim, Bibl. Institut, 959 pp., is lavishly provided with portraits and facsimiles. H. Henning and S. Seifert continued their 'Inter nationale Bibl. zur dt. Klassik' with series 9 and 10, WB, x, 415-80, 910-76. H. Henning has also ed. Die Stdtte, die ein guter Mensch betrat. . . , Berlin-Weimar, 112 pp., which is a bibl. of works on Classical Weimar. Pp. 316-23 of the 'Bibl. for 1963', PMLA, lxxix, are devoted to the 18th and early 19th c. J. R. Frey, 'Anglo-German literary bibl. for 1963', JEGP, lxiii, pp. 475-8. JDSG, viii, contains catalogues of three colls of lit. MSS.: C. E. Schweitzer, 'Deutsche Dichterhandschriften in der Historical Society of Pennsylvania', pp. 344-81 (incl. alpha betical index); M. Muller, 'Die neueren Dichterhandschriften der Wurttembergischen Landesbibliothek', ib., pp. 382-401; T. Kromer, part 7 of 'Die Handschriften des Schiller-National museums', ib., pp. 402-22, concludes the list of holdings from the 18th c. texts Some vols of Klassische deutscheDichtung, Freiburg-Basle-Vienna, Herder, were reprinted, and the series was continued with vol. 15, devoted to 'burgerliches TrauerspieP and provided with an epilogue by W. Muller-Seidel (536 pp.)&gt; and vol. 16, ed. and comm. by B. v. Wiese, 599 pp.: this includes Lessing, Nathan; Goethe, Iphigenie; Schiller, Wilhelm Tell, as well as dramas by Kleist, Grillparzer and Kaiser. Kindler- Verlag, Munich, are producing a series of Briefe der Weltliteratur in 24 vols ? Deutsche Klassiker: Erster Teil includes letters ? mainly abridged ? by Gellert, Gleim, Anna Luise Karsch, Klopstock, Lessing, Wieland, Schubart, Claudius and</page><page sequence="2">The Classical Era 447 Herder. The annotations are brief but helpful. There is much useful material which would otherwise be difficult of access, but in some cases the excerpts are so short as to be almost meaningless. H. Heldmann, 'Briefe von Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Christian Felix WeiBe und Friedrich Maximilian Klinger an Moritz August von ThummeV,JahrbuchfiirFrdnkische Landesforschung, vol. xxii, Neustadt (Aisch), 1962, pp. 121-39. HISTORICAL SURVEY Monographs by a single hand covering the whole range of German literature might now be considered of doubtful utility: they can seldom be digested as a whole, and the general orientation they offer might be equally well obtained from standard works like that of de Boor and Newald. Of the two general histories of literature that have appeared this year that of O. Mann, Deutsche Literaturgeschichte. Von der germanischen Dichtung bis zur Gegenwart, Giitersloh, Bertelsmann, 638 pp., is the more objective and the more readable; the serious reader might have been better served by fewer illustra tions and a more extensive bibl., however. W. Kahle, Geschichte der dt. Dichtung, Minister, Regensberg, 536 pp., is a fourth, extensively revd. ed. of a work evidently much used in German schools. It is written frankly from a Roman Catholic point of view; where this bias is open it is acceptable, but sometimes it masquerades as aesthetic judgement ? why should Schnabel's alleged prejudice against Roman Catholics be termed a 'Schonheitsfehler'? The treatment of writers like Wieland and K. A. Musaus is far from satisfactory and is calculated to bolster up existing misconceptions. A. Eggebrecht, Epochen der Weltliteratur, Giitersloh, Bertelsmann, 303 pp., is a super ficial and popular work elaborated from a radio series; it includes no less than 350 brief biographies. J. Gearey and W. Schumann, Einfiihrung in die dt. Lit., London, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, x + 449 pp., apparently includes 'Essays on the major German authors from Lessing to Brecht'. B. A. Sorensen, Symbol und Symbolismus in den dsthetischen Theorien des 18. Jhs und der deutschen Romantik, Copenhagen, Munksgaard, 1963, 332 pp., is a highly detailed survey from Gottsched down to Solger. The author draws meticulous distinctions between</page><page sequence="3">448 German Studies symbol, allegory and metaphor and investigates theories of 'natural5 and 'arbitrary5 signs. Goethe's notion of the symbol is closely analysed into 'Gestaltsymbol', 'emotionales' and 'representatives Symbol', and the influence of Kant on Schiller's view is assessed. The only major poet and theorist who seems to receive less than due attention is Klopstock. movements Aufkldrung M. v. Geismar, Bibliothek der dt. Aufkldrer des i8.Jhs, Darmstadt, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1963, is a photomechan ical reprint in two vols (133 + 52 + J43 + 53 PP-5 368 pp.) of a coll. of tracts first publ. in 1846/7. The topics are mainly theological but the coll. offers illuminating back ground material to such works as Sebaldus Nothanker. Of particular interest is the biography of C. F. Bahrdt, who seems to be undergoing a mild rehabilitation (see Individual Authors) ; this includes an entertaining contemporary satire, Theologischer Beweis, dafi der Doctor Bahrdt schuld an dem Erdbeben in Kalabrien sei (1785). The tribulations of men like Bahrdt and J. H. Schulz make clear that the Enlightenment, too, had its martyrs. M. Dufner and V. C. Hubbs, German Essays I: Aufkldrung, New York, Macmillan; London, Collier-Macmillan, 88 pp., contains Wieland, Was ist Wahrheit?, Lessing, Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts and Kant, Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufkldrung? Each item has a brief introd. and bibl., and there is also a general introd. which is short but well-phrased and sensible. In the case of Lessing the bibl. is barely adequate and does not include, for instance, the standard biography of Garland ? the most recent item in fact dates from 1931; Wieland is better served, but Kant, again, is provided with no lit. later than 1926. H. M. Wolff, Die Weltanschauung der dt. Aufkldrung, Berne-Munich, 1963, 254 pp., is a re-issue revd. and introd. by K. S. Guthke. Sturm und Drang E. Adler, 'U zrodel Burzy i naporu5, KN, xi, 133-50, is mainly concerned with Herder and his attitude to Rousseau. The importance of R.5s criticism of French Classicism for Sturm</page><page sequence="4">The Classical Era 449 und Drang thought is stressed, and the final part of the article deals with H.'s Abhandlung uber den Ursprung der Sprache. W. Stellmacher, 'Grundfragen der Shakespeare-Rezeption in der Friihphase des Sturm und Drang', WB, x, 323-45, suggests that Goethe and his contemporaries were attracted to S. by the latter's representation of a total historical process as the dialectical interaction of part and whole, and by the role which he assigned to the masses in this process. The latter part of the article is concerned generally with English lit. influences in Germany around the middle of the 18th c. In conclusion the author discusses Hamann's 'urkommunistische Gleichheitsuto pie' and its influence on Herder and other young writers: it was ultimately the influence of S. that inspired the demand for the linking of art, ideology and social realities. Sturm und Drang: dramatische Schriften, Frankfurt a.M.-Vienna-Zurich, Biicher gilde Gutenberg, 2 vols (629; 670 pp.) is a selection by E. Loewenthal and L. Schneider. Klassik J. Miiller, eDas humanistische Programm der dt. Klassik', WZFSUJ, xi, 1962, 167-71. W. Waldstein, 'Wien und Weimar. Der Doppelgipfel der europaischen Klassik', JWGV, lxvii, 1963, 74-8. H. Holtzhauer, Arbeiterbewegung und Klassik, Berlin-Weimar, Aufbau-Verlag, 375 pp., is a catalogue with comm. to an exhibition in the Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv at Weimar. THEME AND GENRE STUDIES There is a distinct trend towards this type of study. This is most marked in the case of the novel, on which there have been three major monographs. Two of these are concerned with the development of the modern 'Unterhaltungsroman' from the 'Trivialroman' of the 18th c, and once again there is occasion to deplore the introduction of these weighted terms: large areas of German lit. are bound to remain devoid of objective judgement as long as German critics insist on awarding all the marks for philosophical content and none for skilled narrative technique. M. Greiner, Die Entstehung der modernen Unter haltungsliteratur. Studien zum Trivialroman des 18. Jhs, Reinbek b. Hamburg, Rowohlt, 153 pp., does pay lip-service to the 29</page><page sequence="5">45? German Studies continuity which links the highest and lowest in literature, but generally speaking he seems to be out of sympathy with his subject. The historical survey from the beginnings of the bourgeois novel under foreign influences through the senti mental phase of La Roche and Martin Miller to the Tamilien gemalde' of Lafontaine and the more egregious historical and mystery novels at the turn of the century (Veit Weber, Vulpius and Schiller's Geisterseher) are dealt with competently enough, and due note is taken of models like Richardson and Sterne in the evolution of sentiment and humour in the novel. Not enough attention is paid, however, to the sociological aspect ? as far as G. is concerned, these novels might only be bad copies of good novels. There is only a perfunctory attempt to visualize the social forces which produced this kind of literature: G.'s statement that 'der Leser des Trivialromans liest eben nur, um zu lesen, um die Zeit totzuschlagen' is manifestly absurd when it is borne in mind that for the readers of such works reading was probably a hard-won accomplishment and something of a labour. The author's tone becomes more severely sarcastic as he proceeds: of Kotzebue it is said that his life was itself a kind of 'Trivialroman', and the plots of novels are ridiculed without any attempt to analyse narrative techniques which are sometimes astonishingly deft. Altogether, this is a rather scrappy book, but one must bear in mind the fact that it was edited and adapted (by Therese Poser) after the author's untimely death in a motor-accident. M. Beaujean, Der Trivialroman in der zweiten Hdlfte des 18. Jhs. Die Urspriinge des modernen Unterhaltungsromans, Bonn, Bouvier, 218 pp., adopts a more sympathetic attitude than Greiner and assigns to the 'Trivialroman' greater autonomy and a dynamic of its own. The author carries out a limited investigation into reading habits in the 18th c. and points to the intense critical concern with the novel during the period as evidence of its importance. The evolution of the novel in a contemporary setting from the moralizing tradition is traced and ethical patterns it embodies are analysed; the process of 'trivialization' and the development of different species of novel ('gesell schaftskritisch', 'psychologisch', 'erotisch', 'humoristisch') are then described. There is a good account of the historical novel, which is shown to have roots much deeper and more complex</page><page sequence="6">The Classical Era 451 than Goethe's Gotz, and of the story of adventure and mystery. Some attention is devoted to the stylistic and structural qualities of the novels, but here one might have wished for more detailed example. B. comes to some interesting con clusions: the 'Trivialroman' proper (for which B. at a sur prisingly late stage in the work suggests the more appropriate description 'Unterhaltungsroman') is seen to emerge on a great scale at the end of the 18th c. in consequence of the coalescence of cTendenz' (the didactic lit. of Pietism and the Enlightenment) and 'Spannung' (the sensational and exotic elements inherited from the late baroque novel); its popularity comes from the fact that it is the bearer of the rationalist notion of theodicy and represents a mundane view of life congenial to the mass of the middle-class who were unable to assimilate the idealist transcendentalism of the Classical and Romantic elite. This middle-class domestic rationalism thus constitutes, according to B., an under-current of thought which rises to the surface once more in the age of Biedermeier and Poetic Realism. B.'s study covers a greater range of material than Greiner's and provides both a very full bibl. and a diagrammatic survey of perplexing complexity. In his preface to E. D. Becker, Der dt. Roman um 1780, Stuttgart, Metzler, viii + 231 pp., Prof. Sengle suggests with some justification that 'German literary history has scarcely begun' and advocates broad investigations on objective lines into genres and periods. B. seeks objectivity by considering all the extant novels that were published between 1779 and 1781 (a task not as daunting as it sounds, for of about 100 novels only some 36 can still be found). The date is chosen as representing a lull between the first wave of the 'modern* novel about 1770 and the great expansion of the Romantic period when the division into 'Trivialroman' and 'Kunstroman' first becomes feasible. The narrow chronological limits allow the author to investigate in depth contemporary theories of the novel, in particular the conflict between social function and aesthetic requirements, the social standing of readers and authors, and their geographical distribution. The novels themselves are divided into three main groups: 'Der "hohe" Roman' ? in many ways a successor to the baroque 'Prii fungsroman', but set in a contemporary middle-class milieu and</page><page sequence="7">452 German Studies influenced by Richardson; 'Der niedrig-komische Roman' ? a satirical form, of which Wieland's Abderiten is the most accomplished example; ?Der "mittlere" Roman' ? the most complex group which represents the 'modern' novel of the day and which includes, amongst many other forms, the 'Erziehungs roman' and 'Entwicklungsroman'. It is to this third main group that B. assigns a species of novel that has apparently not been isolated hitherto ? the character novel in dialogue form which appears to have experienced a brief existence in Leipzig. Of the three main examples ? A. G. MeiBner's Alkibiades, F. T. Hase's Friedrich Mahler and Gustav Aldermann ? B. has published a reprint (the first since 1779) of the third in Sammlung Metzler (Deutsche Neudrucke/Reihe 18. Jh.). It is in the nature of things that the 'middle' group, which embodies the anomalous products from Wilhelm Meisters theatralische Sendung to Pestalozzi's Lienhard und Gertrud and Hippel's Lebenslaufe, should be the least satisfactory category. On the basis of these groups B. proceeds to detailed analyses of characters and their typical views, setting and its relation to contemporary society, and, finally, to an investigation of structure and the main narrative techniques. The conclusion that the novels of 1780 represent a transition from the older baroque tradition to the popular novels of the Romantic period might seem a truism but it is backed up here by a mass of well-observed evidence. This is a good beginning to a new synoptic approach, and it will be interesting to observe whether other studies on the same lines prove as stimulating. L. E. Kurth, 'Historiographie und historischer Roman: Kritik und Theorie im 18. Jh.', MLJV, lxxix, 337-62, describes in a highly compact article the rise of historical fiction in association with the flourishing of historical studies about the middle of the 18th c. and gives some account of the theoretical scruples of Gottsched, Bodmer and Breitinger. The evolution of techniques is followed from Gottlob v. Justi's Geschichte des Psammitichus (1759), through the sentimental works of Paul v. Stetten and R. E. Raspe, to the full-blown historical novels of Benedikte Naubert and Leonard Wachter (Veit Weber). F. K. Stanzel, Typische Formen des Romans, Gottingen, Vanden hoeck and Ruprecht, 77 pp., has little relevance to the 18th c. E. Trunz, 'Die Formen der dt. Lyrik in der Goethezeit',</page><page sequence="8">The Classical Era 453 DU, xvi, 17-32, points to the wide range of lyrical forms and concludes that a sophisticated feeling for metrical pattern is characteristic of the age. Specific forms seem particularly congenial to certain types of poetic personality. There are brief but penetrating interpretations of examples. K. L. Schneider, 'Die Polemik gegen den Reim im 18. Jh.', ib., 5-16, reviews the arguments advanced against rhyme on both rational and emotional grounds in the period between 1722 and 1755. Gottsched found himself in a paradoxical position throughout the dispute. The battle for unrhymed verse had been won by the time Klopstock began to write, but it was he who first fully exploited the victory. P. Bockmann, 'Eighteenth century German hymnic verse', Reality and Creative Vision, 121-34, discusses the changing significance of hymnic in vocation from Klopstock through Stolberg, Neufer and Goethe to Holderlin, reflecting as it does a changing concept of God, Nature and the self. R. R. Heitner, German Tragedy in the Age of Enlightenment. A study in the development of original tragedies, 1724-1768, Berkeley Los Angeles, Univ. of California Press, 1963, 467 pp., is an exhaustive study of a field that does not at first sight appear very promising. H. is fully aware of the faults attributed to Gottsched's Schaubiihne and the works of tragedians like E. v. Kleist and Chr. F. Weisse, but he contrives to bring out, too, the impressive qualities of this body of lit. as a fervent expression and confirmation of the public belief in a rationally ordered moral universe. H. also points out that many of these works, although lacking in poetry, are well-fashioned and dramatically effective within their limitations. The range of the study from Stranitzky's Haupt- und Staatsaktionen to Gerstenberg's Ugolino demonstrates that the German tragedy was by no means static in this era. Much of H.'s work is occupied with summaries and assessments of little-known works, and from this point of view alone the book is a very welcome addition to the literature. R. Bauer, ' "Das gemiBhandelte Schicksal". Zur Theorie des Tragischen im deutschen Idealismus', Euph, Wm, 243-59. W. Rieck, 'Das Truppentheater und sein Publikum in litera rischer Sicht', FF, xxxviii, 218-20, offers evidence from comedies by Henrici and Konig for the predominantly middle-class composition of audiences and their unruly behaviour. W.</page><page sequence="9">454 German Studies Witte, eDeus absconditus. Shakespeare in i8th-c. Germany', Papers mainly Shakespearian, Edinburgh-London, Oliver and Boyd, pp. 76-89, is mainly concerned with Goethe and Schiller: W. demonstrates concisely how each German poet formed a Shakespeare in his own image, Goethe following a pattern of submission and withdrawal, Schiller constantly casting him in a reflective and intellectualized mould. R. R. Heitner, 'The Iphigenie in Tauris theme in drama of the 18th c.', CL, xvi, 289-309, briefly considers 19 works in French, Italian and German from ca. 1670-1781. H. Himmel, Geschichte derdt. Novelle, Berne-Munich, Francke, 1963, 545 pp., has a chapter on cDie klassische Novelle' (pp. 42-82) which deals mainly with Goethe but also makes reference to Wieland and Kleist. K. K.

Jhs', FF, xxxviii, 178-82, is a highly condensed but well documented article on the nature and distribution of periodicals which points to the linguistic complications which arise from different stylistic levels and regional peculiarities in a situation in which journals borrowed items from each other. G. B. Parks, 'The turn to the romantic in the travel lit. of the 18th c.', MLQ, xxv, 22-33, contains passing ref. to Haller, Heinse and Goethe. M. Link, Der Reisebericht als lit. Kunstform von Goethe bis Heine, 196 pp., is a Cologne diss., 1963. H. Hatfield, Aesthetic Paganism in German Lit. from Winckel mann to the Death of Goethe, Cambridge, Mass., Harvard U.P., 283 pp., attempts to cover too much ground: the result is fragmentary, superficial and hectic. There is practically nothing new in subject-matter or interpretation and the style is at times intolerably jaunty and near-journalistic ? the recurrence of phrases like 'a true son of the Enlightenment' is particularly jarring. A more serious failing is the lack of any clear definition of terms and the specious application of the label 'Christian' to works like Iphigenie. H. O.

This is a scholarly and perceptive work which casts light far beyond the immediate limits of its topic. H. W. Seiffert, 'C.M.W.s vitae veterum philosophorum', EE, xxxviii, 113-18, describes in detail a sub stantial MS. of W.'s lectures in Zurich made by the Ott brothers, two of his pupils, about 1755/6.

Wolfel, 'Daphnes Verwandlungen. Zu einem Kapitel in W.s Agathon\ JDSG, viii, 41-56, deals with the episode of the pantomimic dance of Daphne and Apollo in Book 4, chapter 5. Wolfel discusses the complex use that W. makes of the myth and its pantomimic representation in the novel as a means of expressing moral dilemma and psychological development in the characters of Agathon and Danae. W. modifies subtly the traditional view in which women play the part of the seducer: by refinement of psychological motivation he turns potential seduction into moral education. W. H.

Rowohlts Monographien no. 100, Reinbek b. Hamburg, Rowohlt, 186 pp., is devoted to G.: with so much material available the effect is perhaps a little congested, but</page><page sequence="20">The Classical Era 465 the author, P. Boerner, writes fluently and there is a better than average bibl. by H. Riege which takes welcome cognizance of works in English and French. O. P. Schwelling, Faust und Faustine. Eine psychographische Studie um G.s Eros, Cologne Graz, Bohlau, 135 pp., draws a parallel between G.'s re sumption of work on Faust and a violent erotic eruption in January 1788. The author interprets with some acuteness the flame symbolism of G.'s work at this time and assigns to Claudine von Villa Bella and Erwin und Elmire rather more personal significance than is generally credited to them. The Hexenkiiche is plausibly interpreted as a sexual nightmare and its composition during G.'s Roman holiday made to seem highly fitting. The detailed interpretation is impressive at points, but there is an overall impression that the author is working strenuously towards foregone conclusions. The style is rather sensational, and S. shows a tendency to nervous under-pinning of the argu ment by superfluous notes. The eight essays assembled by H. Tummler in G. in Staat und Politik draw heavily on the author's eds of Carl August's corr. and the corr. of G. and Voigt. 'G.s politische Tatigkeit 1778-90' (pp. 1-56), shows the poet as little more than his prince's confidential secretary, but helps to explain the frustration which prompted the flight to Italy. 'G.s politisches Gutachten aus dem Jahre 1779' (pp. 57-76) is concerned with Weimar's dilemma in the face of Prussian demands for recruiting facilities. From a lit. point of view perhaps the most suggestive of the essays is 'G. und die Tragodie des Emigranten de Wendel in Ilmenau (1795)' (pp. 77-103): it not only demonstrates G.'s keen interest in metallurgy and technology, but also shows clearly the way in which G. heightened the incident dramatically in his Tag- und Jahreshefte. 'Der Friede des klassischen Weimar' (pp. 104-31) pays tribute to Carl August's skill in extricating his country from the revolutionary war after the Peace of Basle. G. and Voigt emerge as tolerant and humane in the matter of Fichte's 'Atheismusstreit' ('G.s Anteil an der Entlassung Fichtes von seinem Jenaer Lehramt' ? pp. 132-66); it is disturbing, however, to observe that G. apparently tried to mask his part in a generally discreditable affair by recovering and destroying the relevant letters to Voigt. 'G. im Jenaer Krisenjahr 1803' (pp. 167-209) describes G.'s attempts to stem 30</page><page sequence="21">466 German Studies the alarming flight of talent from the Univ. of Jena that came not long after the cAtheismusstreit\ 'Gliickwunsch und Anteilnahme' (pp. 210-39) gives moving evidence of the cordial relationship between G. and Voigt in the years from 1806 until the latter's death in 1819. 'G., Voigt und die weimarische Pressefreiheit' (pp. 240-69) shows the conservative attitude of both men towards Oken's radical journal Isis and the demonstrations of the 'Burschenschaft'. Most of these studies have been publ. elsewhere, but together they form a harmonious and informative monograph on an important aspect of G.'s life. Also relevant here is J. A. von Bradish, 'G. im Dienste Karl Augusts', JWGV, lxvii, 1963, 85-91. W. Handrick, 'Die Schmeller-Bildnisse in G.s Kunstsammlung', NFJGG, xxvi, 248-59, gives a brief biography of the artist (1794-1841) who was commissioned by G. to execute black and white chalk portraits of many of his friends. J. Gores, 'Zwei unveroffentlichte Goethe-Bildnisse', Jb. d. Sammlung Kippenberg, i, 36-44. 'A newly discovered portrait of Christ iane?', PEGS, xxxiii, 150, casts justifiable doubt on the im probable identification of a portrait by H. C. Kolbe. LITERARY WORKS Various Aspects J. Gores, 'G.s Verhaltnis zur Topik', JVFJGG, xxvi, 144-80, describes and interprets the use of topoi from their naive adoption in the poems of G.'s childhood ('Bescheidenheitstopos') to a more sophisticated employment ('Naturanrufung') and finally to a stage where they are linked with G.'s poetological views and with his notion of the 'Urphanomen'. There are interesting incidental remarks on such topoi as 'locus amoenus' (Ilmenau), 'fortitudo et sapientia' (Egmont and Oranien; Orestes and Pylades) and the garden of the Hesperides as the emblem of timelessness (Mignon's song). H. Rehder, 'Studies in G.'s poetic imagery', Texas Studies in Lit. and Language, vi, 155-69; 334-45, is concerned with the symbolism of the cave and of the wilderness and garden and pursues a somewhat erratic course. The cave is interpreted as a symbol of sanctuary, the antithesis of garden and wilderness as that of'logos' and 'eros'. This is a difficult article to summarize ? and not made any easier by</page><page sequence="22">The Classical Era 467 rather bizarre terminology: we are told, for instance, 'trans cendence is the very substance and objective of G.'s poetic endeavour'. Are we to understand 'transcendence' in the scholastic or the Kantian sense? If the latter ('that which is not realisable in experience') it seems a strange quality to attribute to G. J. Mattausch, 'Zur Entwicklung der Gliedstellung in der Prosa des jungen G.', BDP (O), lxxxv, 1963, 197-219. W. Grenzmann, Derjunge G. Interpretationen, Paderborn, Schoningh, 109 pp. Faust F. Strich, G.s Faust, Berne-Munich, Francke, 167 pp., is ? unhappily ? a posthumous publ., ed. from S.'s lectures and notes by G. Strich-Sattler. The interpretation is designed as a protest against the recently tarnished image of Faustian man and 'die existentielle Abwertung des Menschen', and as such can fairly be described as 'conventional'. S. sees G.'s drama as a theodicy, the justification by God of apparent evil in the world. From a brief survey of the historical and literary tradition, the author works through the various versions and parts of the drama: needless to say, the book is written with spirit and full of fine observation. Of particular note is S.'s emphatic opinion that F. ardently desires 'den schonen Augenblick', that he strives against his better nature. This is a view which can only be held if we isolate Faust from Mephistopheles, and, in fact, very little attention is here paid to the latter. At times the reading of particular motifs ? e.g. Euphorion ? is a shade pedestrian, and one might join issue with S. on the question as to whether F. does in fact forswear magic ('Konnt' ich Magie von meinem Pfad entfernen ...'). H. J. Weigand, 'G.'s Faust. An introduction for students and teachers of general lit. (Part 1)', GQ, xxxvii, 467-86, has some perceptive things to say, but the terminology is jarring ('an infinite dynamic expansion and spiritual escalation'; God as represented 'in the best anthropomorphic tradition'; 'the personality of the wretched girl [Gretchen] ... is completely shattered'). Far too much effort is devoted to working out an exact chronology: does it matter whether Valentine was murdered on 28th April ? H. O. Burger, 'Motiv, Konzeption, Idee.

Bub (YWML, xxv, 350) and hence the latest instalment in a flaccid controversy. K. J. R. Arndt, 'Zu "den Liicken in der Gretchentragodie" ', MoH, lvi, 174-6, is a sequel to an article by V. E. Nollendorfs, MoH, lv, 253-64. A. links the original words of Gretchen's song (cMein Schoos! Gott! drangt sich nach ihm hin') with 'aus einem Punkte zu kuriren' of the 'Studentenszene' and draws conclusions about the re-arrangement of scene sequence in Fragment and Faust I. The fact that Gretchen is speaking of sexual desire will hardly have escaped even those scholars who had too much delicacy to insist on the point in print. 'Probleme bei einer bulgarischen i^-st-tjbersetzung', NFJGG, xxvi, 266-76, is by D. Statkow, a recent translator of F. There are some enlightening parallels, not only with the original, but also with recent Czech and Russian transls. M. Winkler, 'Zur Bedeutung der verschiedenen VersmaBe von Faust F, S, xviii, 5-21. P. Requadt, 'Die Figur des Kaisers in Faust IF, JDSG, viii, 153-71, is a slightly desperate attempt to set the Emperor in a rather more positive light and to find in the fourth act particularly some residual trace of the Emperor's baptism of fire in Act 1. A comparison is even drawn with Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II. H. Riidiger, 'Weltliteratur in G.s Helena', ib., 172-198, detects echoes of a kind of Cook's tour of world lit.: Greek drama, Minnesang, Hafis, Virgil, Ovid, Schiller and Byron ? even Mozart is noumenally present in the melodrama of the third act. This is more instructive than it might seem at first sight: the association of Lynkeus' song with Minnesang is particularly striking. O. Seidlin, 'Helena: vom Mythos zur Person', Von G. zu Thomas Mann, 65-93; 233~40' Id., 'Ist das Vorspiel auf dem Theater ein Vorspiel zum Faust?'ib., 56-64; 231-3. The latter item seems to have been publ. already in English (cf. TWML, xxiv, 386). Other Dramas Very little work seems to have appeared this year on dramas other than Faust. What there is seems to be concentrated on minor and fragmentary works. O. Seidlin, 'G.s Iphigenie ?</page><page sequence="24">The Classical Era 469 "verteufelt human"?', Von G. zu Thomas Mann, 9-22, is apparently a transl. of an essay in English (TWML, xxiv, 387). H. S. Schultz, 'Hofmannsthal's Der Schwierige and G.'s Torquato Tasso', PEGS, xxxiii, 130-49, puts forward the thesis that H.'s comedy owes its existence partly to its author's critical attitude towards G.'s drama and points to 'chiastic connections' between the two plays.

On account of the manner of its first performance Das Neuste von Plundersweilen may perhaps be considered a dramatic production: W. H. Bruford provides a very necessary guide to the topical allusions, some of which even Merck was at a loss to follow: MuK, x, 460-83. Novels, Novellen, etc. I. Parry, 'Werther and Lord Chandos', PEGS, xxxiii, 75-98, discusses the point at which, in the mind of G.'s and Hofmanns thal's heroes, harmony with the natural world turns instant aneously to disintegration and discord; the poet is seen as searching for the magic word which will inhibit or reverse this process. The article is perceptive but distended by numerous analogues and undeveloped references. H. Grasshoff, 'Zur Rolle des Sentimentalismus in der historischen Entwicklung der russischen und der westeuropaischen Literatur', /?&lt;S7, viii, 1963, 558-70, is largely about Werther. F. G. Ryder, 'Season, day and hour ? time as metaphor in G.'s Werther', JEGP, lxiii, 389-407. J. Hennig, 'Englandkunde im Wilhelm Meister\ NFJGG, xxvi, 199-222, is an erratic chase through all the versions and parts of the novels in which topics varying from English cutlery to non-conformism and democracy are snatched up, worried and dropped again. H. O. Burger, 'Europaisches Adelsideal und dt. Klassik', Studien, 211-32, is mainly con cerned with Wilhelm Meister. R. C. Zimmermann, 'Franz von Baader und G.s vier Ehrfurchten', GRM, xlv, 267-79, looks for the soil from which G.'s pedagogical ideal of the Wander jahre sprang rather than for a specific literary root: he finds it in</page><page sequence="25">470 German Studies two works by Baader ?

I. Nickel, 'G.s Ubersetzung der Vita des Benvenuto Cellini', ib., 223-38, is a detailed analysis of typical departures from literal transl. that has some interest for the student of G.'s style. Poetry Concentration this year seems to have been on G.'s shorter poems, both deictic and lyrical. An exception is M. Gerhard, 'Gotter-Kosmos und Gesetzes-Suche: Zu G.s Versuch seines Achilleis-Epos', MoH, lvi, 145-59, which concludes that the ancient world remained alien to G.: 'Die olympische Welt bleibt Goethe dennoch ein Fremdes, nur als kunstlerisches Gebild Begriffenes.' In this respect G. is compared to his disadvantage with Holderlin. Speculative arguments of this type about G.'s 'incapacity' to complete a poetic project are perhaps suspect. It is a pity that the author does not seem to have been able to consult Schadewaldt's splendid essay (cf. TWML, xxv, 353 f.). G. Rodger, 'G.s Ur-Ei in theory and practice', MLR, lix, 225-35, proceeds from G.'s view of the ballad as combining lyric, epic and dramatic elements ? 'wie in einem lebendigen Ur-Ei'. The epic element is taken for granted, and the article is devoted largely to the search for lyrical elements: these are found mainly in the sense of a musical quality (refrain, stanzaic form, alliteration, verbal echoes, etc.). Lyricism in the sense of subjectivity is rarer but is sometimes conveyed through the subjective intrusion of a narrator: here, however, it is difficult to separate lyrical and dramatic elements. G. Kaiser, 'Das Genie und seine Gotter. Ein Beitrag zu Wandrers Sturmlied von G.', Euph, lviii, 41-58, sees the poem as a triptych in which successive invocations of Apollo and Dionysus are fused in the appeal to Jupiter Pluvius. The gods are here not 'allegorische Gestalten' (did anyone</page><page sequence="26">The Classical Era 47i ever think they were?) but 'Existenzialien einer hochgemuten Innerlichkeit'. If this is so, it is odd to find them so amenable to a rational pattern. H. Kaufmann, 'G.s Gedicht an Frau von Stein vom 14. April 1776', WB, x, 359-71, elaborates the implications of the family relationships as a metaphor for the cultured social group, and sees the poem as an amalgam of intense emotion and social idealism only matched in Holderlin's 'Diotima' poems. J. Miiller, 'G.s Ilmenau-Gedicht', JWGV, lxviii, 77-101, analyses the poem written on 3rd September 1783 for Carl August's 26th birthday, stressing G.'s special feeling for the Ilmenau setting and his pedagogical aim. E. Trunz, cG.s lyrische Kurzgedichte 1771-1832', NFJGG, xxvi, 1-37, points to the spasmodic emergence in G.'s lit. career of this form. In his youth the pattern generally involves an association of landscape and state of mind, in his later poems there is an increasing formalistic use of symbols. In considering the Chinesisch-deutsche Jahres- und Tageszeiten Trunz makes the inevitable comparison with cchinesische Tuschzeichnung'; in cG.s Chinesisch-deutsche Jahres- und Tageszeiten\ JDSG, viii, 137-52, W. Preisendanz deprecates this sort of characterization as superficial and seeks to interpret the cycle as a whole. The eighth poem, 'Dammrung senkte sich von oben', is seen as the axis of the work, and the chiaroscuro of the imagery is related to the Farbenlehre\ light is interpreted as 'GenieBen und Besitzen', darkness as 'Vergessen und Entbehren'. The second half of the cycle is more deictic than the first and expresses serenity and resignation. H.-H. Reuter also sets out to consider a coll. of brief poems as a whole ? in this case cG.s Zanme Xenien\ NFJGG, xxvi, 92-135. R. treats these as a bitter and ironical expression of G.'s sense of disillusion and isolation in the new world that was emerging after 1815. At the same time R. stresses G.'s feeling of responsibility and the significance of the poems as a refined extension of Enlightenment ideals, imbued with G.'s philosophy of 'die Tat', for which parallel expressions may be found in Faust, Divan and Wanderjahre. R. points to some startling turns of expression: 'Die Welt geht auseinander wie ein fauler Fisch' sounds much more like Brecht than G. R. Fischer-Lamberg, ' "Mystische Erwider ung" ', ib., 319, corrects the dating of this occasional poem from Carlsbad, 1808 to Weimar, 29th August 1820. W. Witt</page><page sequence="27">472 German Studies sack, 'Zur Frage der Klangform des Naturmagischen in G.s Erlkonig\ WZMLUH, xi, 1773-8, is based on an analysis of recordings. O.

Wertheim, 'Das poetische Volkstalent in G.s Asthetik', WB, x, 31-54, attempts to reconstruct G.'s theory of'Naturdichtung' from reviews, prefaces and unpublished sketches. G. seems to have seen the poetry of working people and autodidacts as a potentially useful moral influence calculated to make the lower classes reflect on their situation and find it 'desirable' ? for him aesthetic education was invariably a matter for the middle class ? a limitation only now overcome, according to the author, in Eastern Germany. The poets mentioned are Griibel, Furnstein, J. A. Stumpff, I. Maus and G. Hiller. There is no evidence of any burning interest on G.'s part in this topic, and the odour of condescension that emanates from his remarks is fairly overpowering. H. Nicolai, 'G.s Schicksalsidee', MFJGG, xxvi, 77-91, has little new to say. N. distinguishes three phases: the daemonic sense of destiny that dominates down to Egmont, a new view of reason as holding the balance between chance and necessity that first appears in Iphigenie and culminates in Lehrjahre and Wahlverwandtschqften, and the more objective view that sums up the cosmic pattern in Urworte. Orphisch and sees 'Tatigkeit' and 'Entsagung' as complementary ideals. A small prize might, incidentally, be offered to the first German critic to mention Hamann without calling him 'der Magus im Norden'. R. Denker, 'Luftfahrt auf montgolfierische Art in G.s Dichten und Denken', ib., 181-98, describes G.'s keen interest in balloon flight and his own experiments and then traces the motif, both in a literal sense (Mephistopheles' aeronautical cloak, which works on the hot air principle) and the metaphorical sense, in which poetry itself is seen as a temporary soaring above the earth followed by inevitable descent. F. Schmidt, 'Aristotelica bei G.', ib., 239-47, is concerned with two topics: Aristotle's metaphysics and his</page><page sequence="28">The Classical Era 473 theory of tragedy. In the former case, S. points out that A. and G. had in common the view of universality and essence as immanent in phenomena; in the latter case, G. tended to consider the tragedy in its aesthetic sovereignty rather than by reference to its effect on the on-looker. In this way he modified the view of A. while believing that he still adhered to it. There is some relevance here to the duality of the naive and the sentimental. W.

Bluhm continues to quarry diligently among the Newberry papers: 'Scope and significance of the "Newberry Goetheana" ', GQ, xxxvii, 230-8, makes it clear that there is much still to come, including 26 notebooks containing Ottilie's diaries from about 1840 to nearly the end of her life, of which B. diffidently remarks, 'G. himself is not mentioned too often'. It looks as if future vols will be even more of a chronique scandaleuse with the details of Ottilie's affairs with Charles Sterling, des Voeux, Gustav Kuhne and Dr. Seligmann. Henriette v. Pogwisch. Weimar im Jahre 1832: Briefe an Adele Schopenhauer, ed. H. Bluhm, Vienna, Bergland, 65 pp., is a cSonderband' in the series of Ottilie's letters and diaries. It is chiefly notable for the earliest known non-clinical account of G.'s death. Other wise, the effect of the corr. is dreary enough: gossip, squabbles about money and scarcely the trace of an intellectual interest anywhere. H. Bluhm, 'August und Ottilie von Goethe. Neue Briefe aus den Newberry Goetheana', NFJGG, xxvi, 286-307, consists of corr. from 1823-5, when the pair were already</page><page sequence="29">474 German Studies married: there are signs of strain both between them and between August and his father, who, he complains, expects too much in the way of household management and assistance from him. Details of Weimar social life are useful corroboration of G.'s diaries. The Shakespeare anniversary has evoked some studies of G.'s acquaintance with Shakespeare's work. R. Pascal, 'G. und das Tragische. Die Wandlung von G.s Shakespeare-Bild', NFJGG, xxvi, 38-53, points out that G.'s view of the technical and theatrical aspect of S.'s drama barely changed. His view of the tragic was, however, apparently affected by his reading of S. and the idea of the collision of cSollen' and 'Wollen' in the tragic hero which he deduced from S.'s plays (Shakespeare und kein Ende). In view of G.'s known repugnance for the tragic, it is remarkable that he insisted on the tragic endings to Shakes pearian plays ? which were in his day customarily modified, even in England. U. Wertheim, Thilosophische und asthetische Aspekte in Prosastiicken G.s iiber Shakespeare', ib., 54-76, outlines a number of points, but deals mainly with the idea of freedom and necessity, of good and evil and of immortality, with reference to the Rede zum Schdkespears Tag, the Hamlet interpretation of Wilhelm Meister and Shakespeare und kein Ende. The significance of G.'s study of Spinoza is stressed here, as it was by Pascal. H. W. Hausermann, 'Hat G. Shakespeares 64. Sonett gekannt?', ASJVS, cci, 161-8, seeks parallels between the sonnet beginning 'When I have seen by time's fell hand defaced' and an English poem written by G. in his youth ? and also Faust's second monologue (634-51). The argument is inconclusive. H. Tiimmler, 'G. an Voigt. Kleine Nachlese zum Goethe Voigt-BriefwechseP, NFJGG, xxvi, 277-85, reproduces three items omitted from T.'s ed. of the corr. F. Smend, Ferner Freunde ward gedacht, Berlin, Merseburger, 6 leaves and illus., is a pamphlet that elucidates the poem no. 93 of the group 'Rhein und Main' in Inschriften, Denk- und Sende-Blatter: it accompanied a picture of Frankfurt by Anton Radl which G. sent to the Willemers and Rosine Stadel about 28 August 1816.

Loeb, ' "Der Enkel Einer": Betrachtungen zu einer unbekannten Stammbuch-Eintragung Walther von Goethes', NFJGG, xxvi, 260-5, is prompted by the Divan verses written by W. v. Goethe in the album of Auguste Richter on the eve of her departure for America in 1862 to reflect on the tragically ineffective life of G.'s grandson. H. Koch, 'Ludwig HeB, ein Kupferstecher aus der Goethezeit', ib., 308-18, gives an account of the engraver employed by G. to provide illus trations for Westostlicher Divan and Zur Naturwissenschaft uberhaupt. W. Leppmann, CG. und die pompejanische Tradi tion', GQ, xxxvii, 219-29, comments on G.'s relatively detached and scientific interest in Pompeii and Herculanum and gives an account of the condition of the cities in G.'s time and since. J. P. Stern, Re-interpretations. Seven studies in nineteenth-century German literature, London, Thames and Hudson, 370 pp., has a chapter (pp. 30-41) on the lit. heritage that G. bequeathed to the 19th c.: the unpolitical nature of this heritage and the unique conditions of G.'s cultural environment are stressed.

Staiger interprets certain paradoxes in S.'s work not as the result of fluctuating moods but rather as a consequence of re-direction of the moral will. He points to the sombre vein that runs through much of S.'s work and issues as a distrust of the world and what it has to offer. H. G. Nerjes, 'S. und Karl August von Weimar', MoH, lvi, 273-80, shows the relationship to have been superficial: S. expected too much of the Duke and only gradually developed a sense of responsibility towards him. On the evidence given here, Karl August shows up in a much better light than S. J. Trainer, 'Caroline Schmidt and the Schillers', GLL, xvii, 339-48, describes the friendship of S., Charlotte S. and Caroline, the daughter of J. C. Schmidt, Geheimer Legationsrat in Weimar. Caroline, whom S. apparently contemplated marrying at one time, eventually married an English business-man, Edward Swaine of Halifax, and spent most of her life in England. T. prints seven letters from her to</page><page sequence="32">The Classical Era 477 Charlotte S. discovered in the Goethe-Schiller-Archiv, Weimar. The most interesting of these refers to an early transl. of Kabale und Liebe (see below: literary works). H. O. Burger, eS.s letzte Worte', Studien, 255-67. W.

The centre of gravity is, however, the Briefe iiber die dsthetische Erziekung: Saito examines the genesis of these in great detail, comparing the original version for Augustenburg with the version in Die Horen. The conclusion reached is that S.'s views on 'Humanitat', on philosophy, politics and history do not substantially alter after the composition of Die Gotter Griechen lands. H.

Erster TeiP, JDSG, viii, 57-111, is a considerable study of more than usual interest. M. demonstrates that the rhetorical and melodramatic features of Die Rauber belong to an operatic rather than a literary tradition and provides a survey of operatic theory and practice in Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg during S.'s youth ? in particular the pantomimic theories of J. G. Noverre may have had an influence on S. M. points out that the gestures and, above all, the choreographic effects oiDie Rauber are precisely those of the contemporary opera and ballet. The elaborate stage effects and the crowd scenes ? alien to the middle-class theatre of the time ? seem less surprising and improbable when we hear that a performance of Calliroe in the Ludwigsburg theatre (the largest in Germany) involved 16 N.C.O.'s, 470 private soldiers and 30 mounted hussars. P. Mertz, 'Die Urauffuhrung des Fiesko war in Bonn', MuK, x, 484-7, produces evidence that the Mannheim performance</page><page sequence="33">478 German Studies of 11 Jan. 1784 was preceded by one in Bonn on 20 July 1783 under the direction of Grossmann.

J. K. Timaus. The fact that Caroline mentions only four acts, along with certain anomalies in the transl. suggests, however, that another hand may also have been involved. H. O. Burger, 'Die biirgerliche Sitte. S.s Kabale und Liebe', Studien, 194-210. G. Storz, 'Der Bauerbacher Plan zum Don Carlos', JDSG, viii, 112-29, speculates that this holograph sketch of the drama was intended for submission by Reinwald to Gotter, and draws conclusions about its modifi cation from a private to a political tragedy. Storz has a some what high-handed way of dismissing theories which do not suit his book. O. Seidlin, 'Wallenstein. Sein und Zeit', Von Goethe zu Thomas Mann, 120-35; 242. M. Schunicht, 'S.s Fragmente Die Polizei und Die Kinder des Hauses', WW, xiv, 196-206, interprets the former as an experiment in the 'realistic' sphere, in which the police authority corresponds to the power of fate or Nemesis in the 'idealistic' sphere. The second fragment is seen as an attempt at a fully analytical drama, in which the audience is kept in the dark until the end, and a series of coincidences motivates the victory of the idea over the villain.
