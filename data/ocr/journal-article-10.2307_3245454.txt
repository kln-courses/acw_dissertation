<plain_text><page sequence="1">L.O.W. in Gaia Chronicle of and Meditation on a 3-Week Vacation in the Mojave Desert, January 1986 Written and Performed by Rachel Rosenthal Rachel Rosenthal's L.O.W. in Gaia was presented last fall at the Kitchen. Though its run was only three days, the work of this solo performer, seen all too infrequently in New York, was highly regarded by audiences, seemingly affected by the work's integrity and expansiveness, and no less the engage- ment of the performer. In L.O.W., Rosenthal unites the aging of her body as a woman of sixty and the aging of the earth's body. In other words, the history of the landscape is joined to the history of the human being. To go a step further, L.O.W. is played against the background of the desert, with its unmistakable allusions to the beginning of Western religious myth and the ending of contemporary high-tech mythologies. It is the voice of the sagebrush that reminds those who hear: nuclear crisis is a crisis of religion, of myth. Rosenthal, who has always been one of the most intelligent and politically committed of performers, builds her piece around complex issues, using nuclear imagery metaphorically-photography, as a kind of radiation; melting wax; the disintegration of the flesh-to interpolate the idea of the earth mother and that of the apocalypse. The significance of her work is in its understanding that performance has to merge myth and history to make cosmic themes breathe today. Perhaps this is Peter Brook's secret, it is cer- tainly Heiner Muller's greatness. More significantly, in an "avant-garde" solo performance that draws upon contemporary technique and style in its approach to the form, Rosenthal nevertheless returns to theatre's ancient religious function of enacting publicly the myths of the community. By mak- ing her history simultaneously of nature and of people, Rachel Rosenthal radiates an energy that brings life not death, calm if not solace.

How do we communicate with humans who may have little con- cept of the world of 1986 and its symbols? If the recommendations of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) become reality, 300 generations of our descendants will hear our message spoken in the silent language of monoliths. Some high level military waste, created primarily by processing plutonium for nuclear bombs, may be solidified in place where they are now stored or have leaked into the soil, at the federally owned Hanford Nuclear Reserva- tion in Washington State. There, radioactive materials would be covered with a mere 20 feet of soil and stones. The contaminated earth would be literally melted and turned into dark, obsidian-like glass. High voltage electrodes placed in the ground would vitrify up to 800 metric tons of earth at a time by elevating the soil's temperature to as high as 2000?C. The plan is to ring the whole thirty-two-square-mile area containing these sites with an early-warning system of monoliths.

She is bent in half, walks stiffly, her hands retracted like a thalidomide baby's, no longer prehensile. Her jaw is fused open and cannot shut. She has no lips-a sign of degeneracy (Rosen- thal folds her upper lip in over her teeth). She makes little sounds by suck- ing air in. This is our descendant, the irradiated monster. The creature looks around, unaware of the meaning of the monoliths and looks for and catches flies. Exit.

To be beside myself. To fly! and I only have four weeks! Yes. My vacation. My first vacation in years. I must make it. (Pressure.) It's now or never. Can't blow it. I rent a Dodge Van. Leave all the animals in care of Linda. I'll eat and sleep in the van. Bought a little butane stove with cans, two quilted jackets one with one without sleeves, a sun visor, a compass, camping dishes, a backpack and some food. It costs to be a bum for a month. So I can't blow it. I have a book to write, five to read, a performance to prepare, some drawing material, my drum, and I want to hike a lot, take photos, observe wildlife through my opera glasses, go on a water fast and a vision quest. I only have a month.

(Rosenthal takes off backpack and sits in a big overstuffed chair. She un- packs the pack.) -On the first day, the Goddess sent me a gift. I leave L.A. tired, out of shape. I am timid, reticent. I want to go slow. I coddle myself. Then I get lost in the San Gabriel Mountains. I climb up and down for nine hours! No food. No water. I have bad knees. I can't even feel my legs ... I keep going. Numb. Out of breath. Heart pounding. Nauseous. Nearly passing out. I end up up to my waist in snow, falling on my face every second step, racing the sun to the 5 p.m. setting. I must come down from 8000'. On my ass. Hands and feet cut and frozen. Exhausted. A miracle: I hit the highway at exactly 5 p.m. It's night. Pitch black. I thumb a ride back to the van, miles down the road, crash and figure "That's it. I've done it. Totalled. That's the end of the vaca- tion!" But the next day, I'm not even sore! A true rite of passage! I can do anything! I have no fear! (Rosenthal has lit a candle, a small butane stove, placed a kettle on it, and unpacked a cup.) -Dodge Van. My new house. I must learn it. My body must learn the new correct heights, angles, rhythms, arcs, directions, that will insure that daily life is second-nature smooth.

Here are the flashlights and bat- teries. I pee, wipe, and stash. (Rosenthal repeats all the gestures as a dance, to Music: "Parade" by Erik Satie.) -I am free. I am alone. I drive 25 miles an hour, me Mario Andretti! (Somewhere in here the kettle boils. Rosenthal takes a tea bag out of her pocket, places it in the cup and pours the water.) -I look, I drink in. I'm elated! I climb and hike for hours. I CAN DO ANYTHING! I am never afraid of Her... I am in love! I caress the dappled hills at a distance. I kiss the mauve sunsets filled with bees.

In one dream, I saw a woman, very dark and demonic, who was acting with mischievous intent. She was laughing and bathing herself in black fluid. Then she lay down under a table-sarcophagus, her underside naked and her following their exuberant expansion. Having become a species of super- topside covered with a black body-mask. She was in profile but turned her head to look at me and laughed. Who is she? What does she want? Slides: "Our species has expanded so copiously and used resources so pro- digiously that we now must expect to crash. Nature must, in the not too distant future, institute bankruptcy procedures against industrial civilization, and perhaps against the standing crop of human flesh, just as nature has done many times to other detritus-consuming species following their exuberant expansion. Having become a species of super- detritovores-living off dead matter such as the fossil fuels in great ex- travagance-mankind is destined not merely for success, but for crash."

The slides flash on in the same accelerating rhythm as the music. When the image of her in the pre- sent comes on, all the photos reappear going backwards until the last slide is of her as a baby. All are black and white. (When the music becomes very fast, Rosenthal stands and walks upstage, then parallel to the screen or back wall on which the photos are projected. She stops in the center of the image, and begins to age. By the end of the musical sequence and before the baby slide, she is an old woman.) Music: still "Chronos," but from frenetic, the music becomes very soft and mysterious. Lights: side lights, green on one side, purple on the other, catching Rosen- thal in the middle. Rosenthal -I am the Crone. The third aspect of the Triple Goddess. The one you most fear. You can accept the Virgin, barely stomach the Mother, but me, you have attempted to destroy. I am your Death. Not the glamorous death of battle, of heroism, of blood spilled for the cause. No. I am gout, ulcers, rheumatism, Alzheimer's, and cancer. I am deterioration. I am helplessness and I am hopeless. You never wish to see me. For I remind you, in all my weakness, that I am stronger than you. I am stronger than any god. I am Nemesis of the Greeks. Morgan Le Fay of the Celts.

Ah! What silence! So silent I can hear my blood gushing in my ears. The stars! An owl once almost flew into the van ... One night I was graced with a coyote concert, distant, fleeting, haunting ... (She becomes very nervous, darts glances around, begins to pack her things feverishly.) Rosenthal -It's hard, all that silence, peace, quiet, isolation ... I've got to get out of here! I know! I'll go to Needles, to a motel. I'll take a bath, do my laundry ... (She puts on the cap and the backpack, and exits.)

Who but a monster could ignore the place, the connection? Ah, but ... We are all monsters, aren't we? All of us: Judeos, Christians, Moslems ... we are all descendants of the fundamental monster, ancestral Adam, "not-of-woman-born." Artificial intelligence, just like Frankenstein's, but created ... six thousand years ago... ? I guess he couldn't take female contamination: "Get those fallopian tubes out of my sight!" Only a monster not-of-woman-born could be so stupid as not to notice he's sawing off the branch he sits on. I am dispirited. I feel I'm not doing it. I'm blowing it. I haven't used my oil pastels. The per- formance isn't coming. Either I should do much more, or not do anything at all. Stop eating and just be. Besides, I have nothing to say. How do you do a performance about watching a loved-one die? Sound of footsteps in varied terrain, recorded in the desert. I try to walk lightly on the land as one tiptoes around a sickbed. I try to leave as little spoor as the jackrabbit or the kangaroo rat. But I can't. With every step I take I broadcast my field about me. And in that field are memories, observations, qualifiers, appraisals: "This tree is interesting!"-Therefore those aren't? "This smell reminds me of France."-Therefore it's no longer itself. "I wish I could see a coyote!"-Therefore all the other treasures of- fered up are insufficient. I carry all this, dragging it up and down the altitudes. I can hear it banging and clanging. It makes such a racket, no wonder the coyotes avoid me! I surprise a few rabbits who dart away as soon as they hear the din. I feel isolated and shunned. I want so much to be recognized. I want the Mother to know me by sight and to engulf me in her arms as she does all the other dwellers. But I'm not a dweller. I'm a tourist. 85</page><page sequence="11">After all those decades ... still homeless ... still split-brained ... Ah, but I'm careful to put all my wipes in this bag (indicates the garbage bag around her neck). (Rosenthal is still building the altar. She also uses some plates painted yellow and magenta with a symbol vaguely reminiscent of the three triangles warning of nuclear radiation. She will end up placing the large candle she lit at the beginning on one of the plates before the altar.) In Needles, while I was doing my laundry, an old codger came nosing around the van. (Old codger! ... He told me he was sixty ...) Anyway, he said: "Every time I see a single in a van I look for the 'L.O.W.' sticker." I bit. "What's that?" He said: "L.O.W.-it's 'Loner on Wheels.' It's a club. I belonged for eighteen years but now I'm disqualified because I got married." While I changed the sheets on my mattress, he regaled me with the following story: he, his new wife, and an assortment of pets were going to drive up to Washington State to dig a hole. They would build their house underground and live there. I thought: Hmmm. That's nice. An ecological decision. But, just to be on the safe side, I said: "Why?" He said: "Well, we'll have lots of grains, and rice, and lentils, and navy beans, and pinto beans ... enough for a year. Then, when the Ruskies decide to drop the Big One, we'll just hole up and weather it." I said: "Oh. What about water?" He said: "There's a lake nearby!" I said: "Hmmm. What about radiation?" He said: "We'll have a filter." "L.O.W." ... I thought about that. "Loner on Wheels." I guess I was that all right. Loner on Wheels in Gaia ... Loner on Wheels in Gaia... ? Hey, perhaps that could be the title of the new performance ...

Anyone who dug into the mounds would chance upon some of these yellow and magenta plates, with markings, matching those on the monoliths. One side of each disk would feature a warning symbol. But what would prevent the markers from becoming a popular collector's item for future amateur archaeologists or perhaps ending up on the shelves of local entrepreneurs?

They are beautiful views, and come fast. Little by little the slides change to litter and garbage in the desert growth. The last slides are of a garbage garden Rosenthal discovered in a desert dweller's front yard. Voiceover (Ronald Salley) The deep-welling of industrial garbage has become a surprisingly exten- sive practice in America, a way for corporations to rid themselves of tox- ic residues without encountering the rigid governmental restrictions and public clamor associated with the more visible landfills. Today, more hazardous liquids are shot deep underground than are poured into metal 87</page><page sequence="13">drums and buried in standard dumpsites. It is both cheap and dangerous. The Federal Government hasn't even tabulated all the problems associated with well disposal. Usually the trouble is caused by wastes corroding pipelines, reacting adversely with rock formations, finding their way through geological fractures, or leaking from surface containers. Former Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel says: "Deep injection is a potential Frankenstein monster." It's a classic case of out-of-sight out-of-mind technology. Wastewater stored in unlined canals and lagoons in Rocky Mountain migrated through the rich, powdery surface soil within a 30 square-mile zone, poisoning 64 domestic, stock, and irrigation wells. Sediments con- taining dioxin were detected recently in the St. Claire river near Lake Huron after a scuba diver there reported a glob of pollutants on the river bottom, his face mask dissolving when he got too close. Rick Plitz, analyst in the Department of Agriculture, says: "I'm real un- comfortable with this being the method of choice because of the difficul- ty of telling for sure what's going on down there. If you have a problem later, if the stuff is working its way into groundwater supply or coming up abandoned wells, by the time you see what the problem is there's nothing you can do about it."

Rosenthal -I haven't washed for a week. The desert is my second skin. I am a real bum now. I feel at home. I stink! I am a bum. This is my true nature. I'll go back to L.A., sell everything, and become a desert rat forever! I'm an old cactus. (She glances over at various piles of junk and hole-riddled beer cans on the floor.) Gaia's a bum. Everywhere I look, there's garbage. (She walks over to the junk.) As far as I can hike in the remotest canyons, I see beer cans, cartridges, junk... I cry a lot. Do ceremonies. I grease my face.

The average lifespan is seventy-five. Since the Earth is 4.5 billion years old and since our star the Sun won't become a Red Giant for another 5 billion years, then in human terms Gaia is about thirty. Much too young to die, wouldn't you say? (She sees some rib bones lying around and grabs one in each hand. She postures like a samurai.) I'm an old cactus! And I am mean. I will defend my turf. I will protect the Earth. And I'll claw. Don't brush past me. My spikes will imbed themselves into your flesh. Just a hint. A reminder. "Attention must be paid!" At this point we want no affection, thank you. Just respect. (She decides to go to the altar and stands behind it, the candle just before her feet. She gestures with the two bones. Lights focus on the altar and become progressively more mysterious and dramatic.) I have Venus in Scorpio: all or nothing. I tried for "all" a few times and got indigestion. So I opted for "nothing." I am not one for crumbs. I am a loner. All that love. All that lust. All that passion. Buried deep. Does it fester inside, does it grow toxic? (She puts down the bones.) I lived in the Burning Times. 89</page><page sequence="15">I was lowered into a deep dungeon in an iron cage, naked, and hoisted up and burned alive. I remember it well. I cursed as I died. How I cursed those men! I feel it now. In every caged animal. Every trapped paw. In the tortured lab rat. In the rabbits in stocks, their eyes burned out with cosmetic testing. In the deep injection of toxic wastes into the Mother. In the ignoble plan to place electrodes in her body and vitrify nuclear wastes and mummify them for all eternity ... I am ill with unquenched vengeance. (The above is spoken in extreme emotion, using loops, repetitions, abstracted motion, etc. She drops to her knees.) Gaia, my Beauty, my Lovely, my Adored One! My core melts with love for you. And compassion. And tenderness. But not calm. Not peaceful. I could kill! I am Lover on Wheels in Gaia! I am filled with love. Filled with violence.

You loose my locked-up carbons into the very medium and condition of your existence, the air you breathe, carefully calibrated and fine-tuned by me and mine.

Down there, I am a demon who destroys in an instant what it took me millions of years to build. I shove the continents around. Smash India into Tibet. Crash Africa up Italy's boot. Play scrabble with the North-American West. Spin Europe around like a top. Lift the seas up to the peaks. With my fist I push deep buried rock up higher than the high plateaus, expose the sculpture within, polish and burnish with wind, water, and the fine abrasion of sanded rock. I play and you die. Of my lava, of my fires, of the gaping fissures that swallow you alive. I send flames. I send ice. I send slides, flood and avalanches. I scatter gold about to lure your greed. You follow me below, progressively addicted. You love to touch the bowels of the Mother, to be the first inside her cavities, her stomach, her veins. You brave my numbing darkness, my petrifying silence, the panic of an extinguished torch, the brushing past of my Spirits of the Deep ... You burrow like moles. You dive into deep pools, not knowing when, where, or if you will emerge. You hang upside down like bats. You squeeze into rat tunnels, gradually narrowing, the deep rock corset pinning your arms to your sides, alone, motionless, your hat light getting fainter, fainter, while no help comes. No one knows you're here ... And I embrace you into my body, gently dripping a trickle of water on the cheek you cannot reach. Without sentimentality. Alive or dead, it is all the same to me. But you pump me full of poisons. You force-feed me substances I cannot tolerate. I try to absorb, to burn, to cleanse, but more comes. Always more. My bowels hurt. I am ill. I want to vomit.
