<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREGORY CURRIE Unreliability Refigured: Narrative in Literature and Film As consumers of fiction, we have become skilled at recognizing unreliable narratives; as theoreticians, we are less well able to say what constitutes unreliability and how it is detected. I aim to improve our understanding of the theo- retical issues. In the process, I hope to show four things: (1) That narrative unreliability is a concept sep- arable from the concept of an unreliable narrator; (2) That narrative unreliability requires for its explanation the concept of an implied author; (3) That narrative unreliability bears close and interesting connections to the importantly distinct concept of an ambiguous narrative;1 (4) That we can explain the prevalence of cer- tain devices in narrative in terms of the ease or difficulty of the reader's task in figuring out whether and how those devices are being used. Another theme that runs through the discussion is the relation between narration in literary fic- tions and in film. Indeed, the central example of narrative unreliability I shall use is an exam- ple from film. Part of the problem of develop- ing an adequate general theory of narrative has been the tendency to fix on narrative literature as the central explanatory target, and to apply the theory so generated to other representa- tional modes: a method which often leads to strained and implausible results. I shall be assuming throughout that the com- prehension of narrative is essentially a matter of intentional inference; the reader or viewer has to infer, on the basis of her reading or viewing, the complex and sometimes covert intentions that seem to lie behind the words and images the work presents. But while I shall not be argu- ing directly for this hypothesis, what follows will constitute a test of it. For the worth of the hypothesis is directly proportional to its success in explaining those particular devices which make up the repertoire of narrative. Unreliability is one of them. The fact that our theory does well in explaining the mechanisms of unre- liability tells strongly in its favor. I. FICTIONS MISDESCRIBED A newspaper article can be unreliable, meaning that it misleads us about what actually hap- pened, or would mislead us if we found it cred- ible. Being misleading in this sense requires a disparity between the world as it is and the world as it is represented to be, in this case by a news- paper. Is there then, in the case of the unreliable fictional narrative, a disparity between the world of the novel and the claims that someone- we might very naturally call her a narrator- makes about that world? That this is always and necessarily the explanation of unreliability in narrative is an idea I want to challenge. Before I do, it is worth noting that, even from the point of view of one who thinks that narrators are always the source of unreliability, the idea of "fictional reality misdescribed" is hardly one we can appeal to in explanation of that unre- liability. You may believe that there are fic- tional worlds.2 But if you do, you must be care- ful not to fall into a quasi-magical mode of explanation, whereby you "explain" what hap- pens in the fiction by appeal to what happens in the corresponding world. For how does a par- ticular fictional world, w, get to be the fictional world of The Good Soldier? Not because of any straightforward fit between the meaning of the text and world w; we want to say that, since this The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 53:1 Winter 1995</page><page sequence="2">20 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism is an unreliable narrative, the text misdescribes w. So what extratextual mechanism links the text to this world and no other? More than one answer is possible, but whatever answer is fa- vored, the locus of our interest in the nature of unreliability must surely be the mechanism it- self and not the world that mechanism locates. For it is in the workings of that mechanism that we shall find the justification for saying, "The text is a misdescription of this world, rather than a correct description of that one." Since I hold that this mechanism is intention, and the recognition of intention on the part of the audi- ence, I hold that intention is the key to narrative unreliability. But that, we may suppose, is a lesson well learned. For the standard account of narrative unreliability is one that appeals, exactly, to the mental economies of agents-though these agents are typically thought of as hypothetical or imagi- native constructs rather than living beings. The standard account says that narrative unreliabil- ity is a product of a discrepancy between what we might call internal and external perspec- tives. The external perspective is that of the so- called "implied author," a figure who in a sense may herself be fictional or imagined, because her mental economy does not necessarily corre- spond to that of the actual author, but who is not to be thought of as occupying a position within the work itself. Rather she is conceptualized as the agent responsible for the story qua fiction.3 The internal perspective is that of a narrator; a creature who is conceptualized as a product of the work itself, rather than as the work's pro- ducer. In a moment I shall describe how the conflict between these two perspectives creates unreliability. But we need first to note that nar- rators come in a variety of kinds, of which two shall be distinguished at once. The narrator may be internal (or intradiege- tic): a character within the story itself, to be thought of as telling what is in fact fiction as if it were known fact-or as lies or deluded rav- ings, but not, anyway, as fiction (then she is internal not only to the work but to the fictional story that work has to tell). Or she may be an external (extradiegetic) narrator, who announces herself as telling the story as fiction, but where there is some reason to think of this narrator's voice as distinct from and dependent on that of the imnlied author While it mav he nossihie for narrators of both kinds to count as unreliable, rather different kinds of unreliability attach to each, and it is not altogether easy to state the difference between them. But I shall not enquire more deeply into the difference between these two kinds of unreliability, because I shall be asking: What happens to the concept of unre- liability when there is no narrator? Merely for the sake of simplicity, and not because it favors my argument, I shall speak only of intradiegetic narrators in what follows: they are more com- monly the source of narrative unreliability, and their role in opposition to the implied author is easier to conceptualize, since it is often very difficult to distinguish between a case where implied author and extradiegetic narrator are distinct, and a case where the implied author is simply speaking ironically. The implied author is epistemically domi- nant over the narrator in this sense: that the intentions of the implied author determine what is true in the story, while the mental economy of the narrator is thought of simply as a part of the story itself and not as authoritative-not, at least, automatically so. The narrator's role is to tell us what is true in the story, and, like tellers in real life, she may have it wrong, or wish to tell us other than what she believes is true. On this model, we perceive narrative unreliability when we perceive a disparity between the (de- termining) intentions of the implied author concerning what is true in the story and the (reporting) intentions of the narrator concern- ing what she would have the reader believe occurred.4 And because the implied author is authoritative, this amounts to recognizing a dis- parity between what is true in the story and the intentions of the narrator concerning what she would have the reader believe occurred. This view is expressed in a summarizing remark of Wayne Booth's: "I have called a narrator reli- able when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say, the implied author's norms), unreliable when he does not."5 That, roughly, is how it is in Ford's The Good Soldier, in Camus's The Fall, in Ishi- guro's The Remains of the Day, and in many other narratives we commonly describe as unre- liable. But what of those narratives which are intu- itively unreliable, but where the unreliability is not, or at least not obviously, attributable to a</page><page sequence="3">Currie Unreliability Refigured: Narrative in Literature and Film 21 narrator? In the literary case you might insist that there always is a narrator to blame for the unreliability, however unobvious her presence may be (and there are some notably unobvious narrators). This seems rather ad hoc; it is worth asking whether there is some more elegant so- lution to the difficulty. And with film, the idea of a hidden narrator such as would be postu- lated in order to save the Boothian definition of unreliability strains the bounds of coherence. It will take a moment to see why. II. THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN LITERATURE AND FILM I want now to introduce two further distinctions between kinds of narrators, and these distinc- tions will play an important role in the argu- ment that follows. (Remember: we are ignoring external narrators, and the distinctions I am now making are, for our purposes, distinctions within the class of internal narrators.) These new distinctions cut across one another. First, I draw a distinction between a foregrounded and a backgrounded narrator. A foregrounded nar- rator is one whose presence is signaled in the work itself, a backgrounded one is a narrator whose presence has to be inferred (I do not claim that there is a sharp boundary between these two kinds, but indeterminacy of boundary is, of course, no argument against their distinct- ness).6 The second distinction is one between controlling and noncontrolling narrators. Nar- rators are characters within the world of the fiction who are to be thought of as telling us facts, or lies, or deluded ravings-but not as telling us a fictional story.7 Narrators tell by making utterances, and we can speak of the text of that utterance, whether written or not. Now that text-the text of which it is fictional that it is uttered by the narrator-may coincide with the text we are reading when we read the work. In that case, we imagine the narrator to be con- trolling; he or she is the source of the text before us. We know, of course, that the text is fictional, and we probably know the identity of its real author, but we may think that it is part of the fiction itself that the narrator is the source of this text and accept the fiction's implicit or explicit invitation to imagine exactly that. In this sense, Watson is a controlling narrator of the Holmes stories and to some extent an unre- liable one in the sense of Booth.8 But some- times narrators are noncontrolling. That occurs when the narrator is embedded: when her own text is not the text we read but a text described or reported in the text we read (which may also describe the embedded narrator's telling of it).9 As I have said, our two distinctions cut across one another. That gives us four options: fore- grounded/controlling, foregrounded/noncontrol- ling, backgrounded/controlling, and backgrounded/ noncontrolling. But it will be seen that there is a difficulty in the last of these combinations. A backgrounded narrator is a shadowy figure whose characteristics are hard to identify in detail, and everything about her that can be inferred has to be inferred on the basis of very tenuous evidence-otherwise she would not count as backgrounded. In reasoning about the characteristics of such a narrator, as with other kinds of evidentially underfunded reasoning, we rely very heavily on default assumptions; if a decision has to be made about the possession of some characteristic and there is no evidence either way, we tend to favor the answer that is simpler or otherwise preferable on a priori grounds. And it is simpler to assume that a backgrounded narrator is controlling than that she is not; to suppose that she is not is to see her appearing as told about in the text, rather than as the source of the text itself. But if she is told about in the text, there ought to be some evi- dence in the text for her existence, which, by assumption of her backgroundedness, there is not. In that case, backgrounded narrators are almost bound to be controlling-it being rela- tively unproblematic that the agent responsible for a text might not signal her presence within the text itself. And I certainly am not aware of any actual cases of works where we could point with any conviction to a backgrounded but non- controlling narrator. Now there is something awkward-indeed, something close to incoherence-about the idea of a controlling narrator in film. With literature it is often natural to imagine that what one is reading is a true account of certain events wit- nessed or otherwise known about by someone, who then went to the trouble of setting it all down for us in writing; some of John Buchan's adventure stories, we are to imagine, are the product of a careful editor who has heard from the parties concerned and has created a judi-</page><page sequence="4">22 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism cious account on paper from their reports; it is that account, we imagine, that we are now read- ing, and its imagined author counts as a control- ling narrator. But what are we to imagine that would be analogous to this in the filmic case- that the person in the know has gone to the trouble of recreating it all for us on camera, spending millions of dollars, employing famous actors and a vast army of technicians? That seems implausible, especially in cases where the narrator, if there is one, would most natu- rally be thought of as living in the pre-cine- matic age. The same argument tells against the hypothesis that the narrator is a documentary filmmaker who went to the trouble of recording the events of which he has knowledge on film at the time; it would also seem to leave no room for narrative unreliability, which is after all what we are trying to account for.10 But if con- trolling narrators in film are ruled out, and backgrounded narrators are almost inevitably controlling, we may conclude that backgrounded narrators in film are very rare, if possible at all.1" In that case, it will not do simply to insist on their presence whenever we encounter a film narrative that is unreliable but where there is no foregrounded narrator. Better to say simply that in such a case we have unreliable narrative without a narrator.12 Perhaps the argument just given merely shows that the only unreliable film narratives there can be are those which involve noncontrolling, and therefore probably foregrounded narrators as with Rashomon, Stage Fright, and most of the other filmic narrations we think of as unre- liable. The trouble with that conclusion is that there seems to be a counterexample to it. At any rate, George Wilson claims to have found one: Fritz Lang's You Only Live Once.13 Wilson argues that the natural interpretation of the film, according to which the young man Eddie is innocent of the crime for which he is due to be executed, is on closer examination not sup- ported by, and is in fact at certain crucial points undermined by, the film's narration and its studiedly selective presentation of events. On Wilson's view, a right interpretation of the film would have us withhold judgment as to Eddie's guilt or innocence. But that is certainly not what most viewers of the film have done; gener- ations of critics and lay viewers have accepted the view that Eddie is an innocent victim.14 Notably, there is no foregrounded narrator in the film, and no evidence, so far as I can see, for the existence of that very rare bird, the backgrounded, noncontrolling narrator either. In that case we seem bound to conclude that we have unreliable narrative without a narrator.15 I should say that I am not entirely convinced by Wilson's interpretation, and it seems to me that some of the evidence that Wilson cites in support of it-in particular a crucial shot inside the getaway car-does not in fact support it. But Wilson's interpretation does mesh very finely with certain parts of the film which are otherwise hard to understand. And if Wilson's interpretation does not apply in all detail to Lang's film, it is not difficult to imagine a film, different from Lang's in minor ways, to which it does. So we may conclude that it is possible for there to be unreliable narration in film where no foregrounded narrator is present-and when it comes to definitions, possible counterexam- ples are as telling as actual ones. In that case we really will have to look for another definition of narrative unreliability. Anyway, I shall assume, for the sake of the argument, that Wilson is right. How might narrative unreliability occur other than as a result of a disparity between the view- points of the narrator and the implied author? It can occur, I claim, as a result of there being a certain kind of complex intention on the part of the implied author. I shall explain. An agent can do something with an intention of the following complex kind: she creates or presents some- thing which she intends will be taken as evi- dence of her intentions, and she intends that superficial evidence will suggest that her inten- tion was X, whereas a better, more reflective grasp of the evidence will suggest that her in- tention was Y. Trivial example: Frieda compli- ments Fred on his sophisticated sense of humor. Her flattery is a little disturbing; this is not the Frieda we know. But now we see: it was all ironic and intended to be recognized, ulti- mately, as more of the abuse she usually heaps upon Fred. Frieda's performance was unreli- able, and there may be people, Fred among them, who didn't get to the second stage, be- cause that took just a little more calculating than some of us can be relied on to make. That seems to be what is going on in You Only Live Once; we take the images and sounds that go to make up the film as intended one</page><page sequence="5">Currie Unreliability Refigured: Narrative in Literature and Film 23 way. But if we are scrupulous in our examina- tion of those images, we find peculiarities, in- congruities, and apparently unmotivated ele- ments that start to fall into place when we see that it can be interpreted in another. Their fall- ing into place consists in their being seen as intended to suggest that second, less obvious interpretation. Narratives which are the product (or which seem to be the product-remember that it is the implied author who concerns us here) of this kind of two-tier system of inten- tions constitute a distinctive and especially challenging class of narratives, and I do not think that they are very well understood. I hope to change that somewhat in the rest of this paper. Before I begin, a methodological remark. In appealing to the notion of an implied au- thor here I leave behind those intentional real- ists who insist that the work must be interpreted in the light of the real author's intentions- where those intentions are to be understood as "embodied" or "made effective" in the text. While there seem to me to be great difficulties in the realist's position, the present focus of our attention need not be the occasion for a dispute between us.16 The realist may take over my def- inition of unreliability and say that it applies in those cases where a complex intention of the kind I have described is possessed by the real author and is embodied in the text by her sto- rytelling actions. III. WHICH DEFINITION? Defining unreliable narrative in terms of com- plex intentions attributable to an implied author allows us to count a narrative as unreliable even when there is no narrator who we can identify as the source of unreliability. What, then, are the relations between this kind of unreliability and the cases that are covered by Booth's narra- tor-centered definition? Certainly, some of the cases that are unreliable on Booth's definition would not be unreliable on mine. In Lardner's "Haircut," for example, we have an internal narrator whose outlook (his "norms" as Booth puts it) is different from, and undermined by, that of the implied author. But this is not a case, I believe, where we would attribute a complex intention to the implied author. The disparity of outlooks is too obvious in this case for us to be warranted in concluding that the implied author has intentions that can be grasped only on a significantly deeper level of reflection. The warranted conclusion is surely that the implied author intends us to see, straight off, the moral idiocy of the narrator. That is not to say that the extensions of Booth's definitions and mine are disjoint, for it is possible for a work to satisfy both of them. In such a work there is a disparity of outlooks between the implied author and the internal narrator, but the disparity is not obvious, and it is only on deeper reflection that we realize that it was intended that we find the narrator unreli- able.17 Then we have an instance of our com- plex intention.18 So there is overlap, but not sameness, for the extensions of these concepts- mine was introduced, after all, to cover cases that Booth's does not cover-and so the defini- tions characterize different concepts. But I am afraid I shall not be able to endorse the comfortably ecumenical position that these definitions are merely different: different but equal. I believe that my characterization of unre- liability in terms of a complex intention-call it unreliability2-is of greater theoretical and criti- cal interest than the familiar Boothian charac- terization in terms of a disparity of outlook between the narrator and the implied author- call it unreliability1. There are of course inter- esting cases of unreliability1, but they tend also to be cases of unreliability2; they tend to be cases where the narrator's unreliability is to some degree unobvious. We are past the point where a narrator's unreliability is intrinsically interesting, because we are past the point where we bring to the work a strong presumption that narrators will be reliable. Without that pre- sumption, narratorial unreliability is, of itself, no more significant than the mendacity of a dramatic speaker: no more significant, that is, from the point of view of a theory of narrative. But unreliability that is to some degree hidden is of theoretical interest because its operation depends on delicately balanced inferential strat- egies that the reader must undertake. For the rest of this essay I want to concentrate on unre- liability2, and on the structure of our inferences to it. For reasons to do with the structure of those inferences, unreliability2 is less frequently en- countered than its Boothian rival. To see why will require the introduction of another kind of narrative that I want to call ambiguous.</page><page sequence="6">24 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism IV. AMBIGUITY AND UNRELIABILITY An ambiguous narrative is one which does not enable us to answer all the significant questions which arise concerning the story. Significance is an important condition here, since no narra- tion can possibly provide complete information about the characters and events it describes. When is a question significant? One answer is this: when it is a question that members of the audience are (normally) inclined to ask con- cerning that narrative. But this will not do. Sometimes there are questions we as audience are inclined to ask at the end of the work and which the work does not answer, but which would not be grounds for calling it ambiguous. Many people are inclined to wonder what will happen to Rhett and Scarlet at the end of Gone with the Wind (as the recent and long-awaited sequel indicates). But this would not be grounds for saying that the narrative (either the book or the film) is ambiguous in the sense I am inter- ested in here. Questions about the continuation or noncontinuation of relationships are ones we are almost always inclined to ask-at least they arise fleetingly in our minds-at the end of the work. This proposal is going to make too many narratives ambiguous. A proposal with a similar defect has it that the narrative is ambiguous if it is a narrative that leads us to expect an answer to a question when in fact it does not provide an answer; though this would at least explain the intuition that Gone with the Wind is not ambiguous, since that narrative does not lead us to expect that an answer will be given to the question "What happens to them after the narrative breaks off?" But this proposal is neither necessary nor suffi- cient for ambiguity: the narrative might make it clear right from the start that a certain question is not going to be answered (in the case of a film that might require a voice-over to be con- vincing). So we are not led to expect an answer, and indeed the question may not be answered by the narrative, yet the question may be one such that, in not answering it, the narrative takes on the intuitive character of ambiguity. So satisfaction of the proposed criterion is not nec- essary for ambiguity. And a question may arise to which we expect an answer, but where we put down failure to provide an answer to incom- petence in the construction of the narrative. In that case we would be doing the work a favor it does not deserve by calling it ambiguous. But the case of narrative incompetence is the clue to solving our problem. When a question arises which is not answered in the narrative, but where we ascribe the nonanswer to incompe- tence, we do not think that a question has been deliberately raised by the implied author, and deliberately left unanswered; we think, exactly, that either the raising or the failure to answer were due to some oversight or other failure of execution. So I propose the following as the cri- terion of when a narration is ambiguous: when it raises a question in the viewer's mind which it fails to answer, and where the raising and the nonanswering seem to have been intentional. This proposal gives the result that Gone with the Wind is not ambiguous; while readers and viewers may wonder about the future of Rhett and Scarlet, and the makers may have expected that they would wonder about it, and while all this may be common knowledge between audi- ence and maker, the question does not seem to be intentionally raised and intentionally left un- answered by the narrative.19 It is easy at the level of theory to see the differences between unreliable and ambiguous narratives. But it is not always easy to say which kind a particular work belongs to. Is Rashomon an ambiguous or an unreliable nar- ration? If there figure within it embedded nar- rators who are unreliable, we may grant that it is unreliable in the sense of Booth (unreliabil- ity1). It would be ambiguous if it left it an open question which of the conflicting accounts is true. But is it unreliable in the sense that I defined above (unreliability2), viz., that it is possible to detect in its making the influence of a complex intention of the kind I have described in connection with You Only Live Once? That would be so if we thought of Rashomon this way: as intended, first, to suggest to us that the problem is to decide which account is true, and second. to suggest on deeper reflection the rela- tivity of truth and, in consequence, the falsity of our first question's presupposition, that there is a right answer. For some of us, the easy relativ- ism of the last option is too banal to be a plaus- ible candidate for interpretation, but this may be just an indication that there is sometimes no neutral perspective from which to choose be- tween ambiguity and unreliability, a situation</page><page sequence="7">Currie Unreliability Refigured: Narrative in Literature and Film 25 we sometimes experience with other interpre- tive choices.20 But while ambiguity and unreliability are distinct interpretive options, they are compati- ble, not merely in the sense that there is some- times no principled choice between them, but in the stronger sense that a single interpretation of the work may require the application of both. We might, for instance, take Rashomon as unre- liable2 in this way: that at first glance the options are between the explicit accounts of the various narrators, while on reflection we see that there is another option-the relativistic one-and that the story is ambiguous between those collected at the first round and this one. (I would count that as only marginally less banal than straightforwardly opting for relativism, but it might still be the best thing we can come up with.) On that view, Rashomon is both am- biguous and unreliable2. Note that You Only Live Once is, on Wilson's account, both ambiguous and unreliable2. At first the question: "Is Eddie guilty of murder?" seems to be answered by the narrative. But we see, on closer inspection, that it is left open by it. In that case might there be some internal connection between unreliability2 and ambi- guity? I believe there is, though the connection is not a straightforward logical one. It is not that unreliability2 necessitates ambiguity; rather, un- reliability2 is an easier effect to achieve when it goes with ambiguity than when it does not. The reason is this: it is easier to persuade the reader or viewer that a question has been answered when it has not than it is to persuade her that a question has been answered one way when in fact it has been answered in another. The task of the author of an unreliable2 narration is a difficult one. It is to set clues at two levels: at level one where the clues are more obvious but only superficially persuasive, and at level two where they are less obvious but more weighty when reflected upon. But the degree of diffi- culty of the task varies from case to case, and one determinant of its degree of difficulty is what we might call the epistemic distance be- tween the two levels; increase the distance and you increase the difficulty. By "distance" I mean the disparity between what you want to convey as a first impression and what you want the audi- ence to catch on to on further reflection. The greater the distance in this sense, the greater the subtlety and complexity of the reasoning that the audience will have to go through to cover the gap, and the less likely it is that they will suc- ceed. And trying to raise the probability of suc- cess in such a case by reinforcing the clues at level two may simply undermine the whole proj- ect by making the inference to level two more obvious and natural than that to level one. It will generally be the case that there is a greater distance, in this sense, between the two levels if at one level we are given, say, a yes answer, and at the other a no answer, than there will be if at one level we are given an answer (yes or no) and at the other we are told that no answer is forthcoming. In the first case one has to persuade the audience to abandon a position and adopt the opposite one; in the second one has merely to do the first of those two things. So the second is an easier thing to do than the first. And if Wilson is right, the second of these two things is what Lang (or his implied surro- gate) seeks to do with You Only Live Once. Ambiguity is also probably the best thing that advocates of the delusional interpretation of The Turn of the Screw can hope for. Reflection doesn't show that there are no ghosts; at best it shows that another hypothesis does about as well as the supernatural one when it comes to explaining the text. When an unreliable narrative is one that seems, superficially, to close a certain issue but reveals on reflection that the question is left open, as in You Only Live Once, let us say that we have a "transition to openness." Consider a transition in the opposite direction-a "transi- tion to closure"-where the narrative seems, superficially, to leave a certain issue open but is seen on reflection to answer the question one way or another. Would a transition to closure be easier or more difficult to effect than a transi- tion to openness? Taking into account only what I have called epistemic distance suggests that it would be neither more nor less difficult, since distance is symmetrical-the distance be- tween two things is independent of the order in which they are taken. However, I think there are grounds for saying that it would, other things being equal, be more difficult to effect a transition to closure than a transition to open- ness. The problem, in creating an unreliable narration, is to suggest one hypothesis by means of more obvious but ultimately less convincing</page><page sequence="8">26 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism evidence, and to suggest another by means of less obvious but more convincing evidence. The difficulty is to ensure that the more convincing evidence will in fact be less obvious, without having it disappear entirely from view. And that difficulty will be the greater, the stronger the hypothesis that it is evidence for. After all, it takes more evidence to get us to believe a strong conclusion than a weak one. It's not hard to convince me that either Oswald shot Kennedy or someone else did; it's much harder to con- vince me that someone else did. So, other things being equal, one will have to provide stronger evidence to support a definite conclusion than to support a mere ambiguity. But then the transition to closure requires stronger evidence at the level of the less obvious, and that kind of transition is going to be more difficult to effect than is a transition to openness. On that assumption, we would expect to find transitions to openness more frequently in literature and other narrative forms than transitions to closure. And that, I believe, is exactly what we do find.21 V. IMPLIED AUTHOR AND NARRATOR I have been arguing that narrative unreliability in literature and film can occur in the absence of a narrator, but not in the absence of an implied author. There are two kinds of theories that clash with that idea: theories that deny the necessity of an implied author, and theories that assert the necessity of a narrator. Such theories have been advocated by, respectively, David Bordwell and Seymour Chatman. David Bordwell has argued that in film we have narration without a "sender." Part of the way I can agree with him. He argues, as I have argued, that narrators in film must be embed- ded: they are "invariably swallowed up in the overall narrational process of the film, which they do not produce."22 But I have argued that while narrators are optional elements in film (and noncontrolling when present), the implied author is not dispensable, that the interpretation of film is crucially dependent on our seeing the images and other elements of the film as the products of intention. Here we disagree: ... literary theory may be justified in looking for a speaking voice or narrator. But in watching films we are seldom aware of being told something by an entity resembling a human being. As for the implied author, this construction adds nothing to our under- standing of filmic narration. No trait we could assign to an implied author of a film could not more simply be ascribed to the narration itself: it sometimes sup- presses information, it often restricts our knowledge, it generates curiosity, it creates a tone, and so on. To give every film a narrator or implied author is to indulge in an anthropomorphic fiction ... . [Filmic] narration is better understood as the organization of a set of cues for the construction of a story. This presup- poses a perceiver, but not any sender, of a message.23 Bordwell may be right to say that when watch- ing a film, we are seldom aware of being told something by a human being. But that is no argument against the dependence of interpreta- tion on the idea of an intentional agent as sender. The mechanisms whereby we arrive at the in- terpretation of films and other works are no more likely to be continually present to con- sciousness in their operation than are the mech- anisms of, say, arithmetical calculation. And it is unclear how some of the functions that Bord- well assigns to narration could be accounted for outside the scope of assumptions we make about a sender; he speaks, for instance, of a narration which "suppresses information." Without re- course to the idea of intention, you can speak of a system that fails to deliver all the information you want, but not of a system that suppresses information. And, of course, the idea of suppres- sion (rather than just of informational incom- pleteness) is essential to an adequate description of filmic narration and our reaction to it; we feel, in some cases, that we are being deliber- ately deprived of information (as when we see only the hands of the murderer), that we are being deprived of it for some dramatic or emo- tional purpose, that our expectations are being played with. None of this would make sense unless we understood the narration as some- thing communicated to us by someone.24 In particular, unreliable narratives of the kind exemplified in You Only Live Once depend, for their interpretation, on our perception of a cer- tain kind of complex intention on the implied maker's part. But while it is an error to dispense with the notion of an intelligence that communicates the story to us, we must not confuse the need for such an intelligence with the requirement that</page><page sequence="9">Currie Unreliability Refigured: Narrative in Literature and Film 27 every story have a narrator. Seymour Chatman tells us that the idea that stories, or some of them, might not be communicated by a narrator leads to a conclusion that "contradicts both logic and common sense"-"that narratives just appear unannounced."25 We can agree that no narrative "just appears"; the question is whether its appearance requires a narrator rather than simply an implied author. Chatman, who distinguishes narrators from authors, both real and implied, thinks it does: the narrator is 'someone or something in the text who or which is conceived of as presenting (or trans- mitting) the set of signs that constitutes it." But there is certainly no violation of logic, and probably none of common sense, when we deny that every text contains such a being. The implied author is responsible for the story, what she intends to be true in the story is true in it, and the text she writes (or the film she makes) is our guide to what she does intend. She may intend it to be true in that story that someone other than her is telling it, perhaps as known fact. In that case we have a narrator. But she may not intend this; she may simply intend to tell a tale in which it is fictional that this and that occurred, but not fictional that anyone is telling that it occurred. (Of course she herself tells the story, but her doing so does not make it fictional that she, or anyone, does so.) Where in all this are there violations of logic and com- mon sense? While the view Chatman rejects is unprob- lematic, his own theory faces problems of a kind to which our discussion has rendered us sensitive. "Only the narrator can be unreli- able," he tells us, and the duplicitous flashback in Stage Fright is the product of the charac- ter Johnny who "is 'responsible' for the lying images and sounds that we see and hear."26 But Johnny, like the other characters, exists within the story, and it is no part of that story that he produced and edited cinematic images in order to convince his fictional fellows (and us?) of his innocence-anyway a transparently self- defeating enterprise. (Chatman's scare-quotes indicate an unease about this notion of respon- sibility, but they do nothing to solve the prob- lem.) Rather, the deceptive images and their juxtaposition must be thought of as representa- tions of Johnny's account, though we begin by taking them also to be representations of what is real within the fiction itself. They are thus attributable to the film's implied maker. What Chatman would have the narrator do can be done by the implied maker, at considerably lower cost to common sense and its educated cousin, theory. VI. CONCLUSION I have suggested that there are cases-certainly possible and possibly actual-of a kind of nar- rative unreliability not covered by the standard account. I have given a general characterization of this kind, and suggested how it might super- sede the more familiar, Boothian, kind of unre- liability. I also described what I call ambiguous narrative, and suggested that there is a close connection between this and the kind of unreli- able narrative I defined-a connection forged by the difficulty readers face in making the in- ferences to the implied author's intentions that are necessary if unreliability is to be detected. I have argued, finally, that unreliability in narra- tive makes no sense without appeal to the con- cept of an implied author, but that the concept of a narrator is required only by one kind of unreliability. The implied author, we may say, is an absolute presupposition of unreliability, the narrator a merely conditional one.27 GREGORY CURRIE Department of Philosophy Flinders University Adelaide Australia INTERNET: PLGPC@GAMGEE.CC.FLINDERS.EDU.AU 1. My terminology only partly coincides with that of other writers on narrative, and some of the deviations are noted and discussed in these notes. Sometimes I find their terminology inappropriate; sometimes I find that their ter- minology marks distinctions in the wrong places. Anyway, there is not much uniformity of usage evident in writing on narrative. 2. If commitment to them is nothing more than a com- mitment to sets of propositions, I believe in them myself. 3. So the implied author, as I use that notion, is always "extradiegetic" in Genette's sense (Gerard Genette, Narra- tive Discourse, English translation [Oxford: Blackwell, 1972]). See text immediately below. 4. So narrator and implied author occupy quite distinct functional roles, and we should not attribute properties of the one to the other. Narrators may be (but need not be)</page><page sequence="10">28 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism omniscient, but implied authors never are; their perspective on the story is not one of knowledge but of determining choice. 5. Wayne Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction, 2nd ed. (New York: Viking Books, 1983), pp. 158-159, emphasis in the original, and in the first edition thereof, 1961. One mislead- ing feature of this remark is the implication that narrative unreliability is always and exclusively a matter of value (Booth's "norms"), which is certainly not the case, as many of Booth's examples attest. Booth's definition is taken over, more or less, by Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse (Cornell University Press, 1978), p. 233, and is repeated in Gerald Prince, A Dictionary of Narratology (University of Nebraska Press, 1987), p. 101. 6. Foregrounding a narrator may not require an explicit statement in the text of the work that there is such a narrator, though that is certainly one way to achieve foregrounding. There are various ways that stop short of explicit statement in which texts make features of the stories they tell obvious. 7. This, of course, is a simplification, since there are stories within stories where a narrator internal at one level is external at another; in these stories it is fictional that the narrator is telling us that it is fictional that ... Inclusion of such cases into our present taxonomy would further compli- cate an already complex structure, and ignoring them will not affect the argument. 8. F. K. Stanzel supposes that all "first-person" narrators (in my terms: internal narrators) are necessarily unreliable, because of the limitations on their knowledge (A Theory of Narrative, trans. Charlotte Goedsche [Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1984], p. 89). But failure to be omniscient is one thing and failure to be reliable another. Perhaps the thought here is that a non-omniscient narrator could not be certain of the truth of any of his beliefs. But it is an error of the Cartesian tradition to suppose that lack of certainty translates into unreliability. 9. The term "embedded narrator" is sometimes used to refer to any character-narrator. This strikes me as mislead- ing usage; a character-narrator who is controlling in my sense is not necessarily embedded in the story. He tells the story, but he does not tell of his own telling. See, e.g., Wallace Martin, Recent Theories of Narrative (Cornell Uni- versity Press, 1986), p. 135. 10. Chatman, I think, sees the difficulty here. See his discussion of the famous "lying flashback" in Hitchcock's Stage Fright in Story and Discourse, p. 237. But in more recent writings Chatman describes this case in much more problematic terms; see below, text to note 26. 11. I think I agree with Christian Metz here: "the explicit enunciators in the film are always embedded," "The Im- personal Enunciation, or the Site of Film," New Literary History 22 (1991): 747-772, (p. 768). 12. A referee suggested that there is another argument against narrators in film: narrators must be utterers, and the audio-visual representation of film is not utterance. But we Griceans have no problem taking "utterance" in a broad sense that includes, for example, showing people pictures and making gestures. Filmic narrative is just utterance of a complex kind. 13. George M. Wilson, Narration in Light (Johns Hop- kins University Press, 1986). 14. Recently shown here on a local TV station, Lang's film was advertised with a quotation from William Farr: "a damning indictment of the injustice, prejudice and brutality that can be directed, in the name of justice, against an ex- criminal." 15. Perhaps you think it analytic that narrative must have a narrator (as does Sarah Kozloff: "Because narrative films are narrative, someone must be narrating," Invisible Sto- rytellers: Voice-Over in American Fiction Film [University of California Press, 1988], p. 115, quoted approvingly in Seymour Chatman, Coming to Terms [Cornell University Press, 1990], p. 133). But then you simply object to my terminology, and I could avoid the objection by using another term to refer to the vehicle of narratorless storytell- ing. Consider it done. 16. See my "Interpretation and Objectivity," Mind 102 (1993): 413-428. 17. In that case we have a "seductive" unreliable narra- tor; the classic case is The Turn of the Screw. Where Booth's definition applies and mine does not, we have an unseduc- tive one (see James Phelan, "Narrative Discourse, Literary Character and Ideology," in James Phelan, ed., Reading Narrative [Ohio State University Press, 1989], p. 137). Sometimes cases of unobviously unreliable narratives are described as "ambiguous" (e.g., by Shlomith Rimmon- Kenan, Narrative Fiction [London: Methuen, 1983], p. 103), but I wish to use this term for another purpose. See below, Section IV 18. We should not forget that all unreliability must ulti- mately be traceable to the intentions of the implied author; we see the narrator as unreliable because we think that words have been put into her mouth by the implied author so as to signal the narrator's unreliability. 19. There may be other grounds for saying that Gone with the Wind is ambiguous in the sense favored here. The film narratives used by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson to illustrate ambiguity (Day of Wrath and Last Year at Marianbad) would count as ambiguous on my defi- nition. Bordwell and Thompson associate ambiguity closely with causality (Film Art [Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley, 1980], p. 250). Their idea seems to be that the work is ambiguous to the extent that the causes or effects of narrative elements are unclear. Since most narrative events, like most events in real life, have many distinct partial causes and many distinct effects, we shall need to distin- guish the significant from the non-significant causes and effects. My proposal above can be read as doing that. 20. See my "Interpretation and Objectivity." An interest- ing case of the relation between unreliability and ambiguity is Jack Clayton's The Innocents, a film version of The Turn of the Screw. One difficulty the filmmakers had to contend with was that a significant proportion of the film's audience would bring with them their knowledge of the unreliability in James's story, which would make it virtually impossible for the film to achieve the same effect; the audience would be primed for the discovery of the higher level clues from the start. As I understand the film, their solution, intel- ligently enough, was to give the film an ambiguous rather than an unreliable narrative. 21. George Wilson argues that Ford's The Searchers employs what I have called a transition to closure (Narra- tion in Light, pp. 46 ff.). But I find Wilson less persuasive on this than on You Only Live Once.
