<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN S. ALLEN University of Southern California As Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mittman point out in their introduction to this excellent volume, many scholars linked the rise of modern science beginning in the 19th century to a decline in the use of anthropomorphism to explain phenomena in the natural world. Anthropomorphism was seen to be representative of "sloppy thinking... almost syn? onymous with anecdote and sloth and opposed to scientific rigor and care" (p. 3). A legacy of this view of anthropomor? phism is that it has long been regarded with a profound sense of "intellectual and ethical ambivalence." Times change. Although anthropomorphism is a con? cept that carries the stigmata of past intellectual attacks? as several contributors to the volume acknowledge?it is today much more acceptable to embrace anthropomor? phism as a legitimate area of study, and more controver- sially, as a tool for understanding the behavior of other animals. There are several reasons for this change. First, over the past two decades, there has been an explosion in scholarship concerned with human-animal relations and the moral underpinnings of our relationships with other animals. To even address some of these issues is to tran- scend the anthropomorphic barrier that earlier scholars so carefully constructed. Second, whereas in the past com? parative psychologists and ethologists rejected anthropo? morphic thinking as fundamentally misleading, it is now increasingly acknowledged that to dismiss real continuities between ourselves and other animals, especially primates,</page><page sequence="2">Single Reviews 577 is to risk "anthropodenial" (Frans de Waal's phrase arises in several chapters), a practice that can be just as damaging as facile anthropomorphism. Finally, in contemporary media- driven cultures, anthropomorphic images are pervasive, in? dicating the power of anthropomorphism to communicate a wide range of messages. "Thinking with animals" arises in a wide variety of cultural contexts; as Daston and Mittman observe, it is "eminently useful" although its utility varies according to time and place. Thinking with Animals is composed of an introduction and nine succinct, tightly focused chapters. One of the most illuminating is Lorraine Daston's chapter, entitled "Intelli- gences: Angelic, Animal, Human," which provides a com? parison of the anthropomorphic underpinnings of the pre- modern, scholastic contemplation of the minds of angels with the efforts of early evolutionary comparative psychol? ogists to understand the minds of animals. Although there were obviously differences in the goals and outlooks of these two groups of intellectuals, they shared the analog- ical method and the belief that humans occupied a specific place in a graduated hierarchy of being. As Daston states: "They practiced anthropomorphism with a kind of desper- ation, aware of its risks and limits yet convinced that there was no other way to play the game" (p. 51). She argues that contemporary scientists and scholars, attempting to under? stand the minds of other animals or those of members of past cultures, face a similar dilemma. True (and subjective) understanding of the minds of others requires empathy and sympathy, the hallmarks of anthropomorphic thinking. But if anthropomorphism is intellectually suspect, how can we ever hope to understand other minds? Daston suggests that "if we could reformulate questions about understanding other minds in some other mode than 'What is it like to be an X?' we might partly redeem... the pleasures of an? thropomorphism" (p. 54). Issues of anthropomorphism in evolutionary biology are addressed in chapters by Elliot Sober and Sandra Mitchell. Sober recounts how scientists have come to be highly concerned with avoiding "Type I errors" derived from anthropomorphic thinking (i.e., mistakenly attribut- ing a human characteristic to an animal), while at the same time exhibiting little concern about the possibility of "Type II errors" (i.e., mistakenly denying that an animal possesses a human characteristic). Sober goes on to explore the use of cladistic methodology as a way to avoid making either kind of error. Mitchell assesses the place of anthropomor? phism in cross-species modeling of behavior. She finds that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using anthropo? morphic models: "In short, anthropomorphic models are specific, scientifically accessible claims of similarity between humans and nonhumans. As such they must be substanti- ated by evidence that there are similar causal mechanisms responsible for generating the apparently similar behav- iors that are observed" (p. 114). In the view of these (rel? atively) hard scientists, anthropomorphism is just another intellectual platform from which testable hypotheses can be generated. Thinking with Animals is a thought-provoking and highly readable volume. Given the potentially vast range of its subject matter, it is easy to pick areas that one wishes were covered but were not (e.g., cognitive or linguistic analyses of anthropomorphism), but that is a minor quibble. Although there is not space enough here to review each of them separately, the historical chapters and those concerned with visual imagery and anthropomorphism are also all worthwhile. Thinking with Animals is certainly appropriate for use in undergraduate teaching: Although the undergraduate mind is not always accessible to us, this exegesis of anthropomorphism can provide the basis for discussion of a host of fundamental anthropological issues.
