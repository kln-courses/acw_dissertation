In this work the author has undertaken, with due caution,' to re- construct the lost original version of a medieval poetic text, a task whose results are notoriously subject to controversy; and before judgment is passed upon the reconstruction, account must be taken of the premises adopted therefor. In the Introduction, Alarcos Llorach seeks solutions to five unsettled issues: the date of composition, the dialect of the lost original, the identity of the author, the filiation of manuscripts, and the system of prosody em- ployed by the author. He holds with general, and in all probability correct, opinion in ascribing the Libro de Alexandre to the first half of the thirteenth century. In his discussion, however, he draws an erroneous inference when he says: "Pero iltimamente Willis retrocede la fecha de ejecuci6n del poema probablemente a los afios 1201-1202 (p. 16)" Quite the contrary, as he brings out in a footnote written after the completion of his text (p. 16, n. 15), the date was merely adduced as the arithmetic remainder in a computation based on figures that are found in only one manuscript and were qualified as highly suspect, and moreover as a probability which was invalidated by the weight of other evidence.2 In point of fact, the reviewer believes that the poem was most probably composed in the second quarter of the century, among many other reasons because it is imbued with an attitude towards the figure of the King which reached its plenitude only in the course of the reign of Fernando III, and which is, for example, reflected shortly after in the Setenario. Unlike the epic juglares, or Berceo, the Alexander poet con- ceived of the monarch ideally as the embodiment, not merely of esfuerzo, justicia, and franqueza, but also of courtliness, erudition, and even saintliness.3 1 Alarcos Llorach says in his Nota preliminar" "No pretendemos haber acertado siempre en nuestra critica textual . . . Pero hemos procurado ser caute- losos en todas las correcciones que hemos propuesto al texto." 2 R. S. Willis, Jr., The Relationship of the Spanish Libro de Alexandre to the Alexandreis of Gautier de ChAtillon (Elliott Monographs, 31), Princeton-Paris, 1934, p. 74- "This date is, however, nearly half a century earlie- than is generally accepted for the Alexandre, and is obtained from a number whose accuracy is questionable." By faith, Alexander removes mountains- "Quando ovo el rey la oracion conplida, / mager era pagano fuele de Dios oyda, / mouieronse las pefias cada 168</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 169 The conclusions reached on the questions of the dialect, the manu- script filiation, and even the provenance of the author, hinge in part on assumptions regarding the system of rhyme and meter. Alarcos Llorach's argumentation is thus to some extent aprioristic; but it is cautious, logical, and firmly grounded on evidence as well as authority; and in the opinion of the reviewer the conclusions are in the main justified. The conclusion, based on textual analysis, that the original dialect was Castilian rather than either Aragonese or Leonese4 becomes all the more reasonable when we consider that the language of the royal chan- cellery of Castile-Leon would be indicated for a work on a supranational theme couched in a poetic mould that made pretensions to universal qualities. The preferred manuscript, P, is beyond doubt the superior in fidelity to the lost original text. Very wisely, Alarcos Llorach refuses to accept either Berceo or the Leonese Juan Lorenzo de Astorga as the author. Discussing the author's birthplace, he argues to support his interpretation of the linguistic evi- dence that, after mention of the Tagus, Duero, and Ebro rivers in stanza 2586, the designation of Cogolla and Moncayo as two of the cinco seiiales of Spain would hardly have occured to anyone not familiar at first hand with the region between Burgos and Soria. Very possibly the author was a native of that region, for the linguistic evidence points this way; but the geographic argument is oversimple, for it must not be overlooked that there is at least a suspicion of Franciscan imagery in the phrase cinco sefiales, and that there are heraldic or emblematic overtones to the passage as well (compare the escutcheon of Portugal). Perhaps the poet simply selected in approximately the center of Christian Spain an umbel or hub from which the three great rivers could be pictured as radiating, with but partial regard for the actual hydrography of the peninsula." For' this purpose Cogolla, associated with San Millhn, and Moncayo, the towering peak of the first important mountain mass south of the French border, could scarcely fail to be known outside the immediate environs. It is also debatable whether the poet was as incompetent a Latinist as Alarcos Llorach would have it (pp. 55-56). Rather it would seem that his knowledge of Greek geography was, understandably, at fault when he interpreted as personal names such terms as Rodius, Eubeus, Duliquius, and Boetas, which latter was probably present in the Latin source text una de su partida, / soldaronse en medio, fue presa la salida" (stanza 2114); and after death he is proclaimed worthy of receiving the veneration of pilgrims: "Sy non fuese pagano de vida tan seglar, / deuielo yr el mundo todo a adorar" (stanza 2667 cd). 4P. 46: "Creemos, pues, que su lengua original era el dialecto castellano, aunque con algin arcaismo precastellano." 6 The poet was familiar with no less fanciful aspects of medieval cartography, witness his elucidation of T-O maps in stanzas 277-280, and his anthropomorphic interpretation of geography in stanzas 2508-2513.</page><page sequence="3">170 HISPANIC REVIEW: VOL. XIX, 1951 in the form Boetes. His highly accurate interpretation of the by no means simple text of Gautier de ChAtillon's Alexandreis is evidence of his competence as a Latinist. In the last chapter of his Introduction, Alarcos Llorach completes the logic of his bases for text reconstruction by arguing his views on the prosodic rules to which the poet adhered. If the premises are accepted, that the syllables were "counted" and the rhyme was consonantal, the conclusions reached are difficult to disprove, not to say convincing. He finds that the meter is strictly isosyllabic; hiatus of contiguous vowels is the rule between words; either hiatus or diphthongization may occur within words, according to circumstances; when reduction of syllables is required, resort is had to apocope, and even "on occasion" to elision and crasis, but not to synaloepha. The rhyme scheme admits assonance when the rhyme words offer excessive difficulty (pp. 72-76, 80). However, Alarcos Llorach, like many who have preceded him, fails to make a very necessary distinction: we are not concerned with ortho- graphy but with the scansion of the lines. In the particular case of the Alexandre, moreover, we are not dealing with a meticulously executed palace copy of a monarch's own composition, but with a text designed primarily to be heard by the many and to be viewed by the few, chiefly skilled readers of verse, it is to be presumed. The scribes were simply professional orthographers, not poets or reciters, and under the best conditions the most we should expect of them is orthographic regularity, something achieved in fact only in rare circumstances outside the court. It is not to be expected that the copyists would adjust the spelling to the exigencies of the meter. Consequently it would seem reasonable for the modern editor not to undertake an orthographic adjustment of the text to the scansion, but rather to adopt a standard orthography that is consistent with the textual and historical evidence and is readable today. On such a basis it would be unnecessary to print such forms as: que yo-1 mostrard 'l gato commo-s' deve assar (stanza 697d); and any verses difficult to scan at sight could be clarified metrically in the notes. In addition to the Introduction, the volume contains a very useful study of the passage that Alarcos Llorach has undertaken to edit: stanzas 321-773, which contain an account of the Trojan War. In addition to giving a convenient summary of the contents, a brief re- capitulation of what is known of the history of the Story of Troy in early Spanish literature, and a concise digest of previous studies of the sources of the Alexandre version, the editor cites parallels between the Spanish and the Latin text of Pindarus Thebanus showing the very probable debt of the former to the latter; and, before concluding, he offers with textual evidence, the tentative but persuasive hypothesis that the Suma de Historia Troyana of Leomarte derives in part directly from the Alexandre version. For constructing his text, the editor follows his preferred manuscript and turns to the other only in cases where "it better preserves the meter"</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 171 or "'more accurately reflects the sources" (p. 79). Apart from basic orthographical regularizations, which are justified in the preliminaries to the text, all editorial alterations are recorded and explained in abundant footnotes which enable the reader to reconstruct the manuscript readings and, in cases not covered by the principles enunciated, to check the grounds on which emendations have been made. These notes further furnish numerous parallels from the Pindarus Thebanus version which are useful in elucidating the Spanish text. The text itself is unencumbered and pleasant to read, and, granted the bases of reconstruction, which permit perhaps excessive adjustment of orthography to the meter, as has been mentioned, it must be pro- nounced almost unimpeachable in execution.6 The reviewer takes exception in principle, however, to a not incon- siderable number of editorial alterations, plainly labeled though they are, which are not imposed either by manuscript evidence or the testimony of the known sources. The extant manuscripts, however corrupt, are authentic versions of the poem which circulated at periods not too far distant from the date of composition; and the modern editor should be on his guard against intruding his own canons, which inevitably must to some degree be anachronistic. To illustrate: the transfer of stanzas 325-326 to a point ten stanzas farther along in the poem is not indicated by either the manuscript or the source evidence; and while it seems to improve the logical order of material, it nevertheless gives false evidence of how the medieval poet worked out a not too adroit way to intercalate 453 stanzas on the Trojan War into a narrative that was following a source on a different topic. In stanza 337b, the editorial division of the plural juglares (a form attested to by both manuscripts), while it lends itself to constructing a metrically correct verse, nevertheless creates a hemistich, the first of verse b, which is out of step with the march of the quatrain as well as dissonant with the spirit and expression of the times: Avi6 muchos concejos, muchas yentes balderas, juglar es todo '1 mundo, de diversas maneras; aun por mas buscar, yxi6n a las carreras, ca non podi6n dar cabo a vaziar las calderas. The omission of verse 538d from the text is hardly justified simply on the grounds that the meaning of a term therein is obscure (p. 143, note). The emendation of stanza 566d results in a wholly uncharacteristic treatment of the cesura: non seri6n, si por esso non fues', tan afollados. 6 In the course of comparing the edited text with the paleographic edition that served as a basis, only a few trivial errors were noted: Stanza 491c, "ocorri6" for "acorri6"; 533a, "maldito" for "maledito"; 567a, "Entr6 por la villa" for "Entr6 pora la villa"; 620a, "passa" for "passa" or possibly "passa"; 681a, "el" for "el"; 731a, "a passar" for "de passar."</page><page sequence="5">172 HISPANIC REVIEW: VOL. XIX, 1951 And, not to extend the list unduly, the addition of the preposition in the phrase d'otra guisa of stanza 725a is contrary to the evidence of stanza 748b, which authenticates otra guisa as an adverbial phrase without the preposition. In short, whenever the editor's opinion preponderates heavily over conclusions dictated by more objective evidence, it should find expression in the notes rather than the text. However, the features to which objections have been raised in no serious way detract from the value and utility of the text prepared by Alarcos Llorach. The extant manuscripts have transmitted the passage in the Alexandre on the Trojan War in wretched form, many verses, in- deed, being almost incomprehensible as they stand. Patiently and skilfully, the editor has sought to clarify the obscure readings, with particular success in the case of the proper names which abound in the passage and which have been atrociously mutilated by the scribes. As the result of editorial competence, we have for the first time a readable as well as a reliable text of a passage whose historical and literary interest is incontestable.
