<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THEORY OF THE MESOLITHIC IN EUROPEAN ARCHAEOLOGY STANLEY A. CZARNIK 1 University of Illinois at Chicago Circle THE NOTION of a remote and extended "Stone Age" in the history of man is certainly one of the first and most elementary ideas to come out of early archaeological activity in the Old World. The Stone Age concept emerged out of relatively deep and essentially undifferentiated human past in the early nineteenth century when C. J. Thom- sen arranged a collection of national antiquities at the Copenhagen Museum into a system of three stages: Stone, Bronze, and Iron (Daniel, 1962: pp. 46-49); and the idea has been with us ever since. Not quite as old, but very nearly as ele- mentary, is the internal division of the Stone Age into three sub-equal chronological stages, the Paleolithic, the Mesolithic, and the Neolithic. At present, practically all Europeanist archaeologists utilize this terminology in their writing; and, al- though originally intended for application to pre- metallic archaeological sequences in Europe alone, these terms now provide a broad conceptual framework into which much of Old World pre- history is fitted in one way or another. When scientific concepts reach the level of tacit acceptance and acquire such general usage, it fre- quently becomes appropriate ito backtrack and re-examine precisely what facets of reality the ideas we so habitually use really make reference to and how closely this corresponds to their popu- larly presumed function. As Wittgenstein (1922: sec. 6) has pointed out: ". . . the question 'Why do we use that word, that proposition?' constantly leads to valuable results." Quite naturally, such an inquiry is often little more than a contribution to the history of a particular science and a reflec- tion on the nature of iits origin and development. However, the aim here is to demonstrate that a review of the concept of the Mesolithic as it is used in European archaeology proves to be some- thing more. In this case, it is an example of how shifting scientific perspectives on one hand, and 1I am grateful to Robert Hall, James Phillips, and particularly Laura Bohannan for their enlightening and encouraging comments on an earlier version of this essay. Special thanks go to Candace Voda for typing the manu- script. the accumulation of raw data on the other, can quickly outdistance the inventory of conceptual tools and frameworks readily available to deal with them. What I want ;to show is the way in which the idea of the Mesolithic, however ade- quate at some past time, has very nearly outlived its original usefulness and has come ,to take a po- sition in scientific thought in which it may even be hindering theoretical advance. THE STONE AGE PARADIGM AND ITS ELABORATIONS Thomas Kuhn (1970; 1972) has developed a powerful tool for the analysis of the evolution of theoretical constructs in science; this is the para- digm. Essentially, a scientific paradigm is a conceptual system shared by a scientific commu- nity in terms of which nature is described, inter- preted, and investigated. In a sense, it is a kind of "world view" with an inherent structure pe- culiar to it that tends to highlight certain seg- ments of reality while de-emphasizing others; it is this structure that determines how a given paradigm will influence the scientist's conceptu- alization of nature. Now Kuhn emphasizes that the structure of a paradigm is rarely static and fixed; on the contrary, almost as soon as a para- digm has been accepted as a basic framework within which scientific thinking and research can materialize, it begins to undergo alteraition, i.e., adjustment in an effort to shape it into a pro- gressively more intimate conformity with reality. Kuhn (1970: p. 24) has somewhat irreverently termed this activity "mopping up": . . . scientists, given a paradigm, strive with all their might and skill to bring it into closer and closer agreement with nature. Much of their effort, par- ticularly in the early stages of a paradigm's devel- opment, is directed to articulating the paradigm, rendering it more precise where the original formula- tion has inevitably been vague (Kuhn, 1972: p. 93). I emphasize this "mop-up" activity because, in essence, it is what the first part of this essay is all about. The major assumption involved here will be that the idea of the Stone Age can be treated as an archetypical paradigm and that its PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 120, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 1976 59</page><page sequence="2">60 STANLEY A. CZARNIK [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. internal differentiation into a Paleolithic, Meso- lithic, and Neolithic amounted ito "paradigm ar- ticulation," that is, a continuing attempt to bring the basic model into closer consonance with the growing store of archaeological data. In historical retrospect, the two crucial features of Thomsen's original Three Age formulation were that its basis and meaning were solely tech- nological and that implicit in it was a relative chronology. In Thomsen's words, it was a classi- fication of "weapons and implements" (Thomsen, 1836; see translation by Ellesmere, 1848: pp. 63- 68) the order of which was time-successive, Stone preceding Bronze and Bronze preceding Iron. The Three Age system had no meanings other than these and, evidentally, this is what Thomsen intended. But when the three ages became four with the first division of the Stone Age, the con- tent of the new categories was altered to connote considerably more than technology and relative chronology. The first formal internal elaboration of the Stone Age concept came in 1865 with the publi- cation of Sir John Lubbock's (later Lord Ave- bury's) Prehistoric Times. In this work, it was recognized that archaeological excavation was turning up two qualitatively different kinds of stone implement; one kind was characterized by a rough, crude chipping technique, while the other featured fine, delicate flaking that produced a smooth and often polished surface. To accom- modate this distinction, the Stone Age was broken down into two periods, the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, thus making for a total of "four great epochs" (Avebury, 1913: p. 2). But differences in technology alone did not the Paleolithic and Neolithic make; in addition, they were defined in terms of two other sets of parallel distinctions: the first involved subsistence base (hunting, fishing, and collecting versus food-producing), the sec- ond, absolute chronology (Pleistocene versus Holocene or Recent) (see Childe, 1951: pp. 29- 30; 1956: p. 43; Clark, 1962: p. 97). The point here is that the internal articulation of the Stone Age paradigm utilized criteria foreign to those employed in the original three-part differentia- tion of prehistory by Thomsen. But at the heart of the matter is the fact that Lubbock treated his technological, economic, and absolute chronologi- cal distinctions as if they coincided; in fact, of course, they do not. Lubbock's dichotomy of the Stone Age, like all dichotomies, tended to imply a sort of logical or conceptual gap between its elements; and, for some time, this gap seemed to be substantiated in the archaeological record. The jagged and crudely chipped stonework of the Paleolithic from sites like St. Acheul stood in sharp contrast to the delicately flaked, highly finished celts and daggers of the Neolithic. Translated into chro- nology, this distinction led to the hypothesis that there existed a break or "hiatus in human ex- istence" (Brown, 1893: p. 66) between the Paleo- lithic and Neolithic periods in Europe (see also Binford, 1968: pp. 313-315; Clark, 1962: pp. 97-98). To account for the break some writers suggested that Paleolithic man simply became ex- tinct like many of the Ice Age animals with which he lived; others thought he was invaded and ex- terminated by a well-armed "Neolithic race" sweeping into Europe from points unknown. Now according to Binford (1968), J. Allen Brown (1893) was one of the first to argue in favor of an unbroken continuity between the Paleolithic and Neolithic, intimating that the pro- posed hiatus between them was largely illusory. With regard to Stone Age technology, it was noted that, if the chronologically latest forms are compared with the earliest, the difference is very striking; but when a large se- ries from different levels of valley drift and caves and from the surface is studied, the evolution of the more recent from the older forms is apparent and a continuity is evident between them all. The sup- posed break in the continuity of the stone age in this country is bridged by the discovery of implements of later Paleolithic type and others from which their form may be regarded as of transition or inter- mediate age (Brown, 1893: p. 67). To cover these "intermediate" lithic industries, Brown opted for the Mesolithic, a term already introduced into the literature some twenty years earlier (Westropp, 1872). A historically signifi- cant aspect of Brown's conception of the Meso- lithic was his observation that the term was applica- ble to those stone implements which appeared to be of "intermediate age between the Paleolithic and Neolithic" (Brown, 1893: p. 94) and "which belong neither to the drift period nor to that of polished stone" (ibid., p. 93). Thus, owing almost entirely to the context in which the idea developed, the concept of the Mesolithic was, from the very beginning, a residual category (Parsons, 1968: pp. 16-20), utilized to embrace empirical archaeological data that could not be adequately handled by either the Paleolithic or the Neoli-thic. In other words, the Mesolithic was a category</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 120, NO. 1, 1976] THE THEORY OF THE MESOLITHIC 61 negatively defined, occupying the conceptual space between the poinits where the (positively defined) Paleolithic left off and the (positively defined) Neolithic began. If, as is almost always the case, not all the actually observable facts of the field, or those which have 'been observed, fit into the sharply, positively defined categories, they tend to be given one or more blanket names which refer to categories negatively defined, that is, of facts known to exist, which are even more or less adequately described, but are defined theo- retically by their failure to fit into the positively de- fined categories of the system (ibid., p. 17). With the introduction and general acceptance of the Mesolithic, the Stone Age paradigm received its last major elaboration; its three-part internal differentiation represented a logically closed clas- sificatory system-the addition of a residual Mesolithic to an already established Paleolithic and Neolithic permitted the conceptualization, within the confines of the scheme, of any data that might arise. According to Parsons (ibid., pp. 18-19), there is an inherent tendency in science to attempt to eliminate residual categories "in favor of posi- tively defined, empirically verifiable concepts." Indeed, he notes that one kind of progress of theoretical work consists precisely in the carving out from residual categories of definite positively defined concepts and their veri- fication in empirical investigation (ibid., p. 18). It is, then, not surprising to find that this kind of ''carving out" process has characterized much of the scientific thought concerning the Mesolithic since the 1890's, and since the 1920's in particu- lar. The Mesolithic, in a sense, has lost much of its "residualness" and has come to denote a variable number of relatively positive occurrences in prehistory. Nevertheless, the fact remains that much of what the Mesolithic is conceived to be corresponds to what it is believed the Paleolithic and the Neolithic by definition are not. This has led to fuzzy reasoning and some confusion regard- ing the meaning (especially ecological meaning) of some parts of the archaeological record; and, it is a confusion which, in all probability, can be traced back in principle to John Lubbock's origi- nal articulation of the Stone Age paradigm and spurious correlation of Paleolithic and Neolithic stone technology with differences in economy and absolute chronology. It is hoped that these last points will become clearer as we proceed. THE MODERN CONCEPT Very basically, all contemporary views of the European Mesolithic involve in some way the no- tion of "cultural readaptation to post-Pleistocene environments" (Braidwood and Willey, 1962: p. 332; see also, e.g., Binford, 1968: p. 313; Childe, 1957: p. 1; Clark, 1962: p. 100; Gabel, 1958: p. 658), and, thereby, are in chronological line with Lubbock's association of the end of the Pleisto- cene or Ice Age with the end of the Paleolithic. The classical conception of the impact that the new postglacial environment had upon the an- cient hunters of Upper Paleolithic Europe is well represented in this passage by Gordon Childe (1942: p. 43): In Ice Age Europe savagery produced dazzling cul- ture and, judging by the relatively numerous skele- tons that survive, supported a substantially increased population. But this cultural efflorescence, this ex- pansion of population were made possible by the food supply bounteously provided by glacial condi- tions and an economy narrowly specialized to exploit these. With the end of the Ice Age these conditions passed away. As the glaciers melted, forests in- vaded tundras and steppes, and the herds of mam- moth, reindeer, bison, and horse migrated or died out. With their disappearance, the culture of the societies which preyed upon them also withered away. In the early Holocene, during what the archae- ologists term the mesolithic phase, we find instead of the Gravettian and Magdelenian cave men, small groups scattered about in the vast forest in open glades, on the shore of seas or meres and along river banks hunting and snaring forest game, wild fowl, and fish. .. . By contrast to what had passed away, the mesolithic societies leave an impression of ex- treme poverty. Utilizing the fundamental idea of post-Pleisto- cene adaptation, Lewis Binford (1968: pp. 317- 318) has summarized from the literature and listed ". . . some of ithe generalizations made in distinguishing the Paleolithic from the Meso- lithic"; they are as follows: (1) There was a major shift in the centers of popu- lation growth in Western Europe. (2) There was a major change in the form of stone tools (i.e., the production of small, geometric or "microlithic" tools). (3) There is greater geographical variety in cultural remains suggesting more specific responses to local environmental conditions. (4) There was a marked increase in the exploitation of aquatic resources and wild fowl. (5) There was a "trend" toward small game hunt- ing.

The concept of the Mesolithic has thus become literally loaded with meanings and has come to denote a whole series of demographic, techno- logical, socio-cultural, economic, chronological, and ecological differentials, each of which is sup- posedly unique to the period in contradistinction to the Paleolithic. Now, since the Mesolithic as a category was not originally designed to bear the conceptual burden it now supports, the question at this point becomes: To what extent does the modern archaeological record substantiate the differentiation of a Mesolithic so conceived? It is to this subject that we now turn. A key aspect of the contemporary idea of the Mesolithic is the nature and chronology of the environmental changes that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene (ca. 8300 B.C.), a date which, taken in this context, marks the end of the Paleo- lithic as well. The climatic amelioration of the postglacial period is generally interpreted as being the prime mover behind the "dramatic cul- tural and environmental changes" (Binford, 1968: p. 318) that ensued during the Mesolithic; this is brought out clearly in the passage by Childe quoted above (see also Rozoy, 1973: p. 514). Clark and Piggot (1965: p. 131) have asserted that the "end of the Pleistocene Ice Age seems to have been as sudden as the thawing of a frozen pond" with the implication that the cultural changes of the Mesolithic descended with a nearly equal rapidity. Karl Butzer (1971: pp. 528- 533), however, has expressed the opinion that a certain overemphasis has been placed on the paleo- climatological meaning of the inherently arbitrary date established to mark the end of the Pleisto- cene. According to Butzer, the post-Pleistocene trend towards warmer temperatures in Europe accom- panied by glacial retreat, forest encroachment, faunal changes, etc. was not unique to that par- ticular point (i.e., 8300 B.C.) in geological time. The climatic and vegetational changes of the early Holocene were paralleled "in magnitude and kind" (Butzer, 1971: p. 530) nearly 2,000 years earlier during the warm Aller6d oscillation (10,200- 9,400) which was preceded by a somewhat shorter warm period, the B6lling (10,800-10,400) (see table 1). During the Aller6d interval forests re- colonized most of the Wiirmian tundras with birch parkland in the European northwest, spruce and pine in the southeast, and birch, pine, and pine woodland taking their place centrally. July tem- peratures during the Aller6d averaged 5-6 de- grees C. warmer than those of the main Wurm. It might be noted here that none of these changes due to the warm-up contrasted with glacial con- ditions as much in the southern portions of Eu- rope as they did in the more northerly areas. Waterbolk (1968: p. 1093) points out that environmental fluctuations . . . were of much greater importance in the north than in the south, where major climatic improvements had started long before and not been interrupted by pauses and minor re- advances (see also Tringham, 1973: p. 553). Following the Aller6d, the Younger Dryas brought a drop in world temperatures and sea levels and the last major glacial readvancement. Finally, at about 8300 B.C., climatic conditions reversed themselves once again and a very gradual warming trend began, reaching a climax during the long, moist Atlantic period when temperatures over much of Europe attained a level 2.0-2.5 de- grees C. warmer than those of the present (Clark, 1952: p. 14). Butzer (1971: p. 530) sums up the meaning of these late Pleistocene/early Holo- TABLE 1 LATE GLACIAL AND HOLOCENE POLLEN ZONES OF NORTHWESTERN EUROPE (from Butzer, 1971) Zone Date (B.C.)

The composite picture of environ- mental change can therefore not be arbitrarily broken down into over-simplified units delimited by the date of 8300 B.c. The relevance of Butzer's conclusions for our discussion is that the onset of the climatic and environmental changes generally assumed to have necessitated the ecological adaptations that pro- duced the European Mesolithic at the beginning of the Holocene do not correlate with it chrono- logically; in reality, these changes began not sud- denly and abruptly at the end of the Pleistocene, but gradually and spasmodically some 2,000-3,000 years earlier. Thus, in a manner of speaking, the Holocene was foreshadowed in the Pleistocene; and, it would noit be surprising to find this an- ticipation reflected in the archaeological record. Perhaps more than any other single trait, small, geometrically shaped, "microlithic" stone imple- ments, or "pigmy tools" as they were earlier called (e.g., Burkitt, 1925: p. 19), have practi- cally become a synonym for the Mesolithic, al- though it has been pointed out that this is not an entirely correct usage (Gabel, 1958: p. 658). It is, therefore, important to note that, of all the characteristics of the Mesolithic listed by Bin- ford, microlithic tool forms have some of the clearest archaeological beginnings in the Upper Paleolithic: Typologically and stylistically, nearly all the elements found in Preboreal or early Boreal (stone) indus- tries can be found within the original, indigenous Paleolithic inventories (Newell, 1973: p. 420). Similarly, Childe (1957: p. 6) wrote that "a tendency to reduce the size of flint blades was common to most Upper Paleolithic industries" (see also Clark, 1962: pp. 100-101). For ex- ample, at certain times during the Magdelenian period, dating to ca. 17,000-11,000 B.C. (Butzer, 1971: p. 475), there appears a "certain tendency to manufacture small, geometric tools, rectangles and triangles" (Ucko and Rosenfeld, 1967: p. 21); and Bordes (1968: p. 164) discusses the small, often thumbnail shaped scrapers that turn up in the later phases of the Magdelenian "which are a prelude to the Azilian," a quasi-microlithic technological complex derived from the French Magdelenian during the Allerod (Childe, 1957: p. 5; Rozoy, 1973: p. 508). In addition to its foreshadowings in the Magde- lenian, the treatment that the Azilian has re- ceived in the literature is of considerable relevance to our discussion. Although the Azilian is at present dated solidly to the late Pleistocene (and, by Lubbock's traditional correlation, to the Paleo- lithic as well), it has very widely been placed by prehistorians, either explicitly or implicitly, into the Mesolithic (e.g., Burkitt, 1925: p. 16; Childe, 1957: pp. 3-5; Kroeber, 1948; pp. 669-670; Mo- vius 1956: p. 76); indeed W. J. Sollas (1924: p. 595) went so far as to favor the replacement of the term Mesolithic with the "Azilian Age." All this is especially interesting in the sense that 'the Azilian has frequently been cited as among the best archaeological examples of the so-called Mesolithic "cultural degeneration" (no. 6 in Bin- ford's list) from the noble savagery of the Upper Paleolithic. The Azilian culture . . . was in almost every respect inferior to that of the late Magdelenian which it immediately succeeded and from which it almost cer- tainly sprang. The flint workers developed no new ideas of importance, and their small thumb-nail scrapers compare ill with the splendid blade scrapers of their predecessors (Clark and Piggott, 1965: p. 133). But as we have seen, Azilian technology is very much a continuation of trends established during the Magdelenian and does not represent a unique and abrupt slip into lithic inferiority; and, even if it did, it would be something that happened during the Paleolithic, not the Mesolithic. More- over, it is possible to interpret the tendency to manufacture microliths as a considerable cultural advance since small tools can be used compositely to produce a much wider range of implements than can be designed from larger flint blades used individually (Tringham, 1968: p. 46). Continuing the theme of the Mesolithic "cul- tural degeneration," Clark and Piggott (1965: p. 133) turn to Azilian art styles as represented by a few traces of incised lines and zig-zags on pointed bone objects and the rather pathetic lines and dots painted on river-worn pebbles, the most expressive of which suggest highly developed anthropomorphic forms; (these) are the only sad remnants of the splendors of Magdelenian chattel art. But if Azilian art is also a degeneration, then it too is a degeneration that originated in the Mag- delenian. Leroi-Gourhan (1968: p. 61), for in- stance, reports the da;ting of some engraved peb- bles "displaying sketchy, often barely identifiable animal figures" to the later phases of the Mag-</page><page sequence="6">64 STANLEY A. CZARNIK [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. delenian in the Dordogne. And again, in the late Magdelenian, "carvings in ithe round and accu- rate representations become less frequent, and much of the decoration consisted of finely en- graved geometric or 'abstract' designs," according to Ucko and Rosenfeld (1967: p. 22). Finally, Clark (1936: p. 179) notes that in the art motifs of the Maglemosean of Preboreal-Boreal North- ern Europe can be found "a very fair portion" of geometric patterns traceable directly to the Mag- delenian. In general, the art of the Western European Upper Paleolithic may be characterized as exhibiting a distinct chronological "tendency from naturalism towards conventionalism" (ibid., p. 178). In addition to "Mesolithic" technology and art styles both having unmistakable beginnings in the Upper Paleolithic, the same is true for a number of the other generalizations compiled by Binford. For instance, Butzer (1971: p. 536) and Newell (1973: pp. 409-412) are in doubt as to whether or not a "major shift in the centers of population growth" (no. 1) correlated with a move to coastal areas where a "marked increase in the exploita- tion of aquatic resources" (no. 4) took place can actually be inferred from the known corpus of archaeological data. These claims are associated in part with the statement regarding the existence of a "greater geographic variety in cultural re- mains" (no. 3) following the end of the Pleisto- cene and thus it may be asked whether or not this too is really unique to the Holocene and the European Mesolithic. During and after the ter- mination of the Pleistocene, sea levels rose con- tinuously until as late as 3000 B.C. thereby sub- merging any late Paleolithic (and early Meso- lithic) coastal sites that may have existed. And, interestingly, in those areas where geologic and hydrographic con- ditions have fortuitously conserved coastal sites, and these have been discovered and excavated, we find a continuous series of coastal sites, from the Late Glacial and early Post Glacial into the mid- Atlantic (Newell, 1973: p. 411). In this connection, it might be noted that some of the earliest definite European coastal settle- ments are found in Italy and date to the Aller6d (Rozoy, 1973: p. 512) while evidence for ocean- shell collecting and even seal hunting (both cer- tainly exploitations of aquatic resources) in the form of skeletal remains and artistic representa- tions goes back well into the Upper Paleolithic of France and Spain (Butzer, 1971: pp. 536-537; Clark, 1952: pp. 72-73). Complementing the alleged Mesolithic move to the sea is the apparent paucity of early Holocene inland settlement (see Waterbolk, 1968: p. 1096). But here, too, there seem to be good geological reasons for the observed skewness in site distri- bution. With the postglacial period came the active down-cutting of many European rivers and streams resulting in alluvial fills under which many early Mesolithic riverline settlements are probably lost and buried. Most Mesolithic open- air sites lacked the depositional medium of loess that covered and preserved so many Paleolithic sites during the glacial period (Butzer, 1971: p. 536). Thus, any Paleolithic-Mesolithic differ- ential in "centers of population growth" may be more an artifact of the archaeological record than it is a reflection of actual post-Pleistocene migra- tions or population reductions. However, some parts of Europe did become inhabited during the Holocene that were very likely not inhabited be- fore because of occupation by ice; this can be illustrated by the appearance of the Erteb6lle and related cultures on the shores of the Baltic Sea following the Boreal (Gabel, 1958: pp. 659-661). Finally, in regard to the "trend toward small game hunting" (no. 5) it is to be noted that this, much like Mesolithic technology and art styles, is a tendency of pre-Holocene antiquity, as Binford (1968: p. 317) himself points out. The mam- malian prey of Upper Paleolithic man was auto- matically reduced in relative size with the shift to reindeer hunting after the disappearance of the mammoth, wooly rhinoceros, musk ox, and other megafauna during the Bdlling or the Aller6dd at the latest; the reindeer remained the staple food of prehistoric populations in northwestern Europe from the late Pleistocene to their eclipse some- time during the Preboreal (Butzer, 1971: p. 535). "Only the very end of some four millennia of ecological transition from tundra to forest (ca. 11,000-7500 B.C.) seems to have driven the re- maining tundra fauna from temperate Europe" (ibid.). In the early Holocene, the reindeer's place in the prehistoric economy was taken by the larger herbivores, aurochs, for example, which, in turn, gave way to wild boar, the smaller varieties of deer, and other woodland mammals (Newell, 1973: p. 415). In the more southerly portions of the European continent all of these changes occurred considerably earlier and none of them occurred overnight; according to Newell</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 120, NO. 1, 1976] THE THEORY OF THE AMIESOLITHIC 65 (ibid.) the faunal transition of the late Pleisto- cene/early Holocene period is best seen as a "gradual transition paralleling the alterations in the composition of the vegetation" (emphasis mine). SOME CONCLUSIONS Limitations of time and space prevent me from going further into the manner in which modern archaeological data demonstrate the essential con- tinuity of prehistoric life-ways in the late Pleisto- cene through the early Holocene of Europe; so let us briefly summarize and interpret some of the things we have discussed. It seems clear that at no single point in the small span of geologic time considered (and this includes the 8300 B.C. date) was there ever a climatic change abrupt enough, an ecological shift dramatic enough, or, by inference, a detectable socio-cultural transition fast enough to mark usefully the end of a major period in prehistory and the beginning of another. Thus it may be that the creation of a category "Mesolithic" as distinct from "Paleolithic" is about as relevant to the processual understanding of this particular part of the archaeological rec- ord as, to borrow a phrase, the creation of a cate- gory "blue butterflies" would be to understanding the anatomical structure of Lepidoptera (Leach, 1961: p. 4). The anthropological value of the archaeological record in Europe from, say, 15,000 to 5000 B.C. lies in the fact that it provides an almost unbroken series of clues to the ways in which socio-cultural and cultural-ecological change takes place within the context of a constantly transmuting natural environment; and any gross breakdown of this important continuum into arbi- trary units, one of which (the Mesolithic) is crammed with ("post-Pleistocene") adaptations, while the other (the late Paleolithic) is not, is quite literally masking and obscuring a consider- able amount of valuable information. In our historical review of the internal articu- lation of the Stone Age paradigm we saw that the original correla-tion of what may be called stages in cultural evolution with absolute geological time was made when Lubbock conceived the Paleo- lithic as being coterminous with the Pleistocene. This association held when the Mesolithic was introduced into the scheme thereby making the Mesolithic, by definition, necessarily post-Pleisto- cene as well as post-Paleolithic-hence, the mod- ern concept of the Mesolithic as involving the "post-Pleistocene adaptation" of the indigenous European Paleolithic population to the new post- glacial environment prior to the introduction of plant and animal domestication; given the devel- opmental context of the concept, it is hard to think of it as having come to mean anything else. However, as has been shown, the cultural and the ecological manifestations of the Meso- lithic are in many ways continuations of dynamic adaptive trends with definite roots in the Upper Paleolithic; thus, it appears that in a very real sense the idea of the Mesolithic, whether we know it or not, has the effect of making an unbroken trajectory of cultural evolution conform to our notion of absolute geological time. In a somewhat broader sense, the key issue here is that nearly any conceivable sequence of evolu- tionary stages will be a sequence of classificatory units, of abstractions; and, as such, some facts will be selected for inclusion and emphasis while others will not so as not to damage the integrity of the stages qua stages. Without the differen- tial selection of data from the flux of nature, sci- ence itself would be impossible. To be sure, the postulation of a Mesolithic stage in European prehistory was and remains a useful and legiti- mate classificatory action from this perspective. But the point is that the theoretical purpose of the modern idea of the Mesolithic, involving, as it does, adaptive processes, is undermined by the very concept intended to embrace it. If our in- terest is emergent cultural-ecological change and its archaeological manifestations, then it seems our selection of facts must be different from that which might contribute to the abstraction of se- quential evolutionary stages. It is necessary, for the investigation of adaptive processes, to go be- yond the normative formulation of evolutionary stage A and evolutionary stage B and on to the detailed examination of what was beginning to happen in A that brought about the development of B out of it. The juxtaposition of an anatomi- cally generalized reptile with an anatomically generalized mammal tells us little about how rep- tiles became mammals. Evolutionary stages, no matter how precisely characterized, invariably obscure evolutionary processes to some degree, and stage classifications must not be permitted to rigidify in our thinking to the point where this important fact is forgotten.
