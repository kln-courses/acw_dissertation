<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greek Myth and Etruscan Imagery in the Tomb of the Bulls at Tarquinia JOHN PETER OLESON Abstract Any evaluation of Etruscan art must include a balanced appraisal of both local creativity and the influence of Greek myth and iconography. Previous studies of the frescoes in the Tomb of the Bulls at Tarquinia have emphasized the influence of Greek iconography to the detriment of local creativity, but this attitude is dependent upon mistaken identifica- tion of important details in the Troilos scene. A motif usually dismissed as an incompetently drawn plant is identified as a representation of the setting sun. This cosmic body refers not only to the involve- ment of Apollo in the Troilos story, but also to local religious beliefs; in consequence it constitutes evi- dence for the creative reuse of Greek myth by an Etruscan artist. It is shown that the representation of the incident in the fresco closely corresponds to its treatment in the Kypria, and it is suggested that the artist received his inspiration directly from Greek literary sources rather than from imported vase- paintings. An understanding of iconographical sources is vital to any evaluation of Etruscan art. Until com- paratively recently, however, this issue has been in- extricably confused with the problem of originality: the nineteenth and early twentieth-century art his- torians felt the relationship between Etruscan and Greek art to be largely parasitic in both spirit and iconography, while most popular and some scholar- ly investigation since the great European exhibition of Etruscan art in 1955-1956 has projected the icono- clastic, independent attitude of modern artists on the body of Etruscan art, especially that of the Ar- chaic period.' This same sort of conflation of is- sues in its popularized formulation, along with a misunderstanding of linguistic and historical prob- PLATES 35-37 lems, is at the root of the bizarre, perennial myth of the "Etruscan Mystery." Advances have been made in our understanding of Etruscan origins only by the proper definition of the ethnological terms in- volved-for example the nature of national origin and racial composition-and by an objective realiza- tion of the long period of time in which these fac- tors were at work.2 The discussion of originality in the light of the iconographical sources of Etruscan art can profit by the same care and discretion. Al- though the Etruscans were not the passionate pan- theists so vividly depicted by D.H. Lawrence,3 the aesthetic basis of their art was indeed strikingly different from that of the Greeks; so it should not be judged by the same standards. However, this local genius, which flowered only in Central Italy, was nevertheless emboldened and fructified by in- tercourse with the literary and iconographical stim- uli of Greek culture. Since the nature of the Etrus- can hybrid, like the temper of Greek art itself, naturally changed during the six centuries assigned to it by modern historians, chronology is an im- portant consideration. Neither the simple investiga- tion of iconographical sources, nor the blind evalua- tion of aesthetic impact, are sufficient basis for the understanding of any chosen period or single exam- ple of Etruscan artistic production. Etruscan art of the sixth century B.C., which richly reflects the contemporary prosperity and activity of Central Italy, has proven an excellent field for this sort of balanced evaluation. No attempt can be made here to summarize even the recent literature on this subject, but the thesis of one book, and the issues 1 This paper grew out of a seminar on Etruscan art I con- ducted in the Fall of 1973.

In their Griechische Sagen in der friihen etruski- schen Kunst Roland Hampe and Erika Simon have proposed the theory that sixth-century Etrus- can artists were directly familiar with the Greek text of parts of the Epic Cycle: ... die Etrusker eigene Kenntnis von Wortlaut griechischer Epen hatten. Sie iibernahmen nicht nur von der griechischen Kunst gepriigte Bild- typen, sondern formten auch selbstdindig, in un- mittelbaren Anschluss an den griechischen Epos Szenen, die so in der griechischer Bildkunst nicht bezeugt sind.5 Since the material on which this theory rests-four Pontic amphorae and one oinochoe, along with two bronze reliefs-is difficult to interpret and pos- sibly inconclusive in sum, both the thesis and the evidence behind it have met with general skepticism and attempts at detailed refutation.6 Even the most enthusiastic reviewer, while hailing "cette rehabili- tation des artistes 6trusques, que l'on tenait pour d'infideles interpretes de modules mal compris ... ,"7 voices reluctant skepticism concerning the final deduction: Nous ne pensons donc pas qu'il y ait lieu d'at- tribuer aux Etrusques une connaissance litt&amp;rale des poemes 6piques . .., mais nous leur attribu- erons volontiers une docte familiarit6 avec les l6gendes qu'ils traitaient et avec l'esprit qui les animait.8 In two long review articles, G. Camporeale and T. Dohrn are less generous in their evaluation of the familiarity of sixth-century Etruscan artists with Greek myths, but both scholars understand the necessity for a balanced appraisal of local origi- nality together with the utilization of foreign myth. The point of contention is the form in which Greek mythological cycles reached the receptive Etruscan mind: as epic poems in the Greek language, as Greek mythological cycles retold locally in Etrus- can, or as fundamentally foreign iconographical schemes blindly copied from imported Greek vases by uninformed but fascinated Etruscan artists. While Hampe and Simon believe that variant de- tails in Etruscan mythological representations un- paralleled in Greek iconography can be traced back to the actual literary formulation of the story, Cam- poreale interprets such aberrations as "mistakes," to be attributed to an untutored copying of Greek iconography.' He emphasizes, quite rightly, that the whole scene must be coherently related to Greek tradition, not just certain striking, but basically minor, details. In addition, the disparate purpose of figurative and literary composition must not be forgotten: "Nel caso specifico di rappresentazioni mitologiche l'artista, pittore o bronzista o scultore, e artista independentemente e prima di essere mito- grafico."'0 The independence of the visual and literary traditions even for Homeric myths within Greek vase-painting has been well established by C. Dugas, M. Weinke and C. Mota and is touched upon in R.M. Cook's detailed review of Hampe and Simon's book: ". . . these artists seem to have treated Greek mythology as freely as did their Greek contemporaries."" Camporeale emphasizes that the "banalizzazioni etrusche di miti greci" are hardly understandable in the context of a deep, literal familiarity with Greek myth.12 Dohrn, while 4 R. Hampe and E.

Es lag ihnen mehr am Helden und am Unhold im einzelnen als an der Sage, in der beide miteinander verbunden sind.13 The dignified suicide of Ajax and the heroic ex- ploits of Herakles certainly exercised a natural ap- peal on the Etruscans, even apart from any literary aura surrounding them. Dohrn feels, however, that a full familiarity with the literary tradition of Greek myth only came to Etruria in the first half of the fifth century, by way of Magna Graeca."4 While Dohrn's sensitive approach to the Etruscan reception of Greek mythological iconography, an interpretation which involves more local creativity than he admits, may be correct for many monu- ments, it cannot be applied satisfactorily to the scene of the ambush of Troilos in the Tomb of the Bulls at Tarquinia. Dohrn himself points out the special character of this tomb: Der Oberfall des Achill auf Tro'los ist das einzige griechische Sagenbild, das in ein archaisches etruskisches Grab, in die Tomba dei Tori, Ein- gang gefunden hat.15 A realization of the unique nature of these tomb frescoes is important for any discussion of the crea- tive utilization of Greek myth in Etruscan art. Since the identification of the subject as the ambush of Troilos by Achilles is obvious and undisputed, an analysis of its elements escapes the nagging doubts which affect the interpretations proposed by Hampe and Simon for their Pontic amphorae and bronze reliefs.'" The fresco lacks some elements im- portant to Greek representations of the incident- Troilos's sister Polyxena, for example-and includes details without parallel in contemporary Greek or Etruscan versions (discussed below), but the varia- tion is well within the limits accepted even by Greek vase-painters, and the general content is un- mistakable." It is difficult to understand why an Etruscan artist would have taken the remarkable step of represent- ing a Greek mythological scene in a tomb fresco unless the story seemed a powerful and appropriate one; in order to appreciate this element of the Troi- los incident he must have been familiar with the suspense, the destruction of young life, and the symbolic significance of the event. Consequently, in the light of the clamor raised by Hampe and Simon's book, it is necessary to reconsider in the context of the Tomb of the Bulls the important questions they and their reviewers have raised. Is it possible that this fresco is no more significant for our knowledge of the Etruscan use of Greek myth than the generalized and often ambiguous scenes on the Pontic amphorae, to whose artistic milieu the fresco artist himself is related?'" Or does the unique content of these frescoes suggest that the artist had some special familiarity with the Greek Epic Cycle, especially with the Kypria, where the story found its major pre-Classical ex- 13 Dohrn (supra n. 4) 26. 14 Ibid. pp. 24-25, 27. 15 Ibid. p. 26; also L.

If so, was this a knowledge of the Greek text itself or of stories paraphrased by visit- ing Greek merchants? Even at first glance this monumental, carefully executed representation of the Troilos incident has the appearance of a sensi- tive, knowledgeable reworking of an episode from the Kypria, not the awkward lines of an isolated scene blindly copied from an imported Greek vase or its Pontic stepchild. It is the purpose of this paper to point out several details in the fresco which strongly suggest that the artist was familiar not merely with the iconographical tradition of the death of Troilos in Greek art, but with the literary sources behind it-most likely the Kypria. At the same time, a discussion of the sensitive manner in which the incident has been adapted to suit Etrus- can taste and religious conceptions will constitute interesting evidence for the maturity of the Etrus- can mind and the processes of creativity on the fringes of the Greek artistic tradition. The frescoes of the Tomb of the Bulls, appar- ently commissioned by Arath Spuriana, according to the inscription painted on the back wall,20 are too well known to require detailed description here."2 The gabled areas at the top of the front and back walls of the three chambers are filled with brightly colored heraldic animals: bulls, birds, hippocamps, a panther, lion, and a goat. Bellerophon and the Chimaera are opposed in the tympanum at the back of the main chamber, the only wall further deco- rated with figured scenes below the gable (pl. 35, figs. I and 2). Two erotic groups appear in the frieze above the two doors which frame the panel showing the ambush of Troilos, located conspicu- ously in the center of the wall (pl. 36, fig. 3). There is a low frieze of trees or bushes below the mytho- logical scene, as well as a single tree outside the doorways, at either end. Achilles, armed with a sword and spear and protected by helmet, greaves and loin-cloth, lurks menacingly at the left side of the mythological panel, hiding behind several plants and a large, ashlar fountain structure. Troilos, naked but carrying a long spear, rides calmly in from the right on a long-legged white horse, un- aware of the presence of the Greek hero. According to the Greek version of the story, the young prince was either exercising and watering his horses out- side the confining walls of the besieged citadel or was accompanying his sister Polyxena on her way to draw water for household use."2 This artist has chosen the first of the three major alternative stages in which the story was visualized in antiquity: the suspenseful moment before the springing of the ambush, the agonizing strain of flight and pursuit, and the brutal slaying of the youth by Achilles at the altar of Apollo.2 The absence of Polyxena and the presence of only one horse rather than a pair are remarkable anomalies, but they do not obscure the meaning of the scene; both aberrations can be paralleled in contemporary vase-painting."2 Other than the style of the figure drawing and the strange form of the fountain-which Cam- poreale feels may represent a local design"2-the most strikingly Etruscan, or non-Greek, aspect of 19 The tomb is dated by Banti (supra n. 15) I80-8I to 530- 52o B.C.

Robertson, "Ibycus: Polycrates, Troilus, Polyxena," BulllnstClassStud I7 (97o0) I1-15 discusses the possibility that the incident was recounted by Ibycus in "To Polycrates," which he dates to 564-560 B.C. (p. I2). Robertson notes that the Troilos story was told in the Kypria, but asserts that its popularity in the sixth century was due to the existence of a lyric version, as that of the fifth cen- tury may have been owed to dramatic versions by Phrynicus and Sophocles (p. 13); see also infra n. 79. 20A.J.

Occasionally only one horse is present during Troilos' flight: see "Achill-Troilos (Verfolgung)" C2. Both Polyxena and the horses are absent at Troilos's death: see "Achill-Troilos (Tod des Troilos . . . )" A2 (which should read "Mota fig. 9"), A3, CI, and C3. The Laconian cup painters seem to have exercised special freedom in rearranging the ambush scene: in CI and C4 the major part of the tondo is occupied by the giant figure of Achilles crouching before the fountain, while Troilos and Poly- xena flee in the small exergue below. In C5, a Laconian cup in the Louvre (E669), a similar scene is shown, but Troilos and his sister have disappeared entirely. See P. Zancani-Mon- tuoro, "L'agguato a Troilo nella ceramica laconica," BdA 39 (I954) 289-95. Banti (supra n. 15) 146 n. 7 lists the vases on which Polyxena is lacking, and on p.

The same type of high, dusky plant, often yielding dark blue berries, appears in many archaic Etruscan tomb frescoes, constituting a com- mon funereal motif probably symbolic of rebirth or chthonic transformation.2 The date-palm which bisects the panel is another element often symbolic of rebirth, but in this context it probably has the primary purpose of locating the scene in or near the sanctuary of Thymbraian Apollo, at whose altar Troilos was killed.29 An irregular, dark-red semicircle protrudes from the ground directly beneath Troilos's horse, support- ing ten long, thin rays of the same color which spread more or less concentrically from the center of the solid. Most commentators dismiss this curi- ous shape as an unknown or incompetently drawn plant, or as a small mound of earth with single plants growing off it, added from a sense of horror vacui."0 Poulsen terms it a "Blumenbeet," related to the flowerbeds on some seventh-century Syrian tridacna shell engravings found in Naukratis and Aegina, possibly derived from the Near Eastern "Tree of Life" (pl. 36, fig. 4)." This interpretation, as Banti remarks in her study of the tomb, is not convincing." The resemblance of the clump in the Tomb of the Bulls to Poulsen's budding, flowering "Blumenbeet" is only approximate and is badly weakened by the total lack of flowers or leaves on the sprigs in the fresco. The other plants in the Tomb of the Bulls, none of which are barren, show that the artist was a capable illustrator of botanical motifs."3 The prominence and size of the clump, along with this competence, make it unlikely that inattention or sloppiness explain deviations from the Syrian Blumenbeet, while for the same reason it is equally impossible to interpret the motif as a careless rendition of a bush, ground palm, or cactus. In addition, R. Pampanini has noted that the fan- tasy often characteristic of floral motifs in Etruscan tombs is held in check when these plants carry symbolic or ritual meaning.3 The symbolic impor- tance of the "Tree of Life" in such a position would have assured its careful, accurate reproduction. The inadequate, mistaken interpretation of this motif has severely hampered full appreciation of the Etruscan reworking of the Troilos scene in the Tomb of the Bulls: this fiery red orb with its shoot- ing rays only makes sense if it is interpreted as a naive, childish representation of the setting sun. The static nature of the picture obviously makes an interpretation as "rosy-fingered Dawn" equally possible in literal terms, but it will be shown below that the connections with the evening sun are more convincing and meaningful. An understanding of this unconventional interpretation is important for our knowledge of both Etruscan creativity and the 26 L. Banti (supra n. 15) 152-54 and 11 Mondo degli etruschi (2nd ed.)

The palm probably owed its overtones of immortality not only to its tenacity and ability to sprout after cutting but also to simple confusion with the magic Egyptian bird of the same name which periodically died and was resurrected. Pliny, HN XIII.42 claims, however, that the tree gave its name to the bird. It should be noted that the Phoinix bird was sacred to Helios. 30 Camporeale (supra n. 4) 443; Banti (supra n. 15) 151- 52. 31 F.

It is interesting in this regard to note that Dio Chrysos- tom, in relating Troilos's death, says that Achilles was clever at laying ambushes and attacking even at night: 4v yap 6 'AXLXXEi v EpE8pEicraLt ELVoraTo KaL VVKT E7rtOE'riaL.35 Furthermore, the manner in which the story is told in the epitome of Apol- lodorus's Bibliotheke suggests that the incident took place at the end of a long, eventful day of fighting, before a nocturnal exploit on the part of Achilles: Ka't KaraKXElraVTErc To;g Tpoag E7rTOXAldpKovV (jVfX- Kovrat S4 rTa vaLv. /IA' OappovrvEWV S rETov papfpipwv, 'AXLXXr e ivcSpicEa' TpotXov iv r o70 Ovl)flpalov 'Ardo'XXvo3 leo&amp; 4ovEVce, Ka VVKT6 i X(o ( 7'o 'v rd'Xtv AvKdcova Xa/Lf/vELa6 The summary of this section of the Kypria in Proclus's Chrestomathy relates the same sequence of events, although without indication of the time of day: Elmra CriovoUorTEv Oppqlvov- vTOVI 'AXatoI; 'AXtk- XEF., KaKTXELt.

In the Iliad, to which the poets of the Epic Cycle were heavily indebted for style and material, the setting sun often serves as a chronological device to articulate the story. The first day of fighting, which begins with an en- thusiastic decision by the Greeks to return home (thwarted by Odysseus), is broken off only by the coming of night in book VII (vv. 282, 293). The setting sun also ends the ensuing day of truce (VII. 465) and the following day of battle (VIII.485). During this last night Diomedes and Odysseus car- ry out their damaging raid on the Trojan camp (book X), making books II through X of the Iliad very similar in general structure to the abbreviated account of the events surrounding Troilos's death in the Kypria. The third long day of fighting (books XI through XVII) ends with the death of Patroklos and the fierce battle over his body, which the Greeks only recover after the semi-divine ap- parition of Achilles on the ramparts of their camp, followed immediately by sunset (XVIII.239-24I). Since all four of these bloody days had begun with the appearance of Dawn (11.48, VIII.i, XI.i) or the sun (VII.42I), the astronomical bracketing of the human activity is complete. The motif of the setting Sun in the Tomb of the Bulls can thus be interpreted as the literal repro- duction of the context of the story in the Kypria. Since this detail cannot be found in any of the numerous surviving representations of the death of Troilos in earlier, contemporary, or subsequent Greek or Etruscan vase-painting or bronze relief work, there is no reason to infer that in the tomb fresco it is part of the visual rather than the literary tradition surrounding the incident. An engraved Etruscan mirror in the Louvre shows a similar situation: the rape of Kassandra is witnessed by a female head surrounded by a radiant nimbus, evi- dently a personification of "rosy-fingered Dawn" rising after the long night of the Iliupersis (pl. 37, fig. 5).0 The setting of the sun, however, is a cos- mic event rich in symbolism, and there is a more profound dimension to its use in the Tomb of the Bulls beyond the careful illustration of Greek epic verse. It is probable that the sun, like the dark, fruit- laden palm tree in the center of the panel, is a sym- bol of Apollo, at whose Thymbraian altar the sup- pliant Troilos was impiously murdered by Achilles. Such an act naturally brought down Apollo's wrath 35 Orationes XI.77; ed. Dindorf, p. 189. 38Epitome 111.32, ed. J.G. Frazer (Cambridge, Mass. 1921) 200-202. It is important to note that Apollodorus was utilizing not only the Kypria, but the whole literary tradition: including the Epic Cycle, lyric poetry and tragedy; see the lucid dis- cussion by A.T.

A fourth-century mirror from Toscanella depicts Usil in the presence of Thesan (Eos, Aurora) and Ne- thuns (Neptune) :4 the youthful sun god's head is surrounded by a circular nimbus, but at the same time he holds the bow of Apollo in his right hand. A late sixth-century mirror in the Bibliotheque Na- tionale in Paris shows Apollo and Artemis facing each other on two low bases or altars, framing, but not supporting, a disembodied female head sur- rounded by a rayed halo (pl. 37, fig. 6).4' Apollo, who holds a sprig of myrtle, and Artemis, who wears a star-sprinkled chiton, are shown here as "Lichtgottheiten" in the radiant presence either of Leto, their mother, or of the Titan Theia, mother of Helios.48 Apollo and Helios were explicitly identi- fied with each other in the Orphic hymns, perhaps explaining the Dionysiac overtones in the grape vines which frame the scene and the panther who stalks above it."9 Although the rays surrounding this female head are similar in conception to those projecting from the setting sun in the Tomb of the Bulls, an even closer parallel can be found on another late sixth- century mirror, which was found in Orvieto and is now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (pl. 37, fig. 7).50 On this engraved disk Usil, represented as a beautiful youth, is sinking into the waves of the sea, which already cover him up to the breast; he holds a flaming grenade or comet in each out- stretched hand, while a semicircle with nine long, thin rays rests lightly on his head.51 Superficially, this mirror engraving could be compared with an Attic black-figure lekythos in Athens which depicts Helios rising from the sea in his chariot, carrying a full, bright disk with short rays just above his head.52 The general effect is the same, but the Etruscan conception is different in spirit. The sun god on the Etruscan mirror is a cosmic body whose hands support shooting stars and whose rising and setting are personal acts, not the symbolic deeds of a chariot driver. Usil's head does not support the round disk of the sun like a glorious hat,53 but in- stead, as the god sinks in the ocean, the shining star is simultaneously eclipsed in sympathy.

Further parallels can be seen in the rayed head painted on the side of an early fifth-century pilgrim flask in an Italian private collection and in the head of Helios on one side of a contemporary Etruscan mirror in Boston."4 The dark red color of the sun disk below Troilos's horse represents one of the principle pigments uti- lized in the Tomb of the Bulls. The palm tree, Achilles' loincloth, the trees below the mythologi- cal panel, several participants in the symplegmata above the doors, Bellerophon's horse in the gable, and large sections of the border and ornamentation are rendered in the same dark ochre, probably a mineral pigment based on iron oxides.55 The broad application of this pigment may have resulted from its low cost and availability rather than from any conscious or unconscious association of the color with the human life-force-a common ritual belief in ancient and modern cultures"6-but the red hue of the sun disk is certainly appropriate. The rich color of the setting sun is proverbial and ob- vious, while the strength of the color, in conjunc- tion with the spreading rays, may also represent the radiance generally characteristic of Helios and ascribed to him in many epithets: jXE'K7Wp, iraFt- 0avowv, faEo--q.LPFporoq, raoTLoak, KCLXXtEy- Y7j9, rraCxuEy'yv7, XaE4prrpov, XarTp6ok, Xattrrpav- yrg.57 The glare (actyXrq) of the sun, its strong rays (acyat~ -EXVoLO, dK71VE9), and its glistening light (Xa/Crrpyv cLdoa 7)EXloLo) are all adequately con- veyed by the image in the Tomb of the Bulls.58 The image of the sun in the Troilos scene, then, is appropriate not only in terms of the mythological context as we know it from Greek sources, but also coincides with recognized Etruscan representations of Usil/Helios and Apollo. The sun disk in the tomb fresco lacks the face or human body visible in the Greek and Etruscan representations cited, but this discrepancy-actually a realistic refinement -can be explained by the difference in scale. In the fresco panel, with its expansive, detailed representa- tion of the two direct participants in the event, the ambush covert, the fountain and the symbolic palm, the overt personification of Helios/Apollo would have been jarring and out of place. On the mirrors it is necessary for clarity, while on the Francois vase it is appropriate to the pedantic mythographi- cal tenor of the whole pot. In addition, a simple, cosmic image of the god is appropriate to Etruscan religious beliefs. Although the figure of Apollo is inextricably connected with the Troilos story in Greek myth, his representation here in the aspect of Helios is also appropriate for more subtle reasons, related to the symbolism of death and dying. The connection of the setting sun with human death (in this case Troilos's) is a natural one, but in the context of the Etruscan religion, with its large component of celes- tial interpretation and its emphasis on the under- world, the image must have had extraordinary power."5 As the sun sets, a man dies: this is the principle of universal cosmic sympathy on which the Etruscan science of hepatoscopy was founded.60 In addition, the west, in which the sun sets, ap- pears in the system of Martianus Capella, which re- flects Etruscan cosmology in a number of impor- tant aspects, as the region of the Manes." The Libri Acherontici and Libri Haruspicini must have been filled with ritual interpretations corresponding to the spirit of the Troilos fresco."6 Conversely, the sun in its unimpaired state has constituted the sym- 54Arias (supra n. 45) 27-37, pl. 9, Iia, i3b. 55 Giuliano (supra n. 15) 8, 9-o10 n. 3. 56 D.

Gaster makes the point that the festivals of the different seasons in many cultures are made to coincide with the solstice or equinox, because the sun then truly be- gins to increase or decline in force, just as the productivity of the world does." In this respect it is important to note the subject of the low rectan- gular panel which forms the dado below the Troi- los scene. Nine trees (the trunks of three have faded away)"6 in varying stages of growth and foliation (the leaves on two of them have faded) are arrayed with a wreath and three taeniae-either the embellishments of festival or the ornaments of death. The variations in size and lushness among the trees may signify the turning cycle of the sea- sons, forming an apt parallel to the cycle of life and death witnessed by Apollo in his Thymbraian sanc- tuary. In the Iliad and elsewhere in Greek myth both Apollo and Helios are connected with the care and supervision of the dead. In book XVI of the Iliad (vv. 667-83) Apollo is put in charge of the re- moval of the corpse of Sarpedon from the battle- field, a duty which formally should have been as- signed to Hermes Psychopompos,67 while in book XXIV (vv. 18-21) he protects the body of Hector from decay and the impious anger of Achilles. The Greek Helios, since he saw the whole face of the Earth by day, then passed beneath it by night, was also considered to have close connections with the underworld.68 After the disappearance of Perseph- one, for example, Demeter turned to Helios to learn her whereabouts; it is no coincidence that she was held in the world of the dead rather than that of the living.6" In many contexts Helios can even be seen as a true god of the dead, since he holds the keys to the gates through which men go to the underworld and spirits return to the world above. In one source, Helios and Selene are identified with at iaKpWv vonoL'.70 Since Osiris was the Egyptian god of the dead, Mfiller's connection of the name Usil with Osir and thus Osiris may have some sub- stance.71 In the light of this etymology it is strik- ing to note the title of "Osiris" given to Helios/ Apollo by John Lydus, whose De Mensibus and De Ostentis are replete with survivals of Etruscan thought: '"HXtog 'ftpoq "Ootptqs vaf Atos vi~X 'AIrXXWV.72 The curious erotic groups in the frieze above the mythological scene in the Tomb of the Bulls, not yet satisfactorily explained, are actually an integral part of a darker aspect of the Troilos story.73 Ac- cording to a number of traditions, Achilles was pursuing the youth out of love, not battle-lust, and his death resulted either from a brutal rape or from a more conventional expression of wrath by his unrequited lover. This version is embodied most clearly in Servius: Troili amore Achillem ductum palumbes ei quibus ille delectabatur obiecisse, quas cum vellet tenere, captus ab Achille in eius amplexibus periit. Sed hoc quasi indignum heroo carmine mutavit po- eta.74 63 Iliad XVI.I88; see also Iliad IV.44, V.2o and Odyssey IV.54o, 833. For dying: Iliad XVIII.i1. 64 Supra n. 29. 65 T.

Lawrence (supra n. 3) 114-15, 123 relates his guide's interpretation of the erotic scenes and the reaction of the two bulls: a bull attacks the homosexual group because it is "un po' di pornografico," while the heterosexual group is not molested because it is not "porno- grafico." This same explanation is offered to visitors today. The heterosexual label for the group on the left, however, may not be completely correct, because the artist's preliminary sketch strongly suggests that he intended the male supporting the woman to be engaged in fellatio with another male reclin- ing on the ground in front of him; see Giuliano (supra n. 15) I 1-12, fig. II. Designation of the groups as "apotropaic," e.g. Ducati (supra n. 31) I p. 223, is insufficient. 7 Servius, Ad Aeneidem 1.474, ed. E.K. Rand et al. (Lan- caster 1946) II, pp. 219-20.

Another version of the episode depicts Achilles pulling at the youthful Troilos, who clings to a tree beside the altar of Apollo, forming a scene very similar to a contem- porary shield-band narrating the equally brutal rape of Kassandra by Ajax. In view of this tradition, the symplegmata in the Tomb of the Bulls (that on the right probably involving two males and the other two males and one female) were possibly intended as an enthusiastic mythological footnote to the decorous scene in the central panel. The two bulls (one of them man-faced) in the same frieze could in this case correspond to the sacred bulls of the god Helios, alternately vigilant and angry at this recreation of the impious deed committed in the sanctuary." Kunze feels that this version origi- nated in Doric choral lyrics rather than the Epic Cycle, but if the tentative interpretation proposed above is correct, the artist of the Tomb of the Bulls must have been familiar with both sources."7 Al- though the overt fertility aspect of these sympleg- mata is primarily connected with the erotic version of the death of Troilos, it is also appropriate in relation to the generative image of Helios/Apollo as the source of life on earth. The connection of the sun with the cycle of the seasons has already been mentioned. Furthermore, in Martianus Capella's system Vulcan (meaning Sol) is assigned the epi- thet "Terrae Pater" and associated with Genius ("the creative power of man"), Ceres, and Tellu- rus, a god apparently related to the vegetative pow- er of the earth."8 The question of the form in which Greek myth reached sixth-century Etruria, a question to which Hampe and Simon were unable to give a convinc- ing reply, can be answered with some confidence in the case of the Tomb of the Bulls. Although we know that the Troilos incident remained popular and was reworked in drama and verse from the fifth century onward, the brief, laconic passage from Proclus's Chrestomathy quoted above is the only evidence still extant for the form it took in the Kypria." Nevertheless, the details of the fresco in the Tomb of the Bulls which have been discussed above strongly suggest that this sixth-century artist was familiar with a literary source, which at this period would probably have been the Kypria itself. Since the striking image of the setting sun does not occur on any of the Greek or Etruscan vase-paint- ings dealing with Troilos, it is unlikely that it could have been copied by the artist from icono- graphical sources. If Apollo's presence or involve- ment is indicated at all in these vase-paintings, it is only by means of a vigilant crow, which could have been metamorphosized into a setting sun only in the presence of literary sources. The figure of Apollo himself appears on the Francois vase, but his transformation from anthropomorphic god to symbolic sun disk would have required more than the unaided action of the artist's imaginaton and astrological religious beliefs.

Compare C. Bethe, Homer, Dichtung und Sage II (Leipzig/Berlin 1922) 241. 80 In Regio V, Weinstock (supra n. 6o) 112. Although the cosmic body depicted in the fresco is the sun, the resemblance of the motif to "rosy-fingered Dawn" cannot have been over- looked. In connection with the erotic element it is important to note the early fifth-century Etruscan mirror in the Vatican which shows Aurora carrying off Kephalos: Gerhard (supra n. 40) II, p. i8o. The goddess's head, which is turned lovingly toward the boy in her arms, is surrounded by a rayed halo similar in design to the sun in the Tomb of the Bulls. On the generative power of the sun see Jessen (supra n. 45) 61; Rapp (supra n. 45) 2021-23. 81 For a defense of Proclus's reliability see Bethe (supra n. 79) 200-207.</page><page sequence="11">1975] GREEK MYTH AND ETRUSCAN IMAGERY 199 cient.82 The chronological value of the setting sun in the Iliad, together with the connection of Helios and Apollo with the dead in the Iliad, the Homeric Hymns, and elsewhere in Greek literature suggest instead that the artist borrowed the motif from the text of a literary counterpart to the Francois vase. In addition, the erotic element in the tomb fresco -possibly a part of the episode either in the Kypria or in lyric poetry-is not suggested by the visual tradition as embodied in the vase-paintings.83 Final- ly, the deep and sensitive understanding of the pathos of the incident-a jaunty, beautiful youth, a favorite among Priam's sons, cut down suddenly and unexpectedly by an irresistible enemy (or angry lover?)-is obvious in the handling of the fresco. Although this sympathy is not an overt part of the tradition in the Pontic amphorae, it is occa- sionally suggested by the Greek vase-painters, who were, of course, probably familiar with the literary background.84 Critics have been unwilling to accept the presence of Greek epics in sixth-century Etruria, but the iconographical background of the Troilos story has been shown to be inadequate to account fully for the fresco in the Tomb of the Bulls. In addition, a paraphrase of the incident, available to the artist either in a Greek or an Etruscan version, could not have preserved all the details and innuendos in- cluded in the tomb fresco. The chronological value of the setting sun, which may have been part of the event in the Kypria, would not have found mention in a summary of this sort, and even the involvement of Apollo could have easily escaped notice."5 The artist, while directly familiar with a major Greek text of the Troilos story, altered the dramatis personae to include only the two most important, striking characters, consequently allow- ing dramatic concentration on the predator and his victim. Only the symbol of Helios/Apollo appears besides, meant both to tie in this one event with the rest of the saga and to emphasize the cosmic significance of the contest. The development of Apollo's involvement in the Troilos story into an iconographical symbol which universalizes the event is the specific contribution of the Etruscan artist."8 In the Iliad (as presumably in the imitative Kypria) fate and death are im- personal patterns and events which take on human interest only in the reactions they elicit from the heroes involved with them. Realization of this fact is behind Achilles' depression and pessimism in book IX: trq t/LOpa LEvovrTt, KatL Et Ad LXa rTL 7rTOXEttOL E U, Ta tL / jA'V KAKO \V 8E Ka\ L 0aE\ OS KrT8av" O~WG / ; " dEpy6O airqp 'TE r oXXh \opyMW.87 Since Achilles had chosen his own manner of life -to be a glorious warrior and die young rather than to live in safe obscurity-the responsibility for the choice rests on him alone (book IX.4io-i6). In contrast, the Etruscan was surrounded by a physical world deeply involved in his fate, and portents multiplied convincingly at any crisis: Hoc inter nos et Tuscos, quibus summa est ful- gurum persequendorum scientia, interest: nos putamus, quia nubes collisae sunt, fulmina emitti; ipsi existimant nubes collidi ut fulmina emittan- tur; nam, cum omnia ad deum referent, in ea opinione sunt tamquam non, quia facta sunt, significent, sed quia significatura sunt, fiant."8 82 Schefold (supra n. 17) 74, 96, 97. 83 It is at least possible that the Pontic amphora in Reading which shows Achilles carrying off Troilos on his shoulders alludes to the love motif; see Ure (supra n. 17) pl. 44a. 84 Direct knowledge of Greek literary texts by the artists who painted the Pontic amphorae has not been proven, but one of the more convincing sections in Hampe and Simon's book concerns a scene on a Pontic amphora in the Metropolitan Museum (no. 557) which they interpret as Eris among the three jealous goddesses at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, an otherwise unparalleled illustration from the Kypria (supra n. 4) 40. Note also Cook (supra n. 4) 98-99; Boardman (supra n. 4) 241; Brommer (supra n. 4) 280; Camporeale (supra n. 4) 442-43. Robertson (supra n. 19) 14 interprets the scene of Polyxena's death on the Pontic amphora in the Louvre as a detailed reproduction of the version told in the Kypria. The direct knowledge of Greek myth has also been proposed for the painter of the Caeretan hydriae: N. Platouine, "La repre- sentation de Thersite par le peintre des Hydries dites de Caere et les sources litt&amp;raires qui ont inspire cet artiste," REG 55 (1942) 161-89. But since this artist was probably a Greek immigrant, his knowledge of Greek literary texts has no direct bearing on the artist who painted the Tomb of the Bulls or the individuals working on the Pontic amphorae. Santangelo in EAA 2 (I959) 514 s.v. "Ceretane, Idrie" denies that the painter of the hydriae had any direct knowledge of the texts. 85 Both the sunset (if it actually was part of the passage in the Kypria) and mention of Apollo are omitted in Proclus's Chrestomathy. 86 Note Evelyn-White (supra n. 37) xxxi: "In the Cylic writers facts rather than character are the objects of interest, and events are so packed together as to leave no space for any exhibition of moral forces." 87 Iliad IX.3x8-20, ed. A.T. Murray (Cambridge, Mass. 1924) 404. 88 Seneca, Quaestiones Naturales 11.32.2, ed. T.H. Corcoran (Cambridge, Mass. 1971) 50o. Duimezil (supra n. 59) 648 in- terprets this comment as applying generally to, the contrast between science and the attitude of all religions.</page><page sequence="12">200 JOHN PETER OLESON [AJA 79 Both the city of Troy and the Etruscan nation were subject to the inalterable bonds of fate, but while the prowess of Achilles and the death of Hector were the signs of Troy's imminent destruction, the eight (or ten) saecula of Etruscan history were successively marked off by signs in the sky."89 To the artist of the Tomb of the Bulls, it was natural that a cosmic death-that of the setting sun-should precede and foretell that of a young prince. This sensitive and intelligent reworking of the myth in specifically local terms is an important characteristic of Etruscan art. The fresco reveals once again that the Etruscans were fascinated by Greek culture but received and adopted elements of it in a creative fashion, never submerging their own spiritual or aesthetic needs. Such an interpretation of the background of the Troilos fresco naturally presumes that the artist was able to read Greek. This is an unpopular de- duction,"9 but it is logical that some knowledge of at least colloquial Greek must have spread among the merchant class as soon as Greek traders began arriving with greater frequency in Etruria in the sixth century B.C. Greek and Etruscan merchants had to communicate, and it is more likely, in view of later Greek practice, that the Etruscans learned Greek than that the Greeks learned Etruscan. The depth and extent of this linguistic penetration, however, and its overall relation to the spread of actual literary texts, is difficult to judge. The artist working in the Tomb of the Bulls was familiar with the text of a Greek epic, but, as emphasized above, this tomb is unique in character. Arath Spuriana himself may have had special motives for requesting the mythological representation, but the precise reasons behind this special elaboration, as well as its ultimate relation to the Hellenization of Etruria, remain mysteries." It is, however, now clear that the iconography of the tomb's frescoes is not the result of promiscuous, unintelligent copy- ing of Greek vase-paintings.
