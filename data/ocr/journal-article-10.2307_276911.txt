<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOUTHERN CULT IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS* JAMES H. HOWARD RECENTLY RENEWED INTEREST has been focused upon the occurrence in the Plains area of the archaeological complex often termed the "Southern cult." This complex is found over a wide geographic area and in association with varied cultures. It occurs throughout the southeastern United States, and extends north and west along the Mis- sissippi and Missouri River valleys. It has been found in eastern South Dakota, eastern North Dakota, and in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan in Canada. The complex is characterized by specific art motifs and ceremonial objects, including mask- like whelk shell gorgets, and the cross, forked- eye, and hand-and-eye motifs. The complex was apparently fundamentally dependent upon a horticultural base, and is associated in nearly every case with platform mounds. Sites often thought of in connection with the Southern cult are Etowah (Georgia), Moundville (Ala- bama), and Spiro (Oklahoma). The author has recently examined materials in the collec- tions of the North Dakota State Historical Mu- seum for artifacts related to the complex. The Heimdal mound, from which much fine South- ern cult material was recovered, was also visited. The collections yielded materials from three sites in North Dakota, including the Heimdal mound, which are typically Southern cult in type. A spirally decorated pot from a mound near Montpelier, North Dakota, is identical with those found in association with Southern cult materials in sites in North and South Dakota and Canada, though no typically Southern cult material was found in associa- tion with it. Vessels from the Wray mound, near Lisbon, North Dakota, on display in the North Dakota State Historical Museum and excavated by E.A. Milligan, are identical in size, shape and lip decoration with the spirally decorated vessels of the Southern cult bearing culture, though the spiral groove decoration is replaced with a design reminiscent of the * For advice and assistance on copper and sinew, we are indebted to Floyd Roberts of the North Dakota State Laboratories Department, Bismarck and to Roy W. Drier, Michigan College of Mining and Technology, Houghton, Michigan. Southern cult hand-and-eye motif. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the material from the first four sites mentioned above and tentatively to define the Southern cult bearing culture of the Northern Plains. None of the Southern cult material in the North Dakota State Historical Museum was collected by trained personnel. In only one case do we have a stratigraphic diagram of the mound or site (Heimdal). The material is merely presented for what it may be worth in defining the Southern cult complex and the culture which bears it in the Northern Plains. THE HEIMDAL MOUND The Heimdal mound is located in the NE/4 of Sec 23, T 150, R 70, about 3 miles northeast of the village of Heimdal, in Wells County, North Dakota. This area is typical of the poorly drained glaciated terrain characteristic of much of Minnesota and eastern North and South Dakota. The mound itself is located on the summit of a high hill, the highest within a 10 mile radius. The mound was excavated in 1930, by Joel A. Johnson and Oscar E. Johnson. At that time the mound had recently become popular with local relic hunters, who threatened to ruin it completely. The Johnson brothers, in- terested in salvaging what information they could before the mound was destroyed, wrote the State Historical Society for instructions. Having no archaeologist available for the work at that time, the Historical Society asked the Johnson brothers to undertake the work FIG. 47.

Triangles show ap- proximate locations of sites. 130</page><page sequence="2">THE SOUTHERN CULT IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS themselves, which they did after securing the owner's consent. The land containing the mound was owned by Peter J. Myhre at the time of the excavation in 1930. It is now (1953) owned by Andrew Larson, of Maddock, North Dakota. Although neither of the broth- ers had had any archaeological training, they did a creditable job of excavation. The ma- terial recovered, and the maps which were made, are now in the collections of the North Dakota State Historical Museum. The mound is approximately 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet 9 inches in elevation. It is composed of earth and stone from the sur- rounding area. The following items were re- covered from the mound (the numbers given are the museum accession numbers). 4307 Collar (?) of elk antler in two pieces 4308 Eagle bone whistle 4309 Straight catlinite pipe 4310 Fragment of a mussel shell 4311 Fossil horn coral fragment 4312 Whelk shell gorget 4313 Whelk shell gorget 4314 Spiral bead or pendant of whelk shell 4315 Spiral bead or pendant of whelk shell 4316 Six potsherds 4317 Fragmentary human skull (missing) 4318 Fragmentary human skull 4319 Human calvarium, vertebra, right and 4320 left pelvic bones, sacrum, right and left femora, right tibia, left scapula, left humerus, right radius, and right and left fibulae Human calvarium 4321 Fragment of a bison skull, four teeth, scapula, five ribs, fragment of a verte- bral spine, fragment of a caudal ver- tebra, two unidentifiable bone frag- ments, and a fragment of a human femur (this presumably belongs with 4317, 4318, or 4320) 4322 Skull of a skunk 4307 Collar (?) of elk antler in two pieces. This object has been called a "collar," though it may have served a very different purpose. Fragments of what appear to be similar or related objects, found in Canada and North Dakota, are pictured by Montgomery (1906, pl. 34, opp. p. 648; and 1908, p. 37), who calls them "bone anklets." The Heimdal objects are of a size and shape which would have allowed them, when laced together, to be used as a collar. Each sec- tion measures 270 mm. maximum length x 135 mm. maximum width. The two sections are bilaterally symmetrical in form and decora- tion. This collar was apparently made by cutting and molding thin sections of elk antler while it was still green and pliable. Small holes, such as could be used for lacing, are drilled at either end of each piece. Additional holes, two through the middle section and one on the lower margin of each piece were prob- ably used for attaching ornaments. Each section of the collar has a realistic drawing of a bison incised upon it. These bison are done in a distinctive angular style, with diamond shaped eyes and an arrow shaped "line of life" extending from the ani- mal's nose to the center of his body. This line of life is probably a representation of the throat, lungs, and heart of the animal. A similar, but smaller scale attempt to represent the animal's interior occurs at the anus. This convention for representing an animal's inner organs persisted in Indian art into historic times. Each section of the collar, in addition to the bison drawing, has a geometric border design consisting of a deeply incised line, in some places cut so deeply as to go entirely through the collar, within which triangles are incised. Similar triangles occur on one of the "bone anklets" figured by Montgomery (1906, pl. 34, opp. p. 648). The representation of the bison on this collar is strikingly similar in style to a bison incised on a catlinite tablet recovered by Montgomery from a mound in North Dakota (1906, pl. 32, opp. p. 644). 4308 Eagle bone whistle. This whistle is made of an eagle wing bone, Aquila chrysaetos Canadensis. It measures 217 mm. in length and 13 mm. is the average diameter. A tri- angular hole is cut near the proximal end. The whistle is similar in every respect to those used at the present time by Plains tribes in the sun dance and peyote ceremonies. 4309 Straight catlinite pipe. This pipe re- sembles a present day cigar holder. It meas- ures 217 mm. in length. The diameter of the pipe at the larger end is 22 mm., and at the smaller end 17 mm. A charred cake, presum- ably tobacco, is still present about the larger end of the pipe. Pipes similar to this one were 131 HOWARD ]</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY found by Montgomery in mounds in North Dakota (1906, pl. 33, opp. p. 646) and Canada (1908, pl. 4, opp. p. 36). 4310 Fragment of a mussel shell. This shell is of the genus Unio. It measures 70 x 50 mm. Finds of Unio shell in mounds are reported by Montgomery in Canada and North Dakota (1906; 1908). 4311 Fossil horn coral fragment. This con- sists of a fossil fragment of the horn coral Hapsiphyllum calcariforme, including the calyx. The fragment measures 50 x 30 mm. It is prob- ably Ordovician or Silurian in age. It may have been kept as a "medicine" stone by one of the persons buried in the Heimdal mound. 4312 Whelk shell gorget. This gorget is made from a pear shaped section of the outer whorl of the shell of a whelk, Fulgur perversum L. It is obviously intended to represent the face of a human or an anthropomorphic bird. It measures 162 mm. in length x 128 mm. maxi- mum width. It is definitely Southern cult in type and has the weeping eye motif. The gor- get is slightly fractured on the lower left edge. On the reverse of the gorget is a scratched drawing of an elk with the same diamond shaped eye used in the drawing of the bison on the elk antler collar (4307). Four smaller designs, resembling designs used by Indians in historic times to represent stars, also occur on the back of the gorget. 4313 Whelk shell gorget. This gorget, like 4312, is made from a pear shaped section of the outer whorl of a whelk shell. It has a deep scallop cut from the top, but is otherwise near- ly identical in form and face decoration with 4312. The gorget measures 162 mm. in length x 128 mm. maximum width. The lower left edge of the gorget is slightly fractured. The weeping eye motif occurs on the face of the gorget and scratched drawings are found on the reverse side. These drawings are so faint as to be almost undetectable unless the object is moved slightly from side to side under good light. One of the drawings may be a rep- resentation of a swallow or some other bird in flight. 4314 Spiral bead or pendant of whelk shell. This ornament is made from the core or axis of the shell of a whelk, Fulgur perversum L. The object measures 168 mm. in length x 13 mm. maximum diameter. Holes are drilled, apparently for suspending the object, at either end. 4315 Spiral bead or pendant of whelk shell. This ornament is similar to 4314. It is 205 mm. in length and has a maximum diameter of 15 mm. Holes are drilled at either end, appar- ently for suspending the object, and one end is grooved, probably for the same purpose, in addition. 4316 Potsherds. These six potsherds were the only ceramic material found in the Heim- dal mound. They are all body sherds. The average thickness of these sherds is 7 mm. They are grit tempered, of medium texture, with a hardness of from 3-4. They are uniformly reddish-gray in color. Five of the sherds are fairly smooth, inside and out, and show signs of having been wiped with a handful of damp- ened grass prior to firing. The sixth sherd is smooth on the inside but shows a heavy bas- ketry or textile impression on the outer surface. 4318 Fragmentary human skull. Only the sub-orbital and alveolar regions are present. The skull seems to be that of an adult male. The skull has an impacted (?) tooth in the center of the palate near the intermaxillary suture. The teeth are large and well worn. 4319 Human calvarium, vertebra, right and left pelvic bones, sacrum, right and left femora, right tibia, left scapula, left humerus, right radius, and right and left fibulae. All of these bones presumably belong to the skeleton of one individual. According to the maps prepared by the Johnson brothers, burials 4319 and 4320 were found in the humus below the mound, which represents the original surface of the hilltop. They were found one foot below the surface of this original topsoil, or three and one-half feet beneath the surface of the top of the mound. This seems to indicate that the mound was built after the burial took place. The bones are quite obviously those of an elderly man. The cephalic index of the skull is 80.2 (brachycephalic). 4320 Human calvarium. This skull is also that of an old man. The cephalic index is 71.3 (dolichocephalic). 4321 Fragment of bison skull, four teeth, scapula, five ribs, fragment of vertebral spine, fragment of caudal vertebra, two unidentifiable bone fragments, and a fragment of a human femur (this presumbly belongs with 4317, 4318, 132 [ 2, 1953</page><page sequence="4">THE SOUTHERN CULT IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS or 4320). None of these bones are worked. Presumably they were recovered in the mound fill, and not buried in the original surface of the hill as were the human burials 4319 and 4320. 4322 Skull of a skunk. This is the skull of a skunk, Mephitis mephitis, an animal common in North Dakota at the present time. The pro- venience of this skull is not indicated on either of the maps prepared by the Johnson brothers. Presumably it was recovered in the mound fill and may well be intrusive. THE BENTZ GORGETS Little is known of the provenience of these gorgets except that they were found eroding out of the bank of Long Lake Creek, five miles south and one and one-half miles west, T 136, R 76, of Moffit, North Dakota, in 1930. They were loaned to the North Dakota State His- torical Museum by Agnes Bentz of Moffit on September 8, 1930, and are cataloged with the museum loan accession number L236. L236a Whelk shell gorget. This gorget, like those found in the Heimdal mound, is made from a pear shaped section of the outer whorl of the shell of a whelk, Fulgur perversum L. It is virtually identical in form and shape with the Heimdal gorgets, and has the weeping eye motif on its face. It measures 190 mm. in length x 140 mm. maximum width. On the reverse side there are traces of scratched draw- ings but these are now nearly obscured due to the disintegration of the shell. A slight copper stain is present on the reverse of the gorget. L236b Whelk shell gorget. This specimen is quite similar to L236a. No weeping eye motif is detectable on the face of the gorget at the present time, but since the surface of the shell is quite flaky, even a deeply incised design could have powdered away. The specimen measures 180 mm. in length x 165 mm. maxi- a FIG. 48. a, detail of incised drawing of bison from the Heimdal "collar," 4307; b, drawing on reverse of Heimdal gorget, 4312; c, drawing on reverse of Heimdal gorget, 4313; d, drawing on reverse of Bentz gorget L236a; e, draw- ing on reverse of Bentz gorget L236c; f, incised decoration on face of Doerr gorget; d is 71/2 inches long. 133 HOWARD ]</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mum width. Scratched drawings appear to have been present on the reverse of the gorget at one time but have been obliterated by the disintegration of the shell. A slight copper stain is present on the reverse. L236c Whelk shell gorget. This gorget is similar in most respects to L236a and L236b and to the Heimdal gorgets. It measures 170 mm. in length x 137 mm. maximum width. No weeping eye motif is discernible on the face of the gorget but such a design may well have been obscured by flaking of the shell's surface. On the reverse of the gorget are two scratched drawings. One of these is clearly a horse. The other was probably a bear, although its head has now been obliterated by the disintegration of the shell. A slight copper stain is also pres- ent on the gorget's reverse. Naturally the discovery of a representation of a horse on a gorget of a supposedly prehis- toric type occasioned a great deal of interest at the time the gorget was found. The gorget was immediately sent to Clark Wissler, then at the American Museum of Natural History, for study and comment. Wissler's reply indi- cates that he believed the gorget to be of late historic origin. This idea was based, appar- ently, almost entirely on the presence of the horse pictograph. L236d Copper lining for gorget. This is a very thin piece of sheet copper, used as a "lin- ing" on the reverse side of one of the three gorgets described above. It measures 120 mm. maximum length x 90 mm. maximum width. It is slightly curved to fit the inside of the gor- get and has a perforation for attaching it to the gorget near one corner. An analysis of this specimen and specimen L236e revealed a copper content of 99.9% ? 0.1. Due to the size of the specimens it was not possible to determine the identity of the other minerals or impurities present without destroying them completely. The copper is probably native, since copper as mined is fre- quently purer than after smelting (i.e. Euro- pean trade copper). L236e Copper lining for gorget. This sheet of copper is larger and more complete than L236d. It measures 145 mm. maximum length x 111 mm. maximum width. It clearly served as a lining for one of the whelk shell gor- gets described above. It has four perforations around the outer margin, probably for attach- ing it to the gorget. In the center of the piece a slot has been cut, and a small additional strip of copper inserted and bent over on each side, as if to simulate the nose on a face. FIG. 49.

A small piece of sinew was found with the gorgets and copper, undoubt- edly serving to fasten one of the gorgets to its copper lining. THE DOERR GORGET The Doerr gorget (Museum catalog No. 10760) was found on Shell Butte, in Logan County, North Dakota. It was purchased by the North Dakota State Historical Society from John Allen Doerr of Napoleon, North Dakota, in 1947. We have no other information rela- tive to the gorget. The gorget is made from the outer whorl of a whelk shell but is circular, rather than pear shaped, and has a scalloped edge. It measures an average of 100 mm. in diameter. In the center of the gorget is a cut out triskelion, or three-limbed design. Four small holes, in pairs, are drilled near the margin of the shell, and were undoubtedly used for suspending the gorget. A fine, typically Southern cult design is in- cised on the concave surface of the gorget. This is probably a conventionalized rattlesnake. The gorget is virtually identical in design with two gorgets pictured by Holmes in his "Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans" (Holmes, 1883, P1. 54, opp. p. 274; P1. 55, opp. p. 276). Both of the gorgets pictured by Holmes were found in mounds near Nashville, Tennessee. THE MONTPELIER MOUND MATERIAL This material consists of a spirally decorated pottery vessel, nearly complete (Museum cata- log No. L389), two fragments of wood, a scrap of hide, and a small piece of copper. Although no typically Southern cult artifacts were found in association with this material, Montgomery found similar pottery in association with South- ern cult material in North Dakota and Canada FIG. 51.

The vessel and associated material were lent to the State Historical Museum in 1931 by Dana Wright, of St. John, North Dakota. A rather cryptic information card in the museum files supplies the only information regarding the material and the mound in which it was found. The card reads: Indian pottery found six feet under ground under a mound near Montpelier, N. Dak. by Bunny Reed.* Inside the dish was found a dried scrap of buckskin wrapped around some fragments of copper ore. Scraps of decayed wood were found in the bottom of the mound and an arrow point which shows the action of fire. There were indications that there had been a fire possibly for cremation or other ceremony and that the mound had been built up over the place after. The card is signed "Dana Wright." The pot is probably part of a funeral offer- ing. It has a maximum body diameter of 115 mm. and measures 95 mm. at the mouth of the vessel. It is 90 mm. tall. The average thickness of the vessel is 5 mm. The ware is grit tempered, of fine texture, and has a hard- ness of 4.5. It is reddish-gray in color. * The identity of "Bunny Reed" has not yet been ascertained. He or she is presumably a local amateur. The form of the vessel approaches a globe, but is cut off three-fourths of the way to the top by the short neck and rim (20 mm. in height). The neck is flared very slightly. The rim has a line decoration on its lip which is broken by dots where two small lugs, on oppo- site sides of the rim, are present. On one side of the vessel this incised lip decoration is filled with red paint. A spiral groove decoration, starting at the bottom of the vessel, winds around it in a continuous line to the neck. The vessel apparently contained some food or liquid at one time, since traces of some material still coat the inside. Within the pot are two small pieces of wood, measuring 60 mm. x 20 mm. x 10 mm., and 25 mm. x 15 mm. x 7 mm., respectively. These are presumably some of the "scraps of decayed wood" which were found "in the bottom of the mound," and were not in the vessel when it was found. They may represent wood from a log burial vault. A dried scrap of hide, 50 mm. x 40 mm., and a small flat piece of copper 13 mm. x 10 mm., also in the vessel, are pre- sumably those found there when the pot was recovered. A few remarks concerning the artistic motifs and cultural resemblances of the above de- scribed material may be pertinent at this point. We are dealing, it seems, with a fairly homo- b FIG. 53.

This northern mani- festation may be either a peripheral extension of the Southern cult civilizations or an echo in a neighboring culture which had consider- able trade with southeastern groups and thus acquired the use of whelk shell gorgets, mound building, and other traits. The Southern cult bearing culture of the Northern Plains, represented by the Heimdal and Montpelier mounds and the mounds exca- vated in North Dakota, South Dakota, Mani- toba, and Saskatchewan by Montgomery seems to be characterized by the following traits: mound building, burial in mounds or raising of mounds above burials, use of copper, bison hunting, utilization of molluscs, use of whelk shell gorgets of Southern cult type, scratched drawings on the back of these gorgets, use of pendants or beads made from the spiral axes of whelk shells, use of straight "cigar holder" shaped catlinite pipes, use of incised catlinite tablets, and use of elk antler "collars" and/or "anklets" with incised designs. Art motifs which appear to be characteristic are: bilateral symmetry in much of art work, incision of cer- tain "key" lines so deeply as to. completely penetrate the object being decorated, "line of life" conventionalization on many animal rep- resentations, frequent use of a diamond shaped figure to represent the eye of an animal, tiny legs on animal representations in comparison to the other parts depicted, and characteristic rectangular bodies on animal representations (see illustrations). The Heimdal collar and gorgets and the Bentz gorgets seem to be clearly affiliated. All of the gorgets not only have the same form but also have scratched drawings on the re- verse which are similar in style. It seems fairly obvious that the bison drawings on the elab- orate Heimdal collar are of the same cultural tradition as the scratched drawings of the elk on the reverse of the Heimdal gorget 4312, and the bison on the catlinite tablet figured by Montgomery (1906, pl. 32, opp. p. 644). Fur- thermore the diamond shaped eye convention, found on both the Heimdal bison drawings and the elk drawing, is common on typical South- ern cult artifacts from the Southeast. The scratched drawings on the back of the Heimdal and Bentz gorgets do not seem to be done as well as the fine "bird men" and wood- peckers seen on the best Southeastern work, yet the bilateral symmetry seen on the Heim- dal collar, the use of the diamond shaped eye convention, and the technique of incising cer- tain lines so deeply as to completely pierce the object decorated are all typical Southern cult features. The horse on the Bentz gorget L236c, can- not, in the author's opinion, be written off as "a later addition by some wandering Plains Indian who picked up the gorget." It is too similar in style and treatment to the bear ap- pearing on the same gorget, to the elk on the Heimdal gorget 4312, and to the bison draw- ings on the Heimdal collar and on the catlinite tablet found by Montgomery. It seems rather unlikely that all of the gorgets found thus far would have similar drawings scratched on their reverse sides, all done by "some wandering Plains Indian who picked up the gorget" in late historic times. We are therefore forced into one of three conclusions: (a) The animal represented is not a horse. (b) Horses were known in North America at a much earlier date than is now sus- pected. (c) The Southern cult bearing culture of the Northern Plains is protohistoric in age, in the Dakotas and Canada. In the author's opinion the last conclusion seems to be the best. This should occasion no surprise, since peripheral extensions of culture complexes often supersede their abandonment in the country of origin by many years. A modern example of this phenomenon is the peyote cult, which has been on the decline in Mexico for more than 100 years, but is only now reaching certain Indian tribes in Canada and the eastern United States. Obviously, much work is needed in this area on materials relating to the Southern cult- bearing culture. The author would particularly like to know if scratched drawings occur on the reverse sides of Southern cult gorgets found elsewhere, particularly in the Southeast.

North Dakota State Historical Museum Bismarck, North Dakota February, 1953 AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE IN SOUTH-CENTRAL QUEBEC, 1950 EDWARD S. ROGERS AND ROGER A. BRADLEY DURING THE SUMMER of 1950, from June through August, the authors made an archaeological reconnaissance in south- central Quebec. All traveling was done by canoe.* This work was made possible by grants from the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology, Andover, Massachusetts and from Stephen Phillips of Salem, Massachusetts. The survey was started at Senneterre, Que- bec (Fig. 54) and carried northward by way of Lac Parent and the Bell River to Lake Mat- * Canoe travel in south-central Quebec presents many difficulties. Without the cooperation and hospitality of the people living and working in the country, travel would be greatly restricted. We are sorry that lack of space prevents us from mentioning by name everyone that helped us. To Hal Hollingsworth and Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Thierry, we are deeply indebted for their help and thoughtfulness during our few days spent at Lake Waswanipi. Also, we wish to thank Emmett Mc- Leod, Mr. and Mrs. George McLeod, and Mr. and Mrs. Wilfred Jeffreys, all of Lake Mistassini, for their gener- osity and hospitality. D. Eaton Cooter gave invaluable assistance in seeing that our equipment was taken care of and shipped home. We are sincerely grateful to Douglas S. Byers and Frederick Johnson of the Peabody Foundation for all the assistance they rendered us both before and after the trip. Both we and the Foundation wish to express our thanks to Stephen Phillips for his interest and generous help in making this trip a reality. tagami. At this point, we began working up- stream by way of the Waswanipi River to Lake Waswanipi, passing through Lakes Olga and Goeland. After spending a few days looking about Lake Waswanipi, we continued on our way to Lake Mistassini. The route took us through Lakes Puskitamika, Malouin, Lichen, and Opawica. We then ascended the Opawica River to Lakes Doda and Bras Coupe. From here, we crossed the height of land to Lac Presqu'ile and continued up the Obatogamau River to Lake Muscocho. Another height of land was then crossed to reach the Chibouga- mau River. Then passing through Lakes Dore, Chibougamau, and Waconichi, we arrived at the Hudson's Bay Company post on Lake Mis- tassini. Part way up the lake, a short side trip was made in the hope of locating a flint quarry that the Indians had mentioned in 1948. After leaving Lake Mistassini, we retraced our steps as far as Lake Chibougamau where we crossed to Lake Obatogamau and thence by way of small lakes to the Ducharme River and Lake Ashuapmuchuan. Crossing a height of land, we reached Lac Chigoubiche and the Chigoubiche River. We followed this river downstream to its junction with the Ashuap- muchuan River, and then descended to Big Bear Falls, some 12 miles from where the river 138 [ 2, 1953</page></plain_text>
