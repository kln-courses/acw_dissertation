I was exposed to museums from an early age and my curiosity and interest have since then straddled Indian traditional practices, on the one hand, and the Western museum, with its representation of material culture, on the other. I had viewed displays of Hindu gods and goddesses in several museums in India, including the National Museum in New Delhi and the Prince ofWales Museum in Mumbai,1 and in the past decade I have also examined their display in museums in the United Kingdom. The transition from being treated as living entities in multisensory settings, to being represented as ethnographic or art objects - displayed to be viewed - poses a range of ontological problems, which I have examined through my art practice. The overarching theme of my work is a critique of the recontextualization of artefacts and architecture from their original settings into new environments and the subsequent shift in their meanings and reception. For instance, in 2002 to 2003 I made a series of videos that examined the roles and functions of Indian monuments in the contemporary British landscape. One of the pieces explored the journey to the Chattri - known locally as the 'pepperpoť or 'pepperbox', an Indian war memorial located in the South Downs north of Brighton. Through the use of sound and image, a narrative unfolded over a period of time in the space. The work was designed to be projected on to the monument itself, allowing visitors to reflect on their own journeys to the heritage site. My artworks emerge from site-specific situations, and their meanings are further developed through the audience's interaction with them. This especially holds true for the 'From Shrine to Plinth' project, which I developed in my practice-based research between 2004 and 2008. From Shrine to Plinth , an exhibition of video, installation, and three- dimensional artworks in the 'Space C' gallery in the Museum of Croydon at the Croydon Clocktower in 2008, examined the shift in the meanings and reception of Hindu deities when they are relocated from a religious setting into 110</page><page sequence="2">From Shrine to Plinth the secular museum environment. The Croydon Museum houses a collection of Hindu deities and worshipping accoutrements, which belonged to local resident Maya Chakraborti. The exhibition was designed to be experienced as a liminal space within the museum building and was visually linked with Maya Chakraborti's shrine by a trail of red dots, enabling visitors to navigate between the two spaces for a first-hand experience of the dialectical study. Conceptually, the Clocktower functioned as a discursive space where, through the artworks, non-material qualities of deities were explored and the dialectics of the ocular museum space compared to the multisensory temple environment. The work explored concepts of temple and museum rituals, and conservation and cyclical time-cycles. Largely interactive, one of the functions of the exhibition was to generate ritualistic behaviour amongst the audience, thus leading to the revelation of the dialectics of temple and museum meanings of Hindu deities in the space. The exhibition formed a crucial part of my practice-led art research. From Shrine to Plinth In their important article 'The Universal Survey Museum', Carol Duncan and Allan Wallach (1980) critically compared public museums with traditional ceremonial buildings such as palaces, temples, and churches. In their essay they propose a similarity in architecture and consider them as spaces that prompt ritual. In particular, they examine the political agenda that underpinned the displays in the eighteenth-century Louvre and the internalizing of values of citizenship in the enactment of walking through the strategically arranged galleries and viewing one display after another. In her later seminal work Civilizing Rituals: Inside Public Art Museums, Carol Duncan reiterates the similarities between museums and religious spaces in appearance and function. She does not present museum buildings as neutral spaces - separate entities from their collections - but rather as an ensemble, as 'complex entities in which both art and architecture are parts of a larger whole' (Duncan 1995: 1). Duncan studies public museums as spaces that are designated for aesthetic contemplation and learning, demanding from the visitor a certain behavioural decorum. A museum's grand architecture attunes the visitors' minds so that they may better appreciate the works of art. The performer steps into a liminal space that marks the distinctness of appropriate activity from that of mundane daily life. Whilst these secular civilizing rituals highlight the performer's conformity with the iconographie programme created through the arrangement of objects in the building, they lead the performer through a visual experience to the material reality of the exhibit, such as its visual qualities, provenance, date of origin, function, and materials. Hence, the museum enhances the visual qualities of an object, what Světlana Alpers (1991) 111</page><page sequence="3">Megha Rajguru describes as the 'museum effect', a concept that is compared by Richard Davis in his book Lives of Indian Images (1997) with the 'temple effect'. Davis argues against the suggestion that there is only one kind of attentive viewing. He explains that audiences in the south Indian temples devoted to Shiva look at images of the deity attentively, but a visual experience is not their prime aim. Through conscious performance of rituals, maintaining temple etiquette, and enlivening the divinity, the gaze of the worshipper is focused on to the 'transvalued icon' (ibid.: 50). Davis explains that the physical form of the deity - for instance Vishnu's human appearance, holding a conch, and bearing a lotus navel - is paradoxical to its ethereal status as the transcendental absolute. The manifestation of the divine in avatars is important, however, as this allows worshippers to visualize and approach the otherwise incomprehensible divinity. He describes this theological phenomenon as being simultaneously 'transcendent and immanent' (ibid.). Temples and domestic shrines are multisensory settings where worshippers achieve closeness with gods through performance of regular rituals. These range from simple to complex: wakening the deity, bathing and anointing it, adorning it with fabrics and flowers, offering food and music, creating holy fires, chanting mantras, singing praises, and putting it to bed at night (see Fuller 1992: 57-72, see also Huyler 1999). Mark Elliott has discussed, in an earlier issue of this journal, the interaction between Indian visitors and the gods that are displayed in the Indian Museum, Kolkata. He too has examined Davis's comparison of the museum and temple effects (Elliott 2006: 64) and has highlighted a third type of phenomenon that occurred in the Indian Museum: a 'transgression' of the appropriate museum behaviour of viewing objectively from a distance, to a physical interaction with the object on display (ibid.: 67). In most cases, the actions of the visitors are perceived as 'devotional' by the museum staff. The 'temple effect' enters the museum setting, but the distinction between the secular and religious is blurred. In his critique of the inappropriate behaviour of the visitors, Elliott poses important questions about the identity of the deity in the secular setting: why should a god cease to become a god in the museum and why should it be treated any differently in its new setting (ibid.: 69)? The viewing of the image transcends its physicality in the temple setting so that the focus of the devotee is on its intangible qualities. The museum demands attentive viewing from its visitors towards the physical characteristics of the object on display, leading to a semiotic engagement with it - a secular approach and a pursuit of knowledge. Can a change in setting transform the attitude of the devotee towards the deity? Is the deity likely to be viewed as an art or ethnographic object by the worshipper as a result of its relocation? Would the response towards its museumized state be the result of an understanding of the unwritten rules of museum behaviour, in conformity with a museum ritual, as pointed out by Carol Duncan? The From Shrine to Plinth exhibition engaged with these issues, bringing the 'temple effect' into the 112</page><page sequence="4">From Shrine to Plinth contemporary British museum in order to offer visitors an alternative way of engaging with the deity on display. Whilst viewing the image in the temple is transcendental, the physical engagement with deities reveals that they are treated as divine persons rather than as inanimate objects (Davis 1997). 2 They are infused with divine energy by devotees, and are protected if there is danger of harm or abuse towards them. The treatment of the deity as a living entity is as strongly evident in the rites of death as in the creation and worship of the image. In case of deterioration, and wear and tear through worship, the deity is cremated, buried, or immersed in water, and the image in the temple replaced (ibid.: 127-8). Nagaswamy describes the procedures to be followed: When a stone image is damaged or broken, it should be covered with new cloth and tied with ropes made of darbha grass, and taken to a river flowing into an ocean or a lake or tank with perennial water, and after performing certain rites like 'angahoma' etc., and after removing the cloth one should deposit it in deep water. If it is a wooden image, it should be consigned to fire and the ashes should be immersed in water. (Nagaswamy no date) The practices of creating images for worship, infusing spirit into them through regular and correct rituals, and - ultimately - returning them to nature, also highlight the belief in the transient or ephemeral nature of physical form and the everlasting spirit of the deity, which is then infused in a new form. Furthermore, in the Hindu cosmological belief of the cyclical nature of life, creation, preservation, and destruction, gods as well as humans are born, die, and are reborn. Hence, whilst the physical presence of the deity is vital, its slow deterioration through worship (or use) is perceived as inevitable. When displayed in the museum, however, all efforts to arrest further deterioration of the image are applied. The aim of the museum is not to present a complete object in perfect condition similar to how it was when it was created, but to show its used state - an attestation of its authenticity (see Pearce 1992: 121). The surface of the object tells its tale as it contains 'all the visual and tactile information - the silhouette, the texture, the reflexivity, the colour and the decoration' (Ashley-Smith 1994: 17). The value of the object in its authentic state, accompanied by appropriate levels of conservation, gives it a resonance and longevity, which deems the artefact irreplaceable. Within the Hindu belief-system, the idea that through the performance of rituals any form or geometric shape can be infused with divine energy, suggests the interchangeability of images used for worship in Hindu temples and domestic shrines; it also reduces the epistemological significance of the Hindu idol within social history and ethnography. Ephemeral forms become divine and the deity is perceived as one of the many objects of worship. For example, Richard Blurton's description (1994: 9) of the concept of incarnation states that 113</page><page sequence="5">Megha Rajguru 'because the divine is indefinable, any one thing can be viewed as the temporal residence, body or symbol of the deity, just as well as anything else'. The representation of religiosity through objects is challenging, as the most spiritual and transcendental of concepts, which are at the core of the faith, cannot be presented through objects. Chris Arthur has posed a series of relevant questions: When it comes to exhibiting the sacred, a fundamental challenge is, quite simply, how do you picture the unpictureable; how do you mount a display about what, at root, is resistant to all forms of expression; how do you convey to visitors that what religions themselves see as of primary importance is something which lies beyond all the carefully assembled material which museums present for their scrutiny? (Arthur 2000: 2) It is remarkable that the practices surrounding the idols are highly rich in meaning, and offer insights into the semiotics of the deity. The object itself is at the centre of a good deal of the activity in the temple and within the domestic setting. The enactment of rituals and the temple architecture itself, which facilitates the ritual and the human-deity relationship, however, project belief more strongly than the autonomous idol removed from its original context and presented for visual scrutiny in the ocular museum setting. In practice, the deity's interpretation as a work of art, or as a symbol of its culture, becomes unavoidable, and its material characteristics take precedence. Hence, the accurate interpretation of worshipped Hindu gods and goddesses in the secular setting is problematic and challenging, as the focus remains on its material existence, which is of secondary importance in its religious context. The shift from the cyclical time pattern into a linear time-frame means that the deity experiences one extended lifetime in the museum, whereas in the temple it will ultimately mix with the earth, whereas its divinity, which is believed to survive, will be infused in a new form. The museum arrests time, whereas in the temple it is in a constant state of flux. Rationale At each stage of the project, my enquiry was led by art practice: from conceptualization, through making the artworks, to their exhibition in the museum setting. I explored the dialectics of the worshipped deity: non-material meanings were examined through gradual changes in the deity's physical form as a result of my interaction with the image, the interaction of the environment with its material, and finally with the responses of museum visitors towards it. The worshipped image was treated simultaneously as a conserved artefact in a vitrine, creating a dichotomy of material and spiritual ideologies. The nature of the interaction at each of these stages was, on the one hand, ritualistic and 114</page><page sequence="6">From Shrine to Plinth rooted in the religious practices of viewing the image, touching it for a transference of divinity, immersing it in water, and physically moving from one liminal space into another; on the other hand, the museum practices of classification, conservation, and object-handling sessions were commented upon. Hence, my examination of the contradictions between the religious (temple) and secular (museum) meanings of the deities in the exhibition created a third setting - a hybrid space that revealed the fragmented identity of the deity. In the 1980s the museum became an important site for postmodern artistic practices (see González 2001: 24). Artists such as Marcel Broodthaers, Fred Wilson, and Mark Dion created quasi-museum settings and took on the role of museum curator by engaging in activities such as classifying, arranging, and creating visual displays to formulate institutional critiques. Preceded by the art practices of Hans Haacke and Louise Lawler,3 which addressed the matrix of power and systems of representation, artists such as Fred Wilson, Sonia Boyce, and Mark Dion located their practices in the discursive museum site, the former two within the realm of race and identity and the latter within ecological conservation (see Putnam 2001). Inviting artists-in-residents to give 'voices' to collections, or to 'intervene' in museum spaces, has since become a common museum practice. In her account in an earlier issue of this journal of the work of artists-in-residence in the Pacific Encounters exhibition at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in 2006, Karen Jacobs describes the role of the three Pacific artists as 'living links' (Jacobs 2009: 112). The artists functioned as a bridge between Polynesian ancestry and heritage, with their own art practices, creating a link between the exhibition and its visitors. In the same issue, artist- in-residence Rosanna Raymond describes her art as a tool for engaging visitors and helping them think about the treasures on display in different ways; something that cannot be achieved through watching a documentary or reading a book (see Raymond and Jacobs 2009: 130-31). As an artist engaging with the museum space and appropriating it to present parallel interpretations of permanent collections of Hindu deities, my role was that of an interventionist. I too aimed to give a voice to the collections and to offer alternative interpretations of the Hindu gods on display. The exhibition From Shrine to Plinth, however, positioned the work in the museum space ideologically and physically, appropriating it to formulate a critique and to offer a new interpretation of the site itself, wherein the religious meanings of the deity were revealed in relation to the existing museum collection. Made in the studio, the artworks' role of examining the life and death of the deity in its displaced location was manifested upon their display, and through the audience's engagement with them. The dialogue between the artworks and museum display conventions: 'its stark walls, artificial lighting (no windows), controlled climate, and pristine architectonics' (Kwon 2004: 13),4 contained the change in the deity's meanings when it is removed from its multisensory 115</page><page sequence="7">Megha Rajguru shrine and displayed in the museum. The artworks generated these dialectics and commenced a dialogue between the artefact in the vitrine and the god in the shrine. They fulfilled a nonverbal or poetic method of illuminating original meanings of the deity and exposing their material realities. The Artworks Each of the four artworks in the exhibition can function independently; however, when exhibited in conjunction with each other, they reveal the discourse. The perception of the cyclical nature of time in the temple as portrayed in Ganesh, circa 1900 was visually contrasted with the deterioration of the deity in the museum store alongside other artefacts. The ritual behaviour generated through Kinetic Shiva further highlighted the purpose of touching artwork, as did Tactile Ganesh. These actions were enveloped by the meditative sound of the single-syllable mantra Om emanating from Ganesh, circa 1900, whereas the repetitive breathing sounds of Gods in Storage created a distinct environment in which the life and death of deities were explored. Kinetic Shiva is an interactive installation that invites the audience to perform a mechanized ritual act of circumambulation. I have depicted Shiva as an artefact that has deteriorated over time and has been restored. The form is made of sections that have been assembled to create a complete image. Gilded Shiva sits in a meditative pose, as the Kalyanasundara or Anugraha Murti, the benign, graceful image (rather than as the dancing Nataraja). 5 Installed in a dark crimson sanctum or garbhagriha, it was lit from within, light emanating outwards. The garbhagriha (the word literally means 'the womb') is a square or rectangular room in the innermost part of the temple from which divine energy is believed to radiate in all directions (see Micheli 1988: 67-8). Kinetic Shiva was installed on a rotating base in the innermost section of aTshaped structure that was constructed for the visitor to walk into. The crimson enclosure emanated the fragrance of sandalwood and created a distinct environment within the gallery. A sign at the entrance of the enclosure provided a cue to visitors to remove their shoes before entering. Worshippers remove footwear before entering the temple as a gesture of respect, and for contact with what is believed to be the sacred earth: 'it is, as it were, that spot where the force and vigour of the earth can be transmitted to human beings' (Jain-Neubauer 2000: 53). The cue for the visitors to remove their shoes not only facilitated a temple-like ritual, it functioned as a reminder of museum signs, which are regularly used to prevent or encourage certain behaviours. Hence, Kinetic Shiva created a liminal space within the larger museum building and offered the temple-like experience of moving in this marked-off ritual space with bare feet. The act of stepping into the narrow corridor caused a sensor to trigger the sound of a temple bell, 116</page><page sequence="8">Front Shrine to Plinth Figure 1.

The entire experience was enhanced through direct contact with the ground as a result of walking with bare feet. Three mirrors were installed behind the structure, which reflected multiple images of the visitor and Shiva (Figure 1). Moreover, the work's circular base rotated when the handle was turned, so that as the structure moved, the performer viewed the entire image in the round, concentrating on the form, the light emerging from within, and the reflection in the mirrors. By rotating the idol anticlockwise, the visitor performed a temple-like ritual mechanically but consciously, and was able to view the performance in the facing mirrors. Hence, the nature of the interaction generated by Kinetic Shiva was physical and exploratory. It removed the distance between the viewer and the object. New rules of behaviour were created for museum visitors to enact. In actively participating in the ritual I created within the enclosed space, the performer embodied the temple experience of interacting with the deity and was in a position to construct the dialectical meanings of the kinetic artwork first-hand. Kinetic Shiva explored the concepts of walking in the temple and museum 117</page><page sequence="9">Megha Rajguru Figure 2.

Through the use of multiple senses in engaging with the image, it referred to the temple experience on the one hand, and commented on museum-interactives and hands-on sessions as a means of increasing access to collections while simultaneously protecting them, on the other. Whilst depicting Shiva as a god potent with energy, it also presented it as an artefact with an acquisition name. In the video Ganesh, circa 1900 I presented a record of the dissolution of Ganesh in an upturned vitrine (Figures 2 and 3). The work evokes the annual Ganesh ritual practised in central India: the deity is worshipped for nine days after which it is immersed in a natural body of water on the tenth. The ritual is an enactment of the cycle of life, death, and re-birth, making explicit the treatment of the deity as a living entity, and marking one of several lifetimes every living being is believed to experience. The work embodies, in its four- dimensions: die cyclical nature of time, creation, destruction, and recreation; and simultaneously contrasts it with die linear nature of time in the museum. I have depicted die iconic vitrine as a container for narratives that compare cultural and museological meanings of Ganesh. Simultaneously, it symbolizes 118</page><page sequence="10">From Shrine to Plinth Figure 3.

It is employed as a paradoxical tool, one that presents the dissolution of the protected artefact. It continues to attract attentive viewing, yet projects a heretical function. By using the plinth and the vitrine, I elevated and contained the process of dissolution that, generated by me, is taken over by the material components of water and object. The soundtrack of the video, Om, is used to imbue and evoke meaning in the looping image of a decomposing and reconstructing Ganesh. Hence, the performative aspect of my video and the staging of my actions for recording are both instrumental in the conceptual construction of the artwork. Whereas Ganesh, circa 1900 examines the cyclical nature of time as understood by Hindus, the video Gods in Storage is a contrasting depiction of 119</page><page sequence="11">Megha Rajguru Figure 4. View of the video Gods in Storage projected in the From Shrine to Plinth exhibition in ' Space C at the Museum of Croydon at Croydon Clocktower. From a photograph taken by the author in August 2008.

The video is a staging of the phenomenon in which a variety of materials such as wood, metals, fabric, paper, and clay react with each other when placed in close proximity within an enclosed space (Figure 4). It examines the classification, exhibition, and storage of objects in museums as specimens of culture. The treatment of idols as living beings comes into play once again in this piece. Each object is 'breathing' within the constructed storage at different paces and volumes, creating an orchestra of breathing sounds. The objects that are most vulnerable deteriorate faster than the others, and their breathing falters (Figure 5). This artwork functions as 'visible storage', depicting the changes occurring within the confined space. A combination of better conservation, and a desire to increase access to the collections, has given rise to the concept of 'visible storage' wherein the public can view collections as stores on display, which combines 'two functions that modern museology considers separate: storage and display' (Thistle 1994: 187). Paul Thistle proposes that a visible store provides visitors with a better understanding of the 'museum's responsibilities, resources and true social utility' (ibid.: 188) - and gives them an opportunity to perceive the museum as their own. The aim of Gods in Storage is to provide the museum visitor with a similar 'visible storage' experience, but takes a critical approach. 120</page><page sequence="12">From Shrine to Plinth Figure 5.

It illustrates not only the classification of objects in storage, but also depicts the conservation challenges faced by museums. The fourth artwork made in this project. Tactile Gartesh, is a tactile sculpture consisting of four layers: the surface was covered with fresh flowers, which the visitors could take with them, the second layer was of brittle plaster of Paris, the third was made of soft moulding clay, and the core of the sculpture was made of durable plaster (Figures 6 and 7). Each layer was less ephemeral than the one above. Through Tactile Ganesh I encouraged the audience to touch, feel, and explore the form. This piece was experimental and was created so that I could observe the reactions of visitors towards touching the image of the deity in the secular museum environment (Figure 8). If there was a desire to touch, it was mainly dictated by curiosity or interest and led to experimenting with the material. This immersive act of touching the form and exploring its textures left marks on the artwork (Figure 9). The processes of making the artwork and the audience transforming it gradually over a period of time, resulted in a three- dimensional image that was in constant flux. This was similar to the process in which the sculptor sculpts an image for worship and its worshippers, through their interaction with it, cause a change in its surface material over a period of 121</page><page sequence="13">Megha Rajguru Figure 6.

This is at the very heart of the worship of deities within Hinduism: the belief that the physical is temporal and that energy existent in all matter is everlasting and immanent in the devotees' treatment of their gods. The devotion, or bhakti, towards the deity is personal and passionate and is expressed through all the senses. The eyes seek darshan ,6 the hands touch the feet of the deity, the nose inhales the perfume of the flowers and incense, the ears listen to the music, and the mouth tastes the prosada.7 Each worshipper in the temple leaves her or his impression on the idol through touch. 122</page><page sequence="14">From Shrine to Plinth Figure 7.

At the stages of visualization, making the work, and exhibiting, I explored the three-way relationship between the physical space (temple, museum, and the exhibition space), the object (the deity and the artworks), and the individual (the worshipper and the museum visitor). I used video as a medium that records and depicts change over a period of time. My actions of causing erosion, dissolving, cracking an object, and filming it can be perceived as being destructive and iconoclastic. In causing the form to deteriorate and be destroyed, however, I have been able to express the concepts of cyclical time and non-conservation - and hence expose the non-material qualities of the deities. 123</page><page sequence="15">Megha Rajguru Figure 8.

Courtesy and copyright, Megha Rajguru. The Exhibition One of the key aspects of my practice is to appropriate an already existing space to create a new and different context. The physical link made between the exhibition and 'Maya's shrine' was a reflection of an 'iconographie programme' engendering secular rituals, such as using the map, following the dotted path, and constructing meaning. The encounter with the artworks in the exhibition space, however, illuminated contrasting meanings of the deity from those displayed in 'Maya's shrine'. The function of the image of Ganesh, for example, was not to represent the worshipper's faith and ritual practice; instead, it became the deity that experienced several lifetimes. Hence, the artworks challenged the depiction of the deity as a conserved ethnographic or art object- rand the object and the space were recontextualized. This was carried out through the object's 'de-apotheosis' from its metaphoric plinth and the enlivening of the form itself. Through the sound of Om and by generating tactile interactions, temple meanings and experiences were brought into the secular space. The exhibition space became liminal, temple rituals encountered 124</page><page sequence="16">From Shrine to Plinth Figure 9. View of the eroding surface of Tactile Ganesh in the From Shrine to Plinth exhibition in 'Space C' at the Museum of Croydon at Croydon Clocktower.

Courtesy and copyright, Megha Rajguru. museum rituals, secular ideologies coexisted with religious beliefs; the site itself became an installation and the space became 'a practiced place' (Suderberg 2000: 19-20). 8 Thus the space was appropriated by me through installing the artworks, and further practised and experienced by the visitors. The visitors became performers, and it is through their engagement with the artworks that the dialectical meanings were generated. Movement through the space did not remain just a method of accessing the space and experiencing it (although it did do those things), it also functioned as a tool for interpreting the artwork and the dialectics it conveyed. The use of more than one of the senses in engaging with artworks is a distancing from the notion of experience through pure observation, involving 125</page><page sequence="17">Megha Rajguru instead a physical engagement with the material environment. This can be described as the lived experience in which individuals become aware of their body in the space and of their physical response to their environment. The experience of interacting with the deity in the temple was introduced at a conceptual and a physical level in the artworks and in their exhibition. The project considered the tools consciously used in constructing meaning (sight, smell, sound, and touch) by the visitors as a reflection, and hence a generator, of an awareness of the tools used in the deity's reception in the temple. In functioning as an institutional critique, my work also offered a parallel interpretation of the object on display. Conclusion In examining the deities in their two contexts, my approach as an artist is not limited to their cultural and historical significance in the two locations, nor does it encompass a purely objective, distanced approach. It is also a mixture of a sensitive and emotive response, with the aim of presenting the anthropomorphic qualities of deities and giving them a voice in their decontextualized states. The visitor behaviours in the exhibition did not remain 'mere rituals'; they oscillated between the religious and the secular. Visitor feedback revealed that the work led the audience to question and compare belief systems and the role of artefacts within them. Museums have the potential to become spaces in which meanings can be generated effectively by allowing the use of senses other than the visual. I have explored the paradox of encountering the non-material characteristics of artefacts through an enhanced physical experience of their materiality and surrounding space. This reveals the potential of artistic interventions in museums that explore ways in which generating performance by visitors can open up new ways of constructing meaning and creating narratives for the manifestation of non-material ideologies.

Suderberg borrows the phrase from the social scientist and applies it to site-specific and installation-art practices. References Alpers, Světlana 1991.
