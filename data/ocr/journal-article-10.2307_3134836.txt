<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS belong and by the traumatic background of their refugee parents, who retain a strong tie to their cultural roots. The book also makes methodological con- tributions, not stopping at simple statements that the perspective of the child must be included, but addressing complexities, such as the problems of interviewing children un- accustomed to the interview situation. Baker and Panter-Brick, for example, alert us to potential research pitfalls, in that homeless children may be better interview subjects because of their familiarity with talking to NGO personnel. While impressed with the high quality of the chapters and the relative evenness of quality for an edited volume, a concluding chapter would have provided an opportunity for tying together the threads of the volume, notwithstanding Panter-Brick's excellent introduction and orientation. Also, one wishes that the title had been broader, or a subtitle included, so that potential readers would rec- ognize its central contribution to childhood studies. I recommend a full and careful reading of this volume to all those interested in research and intervention with children in difficult circumstances. JILL E. KORBIN Case Western Reserve University SIMOONS, FREDERICK J. Plants of life, plants of death. xvi, 568 pp., map, illus., bibliogr. Madison: Univ. Wisconsin Press, 1998 In a Midsummer-Night's Dream (Act II scene 1), Oberon speaks: I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine; There sleeps Titania some time of the night, Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight; And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in ... The culture surrounding the world of plants is inexhaustible and has long provided rich material for ethnographic analysis. Yet how many readers of this journal would be able to name on sight more than one of the plants in Oberon's list? The apparent inconsistency between ignorance of botanical culture on the one hand and, on the other, the importance of plants in anthropological studies of human culture finds expression in the central theme of this interesting book. This theme has two characteristics: first, the problem of identifying constants in the uses of specific groups of plants across cultures diverse in time and space; and secondly, the wish to find generally applicable explanations for these uses. This erudite work largely succeeds in tackling the first problem, but its explanatory claims are less persuasive. The book is structured around selected species belonging to six genera: holy basil (Ocimum sanctum); the sacred figs (pipal Ficus religiosa and banyan F indica); the mandrake (Mandragora officinarum and M. autumnalis); garlic and onions (Allium sativum, A. cepa, and other species); the urd bean (Vigna mungo); and the fava bean (Viciafaba). For each genus, the author traces the major geographical and ethnographic properties. He then adopts the viewpoint of a cultural historian seeking to understand how the concerns of magic, ritual activity, religion, and symbolism 'have shaped the way humans have perceived and used plants since antiquity'. The importance of holy basil and the fig trees in South Asian culture is well docu- mented. Any visitor to the subcontinent will have viewed with awe the elegant, timeless, and seemingly ubiquitous pipal and banyan trees testifying to the remarkable spread of Buddhism and Hinduism. There is a fascinat- ing account of the mandrake, of which the anthropomorphic root was widely traded (and faked) and used for its magical, aphrodisiacal, and other properties. In the absence of persuasive evidence, Simoons speculates that the well-established botanical pharmacopoeia of India, and the presence of the aphrodisia- cal Panax ginseng in China, sufficed to prevent the spread of the mandrake from Europe and Middle East to these areas. By contrast, the claim that garlic and onions are ritually impure and improper to consume is traced through all regions of the Old World. Simoons attributes this to both the human biology of disgust at the strong odours evolved by these items, and to the cultural apparatus which in places interprets the bulb to resemble flesh or the human head. Thus, in this case, different explanatory factors might predominate in dis- tinct cases of avoidance. However, four of the ten chapters are con- cerned with the beans Vigna mungo (chap. 6) and Viciafaba (chap. 7-9). Simoons argues that the urd bean (black gram; Sanskrit masa) has been used in South Asia since the second mil- lennium BC; that it may have been domesti- cated by pre-Aryan Dravidian peoples of the subcontinent; and that its dark hue led to its widespread rejection from the Hindu diet on grounds of symbolic associations with low caste, ritual impurity, and animal flesh. The latter argument relies on Mary Douglas's 788</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS reasoning for the importance of context and of local models for judging purity or impu- rity. It remains nevertheless essentially a spec- ulative and inductive argument; the evidence adduced to support it derives from disparate sources, and there has been no single field study framed so as to test it empirically. It is perhaps surprising that a quarter of the whole book should be devoted to the fava bean. Yet there is a reason for this. The rejec- tion of this bean by Pythagoras and his followers has been attributed by 'secular West- erners' to favism, that is, the haemolytic anaemia affecting consumers deficient in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The genetic trait responsible for this enzyme deficiency has been relatively widespread in some Mediterranean populations, perhaps because it confers a degree of resistance to malaria. Determinists (or, as Simoons calls them, 'medical materialists') therefore have a biological rationale for the evolution of a cul- tural phenomenon (a rule against eating this bean). Simoons uses both cultural evidence on the place of the fava bean, and analogical evi- dence in the form of the place of the urd bean, to claim that magico-religious concerns provide sufficient reason for the Pythagorean ban on consumption of Vidafaba, and that the 'determinists' are misguided. There is no doubt that Simoons has col- lated a vast array of evidence, derived from literary sources and studies of genetic epi- demiology. Yet in the absence of a historical perspective on the genetics of Mediterranean peoples, the argument against medical materi- alists remains tantalizingly superficial. This book is a rich resource of ideas and references which will, to be sure, stimulate further studies. Indeed, the 150 pages of foot- notes apply to a total text only twice as long. The author is to be congratulated on its comprehensive scope and careful attention to detail. SIMON STRICKLAND University College London General ABRAMSON, ALLEN &amp; DIMITRIOS THEODOS- SOPOULOS (eds). Land, law and environment: mythical land, legal boundaries. v, 224 pp., table, bibliogrs. London: Pluto Press, 2000. ,45.00 (cloth), ?15.99 (paper) In 1998, Chris Hann's edited collection Prop- erty relations (Cambridge Univ. Press) appeared, concerned largely with land. Abramson and Theodossopolous's collection complements that earlier volume. While Hann's was con- cerned with social relations of property in general, the present volume has a more spe- cific focus, signalled in the work's subtitle. 'Mythical' points to the way that land can be endowed with meaning and social identity; 'legal' points to the ways that land can be a relatively neutral economic resource that can be surveyed, bounded, and treated as a com- modity. This collection, then, is about inter- sections of these two ways of understanding land. The collection is extensive. It contains nine substantive chapters in addition to a thought- ful introduction written by Abramson. The cases range from the fringes of Manchester airport to the Pacific and Australasia, by way of the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, and Europe. The people described range from classic villagers to ecological protestors and state administrators. The mythic dimension ranges from historic rebellion against slave- owners through real and imagined ancestors to the sanctity of labour in land. As might be expected, the single most notable concern of the contributors is the ways that people attempt to appropriate or reappropriate land as myth in the face of a legal view of land, often imposed from outside. Thus, Paul Durman considers a set of people attempting to block the expansion of Manchester's airport, and in the process offers a useful overview of some important approaches to land in Western thought. Kusum Gopal describes efforts by a group of Indian 'tribal' people to maintain their mythic construction of land in the face of colonial and state-based land law. Nathan Porath describes how some equally 'tribal' people, this time in Indonesia, seek to maintain their mythic view in the face of encroaching devel- opment activities. Allen Abramson shows how Fijian myth conceptions of land articulate with and even subvert formal land registra- tion. These chapters indicate the ways that the mythic and the legal can interact: at one extreme are sheer efforts to conserve or reim- pose mythic land understandings, at the other are intriguing syncretisms and even the gen- eration of novel mythic views. There are other themes in the collection, as well. Philip Burnham describes the ways that the push to community forestry in the Cameroon reveals the ways that 'community' itself is problematic, as sets of people can be variously indigenous or in-coming. Dimitrios Theodossopoulos returns to his Greek vil- lagers, those agriculturalists and petty tourism entrepreneurs who confront an encroaching state ecological regime that defines land very differently from the way that they do.Veronica Strang describes changes in understandings of land in White Australia, a consequence of the changing legal and cultural position of Abo- rigines in that country.
