<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALDEN POND AS A SYMBOL BY MELVIN E. LYON THOREAU's Walden' has often been studied as a symbolic work exemplifying the ro- mantic quest for rebirth.2 No one, however, has demonstrated that, like many other masterpieces of the period, its title identifies its chief symbol.' My purpose is to demonstrate this point and show its significance for the work as a whole. Thoreau's ultimate purpose in going to Walden was to give his "Genius" (or spiritual intuition) more freedom to pursue its search for greater intimacy with God and a greater spiritualization of himself. For his Genius to be fully effective he had to slough off his civilized self and regain his natural self. This involved re-learning to identify himself with the basic rhythms of nature. The largest such rhythms are the cycles of the year and the day. The seasonal cycle of the year pro- vides the external structural principle for Wal- den. The two cycles provide two of its major sym- bols, spring and morning.4 These suggest Thor- eau's general theme, the infinite fertility of na- ture and the correspondingly infinite possibilities of human intellectual and spiritual rebirth. In addition they provide constant inspiration for Thoreau's own rebirth. The cycle of the seasons is also an element in the internal structure of the work. It does not explain, however, the order of the chapters within those large divisions which it determines. Moreover, Thoreau experiences rebirth primarily by identifying himself, not directly with the morning,' but with Walden Pond, which par- ticipates in both of nature's major cycles. It is this identification which provides the internal structural principle that determines the order of chapters in the book. It also suggests some com- ments about Walden's relationship to Roman- ticism. I To demonstrate these assertions it is necessary to look closely at what Thoreau has to say of the pond and his relationship to it. Walden is, first of all, a part of nature and shares in the general characteristics of natural things. Nature's basic characteristic, according to Thoreau, is unity (W, p. 259), but it is also characterized by great variety. Everything in nature has its own "law"-its own innate mode of existence- which it acts out unconsciously (except in the case of man) and as fully as circumstances per- mit. Walden, too, "has its law to which it thun- ders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the spring" (W, p. 269). In the world of plants and animals such obedience leads to a struggle for existence which creates a dy- namic balance among the combatants (W, pp. 254, 251). Nature is an organic, not a mechanical unity. Because the pond is inorganic it does not share in this struggle. Yet it is not fundamentally different from plants and animals. Everything in nature is made from the same basic material- I Henry Thoreau, Walden, ed. Brooks Atkinson (New York, 1950).

This community of material and form determines a physical hierarchy in nature from simplicity to complexity, from a leaf to, appar- ently, man. Thoreau says of partridges that "they are among the most simple ... animal products; . . . of the very hue and substance of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to the ground" (W, p. 252). He relates the pond to the leaf form, indirectly and implicitly, by allying it with the partridge in a passage which describes the partridge's eye in terms otherwise reserved for the pond: "The remarkably adult yet inno- cent expression of . .. [the partridge's] open and serene eyes is very memorable. All intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye was not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects. The woods do not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often look into such a limpid well" (W, p. 204). "Purity," "coeval with the sky it reflects," "gem," "well" are all terms used primarily about the pond, while at one point Walden is described as "earth's eye."7 As an expression of the leaf form, the pond is a "moist" inner "lobe." More important, the pond is related to plants and ani- mals by the fact that everything in nature is alive (W, p. 275). Describing the spring melting of the pond, Thoreau says that "Walden was dead and is alive again" (W, p. 278). Hence the physical hierarchy in nature is no more static than the balance of nature. Destruc- tion and especially creation are continuous pro- cesses (W, p. 275). Individuals do not produce new species, though they may produce new indi- viduals, but they do participate in nature's cyclic rhythm of birth and death and rebirth. Walden produces neither species nor individuals but it too participates in this rhythm. The final and most important characteristic of nature is the spiritual or moral "meanings" which it and each individual thing in it embody (W, pp. 113-114, 144, 203). Thoreau says that he returned to the pond after a long absence to find "the same thought . .. welling up to its surface" (W, p. 174). The primary moral attributes of this "thought" are depth and especially purity, for Thoreau the two highest moral values. These values correspond to the two physical attributes of the pond Thoreau notes most often. In dis- proving the local belief that Walden is bottom- less by measuring it, he comments that "I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol" (W, p. 256). The symbolic meaning of "depth" is suggested when he urges, "Let us ... work . . . our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, . . . and tradition, ... and appearance. . . till we come to a hard bot- tom ..., which we can call reality" (W, p. 88). In the succeeding paragraph he calls his head "an organ for burrowing," a kind of "divining-rod" (W, p. 89). The pun on "divine-ing" suggests that "reality" is ultimately divine. The moral value most often associated with the pond is "pure" or "purity." Thoreau says that its water is of "crystalline purity" (W, p. 161). The few plants in it "are clean and bright like the element they grow in" (W, p. 162). It is "not very fertile in fish" (W, p. 167), for they "must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there" (W, p. 161). Walden is "a mirror," Thor- eau generalizes, "in which all impurity presented to it sinks" (W, p. 170). As a moral term "pur- .ity" means to Thoreau, first, freedom from sen- suality. "Sensuality" is the indulgence,of physi- cal appetite primarily for its own sake (W, p. 196). But "purity" also means freedom from all feelings, thoughts, and desires which do not proceed from the spiritual core (the "Genius") of an individual (W, pp. 170-171). Thoreau observes of the pond that, "of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears best, and best preserves its purity" (W, p. 174). The pond's antithesis is the hog, which suggests to Thoreau that there is "an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual. This creature succeeded by other means than temperance and purity" (W, p. 197). He also associates the snake with sensuality (W, p. 198). Thus there seems to be a second hierarchy in nature, one of "thought" or "mean- ing" rather than complexity, in which things are ranked according to their degree of "purity." In this hierarchy the hog and snake are at (or close to) the bottom, at least among animals, and Walden Pond at the top. The pond is therefore a part of nature. But it is also superior to the rest of nature on earth. Thoreau says that "a lake is the landscape's most ' Paul, Accent, p. 112, says Thoreau derived this idea from Goethe's well-known use of it. See also Paul, The Shores of America, p. 347, n. 222. 7 See Gerry Brenner, "Thoreau's 'Brute Neighbors': Four Levels of Nature," ESQ, No. 39 (1965), p. 39.</page><page sequence="3">Melvin E. Lyon 291 beautiful and expressive feature" (W, p. 168). During his first week at Walden, "it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes" (W, p. 77; see also p. 162). In regard to its purity, he notes that "many men have been likened to it, but few deserve that honor" (W, p. 174; see also p. 180). This superiority is expressed in the con- ventional symbolism of height-and therefore proximity to the sky and heaven-and depth.8 Thus Walden "is intermediate in its nature be- tween land and sky" (W, p. 171). In the winter, when Thoreau cuts through the ice on the pond, he finds that "Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads" (W, p. 254). The sources for the pond's life are also deeper and higher than those of other things: without any visible outlet, it is fed by deep springs (W, pp. 163-164) and con- tinually receives "new life and motion from above" (W, p. 171). It is this closeness to the divine which makes the pond "a good port and a good foundation" for Thoreau's "trade" "with the Celestial Em- pire" (W, p. 18)-i.e., with God and Heaven. It is also why he found that, at Walden, "both place and time were changed and I dwelt nearer to those parts of the universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me" (W, p. 79). Walden's proximity to heaven and God means that it shares something of their infinity and eternality. Thus Thoreau emphasizes both its age (11, pp. 162, 163) and the fact that it is un- changing (W, pp. 162, 174) and "perennially young" (W, p. 174). It participates in the cycle of the year, but even in winter, when it is most alienated from its essential nature (i.e., its eternal youth), Thoreau has only to dig down through the ice on its surface to find unchanged its "pe- rennial waveless serenity" (W, p. 254). By living near it, he shares in these characteristics and thus finds himself partially freed from the restrictions of space and time.9 This association of Walden and the divine reaches its climax in the first four lines of a poem in "The Ponds": "It is no dream of mine / To ornament a line; / I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven / Than I live to Walden even" (W, p. 175). Walden is not said to be God here. More- over, in the passages cited to show the pond's proximity to the divine, the sky seems clearly associated with heaven. God seems to be sym- bolized by light, especially by the sun,10 which determines those cycles of the year and the day which provide the framework for the operation of all nature on earth, including the pond.11 But while Walden is not God, it does contain an emanation from Him or at least a permanent reflection of Him: in the spring, Thoreau finds it "reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, as if it had intelligence with some remote horizon" (W, p. 278). Thus the thought which wells to Walden's surface seems to be God and especially His in- finitely divine life (symbolized by the pond's water). If the sun suggests God Himself, Walden is the most perfect image of God on earth. Thor- eau tells of "that ancient settler . .. , who re- members so well when he first came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here" (W, p. 165). The settler is God, who came here, as Thoreau himself did, with a "divine-ing" rod, by means of which He found the place on earth where He could be most fully expressed and there created a permanent, incorruptible image of Himself. The use of personification, the action of dig- ging, and the word "well" here are significant, especially since the word "well" is the most com- mon synonym for "pond" in the book. All three elements suggest an emphasis on God as an artificer which also appears in frequent phrases like "Maker of this earth" (W, p. 275) and "Builder of the universe" (W, p. 293). This sur- prisingly Deistic conception comports strangely with the organic implications of Thoreau's use of the sun to suggest God and such references to Him as "the perennial source of our life" (W, p. 121). These organic implications reach their climax in the one pantheistic passage in Walden, a quotation which states that "the subtile powers of Heaven and of Earth . .. [are] identified with the substance of things. . . [and] cannot be separated from them" (W, p. 121). Otherwise, Thoreau's relationship with God, except for "oc- casional visits" from his personified "ancient Paul, The Shores of America, p. 334. Lynn, pp. 602-603, suggests Walden's participation in both the earth and the sky, nature and the divine. 9 Cf. Anderson, pp. 637, 644. 10 Moldenhauer, p. 249. Lynn, p. 602, calls the sun "the fundamental source of all transcendental correspondences between man and Nature" and discusses Thoreau's ambiva- lent attitude toward it in Walden. The association is clearest in W, pp. 36-37, 66-67, 76, 150, 170, 280-281, 297. 11 Walden is said to be most like heaven "in the intervals of a gentle rain-storm in August" when "the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself" (W, p. 78). It is called "Sky water" (W, p. 170) and a "Lake . . . of Light" (W, p. 180).</page><page sequence="4">292 Walden Pond as a Symbol settler," is indirect, through nature and the spiritual meanings it embodies. The anthropomorphic character of God sug- gested both by the personification and by the use of the word "well" is implicitly developed further by Thoreau's anthropomorphizing of the pond (W, pp. 168, 170, 171, 174, 175, 263). His primary purpose in doing this, however, is not to connect the pond with God but with man. To understand this connection a brief sum- mary of Thoreau's idea of man in Walden is necessary. Man is alive; he is made of matter (W, p. 274) and is a modification of the basic leaf form (W, p. 274); he seems to be the most com- plex being in the physical hierarchy (W, p. 254; see also p. 192). Unlike other natural things, however, he has a double nature. Along with his natural self, he has a potential spiritual self, higher and better than the former, and the ability to evolve from his natural self to this spiritual self. On the other hand he can also degenerate. He can express the thoughts which rightly belong to lower creatures in nature; he can also become something neither natural nor spiritual (W, pp. 30-33). The highest level to which he can aspire is a depth and a purity akin to that of the pond (W, p. 175), but he reaches this level, not spon- taneously, but by obedience and discipline. It is to awaken civilized men who are capable of it to this highest level that Thoreau writes Walden. With Emerson, he believes that nature was created for spiritual ends. When he says that he is "thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol" (W, p. 256), he suggests that there is an intrinsic spiritual purpose for which Walden was made, an idea more fully developed when he calls the pond "earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature" (W, p. 168). The pond acts as a supreme moral touchstone for man. But it also has a more active influence. Thoreau says of the train which daily passes Walden that "the cars neVer pause to look at it, yet I fancy that the engineers and firemen and brakemen, and those passengers who . . . see it often, are better men for the sight. The engineer does not forget at night, or his nature does not, that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at least during the day. Though seen but once, it helps to wash out State Street and the engine's soot" (W, p. 175). The pond purifies those who see it often by activating their natural-spiritual nature (as contrasted with their civilized self), and espe- cially their ultimate nature-their soul-that im- age of God which exists, often suppressed but never obliterated, in each man and which there- fore responds to that purer image of itself and of God which is imaged by the pond. For Thoreau himself Walden has the same significance and effect, intensified by his greater awareness and his more complete submission to its influence. The climax to this submission is the twice daily bath he takes in it (W, pp. 80, 151). The early morning swim is the more important: "I got up early and bathed in the pond," he says: "that was a religious exercise, and one of the best things which I did" (W, p. 80). This act is a sacramental means of renewing himself "com- pletely each day" (W, p. 80). It rids him of his dross and revitalizes his genius; it also renews his sense of the goal toward which that genius points. For the sun and morning suggest only the possibility of self-improvement. Walden, as the highest earthly image of the perfection Thoreau seeks, offers him stimulus and help in achieving that goal. It is both a standard by which he can measure his improvement and an active influence upon his progress. Bathing in it is thus not just figuratively but literally a religious exercise. One of the results of the pond's presence, both as touchstone and as influence, is the assistance it gives his "Genius" in discovering the value of other things for his spiritual development. Early in Walden he suggests that books are the greatest expressions of civilization (W, pp. 93, 91). Near the end he says that "in the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat-Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previ- ous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions" (W, p. 266). As Thoreau bathes his body in the pond each morning, so he bathes his intellect (and spirit) in the Bhagavad- Gila at the same sacred time of day. The im- plication is that the Gita is civilization's counter- part of nature's supreme image of God, the greatest translation of "the language. . . all things . . . speak" (W, p. 101) into the language of man, and therefore uniquely able to assist the pond in its spiritualizing influence.12 Yet ultimately the Gila too is a translation. It a' William Bysshe Stein, in "Thoreau's Walden and the Bhagavad-Gita," Topic, No. 6 (1963), pp. 38-55, shows a number of analogies between the ideas of the two books.</page><page sequence="5">Melvin E. Lyon 293 is the pond which is the principal image and symbol of God on earth and the chief agent, along with Thoreau's own efforts, in his spiritual development. Its ultimate significance appears most explicitly in the following passage: ... here is Walden, the same woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; . . . it is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and it may be to me. It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile! He rounded this water with his hand, deepened and clarified it in His thought, and in his will bequeathed it to Concord.... It is no dream of mine, To ornament a line; I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven Than I live to Walden even. I am its stony shore, And the breeze that passes o'er; In the hollow of my hand Are its water and its sand, And its deepest resort Lies high in my thought. The cars never pause to look at it; yet.. . The engineer does not forget at night, or his nature does not, that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity ... during the day.... One proposes that it be called "God's Drop." (W, pp. 174-175) The most important part of this passage is the poem, which consists of two sentences, each divided into couplets. In the first couplet of the first sentence Thoreau states that he is speaking the truth, not simply ornamenting a line of poet- ry; in the second he says that in living at Wal- den he is living as close to God and Heaven as he can-presumably because Walden is the primary earthly manifestation for him of God. The real focus of the poem is upon the second sentence. There Thoreau is concerned with his, rather than God's relationship to Walden. Nevertheless, it is clear from the first sentence that this relationship is based upon and derives its significance from the pond's relationship to God: in identifying himself with the pond Thoreau is also implicitly identifying himself with God as He is imaged in the pond. Specifically, Thoreau identifies with three aspects of Walden: its setting, its materials, and its depth. In the first couplet he says that he is the pond's shore and the breeze that passes over it. Sherman Paul and Charles Anderson have argued that the "stony shore" symbolizes Thor- eau's "actual self" while the pond symbolizes his "transcendent self.""3 (This "actual self" would seem to be the civilized self that Thoreau has come to the pond to slough off.) But there are many difficulties in this interpretation. First, it suggests that the second sentence concerns-or at least emphasizes-an antithesis. Actually, Thoreau takes five elements of the pond and groups them into three units, each consisting of a rhymed couplet. This three- (rather than two-) fold division is emphasized by punctuation: the couplets are separated by semi-colons, thereby forming a series of three items (though these do seem to be arranged in climactic order). Sec- ondly, the couplet in which the "stony shore" ap- pears also contains "the breeze that passes o'er." Nowhere in Walden is there any association of air with anything inferior. Third, there is no asso- ciation of the "stony shore" itself with anything as inferior as Paul and Anderson imply that the "actual self" is to the "transcendent self." Thor- eau says that the "rise and fall of Walden at long intervals" kills shrubs and trees along its edge, so that "its shore is cleanest when the water is low- est" (W, p. 164), but such cleansing has nothing to do with the stones on the shore. The principal evidence Paul and Anderson present is some lines from "an early manuscript of Walden": It [the pond] is a part of me which I have not profaned I live by the shore of me detained. Laden with my dregs I stand on my legs, While all my wine I to nature consign.'4 These lines make the antithesis clear and em- phatic. But it does not follow that they are there- fore the key to the meaning of the poem in its final form. It would seem at least as valid to argue that Thoreau omitted or altered the lines just because they did emphasize the antithesis. In the poem as it now stands, the "I" seems to be not a combination of Thoreau's civilized (or "actual") and "transcendent" selves, but his partially restored natural-spiritual self. Thus, though a difference in value is implied between the shore of the pond and its depth, this differ- ence is expressed not in terms of an antithesis but in terms of the harmony between two levels of the pond's multi-leveled being. Symbolically, such terms suggest a similar harmony between 1I Paul, The Shores of America, pp. 333-334; Anderson, p. 643. The quoted phrases are Anderson's. 1 Paul, The Shores of America, pp. 333-334. Anderson, p. 643, quotes only the first two lines. The quoted prose phrase is Anderson's.</page><page sequence="6">294 Walden Pond as a Symbol two levels of Thoreau's partly purified self. This treatment is in accord with the emphasis in most of Walden upon the harmoniousness of the nat- ural and the spiritual aspects of the self and the evolutionary rather than revolutionary nature of self-development."5 In the remainder of the poem Thoreau identi- fies the pond with himself instead of himself with it. First, he says that the materials of which the pond is made-its water and sand-are also a part of himself. Then, drawing upon his sym- bolism of depth for spirituality and his equation of depth and height, he suggests that the utmost expression of God imaged by the pond is also present in the utmost reaches of his own thought. In both assertions parallels in diction between the couplet and the final (quoted) sentence in the prose passage which precedes the poem suggest a connection between Thoreau, the pond, and God. In the prose passage God is said to have "rounded this water with his hand"; in the poem Thoreau finds the pond's water and sand "in the hollow of my hand." In the prose passage God is said to have "deepened and clarified it [Walden] in His thought"; in the poem, Thoreau says the pond's "deepest resort / Lies high in my thought." The point is a double one: Walden is at one with God; Thoreau is at one with both it and God. The prose passage which follows the poem is also concerned with the pond's nature and rela- tionships. But whereas the first passage concerns the pond's relationship to God, and the poem emphasizes its relationship to Thoreau, the final passage concerns its relationship to other men. Thoreau suggests that all men who see the pond respond to it as he does, even though uncon- sciously, with that part of themselves he calls their "nature," and thus that his identification with the pond is in part generic as well as in- dividual. The term "nature" here is a play on words. It means both "ultimate nature," or soul, and that material part of man which is harmonious with his ultimate "nature." It derives this doubleness of meaning partly by association with the pre- ceding poem, where Thoreau's identification with a natural thing is simultaneously an identifica- tion with the spirituality it symbolizes. This sym- bolic suggestiveness was set up in part in the initial prose passage, where words having to do with physical features of the pond were so asso- ciated with God that when they reappeared in the poem they retained that association even though it was not made explicit. Now, in the prose passage which follows the poem, this double meaning is accentuated by a play on words. The function of the prose context of the poem is thus, in part, to release the poem's spiritual implications. Such release does not separate the spiritual meaning from the natural thing, but reveals another, profounder dimension of the natural. The pond as natural phenomenon and the pond as image of God remain one, and Thoreau's identification is with that fusion of the divine and the natural. In making this identification Thoreau is also implicitly identifying with the eye of the par- tridge, which he has identified with the pond; with the leaf (though only in part, because some of nature is sensual), which he has identified with the partridge; and therefore with all of nature which is consonant with God. This is the moment of total commitment for Thoreau in his choice of the pond as the ultimate earthly alternative to civilization, and his acceptance, as part of that choice, of the discipline the pond will impose in creating a self opposed to that created by civiliza- tion. From now until "Spring" he and Walden are implicitly one. By participating in the com- bination of stasis and change which characterizes the pond's movement through the cycle of the seasons, he will assist it to develop the image of God within him to a fullness commensurate with its own perfect reflection of the Deity.16 This relationship suggests an older, compa- rable relationship. It has been noted that the Transcendentalists' enthusiasm for the Hindu Scriptures satisfied an inherited need for a sacred book. In Thoreau's case the need extended fur- ther. As the Bhagavad-Gita was his Bible, so Walden was his personal Redeemer. II The desire for redemption (or rebirth) and the achievement of it through identification with the 15 Paul, The Shores of America, p. 333, says that Walden is the symbol of Thoreau's "real self." See also Moldenhauer, pp. 249, 258. Anderson, p. 643, says that it is a "symbol-of the immanent God, or Over Soul, of Thoreau's own soul or transcendent self." Walden is a symbol of Thoreau's soul but it is so because primarily it is-for Thoreau-the ultimate earthly image of a God who created everything, is reflected and perhaps embodied in his creation (and especially in the pond and-potentially-human beings), but who also exists independently of that creation 10 In ending the final prose passage with the proposal that Walden be called "God's Drop," Thoreau reemphasizes the primacy of the pond's relationship to God over its relation- ship with himself or other men and also, by implication, the fact that the pond, though an image of God, is His creation and therefore a part of nature.</page><page sequence="7">Melvin E. Lyon 295 pond seems to me the theme of Walden and the chief factor in determining its inner structure.17 This structure works within the external struc- ture determined by the cycle of the year, just as Thoreau's personal rebirth occurs through his identification with one of the natural phenomena which participate in that cycle. This inner struc- ture involves a basically three-fold division: (1) an increasing movement away from civilization and toward identification with the pond ("Economy" to "The Village"); (2) identification ("The Ponds" to "The Pond in Winter"); (3) release from identification and return to civiliza- tion ("Spring" and "Conclusion"). A more sharply marked division is the tendency for chapters to appear in pairs.18 Up to "Baker Farm," one of these is clearly concerned with civilization and society, the other with nature and solitude. From "Higher Laws" on, the sub- jects of the contrast vary, but the pairing of chapters continues. The first two chapters introduce the antith- esis.19 "Economy" contains Thoreau's longest and harshest attack on civilization and society; "Where I Lived And What I Lived For" is a strong positive assertion of the value of a solitary life in nature. In the third chapter, "Reading," having taken his basic stand toward civilization in "Economy," Thoreau turns from its faults to consider what he believes is its best product and most redeeming feature-books. This is the first (and last) chapter in which Thoreau's attitude toward civilization will be primarily favorable, however. Each succeeding civilization chapter will be increasingly unfavorable until a new low is reached in "Baker Farm" (though even it is not so harsh as "Economy"). Indeed, even the praise of books is countered immediately, in the accompanying nature chapter ("Sounds"), by the assertion that the language of books is in- ferior to the language (the sounds) of nature. From "Sounds" on, the nature-solitude chapters will have a movement opposite to that of the civilization-society chapters, a movement of in- creasing praise as Thoreau discusses in each an increasingly more important aspect of his retreat into nature. This movement reaches its first climax in "The Ponds," the longest and most important nature-solitude chapter. Appropri- ately, it is also the most descriptive and symbolic chapter, as "Economy" is the most analytic and rational. The placing of these key chapters sug- gests that the emphasis of the book is positive rather than negative, that Thoreau's primary concern is to praise nature and solitude rather than to criticize civilization and society (the title also implies this emphasis).20 The third pair of chapters reverses the order of the first two pairs. The nature chapter is put first, apparently in order to intensify the sense of nature and thereby offset the dominance of civilization established by the length of "Econ- omy." In "Solitude," the nature chapter, there is less of civilization than in "Sounds" (much of which is concerned with the railroad's noise and the mingling of civilized and natural sounds) and more of nature; it also represents a further and profounder stage in Thoreau's progressive move- ment toward rapport with nature (especially in the passage in which he describes an immediate sense of nature's beneficence (W, pp. 119-120). The accompanying civilization chapter, "Visi- tors," presents an aspect of civilization less valuable, in general, than books, but still desir- able. The first of the next pair of chapters, "The Bean-Field," seems at first to depart from the progressive pattern I have ascribed to the nature chapters. "Solitude," however, is primarily a defense of solitude rather than a positive asser- tion; also, in it Thoreau's emphasis is still upon his transition from a civilization-oriented life to a nature-oriented life, even though the critical point in that shift of perspective is reached in the aforementioned moment of rapport during the rainstorm. In "The Bean-Field," having shifted his center of orientation to nature, Thoreaude- scribes one of his principal activities-specifi- cally, one which his practical New England audi- ence could understand, that of obtaining food (though for him it was more than that). The ac- companying civilization chapter, "The Village," discusses the least pleasant aspect of civilization since the first chapter and therefore provides a 17 The accounts of Walden's structure closest to my own are those of Lane and Anderson. 18 Adams, p. 425, notes the alternation of chapters be- tween "man and nature" and "individual and society" from "Reading" through "Brute Neighbors." John C. Broderick, "The Movement of Thoreau's Prose," AL, xxxii (1961), 140, notes that, up to "Brute Neighbors," these pairs have a rhythmic movement, alternating between an advance into spiritual experence and a retreat into the everyday world. Anderson, pp. 638, 639, 641, views the alternation as one of "society" and "solitude," and finds it in the first six chapters and then more "faintly" in the next four, through "Brute Neighbors." 19 Anderson, p. 636. Willard Thorp, "Reading Walden," Report of the Eleventh Yale Conference on The Teaching of English, Master of Arts in Teaching Program, Yale Uni- versity, 1965, pp. 15-16, makes the same point in the course of a different interpretation of Walden's structure. 20 Anderson, pp. 633, 637.</page><page sequence="8">296 Walden Pond as a Symbol good contrast with "The Bean-Field" and a good preparation for "The Ponds," the climax of Thoreau's movement toward identification with nature and the pond. As the ninth of the eighteen chapters of the book, "The Ponds" is Walden's physical center.2' It is also its center as a sym- bolic work. As "The Bean-Field" emphasizes what Thoreau did at Walden, "The Ponds" emphasizes the other and more important aspect of his life there-what he did not do, the contem- plative rather than the active aspect of his life.22 The chapter is primarily descriptive, though there is also a constant concern with Walden's "thought" and the relevance of this thought to men. Indeed, the climax of the chapter is the little poem already quoted. The following chapter, "Baker Farm," re- turns to an even less pleasant aspect of civiliza- tion than that in "The Village." Thoreau now presents a particular example (just as "The Ponds" narrows nature in general to a few ponds) of most men's failure to use nature properly. (Thoreau's afternoon with the Fields is also a concrete illustration of the message and the mood of "Economy.") One aspect of the connection, and the contrast, between this chapter and "The Ponds" is Thoreau's account of the Fields's "well": "I asked for a drink, but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands, and rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right culi- nary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and after consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one,-not yet suffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I thought" (W, p. 186). The physical and (implied) symbolic contrast between the Fields's well and Thoreau's "well" at Walden could not be more sharply drawn. In "Higher Laws" Thoreau tries, in part, to express in abstract-rational terms what he had expressed in concrete-symbolic terms in "The Ponds."23 The chapter opens with a contrast be- tween the wild (or primitive) and spiritual sides of his nature, for both of which he expresses re- spect. In discussing the desirability of man's developing from an emphasis on the former to the latter, however, his dichotomy is transformed into that of sensuality versus purity. Although this dichotomy is related to the discussion in "Economy" of the relative importance of physi- cal necessities, it is presented here in more moral terms than there and in a tone which suggests a partial loss of control on the part of the speaker. In the process of self-discovery Thoreau seems to have struck upon a central problem, which he re- acts to, not by confronting what he discovers from the position he has taken up to this point but by invoking the aid of another he has sup- posedly abandoned. Specifically, he invokes the Pauline-Augustinian-Calvinist concept of a war between flesh and spirit as the essence of human life, an idea which belies the usual emphasis in Walden on the fundamental harmony of flesh and spirit (W, pp. 175, 189) and the evolutionary rather than revolutionary nature of spiritual development (W, pp. 14, 71).24 As part of this contrast Thoreau introduces the only two nat- ural things in the work (besides man) which he associates with sensuality: the hog and the snake. In "Economy," he had used the hibernating snake not yet fully awakened as his first symbol of men who have not come out of "their present low and primitive condition . . . to a higher and more ethereal life" (W, p. 37). In "Higher Laws" he writes that "we are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our higher na- ture slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and per- haps cannot be wholly expelled.... The impure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is attacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another" (W, pp. 197-198). The difference between these passages is not so much in what is said as in how it is said. In the first, the snake is a part of innocent nature. In the second, it is a part of fallen nature-the familiar Judaic-Christian symbol of evil. Thor- eau's attitudes toward work (W, p. 198) and to- ward nature (W, p. 198) in this chapter are equally inconsistent with his attitudes in the rest of the book (cf. W, pp. 102, 125). In such pas- sages Thoreau seems to betray his own cause.25 21 The structural centrality of "The Ponds" is noted by Lane, p. 200, Lynn, p. 602, and Anderson, p. 640. n Anderson, pp. 640, 639. u Anderson, p. 641, says that "Higher Laws" is "the exact complement to the. . . introductory chapter on the lower laws of economic man and fulfills its meaning by being its polar opposite." The true complement of "Economy" is "The Ponds." "Economy" presents Thoreau's criticism of the "lower laws" of economics through rational criticism, a prop- er mode for this level of reality. "The Ponds" presents his praise of the "higher laws" of spiritual man through imagina- tive (symbolic) embodiment, the proper mode for that level. "Higher Laws" is the abstract equivalent of "Economy," not its "exact complement." 1' There is an excellent discussion of the dualist Puritan and monistic pantheist tendencies in Thoreau in Joseph Wood Krutch, Henry David Thoreau (New York, 1948), pp. 167-215. 15 Edward J. Rose, in "The Wit and Wisdom of Thoreau's 'Higher Laws', " Queen's Quarterly, L'X (1963), 555-567,</page><page sequence="9">Melvin E. Lyon 297 The closest he comes to revealing what it is that arouses such fear in him is when he says that "the generative energy, which, when we are loose, dissipates and makes us unclean, when we are continent invigorates and inspires us. Chas- tity is the flowering of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various fruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the channel of purity is open" (W, p. 197). The final sentence is the key one. The man who identifies himself with the pond can keep his purity only if, like Walden, he too has no outlet for his "generative energy" except the heavens. The praise of chastity thus corresponds to an im- portant aspect of the pond. It is even foreshad- owed in "The Ponds," when Thoreau notes that by a "little digging" Walden could be made to flow into the Concord River. "God forbid," he comments, adding that, "if by living thus re- served and austere, like a hermit in the woods, so long, it has acquired such wonderful purity, who would not regret that the comparatively impure waters of Flint's Pond should be mingled with it, or itself should ever go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave?" (W, pp. 175-176).28 Such prep- aration makes it all the more unnecessary for Thoreau to become so vituperative here in "Higher Laws." To explain why he does so would seem to require the psychological biographer rather than the textual explicator.27 "Brute Neighbors" goes with "Higher Laws" as a pair. Here is the first departure from the alternation between chapters dealing with civi- lization and society and those dealing with nature and solitude. "Higher Laws" deals with all four elements, while "Brute Neighbors" deals with nature and natural society. Some earlier chapters have a similar mingling of elements ("Sounds" and "Solitude," for example), but in "Higher Laws" it is more pronounced. This relaxation in the dichotomy is characteristic of the next few chapters. Thoreau would seem to have reached the goal at which the rhythmic alternation of the early chapters aimed. Hence, his focus now (from "The Ponds" to "The Pond in Winter") becomes the area close to Walden. He never mentions go- ing into town; there is increasingly less said about people in town and little about people at all after "Higher Laws," except for a brief section in "Winter Visitors" and the account of the ice cutters in "The Pond in Winter." His concern is completely with the nature he has become a part of.28 In part this is because autumn and especially winter are less favorable than spring and summer to visits and visitors. But the change of season does not explain why Thoreau dwells less upon explicit correspondences in this second section of the book than in the first and more upon what seems to be simple observation and description of nature.29 The answer appears to be that, hav- ing achieved identification, he can now concern himself simply with physical phenomena because for him the spiritual and the physical, both within and without himself, have become one.30 The Buddhist has a similar sense of nature and spirit;3" perhaps St. Francis might be said to have lived in such a state of fusion. Thoreau's experi- ence is not so complete or so non-intellectual, but it is similar. The decrease in the civilization-nature con- flict and in correspondences makes this section of the book less intellectually challenging than the first part. "Brute Neighbors" represents a delib- erate descent from the climactic, if sterile, transcendental heights of "Higher Laws," a deliberate return from the transcendental to the everyday.32 The whimsical dialogue which opens the chapter presents a Hermit and a Poet pre- says that although Thoreau "desires that man pass through what he must condemn in the end, he asserts that man must pass through it so that he can leave it behind" (p. 565). This is true insofar as "what he must condemn" refers to the "wildness" Thoreau accepts at the beginning of the chapter. But it is not true of the "sensuality" that "wildness" be- comes in the course of the chapter and which Thoreau totally condemns. Lynn, pp. 601-602, is closer to my view. 16 The praise of chastity is also foreshadowed in at least one other place in Walden, the final paragraph of "Economy," where Thoreau tells the Persian story which purports to ex- plain why the "cypress, which bears no fruit," is the only tree called "azad, or free" (W, p. 71). 27 There is a suggestive attempt at such an analysis, in terms of Freudian psychology, in Carl Bode, "The Half- Hidden Thoreau," Massachusetts Review, iv (1962), 68-80. (Lynn, p. 602, and especially Krutch, pp. 203-208, discuss Thoreau's "squeamish" attitude toward sexuality.) 28 There is a similar observation, differently interpreted, in Lane, pp. 200-201. 29 A particularly good illustration is his chasing the loon on Walden, described at the end of "Brute Neighbors." But see n. 33. 30 Anderson, p. 640, notes that "wit and metaphor" subside into "simple description" in Thoreau's account of Walden in "The Ponds." '1 Daisetz T.

The Hermit decides to fish rather than go to heaven that day. Immediately afterwards, Thoreau introduces the many nature observations in this section by noting that "ani- mals... are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts" (W, p. 203). This statement is followed, however, by a series of descriptions which are, at most, only implicit correspondences,3 the first (W, p. 204), that implicit association of the partridge with Walden which has already been quoted (p. 290). Thus the "descent" from the transcen- dental in the chapter is not a departure from the pond but only a return from the highest to the humbler aspects of nature. "House-warming" returns to nature-solitude. Its accompanying chapter discusses Thoreau's society during this time. The next pair of chap- ters reverses the usual order and puts the social chapter, "Winter Animals," first, and the soli- tude chapter second, though here the social chap- ter again is not society-civilization but society- nature, while the solitude chapter, "The Pond in Winter," is really solitude-nature-civilization. "Winter Animals" ends by returning to the par- tridges which were implicitly connected with Walden in "Brute Neighbors." Again Thoreau emphasizes their closeness to the basic material and form of nature: "They are among the most simple and indigenous animal products;.. . of the very hue and substance of Nature, nearest allied to the leaves and to the ground" (W, p. 252). This return provides a suitable bridge from the placidity of the chapters since "Brute Neigh- bors" to the renewed concern with the pond and explicit correspondence in "The Pond in Win- ter." In this chapter the account of Walden's frozen state corresponds to the high point of tension in Thoreau's "Walden year." In "The Ponds" he gained his final freedom from society in becoming at one with Walden; here the discipline involved in that identification becomes most intense, but at the end of the chapter he begins to achieve re- lease. The material here is treated less descrip- tively than in "The Ponds." The longest section is the elaborate, though labored, analogy be- tween measuring the depth of the pond and the depth of a man (W, p. 260). The analogy suggests that Thoreau's identification with Walden has become so strained that once again image and concept have separated. Thoreau is ready for re- lease. The chapter passes then to the ice cutters, who give Walden universal relevance by carrying its ice off to market. In the final paragraph Thoreau uses this material fact as the basis for the most important expression of his assertion that at Walden he dwelt closer to other times and places than he did elsewhere.4 The marketing of the ice becomes a sharing of Walden's water and its symbolic divinity with "the priest of Brahma and Vishnu and India" in India, just as he at Walden shares in the priests' holy book, the Bhagavad- Gita. This comparison is not expressed as a labored analogy but with a metaphorical in- tensity that suggests, in concrete, sensuous terms, the transcendental identity of all men in the One. The lyricism of the style expresses Thoreau's joy in his release from the self-imposed restriction of his identification with a particular pond in a particular place at a particular time into the universality of the pond's ice, and its symbolic significance, and therefore his own identity with all those who use its ice, and with all who seek the divine. It is as if that chastity and purity possessed by Walden and Thoreau had reached its ultimate form in the frozen ice and then suddenly found the spiritual release which Thoreau in "Higher Laws" says occurs when "the channel of purity is open." Here, how- ever, Walden and Thoreau do not "flow at once to God" but to the rest of the world and its in- habitants. Through the pure water of Walden and the pure thought of the Bhagavad-Gita Thoreau becomes one with the human multiplic- ity created by that One whose image he and the pond and the book all express. In this paragraph Thoreau achieves his own "Passage to India." This abrupt expansion of self is carried further in "Spring," the second climax of Thoreau's identification with the pond and the climax of the book as a whole.85 There Thoreau achieves per- sonal rebirth by participating in the rebirth of all 33 However, Lynn, p. 603, suggests that "The loon ... is the great embodiment of the spirit of the Pond," and Brenner, pp. 37-40, takes Thoreau at his word and not only makes ex- plicit correspondences out of these seeming descriptions but shows how, together, they make up a coherent and significant pattern. The result of his unprovable argument is an inter- pretation which is probably over-schematic but is still sug- gestive and valuable. " F. 0. Matthiessen, American Renaissance (London, New York, Toronto, 1941), p. 169, notes how in the winter chap- ters "the radius" of Thoreau's "experience contracted then more and more to his immediate surroundings. However, the last pages on the pond deal with the cutting of the ice, and end with the sudden extraordinary expansion of his thought which annihilates space and time." 3' Adams, p. 426; Lynn, pp. 603-604.</page><page sequence="11">Melvin E. Lyon 299 nature. The focus of the chapter, however, is not upon Thoreau and the pond but the whole of which they are but parts. The description of the flowing sandbank is the most significant ex- emplification of the theme. Observing the sand- bank, Thoreau discovers the (leaf) form (W, pp. 273, 275) on which all things in nature are based and the process by which they are made (W, pp. 272-275). This observation reduces himself and the pond to manifestations of something more fundamental than either. This attitude pervades the rest of the chapter, although Thoreau does describe ecstatically the rebirth both of himself and Walden-in the course of which he makes the central thematic statement, "Walden was dead and is alive again" (W, p. 278). In becoming part of nature, Thoreau and the pond have also become part of the relationship which Thoreau views as central to nature, that between the sun and the earth. This relationship determines the seasons-and the external struc- ture of Walden. At this point in the book, there- fore, its internal structure has become one with its larger, external structure. The dominant sym- bol has ceased to be the pond and become spring, the season which manifests that infinite fertility which Thoreau considers the essence of nature. This symbol is accompanied and reinforced by the subordinate symbolism of the morning, spring's counterpart in the minor cycle of the day, and by the earth and sun. In undergoing rebirth, Thoreau is also released from his identification with Walden for the new lives he has still to lead (W, p. 288).A8 In the "Conclusion" he again speaks as a "sojourner in civilization,"37 and writes a civilization chapter which goes with "Spring" as a nature chapter and presents the fruit of the experience he has described in the rest of Walden. Again, as in"Economy," he addresses his neigh- bors. His most extended advice is that they should do as he did, give their genius full reign and thus bring the image of God within them- selves into exclusive possession of their lives. The book ends with two paragraphs which bring to- gether the primary symbols of the work: water and light. In the final paragraph Thoreau seems deliberately to undercut the association of the sun with God by asserting that it "is but a morn- ing star" and thereby suggesting its inadequacy as a symbol to its meaning. Walden, however, is never so undercut. His only reference to it in the "Conclusion" is in a simile, in which he implies the momentariness of that identification with all men which he experienced at the end of "The Pond in Winter." There the export of Walden's ice had led him to comment that the "inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans . . . drank at my well" (W, p. 266). Now he notes of the ice that "Southern customers objected to its blue color, which is the evidence of its purity, as if it were muddy, and preferred the Cambridge ice, which is white, but tastes of weeds. The purity men love is like the mists which envelop the earth, and not like the azure ether beyond" (W, p. 290). Walden remains Thoreau's ultimate image of God upon earth and the central symbol of the work to which it gives its name. III This reading of Walden suggests a duality in its symbolism between the relatively static char- acter of the pond and the dynamism associated with morning and spring. This dualism is miti- gated by Walden's participation in the cycle of the seasons and the static quality spring and morning have because of their annual recurrence. Nonetheless, the emphasis is different and the contrast clear. Walden is Thoreau's (relatively) still point at the center of the turning world, both the world of civilization and of nature. If we accept Lovejoy's account of romanticism in The Great Chain of Being,88 the presence of such a center suggests a new aspect of the fact that Thoreau's is a more limited romanticism than that of Emerson or Whitman. Walden partici- pates in the large natural rhythms of the day and the year which the sun (and the earth's move- ment) creates. It is also a part of a living earth which is constantly creating new life. It is not in- volved in the process of reproduction, however, and, because it is a pond without inlet or outlet, it lacks both the linear movement of a river and the great tidal movements of the sea. It is, there- fore, an expression of that in-turning, centripetal, static deity which Lovejoy says was replaced in the Romantic period by an outgoing, centrifugal deity of process.39 Thoreau's emphasis on its purity and serenity rather than its creativity, 36 For the extent of Thoreau's identification with the sea- sons, see Reginald L. Cook, Passage to Walden (Boston, 1949), p. 158. 37 For this idea of the "Conclusion" as a return to civiliza- tion I am indebted to John Broderick, "The Movement of Thoreau's Prose," and to Moldenhauer, pp. 261-262.

This conservative aspect of Walden is related to the relative firmness and clarity of its struc- ture. The problems for artistic structure posed by a universe of process were only partially relevant to Thoreau because within that process he had found as (momentary) organizing principles for his life and art not only the circular rhythms of the year and the day but a concrete, physical manifestation of permanence able to function as the still center of the turning world. Thus, in part he was able to recapture for his life and his art the broken circle of that seventeenth-century world40 which he admired and to whose art he was in- debted.4' The problem of structure for Emerson and particularly Whitman was much more difficult because theirs was more completely a world of process. Indeed, the static character of Thoreau and his pond is the transcendentalist antithesis of that rapidity of movement and multiplicity of identification which in "Song of Myself" and "The Sleepers" are the personal correlates of Whitman's dynamic universe. The aesthetic ex- pression of such dynamism is a fluidity of struc- ture and of style that would have been wholly inappropriate to Thoreau's experience at Wal- den.
