<plain_text><page sequence="1">Velocem potuit domuisse puellam : Propertius, Catullus, and Atalanta's Race The first book of Propertius' elegies, which we may call Cynthia after the first word of the first poem, was probably written sometime between 30 and 28 B.C. 0). The opening poem of Propertius' elegiac collection introduces the mys- terious figure of Cynthia, the woman who, like a huntress, captured Propertius' hitherto untouched heart, as well as one of the more alluringly enigmatic figures from mythology, the athletic huntress Atalanta (2). The image of the huntress lurks behind the first line of Propertius' poem not just in its use of language ( cepit ), but in his opening word's emphatic naming of the huntress herself, Cynthia, an epithet the elegist intends as an evocation of the Roman goddess Diana (3). The poem's introduction of Diana is followed soon (1) Few Latin poets occasion as much controversy as Propertius, and the declarative opening sentence of this paper conceals a number of points of possible contention : 1) the full name of the poet, 2) the title of the first book of his elegies, and 3) the date of its com- position. None of these questions bears significantly on our thesis ; the bibliography is vast.

In Propertius' narrative, the poem's addressee, Tullus, is reminded that Milanion was able to break down the savagery of Iasius' daughter by shunning no labors (1, 9-10 nullos labores) ; at once Propertius defines said labors more clearly : Milanion was willing to go hunt near Mount Parthenius (Virgin Mount !) (4) in Arcadia, even to the point of being wounded by the club of Hylaeus, a Centaur (5). On account of his willingness to go through the hunt- Horace's use is the first extant example of the epithet in Latin (c. 23 B.C.). Is Tullus a code for Tibullus ? (4) According to Aelian (see below), Mount Parthenius was the site of Atalantaos aban- donment at her father's orders, while in Hyginus it was the site for her abandonment of the baby Parthenopaeus ; Propertius manages to allude to quite a few of the elements of Atalanta lore in a short compass of narrative. In these stories of huntress women, there is often a questionable father ; so Atalanta's in some versions exposes her as an infant, while Camilla's father Metabus, despite his concern for his daughter, was driven out of his home for vague reasons ; cf. Nonnus, Dionysiaca XII, 71-75, where Harpalyce kills her son after her father Clymenus (son of Schoeneus !) rapes her (and is ultimately turned into a bird), and the Servian commentaries ad Virgil, Aeneid III, 317, where Harpalyce's father Harpalycus is driven out of his realm by his own people. Nonnus' grisly story of Harpalyce comes from Parthenius ( Erotika Pathemata 13), inter et apud alios (?, Hyginus certe), where Harpalyce kills her younger brother (not her son) ; Lightfoot ad loc. pro- vides the (scanty) citations of a story that can be traced back to the Hellenistic poet Euphorion. As with Atalanta (!), there apparently were two Harpalyces, one the huntress and the other the victim of incest - though all of these double huntresses (including the seemingly inconsistent portrayal of Virgil's Camilla) begin to become more than coinci- dental. Hyginus identifies two Harpalyces, one the daughter of Harpalycus and the other the daughter of Clymenus ; the former is listed (Fabulae 252), immediately before Camilla, as having been raised by a cow and a mare (Camilla by a mare only, no doubt influenced by her later role in Virgil's equestrian battle). The daughter of Harpalycus is also associated with having saved her father ( Fabulae 254), an interesting opposite to the relations between father and daughter in the lore of the "other" Harpalyce ; in Hyginus (Fabulae 206, 238) the murderous Harpalyce is killed by her father after killing the prod- uct of their incest. Hyginus also groups this Harpalyce with the impiae on account of her child murder (Fabulae 255). (5) Ovid's imitation (Ars Amatoria 11,185-192) is the only other extant source for the story, where see Barchiesi, Women on Top : Livia and Andromache in Gibson, Green, and Sharrock, eds., The Art of Love : Bimillennial Essays on Ovid's Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris , Oxford, 2006, p. 111-112. Ovid has Milanion wounded by a bow, not a club ; the club may imply a more desperate fight than archery (a conscious introduction of mock heroism by Ovid into Propertius' more serious image ?). On the (highly specu- lative) idea the Atalanta story figured in Gallus, whence Propertius, and the seeming con- flation of different Atalanta stories into one in the significant adjective uelocem , see Hardie, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women and Latin Poetry in Hunter, ed., The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women : Constructions and Reconstructions , Cambridge, 2005, p. 295. Ovid also mentions the uelox Atalanta during his tour de force catalogue ad Ibis 369-370, and alludes to the Calydonian boar hunt and Meleager's awarding of the pelt to Atalanta as a token of his affection at Heroides 4, 99-100 (Phaedra to Hippolytus, appropriately</page><page sequence="3">344 L. FRATANTUONO ing gauntlet and face the monster, as it were, Milanion was able to defeat the swift girl (15 ergo uelocem potuit domuisse puellam). Propertius assures us that both prayers and deeds (16 preces et bene facta) are able to profit a man in love ; for the hunting, we can assume that Milanion might invoke Diana, while for love, we can ascribe his prayers to Venus : a dangerous combination of contradictions, not unlike his objet d'amour , Atalanta. Propertius begins his book of love elegies with both Diana and Atalanta, respectively the first name and the first mytho- logical exemplum in his poetic œuvre. Propertius does not need to explain the significance of his calling Atalanta "swift" : the story of Atalanta's race would have been well-known to his audi- ence. Admittedly, all huntresses can be expected to be swift, but given the rich lore surrounding Atalanta's race, the adjective is not accidental or merely orna- mental. Not coincidentally, the image of the fleet-footed huntress also occurs near the beginning of the Catullan corpus, in the fragment that is found after the famous sparrow poem (c. 2 Passer) that "opens" Catullus' extant collection of polymetric poems (after his introductory address to the collection's dedicatee, Cornelius Nepos, c. 1), where it appears as the first mythological allusion in the Catullan liber : tarn gratum est mihi quam ferunt puellae / pernici aureolum fuisse malum , / quod zonam soluit diu ligatam (6). It is difficult to see how these three lines can be connected to the preceding lyric, which is not without major textual problems of its own (7). Even more problematic, though, would be explaining how this fragment of another poem appeared where it did in the tra- dition, and explicating what is supposed to be as pleasing to Catullus as the gold- en apple was to Atalanta. Catullus offers details of the famous story that Propertius barely alludes to with his description of the uelox puella ; the apple was the trick Atalanta's suitor used to win her. Considering the usual end of the myth, the apple was not, in the end, a token of good fortune for Atalanta, which adds another level of interest and intrigue to the mystery of what Catullus meant as a point of comparison. enough) ; at Heroides 21, 123 (where see Kenney's note), Cydippe reproaches Acontius with cowardice : an apple took her, just as an apple took the daughter of Schoeneus ; evi- dently Acontius will now be a second Hippomenes (who was willing to risk death for his love). (6) All quotes from Catullus are taken from Mynors, G. Valerii Catulli Carmina , Oxford, 1958.

The (very old) myth is first found in surviving literature in a fragment of Hesiod from (fortasse) the beginning of the second book of his Eoeae , the Catalogue of Women (8). The verses tell of Atalanta, the daughter of Schoeneus, swift and beautiful (indeed, like the Graces in her radiance), and desirous of escaping marriage with any mortal man. Schoeneus was the son of Athamas by Themisto (9). Traces of some five further lines are followed by more substantial remains (fr. 75 and fr. 76 Merkelbach- West/48 Most) that clearly describe a swift girl and the sexually charged scene of the Zephyr's breeze fluttering her tunic around her breasts as suitors watch (10). The story of the race is then told with tantalizing clarity : the agree- ment of the suitor to run a race against the maiden under a promise of either mar- riage or execution, the throwing of the three apples to distract Atalanta from the race, the breathless end of the race, where the suitor has won and stands panting as the papyrus fragment breaks off. This narrative is the famous race that is the most commonly associated myth with Atalanta ; Hesiod says that she ran as swift as a Harpy (n), though in the end Aphrodite's gift of the apples was her undo- (8) Eoeae fr. 73 Merkelbach- West (47 Most). On the question of the placement of the Atalanta narrative in the Hesiodic corpus, see d'Alessio, The Megalai Ehoiai : A Survey of the Fragments in Hunter, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women : Constructions and Reconstructions , Cambridge, 2005, p. 213-216, and West, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women , Oxford, 1983, p. 49-50 : his idea that "truly exciting" narratives like the foot race may have ended books is appealing. (9) Athamas' other son by the same mother was Leucon ; according to Hesiod (fr. 70 Merkelbach- West/41 Most) two daughters of Leucon married grandsons of Orchomenus, the son of Minyas. Orchomenus in Boeotia was a cult site for the Graces ; is there a connection between Atalanta, like to the Graces, and the marriages of her cousins to the descendants of Orchomenus ? See further West on Hesiod, Theogony 907- 909, and Janko on Homer, Iliad XIV, 267-270. Orchomenus was in northwest Boeotia and famous for Hesiod's grave (and Minyas' !) ; perhaps there is also a conflation of the Boeotian city with the east Arcadian Orchomenus, a polis that by Roman times had faded into obscurity. Pausanias (VIII, 35, 10) wonders if Schoeneus from Boeotia emigrated to Arcadia, where he notes the so-called race-courses ( dromoi ) of Atalanta near Schoenus. (10) A Homeric scholium (fr. 74 Merkelbach- West/50 Most) argues that Hesiod is more recent than Homer, because he introduces Atalanta and her suitor Hippomenes in naked competition ; it is perhaps difficult to reconcile this assertion with Hesiod's descrip- tion of the seductive power of Atalanta's chiton as it is blown around her breasts by the west wind. Merkelbach- West ad loc. wonder where Hippomenes hid the apples, if he were naked as he ran. Perhaps the point is that the Zephyr blew the chiton over her breasts, thereby exposing them. But this seems unlikely. See further West, The Hesiodic Cata- logue of Women, Oxford, 1983, p. 135. (11) Diana is the mistress of animals, and those associated with her are connected to animals. An intriguing detail in the extant fragments of Hesiod on Atalanta is her afore- mentioned comparison to a swift Harpy (fr. 76 Merkelbach- West/48 Most 18[43]) : Atalanta grasps the apple the way a Harpy might, both rapaciously, that is, and swiftly.</page><page sequence="5">346 L. FRATANTUONO ing (,2). In Hesiod Atalantaos father Schoeneus is the clear arbiter of the race, pos- sibly its instigator (though this is not certain) (13). So who was Atalanta's father, Schoeneus (as in Hesiod), or Iasius (as in our Propertian elegy) ? More light on Propertius' elegy is shed by Callimachus {In Dianam 215-224), in an important passage where Atalanta, daughter of Iasius , is commended as a skilled hunter (both with dogs and the bow) and praised as swift-footed, famous for her slaying of boars, and victor over the Centaurs Hylaeus and Rhoecus. Appropriately enough for a hymn to Diana, there is no mention of Atalanta's loves or even her suitors ; we can smile now, perhaps, at Propertius' mention of the story of the Centaur Hylaeus : Milanion may have been wounded by the equine monster, but Atalanta killed him. The mention of boar hunting firmly connects the Callimachean Atalanta to the famous Calydonian boar hunt (on which more later). In earlier Greek verse, Atalanta is also the daughter of Iasius in "Theognis" (14), where the (blond) Atalanta attempts to flee her home to avoid marriage, but in the end succumbs to Aphrodite, though just how is left unspecified by the poet. The pseudo-Apollodoran Library , which is exceedingly difficult to date specifically, but cannot be earlier than around the middle of the first century B.C., gives yet more information on our mysterious girl. Iasus (not Iasius !) had There may be some connection here to the complex lore surrounding the mysterious "Harpalyce", the "snatcher she-wolf', and the folkloric origins of Virgil's Camilla in native Italian myth. There may also be a connection between Harpalyce, Camilla, et aliae (?) and the rapacious Harpies, personifications of the storm winds, noted for their swiftness and their (akin to lupine) rapacity. Virgil compares Camilla to a raptor that evis- cerates a dove in a celebrated simile ; see further above on Nonnus' Harpalyce and her bird metamorphosis. For more on the whole matter, including Camilla's possible lycan- thropy and anthropomorphic beast women in general, see further my Posse pûtes : Virgil's Camilla , Ovid's Atalanta in C. Deroux, ed., Studies in Latin Literature and Roman History XII, 2005, Brussels, p. 185-193, and especially my Madness Unchained : A Reading of Virgil's Aeneid, Lanham, Maryland, 2007, p. 14-15 and 335ff. Ovid models his Atalanta step by step after Virgil's Camilla ; the two poets use both women as source material for psychological reflections on the conflicted nature of adolescent females. Schoeneus is the father of Harpalyce in Hyginus, Fabulae 206 ; see further Lightfoot, Parthenius of Nicaea, Oxford, 1999, p. 448 n. 177. (12) The apples seem to have appealed to the Hellenistic poets ; cf. Theocritus, Idyll , 3,40-42 with Gow's note, and especially Hunter's, and Philetas (fr. 18 Powell, quoted by the scholiast on Theocritus, Idyll 2, 120). See further the classic study of Littlewood, The Apple in Greek and Roman Literature in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 72, 1968, p. 147-181, with its valuable collection of the ancient references to the apples of Hippomenes and Atalanta (p. 152-153). (13) Servius tells the whole story in his note ad Virgil, Aeneid III, 1 13 : he seems to blame Atalanta for the idea of the race, not her father.

Iasius/Iasus was a son of Lycurgus and a descendant of Areas, the son of Diana's devotee Callisto by Jupiter : an appropriate lineage for the virgin huntress Atalanta (l5). She was exposed to wild animals because her father wanted a son ; she was suckled and reared by a she-bear, and grew up in the forests alone as a huntress. To this peri- od of her adolescence Apollodorus ascribes the story of the Centaurs Hylaeus and Rhoecus and their deaths at her hand after they tried to rape her. Briefly, Apollodorus also mentions her participation in the Calydonian boar hunt. Finally, and without comment, he tells us that she reunited with her father, who urged her to marry. Here we learn of her decision to offer the race contest for her hand, and the successful attempt by Melanion (not Milanion, the Latinized form) to win her with the apples from Aphrodite. The marriage ends badly ; the two young lovers try to satisfy their lust in a precinct sacred to Zeus, where they are turned into lions (,6). Apollodorus, as befits a mythographer, knows about the same confusion we suffer. Having summarized her life, he proceeds to note that Hesiod ("and some others") say she was the daughter of Schoeneus, and - to increase the mayhem - he observes that in Euripides she is the daughter of Maenalus, and that her hus- band was not Melanion, but Hippomenes (17). The marriage, however short-lived, (15) And, also, another of the connections of these Diana-like women to anthropo- morphic animals, since both Callisto and Areas, mother and son, were changed into bears. (16) Once "liberated" from her virginal existence by Aphrodite's apples and Hippo- menes/Milanion's persistence, Atalanta gives in (excessively) to sexuality. See further Gibson on Ovid, Ars Amatoria III, 775-776, where the heroine's legs appear in a decid- edly sexual allusion. At Ovid, Amores III, 2, 29-32, Atalanta's legs are again praised (a seeming fixation for Ovid), with a mention also of Diana's legs and their attractiveness as she hunts - another link between the two huntresses. On Atalanta's sexuality, note also the highly mysterious passage of Suetonius, Tiberius 44, 2, where the debauched emperor is said to have had a painting of Parrhasius depicting Atalanta performing fellatio on Meleager ( vel sim.) - a pornographic commentary on her childhood exposure to the suck- ling of wild animals ? Osborne's comment on the women of the Hesiodic Catalogue is apposite here : "The women of the Catalogue always, and repeatedly, attract men by their appearance. They attract by their beauty, by their hair, by the glimpse of their ankles. If they engage in unwomanly activity, as Atalanta does, other parts of their body may come to male attention." (Osborne, Ordering Women in Hesiod' s Catalogue in Hunter, ed., The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women : Constructions and Reconstructions , Cambridge, 2005, p. 13-15). The emphasis Propertius places at the beginning of c. 1, 1 on how he learned how to hate chaste girls (5 castas odisse puellas) may reflect this (Hellenistic ?) characterization of a sexually liberated Atalanta. (17) Pace the aforementioned Homeric scholiast, who observes that Hippomenes was named in Hesiod, I note that no fragment of the Eoeae yet uncovered names "Hippo- menes" as her suitor (though note Most's admittedly attractive reconstruction at fr. 48, 15). Is it possible that the name (an epithet of sorts ?) has associations with his beloved's connections to wild animals ? Pseudo- Apollodorus also mentions Atalanta (the daughter</page><page sequence="7">348 L. FRATANTUONO may have resulted in a son ; Apollodorus knows a tradition that Atalanta gave birth to Parthenopaeus (Virgin Face !), either by Hippomenes or, interestingly, Ares (,8). In Apollodorus, Iasus is the brother of Amphidamas, the father of Melanion - an interesting romantic connection between first cousins (19). In the Latin mythographer Hyginus ( Fabulae 185), Atalanta actually chases the suitors in the race with a blade and dispatches them once she overtakes them : the image of the beautiful destroyer huntress in all its sanguinary aestheticism, a perversion of the nuptial rites into some horrific, sexually charged act of violence against the would-be suitors. The late fourth century B.C. (possibly) mythographer Palaephatus is the ear- liest surviving source for the story that the new lovers were swiftly changed into lions ; he does not offer explanation (20). In Ovid's Metamorphoses (X, 681-704), the couple offended not Jupiter/Zeus but Cybele, who changed them into the lions that draw her chariot (21). Ovid may not shed light on his predecessor Propertius' elegy, but he does offer two distinct Atalanta narratives : the afore- mentioned story of Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus, who married Hippomenes after the fateful race with its golden apples, and the Calydonian boar hunt (VIII, 316 ff.), where, significantly, Atalanta is named only in periphrasis (VIII, 317 nemorisque decus Tegeaea Lycaei), and without mention of a father. Atalanta arouses the lust of Meleager, who awards her the hide of the boar after his suc- cessful vanquishing of it ; after he is upbraided for his infatuation with the Arcadian girl, he kills his mocking uncles in a fit of rage and is subsequently destroyed by his mother Althaea (22). Atalanta vanishes from Ovid's narrative, her of Schoeneus !) in connection with the Calydonian boar hunt (I, 8, 2) and on Jason's Argo (I, 9, 16), both in mere catalogues. (18) The only martial image in the huntress' mythology ; the detail is of interest in comparing Atalanta's lore to the Volscian Camilla. Pausanias (III, 12, 9) mentions hero shrines of Hippolytus and the "Arcadian Aulon", son of Tlesimenes, a brother or son of Parthenopaeus, son of Melanion - an interesting connection between of Artemis' devotee Hippolytus and a descendant of Atalanta. Hyginus (Fabulae 99) derives the name Parthenopaeus from Atalanta's attempt to simulate virginity by exposing the son born to her by Meleager on Mount Parthenius in Arcadia - the mother repeating the sins of her own father. Hyginus ( Fabulae 270) furthers ranks Parthenopaeus among the most hand- some of mortal men. (19) See further Gantz, Early Greek Myth : A Guide to the Literary and Artistic Sources , Baltimore, 1993, p. 335. (20) But Hesiod seems to have known the story also, teste Philodemo ; see further Merkelbach-West fr. 51/Most 72. (21) In Nonnus' Dionysiaca (XII, 87-89), Aphrodite's apples are blamed for Atalanta's marriage, and it is Artemis (no doubt offended at her devotee's abandonment of her vir- ginal lifestyle) who changes Atalanta (the man is not named) into a lioness and drives her insane. (22) The story is also told by Diodorus Siculus (c. 80 B.C.-20 B.C.) in his history (XXXIV, 4, 4-6). Atalanta is the daughter of Schoeneus. Note also Pausanias VIII, 45, 2,</page><page sequence="8">VELOCEM POTVrr DOMVISSE PVELLAM 349 mere presence at the hunt having given sufficient justification for such attitudes as that of the cautious Jason in Apollonius Rhodius, who would not let the attrac- tive girl on board his Argo (23). Aelian (с. A.D. 170 - с. 235) opens Book XIII of his Varia Historia with Ata- lanta, the Arcadian daughter of Iasion (a third variant of the same name). He tells the story of her abandonment in the forest and the suckling by the she-bear, as well as her shunning the company of men. Aelian lavishes his descriptive tal- ents on both her cave in the remote haunts of Arcadia and her appearance ; as in the Theognidea , his Atalanta is blond - and a natural one at that (24). One night her solitary serenity is invaded by those Centaurs Hylaeus and Rhoeceus who make cameo appearances in Atalanta lore ; she kills them both with her bow. Ovid, it might seem, was aware that there may have been two Atalantas, dif- ferent mythological women (however similar in some respects) who were con- flated into one either at some fixed point in the tradition or by various authors at various times in a veritable celebration of chaos (25). If two women, then the one (Schoeneus' daughter) would be associated with the race and its golden apples, while the other (Iasius' daughter) would be the abandoned infant who was raised in the forest alone and under the care of wild animals, and who ends up partici- where Atalanta is named as the first to have hit the boar, and VIII, 45, 2, where Atalanta is one of the sculpted figures in a depiction of the hunt attributed to Scopas the Parian in a temple to Athena Alea. The tragic story of the hunt and Meleager's ill-fated infatuation with Atalanta was the subject of a play of Euripides. Pseudo- Apollodorus (III, 9, 2) notes that in Euripides Atalanta ended up married to Hippomenes - but there is extant no frag- ment of Euripides to substantiate this claim, let alone a play title in the Library. (23) Argonautica I, 769. (24) The blond hair fixation of the poets also recurs in the brilliant synthesis of Statius, Thebaid IV, 246-344, where Atalanta's son Parthenopaeus is described at length before he enters battle. Statius combines Virgil's Camilla narrative - where Diana bemoans her devotee's entry into war - with Ovid's Atalanta narrative : Atalanta recalls how she once saved her son from a deadly boar, in an evocation of the cautionary frame story of Venus and Adonis in which Ovid sets Atalanta's race. (25) Pausanias, as we have noted, was aware of the geographically different locales for various aspects of the Atalanta mythos - but he was also aware that mythological charac- ters can migrate and relocate. Ovid's Venus tells the cautionary tale of Atalanta and Hippomenes to her ill-fated hunter-lover Adonis. Did Milanion join Meleager in dying, quasi-innocent victims of the destroyer Atalanta before she returned to her father and experienced her fractured attempt to reenter the "civilized" world through the marriage to Hippomenes and the attendant race ? If so, the vexed tradition of her father's identity remains unexplained : it may reflect very early confusion over the different facets/phases of the young heroine's life - a confusion Virgil, and Ovid after him, apparently appreci- ated well in the crafting of their respective Camilla and Atalanta, who both (especially Virgil's Camilla) experience quite strange, indeed near inconsistent changes of lifestyle.</page><page sequence="9">350 L. FRATANTUONO pating in such feats of valor as Meleager's Calydonian boar hunt (26). Yet in Ovid our heroine seems to drift off as if in a daze after the boar hunt in Book VIII of the Metamorphoses , only to appear two books later as the subject of a lengthy story of Venus to her lover Adonis on the need to avoid hunting dangerous game such as lions : the story of Hippomenes and the race. If there were two Atalantas, Ovid does not seem to care much. In Propertius, the daughter of Iasius is most- ly associated with the Centaur Hylaeus and Milanion's willingness to follow her on the hunt, but she is also swift - stock epithet for a huntress, to be sure, but a bit more significant an adjective when coupled with the famous story of the race and Catullus' explicit mention of the same myth at the beginning of his collec- tion of poetry (27). In Catullus we have a clear evocation of the race, while in Propertius the race gets a brief nod, while the image of the swift huntress and all Milanion was willing to do to win her is highlighted (28). We do not know the context of Catullus' allusion to Atalanta, and can only make the observation that whatever ends up as pleasing to the poet as the gold- en apple was to Atalanta must be viewed with great caution and foreboding ; the apple ended up destroying Atalanta as she reverted, in a sense, to what she was : the girl raised by wild beasts becomes one herself. In Propertius, the story makes far more sense in situ , and is eminently suited to the poet's theme : Cynthia is his passion, the virgin huntress Diana, unattainable and impossible to placate always and forever. Atalanta is her mortal avatar, winnable, to be sure, but in the end spelling destruction for her lover (29). (26) Atalanta appears as the final figure in the Ovidian catalogue of hunters at Calydon and in Hyginus' similar listing ( Fabulae 173) ; Arcadia is the last city he lists as having sent aid to Oeneus. (27) Presuming, of course, that Propertius' Catullus had the "fragment" c. 2b in a posi- tion reasonably close to the beginning of whatever the Catullan Liber was that c. 1 intro- duces. (28) Propertius opens his Cynthia as if it were a hunting manual, a quasi-autobio- graphical didactic guide for the lover. So Xenophon also mentions Meilanion's ability to win Atalanta, in clear allusion to the same story Propertius knows, near the beginning of his own guide for hunters ( Cynegetica I, 7) : the praeceptor amoris is composing an ars uenandi ; perhaps the Latin love poets were amused by the similarity between Venus and uenor, uenari. Pausanias (V, 19, 2) mentions a chest decorated with, inter alia, Melanion and Atalanta, who is holding a fawn ; see further Carpenter, Art and Myth in Ancient Greece , London, 1991, p. 186-187, 196. (29) So, too, does Camilla spell doom for Turnus in the Aeneid , after his emotionally overwrought reaction to her death leads him to abandon the ambush that would have meant ruin for Aeneas ; see further my Trickery and Deceit in Aeneid XI in Maia N.S. 57, 1, 2005, p. 35-36, and my Madness Unchained , Lanham, Maryland, 2007, p. 355-356. The war in Italy serves to deflect any possible romantic encounter between Turnus and Camilla (despite the Rutulian prince's clear attachment to the Volscian huntress). If Camilla were known to Italian folklore before Virgil (a quite vexed question), there may</page><page sequence="10">VELOCEM POTVIT DOMVISSE PVELLAM 35 1 Propertius was once proud (1,1,3 constantis... fastus) and above the tempta- tions of love and desire ; so, too, it seems, was "Melanion" (again, the spelling variants bedevil the whole tradition). The best surviving account of Atalanta's lover's original shunning of the affairs of sex is Aristophanes' Lysistrata , where the men's chorus tells the tale of Melanion, a young man who went off to the for- est as a child to spend his time hunting and avoiding the company of women, whom he hated (30). Presumably he found Atalanta in the forest, where he under- went a transformation from misogynist to devotee of the beautiful young huntress. Mythological confusion, then, reigns supreme in the case of Atalanta (what Gow called an "inextricable" problem). The confusion, in fact, became a part of the tradition, no doubt appropriately given the otherworldly aura of the young huntress. Among the great Latin poets, two (Catullus and Propertius) chose to begin their collections with her, while another two (Virgil and Ovid) devote sig- nificant attention in their magna opera to reflections on the paradoxes posed by young devotees of Diana who cross over into the world of men (Camilla in the Aeneid , Atalanta in the Metamorphoses , who is modeled after Virgil's heroine step). Greek and Italian folklore apparently had a rich lore surrounding young women who were, in origin, probably lycanthropic or otherwise anthropomor- phic (3I). These women had a natural affinity for the forest and Diana, befitting their bestial nature. Their "secret" kept them from the world of civilization and marriage ; doom befell them (and their husbands) if they attempted wedlock. The double nature of their lives, as animals and alluring young women, is reflected in the paradoxical contradictions of their tormented lives. In no small way, as devotees of Diana and, in most cases, victims of violent and irascible fathers (and curiously absent mothers), they provide some of literature's earliest reflections have been some appreciation for the C-a connection between Camilla and Cynthia (a trick Virgil is fond of ; cf. Anna and Acca in the tragedies of both Dido and Camilla, besides the obvious pairs Aeneas/Achilles and Pallas/Patroclus. (30) Lysistrata 781/2-795/6 Henderson. Henderson, ad loc. (note also his abbreviated note in his Loeb edition) thinks Aristophanes may be referring to a variant of the myth in which Atalanta was a sort of divine companion to the hunter Melanion, akin to Artemis/Hippolytus. But it seems far more natural to assume that Melanion, like Atalanta, hated the company of the opposite sex and sought refuge in the woods, where at last he met the one woman who changed his mind. This interpretation fits better with Propertius' apparent knowledge of the story. Aristophanes, then, offers a confirmatory detail about Melanion's original misogyny, which accords well with Propertius' narrative use of the exemplum.

FRATANTUONO on the plight of women who have suffered abuse : their virginity is often a con- sequence of their affiliation with Diana, not a voluntary vocation to the ascetic life. Their very nature as unattainable objects of desire, perpetual would-be vir- gins despite their sexual attractiveness, made them an irresistible object of fasci- nation for the elegists. The Latin poetic tradition not only celebrated the confusion inherent in the Atalanta tradition, but also used it as metaphor for the conflicts and personality inconsistencies displayed in the lives of these Diana-like young women. Venus may have been the goddess who favored lovers and cast her capricious spells over the infatuated. But the Roman elegists were all the while fixated on Diana, her divine opposite and quasi-rival. In the immortal battle for the hearts of love's poets, Diana's arrows were more certain than Cupid's. Ohio Wesleyan University , Delaware , Ohio, USA. Lee Fratantuono.
