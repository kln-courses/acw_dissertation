<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zrdhaeological 3inatitute of fmerica MYCENAEAN PLUMES IN a recent article entitled " The Ring of Nestor" Sir Arthur Evans mentions that among other objects found in a tomb at Thisbe, from which the ring in question came, there was "a whole set of perforated glass paste objects, with holes below for the attachment of glass disks, which Mr. Wace has now conclusively shown to be- long to necklaces." Formerly Evans had stated 2 that "the exact application of these objects remains uncertain, but it seems clear that they served as brackets or supports;" and still earlier3 had described them as consoles "forming part of a cornice." And Bell,4 evidently following Evans's lead, says of them, "It has been sug- gested that they were used side by side as a continuous ledge or string course, but their small size-about three inches in length- seems inconsistent with their use in architecture. A brass matrix in the Ashmolean museum implies that they were moulded for use as applied ornament such as ears for vases. They are chiefly interest- ing as giving a primitive form of modillion which is characteristic of the Corinthian order of architecture and which occurs excep- tionally on the north door of the Erechtheion." There is something arresting in the extraordinary versatility of a bit of abstract ornament which can be considered chiefly interesting as a prototype of the Corinthian modillion, and then by simple in- version in the hands of Mr. Wace, be cordially accepted as part of a necklace. The contrast between these two interpretations is so great that the question inevitably arises whether either is certainly correct. Wace's accepted conclusion is reached in a careful study of the object--the only one so far made, I believe-appended to the report of his excavations at Mycenae.5 Instead of calling it a "modillion" he christens the object in question "the curled leaf ornament"; both names are really suitable to the form, though they apply best to different stages of its development. The earliest examples found in Greece are made of gold (Fig. 1) and consist of three elements: (a) long oblanceolate leaves, with central ribs and ribbed edges, which curve outward from the base to the broadest part, and from 1 J.H.S., 1926, p. 1; also published separately, Macmillan, London. 2 Palace of Minos, I, p. 488. 3 B.S.A., IX, pp. 65-66. 4 Hellenic Architecture, p. 29. 5 B.S.A., XXV (1921-23), pp. 398-402. The theory was almost simultaneously advanced by Maiuri (Ann. della Scuola di Atene, VI (1923), p. 101, fig. 19) that the objects were strung together in the position suggested by Wace and worn above the forehead in such a way that the series of square plaques formed a continuous diadem from which the "leaves," imitating a series of curled locks, hung like a bang. The principal objection to this theory is that it is the later forms only which resembled frizzed hair. See below. 173</page><page sequence="2">174 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY there to the tip are rolled inward in a complete circular loop; alternat- ing with these are (b) lanceolate leaves, broadest at the base, ribbed in the center and at the edges, which curve simply outward to a point in line with the greatest projection and greatest length of the adjacent roll. These lanceolate leaves usually have chains of small gold disks and rings fastened to their tips. Both sets of leaves spring from (c) rectangular plaques, approximately square, with beaded ribs at top and bottom which form continuous bands if two or more elements be set side by side. In the center of the plaque there is almost always a circular area, sunk as if to hold an inlay of some sort. Usually two leaves, one of each type, spring from the ribbed edge of a plaque, and from behind their tips spring ............. FIGURE 1.

The terminal curled leaf is usually longer than the others, sometimes it is slightly broader also, in which case the accompanying lanceolate leaf becomes narrower or shorter in relation to the rolled leaf. Apparently we have to do with a conventionalized natural form of some sort, which is eminently suited to execution in gold. In the later examples of the ornament (Fig. 2), glass paste, cast in a mold and then gilded, is substituted for true metal work. The result is a progressive series beginning with a labored imitation of the gold- smith's technique, where the pairs of leaves are cast separately and then joined to make the compound unit (Fig. 2, c+d = e) and ending in a form which gives little indication of its metallic ancestry, where the plaque and three or four pairs of leaves are all cast in a single piece (Fig. 2, a, b). At the same time the conventionaliza- tion increases until the whole perhaps suggests some structural architectural member rather more than any natural object. In one</page><page sequence="3">HOLLAND: M YCENAEAN PLUMES 175 exampleI which probably comes at the very end of the series, the form has degenerated still further into a mere series of rolls ending in a crudely modelled female head and bust (Fig. 3). Wace says of this: "the original form of the ornament was by now forgotten and obscured," 2 and he is undoubtedly correct. Both gold and paste examples have holes bored in them in such a way that they could be strung together side by side, or fastened in that position to some background, presumably of fabric. The length varies from .02 m. to over .08 m.; the largest examples, it is needless to say, are of paste, but the majority, both of gold and paste, measure from .035 m. to .045 m. The ornament occurs so frequently in Mycenaean tombs of the better class that it would FIGURE 2. "CURLED-LEAF ORNAMENT. IN GLASS PASTE FROM MYCENAE (a, c-i) AND SPATA (b) (13 size) FIGURE 3. GLASS PASTE ORNAMENT FROM MYCENAE (natural size) seem to have formed a conventional object of personal adornment. The evidence of the excavations bears out the chronological ar- rangement which the development of form suggests. Wace 3 be- lieves the earliest known example in Greece to be that from Argos (Fig. 1, d). This he dates in L. H. II and considers that all others in gold are of the same general period, while all the paste examples he places in L. H. III. The fact that one gold example from Mycenae (Fig. 1, a) has its plaque decorated with basket work instead of with the usual sunken circle, would seem to place it at one end or the other of the series; since it can be dated L. H. II we may safely say that at that period the form was in its youth, not far removed from some natural prototype, and had not yet crystallized into a set convention. 1 Praktika, 1886, p. 78; Arch.

Wace 1 cites one L. H. III example in glass paste from Kalyvia near Phaestos,2 a steatite mold from Knossos 3 and a curled leaf of ivory which resembles part of the gold form in question, but much more closely the handles of an alabaster vase from Mycenae.4 Evans says sweepingly, "faience specimens of such objects have been found both at Knossos and in mainland Greece," but he mentions specifically only an example from Messenian Pylos,6 which as Wace 7 points out, is of glass paste. Wace mentions no examples in faience, and so far as I am aware, none has been found on the mainland or in Crete.8 The fact that the paste examples were often gilded in imitation of the original gold ornaments, and that faience was unsuited for gilding, readily explains why this material was not commonly used. The steatite mold from Knossos, which Evans9 dates as "probably belonging to L. M. I," was made, he says, for casting faience. Of course nothing about the mold itself indicates whether it was for faience or for paste; and since the dating is qualified with a "prob- ably"-the details of the provenance, "a dependency to the North West of the palace," are not given l0-while the form of the object corresponds exactly, even to the circular sinkage in the base plaque, with the L. H. III examples in paste from the mainland, it seems to me highly improbable that it antedates the gold prototypes of the mainland castings. The authoritative examples from Crete then, reduce to two; one in paste from Kalyvia, of L. M. III, which as Wace 11 suggests may 1 Op. cit., p. 398. 2 Mon.

The alabaster handles were made separately and attached with pins. The ivory curl is much smaller than the alabaster handles, but the form is strikingly similar, even in section. I should suppose that the Cretan curl came from a small vase made of gold and ivory. The shape of the alabaster vase suggests a metal prototype; it also recalls shapes shown on Egyptian monuments of the eighteenth dynasty. Wainwright (Liverpool Ann., VI (1913-14), p. 48 and pl. XIV, No. 6) considers it related to a Syrian type (ibid., pl. IX, 7). 5 Pal.ace of Minos, I, p. 488. 6 Arch.

The fact that rosettes of gold leaf were set in the sinkages in the plaques, while similar examples, of blue glass paste from tomb IV (op. cit. p. 101, figs. 17-19) had inset rosettes of greenish paste, suggests that the faience examples were ungilded save for the rosette, while the other series may have been gilded in part, or not at all. 9 Loc. cit.; Wace (op. cit., p. 398), probably because of obscurity in this passage in the Palace of Minos, gives the still earlier date, M. M. III. 10The "North West Building" of Vol. I is probably the same as the "North West Treasury" of Vol. II, but in the description of the latter I can find no mention of the steatite matrix. It is perhaps significant that among other objects found at that point is the painted clay base of a circular stand which unquestionably dates from the end of L. M. III (Evans, op. cit., II, fig. 390, pp. 619-620). 11 Op. cit., p. 399.</page><page sequence="5">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 177 be an importation from the mainland; the other, the mold for a similar object from Knossos, of uncertain date, but possibly also L. M. III. To all intents and purposes the ornament is purely a mainland form, appearing in L. H. II and developing throughout L. H. III, at which period occasional examples probably made their way, along with other expressions of mainland culture, to Crete.' The holes for fastening the ornament and the asymetric arrange- ment of one curled-leaf and one lanceolate-leaf element to every unit of the base plaque, leaves no doubt that the units were to be set close together to form a continuous band. But there may be doubt that this band was a necklace. Wace's conclusion that it was such, seems to be based on the assumption 2 that the plaque was at the top of the ornament with the leaves pendant from it, and on the observation 3 that "the top (i.e., the plaque) is always narrower than the bottom (the curl) so that when threaded the ornaments, as the units of a necklace, make a wide curve." Among the exam- ples which he illustrates, however (Figs. 1 and 2), there is only one (Fig. 1, b) in which the curl is noticeably wider than the plaque, and in this one the lanceolate leaves are lacking. If the latter were made separately, as in other gold examples, and inserted on plaques of their own between the plaques of the curled leaves, the wedge shape of the latter would lose all significance. In some of the examples shown (e.g., Fig. 1, a; Fig. 2, f, h, compare Fig. 3) the sides do not appear to me to diverge at all, while in those which are unquestion- ably somewhat wedge-shaped the divergence is so slight that if joined side by side on a flat surface, the resultant circle would be far too great for a necklace or even for a girdle.4 In order to form a circle small enough to be worn upon the neck the elements would have to lie almost at right angles to the plane of the circle, thus pro- ducing a collar with nearly vertical sides. But if they were joined in this way there is no certainty as to the size of circle they formed: it might have been small enough for a bracelet-with some of the smaller examples at least-or large enough for the hem of a coat. As for the plaque being at the top, I can see no evidence in support of this except that it would make a better necklace so, and even this would be of little weight with a necklace of the collar type. On the other hand, in the late example with the human head (Fig. 3) it is very certain that the head was right side up, and the plaque con- 1 Examples, of L. H.

The width across the center of the plaque is 0.0195 m., and at the widest part of the curl 0.0225 m. The distance between these points of measurement is 0.06 m. If the pieces were laid flat, side by side, the circle through the center of the plaques would have a diameter of 0.78 m.</page><page sequence="6">178 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY sequently at the bottom. Wace I says this "was apparently in- verted," but it is hardly credible that an ornament of long and fixed tradition as to form would ever be worn upside down. To invert a well known object, notoriously produces burlesque. While I think Wace is surely right in considering the ornament an article of personal adornment rather than an architectural motif, the evidence seems to me against rather than in favor of its being a necklace. Furthermore in all the considerable repertoire of My- cenaean costume shown in fresco fragments there is no representa- A B FIGURE 4. A, FRESCO FRAGMENT FROM MYCENAE; B, FIGURE FROM HAGIA TRIADA SARCOPHAGUS tion of any necklace which at all suggests this ornament. On the other hand, a fragment of fresco illustrated by Rodenwaldt 2 (Fig. 4, A) shows a series of triple incurled forms which for linear indica- tion are as accurate representations of the "curled-leaf ornament" as one could wish; and here certainly a necklace is not shown. This fragment is, unfortunately, so small that it shows nothing but three repeats of the ornament and an adjacent detached stripe which formed part of the enclosing frame of the picture. By assuming this stripe to be at the top, the curls fall into the proper place to form the front edge of a crown. This interpretation of the fragment is ac- cepted by Miss Lamb in the publication of Mycenae," and therefore, I presume by Wace himself. Interpreted in terms of the "curled- leaf ornament," the crown shown in the fresco would be formed 1 B.S.A., XXV (1921-23), p. 401. 2 Fries des Megarons von Mykenae, p. 50. 3B.S.A., XXV (1921-23), p. 166.</page><page sequence="7">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 179 of a series of units joined side by side in a slightly flaring cylinder, with the flat band formed by the juxtaposed plaques at the bottom. Confirmation of this restoration is furnished by a crown depicted on the famous L. M. III sarcophagus from Hagia Triada 1 (Fig. 4, B). The indication here has been somewhat simplified by representing only a single row of curls. These are drawn in red line on a yellow ground, evidently representing gold, and spring from a flat band which encircles the head. But the head-dress here is more than a simple crown, for from the center rises a stiff lily-like object from which a long soft tassel or plume floats out and down the wearer's back.2 Presumably, then, the crown on the fragment from Mycenae should be restored with a similar central tassel. Evidently the flexible gold circlet was fastened around a close fitting cap of leather or fabric, from which the tassel sprang. The delicacy of some of the actual gold specimens of the "curled-leaf ornament" is certainly such that they could hardly have been used without some backing. The cap, of course, has left no traces in the tombs where the orna- ment has been found, and the tassel has naturally vanished com- pletely too, but the central lily-like socket of the tassel might have been made of something that would have lasted, yet so far as I know, nothing of the sort has been identified. Now if the "curled-leaf ornament" is the material remains of tasseled crowns such as are shown on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, a very special interest attaches to it; for this particular type of head- dress is otherwise well known, and has a'ready received considerable attention.3 It is unmistakably represented on fresco, ivory, gold, glass paste and on pottery, and these representations come from Crete, from mainland Greece and from Rhodes and Cyprus.4 Its 1 Mon.

With the exception of the two examples already illustrated (Fig. 4, A and B) none of the representations of the tasselled crown shows clearly that it was composed of the "curled-leaf ornament." Except on fresco the drawing is on too small a scale for more than the most cursory indication of any such detail. Nevertheless in at least seven cases' the crown is marked with slightly curved stria- tions like vertical reeding, which may very well be intended to indi- cate the "curled-leaf" units.

A series of plaques from Menidi (Kuppelgrab bei Menidi, pl.

V, 43) show female heads in profile; in illustration the top is somewhat unintelligible, but probably a crown is intended, from which a long cord hangs down the wearer's neck. While this appendage has little resemblance to a plume or tassel, it does strongly suggest the rolls of clay behind the heads of Mycenaean figurines (see below, p. 184, note 2). A gold-plated ring from a L. M. III tomb at Knossos (Archaeologia, LIX (1906), p. 416, fig. 21) shows a sphinx with out- stretched wings, wearing a head-dress with a tassel curling like a letter S behind. A mold from Sitia, Crete (Xanthoudides, Arch. Eph., 1900, pp. 25 ff., pls. 3, 4), shows on one side a very crude figure of a woman with flounced skirt and bare bosom, wearing a corrugated head-dress of some sort-from the center of which rises a three-pronged ornament-and holding flowers in her uplifted hands. On the other side is a similar figure without the central ornament to the head-dress, holding double axes instead of flowers. Probably we have here debased representa- tions of the tasselled crown; if so, there is an evident intention to show not only the "curled-leaf ornament" but also the circular inlays on the diadem. 1 This is perfectly clear in (d) (i) (k) (m) (q) (t) (u) of the examples cited in the preceding note, and probably also in the case of (n) and (s). 2 (e) (f) (h) (j) in list above.

On other examples it is plain or too crudely made to be intelligible. But in one example, from KnossosI -the best preserved and best drawn of the frescos-the crown is clearly shown to be composed of a series of delicate lily forms joined together in a circlet. The large scale and the actual beauty of this particular fragment of painted relief-especially as restored in the romantic figure of the "Priest King" 2-have made it probably the best known of the tas- selled crowns, but actually it is quite atypical. The coronet of dainty, isolated lilies is a very different thing from the continuous decorated band which would be formed by the juxtaposition of gold or gilt-paste "curled-leaf" units, the type shown in all other repre- sentations. It is in fact so delicate that it seems questionable if it could be executed as shown. Moreover, instead of the long and very flexible tassel which other examples show, the Knossian crown has apparently a plume of three broad and fairly stiff feathers, broader near the tip than at the base, like short peacock-tail feathers.3 There seem to me to be three possible explanations for the pe- culiarities of this representation. First, that the Knossos crown is an earlier form than that found on the mainland; second, that it is a distinctively Cretan type, perhaps paralleling the mainland type in development from some common ancestor; third, that it is an object really foreign to Crete, depicted by the Knossian artist, not quite literally but in terms of his own artistic vocabulary. The fresco from Knossos may in fact be slightly earlier than the gold "curled-leaf ornaments" from the mainland; Evans considers it,4 1916, p. 147, fig. 5; Deltion, II (1916), pl. I, 1), which has a marked resem- blance in technique to the mold from Sitia, shows a seated female (?) figure before which stand four genii bearing jugs. The seated figure wears a striated crown very like some of those just cited, and it is possible that a long tassel is indicated behind her back. (For the latest study of this ring, see V. Miiller, Jb. Arch. I., XLII (1927), pt. 1/2, pp. 1-29; cf. Bossert, Alt Kreta (2nd ed.), 326, h). 1 (a) in list, page 179, note 4. 2 In Candia Museum, restored by Gillieron. The restoration has since been somewhat revised by Evans (Palace of Minos, II, pl. XIV; compare Bossert, Alt Kreta, fig. 74). In B.S.A., VII (1900-01), p. 15, the section with the crown is described as "back and ear of male head wearing a crown": actually the front rather than the back is shown (cf. Palace of Minos, 11, fig. 504b). 3 The terminal ends of the feathers are not included among the fragments (Palace of Minos, II, fig. 504a), so that it is possible that they were longer and more flexible than as shown in the restoration; which is, however, quite convincing in appear- ance. Evans (ibid., II, p. 777) says that part of an eye of one of the feathers is preserved. The tassel on the gold gem, (n) in list, p. 179, note 4, is also peculiar; it is relatively short and stiff, and instead of springing from a lily-shaped plume- holder it ends in an object of that form. 4 Palace of Minos, II, p. 777, fig. 505a. In the illustration the Mycenaean gold plate is attributed to the Fourth Shaft Grave, but in the text it is correctly given as from the Third Shaft Grave.</page><page sequence="10">182 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY because of the form of the lilies, contemporary with a gold plate from the third shaft grave at Mycenae (late L. H. I.), but such dating is necessarily uncertain. The second explanation would account easily for the scarcity of the "curled-leaf ornament" in Crete, on the theory that the Cretans formed their tasselled crowns of some other ornament. But to the best of my knowledge, no other orna- ment has come to light among the goldsmith's work of Crete of proper size-c. 04 m.-to serve for the coronet. Moreover, it may be questioned whether the tasselled crown was ever truly naturalized in the island; aside from the Knossian fresco I know of but two rep- resentations of it which have been found there-the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, where the crown is clearly made of the mainland orna- ment and the costumes are of assorted mainland and Egyptian pattern-and an ivory mirror handle' from a L. M. III chamber tomb near Knossos, where the crown is a continuous band marked with a zig-zag line, and where the very incorrect drawing of the body of the sphinx who wears it, and a meaningless spiral carved on the animal's shoulder,2 strongly suggest that this handle is not Cretan work but was imported with the copper disk it held; perhaps from Cyprus, the home of mirrors. Altogether the third explanation seems to me the most probable, that the wearer of the plumed crown at Knossos is not a Cretan,3 but perhaps a tributary from the mainland or an ambassador from the east, or perhaps a votary of some foreign cult, dressed, like those on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, in an outlandish style which the painter has made free to express in terms of native ornament. The most peculiar thing about the tasselled crown is, that with the exception of the Hagia Triada sarcophagus and the two fresco frag- ments from Knossos and Mycenae-in both of which latter the wearer is a work of restoration-it is always shown upon the head of a sphinx.' On one side of the sarcophagus it is worn by a woman officiating at some religious ceremony; on each end is a chariot with two more women similarly crowned. The Knossos fragment has been associated with a male torso, but probably more than one 1 (j) in list, p. 179, note 4; probably the sealing from Zakro (see below, pp. 185, 186) and the mold from Sitia (see above, p. 179, note 4) should be included, but they come at the extreme ends of the series and in neither case is the tasselled crown beyond question. 2 There is a similar spiral on the shoulder of the ivory sphinx from Menidi, (h) in list, p. 179, note 4, and on one of the sphinxes on the Cypriot crater, (t), ibid., our Fig. 5. Compare the spiral lock on the shoulder of the little sphinx from Mycenae, (1), ibid, on the shoulder of the fresco gryphon in the Throne Room, Knossos (Bossert, Alt Kreta, 2nd ed., 55) and on the ivory gryphon from Mycenae (ibid., 231). 3 There can be little doubt that the body with which the crown has been restored belongs to a Cretan, but the correctness of the restoration cannot be established with certainty (See below, pp. 182, 183.). 4 The glass paste heads from Menidi and the mould from Sitia (see above, p. 179, note 4) should probably also be included among the exceptions, but in neither case is the head-dress altogether certain.</page><page sequence="11">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 183 figure was represented on the wall from which this came, and the traces of ear that have survived in connection with the crown are now a feminine yellowish white, while the torso is masculine brown. This difference may, of course, be due to fading, since the torso itself is much bleached in places,' but the fragments found may equally as well have belonged to more than one figure. It cannot be said with certainty, however, that the crown is an exclusively feminine head- dress-assuming all sphinxes to be female-since on the only monu- ment where the wearer's sex can be definitely told, there is no dis- tinction between male and female costumes.2 It would be useful to know if the actual remains of tasselled crowns-the "curled-leaf ornament "-had been found with male or female burials-they can not all be from the graves of sphinxes-but certain evidence seems lacking. Six of the chamber tombs at Mycenae contained specimens of the ornament, and we may hope that the promised publication of these will determine the sex of the owner in at least one case. Some indication of the significance of the tasselled crown as human head-gear may be gathered from its adoption by the sphinx, for we can safely assume that it was first used on human heads. In Egypt the sphinx was a symbolic image of the king, and its apparel simply that of royalty. If this were the case with the Aegean sphinx also, the tasselled crown should be the emblem of the Aegean kings, and the "curled-leaf ornament" be found only in royal graves. But in the legends and artistic tradition of classic Greece-where some- thing of Bronze Age belief may still be reflected-the sphinx is not a royal animal, and is consistently female.3 The origin of the Greek sphinx and its ancient significance are wholly uncertain, but it un- doubtedly came from the east, a mysterious creature with probably some definite rale in pre-Greek religion. Where crowned sphinxes confront in pairs the sacred tree (Fig. 5),' or stand with one foot upon a column 5-suggesting the lion warders of the Mycenae gate- we probably have divine attendants; theriomorphic guardians, or ministers, of aniconic gods.6 On the Hagia Triada sarcophagus the 1 Palace of Minos, II, p. 781. 2 Bossert, op. cit., p. 17. 3 The glass paste sphinx from lalysos (p. 179, note 4) and from -Menidi, (s) in list, ibid. have sharply marked breasts, as has the sphinx on Evans' gold gem from Thisbe (The Ring of Nestor, in J.H.S., 1925, fig. 31; Palace of Minos, II, fig. 478), but the authenticity of the latter does not seem to me sufficiently certain to war- rant its use as evidence.

If the "curled-leaf ornament" be found in female graves, it will be safe to infer that the tasselled crown was not a mark of royalty, but was worn by special servants of the gods, female on earth, female-feline elsewhere.2 It has been pointed out by 927 FIGURE 5. CRATER FROM ENKOMI, CYPRUS evidently regarded as an inimical earthly monster-as in later Greek legend- instead of as a divine guardian or embodied nature force, is in itself sufficient to awaken doubt as to the pre-Greek character of the gem. Nilsson, Minoan- Mycenaean Religion, p. 317, note 1, gives a list of pre-Greek examples of Sphinxes and Gryphons, "omitting instances of merely decorative value." 1 Nilsson (op. cit., pp. 369-381), after a discussion of other interpretations, concludes that the sarcophagus represents the worship of the deified dead. 2 The mould from Sitia (see above, p. 179, note 4), if it belongs to this group, helps to confirm this theory, for the figures represent goddesses--or more probably priestesses-holding two different symbols of divinity. The spreading head- dresses, crowns or poloi, characteristic of the earlier type of female figurine common in all L. H. III sites, may easily be a summary representation of the tasselled crown. I formerly suggested (cf. Harland, Peloponnesos in the Bronze Age, in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XXXIV (1923), p. 32) that the clay roll which passes over the top of the crown at the rear and hangs down the figure's back, stood for a serpent rather than for a braid of hair, and Demangel (Fouilles de Delphes, II, fasc. 5, p. 16) has apparently accepted my suggestion; but the third possibility must be considered, that it may be meant for the tassel of the crown, instead of either snake or hair. (See above, p. 179, note 4; cf. Demangel, op. cit., fig. 28, 3.) It is not improbable that poloi, kalathoi and similar head-dresses of goddesses and ministrants-notably associated with goddesses of fertility-are derived from the crowns of the terra-cotta figurines, or from their probable an- cestor the tasselled crown, or from a still earlier Asiatic ancestor (cf. Val. K. Miiller, Der Polos, pp. 55-88). The Mistress of Wild Animals is shown in relief on an archaic Boeotian vase (Wolters, Arch. Eph., 1892, pls. 8, 9) wearing a fluted and spreading crown that quite recalls the feather crown of Anaitis (see below, p. 199, Fig. 10). A possible survival of the tassel in post-Mycenaean times may be seen on a terra-cotta figurine-0.34 m. high-found on the right bank of the Danube east of Belgrade (Hoernis, Mitt. d. Anthrop, Gesell. Wien, 1891; An- throp., 1892, p. 238; Perrot, Hist. de l'Art, VII, fig. 70). In general form and pose this figurine is exactly comparable to the Mycenaean ones, on the head there appears to be a flat cap from which an unmistakable tassel, long and elaborate, hangs down the back. Unfortunately the uncertainty of date and lack of inter- mediate examples make the relationship to the Mycenaean figurines quite un- certain. Dr. Elderkin has called my attention to a curious head-ornament shown on certain Cyrenaic-Laconian cylices, which may also be a descendant or younger relations of the tasselled crown (Arch. Zeit., XXXIX (1881), pl. XIII, 2, 3, 6). This consists of a pair of incurling spirals with a more or less rudimentary pal- mette upstanding between them. It is shown twice on the heads of horsemen -possibly deified heroes--once on the head of a small winged female genius</page><page sequence="13">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 185 Tsountas 1 that the anthropomorphic termination of the "curled-leaf ornament" shown in Figure 3 probably represents the great mother goddess, and the fact that in the same room four fragmentary figur- ines of glass were found, showing a goddess of the same type,2 indi- cates that the whole equipment was of a sacred character.3 The fresco crown from Knossos may then have been worn, not by a "Priest-King" as in the restoration, but by a priestess, perhaps a foreigner; and the scene to which it belonged may have been a religious ceremony like that on the sarcophagus, rather than a lay procession. The origin of the tasselled crown is as problematical as is its signifi- cance. The "curled-leaf ornament" carries it back to L. H. II; it seems to have no ancestry in Greece before that period. Its appear- ance is approximately contemporary with that of the tholos tombs; perhaps its introduction is due to a race or tribe that supplanted the builders of the shaft graves as rulers of Mycenae.4 But the earli- est representation in Crete may be very slightly earlier,5 and a con- temporary forerunner of the crowned sphinx may be seen in a small stamped gold ornament 6 from the third grave, in the form of a winged sphinx, "crowned" says Schliemann,7 "with a Phrygian cap from which a long crest seems to stretch out." The cap is a cone, drawn as an equilateral triangle; there is no indication of any coro- net, but the tassel is unmistakable, it seems, in fact, double. The third shaft grave dates from the latter part of L. H. I.8 Further- more, among the clay sealings found at Zakro in eastern Crete is accompanying such a horseman, and once on the head of a sphinx. Exactly the same ornament is shown on the head of a sphinx on a crater of the same style found in a tomb at Sardis (Chase, A.J.A., XXV (1921) pl. IV,) while the pal- mette without the scrolls appears above the head of a small winged genius on a cylix from Naukratis, (Petrie, Naukratis, I, pl. VIII). It is to be noted that while the elements-incurling volutes with central spray-are paralleled by the incurling volutes of the coronet and the central tassel springing from an upright tassel- holder, there is perhaps an even closer parallel in the doubled incurling volutes and central fountain of vegetation upon the head of the lady on the Mycenaean pin (See below, Fig. 7, b). Conceivably all are related to a talismanic emblem found commonly in Cyprus, Syria and Egypt from the eighteenth dynasty onward. Portions of long spirals, stretching to the rear of the head, are shown above two Sphinxes on a Cyrenaic vase (Arch. Zeit., XXXIX (1881), pl. XI, 3) in the British Museum, and on a cylix in the Ashmolean (Rev. Arch., IX (1907), pl. III); an "orientalizing" fragment from Naukratis shows a complete spiral (J.H.S., VIII (1887), pl. LXXIX). Though the crown is at best a skull cap, the spiral strongly suggests the tassel. Spiral-tassel and polos-crown together are worn by Sphinxes on terra-cotta plaques from Praesos (B.S.A., XI (1904-05), p. 255, fig. 18), now in the Metropolitan Museum. Other sphinxes on a pithos from Prinias (A.J.A., V (1901), pl. XIII, 11) wear long corrugated wigs with a separate lock in a careful spiral issuing from the top, but no polos. The tassel seems preserved by South Aegean sphinxes, the polos by Ionic. 1 Arch. Eph., 1887, p. 169. 2 Ibid., pl. XIII (24). Wace, B.S.A., XXYV (1921-23), p. 402. 4 Ibid., pp. 120-121.

The head is turned sharply to the right, and wears a diadem from which rise three or four curls, often misdrawn in illustration as loops 2 but actually of spiral form. Behind the head float out what look like two nodular fillets. These may be meant for a double tassel and the curls for the ornamental coronet of a tasselled crown, or both may stand for hair, or-in view of the freakish forms shown on these sealings-both may be meaningless space fillers. The sealings came from the "upper story" of a house burned in the destruction of the city, toward the end of L. M. I.* Evans 4 dates them, on a basis of the artist's psychology rather than on stylistic grounds, at the transition from the Middle to the Late Minoan period. But the only parallel to the scalloped wings of butterfly type, found not only on the sphinx but on a variety of the Zakro sealings, and on an undated bronze axe from Phaestos 5 are the butterflies and other scalloped forms stamped on gold disks from the third shaft grave at Mycenae.6 No seal stones of quite the style of the Zakro impressions have been found in Crete; it is therefore possible that these clay labels were attached to imported objects;7 at any rate the fantastic combinations of form shown seem foreign to the naturalism of Cretan art. Altogether I think it quite possible that we have here the earliest representation of the tasselled crown in Crete or Greece and perhaps the earliest representation of the sphinx in Crete; but I also think the evidence points to both being still exotic there in the latter days of L. M. I.8 The contemporary Mycenaean sphinx, if it be of local manufacture, may be the work of an artist copying a foreign object, which he did not clearly under- stand so far as the crown was concerned, because the crown itself had not at that time appeared in Greece.9 1 J.H.S., XXII (1902), pl.

That is to say, a mass of debris, 1 ft. 6 in. thick, separated them from the carbonized matter and painted plaster which lay on the floor below. Identical sealings have been found at the port of Knossos, near Candia, on a site which yielded objects of M. M. III, L. M. I. and L. M. III (Palace of Minos, II, pp. 254-255).

M. Ib) (see above, p. 183, notes3, 6). 9 This tasselled cap may possibly be a primitive ritual head-dress or possibly</page><page sequence="15">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 187 Now a head-dress which was known to Mycenaeans as proper to imported sphinxes, before they adopted it for their own heads, must have been worn still earlier by human beings in the land from which the sphinxes came. That this was an eastern land seems certain; that the sphinx did not come by way of Crete to Greece seems highly probable since it appears at the same period in both countries and since the only representations which have been found in the island, so far as I know '-beside the Zakro sealing-are the ivory mirror handle from Knossos mentioned above,2 and an uncrowned wingless sphinx of inlaid steatite found at Hagia Triada,3 both of which are of L. M. III date, and one of which is probably, the other certainly, imported work. It may be significant that aside from the Zakro and the shaft grave example, I have found no representation of a crowned sphinx anywhere which is surely earlier than L. H. III, that is, all postdate the introduction of the actual tasselled crown into Greece. Of these examples more than half are carved on ivory; and since ivory is necessarily imported from the east,4 it is probable that many are the work of eastern artists. Elementary principles of commerce would indicate an eastern trade in finished objects rather than in raw materials.5 One of these ivories was found at Enkomi in Cyprus;6 the same site has yielded several pieces of gold 7 stamped with a square die showing a small winged and crowned sphinx-strikingly like one found in a chamber tomb at Mycenae 8-and two craters helmet (see below, p. 198, and p. 200, note 1) to which the coronet was added; the final tasselled crown being thus a combination of two distinct head-dresses, like the combination crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. 1 An ivory plume, dating from the end of M. M. III (Pal. of Min., fig. 505b), may possibly have belonged to a sphinx, as Evans suggests (op. cit., p. 778). But since the only other evidence for a sphinx is some fragments of wings, in the collection of ivory objects where the plume was found, the restoration is highly conjectural. 2 P. 182; (j) in list, p. 179, note 4. 3Della Seta, La Sfinge d. Hagia Triada, in Rendiconti Acad. Lincei, XVI (1907), pp. 699-715, fig. 4; cf. Bossert, Alt Kreta, 159. 4 Wainwright (Liverpool Annals, VI (1913-14), p. 53) asserts that Egyptian records and representations of Syrian tribute indicate that elephants must have been found in the forests of the Lebanon, Amanus and Taurus Mountains as late as the fifteenth century B.C. (cf. Rowe, Mu. Journ. (Univ. of Pennsylvania) 1928, June, p. 165.) The technique of ivory carving requires special skill and practice; it is hardly credible that Spata or Athens in L. H. III were wealthy enough to support ivory carvers of their own. Tiryns, Orchomenos, Thebes or Kakovatos might con- ceivably have done so, though the scarcity of ivory in the excavations at those sites indicates otherwise; Mycenae, as the richest city of Greece, would be the most probable headquarters for such a craft. Only two of the ivory sphinxes were found at Mycenae. This may be pure coincidence, but it is quite as possible that none was carved in Greece. 6 (k) in list, p. 179, note 4.

The die appears to be late L. H. III and one of the craters (Fig. 5) seems not a great deal later.2 It is possible that this vase is not of local manufacture, but there can hardly be any doubt about the second crater, and the gold plates were surely stamped in Cyprus, though the die may conceivably have been imported. The ivory may be local or imported work; two other ivories 3 from the same site show such close resemblance to ivories from Spata that it is difficult to imagine different sources, yet it is equally difficult to imagine the importation of ivory from Greece to Cyprus. The sphinx, then, was apparently common in Cyprus not long after it was domesticated in Greece and Crete; we lack evidence to say whether it was known there earlier or not, and therefore cannot say whether it is more probable that sphinx and crown were introduced to Greece from Cyprus, or that they came to both lands from some third country of the east. The earlier examples of the ornament which formed the coronet strongly suggest some natural form conventionalized in gold, whence the descriptive name, "the curled-leaf ornament." But it seems unlikely that the gold work was actually an imitation of foliage, for a crown of natural leaves would normally have the elements more horizontally arranged, as in a wreath. I know of no primitive crowns anywhere-the strawberry leaves of the British nobility are not truly primitive-made of natural leaves set upright in a band, though doubtless somewhere such do exist. Modillions, to which the ornaments have also been compared, seem even less probable elements for a crown. But representations of the completed crown have given rise to another suggestion as to its composition. Valen- tine Milller,4 in speaking of that on the ivory sphinx from Argos, says, "es lose auf einen Ring aufgesteckte Federn zu sein scheinen, ist es ein fester . . . ornamentierter Reif"; Murray 5 says of the Enkomi 1 (t), (u) in list, p. 179, note 4. 2 Nilsson (Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, p. 35) places the bulk of the Cypriot finds in L. M. III. Cf. Poulsen, Zur Zeitbestimmung der Enkomifunde, in Jb. Arch. I., XXVI (1911), pp. 215 ff. It is interesting to note that on the crater under consideration the front legs of one of the sphinxes are of human form, as on archaic centaurs. A carved ivory plaque from Menidi (Kuppelgrab bei Menidi, pl. VIII, 10), probably the side of a draughts box, shows four winged sphinxes, all of whose legs, rear as well as front, appear to be of human form. Unfortunately the upper part of the plaque, with any head-dresses the sphinxes may have worn, has en- tirely rotted away. 3Murray, Excavations in Cyprus, pl. II, 872b, lion killing bull; ibid., pl. II, 1340, head with boar's tusk helmet. Nilsson (op. cit., p. 35, note 1) says that the latter "testifies direct influence from the Greek mainland." An ivory comb from Troy (D6rpfeld, Troja und Ilion, I, p. 399, fig. 389) shows exactly the same form (the solid portion in two registers, with a rosette in the center of the upper one) as the comb from Spata, (d) in list, p. 179, note 4. 4 Polos, p. 17. 5 Excavations in Cyprus, p. 9.</page><page sequence="17">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN FLUMES 189 sphinx, "she wears a low crown, apparently consisting of short feathers, set vertically"; and Reinach I says of the crown on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, "La couronne elle-mrnme est form'ne d'une srie de petits points d'interrogation dores dont le crochet se recourbe vers l'interieur.

And indeed, the only representations of head-dresses to be found in the Aegean which might serve as prototypes of the "curled-leaf " coronet, seem clear examples of feather crowns. The first is a small terra-cotta head 2 from Piskokephalo, in eastern Crete (Fig. 6). Valentine Miiller first dated this in M. M. I, but K. Miller 3 con- siders it not earlier than L. M.

Above this rises an irregular mass of ribbed, incurving forms, for what would be some 0.10 m. more. Miller considers this upper structure to be hair, drawn up under the broad band and piled high in an elaborate coiffure. To me, neither the general form nor the treatment of detail suggest hair, but on the contrary the head-dress seems clearly composed of a ring of inward curling plumes-like ostrich feathers-held upright by a broad band of metal or leather or some woven substance.' The differences between this head-dress and a crown composed of early "curled-leaf ornaments," aside from size, are merely such as would naturally result from the conventionalization of a series of soft irregular objects into formal repeating elements of gold. The relative dates are suitable for such a genesis, but the head was found in Crete, where gold "curled-leaf ornaments" are unknown. Of course the terra- cotta may not depict a Cretan head-dress; it may be either an im- ported object, or perhaps more probably, since the work looks thoroughly Cretan, may represent a foreign type. Certainly no other head-dress resembling this has been found on the island, unless perhaps the crests shown on the heads on the famous Phaestos disk (M. M. III)2 are intended for feather crowns. But the makers of the Phaestos disk were probably not Cretans and certainly not main- land Greeks,3 and if the Piskokephalo head is that of an immigrant of L. M. I, he would probably not be from Greece either. The second possible representation of a prototype of the "curled- leaf ornament" is on a repouss6 gold pendant from Aegina (Fig. 7, A).' A slender male figure clad in a decorated kilt, with high boots or ankle bands, stands on a base adorned with conventional lotus flowers. He grasps in either hand the neck of a well wrought water- fowl. From each side, at the level of the kilt, emerge two large corru- gated cylindrical objects which curve upward outside the fowl, and end in indefinite lance-like heads. One cannot say with certainty that these four objects are meant for serpents, still less for the stems of water plants, but there is no third obvious conjecture. The figure is shown in profile below the waist, while the torso is turned, in Egyp- tian fashion, to the front. But the head also is shown in full face, 1 The braided band at the base of the early "curled-leaf ornament" (Fig. 1, a) may indicate a braided prototype. 2 Pernier, II disco di Phaestos, in Ausonia, III (1908-9), pp. 255-302; "not later than the beginning of the sixteenth century" (Evans, Palace of Minos, I. p. 667). 3From the southwest coast of Asia Minor, according to Evans, loc. cit. 4 Marshall, Catalogue of Jewelry in British Museum, pl.

On the arms are bracelets and arm bands, huge circular ear-rings reach to the shoulders and on the head is a crown composed of a corrugated band-about 0.03 m. wide, in life size-from which rise four broad straight sided loops that would be in life size about 0.14 m. high. No one seems to question that a crown of upright feathers is intended here. Above this is a small horizontal tube for the cord from which the pendant hung; because of its striations this suggests, in reproduction, an upper row of feathers, but such appearance is purely accidental.

Evans says of it "although the original elements are all Egyptian and the subject itself in all proba- bility borrowed from a very simple scene of Nile life, the whole has as it were been recast in a more oriental mould. The relation which the present scheme bears to its naturalistic Egyptian prototype recalls the creations of somewhat late Phoenician and Assyrian art." He further notes that at the base of the lotus flowers is a circular boss which is not to be found in Egyptian art but "is a characteristic accompanyment of the same ornament on the paintings of the North West Palace at Nineveh, and on ivories of the same provenience," and concludes by dating the pendant in the ninth or eighth centuries, say 800 B.C.' D chelette 2 believes the personage to be a north- ern sun god, rather than an Egyptian huntsman in his boat. 1 So also Beloch (Griech. Gesch. 2nd ed.

Reinach I agrees that a god is represented, and points out that the duck seizing gesture is characteristic of certain Ionian divinities,' but maintains that the elements of the composition are almost purely Egyptian save for the gesture, the front face, the ear-rings and the feather crown.3 He offers no opinion as to date. It cannot be denied that a variety of artistic motifs, Egyptian and Asiatic, are here combined, and the conclusion seems obvious that the pendant was made not in Egypt, but yet where Egyptian influence was stronger than in Crete or Greece; that is, in Asia Minor, Cyprus, Syria, Palestine or North Africa. Because of its geographic position Phoenicia must inevitably have produced a somewhat hybrid art at all periods, so that while the variety of influences which Phoenician art shows in the ninth-eighth centuries is notorious, this is really a characteristic of situation rather than of date. It is true that the Aegina pendant and late Phoenician art show much the same mixture of elements, but the likeness of the two goes no further than that; the artistic spirit is wholly different. In late Phoenician work the various elements are associated rather than fused, they retain enough of their original nationality to form a hyphenated art; in the Aegina pendant there is a complete reworking into a new artistic style whose ancestry is not evident-witness the discussion-with- out considerable analysis. Stylistically the Aegina pendant seems to me most closely related to a gold pin 4 from the third shaft grave at Mycenae (Fig. 7, B), which represents a woman standing with outstretched arms beneath a fountain of fantastic vegetation that falls about her, on either side, informal flowering branches. The scale of the two ornaments is much the same; so is the technique. Both consist of a repousse front plate joined to a flat rear plate by folding the edges of one over the other. In both the vegetation is highly conventionalized and the composition, as a whole, symmetrical and decorative, yet in both the human figure is treated with a straight-forward vigor in pose and a freedom in drawing that is foreign to Egyptian or Asiatic art. The modelling of the male head and the female torso, both turned to the front in quite un-Egyptian manner, is not only unconventional but surprisingly realistic for work on so small a scale.

These suggest Cretan or later Cyp- riot ornament, but also seem related to that of the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt. Long branches emerge from these volutes, three on a side, with small formal leaves, like beads along the stems, and end in feathery panicles and large smooth disks. Similar pendant branches bordered with little leaves and ending in delicate flower sprays are shown in greater naturalism on MI. M. III frescos from Hagia Triada and Knossos.' These also are closely related to the naturalistic Egyptian art of the eighteenth dynasty. Whatever the genealogy of the Mycenaean form, the result is certainly neither Cretan nor Egyptian in style. The lady wears a: flounced skirt and short-sleeved open bodice like those of the M. M. III faience figurines from Knossos. Late Minoan-Late Helladic frescos show the same costume, and one from the tomb of Nehamon, at Thebes," shows something very like it, worn by the wife of a Syrian prince. The last element in the composition of the Mycenaean pin is a curious festoon made of two cross-barred strands, thicker in the center than at the ends, which hangs in a long curve between the outstretched hands of the lady. The resemblance to the "serpents" of the Aegina pendant is marked; the chief differences being that in the latter ornament the smooth ends are larger and somewhat more like heads, and the festoons-which pass behind instead of in front of the figure-form a broken instead of a continuous curve. In neither case does the figure actually hold the ends. Nilsson, in his Minoan-Mycenaean Religion,3 cites a series of talis- manic seals and sealings from Crete and Greece-all of Late Minoan or Late Helladic date-on which appear certain curious objects, in form like flattened curvilinear "W "s with bulbous ends. These never occur singly, but in reduplications of two or three, set one close inside the other. In four cases 4 the resultant object is shown above a goddess, who stands between symmetrical animals. The central 1 Mon. Ant., XIII, pl. 11; Bossert, Alt Kreta, fig. 70.

Possibly a lentoid from central Crete in Evans' collection (J.H.S., XXXV (1925), p. 24, fig. 28) shows the mysterious</page><page sequence="22">194 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY curve of the "W" is supported by her head, the outer parts by her raised and outstretched hands. On one-a sealing from Zakrol- a bucranium between birds has replaced the goddess between lions or gryphons, and the object above has separated into what appear to be two bows of the Greek pattern; and on another, a gold ring from the recently excavated tholos tomb near Mideia,2 two of these objects, each composed of three curved units firmly bound together, serve as partially enclosing supports for grotesque bow-legged quad- rupeds, seen in front face. To this series I would add a sardonyx lentoid from Ialysos, Rhodes.3 Nilsson believes that in all his instances the mysterious objects are essentially the same as the "serpents" of the Aegina pendant, and this I think, will meet with ready agree- ment. His conclusion,4 "at all events the object (in the Aegina pendant) is here a motif transmitted from an older age and perhaps not wholly understood," is certainly correct. He suggests, on the basis of the seal impression from Zakro, where, he says, bows are rec- ognizable beyond doubt, that in all cases we may have hieratic repre- sentations of bows as cult emblems of a hunting deity, a Mistress or Master of Animals. It seems to me, however, in view of the fantastic metamorphoses of other objects on the Zakro sealings,5 that the instance in question is more likely to be a whimsical interpretation of a conventional subject, than the prototype of an artistic conven- tion. The central figure with outstretched arms and flanking ani- mals of the normal icon may well have been transformed here into the long bovine head with down-curved horns which terminate in " W " at the level of the shoulders of a female figure standing between winged gryphons, though in this case there is an extra downward curve in the center of the W "W" and the ends are much less upcurved than usual. 1 Now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Nilsson, op. cit., fig. 93 and pl.

O4 p. cit., p. 317. 5 See above, p. 186, notes 1 and 3. Evans (Palace of Minos, I, p. 71, 72) de- scribes these Zakro sealings as "a succession of fantastic and monstrous forms, one derived from another by a constant differentiation of details . . . we have not here a gradual evolution of forms of a more or less unconscious nature, accomplished in the course of a long period of years. . . Rather we have to do with the rapid and intentional variation of a limited number of types-a variation born of the wish to baffle forgers of seals." Other sealings from Zakro (J.H.S., XXII (1902), pls. VIII, IX) show other transformations of bucrania in connection with more or less transformed " W "s. On No. 88 two "W "s above a rudimentary head are sur- mounted by a circle with an inscribed maltese cross; on No. 81 there are two "W"s below the muzzle; on Nos. 63, 64, and 65 the head resembles that of a fox, and a single " W" seems to be held in the mouth; on No. 66 the fox-like head is very rudimentary, it is surmounted by two "W "s, while the ends of a third, emerging from either side of the muzzle, terminate in little animal heads; on No. 83 the head is bovine again, but the horns end in little heads and the "W," emerging from the mouth, has shrunk to the dimensions of a pair of tusks, while a curious three- looped ribbon above the bucranium has probably been evolved from something like the "W"s and disk of No. 88.</page><page sequence="23">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 195 water-fowl; and similarly the doubled object above the deity may have been translated into two bows above the bucranium. The true genealogy of the mystic "W" seems to me indicated by an agate seal which Nilsson illustrates,' in the museum of Cassel (Fig. 8). Though the indication is crude and careless, we have here unquestionably represented the re- duplicated "W" above the head of the god- dess, and with this a long loop hanging from the unachieved termination of her out- stretched arms to a point below her waist in front, with a parallel loop passing behind her hips. In this instance, therefore, we find combined the "W "-like, double-headed "snakes" above the heads of the figures on the Kalkani and Psychro gems, the "gar- land" of the shaft-grave pin (Fig. 7, B), and the "branches" or "snakes" of the Aegina pendant (Fig. 7, A). Of course the most complex type is not necessarily the earliest, but Valentine Miuller 2 has undertaken to show that in the case of the pin the double garland is an iconographic survival of the double sagging lines shown on seal cylinders 3 between the hands of the Hittite FIGURE 8.

HITTITE SEAL CYLINDERS WITH GODDESS UNVEILING "Magna Mater," which represent the border of the goddess' cloak held out behind her as she unveils herself (Fig. 9). In the Cassel gem the transition is very clear.

In the Cassel gem the cloak has demate- rialized, leaving only doubled boundary lines which are now lifted until the upper ones are higher than the head, while of the lower pair, one hangs before and one behind the goddess. When a stereotyped religious subject comes to be copied as uncomprehendingly as this, the further degeneration of its elements is inevitable and rapid. Eventually they disappear or become interpreted as other objects with which originally they had no affiliations whatsoever: serpents and garlands and bows thus may have a common origin quite different from any one of them. In the Cassel gem, the nude torso, with the hanging loop just reaching to the skirt somewhat below the waist, suggests that a trace of the original significance of the lines may still survive here, but with the lady on the Mycenaean pin, it has evidently been wholly lost, leaving a ritual decoration which actually represents nothing. The same is true, no doubt, of the Minoan-Mycenaean gems; the engraver having no care to under- stand or interpret the curves above the goddess' head, but simply knowing them as a mysterious element in the regalia of the Mistress of Wild Animals. Hence there would be no difficulty in applying them also to a Master of Animals, though the "young man hunting in the Egyptian marshes" seems far removed from the cosmic exhibitionism of the Great Mother. If the origin of these mystic forms is Hittite, it is evident that the unintelligent deformation of them must be at the hands of some other people who have come in contact with Hittite religious images. Unfortunately neither is the provenance of the Cassel gem known,' nor can it be surely dated. The gem from Psychro, next in type development-if the wings of the attendant gryphons be dictated by the line of the lower loop from the goddess' hands-is attributed to L. M. I. On the Kalkani gems a double ax stands between the horns of the " W " upon the goddess' head, and here it is quite possi- ble, as Nilsson suggests,2 that there has been a "formal modification of the object under the influence of the horns of consecration." A reinterpretation of this sort implies a further remove from the origi- nal inspiration; this is quite consistent with the fact that the gems were found in L. H. III graves, and are probably not of much earlier date.3 The ring from Mideia marks one step further still; the mystic " W " is now quite independent of the goddess. It has assumed the 1 I have not seen the original gem, but in the line drawing here reproduced, there seems to me a strong suggestion that the style is normal neither to Crete nor to Mycenae. Furtwiingler gives as provenance merely "aus Griechenland." 2 Op. cit., p. 315. 3 Wace (J.H.S., XLI (1921), p. 264) dates them with the Vaphio tomb.</page><page sequence="25">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 197 guise of a short triple braid, with the knobbed ends of the three com- ponent cords curling up to right and left. Its date is unquestionably L. H. III. On a parallel line of transformation the pin from My- cenae, of the end of L. H. I, seems about as close to the original scheme as the Psychro gem, and the iconographic development shown in the Aegina pendant is at approximately the same stage. The latter can therefore hardly be "late Phoenician." Its close affiliations, religious and aesthetic, with the Mycenaean pin, indicate that both are of similar date (L. H. I or II) and that they belong to a common culture or to very closely related ones, which had recently been affected by Hittite religious symbolism. The pin may have been actually made in Mycenae and the pendant somewhere in the east,' yet considering one with the other we may safely infer that in the sixteenth or fifteenth century B.C. the lords of Argolis as well as of Aegina were in relations, peaceful or otherwise, with easterners whose gods wore feather crowns.2 Egyptian frescos 3 of the early part of L. H. I, depict a certain people of the eastern Mediterranean, the men of Keftiu, dressed in the boots and pointed kilt of patterned stuff seen on the Aegina 4 pendant. By 1450 apparently some wore the Syrian filet round the hair, and one is shown with a horned head-dress, but none wear feather crowns. Whether these Keftiuans were true island Cretans, or Cretan colonists of near-by coasts,5 or indeed, not Cretans at all, 1 Many of the stamped gold ornaments from the shaft graves show eastern influence. The gryphon in "flying gallop" (Schliemann, Mlycenae, p. 182, no. 272) might be a Cretan subject, but is not native to Greece; the sleeping lion (ibid., p. 178, no. 263) might also conceivably be Cretan, though it is so naturalistic that it is hard to believe the artist was not familiar with lions, and the lion is not proper to Crete; the two spotted cats (ibid., p. 180, no. 266) in the fronds of a palm tree is distinctly an eastern subject-the fresco of the hunting cat from Hagia Triada being surely of Egyptian inspiration; and the naked goddess with hovering doves (ibid., p. 180, nos. 267, 268) is a subject altogether foreign to either Greece or Crete. The die, at least, for this last must have been cut by an eastern artist. 2 The grotesque Egyptian god Bes wears a feather crown like that of the Aegine- tan youth, and like him is sometimes shown strangling wild fowl-as well as con- quering lions. Bes seems to reach Egypt from Syria and was later carried far afield by the Phoenicians. It is possible that both the Aeginetan and the Egyp- tian gods spring from a line of development reaching from Gilgamesh and Tammuz to Melkart and Adonis. 3 From the tomb of Senmut, before 1500 B.c.-those here represented are cer- tainly Minoans, but as their habitat is not stated they may not be Keftiuans at all.

Max Muiller (Asien und Europa, pp. 337 ff.) and Wainwright (op. cit.) place Keftiu in eastern Cilicia, which determination seems to me probably correct;</page><page sequence="26">198 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY is still a debated question; in any case, neither they nor any other friends or enemies of Egypt depicted in the eighteenth dynasty records, give any clue to the origin of the feather crown. But at the beginning of the twelfth century we do find such head-dresses shown repeatedly on reliefs at Medinet Habu which illustrate the triumph of Rameses III over a confederation of tribes from the coast lands of Syria and Palestine and parts nearby. Four of these peoples, the Zeker, Weshesh, Teresh and Perset (Pulusati) wear feather crowns not unlike that on the Aegina pendant, except that the feathers curve outward instead of standing vertically (Fig. 11, a). The kilt they wear is also almost identical with that of the duck-throttler. An- other of the allied tribes, the Sherden, are supposed by some 1 to be the ancestors of the Sardinians. A. J. Reinach,2 following Tara- melli,3 points out that in Punic and Roman times the patron deity of Sardinia-" Sardus pater "-and perhaps his priests, wore circlets of feathers. An archaic bronze head,4 which he illustrates, shows that the feather crown probably had greater antiquity in Sardinia than any written records of the island. At the same time Reinach points out that the Sherden on the Egyptian reliefs, like the majority of Sardinian bronze warriors, wear helmets decorated with two horns rather than with feather crowns,5 and queries whether the latter may not have been essentially a religious head-dress among the Sardin- ians, perhaps borrowed for this purpose by the Sherden from one of their allies. Quite recently in the excavations of the University of Pennsyl- vania Museum, at Beisan in Palestine-the biblical Beth-Shan- Rowe has brought to light an earthen-ware cylinder," from one side of which projects a crudely modelled head unmistakably crowned with a circlet of feathers 7 (Fig. 10). This object was found in the Evans (op. cit., II, pp. 654-658) admits that the Keftiuans may be from the Asiatic mainland, but if so believes them colonists from Crete; Val. Miiller (Jb. Arch.

Critique, IX (1880), p. 109), denied by Hall (Oldest Civilization of Greece, p. 171), but restated in Camb. Anc.

TERRACOTTA HEAD FROM BEISAN, PALESTINE At any rate it seems evident that at the beginning of the fourteenth century the feather crown was a sacred head-dress of some tribe or people of Palestine, two centuries before the Philistines-the feather crowned Periset of Rameses III-became the masters of Beth-Shan. Mercenary troops, who, perhaps from the beginning of the fifteenth century, garrisoned the place for the Egyptians,3 may be responsible 1 Rowe, Mus. Jour.

Long after the confederation against Rameses, Herodotus2 notes that the Lycians in the army of Xerxes wore feather crowns. These Lycians were probably descendants of certain Luku who are recorded as being associated with Sherden and other tribes in an attack on Egypt from Libya about 1220 B.C.,3 and who are mentioned in one of the Amarna letters,4 two centuries earlier, as raiding Egypt and forcibly settling in A lashia.5 Did these earlier Lycians wear feather crowns also? The probabilities favor it, for such tribal head-dresses usually have great antiquity. Did their sea raids reach Crete and the west shores of the Aegean as well as Egypt and Libya? It is altogether possible.6 But whether introduced by Luku or not, it is certain that the feather crown was worn in Cyprus or vicinity, at least four or five hundred years before Herodotus. The evidence is a little figure carved on an ivory draught-box found at Enkomi.7 He is bearded (Fig. 11, b) and dressed in a pointed kilt such as the 1 Cf. the Egyptian texts, collected in German translation, in Bossert, Alt Kreta, pp. 51-52. In the south temple of Beisan (Rowe, op. cit., 1928, June, p. 149-151, and ill. p. 150) there was found in the level of Thothmes III (1501-1447) a stele with an image of Mekal or Mekar, "the God of Beth-Shan," wearing a conical helmet; from the peak of this hangs a very long tassel, and two horns are attached at the bottom in front, apparently by a filet, the end of which hangs down the god's back. The shape of the helmet and the tassel suggest the helmets brought to Egypt by the men of Kadesh in the fifteenth century (Wainwright, op. cit., p. 76 and pl. XVI, 31); the horns recall those of the Sherden, though the shape of the helmet is quite different from that worn by them in the twelfth century. It may be that Mekal wears an early type of Sherden helmet, but it should be also noted that he is shown with a pointed beard, of the Syrian rather than Egyptian type. while the Sherden of the twelfth century are clean-shaven. The total combination of horned and tasselled helmet and pointed beard is most closely paralleled so far as I know,-the god Reshep shown on a stele in Berlin (Max Miiller, Egypt. Myth., p. 155) attired like the god of Beth-Shan is certainly identifiable with Mekal, as Rowe (op. cit. 1928, June, pp. 154, 155) suggests,-on the warrior vase from Mycenae (see below, p. 202, and Fig. 11, c), but there is as yet hardly sufficient evidence to establish more than a possibility of connection between the two. 2 VII, 92. 3 Inscription at Karnak (Mariette, pls. 52-54; Bossert, Alt Kreta, p. 54, I). 4 Alte Orient, Jahrg.

As for the possibility of such eastern vikings reaching Greece, I would cite the evidence of the "Warrior Vase" 1 found by Schlie- mann at Mycenae. This famous crater is undated save by its style. The nearest parallel is a sherd from Mycenae 2 which shows a frag- mentary man standing behind a fragmentary horse. The horse is decorated on shoulder and off hind leg with parallel hatchings, exactly like those which adorn water-fowl on a deep bowl 3 and a stirrup vase 4 found in the "Granary" at Mycenae. These latter two pots were unquestionably in use when the bronze-age city was destroyed,5 and this in turn may be dated at the time of the " Dorian invasion," that is, about 1100 B.c. The costumes shown on the a b c e f FIGURE 11. WARRIOR HEADS, a, MEDINET HABU, EGYPT; b, ENKOMI, CYPRUS; c-f, MYCENAE "Warrior Vase" then, should be those of the twelfth century B.C. Two rows of warriors are depicted, one file marching with shield at side and spear on shoulder, the other in more warlike attitude, with shield held protectingly in front, and spear raised for casting. Both troups wear greaves and corselets with short fringed kilts; the shields of both are approximately round. Both wear pointed beards with the upper lip shaven (Fig. 11, c and d)-as does the groom on the contemporary vase fragment-in the fashion of the inlaid heads on the famous silver cup 6 found by Tsountas in chamber tomb No. 24 at Mycenae. This marks a change from shaft-grave styles, for the 1 Furtwiingler-Loeschke, Myk. Vasen, 42-43. 2 National Mus. Athens, 4691; Rodenwaldt, Fries d.

The shaven upper lip with full beard is worn by the ax-man on the Enkomi ivory (see above, p. 200 and Fig. 11, b) and is characteristic of Cyprus throughout the archaic period. Beards as well as feather crowns were worn by one of the chiefs of the allied tribes overcome by Rameses III on the coast of Palestine,--the Zeker, who at the beginning of the eleventh century B.C. were lords of Dor (Bossert, op. cit., p. 52, II); and Wainwright (op. cit., p. 68) points out that beards were occasionally worn by the men of Keftiu.</page><page sequence="30">202 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY gold masks of that period,' beside beardless faces, show moustache as well as beard. The only important difference between the two troups is the head-gear. The first file (Fig. 11, c) wear helmets shaped something like a "salade" with protecting visor before the forehead, and a similar projecting neckpiece at the back. Two slender horns curve forward and upward, apparently from above the forehead, and on the very top stands a crest, like an inverted cone, from which a long flexible tassel hangs to the rear. The man- ner in which the front and rear edges of the helmet stand out from the head bespeaks some stiff material, either metal or heavy leather.2 The head-gear of the second troup (Fig. 11, d) starts with a straight line at the bottom, running from the forehead to the back of the head above the spiral ear. Evidently this indicates a hoop or band fitting closely around the head. From this line the profile swings outward and upward in front, and outward at the back, in short concave lines which are joined across the top of the whole by a nearly semi-circular arc. All along this top line a row of short radial marks stand up like bristles. The surface of the head-dress is covered with small light dots; since an exactly similar decoration appears on the helmets of the first troup and on the kilts of both, these dots are probably simply a vase painter's ornament with no representational significance. It is perfectly evident that the second head-dress is not a metal helmet or one of any stiff material; the spreading profile from head band to periphery, like that of a knitted tam-o-shanter, indicates softness. The radial lines along the top have given rise to the suggestion that the artist intended to represent a cap of hairy skin,3 but the spreading form is inappro- priate to such an interpretation. On the other hand the profile is strikingly like that of the feather crowns of the Cypriot axeman and the captive raiders on the Medinet Habu reliefs. By the bristling edge, the painter-of somewhat limited technique-expresses quite logically the fact that the head-dress does not finish in a smooth, ' Schliemann, Mycenae, (bearded, p. 289, No. 474; beardless or with moustache only, p. 220, No. 331; p. 221, No. 332; p. 333, No. 473). 2The description of the young man's helmet in the Iliad (X, 257-259), I OL KUvvi77 KE~aX175LV Efl0KEfITavp'ti7v, &amp;caX6v TE KCKl aXXOoOV, 21 TE Ka-raLTU KKX7caL, pEEraT 6~ K'p- qOaXEp&amp; P aL j,v." suggests that the normal helmet of full- fledged warriors was of bull's hide with X6oos and CacXos. Some Homeric helmets apparently had two oaXo' (&amp;g4eCLaXos, II., V, 743; XI, 41); some had four (rErpadakos, II., XII, 384; XXII, 315). The CaXos seems peculiar to Homeric helmets, since the word does not occur in later Greek. If it be translated "horn," relating it to CaXX6s, the Warrior Vase would give a perfect picture of the helmet with a~uilaXko and X6bos.

Altogether I feel no hesitancy in seeing on the "Warrior Vase" feather crowns very similar to those of the east.' The wearers may, of course, be allies or enemies of the warriors in the horned and crested helmets, in either case- since there is no reason to think the vase imported ware-both apparels were evidently familiar to the Mycenean painter, and probably therefore both were to be found in the Argolid.2 If one only be local, it should be the feather crown, for a ninth century geometric vase 3 from Mycenae shows (Fig. 11, e), in even more schematized drawing, head-gear which is undoubtedly meant to be the same as that on the "Warrior Vase." 4 I even consider it quite possible that a still more degenerate representation of the feather crown is shown on another geometric vase I from Mycenae (Fig. 11, f). In geometric design the manes of horses are regularly indicated by short parallel lines, and a similar treatment is given to the long plumes-presumably horse tails-that float from Attic warriors' heads, but where representation is limited to the most essential elements, it seems unlikely that an artist would trouble to indicate the hairs of a man's head. And if it be not hair depicted in Fig. 11, f, then it can hardly be a different head-dress from that shown in Figure 11, e.6 1 A. D. Frazer, in an unpublished dissertation at Harvard University, reached the conclusion some years ago that feather crowns might be represented on the "Warrior Vase." I Perhaps introduced by the Lycians, who, according to legend, built Tiryns for Proetus and Mycenae for Perseus. One of the carved stele erected over the shaft graves at Mycenae was, some time later, covered with stucco and painted (Arch. Eph. 1896, pls. 7, 2). Two zones are fairly well preserved. The upper one shows a file of five warriors which in costume, pose and drawing are strikingly like the second troup on the "Warrior Vase." Unfortunately the heads are almost wholly obliterated; but behind the head of the first man is the stiff neckpiece of a helmet like that of the horned and plumed helmets on the vase, while five short radial lines above the head of the second man suggest that he in turn wore the feather war-bonnet. The colors of shield and kilt alternate from man to man throughout the troup, whence it may be conjectured that an alternation of the two types shown on the "Warrior Vase" was represented here, evidently in friendly association. In the lower zone are shown four deer and a smaller spotted animal with curved and bristling back, very suggestive of the warrior's head-gear. This animal looks more like a hedge-hog than anything else, but there seems little reason for repre- senting a hedge-hog in a Greek hunting scene. 3 Wide, Jb. Arch., XIV (1899), p. 85, fig. 44. Pernier (I1 disco di Phaestos, in Ausonia, III (1908-9), p. 282) agrees with Hall (B.S.A., VIII, p. 185) in considering this geometric vase to show feather crowns; on the other hand, Reinach (Rev. Arch., XV (1910), p. 62, note 2) considers that both here and on the Warrior Vase we may be dealing with skin caps.

The " curled-leaf ornament" appears first in Greece in L. H. II, approximately contemporaneously with the change from the "Shaft- grave Dynasty" to the "Tholos-tomb Dynasty"; it does not reach Crete till the later part of.the following period. II. The "curled-leaf ornament" formed the coronet of the tas- selled crowns which are represented in L. H. III, and possibly in L. H. II, as worn by women and sphinxes. These representations are found in Greece, Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus, but mostly in Greece. The crown was probably a religious vestment, and the women who wore it priestesses of the tree goddess. III. The sphinx is an oriental creature, perhaps originally of Egypt, but common in Asia before its introduction to Greece. The cults to which it belonged were probably brought to Greece from the eastern Mediterranean at the time its head-dress-the tasselled- crown-appears there, under the aegis of the Tholos tomb dynasty. IV. The "curled-leaf ornament" seems to be a conventionaliza- tion derived from a feather crown. Feather war bonnets are found in the eastern Mediterranean from the fourteenth to the fifth cen- turies before Christ; it is probable that the Luku-Lycians wore them in the latter part of the thirteenth century. They were known in Crete and Aegina by the end of L. M. I. They were established in Mycenae from at least the twelfth to the ninth century.' V. The tasselled crown appears to be a religious head-dress peculiar to priestesses and sphinxes, while the stiff feathered war bonnet-with no central tassel-is the head-gear of fighting men. The two may be quite independent creations, but the crown of relatively short incurling feathers on the Pisko-Kephalo head, and that of stiff feathers worn by the great goddess of Beth-Shan suggest a common origin. It seems certain that the development of one with crests on their heads which may be upstanding hair or may be feather crowns (so Hall, J.H.S., XXXI (1911), pp. 119 ff.; cf. illustration in Evans, Palace of Minos, I, p. 668), while the corseleted warriors on the sea wear conical helmets marked into horizontal bands, like the Mycenaean boar's tusk helmets, from which plumes float out. The value of this object as a historical illustration is undoubted- ly great, but for our purpose seriously lessened by uncertainty as to where it was made, where the scene is laid, whether the men in boats are allies or enemies of the landsmen, and whether the latter wear artificial head-dresses or not. I To those who realize the important part which misrepresentation of ancient practices plays in the formation of legend, it may be interesting to speculate on the possibility that the winged cap of Hermes is a reminiscence of an obsolete feathered war-bonnet. Compare the early fifth century terra-cotta from Locris Epizephyrii (Ausonia, III (1909), p. 187, fig. 40), where Hermes is shown with a head-dress which resembles a feather crown quite as much as it does a winged cap, and is certainly not a petasos.</page><page sequence="33">HOLLAND: MYCENAEAN PLUMES 205 from the other did not occur in Greece, but that the two were im- ported either contemporaneously or successively from the eastern Mediterranean, where the development may have taken place not long before.
