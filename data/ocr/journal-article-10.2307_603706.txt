<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS The Spirit of Islamic Calligraphy: Baba Shah Iyfahani's Adab al-mashq Baba Shah Isfahani's Adab al-mashq, a seventeenth-century Persian treatise on the nastacliq style of calligraphy, contains an unusually full description of the techniques and teaching meth- ods of the calligrapher's art. This article focuses on the inner meditative aspect of calligraphy, which Bdbd Shah explains with a terminology derived from mysticism. In poetically expressive language, this artist of the Safavid period portrays the highest level of calligraphy in terms of psychological states that transcend style. Calligraphy in this view is an art deriving from the Qur'dnic revelation as a visual theophany of the divine word. An eloquent description of the spiritual basis of Islamic calligraphy is contained in an old and beautiful Persian manuscript in the Punjab University Library, Lahore. Entitled Adib al-mashq ("Manners of Prac- tice"), this book is an autograph written in the seven- teenth century by the Iranian calligrapher Baba Shah Isfahani.1 Despite stains and wear, it is still clear and legible, and the first two pages have fine gold illumina- tion. Mawlavi Muhammad Shafi' marham edited this work and published it, with a valuable introduction in Urdu, in the first volume of his collected papers.2 The present article is a discussion of Baba Shah's explana- tion of the secrets of his art. Adib al-mashq is an un- usually complete presentation of the aesthetic and religious basis of Islamic calligraphy, and it reveals in particular a visionary method of concentration strongly influenced by Sufism. Baba Shah's treatise also com- prehensively illustrates the stages in the development of a master calligrapher. It is no exaggeration to say that Adib al-mashq is one of the most revealing docu- ments of the later development of Islamic calligraphy. Baba Shah Isfahan! was famed as a master of the nasta'liq style of calligraphy, the beautiful Persian hand developed primarily at the Timiir! and Uzbek ate- liers in Herat and Bukhara. A modern authority on cal- ligraphy has remarked, "By general agreement of historians contemporary with and later than Baba Shah, no calligrapher had reached his level in writing nastad- liq before Baba Shah appeared. He was adorned with an elegant style and a sweet hand, and even the great calligraphers recognized his mastery."3 The dates and details of his life have been subject to some dispute.4 1 Manuscripts of Adab al-mashq are evidently common in Iran, but are generally attributed to Mir 'Imad, and the text has been printed in Iran with this attribution (Adab al-mashq, ba-risala-i nasd'ih al-multik [Tehran: Karkhana-i Mashhadi-yi Khudaddd, 1317/1938]). Nonetheless, Mahdi Baydni has pro- nounced the Lahore copy to be an authentic and undeniable example of Babd Shah's handwriting, and he has shown that unscrupulous book dealers falsely ascribed the work to Mir 'Imad because of the great demand for specimens of the latter's work. Cf. Mahdi Baydni, Ahwal u asar-i khwush- nivisan-i nasta'liq-nivisdn, Intishdrat-i Danishgah-i Tihrdn, No. 1045/1 (Tehran: Ddnishgdh-i Tihran, 1345/[1967]), 1:87. Another copy of Adab al-mashq, correctly attributed to Bdba Shah but with the title Risala dar khatt, is preserved in the library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta, in MS 1623, fols. 73-86; its identity with Adab al-mashq is certain from the opening words. A manuscript of Adab al-mashq in Qum (lacking the author's name) is described in Fihrist-i nuskha- ha-yi khatti-i kitdbkhdna-i 'umuimi-i IHazrat Ayat Allah al- 'Uzmd Najafi-i Marcashi, ed.

Habib Effendi further states that Mir 'Imad (d. 1012/1603), perhaps the most admired master of nastadliq, derived his style from Baba Shah.5 If correct, this information would put Baba Shah's birth at least sixteen years be- fore Mir 'Ali's death, or no later than 940/1533-34.6 On the other hand, Muhammad Qutb al-Din Yazdi wrote that he had met Bdbd Shah Isfahani in 995/1586- 87, when the latter was still a young man, and he was amazed to see that he already excelled most of the cal- ligraphers of the day. Qutb al-Din said that if he had lived longer, Baba Shah would have surpassed Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi and Mir 'Ali Haravi, and to achieve so much he must have had a divine gift.7 This information obviously conflicts with the statement of Habib Effen- di, according to whom Baba Shah would have been over fifty at the very time when Qutb al-DIn com- mented on his youth; Qutb al-Din's statement also im- plies that Baba Shah died young, before realizing his full potential. Following the researches of the modern Iranian scholar Mahdi Bayani, we should accept the eyewitness account of Qutb al-Din, so that Bdbd Shah must have died in Baghdad in 996/1587-88; the mod- ern attempt to link Bdbd Shah into the chain of the two greatest masters of nasta'liq cannot be demonstrated.8 Arthur Pope has maintained that Baba Shah was a painter as well as a calligrapher, and has referred to a fine specimen of his work, an illustrated manuscript of Jami's Silsilat al-Zahab, dated to 977/1569-70, and preserved in the former royal library in Tehran.9 This appears to be an error, however, for the colophon to the manuscript, the earliest known with Baba Shah's signa- ture, states only that Baba Shah was the copyist.10 Re- gardless of the confusion about dates, the sources are all agreed that in addition to his natural ability, Baba Shah had received supernatural assistance in his art. One authority wrote, "The subtlety of his writing was of a miraculous order.... He had an inborn talent for calligraphy, but the beauty of his writing was a divine gift. The enthusiasm of the people of Isfahan for his writing is on such a level that they firmly believe that Mother Time has never brought forth a famous callig- rapher child like Bdba Shah. "11 Iskandar Beg, the his- torian of the Safav! court, maintains that Baba Shah was without rival in Iraq and Khurasan. He devoted all his hours to penmanship, from which he made his liv- ing, and he left many examples of his work in books, albums, and individual pieces. Although many people in Iraq had specimens of his work, it became difficult to find any that were still available, because demand had driven the price very high.12 His formal title in the court of Shah Tahmasp was Ra'Is al-Ru'asa, "Chief of Chiefs."13 The autograph copy of Adab al-mashq now pre- served in the Punjab University Library was once the property of the royal library in Bijapur. The 'Adil Shah! kings were noted connoisseurs of calligraphy, and had enticed talented calligraphers to the Deccan 5 Habib Efendi, Khatt wa Khattdtdn (Constantinople, 1305), in Shafi', 239. 6 Although Babd Shah Isfahdni quotes the poetry of Mir 'Ali Haravi (Addb al-mashq, 268), we cannot be certain that he was a student of the latter. Mir 'Ali Haravi's date of death has been put anywhere from 924/1518 to 976/1568, but the date of 951/1544 is found in a contemporary tazkira written in Herat, Muzakkir-i Ahbdb by Ilasan "Nisari"; cf. Muhammad Bakhta- var Khan, Mir'tt al-'alam, tdrikh-i Awrangzib, ed. Sajida S. Alvi, Publication of the Research Society of Pakistan, no. 55 (Lahore: Research Society of Pakistan, 1979), 11:477, n. 1. 7Muhammad Qutb al-Din Yazdi, Risdla-i Qutbiyya, in Shafic, 249. 8 Baydni, 1:86. 'Ali Efendi's report that Bdbd Shah was the student of Mir 'Ali's best pupil, Sayyid Ahmad Mashhadi (d. 986/1578-79), also appears unlikely, since Bdbd Shah seems never to have left Isfahan (ibid., 46). 9 The date of this manuscript makes it hard to place Baba Shah's birth much later than 960/1553, so that he would have been around thirty-five at the time of his death; it is possible that he could still at this age have appeared to be a young man cut off in his prime. 10 Bayani, 1:90. Bayani refers to three page specimens of Baba Shah's calligraphy in Istanbul, and mentions several manuscripts in Bdbd Shah's hand: a copy of Nasadih al-multik, dated 980/1572-73, a manuscript with the Khamsas of Nizdmi and Khusraw (994/1585-86), Chihil kalima-i nabavi (Ra- mazan 978/Jan. 1571), and Tuhfat al-abrar (982/1574-75), all in the former royal library in Tehran.

One was a masnavi poem of a thousand lines on the method of writing the nasta'liq style, for the use of beginners. Here is a sample, explaining the formation of individ- ual letters: Listen to a word gained from experience on the placement of the nastacliq script. The height of alif should be three dots, but with the same pen with which it came. One dot is enough for the width of bd; six dots is the length of the body of bd. Some of Baba Shah's verses, written under the pen- name "Hai," showed his dexterity in using the poetic conceits of calligraphy to endow the art with a reli- gious meaning. In a lyric (ghazal) verse quoted by Razi, Baba Shah made the standard pun on the double meaning of khatt as both "writing" and the "down" of a young man's new beard; in this way spiritual lovers who contemplate the loops of Arabic script (khatt) are in effect gazing upon the curly down (khatt) on the be- loved's face: "The pupil of the eye became all light in body as in soul, to look upon the sweet curls of his down (writing)."18 Although not unusual in itself, this verse in fact sums up Babd Shah's attitude toward cal- ligraphy as a highly concentrated practice of contem- plating the divine beauty, which he explained in greater detail in Adib al-mashq. Adib al-mashq belongs to a special class of writings by calligraphers about calligraphy, but it stands out by its relatively greater emphasis on the internal aspects of the art.19 Even philosophers and aestheticians seem generally to have placed more importance on the formal aspects of calligraphy than on the act of concentra- tion.20 Badb Shah's originality in this respect is evident from his distinction, discussed below, between the acquired and the unacquired "parts of script"; the ac- quired aspects begin with stylistic features, but culmi- nate in intellectual mastery, purification of the heart, and intense love. Badb Shah deliberately distinguishes these qualities from the formal categories of the classi- cal Arab calligraphers. We can also get an idea of Bdbi Shah's originality by comparing his work to Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi's poem on calligraphy, which Bdbd Shah admired and used as a model for Adab al-mashq, in 14 Schimmel, 70. 15 Adab al-mashq, 272. 16 Rawnaq 'All, Rawzat al-aq~tb al-madrif ba-mazhar-i Asafiyya (Lucknow: Dilgudaz Press, 1349/1931), 282-83; Syed Badshah Hussain, "Hand made paper industry in H.

Sultan 'Ali only makes a few com- ments on the development of inner concentration, and on the nature of calligraphic practice (mashq), perhaps feeling that these subjects should be reserved for oral teaching.22 By comparison, Baba Shah's extensive com- mentary on the ethics, internal discipline, and levels of mastery of calligraphy amounts to a major disclosure of the master-calligrapher's practice. Here we may review the contents of the treatise. As in the masnavi poem mentioned above, Baba Shah apparently wrote Abib al-mashq with the novice cal- ligrapher in mind. The author says in his introduction that in his youth he, "infaqir-i haqir-iftini, Baba Shah- i Isfahani," once happened to be studying the nastacliq script. "In searching for the light of the true beloved's beauty, he trod the path of the representation of script."23 Then he happened to see some verses in the superb hand of Sultan 'All Mashhadi, perhaps the calli- graphic treatise mentioned above; the formation of the letters in this sample illustrated the nastadliq style in a most enchanting way. "His alifs were like the tall sap- ling-figures that give peace to the soul, and the eye of his sad was like the eye of youthful sweethearts. His dai and lam were like the tresses of heart-ravishing be- loveds, and the circles of the nun were like the eye- brows of devastating beauties. Every one of his dots was like the pupil of the dark-eyed, and every one of his strokes was like the water of life in the darkness of running ink."24 In short, seeing these lines inspired Baba Shah with the desire to achieve perfection in the art of writing, so he apprenticed himself to masters of the profession. Now in writing this treatise he wished to communicate the fruit of his experience and prac- tice, so that the beginner should be made happy and pray for the welfare of the author. The book comprises six parts: first, on avoiding blameworthy qualities; sec- ond, on the parts of script; third, on the excellence and duties of copying; fourth, on cutting the pen; fifth, on the manner of composition; and sixth, on the prepara- tion of paper. Although the technical and stylistic parts of Adab al- mashq are certainly valuable, we wish to concentrate here on Bdbd Shah's expression of the spiritual aspects of calligraphy. His concern for the symbolic aspect of the penman's art is evident from the opening invoca- tion. Here the faculty of reading and writing is God's gift to humanity through Adam. The ability to compre- hend the divine message is not merely intellectual, however, but involves the heart as well. The merest reflection of God's writing on Adam's heart has in- spired the world's greatest lovers: Recollection and praise be to the lord who created the simples and compounds of the world and chose Adam out of all beings for the nobility of his capacity for knowledge, and who inscribed some letters with the pen of might on the page of his fortunate mind. The gleam of the sparks of that writing's light cast a glim- mer of the sun of Joseph's beauty into the heart of Zulaykha, and made her famous throughout the world as a lover. And a scent from the bower of that writing found its way from the rose of Layla's face and was scented by MajniUn, so that he fled in amazement to the desert of disgrace. And a letter from the notebook of that writing's beauty came from Shirin's lip to the ear of Farhad, who tore the clothes of life in the mountains of madness. Baba Shah reserves special praise for the Prophet Mu- hammad, whom he describes in traditional Islamic terms as the meaning of the book of existence, and as the source of the cosmological principles known as the Tablet and the Pen; thus the Prophet is that intelligible essence without which the world would have no mean- ing or existence: 21 Sultan 'All Mashhadi's poem, which is known by several titles (cf. Schimmel, 37), has become well known through the English translation in Qdii Ahmad, Calligraphers and Paint- ers, trans. V. Minorsky (Washington, D.C., 1959), 120ff.; this translation was not available to me. Bayani (1:253-54, with a list of the poem's headings) mentions that the Persian text has been published in Mirza Sanglakh, Imtihan al-fuzald' (Tabriz, 1291 A.H.), and that Galina Kostinova published a facsimile edition of the autograph MS in Leningrad, with an introduction in Russian, in Studies of the National Public Library, vol. 52 (Leningrad, 1957). I have used the manuscript in the Punjab University Library (P i VII 46), which curiously bears the same title as Babd Shah's work, Adab al-mashq. 22 The last heading in the Lahore manuscript is "on the beauty of script, which is [by] oral instruction" (adn ta'lim ast zabdnan). 23 Adab al-mashq, 256. 24 Adab al-mashq, 256. The last phrase, an allusion to DhU al-Qarnayn and the search for the water of life in the land of darkness (cf. Qur. 18), is based on a line in Sultan 'Ali's poem. Cf. also Schimmel, 122.</page><page sequence="5">ERNST: The Spirit of Islamic Calligraphy 283 And blessings without end be on the luminous shrine of the Prophet, for if [he,] the object of the appearance of the book of existence, had not come from the hidden world to the world of appearance, the Tablet and the Pen would not have arisen, and were it not for [him,] the reason for the production of the parts of the script of that book, neither the form of length in heaven nor the form of width on earth would have appeared.25 Baba Shah reminds us of the calligraphic art with all the terms he uses to describe the intelligibility of the world; the Pen and Tablet are the metaphysical princi- ples to which Islamic theologians ascribe the working out of creation and destiny, while the "length (dir)" and "width (sath)" of letters are two of the twelve "parts of the script" mentioned later in the text, which he says "must be copied from the script of the master."26 The treatise's brief first section summarizes the ethi- cal aspect of calligraphic practice. Baba Shah's main point is practical; the practice of the calligraphic art re- quires moderation and balance in the soul, without which the expression of the divine beauty with pen and ink becomes flawed. Because blameable qualities in the soul are the sign of imbalance, God forbid that work proceed from an im- balanced soul, for there will be no balance in it. [Verse:] The same thing that is in the jug pours out of it. So the scribe should completely shun the blameable qualities and acquire the praiseworthy qualities, so that the luminous effects of these blessed qualities appear on the beauty's cheek of his writing, and it becomes sought after by the connoisseurs' temperament.27 Bdbd Shah's stress on the ethical requirements of his art is undoubtedly an example of Sufi practice at work. In the second section, "on the explanation of the parts of script," Bdbd Shah Isfahdn! describes the sty- listic and psychological basis of calligraphy, first mak- ing a distinction between the parts that are acquired (tahsili) and those that are not. The acquired parts may be gained by persistence, application, and maturity, while the unacquired parts come without any effort. The unacquired parts of script are in fact nothing but the five elements of writing according to the famous calligrapher YaqUt (d. 1298), namely inking (sawMd), fair copying (baycz), preparation (tashmir), real rise (su'id-i haqiqi), and real fall (nuzil-i haqiqi). Baba Shah does not think these worthy of much comment, since everyone who picks up a pen to write must em- ploy these "parts," so he mentions them only for the sake of good manners toward past masters.28 Of the twelve acquired parts of script, the first nine have to do with style. This is true of composition (tarkib), equal height of similar letters (kursi), proportion (nisbat), "weakness (zaCJ) in round strokes, "strength (quw- wat)" in long strokes, width (sath), length (dar), appar- ent rise (su'ad-i majazi), and apparent fall (nuzil-i majdzi).29 Yet the last three "parts of script" go beyond style and clearly indicate attainment of mastery. The tenth part, "principles (usil)," is based on a skillful control of the nine stylistic parts: "Principles" is a characteristic which is gained from the balance in composition of the previously mentioned nine parts. All writing that contains even a little of this quality is precious, and easily will be held dearer than jewels. When this quality becomes conspicuous in writing, it is appropriate if it is loved more than life it- self. It is no secret that the [first] nine parts of script are in the position of the body, and "principles" are in the position of the soul. [Verse:] By God, you will not know the flavor of this wine until you taste it! The eleventh part, "purity (safa')," is primarily a qual- ity of the heart that is the inner source of beauty. "Purity" is that condition which makes the tempera- ment happy and refreshed, and makes the eye lumi- nous. One cannot attain it without cleansing the heart. As the Mawland [Sultan 'All] said, [Verse:] Purity of writing is from purity of heart. Through this quality there is complete possession of [the art of] writing. Just so the human face, no matter how proportionate, is not attractive if it lacks purity. It is no secret that if principles and purity are joined with "authority (sha'n)," some call it "taste (maza)," and some also call it "effect (asar)." 25 Adab al-mashq, 255-56. Babd Shah, who was a Shl'c, also included a blessing on the family of 'Ali and Fatima, "who are the center of the circle of sainthood." 26 Adab al-mashq, 261. For the symbolism of the Pen and Tablet, see Schimmel, 79; for the world as a book, see idem, 146. 27 Adab al-mashq, 257-58. 28 Adab al-mashq, 264-65. 29 Adab al-mashq, 260-62.</page><page sequence="6">284 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.2 (1992) "Authority (sha'n)," the last of the twelve parts of script, is the step that makes calligraphy into a part of mysticism, and this vocabulary is actually part of the Sufi terminology for the specification of divine mani- festations into form.30 The very act of writing, at this stage, is contemplation of the divine beauty. "Authority" is that condition in which the scribe be- comes enraptured from its display when it is found in writing, and he has done with egotism. When the scribe's pen possesses "authority," heedless of the pleasures of the world, he turns his heart toward prac- tice (mashq), and the luminous sparks of the real be- loved's beauty appear in his vision. [Verse:] Everywhere the sparks of the beloved's face are found. And it is fitting, when such a scribe sets his hand to a white page and writes a letter on it in his practice, that he reddens that paper with bloody tears from the ex- tremity of his love for that letter. This characteristic, with the aid of the praiseworthy attributes, becomes the face ('Criz) of the human soul (nafs), and by the power of the pen its form is drawn on the paper page. Not everyone can comprehend this quality in writing, al- though he may be looking at it. Likewise, even if everyone saw Layld, MajnUn saw something that others did not see.31 At this point, the calligrapher goes beyond his art to a perception of the invisible inner nature that is only par- tially revealed in script. Only those endowed with "eyes to see" have the ability to see this inner beauty. The third section contains Baba Shah's original analysis of the three levels of competence in calli- graphic practice (mashq), corresponding to the progress from discipleship to mastery. In the first stage of "visual practice (mashq-i nazari)," the apprentice stud- ies the master's writing and benefits from learning its spiritual characteristics. This also has the effect of elim- inating bad habits in weak scribes. "The beginner should be told to do this practice for a while, so that his nature becomes attached to spiritual pleasures. After that, he is told to do pen practice, but even during the days of pen practice he should do this prac- tice." The second stage of apprenticeship is pen practice (mashq-i qalami) "which is copying (naql) from the master's writing." Here the student begins by copying large specimens of isolated letters in the master's hand, so that he understands the form of every letter in the style in which it was written. Even if the copying is not easy, the student will derive considerable educational benefit from studying the large letters. After that, short compositions (less than one hundred lines) may be given to the student. Before doing anything else, the ap- prentice must contemplate the seventeen acquired and unacquired parts of script in the master's model, seeking help in concentration (himmat) from the departed spirits of the masters of calligraphy. It goes without saying that the proper techniques of trimming the pen, making ink, and preparing paper will be followed. In pen prac- tice it is of utmost importance that the student pay no at- tention to writing that is in conflict with the model to be copied, since that would be very harmful. Nor should he do any other exercise until his writing is thoroughly in the traditional style; to reach this point, no less than a full year is necessary. When the apprentice's pen prac- tice has been accomplished to this degree, it is possible to attempt the third stage of "imaginative practice (mashq-i khaydli)" for a day or two at a time, after pre- paring by doing several days of pen practice. "Imagina- tive practice" is not based on copying, but means that the calligrapher uses his purified imagination as the stage on which the forms of beauty appear. Ordinary thinking, which is necessary for pen practice, becomes an obstacle to the spontaneous power of conception of the calligraphic imagination. "Imaginative practice" is when the scribe writes not according to a model but with reference to the power of his own nature, and he writes every composition that appears [to him]. The benefit of this practice is that it makes the scribe a master of spontaneity (tasarruf ),32 and when this practice mostly takes the place of pen practice, one's writing becomes non-reflective (bi- maghz). If someone makes a habit of pen practice and avoids imaginative practice, he lacks spontaneity, and is like the reader who grasps the writing of others but himself cannot write. Spontaneity is not permitted in pen practice.33 30 "When God manifests himself to the human, from the point of view of God the name of that manifestation is 'divine authority (sha'n ilthi),' and from the point of view of the human it is called '[mystical] state (hat)'": Shah Sayyid Mu- hammad Zawqi, Sirr-i Dilbardn (Karachi: Mahfil-i Zawqiyya, 1405 A.H.), 81. 31 Adab al-mashq, 262-64. 32 Tasarruf in Persian, normally, in this kind of context, means "power, control; influence, art, cunning" (Steingass); but here I translate it as "spontaneity" to emphasize that it is a talent without external cause or deliberation, since it is "non- reflective (bi-maghz)," literally "without brain," in contrast with the intellectual discipline of pen practice. 33 Addb al-mashq, 265-68.</page><page sequence="7">ERNST: The Spirit of Islamic Calligraphy 285 Through the discipline of total adherence to the models of tradition, and the spiritual influence of the great masters, the student moves towards the pinnacle of the calligraphic art. Here, the meditative contemplation of the divine beauty overflows into the intricate forms of ink on paper. Baba Shah ends his treatise abruptly after giving three more technical sections on cutting the pen, composition of letters, and the preparation of paper, so any conclusion about the inner aspect of calligraphy is now up to us to formulate. Baba Shah's whole intent in describing calligraphic concentration is to focus on the visual contemplation of God's beauty as conveyed by the intricate shapes of black letters on white paper, and the aesthetic basis for this contemplation appears to be closely bound up with Sufi mysticism. It is well known that Islamic calligra- phy has been closely involved with the development of Sufism, and that many calligraphers were trained as disciples by Sufi masters.34 Baba Shah himself was known for his inclination toward mysticism, and it has even been suggested that he belonged to an esoteric or- der known as the Nuqtaviyya, a little-known group that was strongly influenced by letter-mysticism.35 With this background in mind, we can review some of the religious sources of Islamic calligraphy, and then reca- pitulate the main features of Baba Shah's treatise, in order to determine the points of impact of Sufism on his vision of the calligraphic art. The religious aspect of Islamic calligraphy springs from the Qur'an, the word of God as expressed to Mu- hammad, which of necessity had a strongly visual com- ponent. The Qur'an itself frequently alludes to the pen and writing, generally in contexts that emphasize writ- ing as a medium for conveying the divine message to humanity. The earliest Qur'ans exhibit large letters on parchment in the austere yet graceful Kufic style, so that the relatively small number of words on the page appear more like a visual icon than an ordinary book. Visualization of the actual form of the Arabic script in the Qur'an seems to have played an important role in Muslim religious experience from an early date, cen- tered as it was on recitation from the holy book.36 The controversies that raged over whether the Qur'an was co-eternal with God are an indication of the extraordi- nary position that the scripture assumed for the Muslim community. As Anthony Welch has written, "The writ- ten form of the Qur'dn is the visual equivalent of the eternal Qur'dn and is humanity's perceptual glimpse of the divine."37 Visual concentration on the Qur'an as the word of God was the closest possible approxima- tion on earth to seeing God face-to-face. The mystical aesthetic of Islamic calligraphy derives in particular from what Schimmel calls "the tendency to equate human figures to letters," a symbolism that links the human to the divine through the medium of writing.38 Regardless of its precise origin, the depic- tion of the human face or form as comprised of letters is a fascinating artistic phenomenon. The cabalistic faces comprised of the names of 'All, Muhammad, and Allah testify to a fundamental conviction that the hu- man being is essentially composed of spiritual ele- ments. This seemingly abstract concept is a graphic representation of an intuition of the intelligibility of the world. Everything is made of the word. The equa- tion of the human face with the Qur'an itself is both a scriptural understanding of human nature and a calli- graphic illustration of the hadith of the Prophet, "Do not disfigure the face, for God created Adam in his own image (la taqabbaha al-wajha, fa-inna alli ha khalaqa Mdama 'ald saratihi)."39 Not only can the human face be understood as scripture, but also the form of the sacred writing is a manifestation of the di- vine essence. To save a symbol like the "face of God (wajh allah)" from anthropomorphism, the Sufis under- stood it symbolically as the theophany of positive divine attributes that sustains the world in existence.40 In this symbolic configuration, the "face" of the divine being's positive or gracious attributes is framed by the black tresses of the negative or wrathful attributes, a contrast that immediately suggests white paper covered with black letters. When punning poets constantly compare the writing (khatt) on the page with the dark 34 Pope and Ackerman, 1733; Schimmel, 47, and ch.

The nuqta is the rhomboid dot or point made by the tip of the pen, which is the measure for construction of all the letters of the alphabet.

But metaphor is not anthropomorphism. The Sufis clearly understand the image of the written divine face to mean both the intel- ligible factor in human nature and the revelation of the divine nature. Thus the modern Sufi Shah Zawq! writes, "the divine face ... comprehends the totality of manifestations of the essence and unlimited know- ledge, gnosis, and secrets."42 Like gazing at beautiful human faces, contemplating the beautiful faces of cal- ligraphy is a metaphorical love ('ishq-i majlzi) that can lead to real love ('ishq-i haqiqi).43 Baba Shah Isfahani's Addb al-mashq clearly stands in this tradition of mystical appreciation of calligraphy. When Baba Shah recalled his rapture on seeing Sultan 'Ali's calligraphy, with letters like heart-ravishing beauties, it was not merely a figure of speech, but a passionate recognition of the divine manifestations in writing. In the primordial encounter of God and Adam, God "taught by the pen, taught man what he did not know" (Qur. 96.4-5). The letters inscribed on Adam's heart, according to Baba Shah, are the source of Zu- laykha's love for Joseph, MajnfUn's love for Layla, and Farhad's love for Shirin. Beyond the ethical balance re- quired of the calligrapher are the "principles" that form the soul of the lifeless mechanics of writing, and the "purity" of heart without which mere external propor- tion lacks beauty, whether in the human face or in the letter on the page. Mystical experience of the divine manifestations occurs in the state of "authority," in which the beloved's face is directly transformed into letters on the page. Even in the training of the appren- tice, contemplation of the master's letters leads directly to the spiritual world, as geometry did, according to Plato. Calligraphic practice, for those who have mas- tered its "imaginative" level, is the spontaneous result of non-reflective contemplation. This Sufi training in calligraphy unites the intellect with the heart in con- templating beauty. Where gnosis is tied to love, the very intelligibility of writing becomes passionate. For the calligrapher of the spirit, then, the world is a book, and the writing in that book, that is, the intelligi- bility that is inscribed upon matter, is the manifestation of the divine essence. To understand this writing is to know God, and knowing God is love's passionate recognition of the features of the beloved. Baba Shah described his exposure to nasta'liq calligraphy as be- ginning with intellectual recognition, but culminating in a longing that overwhelmed him. "When my heart found out the news of the existence of that water of life, and its savor took root in my palate, it realized that it was overcome with thirst, and the cry of 'thirst, thirst!' reverberated in the chamber of my breast."44 Baba Shah Isfahan! was by no means the first in the Islamic tradition to experience the rapture of calli- graphic beauty, but he has given us one of its finest descriptions. CARL W. ERNST POMONA COLLEGE 41 "This script on the face of the beloved so attracts with loveliness and grace that it has formed the totality of all sub- tleties and points of comeliness and beauty, and no loveliness of face or sweetness could surpass it" (Shah Zawqi, 155). 42 Shah Zawqi, 177. 43 Cf. Schimmel, 133. 44 Adab al-mashq, 256. With reference to the ink of the "water of life" (above, n. 24), Zawqi's observation underlies the Sufi associations of this imagery: "The specifications of the spirits (ta'ayyundt-i arwdh) are that darkness in which the water of life is concealed. In this very darkness there is a hint of the signless sign, or the absolute essence; thus it is called 'the water of life'" (p. 155).</page></plain_text>
