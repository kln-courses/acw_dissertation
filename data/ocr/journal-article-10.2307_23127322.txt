<plain_text><page sequence="1">TODD SAMUEL PRESNHR "What a Synoptic and Artificial View Reveals": Extreme History and the Modernism of W G. Sebald's Realism The War Event On the eve of World War II, when Georg Lukacs published his celebrated study of the historical novel, the "war event" had changed radically from what he describes as the social and historical condition of possibility for the rise of the genre in the first place.1 The historical novel, Lukacs argued, was the product of a particularly nineteenth-century sense of history wherein the revolutionary class struggles and social transformations endemic to national and world history were linked to a certain mode of conducting warfare. The beginnings of the genre can be traced to the period stretching from the French Revolution to Napoleon's collapse in 1814, a time in which the modern war event first emerged. Unlike the "wars of absolute states in the pre-Revolutionary period, [which] were waged by small professional armies [and... ] conducted so as to isolate the army as sharply as possible from the civilian population," warfare in the early nineteenth century had become a "mass experience" dictated by the need for nations to "create mass armies" (HN, 23). Lukacs continues: "The inner life of a nation is linked with the modern mass army in a way it could not have been with the absolutist armies of the earlier period.... Whereas the wars fought by the mercenary armies of abso lutism consisted mostly of tiny manoeuvres around fortresses, etc., now the whole of Europe becomes a war arena" (HN, 24). This had the social consequence of razing estate barriers and eliminating the separation of the army from the peo ple, something that in turn evoked new waves of national feeling across Europe as well as new investments in social and human progress.

The task of the historical novel (whose birth, Lukacs points out, can be given, far from fortuitously, as 1814, the year of Walter Scott's publication of Waverly) does not consist in "the re-telling of great historical events, but the poetic awakening of the people who figured in those events. What matters is that we should re-experience the social and human motives which led men to think, feel and act just as they did in historical reality" (HN, 42). Scott presents history realistically in order to evoke the crises, popular struggles, and social circum stances in which his characters live. Importantly, the historical novel does not in any way compromise the distinctions between fact and fiction, history and liter ature, but rather it places imaginative characters in historically real settings and thus depends on its readership to know the difference between real and imagi nary events. Tolstoy's War and Peace represents a further development of Scott's historical novel for the ways he depicts "the real conditions of life in this transi tional period" through its "popular character" and "emphasis on popular life as the real basis of historical happenings" (HN, 86), depending, once again, on his readership to distinguish between fact and fiction. In every case, it is the new social and political realities of conflicting forces, of nation- and class-based antag onisms, and the historical reality of the war event that not only spur the struggles at the heart of the historical novel but also the conditions of possibility for the genre itself. In the 1820s, during the early period of the historical novel, Karl von Clause witz, the greatest theoretician of warfare, composed his magnum opus, On War. In this uncompleted treatise Clausewitz attempted to articulate the nature and theory of modern warfare, with a particular emphasis on the logistics of con ducting offensives and staging defenses in the new theaters of war. He describes the "character of the modern battle" as follows: What do we usually do now in a great battle? We place ourselves quietly in great masses arranged next to one another and behind one another. We deploy only a relatively small portion of the whole, and let it fight it out in a musketry duel which lasts for hours, and which is interrupted now and again and pushed hither and yon by separate small thrusts from charges at the double and bayonet and cavalry attacks. When this line has gradually exhausted its warlike fire in this matter, and there remains nothing more than ashes, it is withdrawn and replaced by another. . .. [I] f the veil of night commands it to stop, because no one can see any longer, and no one chooses to run the risk of blind chance, then an account is taken by each side respectively of the masses remain ing, which can still be called effective .. . out of which then springs the resolution to quit the field or to renew the engagement next morn</page><page sequence="3">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 343 ing... . But modern battles are not so by accident; they are so because the parties are more or less on the same level as regards military organ ization and the art of war, and because the violence of war, enkindled by great national interests, has broken through artificial limits and been led into its natural paths.2 According to Clausewitz, modern battles are mass formations, fought between enemies on relatively equal playing fields, with relatively equal levels of techni cal and logistical sophistication. The temporal rhythms of the modern battle are demarcated by dawn and dusk; its conduct follows the predictable cyclicality of a day. In terms of its theater of action, the space of a battle is demarcated by the sites of engagement along the enemy lines. And finally, the action itself is largely confined to a "musketry duel" periodically interrupted by "separate small thrusts from charges at the double and bayonet and cavalry attacks." Even as a mass event, the modern battle unfolds according to the unities of time, space, and plot: it has a definitive beginning and ending, a clear theater of action, and an upshot that follows logically from a series of happenings. In other words, the modern battle described by Clausewitz and Lukacs can be realistically narrated precisely because it unfolds as a narrative and is observable as such. In this respect, we might render Lukacs's assessment of the historical novel's social and historical conditions of possibility more precise: its conditions of pos sibility rest not only upon the changing face of war as a mass event but also upon a meaningful, coherent, and reliable relationship between the event and the nar rative strategies used to emplot it realistically. The real event or happening—as in Geschichte or Geschehen-—is seen to overlap with and even mirror the narra tive means (Historie) to emplot it.3 This is because the realism of both the his torical novel and nineteenth-century practices of historiography, most famously exemplified by Leopold von Ranke's dictum that historians should represent the past "wie es eigentlich gewesen" (as it really was),4 demands a structural homol ogy between real events and the narrative strategies used to represent, capture, and render them meaningful. For this reason, it is no coincidence that the claims of photography to capture the reality of the world "out there" developed at roughly the same time as the claims of the historicist to do the same. As Siegfried Kracauer critically noted, the historicists "believe... that they can grasp histor ical reality by reconstructing the course of events in their temporal succession without any gaps. Photography presents a spatial continuum; historicism seeks to provide the temporal continuum.... Historicism is concerned with the pho tography of time."5 When Walter Benjamin wrote in his essay on Nikolai Leskov, "The Story teller," against the backdrop of World War I, that we have lost "the ability to exchange experiences," he was reflecting on the social and historical conditions of impossibility of certain modes of representation.6 With the reality of anonymous</page><page sequence="4">344 Todd Samuel Presner mass death and technical annihilation on a scale never experienced before, the nature of the war event had changed again, and hence the possibilities (and impossibilities) of representation had changed as well: battles were no longer conducted according to the cyclical rhythms of the day; they were not confined to a single theater; and the action tore apart the traditional relationship between experience and expectation, because the future could not be derived from the past. Benjamin considered the radical transformation of the face of death in World War I to be "identical with the one that has diminished the communica bility of experience to the same extent as the art of storytelling has declined."7 The experiences ofbattle and death could no longer be observed, described, and communicated using the structures and meaning-making strategies reserved for the tradition of storytelling. As Hayden White points out, modernist events—of which World War I would probably count as the first—are no longer observed and observable, let alone scalable; agents are no longer singular and individually responsible; and representations can no longer be reduced to a single, authoritative story: "It is the anomalous nature of modernist events—their resistance to inherited categories and conventions for assigning meanings to events—that undermine not only the status of facts in relation to events but also the status of the event in general."8 Modernist war events no longer unfold—as events—according to the stable uni ties of time, place, and action, and therefore they cannot be captured, communi cated, or emplotted by the traditional structures and coherences of realistic narration. And it is here that the limits of the claims of both historicism and pho tography to represent the past are also betrayed: as the photographer Frank Hur ley lamented in 1917 with regard to his inability to photograph the entirety of a battle: I have tried, and tried again, to include events on a single negative but the results have been hopeless. Everything is on such a wide scale. . . . Figures scattered, atmosphere dense with haze and smoke—shells that simply would not burst when required. All the elements of a picture were there, could they but be brought together and condensed. The bat tle is in full swing, the men are going over the top—1 snap. A fleet of bombing planes is flying low, there is a barrage bursting all round. But on developing my plates there is disappointment. All I find is a record of a few figures advancing from the trenches and a background of haze.9 Whether it is the realism of the historical novel, the exchange of stories and the communicability of experiences, or the traditional claims for the photography of history (Geschichte), in each case the nature of the event is necessarily homolo gous with the means for its realistic representation. And it is precisely the nature of the modernist event, to follow Hayden White, that renders this kind of repre</page><page sequence="5">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 345 sentation impossible.10 In this regard, then, it would seem there can be no prop erly modernist form of the historical novel, as Fredric Jameson has recently argued.11 In much the same way that Lukacs saw the rise of mass warfare in the nine teenth century as the social and historical condition of possibility for the realism of the historical novel, I want to suggest that the modernist war event represents the condition of possibility for the development of a decidedly modernist form of realism, in which the boundaries between fact and fiction, history and litera ture, real and imaginary are blurred. Far from being a category mistake, the writ ings of W G. Sebald—particularly his last novels that deal with aspects of the Holocaust, The Emigrants and Austerlitz, and his essayistic reflections on the fire bombing of Hamburg, Luftkrieg und Literatur (Air War and Literature, translated into English as The Natural History of Destruction)12—create a specifically mod ernist reality effect by the way Sebald employs the techniques of literary mod ernism to represent extreme historical events.13 These techniques include the use of intransitive writing, the dissolution of objective narration, the multiplication of perspectives, the embrace of contingency, the blurring of fact and fiction through narrative ruptures, levelings, and blockages, and the creation of what he calls "a synoptic and artificial view" (Destruction, 26) for visualizing the fire bombing of Hamburg. Unlike traditional modes of realism that aim to reproduce or reenact the past through various forms of narrative rehabilitation—including the creation of a surrogate position of inviolable spectatorship for the observer through clear dis tinctions between fact and fiction, inside and outside, agent and object—Sebald uses modernist techniques of emplotment to enact, for the very first time, the reality of the present and the past. In Austerlitz, through the interactions between the narrator and the protagonist, Sebald stages the reality of an encounter with the remains of the Holocaust in the layered spaces of the present. By virtue of his interweaving of photography and narrative, biography and autobiography, his tory and literature, Sebald produces a realistic history of the present, which, through his use of modernist techniques of narration, unlinks history from the literal reproduction of the past. In Luftkrieg und Lxteratur, Sebald enacts an extraordinarily realistic "view" of the destruction of Hamburg, which, upon close inspection of his text, is an impossible view of the modernist event made realis tic by modernist techniques. Although we may feel as if we are reliving the past in a given present, Sebald rejects what I will term the realist injunction of making the past live as it really was. The pressure of making history live in the present, of retracing original steps, of reproducing original scenes, of re-creating original cir cumstances, of repeating or reenacting historical events presupposes this realist injunction, the idea that the representation should approximate, as closely as possible, the original event. I contend that Sebald's historical narratives forgo this</page><page sequence="6">346 Todd Samuel Presner kind of conventional realism in favor of creating a reality effect by decidedly mod ernist means. The Reality Effect At the height of French structuralism, Roland Barthes invented the notion of "the reality effect" to describe how authors such as Gustave Flaubert and Jules Michelet, to cross the lines of literature and history, deployed certain narrative strategies to achieve a level of "aesthetic verisimilitude" in their descriptions of real events, objects, and people.14 Although as historians since Ranke have noted, literary realism, is not subject to the same injunction as historical realism (namely, to represent what "really happened"), both are concerned, Barthes argued, with producing a reality effect by "the direct collusion of a referent and a signifier," such that "the signified is expelled from the sign."15 The result is a verisimilitude in which what is written announces itself as and claims to pass for the real. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the nineteenth-century his torical imagination, as Hayden White has astutely suggested,16 first solidified the reality effect as the cornerstone of its discipline and science (as both senses of the concept of Geschichtswissenschaft convey). In contrast to the author of the historical novel, the historian, as R. G. Collingwood argued, does not simply imagine the past but must also apprehend and match it up with how things supposedly really were. Collingwood writes: "As works of imagination, the historian's work and the novelist's do not differ. Where they do differ is that the historian's picture is meant to be true. The novelist has a single task only: to construct a coherent picture, one that makes sense. The his torian has a double task: he has both to do this, and to construct a picture of things as they really were and of events as they really happened."17 To do so, the historian must consult documents and use his or her imagination in order to "re-enact the past in his own mind."18 Using the metaphor of bringing the dead back to life, Collingwood says the object of historical knowledge "must be of such a kind that it can revive itself in the historian's mind; the historian's mind must be such as to offer a home for that revival."19 Here, the historian's fantasy is really to live among, talk to, and, ultimately, harbor the dead. This sort of historical practice approaches a discourse of necrophilic realism. The injunction to represent reality realistically cannot, of course, be limited to the literary and historiographic practices of the nineteenth century, as Erich Auerbach has shown in his magisterial book Mimesis: The Representation of Real ity in Western Literature.20 It is persistent intellectual topos that stretches back to Greek antiquity and up through the high modernism of Virginia Woolf. Far from being incommensurable categories, then, "modern realism," as White explains following Auerbach, emerged because modernism was already "immanent in classical realism, "21 perhaps in the same way the modernist war event was already</page><page sequence="7">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 347 immanent in the nineteenth-century mass war described by Clausewitz. White explains that "modernism appears less as a rejection of the realist project and a denial of history than as an anticipation of a new form of historical reality, a real ity that included among its supposedly unimaginable, unthinkable, and unspeakable aspects: the phenomena of Hitlerism, the Final Solution, total war, nuclear contamination, mass starvation, and ecological suicide."22 What is new is the recognition that conventional modes of realist representation, with their clear oppositions between fact and fiction, subject and object, agent and patient, literal and figural, may not be sufficient or even appropriate for representing modernist events such as the Holocaust or the wholesale destruction of cities through firebombing or nuclear weapons. Therefore, the techniques of mod ernism, rather than outmoded conceptions of realism, might offer the necessary strategies for representing the reality of modernist events. In mentioning these man-made disasters, I am not trying to draw equations, nor am I attempting to level distinctions between these histories of warfare and mass death. This was, of course, the ostensible subject of the so-called Histori kerstreit (historians' debate) in 1986, namely whether the Holocaust was a unique genocide. I have no interest in participating in this debate or in using such terms. Instead, I am interested in how extreme history—emblematically demonstrated by the modernist war event of the twentieth century—breaks with the nineteenth-century concept of war studied by Lukacs in the historical novel and Clausewitz in his theory of war and thus demands new, decidedly modernist strategies of narrative representation. Extreme history or "holocaustal events" (to use White's term) such as the Shoah, the firebombing of cities, nuclear annihila tion, and, we might add, 9/11 "bear little similarity to what earlier historians con ventionally took as their objects of study and do not, therefore, lend themselves to understanding by the commonsensical techniques utilized in conventional historical inquiry. "23 The nineteenth-century war event described by Lukacs and Clausewitz—with a traditional, realist structure of beginning, middle, and end; with a definitive inside and an outside; and with a meaning that can be defini tively adjudicated on a spectrum of true and false, fact and fiction, real and imag inary—has been supplanted by a modernist event that resists traditional modes of spectatorship and witnessing as much as it betrays the limits of narrative to rep resent it realistically, truthfully, and definitively. I now turn to the work of Sebald to examine how he creates a reality effect using modernist literary techniques to convey the extreme history of the Holo caust and the firebombing of Hamburg. To do so, I focus on what I consider two of the most important sections of Austerlitz and Luftkrieg und Literatur where the idea of historical narrative is at stake: first, I analyze how Sebald writes a history of the present in Austerlitz by refusing to reenact or reproduce the extreme trau mas suffered by Holocaust victims such as Jean Amery; and second, I turn to the "synoptic and artificial view" Sebald creates to convey the reality of the</page><page sequence="8">348 Todd Samuel Presner firebombing of Hamburg. Sebald, I argue, enacts the reality of the present and the reality of the past, respectively, by way of a modernist narrative form that is always aware of the artificiality, contingency, and limits of its present-day perspective. Austerlitz is the fictional story of a German narrator who befriends a Jewish man named Austerlitz, who, as the narrator discovers in the course of their meet ings and journeys together, was sent by his parents to England on a Kindertrans port before his family was murdered by the Nazis. The novel is based upon real events—particularly the Kindertransport—and occurs in real places (among oth ers, the Liverpool train station, the former concentration camp of Theresienstadt, and Fort Breendonk outside of Antwerp), using the biographies of real people. In the case of Austerlitz, Sebald says the character is a composite of "two and a half' real people, one of whom was an architecture historian in London and another of whom was a German-Jewish woman who was sent with her twin sister from Munich to England on a Kindertransport.24 The book also includes a substantial corpus of visual material, particularly scores of photographs, ranging from fam ily pictures and portraits to snapshots of landscapes, train stations, libraries, fortresses, and concentration camps. The photograph of Austerlitz as a young boy, given to him by his nurserymaid, Vera Rysanova, upon returning to Prague more than fifty years later to search for his "true origins" (A, 125), is, according to Sebald, "an authentic childhood picture of the London architecture historian."25 Indeed, all the photographs are, at least nominally, anchored in reality, since they did have an actually existing referent at the time they were taken, although Sebald does not necessarily retain this referent. For Sebald, photography is never com mensurate with the historicist project of reenacting the reality of the past. The novel begins with the unnamed narrator telling about one of his trips from England to Belgium during the 1960s. On one such trip, he met a man named Austerlitz in Antwerp's Centraal train station's Salle des pas perdus. It quickly becomes clear that the narrator is describing an encounter from the past, one constituted by a complex history of documents, photographs, memories, and stories later assembled and reworked by the narrator some thirty years later. When they first met in 1967, the narrator later conveys to us, Austerlitz was a lec turer from a university in London, working on a comparative architectural his tory of the capitalist era, what was to be a study of "the compulsive sense of order and the tendency towards monumentalism evident in law courts and penal insti tutions, railway stations and stock exchanges, opera houses and lunatic asylums, and the dwellings built to rectangular grid patterns for the labor force" (A, 33). The "family likeness" of the railway station leads Austerlitz to explicate the his tory of the fortification: "it is often our mightiest projects that most obviously betray the degree of our insecurity" (A, 14), he says. He mentions the fortress of Breendonk, a gigantic cement structure completed shortly before the outbreak of World War I. The actual structure, we find out, lies halfway between Antwerp and</page><page sequence="9">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 349 Brussels and was used by the German SS between 1940 and August 1944 as a reception and penal camp (A, 19). In his memoirs, At the Mind's Limits, Jean Amery described how he, along with other prisoners working for the Belgian resistance, was tortured by the Gestapo in July of 1943 at Fort Breendonk.26 In the novel, Sebald places his fictional narrator in Fort Breendonk in the 1960s (not in the early 1940s) and describes how his perceptions mix with his relatively idyllic memories of childhood: "As I stared at the smooth, gray floor of this pit, which seemed to me to be sinking further and further, the grating over the drain in the middle of it and the metal pail standing beside the drain, a pic ture of our laundry room at home in W rose from the abyss and with it, suggested perhaps by the iron hook hanging on a cord from the ceiling, the image of the butcher's shop I always had to pass on my way to school" (A, 25). The narrator continues by adding that he could only guess "at the kind of third-degree inter rogations which were being conducted here around the time I was born, since it was only a few years later that I read Jean Amery's description of the dreadful closeness between torturers and their victims, and of the tortures that he himself suffered in Breendonk" (A, 26). Although it should not be simply assumed, of course, that the narrator represents the author himself, there are, as in his other novels, some important parallels that bear upon Sebald's conception of narrating catastrophic history: like Sebald, the narrator in Austerlitz was born in Germany around 1944 and grew up in the provincial town of "W" (Sebald's birthplace is Wertach), where he stayed until the age of twenty when he left Germany to study in England. From the perspective of Austerlitz, the novel is the story of a recov ered memory and the struggle to find traces of his past in the present, while from the perspective of both the author and the narrator, it is a story of "postmemory" mediated by imaginative investment and creation.27 In this scene, then, Sebald mixes past and present, fact and fiction, autobi ography and literature, and photography and narrative to create a space of terra infirma, which destabilizes both the reliability of memory and spectatorship. Within the parameters of the novel, the narrator's own memories are layered like Freudian screen memories: memories from a later period (his reading of Amery's memoirs) are amalgamated with earlier memories in 1967, which in turn are mixed with childhood memories, as if they were formed in 1943, when Amery was tortured, and all of these memories are narrated together from the perspec tive of the late 1990s. Indeed, it is this kind of layered, periscopic narration that differentiates the realism of Sebald's modernism from the conventional narrative strategies of the historical novel. Like Sebald himself, the narrator was not at Fort Breendonk in 1943 and does not share the direct experience of torture suffered by a survivor such as Amery. There is a fundamental gap between what the narrator experienced upon visiting the fortress in 1967 (and subsequently remembering and organizing this experience into a narrative of words and pictures) and what Amery experienced</page><page sequence="10">350 Todd Samuel Presner in 1943. Sebald in no way overcomes or sublates this experiential and historical gap, and for this reason he forgoes all attempts at representing or re-creating the past of 1943 as it really was or might have been. Instead, his concern is with the present, with what people born after the catastrophe know of what happened, how they gain knowledge of the catastrophe, what sorts of memories they create about it, and what kind of relationships they have to it—in other words, how they encounter, recall, and narrate the remains of the catastrophic past in the present. An inexpungeable uncertainty thus resides at the core of Sebald's modernist realism: the experiences of the past might be lost; the story might not be right; the narrator's perceptions might be nothing more than arbitrary, limited, or even fal lacious. For this reason, the narrator cannot reenact or replicate the reality of the past in any kind of authoritative or definitive sense. As Sebald explained in an interview: [This] whole process of narrating something which has a kind of reas suring quality to it is called into question. That uncertainty which the narrator has about his own trade is then, I hope, imparted to the reader who will, or ought to, feel a similar sense of irritation about these mat ters. I think that fiction writing, which does not acknowledge the uncer tainty of the narrator himself, is a form of imposture and which I find very, very difficult to take. Any form of authorial writing, where the nar rator sets himself up as stagehand and director and judge and executor in a text, I find somehow unacceptable.28 Here, Sebald consciously draws our attention to the fundamental limits of narra tive to capture or revive the reality of what happened. Austerlitz is a history of the present told from the perspective of contingent encounters with what remains of the catastrophic past. Sebald's prose is thus very different from that of Holocaust survivors, and he will make no claims for it to be something that it fundamentally is not. In a criti cal essay on the work of Amery,29 for example, Sebald insists that Amery's writ ing represents one of "the few authentic voices" on the Holocaust (Destruction, 145) because it is literally "based on the most ponderous insights into the irreparable condition of the victims, and that it is from such insights alone that the true nature of the terror visited on them can be extrapolated with some pre cision" (147, translation modified). Here, Sebald applauds the realism and authenticity of Amery's memoir but will himself never transgress this limit and presume to represent what Amery or any other victim experienced, felt, or observed. This is because Sebald's realism is concerned with something else: he is not attempting to represent accurately the reality of the past but rather to cre ate a reality effect of the present in all its uncertainty and contingency. Signifi cantly then, when the narrator in Austerlitz sees the iron hook upon which Amery was hoisted by his arms tied behind his back, it reminds him of the butcher in his</page><page sequence="11">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 351 hometown. This is not a flippant association but an acknowledgment of the lim its of both knowability and narrative strategy: Sebald refuses to restage, repro duce, or represent Amery's or any victim's suffering realistically. Not even Amery can describe the pain inflicted on his body, because those feelings "mark the limit of the capacity of language to communicate. If someone wanted to impart this physical pain, he would be forced to inflict it and thereby become a torturer him self."30 While Amery conveys, with the most objective sobriety, the truth of the torture he experienced, Sebald's writing begins with what it means today—in the space of the present—to read Amery's testimony, to visit Fort Breendonk, to look at photographs from the 1930s and early 1940s, and to walk among the remains of concentration camps and other places of torture. In so doing, he rejects the his toricist injunction of authoritatively reenacting the extremity of the past in favor of a modernist staging of the uncertain history of the present. Modernist Realism I now turn to Sebalds account of the firebombing of Hamburg. In contrast to Amery's "authentic" and "true" testimony of his torture, Sebald—who does not have any direct memories, in an experiential sense, of the events of World War II— terms his own view of the air war as "artificial." And more significantly, he makes the bold claim in Luftkrieg und Literatur that "the accounts of individual eyewit nesses [of the firebombing]," unlike those of the Holocaust, "are of only qualified value, and need to be supplemented by what a synoptic and artificial view [synop tische, kunstliche Blick] reveals" (Destruction, 25-26). The eyewitness accounts of the aerial bombardment of Germany produced by people who directly experi enced the destruction, such as Friedrich Reck or even Victor Klemperer, are "somehow untrue" (irgendwie Unwahre), Sebald maintains, because of their employment of everyday language, marked by cliches, to describe the extremity and incomprehensibility of the total destruction.31 The result of such stereotypi cal language is "to cover up and neutralize experiences beyond our ability to com prehend" (25). He continues: "The apparently unimpaired ability—shown in most of the eyewitness reports—of everyday language to go on functioning as usual raises doubts of the authenticity of the experiences they record" (25). Because of the paucity and inadequacy of realistic accounts of the firebombing produced by eyewitnesses (in contrast to those produced by survivors of the Holo caust), Sebald calls for a literature that creates a "synoptic" view of the whole or totality of the destruction. Such a view would be "artificial" or perhaps even artful, since no eyewitness could have had a synthetic view of the destruction; however, it is precisely the reality effect of such a synoptic and artificial view that testifies to the modernism of Sebald's realism. As in Austerlitz, it is the imaginary and fictional that contributes to and extends the real and historical.</page><page sequence="12">352 Todd Samuel Presner Sebald suggests that the artificiality of his view of the firebombing of Ham burg rests on the contingency of his own birth. In his lectures on the air war, he places himself directly in front—but temporally outside—of the firebombing of German cities: "At the end of the war I was just one year old, so I can hardly have any impressions of that period of destruction based on personal experience. Yet to this day, when I see photographs or documentary films dating from the war I feel as if I were its child, so to speak, as if the horrors I did not experience cast a shadow over me, and one from which I shall never entirely emerge" (Destruction, 71). Sebald continues, looking at a photograph published in a 1963 book on the history of the small German town of Sonthofen, where he moved at age eight: "Before my eyes pictures of paths through the fields, river meadows, and moun tain pastures blur together with images of destruction, and it is the latter, per versely, and not the entirely unreal idylls of my early childhood, which evoke a feeling of coming home [Heimatsgefiihl], perhaps because they represent the more powerful and dominant reality of my first years of life" (71; translation modified). In effect, Sebald's memories of World War II are not based upon direct and personal experiences but upon shadows cast by retrospectively encountered images that were contemporaneous with the beginnings of his own life.32 I will not belabor this point, as other commentators have already amply dis cussed Sebald's autobiography vis-a-vis his literary achievements.33 Instead, I am interested in the specific literary form Sebald creates for seeing the modernist war event. Perhaps because he was not a direct witness to the firebombing of Ham burg, Sebald does not create a surrogate subject moving through space analogous to Klemperer's account of his experience of the destruction of Dresden.34 He thereby rejects a central premise of traditional realism. In Sebald's opinion, Klem perer's view, like that of nearly all the eyewitnesses, is simply too personal, embodied, and limited. At the same time, he also rejects what he calls the "osten tatious avantgardist style" of certain authors such as Arno Schmidt, who attempted to use ostensibly modernist techniques—"kaleidoscopic dissolution of contours, an anthropomorphic vision of nature, mica plucked from the card index, various lexical rarities, grotesquerie, metaphor, humor, onomatopoeia, the vulgar and high-flown, violence and explosiveness and noise"—in favor of a "concrete and documentary" approach (Destruction, 58). Sebald favors the gen uineness of "authentic documents" over the "linguistic radicalism" of someone like Schmidt. Here, for example, he cites with approbation a real pathology report inserted into Hubert Fichte's novel Detlevs Imitationen "Grunspan," which details autopsies performed on burned corpses. As Julia Hell has astutely observed in her critique of Sebald's desire for the immediacy of seeing provided by the real document, this "insistence on unmediated visibility takes Sebald to the brink of a surprisingly naive epistemology and aesthetics."35 But I suggest that in his "synoptic and artificial view" of the firebombing of Hamburg, Sebald creates a modernist form of realism that has the effect of being</page><page sequence="13">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 353 "concrete" and "documentary" while radically opening up the domain of the real and the historical by way of the imaginary and the fictional. The modernism of Sebald's account does not derive from any sort of "linguistic radicalism" but rather from the multiplicity of contingent and simultaneous perspectives and the formal, literary aspects of emplotting the modernist event. To explicate this, I quote the entirety of Sebald's account of the destruction of Hamburg: In the summer of 1943, during a long heat wave, the RAF, supported by the U.S. Eighth Army Air Force, flew a series of raids on Hamburg. The aim of Operation Gomorrah, as it was called, was to destroy the city and reduce it as completely as possible to ashes. In a raid early in the morn ing on July 27, beginning at one a.m., ten thousand tons of high explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped on the densely populated residential area east of the Elbe, comprising the districts of Hammerbrook, Hamm-Nord and Hamm-Sud, Billwerder Ausschlag and parts of St. Georg, Eilbek, Barmbek, and Wandsbek. A now famil iar sequence of events occurred: first all the doors and windows were torn from their frames and smashed by high-explosive bombs weighing four thousand pounds, then the attic floors of the buildings were ignited by lightweight incendiary mixtures, and at the same time firebombs weighing up to fifteen kilograms fell into the lower stories. Within a few minutes, huge fires were burning all over the target area [Angriffsareal], which covered some twenty square kilometers, and they merged so rap idly that only a quarter of an hour after the first bombs had dropped the whole airspace was a sea of flames as far as one could see. Another five minutes later, at one-twenty a.m., a firestorm of an intensity that no one would have ever before thought possible arose. The fire, now rising two thousand meters into the sky, snatched oxygen to itself so violently that the air currents reached hurricane force, resonating like mighty organs with all their stops pulled out at once. The fire burned like this for three hours. At its height, the storm lifted gables and roofs from buildings, flung rafters and entire advertising billboards through the air, tore trees from the ground, and drove human beings before it like living torches. Behind collapsing facades, the flames shot up as high as houses, rolled like a tidal wave through the streets at a speed of over a hundred and fifty kilometers an hour, spun across open squares in strange rhythms like rolling cylinders of fire. The water in some of the canals was ablaze. The glass in the tram car windows melted; stocks of sugar boiled in bakery cellars. Those who had fled from their air-raid shelters sank, with grotesque contortions, in the thick bubbles thrown up by the melting asphalt. No one knows for certain how many lost their lives that night, or how many went mad before they died. When day broke, the summer</page><page sequence="14">354 Todd Samuel Presner dawn could not penetrate the leaden gloom above the city. The smoke had risen to a height of eight thousand kilometers, where it spread like a vast, anvil-shaped cumulonimbus cloud. A wavering heat, which the bomber pilots said they had felt through the sides of their planes, con tinued to rise from the smoking, glowing mounds of stone. Residential districts so large that their total street length amounted to two hundred kilometers were utterly destroyed. Horribly disfigured corpses lay everywhere. Bluish little phosphorous flames still flickered around many of them; others had been roasted brown or purple and reduced to a third of their natural size. They lay doubled up in pools of their own melted fat, which had sometimes already congealed. The central death zone was declared off-limits in the next few days. When punishment brigades and camp prisoners could begin clearing it in August, after the rubble had cooled down, they found people still sitting at tables or up against walls where they had been overcome by monoxide gas. Else where, clumps of flesh and bone or whole heaps of bodies had cooked in the water gushing from bursting boilers. Other victims had been so badly charred and reduced to ashes by the heat, which had risen to a thousand degrees or more, that the remains of families consisting of sev eral people could be carried away in a single laundry basket. (Destruc tion, 26-28; translation slightly modified) What is remarkable about Sebald's description of the firebombing of Ham burg is the fact that no eyewitness could have possibly seen or experienced it in this way. In a single "synoptic" view, Sebald has spliced together information and experiences culled from a multiplicity of perspectives: the U.S. Air Force and the RAF, the bomber pilots in the planes, eyewitnesses on the ground, as well as reports made by meteorologists, police, survivors, punishment battalions, and historians. His description oscillates between global and local views, perspec tives from above and below, points of view within and external to the bombing, and, finally knowledge gained before, during, and after the catastrophe. No one who was there could have seen what he describes, and yet—or for exactly this reason—it is strikingly real. Not unlike the opening scene of Robert Musil's seminal modernist novel The Man without Qualities, Sebald begins with a high-angle establishing shot before quickly honing in on the action on the ground: "In the summer of 1943, during a long heat wave, the RAF, supported by the U.S. Eighth Army Air Force, flew a series of raids on Hamburg." The sentence sets the stage by establishing clear agents and objects and foreshadows the magnitude of the catastrophe by men tioning the timing of the raids in a subordinate clause, "during a long heat wave." By the third sentence, Sebald has localized the precise temporal and spatial coor dinates of the impending war event: "In a raid early on the morning of July 27,</page><page sequence="15">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 355 beginning at one a.m., ten thousand tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped on the densely populated residential area east of the Elbe." Up until this point, the information—all gathered ex post facto—is strictly fac tual and can be corroborated in various sources; it might have been culled from a report by the RAF, the U.S. Air Force, or perhaps a history textbook. Sebald now shifts the perspective from the global to the local by using experiential knowledge reported by survivors: "A now familiar sequence of events occurred: first all the doors and windows were torn from their frames and smashed by high-explosive bombs weighing four thousand pounds." Here, factual information—the weight of the bombs—is mixed with eyewitness views that were presumably repeatedly corroborated by survivors ("a now familiar sequence of events"). This is infor mation that the pilots in the sky could not have provided through their personal experience. Following a kind of cinematic logic, Sebald then shifts from the ground (doors and windows being smashed, attics ignited) back to a high-angle perspective of the men dropping the bombs: "Within a few minutes, huge fires were burning all over the target area [Angriffsareal], which covered some twenty square kilometers, and they merged so rapidly that only a quarter of an hour after the first bombs had dropped the whole airspace was a sea of flames as far as one could see." This is information that no one on the ground could have possibly known through personal experience. Sebald shifts rhetorical register by using the vocabulary of the bombers to describe the neighborhoods ("target area") and inserts, for the first and only time, an embodied view: "the whole airspace was a sea of flames as far as one could see." This embodied view is impersonal ("as far as one could see") and refers to the subject position of the bombers; he will never create the semblance of a singular 'T'-subject on the ground. To describe the ensuing firestorm, Sebald moves between the global and the local, bringing the factual and the figurative together in order to attempt to con vey the magnitude of the fire in more than one descriptive register: precise meas urements ("two thousand meters into the sky," "a speed of over a hundred and fifty kilometers an hour") are supplemented by figurative language: "The fire, now rising two thousand meters into the sky, snatched oxygen to itself so vio lently that the air currents reached hurricane force, resonating like mighty organs with all their stops pulled out at once." He writes that human beings were driven "like living torches," that the flames "rolled like a tidal wave" and "spun across open squares in strange rhythms like rolling cylinders of fire." At this point, the narrative, which up until now had moved chronologically with specific markers for temporal units ("at one a.m.," "five minutes later," "burned like this for three hours"), begins to move simultaneously. In a style reminiscent of cinematic mon tage, Sebald splices together four local scenes, which are causally and spatially distinct from one another: "The water in some of the canals was ablaze. The glass in the tram car windows melted; stocks of sugar boiled in bakery cellars. Those who had fled from their air-raid shelters sank, with grotesque contortions, in the</page><page sequence="16">356 Todd Samuel Presner thick bubbles thrown up by the melting asphalt." These four shots are not further described, and the reader cannot know if they were temporally or spatially con tiguous with one another. Historical succession has become synchronic through the modernism of the cinematic. And in each of these short sentences, the unprecedented intensity of destruction by fire brings about horribly miraculous transformations of matter: burning water, liquid glass, caramelized sugar, and molten asphalt. In the next sentence, the rhetorical design of the narrative completely changes register. Sebald inserts a reflexive query: "No one knows for certain how many lost their lives that night, or how many went mad before they died." But rather than elaborating on the ethical implications of his reflection or attempt ing to specify how many did in fact die that night, Sebald cuts to a description of the city on the following day. He juxtaposes figurative and factual language ("When day broke, the summer dawn could not penetrate the leaden gloom above the city. The smoke had risen to a height of eight thousand kilometers, where it spread like a vast, anvil-shaped cumulonimbus cloud.") and then gives a piece of information that was presumably provided by the bomber pilots upon their return: the fact that they felt the heat of the firestorm through their planes. On the next page, Sebald grounds this aerial perspective by a photographic parataxis of blackened clumps, elucidated by the text as "horribly disfigured corpses."36 He ends his artificial and synoptic view by taking the everyday lan guage of domesticity, particularly cooking with fire, and uses it to describe the horrible aftermath of finding people who had been "roasted brown or purple," "reduced to a third of their size," "doubled up in pools of their own melted fat," "overcome by monoxide gas," "cooked in water gushing from bursting boilers," and "so badly charred and reduced to ashes by the heat. . . that the remains of families consisting of several people could be carried away in a single laundry basket." The final phrase turns the seemingly incomprehensible and impossible into the horror of the possible: the fact that whole families "could be carried away in a single laundry basket" (my emphasis). Through the multiplicity of intersecting perspectives (global and local, bomber and victim, inside and outside), accelerated temporal shifts (from chronological time to historical simultaneity), and precise factual information (flames two thousand meters high, speeds of over a hundred and fifty kilometers an hour, smoke rising to a height of eight thousand meters) coupled with expe riential observations ("sank with grotesque contortions into melting asphalt") and the variance of modes of description (ranging from the historical and quan titative to the metaphorical and reflective), Sebald has created a modernist rep resentation of the firebombing of Hamburg that no eyewitness or subject could have ever had. Even while it is ultimately incomplete, it offers a "synoptic view" (and there may be many synoptic views) of the totality of the destruction through the multiplicity and simultaneity of its many contingent perspectives. Sebalds</page><page sequence="17">Extreme History and Sebald's Realism 357 description has a realistic effect without the traditional narrative structures and meaning-making strategies of realism. And at the same time this view is utterly "artificial," because no eyewitness could have possibly seen it as described. It is an imaginary artificially constructed view of a real historical event. To use Hay den White's terms, Sebald has emplotted the modernist war event by the repre sentational strategies and narrative techniques of literary modernism. To conclude, far from creating a surrogate spectator and attempting to recon stitute the reality of the past through a kind of narrative reenactment, Sebald has created a reality effect of extreme historical events by decidedly modernist means. He does not reproduce or repeat the past but rather stages and enacts it as the original and, hence, will not refer back to an event in any kind of rehabilita tive sense that one would expect from traditional realist approaches. In both Austerlitz and Luftkrieg und Literatur, Sebald uses literature—in his particular modernist form of multiplying perspectives through cinematic techniques, of blurring the real and the imaginary of embracing contingency and uncertainty as structuring principles of narrative, and, finally, of creating a synoptic and artifi cial view of extreme history—to extend historical knowledge and interrogate what history is and can be. And even while he unlinks history from a literal, real istic reproduction of the past, Sebald never gives up the concrete, documentary quality of the reality effect. Thus, what is at stake in his prose is not simply the historical (geschichtlich) status of the Holocaust or the firebombing of Hamburg; rather it is the possibility of creating a new narrative form (Historie) to represent these kinds of extreme, modernist events. In this regard, then, Sebald's writings on the modernist war event could be productively situated within the lineage of the historical novel described by Lukacs, perhaps even representing its properly modernist incarnation.

In his attempt to capture the realism of the great battle scene, Hurley composed a gigantic, seamless composite photograph, something that actually underscores the dissociation of the modernist event from nineteenth century strategies of and claims for realistic representation. 10. To be sure, Lukacs does not consider the historical novel to be a dead form after World War I; instead, from the point of view of the rise of Nazism, he sees the arrival of an "anti-fascist historical novel" or "the historical novel of anti-fascist humanism" (HN, 282) in which the forms and methods of portrayal, including the composition, struc ture, and action, are continuous with the classical historical novel but now attuned to the challenges of developing "a new democracy" (HN, 344). Of course, because these hopes for a new democracy in Germany and the Soviet Union were squelched in the years immediately following the book's publication, many readers, as Fredric Jameson points out in his introduction, consider the final section as hopelessly naive or simply outdated. But as Jameson argues, it is precisely Lukacs's attempt to engage dialectically with the present that renders the work far from "an archeological narrative about an extinct form" and more as an "address [to] the present with a partisan urgency" (HN, 4). Although I share this view, I do not think that Lukacs adequately reflected on the specifically modernist possibilities of the historical novel vis-a-vis the changing nature of the war event. Using the work of Sebald, I attempt to do precisely that. 11. Fredric Jameson, "The Historical Novel" (paper delivered at a symposium at UCLA, May 26, 2004).

Marianne Hirsch developed the concept of "postmemory" to characterize the mem ory of people who were born without direct memories of an event but who still have a "deep personal connection" with it.
