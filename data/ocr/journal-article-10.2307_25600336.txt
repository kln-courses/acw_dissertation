<plain_text><page sequence="1">NANCY M. GOSLEE Phidian Lore: Sculpture and Personification in Keats's Odes Even after those three shapes "Like figures on a marble urn" circle past him a second time, the speaker of the "Ode on Indolence" fails to recognize them, "as may betide / With vases," because he has been "deep in Phidian lore."1 Love, the first of these three figures, might well seem alien to one immersed in the study of the heroically-scaled Elgin marbles which Haydon and others claimed for Phidias.2 Yet his failure to recognize Ambition and Poetry is striking for that very reason: both in the letters and in the poetry itself, Keats frequently expresses his epic ambitions in analogues of heroic sculpture. As early as "Sleep and Poetry," he defines poetry as "might half slumb'ring on its own right arm" (1. 237). As he finishes Endymion he tells Haydon of his plans to shape a narrative in a "more naked and Grecian manner," and he later imagines seeing "shapes of epic greatness stationed around me."3 Within his two Hyperion poems, sculptural analogues repeatedly define both the presence of his Titanic forms and the thematic crises of his narrative.4 Thus the contrast between the massive sculptural grandeur of Keats's epic attempts and the smaller scale of his odes, "like ... a marble urn," apparently contributes to the speaker's failure in "Indolence" to recog nize his own ambition and poetry in their new guises. Yet another contrast, also based on Keats's fascination with sculpture as analogue, is more central to the art of the odes themselves. In contrast to the figures Keats describes on the Grecian urn, distanced from him by the direct limiting presence of the urn and its frieze as objects, these figures in "Indolence" are closer to the poet's own verbal processes: their i.Jack Stillinger, ed., The Poems of John Keats (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard U.

The devices of language are more pri mary here than the devices of the plastic art of sculpture; but sculpture becomes central, I would suggest, to exploring those techniques of language. In this ode, and also in "Psyche," ''Melancholy/' and "To Autumn," the relationship between the sculptural pose of a central figure and the acknowledging of that figure as personification forms a signifi cant pattern of dramatic recognition. It also suggests a modification of several patterns that others have seen in the odes?the model of tran scendence and return, for example, and particularly the "epiphanic" structure Geoffrey Hartman proposes for the odes preceding "Autumn," a structure in which a god is called upon and becomes manifest in this world.5 For these "mystic personifications," to use Hazlitt's phrase, have the appearance of gods. In fact it is their appearance, or more precisely the tactile qualities of these "mystic personifications," which have received high praise as they convince us of the god's mythic presence. As Reuben Brower writes, our experience of the tactile gourds and hazel shells in "Autumn" de termines our assent to the "plastic poses" of Autumn in the next stanza,6 and we accept the central figure simultaneously as natural sculpture and as a god. In a similar way, the concrete, tactile images in "Psyche" and "Melancholy" lead us to accept their presence as cult figures in their temples. Their mythic presence is conjured up less by voice than by vision and touch. Yet the voicing ofthe abstract concept, the announcing of the figure as personification, seems to threaten that presence. More distanced from immediate physical experience than globed peonies or plumped hazel shells, these concepts prove more embarrassing in the intellectual chastity of their naming than are the "slippery blisses" ana lyzed by Christopher Ricks.7 Paradoxically, then, we praise the con creteness of Keats's method but "start and disordered fly," like Collins's Fear, from accepting Keats's use ofthe conceptual as well as the mythic 5- See Geoffrey Hartman, "Poem and Ideology: A Study of Keats's 'To Autumn,"' in The Fate of Reading and Other Essays (Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 1975), pp. 132 ff. In The Poet's Calling in the English Ode (New Haven: Yale U. Press, 1980), Paul H. Fry develops an anti-epiphanic reading in some respects similar to mine, though he bases his general argument on the act of calling, not that of naming and thus splitting sculptural wholeness. I am inclined to follow Hartman for odes that do not use the particular pattern of sculpture and personification that I describe here, though one might develop specific anti-epiphanic arguments for a number of sub-categories of the ode without seeing all callings as signs of both present and future absence. 6.

As Jean Hagstrum has argued, these odes developed, in part, from the aspect of the ut pictura poesis tradition represented in works like Ripa's Iconologia: a. concept is given form as if it is a godlike person to be defined through a description of its stance, its emblematic gear, and its attendants.9 Modifying this pictorial emphasis are several specifically sculptural aspects, some common to Collins and Keats, and the last I shall name characteristic of Keats alone. As classicism revives, what had originally been a belief in its gods is deflected in two different directions: on the one hand, it becomes a far more limiting acknowledgement of the empirical reality of the statues themselves as tangible and visible records of the sculptors' sense of divinity. On the other, it is transformed into abstract concepts, rationalized forms of the powers once figured in mythic narrative and now recognized as psychological or physical forces. So, as Keats in Sleep and Poetry makes concrete the "might" of poetry as "half slumb'ring on its own right arm," he moves from the idea of "might" to the semi-divine figure who most typically represents it and thus to a pose that describes the Farnese Hercules?or also, perhaps, the less conventionally conceptualized Elgin Theseus. Moreover, from Winckelmann through Reynolds to Flaxman, the ideal and abstract qual 8. In The Visionary Company (1961; rpt.

GOSLEE ities of classical sculpture make this art appropriate for the illustration of concepts thought to be universal and permanent,10 though the con cepts Collins and Keats illustrate are not exactly those of a stable and serene culture. Though all of these influences tend to view sculpture as a visual art, another strain in Winckelmann's attitude toward sculpture, his claim that it represents the intense physical perfection of the Greek body developed in harmony with nature, also reinforces an empirically-based definition of sculpture as a tactile art. This tactile definition, proposed by James Harris, J. G. Herder, and George Cumberland,11 seems to have exerted little influence on Collins's sculptural personifications per ceived through sight; but when Haydon champions the muscular ac tuality of the Elgin marbles, he aligns both himself and Keats with this interpretation.12 For Keats develops personifications which display, in contrast to Collins's, a greater density both of human and of sculptural physicality, a tactile nature which is both internal (haptic) and external (tactual).13 This tactile density is reinforced by the more static and hence more statuesque poses of Keats's allegorical personifications. Unlike Collins's frantically running Fear, Keats's figures sometimes seem to attain the weight of marble though seldom its coldness. If Collins's Fear is victim of his own concept, we might say that Keats's figures are, all of them, under the sway of an ambiguously-valued indolence. Yet it is not only the personifications that display this sculpturesque quality. One of the most important points about the "Ode on Indolence" is that Keats presents no statuesque central figure representing this ab straction?none, that is, but himself, for as his eyes are "Benumb'd," his "pulse grew less and less," until finally, he claims, "Ye cannot raise / My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass" (11. 17, 51-52). Though the landscape is idyllic and summery, he is as "deep" in a Phidian pose as Saturn is at the beginning of Hyperion. If we look more closely at the other odes, we can see that whenever the poet himself appears, his indolence appears as well. Though in the line above he stations himself as the poet has found Psyche, "calm-breathing on the bedded grass" (1. 15), in that ode the poet also finds himself "fainting with surprise" (1. 8). In the "Ode on Melancholy," the speaker denies a static drowsi io.

In the "Ode to a Nightingale," "a drowsy numbness pains" his "sense" and later he imagines himself becoming a "sod," losing human form and human consciousness together (11. 1-2, 60). Though a sod is not even the Adamic "red clay" out of which Blake's Milton can sculpt a new form for Urizen, it does form an extreme example of this state of mind, or even of non-mind, which in the "allegorical" odes seems partially shared with the plastically or sculp turally developed personification and partially to precede it. A number of critics have described this characteristic starting-point of the narrator, emphasizing as does David Perkins the sleep or trance-like state as a sinking toward Lethe which also becomes a prelude to visionary transcendence. He also suggests the close relationship of that indolence to the poised potentiality of negative capability, and to the loss of identity attending the intensity of its absorption into another object or self.14 John Jones is, I think, the only critic who explores the denial of consciousness or at least of self-consciousness as an assimilation of the human subject to a sculptural object.15 More recently, James Land Jones has suggested that this state is like a timeless world of myth, in which subject and object are not differentiated.16 In several theories of aesthetic history much discussed as Keats wrote, the definition of historical stages of consciousness led to the characteri zation of one of those stages as both sculptural and mythic in its inte grated wholeness and sense of timelessness. Schiller's distinction be tween the naive and sentimental, plastic and verbal qualities of ancient and modern arts led to A. W. Schlegel's and Coleridge's distinction between the classical consciousness as sculpturesque and the modern as "picturesque." The classical era is sculpturesque both because its para digmatic mode of expression is that of sculptural objects, and also because the characteristic state of mind of its artists is one of unreflecting harmony, even identity, with the mythic forces of the natural world. The classical state of mind in itself unifies subject and object; its paradigm or model of sculpture, moreover, may refer either to sculptural artifacts or to the consciousness which generates them. The romantic conscious ness, analogous to painting in its representation of vast indefinite ranges of space and time, also displays, according to Schlegel, an ability to constitute its own order, to shape its own world through the reconcil 14- In The Quest for Permanence: The Symbolism of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats (Cam bridge, Mass.: Harvard U.

GOSLEE iation of opposites.17 Above all, however, in contrast to the naive or unreflecting sculpturesque state, the romantic state of mind is conscious of itself. A progression from Saturnian indolence to "wakeful anguish," then, may characterize the individual mind as well as whole cultures, as a roughly similar analysis in Keats's May 3, 1818 letter to Reynolds sug gests (Letters, 1, 280). To equate the "realm . . . Of Flora, and old Pan" (Sleep and Poetry, 11. 101-02) and the "infant or thoughtless Chamber" with the massive and somber Phidian poses of the Titans in Hyperion as the first stage of this dialectic may seem forced; yet clearly the Titans themselves must move from an early innocence into the "Chamber of Maiden-Thought" and then into the dark passages beyond. They change from sculpture-like objects who once had sculptural consciousness to match, into physically static but facially and psychologically anguished examples of a modern consciousness. In these odes, it is precisely the speaker's categorization of "thought" which transforms the objective sculptural presence of such central figures as Psyche and Melancholy into the abstract categories of acknowledged personification. With that acknowledgement, too, the speaker, who has begun to share in his own consciousness the sculptural qualities of the figures, must separate him self from them. Cassirer, Webster, and others have suggested that the personification of abstract forces represents historically the intrusion of reason and its abstract categories into a more spontaneous, direct, im manent world.18 In the history of the individual poet or of the mood he chronicles in an individual ode, then, the establishing of these statuesque figures seems to extend myth but becomes an exercise in conscious fiction-making with their naming, and limits myth with the "bounding outline" of conceptualization. Paradoxically, even as the speaker's an alytic thought fragments the mythic wholeness of the figure, it becomes capable of expressing the speaker's intense emotion, a capability attri buted in the eighteenth century to such personifications. One way such emotion can be explained is to see the personification as the vehicle for 17- For Schiller, see Naive and Sentimental Poetry I On the Sublime, intro. and tr. Julius A. Elias (1966; rpt.

Webster, "Personification as a Mode of Greek Thought," JWCI, 17(1954), 10-21.</page><page sequence="7">PHIDIAN LORE IN KEATS 79 a mythic, godlike presence.19 Though that presence is a quality of the figure as a whole human-shaped, dramatically-gesturing form, it is placed under great tension and nearly lost as the personification is named and as its attributes are catalogued with increasingly sharp visual and conceptual detail. Another theory argues that personification expresses intense emotion in the speaker because it is a form of figurative, thus intense and spontaneous, language.20 Recognition of its figurative nature by the reader would then prove essential to its force; and recognition by the speaker would intensify still further the tension between the sculp turesque, godlike figure and the abstract concept. We might, then, see its power as emerging from the sudden, almost sublime, disjunction of myth and conceptual thought, in which the indolent narrator awakens. Another model may help to clarify the nature of this disjunction. Angus Fletcher describes personification in Coleridge's writing as "the figurative emergent of the liminal scene," the scene of threshold between a "sacred space"?an enclosed garden or temple?and a "labyrinth," or between sacred stillness and profane movement and process. He argues, further, that these transitional figures are metaphorical in contrast to the synecdoche, or ordered microcosm of the temple, and the metonymy, or almost meaningless series of contiguities, of the labyrinth.21 Fletcher's and Schlegel's dialectical models differ most clearly in their evaluation of the second pole. In Fletcher's "archetypal" version, the labyrinth seems to represent a fall into the disordered experience of the ordinary world, while in Schlegel's optimistic and subjective version, this world's nature may be acknowledged as vast and separate from the mind or from sacred places, but the mind claims a post-Kantian, progressive power to create order with its own new harmonies. In Schiller's earlier formulation of these polarities, the "sentimental" or romantic is viewed as far less optimistic and more labyrinthine, so that his definitions form a kind of bridge between those of the other two critics. In his allegbrical odes Keats sometimes seems closer to Schlegel and sometimes to Fletcher as he awakens to the consequences to his personified figures. The naming and recognition, however, repeatedly announce a fragmentation or emptying from a state of sculptural wholeness, whether that wholeness is an aspect of the narrator's state of mind, his sculptural pose, or a central figure's pose. In the optimistic conclusion of the "Ode to Psy 19- See especially Schluter, pp. 169 ff. 20. See Norman Maclean, "Personification but not Poetry," ELH, 23 (1956), 165 ff. 21.

GOSLEE che," for example, Keats follows Schlegel's model more closely than Fletcher's; but in the complex representation of "Melancholy" as god dess, the opposed contraries of the third stanza suggest and yet move beyond the mind's control, doubling back toward Fletcher's first cate gory. "Indolence" and "Autumn," in diverging further from the basic pattern of the allegorical ode, suggest two different avoidances of the abrupt recognitions which emerge in both Schlegel's and Fletcher's mod els as I interpret them. Though the poet names Psyche in the questioning proem of that ode, the dominant impression of the first stanza is the sculptural stationing both of its paired lovers and of the narrator. Because the poet wanders "thoughtlessly" (1. 7) and describes himself as "fainting with surprise," even before he tells what he sees, his own momentarily sculptural sus pension of thought and consciousness seems a necessary prelude to the appearance of Cupid and Psyche "couched ... In deepest grass" (11. 9 10). In rejecting the manuscript variant of "freckle-pink" for the more Winckelmannian "silver-white" ofthe flowers, Keats preserves a sculp tural quality even in the lush natural setting (note to 1. 14). His recog nition of Psyche at the end of the stanza, however, ends this "soft handed" shaping by slumber. In stanza two not only the faded Olym pians, but even Psyche herself have been distanced and demythologized, as stars fading into the light of common day. Only the building of a "fane" in a "region of [his] mind," a mind which acknowledges Psyche, along with the gardener Fancy and "the warm Love," as deliberately abstract personifications, can resurrect the psyche as an active power (11. 50-51, 67). The modern or romantic consciousness, then, unsculpts or shatters both Psyche and poet, but in the process the poet gains that complex consciousness which contains both stationed myth and its de nial, both "moss-lain Dryads . . . lull'd to sleep" (1. 57) and the "pleasant pain" (1. 52) of fusing contraries into a new if self-conscious whole. In the pictorial vastness ofthe landscape, "far, far around" (1. 54) in Keats's final stanza, he seems deliberately to evoke the picturesque metaphor for modern consciousness used by Schlegel and Coleridge. Hazlitt, too, had emphasized these larger temporal and spatial perspectives of the pictur esque or romantic, as he reviewed the 1815 translation of Schlegel's lectures.22 More important than this transformation from sculptural group toward scene, however, is the symbolic nature of this scene as a "working brain" which reshapes its own labyrinth into a modern, ro mantic sanctuary through the reconciliation of contraries.23 22.

Bunn, "Keats's Ode to Psyche and the Transformation of Mental Landscape," ELH, 37 (1970), 581-94, for a reading which emphasizes such a final creative</page><page sequence="9">PHIDIAN LORE IN KEATS 81 In "Melancholy," the poet describes an initial statue-like indolence of the sort that precedes both mythic vision and its anguished questioning in "Psyche" and in "Nightingale." Moreover, the pilgrim succeeds in his discovery of the goddess Melancholy by experiencing the full inten sity of things perceived almost wholly in tactile, sculptural dimensions: from the "globed peony" to "Joy's grape," and from the mistress' clasped hand and "peerless," blank and statue-like eyes,24 to the veiled, statue-like goddess in her shrine, where his soul will become a part of her sculptural tableau. In this ode, however, the speaker's primary mood of sculptural indolence is rejected for a "wakeful anguish" which be comes a mode of perception that builds toward and yet destroys the external, mythic figure of the goddess and her sacred temple. Through that "wakeful anguish," the concrete sculptural objects of the second stanza are re-interpreted, not sub specie aeternitatis, but under the aspect of mortality and a conceptual analysis that witness a loss of mythic wholeness. The recognition of mutability in the objects seen in a sus pended moment in stanza two is simultaneous with the naming of the personifications in stanza three. Thus Melancholy and her borrowed temple are not a willed recreation of primitive, sculptural consciousness and so a synecdoche for timeless order, but begin to slide toward the logically unconnected contiguities of metonymy, and thus closer to Schiller's view of romantic consciousness. This disintegration appears clearly as the speaker works through an apparently conventional descrip tion of the goddess's "train": Joy, Pleasure, Poison, and then an altered Joy. "Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips / Bidding adieu" (11. 22-23), may exemplify an expressive sculptural iconography, but he also bids adieu both to himself and to those other sub-gods as anthropomorphic presence, for "Joy's grape" a few lines later is puzzlingly both less and more than a personification. This abandonment of visual resolution while substituting an even reconciliation of contraries, though without relating them to my sculptural-to-picturesque historical analogy. Paul Fry argues, in contrast, that the figure of Psyche must be reduced to the ground?or, better, that "one cannot bring about the merger of genius with place except by reducing the former to the latter. . . . The soul finally cannot be signified?it is the empty space?because it is unsignifying, Psyche is the simple quiddity of things known for what they are. She has no wings, no figure at all, and to interrupt the erotic embrace that represents her inseparability from things as they are, to 'transport' or tran scendentalize her, is to annihilate her nature" (p. 231). In discussing the odes' "quasi allegorical" schemes, however, Fry goes on to make a more general point which suggests a dialectic something like the one I propose: "Each ode . . . remains . . . what Keats in his letters called an 'abstract image.' Form invokes its opposite, the sprawl of indolence" (p. 233). 24. This pun on "peerless" was suggested by my colleague Richard Kelly; see lines 17, 28, 19-20, 25-30.</page><page sequence="10">82 NANCY M. GOSLEE more intense tactile quality is prepared for by the intervening transfor mation of "aching Pleasure nigh, / Turning to poison while the bee mouth sips" (11. 23-24). The adverb "nigh" seems to locate another sculptural figure like the earlier Joy, but here, instead of defining it in an external, poised gesture, Keats uses the internally kinetic or haptic image of "aching," which changes its meaning as we complete our reading ofthe phrase. At first, "aching Pleasure nigh" aches in its desire to be still closer to the focal "she" of the stanza's beginning, and thus opposes Joy's "bidding adieu."25 Like Collins's "frantic Fear," this per sonification is humanly vulnerable to the feeling it represents. The emo tional "feeling" which renders the physical ache, however, is reversed "while the bee-mouth sips"; and the threat of reduction or fragmentation already seen in that peculiar synecdoche becomes more extreme in the next line. For the human shape of the metaphoric representation is increasingly difficult to see. What began as a procession of visualized, sculptural figures shows, finally, the instability that Fletcher associates with his metonymic labyrinth. Thus, though Hagstrum argues in dis cussing Collins's images that an eighteenth-century reader almost un consciously fills in the visual gaps to construct a fully visual figure (Sister Arts, p. 280), here Keats practices a denial of visual consistency or wholeness of human figure that suggests the Burkean sublime. If Melancholy herself, in her "sovran shrine," seems to restore that tableau, a part of her significance is the inclusion of this threat of chaos. The chaos is only visual, however, and not verbal or conceptual; sig nificantly, in the second appearance of Joy, the sculptural metaphor of crushing the grape becomes merged with the images of taste earlier in the ode. The physical, temporal act of speaking, then, and the mental acts of constructing and analyzing verbal metaphors, replace the static, visually sculptural, and mythic in the significance of Melancholy. She becomes a fictive goddess both of the consciousness of mutability, to which men must submit, and of the mutable yet ordering speech and fictions of poetry. In the "Ode on Indolence," the poet's own inert self successfully fends off such strenuous effort by maintaining it in a sculpturally static pose and the figures "like figures on a marble urn" (1. 10). There is a kind of wry humor in the poet's refusal to build their triple rhythm of three figures and three turns into the larger structure of the stanzas, so that 25. In seeing the centrality of the lover here, I have been influenced by Helen Vendler's essay, "The Experiential Beginnings of Keats's Odes," SiR, 12 (1973), 596-98.

See Keats and the Mirror of Art, pp. 48-49.</page><page sequence="11">PHIDIAN LORE IN KEATS 83 the movement of the figures would correspond to the movement of the poem. Similarly, he refuses to develop these personifications either as visual forms or as human characters. For if they were to step out of line, becoming more fully dimensional and more fully human, they would face not him but each other in tragic conflict. Paradoxically, as A. W. Schlegel develops his definition of a "sculpturesque" Greek culture, he compares Greek tragedy to fully-rounded sculptural groups such as the Niobe or the Laocoon. Greek epic, with its larger cast of characters and endless episodes, he compares to the bas-relief.26 Though he develops a theory of organic form, including tension between opposites, to make the first analogy almost work, the second seems based on a striking ignorance of classical epic structure?though an ignorance to some ex tent sanctioned by Aristotle.27 Keats, of course, has two images of bas relief at hand: the relatively small scale of the "figures on a marble urn," and the massive scale of the "Phidian" marbles Elgin had brought from the Parthenon. The two images seem to struggle with one another. On the one hand, the three figures like those on a marble urn seem reduced by comparison with the Elgin figures and suggest that Love may cause a diminishing of epic, ambitious poetry. On the other hand, the repeated circling of the urn-figures in the ode, like the fragmented, hence appar ently directionless, march of the Elgin figures,28 suggests that Keats's potential epic, like bas-relief, has no action or plot as its animating soul, its only plot being too "deep-disguised." Indeed, the "plot" of Hyperion is in one sense the development of human feelings in the poem's once sculpturally-impassive figures; and the poet's dialogue with Moneta in the revised version struggles to evaluate the relation of humanitarian benevolence, a form of love, to poetic ambition. Thus the apparent diminishing may point to a discovery of a truer theme. Imagined either as free-standing sculpture or as bas-relief, then, these figures arouse more anxiety than a retreat to their sculptural stasis by the narrator can fully resolve. In consequence, once he names the three, he abruptly depersonalizes them. Only Poesy resists the reduction to sexless abstraction in the next stanza, and she, too soon vanishes as a person. Yet this rhetorical gesture is even less successful than restricting their scale or their fuller humanness, for treating these words as ideas and not as figures means he must confront them without the mask-like "disguise" offered either by their role as sculptural bas-reliefs or by personification.

GOSLEE refusal, he attempts to relegate them to a limbo of "ghosts," "shadows," and "phantoms" (11. 49, 51, 59), products of superstition and visual illusion, and thus suspends the need to commit himself to any of them? or to anything beyond his present indolent state. Finally, as he refuses to label himself explicitly as an embodiment of the abstraction, Indo lence, the poet can leave his own Phidian, if unheroic, pose uninter preted. In the "Ode on Indolence" the poet insists both upon his own statu esque presence as a figure of indolence and upon his own present mo ment as sufficient; in "To Autumn," he is present in the poem not in figure but only in the dramatically realized voice in which he addresses the humanized season. If the recognition and naming of the circling figures in "Indolence" makes almost explicit a crisis of the speaker's future aims and thus his future identity, his refusal to announce and become fully aware of himself as an explicit embodiment of the abstract quality "Indolence" allows him to remain a little longer in that "Phidian" half-resting state, even though its statue-like qualities threaten to increase his guilt over his own inertia. By posing as his own epic, he can avoid writing it and perhaps almost avoid thinking it. A similar but more subtle and gradual refusal to name and thus to be conceptually explicit makes possible the intensely sculptural personification of "To Au tumn."29 The poet's opening word, "Season," is as close as the text comes to explicit naming, and as that address merges into the specific sequences of ripening described haptically in the first stanza, even its minimal abstract quality is suspended. When the sculptural figure emerges in the second stanza, it seems to grow outward from the animate forces already displayed in the first, so that the poet's making of metaphor seems as valid and unobtrusive as the ripening of fruit. The poet no longer describes the grounds or powers of his own "working brain," as he does in the first three ofthe odes discussed here, but rather the workings of objective natural process. The figure so formed is stationed not only between the half-reaped furrows or the banks of a brook, but between the almost conceptual meaning of "season" and the inarticulate, sequen tial songs of the natural creatures which form the "train" of this per sonification. Because the figure develops only after the abstract address, "Season," it is made consciously metaphoric and not fully mythic, yet because the abstraction is so subdued and suspended?as are the tensions between sculptural figure and natural, mutable landscape?it manages 29. Schluter notes a delay in naming both in "Psyche" and in this ode (pp. 202, 219-20) but sees these as modifications of the traditional hymn-forms.</page><page sequence="13">PHIDIAN LORE IN KEATS 85 gracefully to escape all critical conceptualizations: it fits neither Schlegel's oxymoronic and synthetic model for the consciousness nor Fletcher's suggestion of metonymic chaos in a profane world. Temporal sequence in the poem is so ordered in its inexorability that it can absorb without abrupt break the various human processions and rituals of all the other odes. Finally, it suspends all questions about immortality: faced neither with goddess nor with the explicit concept of a temporal season, the poet can leave open the question of cyclic return or finality for those voices, that music, which now includes his own. And yet, though "To Autumn" is magnificent in its ambiguous fi nality, I do not want to conclude with it. Instead, I want to point back toward Keats's phrase in the title of this essay. For though these "alle gorical" odes may seem to reject a Phidian consciousness both for the speaker and for his personifications, once intellectually recognized, I would argue that they offer instead a Phidian lore?a sometimes an guished wakefulness that attempts to reconcile its conceptual and philo sophical knowledge with the felt images of a longed-for sculptural, mythic, and unself-conscious wholeness of the human, the artificial, and the natural. Thus the odes are acutely aware of their figuring-forth as art. University of Tennessee</page></plain_text>
