Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972. xvi, 342 pp.</page><page sequence="2">306 AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW In all Ethiopia no culture makes such an immediate impression on the outside observer as the Konso of Gemu-Gofa, in the southwestern corner of Ethiopia. The ccanpact, nucleated villages of the Konso, situated atop beautifully terraced hills, are unique in Ethiopia. Their hnmes, men's houses, walls, and wells are made of neatly worked stone; paths and clearings for ritual are well cared for; and the towns and their sur- roundings are marked by standing stones commemorating battles and by clusters of remarkable anthropomorphic wooden grave figures with intense and terrifying faces. The Ethiopianist accustcned to seeing individual hamlets spread over the countryside and never seeing sculpture at all has an immediate impression of the singularity of Konso. Now C. R. Hallpike has produced the first full-length social anthropological study of the Konso, based on two years of field work, and removed that impression. Beneath their "megalithic" facade the Konso seem to be chips off the same old Cushitic block as the rest of the people of southernEthiopia--although the author himself doesn't seem aware of the extent to which this is true. The Konso, as portrayed by Hallpike, partake of most of the key institutions and culture complexes noted among the Eastern Cushitic- speaking peoples of Ethiopia (of which the Konso are one, being linguis- tically very closely related to the Galla). Despite their special settle- ment pattern the Konso share with the other peoples of their area such things as the system of markets, "generation grades," political councils and elected officers, "universalism" in group affairs (rather than the "particularism" of descent and kinship ties), caste-like organization of craft specialization, lineage priests who act as priests and anointers rather than as shamans, many specific aspects of ritual and belief, taboo and prayer, and even such values--which are at the center of Hallpike's interest--as those stressing peace, sociability, individuality, seniority and masculinity. Hallpike gives us the information to put the Konso in the per- spective of the cnmparative ethnography of the Cushites, although he tries to explain most aspects of their culture with reference to Konso alone, as though it were sui generis with them. This is a major weakness of the book and it follows, in part, fram the author's theoretical approach. Aside from an ethnographic contribution, Hallpike's work also rep- resents a skirmish in the current struggle of British anthropologists to modify or free themselves from the structural-functional/organic model derived from Radcliffe-Brown. Hallpike rejects the organic analogy in favor of a stress on values which he sees as the rules of the game by which players in society interact and as "partially (explaining) the forms their institutions have taken, and in sane cases the very existence of these institutions" (p. 17). While I am sympathetic to the rebellion and believe Hallpike's stress on values has considerable merit and use- fulness, his Konso-centric viewpoint leads him to search for explanations of all Konso belief and social structure in terms of the values of the Konso, often with unparsimonious and unsatisfactory results. While denying the coherence and lack of contradiction in social systems stressed by the Radcliffe-Brownians, Hallpike strives to find logic and consistency</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 307 in the ideas and institutions of the Konso based on his extrapolation of their core values. For example, the author attempts to explain the pariah status of Konso craftsmen (smiths,weavers, potters, tanners) by reference to their alleged stinginess and quarrelscneness, their unsettledness (for they must often move in search of custcmers), or on the grounds that they work with cotton ("an inauspicious substance for the Konso") or fire ("regarded with aversion on most occasions as a hostile and destructive force"), and so forth (p. 143). And yet this line of reasoning totally ignores the fact that the status and treatment of craftsmen in Konso is typical for all of Ethiopia, among almost one hundred different peoples. In such a situation an ad hoc Konso-specific explanation is hardly warranted. In his introduction and elsewhere Hallpike argues that "values must be taken as 'given,' in the sense that one cannot go behind them and ask, for example, why the Konso should place such emphasis on peace, or virility" (p. 17). To some extent this may be true. Greater attention to the literature on the peoples of Ethiopia might have suggested that this manner of handling craft specialization is in fact one of those basic ideas or values whose origins are no longer recoverable but which act as "givens" in the social life of the peoples of Ethiopia. (Hallpike follows his own advice, however, regarding the explanation for the nucleated settlement pattern of the Konso. On p. 35 he argues, I believe quite rightly, that it is "an idea of how to live" and eschews that old expla- nation of last resort, "it is for defensive reasons.") Of particular interest for the comparative study of the Cushitic- speaking peoples is Hallpike's description of Konso social structure. The Konso are represented as a people who stress residence over heredity, neighborliness over kinship, sociability, mutual assistance and voluntary association in cnmmunity and economic affairs, "republican" principles of election and debate in councils for community political affairs, free- hold land tenure, egalitarianism, yet the acceptance of individual achievement and success. In my own work I described the same general pattern for two quite different Galla groups, and there seems to be growing evidence that variations of these themes are to be found quite widely among the Cushitic-speaking peoples. (Cf. the accounts by E. H. Winter of the Iraqw of Tanzania and by U. Almagor of the D'assanech of the Lake Rudolf area). If this is the case, futute writing on Northeast Africa should show an awareness of these patterns of social structure just as work in other areas of Africa has required attention to "segmen- tary kinship systems" and work in Oceania involves awareness of "non- unilineal descent systems." Despite reservations about same of the author's analyses, this book must be recammended as a valuable addition to the Ethiopian ethno- graphic record. It is based on excellent field work and is very well written. It should be read by an anthropologist concerned with Ethiopia. Herbert S.
