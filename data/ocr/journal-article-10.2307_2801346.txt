<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ART OF WAR: WOLA SHIELD DESIGNS PAUL SILLITOE University of Manchester Why do the Wola Highlanders of Papua New Guinea decorate their war shields? After describing the various kinds of shield they use (two made of bark and two of solid wood), an attempt is made to answer this question by first looking at the abstract designs put on these weapons (which reach their ultimate abstraction in a wooden cross). The statements of some informants establish a connexion between these and the anthropomorphic designs painted on other shields. In a sense they are 'men'. The establishment of this anthropomorphic theme in all designs leads to a possible explanation for them, related to the revenge obligation, which occurs throughout Melanesia. The shield designs, both man-like and abstract, contain a revenge 'message'. This use of structuralist ideas relating to communication offers a stimulating alternative for the study of material culture, although the assumptions about the unconscious present problems. Why do Wola warriors put a diagonal cross of two sticks on the top of some of their war shields? These serve no practical purpose but men insist they are necessary. Yet, when asked why, they maintain that there is no reason. To find the logic behind this enigmatic cross, this article traces a connexion between it and other designs which the Wola Highlanders put on their shields. The Highlanders of Papua New Guinea are well known for the sparseness of the decoration applied to material objects' (in contrast to the way they decorate themselves-see Strathern &amp; Strathern I97I; Ebin I979), but their shields are an exception. This suggests that shield decoration serves an important purpose of some kind. Working on this assumption, a hypothesis is developed which explains not only the shield designs of the Wola, and their curious wooden cross, but possibly could account for other Melanesian shield designs as well. Although they are unable to explain in words why they put wooden crosses on their shields, the Wola are not following slavishly some custom that is entirely pointless. On a theoretical level it is assumed that the designs which these people put on their war shields are 'saying' something to them. But the difficulty with a wordless code is to locate the meaning behind the communicative acts. The people concerned can understand the message in shield-code only; they are unable to verbalise it. So what is the validity of any attempt to put it into words (and foreign words and categories, at that)? Even if partially successful, there will inevitably be some degradation and distortion of the meaning.2 Man (N.S.) I5, 48 3-501</page><page sequence="2">484 PAUL SILLITOE Any empirical account trying to use structural principles must attempt to bridge this gap. The idea that people communicate with one another not only in those aspects of behaviour commonly associated with this (for example, in speaking) but also in others (such as designs on objects) has become fashionable with the advent of structuralism. Yet there is a conceptual gulf between the abstract and unconscious universal model used by structuralists and those ideas grounded in the reality of one society used by structural-functionalists.3 Is there a 'functional-structuralism'?, that is, an approach which utilises satisfactorily the insights of the Franco-structural model at an Anglo- ethnographic level. Or is the step to the unconscious level at which non-verbal communication operates essentially too speculative for an empiricist to make with conviction? This discussion of shield designs probes this difficult issue without pretending to resolve it. Wola shields The Wola occupy four valleys in the rugged mountains of the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea and lead a life similar to others elsewhere in this region. They are shifting cultivators whose staple crop is sweet potato, supplemented with a variety of other crops (taro, bananas, sugar cane and various greens). Men do the initial heavy garden work of clearing and fencing, and women the later routine work of breaking up the soil and planting. Men live with their wives and children close to their gardens, and several related families in the same area constitute permanent named groups. Settlement is scattered, with men occupying separate houses from their womenfolk, young children and pigs. Women care for the pigs, which are an important item of wealth. Other valuables include pearl and cowrie shells, crude salt, birds' feathers, and a thick oil extracted from trees and used as a cosmetic. The exchange of these wealth items on prescribed occasions (such as at marriage, after a death, and in reparation to the relatives of allies killed in war) is an important part of Wola life. Indeed, as I understand the constitution of their society it is the ceremonial exchange of wealth that makes it viable (see Sillitoe I979a). It ensures co- operation and orders behaviour, which is otherwise guided only by the potentially disruptive force of self-interest. This truly acephalous society depends on self-regulation, guided by exchange interests, for the daily maintenance of order, bolstered by the pressures which relatives can exert on one another through their social networks. Differences between individuals in Wola society can lead not only to heated arguments as they try to sort an issue out but also to fights if they reach a deadlock. If a death occurs in such a brawl over a dispute, then the relatives of the deceased are obliged to exact revenge on the killer and his relatives. The result is a war, in which the principal protagonists can look to their relatives and friends for support. Such a war may drag on for several months, men fighting both pitched battles and waylaying one another in ambushes.</page><page sequence="3">PAUL SILLITOE 485 When fighting wars, men carry shields with which to protect themselves from the arrows and spears of the enemy. The Wola make four kinds of shield, two from sheets of bark and two from solid pieces of wood. I asked the Wola to make me a shield of each type, using both stone and steel tools, and the following are my observations on their manufacture. Bark shields. The raw materials required here are a sheet of bark from a suitable tree, the aerial root of a screw palm from which to split battens, and a length of rattan to supply thongs for lashing the shield together. Men look for a tough and fibrous bark which will not split easily, even when hit by a sharp projectile such as an arrow, and they say that the bark of only two trees4 is really suitable. Once they have found one of these trees with a suitable girth, they proceed to remove a sheet of bark by first making two ring cuts around it through to the cambium layer, about two metres apart. Then they join these up with a vertical cut and peel off the sheet by 'opening it out' along the vertical cut with sharpened slithers of wood knocked in between it and the inner wood of the tree. When a shield-maker returns from the forest with his raw materials his first task is to cut the bark sheet to the required size and then run it through the flames of a fire. The Wola say this softens it so that they can flatten it out, the untreated sheet having a natural tendency to curl up as it grew round the tree. They also say that the heating process drives out the sap, which is responsible for its sponginess when green, and so makes it stronger. A man will walk on the heated bark sheet to flatten it and then place some heavy objects on it (such as stones or logs) to hold it flat. It is customary to leave it under these weights for a few days. The stages in the production of a bark shield then differ according to the style a man intends to make, as table i shows. This table lists the steps followed when making the two types of bark shield, and the time it took to complete each stage with either stone tools only or steel ones. When making what the Wola call a tiril saebort shield (figure (iA)), a man folds the bark sheet (measuring about 2m X I 5m) lengthwise in two. It is immaterial whether the outside of the bark or the inner cambium layer face outwards. He secures the sheet by sewing it together with rattan strands in three or four places down either long edge (boring the holes with a steel knife or with a rough flint tool followed by a sharpened wooden pin to enlarge them). Next he places along either side of the open top edge a batten split from the aerial root of a screw palm and sews this in place in the same fashion with a length of rattan. Finally he attaches a handle, which consists of a length of rattan knotted through holes made on either edge of the centre of the shield. He carries the finished shield by slinging it on his shoulder, so leaving both hands free to draw a bow and arrow. Wola do not decorate the face of these shields in any way, which makes them the only one of the four types to which they add no design. On the face of the other type of bark shield, described below, they put the puzzling cross of wood, which is a meagre design. Indeed, it is debatable whether this can be legitimately referred to as a design. Why this absence or paucity of decoration</page><page sequence="4">486 PAUL SILLITOE applied to bark shields? One probable reason is the speed with which men can make these shields, together with their short life. Men can run them up quickly at the outbreak of hostilities in which they become embroiled, if they do not have a solid wood shield to hand from a previous war (a comparison of the times recorded in table I for the making of bark shields, with those in table 2 for solid wood shields shows that they take only about a third of the time). This also makes them popular, and in any battle more men will carry them than wooden ones. Following the cessation of hostilities men discard these shields, whereas they keep wooden ones, because the bark soon dries out and loses its fibrous quality so that arrows can penetrate it. Such temporary makeshift weapons hardly warrant the decoration applied to better ones. The other kind of bark shield Wola call a hwimb saebort, (figure (i B)). They make this from a single unfolded sheet (about I -m long x o-Sm wide) which they render firm and serviceable by sewing to it with rattan strands a number of battens, again split from the aerial roots of a screw palm (Wola say that they TABLE i.

They sew pairs of battens down the two long edges of the bark sheet (one on the front, the other on the rear), and in the same fashion sew pairs of short battens along the top and bottom. On the rear of the shield they sew a further three or four short battens across the width of the bark sheet to give it a firm frame, and to these lash a long batten running down the centre which serves as the handle. A warrior carries this shield by grasping it in one hand. This leaves him with only one hand free, and for this reason men fighting with spears tend to use them. They prefer these shields to have a bowed shape longitudinally, and to achieve this they lean them before use against a bank or the eaves of a house and place a heavy log in the centre. It is on these shields that the enigmatic diagonal cross occurs. Men put this at the top of the outside face and make it from two wooden slithers split from the same aerial root as the other battens. They do not secure the cross by sewing with rattan strands, but by jamming it under the shield's top batten, with another across the face to secure it. Quite clearly, jammed in this fashion on the face of the shield, the cross serves no utilitarian function in its construction and without it the shield would be no less serviceable. But the Wola insist that a shield without this cross is incomplete. They call it the nay waip (lit: mouth or food pattern), and they agree that it has no practical usefulness. When asked why, therefore, a shield is incomplete without it, they shrug their shoulders and say that it is 'bahamay' (lit: nothing). Persistent prodding and questioning can induce no-one to reflect any further; it is, everyone insists, nothing. But how can it be nothing when a shield is incomplete without it? Clearly, to ask the Wola to reflect on the meaning of the cross and explain it in words is to ask them the wrong question. They do not appear to think of the thing in this way. In this situation, how can outsiders, socialised according to a different cultural code, find out what the cross is 'saying' to the Wola? Fortunately, these people paint designs on other war shields which allow us to secure some kind of a cognitive hold on the puzzling diagonal cross. However, before discussing this decoration, the clue it gives to the meaning of the cross, and the wider theoretical problems which its interpretation raises, there follows a brief description of how the Wola make and use the other two kinds of shield concerned, both hewed from solid pieces of wood.5 Wooden shields. These two shields differ in size and shape, but are made in much the same way (refer to figures (iC) and (iD)). The larger, oval shield Wola call a watumbiy or kolkol, and the smaller, oval one (with a U-shaped section cut out of it at the top) they call a saemowgwaenk. This latter has a more limited distribution than the others, occurring in the Nembi valley and those to the east but not in the river valleys to the west.6 Only the wood of certain trees is suitable for these shields.7 These grow trunks wide enough to provide a slab the required size, and they have a straight grain which splits true and not crooked, which would be useless to produce the desired plank-like finished artefact. Also, very importantly, the wood of these trees is hard and strong, and can withstand heavy blows without splitting. The cost is a dense wood, giving a heavy weapon which slows a warrior down somewhat.</page><page sequence="7">PAUL SILLITOE 489 When making one of these shields, men like to find a tree with a large flying buttress because cutting the plank from this involves less hard work than felling and splitting a whole trunk. Table 2 shows the steps followed in making these shields and the time taken to complete each using stone and steel tools (none was cut from a flying buttress).8 Men do all the shaping they can while the wood remains attached to the parent tree because this holds it firmly for them (once it is detached they have the awkward task of holding the shield- sized piece with one hand, while chopping with the other). Men simply hew these shields with an axe, rough them out initially and then work them more closely and carefully to produce the finished artefact. Today they can achieve a smooth enough finish using a steel axe only, whereas previously stone hewn shields were too rough and men ran them through the flames of a fire to scorch off their roughness and scraped them smoother with a flint tool. The ideal shield has a slightly convex outer surface and concave inner one, although many are simply flat. The handle of a saemowgwaenk shield consists of a plaited length of rattan suspended from holes bored in the two 'horns' of the U-shaped apex. A man carries this shield by pushing an arm through the U-shaped hole until this rattan binding rests on his shoulder, so that the shield hangs under his armpit and protects his flank. The handle of the watumbiy shield consists of a rattan or vine sling across the middle of the rear, secured through two holes into which it is knotted. This shield is slung from the shoulder, and it protects the head, flank and upper legs. Indeed a man can place the foot of the bigger shields on the ground (watumbiy vary considerably in size, from under i m to over Is5 m long) and cower behind in such a way as to protect his entire person.

Wooden shields, unlike bark ones, last for years. In times of peace men keep them above the fire in the gable-roof of their houses, or use them as door slats at night to close the sitting rooms of men's houses, or as beds to sleep on. The men who make such shields own them, but will usually loan them to others to use either in wars in which they themselves are not embroiled or to fight in battles they intend to avoid. All men are capable of making any one of the four kinds of shield described. Shield designs All men are also capable of painting designs on wooden shields.9 This requires no special expertise nor ritual knowledge. Men approach it in a casual fashion, spending about half an hour to complete the task (for example, it took two men fifteen minutes to paint the design on shield number 2 3 in figure 2 (see fig. 3) and one man 30 minutes to paint one similar to that on number 24). A man can paint anything he chooses. Designs do not belong to certain individuals or groups; in no sense are they escutcheons to distinguish warriors in battle. Indeed a man may paint different designs on the same shield at different times, as his fancy takes him. And a person borrowing a shield may either touch up the owner's last design or go over it with a new one of his own. 10 On the other hand a man may not bother to decorate such a shield at all. The Wola paint a range of designs on their shields, a selection of which is reproduced in figure 2.11 Some are anthropomorphic and others are abstract. At one time, the interpretation of the latter abstract designs presented a problem akin to that of the diagonal cross. When asked initially what they represented, men insisted that they were nothing. They were bahamay like the bark shield's cross. Similarly, when asked why they used one particular abstract design, informants replied that it was simply one of those things. Their replies, so familiar to anthropologists, were 'That's the way we do things' or 'Our ancestors did it like that'.12 But, returning to the topic periodically over several years, together with an ever-improving appreciation of Wola life, I eventually induced some men to reflect on these designs. An important methodological point here is that only a few would do this; others insisted continually that the abstract designs represented nothing (their response to the more imaginative interpretations of the reflective few was: 'Have it so if you like, but I'm unconvinced'). Everyone, including the sceptics, unhesitatingly identified the anthropo- morphic designs as representations of men. The question 'What is that design' always elicited the response 'A man'. But the same question asked of an entire abstract design always elicited the response of'Nothing'. It was not until they were asked to identify elements, rather than the entire design, that the imaginative ones gave replies linking them to the man-like designs.13 So, while these abstract designs taken as wholes are not men like the anthropomorphic ones, they contain distorted human elements which give them a man-like quality in some sense.</page><page sequence="9">PAUL SILLITOE 49I c~~~~~~~~~~ E s &gt;, 3 E &gt;.o 4 E uz 3 4 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c- 0 E 43 n c E Y~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .00 .E E c c c1 : , , . 0 w s x__ n E IV 0 E 0 ,0 Io n O</page><page sequence="10">492 PAUL SILLITOE The designs reproduced in figure 2 start with the clearly anthropomorphic ones and run through to the abstract. All the parts identified on them are those pointed out by informants and the sequence of designs traces the transformation of the man-like designs to the abstract ones as the imaginative Wola themselves saw it.14 Tracing this metamorphosis through the eyes of the reflective few is instructive for the way it shows how abstract representations can be understood as transformations of what initially were concrete drawings of things.' 5 Reference to figure 2 illustrates how this transformation takes place. Designs are clearly anthropomorphic up to number i i which, as a man superimpQsed on a partial abstract design, is the first to show signs of change. The next, number I2, has unmistakable anthropomorphic elements arranged in an interesting way. It has a horizontal band across the middle of the shield, and the mirror-like repetition of the same design either side of it, both of which features characterise abstract designs. Design I3 carries the transformation further with a man-like drawing above the central band and an abstract one below it. Interestingly, the painter of this design verbally equated the orange area demarcated by the curved lines of the head and arms with the corresponding orange area in the abstract design (both areas are marked X in the figure). Design X 5 carries the metamorphosis into the abstract category, but retains elements (notably a face) which link it to the earlier anthropomorphic designs. Its four curved lines correspond to those marked X on the previous one. From shield i 6 the designs become entirely abstract, but on these too the imaginative FIGURE 3. Painting an abstract design (notice the men's wide bark belts which figure prominently on the central motif in these designs).</page><page sequence="11">PAUL SILLITOE 493 equated the curved lines (marked X on 2 I) with arms and legs, and the central band with the wide bark belt worn by Wola men.16 The man-like design in solid black shown in figure 4, with an abstract design in stipples superimposed on it, demonstrates the correspondence between each of the parts distinguished by the Wola and how the former acts as a template for the transformation to the latter. Shields I9 and 27 in figure 2 are interesting variations on the standard abstract theme, the diagonal cross of the latter expanding from that in no. 26. This ultimate reduction to a diagonal cross leads back to the cross on the spear- thrower's bark shield. Does the diagonal nay waip cross correspond to a man? Although no Wola ever made this suggestion, it seems reasonable to make in the light of their other shield designs. The name nay waip, which means the mouth or food pattern, also lends support to this suggestion because the cross, occurring at the top of the shield where the head would be in a full-sized watumbiy design, is of the head but, as a reduction and incomplete, also only a part of it. Possibly the mouth, the organ that devours food, is the apt part of the head to name the cross after because it is a grossly simplified or 'eaten' version of a full anthropomorphic design. Yet this interpretation of the diagonal wooden cross raises some difficult methodological issues. Is it permissible to assume that at some time in the past a man, or several men, consciously decided to put diagonal crosses on bark shields to represent stylised human beings (after the abstract designs they painted on wooden shields), and that with the passage of time people have wig 01 ~~head arms r bark belt knitted apron FG E.nbrthldi pi FiGURE 4. An abstract shield design superimposed on an anthropomorphic one.</page><page sequence="12">494 PAUL SILLITOE forgotten this connexion and simply continue to use the cross because custom prompts them? This is possible, in which event the custom can only be explained by unverifiable historical speculation. But can a custom, the origin and overt meaning of which is lost, continue without serving a function of some kind, or would people cease to follow it? If it cannot continue when entirely redundant, then according to the structuralist argument, things such as the diagonal shield cross presumably have some unconscious element. Although men cannot explain the cross, they perceive of it as a man in some unconscious fashion and it communicates something non-verbal at this level, which ensures its continued use. These comments relate to the point that only a few imaginative individuals interpreted the abstract shield paintings as representations of human beings. Presumably, these designs operate for the others on the same unconscious plane as the diagonal wooden cross does for everyone. This raises questions about the genesis of these non-verbal messages. Where do they come from and does anyone ever consciously think of them?' 7 Did someone long ago specifically think of the wooden cross as a man and so bring it into use as suggested, or was the originator of it not aware of its meaning when he decorated his shield with it and it caught on with everyone because of the unconscious vibrations it generated? If the birth and life of these messages is in the unconscious only, it will be difficult to know when they are cracked properly without paying considerably more attention to the psychological factors presumed to underpin them. But the central question with regard to shield designs remains to be answered: why do the Wola do this and what are they communicating to one another? Why paint shields? People throughout the world use war shields, sometimes with decoration and at others without. The Kukukuku of mid-montane New Guinea, for instance, have shields similar to watumbiy but never decorate them (Blackwood I950). Many of the Aborigines of Australia also used undecorated shields,18 while others incised and painted designs on them linked with the dreamtime and their totems, which they believed gave them supernatural power in a fight. The Plains Indians of north America also believed that their shield designs, revealed to them in visions and ritually painted, gave them supernatural powers and strength (they thought, for instance, that the design of an eagle made them swift and ruthless like this bird-see Hoebel I960; Wildschut I925). Other people decorate their shields to distinguish allies from foes so that they do not slay one another. This was so with the Zulu of South Africa who fought in armies composed of regiments, each of which had its own distinct shield design, in addition to its own headdress and war-cry (Krige I936). The designs on the shields of medieval knights served this purpose too, and also advertised the bearer's martial abilities (Wagner I958). This is another reason for the</page><page sequence="13">PAUL SILLITOE 495 decoration of shields: to announce the achievements of the bearer; some Sepik river peoples in New Guinea use similar homicidal insignia (Bateson I936). A fourth reason for decorating shields is to intimidate and frighten the enemy. Some of the people living in Borneo, for example, put designs of horrific import on their shields because, they said, this unnerved their foe (Hose &amp; McDougall I9I2). When asked why they decorate their shields, the Wola gave this reason too. They said that shield designs frighten and unnerve the enemy. A few added that some insult them too. Design number 3 (figure 2), for instance, showing a male's genitals, both frightens and insults the enemy according to the man who drew it. So does design i o with someone astride another, which is a grossly insulting pose showing the genitals and having connexions with noxious menstrual substances (see Sillitoe Ig79b).19 When asked whom the shield design represents, men gave one of three replies. Some said that they had no idea, that it represented no one. Others replied that it represented themselves standing behind the shield and out to kill those looking upon it, so terrifying them. Others thought that the design represented the enemy's own image thrown back at him like the reflection from a pool of water. The man who drew design number 6 gave this third reply, adding imaginatively that foes firing arrows at him which hit his shield were in effect shooting themselves! The designer of number I4 also said that his design showed the enemy to himself, flinching and shivering with fear from the hail of arrows fired at him (hence the wavy lines, which show him trembling). The absence of any agreement about whom a shield design represents indicates that Wola are not clear why they find it frightening. When asked this, they simply insist that it is intrinsically terrifying. But they admit that they are equally afraid of a man carrying an undecorated shield who is out to kill them, and that a decorated shield alone (propped against a house, for example) strikes fear into no one (unlike the ritual stones in which they believe their malevolent ancestors' spirits dwell, which frighten them as objects alone). It would appear that the Wola say they paint shields to frighten one another because they use them in contexts which frighten them, that their design is a consequence of use. But it is not the design per se that intimidates the enemy and, as men say, makes them retreat and expose their backs to arrows. It is the fact that behind the shield is a warrior out for their blood. This suggests that there is more to these shield designs than the deterministic terror explanation given by the Wola. A possible clue to this deeper level explanation is the fact that all the shield designs relate to a human figure. Why is this so? Why paint a man? Wola cannot answer this question, but they give a clue in the term they use for revenge, the obligation which is central to their warfare. They call revenge ol luwzimb miy (lit: man revenge take). The significant word here is ol or man, for Wola revenge in war is always ol luwzimb or 'man revenge'. They make</page><page sequence="14">496 PAUL SILLITOE it explicit in this phrase that revenge requires a victim. They cannot have revenge without a man upon whom to exact it. Further evidence that the man on the shield is related in some way to the revenge obligation comes from the colour sequence in some of the designs. On the whole men use colours randomly.20 The Wola say that a shield owner is free to use whatever colour combination he chooses, and the designs reproduced here revealing no detectable pattern, bear out this claim. But the men who painted designs S and 22 said that they changed their colour schemes according to whether their side was the last to kill or not. If they killed last their colour schemes were as shown. But if they had lost a man last, then they changed the colouring as follows: the painter of design S changed his figure from red to white, while that of design 22 replaced the red of the central motif with white. They both explained that women daub their bodies with white clay when in mourning for a deceased relative, and that the change in their shield colouring paralleled this mourning decoration.21 They said this indicated to those who saw the shield that they were in mourning and had a revenge debt to pay, that they were out to kill one of the enemy to redress the balance. This evidence suggests that the Wola are receiving unconsciously some message from the 'man' design, over and above the one they verbalise about frightening the foe and making them easier to kill. After all, if their aim is to frighten and disgust, why do they stick to realistic and abstract man-like designs? There are more frightening things than men, such as malicious forest spirits, malevolent ancestral ghosts and repugnant female genitalia. But they paint men only, who, as the foe, are the targets for revenge.22 Can it be that shield designs, from the anthropomorphic through to the crude cross, signal on some unconscious plane that men must seek revenge, so reinforcing their observation of this all-important obligation? The obligation to seek revenge on the killer of a relative is, as I understand the Wola social order (Sillitoe I979a: 75-8), central to their whole constitution. It keeps power labile and out of men's reach by prompting a group response from a number of individuals against anyone who mortally wrongs someone. If men ceased to heed this obligation, their society would collapse. Strong individuals would be able to gain power over others and exploit them, because, without men heeding their revenge obligations, they would face no organised resistance. It is vital therefore that men observe their revenge obligations, and seeing men on shields is one way in which their resolve to secure revenge is reinforced. They must avenge that man on the shield, be he realistically portrayed or in abstract, and turn him from mourning white to killer red. The frightening man on the opposing shield must be knocked down and killed. The fact that many of the arrows fired in any encounter hit shields (several have tips embedded in them) serves to stimulate this message. These arrows 'kill' the design, as warriors are out to kill someone in revenge. The design may depict the enemy, reflected Medusa-like on the shield, fulfilling the bearer's revenge obligations by 'killing' himself, or it may be the bearer, who is stimulated to exact revenge by the 'wounds' he receives. This argument gains credibility when it is remembered that Wola society</page><page sequence="15">PAUL SILLITOE 497 is pre-literate, with no written laws or rules laying down how people should behave, nor, being entirely acephalous, any offices, whose incumbents could enforce observance if they did exist. In such societies there must be other forces to prompt people to behave as they ought and observe their social obligations, as shield designs prompt the Wola to heed their revenge obligations. In a pre- literate society too, graphic representations will be of a different order from those seen in literate traditions, their uncommonness ensuring a different effect on those who see them. So a simple shield design can have a powerful effect. This explanation also accounts for the absence of decoration on some wooden shields and all the tiril saebort bark variety. It is only necessary for some shields to carry the revenge-nudging design to ensure that men receive its message. Anthropomorphic shield designs are not unique to the Wola. They occur throughout Melanesia. For instance: in the Gulf of Papua (Wingert i965: 226)23; throughout the Sepik region (Firth I936: 99; Haberland i963; i965); in the Mendi valley of the Highlands (Ryan I958: 245-624); and on the Solomon Islands, where pearl shell pieces were set in resin on basketry frames (British Museum Exhibition I979). Also, throughout the Melanesian region, abstract shield designs occur which are either transformations of human figures or contain anthropomorphic elements. For instance: in the Asmat region of Irian Jaya (see Firth I936: 97)25; in the Hagen region of the Highlands (Strathern &amp; Strathern I97I: I0326); in the Telefomin region (Craig i967: 26927); from the Torricelli mountains over to Green river (G. Lewis pers. comm.28); and on the Trobriand Islands, where the controversial Medusa-like design occurs (Leach I 95 4). True to form however, Papua New Guinea being everything to all men, there are exceptions. While the Kukukuku, for example, never bother to decorate their shields, the Dani of Irian Jaya do not fight with shields at all and the Kapauku only carry a small piece of wood in a string bag hung round the neck. Nonetheless the revenge obligation is a pan-Melanesian phenomenon (Sillitoe I978: 260-4), which suggests that the explanation of Wola shield designs developed above may apply in other regions where people decorate their war shields. To date, the study of shield designs in Papua New Guinea has followed two overlapping approaches. First, the construction of design typologies and the tracing of their geographical occurrence (see Schmidt I929; Haberland i963; i965), and secondly, attempts which follow in Haddon's (i894) footsteps and speculate on the diffusion of patterns from one region to another (see Craig i967; Cranstone i968; Abramson i969). The fact that Craig argues for diffusion into the Highlands from the south coast and Cranstone from the north coast, and Abramson for movements between east and west along the Highlands, indicates the difficulties that attend this approach (in which a single source of evidence, such as shield designs, generates a number of equally plausible arguments). Another common, but limited approach to such cultural phenomena as shield designs is to discuss their aesthetic qualities, their sense of balance, proportion, symmetry, and so on. But the equation of the rude wooden crosses which the Wola put on some of their shields, with the paintings they put on</page><page sequence="16">498 PAUL SILLITOE others, illustrates how an outsider's aesthetic appreciation of another culture's 'art' may be a subjective and ethnocentric distortion of the indigenous view.29 The paintings which the Wola put on their shields we would label as art, but not the wooden crosses. So the category we gloss as art is presumably something different from that held by the Wola because for them the cross is a design of some sort which relates to their paintings.30 Structuralism offers an alternative approach, although similar problems plague its attempts to translate visual messages, as on shield designs, into words. Just how valid are structuralist assumptions about the step required to the unconscious? It is this step which empiricists find difficult to make with conviction, and without a more sophisticated understanding of the processes involved structuralist interpretations will continue to look like figments of the investigators' imaginations. How are we to check, for example, the relative validities of several different possible interpretations, when their subject is non- verbal communication? One way is to argue that several different messages may be communicated by the same thing or event, but this amounts to little. So even though current psychological theories strike some anthropologists as no more than crude hunches (Leach I976: 96), they demand urgent consideration, otherwise the acceptance of structuralist interpretations remains an act of faith (similar to belief in an unverifiable religious dogma, to which Leach (I976: 70) argues 'the rules of ordinary logic do not apply'!). Even after its worrisome step into the unconscious, one persuasive feature of the above interpretation of Wola shield designs is the way it relates them to the social order.31 It is here, in the society, that fieldwork-rooted empiricists, schooled in the structural-functional tradition deriving from Durkheim's sociology, ground much of their work. But the Wola, like others, are unable to put the constitution of their society into words; they simply lead their lives according to its norms. It is little wonder therefore, that they are not consciously aware of a shield design's revenge message: all they can say is that it frightens them and that they must take revenge. The message's rationale is located within their society in general and beyond their conscious understand- ing. So a review of psychological assumptions is needed to validate not only the use of structuralist principles at an ethnographic level, but also the empiricists' social reality, which in a sense is imaginary for the actor. NOTES I presented this paper in a symposium entitled 'Material Culture as Communication' at Darwin College, Cambridge and in seminars at Manchester University and the Museum of Mankind, and I thank all participants for their constructive criticisms. I also thank my wife Jackie for help with the diagrams and for incisive comments on the argument. 1 Comments such as the following of Blackwood's (1950: 56) are common: 'The most surprising, and to an ethnologist most disappointing feature of Kukukuku culture is the almost complete absence of decorative art, especially in woodworking'. 2 Recently a number of writers have drawn attention to this problem (for instance, see Forge I973; Cardew I978; Otten I97I: xiv). 3 Leach (I 976: 3-9) discusses this and labels those on either side as rationalists or empiricists. 4 The Wola call these two trees mashor (Hibiscus sp.) and ol (?). The screw palm from which the aerial roots come they call aenk (Pandanus brosimos) and the rattan haeluwp (Calamus sp.).</page><page sequence="17">PAUL SILLITOE 499 SI have deposited examples of all the four kinds of shield described here in the following museums: Museum of Mankind (London), University Museum of Ethnology and Archaeology (Cambridge), and the Pitt-Rivers Museum (Oxford). 6 In the Was river valley to the west, where I did my fieldwork, many men claimed that they were not sure how saemowgwaenk were made, their only knowledge of them coming from seeing Nembi valley men carrying them in battles. 7 Men listed the following seven trees as suitable: haezuwmb (Galbulimima belgraveana). huwgiyt (?), maip (Scluzomeria sp.), pel (Nothofagus grandis), piyp (Syzygium sp.), schwimb (Elaeocarpus sp.), and wat (?). 8 Flying buttresses of a suitable size and wood are not common; for example a man searching for 6 hours and 8 minutes found only one large enough to make a single shield (wishing to record stone and steel tools used under the same conditions I vetoed its use and had a suitable tree felled, on each half of the trunk of which stone and steel tools were used). 9 An act which the Wola call watumbiy paeziyay. IO People living in the Nembi and Was valleys, unlike those living in the Mendi valley (Ryan I 95 8: 247), rarely incise the outlines of designs on their shields. They simply paint, which gives them more scope to change designs (although Ryan observed palimpsests where men had incised a second design over an almost erased earlier one). This contrasts with some regions of New Guinea where people carve very elaborate fixed designs on their shields (for example in the Telefomin area, parts of the Sepik, and in the Papuan Gulf). I I The designs, collected in the Was valley, were painted by the following men: i. Maenget Hiyp, 2. Hoboga Lem, 3. Wenja Puwn, 4. Haenda Mauway, S. Mayka Saziy, 6. Haenda Pobowgab, 7. Haenda Mat, 8. Henep Lem, 9. Maenget Tensgay, I O. Homol Oliy, i i. Huwlael Lem, I 2. Kal Meb, I 3. Maenget Saendaep, I 4. Ind Ongol, I 5. Puwgael E'row, I 6. Ind Kelow, I 7. Piywa Haegaes, i 8. Ind Yaera, i 9. Puwgael E'row, 20. Silol Luwn, 2 I. Ind Kayshya, 22. Ind Pis, 23. Maenget Korobol, 24. Maenget Kem, 25. Mayka Kot, 26. Wenja Unguwdiyp, 27. Huwlael Em, 28. Kolomb Hond, 29. Kolomb Pet, 30. Kolba Honol, 3 I. Nembi valley man. 12 'Ngubiy bayom' (lit: 'so we do') and 'shumbaen bismiyup' (lit: 'ancestors did so'). Ryan (I 95 8: 248) notes that the Mendi people gave similar replies when questioned about their shield designs. 1 Craig (I967: 267) and Cranstone (I968: 6I8) found the same thing with the Telefolmin. 14 Some of these were the designers themselves and some were not. This is a Wola-centric interpretation of their transformation. I scrupulously tried to avoid giving leading questions and had no preconceptions myself about the meaning of the abstract designs (their anthropomorphic nature came as much as a surprise to me as the sceptics). 15 Forge (I 973: I 83) notes that, like Wola shield designs, the anthropomorphic and abstract designs of the Abelam cannot be separated by a line; they flow one into the other. 16 Besides the human features discussed, some men identified the hour-glass shape in the centre of the abstract design as a drum. No Wola has ever equated the shape of a drum with a man to me, but people elsewhere in Melanesia have done so explicitly by carving faces and other anatomical features on them (for example, see Firth I936: io6; Dark I973: 6i). 17 This question relates to Levi-Strauss's (i 966: I 6-22) concept of the bricoleur, which raises a number of such queries for an empiricist. 18 Interestingly, the plain and stout parry shield of the Aborigines also occurs in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea (see Aufenanger I957). 19 Another possible reason for shield designs, which no one suggested, is that they make the bearer a more elusive target. Some colours stand out, while others recede, thus producing a blurred effect that might confuse the enemy's aim (I am grateful to M.D. McLeod for pointing this out). 20 The pigments used are powdered charcoal, or juice squeezed from the fruits of the nemb tree (Combretaceae), for black, white clay for white, orange clay for orange, and fired orange clay for red ochre. 21 See Sillitoe I 979a: pl. I 4. 22 The vast majority of war casualties are male. Occasionally women and children are killed too, but men are the principal targets for revenge. 23 See Newton (I963) who discusses how the anthropomorphic designs on the ritual gope boards of this region (which are the same as those on shields) become more abstract. 24 Ryan (i958: 248) suggests that the abstract designs in this area are formalisations of the anthropomorphic ones. 25 It is noteworthy that the Asmat explicitly state that they carve human figures on long poles to remind them of their revenge obligations (see Gerbrands I967). 26 They list features distinguished by the Hageners (such as the navel), and also say that they</page><page sequence="18">500 PAUL SILLITOE put plumes on the 'head' of a shield, as warriors wear them in their hair. The Mendi people do the same thing (Ryan 1958: 247). The abstract designs found in these two regions are similar too; a similarity which appears to extend to the Jimi valley and the Eastern Highlands (see the desi ns reproduced in Abramson I969: 62). 2 Craig (i 967: 269) postulates that the diagonal cross design (which occurs on both the houseboards and shields of the Telefolmin) developed from a human figure (although Cranstone I 968: 6 I 8 is dubious). 28 This diagonal cross design (reproduced as a motif at the head of each chapter in Lewis I 980) is similar to that of the Telefolmin people, and like theirs originates from a human figure. 29 See Leach's (I973) interesting argument that the limited cross-cultural appreciation of art that is possible has a physiological basis. 30 So far as I know the Wola have no word equivalent to our 'art', although this is not to say that the concept is absent. 31 Firth (I936), in an early study of New Guinea art, argued that it must be related to the society concerned, and this is a sine qua non now of any empirical anthropological study of art (and any structuralist one too according to Leach I 976: 49).
