<plain_text><page sequence="1">Larkín's conceit PETER SNOWDON 'I made twentieth-century poetry sound nice. That's quite an achievement in itself.'1 What will remain of Philip Larkin? The publication in 1988 of the Collected Poems2 has gathered around it an almost unprecedented spectacle of eulogy drawn from throughout the English-speaking world. From New York to Northern Ireland, Larkin is the greatest post-war poet in the English language. Those who dissent, however slightly, do so within a context of certain praise: the achievement is assured, though occasional (and probably 'irrelevant') details may be open to well-mannered dispute. Surrounded by such a uniformity of admiration, it would be ungracious, not to say superfluous, to show concern for a destiny which the gods of criticism would appear to have so carefully nurtured.3 And yet, if we stand back for a moment, concern must surely strike us as the proper response: for how did English poetry get this way, that Larkin should shine out as the one star in the barren modernist firmament? By what unnatural alliance of ideology and the popular taste can a poetry that eschews commitment and cultivates in its place envy and distance come to be held up as an example of that art which is most committed to its own possibilities and to the deepest concerns of its readers? In the most extravagant contribution to be made to the recent collections of encomia, Stephen Watson writing in Encounter A presents us with just such a Larkin: Larkin, Laureate of the Imagination and Defender of the Poetic Faith, whose pyrrhic victory over the hordes of criticism is the only consolation poetry has left to offer us, now and in England. Although Watson's Manichaean vision chooses to theologise itself in extreme terms, its presuppositions are common to the majority of Larkin's admirers: The poet's greatest, even immemorial, task has been to make the real real, to create a verbal artefact which closes the gap between language and reality. But the literary theoretician's essential gesture has been to do nothing so much as to prise open that gap once again, to make the relationship dissonant, and to make it speak that dissonance rather than the ecstasy of at-oneness.5 Watson makes his case simply and forcefully, but how are we to recognise in this the Larkin we have read? Larkin against Lacan, Derrida and Clark Coolidge: certainly. But Larkin as the apostle of at-oneness, of à world reconciled to itself, of a language equal to the severest challenges of fulfilment and happiness? Larkin, whose God was Hardy, yet whose prophets turn out to be, in this new gospel, Seferis, Paz, Montale? After all, we all know what he thought about fulfilment- unless we have been © C.Q. &amp; S. 1991</page><page sequence="2">62 Critical Survey, Volume 3, Number 1 deceived. But there is perhaps room left for some other form of epiphany? Well, no, as the poet might have said: for those who were not listening earlier, let me recapitulate: All I remember is The horseman, the moonlit hedges, The hoofbeats shut suddenly in the yard, The hand finding the door unbarred: And I recall the room where I was brought, Hung black and candlelit; a sort Of meal laid out in mockery; for though His place was set, there was no more Than one unpolished pewter dish, that bore The battered carcase of a carrion crow. So every journey that I make Leads me, as in the story he was led, To some new ambush, to some fresh mistake: So every journey I begin foretells A weariness of daybreak, spread With carrion kisses, carrion farewells.6 This is not yet the standard Larkin persona, or as Watson has it, 'the unique individual tone of voice which is the mark of a major poet',7 and which the later Larkin possesses in something of the same sense that Frankie Howerd or Kenneth Williams do. But it contains already a message that will later become a method. All life here is predetermined by literature. For the speaker, experience falls fatalistically into the destructive pattern set by a particular story. He is as if fascinated by the doom that hangs over him; and the very possibility of experience, and so of that literature which Watson praises and which requires of the poet an open, vulnerable response to experience, is denied in a pre-emptive strike against one's own possibilities. Of course, here this tendency for the corrosive fluids of a single negative event to seep out into a wider landscape, depriving it of all vistas save that of egotistic pessimism, is still confined within a single life. But the major shift in Larkin's development, between The North Ship and The Less Deceived, is not from Yeats to Hardy, as the theory he later constructed would have us believe. It is from the confinement of an irrational a priori conviction of failure within the individual psyche of the poet, to the use of attitude, mimicry, and direct aggression to bludgeon the reader into accepting this attitude as a universal necessity, and one which, in the end, there is no real point in trying to transcend. The North Ship is, as Larkin himself was all too aware, an exercise in derivation. But this is partly why it is, now, easier to like than the verse that followed it. For it is possible to see the knee-jerk submission before a negative image of 'reality' as simply one of the topoi that bewitched the author, and something that an increasing engage- ment with language and with his own experience would help him to throw off. When he writes that:</page><page sequence="3">Lar kin's conceit 63 This is the first thing I have understood: Time is the echo of an axe Within a wood it is possible to think that this is also the first thing he has copied,8 that the transcrip- tion is more than competent, and that with time he may begin to find something to say and a way to say it. In a poem like 'Nursery Tale', the solipsistic pessimism has a lightness, an inauthenticity, that is not simply due to its literary predictability; it is also to do with the rhythm of the verse, the precision of the lyric gestures of understate- ment, which cannot be reduced to a dying fall, even should the poem end with one. There is a talent here which knows something different from what it chooses to say, and in that possibility of a different choice lies much of the collection's promise. Larkin, however, knew something different again. And so it was that in the poetry that was to follow up to the end of his life, he chose not to eliminate from his work all that was inauthentic in his attachment to Yeats, but to cling to the fact of inauthenti- city as a sort of 'truth': the sort which allows one to delay indefinitely all the real choices and actions that the writing of poetry entails. To see the transformation of this personal existential conviction into a poetic method that will enmesh the reader in an attitude that brooks no criticism, we have only to turn to the first poem in The Less Deceived , which may stand as a programme for almost all that is to come. In 'Lines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album' {Collected Poems , pp. 71-2), Larkin establishes a means of structuring a poem's images whose aim is precisely to open a chasm between the self's language and the world, and to inscribe a cynical dissonance at the heart of our emotional experience: At last you yielded up the album, which, Once open, sent me distracted. All your ages Matt and glossy on the thick black pages! Too much confectionery, too rich: I choke on such nutritious images. My swivel eye hungers from pose to pose- In pigtails, clutching a reluctant cat; Or furred yourself, a sweet girl-graduate; Or lifting a heavy-headed rose Beneath a trellis, or in a trilby hat (Faintly disturbing, that, in several ways) - From every side you strike at my control, Not least through these disquieting chaps who loll At ease about your earlier days: Not quite your class, I'd say, dear, on the whole. But o, photography! as no art is, Faithful and disappointing! that records Dull days as dull, and hold-it smiles as frauds And will not censor blemishes Like washing-liñes, and Hall's-Distemper boards,</page><page sequence="4">64 Critical Survey , Volume 3, Number 1 But shows the cat as disinclined, and shades A chin as double when it is, what grace Your candour thus confers upon her face! How overwhelmingly persuades That this is a real girl in a real place, In every sense empirically true! Or is it just the pasti Those flowers, that gate, These misty parks and motors, lacerate Simply by being over; you Contract my heart by looking out of date. Yes, true; but in the end, surely, we cry Not only at exclusion, but because It leaves us free to cry. We know what was Won't call on us to justify Our grief, however hard we yowl across The gap from eye to page. So I am left To mourn (without a chance of consequence) You, balanced on a bike against a fence; To wonder if you'd spot the theft Of this one of you bathing; to condense, In short, a past that no one now can share, No matter what your future; calm and dry, It holds you like a heaven, and you lie Invariably lovely there, Smaller and clearer as the years go by. The movement that this poem executes is one that will be repeated many times: the poet begins by confronting a reality that presents itself as a bewildering profusion of 'nutritious images'. Unable (or unwilling) to cope with this, he must effect a 'conden- sation' of this material into a form that is emotionally less substantial, but more easily digested by both reader and persona. The first images that strike him suggest a world of sexual activity and desire, in which his relationship to the woman is threatened by the presence of other men: by her entertaining of these presences, even to the usurping of the attributes of masculinity itself (that trilby hat), she is felt to 'strike' at the poet's control. His response is to strike at hers through an apostrophe to the 'art' of photography. Of course, photography is not an art; and that is its value as metaphor for this poem's own processes. For a photograph functions in our culture as a (quite unjustifiable) criterion of truth. By invoking the myth of this objective accuracy, the poet is then able to authorise his own vision of the woman's past. His first move is to replace that sexually intimidating variety with an emblematically banal juxtaposition of banalities ('Like washing-lines, and Hall's-Distemper boards'), which serves also as a pre-emptive judgment on her future domestic fate. Then he can return to her life, and by exhibition, reduce it to a repetition of neutral elements</page><page sequence="5">Lar kin' s conceit 65 ('Those flowers, that gate,/ These misty parks and motors'). These elements are safe; they do not possess their own emotional specificity, but 'lacerate/ Simply by being over'. The poet then proceeds to theorise his own practice; this emotion is not in any way inherent in the experience; it is not even just a natural response to the pastness of the experience. It is our response to the safety of that past. We permit ourselves the response because we know we will not be called upon to 'justify' it, to follow it up with action, with emotional engagement with another person. The mourning the poet desires (that 'we' desire), is 'without consequence'. We are kept immaculate in the cocoon of our sentimentality by that unbridgeable 'gap from page to eye'. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that this loss of agency is brought about by an agent; it is the poet-persona that has effected this 'condensation', and for his own ends. Excluding the 'disquieting chaps' from which he started, he has produced a simple succession of images in which the girl is stranded on her own, isolated from any narrative context, unaware of the poet's invading desires as he meditates the theft of a bathing shot. The product of all this machination is beauty; she has become 'unvari- ably lovely'; but at the same time, the independent ramifications of her life have been gradually faded out, to leave at the end an image without any precise content, which mimes once more the curve of this nostalgic reduction: 'Smaller and clearer as the years go by.' By writing about her, the poet has reduced her life to a pretext for his introverted nostalgia, leaving her reality stranded, and the reader alone with these semi-detached emotions. Of course, one stock response to such an account would be to attribute all these practices to the persona, and see the author as operating at a safe distance from them, regarding them with irony. But the idea of a persona is more difficult to operate than Larkin's admirers realise. For the poem to establish a genuine perspective on the persona, it must establish its own formal procedures as importantly independent of the character it has ensnared in them. But as my analysis shows, the formal pro- cedures of the poem just are those of the persona. The image-structure evoked is clearly manipulated by an intelligence at every point identical with the speaker. And analogous image-structures are repeated throughout Larkin's work, in poems of very different colouring, from the sarcastic, to the archly affecting. In 'Lines' I have tracked the movement from reality as profusion to image as simple pretext. This is how the movement presents itself from the point of view of the reader's narrative perception of the poem. But its logical structure is quite different, as can be seen from a later poem, 'As Bad as a Mile' {Collected Poems, p. 225): Watching the shied core Striking the basket, skidding across the floor, Shows less and less of luck, and more and more Of failure spreading back up the arm Earlier and earlier, the unraised hand calm, The apple unbitten in the palm. This short poem is a perfect diagram of how Larkin's famous 'character', whose</page><page sequence="6">66 Critical Survey, Volume 3, Number 1 principle of action John Bayley has spent some fifteen pages trying to pin down,9 affects the reader. The poet begins from a specific incidence of a chiefly technical failure (inability to deposit a chewed apple in a waste-paper basket at ten feet), and 'watches' this sense of failure spread back through time and space until it becomes a general paralysis of the will to act, and in particular of the will to sensual pleasure and the experience of love (that unbitten apple). This is not simply an intriguing psycho- logical observation; it is a totally irrational movement, that is unsituated by any rendering of experience as form. The only form in the poem is the schematic idea of a reverse causality, resting on a logical error. Just because my ball-manipulation skills are poor, does not mean that there is good reason to abstain from physical love; eating apples, whether literally or metaphorically, and throwing them around involve quite unrelated capacities. Yet most of Larkin's poems rest on just this sort of move, from the specific incident (of the 'I, the poet, don't much Uke having sex' genre), to a generalised condemnation of human pleasure as deception ('fulfilment's desolate attic', etc).10 What permits this passage is the detachment of the emotion from the event. It is this detachment that is the telos of the Larkin image, and the criterion governing his choice of metaphor and comparison: to produce the 'condensation' that will allow us to master the image, while denying it any claim upon our sense of responsibility. It is only in such a state, in which the poem exists to allow the enjoyment of an egocentric emotion (nostalgia, envy), that the intelligence can relax enough to let logical fallacies take the place of interest in a world independent of our desires and neuroses. All Larkin's poetry revolves around this generalisation of a quite specific emotional response hinging on an arbitrary and irrationally masochistic rejection of experience. To present Larkin as a poet who remains true to poetry as the rendering of experience is simply absurd. Larkin posits experience as a beyond into which he has no desire to enter. His need to maintain his own autonomy, and his refusal of any emotion that is not 'inconsequential', are incompatible with a serious attempt to render perception or emotion as form. Rather, his poetry draws on the stock-characters of English social consciousness, dealing with caricatures, not myths. It is these caricatures- the unbearable neighbours and their unbearable conversations, the commercial hotel, the overcrowded beach, the Oxbridge dons- that we recognise, and that encourage us lazily to identify these statements with our own lives, not because we have met such people and events, but because they belong to our post-war democratic self-image, a fictitious mixture of contempt and self-satisfaction that has grown up in our popular culture and which we at times try to live up to, willingly or not. It is on these caricatures that he can then impose his emotional patterns, the dying fall from a false sense of life to a false anticipation of mortality. That Larkin's use of what we may continue loosely to call persona is not a liberation but a trap, becomes increasingly obvious in his later work. In 'Mr Bleaney' ( Collected Poems, pp. 102-3) his images are not experiences, but stereotyped judgments assem- bled to denounce this alter ego, yet at the same time the poet is forced to admit that he can do no better himself: 'I'll take it,' he says of his predecessor's repulsive room, and once there he is compelled to relive the same experiences that Bleaney had.</page><page sequence="7">Lar kin's conceit 67 Larkin's use of persona to condemn others ends by reducing the poet and reader themselves to the same level as the objects of their hatred. By assuming the knowl- edge before experience, that others who think they are better off than him are only more deceived, and thus modelling all their lives on his own failures, the poet sen- tences himself to imprisonment in a world in which there is nothing which might help him to escape from his own limitations. As 'This Be The Verse' claims ( Collected Poems, p. 180), such life is a destructive cycle, in which each person destroys the lives of all the others they might create. 'They fuck you up, your mum and dad': there is no better (or more incestuous) metaphor for Larkin's own relation to his characters. So is there no way out? There is one solution that is sometimes canvassed, as in 'High Windows' ( Collected Poems, p. 165), where the vision of the cycle of judg- ment- Larkin's judgment of the young couple, which replicates an imaginary prede- cessor's judgment on his earlier self- produces a desire to escape from language and its fictions: And immediately Rather than words comes the thought of high windows: The sun-comprehending-glass, And beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows Nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless. This moment may appear mystical, but its content is the aspiration to what is Larkin's basic ontological category, 'blankness': 'the solving emptiness/ That lies just under all we do [. . .]/ So permanent and blank and true' ('Ambulances', Collected Poems, pp. 132-3). For him, all identity is an illusion, and the only epiphanies are of those moments when 'the unique random blend/ Of families and fashion' may 'At last begin to loosen.' This blankness haunts him: it is not truly, as some have claimed, a metaphysical category, biit a depressive-affective one, an objective correlative of the spiritual atony that detached emotion encourages. It is this emptiness, rewritten in the vocabulary of paradise, that is envisaged in 'Dry-Point' {Collected Poems, pp. 36-7): that bare and sunscrubbed room, Intensely far, that padlocked cube of light We neither define nor prove, Where you, we dream, obtain no right of entry. This room is the repository of Larkin's deepest desire for his self: oblivion. As such, it is another version of 'fulfilment's desolate attic': for what is wrong for Larkin is not wanting the attic, but wanting it under a false name. Blankness is his proof of the impossibility of happiness. And that proof is in itself the source of a certain 'happiness'. To trace Larkin's emotions back to their sources would not be very difficult. The poem 'First Sight' ( Collected Poems, p. 112) provides a clue in its essaying of a numbed pastoral:</page><page sequence="8">68 Critical Survey , Volume 3, Number 1 Lambs that learn to walk in snow When their bleating clouds the air Meet a vast unwelcome, know Nothing but a sunless glare. Newly stumbling to and fro All they find, outside the fold, Is a wretched width of cold. Here is the original context of blankness. The child, still fixated on its mother as both object and image of its own narcissism, experiences the rest of reality as this 'vast unwelcome'. Later, encountering 'Earth's immeasurable surprise', which is 'Utterly unlike the snow', and which, as we know from the rest of the oeuvre, is not a nice surprise, he will return to this image of undifferentiated otherness. In a world from which the supportive maternal presence has withdrawn, his fidelity to this blankness is the reverse side of his refusal of the traumas and responsibilities of adult affec- tivity. Larkin's longing for oblivion, and his denigration of our illusory, caricatural lives, are equally effects produced by this refusal of the risks of that autonomy that is thrust upon us. The poetry of inconsequential emotion is a way of directing that autonomy which none of us can avoid to the production of fictions that shield us from the possibility of involvement with other human lives. Sex is an infringement of our individuality (see 'Reasons for Attendance'), that weak convention which has to be preserved in deference to the closed and perfect image of the mother we have lost. It is out of this quarrel with his own development that, for Larkin, form becomes the victim of content, rather than the means by which content- 'experience'- can pass into something other than itself, more real, more true. His failure cannot be dealt with in terms of the contrast between two theories of language, one poetic, one critical. It can only be seen in his failure to let language pass beyond such a theory, whatever it is, to the point at which rhythm and image become the presen- tation of a Being that lies beyond our egocentric manipulations, but yet within the texture of these words. Almost all Larkin's metaphors are crudely didactic or inten- tional, almost all his rhythms a ticking-over of the form kept carefully below the level at which stress and sway may suddenly begin to draw our meanings out beyond themselves, and into that thing which we recognise as poetry. Such versify- ing, however competent, remains just as much an exercise in power-politics, as the theoretical hegemonies Stephen Watson so resents. These points have nothing to do with Clark Coolidge, but everything to do with Paz, Seferis and Montale. The first lesson English poetry has to learn is that in mentioning Larkin's name beside theirs we are only exposing ourselves to the benign amusement of our European contemporaries. For Larkin, verse never becomes poetry, because it aspires not to lose itself so that it may be saved, but to save itself from the arbitrary dangers of our fives, becoming that impossible 'soundless field' through which the poet walks. Here, in 'Myxoma- tosis' ( Collected Poems, p. 100), the violence that is elsewhere re-routed into sarcasm and envy, erupts in its real impatience with any art of language:</page><page sequence="9">Lar kin' s conceit 69 What trap is this? Where were its teeth concealed? You seem to ask. I make a sharp reply, Then clean my stick. I'm glad I can't explain Just in what jaws you were to suppurate: You may have thought things would come right again If you could only keep quite still and wait. No motivation or metaphoric expansion is given for this image that can only impose itself as interesting if it is read as an anthropomorphic figure for our condition. The euphemistic ellipsis of 'reply' brings home to us forcibly that this is language that will not tolerate dialogue with its subject or its reader. Both are dispatched before the end of what would be the first quatrain, so that explanations may be denied, and content reduced to a single supposition which is as comforting as it is bleak. Stillness is not a solution, but it is all there is that is not deceived. Larkin's poetry does not help us to focus 'the dilemma of poetry in the contempor- ary world',11 except in a negative manner that its author certainly never intended. The state of emergency that it suggests is a purely egocentric (and at times, nationalistic) one. The possibility of poetry is in fact predicated on our ability to renounce vanity, if not in our lives, then in our writing, and to accept that what works in and through poetry is not what we want, or what our censors will permit us, but that which breaks us, whether in order to remake us or to leave us lying there abandoned at the side of the path. Achievement is at the price of this readiness to give ourselves up to our demons, for good or ill. Lar kin knew something of this in his youth, even as he feigned the fictions of jaded age, but he soon turned away from this darker imagination: And I am sick for want of sleep; So sick, that I can half-believe The soundless river pouring from the cave Is neither strong nor deep; Only an image fancied in conceit.12 It was this conceit that fashioned him, and ensured his popularity that even today seems, in certain quarters, unabated. But these 'severed images' with their carefully sutured emotions are the antithesis of real poetic experience, which is ex-periri, a passage through danger, whose outcome is not guaranteed. This, not any fashionable obscurity or impenetrable metaphysic, is the true heart of modernity. The failure of English poetry since Eliot, of which Larkin is simply one of the more visible emblems, has been its refusal to countenance any save the most stereotyped and most easily shored-up of catastrophes. But our happiness is, and always has been, at this price. No wonder Larkin was unhappy.13 1 Philip Larkin, Required Writing (Faber, 1983), p. 73. * bdited by Anthony lhwaite (I he Marvell Fress/raber and raber). 3 Katha Polliti, 'Philip Larkin', Grand Street , vol. 9 no. 3, Spring 1990, summarises the American response, quoting Edward Mendelson in the New Republic and Robert Richman in the New Criterion.
