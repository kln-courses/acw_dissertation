<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMPERIAL ROME AND THE GENESIS OF CLASSIC INDIAN ART Part I. Imitation and Absorption of Hellenistic Roman Art in India: Hellenistic influence on Indian art has become identified with the ? Graeco-Buddhist ? art of Gandh?ra. But strictly speaking, that art had not much to do with either Greece or India. Flourishing after the fall of the Indo-Greek power under Scy? thian, Parthian and Kush?na rulers, it was derived from the late Hellenistic art of the Egyptian and Syrian provinces of the Roman Empire, and it flourished in countries where Indian cultural influence, though not absent, had always been much less than that of other civilizations. Where Indian culture was really alive, i.e. from the central Panj?b eastwards, it could not compete with the genuine Indian tradition. Mathur? on the Jumn? was the last and weakest outpost of Gandh?ra art in the East. This is but natural. Such an obvious and superficial adaptation of a foreign style (1) is quite possibile in commercial cities, like the towns of ancient Phoenicia, Carthage or Etruria and like the Buddhist caravan towns along the Central Asian trade routes. But it can never happen in any country with an old culture of its own like India. This does not mean that Hellenistic influence was not felt there. Just the opposite! But the reaction to it could no more be a relatively unquestioned acceptance, interested more in the ultimate result of effective decoration than in the means by which this had been achieved. Here it meant a critical attitude, a questioning, a rejection of whatever was felt to be alien; not so much a selection of what, after some trans formations, might prove useful, but rather an inspiration on how to use the indigenous tra? dition in novel ways, for novel purposes. Mathur?: This is especially obvious in the works of the school of Mathur?, the first stage of classic Indian sculpture. A wealthy com? mercial town on the Yamun? where the trade routes from Central Asia, Sind, the Gulf of Cambay, the Deccan and east India converged, and an important place of pilgrimage, equally sacred to Buddhists, Jainas and Hindus, Ma? thur? has always been a centre of Indian civi? lization attracting artists, literati and scholars. And yet, for at least four centuries (2nd cen? tury B.C. to early 3rd century A.D.) it was likewise a centre of foreign political power, the residence of Greek, Scythian, Parthian and Kush?na kings and viceroys. Ir?nian as well as Gandh?ra art, therefore, got a foothold in this towns. Yet Mathur? art as a whole is more consciously Indian than that of the in? terior of the country, e.g. at Amar?vati, The non-Indian creations were limited to the cir? cles of foreign settlers, e.g. the Ir?nian and semi-Ir?nian statues of the satrap Chashtana and of the Kush?na Emperors from the im? perial family shrine at M?t (2), or the H?ritI statue from Sapt?rshi Til? (3) (in pure Gan? dh?ra taste) tentatively identified as a portrait of Kamboj?, wife of Chashtana, who, as her name tells us, must have been from the Gan? dh?ra region (4). But the Indian population remained faithful to their national art tradition, and even the majority of Scythians, Tokharians (5) and other foreigners had, for their votive statues 153</page><page sequence="2">and reliefs, to rely on pure Indian sculptors. As a matter of fact, one cannot escape the im? pression that this resistance had been con? scious. Though continuing the style develop? ment from Maurya-, Sunga-, K?nva- and S? tav?hana times, the sculpture of Mathur? is very different. Those earlier styles had been naive, unaffected. Now one feels an intellec? tual consciousness behind it, the evolution of an anatomical canon, the tentative formation of a fixed typology, i.e. the presence of a foreign criticism of Indian art, and a conscious Indian counter-criticism; the formulation of an ideal in opposition to the Hellenistic one, that of tropical man. And yet it is not less evident that this opposition did not exclude an intensive absorption of Hellenistic forms. Though no ruins of complete buildings have hitherto come to light, we have a numbei of architectural fragments revealing quite a new type of temple entrance ? rectangular, the door posts covered with figure groups of un? deniable Roman inspiration (6), and lintel slabs projecting at both ends beyond the posts (7) ? before that time unknown in Indian art (like all forms not derived from wooden architecture), but free (probably Parthian) imitations of Roman temple doors. Similar examples can be traced also in sculpture, e.g. the beautiful busts of a couple (8) which, notwithstanding their pure Indian style, are obviously inspired by a very com? mon type of Roman tomb stones. Also other reliefs go back to contemporaneous Roman art (9). Even in the erotic groups on top of the yakshl pilasters there is a new spirit, quite a series of new subjects. Though their style is purely Indian, one cannot help think? ing of the similar playful scenes so common in Alexandrian reliefs and paintings. Never? theless, taken all in all, the number of these borrowings is not excessive, and their absorp? tion into Indian art is complete. Gupta Art: However, these tendencies be? came much more evident in the Gupta period (4th ? early 6th centuries, with an aftermath extending to the middle of the 8th century) when the whole of Northern India was unit? ed in one empire, which politically domi? nated also Central India and the northern Deccan (Mah?kosala and the V?k?taka king? dom) and culturally even the South (Pallavas, Kadambas, Southern Gangas, later also the Ch?lukyas of B?d?mi and Vengi). Considered merely from the point of view of style, Gupta art represents the most unequivocal continua tion of the Indian traditio Ii, and especially of the Mathur? school. And also in its typo? logy and iconography it claims to be an ex? pression of the national tradition since the times of the gods and the ancient rishis. But on a closer examination this does not work out. The literary claims are most vague, re? ferring to personalities either unknown other? wise, or of purely mythological character. And the so numerous new types now turning up in architecture, sculpture and painting have either no precedents at all in the earlier art or only very loose links with it. For prac? tically a new tradition is formed, based strictly on the demands of stone construction, whereas earlier Indian art adhered to the principles of wood construction, even where it used stone or bricks (10). However, when we analyze these many innovations, we almost always discover Roman, occasionally also Near-East? ern prototypes (11). Analysis of Gupta Art: It is, of course, necessary to prove this general impression by means of detailed analysis. A. Architecture: 1) Temple Type: At the beginning there stands a new temple type until then unknown in the country (at least as far as our incomplete knowledge permits us to judge) resembling at first impression a small Hellenistic temple (either a tern plum in antis, or a prostylos), e.g. at S?nchl (No. 17) (fig. I, 4), Udaypur (M?lwa) (fig. I, 1) Tigowa (fig. I, 2), Mahu? (N?rwar) (fig. I, 3) (12). However, the resemblance holds good only to a certain point: The plinth rising, on a few steps, in a succession of mouldings, ends in a low ? roof ? of the traditional Indian type, with decorative dormer windows, or a frieze of projecting small reliefs separated from each other by intervals. The rectangular or octa? gonal pilasters, though standing on a basis repeating the plinth motif, are the traditional railing posts, ending in a crossbracket or a cushion-, resp. ? pot-and-foliage ? capital. The walls are plain, or have small image ni? ches, or are divided by pilasters (echo of the peripteros?), the roof is not sloping and there? fore has no gable but consists of flat stone slabs, moulded at the edge like miniature roofs resting on a simple cornice. Often enough a second, somewhat higher roof has been added to the cella, or else the lower ? roof ? merely forms the beginning of the cornice. Thus, if the Graeco-Roman inspiration of the type as a whole cannot be denied, it has been 154</page><page sequence="3">Fig. I. Early Gupta Temples inspired by Hellenistic Temples: 1.

Temple 17, S?nchi, early 5th century. 4 155</page><page sequence="4">elaborated in a quite independent manner, making use of traditional Indian forms, using them however in a quite novel way. Under Kum?ragupta I (413/4-355) how? ever the break with the Roman prototype be? came definitive as a result of the introduction of the sikhara (13). Again we find a foreign idea: the Babylonian ziggurat (14), reinter? preted in an Indian sense. This innovation seems to have something to do with the intro? duction of astrology in the Gupta period, pos? sibly in connection also with the revival of the Mihira S?rya cult, and the introduction (ca. 6th-7th century) (15) of the ?Navagraha? (nine planets, i.e. sun and moon, the five then known planets, and the two aspects of the increasing and decreasing moon, Ketu and R?hu) as part of the temple decoration, espe? cially at both sides or on top of the entrance to the garbhagriha (adyton). A primitive stage of this new development had been the a Greek Temple ? at Taxila (Jandi?l) (16), a Hellenistic templum in antis (already pro? vided with a circumambulation passage having a step tower in the episthodomos (1st century A.D.). Gupta architecture, however, deve? loped this tower by a reduplication of the sanctuary which first formed a real second chapel on the roof of the shrine (pr?s?da), e.g. N?chn?-Kuthara; Aihole (Lad Khan, Rachigudi, Meguti); Bhumara; Pattadakal (shrine near the Vir?p?ksha, fig. II, 3) (17), then a tower of miniature storeys (Deogarh, fig II, 1, Bhitarg?on, Gop, Northern-Fort Temple B?d?mi) (18), later of miniature roofs only, amalgamated into the beehive-shaped sikhara. This latter was identified with the central mountain of the universe, the Meru, the Kail?sa (a concept which also otherwise, e.g. in palace architecture, played an import? ant role in the late Gupta period (19). Al? ready by the 8th century its original elements had lost their function so that the dormer windows, last remnants of the original storeys, became transformed into a continuous orna? ment (first at Osi?n). The imposition of this tower, however, had the effect that the ground plan of the garbhagriha became square (or slightly transverse, needing a wagon roof on top, e.g'. Jagesvar, Vait?l Deul at Bhuvanes vara, Teli-k?-Mandir at Gw?lior, Naresar, fig II, 2 and 4, etc.) (20). Even the oblong groundplan due to the porch was annulled, the latter being reduced to insignificance so that it could be repeated also on the other three sides of the cella (e.g. at Deogarh, Bhi targ?on). The next step was to expand it into a circumambulating passage around the whole building (N?chn?-Kuthara, Gop), first an open gallery, later a dark corridor. It is true that in the Deccan an oblong temple type de? veloped at the same time (at Aihole, B?d?mi); but its genesis is very different, starting from the imitation of a Buddhist vih?ra laid out around a court or hall (especially evident in the Lad Khan and Kontgudi, also in the Durga temple). When at last the outline of the square sanctuary and of the sikhara was reduplicated in a vertical direction, not the least echo of the Hellenistic-Roman prototype remained. On the other hand we find in the late temples a crypt, a characteristic feature of the Roman Syrian sanctuaries; in Greater India it became the funeral chamber for the ashes of the founder. 2) The Shrine Entrance: The shrine en? trance in particular offers us a very similar picture. The rectangular door had been known in preceding times, but was used, always with? out decoration, only for subordinate passages; the principal doors, on the other hand, had always been enclosed in a semicircular arch, not rarely with a projecting vaulted roof. Since the Kush?na period, however, we find a new rectangular door within a flat frame, sometimes with an added torus moulding (21). This flat frame, first merely decorated with flowers (fig. II) or with a procession of animals of Indian type, was soon subdivided into pa? nels filled with standing or sitting amorous couples (mithuna) (fig. Ill, 3; IV, 4; V, 1, 3, 5), i.e. the yakshas and yakshls who in the Maurya and early 2?unga period had still been autonomous genii loci, who thereafter became attached, as protective deities, to the Buddhist relic shrines, and who, with the growth of the various orthodox Hindu systems of theology, were more and more reduced to a sort of hea? venly hosts. Gandharvas, Kinn?ris, etc. But already in the 5th century a further evolution set in: The number of frames, stepwise pro? jecting from the door proper to the surround? ing wall (fig. Ill, 1; IV, 1, 4; V, 4, 5; VI. 2, 4, 5) was increased first to four, then up to seven, and simultaneously the decoration became richer: Alternating scroll friezes. mithuna friezes, pilasters or columns, and floral torus mouldings. The scroll work con? sisted either of spirals of alternating direction (first the current type: Bhumara, Udaygiri, S?rn?th, Jagesvar, Osi?n, etc.) or of two in? tertwined creepers (known mainly from me 156</page><page sequence="5">Fig. II.

It first started on top of standing yakshas (dwarfs) (fig. V, 1) then grew from their navel (fig V, 2), and at last other ganas (yakshas) also played amidst its leaves (fig. V, 5, 6). As the lowermost panel of the mithuna frieze needed standing figures, first N?gas (or Yakshas) (fig. V, 1, 5), then (since ca. the 6th-7th century) the goddesses of the rivers Gang? and Yamuna (transferred hither from the lintel corners: Lad Khan and Huchchi malligudi at Aihole, Ajant? 26, Bajaur?, K? lik? Chitorgarh, S?mlaji, Osi?n 1, Sirpur, Kharod, Teli-k?-Mandir Gw?lior) (fig. V, 1, 4) were introduced. The other panels, how? ever, became miniature chapels, each resting on a plinth or lotus and ending in a dimi? nutive roof supported by columnettes (fig. V, 3, 5). The columns, where they formed a frieze of the door jambs, were either real slim columns such as were then used for wooden pavilions (fig. Ill, 3; IV, 1), or decorative imitations of the old railing-posts of the Bud? dhist st?pas, or rose from pot-and-foliage ca? pitals and ended in similar ones, or they were interspersed with Gupta capitals (see below), pairs of lions rampant (fig. IV, 3) (likewise an old Indian motif). Since ca. the 7th cen? tury mithunas were often, though not always replaced by the Navagraha (fig. VI, 5) and other gods, especially the avat?ras of Vishnu (fig. IV, 4); since the late 8th century a frieze of intertwined snakes was sometimes added (at Osi?n, Jagesvar, fig. V, 4, Amber, in many Chauh?n temples, Kon?rka, fig. V, 3). Since ca. the 6th century the river goddesses were again ousted by donor figures (kings and queens with their personal attendants, fig. XVII, 1), or the female donors at least were represented in the guise of Gang? and Yamun? (Teli-k?-Mandir Gw?lior). In an even later (Mediaeval) phase the donors were again set aside in favour of guardian deities (dv?rap? las and dv?rap?lik?s). Side by side with this, the lintel also under? went successive transformations. The mithu? nas became Gandharva couples (e.g. Ajant? 1. Durga Temple Aihole, B?d?ml caves, fig. Ill, 3; VII, 1, 7) flying towards a central orna? ment looking like a ? crown ? (e.g. Shanmuk hesvara Temple at Bil?spur; Lakshan? Devi Temple at Brahmor, Masr?r, Naresar (figs. VI, 2, 3; VII, 1, 7) (22), or a chorus of hea? venly musicians playing various instruments (especially on the inner friezes). Then the ? crown ? was superseded by a relief, then by a projecting stone block on which the (prin? cipal) deity of the temple was sculptured (figs. Ill, 3; IV 4; VI, 2, 5) (23). The exterior (top) frieze of the lintel was generally allotted to the Navagraha or other gods. If slim ordi? nary columns were introduced in the friezes of the door posts, a set of miniature ? cha? pels ? (pancharama), housing these gods, or at least a set of roofs formed the corresponding part of the lintel (e.g. at Aurang?b?d 1, 3, Durga Temple Aihole, Teli-k?-Mandir Gw? lior, Jogesvari, Deogarh, fig. Ill, 3). The pro? jecting ends of the lintel were on both sides carried down for some distance along the outer side of the door posts (fig. Ill, 3; IV, 1-3). These corners were originally decorated with lions rampant (SaktidevI Temple, Chhatr?rhi) or Yakshas (Ajant? 21), or a combination of both, with a man (Yaksha?) fighting with a lion (fig. IV, 4) or riding on a vy?li (Ajant? 4, B?d?mi III). But as in the Buddhist toranas this corner had been given to tree goddesses, these latter were now introduced as the god? desses of the holy rivers, Gang? and Yamuna, first in very similar postures, then standing on a makara (resp. Gang? on a makara and Yuman? on a tortoise), soon also accompanied by umbrella bearers and other attendants (figs. Ill, 3; VI, 1; VI, 4) (24). When these river goddesses had been transferred to the socle of the door posts, they were replaced in those upper corners by female musician goddesses playing a vin? (as Sarasvati, likewise a river goddess, was also the protectress of art and learning, playing on a vin?; e.g. at Tumain. fig. VI, 5). In analyzing this rather complicated deve? lopment of the Gupta shrine entrance, we again hit on a number of later Hellenistic Roman motifs just at the very start of the de? velopment: The rectangular flat frame, a se? quence of stepped frames, with the projecting lintel-ends led down round the corners (good examples: Temple of Vespasian and the Pan? theon at Rome, Palace of Diocletian at Spa lato, Temple of Roma and Augustus at An cyra, Baalbek, Palmyra, Husn Soleim?n, etc.) (25); the scroll frieze (sometimes ending in animals) in which ganas, i.e. Erotes are play? ing (e.g. Forum of Caesar, Ara Pacis Augu stae, Adamkilissi, Husn Solaim?n, triumphal arch at Saloniki ? ? very Indian x&gt; ?; even later, fig. V, 7); the intertwined creepers (e.g. Baalbek, Ancyra); the torus moulding in the shape of a laurel or acanthus garland (Column 159</page><page sequence="8">4 160</page><page sequence="9">i t s T 3 + , .J;i|SjS * 6 *7 Fig. V. 1.

VI, 6); the lions in the corners, very rare in Roman-Syrian architecture, but in their whole composition (with the heads turned-back) apparently a transformation of the usual S-volutes (Ancyra, Spalato, Baal? bek, Palmyra); the Nikes and Atlantes at the entrance corners at Husn Solaim?n, at the same spot where in India the river goddesses were placed. But at the same time also the complete In dianization of these motifs is no less evident. 162</page><page sequence="11">,^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fig. VII. 1.

Pancharamas ? of wood architecture (such as we see them depicted e.g. in the Ajant? murals). The dry acanthus-scroll was changed into a luscious tropical plant, even into the Kalpalat? known to us already from the Bh?r hut-railing coping-stones (fig. IV, 2). The torus moulding, the leaves of which were un? known to the Indians, were transformed into an almost abstract ? fish scales ? motif. The Victories were replaced by Gandharvas or mi thunas (fig. VI, 2) (26), the emperor's figure by a Hindu deity. Everything became purely Indian, and yet the whole would never have been possible without a Roman prototype. 4) Niches: But this is not all. The walls of the late antique temple were decorated with statues in wall niches, similar to the small chapels (aedicula) used as lararia, mithraeums (fig. IX, 1-4) etc. Sometimes they are just plain niches rounded on top (e.g. Janus Arch, Rome; Pompeii, etc.), more often they con? sist of a shelf bearing two columns and a (so? metimes broken up) triangular gable (Baal? bek, Palmyra, sarcophagi) or a conch apsis or exedra (ibid., thermae; very ? Indian ? examples e.g. at Hibbarlya and Majd?l An jar) resting on two (sometimes helical) (27) co? lumns. These niches are likewise imitated in the Gupta temple (fig. IX, 7; X, 3, 4), be? coming the substitute for the subsidiary shrines of the other prominent gods (i.e. Vishnu, Siva, S?rya or Brahma, Kubera, the two last ones replaced later by Durg? or Ch?mund?, and Ganesa) or of the Pariv?ra Devat?s (Dik p?las, corresponding to the Buddhist Loka p?las and Jaina Kshetrap?las) originally lean-* ing against the principal sanctuary. The plain niche rounded on top is rare (Mah?bodhi Temple Bodhgay?, N?land?). Only in Kash? mir (fig. IX, 5-7) the helical columns and (very steep) triangular gables (Roman proto? types first mainly on minor monuments, la? raria, Mithras stelae ? e.g. on the Saalburg ?, sarcophagi, later on the murals of the Catacombs ? e.g. S. Callisto ?, consular diptycha, in Coptic art, at Orange, Mshatta, etc.) have asserted themselves (Avantipur, P?tan, K?ladhera). In India proper the trian? gular gable had no place, and the conch (fig. X, 1) ? especially its late, omega-shaped va? riety (Baalbek, Palmyra, late sarcophagi) ? was exchanged for the well-established tradi? tional a chaitya-window ? (fig. X, 3) the more so as the perspective view of the ceiling of the chaitya hall inside this window had a su? perficial resemblance to the radial ribs of the conch (Durga Temple Aihole, Ajant? 1, El lor? 9, 10, Deogarh, N?land?). But used for this different purpose the ? chaitya window ? lost its original function, became a mere orna? ment (gav?ksha), was often enough split in two like the late Roman gable or reduplicated into a more complex pediment until, with the development of the sikhara, it grew into a spire-like heap of gav?kshas (figs. X, 3, 4). 5) The Pediment: When the sikhara (or its precursors) became the fashion, the porch received a wagon roof ending in a ? chaitya window ?. For some time (until ca. 8th cen? tury) this window preserved its original func? tion as the source of light for the cult image, though in much reduced dimensions because of the narrowness of the cella. When early in the Middle Ages a separate cult hall was added in front of the sanctuary, the window was reduced to a pediment of purely deco? rative character, because the idol was now displayed, beyond the pitch-black antarala, in the light of oil lamps. Like the Graeco-Roman gable, this pediment was filled with the figure of the deity of the shrine (esp. Siva Natar?j?). But in most cases merely a head, often three (or four)-faced, was carved out (bhadra mukha), again repeating a formula likewise known in Roman and Mediaeval Italian art, the Trinity in the gable field (Roman exam? ples: Baalbek, Palmyra, Saalburg, fig. IX, 1, various altars, Mithras stelas, sarcophagi). 6) The Cornice and Plinth: Another feature is a frieze of projecting cubes (Avan tipur, Deogarh, Jageswar, Mandor, Kedsid dhesvara Pattadakai, N?land?, Naresar, Bhu vaneswar, etc.) along the cornice (fig. II, 1, XII, 6), evidently an adaptation of the Graeco Roman triglyphs, resp. their degenerated late Roman variety, e.g. at Spalato. At least since the 7th century this frieze was repeated also along the ? roof ? of the plinth (which, in its turn, repeated ? in miniature ? all the elements of a fagade, i.e. plinth, wall with pillars, cornice, roof e.g. fig. I, 3; X, 3; XI, 1) and then decorated with vertical relief pa? nels: ((Metopes? (e.g. Mandor, Pattadakal, M?mallapuram) (28). Or the plinth was di? vided into a series of horizontal relief panels alternating with small pilasters, at last with one long frieze.

Though its decoration somewhat resembled that of the Graeco-Roman box ceiling, that latter is found only in Kashmir (M?rt?nd, fig. Ill, 2) Aihole (Lad Kh?n, fig.

The real arch and vault so common in pre-Gupta Buddhist wood architecture, were completely abandoned with the introduction of the trabeate stone con? struction. Not that it was unknown. We meet it occasionally, e.g. in the brick temples of Bhitarg?on and Bodhgay?, later at M?l-Dv? raka (in Saur?shtra), finally carved, small size, into stone slabs (e.g. S?rn?th, Mathur? fragment in Lucknow Museum). But the only temples where it really was used, were those of the 8th century in Kashmir: Takht-i Su laim?n fig. VII, 9), Hindu parts re-used in the tomb of sult?n Zain-ul-c?bidln's mother (fig. VII, 10), and especially the great Sun Temple of M?rt?nd, though very modestly, as the lower third of the Kashmiri trefoil arch was in any case constructed in corbelling tech? nique. 8) Columns and Pilasters: The history of the Gupta column is rather complicated. It starts from (a) the ? Buddhist ? railing post (fig. XII, 3) (b) the square, resp. octagonal pilaster (fig. XII, 1) (c) the old ? Buddhist ? column, resting on a sort of pot and ending in a ? cushion ? capital. All those types were not only developed individually, but also com? bined in the most confusing variations, and further enriched by new decorative elements taken over from the contemporary wall deco? ration, i.e. garlands, pearl necklaces, etc. round the shaft, flower bunches (and since the early Middle Ages also snakes) on the capitals, figures of minor deities in the cor? ners between the different parts of the co? lumns, and on the panels of the pilaster shafts, and the brackets radiating from the abaci above the capitals or from a first, lower capital and abacus (fig. XV, 6). The most common type of the late Gupta, early Ch? lukya, and also early R?shtrak?ta period (i.e. 6th-9th century) (30) consisted of a fluted shaft emerging from a square or octagonal pilaster, then, contracted, going over into a torus moulding and at last opening into a flower cup (fig. XII, 4) (31). On the first impression all these new forms represent a genuine native development. And yet even in this case a foreign inspiration ? though no direct model ? seems likely: (a) The he? lical column (e.g. in the B?gh caves nos. 2 and 4 (fig. XII, 2) (32), later found only in subordinate position or as part of a composite column, has its prototypes at Baalbek and on many sarcophagi, (b) The ? cup capital ? of the late Gupta composite column, resembles the Doric capital, (c) The reduplication of the capital and abacus is characteristic of late Roman and early Christian architecture (Ther? mae of Treves, Temple of Saturnus Rome, Ba? silica Nuova Rome, Ravenna, etc.) and is even slavishly copied at M?rt?nd, (d) The ? pot and-foliage ? capital is the counterpart of the Corinthian capital, with its acanthus leaves growing from a ? basket ?. (e) The brackets with tree goddesses or Gandharva mithunas (Ajanta 20, Aurang?b?d 1, B?d?ml caves, fig. XV, 5, Ellor? 21, Osi?n) are obviously de? scendants of the Vrikshak?s of the old Bud? dhist toranas. Yet their character has utterly changed. The torana figures were hanging sidewise, between the posts and beams, as dis? tinct supporting pieces. The Gupta and post Gupta tree goddesses, on the other hand, emerge from the top of the ? pot-and-foliage ? capital, bending over the visitor, their back to the shaft or abacus of the column, and they support nothing. This, however, is the posture of the figures in the late Corinthian capitals (e.g. Thermae of Caracalla, fig. XV, 4) which emerge from the acanthus scrolls, bending over the visitor, almost like brackets, but without any function as supports. In other words, though the Vrikshak? motif on the late Gupta pillars is Indian, its arrangement and specific use have been taken over from late Roman art. B. The Ornament: The Gupta period like? wise started a revolution of the ornament. The principal motives of the preceding period had been the lotus roundel and half-roundel, the lotus flower on the stalk, the Kalpalat? (gener? ally a rather meagre creeper) the palmette ? of Greek origin ? or a frieze of palmettes side by side (first found in the abacus of the R?m purv? pillar of Asoka, the Lohangl Hill co 167</page><page sequence="16">Fig. X. 1.

VII, 3-6) (33), stepped battlements, miniature railings and columns, heraldic animals (lions, elephants, eagles, etc. and their crossbreeds) with or without male or female riders, etc. None of these motives was discarded. But by their side quite a host of new ones turned up which cannot be derived from the Indian tradition: 1) an exuberant luscious floral scroll (34), in a number of varieties, but botanically difficult to define; often ganas play within' this scroll work, or they hold its stalks, or it springs from their navel, or it forms their lower body and tail (Bhumara, SaktidevI Temple Chhatr?rhi; K?lik? and Mah?sati Temples Chitorgarh; Deogarh; Jagesvar; Teli-k? Mandir Gw?lior, N?land?; Osi?n; Udaygiri, Orissa, fig. XIII, 1-4). The whole type as well as all its variants, however, are intelligible only as derivations from the Hel? lenistic-Roman acanthus scroll work (e.g. Fora of Caesar fig. XIII, 5, and Trajan; ? Janus Arch ? Rome; Adamkilissi; Saloniki Arch; Ara Pacis Augustate, fig. XIII, 6; Baalbek; Palmyra; Husn Solaiman) with the difference that the acanthus leaves underlying it have been replaced by lotus stalks and flowers, only the odd leaf work betraying the foreign origin. 2) The wreath torus, evidently an adap? tation of the laurel garlands held together by crossed ribbons which are so common in Roman art. The desiccated, abstract character of the Indian imitation (Bhumara, Aurang? b?d 1, Deogarh, Ajant? 26) proves that the underlying plant was not known (fig. Ill, 3; IV, 1, 3, 4; V, 1; VI, 2; VII, 7, 8). 3) Garlands of pearl chains alternately hanging down or loosely connecting two sup? ports (Aihole: Durga Temple, Aurang?b?d, Ajant? 1, Pattadakai, Ellor? 10, 21, Mathur?, Naresar, Osian 5, fig. II, 3): Such ornaments in Gupta times became the fashion for the girdles (mekhal?) of upper-class ladies (fig. XVII, 1) and the ornamentation on walls and pillars merely copied them. But the whole arrangement is new and seems to derive from similar flower garlands in Roman ornament. As Indian ladies like to wear fresh flowers, the adoption of this ornament may in fact first have occurred in ladies' fashion. In view of the immense luxury in jewellery, especially pearls, the transfer of this flower decoration into gold, silver and pearls could not but sug gest itself. Its use in architecture, however, may have had two other sources, i.e. the heavy garland and the slightly folded curtains paint? ed on the walls of so many Hellenistic and Roman buildings (35). 4) Frieze of lotus petals along the edge of door jambs, niche sills, etc. (Roman exam? ples: Ara Pacis Augustae. Indian examples: Aurang?b?d 1, Muktesvar Bhuvaneswara. K? lik? Temple and (old parts of) Kumbhasy?ma Chitorgarh, Osi?n 3, etc., fig. V, 3; VI, 1). 5) Friezes of four-or-more-petalled flower rosettes, sometimes alternating with rhomboid ornaments (Roman examples: Ju? piter Column, Mayence; etc. fig. VII, 4; XIII, 7. Indian: Avantipur, Jagesvar, Jogesvari, Mandor, Osi?n 5, fig. Ill, 3; IV, 2, 4; V, I, 2, 4). 6) Friezes of ? double ? palmettes (late Roman, Byzantine and Carolingian ivories; in India in Gupta, Mediaeval, even Rajput architecture). C) Figural Art-. 1) Animals: a) Pre-Gupta Types (36): Already in pre-Gupta times a multitude of ? heraldic ? animals of mixed character (winged lions and horses, griffins, chimeras, sphinxes, makaras, genii with horse heads, bulls with human heads, birds with human heads, etc.) were known. Their ico? nography goes back more or less to Achaeme nian-Persian and in the last instance to Su mero-Babylonian, even Egyptian prototypes, though many figures may have been known in India since much erlier times, as they be? long to the common stock of ideas of all pri? mitive nature cults. Their history is still little explored, but most of them are older than Gandh?ra art. Since the Gupta period however a number of new types turned up, or old types in a new guise: b) Makaras : Their transformation into the later type (e.g. S?mlaji, Ellor? 6, Jogesvari, Pattadakal, fig. VI, 4; X, 2; XIV, 4) seems to be due to three influences: On the one hand the makara became the ? bracket ? connecting the pillar with the makara-arch, after it had been introduced there as v?hana of the tree goddess transformed into Gang?. On the other hand, its long proboscis goes probably back to the snout of the Hellenistic dolphin and hippocampus (37), and its feather- or scroll? work tail to the Hellenistic Ichthyocentaures 170</page><page sequence="19">s s Fig. XII.

XIV; 6, 5; Arch of Galerius at Saloniki, etc.) (38). c) This proboscis was transferred to the Vy?lis (39) and the scrollwork tail to the HAMSAS (40). d) KiNN?RiS: Here, too, we find a very complex development. The old human-headed bird (Suparna) is superseded by one with a human upper body (kinn?rl), like the Helle? nistic harpies. But on the other hand the latter can have only been an inspiration; for in prac? tice the old dwarf-yakshas (guhyakas, ga nas) are provided with a scrollwork tail like the hamsas and makaras, and sometimes this tail reminds one of that of a peacock (S?rya Temple Chitorgarh, Jagesvar, Osi?n, etc., fig. VII, 7; XIV, 1, 3). e) Peacocks and doves turn up, as com? mon decorative motifs, in Kashmir since the 8th century (fig. IX, 7), they remind one very much, even in their design, of the same ani? mals in early Christian art (sarcophagi at Ra? venna, Rome, etc.). f) KiRTiMUKHA: This demon mask was very much in fashion in the time between the 6th and 9th century (Ajant? 19; pillar in Mathur? Museum; S?nchl 45; Jogesvarl; Pattadakal; Roda, fig. XII, 4 (top), Osi?n 1, 2, 6; Mah? sati Temple Chitorgarh, etc.) especially as a pillar decoration; thereafter it survived mainly as the crowning motif of idol stelas and of makara arches and as a frieze around the tem? ple plinth. In this latter capacity it was evi? dently a substitute for the elephant and lion (and later also vy?li) figures, applied there in late S?tav?hana, Ikshv?ku, Pallava and Chola art; and especially in late Mediaeval and Is? lamic times it often resembles a lion face. But in other cases it looks like a Chinese horned Tao-t'ieh, and just in the period of its greatest popularity it is generally an evil demon face. Thus other sources of inspiration have to be considered. From a merely decorative point of view this may have been the mask so com? mon in late Hellenistic-Roman art. As a sym? bolic motif it reminds one of the head of R?hu. But in Indonesia it has been connected with the sun (41), and perhaps its interpretation in India also should be sought in the same direction because of its similar connection with the makara motif. At least its fashion coin? cided with the sun and star cults imported at that very time in India (see below). 2) The Human Figure: a) Ganas : The ga nas of Hinduism have developed out of the yakshas of Buddhist and pre-Buddhist times. However, the yaksha statues of the late Mau rya and Sunga-K?nva periods were almost life-size, fully grown figures. First at Bodh gay? and Mathur?, already in contact with Hellenistic civilization, we find them repre? sented as dwarfs (guhyakas) on which the yakshls and vrikshak?s are standing. In Gupta art, and especially in the related art of the early Ch?lukyas, they first turn up as a funny folk of playful, but clumsy little beings, busy in practically all human activities (Aihole 9, Ajant? 23, 27, fig. XIV, 2; XV, 3, Northern Fort Temple and Malegitti Siv?laya Temple B?d?ml, Deogarh, Ellor? 10, 21, Udaygiri, Orissa). However, this was exactly the role of the Erotes (Putti) in Hellenistic art. If the ganas play about in the scroll work of the temple decorations, this, too, the Hellenistic Erotes were doing, though, on the other hand, we have to acknowledge that they often took the place of the human figures (of J?taka scenes) set between the volutes of the Kalpa lat? at Bh?rhut, S?nchi, etc. (42). That this relationship is not accidental, is proved by the seal of the Maukharl Sarvavarman (fig. XV, 2) on which the bull of Siva is represented, led by ganas strongly reminding one of Hel? lenistic Erotes. After the 7th century the ganas, in this role, went out of fashion, though they continued to figure as the attendants of Siva. b) KiCHAKAS (43) and N?GAS : Instead, they fill as Kichakas (Osi?n, Jagesvar, S?rya Tem? ple Chitorgarh) the role of the Atlantes in Hel? lenic-Roman and Gandh?ra art, however not on the socle or plinth, but as bracket figures, caryatids, on top of the columns (fig. XV, 6). Their posture is more or less the same as that of the Atlantes; their transfer may have been due to the neighbourhood of the yakshls, with which, as dwarfs, they had been connected since Kush?na times, but who likewise ? as already explained ? had been transferred hither as Vrikshak?s, river goddesses or Mi? thunas (fig. XV, 5). On the other hand, flying genii on the supports of the entablature are likewise known in the West, e.g. at Baalbek, Spalato, the Palace of Crescentius at Rome (fig. VIII, 6) etc. Also the N?gas assumed the role and posture of the Atlantes (Ajant?, N? land?, Tell-k?-Mandir, Udaygiri Oriss?) hold? ing the stalk of the lotus on which the Bud? dha, Siva-Lakulisa or Lakshmi were sitting. 174</page><page sequence="23">jr^J Fig. XV.

III, 3; IV, 4; V, 1, 5; VI, 4; VIII, 5; XI, 2; XV, 5), and their representation since the Gupta period is taken from real life. The flying Gandharva (Vidy?dhara) couples (Durga Temple Aihole, Ajant? 1, Bil?spur, etc., fig. VII, 1; XVI, 1) ? the female sitting on the back of the flying male?belong however to a different category. They are the Nayads and Tritons of the Hel? lenistic typology (fig. XVI, 2) dressed up in Indian costumes, whereas the single Gandhar? vas were inspired by the flying Victories (45). The similarity goes so far that the Gandharva women on the ceiling of the Durga Temple at Aihole hold a flying scarf exactly as on Roman sarcophagus reliefs (46). e) Surasundaris (Apsaras): The ancient yakshls, so far as they had not been Vriksha k?s, became in classic Hindu art the seductive nymphs of Indra's heaven (Surasundaris). Re? presented en face, they go also iconographically back to the yakshi statues and reliefs of Sun ga-K?nva and S?tav?hana times. However, other variants, known mainly from North Indian Mediaeval sculpture, had in all proba? bility already been fixed in Gupta art, like more Mediaeval creations. In these (fig. XVI, 4, 5) the body, in a rather contorted position, is seen almost from the back, one or both arms are raised, the hind leg is crossed by that in front, the head often turned back. Unknown in earlier Indian art, such figures were com? mon on Roman sarcophagus and tombstone reliefs as Maenades and Bacchantes (fig. XVI, 3). 3) Costume: Early Gupta fashions had been not very dissimilar from those of the Kush?na period. But under Chandragupta II (47) a new, highly refined and sophisticated style was introduced, the principal characteristic of which was the masses of curled hair, later even wigs (?laka) on the heads of gentlemen and ladies (fig. XVII, 1-3). This hair style was not Indian. That of the men had some resem? blance with the S?s?nian, but on a closer exa ruination proves to be different. The exact counterpart, however, is found in the Roman Empire. It was with other Eastern customs made popular in Rome by Commodus (180 192), became the fashion under Gallienus (258/60-268), a disciple of the philosopher Plotinus, but was discarded by the Illvrian emperors. It had come from the Asiatic pro? vinces of the Empire, especially Syria, and was favoured mainly by the somewhat effe? minate refined youth, literati, artists, etc. (fig. XVII, 4, 5), in contrast to the puritan style characteristic for the soldiers (48). It is also the hair style of a statue of the young Christ, not long before the reign of Chandragupta II. Another, female, hair style (kumbha-bandha na, fig. XVII, 6) of the Gupta period (since the 6th century), was, like that of Kashmir, an evolution of that used by the rich ladies in Gandh?ra; and here, too, the prototypes are found in Syria, especially Palmyra, which likewise provided the models for much of the female jewelry (49). (3) Other Interrelations: With these, quite numerous, observations, however, the list of interrelations between later imperial Roman and Gupta art is far from closed. I shall have to confine myself to an enumeration of at least some more which have come to my notice: a) Bronze Casting and Inlay Work : First in the Gupta period we find bronze statues (e.g. the Sult?nganj Buddha, the Mirpur Kh?ss Brahma, etc.) and statuettes (e.g. the Kurkih?r, N?land? and Akot? hoards), some? times of considerable size, the inlay of bronze images with silver eyes, gold and copper orna? ments and precious stones (various Gandh?ra bronzes, the Fathpur Buddha, the Akot? Tirthankaras, and the bronze tradition of Nep?l), and mention of gigantic statues (at Parih?sapura, Srlnagar, etc. referred to in the R?jataranginl), apparently consisting of chased copper sheets and heads or hands cast, separately, all of them mounted on a core of wood or clay. These techniques were then well known in the Mediterranean world, though their actual home had been South? western Asia and Egypt. b) Glyptics : Precious stones engraved with seals, first used in the Near East, then in Greece and Rome, were introduced into India by the Greeks. In the Kush?na period still fairly common, they were still used under the Gupta emperors ? sometimes in very fine examples ? but increasingly replaced by seals in god, glass or clay. 177</page><page sequence="26">c) Enamel : The only Indian enamel work known to us is a pair of ear-disks (?) in the Cleveland Museum of Art and in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, of the Gupta period. d) Coinage (50): The Gupta silver coins continued the &lt;c Parthian ? type of the West? ern Kshatrapas. The gold coins first imitated those of the Kush?nas which, in their turn, had been modelled on those of the Roman emperors. However, in the period from Sa mudragupta (328-376) to Kum?ragupta I (414-55) their devices were increasingly India nized; the goddess on the throne was super? seded by Lakshml sitting on a huge lotus or by Ambik? sitting on her lion. The cornu? copia was transformed into a bunch of lotus flowers, the sceptre of the emperor became a Garudadhvaja. On the other hand, a certain infiltration of foreign forms was inevitable. Some coins with the bust of Chandragupta I are clearly imitations of Roman pieces. The horseman type follows the iconography of the earlier Greek coins, though the rather small horse reminds one of Roman horseman statues. In the lion-slayer type, Chandragupta III ap? pears exactly in the pose of Mithras Taurok tonos. There are other coins ? the emperor confronted with a goddess ? exactly like the S?s?nian coronation reliefs. Under Samudra gupta the Garuda is enclosed in a circle, as had been the fascion on the Roman standards: Garuda is represented en face, with spread wings, like a Roman eagle, very different from his usual representation. And even the selec? tion of SrI-Lakshmi may be due to the fact that, as R?jyasri, she is the counterpart of the Victory. At least the term R?jyasri is characte? ristic for the Gupta period. e) Thrones : The type of thrones now com? ing in to fashion, especially for Buddhist and Jaina idols, is very similar to that of Helle? nistic Roman art, though the animals used for its decoration are adapted to Indian ideo logy (51). f) v?hanas: Here, too, appear parallels, e.g. Sarasvati and Aether (Ara Pacis Augus tae, fig. XV, 1), Ambik? and Europa, etc. The concept, however, is much older, not Greek nor Roman, but characteristic of the re? ligions of ancient Southwestern Asia, and ulti? mately a byproduct of the transition from theriomorphism to anthropomorphism in pri? mitive religiosity. Nevertheless, it is curious that the v?hanas turn up in Indian icono? graphy just at this time of intensive foreign contacts. In contrast, the animals connected with deities in earlier Indian art, e.g. the ele? phants o? SrI-Lakshmi, are not v?hanas (ex? cept in the case of Indra), and the rider figures in the early cave sculpture are not gods, but at the utmost genii of the vaguest type. That the chariot of S?rya, seen en face, is a foreign loan (already in pre-Gupta times), has long been recognized (52). g) The Planetary Gods : See 11 Part in the next number. h) The Motif of the Half-Opened Door, with a (female) figure looking out from behind it, found on the reliefs of many Mediaeval Hindu temples (Bhuvanesvara, Osi?n, etc.), is common on Roman sarcophagi. i) Technical Treaties : The Silpas?stras suddenly turn up in ca. the 5th-6th cent. They are very curious. Their classifications work out only very imperfectly when checked up at the hand of contemporary monuments. Even many later Indian monuments do not fit exactly into their classifcation. Nearest to it are the towns and temples of Greater India, colonial crea? tions without a forceful background, and thus not hindered in the application of theoretical programs. Likewise is the historical tradition of the Silpas?stras very vague, losing itself soon in mythological names. On the other hand, as Dr. Prasanna Kumar Acharya (53) *? hitherto the most careful student of this lite? rature ? has pointed out, there is a parallel, almost down to every detail, between the M? nas?ra (possibly one of the earliest texts) and Vitruvius' ?De Architectural Thus one cannot escape the impression that this whole type of literature had been started in imitation of Roman writing and that only during the sub? sequent centuries a tolerable harmony between this enforced classification and real art deve? lopments was achieved. Synthesis of Observations: Before trying to interpret this mass of observations, it will be desirable first to work out the chronological stratification of the phenomena observed by us so far. For only then will it be possible to see them in their historical context, an ab? solute prerequisite for any attempt at an in? terpretation and explanation.

Art further south and east: considerable imports of Roman terra si gillata (and its imitation), of cameos and inta? glios, silver ware, small bronzes, etc. (R?par, Barod?, K?rvan, Kolh?pur, Arikamedu), occa? sional representations of Westerners at Amar?? vati and N?garjunikonda, and some sculptures inspired by Hellenistic models (Buddha head from Vrjiadarpuram near Vijayaw?da in the Musee Guimet, Yakshl relief from Amar?vati in the National Museum New Delhi, etc.), to some degree also the ? illusionist ? composi? tion of the later Amar?vati reliefs (53a). C) Gupta Empire (ca. 400-530 A.D.): Under Chandragupta II (ca. 378-414) a new temple type (S?nchi nos. 17 and 34, Tigowa, Udaypur in Malwa, Mahu? near N?rwar) in? spired by the Roman-Syrian temple (in antis, or prostylos) in its general plan as well as in most details (entrance frame with flat friezes and projecting lintel, image niches with gable, cornice, helical columns, indented entablatu? re, scrollwork, garlands, laurel wreaths, pearl chain garlands, lotus-petal frieze, yaksha and Gandharva friezes, pot-and-foliage capitals, pseudo abox ceiling?), further rich curled hair and wigs. On the other hand a national deve? lopment of this temple type since Kum?ragup ta I: square or transverse groundplan, sikhara or wagon roof, ceiling of intersecting slabs, porches in the four directions or circumambu lation passage, gav?ksha gables, Bhadramukha, amalgamation between Roman and earlier In? dian shrine door, independent evolution of the column mainly from the pilaster, mithuna couples and river goddesses, Hippocampi-ma karas, Bacchantes-Surasundaris (back view), flying Gandharva-mithunas. D) Later Gupta Period (ca. 530-750): Full development of the sikhara temple, some? times a crypta beneath the sanctuary, redupli cation of the friezes of the shrine entrance, dv?rap?las and dv?rap?lik?s, donors, the Na vagraha, cup-shaped fluted capital, Erotes ganas and klrtimukha. Big wigs; kumbha bandhana hair style of ladies. E) Kashmir Style (since Lalit?ditya, ca. 730-60) (54): New temple type (sometimes with lateral chapels) inspired from Roman Syria, Roman pilasters, steep triangular and capped (Gandh?ra) gables, niches on wall pi? lasters, genuine round and trefoil arch, box ceiling, a Roman ? pillars and colonnades, helical columns, (S?s?nian sun god), (early Christian) peacocks and doves. Already to? wards 750 loss of most specifically Roman features. F) Middle Ages : Disappearance of all evi? dently foreign innovations, however a certain admixture of Central-Asian barbarian motives (plaitwork ornament, often transformed into intertwined snakes; chessboard designs; disso? lution of the gavaksha and other motives into continuous abstract ornaments, etc.). Other? wise retention of all Gupta innovations, re? duced, however, more and more to subordinate components within new architectural and de? corative concepts. Let us summarize! After a first preparatory period, mainly under the Kush?nas, we find a mass absorption of pure late Roman types and motives under Chandragupta II, but since Kum?ragupta I also their quick Indianization and transformation in a development different from, indeed practically opposite to, the Hel? lenistic-Roman tradition, so that at the first impression nothing foreign can be discovered. Then a further infiltration of Roman and Near Eastern elements in the following two centuries, and at last another strong irruption of Roman architecture (but not sculpture) in the second quarter of the 8th century, now limited to Kashmiir (55). The Basic Problem: That foreign influence made itself felt at Mathur?, notwithstanding a strong national resistance, is not surprising. Nor is it surprising that it continued also after Chandragupta II. That it reached another floodlevel under Lalit?ditya is neither extraor? dinary, as Kashmir had been a frontier area formerly under Gandh?ra influence. But as at that time Gandh?ra art had so much de? clined (56) as to be unable to execute, alone, Lalit?ditya 's megalomaniac projects, the result 180</page><page sequence="29">was an eclectic style, of mixed Roman, late Gupta, even Chinese elements, and finally none of them, but Kashmiri. However, under Chandragupta II the Indian national renaissance was reaching its zenith, and it cannot have been lack of artists or ideas which suggested a recourse to foreign artistic inspirations. What seems more plau? sible is, first, the growing size of the build? ings, as Hindu shrines had hitherto been rather small. The other is the growing shortage of timber. For with it, the incongruity of a tech? nique imitating in stone a timber construc? tion which grew more and more impractic? able and therefore exceptional, became in? creasingly glaring. That for ca. seven to eight centuries stone buildings had continued to copy timber-construction, is intelligible only so long as wooden buildings were the rule, and those in stone merely more costly variants. Litera? ture shows in fact that, in the Sunga-K?nva period at least, forests still predominated, so that timber construction remained the cheaper and more common practice; this is confirmed by the sparseness of ruins of other brick or stone buildings this time than st?pas. But then, there followed half a millennium of foreign invasions, many of them by barba? rian nomads, or by nomadic cavalry in the service of more civilized invaders. However, it is a common experience that wars and de? forestation are closely interlinked, and espe? cially wars led by nomads, because nomads need open country for successful fighting, and moreover are careless with regard to land they never really occupy; whereas forests are the natural retreat of their opponents. At least of those times of which historical records are available, we have reliable evidence of syste? matic deforestation as an instrument of war (e.g. that of the Do?b by Fir?z Sh?h, of the K?ngr? Valley by Jah?nglr, etc.). Though from the Sanskrit texts it can be concluded that in the Gupta period India still had a suf? ficiency of forests, it seems probable that they had been so much reduced that timber was increasingly superseded by stone, and that an architecture based on brick and timber could no more be accepted as the natural, logical form of construction. The more so because a highly developed society would be more conscious of the defects of a wood style exe? cuted in stone, especially of its instability and fragility. It is therefore not surprising that in search of a more suitable style of construe tion Roman architecture commended itself; no less, that in an age of proud nationalism and of a fertile cultural development, these foreign loans were absorbed and nationalized as quickly as possible. Yet certain facts are curious. Already in Hellenistic times the arch had begun to play a role, and since the 2nd century, the vault and dome became prominent features in Me? diterranean architecture. Nothing would have been more natural than a transition from the imitation, in stone, of wooden arches and vaults to the construction of genuine stone arches and vaults. But, instead, arch and vault are practically absent in Gupta and Me? diaeval Hindu architecture. However, we should not forget that, if arch and vault were then used in the Roman world for certain spec? tacular show pieces like the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the imperial palaces, the metropo? litan thermae and basilicas, it is no less true that the overwhelming majority of buildings were still constructed in the trabeate style, and that also the great temples of Syria ? from where, as we have seen, most Roman influences on India had come ? were con? structed of columns and lintels (archs and niches being used rather sparsely, as a deco? ration of modest dimensions). As a matter of fact, the Syrian temples reveal the continua? tion of the Ancient Eastern pratice of using gigantic stone blocks as beams and ceilings, of dimensions and of a weight and in heights almost unbelievable to us. And just this very manner of covering rooms with huge stone slabs has been the practice in India since the Gupta period. This explains also the absence of real ? box ceilings ?; for also in Syria they had been purely decorative, without any struc? tural function. For this reason there is no need for the theory that the Hindu temple is a derivation from the dolmen, proposed by A. H. Lon ghurst, Stella Kramrisch and others. For South India this may be true in a few cases. But in those parts of Northern and Central India where the Gupta temple developed, the megalithic stone-chamber had never been used; the tumulus from which the st?pa had deve? loped, already belonged to a distant past; and even in the South the dolmen then was slowly dying out.

Foucher, L'Art Greco-Bouddhique de Gandh?ra, Paris 1950-51 ; G. Combaz, L'Inde et FOrient Classique, Paris 1937, etc. (2) J. Ph. Vogel, La Sculpture de Mathur?, Paris 1930, pis. 1-3.

They had been horsebreeding nomads, in contrast to the agricul? tural and town population of the valleys. As after the Hephthalite invasions they are no more mentioned, it seems that they became part of the ? G?rjara ? invaders settling in India in the 6th-7th centuries. (5) Probably these are the people with flat caps (like today in Hunza, Kul?, etc.) represented in the Mathur? and Gandh?ra sculptures, in contrast to the high pointed caps of the Scythians. (6) On a small scale known already in Gandh?ra art, see Sir John Marshall, Taxila, Cambridge 1951, pi. 214, nos. 22, 23. (7) J. Ph. Vogel, La Sculpture de Mathur?, Paris 1930, pis. 22 a, b, 36 c. They remind one of those of the palace of Diocletian at Spalato. Their direct prototype seems to be Parthian-Greek and is found also at Palmyra, cp. H.

(10) Even at Mathur? most buildings, as far as we can reconstruct them from the extant reliefs, still followed the wood style. (II) Many good observations in this respect have been collected in G. Combaz's valuable study, ? L'Inde et FOrient Classique ?, Paris (Musee Guimet) 1937 which has not found the attention it deserves, because of certain weak? nesses which at that time could not be avoided. Com? baz's book does not sufficiently distinguish between early Indian, Gandh?ran, Kush?na-Indian (Mathur?), Gupta, Kash? miri and Mediaeval art. Likewise its historical substructure is insufficient. In consequence it was, apparently, exposed to the suspicion of being one more of those premature classicist attempts at deriving all the arts of the world from the Greeks and Romans. But all civilizations, even the most original, have in their formative stage learnt much from others, and during their decadence handed on their heritage to others. Combaz himself has sufficiently empha? sized the independence and originality of the Indian reaction. (12) An echo in Cambodia Sambor Prei-Kuk no. 17, cp. H.
