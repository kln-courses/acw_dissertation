<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Iconography of Religions, by Albert C. Moore. 337 pp. 248 illustrations. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1977; $25.00. In this handsome volume Moore, associate professor in religious studies at the University of Otago, New Zealand, presents a brief but clear introduction to the whole nature of religious symbols, images and idols, and then leads the reader through an analysis of the iconographies of several diverse religious traditions. In each case the implicit questions he addresses are the same: (1) What are the gods or powers believed in and what "theology" is expressed in cultic images? (2) What is the iconography of the images and how did it develop? (3) What is the context of the image in its religious setting? (4) What is the experience of the worshipper? Moore is interested above all in the psychology of the worshipper as he or she relates to a given iconographic representation. He makes his discussions easy to follow, since most of the items he uses as examples are illustrated in the text, either with line-cuts or photographs. Moore first examines "primal religions," choosing as types the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe (cave art and the "Venus" figures), Australian Aboriginal (with a fine excursus on the "Dream Time"), Melanesia (masks) and Polynesia (wood carving). Although there is a special difficulty in interpreting the prehistoric material, all of these religious expressions are "primal in the sense that they are basic and persist in a variety of forms in the iconography of religions found in the great civilizations of world history." Ancient Egyptian and Greek iconography are contrasted as types of the "polytheistic"--the Egyptian being enduring, static, nation-oriented, suggesting otherness, while the Greek is changing, supranational, anthropomorphic. In the largest section of the book which is devoted to the Asian subcontinent and east (Hinduism, Buddhism in its various forms, Shintoism, etc.), Moore carefully traces the subtle changes in iconography from their most ancient manifestations, showing how the various traditions have influenced one another. Many will appreciate especially the lucidity Moore brings to these very complicated data. He classifies the Judaic and Islamic traditions as "prophetic iconoclasm," a phenomenon he attributes largely to the primacy of the word in these religions; but he notes that this tendency "has been periodically modified by man's need of the visual element." Finally Moore surveys the Christian material, contrasting East and West in the earlier periods, Protestantism and Catholicism in the later. He includes a particularly interesting discussion of the indigeniza- tion of Christian art in "mission" countries, especially in India. The book ends with the chapter "The End of Icono- graphy?". Moore sees individualism, the impact of the mass media and the growth of scientific technology as driving out symbolism and the felt need for religious iconography-a sort of ongoing demythologization process. Ultimately, however, he has some optimism for the future: "Does man ever transcend the use of all visual images?. . . Icons in religion derive from the basic fact that man has a body while seeking to transcend the body. Even when he transcends the image he still needs the image." WILLIAM J. FULCO, S.J.
