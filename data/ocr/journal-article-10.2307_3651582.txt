<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reflections on Hope as a Category of Social and Psychological Analysis Vincent Crapanzano CUNY Graduate Center In the few pages of the doctoral dissertation on sin and expiation that he man- aged to complete before his death in World War I, Emile Durkheim's student Robert Hertz (1988) struggled with the methodological and conceptual prob- lems of his project. Like Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, he wanted to delineate for comparative study a set of categories that were prevalent in European thought and of universal pretension. Were these categories in fact universal? Or were they the product of a particular level of social development? How could the two positions, both of which were more or less held by the Durkhe- imians, be reconciled? An evolutionary model, or rather orientation, offered a way out: it was, in fact, a cover story for what could not be reconciled on either conceptual or methodological grounds.' How could one study, for example, the nature of expiation in societies so different from 20th-century France that the very category was in question? How could a primordial notion of expiation, or sin, be identified? If it were identified, would this not suggest that there were, as Immanuel Kant had assumed, innate categories of the mind resistant to so- cial, or contingent, determination? Or were there universal features of social organization that were reflected in such categories? What would these features be? The question of definition troubled Hertz. After a long discussion of sin and expiation in Christianity in the introduction to his thesis (Hertz 1988:5-27), he noted how difficult it would be to avoid the deep penetration of these Chris- tian notions in any comparative study of religion. Hertz could offer only a weak methodological exit: To examine the facts without taking a position, a parti-pris, but with method. But can one? Hertz recognized, I believe, the im- possibility of the Durkheimian project. His own procedure, though not without contradiction, was rather more complex than that of the Durkheimians: it was more psychological or at least more experiential. The only means we have then is to proceed consciously as do the historians of in- stitutions in general. . . . Take as a term of comparison the notions of sin and ex- piation, constructed after the givens of our actual social experience; as we are aware of the necessary subjectivity of conceptions relative to a determined state of 3 Cultural Anthropology 18(1):3-32.

[Hertz 1988:43] Hertz, in fact, proposes a sort of hermeneutical cleansing (or bracketing, I am tempted to say, were it not too explicitly phenomenological) of our categories. I begin with Hertz's conceptual and methodological concerns because, though I take a different tack (one that is less dedicated to objective certainty than Hertz's), they are mine too, as I try to give possible shape to a notion of hope as a category of both experience and analysis. My aim is not to come up with a definition of hope nor to lay bare its structure the way, say, Jacques Lacan (1966: esp. 181, 268, 518) attempts to lay bare the structure of desire. My aim is more modest, tentative, and ethnographically reflexive. I want to delineate some of the parameters of what we take to be hope and to reflect on its possible usage in ethnographic and other cultural and psychological descriptions-in other words, to look critically (insofar as that is possible) at the discursive and metadiscursive range of "hope." My approach, then, is panoramic. I am not driven by a single argument. Indeed, I make many arguments, some of them di- gressive. I depend on the montage, on the disquiet produced by the juxtaposi- tion of events, images, and theories that are not easily coordinated. (Perhaps I exaggerate.) I want, in any case, to resist easy paraphrase. We have, as I have often argued, to recognize the blinkers imposed by the genres in which we write- in this case, the "essay."2 I am, of course, not doing justice to my position here. I ask you simply to follow my train of thought, which I hope will alert you to an aversion in our ap- proach to cultural and psychological description and interpretation. Insofar as I succeed, I will have accomplished one of the missions of ethnography that is, in my view, all too often forgotten in our quest for analytic understanding. We may call it technically, as the Russian formalist Victor Shklovsky (1992) did for the poetic, "defamiliarization" (ostrannenie), or more politically, as Brecht (1964) would have, a Verfremdungseffekt, an alienation effect. I do confess to an unrealistic allegiance to ethnography's critically creative potential insofar as, through defamiliarization, alienation, or self-distancing, it leads us (and no doubt in different fashions, the people we work with) to overcoming, or at least recognizing, social constriction and cultural blindness-ultimately, to a re- evaluation of our respective cultural presumptions. It seems to me that in our theorizing we have often lost sight of our pedagogic responsibilities-particularly those that can properly be called deconstructive-and that we risk, thereby, abrogating moral engagement. However great my skepticism-indeed, my cynicism-what I argue here is itself toned (inevitably, I should say) by a play between desire and hope. Throughout this article I will be using the complex (pluralizing and incor- porative) shifter "we" to refer quite deliberately to the position that is implicit in my own text and that, though read, interpreted, and classified by you, the readers, in one way (in fact, no doubt, in many ways), I, as author, inevitably understand in other ways. My use of "we" then is a deliberate aggression on</page><page sequence="4">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 5 my readers, at once appealing to them persuasively and estranging them from my position and, I hope, their own. I speak, however, from no single vantage point but through, among others, the often discordant authors and informants I cite. Naively, no doubt, I believe that I am simply calling attention to the pre- sumptive authorial positions of any ethnographer-or any writer, perhaps- that lie buried in institutionally determined conventions of writing and reading, the interpretation of voicing in any genre. When I began my research on hope, I discovered, to my surprise, that un- like desire, which has been a central focus in the social and psychological sci- ences, hope is rarely mentioned, and certainly not in a systemic or analytic way. R. R. Marrett's Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Society (1932), Er- nest Bloch's The Principle of Hope (1986), and Henri Desroche's The Sociol- ogy of Hope (1980), are exceptions.3 Marett (1932:28, 53) went so far as to claim that hope is the "mother-feeling in religion"-more basic even than fear in its foundation.4 Hope is implicit, however, in accounts of revolution and uto- pia and is more explicit in recent discussions of treating the dying patient (Good 1993; Good et al. 1990). Hope has, of course, been of concern to theolo- gians and philosophers. Along with faith and charity, it is a principal virtue in Christian theology. For the Catholics, it is an infused virtue, for it is said to be directly implanted in the soul by God. The Harvard theologian Paul Hanson (1981) features hope in his idea of a community of faith. It is the centerpiece of the German Protestant Jurgen Moltmann's (1967, 1970) theology of hope. Hope also figures in Jewish messianism and more generally in eschatological religions. Phenomenologists such as Heinrich Middendorf (1985) and Eugene Minkowski (1970) have taken great pains to describe what they take to be its intentional structure. We have to ask, why has a category of experience that we value so highly-and not just in religious terms-had only an incidental role in our ethnographic explorations and social and psychological understanding? Hope is certainly no more difficult to define than desire. Is it one of the rejects of our determined secularism? Perhaps, but I am not convinced. Has it rather to do with a passivism, a resignation, inherent in the notion of hope itself? One that runs counter to today's aggressive individualism or to a consumerism that cultivates an instant gratification that is at odds with the waiting time of hope? Or do we avoid it-or transform it-simply because it finally calls forth our mortality? The fact remains: hope, however understood, has been ignored. Let me outline my presentation. After introducing the notion of hope, I turn briefly to its understanding in Christian theology, which, despite our de- termined secularism, has provided many of the categories as well as provoked our resistance to many other categories in anthropology. I turn then to its phe- nomenological description, basing my analysis on the work of the pheno- menological psychologist Eugene Minkowski (1968, 1970). I offer a critique of the phenomenological position through a discussion of linguistic determi- nism of the Whorfian variety. I then look, in general theoretical terms, at possi- ble social determinants of hope such as consumerism. I refer principally to Ernst Bloch's The Principle of Hope (1986). I go on to discuss hope in terms of</page><page sequence="5">6 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY communicative etiquette, first with respect to the treatment of cancer patients and then, making reference to my own work among white South Africans, with respect to waiting and desire. I conclude by considering the role of hope and desire in cargo cults, noting that as individually lodged as we take them to be, both hope and desire have to be understood as precipitates of interaction or inter- locution. In Marius the Epicurean, Walter Pater wrote: "We need some imaginative stimulus, some not impossible ideal, such as may shape vague hope, and trans- form it into effective desire, to carry us year after year, without disgust, through the routine work which is so large a part of life" (1911, vol. 2:173). I quote, somewhat improbably, this Victorian aesthete, critic, and novelist, be- cause in a few words, he gives expression to several dimensions of hope as we usually understand it: "imaginative stimulus" (presumably from the real world), "some not impossible ideal," "vague hope," "effective desire," hope's carrying us through the "routine work" of life-curiously-"without disgust," and its potential transformation into desire. Pater's words are as important for what they do not include, that is, those things often associated with hope, namely, dreams, waking dreams, daydreams (remember, Aristotle said that "hope is a waking dream"); illusion; anticipation, expectation, and possibility; the future; patience and waiting; doubt, fear, and joy; revolution, utopia, and apocalypse; and a quantity of theological terms such as salvation, redemption, and of course, expiation.5 To these I would add realism and resignation.6 Hope is, Pater saw, intimately related to desire. It is its passive counter- part, though it is sometimes used as an equivalent to desire. Desire is effective. It presupposes human agency. One acts on desire-even if that act is not to act on desire because one has judged it impossible or prefers the desire to its ful- fillment (Girard 1985). Except where it is used as an equivalent to desire, hope depends on some other agency-a god, fate, chance, an other-for its fulfill- ment. Its evaluation rests on the characterization-the moral characteriza- tion-of that agency. You can do all you can to realize your hopes, but ulti- mately they depend on the fates-on someone else. I desire her. I hope she will desire me. I do what I can to bring about her desire, but finally there is a limit to what I can do. I can only hope. We might say, simplistically but revealingly, that although desire presumes a psychology, hope presupposes a metaphysics. Both require an ethics-of expectation, constraint, and resignation. And this ethics is founded on some notion or another of the real-on a realism that lim- its fantasy and its enactment. What Pater did not acknowledge was the temporal dimension of hope. It is rooted, in the West at least, in a temporality of meaning, one dimension of which-the dominant ideologically-is linear, teleological, and eschatological. As was made clear in my research (Crapanzano 2000:150-193) with conserva- tive American evangelicals who are given to an end-of-the-world theology, time is split between the immediate this-worldly and the distant though always</page><page sequence="6">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 7 imminent apocalypse. Hope figures in complex ways in this temporality. In its worldly manifestations, it may be quite specific, edging on desire, as when a lawyer hopes to win a case or a father hopes to have a daughter. Or it may be open ended, lacking final definition, vague (as Pater described it), and subject to chance. In Christianity, particularly among evangelicals, it rests on the promise of Christ's second coming. It is, in this sense, temporally bounded, though, despite endless predictions, the time of Christ's return remains uncer- tain. It demands a particular take on reality. Jiirgen Moltmann, who stresses the disjunction between hope and experience ("between the resurrection and the cross"), puts it this way: The truth of doctrinal statements is found in the fact that they can be shown to agree with the existing reality which we can all experience. Hope's statements of promise, however, must stand in contradiction to the reality which can at present be experienced. They do not result from experience, but are the condition for the possibility of new experience. They do not seek to illuminate the reality which ex- ists, but the reality which is coming. They do not seek to make a mental picture of existing reality, but to lead existing reality toward the promised and hoped-for transformation. They do not seek to bear the train of reality, but to carry the torch be- fore it. In so doing, they give reality a historic character. [ 1967:18, emphasis added] This is not the place to pursue Moltmann's eschatological theology. We should note, though, that he wrote his magnum opus, The Theology of Hope, in the sixties. It reflects at once the revolutionary utopian spirit of the time and an essentially Calvinist worldview that decries "the infinite misery" of experien- tial reality and the paralytic despair of those without faith. Unlike those evan- gelicals who reduce their social responsibility to converting the "unborn," Moltmann stresses the changes that hope can induce: [Hope] takes seriously the possibilities with which all reality is fraught. It does not take things as they happen to stand or to lie, but as progressing, moving things with possibilities of change. Only as long as the world and the people in it are in a frag- mented and experimental state which is not yet resolved, is there any sense of earthly hopes. The latter anticipate what is possible to reality, historic and moving as it is, and use their influence to decide the processes of history. Thus hopes and anticipations of the future are not a transfiguring glow superimposed upon a dark- ened existence, but are realistic ways of perceiving the scope of our real possibili- ties, and as such they set everything in motion and keep it in a state of change. Hope and the kind of thinking that goes with it consequently cannot submit to the reproach of being utopian, for they do not strive after things that have "no place" but after things that have "no place as yet" but can acquire one. [1967:25] This view of hope couples a realism, as rhetorical and Calvinist as it may be, with a sense of the future (as an advent, Zukunft, avenir) that, whatever Molt- mann's own political and social commitment, can be coordinated with notions of social change, progress, and even revolution. His disparaging use of utopia refers to those utopias-Robert Musil calls them "utopias of realism"-whose stress on "stark facts" is so great that they are ultimately incapable of recogniz- ing the historic character of reality and become fully static.</page><page sequence="7">8 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Like other Christians, evangelicals distinguish between hope for salva- tion, which for some of them, the Pentecostalists in particular, becomes a cer- tainty with being reborn, and the petty hopes that characterize everyday life. They frequently refer to a passage in Paul's letter to the Romans: "For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for. But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with pa- tience wait for it" (Rom. 8:24-25 Authorized Version). Though Paul dismisses everyday hopes, they are of concern to the evan- gelicals with whom I worked, who are for the most part a very practical people. Their hope for salvation puts their petty hopes in perspective by figuring them in redemptive history. It does not infuse their petty hopes, however, as some variant of neo-Platonic theology might have it. Nor does it demand the reorien- tation toward reality that Moltmann's theology proposes. It is not open, as it is for Catholics, to material things insofar as they are a means to reach the su- preme end of human life. As Calvinists, evangelicals live in a world in which salvation cannot be achieved through good works. The split between worldly activities and the determination of one's salvation is absolute, predetermined, lying only in the hands of God. The evangelicals moralize Paul's distinction. They distinguish between true and false hope. False hope is uncertain. It is based on what is pleasurable and desirable in human terms, on a denial of reality, on mystical or magical thinking, on an unbiblical view of prayer, or on an improper interpretation of Scripture. I am paraphrasing the writings of Wayne Mack (1994), who teaches biblical counseling in Los Angeles. True hope comes with salvation and re- quires daily renewal through prayer, Bible study, and the application of bibli- cal precepts to daily life. It is a realistic choice-we can choose to be hopeful or without hope. The realism demanded seems at times-to the outsider-brutal. As Jay Adams (1970:139), a leading counselor, puts it: To tell people they are sick (Adams is speaking here of homosexuality, which he regards as sinful) is not to give them hope. To tell them that homosexuality is sinful gives them hope, for they know (if they are "Christians") that their sins will be redeemed by Christ. Mack, who is gentler, quotes from the Psalms: "I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope" (Ps. 130:5)-for forgiveness, mercy, and plenteous redemption. True hope is not a speculative hope but a "believing" one, secured by God's promises as they are made manifest through the correct reading of his Word. It is an assured hope, an expectation. Mack gives an example: "We say, 'I hope my friend comes to visit tomorrow.' But the biblical meaning of the word hope is different-it is more like 'I know my friend is coming over tomorrow, and I can't wait to see him' " (Mack 1984:194). To the outsider at least, "true hope," however urgent, however be- lieved in, offering whatever succor, can fuel a rhetoric of deflection that has enormous political and economic potential.</page><page sequence="8">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 9 In Lived Time (1970), the psychiatrist Eugene Minkowski examines desire and hope (espoir) phenomenologically, from within the structure of temporal experience.' Hope and desire are characteristic of that zone of experienced time that Minkowski calls the "mediate future." It lies between the zone of the immediate future, characterized by expectation and activity, and the zone of the remote future, characterized by prayer and ethical action.8 As opposed to activity and expectation, which Minkowski associates with joy and terror, he finds both desire and hope to be positive. "We are charmed by hope," he ob- serves, "because it opens the future broadly before us."9 Both desire and hope have, perhaps, to be understood, as Heidegger understood them, in terms of "something still outstanding," which he regarded as an essential characteristic of care (Sorge)-of human life.'0 Desire, for Minkowski, surpasses as it contains activity. It is fuller; it looks further into the future than activity to the plus loins, the beyond. It is more intimately connected with the ego than mere activity. "In desire there is a withdrawal in relation to activity, a withdrawal to the intimate me, toward the interior, toward the inside of the active ego" (Minkowski 1970:98). Unlike ac- tivity, which can go only from object to object, desire enables us to settle on something. It is more episodic than activity. Hope shares the same direction as expectation-toward the future-present. It penetrates further into the future than expectation (attente). It is more ample, more full of promise. "It separates us from immediate contact with ambient becoming; it suppresses the embrace of expectation and permits me to look freely, far into lived space which now opens up before me" (1970:100). Minkowski continues: "I have an intimation of all that could be in the world beyond the immediate contact which expecta- tion achieves between becoming and the ego" (1970:100). I am put into contact with a becoming that is unfolding at a distance. This suggests to me that there is a transcending quality about hope. Hope allows me to take refuge in myself in order to see life unfold around me." Minkowski puts it this way: "Desire contains activity within itself, while hope liberates us from anxious expectation" (1970:101). And, yet, it holds us breathless. Unlike desire, which is continu- ous, hope assumes a moment of arrest. For Minkowski, prayer and ethical action are, as I have said, characteristic of the zone of the remote future. Prayer is for him a life structure, a temporal attitude. It requires neither a man nor a god. It is both a movement inward ("a totally lived interiorization") and an exteriorization ("a totally lived extrospec- tion") (1970:107). For, "in springing up from the depths of my being, it goes beyond the universe" (1970:107). In prayer we lift ourselves up above our- selves and all that surrounds us and turn our eyes to the distance, toward an in- finite horizon, toward a sphere beyond time and beyond space, a sphere full of grandeur and clarity but also mystery" (1970:103). Minkowski adds, impor- tantly, "We can then replace this mystery with the idea of an active divinity. But this idea is not in any way originally included in the phenomenon of prayer, which, far from affirming whatever it may be from this point of view,</page><page sequence="9">10 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY above all puts a problem before us" (1970:103). In other words, the postulation of a god would be an "empirical question"-a culturally or historically deter- mined symbolization for mystery.12 Is prayer-or, as I prefer, the prayerful-wholly different from hope? Can a line be drawn between mediate and remote time? Or do they fade into each other? I would argue, were I to accept Minkowski's approach, that prayer, as a life structure, is a necessary horizon of all hope. Hope, particularly in its abstract form, always invokes an ever further horizon-a beyond of a mysterious, tran- scending ( if not transcendental), nature. We may call it divine, but despite our yearning, we can never really know it. Prayer may be idealized as a feature of Minkowski's "remote future," but all futures proclaim a horizon, a beyond, a that-which-is-not-yet-reachable, an unreachable, an unknown of which we have an inkling, and an unknown of which we have no inkling, only the dubious cer- tainty of its existence. (It can be described only with an oxymoron.) We can take a prayerful attitude toward it, but that attitude is immediately reduced, if not de- stroyed, the moment we pray, as inevitably we do, to someone or something-a god or a transcendent force-for something. The concreteness, the specificity, of our interlocutor or the subject of our prayers diminishes the horizon, drawing attention away from it. This "empirical reduction" of the prayerful attitude to prayer-to-and-for reveals the fragile nature of the prayerful. Despite phenome- nology's universalist claims, it is (or ought to be taken as, if only for critical heuristic reasons) a culturally specific, highly romantic idealization, an idealiza- tion that masks its fragility, its ephemerality, or indeed, its artifice. Minkowski ignores the implications of the empirical reduction of the prayerful, but they have enormous consequence for those, at any rate, who share his vision of prayer and the temporality it presupposes. In a manner not dissimilar to the play between the concrete and abstract objects of hope, the prayerful and prayer-to-and-for are implicated one with the other. It is as though the second depends on the first for its power. This dynamic of rhetori- cal empowerment also occurs, I believe, in the alternation of two conceptions of God among, say, Christians: an abstract one that resists description (or can only be described as the pseudo-Dionysius and negative theology argues, through negative attributes) and a concrete, relatively anthropomorphic one so often depicted in Christian art and literature.'3 I believe we often find a similar oscillation between a concrete and an ab- stract conception of prayer's object. It could be argued that the focus on the con- crete object is a way of defending oneself (or taking pleasure in the beyond- the awe, the dread it may well inspire, the sublime). Though I do not want to stress such psychological-functional explanations (or their rhetorical equiva- lent), I must point out that in their studies of prayer and magic, anthropologists have tended to focus on their concrete object and the instrumentality that arises from such a focus rather than on the metaphysics that prayer and magic presup- pose, the horizon they postulate, and the mystery they call forth.</page><page sequence="10">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 11 I find it gratuitous to assume that a Hopi who knows only the Hopi language and the cultural ideas of his own society has the same notions, often supposed to be intui- tions, of time and space that we have, and that are generally assumed to be universal. In particular, he has no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing con- tinuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of future, through a present, into a past; or, in which, to reverse the picture, the observer is be- ing carried in the stream of duration continuously away from a past into a future. -Benjamin Lee Whorf, Language, Thought, and Reality Minkowski's work, like that of other phenomenologists, has to be treated with caution, for it takes into consideration neither the linguistic nor the cul- tural determination of the experience being described-of description itself. We have to remember that phenomenology is the product of a particular cul- tural era that gives, for example, evidential priority to the individual, inner ex- perience, consciousness, and a particular take on language that at once recog- nizes and denies its formative specificity. Whatever his take on language, the phenomenologist describes experience as if the language he is using is trans- parent. He brackets, so he insists, the natural (empirical) attitude in order to at- tain the pure structures of consciousness, without seeming to recognize that the natural attitude-the way we discriminate and evaluate ordinary objects and events-is embedded in his language of description. His position requires that we assume that the structures and categories of language are universal-a posi- tion that can be contested, at certain levels at least, on empirical grounds-or that the structures and categories of consciousness somehow shine through the specific language in which they are described. This is equally contestable. Can we assume that the structures of time that Minkowski postulates are universal? Immune to linguistic influence? Can we assume that desire and hope, as he describes them, are translinguistic, transcultural, and transhistori- cal?14 I am not arguing that language determines perception-it may or it may not-but rather that it affects the articulation of experience and, thereby, the theories we generate from such experiences. How we relate the articulation of experience to subjective experience is altogether problematic. It depends, for one, on how we understand representation. Remember, representations of ex- perience may be purely rhetorical, as they often were in baroque literature or in the writings of mystics of roughly the same period whose obsession was with ways of speaking-"el modo de hablar en las cosas espirituales" (the way of speaking about spiritual things), as the Alumbrados of Spain put it."1 They were entrapped within their own eloquence. Their aim was effectiveness, not representational accuracy (though they sometimes exploited "representational accuracy" rhetorically). Wittgenstein's skepticism is perhaps in order here. We must recognize in our reading and interpretation the burden of subjectivity that our romantic forebears have bequeathed us and from which we have by no means freed ourselves. We must not assume that depictions of mental life necessarily</page><page sequence="11">12 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY refer to conditions of mental life that resemble the depictions. But we must not forget the evocative-the creative-function of language either. Minkowski's description of hope rests on a division of time that correlates with the tense structure of Indo-European languages-indeed, with tense struc- ture itself. Time is conceived, as Benjamin Lee Whorf noted, "as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future, through a present, into a past." It is one-dimensional, vec- torial, divisible, quantifiable, and measurable.16 Could a speaker of a language that had a different tense structure or no tense structure describe hope as Min- kowski does? How would a Papua-New Guinean articulate (if not experience) "hope" if his language, like so many Papuan languages, has more than one fu- ture "tense," and those "tenses" are distinguished not only by temporal "dis- tance" but by status?17 For example, how would the Fore describe hope? They distinguish grammatically between a definite future, in which events are ex- pected to occur, and a dubitative future, in which the occurrence of events is in doubt. Or the Yimas? Like the Fore, they have two future tenses (one for to- morrow; one for beyond tomorrow), but their entire tense system can be detem- poralized by substituting for tense- ("time") indicating suffixes an irrealis one.'" Or speakers of Angaatha? Their verbs mark status ("real" and "unreal"), and those that mark the real also indicate past or present; the future is always expressed by the irrealis, not by tense. No doubt Whorf is the most influential proponent in anthropology of the role of grammar in the articulation of experience. His linguistic relativism (if that is the appropriate way to characterize his work) continues to challenge the universalists, as well as those particularists who prefer to ignore the difficul- ties, if not the impossibility, of "full" translation.'9 In his well-known 1936 es- say "An American Indian Model of the Universe," Whorf (1956:57-86) relates Hopi notions of "time" and "space" to their grammar.20 Here, I will focus on the Hopi use of tense, recognizing, however, that, as Whorf insisted, no single set of grammatical features of language can be taken to determine that lan- guage' s outlook on a specific theme such as time. Whorf notes that Hopi has no tenses-no tenses, at any rate, that resemble ours. Hopi contains no words, grammatical forms, constructions or expressions that refer directly to what we call "time," or to past, present, or future, or to enduring or lasting, or to motions as kinematic rather than dynamic (i.e., as a continuous translation in space and time rather than an exhibition of dynamic effort in a certain process), or that even refer to space in such a way as to exclude that element of extension or ex- istence that we call "time," and so by implication leave a residue that could be re- ferred to as "time." [1956:57-58] Despite their take, or nontake, on time, Whorf insists that the Hopi are fully ca- pable of describing and accounting for all observable phenomena in the uni- verse. In the Whorfian spirit, we might want more accurately to say, "in their universe," for that universe is their construction. Whorf himself would prob- ably find this phrasing too idealist; he remained, despite himself, always an</page><page sequence="12">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 13 empiricist. Just as we have several equally adequate geometries for describing spatial configurations, he argues, so can we have different but equally valid de- scriptions of the universe: ours, say, or the Hopi's, or that of relativity theory, for example. As Whorf sees it, the Hopi impose on the world two "grand cosmic forms" that correlate with their grammar: the manifested (the objective) and the mani- festing or unmanifested (the subjective). The former "comprises all that is or has been accessible to the senses, the historical physical universe, in fact, with no attempt to distinguish between present and past, but excluding everything that we call future" (Whorf 1956:59). The latter includes all that we call future, which the Hopi take to be "more or less predestined in essence if not exact form," as well as all that we call mental: everything that appears or exists in the mind, or, as the Hopi would prefer to say, in the heart, not only the heart of man, but the heart of animals, plants, and things, and behind and within all forms and appearances of nature in the heart of nature, and by an implication and extension which has been felt by more than one anthro- pologist, yet would hardly ever be spoken of by a Hopi himself, so charged is the idea with religious and magical awesomeness, in the very heart of the Cosmos it- self. [1956:59-60] The subjective realm-"intensely real and quivering with life, power, and po- tency"-is characterized by "the striving of purposeful desire, intelligent in character, toward manifestation-a manifestation which is much resisted and delayed, but in some form or other is inevitable" (1956:60). It is the realm of expectancy, "of thought thinking itself out" from the heart into manifestation (1956:60). It is dynamic, not in our sense, which always involves motion, but in an eventuating way, as evolving by degrees that which is already with us (and not coming to us out of the future) into the manifest, or objective. In- cluded in the manifesting is that part of our present that refers to that which is beginning to be done, like falling asleep, but is not yet in full operation: the moment of inception. It is indicated by a special verb form, the expective, which correlates with another verb form, the inceptive, which refers to a start- ing, to the emergent edge of the manifested, when "cause"-the eventuating of the manifesting-begins to end. Were we to correlate our metaphysical terminology with that of the Hopi, Whorf notes, we could probably speak of the subjective realm as the realm of hope and hoping. The Hopi verb tunditya, usually translated as "hope" (or more adequately, as "it is in the action of hoping," "it hopes," "it is hoped for," or "it thinks or is thought of with hope") includes something of our notions of "thought," "desire," and "cause." It refers to a "mental-causal activity, which is forever pressing upon and into the manifested realm" (Whorf 1956:62). The Hopi see "this burgeoning activity" everywhere: in the growing of plants, the forming of clouds and their condensation as rain, the careful planning out of the communal activities of agriculture and architecture, and in all human hoping, wishing striving, and taking thought; and as most especially</page><page sequence="13">14 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY concentrated in prayer, the constant hopeful praying of the Hopi community, as- sisted by their exoteric communal ceremonies and their secret, esoteric rituals in the underground kivas-prayer which conducts the pressure of the collective Hopi thought and will out of the subjective into the objective. [1956:62] Whorf notes that the inceptive form of tundtya-tundtyava-does not mean "begins to hope" but "comes true, being hoped for." The inceptive form, then, of the root verb "to hope," which best describes the subjective, ends up denot- ing the first appearance of the objective. One might say, Whorf concludes, with unusual flourish, that as the distinction between the two great cosmic forms- the objective and the subjective, the manifest and the manifesting-rest on an inflectional difference, they are simply two aspects of one reality.21 Must we dismiss phenomenology's universalist claims? Must we see it as describing language-specific experience? As a product of a particular cultural moment? Can we correlate, in any but a trivial sense, Minkowski's pheno- menological description of hope with (Whorf' s depiction of) the Hopi tundtya? Is it even possible to translate tundtya into English? As "hope"? In raising these questions, I am not claiming that there are no linguistic universals. There undoubtedly are, at some level, as Whorf himself recognized. But it seems to me that at more superficial levels, the often dramatic differences among lan- guages do challenge the universalist claims of phenomenological description. We must be careful not to dismiss Whorf's translation as false any more than accept it as accurate, thereby avoiding, in either case, the implications of his theory. We have to acknowledge its approximation and the possibilities it evokes. The power of translation rests not only on semantic accuracy, which our insistence on the referential priority of language leads us to, but on our rec- ognition of its approximation, its tentativeness (some might say its inevitable failure) and the power of that approximation, tentativeness, and failure to evoke a beyond-another understanding-that we can never fully grasp but have, as best we can, to catch and catch again and again. A translation, so long as it is known as such, resists the fixity of the original (which is itself question- able) and demands of us, more dramatically perhaps than the original, an ac- knowledgement of the historicity-the mutations-of meaning (and indeed, of translation itself, its readings), which we are wont to dismiss, if only because of the disturbances such an acknowledgement causes us. Translation represents on a minimal stage the by no means minimal role of power in the establishment and maintenance of meaning.22 Taken as such, translation is wondrous-and dangerous. For all those simpletons, the imperfection of man results only from flaws in society; it's altogether natural, then, for them to place their crazy hope in a revolution. If they were to see things as they are .... That man is a dirty beast and that there is nothing to be done about it .... Every social regime is fatally condemned to reflect</page><page sequence="14">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 15 what is irremediably bad in human nature. .... Then, what' s the good of running a risk of an upheaval. -Antoine, in Roger Martin du Gard's Summer 1914 Whatever its linguistic determinants, hope, like desire, is itself embedded within historically and culturally specific understanding. Ernst Bloch (1986) makes this point, particularly in his discussion of hope and bourgeois society. (He is, however, despite his position, given to universalist, value-laden images of hope and desire, which he tends to conflate.) In his sociology, he lays em- phasis on the category of the not-yet on a forward-looking temporality. He ar- gues that we all live in the future because we strive. Past things come only later. A "genuine present" is almost never there. The future dimension contains what is feared or hoped for; as regards human in- tention, that is, when it is not thwarted, it contains only what is hoped for. Function and content of hope are experienced continuously, and in times of rising societies they have been continuously activated and extended. Only in times of a declining old society, like modern Western society, does a certain partial and transitory in- tention run exclusively downward. Then those who cannot find their way out of the decline are confronted with fear of hope and against it. Then fear presents itself as the subjectivist, nihilism as the objectivist mask of the crisis phenomenon: which is tolerated but not seen through, which is lamented but not changed. [Bloch 1986:4] For the bourgeois, Bloch goes on polemically, change is impossible even if it is desired: "Bourgeois interest would like to draw every other interest opposed to it into its own failure so, in order to drain the new life, it makes its own agony apparently fundamental, apparently ontological" (1986:4).23 But bourgeois emptiness is as ephemeral as the class it expresses. "Hopelessness is itself, in a temporal and factual sense, the most insupportable thing, downright intoler- able to human needs," Bloch insists (1986:4-5). I must note, contra Bloch, the extraordinary resilience humans have to the insupportable, to hopelessness and despair. Think of the hope-in-hopelessness, as magical as it appear to be, of the prisoners in Auschwitz, of the millions in Africa who are being destroyed by starvation and internecine war, and of the tribal peoples of the Amazon who face extinction because of a few thousand acres of forest. Of course, Bloch is not speaking of such societies. From their perspective, his preoccupations seem indulgent-the product of the very class he decries. Without hope (as he sees it) the bourgeois must, nevertheless, preach hope from every pulpit. They confine it, however, to "mere inwardness," to "empty promises of the other world" (1986:5). Bloch's self-imposed task is, I suppose, to reinstill a sense of hope-of real possibility-rather than vacuous promise. My own bourgeois cynicism tells me that, in his aspiration, Bloch is in the same position as his bourgeois preachers, holding out paradise (read, "uto- pia"). As reactionary and paralyzing (and as symptomatic of Bloch's depiction of the bourgeois attitude toward change) as it is, the cynicism of the character Antoine Thibault in Roger Martin du Gard's Summer 1914 (1964:178) seems</page><page sequence="15">16 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY at times more appropriate (certainly more realistic) than the pacifism and revo- lutionary utopia that Antoine's brother, Jacques, preaches. In his novel, Martin du Gard catches the two brothers up in an endless debate that can have no reso- lution. Both die in the Great War, under very different circumstances.24 Per- haps it is in such debate that real bourgeois paralysis lies. Hope (or should I write "hope"?) is simply bandied about rhetorically. But so is it by firebrands calling for revolution and wars of liberation. The hope they proffer, as catching as it may be, is also, perhaps inevitably, delusive. I should note an obsolete meaning of delude: "to frustrate the hopes and plans of." However deeply we locate hope in the hearts and minds of individuals, we have to recognize its in- terlocutory use and the way that use can swing back with deforming force on those hearts and minds. Despite my cynicism, I have yet to confess to the in- domitable allure of utopian, indeed revolutionary, possibility, which I (like you) am reluctant to reduce to one socioeconomic formation or another. Bona denique spes cum omnium rerum desperatione confligit [Good hope strives with despair of all things]. -Cicero, In Catilinam Hope, or its expression at least, has important interlocutory dimensions and is subject to an often highly moralized, culturally determined communica- tive etiquette. Mary-Jo DelVecchio Good and her colleagues have looked at the way oncologists at Harvard Medical School understand the role of hope in their treatment of cancer patients. Though the physicians were, for the most part, skeptical of the role of hope in actually altering the progress of the dis- ease, they did recognize its importance for their patients. One oncologist put it this way: Yes, I think people eat better, work harder to live, and feel better about themselves if they are encouraged and given hope. I think I saw it more clearly when I was in training and had the opportunity to see patients of many different doctors-some of whom were pretty pessimistic. And what they thought-they were brutally hon- est with their patients and their patients would give up. And others who were able to let their patients know that they'd be with them through whatever happened, and they'd support them. Whatever happened, they didn't have to worry about pain or discomfort. Those patients were able to go on living for whatever time they had, much better. And I think, often a bit longer for it, but it's hard to prove. [Good et al. 1990:71] A second said: "We sprinkle as much hope on a situation as we can" (1990:72). A third referred to himself as his patients' "cheerleader." "I've got to be their cheerleader," he said (1990:72). Was he referring here simply to the needs of his patients or to his own? Can the two be separated? Certainly, many of the oncologists recognized the importance of hope-of instilling hope in their patients-for themselves.</page><page sequence="16">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 17 I don't think it [hope] makes a biological difference, but it certainly makes a dif- ference in your outlook and the way you live the rest of your life. And ... I think if you don't have hope that what you're going to do is going to make a difference then you really . .. this is probably the wrong field ... I just think it's such a fun- damental thing to have that I couldn't imagine somebody not have it and being an oncologist, to tell you the truth. [Good et al. 1990:73] Like their patients, the oncologists avoided talk of their own mortality (and the continual reminder of it that their patients' illnesses and deaths must have pro- duced). At least in the excerpts published by Good, they avoided all talk of de- spair and hopelessness. They tended to justify their position on biomedical grounds without much moral probing. Ought they to instill hope? False hope? Unrealistic hope? To what extent did their own hope-their wished-for hope- color their "realistic" evaluation of the treatment situation and lead them to en- courage a hopeful attitude in their patients? Where does treatment and care end and moral presumption begin? Biomedical grounds, however pressing, seem to serve a rhetorical function, permitting a defensive evasion of troubling ques- tions of morality and mortality. Good's published research rests on the oncologists' description and re- flection of the role of hope in their treatment of patients. One wonders how these descriptions and reflections differ from actual practice. To what extent does hope configure the relationship between doctor and patient? Care and treatment? Can we isolate the doctor-patient relationship from other medical relationships? Doctors have been known, after all, to maintain very impersonal relationships with their patients, particularly their dying patients, while not altogether unconsciously letting nurses and other caretakers instill hope. Cer- tainly, hope figures in often awkward ways in the exchanges in informed-consent interviews between medical researchers and dying patients who are asked to try experimental drugs. These interviews are subject to strict protocols that, as I understand them, are designed among others things to preclude the researchers' making unrealistic promises and instilling irrational hope in the patients. The patients, of course, however realistic, are rarely fully immune to hope; nor is the researcher. Each patient hopes to be cured, hopes his or her cure will be medically significant, and hopes, indeed, that the researcher's hopes will be fulfilled; the researcher hopes the patient will accept the treatment, hopes the treatment will be successful, hopes the patient will be cured, and hopes then to fulfil the patient's hopes. Together, the researcher and the patient have to avoid hopelessness as they are forced to ignore, or at least limit, hope. Hope can never be fully divorced from hopelessness any more than hopelessness can be divorced from hope. I left South Africa because I couldn't stand the waiting any longer for something, anything, to happen. -"Carl," a white South African</page><page sequence="17">18 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Although Bloch and most theologians who discuss it stress the optimism of hope, hope can in fact lead to paralysis. One can be so caught up in one's hope that one does nothing to prepare for its fulfillment. As paradoxical as it sounds, paralyzing hope can occur in certain depressive conditions. One hopes-one waits-passively for hope's object to occur, knowing realistically that its occurrence is unlikely, even more so because one does nothing to bring it about. One may argue that there is simply nothing to be done but hope and that any activism is delusional. One may justify one's position through various moral-philosophical stances such as resignation, skepticism, stoicism, or cyni- cism. Of course, activist stances toward hope may also be justified on moral-philosophical grounds: philosophies of optimism, which stress "the power of positive thinking" and the effectiveness of optimism itself, see hope (as Richard Snyder, America's latest hope guru, does) as "a way of thinking about goals in your life-believing that you can define those goals, find routes to reach them and perceive yourself as having the motivation to use those path- ways."25 Hope can be measured (Snyder claims), it leads to success, and best of all, it can be taught and learned. I saw waiting-induced paralysis among white South Africans in the last years of apartheid.26 Bloch would stress their bourgeois attitude. There, as "Carl" described it, many of them were simply "waiting for something, any- thing, to happen." They could not think themselves out of the situation in which they found themselves. Even if they had had a solution, which they had not (at least, not one they could take seriously), they could not act. They simply waited. They were caught in the structure of waiting. What they hoped for was a solution-something they could not envisage. They had a hope so indefinite as not to have an identifiable object. As such, they could not turn it into effec- tive desire. Yes, of course, they wanted to survive. They wanted to preserve their wealth and the status quo ante, which they, filled with nostalgia, ideal- ized, but they also knew that this was in all likelihood impossible. They were realists. They were overcome with thoughts of a coming bloodbath. They had end-of-the-world fantasies. Many attended churches that stressed the Apoca- lypse and personal salvation. (However, even the Fundamentalists among them, were, I should note, less given to discussing the details of the Apoca- lypse than are American Fundamentalists, who argue over the millennium, Christ's return, and the time of rapture. Perhaps the elaboration of these end-of- the-world scenarios, as otherworldly as they are, resonated too closely with the troubling world they found themselves in. Their salvation was, after all, at stake.) The whites were afraid, and clearly, their fear intensified their waiting, their ill-defined hope. (Spinoza says that "fear cannot be without hope nor hope without fear" [1930:252].) The whites found refuge, I believe, in this sus- tained and indefinable waiting. They were removed; they were not responsible. This was important. They had given themselves up to a fate that was, so it seemed to me (perhaps like all visions of fate in situ), empty. They lived in the ethereal, as the phenomenological psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger (1958:314-315; 277-290) might have characterized it. It was a world of desire,</page><page sequence="18">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 19 hope, longings, fantasies, and dreams. It was removed from the real, and it of- fered them solace as they continued in very real and pragmatic terms to live their lives as they always did. Their ethereal, their dreams and longings, re- sisted definition. Oddly, their clinging to the practicalities of everyday material life was more than a sign of their self-interested materialism, their brutal prag- matism, as most of their critics asserted (and as they themselves might at times have agreed, if pressed). However real or pragmatic it was, that realism, that prag- matism, became a sort of magic. It enabled them, if not to overcome what they saw as inevitable-the loss of life, wealth, and well-being-then to remain in the waiting for something, anything, to happen. Hope, I wrote at the time, "is the field of desire in waiting" (Crapanzano 1985:45). It is indeed beautiful to see a person put out to sea with the fair wind of hope; one may utilize the chance to let oneself be towed away, but one ought never have it on board one's craft, least of all as pilot, for it is an untrustworthy shipmaster. For this reason, too, hope was one of Prometheus's dubious gifts; instead of giving human beings the foreknowledge of the immortals, he gave them hope. -Soren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Hope and desire are always in uneasy relationship. Bloch's conflation of the two is by no means unusual. As I have noted, we often use hope to mean de- sire. We are less prone, I believe, to use desire for hope, though we sometimes do. That the social and psychological sciences have ignored "hope," both as a descriptive and an analytic category, suggests mistrust. We find it, as Kierkegaard warns us, "an untrustworthy shipmaster."27 As well as leading to inaction, as in waiting, it can lead us astray through inaction (as it did among those white South Africans who preferred waiting to, for better or worse, act- ing) and through the distortion of our sense of reality by offering us unlikely possibilities. That desire can also promote false objects suggests that our mis- trust of hope is rooted less in its production of false objects than in the inaction, the resignation, and the passivity that hope can promote-through the produc- tion of these objects, among other ways. As such, hope bucks the activism (call it "agency") that founds our understanding of social action and that we, most blatantly in America, value. The categories of social and psychological analy- sis can never be fully divorced, despite the deconstructive force of the best of our ethnographies, from the structures and values of the society in which they are elaborated. Whether we give primacy to desire or hope, we have, in either case, to rec- ognize the way their objects reflect as they precipitate a certain take on the world. Good (1991; Good et al. 1990) notes, for example, that hope, as it fig- ures among American oncologists, is grounded in popular conceptions of the relationship between mind and body and modes of disclosure-and no doubt attitudes toward treatment. It coordinates, I would add, with the status and authority of the doctor in America's "classless" society. It can certainly be re- lated to American notions of progress and success. The objects of hope and desire</page><page sequence="19">20 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY are always more than themselves. They are multimeaning symbols that have, in linguistic terms, enormous pragmatic force. They evoke a world, a society, a moral order, a psychology. Analysts of the cargo cult distinguish two dimen- sions of the "kago" the natives long for and, without any understanding of its manufacture and distribution, attempt to manifest by magical or ritual means (Lindstrom 1993:51 ff.). Cargo, we are told, refers at once to the material ob- jects the cultists desire-say, the proverbial refrigerator-and to a new moral, social, and cultural order in which these objects figure. The analysts refer to the former as "cargo" with a small c and the latter as "Cargo" with a capital C. I will have more to say about these cults below. Here I want only to note that in such an analysis Cargo constitutes the world of its assumption just as cargo de- nies its symbolic-evocative, its pragmatic, dimension by emphasizing its real, concrete quality. After all, it is not the universe that is desired, it is the object- the refrigerator. This understanding reflects, I believe, the consumer's partial under- standing of the products he desires. In consumer society, however, the object is doubly indexical. The refrigerator is not any refrigerator but a refrigerator dis- tinguished by design, label, and cost. As such, as any but the most naive or de- fensive consumer knows, the refrigerator, say a Sub-Zero, indexes the social and economic status of its owner. Quality, of course, justifies the choice; need, the purchase. One needs a good refrigerator, not the status it conveys. What is usually ignored is the fact that the refrigerator also indexes the consumer world, the production of desire (understood often enough as "need"), and the parameters of choice that permit, within limits, self-expression. It is the second indexical process, from which a political and economic critique might be de- veloped, that is masked in a consumer society like ours, in which a certain ironical, or even cynical, self-understanding is de rigueur. Irony, cynicism, and reflexivity further insure the masking, the mystification. Typically, participants in a Cargo cult engage in a number of strange and exotic rites and ceremonies the purpose of which is, apparently, to gain possession of European manufactured goods such as axes, knives, aspirins, china plate, razor blades, col- oured beads, guns, bolts of cloth, hydrogen peroxide, rice, tinned foods, and other goods to be found in a general department store.... Large decorated houses, or "aeroplanes" or "ships" made of wood, bark, and palm thatch bound together with vines, may be built to receive the goods, and participants may whirl, shake, chant, dance, foam at the mouth, or couple promiscuously in agitated attempts to obtain the cargo they want, not from a shop or trade store, but directly from the mystical source supposedly responsible for manufacture and distribution. -Kenelm Burridge, Mambu: A Melanesian Millennium Kenelm Burridge's description of the cargo cult is classical. Though cult activities have changed considerably since they were first described at the be- ginning of the century (the term cargo cult was first used in print by the planter Norris Mervyn Bird in the Pacific Islands Monthly in 1945), descriptions like</page><page sequence="20">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 21 Burridge's are grounding images of even the most historically sensitive studies (Lindstrom 1993:15-33). Description is immediately combined with a prob- lematic set of explanatory assumptions (about desire, for example) that deter- mine the parameters of later descriptions and interpretations. This gives the cults a kind of timelessness, perhaps of allegory. Hope has not, however, fig- ured in any systematic way in the discussions. This is particularly surprising given the influence of Christian missionaries on their rise.28 As Burridge is one of the most sensitive observers of the moral and spiri- tual dilemmas in which the cultists found themselves, I shall focus on his work among the Tangu and on the island of Manam in northern New Guinea, where a cargo cult under the leadership of a man named Mambu sprang up in the late 1930s. For Burridge, who sees them as protorevolutionary movements of posi- tive protest and dynamic aspiration, cargo cults pose the problem of the indi- vidual in relation to society at large. They ask, bluntly, whether man is a vote, a unit of labour, or endowed with a divine spark-worthy of playing an honourable part in association with other unique in- dividuals. By attempting a passage through an adjustment to existing circum- stances to a state of society which may be utopian-but which is, nevertheless, a creation in its own right-they show how new men may be made. [Burridge 1995:xx] We need not accept Burridge's utopian allegory of regeneration to appreciate the pathos and the excitement of what he calls the "numinous translation of one order of being into another" and the metaphorical possibility it offers us. In- deed, Lamont Lindstrom (1993) would see the cults (i.e., our reading of them) as a product of our own desire-a long-familiar story of unrequited love told in a new idiom. Like most commentators on the cargo cults, Burridge sees them as a reac- tion to contact with European civilization-to the shock of difference, to a sense of deprivation and discrimination, and to almost total ignorance of the techniques of production and distribution. The Papuans were caught in a trian- gle, the points of which were their own traditions, the political and administra- tive demands of the colonial government, and the values and beliefs preached by the Christian missionaries, which were themselves inconsistent. Their con- fusion was exacerbated by changes in the colonial regime. Let me quote what a Manam villager told Burridge:29 You see, we do not understand. We are just in the middle [of nowhere]. First, the Germans came-and the Australians pushed them out. Then the Japanese pushed out the Australians. Later, the Australians and the Americans forced the Japanese to go. It is beyond us. We can do nothing. When a kiap [an administrative officer] tells us to carry his baggage we have to do it. When a German told us to carry his baggage we had to obey. When a Japanese told us to carry his baggage we had to do it. If we did not we might be killed. All right, there it is. Take it or leave it. Nogat tok. I didn't say anything, that's just how it is, that's life. [Burridge 1995:12]</page><page sequence="21">22 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY But, clearly, if the cargo cult reveals anything, it is that the Papuans were not always able simply to take it or leave it. The Europeans offered them the vi- sion of something more than they had ever dreamed of, but they did not offer them the means of attaining that vision or even explained how they themselves had attained it. Cargo-the vision, the possibility-was just there: a desired opacity. And the Papuans-some of them, some of the time-sought it by whatever means they could. We might say that Papuans were not able to fulfill their desires rationally, that they refused the passivity-the resignation-that hope, however they articulated it, encourages. They wanted to shape and trans- form vague hope-here not so vague but quite concrete-into effective desire. To do so, they transformed the setting so that the objects of desire could be hoped for-awaited-efficaciously and not just passively. It can, of course, be argued that the Melanesians did not hope for cargo; they simply expected it. I have heard this argument on several occasions. It rests on the assumption that they had such trust in the efficacy of their rituals that they never doubted their outcome. Indeed, many Melanesianists with whom I have spoken were taken aback when I suggested they think of the cargo cults in terms of hope. They said, stereotypically, that Papuans were too pragmatic a people to be much concerned with hope! It is difficult for me to ac- cept this. Stereotypes aside, the cults were idiosyncratic and arose in an atmos- phere of overwhelming confusion, doubt, and disparagement caused by the in- trusion of the Europeans, their products, and their religion. However effective the leaders, however strong the identification of these "new" rituals with "tra- ditional" ones, these cults were, at some level, a probe, requiring evaluation and (given their ostensible "failure") of questionable value. Word of failure must surely have spread. What may once have been a conviction of ritual effi- cacy became one of "faith" in ritual: a "you-better-believe" attitude. Here, as elsewhere, ritual theorists have tended to ignore ritual history. The originary performance becomes the performance-immutable, immune to contextual change, repeatable and repeated. Be this as it may, the assumption that the Melanesians were so convinced of the efficacy of their rituals that they had no doubt and, therefore, no need to hope is, in my view, a striking example of the insidious deprecation of the "primitive" and the perpetuation of the myth of a "primitive mentality." Time and again, the cult leaders encouraged their followers to destroy everything they had-crops, villages, houses. They then had them construct hangars for the objects they desired. They waited; they danced; they fell into trance. They copulated and fertilized the earth with their sexual juices. Mainly they waited-in vain. We can see this as simple madness, as the colonists, ad- ministrators, and missionaries did. But we can also see it as a way of changing the context in the same way those cults that became political have tried to change their circumstances. The destruction can be seen as the destruction of the old context; the building of the hangars, as construction of a new context; the rituals, as rendering hope-now recontextualized-into efficacious desire. This would be too much of a simplification, however, because their vision was</page><page sequence="22">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 23 a confusion of the traditional, the new, and the hoped for. Burridge refers to this vision as a "myth-dream," by which he means "a body of notions derived from a variety of sources such as rumours, personal experiences, desires, con- flicts, and ideas about the total environment which find expression in myths, dreams, popular stories, and anecdotes" (Burridge 1995:27). They are a sort of "community day-dream" (1995:148) in which all people participate. They "are not intellectually articulate, for they exist in an area of emotionalized mental activity which is not private to any particular individual but which is shared by many" (1995:48). We might refer to them today as collective paradigms (Bur- ridge was writing in 1960). They provide a store of knowledge and express a set of hopes and desires. The items of knowledge become instrumental in the optative domain. They are practical, but within the "space" defined by desire and hope. Burridge himself notes: "If those involved in a myth-dream were ca- pable of fully comprehending and intellectualizing its content and meaning then 'aspiration' might have been a better word [for it]" (1995:27). Though sensitive to the plight of the Tangu, he does at times give way to stereotypic characterization. Their (primitive) response is "emotional" rather than "intel- lectual." Though Burridge claims that myth-dreams are to be found in every soci- ety, his understanding of them is deeply colored by, indeed inseparable from, what he claims are Tangu notions of myth (or, as he sometimes calls them, nar- ratives) and dreams. Both have, in my terms, strong performative force. The myth-dreams provide occasions for the Tangu to extract meaning, which is not simply reflective but efficacious. This is, I believe, reflected in their conflation of the origin and theme of their truth-bearing narratives. The myth-dreams are about, and originate with, the puoker, self-willed divine beings who resemble men but are not subject to the rules of reciprocity that govern Tangu social life. Like the firefly, the puoker are normally invisible but make their presence known in flashes of luminosity (Burridge 1969b:159). Myths (their truths) have, like the puoker, an independent existence. They are enigmatic, "un- obliged to men in community" (1969b:163). "They are essentially oblivious, oracular: it is up to men and women to extract such truths as are contained in them and to accept the consequences of doing so" (1969b: 161). Their truths are (if I understand Burridge correctly) imperative, but mediated less through in- terpretation than through immediate application. In the course of regarding their narratives in relation to their own particular cir- cumstances and awarenesses, individuals among Tangu may either confirm, or perceive alternatives to, current beliefs and activities. And, in causing such a flux- albeit momentary-or questioning in relation to current moralities, narratives bear the same kind of relation to Tangu themselves as does the ranguma [a sorcerer or otherwise asocial person], a violent storm, or an earthquake. [1969b:163-164] The Tangu, Burridge insists, do not comprehend but apprehend their narratives- the traditional ones, at least (1969b:199). When they are asked to say what a tale is about, they give a long pr6cis, repeat the last few sentences, or describe</page><page sequence="23">24 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY the events recounted in it. Their responses do not meet Burridge's criteria of comprehension: interpretation, perception of inner meaning, and correlation with other experiences.30 Like myths, dreams bear truth and are, again in my terms, performative. They "are not simple fantasies woven from sleep. They are a normal technique for solving a problem or finding a way out of a dilemma" (Burridge 1995:219). They are not weak reflections of truth; they are its source. The dream, Burridge remarks, is "the chosen vehicle for expressing the desires and hopes of the cult leaders:" Further, when expressed through a dream hope merges into positive expectancy. Any man may wish or hope for something at any time. But, when in association with a dream the hope comes near to realization. Dreams tend to pull a future into current sensible reality; they give definity to hope, adding faith, thereby putting the dreamer in touch with a verity shortly to be manifest. [1995:180] Dreams, then, are instrumental, but like hope, they cannot be forced. Once they have been dreamed, once cult leaders like Mambu have announced their dreams, they become imperatives for action-and presumably sources of com- prehension. Given the gap-the puzzlement, the challenge-that inspires and is inspired by comprehension (taken here not in some allegory of intellectual development but as marking a change in response to narrative), one presumes that hope is rearticulated, however painfully and with whatever uncertainty, in an expansive fashion. So-called cult activities are an attempt to act on this desire. Though the cults end in failure, at least in their preliminary occurrences (before they become political movements, if they do), the cultists seem of two minds about this failure. Some express disappointment and dismiss the cults as a silliness; others continue to find the myth-dream potent. Burridge suggests that the cult activities and the expression of symbols-Cargo as symbol-seem to be ends in themselves. He sees the cultists as protoepistemologists (my word, not his ) who are asking what the criteria of truth are. They look not to history (in Burridge' s eyes they cannot because they do not have history or his- torical consciousness) but to their myths, which are their storehouse of truth. They are caught in the structure of these truth-bearing myths, and though chal- lenged by empirical reality, they are ill equipped to find truth in that new reality. The cargo cults are, for Burridge, attempts to find a new philosophy of life, to find symbols that express conflicts and offer the possibility of solutions that will be meaningful to a new generation. As such, they do not fail. We could say, "Hope springs eternal." The question is, whose hopes-the Papuans' or the ethnographer' s? A hope beyond a shadow of a dream. -John Keats, Endymion</page><page sequence="24">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 25 At the beginning of Mambu: A Melanesian Millennium, in one of the most extraordinary evocations of life in the field, Burridge (1995) evokes the contagion of cargo expectation.31 A missionary-priest he meets in the bush tells him to write to his family because he probably will not see them again. The priest has seen "fiery signs" in the sky that presage the end of the world. He is living from month to month "in a country thick with expecta- tions of marvels to come," becoming "a part of the atmosphere of Cargo," Burridge observes (1995:8-9). A European planter tells him that he is being watched by a Russian submarine. The planter has seen the periscope. Why would a Russian submarine be in these waters? Burridge asks him. "To make a chart, of course," the planter snaps. "Or to land agents. Stirring up trouble. Something ought to be done" (1995:9). When Burridge was stroll- ing outside a Manam village one evening, a villager he chanced to meet suddenly announced that he understood. Burridge asked him what he under- stood, and the villager drew a map in the sand of the cosmos. He identified all the marks he had made except for one triangle-a point he refused to name, claiming that Burridge knew its name. Though Burridge insisted that he did not know its name, the villager refused to tell him. Burridge was an- noyed. He writes:32 In Tangu a somewhat mysterious place, where all good things were, had been doubtfully identified as Sewende, the Pidgin rendering of Seventh Day Adventist. And while not wanting to put the word in my present companion's mouth it would have been nice had he said it. [Indeed!] Instead, as the sun was sinking into the sea, he made a decision. "No one," he said suddenly, "no one in the world has seen this place or knows its name." [Burridge 1995:11] It is, I suppose, the nameless-the secret-source of what the Tangu long for, hope for, and desire. It is that point within the structure of hope (the mys- tery) that resists definition, when, we might say, the source and the object of hope are collapsed into one. It is, as well, the point of contestation where de- sire, as Hegel (1966:229 ff.) knew, lies in individual consciousness and yet outside that consciousness-in the relationship that is yet to be determined in which the attribution of desire (and I would add hope) are staked out.33 The vil- lager knew better than to utter the name he had been given for that unnameable place by the very people who had given it mysterious prominence in the first place. That, perhaps, would have been too much. Burridge comes, at any rate, to experience the expectation that must have tempted cult leaders like Mambu to give answers. Yes, the hope and desire of the cultists cannot easily be distinguished from those of the anthropologists. They are both caught. Though we place them insistently in the individual, nei- ther desire nor hope can be removed from social engagement and implication. We are all, I suppose, caught.</page><page sequence="25">26 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Notes Acknowledgments. This article is based on one of the Jansen Lectures delivered by the author at the Frobinius Institute and Literaturhaus in Frankfort am Maine in 1999. 1. See Mauss 1950:333-336 for an example. 2. One might call my approach autoethnographic in the sense in which all ethnography (insofar as it challenges and renders explicit the descriptive categories of the ethnographer) is autoethnographic. Ethnographies are always in tension with two or more conceptual and/or descriptive systems. They are symptoms of a confrontation-one that can never be fully resolved but which can serve as a corrective to some of the biases and presump- tions of the several parties to the confrontation. They are, in this sense, always political. 3. Since writing this article I have come across the work of Hirokazu Miyazaki, who, in his studies of exchange (in Christian church rituals in Fiji, in gift exchanges, and, more recently, in complex financial markets), employs a notion of hope. Hope has, at some level, to be related to faith, trust, risk, and expectation, among other things; each requires explication. Certainly, even in the most secular exchanges, an element of trust is required if there is any expectation that the exchange will be fulfilled. Given the limits of trust, not to mention the contingencies of everyday reality, risk is an omnipresent fac- tor. It may be mastered up to a point by various technical means, as in the mathematical modals of market performance, through various coverings (as in the derivative market or through reinsurance), or in simpler exchanges between individuals or small groups through reference to (faith in) some higher power who gives one hope. In the latter situ- ation, as Miyazaki (2000a) shows, one may place one's agency in abeyance. In these simpler cases, relations of exchange are, as in Moroccan Berber marriages, multiplied and diminished in importance. The successful completion of each minor exchange serves as a (psychological) guarantor for the more important exchanges that will follow. At the same time, they magnify the importance of the most important exchanges and the suspense that accompanies their anticipation. No doubt it is necessary as well to distin- guish here between those exchanges that are sanctioned by some supernatural authority and those that are subject to legal or customary sanction. Miyazaki's work stresses the "not yet" dimension of social life that has been elaborated by Ernst Bloch (1986). See below and Miyazaki 2000a, 2000b, n.d.a, n.d.b. 4. Marett's approach to religion was, as he put it, social psychological. He stressed man's basic optimism and saw fear as providing "needful caution" to extravagant hope. See also Marett 1933:18-19. 5. It was Diogenes Laertius who attributed the definition of hope as a waking dream to Aristotle. Jacques-Bdnigne Bossuet mentions it in his Discourse on Universal History. "What is hope? The dream of an awakened dream" is how he puts it (see Desroche 1980:12, esp. n. 8). 6. Is hope an emotion, as Ernest Bloch thought it to be (he referred to it as an "ex- pectant emotion" [1986:74])? Or is it better described, as I think it is, as an emotionally and morally toned descriptor of an existential stance or attitude? Is it-in linguistic ter- minology-a stative or a performative? If "I hope" is a performative, as is "I promise," it is very weak. If it is a stative, it postulates a mental condition that is rather illusive. It is transitive insofar as "one hopes for" or "one hopes that." That is, one speaks of the ob- ject of hope the way one speaks of the object of desire. Its object may be concrete, as in "I hope that I will find gold," or abstract, as in "I hope it will all work out in the end." As a noun, "hope" tends to be abstract or, as Pater would say, "vague." It may even appear to be without an object. There are, I believe, in American English at least two distinct uses of "hope" and "to hope": one in which the object of hope is specific and concrete;</page><page sequence="26">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 27 the other in which it is vague and abstract. I suggest that the rhetorical force of "hope" rests largely on the play between its concrete and abstract objects. When its object is concrete, hope resembles-in usage at least-desire and may be confused with it. When its object is abstract, it suggests a philosophical perspective on life, a sort of positive res- ignation, for example. Such a perspective is often masked by hope's concrete object, which "transforms" resigned hope into active desire. This conversion activates, as it were, our more abstract hopes and conceals the resignation that lies inevitably behind them. 7. The following discussion is taken from Minkowski 1970:92-102. 8. Minkowski also divides the past into three periods: the remote past, or zone of the obsolete (dipassed); the mediate past, or zone of the regretted; and the immediate past, or zone of remorse. 9. "On trouve surtout du charme i l'esperance, parce qu'elle ouvre largement l'avenir devant nous" (Minskowski 1968:86, citing Henri Bergson). Note that the word for future, avenir (a-venir, "a coming to") suggests an advent. Minkowski refuses to be called an optimist, however. Optimism and pessimism are secondary-empirical-atti- tudes that have to be distinguished from the general structures of time. "Pessimism and optimism always have to be substantiated with supporting proofs, while we never have to ask ourselves whether we desire or hope," Minkowski observes (1970:94). 10. Heidegger wrote: "In Dasein there is always something still outstanding, which, as a potentiality-for-Being, for Dasein itself, has not yet become 'actual.' It is es- sential to the basic constitution of Dasein that there is constantly something still to be set- tled. ... Such a lack of totality signifies that there is something still outstanding in one's potentiality-for-Being" [Im Dasein immer noch etwas aussteht, was als Seink6nnen seiner selbst noch nicht 'wirklich' geworden ist. Im Wesen der Grundverfassung des Daseins liegt demnach eine stindige UnabgeschloBenheit. Die Unganzheit bedeutet einen Ausstand an Seinkinnen] (1962:236). 11. See Middendorf 1985:75 ff. for a discussion of the openness, as well as the clo- sure, brought about by hope. 12. Middendorf (1985:39-41) discusses hope in terms of requesting (Bitten) and praying (Beten), which have for him, finally, the same effect. He does not view prayer in as abstractly transcendental a fashion as Minkowski does, but rather as directed toward another-God. Accordingly, he recognizes the articulatory function of prayer and the way it clarifies, develops, and even transforms hope. Minkowski's approach does not take account of the communicative dimension of hope and, indeed, its potential collec- tivization. We do speak of a people's hope. 13. See Caputo 1997:1-3, 6-12, and 28-40 for a discussion of negative theology and Jacques Derrida's notion of diffdrance. We may even want to relate this shifting to the trinitarian godhead, in which Christ is the most concrete (indeed, he is human, at least for a time); God the father is less concrete (but still, if only in name, anthropomor- phized); and the Holy Spirit is the most abstract (though Charismatics and Pentecostal- ists experience the Holy Spirit as the most concrete). 14. My very questions are indicative of the problem I am raising. They reflect my language, the attitude I take toward language, the way I regard reference, the priority I (refuse to) give to the object of reference. They reflect as well a certain epistemological anxiety that is characteristic of the age in which I live. 15. For baroque literature see, for example, Buci-Glucksman 1979, 1986. For the mystics see de Certeau 1992:113. See also de Certeau, in which the author argues that the other that organizes the text is not an outside of the text. It is not the (imaginary) object that one might distinguish from the movement by which it (Es) is sketched. To locate it apart, to isolate</page><page sequence="27">28 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY it from the texts that exhaust themselves trying to express it, would be tantamount to exorcising it by providing it with its own place and name, to identifying it with a remnant not assimilated to consti- tuted rationalities, or to transforming the question that appears in the guise of a limit into a particular religious representation (in turn excluded from the scientific fields and fetishized as the substitute for what is lacking). It is to postulate behind the documents, a something or other, a malleable inef- fable that could be fashioned to fit any end, a "night in which all cows are black." [1992:15-16] 16. See Silverstein 2002 for a discussion of Whorf's notion of time. 17. The examples that follow are all taken from Foley 1986:160-162. 18. William Foley describes it this way: "The irrealis suffix indicates either that the occurrence of the event in the future cannot be fixed or that it occurred in the legendary past, so that again it is beyond real time" (1986:161-162). In fact, the Yimas system is even more complicated because Yimas also has a series of status markers (real, likely, potential but unlikely, and unreal) that are independent of tense. 19. As John Lucy (1985:79), among others, has pointed out, Whorf's position is rather more complicated. Though he has usually been taken as a relativist, Whorf does not assume that grammatical categories are simply language specific. He argues that comparisons between languages are possible but require a frame of reference that is inde- pendent of any given language (Whorf 1956:162). His notions of overt and covert cate- gories can be considered, I suppose, examples of such independent frames of comparison. One has to be skeptical, I would insist, of ever achieving a single language-independent language for comparative linguistic study. This does not mean that it is not possible to develop categories that are less immediately language specific than, say, those of the traditional grammars of European languages. 20. I will limit my discussion to this essay because, aside from its obvious relevance, it is concerned with the effect of grammar on Hopi thinking-their metaphysics-rather than with its effect on perception and cognition. Whorf's use of thinking is not unambi- guous, however; it signifies a mode of philosophical thought rather than a psychological process. Lucy (1985:82) refers to "thought" as "conceptual content." I will not be able to develop in the scope of this article Whorf' s own grammatical derivation of time in Euro- pean languages. See Lucy 1985:82-86 and Silverstein 2002. 21. Whorf's conclusion is, in fact, unclear. This may be the result of a misprint in which he glosses tundtya, rather than its inceptive form, tundtyava, as "coming true." One wonders how Whorf would derive the expective of this word. 22. See Crapanzano 1997 for further discussion on the role of power in translation. There, I note the way in which a translation "feeds back" on the original. It is, indeed, a way of dominating the original, as it is dominated by it. 23. Jiirgen Moltmann (1967), who frequently quotes Bloch, would perhaps argue that the "utopias of realism," as static as they are, are characteristic of a bourgeois real- ism that adheres to the stark facts and the mechanical formulation of "objective laws." 24. Antoine, a doctor, is not without hope. He restricts it to helping others-his pa- tients-and to personal ambition within his set world. In the end, it is Jacques's hope that proves ineffectual. 25. The quotation is from William Raspberry, "The Engine of Achievement Is Hope, Not Intelligence," International Herald Tribune, May 17, 2000. 26. See Crapanzano 1985: esp. 42-47. 27. Kierkegaard is making reference to Aeschylus's (1959: lines 250-254) Prometheus Bound, in which the god tells the chorus that he "caused mortals to cease foreseeing doom" by placing them "in blind hope."</page><page sequence="28">REFLECTIONS ON HOPE 29 28. Robbins (1994) has noted, however, the rearticulation of desire that followed from the Christianization of the Urapmin people of the western Sepik. 29. See Burridge 1969a:59 for a slightly different version. 30. Burridge notes that though traditional narratives, or myths, refer to the past in the present tense (beginning with arin, "once upon a time"), new narratives, those dealing with cargo, refer to the future in the present tense. (According to Burridge, the language of the Tangu, an Austronesian one, has no past tense.) "When Tangu say that the newer tales are 'more true' than the traditional narratives," Burridge observes, "they seem to intimate that re- alization of being in the terms of these stories is more possible or relevant or desirable than realization of being in terms of the traditional narratives. Since that which is past is now ir- revocably past, the alternative is to fill out the future" (1969b:426). It is only the "new" nar- ratives about cargo and the European challenge that are comprehended. Burridge is never clear whether they demand comprehension (interpretation) or are simply comprehended. We should stress the apparently dramatic change in the Tangu sense of time (history?) that comes with cargoism and "comprehension" and ask how this affects their experience of hope. See Kempf 1990 for an interesting discussion of the tension that developed among the Si- bog (one of the peoples who followed the cargo prophet Yali) between their traditional epi- sodic notion of time and change and a continuous one characteristic of Christianity. Wolfgang Kempf, like many other Melanesianists, follows Frederick Errington's (1974) de- piction of traditional Papuan notions of history as episodic or discontinuous. This distinction, originally made by Gellner, between episodic and evolutionary notions of history is, in my view, oversimplified. 31. See Burridge 1969a:56-59 for a slightly different version. 32. In New Heaven, New Earth, written nine years later, Burridge refers to the nameless place as the ultimum bonum. Here, the villager is quoted as describing it as "far away and beyond the seas where everything could be learned and the good things of this world obtained" (Burridge 1969a:57). 33. See Kojeve 1947 for a (mis)reading of Hegel's master-slave dialectic that gives prominence to desire. References Cited Adams, Jay E. 1970 Competent to Counsel: Introduction to Nouthetic Counseling.
