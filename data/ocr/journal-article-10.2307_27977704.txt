<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 AN IDENTIFICATION OF ANTHROPOMORPHIC MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGES IN MOCHE REPRESENTATIONS Yuri E? Berezkin Editor1s note. Continuing our policy of presenting alternate interpretations of Moche iconography, we present the work of a colleague from the Institute of Ethnography, Leningrad. This contribution was written before the author had seen the revision of Dorm?n1s 1976 work (Christopher B. Donnan, Moche art of Peru; pre-Columbian symbolic com munication. Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles, 1978) or the original articles on Moche iconography published in 1977 by Alana Cordy-Collins and Donna McClelland (in Pre-Columbian art history; selected readings. [Edited by] Alana Cordy-Collins and Jean Stern. Peek Publications, Palo Alto, California). The article is published as submitted except that, in a few cases, the editors sub stituted more accessible editions for those originally cited in the bibliography. The editors have illustrated this article on the basis of man uscript indications. We wish to express our sincere gratitude to Izumi Shimada for providing us with the drawing reproduced in fig. 12, as well as his permission to publish it. ?PJL. ****** Introduction This article is based on a sample of about 3000 representations from Moche III-V vessels, most of them published. I was able to see almost no original collections. Besides the Moche scenes, additional data have been drawn from "Casma style" press-molded vessels. The Middle Horizon Casma style was defined by Tello (1956, pp. 305-311), and its iconography was later studied by Carrion Cachot (1959)? Although the style is heterogeneous, with probable influences from Recuay and Huari (in sensu lato) sources, it displays a basic continuity of the Moche ico nographie tradition, especially in the substyle of the Santa and Nepena valleys, marked by modeling and relief rather than painted decoration. Some Casma scenes are simply variations of Moche IV-Y ones with minor differences in subject or style. These differences, however, are useful in resolving certain questions regarding Moche iconography. In spite of the number of studies of Moche iconography that have appeared in the last decade (Benson, 1972; 1975; Donnan, 1976; Hocquenghem, 1977a; 1977b; 1977c; Lavall?e, 1970; etc.) there are some basic problems that have yet to be properly investigated. As a first approach to understanding the Moche mythological system and reconstruc ting the subjects of the myths represented, an accurate identification of individual mythological personages is particularly urgent. A com plete delineation of these personages (zoomorphic, phytomorphic and anthropomorphic) should also lead to a better understanding of Moche</page><page sequence="2">2 social structure, for I feel that this structure is somehow reflected in the hierarchy of supernatural beings and in the distribution of their functions. Larco Hoyle combined all Moche anthropomorphic gods under the name "Ai Apaec" (1946, p. 171)? Following Ubbelohde-Boering (1931)? Kutscher (1948, p. 628; 1950b, p. 202) distinguished a Rayed God among them. It was not until 1972, however, that Benson drew attention to scenes attesting to the existence of three anthropomorphic beings all with similar iconographie elements: fanged mouths and snakes near their belts (Benson, 1972, pp. 27-44)? Her identification of scenes with rep resentations of a "creator god" (our C personage) is basically correct and simply needs further elaboration. She did not, however, distinguish between two other personages although she noted some scenes in which they both appear. Identification of Major Anthropomorphic Personages The functions of Moche gods are diverse and not yet entirely clear, while their visible attributes are unstable. We have therefore identified three of these mythical personages by the letters A, B, and C rather than by descriptive terms. Our method of differentiating the gods was first to note those scenes in which two personages are represented together, and then to identify each of these when he is represented alone, A and personages Table 1 distinguishes between these two personages on the basis of six published representations showing them in combat or in some sort of conflict, some opposition: (a) fig. 1; (b) Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 56C; (c) Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 60B,61A; (d) Larco Hoyle, 1946, fig. 21c; (e) Sawyer, 1954, covers; (f) Strong and Evans, 1952, pi. XXXVIIIe).1 Table 1 A God God Elaborate headgear (in this set of A simple fillet around the fore scenes a headpiece decorated with head with two ends protruding up a feline representation and a fan- wards (a,c,e); the same headgear like adornment). as A, but without the feline rep resentation (b); no headgear (d,f).

In one case it is impossible to determine from the photograph (c).</page><page sequence="3">3 Accompanied by a small animal, An aureole of weapon bundles sur probably a dog (a,b,c,e,f). rounds the figure (e). Accompanied by Iguana God (a,c). On the basis of Table 1 and data drawn from individual repre sentations of A and personages, we can establish the following identifying traits. 1 ? The personage accompanied by Iguana God is A God (or at least not God). "When Iguana God is represented with anthropomorphic fea tures, he wears a bird-effigy headdress, and when A God and an anthropo morphized Iguana appear together, A God's headdress is always decorated with a feline figure. Furthermore, in those representations showing both Iguana God and personage, the headdress of personage lacks the feline figure (fig. 1; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 60B). In contrast, when Iguana and Fox God appear together (Valc?rcel, 1937, fig* 4), they do have opposite headgear: bird for Iguana and feline for Fox. 2. The personage accompanied by a dog is A God (or at least not God). The dog may accompany Eayed God as well.2 3? If an aureole of weapon bundles surrounds an anthropomorphic figure it is God. 4? The personage wearing headgear consisting of a simple band with two upward-protruding ends is God. 5? If an object is suspended from the personage's elbow, it is God. 6. The attire of God is never very elaborate, although a strict demarcation between permissible and nonpermissible features in costume elaboration is impossible. When A and are represented together, the attire of God (either clothes or headgear) is always in some way more simple than Afs. The least certain of the traits listed above is number 4 (a simple headband), since it does not serve as an individual attribute but rather as a sign of social status or the sort of activity in which the wearer is engaged in a given scene. This kind of headgear is most fre quently worn by fishermen and sea lion hunters. When A and personages are shown together in a scene, the contrast in their headdresses seems to be significant, but such distinctions appear to be optional when the personages are represented individually. Therefore, God can never be positively identified on the basis of his headdress alone. While some other traits emerge from the six representations upon which Table 1 is based, they do not correlate well with either the six elements mentioned above or with each other. For example, the absence of snakes near the belt is often correlated with traits 3 and 4 on individual representations, but there are some divine figures in sumptuous attire and shown seated on a throne who also lack such snakes (e.g., Donnan, 1976, figs. 104,106 personage D; Larco Hoyle, 1938-39, tomo II, l?m. XXIII; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 72). This individual cannot be God because in two such scenes Iguana God stands near him</page><page sequence="4">4 (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. III, fig. 344; TJhle, 1935, fig* 11 )y) therefore the absence of snakes near the belt is a poor basis for identification. In those cases where snakes are lacking and the personage is wearing sim ple attire, however, it is more likely that God is represented than that A God is intended. These remarks do not refer to scenes including C God who is described below. It is quite possible that all those anthro pomorphic figures which lack snakes near the belt, and are neither female nor rayed, are either C or god, but this suggestion cannot yet be proven. Trait 5 might be considered random, since it appears to be functional (in contrast to trait 3 which is clearly not functional). Its constant association with individual representations of personage B, however, proves that such is not the case. In a large sample of pub lished scenes the anthropomorphic hero is shown in a posture of adora tion, looking upwards; in painted versions his figure is under an arch formed by a double-headed snake;4 a bag hangs from his elbow or a shell trumpet with a loop for suspension lies at his feet (Anton, 1972, pi. 116; Ubbelohde-Doering, 1954, pis. 172,175; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 26, Taf. 69 left; 1954, Abb. 75; Larco Hoyle, 1938-39, tomo I, fig. 31, tomo II, l?m. XXIX). In these representations trait 5 correlates with 4 and 6 as well as with a lack of snakes near the personage1s belt. We have demonstrated elsewhere (Berezkin, 1978a), in part fol lowing Kutscher (1954, ? 20) and Bisselhoff (1956), that the object suspended from the elbow is not an optional detail, but rather marks persons of non-Moche ethnic origin (real or mythical); the mythical ancient tribe destroyed by gods seems to have carried such bags. We here summarize our basic conclusions with a few corrections. The bag hanging by a loop handle from the elbow correlates with other iconographie traits, among them (a) special costumes, headdresses, ear ornaments, and weapons; (b) other bags hanging from the neck or held in the mouth by the handle. All these bags were probably designed to carry coca leaves as Benson has suggested (Benson, ms.).5 Common Moche warriors lack all of these traits. The humans pursued by animated objects in the Huaca de la Luna murals have some of these foreign traits: "duck-foot" shaped earrings and special feathered maces (Bonavia, 1974, figs. 40-44; Holstein, 1927, figs. 31,32; Kroeber, 1930, pl. XV; Seler, 1912, p. 132)? The humans (perhaps shamans) who accompany the anthropo morphic mythical personage in the scenes of adoration mentioned above have non-Moche traits in their clothing, headdresses and weapons. The "winged" effigies hanging from the god's neck in these scenes are proba bly also bags for coca leaves in the shape of puma skins. Bags of this kind are known archaeologically (Mujica Gallo, 1959, pis. XXXII,XXXIII). A modeled representation of a man with a similar pouch on his back was published by Baessler (1902-03, vol. I, fig. Hi) and Seler (1893, Taf. 17:17,18:18). Overall, I consider God to have some non-Moche attributes and to be sometimes accompanied by humans with foreign characteristics. The clearest identifying trait of God is his nimbus of weapon</page><page sequence="5">5 "bundles, although it occurs in Moche Y paintings only. We must add one more Moche mythical personage to our survey, the Hermit Crab God (fig. 2), in order to demonstrate the identity of the anthropomorphic figures surrounded by weapon-bundle aureoles with the god represented in the posture of adoration. The Hermit Crab God has something in common with both of the main iconographie variants of God, the one surrounded by a weapon-bundle nimbus and the one with a bag suspended from the elbow. The Hermit Crab God is characterized by a human head and hands (a full bodied anthropomorphic version occurs as well), often long antennae pro truding from the forehead, and a large spiral shell on the back (Bieseldorff, 1925, Taf. 51, figs. 230,231; Bisselhoff, 1957, Abb. 1a). Fig. 2 shows a Moche IV vessel in the form of a standing figure of the Hermit Crab God with non-Moche attributes similar to those of person age. A puma-skin bag hangs from his neck and another pouch from his elbow. These attributes are too specific, too rarely associated with other gods, to allow us to suppose that Hermit Crab has nothing to do with the other anthropomorphic personage possessing these traits. The same Hermit Crab God is painted on a Moche V polychrome vase riding a totora raft and fishing (Bisselhoff, 1957, Abb. 1; Fung Pineda, 1968, back cover; Lumbreras, 1979, l?m. 87)? On the opposite side of the vessel another raft sails, very likely ridden by personage, although only the ends of the clubs forming his aureole of weapon bundles can be discerned in the photographs. In this case Hermit Crab is connected with the anthropomorphic god not by common attributes but through their representation in the same scene. It is probable that Hermit Crab God is connected in both cases with the same anthropomorphic god, God B, rather than with two different ones. Finally, the sailing anthropomor phic deity himself seems to have a coca bag in at least one scene (Larco Hoyle, 1966b, fig. 49), although without inspecting the actual vessel it is impossible to judge whether or not this pouch has a puma head repre sentation? A further approach involves the identification of the anthro pomorphic mythical personages that occur in certain common or important Moche iconographie settings. An iconographie setting is understood to be the invariant portion of all scenes representing the same actions of the same personage or of several main personages. If some of the repre sentations possess elements providing identification of a particular personage, while other representations of the same series (i.e., of the same iconographie setting) lack elements with such identification value, we suggest that all scenes of the same setting represent the same per sonage even though he or she could be certainly identified in only some of them. God is represented in the following settings: 1. Riding a totora raft (other personages who also ride the raft are Rayed God, Osprey, Buck, and Hermit Crab); identified by traits 3,4 and 6 (Anton, 1972, pis. 143,144; Ubbelohde-Boering, I93I, Taf. XII; Donn?n, 1976, figs. 6,72; Horkheimer, i960, Abb. 3; I96I, p. 15; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 17; 1954, Abb. 66B; Larco Hoyle, 1966b, fig. 49; Nachtigall, 1966, Abb. 48; Sawyer, I966, fig. 75; Schmidt, 1929, ? 196: 2; Tercero, 1939, ? 150). In thirteen representations where these traits could be identified from the photographs, the personage lacks</page><page sequence="6">6 snakes near his belt in seven cases and has no fangs in five. 2. In a posture of adoration looking upwards (as noted above); identified by traits 4,5,6. In seven representations there are no snakes near the belt in six cases and no fangs in two. These are the two primary iconographie settings where God is not accompanied by his rival, A God. In another series of scenes God is identified by trait 4 only: 1? With his upraised hands he supports a two-headed snake which is depicted as a short bar, not as an arch (fig. 3; Kutscher, 1950a, Taf. 67 right; Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig. 219; Seler, 1893, Taf. 21:10). 2. He lies among rocks on the seashore playing a small drum (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 357; Schmidt, 1929, p. 168:2; Seler, 1893, Taf. 16:8,21:11). 3? He fishes with a hook and line while lying on the same seashore (fig. 4; Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, figs. 317,319,321; Kutscher, 1950a, Taf. 67 left). Such negative traits as lack of fangs and lack of snakes near the belt seem to be more characteristic of God than of A. In all scenes where A God can be positively identified, he has fangs. We shall see that C God also frequently appears with neither fangs or belt snakes. A God is represented in the following iconographie settings: 1. Embraces a woman; identified by traits 1 and 2 (Anton, 1972, pi. I5I; Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 348; Bonnan, 1976, fig. 1; Carrion Cachot, 1959, fig* 4; Larco Hoyle, 1966a, pp. 109,113,140). 2. Participates in a funeral ceremony; identified by trait 1 (Bonnan, 1976, figs. 2,65). 3? Stands at the foot of a cliff upon or in front of which lie sac rificed humans; identified by traits 1 and 2 (fig. 5; Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 313; Benson, 1972, figs. 2-11,-12;? Collier, 1959, fig. 73; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 79B; Moser, 1974, p. 34 top; Seler, 1893, Taf. 22:8,22:14,34:1,34:3). 4? Plies on the back of a bird; identified by trait 1 (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 342; Larco Hoyle, 1966b, fig. 53; Seler, 1893, Taf. 22:9).8 5? Stands in front of a huge frog which has edible plants sprout ing from its body; identified by trait 1 (Larco Hoyle, 1966b, fig. 60). This scene requires some comment. The anthropomorphic personage holds in both hands a long U-shaped object with ends that terminate in feline or snake heads. Below him is a procession of monkeys carrying bags. This Moche V relief has a counterpart in the Casma style (Carrion Cachot, 1959, fig. HO). The Casma representation differs in minor stylistic and thematic elements, e.g., Iguana God (identified on the basis of his bird effigy headdress and thick, conically shaped tail) holds the U-shaped object, other zoomorphic gods (probably Pox, Feline, and some bird gods) stand nearby. Thus, while A God is not represented in this case with Iguana God, the two personages appear to be interchangeable in the simi lar situation, making the identification of the anthropomorphic personage on the Moche vessel as A God probable. On some Moche stirrup-spout vessels, the opposite sides bear</page><page sequence="7">7 separate scenes, either painted or in relief. Such scenes probably represent successive adventures of the same mythical hero. When painted on flaring bowls, such scenes are not simply double, but multiple. In the majority of the scenes, fights between an anthropornorphic deity and demons are shown (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, figs. 332,345; Imbelloni, 1959, fig. 430; Kutscher, 1954, fig* 54B; Larco Hoyle, 1948, l?m. XIII bottom). Iguana God and the dog sometimes accompany the anthropomorphic personage which makes us think that it is A God rather than who fights with a round-bodied (turtle?) demon, a Strombus demon, and with a long haired demon (this creature has an anthropomorphic body and an animal head with two long locks, or perhaps antennae, and generally fish fins and tail). Between the scenes of mythical combats are representations of the anthropomorphic hero flanked by vultures (imbelloni, 1959, fig* 430).9 In scenes of combat with a catfish demon, the identification of A God is reinforced by the presence of traits 1 and 2 (Harcourt and Harcourt, 1924, pi. 56 right; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 64; 1954, Abb. 60A). It is A God who fights with Crab demon for the dog helps him (Schmidt, 1929, * I63), and just after this battle he surrenders to God (Sawyer, 1954; cover clearly shows that the same personage who over came the Crab then kneels in front of the god with an aureole of weapon bundles). The only basis for identifying the crab-fighting hero as God would be the fact that in some scenes the anthropomorphic personage has a simple headdress, a trait we remarked earlier is insufficient for positive identification (Coe, 1972, p. 94 top; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 57B; Lavallee, 1970, pl. 59B). There is one scene in which I am uncertain which of the two anthropomorphic gods is represented. This is the scene in which the god catches Bonito demon with a hook and line,^ in what is more hand to hand combat than fishing; neither seashore nor totora raft is shown (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 333; Burger, 1977, figs. 1,2; Banzel, 1927, p. 109; Fuhrmann, 1922, Bild 97; Hissink, 1951, * 126; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 58; 1954, Abb. 6IC; Larco Hoyle, 1946, fig. 21a; Nordenski?ld, 1921, fig. 17)? There is one version in which the anthro pomorphic personage is accompanied by a dog and holds a fishing line with a hook at its end, but the Bonito itself is absent (Uhle, 1912, fig. 4)? It is probable that the intention was to represent A God in all combat scenes between an anthropomorphic personage aimed with a transverse knife and a demon (Crayfish, Crab, Bonito, Turtle[?], Strombus, Long-haired demon, Dragon [Recuay-monster], and Dragon-like anthropomorphic demon). 0 personage The identification of C God is best begun on the basis of rep resentations of an anthropomorphic being sitting in a cave; two gigantic snakes twine around the cliff containing the cave (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 315; Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig* 220; Sawyer, 1966, fig. 7I). Another anthropomorphic personage stands at the foot of the cliff and supports the head of one of the snakes. In some cases Iguana God sup ports the other snake head. So these two standing figures appear as a</page><page sequence="8">8 pair of worshippers flanking the divinity in the cave. Since there is good reason to think that the standing anthropomorphic personage is A God, the god in the cave must he some other one, perhaps God? Without a representation in which God and the god in the cave appear together, it is impossible to eliminate this possibility. There are, however, two reasons that this solution is improbable. First, the sumptuous attire of the god in the cave is not typical of God. Second, the god in the cave is closely connected with A God; as we shall see, some of their functions may be almost identical and their relations are friendly, while A and are opponents and adversaries.^ Therefore, we shall designate the god in the cave C God. In the set of scenes under consideration, while A God has one snake near his belt, C God has none; perhaps the giant snakes twining round the rock sub stitute for them. C God's clothing and headdress are always more elabo rate than A Godrs. For example, if there is a great semicircular adornment with a feline effigy crowning C God's head, then A God's head dress is decorated with the feline head alone, whereas if C lacks the semicircular adornment, A has no headdress at all. But in the scenes where A God and Iguana God stand on either side of the rock and no C God is represented, the semicircular adornment may sometimes crown A God's head (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 313)? It is probable that C God is the central figure in a series of scenes in which three to five cone-shaped projections (apparently repre senting mountains) rise behind one or more figures. He may be seated or standing and his body often merges with the hills (Arte del Peru, 1955, p. 20; Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, pis. 82,84; Coe, 1972, p. 96; Fuhrmann, 1922, Bild. 74,75; Proulx, 1973, 1? 5c; Sawyer, I966, pi. 72; Schmidt, 1929, p. 164:1; Sestieri, I963, fig. 1; Seler, 1893, Taf. 21: 14-15,21:18-19)? This set of scenes and the representations of C God in the cave are linked by the pair of huge serpents that, rather than projecting from the being's belt, twine around the mountains on both sides of the figure. In both scenes, the divinity sometimes holds what is probably a lime gourd for use with coca chewing (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 315; Schmidt, 1929, p. 16411 ) ? I think it is probably the same god represented lying among the hills with two serpents projecting from his head and hanging down both sides of it (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 299). Representa tions of his disembodied head have snake heads resting on his temples (Anton, 1972, pi. 145; Seler, 1893, Taf. 22:11). The bodiless head of the god framed by a two-headed snake in the form of an arch reaching from ear to ear (Seler, 1893, Taf. 21:1,22:5; Tabio, 1969, fig. 107), as well as the full figure of a standing personage with a two-headed snake framing the upper third of it (Anton, 1972, pi. 138), seem to share the same basic idea as the representation of the god sitting on a throne in front of the mountain peaks and under the celestial arch formed by the two-headed snake (Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 77C). The divinity shown standing in front of the mountains, or per haps growing out of the peaks, often holds in one hand a maize plant with cobs, and in the other a bunch of manioc tubers (fig. 6; Carrion</page><page sequence="9">9 Cachot, 1959, fig- 46; Donn?n, 1976, fig. 93; Fuhrmann, 1922, Bild 15; Horkheimer, i960, Taf. 3 left; Lips, I967, pp. 272-273)? This Moche IV or V iconographie setting has a direct continuation in Casma style scenes (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. II, fig. 272; Carrion Cachot, 1959, fig* 55; Heyerdahl, 1975, pis. XIV right, 320)? In later representations, however, the personage generally lacks fangs and snakes near his belt, although sometimes both traits are present. The most -unquestionable trait of C God is the two snakes whose heads lie on the god1s head and bodies twine among the peaks (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, pi. 85). In these scenes, C god1 s headdress is often the same as that of the god seated on the throne under the celestial arch: a headpiece or a band with two rectangular projections rising from it (compare Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 77C and Fuhrmann, 1922, Bild 15)? In some of the Casma style representations, the god not only holds plants in his hands, but has stems and tubers growing from his body (Carrion Cachot, 1959, figs. 41,42). These figures appear to be the semantic equivalents of the representations of a mythical personage whose body is composed of maize cobs stuck together (Benson, 1972, fig. 2-4; Disselhoff, I967, p. 50; Donnan, 1973, pi. 4f,g; Fuhrmann, 1922, Bild 25; Safford, 1924, no. 1; Sestieri, 1963. figs. 5-7; Towle, I96I, pis. VIIb,XVa; etc.), or of manioc tubers (Benson, 1972, fig. 5-20; Donnan, 1976, fig. 100; Haberland, 1975, Taf. 2b; Kroeber, 1925, pi- 55h; Sawyer, I966, fig. 76)?^ Plant spirits of this kind are peculiar and differ from the spirits of potatoes, peanuts, beans, and other edible fruits in that they are not humans or animals but rather possess all the main characteristics of Moche anthropomorphic gods: fanged mouth, snakes near the belt (Towle, I96I, pi. Vllb), snakelike ear ornaments, round protuberant eyes, and the semicircular adornment above the forehead that is especially typical of C God. The anthropomorphic god incarnates the same plants that he holds in his hands, maize and manioc. On a Moche V polychrome stirrup-spout vessel (Fung Pineda, 19^8, back cover) the manioc deity with a fanged mouth stands on a rectangular pedestal hold ing a cup, while on the spout just behind the personage's back there appears to be a maize cob depicted. The overall treatment of this par ticular representation makes it the iconographie link between the Casma press-molded representations in which the deity holds the plants and has some cobs and tubers protruding from his body and the Moche maize god and Moche manioc god, all of these personages being variants of C God. Behind the fanged figure which sprouts out of the fusing maize cobs is sometimes another one also with fangs and with two snakes near the belt (Sestieri, I963, figs. 5-7)? This latter figure gives the impression of a worshipper standing behind the principal deity, i.e., two mythical personages are placed in the same relationship as gods C and A in and near the cave.13 It is highly probable that the smaller figure is A God. In the settings with the row of mountains behind him and two snakes twined among the peaks, C God sometimes holds a maize plant in his right hand, while his left hand is inserted into a bag which is slung over his shoulder; he is probably removing seeds for sowing (Carrion Cachot, 1959, fig* 39)? This representation leads us to the</page><page sequence="10">10 famous ceremonial digging stick from the grave of the "warrior priest" at the Huaca de la Cruz. The stick is decorated with the carved figures of two mythical personages, the older holding a digging stick himself, and the younger holding a hag with seeds (Strong and Evans, 1952, pi. XXIIl). It seems probable that one of them is C God, for this deity provides agricultural fertility as is explicit in the scenes representing him as the giver of edible plants. It is more likely that C God is the older, more powerful per sonage on the digging stick and not the younger, in spite of the fact that in this case it is the youth who holds the seed bag whereas in ceramic representations C God holds a similar bag. When represented in company with other mythical beings (A God and Iguana God) C is wor shipped by them and seems to be at the top of the mythical hierarchy. Is the boy with the bag A God? Probably, although it cannot be proved. The old god and the boy form a pair of personages consisting of the principal god and his assistant which is similar to that of the two maize spirits to gods C and A in and near the mountain cave. I also speculate that C God could be represented as the strange figure with anthropomorphic body and an animal head which has various plants sprouting from him, which accompanies the litter of the Rayed God (Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 80). C personage, therefore, is the deity abiding in the mountain cave; he is the incarnation and donor of maize and manioc and most prob ably the disseminator of agricultural skill itself. He is represented either with or without fangs and snakes near his belt, and most fre quently shown with mountain peaks behind him among which two serpents twine on both sides of his figure. Sometimes the heads of the snakes are over his head and sometimes he is framed overhead by the celestial double-headed snake in the form of an arch. God A ( sometimes with Iguana God) is Cfs worshipper and assis tant, probably the younger personage near the older one. The different status of the two deities is explicit in the scenes of human sacrifice in the mountain country: C, wearing rich attire, is seated on a throne among the peaks; he is inactive (fig# 7; Disselhoff, 1940, fig. 1; Bonnan, 1976, fig. 95; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 78; Lothrop, 1972, p. 168; Muelle and Bias, 1938, l?m. 13; Sestieri, 1963, figs. 3,4)? Meanwhile, A stands at the foot of one of the cliffs, wears simpler clothes, and together with Iguana God and sometimes accompanied by a dog participates actively in the ritual (fig. 5, Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 313; Benson, 1972, figs. 2-11,-12; Collier, 1959, fig* 73; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 79B,B; Moser, 1974, p. 34 top; Seler, 1893, Taf. 22:8,22:10,22:14, 34:1,34:3)? C God was perhaps the central cosmic figure of the Moche people. This suggestion is supported by the fact that his body is not only sur rounded by the double-headed celestial snake, but is also framed with stars and, on Early Casma and/or Late Moche press-molded representations in which he is represented holding plants, there are stars around his figure (Carrion Cachot, 1959, fig* 45; Sawyer, 1954, p. 10 bottom). I</page><page sequence="11">11 know of one further painted representation of an anthropomorphic god among stars on a Moche V vessel (Larco Hoyle, 1948, lam. XIV bottomi. Because this figure has not the peculiar traits of the Bayed (lunar) God, it is most probable he is C God. Snakes project from his head and his belt and his mouth is fanged. He is depicted full face, and a similar (but less sumptuously adorned) profile figure stands to the left of him. The profile figure wears a feline effigy headdress with a fanlike adorn ment that is characteristic of A God. These two figures have the same general correlations as in other cases where gods A and C are shown in the same scene: their respective sizes, the differences in clothing and decoration. Both personages hold transverse knives in their hands but they may not be engaged in combat, for in Moche scenes depicting fights it is not common for one of the figures to be represented full face. Each of the personages is pointing with his free hand. Interspersed among the stars are depictions of ulluchu or palta fruits, usually shown in ritual scenes (Hissink, 1951, ? 119; Larco Hoyle, 1938-39, tomo II, ? 93). To return briefly to the digging stick from the Huaca de la Cruz grave. I would argue that the buried "warrior-priest" associated with the older (c) god on the carving was probably the local governor priest, not a great military ruler and not an ordinary priest. If so, then C God can be identified with the anthropomorphic mythical person age heading various ceremonies in which either zoomorphic gods or humans participate (Bonnan, 1976, figs. 51 top and bottom,106; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 72; Larco Hoyle, 1938-39, tomo II, l?m. XXIII; Uhle, 1935, fig. 11) .^4 The governor-priest, impersonating the god, would lead pub lic rituals in real life, and most of the anthropozoomorphic mythical creatures (Pox, Osprey, Beer, Hummingbird, Jaguar and/or Puma and some others) have the social status of noble warriors, i.e., of the real participants in the important public rites. In this particular iconographie setting the occasional pre sence of Iguana God near the personage does not identify the personage as A God, because that trait differentiates A and personages only, not A and C. In fact it is quite probable that in ritual scenes clear dif ferentiation between gods A and C is impossible, and that the object of worship was a double deity (old/young, principal person/assistant). C and A personages have many similar functions and attributes: they are connected with the agricultural origins of Moche civilization (C cer tainly and A probably); one or the other is always represented in the scenes of human sacrifice and they are probably the beings shown with a decapitated human head in one hand and a transverse knife in the other (fig. 8; Harcourt and Nique, 1934, pl. 11:2; Moser, 1974, pp. 32,36 top; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 53; Seier, 1893, Taf. 21:16). They both have the feline as their alter ego: a counterpart to the C God figure mounted on the throne set in the mountains is similarly dressed but has a feline rather than a human head (fig. 9), while there is a Moche III antecedent of a jaguar flying on the back of a bird (Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Leipzig, formerly in Weimar) to the Moche IV A God figures in the same situation. Some probable Moche III representations of A God also have clear feline attributes (Kroeber 1925, pi. 57i; Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 74).</page><page sequence="12">12 There are two final groups of representations of C God. The first is an anthropomorphic figure wearing a headpiece and armed with a club, standing on a small pedestal (fig. 10; Larco Hoyle, 1966b, fig. 36). These figures in high relief stand at the foot of a vertical plane upon which are rays in low relief that surround the personage. In the second group, the figures have the same type of clothing and headdress as in the first (including some minor details), so they probably repre sent the same personage, but the rays are lacking (fig. 11; Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 295; Cuesta Domingo, 1972, fig. 16; Proulx, 1973, pi. 5d; Seler, 1893, Taf. 21:17). In this type of representation, the personage holds a club and darts (or darts and a shield) and stands in front of a mountain range, usually under an arch formed by a double headed snake. In both types of representation the figure usually (but not necessarily) has fangs. There is only one figure in these groups that has snakes near his belt and he is also the only one who has a shield but no club (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, fig. 295)? In spite of the fact that the figures of the first group are framed by rays and rays are characteristic of Rayed God, it is more likely that all the representations mentioned above are of C God and not the lunar deity. To support this opinion there is a press-molded design on a vessel that may be placed halfway between the Moche and Casma ceram ic styles (Carrion Cachot, 1959, fig* 55)? On one side of this vessel is the deity holding a maize plant and manioc and wearing a headdress from which some maize cobs sprout, while the same personage with a slightly different headdress stands on the other.^ Here rays which end in what are probably maize kernels project from his body to the left, right, and upwards. On later Casma designs, a rayed circle completely frames the figure of the god, the rays being, at the same time, stylized maize cobs which sprout from two staffs or stems that the god holds in his hands (Carrion Cachot, 1959, figs. 56,57)? These representations have some iconographie traits in common with the Moche V painting described above in which C and A gods are shown among the stars. In both cases C is represented full face with serpents projecting from his belt and (more distinctively) from his temples, the snake heads on the temples being connected by a wide band. The representations of C God among the stars and within a cir cular aureole make his hypothetical association with the sun probable (the Rayed God being the candidate for the moon god). Most published representations of C God are from the valleys of Santa and NepeSa, especially the vessels in the form of a maize god and the representations of a standing figure holding weapons and sometimes with an aureole. Rayed God It is much less difficult to identify this personage accurately than to differentiate gods A, B, and C. Representations of the Rayed God date only to Moche IY and V and may be divided into three main groups on the basis of style, time, and areal distribution.</page><page sequence="13">13 In most Moche V representations, Rayed God wears a mantle and has a headdress which is shown in profile as a row of from six to twelve flaring hands projecting upwards from a horizontal band. His body is surrounded by an aureole of straight rays terminating in serpent heads. He sometimes lacks this aureole and must be identified on the basis of his mantle and headdress alone. Such identification is possible when the god's figure is represented in the same iconographie setting as sur rounded by rays and without rays. Otherwise the identification cannot be made since there are anthropomorphic figures of secondary importance in some Moche Y paintings that are dressed in just the same manner as the Rayed God usually is (Bonnan, 1976, fig. 2). While Rayed God may have fangs, his face is sometimes entirely human. He either sails a totora raft (Benson, 1972, figs. 4-3,-4; Wbelohde-Doering, 1931, Taf. XII; Donn?n, 1976, fig. 72; Gonzalez, 1971, fig. 69; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 69; Willey, 1971, fig* 3-68) or is shown inside the crescent moon (Heyerdahl, 1975, fig* 40; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 72; Larco Hoyle, 1943, P* 290 top; Lavall?e, 1970, pi. 84a). In some of the paintings the stars are near the moon. The crescent may be seen as the celestial boat: Rayed God sits between the horns of the moon just as he rides his totora raft with its stern and bow curved sharply upward. In Middle and Late Moche IY and some Moche Y paintings, Rayed God wears a military shirt, skirt and headpiece, and holds a club and shield. On one Moche IY vessel fragment the star over his headpiece reminds one indirectly of his lunar nature (Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 54A) ? In this type of representation he always has fangs and an aureole. He is the most important person in the "Presentation" rite (fig. 12; Donnan, 1976, figs. 104,105,107,113; Tello, 1931, fig* 12) and the leader of the zoomorphic gods who suppress the revolt of the animated objects (Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 43; Hocquenghem and Lyon, 1981, fig. 5)? Humming bird and Osprey carry his litter and other gods dressed as warriors accompany him (Kutscher, 1954, Abb. 80) ? This last mentioned example is one of the earliest anthropomorphic representations of him in military attire. I have argued that it dates to the second quarter of period IY (Berezkin, 1978b). This group of Rayed God representations demonstrates his position at the head of the Moche IY-V pantheon. Rayed God and A God are shown as rivals in another painting from the first half of period IY (imbelloni, 1959, fig* 450). The adver saries hold knives and bags; A God is painted as light and the Rayed God is painted dark. I would not have hesitated to identify A God1s oppo nent as God had he not possessed rays projecting from his body. All representations mentioned to this point are from the Chicama, Moche, and Lambayeque valleys. Those of the third group seem to come only from the Chimb?te region although the provenience of some of them is uncertain. All of them date to early Moche IY, or perhaps to IIl/lY transition, and all have the same subject. The deity is carried in a litter, the porters and members of the cortege are small birds and animals (anthropomorphic hummingbirds, lizards, and mice). The litter poles terminate in feline heads, a stylistic trait also shown in later representations of Rayed God's litters. The appearance of Rayed God is</page><page sequence="14">14 variable here: his head may be that of an owl, falcon(?), or hummingbird (?), or it may be human; he may have rays or lack them; he may be dressed as a warrior or wear a mantle; etc. (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, figs. 355,356; Danzel, 1927, p. 9 right; Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 68 = 1954, Abb. 47; 1954, Abb. 79A,C; Larco Hoyle, 1938-39, tomo II, fig. 198, l?m. ). The crescent moon which is sometimes represented on the side of the vessel opposite this setting makes this semiornithomorphic personage the certain prototype of the later Moche moon deity. This series of scenes in which the iconography of the Moon God is so unstable perhaps marks an iconographie quest that ended in Middle Moche IY with the crea tion of the standard image of this personage corresponding to his new position as head of the pantheon, a position that replaced his probably marginal former status. His early avian associations are of prime impor tance in the understanding of his place in the Moche mythological system. The Goddess The last item in our review of the Moche pantheon is the only major Moche female mythical personage. She has not been mentioned ear lier either in my previous article (Berezkin, 1972) or by any other author. She has three important traits of appearance, any two of which combined are sufficient to identify her. The first is her long braided hair which is exclusive to females in Moche representation. Although Bonnan ( 1976, p. 28) contends that Moche men are sometimes also repre sented with plaits, he does not document his statement. He also mentions the "nude male figure who is lying on the ground being consumed by birds" (Bonnan, 1976, ? 82), but this figure, shown in his fig. 2b is clearly female with all the anatomical details delineated (compare Larco Hoyle, 1966a, p. 22 lower right). A second trait of the Goddess1 representation in Moche art is her headdress which appears as a horizontal band from which project two other bands. In profile representations one of these bands curves up and over her forehead while the other curves up and over her neck. In full face representations they curve out to either side of her head. One or, much more rarely, two additional flaring bands may project vertically over her head between the lateral ones. This headdress seems to be the same type as that on Moche Y Rayed God figures but with fewer flaring bands. The Hermit Crab God also wears it (Bisselhoff, 1957, fig? 1a). The third and last trait is a fanged mouth. The Goddess shares this trait with other anthropomorphic personages and, as is the case with B, C, and Rayed gods, she may be represented either with or without fangs. Most frequently the Goddess is shown in the "Presentation" scene holding a cup and a disc (shallow gourd dish or lid?) (fig. 12; Bonnan, 1976, figs. 104,106,108,112,113; Tello, 1931, fig* 12)J6 Together with Owl God she is the probable organizer of "the revolt of the animated objects" which is suppressed by the zoomorphic gods led by Rayed God. Following this defeat she is humiliated and led by Fox before the moon deity (Kutscher, 1950a, Abb. 43)? One can speculate that she was killed and exposed naked and dead, for she is surely represented</page><page sequence="15">15 "being devoured by vultures (Donn?n, 1976, fig. 2a top left): her naked figure has a fanged mouth and braids, sufficient traits to identify it as the Goddess. In the same painting, further to the right, A God, accompanied by Iguana God, administers justice and inflicts punishment on the vultures, probably as vengeance for their participation in the humiliation of the Goddess. On the opposite side of the vessel, the funeral ceremony is represented, with A God and Iguana God shown twice: at the top of the scene they are lowering the coffin into the grave, and at the bottom they are holding rattle staffs (Donnan, 1976, fig. 2c). Most probably the buried personage is the Goddess, for her face (or face mask) is the same as the one of the female being devoured by vultures. The third group of Goddess representations consists of modeled vessels, also published by Donnan (1976, figs. 66,67) in the form of an anthropomorphic personage with braided hair, a fanged mouth, and with lice or louselike little humans all over her body. Conclusions For the sake of brevity we shall confine ourselves to a few remarks on the interpretive portion of the research. 1. A and gods do not seem to be twins as suggested by Benson (1972, p. 32)? Rather they correspond to personages of different mytho logical generations like Pachacamac and Vichama (Calancha, I638, lib. II, cap. XIX, pp. 412-414) or Con and Pachacamac (Lopez de Gomara, cap. CXXII; I852, p. 235) in coastal myths recorded at the time of the conquest. 2. The Goddess and A God are somehow connected, since he took upon himself the organization of the burial ceremony and vengeance for the humiliation of the Goddess. If God were the patron of the race exter minated by the animated objects led by the Goddess, it is natural to expect friendly relations between the Goddess and A God, who is B's adversary. 3? A God and Iguana God often appear in a situation where they occupy two symmetrical positions to the right and left of some central object or space. In battle scenes Iguana always takes the side of A God but has a subordinate role (we here exclude Moche III representations of combat between an anthropomorphic personage and some reptile since it is not clear which god is represented or whether the enemy is Iguana; see Ravines, n.d., p. 9)? These facts suggest that probably A God and Iguana God (rather than gods A and B) are twins, and that C God may be their father or patron. 4* Some speculations can be advanced regarding the probable friendly nature of the relationship between God and Rayed God. The lunar deity is the victor over the Goddess and her band of animated objects, and thus is the potential enemy of A God. The totora rafts of God and Rayed God meet in a common scene (Ubbelohde-Doering, 1931? Taf. XIl) with no hint of a confrontation between the two deities. Rayed God fights with A God (imbelloni, 1959, fig. 430) just as God usually does, or perhaps it is God himself who fights but has the attributes (rays)</page><page sequence="16">16 the lunar deity. 5? Many characteristics of 16th and 17th century coastal mythology can he better understood and explained after elucidating Moche mythology. The most important similarities among all these bodies of mythology, as well as other South and Central American mythology lie not in the sphere of concrete themes and motifs, but rather in the main structural schemes. Ac kno wl e dgemen t s I wish to thank many individuals in Russia for their help in making possible my study of ancient Peruvian cultures. I am especially grateful to Prof. R.T. Kinzhalov whose perpetual support ensured the pro gress of my work. I am indebted to all my foreign correspondents, espe cially to Dr. Duccio Bonavia, for the publications and information received, without which no work could have been accomplished at all. My special thanks are due to Dr. L* Dr?ger and Dr. R. Krusche for their kind permission to let me look through the Peruvian collection of the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Leipzig, one of the few that I was able to see with my own eyes. I am profoundly grateful to Prof. J.H. Howe who organized the publication of the paper and whose insightful remarks concerning its con tents has encouraged my further study of the problem. I also thank Dr. James W. YanStone for his friendly help. April 6, 1978 NOTES 1 Unfortunately we cannot use the mural at Panamarca which shows two gods in combat for it is impossible to see the details in published pho tographs (Bonavia, 1974, fig* 31 ) and the drawing is inaccurate (Schaedel, 1951 ? cover). It is probable though not certain that the animal is a dog (Benson, 1972, p? 34)? It is perhaps appropriate to mention here that among the Cayapa Indians of Ecuador a trait peculiar to one of the gods is that he is accompanied by a dog (Barrett, 1925, pt. II, p. 353)? ^Despite the considerable distortions in Uhlets drawing, the pair ing of feline and bird effigy headdresses on the anthropomorphic personage and on Iguana God are clearly recognizable. ^1 consider this double-headed snake to be the Moche version of the "world tree"; see Kechua, Mojo and Moseten analogies in Yalcarcel, 1959, p. 141 and Metraux, 1942, pp. 26,75? Recuay beliefs may perhaps be similarly reconstructed (Grieder, 1978, pp. 138-142,187-189)? The concept is probably universal (ivanov and Toporov, 1974, ? 154)? 5 I sincerely thank Elizabeth P. Benson for her kindness in sending me a copy of her manuscript concerning Moche men with coca bags. It was of great help in correcting some of my misinterpretations.</page><page sequence="17">17 In marine scenes as well as many others, the representational pat tern often repeats twice or more around the body of the vessel or down the textile, so the figure of the same personage ( God in this set of scenes) may he painted or woven more than once on the same piece. In cases of multiple representations of the same personage shown engaged in different actions, we have treated each activity independently. Benson argues (1972, p. 34) that the step-and-wave is a sea symbol, but it is much more probably a stylized or symbolic version of a moun tain, or may even have multiple meanings. Kroeber (1926, pi. YI:6) published another vessel with a similar representation as Chimu style. I cannot judge from the photograph whe ther or not he is correct, but in any case the theme is of Moche origin. "While the presence of Iguana God in one of these representations (Larco Hoyle, 1966b, fig. 53) proves that the anthropomorphic personage is not God, it leaves us uncertain as to whether it is A or C. It is not likely C God, however, since this god is always shown as rather inactive, much more frequently sitting or standing than walking or doing something, so an air trip seems an inappropriate situation for him. The same rea soning is used as the basis of our identification of A in preference to C in several other settings. Q There are numerous modeled and some press-molded representations of this iconographie setting. Benson (1972, p. 32) identifies the birds as cormorants. While I cannot prove her wrong in all cases, at least sometimes these creatures are surely vultures. 10 In the identification of fish species I follow Bonnan (1976). 11 In fact and C gods may have something in common; I argue that both are mythical personages of an older generation (than younger A God). 12 In one case his body may consist of Capsicum peppers (Harcourt, 1948, fig. 123; see Lavall?e, 1970, pl. 870). 13 One or two anthropomorphic figures whose faces lack any mythical traits and whose bodies merge into the cobs sometimes occur near the main (C God) maize deity (Baessler, 1902-03, vol. Ill, figs. 291,292; Br?ger, 1964, cover; Schmidt, 1929, ? 176:4)? Icono graphic ally (and I think thematically) they have little in common with the supposed A God figure adjoining the same maize god. 14 During the "Presentation" ceremony studied by Donnan (1976) C God is not always a leader; if Rayed God takes part in the ritual, then C God (Donnan, 1976, fig. I04, personage "D") renders homage to him. 15 He holds a cup in one hand and a piece of cloth in the other. These attributes connect him to the figures taking part in the sacrifice of prisoners and in the Presentation rites (e.g., Donnan, 1976, fig. 15? Larco Hoyle, I946, fig. 20).</page><page sequence="18">18 1 6 In his figs. 104,106, and 108 Donnan labels this personage "C," but refers to her representation in fig. 113 as depicting trBff by which letter he has earlier identified the Osprey ("part bird and part human11) (Donnan, 1976, pp. 117.127). This personage possesses two of the three characteristics of the Goddess (special headdress and plaits). As for the "three featherlike objects on the back" they cannot be seen as "counterparts of the wings on figure B" (same source p. 127), for only insect wings were treated in a similar way by Moche artists. These objects are most probably not wings at all, but some sort of decoration, the same as on the Goddess1 dress in fig. 12. BIBLIOGRAPHY Anton, Ferdinand 1972 The art of ancient Peru. G.P.
