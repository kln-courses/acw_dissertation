<plain_text><page sequence="1">2 HUMAN BIOLOGY: A CATHOLIC REVIEW Ralph L. Holloway and Elisabeth Szinyei-Merse Columbia University This review covers the literature in human biology from May 1968 through June 1970. Given the option of reviewing all of the field or con- centrating in some particular area, as have previous reviewers, we de- cided to opt for the former approach, fully realizing that any total com- pilation and evaluation of sources would be impossible. Indeed, it has been necessary to delete almost the entire subarea of primatology, since this alone would be a review of considerable length. For here the out- put of first-rate studies, monographs, and coherent volumes has finally superseded the mid-1960's approach, which was often overly speculative and without the careful scientific work and analysis characteristic of today's literature. Four or five volumes alone have been published on the chimpanzee (Bourne 1969, Hofer 1969, Reynolds 1969). Still, this review is longer than usual, and it hopefully reflects the enormous amount and diversity of effort taking place in many areas of significance to human biology today. The reviewing task was broken down as follows: E. S-M. covered the topics of molecular, cyto-, and human genetics, polymorphisms, chromo- somes, and primate blood groups; R. H. reviewed sections on paleoan- thropology (also Tertiary primates), human ethology, brain, behavior, and language, and traditional areas such as human variation, adapta- tion, growth, secular trends, paleopathology, and evaluation of introduc- tory texts and readers, and some thoughts on the future directions of human biology ("Retrospect"). The task of writing this review has indeed been an enriching experi- ence, but certainly a humbling one, since we uncovered the territories of our own ignorance and felt the frustrations of not being able to thor-</page><page sequence="2">86 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE oughly evaluate areas outside our competence or synthesize the last two years of research with all of the past. We offer the final section "Retrospect" purely as a basis for further thought and discussion, in the hope that some reexamination of the re- lationship between the biological and social sciences will occur. Our purpose is not narrow, nor is it to chide anyone; it is very broad, and offered as a catalyst toward fuller resolution of the problems of holism, specialization, and communication between those involved in the study of man as a biosocial animal. Introductory Texts and Readers The ever-increasing popularity of physical anthropology is reflected not only by the number of articles appearing in different journals but also by the demands placed on publishers to supply texts and readers for an expanding educational market. This is salutary, in that increasing numbers of senior high school students and college undergraduates be- come exposed to some anthropology providing a basic exposure to hu- man origins and variation. Prior to 1967 only a few texts were available, and these were of a more catholic coverage, such as Comas (1960), Montagu (1960), Buettner-Janusch (1966), and G. A. Harrison et al. (1964), mostly directed to the advanced undergraduates, graduates, or professionals. Texts by Campbell (1966), Lasker (1961), Hulse (1963), and Kraus (1964) were exceptional in being geared to the beginning student, as was the excellent book by Howells (1967). Since 1967 both the quality and the emphasis have clearly changed. In general, the qual- ity is lower, although some exceptions certainly exist. R. J. Harrison and Montagna (1969) have a good paperback on essentials of human biol- ogy, oriented toward adaptive processes. Clegg's (1968) book is well written, making a good beginning text in human biology, stronger in genetics and evolutionary processes. Downs and Bleibtreu (1969) and Bleibtreu (1969) have presented good introductions to the area of hu- man variation, the latter selection being more advanced and concerned with evolutionary process and adaptation. Advanced students can profit from the Intemational Biological Program's guide to field methods ed- ited by Weiner and Lourie (1969). Another introductory text, giving a wider view of human evolution, has been published by a nonspecialist, Adams (1968). The McKern and McKem (1969) text is of weaker quality. Possibly the best text for beginning students is that by Kelso (1970), which is good for both human origins and variation. For those more interested in human ori-</page><page sequence="3">HUMAN BIOLOGY 87 gins, Pilbeam's (1970a) book is clearly written and is recommended. A well-written but sometimes inadequately referenced book has been published by Pfeiffer (1969). For those more interested in the history of evolutionary thought, there is Young's (1970) book, but it contains very little of substance regarding concrete factors in human evolution. Fried (1968) has reedited his earlier reader; the second edition is also in two volumes, the first combining physical anthropology, archeology, and linguistics. This is a good reader, if accompanied by a quality text- book such as Adams, Kelso, or Pilbeam. Another reader, by Washburn and Jay (1968), offers a rather uneven set of papers of broad perspec- tive on human evolution. It is a publication of a group called the "Soci- ety for the Study of Human Evolution." Montagu's (1968) reader is broader, and has republished some excellent papers by Hockett and Ascher, Count, Caspari, A. I. Hallowell, and Ginsburg and Laughlin. Human Variation and Adaptation Pigmentation. Szabo et al. (1969) have reported on easily recog- nized differences in the host cells of the melanosomes, the keratinizing Malpighian cells, finding that in Orientals and Caucasians these are dispersed in groups inside the Malpighian cells. In Negroids most mel- anosomes are dispersed individually inside the same cells. Cerson and Szabo (1969) reported on the effects of a single gene substitution be- tween two strains of mice on the melanocyte system. The difference between C57BL and DBL strains was not in the numbers of epidermal or dermal melanocytes but in the morphology, the DBL melanocytes being larger, with fewer and shorter dendrites. The melanocytes of the DBL strain also gave less melanin to Malpighian cells. They conclude that these effects are autonomously determined. A symposium, edited by Urbach (1969), provides a number of excellent papers on the effects of ultraviolet radiation on the skin, and the old hypothesis of lighter skin being adaptive through increased production of vitamin D in regions of lower light intensity has received more attention recently through the work of Loomis (1967, 1970). An improved version of the polygenic model of inheritance of human pigmentation is given by Stern (1969), based on newer estimates of contributions of white genes to Negroes (see p. 133, this review). Sweat glands. Newman (1970) provides a speculative review of the human proclivity for both thirst and sweating, suggesting that the forest-to-savanna transition increased the heat load on early hominids, and that loss of body hair and increased distribution of sweat glands</page><page sequence="4">88 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE was adaptive. Knip (1969) counted sweat glands, using hot bath water as a stressor on both males and females. Females showed a greater average density than males, which is accounted for by the smaller body surface. Roberts, Salzano, and Willson (1970) studied the distribution of sweat glands in the Caingang Indians, finding no differences of a racial nature in number of active glands or bodily distribution. Ojikutu (1970) compared African males and females to Europeans in West Africa and found that Africans were able to keep a lower deep body and skin temperature over a longer period of time. He also found that the sweat rate was greater in Africans, whereas the sweat suppression rate was lower. Sinuses, ducts, noses, earwax. A valuable review by Blanton and Biggs (1969) has shown that no one adaptive function of the paranasal sinuses has yet been accepted, leaving some nine functions as tenable. Wolpoff (1968a) has found that a cranial series from Alaska to Australia verifies predictions of a moisture variable correlated with nasal form (breadth and height of nasal aperture), suggesting that the function of the nose is to warm and moisten air passing over mucous membranes, and ac- cepts Hooton's argument that Neanderthals had long noses to warm the air so as to keep the brain at constant temperature. He also cites data that relate nasal breadth to intercanine distance and dietary factors. A related paper by Glanville (1969) finds strong correlations between nasal breadth, prognathism, and intercanine distance. He also suggests that selection acting on the dental arch or maxilla could produce sec- ondary changes in nasal index, or that interpopulation variation in prog- nathism may be a secondary effect of selection acting on the nose. Un- fortunately, the selective pressures are never quite identified. Wolpoff's methods and reasoning appear the stronger of the two. R. H. Post (1969b,c) has studied the sizes of tear ducts in skulls of various human groups and argues that they are an example of relaxed selection pressure. He found the ducts smaller in Caucasians than in Negroes, and the frequency of dacryocystitis more common in Cau- casians and in females, where the ducts are smaller than in males. How- ever, he never indicates what factors might be related to larger ducts, such as greater tear flow, adaptation to warmer and more humid envi- ronments, or larger nares. If the ducts are getting smaller through ac- cumulating mutations and relaxed selection, one would suppose that genes for larger ducts would also accumulate, and thus the range of duct size should be largest in groups with the smallest average size. Certainly these interesting observations deserve more attention and analysis.</page><page sequence="5">HUMAN BIOLOGY 89 Martin and Jackson (1969) studied the cerumen (earwax) types in 432 Indians from Mississippi, finding the frequency of the autosomal dry recessive type to be intermediate between that for Indians of west- ern North America and Mayan groups of southern Mexico. McCollough and Giles (1970) find that the wet type, controlled by a dominant gene W, is related to humidity, increasing in frequency from North China and Mongolia to the south (New Guinea). The selective agent remains unknown; it may be related to ototic infections. High altitude. A large number of publications were related to high- altitude adaptation, much of it redundant. De Jong (1970) lists a num- ber of demographic variables to be approached in such studies. A skill- ful review by McClung (1969) shows that altitude has the effect of lowering birth weight, with more pronounced effect in Caucasians than in Peruvian Indians, but the answers as to why remain hidden. Another review by P. T. Baker (1969) evaluates the questions used in recent research and offers reasons why the mechanisms underlying physio- logical differences remain unclear. A more general review of adapta- bility problems is given by Lasker (1969a). Frisancho's (1969, 1970) studies show that high-altitude adaptations include smaller stature, in- creased lung volume, and a predominance of the right ventricle of the heart, all resulting from adjustments during prenatal and postnatal de- velopment, thus not favoring a genetic explanation. (A Federations Proceedings, International Symposium on Altitude and Cold, 1969, No. 3, contains some 75 papers on the topic. A Symposium on Human Adap- tation in 1970, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthro- pology, contains ten papers on cold and altitude adaptation; most are merely programmatic statements published in detail elsewhere.) Han- non et al. (1969) measured skin folds and chest circumference in eight college girls on the summit of Pike's Peak for 2.5 months. Reductions were found in skin-fold thickness and limb circumference, but little if any change in body weight, with but a slight increase in chest circum- ference. Little (1969) investigated temperature regulation in both Que- chua Indians and U.S. whites. Using the method of foot exposure to cold water and air, he found Indians able to maintain substantially higher skin temperatures, but this became less marked with increased cold exposure. Little attributes the differences to diurnal variations in bodily temperatures, suggesting that more measurements are needed at the same time of day. Lee et al. (1969) have experimented with albino rats and cold, finding that rats raised at lower temperatures (500 C) showed smaller measurements at all ages, slower growth rates, rela- tively shorter tails and feet, but a body weight similar to controls. They</page><page sequence="6">90 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE suggest that reduced blood flow was responsible for the changes. Per- haps more experimental research of this nature would be helpful. Hanna (1970a) tested the effects of chewing coca on exercise in Que- chua Indians, and found coca chewers (N = 6) had lower exercise and recovery rates plus higher blood pressures, thus indicating no meta- bolic advantage to coca chewing. Mazess (1969) studied exercise per- formance in both Indian and white high-altitude residents, finding no significant differences between subjects at submaximum exercise loads. At maximum loads, Indians all had higher (5-7 percent) 02 intake, and Mazess concluded that long-term exposure did result in advantages to performance. Heat. In addition to Ojikutu's (1970) work, Hanna (1970b) studied four groups of desert residents: Yaqui (N = 7) and mestizos (N = 10) showed no differences in physiological response. Between five Papago Indians and five white students, the Papago had significantly lower sweat rates and rectal temperatures, but none showed any acclimatiza- tion effects. Finally, acclimatized Yaquis and mestizos responded inter- mediately between unacclimatized and acclimatized whites reported in the literature. Hanna concludes that arid desert acclimatization does not result in maximum acclimatization to humid heat. Hair. Last, Harvey and Brothwell (1969) have reviewed the subject of Ainu hairiness, presenting new data on hair distribution on chest, back, and face of Ainu and Ainu-Japanese hybrids. The Ainu are more hairy than the Japanese, but cannot be considered exceptionally hairy when compared with Caucasians. Growth studies. Parkin et al. (1969) have studied radiographs for 41 twin pairs (fraternal and identical) within 72 hours of birth to exam- ine the effects of genetics, sex, and nutrition on ossification centers in the lower limb. They find the intrauterine factor to be the most impor- tant determinant of both appearance and size of centers, the effects being marked in late development, whereas sex differences affect size the least. Wingerd (1970) used a method of curve fitting that trans- forms the time scale to give growth measures in a straight line, thereby giving distance, velocity, and acceleration relative to group means for each child. Based on the heights and weights of 7,000 children from the Oakland area, parent-child correlations in length showed a marked in- crease from birth to one year. The increase was much less for weight, and father-son, mother-daughter correlations were higher than opposite sex matchings. There was no evidence for parent-child correlations in racial groupings. In a study on Buriats, Russians, and Uzbeks, Mikla-</page><page sequence="7">HUIMAN BIOLOGY 91 shevskaya (1969) studied the differences in head and face growth from one to 19 years. There were two ages of pronounced growth differences, fetal and in puberty, where male exceeds female, and male face growth at puberty undergoes a marked increase. The foot follows the same pat- tern of change. This study claims an overall increase in all head diame- ters during the last 25 years. Two related studies were done by Frisch and Revelle. They hypothesized (1969a) that a specific body-weight attainment was associated with a peak of adolescent growth spurt, which would be critical for the appearance of menarche and would be signaled by a chemical or energy-balance change that would affect metabolic rates, in turn reducing the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to estro- gen, altering ovarian-hypothalamic feedback. This extremely interesting hypothesis surely deserves more study and should be a challenge for those in the growth field to test. In an earlier report (1969b) they com- pared seven Latin American countries with seven Asian countries, using cross-sectional data and caloric estimates. Differences in average mature body weights in each continent ranged from 16 to 22 percent. The two groups did not differ in height but did in weight, those in the Latin American countries being about 9 kg. heavier, even though caloric esti- mates did not differ significantly, leading them to conclude that the cause is genetic in origin. Using such gross methods, it is difficult to see how such conclusions are warranted. A number of growth studies in different geographic regions were pub- lished, adding to our knowledge of human variability. Tiisala et al. (1969) have worked on a mixed longitudinal study of healthy Finnish children, ages 1-5. Dallaportas (1969) provides data on Ethiopian chil- dren of the Gondar area, comparing his results to published studies from Kampala, Ibo, Tutsi, and Hutu groups. Malcolm (1970) reports on the Bundi children of the New Guinea highlands, which show the slowest growth rates in the world, with a calculated menarchal age of about 18 years, and hypothesizes that genes for rapid growth and greater size have been selected out as an adaptation to suboptimal nutrition. One wonders how such a hypothesis can be proved without precise knowl- edge of nutrition, cultural practices, and empirical evidence for nega- tive selection against rapid growers. Friedlander and Bailit (1969) studied tooth eruption on Bougainville Island in New Guinea, finding no significant sex differences for deciduous teeth, whereas eruption time for permanent teeth was significantly earlier in females. Related to other groups such as European whites, Japanese, and Pima Indians, these children were advanced, but they were similar to Africans. Doornbos,</page><page sequence="8">92 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE Jonxis, and Visser (1968) studied Bush Negro children in Dutch Guyana, providing some interesting comparative views of mothers' milk produc- tion, which should be followed up by more intensive research on cul- tural and dietary factors associated with treatment of lactating mothers. During the first six months, length and weight increases of children do not differ from those in Amsterdam, but after this, the differences be- come considerable, where the fiftieth percentile for height from six months to eight years compares to the third percentile in Amsterdam. Breast milk studies up to one and a half years showed protein content considerably lower than in Western countries. The mean values of pro- tein, fat, lactose, and calcium were usually lower in the Bush Negro, but maximum values were higher, particularly in protein and calcium. The authors suggest that although mothers have plenty of milk and nurse freely, the warm climate increases demand for liquids, leading to more sucking, stimulating the breast to high productivity, decreasing the protein concentration. This study leaves many questions for further research, particularly in terms of genetic selection, diet, and cultural factors associated with these. Hopefully more studies of this kind will be done. Wolanski and Jarosz (1970) found a heterotic growth effect by study- ing stature and chest circumference of offspring in relation to the dis- tance (geographical) between parents. As the proportion of marriages between distant mates increased, so did the heterotic effect for a popu- lation in Szczecin, Poland. No effect was seen for head shape or circum- ference. Trotter and Peterson (1969) reported on fetal bone weights (dry, fat-free) for 124 American white and Negro skeletons between 16 and 44 weeks. There appeared to be significant racial but not sexual differences in limb length but not in skeletal weights. Adolph (1970) made an interesting study of 12 species of animals for the ages at which 6 to 16 growth properties first appear, finding that sequences in growth stages differed especially between species with short vs. long gestation periods. Most stage-marks of growth followed one another at ages pro- portional to overall development, hence offering hope for interpolating when data are missing. An outstanding review of human growth data and processes is given by Tanner (1970), and McCammon (1970) has published detailed summaries of data collected by the Child Research Council of longitudinal studies between 1927 and 1967 in the Denver area. This book includes chapters on health histories, electrocardiog- raphy, vital signs, nutritional intake, anthropometry, skin folds, x-ray measurements, skeletal maturation, hematology, serum proteins, and</page><page sequence="9">HUMAN BIOLOGY 93 cholesterol. In addition to this very useful book, human biologists will find Altmann and Dittmer's (1968) reference handbook on metabolism a useful compilation of all foods and their corresponding energy values for further work linking human physiological parameters to energy utili- zation and adaptation. Finally, as a comment on our times, only one study appeared in the more common sources examining the effects of urban poverty on prenatal nutrition and growth. Naeye et al. (1969) found that the infants of poor mothers were on the average 15 percent smaller, showing mutiple anatomical evidence for prenatal undernutri- tion. Hopefully, the physical anthropologists will soon turn their atten- tion to the demographic facts that exist for millions of people in our own country. Indeed, Lasker (1970) has made such a hope explicit in his examination of the potential practical value of physical anthropology oriented toward general biological processes in man. Secular trends: menarche. One of the most interesting examples of secular trends over the years, in addition to stature, is that of the age of menarche. Most studies have reported the raw facts of the trend, but we are not certain of the causes or the pathways affecting the change; dietary factors seem the most likely, although not sufficient as a single explanation. A review of this problem has been given by Zacharias and Wurtman (1969). There are two historical studies by Amundsen and Diers (1969, 1970). The first surveyed Classical Greek and Roman rec- ords of medical and judicial sources, which suggest a modal age of 13-14 years. Of course, these sources are difficult to evaluate, and this age seems frankly early compared to existing data for trends in other cur- rent European groups. The 1970 study examined the age of menopause based on the same kinds of sources, with a modal age of 50 and a range of 40 to 50, with a maximum of 60 years. Curiously, the sources suggest a negative correlation between age at menarche and age of menopause. Interesting as these studies might be, it is questionable how reliable they are. Damon et al. (1969) studied 66 white mothers of high socio- economic status and their 78 daughters. The daughters' average age of menarche was 12.88; the mothers' was 14.38, and the authors claim a very high reliability of recall. The coefficient between mothers and daughters for menarcheal age was .24 and for stature it was .41, sug- gesting that physical growth and sexual maturation were somewhat separate processes. The authors point out that nutritional differences can account for only part of the difference, thus leaving open the pos- sibility that other factors, possibly of a psychosocial nature, are oper- ating.</page><page sequence="10">94 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE An interesting comparison of menstrual cycles after menarche was made between European and Bantu girls by Baanders-Van Halewijn and De Waard (1968). The hypothesis was given that first ovulation (ovularche) was the same average age as menarche, yet there would be earlier menarche in one group because of an earlier onset of anovula- tory mechanisms. In fact, both were earlier in Dutch girls, with higher percentages of ovulatory menstrual cycles in both 13- and 15-year-olds. A second part of their discussion, on the endocrine and cytological as- pects of these processes, was neither comparative nor conclusive. Fri- sancho et al. (1969) have worked out a method of prediction and retro- spective assessment utilizing radiographs of the first metacarpal sesa- moid, fusion of distal II phalanx, which appear to be steroid-mediated events. This study was done with 110 Ohio whites and gave a standard error of one and a half months, with a multiple correlation coefficient of .925. The regression equation was applied to an independent Denver sample and gave similar results, but in a Guatemalan sample gave later, retarded results, as expected. Hopefully, this technique will be applied in several more societies, and could become a valuable tool for assessing menarcheal age. Laska-Mierzejewska (1970) studied Polish girls from three occupa- tional groups to assess the effects of ecological and socioeconomic con- ditions in menarche, body height, and weight. All groups were rural, but were differentiated with respect to farming as against nonagricul- tural working. The mean age for these rural groups was 14.04, with sta- tistically significant differences between all three groups, the age of menarche increasing from nonagricultural labor to farming exclusively. This order was repeated in all regions studied, but the reasons remain unexplained. Aw and Tye (1970) studied 2,328 girls in Singapore based on status quo rather than retrospective methods. The average age of menarche was 12.69, with 12.98 for low-income girls, 12.66 for middle-income, and 12.40 for high-income. The differences were significant. The authors then used the retrospective method for 1,311 university entrants, find- ing an average of 12.81 for the whole sample, 13.09 for early entrants, and 12.71 for late entrants. (Why?) The authors conclude there was no discrepancy in methods, and find their results closely similar to those for girls in Hong Kong and Cuba. No analysis is offered. A related paper by Eveleth and Souza Freitas (1969) studied tooth eruption and men- archeal age in children born in Brazil of Japanese parents. The men- archeal age was 12.85 compared with 14.03 in Japan, suggesting im- proved economic conditions, but the question of migrant selection is not</page><page sequence="11">HUMAN BIOLOGY 95 considered. As expected, there was an advance in secondary dental eruption in females and in the anterior teeth of both sexes. Cultural fac- tors and other biological profiles are not sufficiently studied; the nature of diet, living density and conditions, interaction between sexes, etc., are not mentioned. This phenomenon is an important one, particularly in a world where further population increase is critical. The effect of lowered age of menarche, without an increase in adolescent "sterility" would be logically to increase world-wide fecundity and natality rates. This should be reason enough for more careful and deeper studies of this phenomenon, in addition to its interest as a secular phenomenon which might relate a biological attribute with cultural behavior. While the world focuses on the female and her liberation, only one study dealt with the age of puberty in boys, which one assumes is also a secular trend. Daw (1970) did a neat little study on voice-breaking in J. S. Bach's choir members from 1727 to 1749. The data analyzed by Daw were from historical records of the choirs, and suggest a secular trend of roughly four years from 1740 to 1959. The Bach choir members showed few voices breaking at an earlier age than 16 years, fewer com- pletely broken by 17, most voices breaking at 18, most completely broken between 1732 and 1832, and unusually late development resulting in so- pranos and altos of 19 and 20 years. Obviously, this is a selected popu- lation, but still a provocative and entertaining study. Perhaps the male of the species might receive some further study in the future? Finally, Williams (1969) offered a highly speculative but interesting hypothesis that greater photic stimulation of the pineal gland would lower the age of first estrus, as suggested in some mice strains. Whether the human pineal is as sensitive to photic stimulation as that of mice is question- able; it would seem that photic stimulation and distribution of the secu- lar trend in menarcheal age would not correlate particularly well. Secular trends: stature, etc. Damon (1968) reported more on secular trends in stature and weight for old American families at Harvard between 1870 and 1965, thus comprising four generations: a signifi- cant increase in height between GI and GII (2.63 cm.); smaller, non- significant gains between GII and GIII (1.14 cm.); no rise between GIII and GIV; and a slight increase in weight between GIII and GIV. The ponderal index rose slightly to GIII, then fell, giving a significant dif- ference in GIV compared to the value in GI. Damon suggests that the secular trend may have ended in economically favored Americans, whereas weight may still be increasing. Interesting questions concern- ing genetic control and possible positive assortment of mating arise. Finally, Froelich (1970) reported on anthropometric increases among</page><page sequence="12">96 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE immigrants and the next two generations of Japanese Americans in Hawaii. Most changes were correlated with stature, reflecting a gen- eral body-size increase, with more rapid growth trends in males, termi- nating after the first American-born generation. These observations, like Damon's (1968) study, suggest that a maximum has been reached. The female metrical increases were more gradual, and extended into the third generation. Froelich sees the differences as related to factors of preferential treatment of males, but he does not spell this out. The skeleton. An outstanding addition to craniology has been pro- duced by DeVilliers (1968), representing the most complete study avail- able on the skulls of South African Negroes, blending biometrical and morphological observations. Murrill (1968) has studied both the cranial and postcranial remains on Easter Island. The volume edited by Broth- well (1968) contains some excellent chapters on the skeleton. Particu- larly useful are the review chapters by Hughes on skeletal plasticity, growth by Johnson (see also F. E. Johnson et al. ( 1969) ), and by Broth- well, Molleson, and Metreweli (1968) on the use of radiography to study normal variation. Knight and Lauder (1969) compared a number of tests for dating skeletal populations of known date, from 1,000 to 3,000 years. Acid dye staining, fat content, and free amino acids showed no correlation, but nitrogen did provide a reliable guide for bones less than 50 to 100 years old, thus indicating the need for a method involv- ing a longer spectrum. Eight papers were published in a symposium (American Journal of Physical Anthropology) for studying skeletal pop- ulations, which are useful for outlining approaches and methods but contain little of a substantive nature; these pale into insignificance when compared with the Brothwell (1968) volume. Another symposium on bone growth and markers (in vivo) was published by the same journal in 1968, showing a wide variety of techniques (chemical dyes, implants, natural markers) that will be of interest to students of bone growth. Of a more substantive nature, Moss (1968) elaborated on the impor- tance of the functional matrix in relation to form and growth of the mandible, arguing that genetic factors play only an initiatory role at best, all other changes in shape being secondary to and dependent in all instances upon the influence of the surrounding functional matrix. Baer and Harris (1969) have tested the view that the brain participates in a parapubertal growth spurt. Using longitudinal data on boys, they found two discrete systems: (1) the rapidly growing neural system com- plete by adolescence; (2) the facial system of slower but prolonged growth. Knott (1969) studied the ontogenetic changes of the segments</page><page sequence="13">HUMAN BIOLOGY 97 of the cranial base in four girls, giving detailed data on four distances and five angles. Riesenfeld (1969a) took out the incisors and excised the temporalis and masseter muscles of rats to study morphological changes. He found a decrease of symphysial angle, an increase in man- dibular angle, and a forward movement of the lower symphysial border ("chin"), and concluded that the chin is not a result of compressive forces produced by the external pterygoids, nor is it an adaptation to upright posture, but rather it is the result of shortening and hypofunc- tioning. Like Moss, he believes there are no genetic changes of bone form, only triggering effects. Curiously, he never mentions any of Moss's or Gruneberg's works. In another study, Riesenfeld (1969b), approached the old question previously explored by Weidenreich on the correlation of brachycephalization with head balance and upright posture. By am- putating forelimbs and severing the nuchal musculature on rats, he found no brachycephalic changes in his experiments. The solution to brachycephalization remains to be found. Herzberg and Dovitch (1968) studied the trabecular bone pattern of the mandible in a small series (eight) from six months prenatal to adulthood. The adult pattern is not evident before 15 years, and the patterns up until adulthood are very plastic and unstable. Larger sample sizes might give a better indication of patterning. Duterloo and Enlow (1970) made a comparative study of growth in human and macaque crania, indicating regions of deposi- tory and absorptive distributions for each bone. Marked differences were found in the cranial floor associated with the brain between monkey and human. Garn et al. (1969a) found that the X chromosome has a definite effect in the timing of ossification centers. Sister-sister correlations exceed those of brother-brother and sister-brother by an average of .16. In an- other report by the same group, Hertzog et al. (1969) showed that the discordance in ossification of hand-wrist centers is 3.5 times more in like-sex dizygotic twins than in monozygotic twins, and no sexual differ- ence in the incidence of discordance pairs was found. With respect to tibial and body length, Garn et al. (1969c) also found evidence for X linkage, and they reject hypotheses of selective inactivation of an X chromosome. This is supported by Garn and McCreery's (1970) study showing that the variability in ossification timing is greater in males, whereas the conception-corrected variability is greater in girls, suggest- ing a "dosage" effect of the extra X chromosome. Average sex-associated differences in skeletal maturity are given by Roche (1968), showing that differences for hand-wrist, knee, and foot-ankle are similar up to skeletal</page><page sequence="14">98 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE age of 66 months, after which hand-wrist rates are slower for males, the same pattern being found for knee and foot-ankle. A short, interesting paper by Garn et al. (1969b) reports that stan- dardized means of mesiodistal crown diameters show a range of .7 S.D.'s below to 2.1 S.D.'s above the Ohio reference population in some 15 other populations. Some of these have both relatively large molars and large incisors, whereas some have small incisors and large molars. The Pima Indians, Australian aborigines, and subfossil Sudanese exhibited marked canine reduction. Such comparisons should have an important message for those continuously generalizing about tooth size and selec- tive pressures such as tool use and diet. Sekla and Soukup (1969) made an interesting study on that battered and almost disreputable parameter, the cephalic index. They found that the cephalic index of infants did not correlate closely with that of the parents as a pair, but did so very closely with that of one parent, although no sex bias was apparent. On a study of possible genetic fac- tors in stature, Furusho (1968) found that the correlation coefficient between heights at maturation and at various ages during growth be- comes higher with decreasing difference in age, thus suggesting that the manifestation of genes controlling stature at completion of growth differs with both age and sex, and is modified by other factors during the adolescent growth spurt, a hardly surprising conclusion. A new analysis of sex differences in the human pelvis was offered by Coleman (1969), which won the Juan Comas Award for 1969. He used longitudinal roentgenograms, with the patterns of growth showing the same individual variation in males and females. He concluded that sex differences cannot be attributed to differential responses of one bone to sex hormones, and that the differences develop from complex variations in rates and directions of growth in local areas. Phenice (1969b) sug- gested that the ventral arch, subpubic cavity, and medial aspect of the ischiopubic ramus are highly sex-dependent, giving an accuracy of 95 percent in sexing. Papers on sex determination, estimated age, stature, and mortality of skeletal samples have been rewritten in the new Broth- well and Higgs (1969) volume of Science in Archaeology. Hertzog (1968) studied the associations between seven discontinuous cranial traits (accessory ossicles, parietal foramina, frontotemporal artic- ulation, etc.) in 366 crania representing six geographic racial groupings. He found 74 of 85 race-specific coefficients positive, 25 of them at the .01 level. Associations were naturally higher in adjacent areas. Using multivariate analysis, Benfer (1970) finds that Hertzog's (1968) seven</page><page sequence="15">HUMAN BIOLOGY 99 characteristics are largely independent of each other both between and within groups. Unfortunately, unless one is sophisticated enough to read his tables without some reference datum, the figures are meaningless, since one has no idea of what sort of values would indicate significant associations. For example, percent shared variance ranges from 4.74 in Asia to Amerindian sample of 11.29. What do these figures mean? Kellock and Parsons (1970) report on 30 nonmetrical variations for 1,254 crania of Australian aborigines, finding that ten of them account for 90 percent of variation, and that two groups can be discerned-(1) north and northwest and (2) southeast-but such data do not permit testing of homogeneous populations of hybridization. An outstanding review of the biology of nonmetrical cranial varia- tions, their distributions and genetical basis, is given by Berry (1968), explaining the usefulness of such data to distance statistics, genetic markers, and congenital diseases. And last, Howells (1969) has re- viewed the usefulness of multivariate analysis in studying single speci- mens and fragments, using the Fish Hoek and Keilor skulls as examples. The complete studies on at least 17 cranial populations and application to fossil hominids can be found in Howells (1968). Anthroposcopic variation. Bhalla and Kaul (1968) found that vari- ance in occipital hair whorls was useless for racial association, since there was greater variance within than between major racial stocks. Perhaps the observations would be more useful at population levels less gross than so-called "major stocks." Karve and Malhotra (1968) studied the biological features of eight endogamous groups of Brahmins in the Maharashtra region. Genetic and morphological features sug- gested independent origins of five of the groups. (But see the Current Anthropology treatment.) A good descriptive study of the Negroes of Charleston, South Carolina, is given by Pollitzer et al. (1970a). The analysis of 787 adults showed that females tended to be lighter in color than males and older subjects lighter than younger ones; estimates of ABO, Rh, and Hgb gene frequencies show this population to be about 5 percent mixed with whites, the more rural and suburban Negroes less mixed. A review article on body composition and fitness was published by Parizkova (1968) with C.A. treatment, showing differences in the pro- portions of lean body mass and fat related to adaptation for intense physical activity. An interesting study by Etemadi and Hosseini (1968) found a good fit between the frequency and size of muscle fibers and athletic body build. This study was marred by the small sample size,</page><page sequence="16">100 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZNYEI-MERSE however: three people, one athlete and two nonathletes. On the other hand, a study by Burr and Damon (1970) found no significant corre- lation coefficients between eosinophil counts, age, height, weight, pon- deral index, or somatotype. Polednak and Damon (1970) found that in a study of 2,090 Harvard men born between 1880 and 1916 the majority of those who were "major" athletes had the shortest lives, with "minor" athletes the longest. "Major" athletes tended to be fatter, more muscu- lar and stockier. These categories did not differ in death rate due to infections, neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease, or suicide. Looking toward somatotyping, Wilmore (1970) found that under- water determination of body fat and lean body weights validated the first and second components of the Heath-Carter method of somato- typing. Utilizing measures of standing height, body weight, and leg length, Munroe et al. (1969) developed regression equations that yield- ed somatotype ratings within the range of accuracy of expert raters, thus indicating no need for photography or subjective ratings based on pho- tography. Finally, Meredith (1970) has reviewed body weights and births in a worldwide summary of more than 270 groups between 1945 and 1965. Casey and Downey (1969) have compiled a sourcebook of anthropo- metric measurements on adult males for all racial groups, which has been published privately. Anyone using it should be cautious, since it contains an enormous amount of data compiled by computers, and could be a real source of errors unless carefully checked. The above references are hardly a complete compilation of works on human variation and adaptation. A number of things have impressed this reviewer (R.H.): (1) sample sizes are often so small as to be meaningless; (2) there is a good deal of replication of publishing in different but similar journals such as the American Journal of Physical Anthropology and Human Biology of high-altitude research and growth studies; (3) some of the symposia are merely programmatic and atten- uated abbreviations of articles published elsewhere or in the same jour- nal at another time, thus wasting valuable publishing resources; (4) there is little in the way of synthesis of gross morphology, physiology, biosocial interactions, and adaptive significance; (5) at times there is an almost indiscriminate use of multivariate analysis simply because it is a new technique. The area of human biology truly needs some "bring-</page><page sequence="17">HUMAN BIOLOGY 101 ing together," and it is suggested that one look to the psychologists for models patterned on the various handbooks published in that field. Paleopathology Nothing during the period of this review has been put forth to match the outstanding but extremely expensive volume edited by Brothwell and Sandison (1967), nor is there likely to be one in the very near future. However, Brothwell (1968) has edited a fine smaller book on The Skeletal Biology of Earlier Human Populations, with 13 excellent review articles, including three on paleopathology, one on Harris's lines, one on paleodemography by Angel, and a synopsis of work on the bio- chemistry of early skeletons by Lengyel. The famous Bog People of Iron Age Scandinavia are the object of a study published in English, authored by Glob (1969). Hopefully, a paperback edition may make these interesting examples of preservation and forensic sleuthing avail- able to undergraduates in physical anthropology. Two books on Ameri- can Indian prehistoric populations are also available: Morse (1969), a physician, has studied the diseases of Midwest Indians, and Phenice (1969a) the Indians from mound burials in north-central Kansas. Crosby (1969) has reexamined the old question of whether syphilis was a New World mutation, was brought over by the sailors with Co- lumbus, or was a form of yaws. The hypothesis is offered that trepo- nematosis appeared in the tropics as yaws, thus originating as a single disease, evolving into several related but distinct forms as men spread throughout the New World. Venereal syphilis is seen as the variant de- velopment in the cul-de-sac of America, from which it was probably introduced into Europe with the return of Columbus. P. W. Post and Daniels (1969) have provided a nicely illustrated paper on the histological and histochemical configuration of the scalps, shrunken heads, and mummified skin of various American Indian groups from a number of museum collections. Zaino (1968) studied the elemen- tal bone iron in Pueblo II Anasazi Indians (A.D. 0-1100), suggesting that their diets were adequate and that iron was equivalent to that of present-day values. Transverse (Harris's) lines of growth continue to be studied to gain possible information of past nutritional or disease stress. McHenry (1968) studied these lines in California Indians from three archeologi- cal horizons: (1) early (5000-2000 B.C.); (2) middle (2000 B.C.-A.D. 250); (3) late (A.D. 250-Hist.). There were 34 samples from each horizon.</page><page sequence="18">102 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE The highest frequency of lines appears in the order of (1) to (3), and the evidence from archeological analysis suggests an increased efficiency of subsistence economy from (1) to (3) also. Males and females showed equal frequency of transverse lines. Gill (1968) has done a similar study on recent and fossil Australian aborigines, but did not find any signifi- cant variation from control skeletons. Unfortunately, he does not de- scribe his controls. Dewey, Armelagos, and Bartley (1969) (see also Armelagos 1969) studied osteoporosis from burials in three Nubian levels: (1) Merotic (350 B.C.-A.D. 350); (2) X groups (A.D. 350-550); (3) Christian (550-1300). No differences were found. Resorption was less in males, however, as in other modern populations; the authors suggest that this difference was not related to estrogenic etiology but was possibly a function of extended lactation and/or inadequate cal- cium, which assumes, of course, that all his female sample did lactate! Van Gerven, Armelagos, and Bartley (1969) studied a sample of 23 females and 20 males from a Mississippian population of A.D. 1540-1700, finding no significant interaction of age, sex, or method variables and femoral cortical involution. Gindhaart (1969) used a sample of 107 boys and 94 girls from the Fels longitudinal series to study the appear- ance of transverse lines in relation to childhood illness. No differences were found between numbers of lines in adult stature and heavily and lightly medicated subjects. This leads her to doubt that there are growth arrest lines. Surely Marshall's (1968) review indicates that there are such things, but they have to be carefully studied, and one wonders whether adult stature is a good variable to use if compensatory growth is a possibility in modem populations. Soriano (1970) investigated the fluoritic origin of the famous bone exotosis of the Homo erectus femur, concluding that fluoritic intoxica- tion came from the ingestion of fruits and plants impregnated with fluorine from volcanic ash. Heizer and Napton (1969) have attempted to reconstruct the diets of Great Basin Indians by analyzing the Love- lock collection of prehistoric coprolites at Berkeley, where at least 5,000 specimens are available. Animal remains found in the coprolites includ- ed loose hairs of antelope, squirrel, bighorn sheep, and even consider- able human hair, as well as feathers. However, no endoparasites have yet been found, and an international symposium on human coprolites might be a welcome addition to the state of the art in human biology. Finally, Fry and Moore (1969) report finding Enterobius vermicularis, a human-specific pinworm, in coprolites from Hogup and Danger caves in western Utah, dating around 10,000 years ago.</page><page sequence="19">HUMAN BIOLOGY 103 R. G. Harrison et al. (1969), using serological micromethods, have demonstrated kinship between the mummies Tutankhamen and Smenkh- kare, both from 18th Dynasty Egypt. Both were blood-typed as A2 and MN, sharing identical anthropometric measurements. Paleoanthropology Miocene and Pliocene. The problem of Cercopithecine origins has been increasingly brought into focus by the far richer collections of Eocene and Oligocene candidates for pongid status and by the scant dubious monkey remains of the same periods. Simons (1970) has re- vived this problem and brought information on it up to date, warning that the apparent paucity of materials might be an artifact of discovery. Von Koenigswald (1969) has described earlier (1940's) discoveries from the East African Miocene, proposing two species of a new genus Vic- toriapithecus-V. macinnesi and V. leakeyi-the latter including a por- tion of proximal ulna, suggesting an arborial-adapted rather than a ter- restrially adapted form. Pilbeam and Walker's (1968) work in the Na- pak zone of northeast Uganda is an important addition, for this locality is presumably Early Miocene, and has yielded definite Cercopithecine remains. Indeed, the preliminary report suggests a Cercopithecine-Co- lobine split at around 19 million years. The tooth and frontal portion, particularly the internal aspect showing traces of both arcuate and rec- tus sulci is clearly Anthropoidea, closely related to a Colobine pattern, suggesting a divergence between Cercopithecoids and Hominoids in the Oligocene or even Eocene. Walker (1969) has briefly described a new fossil locality on Mt. Elgon, near Bukwa, in eastern Uganda, with a date of roughly 22 M.Y., yielding a large faunal collection, including Limnopithecus. Van Couvering and Miller (1969) have dated the lavas at Rusinga Island, Kenya, where numerous fossil hominoids have been found, at 18 M.Y. Extensive reviews of the distribution of faunal re- mains in southern continents have been published by Cooke (1968) for Africa, by Patterson and Pascual (1968) for South Africa (including the Pleistocene), and by Hershkovitz (1969, 1970b) for neotropical regions, particularly in the New World. Pilbeam (1969c) has reexamined the tali from Songhor and Rusinga, proposing that those from Rusinga represent Dryopithecus nyanze, whereas that of Songhor is D. major, further suggesting that several of the previously designated D. nyanze specimens from Songhor might better be seen as female D. major. Two specimens, long considered pongids (since 1918), Prohylobates</page><page sequence="20">104 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE tandyi and ? D. mogharensis, are considered by Simons (1969a) to be synonymous, and to be monkeys, which can be derived from the Oligo- cene Parapithecus. Tattersall (1968) has examined an Indian Miocene lorisoid mandible, YPM 19134, probably of a large type such as Indraloris, but it gives no clues to lorisoid ancestry, as it was already specialized. Prasad (1969a) has also critically reviewed the Siwalik anthropoids, claiming that Dry- opithecus, Sivapithecus, and Proconsul are three distinct but closely re- lated forms. He would apparently keep the three forms of africanus, nyanze, and major as separate species of the genus Proconsul on metric, morphological, and geographical grounds. Finally, Tattersall and Sim- ons (1969) reexamined two little-known isolated teeth from India: (1) YPM 16919, the only known hominid incisor from the Tertiary, which they regard as D. indicus; (2) a mandibular molar, known as "Adae- tontherium incognitum," which they regard as D. sivalensis. The pongids of Tertiary date from East Africa have been thoroughly and beautifully analyzed in the recent monograph by Pilbeam (1969d), utilizing both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. He sug- gests that D. major from Moroto and Napak, as well as from Songhor and Koru, might be ancestral to Gorilla gorilla, whereas D. africannis, from Songhor, Koru, and Rusinga might be ancestral to P. troglodytes. Earliest hominids. Pilbeam (1968) has also reviewed the earliest ho- minids, suggesting the inclusion of Sivapithecus africanus in the Dry- opithecus genus and the synonymy of Ramapithecus and Kenyapithe- cus. Pilbeam also takes serious issue with Sarich and Wilson's (1967) views that base hominid divergence on biochemically derived dates of 5 M.Y. (changed to 3.5 M.Y. by Sarich 1968), since the paleontological evidence suggests hominids (Ramapithecus) at 14 M.Y. Doolittle and Mross (1970) find that chimpanzee fibrinopeptides are identical with human molecules, whereas those of Old World monkeys differ from human in five to eight of the 30 amino acids. The authors suggest that this finding supports Sarich and Wilson. Read and Lestrel (1970) have examined other forms of curves to fit the immunological distance index, finding that either a linear or a simple power equation fits the data better than the exponential equation. Simons (1969c) has charted the two sets of evidence, the paleontological and biochemical, and finds no concordance for primate radiations. The question of constant rate of change of complex molecules is still critical, resting on unproved as- sumptions concerning mutations and selection processes. Prasad (1969b) agrees that Sivapithecus is pongid, but insists that</page><page sequence="21">HUMAN BIOLOGY 105 no fewer than three species existed, and at least two of Ramapithecus. He also argues that the Bramapithecus mandibular fragment assigned by Simons and Pilbeam (1965) to R. punjabicus should be given a dif- ferent species designation within the genus. He also claims that some of the S. sivalensis finds, as well as those called D. laietanus from north- ern Spain, should be called S. chinjiensis, a small-sized Siwalik pongid. Hopefully, Simons and Pilbeam will review all of these finds in a com- prehensive monographic treatment, and will continue to bring further clarity to this subject. To date there are only scattered references, for example Simons's (1969a) claim that the Fort Ternan "Kenyapithecus" is synonymous with Ramapithecus on the basis of morphology and faunal and temporal relationships, and represents an incursion from Eurasia. Expectedly, L. S. B. Leakey (1969b) takes exception to this view, regarding the genus as valid and of African origin, insisting that the full description of faunal remains has yet to be published, which will demonstrate their African origins. An unfortunate debate appeared with Pilbeam's (1969b) description of the BM (NH) (M15423) speci- men, donated 31 years ago to the museum by A. M. Sale (L. S. B. Leakey 1969c). Pilbeam claimed that it had been unidentified until now, and that it is very similar to the YPM 13814 specimen Ramapithecus. Leakey takes Pilbeam severely to task, claiming that Simons and Pilbeam iden- tified the piece in 1965 as D. laietanus, and gives the history of the piece. It is unfortunate that the editors of Nature did not allow Pilbeam opportunity to reply to Leakey's criticisms. On a more productive note, Tattersall (1969a) speculated on the probable ecological conditions under which the Siwalik Ramapithecus group may have lived. He argued that the environment was basically a tropical forest interspersed with broad rivers and tree savanna, and used the Nagri fauna to support this view. He further speculated that this ecological picture lent support to the view of Ramapithecus as an incipient bipedal hominid, increasingly utilizing its hands, which he correlated with the reduced face and anterior teeth, a view traditional in anthropological thought. Without pelvic, foot, hand, or limb bones or other cranial remains, not to mention a rather minute sample of teeth and jaws, such a view is indeed speculative, resting on a number of unproved assumptions. One wonders whether faunal analysis of Mio- cene/Pliocene age can really lend support to any one view of hominid evolutionary dynamics. Aside from an aquatic ecological zone, one could argue for incipient bipedalism on any ecological basis. L. S. B. Leakey (1969a) does not agree with Tattersall's interpretation of the ecology</page><page sequence="22">106 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE from faunal types, and is rebutted by Tattersall (1969b), the issue re- volving about how forested or savanna-like were the fauna. The Gigantopithecus materials have received attention from Pilbeam (1970b), Simons and Ettel (1970), and Groves (1970), based largely on the analysis of dietary masticatory mechanics and tooth wear by Jolly (1970). As long appreciated, Gigantopithecus is not hominid but a large pongid, found in both India and China, whose canines func- tioned more as large grinding teeth, with a concomitant molarization of P3, a condition approached to varying degrees in both mountain gorilla (Groves) and in the Gelada baboon (Jolly). Simons and Chopra (1969) described a new species of Gigantopithecus from India, G. Bi- laspurensis, from Dhok Pathan beds. The Pliocene/Pleistocene. Both the Omo River Basin and the region of eastern Lake Rudolf have provided a wealth of new information about both hominid fossils and this zone of time, the effects of which are at least twofold: an extension of the Pleistocene backward to about 2-3 M.Y. and an uncovering of late Pliocene fossil hominids, extending to 5 M.Y. Butzer and Thurber (1969) have given a full description of the Omo Basin sediments complete with K/Ar dates. A later publica- tion by Butzer (1970) provides a more detailed analysis of the deltaic nature of the deposits. Maglio (1970) has made a study of the Elephan- tidae of Africa throughout Plio-Pleistocene deposits, suggesting a rough 4 M.Y. correlation between Laetolil, yellow sands at Omo, Kanapoi, Chemeron, the Vaal River in South Africa, and Kanam, Kaiso, and Chiwondo. Ain Hainech is correlated with Bed I at Olduvai, and with Beds I and J at Omo. Patterson and Behrensmeyer (1970) briefly de- scribed the fauna from a new site, Lothagam Hill in northwest Kenya, extending the East African Pliocene to about 5.5 M.Y. and suggesting that Lothagam 3 coincides with the Kanapoi and Mursi formation (Omo). Bishop and Chapman (1970) report that mammal fossils and one hominid (?) tooth from the Ngorora formation in the Baringo dis- trict of west Kenya gave a preliminary date of 9-12 M.Y. This report included a quote from L. S. B. Leakey that the tooth, a crown of a left molar, probably M2, is similar to "Kenyapithecus" (Ramapithecus). Thus a possible bridge exists between the Fort Ternan fauna of 14 M.Y. and those of Lake Rudolf and Omo. Howell (1969) has provided a well-illustrated description of his 1967-68 expedition, which has extended the australopithecines to 3-4 M.Y. The discoveries come from at least 12 localities and represent some 40 isolated teeth, both deciduous and permanent, and two mandibular</page><page sequence="23">HUMAN BIOLOGY 107 fragments that are robust, like those derived from earlier French dis- coveries. The teeth suggest two australopithecine taxa, gracile and robust, with graciles mainly in the earlier range, although these extend throughout a long period of time. R. E. F. Leakey et al. (1969) reported on three cranial fragments from the 1967 expedition in the Omo region. These came from the Kibbish formation, and date ca. 35,000 years, possibly representing the late Middle Pleistocene. These are described by M. Day as quite rugged but definitely advanced Homo sapiens, with cranial capacities on the order of 1450 cc. (Omo II). A later report by R. E. F. Leakey et al. (1970) gives a preliminary description of five new hominid specimens, including two well-preserved crania, near the eastern shore of Lake Rudolf. Also they report on the oldest known in situ artifacts, chop- pers, flakes, and cobbles (51 specimens), dated at 2.61 M.Y. In addi- tion, there are many faunal remains, including Papio, Simopithecus, Colobus, Ceropithecus, and Galago. The most complete cranium is FS- 158, found in a horizon below the tuff yielding a 2.61 M.Y. date, which looks very similar to Swartkrans specimens and the Olduvai Hominid #5, and is thus called Australopithecus boisei. The second cranium, FS-210, was found one mile north of FS-158, and consists of fragments of the basioccipital and parietals. R. E. F. Leakey considers this either a gracile Australopithecus or early Homo (habilis ?), favoring the latter view. The other three finds are represented by two mandibular frag- ments and an extremely weathered maxilla. Discoveries at Olduvai Gorge continue to be made under Mary Leakey's supervision. The latest announcement (M. D. Leakey 1969) brought the count up to Hom. #27; the most important of these since October 1968 is a very crushed but complete cranium from lower Bed I at D.K. east, Hom. #24, which seems clearly to resemble current ideas of Homo habilis. New finds have since been made but have not yet been published in any form. Thus the last two years have seen a tremendous increase in fossil hominid specimens yet to be described, an extension back into time of the Pleistocene, and an uncovering of previously missing late Pliocene deposits. Pleistocene hominids. Oxnard (1968) has studied the FLKNN I Hom. #8 clavicular fragment, referred to Homo habilis, and finds it very simi- lar to modern man's, but its function may have been somewhat different in that some of its features (torsion) are similar to primates', which sus- pend their bodies by their arms. Oxnard believes that this fragment cor-</page><page sequence="24">108 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE relates well with information existing on the Sterkfontein scapula. (See also Oxnard 1969a,b, for a detailed multivariate analysis of the human shoulder, and the application of mathematical techniques to the study of primate anatomy.) In a similar vein, Day (1969) believes that the Hom. #20 femoral fragment from the HWK site in lower Bed II closely resembles the Swartkrans SK 82/97 femora, and is thus a robust form showing less efficient bipedal gait than the gracile form. Day and Wood (1968) have also examined the Olduvai Hom. #8 talus, from FLKNN I, comparing it with specimens from Kromdraai, Spy, Skuhl, and modern man and apes, by using the Mahalanobis D2 method and canonical analysis. Olduvai Hom. #8 and Kromdraai did not belong to striders or pronograde quadrupedal apes, but were never- theless from bipeds, with the Olduvai Hom. #8 showing an advance over that of the Kromdraai talus, since there seemed to be no evidence for strong divergence of the hallux. Lovejoy and Heiple (1970) have attempted to reconstruct the height and weight of the gracile form from the proximal and distal femoral fragments, and calculate a body size as small as 42-43 inches, with a weight of 40-50 pounds. If these figures are accurate and my own esti- mates of brain volumes correct (Holloway 1970c), the ratio of brain weight to body weight is ca. 1: 47, a value the same as our own. Von Helmuth (1968), using a composite method of adding cranial height, vertebra, femoral fragments, and heel bones made up of a combined sample of East and South African finds, arrives at an estimate similar to current Bushman, and argues that the limb proportions do not sup- port the belief that the australopithecines could not walk fully erect. Obviously, both methods are highly questionable in terms of their as- sumptions regarding additions and extrapolations to present-day re- gressions. New finds have also been made at Swartkrans, and are described by Brain (1970), including a new endocast, SK 1585, an infant mandible, two vertebrae, nine isolated teeth, and eight more fragments. Included in this report is an interesting suggestion of leopard predation on the robust variety of Australopithecus. (See also Brain 1969.) Robinson et al. (1970) describe the new vertebrae and provide a remarkable discov- ery that two previously unearthed cranial fragments, SK 847 and SK 846b, and the SK 80 maxilla fit together perfectly, and are assignable to the Homo erectus taxon. Tobias (1968, 1969b) has written eloquently about the taxonomy and phylogeny of the australopithecines, regarding the Old. Hom. #5 as a</page><page sequence="25">HUMAN BIOLOGY 109 species of Australopithecus, A. boisei. His suggestion (1969a) of bigen- eric nomina for evolutionary lines of hominids has not met with enthusi- astic approval, however. Wolpoff (1969a), skeptical of the Old. Hom. #7 as a habiline frag- ment, did his own statistical analysis on cranial capacity, concluding that it does not differ from the gracile africanus taxon. As Pilbeam (1969a) points out, his statistical methods leave something to be desired, since he lumps East and South African forms in his sample. Pilbeam finds considerable statistical significance using the t-test between means of 430 cc. and 657 cc. Holloway (1970a,c) reexamined the australo- pithecine endocasts, finding that previously published estimates were too high. Particularly striking is the finding that the original Taung endocast, often quoted as between 525 and 600 cc., is but 403 cc. in im- mature form, or 440 cc. in the adult. As is usual in paleoanthropology, the literature continues to be bur- dened with much debating about nomenclature of the hominids. A long exchange between Wolpoff (1968b) and Gutgesell (1970), with a reply from Wolpoff (1970), is available on the single species hypothesis, that only one species was living at a time in South Africa, and therefore there is no "Telanthropus," or evidence of a more advanced hominid at Swart- krans. The argument given by Wolpoff is that since there could not be two species competing in the same econiche, the difference between the specimens must really be nonexistent or within the range of variation of a single taxon. Thus the only model with which he is working shows evidence of violent struggle and fierce competition between the homi- nids, which seems frankly naive in light of our modern understanding of species distributions for primates. There is a shorter set of contro- versial letters regarding the taxonomy of the "habiline" materials by L. S. B. Leakey et al. (1968), Brace (1969), and Simons, Pilbeam, and Ettel (1969), in which Leakey is criticized for not answering the ques- tions posed by combining Bed I and Bed II specimens as a new taxon without thorough comparison with South African materials. Hopefully, the day may soon come when full morphological studies are published first. In India, Corvinus (1968) has shown that there are occupation floors after all, and briefly describes what she regards as an Acheulean occu- pation site at Chirki-on-Pravara. It is to be hoped that those long-awaited hominid bones will be discovered soon. Fejfar (1969) has described what may be an early Pleistocene site in Czechoslovakia. Primitive stone tools and a dubious molar fragment were found at Prezletice. The Ve6r-</page><page sequence="26">110 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE tesszollos occipital fragment has been further analyzed by Thoma (1968), using multivariate analysis. The results indicate a close position to Swanscombe and an estimated cranial capacity of more than 1,400 cc., an extremely high value if the age is indeed of the order of 500,000 years. The Chinese fossil discoveries have been described by Chang (1968), for which all Western anthropologists are grateful, including brief de- scriptions of spore and pollen analysis at Choukoutien, the 1963 man- dible from Lanitien, and the 1964 cranium with congenital absence of the third molar, and a morphology closely similar to that from Java sam- ples, thus being somewhat earlier than the materials from Choukoutien. J. R. Baker (1968) has found minor discrepancies in the older litera- ture and actual specimens of Rhodesian man. Briggs (1968) has a curi- ous essay, which suggests a wholly independent hominid evolutionary chain of the northwest African hominids. A more useful review has been provided by Jelinek (1969) of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens in Cen- tral and Eastern Europe, with C.A. treatment. He argues effectively that the finds from these areas show pronounced morphological as well as cultural variability, and thus considers the Neanderthal patterns as but racial variants of Homo sapiens. Vallois (1969) has published a two- part paper on the new H 27 temporal bone from La Quina, and Billy (1969) and Dastague (1969) have restudied the postcranial skeleton of Chancelade and its pathology, respectively. Oakley and Groves (1970) have written a short piece shedding further light on the Piltdown fraud, including the often unknown perspicacity of Gerrit S. Miller, who be- lieved it was a fraud from the beginning. Hominid evolution. Schaffer (1968) presented an interesting analysis of australopithecine dental traits, arguing that the differences are more pronounced among specimens from sympatric sites than those from lo- calities having only single hominids. Thus there is greater diversity be- tween H. habilis and A. boisei than between A. africanus and A. robus- tus. This suggests that sympatric populations were more divergent as a result of competition for food, or at least that the morphological differ- ences permitted coexistence, illustrating the principle of character dis- placement. A number of quite concrete predictions are made in that article regarding where H. habilis will be found. This paper is the first to offer cohesive predictions on the basis of an evolutionary principle rather than a bias. Bilsborough (1969) has quantified the rates of evolu- tionary change in the hominids' dentition to millidarwins, to assess prob- lems of mosaic evolution and ecological and selective forces. He sug- gests a number of different tempos between Beds I and II at Olduvai,</page><page sequence="27">HUMAN BIOLOGY 1ll the latter with Java, and between H. erectus and H. sapiens. Kinzey (1970) also has examined the rate of change of the canine teeth in hominids, and does not find support for the "orthodox" view long held that there has been a marked reduction in canine size, accompanied (indeed caused) by tool making and use. Roper (1969) provided a valuable review of all evidence associated with intrahuman slaughter during the Pleistocene, pointing to the diffi- culty of any simple interpretation, and the lack of evidence for any real warfare. The most interesting framework to appear during this period of review regarding the dynamics of hominid evolution and the separa- tion of hominids from other pongids is clearly that offered by Jolly (1970). In a refreshing new review of these problems, Jolly suggests that seed eating many have been a primary adaptation toward savanna conditions, which could explain a number of dental characteristics in early hominids (as well as Gigantopithecus, Geladas, and possibly Go- rilla), and certain preadaptations leading to increased fine use of the hand and even the tongue for language. This new hypothesis deserves careful attention. Meanwhile, Washburn (1968) and Lancaster (1968) have reaffirmed the traditional view of the importance of a hunting "way of life" to human evolution without ever confronting the complexities or specifics of what is involved in hunting. Holloway (1970b) has specu- lated on the effects of a hunting adaptation at various levels of the brain to indicate the complexity of such a molar term, and warns about facile explanations of mosaic evolution that do not coordinate brain reor- ganization with remaining morphological, behavioral, and ecological adaptation. Last, Tuttle (1969, 1970) has published the results of his painstaking dissections on the cheiridia of the great apes and their significance to questions of locomotion and hominid origins. In Tuttle's opinion, man probably did not pass through a knuckle-walking stage, but more likely evolved from an ancestor capable of suspensory posturing. Thus the divergence between hominids and apes probably preceded the use of knuckle-walking in the pongids. Serological and Biochemical Genetics The literature abounds in reports on allelic frequencies of red cell antigens, enzymes, and the various serum proteins. Some of these studies should be of special interest to the anthropologist, since they go beyond statistical analysis and probe for possible correlation between gene fre- quencies and demographic or historical-cultural variables. Noteworthy in this respect are the two reports by Johnson et al. (1968, 1969) on the</page><page sequence="28">112 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE blood groups of the Cashinahua in southeastern Peru. Although overall frequencies were characteristic of the known South American Indian pattern, a surprisingly great variation was observed between villages. The genetic picture remains unclear without a knowledge of Cashinahua social organization and history. The Cashinahua have the highest fertil- ity rate known; village endogamy is high, but the village membership is shifting from year to year. Polygyny adds a "founder effect" to other aspects of genetic drift. Jenkins et al. (1968) typed Kalahari Bushmen and Bushman-Bantu hybrids for several traits. Not one of the 277 Bushmen had any abnor- mal hemoglobin and only a few had G6PD deficiency. The authors in- terpret the data, especially the complete absence of the sickle-cell trait, as an indication that the Bushman ancestors arrived in the Kalahari before the trait became established among their northern neighbors. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the nomadic Bushmen are not subject to the same degree of disease as the agriculturalist Bantu. Salzano et al. (1968) found a different incidence of "Negro genes" and "white genes" in the older and younger age groups of Porto Alegre in Brazil. The distribution is influenced by demographic factors such as the incidence of the two racial groups in the area of contact, by differ- ence in fertility between hybrids and nonhybrids, and by assortative mating for skin color. In a study on the Seminole Indians of Florida (Pollitzer et al. 1970b), where similar differences between gene fre- quencies in the older and younger generation have been found, these are being interpreted as chance effects and as an illustration of genetic drift in operation. The authors present a "racial parental analysis" on the basis of eight serological traits, and compute biological distance from seven morphological traits by the D2 method of Mahalanobis between the Seminole, the Sioux, Negroes, and whites, but fail to mention the possibility of differential rates of gene migration. Gene flow was estimated from the ABH secretor dimorphism in Bra- zilian schoolchildren (Palatnik et al. 1969). The subjects were grouped into four racial categories on the basis of subjective judgments about skin color, lip form and size, hair form, etc. The three Negroid groups had a nonsecretor frequency of 14.2 percent and the whites of 18.6 per- cent. Overall white admixture was estimated at 44 percent and gene flow per generation at 5 percent. In Arizona the Pima and Papago have been tested for red cell traits and serum proteins (Matson et al. 1968). A total of 1,304 samples were taken: 234 persons were known hybrids, and the only two group B in- dividuals were found among them. The frequency of A2 was one in 909</page><page sequence="29">HUMAN BIOLOGY 113 Pima, one in 80 Pima-Papago hybrids, and one in 33 Pima-Caucasian hybrids. The presence of A2 and B is obviously due to non-Indian ad- mixture. The authors augment Boyd's 1949 serological scheme of three Indian layers with a fourth: the ancestors of the Blackfoot and related tribes who may have brought the A1 gene in high frequencies into North America. Schemes aimed at reconstructing ancestral frequencies all suffer from circular reasoning. Ancestral frequencies are retrojected on the basis of present findings, which in turn are being interpreted in the light of presumed ancestral frequencies. Gene flow was also estimated for Anglo- Indians (Bhattacharya 1969) from red cell traits and from genealogies giving complete information on three generations. Caucasian (British) ancestral contribution to the genetic makeup of the 534 Anglo-Indians covered in the study was estimated at 39.5 percent. Also from India comes a partial adjustment of the B cline. Frequencies are not as uni- formly high as is shown in Mourant; rather, there is a narrow belt of high A and low B stretching from Asiatic Soviet Russia through Nepal to eastern India. North and south of this belt the frequencies are re- versed (Tiwari and Bhasin 1968). Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1969) published a pilot study on Babinga pyg- mies, a group never before tested for blood group or serum polymor- phisms. The Babinga ABO frequencies, judging from a total sample of 183 (the total population living in dispersed groups may reach as high as 30,000), were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. High frequencies of R0 and Fy make the Babinga, in the opinion of the authors, the most African group among Africans! The Babinga also contributed a new vari- ant to the red cell enzyme phosphoglucomutase. The new allele PGM2 has a 7 percent incidence and was found both in the homozygous and the heterozygous state (Santachiara Benerecetti and Modiano 1969). Hemoglobin Babinga is yet another addition to the rapidly growing list of abnormal hemoglobins. This variant is remarkable because it involves the 8 chain: 136 glycine &gt; aspartic acid. Previously only 3 i chain vari- ants were known in contrast to the more than 60 i chain variants and more than 30 a chain variants (De Jong and Bernini 1968). The search continues for selective factors responsible for maintaining red cell polymorphisms. The results are still somewhat ambiguous and at times outright contradictory. Isolated incidents may indicate a devel- oping trend away from E. B. Ford's restrictive theory. ABO frequencies were found not to be correlated with fertility, or, rather, sterility does not seem to be a selective factor of any importance in the maintenance of this polymorphic system (Solish and Gerschowitz 1969). On the other</page><page sequence="30">114 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE hand, ABO hemolytic disease may have a greater selective importance than hitherto suspected. In Milwaukee between 1954 and 1967 one in every 1,654 births was characterized by severe ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (Sever 1969). Feldman et al. (1969) offer a general model to account for the per- sistence of Rh polymorphism. Maintenance is by reproductive over- compensation of Rh-negative women in matings with Rh-positive het- erozygous men. Livingstone (1969a) collected evidence from the literature and added the results of his own research on the Brandywyne Isolate of Maryland to demonstrate that deleterious genes reaching the 2 percent limit set by E. B. Ford are not necessarily maintained by bilateral selective forces. The seven populations included in the study all show the results of the "founder effect": harmful genes introduced into the originally small populations by a few individuals have been maintained at fre- quencies higher than the mutation rate through subsequent rapid ex- pansion. In a theoretical discussion on genetic load, Brues (1969) examines the various aspects of this somewhat elusive concept. She concludes that loads can be both good and bad: Mullerian load, the mutational load, is only detrimental; segregational load is fatal to some but is favorable for the population as a whole; substitutional load is definitely favorable for the population. The confusion about the three arises from the fact that the same mathematical calculations that are applied to them do not take account of overall population success. Statistical note: As of January 1970 the number of known Mendelian traits in man reached 1,721 (McKusick 1970): 883 autosomal dominants, 702 autosomal recessives, and 136 X-linked. In another system excess of MN heterozygotes was found to be due to an excess of homospecific deliveries among MN mothers. Observed distribution among their offspring differs significantly from the expected (Berberovic 1969). A few years back W. J. Dewey et al. (1965) found preliminary evi- dence that the Xg incompatibility influences the secondary sex ratio. Xga mothers seem to be immunologically hostile to their female fetuses if the father is Xga-positive. Sensitization occurs only after the first het- erospecific pregnancy, and the sex ratio continues to rise with parity. Data from the Amish in Indiana were combined with the original data of Dewey, and it was found that the original 234: 160 sex ratio changed to 148: 82 after the birth of the first daughter (W. J. Jackson et al. 1969). A form of disease selection, by itself not very significant, seems to be</page><page sequence="31">HUMAN BIOLOGY 115 operating against group 0 persons. Matsuzawa et al. (1970) found group H antigens in both the A2 and B strains of influenza viruses. This might account for the relatively high incidence of group 0 individuals in cer- tain types of influenza, since these people obviously are unable to manu- facture anti-H antibodies. If a relatively higher percentage of group O persons succumb to complications following influenza attacks and if these people are not past the age of reproduction, we might have a selective mechanism working here. Gametic selection is suggested by Ackerman (1968) as a selective factor in the ABO polymorphism. The fertilizing capacity of sperma- tozoa from A and B secretors may be inhibited by ABO isoantibodies and may result in bias in the transmission of both A and B alleles. The hypothesis is based on one in vitro experiment, but it is to be hoped that further research will be done. Blumberg et al. (1969) sum up current knowledge about the ambigu- ous Australia antigen. The controlling gene is an autosomal recessive termed Au'. The antigen is common in many tropical areas, where it ranges from 6 to 25 percent. The frequency in Japan is 1 percent and in the United States only 0.1 percent. The antigen may be a mark of inherited susceptibility in humans to chronic infection with a virus hepatitis or it may be a virus itself. Australia antigen is also found in patients with Down's syndrome and in three forms of leukemia, all which are associated with anicteric hepatitis. In addition to hemoglobin Babinga, mentioned earlier (p. 113), some of the new hemoglobin variants are the following: Hb-F (Malta), a fetal hemoglobin variant with relatively high inci- dence in Maltese infants (about 1.5 percent), y 117 His -&gt; Arg. (Cauchi et al. 1969). Hb-G Audhali from southern Arabia, a23 Glu -- Val. (Marengo-Rowe 1968). Hb Boras from a Swedish family, ( 88 Leu - &gt; Arg. This is an unstable hemoglobin causing hemolytic disease (Hollender et al. 1969). Hb-G Hsin-chu from Taiwan, found in a northern Chinese. An identi- cal anomaly, 3 22 Glu -- Ala., was found in two American Indian groups (Blackwell et al. 1968). Hb-J Meinung and Hb-J Korat from Taiwan and Thailand are identi- cal with Hb-J Manado from Indonesia, ( 56 Gly -&gt; Asp. (Blackwell et al. 1970). Hb Chad, a 23 Glu -- Lys. (Boyer et al. 1968). Hb Singapore and Hb Khartoum both involved proline substitution but seem to be stable in vivo (J. B. Clegg 1969).</page><page sequence="32">116 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE Red cell enzymes. Gd Minas Gerais has been added to the more than 50 known variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Azevedo and Yoshida 1969). Gordon et al. (1969) found a rare phenotype for 6-phos- phogluconate dehydrogenase in a group of South African Ngunis. The phenotype 6-PGD B was found in six of 200 male and female subjects. It is marked by some quantitative differences in enzymatic activity. Blake and Kirk (1969) found a new variant of the same enzyme in Aus- tralia. The new phenotype, 6-PGD Elcho, designated "Elcho" after its place of discovery, exists both in the homozygous and in the hetero- zygous condition. The frequency of the Elcho allele is 1.7 percent on Elcho Island and 1.4 percent in the rest of Arnhem Land. Variants in this system have been known only since 1963. A new human red cell enzyme, adenosine deaminase, also forms a polymorphic system (Spen- cer et al. 1968). Two common alleles, ADA1 and ADA2, control three phenotypes: ADA 1, ADA 2-1, and ADA 2. The alleles have an auto- somal locus. In 1969 (Hopkinson, et al. 1969) a new phenotype, ADA 3-1, was found. The new type is controlled by the rare allele ADA3 and is characterized by reduced enzymatic activity. W. H. P. Lewis and Harris (1969) report on variants of peptidase D, one of the five peptidases known in man. Variants of peptidase A and B had been discovered in previous population surveys. White blood cell antigen research is concentrated on the HL-A system, the second major histocompatibility locus in man. The great importance of this system in organ transplantation is well known, but the genetic control and different frequency distributions of these antigens are also of anthropological interest. There are at least 40 HL-A alleles, each of which can produce two antigens, one for each of the two subloci at the main locus. Contrary to the ABO system, the HL-A factors are expressed in brain tissue but not on erythrocytes (Fotino 1970). HL-A specificities are inherited as linked traits or haplotypes. Not all possible combina- tions can form haplotypes; there are also mutually exclusive specificities. Close linkage between determinants belonging to different series, which are never carried on the same chromosome, is confirmed by recombina- tion studies. Recombination frequency in the HL-A region was found to be less than 1 percent in two studies (Ceppellini 1969). I have restricted discussion to the HL-A system although several others are known. The nomenclature is bewildering and the systems are full of duplications and ambiguities. Serum proteins occupy an important part of biochemical research on human polymorphisms.</page><page sequence="33">HUMAN BIOLOGY 117 Haptoglobins. The a locus of haptoglobin was located on chromosome 16 with a probability of 97 percent (Robson et al. 1969). Evidence of an excess of heterozygous children from Hp2-2x Hp2-1 matings comes from Scandinavia, confirming an earlier finding from En- gland. In Germany and Brazil, on the other hand, such matings resulted in an excess of Hp2-2 children (Heiken et al. 1969). In response to ty- phoid vaccination, Hp2-2 individuals had higher anti-O titers than per- sons of type Hpl-l or Hpl-2. The Hp2 allele may have a selective advantage by superior ability to form certain antibodies (Nevo and Sut- ton 1968). A significant positive correlation was found between the phenotype Hpl-l and leukemia (Wendt et al. 1968). Ceruloplasmin. This a globulin contains over 90 percent of plasma copper. Five alleles are known for this system. All human populations have high CpB and low Cpc frequencies. Caucasoids and Mongoloids are characterized, in addition, by low CpA. The fourth allele, CpNH, was found only in U.S. whites. The fifth allele, CpTh, seems to be limited to Thailand (Bajatzadeh and Walter 1969). Xh antigen. This serum antigen is part of a protein that moves elec- trophoretically with serum alpha globulins. It is found more often in the serum of women than in that of men and may be sex-limited (Kuep- pers 1969). Transferrins. A new variant was reported by Barnett and Bowman (1968) designated BLambert. C'3. Two conflicting genetic mechanisms are proposed for this poly- morphic ( globulin. One hypothesis (Propp and Alper 1968) postulates two codominant alleles, F (fast) and S (slow). The other hypothesis (Azen and Smithies 1968) considers four codominant alleles at an auto- somal locus controlling the six phenotypes observed in a study of 113 randomly chosen Caucasians. Immunoglobulins. The Ig lambda chain is synthesized by two genes: a specificity-region gene and a common-region gene. It seems that anti- body light chains in general require two separate genes for one poly- peptide chain (Hood and Ein 1968). A new genetic polymorphism, the Stolzfus blood group, which belongs to the Ig A class of immunoglobu- lins, was found among the old order Amish in Pennsylvania. The anti- gen Sfa, present in about 40 percent of the U.S. population, is inherited as a Mendelian autosomal trait (Bias et al. 1969). A new Ig A2 marker, called Am2, is related to the Gm gene complexes. Its frequency varies widely in different populations (Kunkel et al. 1969). In Japanese fami- lies Am and Gm showed close linkage; no recombinants were observed.</page><page sequence="34">118 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE The Inv(1) factor was inherited independently of Gm and Am mark- ers (Van Loghem et al. 1970). Albumin: North American and Meso-American Indians show a wide distribution of serum albumin polymorphisms. Variant forms are Algon- kian, Naskapi (which may be identical), "Faster," and Mexico (Polesky et al. 1968). Two new variants are albumin Syracuse (Schneiderman et al. 1968) and albumin Gainesville (Lau et al. 1969). Group-specific component: New evidence for close linkage between the albumin and the Gc loci is given by Weitkamp et al. (1968) and confirmed by Weitkamp et al. (1970) from a computer analysis of link- age distance in 21 families. After standard typhoid vaccination, Gc2-1 individuals had higher anti-O titers than either homozygote. Gc2-1 may be a case of balanced polymorphism through disease selection (Nevo and Sutton 1968). In a pilot study a statistically significant excess of the Gc' gene was found among women with rheumatic heart disease (Murray and Robinson 1968). A new variant of the enzyme lactate de- hydrogenase was found in the Lagaip subdistrict of western highland New Guinea. It seems to be identical with the Memphis-4 variant (Blake et al. 1969). Myoglobin was known by only two variants until 1968. A third variant was found by Boulton et al. (1969). This is the first in which the amino acid substitution is identified as 53 Glu -&gt; Lys. The incidence is one in 500. Molecular Genetics Some startling discoveries were made in this field during the past two years, and mammalian genetics may easily take a completely new turn as a result. Karol and Simpson (1968) found evidence for fairly long pieces of DNA in rat liver mitochondria. In studies during the follow- ing year the mitochondrial DNA of man, birds, and amphibians was revealed as a double-stranded circle with a perimeter of 4.7 to 5.5 mi- crons. A rarer type is twice or several times this size. The mitochrondria were found to contain components required for the functioning of a second genetic system. The DNA can be synthesized and replicated within the organelle. The mitochondrion is also capable of synthesizing RNA (Nass 1969). The amount of DNA present in mitochondria is small in comparison with that present in the nucleus. Nevertheless, about 20 proteins are synthesized there (McKusick 1970). As if this were not enough, DNA has also been isolated from micro- somes in mouse liver under conditions that effectively prevented con-</page><page sequence="35">HUMAN BIOLOGY 119 tamination from mitochondria and nuclei. It is evident also from the behavior of this DNA that it is neither of nuclear nor of mitochondrial provenience. Microsomal DNA may contain a considerable amount of genetic information (Bond et al. 1969). Also in 1969 a class of cytoplas- mic DNA packaged into discrete particles, the I-somes, was announced by Bell. This type of DNA, found in embryonic muscle cells, can also be recovered from ribosomes (E. Bell 1969). In Bell's hypothesis, nu- cleated embryonic cells initiate protein synthesis by a different mecha- nism than do bacterial and viral cells. In the former, I-DNA molecules may act as a template for messenger RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm. A few iconoclasts always doubted that mRNA is made in the nucleus of nucleated cells, but I-somes and I-DNA have remained hidden from researchers for so long because their existence has no place in current dogma, according to Bell. The findings of extra-nuclear DNA in higher vertebrates bring up the question of the maternal effect in inheritance, just to mention one of the many unsolved problems facing those who study the genetics of higher organisms on the molecular level (Hersh 1969). In experiments with ovariectomized rats it was found that estrogen controlled the rate of genetic transcription and translation in the uterus. In cytoplasmic genetic translation in the uterus, estrogen controls the number and the activity of polyribosomes in an inverse relation. From between two and 24 hours after hormone treatment the uterus increases its capacity for protein synthesis by 300 percent. This happens by a de- crease in polyribosomal activity but by an increase in the amount of polyribosomes formed during the time of estrogen action (Hamilton 1968). Nance (1969) sees a distinct possibility for cytoplasmic inheritance in anencephaly, spina bifida, and other highly correlated midline neurol- ogical defects. In all these abnormalities there is also a definite recur- rence risk and evidence for maternal transmission. Nance's hypothesis is based on logical proof, not on biochemical evidence, but in the light of the recent discoveries in molecular genetics he may yet be proved right. Cytogenetics An important event during the past two years has been the identi- fication of a "male chromatin body" in human tissue cultures when inter- phase nuclei have been stained with either quinachrine mustard (QM) or quinachrine dihydrochloride (QD) (Pearson et al. 1970). QM is</page><page sequence="36">120 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE known to bind specifically to heterochromatin areas in plant chromo- somes; in human male nuclei it binds characteristically to the distal por- tion of the long arm of the Y chromosome, whereas in female nuclei it does not bind specifically to any area in either of the two X chromosomes. The indication is for physicochemical differences between the X and the Y chromosome (George 1970). Human spermatozoa stained with QD or QM show a dense fluorescent mass invariably in the basal third part of the head. Nearly half of the sperm stained with QM contained a fluorescent body glowing even brighter than the surrounding fluorescent mass. The fluorescent body is assumed to be the chromatin in the distal segment of the long arm of the Y chromosome (Barlow and Vosa 1970). The new staining tech- nique helped to clarify and definitely settle the question of which arm of the Y chromosome is associated with the X chromosome during meio- sis in the human male. In cells treated with QD, the highly fluorescent region was, without exception, 'situated at the distal end of the sex bivalent. From this it follows that the short arm of the Y chromosome associates with the X (Pearson and Bobrow 1970). Cell fusion or cell hybridization is another important development in cytogenetics. This is a technique by which two or more cells from the same or from different species are joined. The process resembles fertilization, with the exception that hybrid cells will have not the hap- loid but the diploid complement of parental cell chromosomes. Human-mouse hybrid cells have the peculiarity of rapidly shedding the human chromosomes. This makes them ideal for locating genes ac- cording to the presence or absence of the gene product. Thus the gene for thymidine kinase was located on a group E chromosome, No. 17 or No. 18 (Migeon and Miller 1968). Another human-mouse cell line con- taining the human X chromosome, or at least a part of it, served to con- firm the X linkage of 8-azaguanine resistance in man (Nabholz et al. 1969). Matsuya and Green (1969) succeeded in retaining a much greater amount of human genetic material in hybrid clones than was thought possible. Unexpectedly, however, the hybrid cells contained more than a full complement of mouse chromosomes. Thus the ratio of human to mouse chromosomes remained about 1: 4. Silagi et al. (1969) were successful in obtaining a hybrid clone from two human cell strains with the A+ and B types of G-6-PD deficiency. Both types of deficiency are determined by allelic sex-linked genes. This is the first known example</page><page sequence="37">HUMAN BIOLOGY 121 of a mammalian hybrid line in which two X-linked allelic genes are functioning. Chromosomal Studies The locus of the Duffy blood group has been assigned to chromosome No. 1 with a 90 percent probability. There is evidence for linkage be- tween the Duffy locus and a locus called Un, which may control the un- coiling of the paracentric region of the long arm of chromosome No. 1. The congenital cataract locus Cae is also believed to be closely linked to the Duffy locus (Donahue et al. 1968). German et al. (1968) identi- fied the MN blood group locus as being on the long arm of either chromosome No. 2 or No. 4. Weitkamp (1969) believes that the most probable locus for this blood group is the distal segment of the long arm of chromosome No. 4. Analysis of a series of family pedigrees in Israel has resulted in find- ing the locus for the X-linked form of ichthyosis: it is near the locus for the Xg blood groups but far from the locus for deutan or protan color blindness or that for G-6-PD deficiency (Adam 1969). Linkage studies on data from a large Dutch kindred have confirmed the Israeli findings (Went et al. 1969). Abnormal chromosomes. In a study on 20 individuals with Down's syndrome, due to 13-15/21 centric fusion, chromosome No. 14 was in- volved in 18 cases and chromosome No. 15 in two cases. The results taken in conjunction with findings from 13 previously studied cases give strong indication that the involvement of group D chromosomes in trans- locations is nonrandom (Hecht et al. 1968). Bloom and Gerald (1968) analyzed the families of two patients with D1 trisomy. The syndrome includes severe mental retardation and multi- ple congenital malformations such as polydactyly, cleft lip and cleft palate, ocular abnormalities, and congenital heart disease. One of the patients was trisomic for several regions of chromosome No. 13; the other had a translocation between chromosomes No. 1 and No. 13. The latter has a phenotypically normal father with the same chromosomal anomaly. Translocation trisomies do not seem to be correlated with in- creased maternal age. Trisomic human cells seem to be more resistant to adenovirus infection than are normal cells (McDougall 1970). Dermatoglyphics are sensitive indices of chromosomal anomalies. Both autosome and sex chromosome mosaics show dermatoglyphic asymmetry. The differences between hands show the greatest variabil-</page><page sequence="38">122 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE ity, which may be the result of an uneven distribution of the two types of cell lines (Polani and Polani 1969). In general, the causes of chromosomal disorders are obscure. In- creased maternal age is a significant factor in sex chromosome aneu- ploidy and in those cases of Down's syndrome that are due to mei- otic nondisjunction (Court Brown et al. 1969). Nielsen and Friedrich (1970) found a seasonal variation in the risk of nondisjunction of sex chromosomes by studying the birth records of 53 patients with 47,XXY Klinefelter's syndrome. A significantly higher percentage of patients were born in March-April and October, which makes the risk of non- disjunction highest in January and June-July. Burch thinks (1969) that meiotic nondisjunction in the X chromosome may be a genetically based autoaggressive disorder similar to diabetes mellitus, whereas the auto- somal nondisjunction in Down's syndrome is associated with thyroid dis- ease through pleiotropic genes. Chromosome disjunction may occur more frequently in women genetically predisposed to autoimmune disease. Abnormal chromosomes and human behavior. Certain aspects of the etiology of Down's syndrome have been the subject of much argument in the past few years. Most researchers tried to improve upon the Ger- man hypothesis that sees the association of nondisjunction and increased maternal age as being due to reduced coital frequency. Welch (1968) tries to correlate culturally determined behavior with the incidence of Down's syndrome. He compared 214 cases where the patient's mother was Roman Catholic with an equal number of carefully selected controls and found a trend toward greater incidence among the former. He be- lieves the "safe period" method of contraception is clearly implicated because avoidance of intercourse around and during the time of ovula- tion could be specifically associated with late fertilization of already deteriorating ova. James (1968) offers another auxiliary hypothesis. The fertilizing life span of ova and sperm vary with age; the fertile life span of ova in deteriorating condition increases with maternal age. Polani (1969) cites pooled statistics from five countries of sex chromo- some abnormalities: one in every 465 males is chromatin-positive; one in every 1,253 females is 47,XXX; and one in every 2,574 females is 45,X. Supernumerary X chromosomes seem to be associated with mental retardation: the proportion of 47,XXY males with Klinefelter's syndrome in mental hospitals was four times the proportion of 47,XXY males at birth; male mosaics of the 46,XY/47,XXY type may be five to six times more frequent in hospitals for the mentally retarded than among new- born males; one in 245 females of the 47,XXX type is in hospitals for</page><page sequence="39">HUMAN BIOLOGY 123 the mentally subnormal (this is five times the incidence at birth); 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY males are all suffering from severe mental re- tardation; only one 48,XXXX female was found among 10,000 in hospi- tals for the mentally retarded. On the other hand, Berg et al. (1969) examined 109 female patients in Broadmoor Hospital for chromosome abnormalities and failed to find even one who had either a single or more than two X chromosomes. How the female sex chromosome affects brain function and by what mediating pathways this is accomplished is not known. It only seems certain that, in addition to qualitative effects, there are also quantita- tive effects of sex chromosome imbalance. It is estimated that each X chromosome depresses the dermatoglyphic "total ridge count" by about 30 ridges, whereas the Y chromosome has only one-third this effect. No one knows why. The dermal ridges are under the control of autosomal genes with additive effects, and no evidence of X linkage has ever been found (Polani 1969). The alleged association between tall 47,XYY men and criminal be- havior was not borne out in recent studies. Knox and Nevin (1969) pooled data from England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A total of 737 prisoners were tested for their sex chromosome constitution; 67 of these men were over 177.5 cm. tall and 164 were at least 183 cm. tall. Seven were found to be of the 47,XYY sex chromosome constitution. Other studies seem to indicate that the frequency of 47,XYY males may be higher among sexual deviants than among criminals. Melnyk (1969) screened 200 tall "antisocial" men in a California state hospital for sex offenders and the mentally ill. Overall incidence of chromosomal abnor- malities was 8 percent. There were more 47,XYY males in the sex offender group (8.9 percent) than among the criminally insane (1.6 percent). In the control population of 401 normal and tall males from the same area, not one 47,XYY subject was detected. In another study four maximum security hospitals in Wisconsin have been combed for tall, possibly 47,XYY males (Daly 1969). The aim was neurological eval- uation. Twelve 47,XYY males were found among a total of 242 men. All except one showed abnormal neurological symptoms such as body asymmetries and brain (motor) dysfunctions. The Genetics of Schizophrenia The controversy about environment vs. genetic background in the etiology of schizophrenia was certainly not resolved during the past two years. In an impressive contribution marked by thorough familiarity</page><page sequence="40">124 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE with the subject and clarity of reasoning, Heston (1970) reviews the lit- erature on schizophrenia from the early days of the century until the present. He feels that recent studies on adopted and foster children have swung the balance toward the genetic control theory not only of schizo- phrenia but also of an array of related disorders. These studies show a significantly greater incidence of psychopathology among the bio- logical relatives of schizophrenics than among adopted relatives. The probability that an MZ twin of a schizophrenic will also be schizo- phrenic is 46 percent, whereas the remaining 54 percent show various degrees of abnormality. The basic inherited trait is "schizoidia," repre- senting a spectrum of schizoid and schizophrenic disorders as alternate expressions of a single genotype. The genetic background of schizoidia accordingly would consist of an autosomal dominant gene with large effect whose phenotypic expression is under the control of polygenic modifiers. Taylor (1969) finds that the time of onset of schizophrenia has some bearing on the sex ratio. Fifty-four pregnancies with prepartum and postpartum schizophrenia resulted in 49 full-term births of 20 male and 29 female offspring. The thirteen women who became psychotic within one month after conception gave birth to females only. The thirteen who became schizophrenic within two months after parturition delivered two females and eleven males. Taylor explains this difference by consider- ing the onset of schizophrenia in the mother to be the initiating event. Early in pregnancy the male fetus succumbs; later it may defend itself by producing high testosterone levels, which suppress psychosis in the mother. Delivery of a male full-term fetus affects the schizophrenic mother in exactly the same way as if a neuroleptic drug had been with- drawn. Gottesman (1968) finds that the evidence against environmental causes is not decisive. He offers a polygenic model that may control schizophrenia as a threshold character with a wide range of pheno- typic expressions. Erlenmeyer-Kimling (1968) finds support for the genetic theory advanced by Huxley and associates in the increased chances for survival enjoyed by both male and female offspring of schizophrenic mothers during the first year of life. The female offspring have an additional better chance than the general population to survive until the age of reproduction. Larson and Nyman (1970) reject the autosomal recessive theory in the inheritance of schizophrenia. Studying the range of onset in 153 schizophrenic males, they found that it went from the age of 9 to 77.</page><page sequence="41">HUMAN BIOLOGY 125 Autosomal recessive inheritance would be characterized by a narrow age interval of manifestation. Hinshelwood (1968) found overrepre- sentation of the penultimate sib among schizophrenics. Barry and Barry (1969) criticize Hinshelwood's ethnocentricism and point out the strong influence of cultural factors on the birth order effect. In India, for in- stance, the first half of large families is overrepresented among schizo- phrenics, whereas in England and the United States it is the later born. Behavior Genetics A review article by Gottesman in the second volume of Evolutionary Biology (1968) sums up problems of theory, method, and classification in the still young field of human behavioral genetics. Some of the diffi- culties lie in pinpointing and identifying basic units of behavior, meas- uring these units, and evaluating the quantitative results, which are usu- ally given in the form of test scores. A great problem area lies around the physiological mediating pathways between genes and behavioral traits. Possible causal relationships with genetic, chromosomal, internal, and external environmental sources need to be explored. Twin studies have come under some criticism because of the basic as- sumption that all differences between monozygotic twins must be en- vironmental. This seems an oversimplification. Intrauterine differences may be more marked for monozygotic twins than for fraternal twins, for instance (Vandenberg 1968). Such twins may also differ in their cyto- plasmic endowment. A volume edited by D. C. Glass (1968) and published by Rockefeller University Press under the somewhat misleading title of Genetics con- tains fourteen papers delivered at a conference on genetics and behavior at Rockefeller University during November 1966. The participants were of two cultures: specialists in the biological sciences and social scien- tists. The latter were in charge of evaluating the impact of recent devel- opments in genetics research in human intelligence and social behavior. Some of the contributions are excellent, for instance Vandenberg and Rosenthal on intelligence and personality, with Vandenberg attempt- ing to define the elusive and complex entity of human intelligence. Thompson reveals a certain bias toward the animal-human instinctual- social theorizing of Lorenz. Spuhler's contribution is all too brief but highly interesting, especially in what he reveals about the puzzling dis- crepancy between the heritability of the factor submissiveness vs. domi- nance in boy and girl twin pairs. Heritability is zero in females and 74 percent in males. This may well be the outcome of the imposition of a</page><page sequence="42">126 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE suppressive environment on girls. The highlight of the volume is an essay by Marvin Bressler, "Sociology, Biology, and Ideology," which should be required reading for all anthropologists. The collection would make a professionally competent but not too technical introductory text on the subject of behavior genetics on the graduate level. Non-Darwinian Evolution This new theory, currently very much in vogue, developed following the spectacular successes of molecular genetics in the past two decades. In essence it sees organic evolution as wholly or mostly indeterministic by eliminating the role of natural selection. Change in life forms through geological time is attributed to random events occurring at the molecu- lar level that become fixed at the population level through random processes. Kimura and Ohta (1968) calculated an average rate of approximately one substitution in 28 x 106 years in polypeptide chains of mammalian hemoglobin, cytochrome c, or triosephosphate dehydrogenase if the chains consist of 100 amino acids. Since each amino acid is encoded by a nucleotide triplet, a chain of 100 amino acids corresponds to 300 nucleotide pairs per genome. Roughly 20 percent of nucleotide replace- ment by mutation is "synonymous"; that is, the new mutant encodes for the same amino acid. One amino acid replacement may, therefore, cor- respond to about 1.2 base pair replacements. On the average, one nucleo- tide pair substitution has occurred roughly every two years in the course of mammalian evolution. This high rate is acceptable, considering the limitation imposed by the genetic load, if most mutations occurring by way of nucleotide replacement are considered neutral from the view- point of natural selection. In subsequent publications Kimura and Ohta (1969a,b) and Ohta and Kimura (1970) elaborate on the population genetical consequences of selectively neutral base substitutions. Arnheim and Taylor (1969) find Kimura's rates of amino acid sub- stitution consistent with a neutral allele-random fixation model. They use the human hemoglobin molecule, which has been extensively stud- ied, for illustration. Among 84 mutants examined, 48 do not seem to impair the function or affect the stability of the hemoglobin molecule. These 48 presumably neutral mutations are unequally distributed: 22 on the a chain and 26 on the ( chain. The authors suggest a correla- tion between the evolutionary rate of a protein and the number of different neutral alleles of that protein within a population. The actual number of neutral alleles at the a and ( chain loci agree with the</page><page sequence="43">HUMAN BIOLOGY 127 number estimated on t-he basis of evolutionary rates for the two chains: the 3 chain evolved 7 percent faster than the a chain. King and Jukes (1969) discuss the theoretical foundation, method- ology, and findings of non-Darwinian evolution. Anthropologists unfa- miliar with Kimura's work would greatly profit by reading this paper as an introduction to the subject. Random genetic drift or the "branching process" is supposed to fix selectively neutral alleles in a species, and this happens, according to King and Jukes, independent of population size. The most valuable part of the article is the presentation and dis- cussion of research results from a wide variety of sources. Thus, the theoretical number of human hemoglobin A variants in the world's pop- ulation is 5 million, and the total number of possible amino acid re- placements is approximately 2,217. Following calculations based on .0007 percent of the world's population already tested for hemoglobin types, it seems that all theoretically possible variants may actually exist. Kimura's rate of approximately one amino acid substitution every two years is, according to King and Jukes, a conservative underestimate. Their own figure is five times higher. On this basis mammalian evolu- tion is proceeding at the rate of approximately two allele substitutions per year. In Homo sapiens, because of his long life span, this comes to almost 60 amino acid substitutions per generation. After making cor- rections for error, the rate becomes one amino acid substitution per species in 50 years. This is still too high unless one assumes that most substitutions are selectively neutral. This aspect of the new theory is disturbing. Selective neutrality and random fixation are invoked not because of a deep philosophical com- mitment of the theorists to the indeterministic nature of all of life but purely as an instrumentalist solution to a problem that has arisen in the course of mechanical manipulation with numbers. It seems that Darwin will be dethroned not by someone with a superior mind and a better theory but by biological bureaucrats. The most articulate critic of non-Darwinian evolution is Richmond (1970), who analyzes some of the basic assumptions. Models of evolutionary change offered by Kimura and his followers are built on the assumption that natural selec- tion acts independently on each locus. The assumption is fallacious because selection acts on the entire organism and on populations of organisms rather than on single loci. The evidence used by adherents of non-Darwinian evolution to explain apparently neutral changes in DNA can be interpreted to greater satisfaction within the framework of the synthetic theory of evolution.</page><page sequence="44">128 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE The apparent linearity of amino acid substitutions in certain proteins of vertebrates with respect to time gave rise to the concept of neutral mutations. The molecular taxonomies elaborated on this basis depend for their validity on estimates from paleontological evidence for the times of divergence. The paleontological data themselves are subject to gross errors. Some amino acid sites in a number of proteins apparently remained unchanged through evolution. Rare variants appearing at these "invari- ant" sites result in drastic changes of molecular structure and protein function, resulting in serious pathologies. These must be subject to severe selection pressures. The distribution of the frequencies of amino acid occurrence is not linear; they fall into three classes on the basis of their observed fre- quencies. The existence of gene frequency clines provides indirect evi- Adence of the effect of natural selection on particular loci. Lanks and Kitchin (1970) find that most single-step mutations in ho- mologous proteins are conservative: the interchanges are between amino acids of similar physical properties. Between .6 and 15 percent of mu- table sites may not require a polar or hydrophobic amino acid for a protein that will remain functional under certain circumstances. Muta- tions occurring at these sites are still not selectively neutral, and their selective effect can show up only at the population level. The concept of selectively neutral mutations is not supported by these data. Nei (1969) discusses evolution at the molecular level from a different per- spective. He focuses on the increase of DNA content in germ cells, which was a thousandfold from bacteria to mammals in about 3 x 109 years. There was a concurrent increase in total genetic information. If Kimura's rates of nucleotide substitution are accepted, the probability that a nucleotide pair remained unchanged for 3 x 108 years is .87 or .97, indicating a very slow rate of substitution. The mammalian genome carries a great number of duplicate genes. A slightly altered gene may have a slightly different function from that of its original, but both may be essential for the normal functioning of the organism. Such genes are, for instance, the ones encoding the hu- man hemoglobin ( and y chains. They differ in 39 amino acid residues, a difference of about 10.7 percent of nucleotide pairs, but both chains are essential to the organism at different times during ontogeny. If there are, indeed, many duplicate genes in the human genome, Muller's esti- mate of 30,000 genes was very low. Counting, on the average, 1,500 nu-</page><page sequence="45">HUMAN BIOLOGY 129 cleotide pairs per gene, humans may have a total of about 2 million genes. Population Genetics The reality of human population structure in its tremendous cultural variation had been often distorted in the past by the uncritical appli- cation of rarefied mathematical models suitable for animal, but not hu- man, genetics. Dissatisfaction was voiced as early as 1963 (Cavalli- Sforza), but the discrepancy between theoretical and real situations was not fully appreciated until a few years ago. Readers will recall Morton's 1968 writing on the genetics of primitive groups, reviewed in the pre- vious issue of the present publication (Crawford 1969). Morton was one of the very few who had early doubts about the applicability of certain models, for instance the Dahlberg formula for estimating isolate size, which depends upon equal distribution of cousin marriages (Mor- ton 1955). Criticism was followed by a great amount of research and consistent efforts to improve upon existing models or, where this was not possible, to offer new ones instead, capable of generating outcomes that will have a closer correspondence with reality. Beginning with the mid-1950's, Cavalli-Sforza (1968) has been di- recting intensive data-collecting in the Parma Valley, Italy. His main concern was to assay the effect of genetic drift and to isolate the com- ponents of this random process. He found that drift was mainly deter- mined by two factors, population size and migration, which accords well with Wright's theoretical prediction (1946). Drift in the Parma Valley manifested itself in the increasing variation between villages as populaton density increased from the plain to the hill country to the high valley. Genetic variation was interpreted as being due to drift rather than to fluctuating environmental selection because the magni- tude of variation was the same for all genes under consideration. Dissatisfaction was further expressed by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1968) with existing models by Wright, Malecot, and Kimura; Weiss intended to assay the effect of migration distance on partially isolated populations. The problems in application arise from the fact that all the models are built for equilibrium conditions and depend on immu- table parameters, whereas in reality human populations are irregular in their geographic distribution, and density and mobility are not con- stants in relation to time and space. The authors offer instead a new model they call "the migration matrix," which is based on actual ob-</page><page sequence="46">130 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE served migration patterns. The new model also has shortcomings, the most serious of which is that it ignores age structure in the population. Morton and associates continue to use models discarded by Cavalli- Sforza, especially Malecot's distance function and Wright's relation be- tween the total inbreeding coefficient and its components. They make their corrections as they go along, so to speak. This group of geneticists is concerned with the distortions in human population structure that result from genealogical studies. Inbreeding is usually overestimated from pedigrees because nonrandom mating and drift are confounded, while at the same time the effect of population structure is underesti- mated because of the usual incompleteness of genealogical records (Morton et al. 1968). Using Malecot's distance function, Imaizumi and Morton (1969) assay the effect of isolation by distance in Japan and Sweden and com- pare the results with data from other countries. The mean coefficient of kinship for two random individuals from the same prefecture in Japan is estimated at .00057, and the coefficient for two random Japanese is .00013 or .00012. In Sweden the mean coeffi- cient of kinship is .00064 per subregion and .00010 for two random Swedes. The effect of local kinship was found high in Japan and in northeastern Brazil, in accordance with other evidence for preferential consanguineous marriage. However, the highest value was obtained in alpine Switzerland, where migration is severely limited. Even greater values can be expected among primitive populations. Azevedo et al. (1969) have used four categories of data in their study on the population structure of northeastern Brazil: distance distribu- tions, isonymy, metrics, and phenotypes. Anthropologists should feel particularly unhappy about isonymy used as a reliable measure of kin- ship between two individuals. The method was worked out by Crow and Mange (1965), but Charles Darwin used it once before. It is simply the agnatic transmission of surnames marking the pathways of ge- netic inheritance. Illegitimacy, differential fertility, adoption, and other changes in the paternal surname are considered as having the same effect as mutation and selection have for genes. It is needless to say how little cross-cultural validity the method has in the non-Western world. Morton himself complains that the coefficient of kinship among Chinese and Koreans estimated from family or clan names in Hawaii seems too high and "surnames are not genes" (1969: 99). Even in cul- tures where patrilineal isonymy reflects real kinship there is the prob- lem that common ancestry will be less for individuals bearing a com-</page><page sequence="47">HUMAN BIOLOGY 131 mon surname than for individuals having rare surnames and estimates of inbreeding will give realistic values only for the latter (Lasker 1969b). In Azevedo's Brazilian data, as could be expected, isonymy gave the highest estimate of inbreeding. But the inbreeding coefficient estimated from the data had a very close correspondence with that esti- mated from the pedigrees. The authors state in conclusion that the hypothesis of local panmixia subsumed under "isolation by distance" is invalid for northeastern Brazil. Hussels (1969) studied the genetic structure of Saas, a Swiss isolate with excellent parish records going back to the sixteenth century. Never- theless, inbreeding coefficients calculated on the basis of parish records give overly high values, especially for the end of the nineteenth century. Correction was done when it became evident that the effective popula- tion was drawn from a much larger region than the one covered by the register. The immigration rate is at least 21 percent and the proportion of parents, especially women, coming from other regions was high even before 1900. Morton and Hussels (1970) looked at isolation by distance in the general Swiss population. The mean inbreeding coefficient was estimated from blood group and rare genes at .00062, but Switzerland can also be divided into communes of low, moderate, and high inbreed- ing. Inbreeding gives the highest value for the canton of Valais, .00294. MacCluer and Schull (1970a,b) investigated the rate of evolution and the influence of age structure in human populations by using com- puterized stochastic simulation models. The data used in the programs were taken from a real population, the inhabitants of Takushima, a small island west of Kyushu in Japan. MacCluer and Schull see the value of using artificial populations generated in this way in culling answers from the data on the level of inbreeding and the contribution of remote consanguinity even when genealogical information is incom- plete. Two of their conclusions are especially interesting: (1) the avoid- ance of close inbreeding practiced by all societies may be an important force in the maintenance of heterozygosity, and the incest taboo may well turn out to be an important evolutionary step; (2) mating pat- terns peculiar to human populations can cause them to evolve at a rate different from that in other mammalian populations of similar size. Neel and Chagnon (1968) use demographic data from the Xavantes of Mato Grosso and the Yanomamo of southern Venezuela to postulate an evolutionary scheme of three principal demographic stages in his- tory and recent prehistory: (1) contemporary primitives with moderate fertility and early mortality; (2) agriculturalists with high fertility and</page><page sequence="48">132 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE a corresponding increase of prereproductive mortality; (3) industrial- ized and urbanized groups with a strong trend toward lower fertility but even lower mortality. Calculated with Crow's index, selection inten- sity is lowest for the first group, which may be considered representa- tive of ancestral populations in recent prehistory. Roberts (1968a,b) discusses the genetic effects of drastic size reduc- tion and measures genetic fitness in the population of Tristan da Cunha. Two separate events during the nineteenth century in which population size was suddenly and drastically reduced have resulted in the "bottle- neck" type of genetic drift: certain "founders" were completely elimi- nated, and relative contributions to the ancestral gene pool were changed. The intrinsic rate of natural increase for Tristan da Cunha cohorts seemed to be the best measure of fitness, because it deals with the intrinsic capacity of the population to increase in its particular envi- ronment rather than with the actual rate of growth. The rate for the earliest and last two Tristan da Cunha cohorts exceeds the highest U.S. rate. The entire June 1968 issue (Vol. 15) of Eugenics Quarterly was de- voted to the Fourth Princeton Conference of 1967 on population genet- ics and demography. The papers reprinted here all discuss some aspect of human mating patterns, mostly assortative mating and its effect on genetic structure and fertility of populations. The participants included geneticists, sociologists, and one anthropologist, J. N. Spuhler. Salzano and Freire-Maia (1970) have published the results of population re- search in Brazil since the mid-1950's. The slender volume of 179 pages includes a tremendous amount of information on the demography, gene- tics, and morphology of Brazilians within a historical context. The 24 tables reproducing original research data from sources quoted in the text are valuable and very informative. Albinism among the Hopi was investigated by two zoologists (Woolf and Dukepoo 1969.) Whereas the overall frequency of the condition is one in 20,000, the Cuna Indians of San Blas, Panama, have long been famous for their numerous albinos. It seems now that the Hopi, the Zuni, and the Jemez also have unusually high frequencies of albinism. Why this remained undetected for so long is explained by the differ- ences in population size. The Hopi number about 6,000 and the Cuna about 20,000, and the relative frequency is not as conspicuous in a small population as it is in a large one. The frequency of albinos in the total Hopi population distributed over three mesas is one in 231. When the first mesa is excluded (all cases were observed in the second</page><page sequence="49">HUMAN BIOLOGY 133 and third), the incidence becomes one in 192. Based on Hrdlicka's count in 1900, the frequency was then one in 182. Since heterozygote advantage for the carrier could not very well be invoked, the authors advance a hypothesis of "sexual advantage" of albino males, who for obvious reasons could not participate in any activity that exposed them to sunlight, such as working in the fields. Staying in the village during the day when the other men were away gave the albino men differ- ential access to women. Reed (1969) points out weaknesses of methodology in previously published estimates of Caucasian genes in American Negroes. The de- ficiencies include lack of good survey data on gene frequencies in the presumed African slaving areas, inadequate information on American Caucasians and Negroes, small samples, and lack of evidence that the genes selected for the estimate are not subject to strong selective forces among Negroes in the United States. Reed found the magnitude of gene flow in Oakland, California, to be .2195 ? .0093, considerably less than the previously accepted value of nearly 30 percent. On the basis of the new 20 percent value of Caucasian genes in the American Negro popu- lation, Stern (1969) revised his model for estimating the number of gene pairs contributing to the pigmentation of the American Negro. He ob- tained best agreement with observations from models of three and four gene pairs. Livingstone (1969b) has made use of models for four gene pairs to test the effect of different variables on the evolution of human skin color. With 80 percent dominance of the dark alleles, a population that started out with very light skin could have achieved the coloring of the American Indian in about 10,000 years, and in 30,000 years all the pres- ent differences in human skin color could have evolved. Without domi- nance the same effects could be achieved in a much shorter time and the total present range could evolve in roughly 16,000 years. In both cases optimizing selection and a maximal difference of 6 percent in fit- ness are assumed. Post (1969a) continued to pursue his relaxed-selection hypothesis with the second part of his research on nasal septal deformities. He finds that the incidence of septal deformity is less than 18 percent among primitive populations, two American Indian groups and Australian ab- origines excepted. In 'long civilized" peoples, on the other hand, the frequencies range from 27 to 67 percent. Adam objected to Post's use of red-green color-blindness data in sup- port of the relaxed-selection hypothesis (Adam 1969). Logically, cen-</page><page sequence="50">134 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE ters of earliest civilization should show the highest rates of color vision deficiencies, but actually peoples of the Far East and the Middle East have frequencies ranging from 4.4 to 5.4 percent, whereas the mean European rate is 7.4 percent. Red-green color blindness is a blanket term for six different defects all of which are X-linked. The alleles are distributed over two loci, and it seems very unlikely that selection could operate through the various phenotypic expressions with the same in- tensity. Some primitive groups show spuriously low rates because of faulty testing techniques. Furthermore, the rate of red-green color blind- ness in both primitive and civilized populations is much higher than the rate of total color blindness or blue blindness. Accumulation of muta- tions under relaxed selection could not account for this. Wolpoff (1969b) relies heavily on Post for evidence to support his auxiliary hypothesis of Brace's theory of probable mutation effect. The restrictions Wolpoff places on the PME to make it less universal are reasonable, but his suggestions on where and how supporting evidence could be found are not. For instance, how could anyone possibly de- sign a computer simulation study of DNA structure in which pleiotropy at the nucleotide base level and reduced selection for morphological features at the phenotypic level could be tested simultaneously? Adam provides evidence to support his criticism of Post. In retesting the Baganda, whose red-green color-blindness rate was given by Post from the literature as 1.86 percent, it was found that, if tested by anom- aloscopy, the Baganda red-green color-blind rate is almost twice as high, 3.09 percent (Adam et al. 1970). In another study on color blind- ness among a group of Chilean Aymara, Cruz-Coke and Barrera (1969) have found an incidence of 3.48 percent. Here, too, the investigators have used a portable anomaloscope, a practice they recommend to all who wish to make color vision surveys in human populations. Ray (1969) reports the results of his fieldwork in the states of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa on color blindness among urban, rural, and tribal popula- tions. He finds that the overall trend in his data gives support to Posts hypothesis but that the difference between long civilized and recently civilized populations in eastern India in rates of color blindness is sta- tistically insignificant. Ray also warns against the use of data from small and isolated groups, since genetic drift and the founder effect may cause unusual frequencies. Primates Schmitt (1970) presents an evolutionary-genetic discussion of pri- mate blood and serum traits.</page><page sequence="51">HUMAN BIOLOGY 135 The ABO system. Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus have only A and 0 antigens that are comparable in serological maturity to the A1 and 0 antigens of newborn humans. Pongo pygmaeus and the Hylobatidae have only A and B antigens that are very similar to the A and B anti- gens of adult humans. B has a "suppressor effect' over A. Gorilla g. gorilla and G. g. berengei have only a B-like antigen, named Bm(onkey) because it is shared with cercopithecoids and prosimians. It does not agglutinate with anti-A or anti-B human antisera. The Ceboidea have a B-like antigen. The MNS system. Pan troglodytes and P. pantscus share the M anti- gen with humans. The MN antigens of all other subhuman primates are very different from the human form (only the precursor substances show extensive similarities). The human Ss isoantibodies fail to elicit any re- action from subhuman primate erythrocytes. The Rh system. Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo have a D (Rh) -like antigen that is much weaker than the human D. The Hylobatidae also have a D-like antigen that is even more dissimilar to the human one. Both Pongidae and Hylobatidae have a c(hr')-like antigen much weaker than its human counterpart. Red cells of other subhuman primates give only negative reactions with human anti-D and anti-c antibodies (Macaca mulatta has, of course, a D-like antigen that led to the discovery of the Rhesus factor in humans). Leukocyte antigens. P. troglodytes, P. pygmaeus, and G. g. gorilla all share some white-cell antigens recognized first in man (group 5 and group 9 are separate from each other and from the HL-A system). Serum proteins. Haptoglobins seem to be polymorphic only in hu- mans. Pongids have an immunologically identical Hp' and nothing else. The hylobate and non-hominoid Hp1 has a partial identity with the same human allele. Gc: Pongo has Gc1-i, Gc2-1, and Gc2-2 identical with man. Pan and Symphalangus have a "Gc ape" allele not within the human Gc-system. The non-hominoid Gc allele shows only partial iden- tity with the human Gc. Tf: Transferrins are strikingly polymorphic in subhuman primates. Pan and Gorilla have Tf variants that are slower- moving than the human TfC. Pongo has two Tf types: one is slower and the other is faster than the human TfC. There is complete immuno- logical identity between human and pongid Tf variants. Hylobatids, cercopithecoids, and prosimians have all very fast-moving transferrins that are immunologically very different from the human Tf. The Ceboidea Tf is different from all the others. Lp: Pan and Pongo have Lp(a+). Gorillas tested by Schmitt (1970) had Lp(a-), but the sample was small and this is not a definite conclusion. Nonhominoid primates seem</page><page sequence="52">136 R. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE to be all Lp (a-). Ag: Ag(y) seems widespread among Old World pri- mates. No polymorphisms were found so far. In humans Ag(y) and Ag(x) are determined by two codominant autosomal genes. It is prob- able that Ag(x) is a human-specific mutant. Gm, Isf, and Inv: IgG,. P. troglodytes, G. gorilla, and the hylobatids share Gm( a) and Gm( z) with man. Pongo and Papio have only Gm( z). IgG,. Pongids share Gm(s), Gm(bO), Gm(C5), and Gm(b3) with man. IgG2. No subhuman primate has Gm (n). Isf(1), the only known vari- ant of the Isf system, is shared by P. paniscus and P. troglodytes. Inv system. So far there has been no evidence that this system exists in sub- human primates. Schmitt arrives at the following conclusions from the data. The Ce- boidea must have diverged very early, still during the subprimate stage. From then on they evolved parallel with the rest of the primates. The Cercopithecoidea and Hominoidea also diverged at the prosimian an- cestral stage. The Hylobatidae must have diverged from the earliest Hominoidea at a much earlier date than hitherto believed. It is most interesting that the Pongidae should diverge so strongly among them- selves in their blood and serum traits. From an immunological view- point one must assume a polyphyletic origin of Pan, Pongo, and Gorilla from the Dryopithecine (Proconsul) radiation. The differences between pongids and hominids in their blood and serum group systems are so striking that, in spite of resemblances, a very early speciation of the Hominidae becomes a strong probability. Boyer et al. (1969) use hemoglobin data from New World primates to support non-Darwinian evolution. In five genera tested (Ateles, Sai- miri, Aotus, Callicebus, Saguinus), hemoglobin A was invariant, but Hb-A2(a2(2) was polymorphic in three. The amount of A2 hemoglobin accounts only for about 1/160 to 1/16 of the total hemoglobin, and for this reason it is presumed to be functionally unimportant. The authors contend that an effectively functionless and therefore selectively neutral gene can bring about both polymorphism and evolutionary changes. Egozcue (1968) observed spontaneous chromosome exchanges in six primate species. The rate ran from 2 percent in Alouatta caraya to 20 percent in Cebus capucinus; the mean percentage was 10.2; 95.4 per- cent of exchange involved homologous chromosomes; and 91.7 percent involved Class I exchanges (symmetrical and viable except when they result in homozygosity for a lethal gene). Exchanges involving chromo- somes with heterochromatic regions were 1.6 times as frequent as were those that involved nonmarked pairs.</page><page sequence="53">HUMAN BIOLOGY 137 Doolittle and Mross (1970) report that fibrinopeptides, in spite of their high degree of interspecific variability, are identical in chimpanzee and man. The previous identities were with the a and (3 chains of hemo- globin and with cytochrome c. Trisomy in a small acrocentric chromosome caused clinical and be- havioral manifestations in an infant chimpanzee that closely resembled Down's syndrome (McClure et al. 1969). Some of the symptoms were retarded growth and retarded neurological and postural development, epicanthus, hyperfiexibility of the joints, and muscle hypotonia. Goodman and Tashian (1969) obtained blood samples from chim- panzees of different geographic origin. The animals were from West Africa, the Congo, and around Bukavu. A fourth group consisted of typologically classified subspecies of Pan troglodytes. Of 106 chimpan- zees, in whom both tranferrin and phosphoglucomutase types were de- termined, more than half were of unknown origin. Nevertheless, the ani- mals could be divided into a Western group, on the basis of an invari- able association of the TfC/C and TfC/B genotypes with the PGM 2/2 type, and an Eastern Congo group, in which PGM 1/1 was associated with TfcD/D, D/E, and D/A. The Western group's genetic uniformity contrasts sharply with the marked polymorphism in the Congo chim- panzees, indicating that the two have evolved as geographically separate groups. The Western group may be a peripheral population cut off from the chimpanzee main line by ancestors of Homo, whereas the Eastern chimpanzees may be the direct descendants of the main evolutionary line of Pan. Human Ethology One of the dividends of the ever-increasing interest in animal behav- ior is a new sophistication in tackling old problems of human behavior, both individually and socially, the physiological causations and con- comitants, the evolutionary and adaptive significance, and a move away from the past approach of a strict nature-nurture (innate-learned) di- chotomy. It is the trend that appears promising rather than any one particular substantive work, for there still exist much speculation and crossing of analytical levels, often resulting in little more than outright theromorphism or anthropomorphism. A very useful review of the his- tory of ethology and its concepts has been given by Hess (1970) as a chapter in the new edition of Carmichael's Manual of Child Psychology. Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1970) has produced a good text on ethology, and its Chapter 18 provides many interesting examples of the application of</page><page sequence="54">138 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE ethological concepts to human behavior, much of it unconvincing be- yond the studies on early responses of the human neonate such as ori- enting, smiling, and the like. Of less quality is a chapter by Guthrie (1970) on the evolution of threat display, where the whole thorny prob- lem of fixed action patterns or constancy of cue stimuli is never faced, in his examination of human behavior. Although not explicitly ethology, Chapple's (1970) book is an attempt to bridge physical and cultural an- thropology by centering attention on the nature of endogenous rhythms, which occur on most levels of human individual and social behavior. An interesting essay by Berkowitz (1969), a prolific experimenter on the causative factors of human aggression, takes a very critical look at the Lorenz-Ardrey-Morris-Storrs approach to human aggression, which relies on phylogenetic inheritance of innate disposition to aggressive warlike behavior, or on psychoanalytic interpretation. Those upset with Lorenz's and Ardrey's often sweeping conjectures about human aggres- sion and its anlagen in nonhuman primate groups, but who wish a more reasoned perspective on the biological basis of aggressive behavior in men and animals, can consult Tinbergen (1969), whose own ethologi- cal approach to these questions is more careful. Hamburg's (1968) ap- proach, which sees our aggression as an expression of past selective pres- sures operating in a radically altered environment, will find an echo in the Gilula and Daniels (1969) essay, which relies heavily on the frus- tration-aggression hypothesis. One should first consult Berkowitz (1969) though on some of the problems of this approach. This reviewer attempt- ed to treat human aggression as a species-specific phenomenon arising out of a complex interdependent capacity for symbolism, social struc- ture, egoism, and a genetic relationship with other primates (Holloway 1968). The bald equating of other animal behaviors as homologous with the behavior of humans has not been without criticism, as evidenced by the book edited by Montagu (1968b) and a reply to Morris by J. Lewis and Towers (1969). An interesting paper by Christian (1970), although not about human ethology, provides a hypothesis about social subordination and mam- malian evolution, suggesting that population density and differences in dominance and subordination could have been important dynamics in a number of mammalian adaptive radiations. A review of dominance- subordination relationships in general has been given by Van Krevald (1970). Gibson (1970) has taken a look at the development of perception as an adaptive process, suggesting that perceptual evolution (and onto-</page><page sequence="55">HUMAN BIOLOGY 139 genetic development) first favors detection of information needed for moving around-and avoiding dangers-in environments before fine discrimination of multidimensional complex sets of objects, a view that fits both the paleontological record and the actual comparative and ontogenetic pictures of perceptual processes. A curious paper by Provins et al. (1968) presented a set of common-sense notions about how to study perceptual and motor skills cross-culturally, but never presented any empirical knowledge. Of a more substantive nature, Ekman, Soren- son, and Friesen (1969) present data on cross-cultural responses to pho- tographs of facial displays of emotion, showing that there are pancul- tural elements in facial expressions, although the agreement quotients are higher in literate than in nonliterate societies. Those wishing to pursue the matter will find Grant's (1969) studies on human facial expression and ethology useful. The review of Garai and Scheinfeld (1968) provides evidence of sex differences in human behavior, as does a later review by Garai (1970) on mental health, although the main findings are based on psychologi- cal methods used in Western countries. Honzik et al. (1969) have found some interesting but unexplained data showing that the verbal and per- formance IQ's of females undergoing open-heart surgery are lower than in males. The sample was comprised of 60 boys and 58 girls, 5 to 16 years of age. The authors suggest that cultural treatment and periods of maximum susceptibility differ for girls, since their central nervous system matures more rapidly. Freedman and Freedman (1969) have presented evidence that there are definitely behavioral differences between the newborn of Chinese American and European American parents. The sample was made up of 24 newborn of each group studied in a nursery after birth, all from the middle class. Twenty-five behavioral signs, rated 1 to 9 in intensity, 15 neurological signs, temperament, sensory development, motor devel- opment, CNS maturity, and social interest and response were investi- gated. The main loading on a multivariate analysis of variance indi- cated a decided difference (p = .008) in temperament (excitability, imperturbability). Chinese Americans were less changeable, less per- turbable, tended to become habituated more readily, and calmed more easily when upset. No significant differences were found in sensori- motor development, CNS maturity, or in social responses. Why? Sample size? Methods? Prenatal uterine environment? Or is it possible that there do exist racial differences with genetic involvement in temperament? Other studies on a wider sample, including Africans, are in progress.</page><page sequence="56">140 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE For a more general statement on personality development in infancy, see Freedman (1968). Finally, there is an extremely provocative little paper by Anonymous (1970), with a sample size of N -1 (! ). "Anonymous" found that his beard growth diminished when in isolation on an island for several weeks, but that the day before he left for the mainland, the beard growth increased, which he relates to the anticipation of sexual activity. Anony- mous studied the phenomenon scientifically. He collected the shavings of his beard once every 24 hours and found that higher shaving weights accorded well with rate of sebum production, which he assumes is a good indicator of androgenous activity. Apparently a good jolt of weekend mainland sexual activity led to measurable declines of beard growth. The editors of Nature attest and confirm the scientific status of Anony- mous and his seriousness. A sample of one can be easily discounted, but hopefully it will not be ignored, since it raises a number of interesting questions about cycles of sexual behavior, and possible efferent cortical effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal relationships, calling to mind something like an anticipatory or priming relationship. Brain, Behavior, and Language It is impossible to do more than mention a few highlights of an enormously complex and expanding field. First of all, there is a clear trend toward the inclusion of study of the nervous system within both human biology and primatology to a degree never present before. Two volumes have appeared explicitly oriented toward the comparative neu- roanatomy of the primate brain. Petras and Noback (1969) have edited a symposium containing a large number of papers, most of outstanding quality, including a timely review of Tertiary primates by Simons, re- views of the auditory system by Moskowitz and the visual system by Campbell, and a full presentation by Stephan and Andy on the volu- metric indices of primate brains. Noback and Montagna (1970) have edited the first volume of a new series devoted to primatology, contain- ing some fifteen contributions on the primate nervous system, both qualitative and quantitative. Bourne, Volume 1 (1969) contains a com- plete descriptive study of the central nervous system of the chimpanzee by Shantha and Manocha (1969). There is a more quantitatively ori- ented review by W. J. Jackson et al. (19691) in Volume 4 of Primates in Medicine, edited by Reynolds, as well as a fine review of chimpanzee psychobiology by Reynolds and Farber (1969). Additional papers on the brains and behavior of primates can be found in the volumes ed- ited by Hofer (1969).</page><page sequence="57">HUMAN BIOLOGY 141 A descriptive account of differences in the cerebelli of Galago and Tupaia by Haines (1969) shows advances in the cerebellum of the Tupaia over that of insectivores, leaving the tree shrew nervous system an amalgam of primate-nonprimate characteristics. Girgis (1968) made a study of the external morphology of the Grivet monkey based on 20 adult specimens, and Hershkovitz (1970a) has written a fine study of the fissural patterns in New World monkeys. Pribram, Spinelli, and Reitz (1969) removed the peristriate cortex immediately anterior to the visual cortex (area 17) in monkeys, and found that such ablations failed to upset discrimination of visual pat- terns, which suggests cortical-subcortical pathways and the relative un- importance of cortico-cortical connections in subhuman primates. The inferotemporal region of monkeys is becoming increasingly implicated in visual reception, and as a possible corticofugal mechanism effecting perception, according to the observations of Gross et al. (1969). In the area of social behavior, Dicks, Myers, and Kling (1969) found that lesions of the uncus and amygdala had drastic effects on the social behavior of free-ranging Rhesus males. The lesions resulted in social indifference and failure to display the appropriate aggressive and submissive acts, and the males were expelled from the social group, eventually dying. Tobias (1970) has published a most useful review of previously pub- lished data on human brain size and race, calling needed and long- overdue attention to the fact that there is hardly a single source of brain weights for Negroes that has been carefully controlled for variables of sex, body size, age at death, nutritional state, source of sample, occu- pational group, cause of death, lapse of time after death to fixation, temperature, level of brain severance, cerebrospinal fluid, meninges, or blood vessels. In short, records of racial variations in brain weights do not exist in any reliable form. Heidary and Tomasch (1969) have inves- tigated the neuron numbers and perikaryon areas in the nuclei of hu- man cerebelli, finding their results at serious variance with those else- where in the literature. This should bring home the fact that the brain, like any other part of the body, is a variable organ, and reliable data of a quantitative nature must rely on better samples. An important piece of rethinking on the evolution of the neocortex has been given by Diamond and HaLl (1969). They suggest that differ- entiation and expansion of the neocortex proceeded independently in the major evolutionary lines of mammals, a view likely to form a whole new basis for comparative neurology, since they see "association" cortex arising as a primitive sensory area, evolving independently in response to similar ecological niches. This view is certainly supported by Jerison's</page><page sequence="58">142 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE (1969) continuing studies on brain-body weights in different animals both contemporary and fossil, since he finds the weight of the brain re- lated to body weight increases in successive geological eras within sev- eral vertebrate classes. (See also his paper in Noback and Montagna 1970.) Sacher (1970) has applied multivariate techniques, hoping to derive general trends of brain expansion in the primates, and finding essentially what has been known for almost a century about the increase of the cortex and brain size upon body weight from the technique's loadings. This paper claims that this reviewer (R.H.) has "thrown out the baby with the bath water" because I am cautious about the use of quantitative data, inferring that I don't find it useful. However, not a single meaningful relationship between brain sizes and behavior is gen- erated by his approach. Holloway (1969b, 1970b) is enthusiastic about quantitative studies, but wishes to see some relationship made between quantitative differences in neural systems and species-specific behavior; he feels that the whole question of suitable parameters of neural orga- nization needs careful thought and study. With Krantz (1968), Hollo- way (1970b) sees memory as a key behavioral attribute in human evo- lution, but he regards this attribute as dependent on more than "per- sistence hunting," for the efficacy of all generic concepts of memory depends not only on storage but on strategies of coding, decoding, or- ganization of experience, recall, and the interdependence of these with symboling behavior and social control (Holloway 1968). A considerable amount of progress has been made in understanding the terrible effects of poor nutrition and poverty on the development of the human brain. An excellent explorative summary is given by Eichen- wald and Fry (1969). Fishman, Prensky, and Dodge (1969) found that total lipid content, particularly in those classes associated with myelini- zation, is severely changed in infants suffering from malnutrition. Such effects are found not only in the cortex but, as Chase, Lindsley, and O'Brian (1969) report, in the cerebellum as well, where they found severe impairment in less prolific and smaller cells. On the other end of environmental effects, Bennett, Rosenzweig, and Diamond (1969) continue to find heavier dry and wet weights in rat brains subjected to enriched environments. A number of timely and interesting reports by Winick (1968, 1969), Winick and Rosso (1969), and Winick et al. (1970) show that brain cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy are depen- dent on proper protein sources, as measured by DNA and RNA cell contents; these reports have demonstrated clear deficiencies in Chilean children with marasmus who died accidentally. Dobbing and Sands</page><page sequence="59">HUMAN BIOLOGY 143 (1970) find two major periods of cellular multiplication in the human brain: at 15 to 20 weeks' gestation, and at 25 weeks' gestation to the second postnatal year. The steepest part of the logarithmic curve occurs early, a finding perfectly in accord with Winick's work. At a more gross level, Scarr (1969) has found a differential survival for larger newborns, and shows that the heavier twin in identical pairs scores higher on in- telligence measures. A fascinating study by Kruska (1970) shows that domestication can have dramatic effects on brain size, a possibility long considered, but for which little or no data has existed heretofore. Kruska found a reduc- tion of up to 34 percent in the brain size of domestic pigs, particularly in the schizocortex and archicortex, being lowest in the neocortex. Other subcortical nuclei, such as in the olfactory limbic, and septal systems also showed a decrease in size. 'A new look into the nature of language and brain relationships has been taken, based mainly on Geschwind's (1965) analysis of disconnec- tion syndromes, aphasics, and the importance of cortical-cortical path- ways to mediate cross-modality transfer and localization of language functioning in both Wernicke's and Broca's areas of the human brain. The inferior parietal "association" cortex is thus seen as a major synthe- sizing area, capable of cortical-to-cortical mediations with the environ- ment, in contrast to the cortical-limbic patterns that are seen in non- human primates. Lancaster (1968) has seized upon this framework to arrive at the profound view that language ("object naming") developed because it was adaptive in hominid evolution, particularly with refer- ence to hunting. It is impossible to go into all the neurological details that both support such a localization viewpoint and are at odds with it. Those interested will find Lenneberg's (1969) review of the species- specific nature of human language a good beginning, and his book (1967) stresses the necessity of understanding language in the context of developmental biology, which may indeed require a closer examina- tion of some aspects of human ethology such as babbling and mother- infant affectual exchange. A brilliant but difficult-to-read paper was given by Count (1968), which ties in speech with a wide biosocial net- work of interdependencies. The infraparietal cortex not only makes in- terconnections but has two-way relationships with an important part of the underlying diencephalon, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, which connects with other subcortical nuclei and pathways. Rakic and Sidman (1969) have shown that the pulvinar is of telencephalic origin, since the pulvinar's cells originate in the telencephalon and migrate</page><page sequence="60">144 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE downward during the fifth and eighth lunar month of gestation. Bell (1968) has found from an examination of numerous cases of thalamot- omy that there is no exclusive role of association cortex in the elabora- tion of speech. Similarly, Van Buren (1969) has found alterations in normal speech with stimulation of sites within the pulvinar of the thal- amus. On the subject of language capacity or capability in chimpanzees, Kellogg (1968) has reviewed the studies on home-raised chimpanzees, pointing out that with no prattle or babble there is no language, but that gestures can be learned. Lieberman et al. (1969) have studied the vocal tracts of monkeys and apes, and believe that since their respective pharyngeal regions cannot change cross-sectional area, the human speech output mechanism is indeed species-specific. Most exciting, however, is the study by Gardner and Gardner (1969) that the chimpanzee named Washoe could learn a large repertoire of signs based on the American sign language for the deaf, and that Washoe was capable of sponta- neous naming, transferring to new referents, and combining and recom- bining of signs. Another interesting finding is that of Gallup (1969), who claims that chimpanzees (but not monkeys) are able to recognize themselves in mirrors after prolonged exposure and marking with red dyes. Does this mean that chimpanzees have a self-concept? Davenport and Rogers (1970) have found that chimpanzees and orangutans dis- criminate tactile cues between two objects and select the one matching a visually presented shape, which is clear evidence for intermodal equiv- alence of stimuli and transfer, and is thus not a behavior specific to man. All of this should make one skeptical about how deep the gulf is sup- posed to be between ape and human cognitive behavior, for Washoe's actions are clearly very close to aspects of human language behavior, at least cognitively. On the other hand, Bronowski and Bellugi's (1970) review of these developments indicates that the ability to "name" is not confined to humans, as Lancaster would have it, but that the process of reconstitution is the human mind's hallmark, for the human is able to find for himself inductive rules of usage that make up not only a gram- mar but a philosophy of reality structure as well. In other words, as Count and Lenneberg (and many others) have indicated, human lan- guage is far more than simply "object-naming." This reviewer (Hollo- way 1969a) did not dwell on the neuroanatomical or adaptive aspects of language behavior in hominids, but suggested that there are impor- tant aspects of language development in relationship to social control and affectual bond-strengthening between offspring and mother. The</page><page sequence="61">HUMA1N BIOLOGY 145 adaptive aspects are too apparent and banal to need explanation. It was suggested, however, that the cognitive process of stone tool-making was extremely similar to, if not identical with, that of language, and that one cannot divorce considerations of the evolution of egoism (1969a) and hedonism (1968) from these processes in human evolution. The next few years should witness a few breakthroughs in our understand- ing of both the adaptive significance of language and its neurobiologi- cal causation. Already there is good evidence of gross neuroanatomical evidence for the relationship of cortical regions to language evolving. Geschwind and Levitsky (1968) have found very definite and signifi- cant asymmetries between left and right temporal cortex in human brains, involving the upper surface of the lobe and the planum tem- porale, which is larger on the left of 65 percent of t-he sample, and only 11 percent on the right, being up to one-third larger in the left temporal speech cortex. The problem that confronts the use of this kind of data is at least twofold: (1) the holistic nature of interactions between cor- tex and subcortical components, and the species-specific development and endogenous nature of these interactions; and (2) the nature of language and the organization of experience. Finally, Cohen, Noblin, and Silverman (1968) have studied verbal and nonverbal memorization skills in tests of electroconvulsive shock to left, right, or both hemispheres of neurologically normal patients (although one wonders why they volunteer). As predicted, decrements for left-hemisphere shocked groups were larger in verbal tasks, whereas the reverse occurred for right-hemisphere shocked patients. Levy (1969) has offered a possible explanation for the evolution of dominance (lat- eral), suggesting that such lateralization was an adaptation permitting control of unique vocal apparatus (see Lieberman et al. 1969, above), uncomplicated by competitive antagonism between hemispheres. Fur- ther, he claims that the three-dimensional visualization ability is sup- pressed in the right hemisphere: the left analyzes stimulus properties, and the right abstracts the stimulus gestalt. He believes that during hominid evolution the "mute" hemisphere (right) was lateralized for gestalt perception as a consequence of antagonism between language and perception. He tested this idea on people with bilateral language centers or with partial language competency in both hemispheres, and found that they performed more poorly in tests of perceptual function. How this antagonism develops, if the theory is correct, still remains a major unsolved problem in neurology, but it is certainly an important clue to handedness, and possibly to tools and adaptation in human evo-</page><page sequence="62">146 B. L. HOLLOWAY AND E. SZINYEI-MERSE lution. J. D. Johnson and Gazzinga (1969) have made an interesting study on split-brain preparations and the relationship of cortical-cortical pathways to reinforcement. In case 1 they presented discrimination cues to the right hemisphere and reinforced the left, finding no learning. In case 2, with both cues and reinforcement to the left side, learning took place rapidly. In case 3 the task was also learned with reinforcement to both hemispheres, although the cues were presented only to the right side of the brain. They conclude that the right hemisphere has little or no ability for verbal expression, but it can learn tasks and recognize vocabulary and logical relationships. Retrospect This review, as constricted as it is, hopefully has shown that human biology in all of its physical anthropological manifestations is of enormous scope, and that the advances made in the biological sciences, indeed in all of the sciences, have great significance for the field of physical an- thropology. Much of the literature covered during these two years is inadequate, for reasons of sample size, replicability, lack of synthesis of the observed morphological patterns with physiological and genetic causative factors, or lack of clearly demonstrated relationships to adap- tive processes or functions. The physical anthropologist can no longer digest the vast amount of literature and thought in human biology in current research and new syntheses and theoretical formulation. There has been a definite trend toward specialization and thereby a kind of fragmentation, perhaps adaptive. We are convinced that the fragmenta- tion and specialization will and should continue, but that if we wish to maintain some overall grasp of and identity with physical anthropology, we must rely heavily on reviews, and develop a consciousness that the various areas in our discipline require a periodic production of hand- book-like chapters written by the most able and knowledgeable in the subfields for the well-being and intellectual enlargement of the field. Finally, we would like to raise the question of whether perhaps the time has come for physical anthropologists to consider their own future of integration, at a time when specialization is increasing, and when we are often a service sector to the whole of the discipline. Human biology has not only come of age pedagogically; it is also extremely relevant to almost all of the social and material issues of our day, and within an- thropology generally, there is a tendency to forget just how biological life is. Indeed, a newer emphasis is developing, away from that of the past century-which had the great value of showing the biologist how</page><page sequence="63">HUMAN BIOLOGY 147 important culture is for understanding human behavior-to that of in- dicating how important our biological heritage is for sane, moral, adap- tive human behavior. The synthesis between these approaches to human existence and improvement is surely close at hand. We no longer believe it reasonable for cultural anthropologists to simply consider the biologi- cal realm as some sort of constant, profitably ignored so that social variables alone can be studied. We believe further that there has been more flow of an appreciative perspective from the cultural side to the biological than the reverse, and that corrections are called for. This re- view has brought into striking relief the contradictions between anthro- pology departments utilizing physical anthropologists mainly as a small service sector and those drawing upon them as providers of a richer and fuller understanding of human biosocial adaptations. We raise the ques- tion of the feasibility of forming departments of human biology that would remain closely allied with medical and social sciences but that as more autonomous units would be allowed to develop more fully and offer a more enriched content than at the present time. We do not wish this to be construed as "isolationism," but rather as a way to keep more open the communicative and research flow among those interested in the fullest understanding of biosocial man. As a service sector within de- partments dedicated to the maintaining of the four-field approach, there are necessary administrative constrictions that militate against fuller de- velopment and social relevancy. We do not believe the answer lies in de- partments of anatomy and dentistry, biochemistry, genetics, or neurol- ogy, etc., within the medical schools, but elsewhere, either in expanded anthropology departments with more conscious attention to enriching human biological pedagogy or in departments of human biology which consciously expect continued input from the social sciences.
