<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 175     CHAPTER FOUR FALSE ALLEGATIONS OR PROOFS? RIḍĀ’S FORMATIVE  POLEMICS ON CHRISTIANITY In his annotated translation of Riḍā’s above-mentioned monograph,  Shubuhāt, Simon Wood argues that Riḍā’s specific wording of the  title of his earliest work on Christianity as Shubuhāt al-Naṣārā wā  Ḥujaj al-ʾIslām (Allegations of Christians and Proofs of Islam) was  carefully chosen. It was no accident, Wood says, that the book was  not entitled Shubuhāt al-Naṣārā wā Ḥujaj al-Muslimīn (The Criticisms  of the Christians and the arguments of Muslims) or Shubuhāt  al-Naṣrāniyya wā Ḥujaj al-ʾIslām (the Obscurities of Christianity and  the Clear Proof of Islam). Wood does not give any reason why he  has given three different English translations for the two keywords,  Shubuhāt and Ḥujaj as appearing in Riḍā’s title. He further thinks  that Riḍā’s ‘title reflected his understanding of an ideal or ultimate  Christianity that was not opposed to Islam. Ideal Christianity, how- ever, was not that represented by European missionaries or their local  allies. In that sense, Riḍā felt that the majority of his contemporary  Muslims had become an argument against their own religion.’1  Wood’s argument is true when looking at how Riḍā understood  the Christian Scriptures as a whole and their relation to Islam. But  his analysis of Riḍā’s wording of the title is far-fetched and not con- vincing. Wood has only depended on Riḍā’s monograph bearing this  title, but nowhere mentioned that it was a collection of sixteen articles  that had appeared earlier as a special section in a number of issues  that Riḍā had compiled a few years later in a small volume. As a  matter of fact, and in contradiction to Wood’s argument, Riḍā headed  eleven of these articles in al-Manār with the phrase, Shubuhāt  al-Masīḥiyyīn (sometimes al-Naṣārā) wā Ḥujaj al-Muslimīn (The  Allegations of the Christians and the Proofs of Muslims).2  1 Wood, op  cit., p. 40. 2 See, vol. 4/15, vol. 4/16, vol. 4/17, vol. 4/19, vol. 5/19, vol. 6/6, vol. 6/7, vol. 6/8,  vol. 6/9, vol. 6/11, vol. 6/12. © umar ryad, 2009 | doi 10.1163/9789004179110_006 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC-BY-NC License. </page> <page sequence="2"> 176 chapter four As it was his initial work on the subject, Riḍā’s Shubuhāt only  represents, as I shall show in the coming chapters, a formative phase  of its author’s views on Christian belief. Drawing a final conclusion  on the basis of Riḍā’s whole understanding of Christianity and his  polemics with his Christian counterparts as a result of studying only  this book would be misleading. The work itself should be evaluated  in the light of Riḍā’s subsequent writings in the historical context  mentioned above. Besides, Riḍā published these articles from time to  time as a response to a variety of Christian Arab missionaries, roughly  between 1901-1904. In that period Western missionary literature in  Arabic was not very widespread among Muslims. As we shall see, this  treatise was a rather unsystematic book, sometimes of an inconsistent  and rhetorical style. In the present chapter, we will discuss Riḍā’s responses as he  selected them in the monograph, but we supplement them with other  background ideas that appeared in the journal. Discussing the details  of all articles under this section would, however, fall outside the scope  of the present chapter. Riḍā composed six of his articles in al-Manār  (which were excluded in his monograph) under the same title as  answers to the Egyptian Protestant Magazine. Some of these articles  also did not directly deal with his views on Christianity, but were  mostly devoted to refute Christian ‘allegations’ against the Qurʾān.3  In a similar manner, Riḍā published four lengthy reactions to some  other articles written in the above-mentioned Brazilian Arabic journal  al-Munāẓir (see, chapter 2) by a Christian Syrian emigrant under the  name of Rafūl Saʿādeh. These articles were not included in the mono- graph either. They mainly contain refutations of Rafūl Saʿādeh’s argu- ments that Islam had no success, except because of the Christian  principles it bore; and that Muslims were not as wise as other con- querors of Syria (such as the Seleucids and Romans), who had never  attacked the habits and feelings of the Syrians.4 But the reason why  Riḍā did not include these articles in the monograph is not known. It is also worth noting that the last two articles of Riḍā’s monograph  were written as a reply to Faraḥ Anṭūn’s critique of Islam during his  3 See, for instance, al-Manār, vol. 6/6 (Rabīʿ al-ʾAwwal 1321/June 1903), pp. 217- 223; vol. 6/7, (Rabīʿ al-Thānī 1321/June 1903), pp. 252-255; vol. 6/8, pp. 294-298; vol.  6/9 (Jumāda al-ʾŪlā 1321/July 1903), pp. 330-335; vol. 6/12 (Jumāda al-Thāniya 1321/ September 1903), pp. 457-461. 4 For more details, see al-Manār, vol. 7/1 (Muḥarram 1322/March 1904),  pp. 17-27; vol. 7/2 (Ṣafar 1322/April 1904), pp. 94-100; vol. 7/6, pp. 225-231. </page> <page sequence="3"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 177 above-mentioned debate with ʿAbduh (see, chapter 2). In these arti- cles, Riḍā clearly put Anṭūn on an equal footing with missionaries  by arguing that when the editor of al-Jāmiʿa saw the failure of evan- gelists in converting Muslims through purely religious methods, he  embarked upon planting doubts in their minds through what he  claimed to be scientific methods. He therefore exerted his effort to  convince them: 1) that their religion, like other religions, is the enemy  of reason and knowledge, 2) that their scholastic theologians denied  causes; and 3) that the combining of religious and civil political  authority in the office of the Caliph harms Muslims, causing their  social retardation.’5 4.1. A Muslim Doubting the Authenticity of the Qurʾān It might be interesting to know that in 1903 a certain ʿAbdullāh  Naṣūḥī, one of al-Manār’s readers from Alexandria, asked Riḍā to  discontinue publishing the section of the Shubuhāt, which, in his  view, had become a platform for the publicity of missionary allega- tions. According to Naṣūḥī, no Muslim would have ever known about  their publications, had al-Manār not published regular sections rebut- ting their ideas. The reader also believed that missionary treatises and  magazines were only read by the Christians themselves.6 Riḍā replied  that the editors of these publications frequently sent their magazine  to the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar and other Muslim scholars, who  took no initiative to respond to their contentions. He found it incum- bent upon Muslims to counter their writings, otherwise they would  be held sinful.7 Another Egyptian subscriber informed al-Manār that  one of his friends converted to Christianity only as a result of reading  these missionary critiques of Islam.8 When Riḍā decided to cease  publishing the section of the Shubuhāt in 1904, the judge of Bahrain  encouraged him to resume his refutations, describing al-Manār as a  ‘shooting star burning the devils, and tearing down their allegations.’9 5 As translated by Wood, op  cit., p. 198. 6 Al-Manār, vol. 6/11 (Jumādā al-Thānya 1321 /August 1903), pp. 425-427.

Riḍā made it clear that he felt obliged to  become directly involved in discussing these issues, although he was  always keen on a peaceful attitude in his journal towards other reli- gions, including Christianity. He stressed that al-Manār’s policy was  neither to inflame the animosity between different religious groups,  nor to invite people to defame each other’s belief, but missionaries  were constantly attacking Islam.10  Riḍā was surprised that the Muslim writer had read missionary  works, but had not tried to study any Muslim works in response to  them, such as Iẓhār al-Ḥaqq or al-Sayf al-Ṣaqīl.11 The doubts, which  had emerged in his mind, were: 1) the divergence of some Islamic  texts from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures; 2) the silence of these  Scriptures about many points which had been later mentioned in the  Qurʾān; and 3) the fact that many things mentioned in the Ḥadīth  and the Qurʾān contradict actual reality or the truths already estab- lished by modern sciences. Riḍā argued that silence about something is not the same as its  denial. It is not reasonable that one would believe in the divine mes- sage of Islam on the basis of what the authors of Jewish and Christian  Scriptures (whom Riḍā named muʾarrikhūn ‘historians’) had men- tioned or neglected. The Muslim writer used the frequent mis-  sionary argument, which attempted to prove the genuineness of the  Old and New Testament on the basis of the Qurʾān. In this sense, he  10 First article, ‘Shubuhāt al-Masīḥiyyīn ʿalā al-ʾIslam,’ al-Manār, vol. 4/5  (Muḥarram 1319 /May 1901), pp. 179-183. 11 Umar Tamīmī al-Dārī and Muḥammad Zakī Sanad, Kitāb al-Sayf al-Ṣaqīl fī  al-Radd ʿalā Risālat al-Burhān al-Jalīl (The Polished Sword in Response to al-Burhān  al-Jalīl), Cairo, 1895. It was a response to al-Burhān al-Jalīl ʿalā Siḥḥat al-Tawrāh wa  al-Injīl (The Glorious Proof on the Reliability of the Old and New Testament), which  was written by Rev. F. A. Klein, and was translated and published by The Church  Missionary Society (CMS) in Jerusalem in 1893. The Burhān generated many Muslim  works.

The Egyptian scholar Muṣṭafā al-Rifāʿī al-Labbān  also wrote a response to a missionary treatise dealing with the same subject under the  title: Mawqif al-ʾIslām min Kutub al-Yahūd wā al-Naṣārā (The Positions of Islam  towards the Scriptures of the Jews and Christians), Cairo: al-Maṭbaʿa al-Salafiyya,  1353/ 1934-1935. </page> <page sequence="5"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 179 further argued that the Qurʾān made a declaration of truth of the  revelation of the Bible; but if the revelation of the Bible were proved  to be false in some points, would the testimony of the Qurʾān for false  Scriptures bring the authenticity of the Qurʾān itself also into  suspicion?!12  In his reply, Riḍā maintained that the Qurʾān has testified to the  Torah as a book of laws and precepts, not as a book of history bor- rowed from Assyrian and Chaldean mythologies. These mythologies  were proved to contradict the sciences of geology and archeology.  For example, it had been proved that serpents do not eat earth in  contradiction of God’s command in the Torah for the serpent: ‘and  dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life’ (Genesis 3:14).13 The Qurʾān  therefore bore witness to the authenticity of the Torah, as a book of  legislation (al-Māʾida 5:44),14 but did not give any testimony for other  historical books, such as those of unknown authors and those that  had been written centuries after Moses. In Riḍā’s view, any historical  analogy between the Qurʾān and other Biblical books, such as Isaiah,  Ezekiel or Daniel was baseless, since the Qurʾān had never born wit- ness to them. He asked the writer not to be dazzled by the claims of  the Christians that all the books mentioned in the Old Testament  were parts of the original Torah.15 As for the New Testament, Muslims  should believe that it was a revelation which included religious exhor- tations, rulings and wisdom about Jesus. All other books of the New  Testament were nothing but a part of history, and in the same way  as the Torah, they had been written down many years after Jesus’  death with no asānīd (chains of transmission). The Qurʾān had testi- fied that the Christians did not preserve all parts of the revelation  about Jesus (Al-Mā ʾida 5:14).16  Riḍā added that the Qurʾān also rebuked the Christians and the  Jews for having mixed the original Bible with other historical stories.  Thus, Riḍā argued, Muslims have no definitive criteria to distinguish  parts originally revealed from other parts. However, Muslims hold  12 A-Manār, vol. 4/5, p. 80. 13 Ibid., p. 181 14 ‘It is we who revealed the Law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its  standard have been judged the Jews, by Prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to God’s  will, by the Rabbis and the Doctors of Law.’ 15 Wood, op  cit., p. 95 16 ‘Lo! We are Christians, We made a covenant, but they forgot a part of that  whereof they were admonished.’ </page> <page sequence="6"> 180 chapter four the books of Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy and Leviticus as parts  of the original Torah. Riḍā also favoured the Sermon of Jesus on the  Mount, and other sermons according to the Gospel of Matthew (chap- ters 5, 6 and 7), as parts of the original Gospel.17 Nevertheless, he  made it clear that any report that might contradict the Qurʾān in these  books must be totally rejected, since ‘God speaks truthfully, whereas  historians lie.’18  At the end, Riḍā requested the writer to visit him in his office, if  his written answers were not sufficient. One month later, Riḍā stated  that he decided to stop publishing on the subject, after the writer  visited him in his office and was convinced by his answers.19 4.2. Researches of the Diligent Very soon Riḍā started to publish his replies against Christian writ- ings once again. As we have mentioned (see introduction), his early  replies were directed to the missionary treatise written by the Egyptian  Niqūlā Yaʿqūb Ghabriyāl. Riḍā held Christian writers responsible for  attacking Islam. He felt compelled to react, even though he was still  seeking harmony among different religious groups in society.20 It was  Ghabriyāl’s ‘unfavourable judgment’ of Islam that made him return  to polemics  The author tried to prove the authenticity of the Bible  as based on Qurʾānic passages. It was also a direct message to Muslims  to ‘share with the Christians their salvation and the eternal life, which  they have acquired through Jesus.’21  Riḍā evaluated the method of Ghabriyāl’s Researches as ‘decent,’  as it did not contain any ‘profanity’ against Islam as compared to  other missionary works. Ghabriyāl personally gave a copy of his book  to Riḍā, and requested him to give feedback in al-Manār. The above- 17 Leirvik wrongly stated that Riḍā criticised the Sermon on the Mount as naïve.  Leirvik, Images, p. 141. The Sermon on the Mount was a common stock of Gospel  materials widely known in Muslim literature, see, T. Khalidi, The Muslim Jesus: Say- ings and Stories in Islamic Literature, Harvard University Press, 2001, p. 33.  18 Wood, op  cit., p. 96. 19 Al-Manār, vol. 4/7 (Ṣafar 1319/June 1901), p. 280 20 Al-Manār, vol. 4/10 (Rabīʿ al-Thānī 1319 /July 1901), pp. 379-380. In al-Manār,  Riḍā titled the article as: ‘Shubuhāt al-Tārīkh ʿalā al-Yahūdiyya wā al-Naṣrāniyya  (Doubts of History about Judaism and Christianity).’ In the collection of articles he  subtitled it as: ‘Muwāzana bayna al-ʾAnbiyāʾ al-Thalāthah (Comparison among the  Three Prophets).’ 21 Ghabriyāl, op  cit., p. 3. </page> <page sequence="7"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 181 mentioned Salīm Pasha al-Ḥamawī, a Syrian Greek Orthodox and a  friend of Riḍā, reviewed the book in his newspaper al-Falāḥ, and  asked Riḍā to respond to it as well. Other missionary friends of  Ghabriyāl made the same request to Riḍā. In the beginning, Riḍā  expressed his hesitation, stating that ‘the mujādāla (debate or polem- ics) is the job of those who live by it: ‘as the seller seeks a buyer, the  debater seeks another debater.’22 Riḍā was worried that he would not  be able to respond to the issues mentioned by Ghabriyāl without  exceeding his boundaries and attacking Christianity. As a result, the  authors of such works would charge him with religious fanaticism.  For him, the lucidity of Islam would need no defender.’23 4.2.1. Three Prophets: Historical Doubts about Judaism and  Christianity Riḍā argued with Ghabriyāl that anyone who studied the Scriptures  of the three religions and the biographies of their narrators would  definitely reach the conclusion that Islam was the most ‘obvious’ and  ‘soundest’ one. Once he had a conversation with a Christian historian,  whom he described as ‘not fanatically disposed towards one religion  over another.’ They imposed upon themselves the hypothetical condi- tion that they did not believe in any religion in order to define who  the greatest man in history was. Riḍā nominated Muḥammad, while  the historian’s choice went to Moses and Jesus. They agreed that the  three of them were the greatest and most influential in history, but  did not agree on the criteria that made them greatest in terms of  status and historical influence.24 22 Al-Manār, vol. 4/10, p. 380. Other contemporary Muslim scholars also refuted  Ghabriyāl’s treatise. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Saʿīd al-Baghdādī (d. 1911), the Iraqi head  of the Commercial Court in Baghdad, systematically responded to its nine chapters.  Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Saʿīd Baghdādī, (Bajah Ji Zadah), al-Fāriq bayna al-Makhlūq wā  al-Khāliq, Cairo, 1904, pp. 31-83. The book was published in Cairo three years after  the appearance of Riḍā’s articles in al-Manār. Ghabriyāl’s work was, in his view, noth- ing but a ‘camouflage,’ which would swindle the fair-minded Christians and convince  them with the authenticity of their Scriptures. In order to discover the deception of  its author, Baghdādī advised his readers, Christians or not, to purchase a copy of  Ghabriyāl’s work, and put it beside him while reading his refutation. On the margin  of Baghdādī’s work, the author included al-Qarāfī’s al-Ajwiba al-Fākhira and Ibn  al-Qayyim’s Hidāyat al-Ḥayārā  23 Ibid. 24 Ibid. Cf. Wood, op  cit., p. 99 </page> <page sequence="8"> 182 chapter four As for Moses, Riḍā maintained that he was brought up under the  custody of the ‘greatest king’ of his time. In the court of the Pharaoh,  Moses grew up in the ‘cradle’ of royalty and power, and therefore  became imbued with love of rule and authority. He witnessed the  civilised world of Egypt, the universal sciences, Funūn al-Ṣināʿa (arts  of industry) and magic. He grew up in the shadow of the Egyptian  laws. The pride of the monarchy made him valiant. He turned against  the Pharaoh, as he was conscious of the weakness and humiliation  of the Children of Israel as a disgraced nation under the Pharaoh. He  sought the partisan support (ʿAṣabiyya) of his people, and attempted  to establish a kingdom like the one under which he grew up. He  rebelled against the Pharaoh by using this ʿAṣabiyya. Riḍā did not  consider Moses’ miracle of the passing of the sea to have been a mat- ter of magic or supernatural power. Some historians stated that the  Children of Israel had crossed the sea at a shallow point at the end  of the tide’s ebb. When the Pharaoh and his people tried to cross,  they drowned due to the incoming tide. Riḍā did not mention any  historian by name. Here he alluded to theories like those of the  Hellenistic Jewish historian Artapanus who pointed to the ebb as a  possible explanation.25 Riḍā compared the story to what, according  to him, happened to the French political leader Napoleon Bonaparte  (d. 1821) and his soldiers on their way back to the Egyptian shore,  when they tried to cross the Red Sea at the time of the tide’s ebb; and  the water began to rise. This made their return very difficult. Bonaparte  commanded his soldiers to get hold of each other till they were over- powered by the strength of the rising water.26 All other miracles attrib- uted to Moses were, in Riḍā’s view, dubious in regard to their  transmission, and of doubtful understanding.27 As for Jesus, Riḍā described him as a Jewish man who was brought  up under the Mosaic laws, who was judging according to the Roman  25 Artapanus explained the crossing of the sea by Moses and the Israelites as a  consequence of Moses’ familiarity with the natural phenomena of the area. See, for  instance, Stanislav Segert, ‘Crossing the Waters: Moses and Hamilcar,’ Journal of Near  Eastern Studies 53/3, 1994, pp. 195-203. 26 Riḍā did not give this rationalist interpretation in his commentary on the  Qurʾānic passages related to this story. He rendered stretching the sea for Moses to be  a miraculous act caused by the divine providence. He gave his interpretation in light  of Biblical narratives. He only quoted the story as mentioned in Exodus 13 and 14,  which he considered to be a proper exegesis for the Qurʾānic story. See, Tafsīr  Al-Manār, Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1999, vol. 9, pp. 91-92.  27 Al-Manār, vol. 4/10, p. 381. </page> <page sequence="9"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 183 code, and who had read Greek philosophy. Therefore, he was well  acquainted with the three great civilisations and their sciences; and  was not keen on establishing a new law or nation. Riḍā also suggested  that Jesus, as an eloquent preacher, had some knowledge of Greek  philosophy of life, such as asceticism, which had been clearly expressed  in the renunciation of worldly pleasures and the humiliation of the  body for the sake of the soul and the entering of the Kingdom of the  Heavens.28 Some of the zealous poor followed him, as they found in  his mission consolation and comfort. Riḍā argued that these followers  embarked on reporting miraculous stories, just as common Muslims  attribute miraculous acts to Muslim Ṣūfīs. In his interpretation of the  clash of his arguments with the Qurʾānic reports of the miraculous  acts attributed to Jesus, such as his fatherless birth, Riḍā maintained  that it was a claim that could never be proven, except after establish- ing the rational evidence of the authenticity of Islam.29 As compared to Moses, Riḍā saw that Jesus in many aspects did  not accomplish noteworthy achievements regarding science, social  reform or civilisation. His sermons and exhortations, however, led  to the demolition of civilisations, the ruining of prosperity, and the  decline of humankind from its highest degrees to the lowest depth  of animal existence. The sermons of Jesus would lift up human souls  in humiliation and humbleness, encouraging people to discard any  flourishing or progressive development in the world. Riḍā mentioned  in that regard examples, such as: ‘It is easier for a camel to go through  the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of  God’ (Matthew, 19:24). He added that the doctrine of Crucifixion  also allowed ‘permissiveness,’ since it taught the believers that any  sin was forgiven through it. Riḍā concluded that the teachings of  Christianity were derived from paganism and that it ‘relinquished  any light [produced by reflection].’ He attempted to refute the claim  that Western civilisation was based on Christianity. A civilisation  based on materialism, love of money and authority, arrogance and  the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, does not match with the spirit  of Christian asceticism. He strongly believed that the West reached  its civilisation only after it had entirely abandoned Christian  teachings.30  28 Ibid., p. 382. 29 Ibid., pp. 382-83. 30 Ibid.,p. 383. </page> <page sequence="10"> 184 chapter four After having mentioned all these points, Riḍā reached his conclu- sion of the preference of the Prophet of Islam in human history. The  Prophet Muḥammad was born as an orphan, and was raised up in a  nation of paganism, illiteracy and ignorance; one lacking laws, civili- sation, national unity, knowledge or craft. The highest degree of devel- opment attained in his time was that a group of people, who, due to  their dealings with other tribes, had learnt to read and write. Neither  he nor any of his followers was included in this group. However, he  was capable of founding a nation, religion, law, kingdom and civilisa- tion in an unprecedented short period of time.31  Riḍā’s counterpart in the discussion conceded that it was true that  Muḥammad was the greatest man in history, but the sad status of  Muslims nowadays was not compatible with the teachings of his reli- gion. Riḍā answered that the Islamic civilisation declined when  Muslims abandoned their religion. The so-called Western civilisation,  on the other hand, began to exist after having come into contact with  Muslims in Spain. The more the West puts Christianity aside, the  more it advances. Riḍā’s Christian counterpart considered this answer  to be an exaggerated statement.32 At the end, Riḍā returned to the Qurʾānic narration of the miracles  of prophets. For him, the Qurʾānic narrative should be given prepon- derance as divine revelation above all historical probabilities. He  argued that the authenticity of any religion should be proven through  supernatural acts, which are reported on the authority of its lawgiver.  Riḍā favoured the Muslim reports as the most reliable for many rea- sons. First of all, knowledge and oral transmissions were known since  the first century of Islam. It is not historically established that Muslims  were conquered by an enemy, who burnt their books or demolished  their entire religion and history. They were never persecuted nor  obliged to conceal their belief and in the course of secrecy invent  stories. Unlike other religions, Muslims initiated the science of Tārīkh  al-Rijāl (Biography of Men) with which they examined the authentic- ity of narratives by means of studying their narrators.  31 Ibid. 32 Ibid., p. 384. </page> <page sequence="11"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 185 4.2.2. Islam &amp; Christianity: Three Goals of Religion In a following article, Riḍā rebuked missionaries for their insistence  on inviting Muslims to deny the divine message of one of the three  prophets, notwithstanding that his mission was established on the  strongest rational proofs. He proposed a comparison between  Christianity and Islam in the light of three general objectives that  every religion should have: 1) soundness of doctrines, leading to the  perfection of the human mind; 2) cultivation of morality leading to  the perfection of the soul; and 3) the goodness of acts facilitating  welfare and interests of human beings, therefore leading to the per- fection of the body. This composition would demonstrate which one  of the two religions really realised these goals, and deserved to be  followed.33 With regard to the first aspect, Riḍā argued that Muslims agreed  that beliefs should be derived from clear-cut proofs. Any sensible  person would definitely judge the doctrines of Islam as sound. He  did not agree with the author of the Researches that ‘no one would  grasp the essence of the divine entity except God Himself, as Muslims  and others agree.’ Riḍā made a distinction between what the reason  would prove on the basis of evidence without knowing its deepest  entity, and what it would declare as impossible to know. Reason how- ever did not attain knowledge of the true nature of any of the created  things, but it comprehended external appearances and attributes. The  Torah, in Riḍā’s perspective, ascribed to God irrational attributes.  Depending on early Islamic polemics, Riḍā maintained that telling  about God in the Torah that God ‘repented,’ ‘grieved,’ or ‘plotted  to destroy man’ (Genesis, 6:6-7) indicates that He was ignorant and  incapable.34  As for the second objective, Riḍā maintained that the Islamic teach- ings were the most adequate and perfect, as they were standing upon  the foundations of justice and moderation. He wrote that the Christian  teachings, on other hand, were based on ‘excess’ and ‘exaggeration.’  He referred to verses such as, ‘Love your enemies, bless them that  33 Al-Manār, vol. 4/11 (Jumādā al-ʾŪlā 1319 /August 1901), pp. 411-417; Wood,  op  cit., p. 109. 34 Al-Manār, vol. 4/11, p. 412, Wood, ibid., p. 112.

These verses convinced him that its core message was a kind of excess  in love, which human nature cannot stand.  In terms of the third objective, Riḍā argued that good deeds pro- mote the human being spiritually and bodily, and in that sense all  acts of worship in Islam are connected to a value. Prayer, for example,  is obligated to prevent Faḥshāʾ (lewdness) and Munkar (reprehensible  acts). He contended that it is hard to find these meanings of worship  in other scriptures. Worship in the Torah is substantiated only for  the sake of ‘worldly fortunes.’ For instance, feasts in the Bible were  only justified as a season of gathering, harvest, and agriculture  (Exodus, 23: 14-16). The same holds true for his understanding of  the Islamic precepts of transactions, which ‘treat Muslims and non- Muslims equally.’ Riḍā attempted to compare some of these Islamic  precepts with their Biblical counterparts. He quoted that the Torah  stipulates ‘thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour’  (Exodus, 20: 16), while the Qurʾānic concept of giving one’s testimony  demands believers to ‘stand firmly for justice and not be biased even  against oneself, parents, kin, rich or poor’ (al-Māʾida, 4:135). Riḍā  further alleged that, unlike the Bible, the Qurʾān combines both faith  and good deeds. Riḍā selected many Biblical examples to prove his  point. In his Epistle to the Romans, Paul, for example, made it clear:  ‘Now to one who works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of  debt. But to him that works not, but believeth in him that justifies  the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness’ (4:4-5).35  4.2.3. Judaism &amp; Christianity Derived from Paganism? In this part, Riḍā harshly criticised the Judeo-Christian Scriptures as  being rehashed from pagan ideas.36 In his view, the only means to  avoid what he considered as the ‘objections’ of Western scholars and  historians against the authenticity of the Scriptures was to adhere to  Muslim belief by admitting the ‘corruption’ of many parts of them.  Here he quoted the famous fictional work ʿAlam al-Dīn (The Banner  of Religion) by ʿAlī Pasha Mubārak (1823-1893), an Egyptian former  35 Ibid., p. 417. Other examples are: Galatians 3:10-13, Mathew 5:17, Acts 15:  28-29, and Ezekiel 20: 23. 36 Al-Manār, vol. 4/12, pp. 448-453. </page> <page sequence="13"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 187 minister of education.37 The four-volume book described a journey  to France by an Azharite Sheikh (named ʿAlam al-Dīn) and a British  orientalist, who hired him for Arabic lessons. When the Sheikh trav- eled with his English student to France, his view of the East and West  drastically changed. As it was written for educative reasons, the novel  contained accounts of the discussions between both men on various  fields, such as geography, physics, zoology, religion, and intellectual  schools. Riḍā was impressed by such works.38 In the Shubuhāt, Riḍā quoted from Mubārak’s work an imaginary  conversation between Sheikh ʿAlam al-Dīn and a French philosopher,  who visited Egypt during Napoleon’s campaign, on the relation  between Islam and Christianity, and on other issues related to the  Bible.39 The orientalist was the interpreter, and introduced the French  philosopher as one of the well-versed scholars in the field of theology.  The philosopher was said to believe that ‘the Old Testament is com- posed, and not one of the heavenly-divine books.’ Mubārak men- tioned that the philosopher relied on the statements of a person to  whom he referred as ‘Mary Augustus’ and ‘Origen.’ He was probably  referring to the church father St. Aurelius Augustine (AD 353-430)  and to Origenes Adamantius (probably AD 185-254). Mubārak main- tained that Augustine would argue that it was not possible that the  first three chapters [of Genesis] would have remained in the same  form.40 In his work, Mubārak maintained:  Origen also believed that what is mentioned in the Torah pertaining to  the creation of the world was legendary [...] the word Hebrew word  Barrāh—fatḥa on the b, doubling of the r and sukūn on the h—would  actually mean ‘arrange’ and ‘order.’ It was not possible for anyone to  ‘arrange’ or ‘order’ something that did not really exist. Thus the appli- cation of this word to the creation of the world required that the mate- rial substance of the world was pre-existent and eternal; and the time  37 ʿAlī Mubārak, ʿAlam al-Dīn, Alexandria: al-Maḥrūsa Newspaper Press, 4 vols,  1299/1883.

Insofar as the substance was living, the soul  was eternal as well, since it was the cause of life. As the substance is  light, heat, power, motion, gravity and balance, both life and the sub- stance were one thing, which is contradictory to the Torah41  There is no evidence that Mubārak had a good command of the  Hebrew language. He did not mention any source on which he  depended in the argument. Reading the general lines of the two  ancient Christian writers on the creation narrative in the Book of  Genesis, we find their theories more sophisticated than the way they  are introduced by Mubārak. Augustine, born of a Christian mother  and a pagan father, firstly attempted to expound the creation narra- tive in his commentary: De Genesi contra Manichaeos libri duo (388).42  He tried to discover the literal meaning of every statement in the text  of Genesis; but when he found that impossible, he resorted to an  allegorical interpretation.43 The first three chapters of Genesis con- tained a narrative of another sort as compared to those from the  fourth chapter onwards which obviously contained a historical nar- rative. The first chapters were unfamiliar because they were unique.  But that, according to Augustine, did not justify one in concluding  that the events did not happen.44 Origen’s approach to cosmology  was philosophical rather than theological. He believed that the Bible  was divinely revealed, which was established both by the fulfilment  of prophecy, and by the direct impression which the Scriptures made  on him who read them.45  Returning to Riḍā’s quotation from ʿAlam al-Dīn, the author com- pared some Biblical notions and events with similar ones in ancient  traditions. For example, the Biblical story of creation in six days  resembles that of the six ages of the Hindus, as well as the six  41 Ibid.; compare Wood’s translation. 42 He wrote his work as a refutation to the Manichees who ‘completely reject [the  Old Testament] with impious scorn.’ See, St  Augustine: The Literal Meaning of Gen- esis, trans. and annotated by John Hammond Taylor, S.J., 2 vols., New York N.

The philosopher, more- over, criticised the Old Testament as containing ‘inappropriate’ things  attributed to the Prophets, such as fratricide, adultery, and theft. In  the same manner, the author turned to draw analogies between  Christian doctrines and ancient Pagan cultures. Examples of these  were the incarnation of God into a human body and the virginal  birth, which had occurred according to Indian, Chinese and Egyptian  ancient cults. The ancient Egyptians, for instance, believed that Osiris  was virgin-born. The Christian doctrine that Jesus died, was buried,  resurrected and elevated to heaven resembled the statements of  ancient Egyptians about Osiris and the Greeks about the cult figure  Adonis. Also it was said that the Germanic God Odin had sacrificed  himself, killing himself of his own choice by throwing himself in a  terrible fire until he burnt for the salvation of his worshippers.46  Riḍā argued that because Western people (especially scholars and  philosophers) became skeptical about Christianity, some governments  (such as in France) started to declare that their states had no official  religion.47 Those philosophers and scholars, he went on, were still  convinced that religion was necessary for humankind. Riḍā believed  that the ‘truth’ of Islam, as the religion of the Fiṭra (the innate dis- position), was concealed away from those scholars. Therefore some  of them produced a poor translation of the Qurʾān which did not  enable people to understand the truth of Islam.48 In Riḍā’s view, the  Russian and Spanish people persisted to be the strongest advocates  of Christianity. However, the Spaniards recently suppressed their  clergy. The Orthodox Church of Russia excommunicated its philoso- pher Tolstoy for his rejection of their doctrines. Riḍā was aware of  the ‘westernised’ group of Muslims, who followed the path of these  46 Wood, op  cit., pp. 121-122.

In a generalisation he  stated that these individuals never studied Islam properly, either  before their studying of European thought or after.49 4.2.4. Qurʾānic Proofs for the Genuineness of the Bible  As we have already mentioned, it was typical of the missionary writ- ings to prove the authenticity of the Bible on the basis of the Qurʾānic  testimony to it as a divinely-revealed book. In his Researches, Ghabriyāl  cited seven Qurʾānic verses discussing the character of the Bible. Riḍā  ridiculed this method, and ironically named the whole book Abḥāth  al-Jadaliyyīn ‘the Researches of the Disputants’ instead of the Diligent.  He also accused the author of trying to ‘twist the meanings [of the  Qurʾān] in the same way as his ancestors did with the Old and New  Testament.’50 It was, in his view, Paul who rendered the laws of the  Old and New Testament worthless, and made Christianity permissive  attaching no good values to any good act by requesting people to  believe in the salvation of Jesus only. By this Riḍā thought along a  similar line with many Muslim polemicists who saw Paul as a ‘cun- ning and roguish Jew [...] who emancipated himself from the religious  practices of Jesus and accepted those of the Romans.’51 Riḍā called  down ‘shame’ and ‘denigration’ on Christian missionaries because  they preached that ‘this Jewish man [Paul]’ could invalidate both the  laws of Moses and Jesus, whereas they refused the message of  Muḥammad, which came as confirmation of the divine message of  both prophets.52  In Riḍā’s understanding, the missionary argument of proving the  authenticity of the Bible from the Qurʾān was a ‘quotation out of  context’ in order to distort the Qurʾān’s real meaning. The Old and  New Testament were earlier ‘guidance for humanity,’ but after their  followers deviated from its ‘true’ message and went astray, the texts  had undergone alteration. Riḍā’s premise did not go further than his  pure conviction that Islam had later brought ‘the greatest guidance’  and ‘glorious evidence.’ If the People of the Book believed in it, they  49 Ibid., p. 125. 50 Al-Manār, vol. 4/14 (Jumādā al-ʾĀkhira 1319/September 1901), p. 538. 51 See, S.

Riḍā maintained that the verse  did not indicate any command that the Prophet Muḥammad should  submit to the percepts of the Bible. The author, in Riḍā’s words,  sought to furnish any corroborating evidence by misconstruing the  verse in a way that would support his desire, and would also corrupt  the Qurʾān as they did with their own Scriptures. The verse pertained  to the statement in the preceding verse: ‘We sent him [Jesus] the  Gospel; therein was guidance and light’ (5:46). This means that God  gave him the Gospel and ordered his people (the Israelites) to act  accordingly. Riḍā understood the verse as a proof and objection  against the Christians themselves that they did not act according to  the Gospel. He concluded that ‘if it is possible for the Christian evan- gelists today to argue against Muslims that the Qurʾān commands  them to believe and act according to the Old and New Testament  and not see that this argument mandates their faith in the Qurʾān,  then how can they assert that Muḥammad’s request to them to judge  by the Gospel would mandate that he submitted to its ordinances?’55 Ghabriyāl argued that the Qurʾān confirmed that it would be an  error for a Muslim not to believe in the Old and New Testament. He  cited the verse admonishing the Muslims to believe in the preceding  Scriptures (al-Nisā, 4: 136).56 Riḍā immediately replied that the  Muslim is required to believe in the previous Scriptures, but is never  obligated to act according to their laws. According to Muslim exe- getes, he argued, the verse was addressing the hypocrites (munāfiqūn),  53 Ibid., p. 539. 54 Ibid., pp. 538-39. 55 Ibid., p. 539.

Riḍā paraphrased the verse: ‘O you who profess faith in God, His  Book and his Messengers’—with their tongues and outwardly—‘it is  incumbent upon you to believe in them with your hearts and bring  your outward profession to congruity with what you hold inwardly.’57 In Ghabriyāl’s view, the people of Mecca knew the Old and New  Testament in the same manner they knew the Qurʾān. He cited the  verse ‘And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qurʾān  nor in that which was before it’ (Sabaʾ, 34:31). He interpreted the  Arabic phrase, bayna yadayhi (lit. between his hands), as ‘before it.’  This means that the verse directly refers to ‘the Old and New  Testament.’ Riḍā rejected this interpretation by arguing that it pointed  to the rejection by the people of Mecca of the Qurʾān and its prophet.  Riḍā again paraphrased the verse that the premise of the people of  Mecca was to say: ‘we do neither believe in you Muḥammad and the  book you claim from God, nor in the Scriptures you claim to have  been revealed before you.’ He argued that the verse neither indicated  that the ‘illiterate’ inhabitants of Mecca during the time of the revela- tion knew the Old and New Testament, nor did it give any connota- tion that they specifically studied them. Only a few people among  them were able to read and write well (Riḍā counted them as six  individuals). However, Riḍā gave his preference to another exegetical  interpretation: the phrase ‘bayna yadayhi’ referred to the Day of  Judgment, not to the preceding Scriptures.58 Ghabriyāl’s following argument was that the Prophet himself veri- fied the authenticity of the Scriptures and put them on an equal foot- ing with the Qurʾān, as has been stated by the Qurʾān itself: ‘Say (to  them Muḥammad): ‘then bring a Book, which gives a clearer guidance  than these two, that I may follow.’59 The pronoun in minhumā (than  these two), according to Ghabriyāl, refers to the Qurʾān and the  Gospel. For Riḍā, this quotation was mentioned by Ghabriyāl out of  his ‘dishonesty’ and an ‘alteration’ of the real meaning of the verse  by not giving any reference to its previous passages. In his exegetical  view, Riḍā considered the mention of Moses in the preceding verses  as an indication that the verse referred to the Qurʾān and the Torah,  57 Wood, op  cit., p. 133. 58 Al-Manār, vol. 4/15, p. 577. 59 Al-Qaṣaṣ (28: 49). </page> <page sequence="19"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 193 but not to the Gospel.60 But this interpretation, in Riḍā’s view, does  not indicate any approval that the Qurʾān recognised the Torah as  equal in all aspects, nor the revelation to Muḥammad as equivalent  to that to Moses. The verse pointed to the inability of the people of  Mecca to produce a book similar to the Scriptures brought by Moses  and Muḥammad, but it did not necessarily imply that the former was  equivalent to the latter. As an example, Riḍā compared the case of  the Qurʾān and the Torah with two works on the science of logic:  ‘Were it said to an individual, ignorant of the science of logic [...],  ‘Write me a book that is better than the book Isagoge [of Porphyry],  and al-Baṣāʾir al-Nuṣayriyyaʾ,61 would we say that this statement dem- onstrates that the two books are equal in every aspect?’62 Lastly, Ghabriyāl cited the verse indicating that the Torah con- tained God’s ordinance or command (al-Māʾida, 5:43). The verse was  therefore a clear substantiation that the Torah was not twisted and  that there was no need to follow any other law. Riḍā pointed out that  the reason for the revelation of that verse was that a group of Jews  intended to escape the punishment of stoning by asking the Prophet  to be an arbitrator in a case of adultery committed by a highborn  person among them, hoping that he would decide to flog the adulterer.  Riḍā argued that the verse elucidated astonishment about the lack of  confidence of the Jews in their religion by rejecting its judgement and  yielding to another legislator. It was also amazing that they rejected  the Prophet’s judgement, which was in agreement with their own law.  Their lack of confidence was also extended to the message of Islam  60 Riḍā supported his argument by referring to the preceding verses: ‘If (we had)  not (sent thee to the Quraysh)—in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds)  that their hands have sent forth, they might say: ‘O Lord! Why didst Thou not send  us a messenger? We should then have followed the signs and been amongst Those who  believe’! But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, ‘Why  are not (signs) sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses? Do they not then  reject (the signs) which were formerly sent to Moses? They say: ‘Two kinds of sorcery,  each assisting the other and they say: ‘For us, we reject all (such things).’ (Al-Qaṣaṣ,  28: 47-48). 61 Al-Baṣāʾir al-Nuṣayriyya fī ʿIlm al-Manṭiq was written by Zayn al-Dīn ʿUmar b.

He argued that the book of al-Sīra  al-Ḥalabiyya,64 for instance, might contain the ‘Command of God,’  but this did not mean that it was secure from corruption. It had also  included the personal views of the author.65 4.2.5. Books of the Old and New Testament  Ghabriyāl devoted the second chapter of his book to discuss what he  believed to be a rational proof of the authenticity of the Bible.66 For  him, God was omnipotent and wise to stipulate a constitution and  to prescribe a law for human beings in order that they should comply  with specific duties towards their Maker. The law regulated relation- ship among them, otherwise life would be in chaos with no deterrent  or restrain. The people would also annihilate each other, and the good  would be on equal footing with the evil, something God would never  accept.67 Ghabriyāl challenged Muslims: ‘if that constitution and law  were not the Old and New Testament, would you tell me what are  they? Is there any other ancient holy book that accomplishes the same  objective, as do the two Testaments?’68 Riḍā had a low opinion of the logic behind the argument of his  opponent. He wondered why God had left humanity without a law  for thousands of years before the Torah, and why this wisdom of His  had not appeared except recently in the case of the Israelites. These  question marks were enough for Riḍā to refute Ghabriyāl’s arguments.  Muslims, on the other hand, believed that God sent down innumer- able messengers and prophets to all nations.69 He also contended that  the people of China were not like ‘cattle’ trampling each other, or  like ‘fish,’ the big eating the small with no restrain.

They were even more advanced than the Israelites in  science, culture and order. Riḍā added that they were more advanced  than the Christians themselves whose religion advanced them in noth- ing but animosity, hatred, disagreement, discord, war and murder  during the so-called ‘Dark Ages,’ while the Chinese lived in peace  and harmony. The same was true for the Hindus. He argued that  there is no harm for Muslims to believe that the Chinese religion and  Hinduism were of divine origin, just as Judaism, Christianity and  Islam. It is not forbidden to believe that God had sent down mes- sengers for those people in order to guide them to ‘eternal happiness.’  But they intermingled their religions with inherited pagan tendencies,  the same as the Christians did with their originally divine and mono- theistic religion.70  Riḍā believed that when the Europeans replaced the law of the Old  Testament with positive laws, and the customs of the Old and New  Testament with philosophy, they discarded ‘asceticism’ and ‘shook  the dust of humiliation off their heads.’71 By this the Europeans  achieved more progress than during the time when they firmly fol- lowed the Bible. Riḍā believed at this time that in their good manners  the Europeans were the closest people to Islam. These morals included  their attachment to ‘pride, high motivation, seriousness in work, hon- esty, trustworthiness, and seeking knowledge according to the uni- versal laws and abiding by rationality.’72 Riḍā was persuaded that  Ghabriyāl’s statement about the effect of the cultivation of the divine  laws on human beings was only evident in the case of Muslims, rather  than that of the Jews and the Christians. Historically, when Muslims  faithfully fulfilled their duties towards God and the people, they  became refined, their morals became cultivated and their civilisation  advanced.73 Riḍā ironically wondered if the needs of people were really  to be fulfilled solely by the revelation of the Torah, why God would  send down the Gospel on Jesus? However, this problem was not per- tinent to Muslims, as they believed in the genuineness of the origin  of the Bible.74 70 Ibid., p. 656. 71 Wood, op  cit., p. 153. 72 Al-Manār, vol. 4/17, p. 656. 73 Ibid. 74 Ibid., pp. 656-657.

In his words,  ‘the Scriptures, especially the New Testament, was translated from  the original Greek and Hebrew languages into the languages of the  peoples among whom they were spread, including Arabic, Aramaic,  Abyssinian, Coptic, and Latin.’75 It was not logical, therefore, that  these thousands of Christians had collaborated on altering the  Scriptures. Ghabriyāl repudiated the Muslim view that the Scriptures  were corrupted. Muslims, in his view, definitely failed to pinpoint the  altered passages, or to mention the real reasons behind this alleged  corruption.76  In Riḍā’s opinion, the Qurʾān, unlike the Bible, was proven to be  in a clear way transmitted orally and in writing. Thus, preference  should be given to it above the Bible, as many ‘Christian scholars’  had admitted.77 Riḍā quoted a piece of work by the Coptic convert  to Islam, Muḥammad Effendi Ḥabīb, a teacher of Hebrew and English  in Cairo, which he wrote against the above-mentioned Gibāra (see,  the introduction). Ḥabīb quoted J.W.H. Stobart, the principal of La  Martiniere College in Lucknow.78 In Stobart’s view, ‘we have ample  proofs to believe that the existing Qurʾān is itself the original words  of the Prophet Muḥammad, as learnt or dedicated[?] under his obser- vation and instruction.’79 Stobart’s view was a quotation from Muir’s  work, The Life of Mahomet,80 whom Ḥabīb described as the ‘forceful  enemy of Islam.’81 As for the alteration of the Bible, Riḍā argued that Muslims do not  acknowledge that all these Scriptures were accurately transmitted  from the prophets. They believe that the Jews and Christians subse- 75 Al-Manār, vol. 4/19 (Ramaḍān 1319/December 1901), pp. 743-749. 76 Ibid., pp. 743-744. 77 Ibid., p. 744. 78 Ḥabīb, op  cit. J.W.H.

Riḍā repeated an often-cited example  by Muslim polemicists that it was not possible to believe that it was  Moses who had written the five books of the Torah because they speak  about him in the third person, and mentioned his death and burial  in one of the chapters.83  Riḍā cited a passage from the Book of Deuteronomy in that Moses  was reported to say: ‘Take this book of the law, and put it in the side  of the ark of the covenant of the Lord’ (31:26). For him, this phrase  was enough evidence to argue that Moses wrote a particular book,  which must have been lost. The next passages also conclude the   alteration of the Torah. Moses said: ‘For I know that after my death  ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which  I have commanded you’ (31:29).’ Riḍā defined the word ‘Torah,’ as  sharīʿa or law, whereas the existing five books are historical, even  though they contain some rulings. He compared it with the example  of the Qurʾānic verses of rulings, which Muslim historiographers  included in the works of the Sīra (the Prophet’s Biography), as con- taining sound and unsound narratives. Muslims do not consider the  books of Sīra as Qurʾān or as part of the revelation. The same holds  true for the stories on Moses and other Israelite prophets. Riḍā  pointed out that the authors of these books did not examine their  narratives as Muslim scholars did in their investigation of biographi- cal works on the prophet.84  Riḍā attempted to invalidate the claim of Ghabriyāl that the  Scriptures were preserved among thousands of people in various lan- guages. As vindication for his conviction, Riḍā quoted an anonymous  Christian Arabic work which acknowledged that the original copy of  Moses’ book disappeared at some time when paganism prevailed  among the Israelites till it was rediscovered in the Kingdom of Hosea  the Pious. The Christian author maintained that it is impossible that  the original version of Moses had survived until the present time. It  82 Wood, op  cit., p. 161. 83 Al-Manār, vol. 4/18, p. 745.

This was  therefore the reason why it was reported among the Jews that the  priestly scribe Ezra was the one who had found it again by collecting  the fragmented copies of the holy books and correcting their  mistakes.85  Riḍā severely reproved the ‘People of the Book’ for their belief that  Ezra had corrected and edited the Torah, while discarding the belief  that the Prophet Muḥammad had the ability to restore the whole  divine message. He moreover did not accept the idea that Ezra re- wrote the Scriptures as they originally had been. He even went further  to argue that it was not true that Ezra wrote the Torah on the basis  of divine revelation to him. Riḍā held a view in this regard similar to  many of early Muslim exegetes (such as Ibn Kathīr, al-Qurṭubī,  al-Ṭabarī) and polemicists. In his al-ʾAjwiba al-Fākhira (The Unique  Replies), the Egyptian jurist Shihāb al-Dīn al-Qarāfī (d. 684 AH/1285  AD), for instance, maintained that Nebuchadnezar murdered the Jews  and burnt the Torah. Ezra had collected it many years later. One  could not be sure about its authenticity, since it might have contained  lots of najasāt (impurities).86 In that regard Riḍā cited chapter seven  of the Book of Ezra in which it was stated that Ezra had ‘set his heart  to study the law of the Lord’ as a result of a letter given to him (Ezra  7:10-12). Riḍā interpreted this Biblical passage as meaning that Ezra  was merely one of the scribes of the revealed law, just as any scribe  of the revelation during the early age of Islam: ‘If we [Muslims]  assume that the Qurʾān was lost, and was never preserved by heart,  and then say that Muʿāwiya was inspired to write it only because he  was one of the scribes—would the People of the Book accept this  argument from us?’87  85 Ibid., p. 747.

The Glad Tidings of Peace 4.3.1  Muḥammad’s Superiority above all Prophets? When the Egyptian missionary magazine Bashāʾir al-Salām (The Glad  Tidings of Peace) praised the Israelites as ‘the blessed family tree,’  Riḍā portrayed its editor as someone ‘swimming in the sea of illusions.’88  In its own words, the Glad Tidings said that: ‘is it not amazing that  the Creator of the heavens and the earth was alone with the Children  of Israel in the wilderness, where He addressed them and they  addressed him [...]. Moses amongst them was in deep conversation  with Him, addressing various topics, just as two intimate companions  or close friends.’89 The writer addressed his Muslim readers saying  that the Prophet of Islam did not deserve to talk to God directly,  listen to His voice, nor witness His majesty the same as the general  folk of the Israelites did, let alone the elite among them. Neither had  Muḥammad had the privilege of speaking to Gabriel. He was rather  overcome with the feeling of fainting and trance, and by sweat appear- ing on his forehead on a day of severe cold.90  Riḍā considered this argument as a severe sacrilege against the  divine. For him, Muslims reported that their Prophet ascended to the  Heaven and witnessed some of ‘the greatest miracles of God’ during  his journey by night (al-Miʿrāj). He also saw God and talked to Him  without intermediary. Riḍā rejected the writer’s view concerning  Moses. According to the Book of Exodus, Moses and those among  the Children of Israel saw lightning and heard thundering, the noise  of a trumpet, and the mountain smoking (Ex. 20:18). The Israelites  ‘said unto Moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not  God speak with us, lest we would die’ (20:19). These passages, in  Riḍā’s opinion, disproved the author’s statement that the laymen of  the Children of Israel were talking to God directly and heard His  voice. In his comparison between the two cases of ruʾyah (vision),  Riḍā relied on the Qurʾānic narratives. In the case of Moses, he ‘fell  down senseless’ (al-ʾAʿrāf, 7:143), while Muḥammad ‘saw one of the  greatest signs of his Lord.’ (al-Najm, 53: 18).91 Riḍā stressed that the  Israelites, who were honoured and dignified by God, became  rebellious  88 Ibid. 89 Al-Manār, vol. 4/16, p. 619. 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid., p. 621. </page> <page sequence="26"> 200 chapter four and ungrateful to Him later. They also deserved ‘aversion’ and ‘loath- ing,’ and were deprived of God’s favour and mercy. The Arabs were  given a ‘blessing’ through the removal of paganism. Riḍā found it  strange that the writer quoted Qurʾānic verses to prove God’s blessing  on the Israelites, while ignoring the verses manifesting their rebellion  and disbelief.92  On another level, Riḍā went on to discuss his theological attitude  towards anthropomorphism as contrasted with Biblical concepts. For  Muslims, he argued, their fundamental basis of belief was the absolute  dissociation from any resemblance between God and the created  beings. Any Qurʾānic passage that might indicate anthropomorphism  should be subjected to metaphorical interpretation. In comparison  to the ‘anthropomorphism’ and ‘paganism’ of other religions, Riḍā  maintained that Muslims believed that God is far above having [a]  voice, place or direction, and that all of His attributes in the Qurʾān  are merely a form of divine proclamation. Riḍā reproached the writer  of the Glad Tidings for saying that God was in deep conversation  with Moses as an intimate friend: ‘It is no surprise that those who  say that Jesus is a god would say that God met alone with Moses,  addressing various topics in His conversation with him.’93 Like contemporary Muslim periodicals, missionary papers had a  separate section in which they used to answer the questions of their  readers. These queries dealt mostly with theological issues, and were  sometimes raised by Muslim readers. A Muslim ‘friend’ and reader  of his journal, for instance, once raised the question to the Glad  Tidings: Can we consider Peter, Paul, John and other New Testament  authors as messengers of God? Is there any prophecy on their mes- sage in the Old Testament, just as that on the coming of Jesus?94 Riḍā  was certain that the question was invented, and could not be asked  by a faithful Muslim. Muslims believed that messengers were those  who received the revelation of an independent religion, and were  commanded to preach it. Muslims never used the word ‘prophecy’  to mean ‘glad tidings.’ Riḍā was thus convinced that such a question  was fabricated by the magazine in order to give a false impression  and to delude their readers, or it was sent in by a ‘cultural’ Muslim  who had nothing to do with Islam, except his name [...], nationality  92 Ibid.  93 Wood, op  cit., pp. 144-145. 94 Ibid., pp. 623-624. </page> <page sequence="27"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 201 and lineage.’95 Another query was raised by another ‘friend’: Why is  it only Christians who are constantly involved in sending out mis- sionaries from the first appearance of Christianity until the present  day? The editor of the Glad Tidings answered: ‘because Christianity  is verily the guidance, and so far as guidance is in one’s heart, he  cannot restrain himself and conceal it from his fellow human beings.’96  In his reaction, Riḍā repeated his aforementioned point of view that  no religion was established without mission (see, chapter 3). However,  he added that ‘the true Daʿwa was that of the disciples of Jesus, which  was based on their strong faith; nevertheless, few joined them whereas  the Islamic Daʿwa continued to gain millions: as soon as a Muslim  trader entered an Asian or African city, it would convert to Islam  immediately.’ It was only the European supremacy, Riḍā went on,  that made missionaries ‘loudly speak and write.’ The true answer,  which the Christian writer should have given, was that ‘the Christians  preached their religion because politics motivated them, while they  were [always] followed by money and protected by weapons.’97 4.3.2. Fear and Hope In another article, the Glad Tidings asserted that ‘many Muslims die  on the carpet of hope to enter Paradise and enjoy its pleasures as  based on the magnificent promises in their Qurʾān [...] The only  reason for that is nothing but their ignorance of the reality of them- selves and the perfections of the Almighty.’98 It further argued that  Muslims of knowledge and mental faculties seek relief from the   burden of their sins through extravagant asceticism, devotion, sup- plication, and prayers to God. The magazine reckoned among these  the fearfulness expressed by the Companions of the Prophet, such as  Abū Bakr and ʿAlī. The Glad Tidings suggested that ‘if these  Companions had known and believed in the doctrine of Salvation,  they would have lived safe from God’s stratagem and punishment.’99  Riḍā harshly criticised the writer’s knowledge of Islam. According  to him, the missionary writer incorrectly included the Ḥadīth scholar  Sufyān al-Thawrī as one of the Companions. He was infuriated by  95 Ibid., p. 624. 96 Ibid. 97 Ibid., p. 626. 98 Al-Manār, vol. 5/3, p. 98. 99 Ibid., p. 100. </page> <page sequence="28"> 202 chapter four what he considered as ‘offenses’ against the Companions and rightly- guided Muslim Imams. He furthermore asserted that Muslims have  a higher esteem of the prophets than the Jews and the Christians who  portrayed them as cruel, unjust, drunk, and committing adultery or  murder. Riḍā was convinced that if a Muslim were required to believe  in the collection of the books of the Old Testament, and his religion  permitted him to elevate anyone above prophets, he would give his  preference to those rightly-guided Imams above the prophets as  described by the Torah.’100  Concerning the concepts of ‘fear’ and ‘hope,’ Riḍā believed that  they represent the basis of the true religion. In his view, the author  disparaged the Islamic perception with regard to these two concepts  only in order to attract people to his religion. He indirectly tried to  promote the doctrine that salvation and the eternal life in the Kingdom  would be solely obtainable through the belief that God would save  people through becoming incarnate in a human body.101 Riḍā extended  his above-mentioned argument by stipulating that the Christian mes- sage encourages people to be more libertine through murder, com- mitting adultery, getting drunk, and be a source of ruin to creation  while being convinced that they would be saved by means of this  doctrine. He also criticised the writer for ignoring the fact that his  own Scriptures were not devoid of passages referring to Biblical  prophets and saints, who were also fearful to God and hopeful for  His blessings.102 Riḍā made it clear, however, that many ‘fair-minded’  Christians held the same view as Muslims in their belief that all proph- ets and upright believers adhered to absolute monotheism. Their fear  of God was to keep them apart from sins and evil, while their hope  was to stimulate them to do right.103 In conclusion, Riḍā reminded  his missionary opponent of the various examples of fear mentioned  by al-Ghazālī, such as fear of revoking repentance, and the incapacity  to fulfil obligation.104  100  Ibid., p. 99. 101 Ibid., pp. 99-100. 102 Ibid., p. 100. 103 Ibid., pp. 100-101. 104 Ibid., p. 101.

Faith and Acts of Muslims Under the title, ʾImān al-Muslimīn wā A ʿmāluhum (Faith and Acts  of Muslims), the Glad Tidings wrote that ‘it is possible according the  school of Ahl al-Sunna that one could truly believe in Islam, while  persisting in evil action.’105 Citing various Biblical verses, the writer  raised two points of objection to Islam: 1) Islam was a false and val- ueless faith, as it did not impress the sense of repentance and good  endeavour upon the mind of the believer, while abandoning him  when his sins outweigh his good acts. It also denigrated the majesty  of the Creator and amplified the misery of the created. 2) The  Muhammadan religion was also incapable of bringing complete salva- tion for humankind.106  In his reply, Riḍā maintained that his ‘disputant’ did not perceive  that his own argument could turn against him. He reiterated that the  New Testament is the only way of redemption and that inheriting  the Kingdom could be only achieved by the belief in Jesus, even when  the believer was an evildoer or libertine. He also pointed out that  faith was closely associated with good deeds in 75 Qurʾānic verses.107  Riḍā argued that Islam stipulated that faith should produce sound  deeds, while acts had no value in Christianity. But it was the mission- ary ‘net’ with which the magazine attempted to ‘catch’ ignorant  Muslims into accepting Christianity through his allegations against  Islam. At the same time, however, he completely forgot that preaching  that salvation was confined to the doctrines of Trinity and Crucifixion  only would never motivate its followers to do good and avoid evil.  The ‘ignorant’ would therefore be deluded by the missionary argu- ment, and be more inclined to choose the faith which does not burden  him with additional religious duties.108  Riḍā agreed with the statement of the Glad Tidings that any faith  that does not aim at perfection and piety is false. Its writer, however,  criticised the concept of punishment according to some Muslim tra- ditions that sinful Muslims will be ‘imprisoned in the Hellfire for a  period not less than seven hundred years and not more than seven  thousand years.’109 Riḍā rejected his opponent’s assertion that such  105 Al-Manār, vol. 5/11, p. 436. 106 Ibid. 107 Riḍā cited Qurʾānic verses such as, 4:123-124, 8: 2-4, and 103:1-3.  108 Ibid, p. 437. 109 As quoted in ibid. </page> <page sequence="30"> 204 chapter four reports are neither mentioned in the Qurʾān nor in sound Ḥadīths.  They were only related in some unsound and unacceptable Ḥadīths  of no binding proofs. Riḍā followed ʿAbduh’s view that the affairs  related to the Day of Judgement should be taken directly from the  Qurʾān and the mutawātir Ḥadīths. To make the point clear, the Glad  Tidings quoted the Qurʾānic verse: ‘There is not one of you but shall  approach [hell] (Maryam, 19:71).’ Riḍā interpreted the verse as not  addressing Muslims. According to one exegetical view, the verse, in  connection with the whole context of previous passages, was meant  to address the unbelievers. Another view indicated that it generally  referred to all people (believers and unbelievers). But believers will  quickly pass alongside the Hellfire in order to appreciate God’s bless- ing when they finally enter the Paradise.110 4.3.4. Absurd Treatment  The Glad Tidings also attacked Islamic doctrines and practices as  inferior to the Jāhiliyya Arab pagan society. It saw that Islam added  six new elements of paganism to its pagan characteristics, which Riḍā  considered as an absurd treatment.111  First of all, Muslims hold Muḥammad in the second place after  God in the formula of shahāda, which they claim to be written on  the Throne of God even before the Creation. Riḍā explained the gen- eral Muslim point of view that the Muslim must believe in the  prophethood of Moses and Jesus, just as his belief in the prophethood  of Muḥammad. As for the connection of the two names of Allah and  Muḥammad in the shahāda, it had been narrated in some Traditions  to the Muslim requesting utter the word ʿabduhu (his servant) in the  formula. The shahāda’s being written on the Throne, in Riḍā’s mind,  was not one of the essential doctrines of Islam. ‘And if the formula  was really written down there, this would imply no form of paganism,  since ‘the servant remains servant, and the lord remains lord.’112 The Glad Tidings alleged that Muslims raise the status of the Ḥadīth  to the Qurʾān, and for this reason the Sunnīs became angered by the  Shiʿī rejection of Ḥadīth. Riḍā considered both claims as false. The  110 Ibid., p. 438. 111 ‘Sakhāfat Bashāʾir al-Salām fī al-Jāhiliyya wā al-Islam (The absurdity of Bashāʾir  al-Salām concerning the Jāhiliyya and Islam),’ al-Manār, vol. 5/13, p. 517. 112 Ibid., p. 517. </page> <page sequence="31"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 205 Qurʾān was the fundamental basis of religion, while the Sunna was  giving additional clarity. The Muslim is fully requested to believe in  the Qurʾān and recite it in his worship. But disbelief in any one of  the Ḥadīths will not harm his faith as a Muslim. Riḍā further explained  that the Muslim is not obliged to follow the Ḥadīths related to worldly  affairs (dunya), such as the one on cultivating the palm-tree. Muslims,  he went on, can distinguish between the Qurʾān, as a direct revelation,  and the indirect revelation, which the Prophet was reported to have  uttered in his own words.  The missionary magazine, on the other hand, pointed out that the  name of Muḥammad was connected with the name of Allah in many  places in the Qurʾān as an associate in matters such as command and  prohibition, and the obligation of obedience and love. It also main- tained that Muslims take him as their master and intercessor. Taking  a created being as an intercessor was identical to pre-Islamic Arab  polytheism. The writer defended himself as a non-polytheist.  Christians believe in Jesus as the eternal word of God, and as the  creator, not the created. Muslims, on the other hand, are polytheists,  since they know perfectly well the status of their prophet as a human  being, while insisting on having him as an intercessor.113 In the Qurʾān  it is also stated that God and the angels perform ṣalāh (prayer) over  the Prophet (33:56). But Muslims exaggerate in their perception of  his pre-existence to the degree that they state that he was eternal light  and pre-existing to humanity. Riḍā replied that the Prophet of Islam  was nowhere in the Qurʾān or in the Sunna described as master. Riḍā  criticised the writer for his misunderstanding of the verse. Muslim  scholars interpreted the ṣalāh as ‘mercy and compassion.’ For Riḍā,  the magazine’s assumption was not logical: ‘were every individual  from whom we ask mercy and anybody or whom we call ‘master’  would be like a god of ours? Then we and the writer would have  uncountable deities.’114 Riḍā expressed a puritan view by stating that  the exaggeration in honouring the Prophet in that way ensued from  the books and narratives of mawālid, and the faith of the common  folk. In his reply, Riḍā added that the concept of intercession (shafāʿa)  in Islam merely meant ‘supplication.’ In that sense, every Muslim was  an intercessor, and similarly every believer summoning upon God  for himself and others. The comparison between Jesus and Muḥammad  113 Ibid., p. 520. 114 Ibid., p. 519. </page> <page sequence="32"> 206 chapter four in this  manner was, in Riḍā’s view, absurd. He said cynically : ‘it  means that polytheism is the Muslim belief in their prophet as God’s  servant and his intercession as supplication to God, while the pure  monotheism is the Christian belief that their prophet, who was born  1902 years ago, is God, the Pre-existent, the Eternal, the Creator of  all things before and after him.’115 4.3.5. Exceeding the Borders of Politeness We have mentioned that Riḍā did not include all articles under the  section of Shubuhāt in al-Manār in his later compiled treatise, which  Wood has translated. In this part, two of these articles were written  as replies to the Glad Tidings, which clearly display his increasing  frustration with what he called ‘exceeding the borders of politeness’  within these missionary circles. Riḍā was shocked by what he saw as  anti-Islamic views uttered by its newly-appointed editor-in-chief,  Niqūlā effendi Rafāʾil (or Raphael), whom he formerly knew as a  ‘decent’ person.116  In the Glad Tidings, Rafāʾil published one of his debates with a  Muslim at the Protestant library in the city of Suez. The Muslim  objected to the doctrine of the Crucifixion of Jesus using Qurʾānic  verses. But Rafāʾil asked his Muslim adversary whether he would  believe in the Crucifixion if he were a contemporary to Jesus, and  personally witnessed it. The Muslim replied in the affirmative that he  would have definitely believed in it just as other observers did. Then  Rafāʾil argued that it was more reasonable to believe in an incident  as an eye-witness than to have faith in the story as had been told by  an illiterate man in Mecca nearly seven hundred years later. The  Muslim’s reply was challenging, saying that he would definitely believe  in the illiterate man, who was proven to be a messenger of God, while  rejecting his eyesight and that of other people as well. Rafāʾil  re-contended that Muḥammad’s words might have been the teach-  ings of the Satan, but not of God. The great miracles achieved by  115 Ibid., p. 520; Wood, op  cit., p. 195. 116 Al-Manār, ‘Daʿwā Ṣalb al-Masīḥ (the Claim of Jesus’ Crucifixion),’ vol. 6/2  (Ṣafar 1321/May 1903), pp. 62-67. Niqūlā Rafāʾil was the founder of another Christian  bi-monthly magazine under the title: al-Iṣlāḥ al-Maskūnī or al-ʿAṣr al-Dhahabī (1  June, 1906). See the index of Dār al-Kutub, op  cit, p. 562. He was also the author of  al-Daʿwa al-Waṭaniyya ʾilā Tabshīr al-ʾUmma al-ʾIslamiyya (The National Call for  Doing mission among the Muslim Community), Alexandria, 1900. See, Nuṣayr,  op  cit , p. 129.  </page> <page sequence="33"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 207 Muḥammad were again enough evidence for the Muslim to believe  in the divine origin of his prophet’s message. Rafāʾil, however, con- tested that while the Qurʾān rejected the reality of Crucifixion, the  Holy Scriptures and their historical narratives, the majority of the  people still believed in it. According to Rafāʾil, the Muslim, unable to  reply, was defeated by this argument and left the place. Rafāʾil added  that the Qurʾānic view on the Crucifixion was quoted from the belief  of al-Dustiyūn (Docetics) that the physical body of Jesus was an illu- sion, as was his Crucifixion. Jesus was in reality incorporeal, and he  only seemed to have a physical body and could not physically die.  Rafāʾil argued that Muḥammad had copied their belief in the Qurʾān  (4:156) that the Jews: ‘did not kill him, and they did not crucify him,  but a similitude was made for them.’117  Riḍā had not expected that Rafāʾil would attack Islam in this man- ner. In Riḍā’s evaluation, Rafāʾil’s Muslim counterpart was definitely  a common person who lacked deep religious knowledge; and the  missionary must also have exaggerated his story by adding or delib- erately perverting the words of his partner in the dialogue. Riḍā even  doubted the Muslim’s replies as real. He did not imagine that the  faithful Muslim, who was confused by this argument, would leave  such a debate without giving any convincing explanation of the  Qurʾānic report concerning Crucifixion. Riḍā was convinced that the  story of Crucifixion had become a controversial issue among the  Christian themselves. For the first time, Riḍā’s mentioned the Gospel  of Barnabas, which he described as one of the Gospels in which there  was no mention of the story, even though the Christians tried to  destroy it.118  Regarding the miracles achieved by the Prophet Muḥammad, Riḍā  held the classical point of view that the Qurʾān was his most significant  miracle. He drew an analogy between the prophet and the author of  many valuable medical books, who also proved to be a clever physi- cian after many successful and useful treatments. The performance  of miracles was never his evidence to be a good doctor. Muslims  similarly believed that the prophet was enabled to perform many  miraculous acts, but because they were less important than his mis- sion he never made them the cornerstone of his mission. The prophet,  117 Ibid., pp. 63-64. It was the argument of many Western scholars that the Docetic  views of Jesus looked like the Qurʾānic concept of non-Crucifixion. See, for instance,  H. Gregoire, Mahomet et le monophysisme, in Mélanges Charles Diehl, Paris 1930,  pp. 107-119. 118 Ibid., p. 65. </page> <page sequence="34"> 208 chapter four on the other hand, ‘came to address minds, to support science, to  explain reasoning, and to abolish witchcraft [...] and swindling by  encouraging man to promote himself through knowledge and work.’119 Rafāʾil’s assertion that Islam was copied from Docetism was, in  Riḍā’s opinion, baseless. He argued that when missionaries objected  to a Qurʾānic story related to a prophet or a nation known to them,  they would immediately claim that Muḥammad plagiarised it from  such-and-such false or heretical sects. But if their Scriptures gave no  mention to a story mentioned in the Qurʾān, they would draw the  conclusion that it had not been revealed. In plain words, Riḍā con- firmed that the Prophet of Islam never learnt thoughts of other  nations, and had no knowledge of languages other than Arabic.120 In conclusion, Riḍā asked his Christian compatriots to understand  that he never intended to start attacking Christianity. But it was his  duty as a scholar to defend his religion against any attacks and  offenses. Missionaries, according to him, were not seeking the truth.  He also demanded fair-minded Christians not to blame him. They  should help him to bring the missionary attacks to an end.121 According to al-Manār, the editor(s) of the Glad Tidings soon  dismissed Rafāʾil. He also failed to find any other job as a journalist.  Therefore he started to publish his own missionary publications, and  toured Egyptian towns and villages to preach Christianity among  Muslims. He sent Riḍā a letter with copies of his publications. In his  letter, he wrote: ‘Because I noticed that your magnificent journal is  zealous in defending Islam, I am sending this letter to you in order  that you would reply to it according to your knowledge, and publish  the reply in your journal. And if you were not able to give reply due  to its solid evidences, I would earnestly request you to pay it some  of your attention.’ Riḍā refused to give any answer, as it was logical  for him that he only aimed at using al-Manār as a channel for making  publicity for his writings. Riḍā furthermore disqualified Rafāʾil’s ‘evi- dences’ as ‘childish fantasies.’122 119 Ibid., p. 66. 120 Ibid., pp. 66-67. 121 Ibid. A few weeks later, Riḍā received a letter from one of his readers in Suez  in which he reacted to Rafāʾil’s concept of Crucifixion. He cited a few passages from  the Gospel, which he saw as an indication that the disciples of Jesus were also confused  in recognising him even before his Crucifixion: (Mathew, 26:34, cf. Marcus 14:30,  Luke 22:34 and 13:38).

The Standard of Zion 4.4.1  Sinlessness of Prophets and Salvation Riḍā received the missionary periodical Rāyat Ṣuhyūn (The Standard  of Zion) with the editor’s request: ‘I request a reading of the article  on the sinning of prophets and a reply to it.’123 The article maintained  that ‘Muslims say that God sent many prophets to the world. The  greatest among them were six: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus  and Muḥammad. Many [Muslims] say that all of these prophets were  sinless, and therefore were competent to grant salvation to their fol- lowers. If they had been sinners, it would have never been easy for  them to do that, since the sinner can not grant his salvation from the  sin to others.’124 On the basis of stories from the Old Testament, the  Standard argued that all these prophets, except Jesus, were sinners.  Examples of these were Adam’s disobedience to God and Noah’s  getting drunk. As for Abraham, it was reported that he ‘lied twice  because of his fear of the people.’ Moses was commanded by God to  go to the Pharaoh, but he showed great fear and increasing timidity,  which would make God angry with him. When the Children of Israel  were in the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt, Moses uttered  incoherent words. God, due to this sin, forbade him to return to the  land Canaan, and ordained him to die in the desert.125 In the Qurʾān,  the Standard went on, it was also stated that all of them asked God’s  forgiveness, except Jesus. 126 This was exactly the same line of argu- ment in the missionary writings of the late nineteenth century. The  American missionary E.M. Wherry (1843-1927), for example,  addressed the moral excellence of the Old Testament major prophets  and Muḥammad. He further concluded that ‘we nowhere find a single  sentence or word, or even a shadow of a hint that Jesus was a sinner.’127  In his answer, Riḍā firstly explained that the author was incorrect  in counting Adam among the five prophets of resolve (ʾulū al-ʿAzm)  123 Al-Manār, vol. 4/21 (Shawwāl 1319/26 January 1902), p. 816. 124 Ibid., p. 817. 125 Wood, op  cit., p. 169. 126 As cited in al-Manār, vol. 4/21, p. 818. 127 As quoted in, Alan M. Guenther, ‘The Image of the Prophet as Found in Mis- sionary Writings of the Late Nineteenth Century,’ The Muslim World 90/1, 2000,  p. 58. </page> <page sequence="36"> 210 chapter four from an Islamic point of view.128 Muslims do not believe that due to  their infallibility prophets would be their saviors; they were only sent  as preachers. It is only one’s faith and good deeds that can save a  person. Riḍā ridiculed the writer by stating that he did not understand  the notion of infallibility (ʿiṣma) attributed to prophets according to  Islam. Their infallibility merely means that they never committed any  kabīra (grave sin), and does not signify that they were different from  all human beings, or that they never experienced pain and fear. As  for the author’s statement that wine-drinking was the only sin Noah  committed, Riḍā stressed that in the New Testament it is related that  Jesus drank wine as well. As Jesus committed the same ‘sin,’ he would  not have had the ability to save the people either. Riḍā interpreted  the tale of Abraham’s sinning by lying in an allegorical way. He  intended to protect his wife by saying: ‘she is my sister,’ which meant  ‘in religion.’ He hid the truth only out of necessity in order to get  rid of evil and injustice by protecting his wife against slavery or cap- ture.129 Neither did Riḍā accept the idea that the fear expressed by  Moses should be a sin or violation of the law. It was his human feel- ing of fearfulness and of the sublimity of his divine mission. It was  also not appropriate, according to Riḍā, to consider the prophets  seeking forgiveness as a mark of rebellion or violation of God’s reli- gion. It was only their perception of glorifying Him.130 4.5. Conclusion In the above-mentioned articles, we have shown that Riḍā discussed  both Judeo-Christian and Muslim Scriptures on the basis of classical  and modern interpretations. Riḍā’s usage of Western sources in this  128 The messengers of ʾulū-al-ʿAzm in Islam were five: Noah, Abraham, Moses,  Jesus and Muḥammad. The prophet Muḥammad was asked to ‘bear up [hardships] as  did the apostles endowed with resolve bear up with patience’ (Al-Aḥqāf: 35). They  were called as such because they were resolve and arduous in facing the immense trial  of their people. 129 In his polemics with Samuel Ibn Nagrela, Ibn Hazm made it clear that the text  of Genesis 20:12 on the tale specifically defined ‘sister’ in words attributed to Abraham  himself, as ‘daughter of my father.’ The only way in which Abraham’s marriage to his  sister could be defended, Ibn Hazm said, would be by appeal to the Islamic principle  of abrogation. See, Theodore Pulcini, Exegesis as Polemical Discourse: Ibn Hazm on  Jewish and Christian Scriptures, Atlanta: Scholars Press 1998, p. 60. 130 Al-Manār, vol. 4/21, pp. 819-820. </page> <page sequence="37"> rid.ā’s Formative Polemics on Christianity 211 specific period was not entirely absent. It is interesting to see that he  quoted the Western critical study of the Bible from a work of fiction,  such as ʿ Alam al-Dīn, and quoted the statements of a Christian convert  to Islam. Riḍā found the Egyptian magazine, Glad Tidings of Peace, the most  outspoken among the Christian missionary publications in its enmity  towards Islam. All of these missionary publications reflected the gen- eral thesis that Islam was at many levels inherently inferior and irra- tional as compared to Christianity. Specific criticisms included the  following: the Qurʾān was inconsistent and inharmonious; and  Muḥammad was inferior to Moses and Jesus and therefore not a real  prophet. Therefore, Muslims did not properly adhere to their  Scriptures, which strongly commanded them to believe in the Bible.131  In his answer, Riḍā’s supposedly abstract comparison of Moses, Jesus  and Muḥammad was not entirely based on Islamic sources. He went  beyond these sources by restricting his arguments to some descriptive  analysis of the characters of the two prophets in comparison to  Muḥammad. In the case of Moses, it was his upbringing under the  custody of the Pharaoh, which made him a diligent and proud person.  Jesus was portrayed as a Jewish man, who was much influenced by  the Roman and the Greek way of life.  In his answer, Riḍā was in the ‘defensive arena,’ and his main  objective was to refute the ‘allegations’ of the missionaries as much  as he could. He was anxious that they would definitely affect the  common Muslims who had no solid knowledge. Besides his critique  of the textual authenticity of the Bible, Riḍā cynically attacked its  content and the current interpretation of its message. The teachings  of the canonical gospels were, for example, excessive in love and  power in contrast to the Qurʾānic concept of moderation. He fre- quently attacked his Christian counterparts for their implicit propaga- tion of ‘evildoing’ and of libertine behaviour among their followers  through their confirmation that the only way of redemption was to  believe in Jesus, whatever sins they might commit in their life. In  comparison to that, he further argued, Islam required of the believers  that faith should produce sound deeds. 131 Wood, op  cit., pp. 44-45. </page> <page sequence="38"> 212 chapter four </page> </plain_text>
