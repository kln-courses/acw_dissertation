<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fortune in the Wind An Impersonal Subjectivity Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed Abstract: For Mongols, fortune is not just acquired or lost accidentally. Rituals are held to create an upsurge of fortune, to beckon, absorb, con- tain, and act upon it. This article focuses on two kinds of fortune- siilde (potency) and hiimori (vitality)- and the ritualized means to restore these qualities that otherwise become depleted of their own accord. It is argued that these ideas of fortune are ways of linking subjects to cos- mological forces 'out there'. The paradox is that, by binding fortune into their bodies in an attempt to garner invincibility, bravery, and energy, people resonate to pulses that glide among, and fly beyond, their other constitutive physical bodily elements. Such occasions when siilde and hiimori are in play call into being a certain kind of person who seems to be rendered, at least for a moment, at one with the void. Keywords: body, chance, fortune, gender, impersonal individuation, luck, subjectivity, vitality, wind This article is about welcoming and opening oneself to fortune and the ways in which this is done in Mongolian regions. Fortune need not be dreaded for its 'slings and arrows'. The Mongols can envisage fortune as a surge with which to assimilate, as a transient gust to catch and triumphantly demonstrate- an idea that is more in tune with Brutus's thought: There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; ... On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures.1 The closely related Mongolian ideas we refer to are siilde (might, life force, inspi- ration) and hiimori (lit. 'air [hii] horse [mori]').

The Web site dedicated to national wrestling typically features, alongside the magnificently muscled competitors, a series of changing illustrations: a glowing sky, a soar- ing eagle, a wolf howling, sun and stars in a misty firmament, some ancient nomads on their way.2 This article aims to describe a concept of fortune that is crucial to individuals and to the polity and to explain its cosmological rami- fications and particular kind of subjectivity. The kind of fortune at issue is not a finite possession but rather a fluctuating state of being. Even when it is externalized and envisaged through the prism of anthropomorphic or zoomor- phic images (the 'god' or 'air-horse' of fortune), the practices of raising one's fortune involve intimate merging with elemental and formless things, such as wind and dust. This implies a kind of momentary subjectivity that, rather than looking inward, is a suffusion of the self with the most external, the boundless. Julian Pitt-Rivers (1974: 10) observed long ago, when writing about mana , honor, and grace, that each of these is a term for a conceptual complexity that can be seen as a nexus linking the mundane with the sacred. The concept of 'grace', for example, abstracted from diverse accounts for the purpose of anthropological explanation, must be made capacious enough to go beyond any particular English idiom, for only by such a maneuver is it "possible to see the connection between the grace said before a meal and the grace displayed in dancing" (ibid.: 12-13). 'Fortune' similarly has the character of a field of diverse, sometimes sharply differing, yet occasionally overlapping, idioms of discourse and action (da Col 2007: 215). This is why we use the same word 'fortune' as Rebecca Empson (2012), in the first of these two special issues, for a constellation of ideas that is distinct from the one she describes. The two ensembles co-exist among Mongols, both being available for any individual or collectivity of people, the important point being that each modality is a differ- ent way of conceptualizing and handling the mysterious coming and going of vitality, luck, and success. The terrain of ideas about fortune in Mongolia is variable and unstable, but not chaotic. Although any given person will be the host for several kinds of fortune at the same time, some of which are related to one another, it is not the case that any element can be linked up with any other. The main groupings of ideas translatable as 'fortune' are the following: Buddhist karmic fortune, which determines one's life chances by the deeds one had performed in previous lives (and since these are unknown, the effect can appear to be fortune-like); astrological fortune, whereby a person's time of birth is linked with auspicious/inauspicious zodiac signs, the 12-animal cycle, and so forth; and the fortune of place, which designates certain landscape configurations as favorable/adverse.3 Then there is the non-Buddhist idea of destiny (jiya), which is often described as a person's lot or share ( huv or huv jiya). Another kind of fortune is that of pure chance or luck (az, zol , zol zavsiyan). Finally, there are the two modalities of fortune discussed in this collection that are quite difficult to describe and distinguish from one another, partly because they do not correspond easily to European ideas. We have come to the conclusion that these modalities refer to different pools of evocations and</page><page sequence="3">154 I Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed distinctive kinds of activity. To understand the difference, verbs are more telling than nouns. As discussed by Empson (2012), hishig (or heshig , in Inner Mon- golian) is material or immaterial good fortune, benefit, or favor that is added to (; nemegdeh), kept and contained, secreted away, allowed to escape, beckoned back in again, and 'possessed', as it were, against other people. Historically associated with a share of sacrificial meat,4 today it can refer to a happy rise in salary (Inner Mongolia) or the financial bounty distributed by the government to each citizen on the occasion of a favorable oil deal (Mongolia). We could certainly conceive of a kind of 'economy' of hishig.5 Contrasted with hishig is the notion of fortune as 'triumph', 'might', or 'invin- cibility', commonly called siilde, which is related to ideas of 'personal brilliance' (i chog ) or 'strong-heartedness' ( ziriiken tamir). Everyone has siilde , but in some it is weak and in others strong, and furthermore it fluctuates.6 Siilde fortune thus seems to suggest a quality of character. But the curious thing is that sülde is also located outside oneself, taking residence in a deity or in particular objects, such as battle standards ( tug , siilde) , flags, and state or military emblems. The verbs commonly used for salde are debjilge- (to make rise up in the air, prosper, grow, become excited) and manduula- (to make to tower, revive, flourish). There is a constant movement between inside and outside, between a person's inner state of siilde and its replenishment or revival from outside. Such motility is also true of hishig , but if the movements to increase hishig fortune are primarily inward, a gathering in to the self, those of siilde are directed outward and upward. Siilde is raised up, boosted, flown (as one flies a flag), scattered, and shed (as with light). To anticipate our argument somewhat, it is as though people somehow raise greater siilde fortune by going beyond themselves, elevating their consciousness to align the bodily self with something in the 'beyond'. The difference between the two early (even pre-Mongol)7 ideas of hishig and siilde can be clarified when we see how each of them was linked to concepts in Buddhist thinking, which strengthened after the mass spread of the religion from the sixteenth century onward. Hishig is paired with 'merit' ( bnyan ) in the causal-productive idiom8 of the spiritual reward one accumulates for meritorious deeds in the karmic system. The compound buyan-hishig fortune is 'beckoned in' at a rite that is part of numerous monastic services and also forms a section of ceremonies such as offerings to mountain gods, blessings of the yurt, or cel- ebrating the first milk of spring. By contrast, siilde , the kind of fortune needed in risky endeavors, refers to a different morality. Its parallel in the Tibetan world is hiimori, literally, 'air-horse' (Tib. lung-rtá), also called saUi-yn mori (wind-horse) by many Mongols. People of Urad in Inner Mongolia say that siilde and wind- horse are more or less the same thing- they are both inner qualities of vigor and success, and both are also located in objects outside. In the case of lung-rta/ hiimori, this external object is a flag printed with a horse, the 'four powerful ani- mals', and various mantras and prayers. Hiimori flags flutter from sacred cairns all over Mongolia and Buryatia; in the Urad and Ordos regions of Inner Mongolia, virtually every Mongol household erects a high pole to fly the wind-horse flag. The quality of mobility through air is also true of the battle standard that contains, or is, the siilde. Such a standard consists of a tall pole topped by a</page><page sequence="4">Fortune in the Wind | 155 metal trident, beneath which is fixed a ring of long hair. The hair could simply dangle limply, but the Mongols do not depict it this way- it blows in the wind. Another material manifestation of siilde can be a towering multi-colored silk canopy called labar. In Urad this is flown at the peak of a mountain from a high pole topped by a trident, as we shall describe later. In each case, the wind unfurls the hangings, blows them around, and energizes the fronds as they absorb invisible natural forces.9 At the same time, the unpredictability of the wind is indexical of a naturalized notion of chance; the chanciness of human fortune is assimilated to the vagaries of elemental happenings. A Urad lama told us that the wind-horse flag is nothing but a piece of cloth until it flutters with the wind. Fortune is negated if the flag is kept inside; it must be taken out and flown from the highest possible place. In other words, the flag is a different thing when it is fluttering from when it is still. A well-known rein- carnation, the Kanjurwa Khutughtu, said: "As the wind furls the flags, the horses are continually moving and to our people this suggests that their good fortune is always moving ahead" (Hyer and Jagchid 1983: 88). The thinking here is not just by analogy; it pertains to the 'occult synchronicity' (Gell 1974) whereby one thing happening in the world (stirring, furling flags) is held to affect another process happening at the same time (the energizing of people's fortune). The concepts of siilde and wind-horse thus have many elements in common: both can apply to single individuals but also to families and larger social groups such as clans, administrative units, and nations; both are associated with height; both are somehow activated by wind or air; and (unlike hishig) both pertain only to male personhood. Although there are some differences- notably, that siilde can refer to a personal entity like a 'sour and to the spirit of an ances- tor, which is not the case with hiimori- in both instances fortune is held to be something inside you that you may cultivate by acting in the right way. Dealing with the Unknowable However, there is no inner sense that tells a person whether his siilde/hiimori is flying high or 'lying down' ( hevten ). This is a form of subjectivity where one's state of being, fortunate or not, can be known only from external signs. Pos- sessing the regular good things of life, such as healthy children, wealth, and so on, indicates a generally fortunate or hiimoritoi (with hiimori ) person, but this is not enough to tell if one's fortune is sufficient for some particular enterprise. Divination may be necessary, but better still is success in a chancy matter such as gambling, wrestling, or hunting, which boosts fortune and projects it for- ward for future victories. A burst of fortune is thus future-oriented, but it also spreads laterally to the social surroundings. This is the case with hunting the wolf, which, of all wild animals, is renowned as being the most wild and the most hiimoritoi- the worthiest prey- as it is dangerous, intelligent, and elu- sive. Hunters who have managed to kill a wolf are held to acquire its fortune, immensely boosting their own (Charlier 2010: 97). Recently, hunters have dis- played the bloody carcasses of wolves on the hoods of their cars as they drive</page><page sequence="5">156 I Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed round the streets of Ulaanbaatar.10 This can be seen not only as a demonstra- tion of personal triumph but as spreading the fortune throughout the city.11 Conversely, a run of misfortune (stolen wallet, gambling losses, sick wife) indicates that one's hiimori is exhausted or lying down. Apart from the fact that fortune inevitably wears out and has to be replenished, there may be an immediate cause for misfortune. In the siilde/hiimorì discourse, such a cause is not attributed to some other system, such as bad destiny, immoral activities (in the karmic system), or loss of hishig ; rather, it is explained by involuntary 'pollution' {buzar). Perhaps 'contamination' would be a better word for the contact (of which one is almost invariably unaware) with negative autonomous energy carried by seemingly ordinary things that is at issue here. These every- day things could be utensils, clothes, or even words linked to death, illness, menstrual blood, immoral acts,12 or offenses to chthonic land and water spirits. This negative, fortune-destroying energy can be carried by a host of strange, anomalous events that are believed to "introduce disorder into the way things go naturally."13 It can also be conveyed by close relatives who have violated some taboo. Such contamination does not directly affect hishig , but it damages the siilde/hiimorì , which in turn causes misfortune that might include the disap- pearance of hishig. The solution is to ask a lama to read the hiimoriin sang (Tib. bsangs) prayer or to request a shaman to conduct a buzar gargah (exterminate the pollution) rite, either of which should cleanse the person. Yet quite apart from the fact that such a rite may misidentify or not get to the bottom of the problem- for the potential causes are a shifting imbroglio of possibilities- there is also the general fluctuation of fortune and its tendency to decay that must be attended to. This is why regular seasonal rituals are held to restore siilde/ hiimori , the aim being to achieve a state of serendipity, the blessed state in which one is able to grasp or clinch the fortunate event when it happens. In this Mongol practice of inspiring readiness for what (ever) happens, we can perhaps see something close to the 'love of fate' ( amor fati)- the affir- mation that both Nietzsche and Deleuze write about. According to this idea, which is an ethical one, people must be worthy of any good that happens to them. The hiimoritoi person who has a strong siilde is morally admirable, and his attributes are viewed differently from those of a person considered to be merely lucky {aztai). Integral to this concept is the sense- carried by both of these Mongol ideas of fortune- of the honorableness of a kind of imagining that disregards practicality. The 'high' serendipitous fortune of a person is not involved in calculations about one's chances and predicting probable outcomes (Deleuze [1990] 2004: 169-172; Hallward 2006: 135-136). Acquiring Potent Fortune The Mongol idea that you should restore in yourself the admirable quality of potency in fortune {siilde) can be explored by comparing it with changing European ideas concerning the goddess Fortune. About pre-Christian thinking, Quentin Skinner (1981: 29) writes: "How, then, can we persuade Fortune to look</page><page sequence="6">Fortune in the Wind | 157 in our direction, to pour out the gifts of her cornucopia on us rather than on others? The answer is that, although Fortune is a goddess, she is still a woman; and since she is a woman, she is most of all attracted by the vir , the man of true manliness. One quality she especially likes to reward is thus held to be manly courage . . . But the quality she admires most of all is virtus , the epony- mous attribute of the truly manly man." Skinner then goes on to describe how, under the influence of Christianity, these ideas change. Fortune is now depicted as a "blind power and hence as completely careless and indiscriminate in the bestowal of her gifts. She is no longer seen as a potential friend, but simply as a pitiless force; her symbol is no longer the cornucopia, but rather the wheel of change which turns inexorably 'like the ebb and flow of the tide'" (ibid.: 29-30). Mongol ideas are closer to Skinner's depiction of pre-Christian beliefs and, indeed, have something in common with Montaigne's ([1580] 1991: 248) approving comment, criticized by his pious contemporaries, that Fortune can "play the artist" and hide a just outcome in seemingly random events. We will now describe how Urad Mongols engage with the deity of fortune, Siilde Tngri, pointing out the crucial differences between this deity and the goddess Fortune. The first thing to note is that the gendering is all male. For these Mongols, siilde fortune is seen not as a fickle goddess but as a power- ful male protector, to be bound to one's side, and is frequently depicted as light (beams, rays, glittering reflections). The various manifestations of siilde (deities, battle standards, flags, poles, tridents, etc.) are either explicitly or implicitly masculine, and furthermore the recipients of these kinds of fortune are male as well. So the subject position of the worshipper is that of sharing a common 'fortune substance' with the deity, rather than, as in the European case, chasing an ephemeral gift from an opposite. Gender ideas have changed in varying ways recently,14 but older Urad people still say that women should not approach or even look at the worshipped battle standard, nor should they participate in the subsequent mountain-top ritual for flying the wind-horse. In fact, women- especially sexually active women- are believed to be inimical to this kind of fortune; as an example, passing under women's underclothes hung out to dry can make a man's hiimori sag down. In this all-male context, deities of fortune, such as Siilde Tngri or the moun- tain god Mona Khan, are seen as basically positive entities. But they are also prone to move around and to absent themselves from the sky. Furthermore, they express 'anger' [urlali)- a. potential fury that is never doubted or criticized. Instead, the god is like a cosmic herder, with rage of a magnificent vastness: In the time when you rage with anger You mount the foggy clouds You flash the powerful fire You drive the storm of the wind You pasture flocks of black birds15 As late as the 1940s, the Urad Mongols held sacrifices to battle standards {siilde) before they went to war, and obviously these were singular events. To</page><page sequence="7">158 I Caroline Humphrey and Hürelbaatar Ujeed this day, they still hold regular sacrifices several times a year on set dates in order to 'raise' their siilde. The rituals are basically the same, although siilde in peaceful times is manifested in mountain gods and other deities as well as in battle standards. The seasonal rites take a less extreme and less frightening form than those gearing up for war. Instead of an ideally human sacrifice, the offering is an animal (an ox or a goat, in the cases we observed). The form of the rite and the texts to be chanted were composed by Mergen Gegen, an eighteenth-century Buddhist reincarnation, and they have not changed since then. We describe here the regular worship of the siilde deity, aiming to reveal what this tells us about the imagination involved in this kind of fortune. The rite has many sections, beginning with the invocation of a tutelary deity ( yidam burhan) by the lamas, who, by embodying this god, make themselves powerful enough to withstand the arrival of the Siilde Tngri. "You yourself become yidam burhan ," instructs the text. "Imagine light coming out from your heart and equally lighting the ten directions ... The place will become pure and full of various kinds of wisdom. In this way, bless the world ... giving great happiness, in all places from the clouds to the earth, and any gaps where light reaches and the sky are full- imagine it this way and bless the offerings" (Mergen Gegen Lubsangdambijalsan 1783). All those present then confirm that they follow "white deeds" and confess to sins of body, tongue, and mind. The human subject is thus set up as a virtuous person. Following this, the god of fortune is invited to descend so that the worshippers may exalt him and absorb his quality of siilde. This is done by means of glorification and imploring. Pro- claiming to the god "Your body's rays scatter light to various light-beams and rainbows" (ibid.), the prayer goes on to praise his helmet, armor, and weapons, the huge eagle floating over his head, his horse decorated with lion and tiger skins, the hunting dogs that follow him, and the magically changing soldiers of his retinue. What is interesting is the way that this god of fortune is attached to people, because unlike hishig, one does not possess siilde. Instead, one wills it to 'be with' one, as part of one's existence- all the while knowing, of course, that it is likely to disappear. This willing imploring is expressed in a remarkable series of cosmic similes of inseparability (ibid.): As the dragon's roar can only echo by bouncing off the clouds, may you con- descend to become [our] siilde without separating from us. Just as the power of the phoenix [Garudi bird] only soars because of its wings, become our siilde without leaving us. As a snow lion cannot exist without the snow mountain, become . . . As a raging tiger cannot live without its great forest, become ... As a mother must love her son, become ... As the sun and moon are necessary for there to be light, become . . . As the wish-fulfilling stone [chandamani] perfectly accomplishes things, become our siilde without separating from us. If the complex sacrificial rite accomplishes the flow of siilde from the deity to the people, this fervent wish to become fortunate- whose converse, the absence of fortune, is not mentioned - explains why a person does not 'have' siilde</page><page sequence="8">Fortune in the Wind | 159 (indeed, the expression siildetei [to have siilde] is not known among Urad Mongols). Rather the person is said to exist in the 'condition' of siilde or, as the Mongols say, to 'radiate' ( mandati ) siilde , a state that is imagined in terms of necessary relations that exist in the cosmos. While long texts are being chanted by Buddhist lamas near the summit of the mountain, the men who are the subjects of the ritual climb to the very peak. In tearing wind they erect a billowing, brightly colored canopy on a tall pole and make joyful libations of alcohol to it. This action is known as 'raising the siilde'. At similar mountain-top rites for raising the Black Siilde battle stan- dard in Mongolia, which is done on behalf of military or state groups, people call this "letting the sülde have fun."16 In Urad, the raising of the siilde is followed by a further rite, which is aimed to invigorate each person's hiimori. Now, rather than merely imagining a syn- chronic parallel between the force of the wind and the energizing of hiimori (as in the case of flying flags), there is direct contact between the body and the gusts of air. Acquiring Vitality Fortune ( Hiimori ) Bundles of papers printed with either a prancing, jewel-bearing horse or a thunderbolt17 have been prepared in advance. The rite is quite simple and done without chanted texts. It consists of each person taking a bunch of papers, going to the edge of the rocks, and tossing the papers high into the wind while silently praying for hiimori to arrive. The papers rise up like kites: the farther they fly, the greater the hiimori. The ritual ends with a wide gesture of open- ing the face, arms, and body to the sky, as if the subject were receiving the air into the self. In Urad regions, hiimori rites of various kinds are done on many occasions and not only after the raising of the siilde , so let us describe certain aspects of hiimori before returning to the question of the wind. Siilde fortune is needed in times of war or for self-fortification against enemies and difficulties, but having a 'high' wind-horse is good for all sorts of more practical matters. Before going on a long journey, moving into a new home, sealing a business deal, or taking an exam, people will go to a temple and ask a lama to chant the wind-horse text. Or if they have had a run of bad luck, they will buy a wind-horse flag and fly it near their home. On days when an astrologer predicts a person's wind- horse will be low, risky actions are to be avoided. People say that their own wind-horse (the one inside them) rises and 'lies down' of its own accord. Some people always appear to be lucky and to have a sparkle and confidence about them, so it is said that they must be hiimoritoi. Others seem to fail for no good reason, and in this case it is said that their wind- horse must be down. But a person's actions are believed to affect the situation, so an inexplicably misfortunate person must have committed some wicked, incorrect, or polluting deeds. What is interesting, however, is that 'right' and 'wrong' deeds may have nothing to do with Buddhist morality; instead, as with</page><page sequence="9">160 I Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed the siilde , they can be actions that align the self with cosmic movements. Thus, a mother will tell her children to get up in the morning just as the sun is rising, because that co-action with the sun will raise their hiimori. Conversely, on no account must they lie down, and especially not go to sleep, as the sun is set- ting, because that will make their hiimori lie down. Hiimori is particularly important in wrestling, horse racing, and hunting. Winning a wrestling match or killing a tricky animal demonstrates that you have hiimori. It is almost as if it is not T who wins but the indefinite vital for- tune within us all. This wavering spark of fortune can be cultivated by actions, as we have mentioned, and it is significant that the causality in 'fortune/suc- cess in hunting' can be reversed. Why go hunting, after all? Many Mongols have meat in abundance from their herds, yet they still hunt. Some people say that the purpose of hunting is to raise one's hiimori and that wrestling does the same. In Hiirelbaatar's village in Horchin in the 1970s-1980s, there was a 'hunting day' during which people would take leave of their exhausting and boring manual labor for the brigade. Almost all the men went hunting, although there were almost no wild animals because the region was now thor- oughly farmed and deforested. Even rabbits, partridges, and pheasants were rare. People set off in small groups, on foot, horseback, or donkeys, for outings that lasted the whole day. By nightfall, almost no one had caught anything, but people were excited and happy. They went hunting because the freedom and exercise of martial-like skills would raise their hiimori. It was similar with wrestling. Hiirelbaatar remembers that work teams were allowed a half-hour's rest during the long sessions of work in the fields. The workers from the nearby Chinese village would slump under a tree. By contrast, the Mongols, who were also physically exhausted, would spend the time wrestling with anyone in a happy-go-lucky way. Hiirelbaatar is sure that, if one had asked, people would have said that the wrestling raised their hiimori. Thus, it is the actual carrying out of these masculine pursuits- the invigoration and delight of doing them- that generates hiimori spirit and makes one fortunate. In these cases we see bodily involvement in making hiimori from within, and physical contact is also the way to acquire it from outside. The fortune- imbued sweat of a winning wrestler is smeared onto one's hands and touched to the forehead. In the case of racehorses - for it is the horse, not the jockey, that wins, Mongols say- the sweat of winners is scraped off and similarly smeared on a person's body and forehead. Even the scraper is a lucky thing to touch (Charlier 2010: 146). A five-year-old colt is regarded as being at the peak of equine energy. At the Mongolian national sports festival, when the front runners of the colts' race gallop up to the winning post, raising clouds of dust, spectators rush forward into the clouds, waving their arms exultantly as they beckon in the fortune-bearing dust to themselves.18 People who have migrated away from their birthplace can refresh their hiimori by returning home to roll in the earth at the place where their after- birth was buried. Having previously conveyed life to the fetus, yet discarded amid blood after the child is born, the afterbirth is powerful/polluted in the classic sense analyzed by Mary Douglas ([1966] 1988: chap. 6). It exemplifies</page><page sequence="10">Fortune in the Wind ' 161 the potency of transition/disorder that spoils an existing pattern but also pro- vides the materials for a new pattern out of its own inarticulacy. In Mongolian regions, after the birth has been safely accomplished, the placenta was, and in some areas still is, purified by a ritual conducted by mature, respected women. It can then be buried in a house-like shrine underground, whereupon this site becomes a source of siilde/hiimori to that child. The reader is now in a position to understand a Mongolian cartoon that satirizes the traditionalist behavior of country folk in the city. The cartoon depicts a place of birth ( töröh)-a maternity hospital in the city. A mother and midwife are looking out of the window in dismay because, before their eyes, a young man has undressed and is rolling in the earth. A policeman grabs him saying, "You shameless animal, frightening the mothers and doctors like that!" The man replies, "I was just trying to renew my siilde/hiimori by rolling at my birthplace!" Wind Let us now think about the wind of the wind-horse. If the world is full of chance, wind is the most emblematic representative of indeterminacy and fortuity.19 It is instructive to compare the Mongol ideas about wind with those of the Chinese. Kuriyama (1994) traces the evolution of Chinese imaginings about wind in rela- tion to developing ideas about the body. She shows that the very early fear of</page><page sequence="11">162 I Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed wind (from the eighteenth to the twelfth century bce)- when it was believed to cause cramps, headaches, dizziness, loss of speech, madness, and death - was later followed by a classification of winds according to direction. In this 'ratio- nalized' system, winds coming from a specific direction were associated with a fine-grained articulation of the body. But the menace of winds never entirely disappeared. They were believed to "drift around us wreaking violent, even fatal havoc deep within us" (ibid.: 23). The consequence of the rationalized emphasis on cosmic harmony, expressed by the idea of the 'eight winds and the four seasons', was to give rise to a heightened awareness of irregularity. What people actually did slipped and diverged so easily from the elaborate instructions for correct behavior, thus running counter to the spirit of the given seasonal wind. As Kuriyama puts it: "Individuals emerged as individuals in their propensity to slip into idiosyncratic cadences" (ibid.: 31). Kuriyama also documents that the notion of wind was related to the conceptual ancestor of qi (energy, vital breath), but the two never became identical. While qi energy was harnessed and cultivated meticulously within the yin-yang system, winds continued to disturb as well as to harmonize with the seasons. By contrast, although Mongols also say that certain particular winds may bring diseases or danger, they have an attitude toward the nature of wind as such that (as far as we know) does not exist in China. They positively embrace its fitful speed, the way that it can make things happen. There is a Mongolian riddle that goes as follows: [What is] the friend that makes the paper bird fly up into the sky, The go-between that catapults the sound of plucked music to the far distance, The decoration that makes a beautiful person even more beautiful [by adding color to their cheeks], The messenger that spreads the order everywhere, "It's time to have a drink!"? The answer is "the wind" (Ölziihutag and Gaadamba 1966: 32). One of the most popular songs in Inner Mongolia likens the transience of human life to the fleeting quality of the wind: The wind of the sky is not regular, The human-born body is not eternal. Who [actually] drank the holy water of eternity? So let us rejoice in the present free time. Other Mongolian songs and riddles compare the wind to horses running freely, needing no whips or bridles; to shapeless, meaningless, impossible things, like a camel with no neck; to something that makes things happen without being alive; and to the 'golden clamor' of heaven. Wind is often represented by onomatopoeic sounds. Interestingly, it is also likened to nomadic movement ( niiiidel ), that is, to the liminal mobility between the stops of nomads' camps. Thus, another riddle goes:</page><page sequence="12">Fortune in the Wind | 163 What is this? Hur! Hur! rumbles the migration coming and going, The brown stallion is galloping without reins. Again, the answer is "the wind" (Ölziihutag and Osor 1959: 21). So what we are suggesting is that Mongol nomads make a series of connec- tions: that the world is full of chance/hazard; that wind is the index of chance; and that they must not be afraid of chance, but rather- at certain times- align themselves (inspire themselves) with the wind. In this way, they can raise their fortune, which has the same indiscernible nature as chance itself. Conclusion In conclusion, we dwell on two points. The first is that the Mongol positive affirmation of chance is a process of diffusion of the self- that is, it transcends the delimited, materially organized self and thereby creates an impersonal kind of individuation. In these alignments with a current of air, just as 'wind' itself is not really something singular but a mass of indistinct swirls, affecting diverse bodies (gusting against flags, rocks, hair, faces, eyes, etc.), the one participating in this rite along with others becomes an impersonal diffused consciousness (see Khalfa 2000: 189-191). 20 A similar formlessness is evident in the other means through which this kind of fortune is transmitted to the physical body- light, dust, sweat, earth. In the Mongol rites for siilde and 'throwing' hiimori , the actor is still individuated in a way, but not in terms of his personality, name, or social status, for the entire imagination is ideally cast outward- to cosmic images, and to the abstraction of fortune. This is a con- sciousness without interiority- or perhaps it would be better to say, as Khalfa (ibid.: 197) puts it, that the current of air (or fortune) is exteriority floated into the voided space of the self. Hiirelbaatar's great-uncle lama, a devout Buddhist, instructed him that when throwing the himori papers, he should think silently of fortune coming not only to him but also to other people. One should throw many handfuls to include particularly enemies and people whom one has offended and indeed all sentient beings. How can this instruction be aligned with the voided self we have just mentioned? What great-uncle lama had in mind, he said, was bodhisattva consciousness- in other words, the compassionate mindfulness of any enlightened being, one that has been achieved precisely by working to eliminate the particularities of self. As we have indicated, this transcendental moment is anticipatory. We may therefore contrast these times of impersonal individuation at seasonal or oth- erwise regular rituals with actual events, by which we mean real, unpredicted, singular happenings that are historically and personally significant and that bring into focus distinct subjects at particular places and times (Humphrey 2008). By contrast, in these seasonal rituals, the impersonality of the wind seems to refer to an indiscernability beyond the horizon of socio-political life.</page><page sequence="13">164 I Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed Even though collectivities of people (clans, banners, even nations) are often the designated recipients of fortune, as well as individuals, they are all differenti- ated only in the same dimension, as more or less fortunate than one another- that is, by a quality that does not pertain to any of their social particularities, referring to what Morten Pedersen (2007: 316) has called the "unmarked terri- tory or void" of nomads. Our second point concerns this void. Comparing the nomadic landscape with that of settled farming people, Pedersen (2003: 238) has written that nomads highlight places at the expense of spaces, while people whose landscape is sedentary emphasize spaces at the expense of places. Whereas sedentary land- scapes are homogeneous, finite, and criss-crossed with boundaries, nomadic ones are heterogeneous and infinite. Nomads set up places- camps and ritual sites- that are imbued with spirit powers, but the spaces in between these places are "empty" (ibid.: 246). The nomadic migration partakes of this notional nothingness, since livelihood, personhood, and perspective all derive from the centers, the camps that are reproduced whenever people make a settlement. In such a world, nomadic migration is perceived as a spatial liminality, 'trav- eling that is not traveling' into and out of the otherness, which is, paradoxi- cally, a notional emptiness that serves as the foundation of the nomadic way of life (Humphrey 1995: 142-143). Pedersen (2007: 317) has confirmed that "the whole point about nomadic migration is for the world to repeat itself: one moves to be the same." In other words, migration repeatedly sets up one or more points of 'home' from which there can be points of view. The sites of the planting of the battle standard, the sacred cairn (oöoo), and the pole for wor- shipping the mountain god are 'places', but in a special way, for their sacred vertically oriented toward the sky offers not so much a viewing point on the everyday world as an opportunity for the visionary to glimpse the void. What we have tried to suggest here is that there may be something more to be said about this void, which is the condition of existence of the punctual points of the nomad camps. Perhaps its boundless emptiness in spatial terms involves for the Mongols also a notion of 'chance' or unpredictability in tem- poral and eventual terms. We have suggested that Mongols fortify themselves serendipitously against hazard and that in rites like those described above they indeed affirm and embrace chance in its manifestation as the wind. In doing this, they joyfully create a momentary experience in an indefinite non-locale, where good fortune can be imagined as a condition of existence, just as the dragon's roar booms only because the dragon is in the clouds. This might seem a scary prospect, but in our view such acts of 'going beyond' social personhood do not frighten the Mongols.21 Let us take just some of the images the ethnog- raphy has presented: the brown horse running without a bridle, the creaking sounds of the nomadic migration, the 'golden clamor' of heaven - each indexi- cal of the wind - the wrestlers flexing their muscles, the wolf and the swoop- ing eagle. All of these are grand, wonderful things. Are they not evocations of un-catchable movement, a way of thinking about fortune as freedom from limitation, a fortune capable of dealing with chance/hazard, to be attained by a subjectivity that temporarily forgets the socially bounded self?</page><page sequence="14">Fortune in the Wind | 165 Acknowledgments We are very grateful to Baasanjav Terbish, Giovanni da Col, Gregory Delaplace, Chuka Chuluiinbat, and Olga Shaglanova for helpful suggestions and comments.

For comparison with the similarly complex situation in Western Tibetan cultures, see da Col (2007). 4. Heshig (or kesig ) is found in the thirteenth-century Secret History of the Mongols in the sense of 'blessed' share of meat offerings to the ancestors (Atwood 2000: 113). 5. For the development of the complex of meanings of the word hesig (kesig) in different times and contexts, see Atwood (2000: 88-89, 110-114). 6. The information here refers to Halha and Inner Mongolia. In most Buryat (Buriyad) areas siilde is the 'life force' necessary to both males and females, and the military connota- tions, so strongly present in Halh, Urad, and Ordos, are almost absent. Couples desiring to have children make requests, often through a shaman, to be 'suffused' (shingeh) with the siilde of a child from a wide range of external objects (or their spirit-masters), such as trees, caves, fire, mountains, the sky, and springs. Infertility is regarded as disorder in the way that things should be and as the result of paying insufficient respect to the surrounding natural world (Skrynnikova and Batoeva 2002: 11-37). 7. The words siilde (Dmitriev 2010) and tug (or tugh) (Jagchid and Hyer 1979: 152) both have traceable roots in pre-Mongol Hirkic languages. 8. This idiom is known in Mongol as üyile-iin iire (lit. 'fruits/seeds of deeds'). 9. The Mongol notion of baigal (what is), rendered here as 'nature', differs from the Euro- pean idea in that it contains no hint of opposition to humanity but is rather inclusive of it.</page><page sequence="15">166 I Caroline Humphrey and Hiirelbaatar Ujeed 10. Chuluunbat, personal communication, 2011. 11. In the past, in far western rural Mongolia a hunter who had killed a wolf would take the carcass to the head of the administrative unit, who would offer congratulations, two or three sheep, and some alcohol, the idea being that the hiimori gained from this act would be "good for the nutag (homeland)" (Charlier 2010: 95). 12. Such immoral acts include sexual misdeeds, cruelty, killing, lying, and stealing. 13. Charlier (2010: 95). The birth of twins to cows, camels or mares is one such misfortune- bringing event. 14. In Buryatia, for example, after decades of Soviet education, it is now held that women also have hiimori (Olga Shaglanova, personal communication). 15. See Mergen Gegen's description of the mountain god Mona Khan in a collection edited by Galluu (Mergen Gegen Lubsanedambiialsan 1986: 707). 16. Chuluunbat, personal communication, 2011. 17. The papers in the ritual we attended were printed with the vchir (Skrt. vajra ) thunderbolt sign, which symbolizes speed and strength- the fastest way to reach your goal and the most powerful instrument to cut through obstacles on your way. 18. Chuluunbat, personal communication, 2011. 19. See the discussion of diverse practices and sensory experiences involving wind in Hsu and Low (2008). 20. As Khalfa (2000: 192) writes: "Deleuze notait à propos de l'individuation d'une phrase musicale dans le temps qu'il y a des individuations qui ne sont pas nécessairement celles d'une forme (quelque chose) ou d'un sujet (quelqu'un), '... l'individuation d'un pay- sage, ou bien d'une journée, ou bien d'une heure de la journée ou bien d'un événement. Midi-minuit, Minuit l'heure du crime, quel terrible cinq heures du soir, le vent, la mer, les énergies, sont des individuations de ce type'." 21. We would here disagree with Pedersen's (2007: 324) negative assessment when he describes the void as nothing other than the "virtual negativity of being." We suggest, rather, the possibility of an affirmation of the void. In this space, both bad and good may befall, and aligning oneself with the 'neutral' index of such chanciness (wind) is the best and bravest way forward. References Atwood, Christopher P. 2000.
