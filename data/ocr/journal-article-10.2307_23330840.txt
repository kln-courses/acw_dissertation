<plain_text><page sequence="1">The La Flesche Family: Native American Spirituality, Calvinism, and Presbyterian Missions by Kristin Herzog Calvinism at its best is a rather fine balance between reason and feeling, between what is definable human knowledge and what is ineffable divine mystery, between formal and experiential elements.1 Through . . . reexamination and . . . reorientation, it may become possible for native American traditions to serve as a reminder of forgotten or neglected dimensions latent within the European American's own heritage.2 WHEN PRESBYTERIAN MISSIONARIES of the Board of Foreign Missions worked among the Plains Indians during the 1840s and 1850s, they did not represent what Lefferts Loetscher calls "Calvinism at its best." They rather represented "the stripped-down missionary version of the Princeton Theology, essentially a theology of man's depravity and his justification by faith alone," with an emphasis on human reasoning powers that was more Baconian than Calvinist. They also presupposed that the republican virtues of hard work, thrift, literacy, and individual achievement were inseparable from the outward signs of Christian sanctification.3 It was assumed that "Euro-American greatness was a di rect product of the civilizing influence of the Gospel."4 Unless the Indian tribes could be civilized as well as christianized, they were doomed and damned. The de pravity and helplessness of all un converted human beings could be ob served, so to speak, in its raw form by see ing the ignorance, superstitions, and immoralities of Indian tribes. Such a view made it impossible, of course, to find any value in Native American beliefs and rites. While not representing "Calvinism at its best," Presbyterian missions to the Omaha certainly did not show Calvinism "at its worst." William Hamilton, the main missionary important for the context here discussed, was, for example, "a sensitive, poetic, idealistic, and yet practical man who combined . . . the determination of a frontiersman with the dauntless energy of a zealot."5 By the time he arrived at the Omahas, he had many years of experience through his work among the loways. He and his coworker, Samuel P. Irvin, had not only learned the loway language, but had translated into loway parts of the Bible, hymns, a grammar, a primer, and other works. "They also kept journals and wrote for newspapers, and they were sometimes used as authorities by later scholars. Their interpretations were perhaps biased. . . . Nevertheless, they .... were aware of the difficulties of recording the culture of an other people."6 Hamilton, for example, with great sensitivity observed and re corded a curing ceremony or a ritual pre ceding a war party. While his prejudice is obvious in phrases like the "blind way" of loway prayer, he does let the Indians' own Dr. Herzog of Durham, NC, is a writer and researcher in American literature and theology. American Presbyterians, 65:3 (Fall 1987)</page><page sequence="2">The La Flesche Family and Presbyterian Missions 223 voice come through in recording conver sations. "loway and white cultures existed side by side, meeting but infusing slightly to the frustration of the agent and mission aries."7 Hamilton and other Plains mis sionaries were pragmatic enough to know they could not simply cut off ail "pagan" notions and expect Indians to accept a "pure" Gospel. I would like to illustrate the intertwining of Christianity and the American Indian spirituality by presenting a case study of the outstanding Omaha La Flesche family and then ask the following questions: 1) To what extent can the fusion of Christian and "pagan" elements be compatible with "Calvinism at its best" ? 2) Can we say—in view of the La Flesche family—that Native American traditions can "serve as a re minder of forgotten or neglected dimen sions" latent within Calvinism?8 I When in 1856 William Hamilton tried to select a site for a new school for Omaha children, he was already a familiar figure for the tribe. He had been in charge of the mission school at Bellevue, Nebraska, es tablished almost a decade earlier by the Board of Foreign Missions. His knowledge of the loway language made it possible for him to converse, for example, with Joseph La Flesche, one of the most influential chiefs and traders of the tribe. "There were few other instances at that time," Norma Kidd Green writes, "when a white man and an Indian, without the presence of a third party, could talk directly and with as great understanding as could this chief and this missionary."9 Joseph La Flesche, Jr., or Iron Eye, was born about 1822 as the son of a French trader and an Indian woman. In the 1840s he married Mary Gale, daughter of a U.S. Army physician and a full-blood Indian mother who was descended from an Omaha chief. Both Joseph and Mary were well acquainted with white culture, but Jo seph chose to throw his lot completely with the Omaha tribe when its chief Big Elk selected him as his successor, realizing that it needed a man of Joseph's vision and qualification to keep the tribe from total annihilation in view of what he called the oncoming "flood" of white culture. The Omahas' position was increasingly vulner able. In 1854 they had ceded to the U.S. government their hunting grounds north of the Platte and west of the Missouri. In exchange they received some 300,000 acres bordering on the Missouri about seventy miles north of the present city of Omaha. But here they were scared of their age-old enemies, the Sioux; the govern ment refused to pay some promised annu ities in cash instead of commodities; the tribal structure was being eroded by the government's installing of "paper chiefs" who did the agents' bidding, and the sale of liquor introduced by white traders un dermined the health of the tribe. How ever, tribal culture was kept alive, rites were being performed as ever, and the annual hunt—a sacred ritual and a means of survival for another year—took place in spite of the diminishing number of buffa loes and white attempts to turn nomad culture into agriculture in order to secure more land for white settlers. Iron Eye was farsighted enough to realize that without education in white ways the tribe had no means of defending its rights and surviv ing. He drew about him a group of pro gressive people known as "the young men's party." He built himself a model home on a par with white frontier struc tures of the time to encourage others also to move out of their earth lodges into modern homes; and he established a po lice force to be in charge of tribal order regarding the prohibition of drinking, gambling, and truancy of school children. He pleaded with the government for cash payments instead of commodities, sup ported the Presbyterian Mission by having large gatherings at his own house, and gave generously of his own resources whenever the tribe was in need of food. He spoke little English, but tried to learn it</page><page sequence="3">224 American Presbyterians Meanwhile, his health continued to be endangered by the crude amputation. But in 1861 permission was granted for Joseph to lead a delegation to Washington to dis cuss the complete fulfillment of the 1854 treaty and then go to New York, have proper surgical care, and be fitted with a cork leg. When he returned, he gave a feast for the chiefs of the tribe and over whelmed them with a dramatic presenta tion of the white people's ingenuity by presenting his artificial leg and a small electric device he had brought along. from the Reverend Charles Sturgis, a de voted missionary who was put in charge of the new reservation school in 1857. When in 1859 Joseph stepped on a nail, ne glected the wound, and got such a bad infection that the leg had to be amputated, he asked Sturgis to pray for him: if he was to die, he asked that God would still be his friend; if he was to get well, that God would help him to "live in the good road." From that time on, he asked for "God's Book" to be explained to him.10 Army. When hundreds of Winnebagos and later the whole Ponca tribe sought temporary refuge with the Omahas, it was Joseph who gave them a set of laws by which to live (no dancing, gambling or drinking) and who shared all he could in resources. But when the Winnebagos were to be legally settled on Omaha lands, and when later the Nebraska Legislature passed an act to force the removal of all Indians from the state, tensions in the tribe could no longer be controlled, gos sip and intrigue increased, and a new agent simply removed Joseph from office. For a while he left the reservation with his family, but returned later and continued to be an unofficial leader until his death in 1889. However, Joseph never took over new ideas without much thought. It was not until years later, when William Hamilton was back at the mission, that Joseph for mally joined the church. One day Hamilton read to him, "My kingdom is not of this world." Joseph said that... he must think that over. Days later he returned and said he saw that the Book told two things. It taught how to do things in order that men could live on the earth that was for the body, but that it also taught things for the heart. He realized that he could tell a man to build a house and to live there instead of in a tent, but he could not tell that man to have a good heart and the man's heart would be good. He thought only God could do that.11 Joseph's increasing interest in the mis sionaries' teachings developed at a time when he was hit by opposition and failure. Conservative leaders of the tribe resented his power and his cooperation with whites. His oldest son Louis died at the age of twelve in 1860. The Civil War brought new tensions; nearly one hun dred Omahas were serving in the Union Iron Eye's relationship to William Hamil ton was at times strained, partly on ac count of cultural misperceptions. But they always reconciled again, and Hamilton was most understanding in a very sensitive matter: Joseph had at least two more wives beside Mary. It was the custom for men of higher standing to take more wives as the social obligations of a distinguished family increased to the point where one wife could no longer cope with all the re sponsibilities. Also, widows and fatherless women were cared for through multiple marriages. Under pressure from the mis sion, Joseph dismissed one wife. But he was allowed to remain married to Ta-in-ne, an Omaha, who bore him at least three of his eight children.12 There were other in stances in which his conscience was se verely tested because two cultures and two belief systems clashed head-on, and in each case he made a deliberate, well thought-out decision for or against retain ing traditional ways. At least his children Susette and Francis went through the beautiful Omaha ceremony called "The Turning of the Child." When later Francis became an anthropologist, he described the rite in detail. Newborn children had only baby names, but when they were about four, they underwent a naming ceremony. The mother accompanied the</page><page sequence="4">The La Flesche Family and Presbyterian Missions 225 ical work discussed the rite with Osage informant, he was told: child to the ceremonial tent, then asked the boy or girl to walk alone toward the priest, carrying a new pair of moccasins. The whole tribe watched the open tent in which a stone had been placed east of a fire. After the mother asked the priest for blessing and protection, the priest ad dressed the child: You shall reach the fourth hill sighing; you shall be bowed over, you shall have wrinkles; your staff shall bend under your weight. I speak to you that you may be strong. Under various songs and prayers the priest then turned the child in four direc tions, symbolizing the four winds which it would have to face in life. He let the child's feet rest upon the sacred stone, put the new moccasins on, and ended the ceremony by announcing the new name of the child to the whole creation: "Ye hills, ye grass, ye trees, ye creeping things both great and small, I bid you hear! "13 As the La Flesche children grew up and Joseph's awareness of Christian beliefs in creased, he had to make more difficult decisions concerning participation in Omaha rituals. He often declined to take part in the hunt in order to show his peo ple that they could no longer rely on the hunt for sustenance. But his attitude was considered a sacrilege by many. When the time came that his daughter Susette was to receive the "mark of honor," signifying that she would belong to the most distin guished women of the tribe, he could not bring himself to consent. The "mark of honor" implied tattoos on forehead, chest, and the back of the hands, and he did not want his daughters, whom he ex pected to move in white society, to be marked in such a way. But giving up a prestigious custom meant also giving up an ancient faith. The round spot put upon the forehead was the symbol of the sun; the mark on the chest rep resented the morning star; the picture of the turtle on the back of the hand meant a long, well-protected, and fruitful life.14 When Francis La Flesche in his ethnolog We know that the acts themselves have no mystic force, for gradually it became clear to me that the rite as a whole was of a cosmic character; that it was a dramatization of the movements of certain cosmic forces whose combined power brought forth material life upon the earth and set it in perpetual motion.15 There are indications that Joseph also sent out his son Francis on the vision quest.16 This lonely vigil of fasting and praying for four days and four nights alone in the hills was required of every male and took place when the youth was "old enough to know sorrow." Every young Omaha knew the beginning prayer song: U Oreat Mysterious Power, I stand here, humble and needy, Praying to Ihee. If the youth tell in a trance or seemed to see or hear anything unusual, it appeared to be the answer to his pleas."17 The vision was said to be accompanied by a special rhythm, cadence, or song, which would remain that person's individual con nection with divine powers for the rest of his life, but would never be spoken of to others. Overall, Joseph took care that his chil dren grew up with the traditional Omaha reverence toward the mysterious forces of nature. His daughter Susette would al ways remember that he taught her a gentle lesson when as a little girl she had been given a small bird which she loved to feed and play with. He asked her to put it care fully on the ground, away from tents and people, and to say: "God, I give you back your little bird. Have pity on your bird."18 Philosophically, Joseph remained an Omaha, always basing his beliefs and ac tions on careful thought. The Sacred Leg end of the Omaha, describing the creation and the history of the tribe, places special value on serious thinking. Whatever pre dicament the people found themselves in, whatever betterment they invented throughout their history, the resulting change would always be introduced by</page><page sequence="5">226 American Presbyterians the ritual phrase, "And the people thought."19 Joseph became a strong member of the small Presbyterian church at the Agency; he learned from "God's Book." But he also selectively retained some of the tribal faith structures. His children as well as the "Young Men's Party" he influenced car ried on this heritage. When various Quaker agents came to the reservation during President Grant's Peace Policy, they were puzzled about their inability to make the Omaha adapt more perfectly to white culture. It may be partly due to the sympathetic attitude of Presbyterian mis sionaries that "the Omaha refused to fully mimic the white way of life, even though they took allotments, built houses, and sent their children to school,"20 and yet were able to become active and influential Christians. Of the seven La Flesche children who reached maturity, four were the daughters of Mary Gale. Together with Joseph, Mary had always been open to the missionaries' teachings and gradually considered her self a Christian. The daughters without ex ception became outstanding personalities who combined deep loyalty to the tribe with dedicated Presbyterianism. Susette (1854-1903) was a writer, book illustrator, Indian Rights activist, and famous lec turer. Rosalie (1861-1900) became an ac complished business woman on the re servation and a beloved hostess, friend, and consultant for Indians as well as whites. Marguerite (1862-1945) was a teacher, and her home became a center for many church organizations and com munity projects. Susan (1865-1915) was the first American Indian woman physician, the first American Indian to be appointed as missionary by the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions, and a lecturer.21 Of the three children by Ta-in-ne, only the life of Francis (1857-1932) is well docu mented.22 His extensive research on the Omahas in cooperation with the anthro pologist Alice Fletcher, and his own work on the Osage tribe made him a famous author who was elected to membership in the Washington Academy of Science and who received the honorary degree of Doc tor of Letters from the University of Ne braska in 1926. The other two children, Lucy (1865-1923) and Carey (1872-1952), like Marguerite and Susan, attended the Hampton Industrial and Agricultural Insti tute before returning to the reservation. None of the seven children ever severed their ties to the tribe, although they moved very much among white people. II Here the innumerable achievements of the La Flesche children are considered only insofar as they are relevant for the fusion of Native American and Presbyte rian spirituality in this family. Emphasis is given Susette and Francis, with some at tention to Susan, because they became most known to a wider public. Susette, like the younger children, grew up with tales from the mythic Omaha past as much as with biblical stories, endlessly long sermons, the Shorter Catechism, and hymns and prayers in the Omaha lan guage and in English.23 She had to learn that Jesus, Wakondizhinge, was the son of Wakonda—a very strange idea in terms of Omaha traditions.24 Around the age of twelve, Susette had learned so well in the mission school that she could help Rev. Burtt with learning Omaha and writing hymns, the Lord's Prayer, and short ser mons in the tribal language. When a new agent, a Quaker, in 1869 closed the mis sion school, Susette was left without schooling. But Hamilton offered her his library books. "She waded through huge volumes of ecclesiastical history and Cal vinist theology," Dorothy Clarke Wilson notes. "She read the Bible and Shake speare from cover to cover."25 Through connections of the mission she was finally able to study at the Elizabeth Institute in New Jersey. When in 1875 she left the school as an honor graduate, she was more than ever a creature of two</page><page sequence="6">The La Flesche Family and Presbyterian Missions 227 worlds, no longer at home in either and yet committed to both. Back at the reser vation, she had to fight discrimination be fore being appointed as teacher at the Agency. With Hamilton's help she started a small Sunday school and saved enough money from her meager salary (half that of white teachers) to purchase a little organ. Meanwhile, the people on the reserva tion were restless and scared because their relatives, the Poncas, were in a des perate situation, and the Omaha feared a similar fate. The U.S. government had negligently ceded the Ponca reservation to their enemies, the Teton Sioux. The forced removal of the Poncas to southern territory in 1877 caused such tragedies that it became a cause célébré among white reformers. When the Ponca chief Stand ing Bear and some of his people tried to seek refuge among their relatives, the Omahas, federal troops arrived to arrest them. But a group of concerned citizens could legally prevent the arrest. The trial that followed produced a landmark deci sion in favor of Indians' civil rights and was widely publicized by Thomas Henry Tibbies, a white man and an assistant edi tor of the Omaha Herald. He organized a lecture tour for Standing Bear, Susette, and her brother Francis; and so Bright Eyes, as Susette was called in Omaha, be came an extremely popular lecturer publi cizing the plight of the Poncas in Boston, Philadelphia, and other cities. In 1881 Congress finally ordered repayment and choice of allotments of land parcels for the Poncas. Susette married the widower Tibbies the same year. From then on, the two of them would fight for Indian rights through books and articles. They fought specifically for allotment and Indian citizenship, because only by these means could forced removal be prevented. We do not know how many of Susette's writings are lost under anonymous news paper articles or incorporated in her husband's books. We do know that she gathered material for him, wrote an intro duction for one of his works, and contin ued to lecture with him, even after the Dawes Act made allotment a legal fact. On a lecture tour with Tibbies to England, Bright Eyes became a European celebrity.26 In spite of all her activities in the realm of white politics and white churches, Susette was mostly concerned with pre serving her tribal heritage. She wrote and illustrated Omaha legends. The issue of keeping alive the tradition was for her not simply a secular, "ethnic" one. In 1888 she wrote: It is more than ten years since we went on our last hunt. The poles of the holy tent remain. There is no one who remembers the sacred words which were said at the feast preparatory to the start. . . . Soon we can no more tell to which band we belong than can a Jew of today tell whether he is of the tribe of Judah or the tribe of Benjamin.27 A faith was being obliterated along with a culture. That loss led to a feeling of ambi guity. In a story for white children Susette writes: "I often wonder if there is anything in your civilization which will make good to us what we have lost. I sometimes think not, unless it be the wider, fuller knowl edge of God and his Word."28 If anything was tying the two strands of American Indian and Presbyterian faith together, it was the understanding of the Word's power. Ritual words created reality; a shaman's word healed diseases; a sacred song drove away evil spirits. Without the life-giving words of tribal legends, passed on from one generation to the next, there would be no community. Likewise it was above all the Word which Presbyterian mission aries brought to the Indians. It was by the power of her own words reflecting the Word that Susette could gather public support for her people. Her intensive fight for Indian rights was certainly influenced by democratic ideals, but much more by two strands of faith: in her tribal tradi tion, human justice was completely fused with divine justice, and she learned the same message from the biblical prophets. When Helen Hunt Jackson was surprised that Bright Eyes coined the poignant</page><page sequence="7">228 American Presbyterians If we turn from Susette to Francis La Flesche, the development from Omaha faith to Presbyterianism ends up in a more complex way, partly because he lived longer (she died in 1903 and he in 1932) and partly because as a scholar of anthro pology he was more than Susette im mersed in rationalistic science as well as traditional ritualism. He joined the Ma sonic Order and became a supporter of the Native American Church, but his Pres byterian heritage distinctly shaped his life and work. phrase, "Law is liberty," she may not have realized how much Susette expressed here a Calvinist notion as well as a tribal understanding of law.29 considered a sacrilege in terms of Omaha beliefs, and even though in several in stances informants died soon after they had divulged their secrets. It must have caused alarm and bad rumors when Jo seph La Flesche died suddenly in 1888 after the Omaha Sacred Pole had been transferred out of tribal hands to the Pea body Museum at Harvard at the instigation of his son Francis.33 Francis was the first professional Ameri can Indian anthropologist. He grew up in traditional ways. "Francis acted the role of the Sacred Child in the Wawan or pipe ceremony before he was ten, and he served as runner on one of the last tribal buffalo hunts before he was twenty."30 On the lecture tour with Susette and Standing Bear in 1879-80 he met the an thropologist Alice C. Fletcher and the lin guist James Owen Dorsey who both would deeply influence his life. By 1881, after a brief unhappy marriage on the res ervation, he became a copyist in the Washington Office of Indian Affairs. After Alice Fletcher visited the Omaha reserva tion for the first time in 1882, she soon began to use Francis as a field assistant, informant, and interpreter. The relation ship grew into a full collaboration and cul minated in their common work, The Omaha Tribe. On his own, he wrote many important articles and a monumental work on the Osage tribe.31 In 1900 he pub lished a book of reminiscences about his Presbyterian Mission Schooling, The Mid dle Five.32 Until 1881, Francis had been active in the Presbyterian Church on the reservation. Rosalie and Frank had been the mainstays of the Sabbath School, teaching the smaller boys and girls and those who knew the least English. They used the Catechism as a text and on it built a combined study of language and reli gion. Frank also was an elder in the church, and [Superintendent] Partch spoke highly of them both as teachers.34 In Washington Francis studied law and re ceived his L.L.M. degree in 1893. Two years earlier he had been legally adopted by Alice Fletcher. He moved freely in the Washington scientific scene and in Pan Indian affairs. In Washington as well as during field work in Oklahoma he associ ated with Masonic groups. His growing distance from Christian missions was caused by the tensions between the differ ent worlds which he combined. The Christian party viewed most anthropolo gists with the deepest suspicion, especially those connected with the Bureau of American Ethnology. These men were believed to be conspiring selfishly to keep the Indian in "the blanket" as ethnological specimens for further research.35 The growing influence of religious Pan Indianism, culminating in the Ghost Dance and later in the Native American Church, also left an impression on a man deeply committed to Indian identity in the white world. It was Francis's greatest achievement that at a time when the ancient rites were fast fading from the memory of the tribe, he was able to persuade some of the oldest members to entrust him with the details of those rituals, even if that was After the massacre of Wounded Knee, the millenialism of the Ghost Dance was crushed. The secular Pan-lndianists and the political Indian Rights organizations sided with the missionaries in seeing no value whatsoever in Indian religions. In</page><page sequence="8">The La Flesche Family and Presbyterian Missions 229 this religious vacuum the peyote cult, originally at home among the Aztecs, could rapidly spread. It involved the ritual use of a cactus button which had narcotic effects. Peyotism became so thoroughly fused with Christian elements that it evolved into the "Native American Church," incorporated in Oklahoma in 1918 in order to defend the rights of Indian religious identity. In the congressional hearings of 1918 on the legality of peyote in religious observance, Francis La Flesche played an important role. He testified that the peyote religion had caused a moral regeneration of the Omaha, following a period after allotment when drunkenness and lawlessness prevailed on the reserva tion and when the Indian Bureau, the In dian Rights organizations, and the mis sionaries did "absolutely nothing." The Omahas, he explained, could not understand the white man s religion ; it was a thing too intricate for them. . . . But the teaching of this new religion was something that they could understand. "The peyote," they said, helped them to think intelligently of God and of their relations to Him. At the meetings of this new religion is taught the avoidance of stealing, lying, drunkenness, adultery, assaultism. . . . People are taught to be kind and loving to one another.36 La Flesche also quoted his sister Susan, a physician, as describing the good effects of the peyote religion: the people have "quit drinking. They pray intelligently, they pray to God, they pray to Jesus, . . . they ask help from God." In his intensive study of the Osage tribe, he himself had found that the morals of the peyotists "compared favorably with those of the white people."37 While prohibition of peyote did not suc ceed on the national level, several states outlawed it in the 1920s. But the forces of reform led by John Collier gradually brought about—at least in principle—the protection of all Indian religions, includ ing peyotism. Many Indians did not regard membership in the peyote religion and in a more orthodox Christianity as mutually exclusive. Members of all denominations could be found in the Native American Church. The Nebraska group put special emphasis on the teaching of Scriptures, a trait which certainly made the movement more acceptable to Presbyterians. Also, peyotism filled a need which Presbyteri ans (and other denominations) ignored: it emphasized healing ceremonies and it in corporated the ancient vision quest into its worship practices. It is indicative of Francis La Flesche s life in contrasting worlds that the chief's son who had been an elder in the Presbyterian Church received three burial services after his death on the reservation in 1932. The first was led by Amos Lamson ot the Latter Day Saints; then, at the cemetery, the Masonic Order conducted a graveside service. . . . After the white people left, the Indians performed their rites. ... In closing, Henry Morris, after removing his shoes, offered a long prayer in Omaha. The youngest La Flesche daughter, Susan, and her sister Marguerite followed in Susette's footsteps by studying at the Eliz abeth Institute for three years. On their return, they worked at the mission school which had been reopened in 1879. After two years they left again to attend Hamp ton Institute. Susan graduated with high est honors in 1886 and went on to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylva nia. She again finished at the head of her class, returned to the reservation, and be came its only physician, serving the tribe by night and day, travelling on horseback in every weather. She married Henri Picotte, who was Sioux and French, in 1894 and had two sons, but Henri died eleven years later. In 1905 she was called by the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions to become a missionary to her tribe, and she served the Omaha Blackbird Hills Church. Besides being a physician, a leading citi zen, legal advocate, temperance speaker, and founder of a hospital, she was a committed Presbyterian all her life. In her early years she acted as an interpreter at Indian services and taught Sunday school. As a missionary she became a teacher,</page><page sequence="9">230 American Presbyterians preacher, and field worker under whom the Blackbird Hills Church grew consider ably.39 The young people she taught in Sunday school wondered "where her power lay, beyond a thorough knowledge of the biblical text. In some way she made the ancient stories alive and fraught with meaning for the moment."40 Flesche. In some sense, simply to glorify and enjoy God must have been a great relief for the Omahas, since the slightest infraction of ritual obligations—even by accident—was thought to cause illness and death. When Dr. Susan Picotte died in 1915 at the age of only fifty, three presbyterian ministers officiated at her funeral, but the closing prayer was given in the Omaha language by one of the older members of the tribe. Ml In view of the intertwining of Presbyte rian and Omaha spirituality in the La Flesche family, we can now answer the central questions more specifically: 1) To what extent can the fusion of Christian and "pagan" elements be compatible with "Calvinism at its best"? The saving factor amidst the Presbyte rian missionaries' cultural, political, and theological prejudices was their convic tion that the Indians had a human and Christian potential.41 Their theology, however, still presupposed the utter deg radation of the heathen and confronted them with the demand : accept the Gospel or be damned. When Indians accepted Presbyterianism, however, they usually retained an instinctive appreciation of their traditions and could judge the Bible or the Shorter Catechism on their own terms. They could find in the catechism various convictions which did not clash with their own faith structures: a) "Man's chief end ... to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever" must have ap peared narrow for Indian thought since all creatures witnessed to divine spirit and power, but it did not conflict with Indian beliefs. While the conception of Wakonda was not as "personal" as that of the Chris tian Cod, "certain anthropomorphic attri butes were ascribed to it, approximating to a kind of personality," writes Francis La b) The power of the Word, though un derstood as unwritten and uncodified in their tradition, must have appealed to the Omahas. The amount of ritual words which they retained by heart is hardly imaginable to the western mind.43 c) God's providence and "foreordain ing" coincided with an Indian tendency toward fatalism.44 d) While "original sin" must have been a difficult concept, the Omahas had a natural understanding of infractions of the "moral law" which the cate chism sees "comprehended in the Ten Commandments." e) While redemption through Christ was also hard to understand, all Christian ized Plains Indians were aware of a deep connection between their rituals of self sacrifice, mutilation, and suffering, as a means of creating a bond with the super natural powers, and the crucifixion of Christ.45 f) Prayer was something the Indians had always lived by. Francis La Flesche reports of the Osage tribe that at dawn men, women, and children stood in the doors of their houses uttering their cries for di vine help. They repeated their prayer at noon and evening.46 When Sara Kinney, a distinguished friend of Indians from Hart ford, reported on her visit to Rosalie La Flesche's home in Nebraska in 1891, she described the table prayer: "a little chap of nine years . . . asked the blessing with as much ease and reverence as a member of the Hartford theological fraternity."47 These are just a few of the "compa tibles" which the missionaries could have built on—like the Jesuits of the seven teenth century who gradually reshaped Indian ways toward closer approximation of a Christian norm.48 These common de nominators make it understandable that</page><page sequence="10">The La Flesche Family and Presbyterian Missions 231 all members of the La Flesche family ex cept Francis remained committed to Pres byterianism while retaining certain tribal beliefs. Joseph as the first convert is an obvious example. Susette was grateful for the biblical Word, but felt the need to pre serve Omaha legends. Susan led a Presby terian church, but defended peyotism. While Francis in his later life distanced himself from the Presbyterians, the book on his mission school training reflects his critical appreciation of some Presbyterian traits while rejecting others. While he "heavily imbued his book with Omaha spiritual and ethical values,"49 he did not castigate the Presbyterians the way his contemporary, the Sioux Gertude Bonnin, derided the Roman Catholic missionaries who taught her.50 Also, his work on the Osage, beside his other writings, reflects a critical empathy for aboriginal religion which most likely was influenced by the soberness and serious commitment of Presbyterian missionaries. Comparing the careful descriptions of curing ceremonies by William Hamilton and Francis La Flesche shows definite similarities.51 Be fore Francis translated sacred songs from the Omaha and Osage languages, Hamil ton and Irvin had translated Christian hymns into loway. They published a dic tionary before he did. Francis's turn to Masonry and his defense of peyotism may have satisfied an Omaha mysticism and sense of ritual in him which was sup pressed by a dogmatic and non-liturgical Presbyterianism. But the "compatibility" of certain traits of Presbyterian and Omaha spirituality is clear even from Fran cis' life. To the extent that Omaha rites did not contradict basic biblical and Presbyte rian tenets, they could coexist. the believer,52 then Presbyterians could have tied into the mystical tendencies of the Indian mind. They also might have learned from the deep Indian sense of hu man ties to the whole of creation. Calvin ism was originally creation-centered as well as salvation-centered. God also "executeth his decrees in the works of cre ation," as the Shorter Catechism says. By suppressing "myths which speak of the union of the earth and the sky,"53 the mis sionaries also suppressed a feminine ele ment of the divine. A purely male Cod "in charge" of the creation, but without es sential ties to the mothering earth, was a foreshortening of the biblical God.54 2) Can we say—in view of the La Flesche family—that Native American traditions can "serve as a reminder of forgotten or neglected dimensions" latent within Calvinism? If Wilhelm Niesei is right in stating that the center of Calvinism is not predestina tion, but the mystical union of Christ with Another aspect ot Indian religions which might have drawn the missionaries back to their own roots is the Indian un derstanding of sacrament and ceremony: "There was a lot more ceremony or action than verbal instructions in Indian activi ties, like the medicine pipe ceremony. In the Protestant church there is a lot of verbal direction and less action."55 The missionaries' Princeton Theology tended toward a more abstract, more Zwinglian understanding of the Eucharist,56 whereas Calvin's understanding, as Nevin had rediscovered it, would have been more compatible with Indian instincts. The Omahas might have had less need to turn to peyotism, had their protestantism been less abstract. "Native understanding is predominantly experiential, i.e., based on visions, rather than theological; the situa tion is reversed in Euro-American cul ture."57 Mystery, experience, and vision are "neglected dimensions" latent within Calvinism.
