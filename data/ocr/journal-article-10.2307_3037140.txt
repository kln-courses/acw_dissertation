<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOR TYROS &amp; LAICS THE SEX IMPERATIVE: AN EVOLUTIONARY TALE OF SEXUAL SURVIVAL. By Kenneth Maxwell. Plenum Press, New York. $24.95. viii + 324 p.; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-306-44649-9. 1994. This is an eclectic collection of 19 chapters that are rather tenuously connected by the common theme of exchange of genetic material between or- ganisms. The "sex imperative," which Maxwell de- fines as "the need for constant stirring of the genetic pot by sexual recombination of genes" (p. 26), en- compasses the evolution of DNA, microorganisms, sex, sex organs, and sexual behavior. Maxwell be- gins with the evolution of life (Chapter 1), and then presents a brief and whimsical account of the evolution of sex: "Sex was invented by microbes, and for whatever reason, the habit caught on" (Chap- ter 2, p. 18). Successive chapters then discuss single- cell sex, gametes, sex in wet and dry environments, the penis, sex in large vertebrates, parthenogene- sis, pheromones and perfumes, gonads and sex organs, biological clocks, modem reproductive tech- nologies, and finally, molecular biology and bio- technology. Disappointingly, Maxwell presents neither a com- prehensive review nor a critique of his subjects. Instead, each chapter contains very few examples, presented superficially and in most cases without reference to primary sources. For example, the chapter entitled "The dry connection" is dominated by lengthy descriptions of black widow spiders and emperor penguins, and really does not deal with the general adaptation of sexual reproduction to terrestrial habitats. Similarly, the chapter entitled "The gametes" is dominated by eight pages on hu- man sperm, while the very current and interesting questions of the origins of gametes, and evolution of anisogamy are virtually ignored. The use of few examples with a strong emphasis on well-known organisms, such as humans, whales, elephants, and ants, and the lack of theory or critique are reminis- cent of popular science forums such as the television series "Nature" or "Nova." If Maxwell is indeed aiming at a similar audience, he can be forgiven for his lack of rigor. The format of the book (small print with very few illustrations), however, suggests a more technical, expert audience, and for such readers, the book will be a great disappointment.</page><page sequence="2">MARCH 1995 NEWBIOLOGICAL BOOKS 65 Unfortunately for both the general and expert reader, the book is flawed by more than superficial- ity. In his choice of examples and of descriptive lan- guage, Maxwell consistently reveals a strongly an- thropocentric, anthropomorphic, and male-oriented view of evolution that is no longer acceptable in evolutionary thought. Organisms are described in terms fraught with human implications: Microbes are "shamelessly promiscuous" (p. 47); black widow spiders "murder" their mates (p. 87); insects en- gage in "uninhibited sexual activity" (p. 31); "sex- less" female worker bees are "vengeful" when they attack male drones (p. 97); social insects "are the most sexist societies on earth" (p. 96); birds are "the most lovable-and loving- animals" (p. 98); and emperor penguins show "warmth . .. loyalty and devotion" (p. 100). Often the anthropocentrism is blatant, as in the following: "In view of the vaunted and sometimes flaunted sexual supremacy of the human species, the presence or absence of a bacu- lum may be of trivial evolutionary significance" (p. 114), or " The lowland gorilla is an anthropoid ape in an advanced position on the evolutionary ladder near that of humans" (p. 227). The human male bias is also less than subtle: More than half of the chapter on gametes is devoted to human sperm (eggs of all organisms get one page); an entire chapter is devoted to penises (the evolution of female genital tracts is ignored); and the chapter on gonads is dominated by sections on "testicles" (four-and-a-half pages), dominance of male hor- mones, and male homosexuality. Maxwell is not shy about letting his biases show. He comments, for example, that parthenogenesis is the "path to sexual oblivion," the discovery of which "caused the stout walls of male indispensability to tremble and crumble . . ." (p. 162). Such a development in humans is viewed as "a fate too horrible to con- template" (p. 164). Some of these statements are amusing. For ex- ample, we are told that "men's genitals are attrac- tive targets" for female black widow spiders (p. 90), and that "perceptive physicians know that there is probably more secret anxiety among men about the size of their penises than among women about the size of their breasts" (p. 116). The relevance of such statements, however, is questionable. The pervasiveness of these biases in a book pur- porting to present modern evolutionary thought in the 1990s is lamentable. Although the level of thought and the style of writing make the book most appropriate for a general audience, the biases apparent to an expert reader will not be as obvious to the nonexpert, and render the book a very poor ambassador for modern evolutionary biology.
