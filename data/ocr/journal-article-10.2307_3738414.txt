<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. G. SEBALD'S PAINTERS: THE FUNCTION OF FINE ART IN HIS PROSE WORKS W. G. Sebald's highly sophisticated play with intermediality is the subject of a growing number of scholarly papers. Given the prominence of images in his prose writings, this is hardly surprising: the first prose narrative, Schwindel. Gefilhle., opens with a photographic reproduction of a historical sketch which portrays Napoleon's crossing ofthe Alps in 1800; likewise Die Ausgewanderten begins with an image, the photograph of a cemetery in the shadow of what appears to be an oak tree. At the opening of Die Ringe des Saturn the reader encounters a photograph of the sky seen through a grid-like window. Although no image precedes Austerlitz's story in the eponymous novel, the reader en? counters a first set of photographs, four pairs of inquisitive eyes, just two and a half pages into the narrative proper. In total the four prose texts contain more than three hundred photographs and reproductions of works of art.1 The sheer number of images thus raises the question of their purpose in the narrative. What precisely is the relationship between text and image in Sebald's ceuvre? As many readers have noticed, the answer to this question is far from simple since the various images fall into different categories: while there are many emotionally charged images, such as family photographs or portraits which often depict lost family members or loved ones, a second range of images does not appear to bear any relationship to the text. Other photographs are simply banal in that they reproduce everyday objects which are mentioned in the narrative, such as the narrator's ticket, passport, or restaurant bill; and a fourth category appears to be deliberately poor in quality, depicting stark buildings or empty landscapes which exude an uncanny and hostile atmosphere. Scholars have responded to the intermedial challenge posed in Sebald's work by focusing on his use of photography. Most prominent are studies that follow in the footsteps of Roland Barthes's seminal reflections on photography in La Chambre claire.2 Stefanie Harris, Jonathan Long, and Carolin Duttlinger have, to varying degrees, all demonstrated that the photographs in Sebald's narratives tend to exceed the symbolic code of the narrative; instead of simply providing documentary evidence for the story proper, they often unsettle the relationship between text and image. Jonathan Long speaks of the 'ontological hide-and- seek that Sebald plays with his reader which invites and thwarts attempts to 1 The precise figure depends on one's understanding of what constitutes an image. There is a degree of ambiguity in all those instances where a change of type occurs in the middle of the narrative and where another textual source is inserted in the text. If one includes all reproductions that involve not just a change of type in the text but the insertion of pictorial material by the setter? and this may include pictures of printed material?then the figures are as follows: Die Ringe des Saturn contains 65 images, Die Ausgewanderten 79, Schwindel. Gefuhle. 70, and Austerlitz 88. 2 Roland Barthes, La Chambre claire: note sur laphotographie (Paris: Gallimard, 1980). Siegfried Kracauer's classic essay on the ghostly quality of photographs provides another important point of departure for a discussion of photography in Sebald's work: 'Die Photographie', in Das Ornament der Masse (Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1977), pp. 21-39.

Sebald's Painters separate fact from fiction'.3 In the words of Stefanie Harris, Sebald prompts us 'to look beyond the simple reading of these photographs as merely enhancing the non-fictional elements of the text and to ask how they might function with and against the language of the text itself in order to communicate a particular relationship to the past' .4 According to Harris, Sebald investigates the relation? ship of trauma and memory through the photograph's peculiar relation to its referent: the presence of an irretrievable past in the photograph makes absence palpable. Carolin Duttlinger is similarly concerned with the close association of photography and trauma in Austerlitz. She shows how photography provides 'both a theoretical model and a mode of visual testimony that accompanies the protagonist's quest for his repressed past'. Duttlinger emphasizes the ambigu? ous role of photography: although in some cases a particular photograph may enable a therapeutic engagement with the past, in others it 'only emphasizes the aporia in the reconstruction of a traumatic incident'.5 The growing body of literature on Sebald's use of photography shows that Sebald employs the text-image relationship to disturb the binary opposition between life and death, remembering and forgetting, authenticity and fiction, or absence and presence. The uncertain ontological status of the majority of photographs enhances the ghostly quality of a prose that makes the recupera? tion of 'die Schmerzensspuren, die sich [. . .] in unzahligen feinen Linien durch die Geschichte ziehen', the painful traces of history, its primary concern.6 I propose to complement these insightful studies with an analysis of Sebald's treatment of fine art in his prose writings. The few articles that deal with this issue treat Sebald's usage of fine art alongside an analysis of photography.7 However, in what follows I argue that, in his early prose works, Sebald makes an epistemologically as well as aesthetically significant distinction between pho? tography and fine art that deserves closer analysis. While the photographs tend to explore the relationship between history and trauma by inviting an investi? gation of their representational status, works of fine art in Sebald's prose often provide a therapeutic haven of contemplation, a counterpoint that enshrines moments of transcendence. Works of fine art entertain a different relationship to cultural memory from that of photographs. In order to examine the function of fine art in Sebald's prose, this article first discusses Sebald's important essay on the painter Jan Peter Tripp and then moves to an exploration of a few sig- 3 J.

Gefuhle., Die Ausgewanderten, Die Ringe des Saturn, and Austerlitz. In contrast to his usage of photography, which, as some critics have rightly pointed out, becomes more radical with each publication, Sebald's employment of fine art has a well-defined aesthetic and epistemologi? cal framework which is largely allegorical. We shall, however, also see that this allegorical reception of fine art is implicitly challenged in Die Ausgewanderten and Austerlitz. Like many of Sebald's essays, the piece on Jan Peter Tripp begins with a biographical reflection: Sebald informs his reader that Tripp's artistic style underwent a profound change as a result of his time as a patient in a psychiatric hospital in the early 1970s.8 According to Sebald, the polemical note that used to characterize Tripp's work now gives way to a new form of objectivity which aims at the pure representation of the various expressions of life. This purity of representation is, however, not an end in itself but a reflection of the artist's profound engagement with the genesis and evolution of psychological suf? fering. For Sebald, Tripp's portraits of the inmates at Weissenau are examples of a pathography which exposes the deformations caused by 'Arbeitszwang und Seelenleid' (p. 172). Even Tripp's portraits of accredited politicians and business people are characterized by a somewhat contorted effect which reflects Tripp's understanding of individual human life as 'einer abnormen, aus dem Natur- und Gesellschaftszusammenhang gerissenen Kreatur' (ibid.). Clearly, Sebald's analysis of Tripp's work employs categories that correspond to his own aesthetic and moral position. As any reader of Sebald knows, his work abounds in reflections on the disastrous legacy of the history of human destruc- tiveness and aggression. From Sebald's point of view the traditional historical disciplines have failed to deal with the ethical consequences of the history of human mastery and intervention; the conventional historical narrative offers a top-down perspective on the historical events which obliterates the emotional experience of history in the lives of its victims. It operates as a cultural silencer, leaving no room for those marks of pain that haunt the individual's life and that make good art. However, for Sebald the recuperation of historical suffering in the individual's life must be the purpose of all true art. He therefore proposes an aesthetic of remembering which embraces the principle of partisanship for the victims of history's accumulating catastrophes. His works attempt to voice the experience of history as a violation by tracing not only what happened, the res gestae of history, but also the painful memory work that underpins the reconstruction of the past in the historia rerum gestarum. Looked at from this angle, Sebald's often-remarked 'Skrupulantismus'9 involves far more than the creation of documentary authenticity: what is at stake here is the scrupulous indexing of the chain of circumstances that leads to the recovery of an indivi? dual's life story. Instead of forcing an absolute breach between what happened 8 W. G.

Sebald's Painters and how it is remembered, Sebald's concept of cultural memory includes both the positivist enquiry into the historical events and the individual's attempt to retrieve these events.10 For Sebald, Tripp's work is marked by a similar principle of partisanship. This finds paradigmatic expression in Tripp's still-lifes, which are character? ized by the painter's deep respect for the object. 'In den Stilleben Tripps', Sebald explains, geht es nicht darum, daB der Maler seine Kunst und Herrschaft zur Ausiibung bringt an irgendeiner mehr oder wenigen zufalligen Assemblage der Dinge, zu denen wir, als blindwiitige Arbeitstiere, in einem untergeordneten und abhangigen Verhaltnis stehen. Da die Dinge uns (im Prinzip) uberdauern, wissen sie mehr von uns als wir iiber sie; sie tragen die Erfahrungen, die sie mit uns gemacht haben, in sich und sind ? tatsachlich ? das vor uns aufgeschlagene Buch unserer Geschichte. (p. 173) Sebald makes a number of points here that at first sight appear somewhat contradictory: firstly, he claims that instead of adopting a position of mastery vis-a-vis his objects, Tripp is intent on bringing to light their autonomous existence; secondly, he explains that because of our alienating work ethos, we are utterly dependent on the objects; he then goes on to say that in principle objects can outlast human life and provide a record of their experiences with us; they are the open book of our own history. The following question arises from this passage: if objects are autonomous, how can they provide us with a history of human experience? Furthermore, does Sebald's anthropomorphic imagery of the 'knowing object', accumulating its own experience with the human world, not suggest that he unwittingly reintroduces the classic subject- object relationship that he strives to overcome? However, this contradiction is resolved in the ensuing reflections, where Sebald ascribes to objects a quasi- magical power. Referring to Merleau-Ponty, he speaks of the objects' 'regard prehumain' in order to capture the inversion of roles between viewers and viewed that characterizes Tripp's paintings. 'Schauend gibt der Maler unser allzu leichtfertiges Wissen auf, he comments, 'unverwandt blicken die Dinge zu uns heriiber' (p. 174). Sebald's deliberations are clearly reminiscent of Walter Benjamin's notion of the aura of an object. According to Benjamin, the aura concerns involuntary memories that are triggered by particular everyday objects. In his famous essay on Baudelaire, Benjamin writes: Wenn man die Vorstellungen, die, in der memoire involontaire beheimatet, sich um einen Gegenstand der Anschauung zu gruppieren streben, dessen Aura nennt, so entspricht die Aura am Gegenstand einer Anschauung eben der Erfahrung, die sich an einem Gegenstand des Gebrauchs als Ubung absetzt. And he continues: Die Erfahrung der Aura beruht also auf der Ubertragung einer in der menschlichen IO Sebald's melancholic conception of history is an example of a specifically modern notion of time which has an abrupt beginning in the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The aftermath of the French Revolution produces a specifically modern nostalgia which registers historical change as a loss of the past.

Der Angesehene oder angesehen sich Glaubende schlagt den Blick auf. Die Aura einer Erscheinung erfahren, heiBt, sie mit dem Vermogen belehnen, den Blick aufzuschlagen.11 For both Benjamin and Sebald, the aura makes an object a carrier of cul? tural memory. However, in order to bring cultural memory to life, a particular aesthetic sensibility is required which engages with the hidden correspon? dences between such objects. Sebald writes in Benjaminian fashion: 'Die Erin- nerungsaura, die sie umgibt, verleiht ihnen den Charakter von Andenken, in denen Melancholie sich kristallisiert' (p. 183). For Sebald such Andenken' is, however, nothing but a citation, a reference to an earlier text which forces us to sift through our knowledge of other texts, images, and our knowledge of the world: 'Das wiederum erfordert Zeit. Indem wir sie aufwenden, treten wir ein in die erzahlte Zeit und in die Zeit der Kultur' (p. 185). The type of cultural engagement that Sebald envisages here requires both a certain learnedness on the part of the recipient and a particular form of perceptiveness that is atten? tive to the articulation of an aesthetic truth in a work of art. For Sebald this truth runs counter to the everyday rationality that governs modern life; it is a truth which emanates from the evocation of secret correspondences between different epochs or spheres of life that appear to have nothing in common with one another. Sebald cites two paintings by Jan Peter Tripp as examples of such meaningful correspondences. La Declaration de guerre is a large still-life depicting a pair of women's shoes on a black-and-white tiled floor. Sebald refers to this painting as a pictorial enigma which, in spite of its iconographic realism, is locked into a private meaning which appears to be inaccessible to the viewer (p. 185). The same still-life reappears as a citation four years later in a smaller painting by Tripp, entitled Deja vue oder der Zwischenfall: here the first still-life is now depicted as hanging on a wall; an elegant red-haired woman sits in front of it, studying it attentively. She has taken off one of her shoes, which turns out to be identical with the shoes in the first still-life. On the left a dog is shown looking at the viewer with a wooden sandal lying at its feet. Sebald explains, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that the dog has stolen the sandal from the fifteenth century: for originally the sandal belongs in Jan Van Eyck's famous Arnolfini painting of 1434. Sebald comments on Tripp's intertextual play as follows: Im Vordergrund, nahe dem linken unteren Bildrand liegt die holzerne Sandale, dieses seltsame Beistiick, neben einem kleinen Hiindchen, das in die Komposition hinein- geraten ist, wahrscheinlich als ein Symbol ehelicher Treue. Die rothaarige Frau, die in dem Bild Jan Peter Tripps nachsinnt iiber die Geschichte ihrer Schuhe und einen unerklarlichen Verlust, ahnt nicht, daB die Offenbarung des Geheimnisses hinter ihr liegt ? in Form eines analogen Gegenstandes aus einer langst vergangenen Welt. (pp. 187-88) The air of melancholy contemplation emanating from the female figure is con? siderably heightened by these aesthetic correspondences. The effect of Tripp's clever allusion to Van Eyck's Arnolfini painting must not be misunderstood as 11 Walter Benjamin, 'Uber einige Motive bei Baudelaire', in Illuminationen: Ausgewahlte Schrif? ten (Frankfurt a.M.: Fischer, 1977), pp. 185-229 (pp. 221 and 223).</page><page sequence="6">172 W.G. Sebald's Painters reducing or undoing the previously mentioned enigmatic quality of the shoes. On the contrary, the realization that there is always an analogous object in the past makes the possible narrative around the shoes more complex and uncanny. They become the carrier of an untold story of inexplicable loss; as such they are an icon of a melancholy view of history. For Sebald it is above all fine art that is particularly suited to this type of con? templative memory work. Good fine art is inextricably linked to the principle of polyvalence and the idea of transcending its material objects. For Sebald it is committed to transcending reality; he emphasizes that it has the power to illuminate reality by deconstructing its various forms of appearance: 'Der Ausloschung der sichtbaren Welt in endlosen Serien der Reproduktion begeg- net sie mit den Mitteln der Dekonstruktion der Erscheinungsformen' (p. 178). Even where the artist is keen to create a mimetic effect of the highest order, the work is necessarily premised on the principle of a significant deviation. Tripp's hyper-real paintings serve once more to illustrate this point. Although Tripp uses photographs as a point of departure, his work transcends the mimetic principle on which it is based: Die mechanische Scharfe/Unscharferelation wird aufgehoben, Zufugungen werden gemacht und Abstriche. Etwas wird an eine andere Stelle geriickt, hervorgehoben, verkiirzt oder um eine Geringfugigkeit verdreht. Farbtone werden verandert, und es unterlaufen bisweilen auch jene gliicklichen Fehler, aus denen sich dann unversehens das System einer der Wirklichkeit entgegengesetzten Darstellung ergibt. Ohne dergleichen EingrifFe, Abweichungen und Differenzen ware in der perfektesten Vergegenwartigung keine Geftihls- und keine Gedankenlinie. (pp. 178-79) A significant example of such a 'happy error' is provided in Die Ringe des Saturn, where Sebald offers a detailed reading of Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson ofDr. Nicolaas Tulp. At one point in his analysis Sebald addresses Rembrandt's awkward depiction of the left hand of the dead body of Aris Kindt, which seems oddly out of proportion.12 Sebald does not interpret the poor execution of the hand as a possible by-product ofthe origins ofthe painting, in which Rembrandt or one of his less gifted students may have painted the hand first.13 Instead, he sees this as a conscious disruption of a composition which is supposed to represent the triumph of modern science. This tension between Rembrandt's overall mastery and the clumsy execution of the hand suggests to Sebald that Rembrandt may have secretly empathized with Aris Kindt as a victim of the 12 See W G.

Weber completely misses the point when he argues that Sebald always prefers marginal works of art over masterpieces: 'Die Abbildungen sind im Verhaltnis zur "groBen" Geschichte marginale, private Zeugnisse von Randfiguren, keine Meisterwerke von Fotografie oder Malerei; auch bekannte Gestalten treten nicht als Subjekte der Geschichte auf. Und wenn ein Gemalde von Rembrandt vorkommt (in Die Ringe des Saturn), werden an ihm Fehler aufgezeigt' (Weber, 'Die fantastischebefragt die pedantische Genauigkeit', p. 69). While this is true in relation to the photographs, the statement completely ignores the epistemological and aesthetic distinction between photography and fine art in Sebald's work. Furthermore, it overlooks the presence of masterpieces in his works, ranging, for instance, from Giotto, Griinewald, Pisanello, Rembrandt, Jacob van Ruisdael, Lucas van Valckenborch to the contemporary Frank Auerbach.</page><page sequence="7">ANNE FUCHS 173 history of violence. He alone has empathy for the dead man, whose suffering is subtly expressed in the shadow of his half-open mouth and in his eyes.14 Directing our attention to factors which contradict the scientific optimism represented in the painting, Sebald explores the connection between science and history at the dawn of modernity. Thus, for example, the narrator ques? tions 'ob diesen Leib je in Wahrheit einer gesehen hat, denn die damals gerade aufkommende Kunst der Anatomisierung diente nicht zuletzt der Unsichtbar- machung des schuldhaften Korpers' (RS, p. 23). Thus, the attention of the characters portrayed is not focused on the body, but sie gehen, freilich haarscharf, an ihm vorbei auf den aufgeklappten anatomischen Atlas, in dem die entsetzliche Korperlichkeit reduziert ist auf ein Diagramm, auf ein Schema des Menschen, wie es dem passionierten, an jenem Januarmorgen im Waagebouw angeblich gleichfalls anwesenden Amateuranatomen Rene Descartes vorschwebte. Be- kanntlich lehrte Descartes in einem der Hauptkapitel der Geschichte der Unterwerfung, daB man absehen muB von dem unbegreiflichen Fleisch und hin auf die in uns bereits angelegte Maschine, auf das, was man vollkommen verstehen, restlos fiir die Arbeit nutzbar machen und, bei allfalliger Storung, entweder wieder instand setzen oder weg- werfen kann. (RS&gt; pp. 25-26) This polemical passage is chiefly directed against the prominence of Rene Descartes's rationalism in European thought and the concomitant privileg- ing of the 'res cogitans' over the body and the external world ('res extensa'). Descartes's influential Discours de la methode, which appeared in 1637, led to a pronounced and well-known opposition of mind and body and the radical devaluation of all non-cognitive areas and faculties of life. One result of the extreme opposition of mind and body in Descartes's thinking is, for instance, his view of animals as mere automata, that is as mechanisms which are cle- verly constructed but devoid of a soul. For Sebald this view results not only in the disastrously anthropocentric world-view of the modern era but also in the devaluation of the very notion of biological life. The hierarchization of the mind over the body goes hand in hand with the objectification of the body. Ultimately this produces a dangerously utilitarian biopolitics that categorizes life according to its usefulness. According to this logic, the flesh which is be? yond our comprehension, as Sebald puts it, must be made useful for work or, in the event ofa fault, either repaired or discarded. Although the passage cited above does not explicitly refer to the Holocaust, it is clear that Sebald, like Adorno and Horkheimer before him, makes a connection between European rationalism and the emergence of a biopolitics that made Auschwitz possible. This critique of modern biopolitics becomes a central issue in Chapter 3 of Die Ringe des Saturn, where Sebald reflects on the near extinction of the herring as an example of the Cartesian devaluation of non-human forms of life. Sebald's daring juxtaposition of the story of the herring and the corpses of Buchenwald underlines the common denominator of both stories of destruction: a cold and objectified biopolitics which disregards the value of life by means of a reductive interpretation of nature. He therefore assesses Descartes's attempt to reduce 14 For a detailed analysis of the Rembrandt painting and its relationship to the View of Haarlem by Jacob van Ruisdael in Die Ringe des Saturn see Anne Fuchs, 'Natur und Landschaft in Die Ringe des Saturn', in Die Schmerzensspuren der Geschichte: Zur Poetik der Erinnerung in W.

Sebald's Painters all natural phenomena to principles of mechanical analysis as the 'Hauptkapitel der Geschichte der Unterwerfung' that determined the modern relationship to nature. The triumphant advance of the sciences depicted in Rembrandt's painting simultaneously indicates its failure: the objectification of nature repre? sented in the autopsy coincides with nature's destructive exploitation. Following Adorno, Sebald thus makes the artist's aesthetic resistance to his contemporary reality an important criterion of good art. Although Sebald's engagement with visual art tends to focus on masterpieces, his prose works contain two examples of types of painting that fail to provide a critical counter- point to the here and now. In 'II ritorno in patria', the last story of Schwindel. Gefuhle., the narrator describes various paintings by Maler Hengge, a repre? sentative of the Heimatkunst of the 1930s. Adorning some of the houses in his home village, these serialized paintings and murals of woodcutters, peasants, and hunters give iconographic expression to the volkisch ideology of Heimat. In the words of the narrator, the energetic postures of the woodcutters are typical 'fiir die Heroisierung der Arbeit und des Krieges' which characterizes Hengge's work.15 However, in spite of its conformist nature, this art too can unwittingly undermine its own ideological premisses. This is the case in the frightening image of the woman holding a sickle, which the narrator's young alter ego sees as the figure of the Grim Reaper, harvesting death: Vor einem besonderen aber, vor dem an der Raiffeisenkasse angebrachten Fresko einer hochaufgerichteten Schnitterin, die dasteht vor einem Feld zur Ernte, das mir immer wie ein entsetzliches Schlachtengemalde vorgekommen ist, habe ich mich jedesmal, wenn ich daran vorbeiging, derart geangstigt, daB ich die Augen abwenden muBte. (SG, P- 235) What was intended as the pictorial glorification of the Heimat appears in the world of the post-war child as the uncanny and unbearable representation of death and loss. It is interesting to note that Sebald tells us that, apart from the frescos in the parish church, the pictures by Hengge were the only works of art he had seen until the age of seven or eight (SG, p. 236). Their effect on him in the present continues to be as devastating as it used to be in the past. A second example of visual art in the service of the distortion of an unf athom- able historical truth occurs in Die Ringe des Saturn, where Sebald deals with a subgenre of historical paintings, battle scenes at sea. For Sebald and his narrator such historical paintings are false, not because of the artist's betrayal of artistic truth in the service of ideology, but because of a naive belief in the principle of mimesis. Prior to his engagement with such works of art, the narrator recalls the Battle of Sole Bay, which took place in 1672 between the English and the Dutch fleets. Imagining the battle from the point of view of the people of Southwold, who hurried out of town to watch the spectacle from the beach, the narrator describes an invisible drama which cannot be perceived properly: the sunshine is too dazzling and the distance too great for the human figures on board the battleships to be seen; a clear perception of the battle is further hampered by the explosion of the powder magazines which, in all likelihood, would have 15 W.

Concluding that all verbal reports of such battles have been unreliable from time immemorial, the narrator adds, however, that all pictorial representations of such events are without exception works of fiction: Selbst gefeierte Seeschlachtenmaler wie Storck, van der Velde oder de Loutherbourg, von denen ich einige der Battle of Sole Bay gewidmete Erzeugnisse im Marinemuseum von Greenwich genauer studiert habe, vermogen, trotz einer durchaus erkennbaren realistischen Absicht, keinen wahren Eindruck davon zu vermitteln, wie es auf einem der mit Gerat und Mannschaften bis zum auBersten iiberladenen Schiffe zugegangen sein mufi, wenn brennende Masten und Segel niederstiirzten oder Kanonenkugeln die von einem unglaublichen Leibergewimmel erfullten Zwischendecks durchschlugen. (RS, p. 95) Susanne Schedel (p. 167) was first to point out that the reproduction, which is inserted mid-sentence after 'niederstiirzten', is a detail from Willem van de Velde the Younger's The Burning of the HMS Royal James at the Battle of Sole Bay, 28 May?j June 16J2. As is already hinted at by the narrator, the van de Velde can be seen at the Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The reproduction mid-sentence simply illustrates the point that, in spite of its realist premiss, the historical painting masks the havoc wrought by the battle and the suffering that was endured by the seamen involved in the engagement (RSy p. 96). In contrast to such affirmative art, Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson delivers a critical evaluation of the modern concept of nature, which conceives of nature in terms of an objectified and experimentally accessible world of phenomena, thus enshrining man's alienation from nature. For Sebald, Rembrandt's poor execution of the left hand of the dead body of Aris Kindt is thus a meaningful deviation, giving expression to the artist's opposition to the overt reality that he is commissioned to portray. Similarly, the quality of Tripp's trompe-Vceil technique consists less in the mimetic effect of his images than in the way in which he uses this technique to create significant moments of slippage that open up a 'furchterregende Tiefe, die sich hinter der Oberflache verbirgt' (p. 181), a frightening depth which is hidden behind the surface of things. In this way works of fine art give access to what Sebald calls 'metaphysisches Unterfutter der Realitat', the metaphysical lining of reality (ibid.). Art has the power to transcend time by salvaging ephemeral moments from the course of time; it rescues its objects from the history of destruction by making visible the aura that surrounds them. However, art's potential to transcend the reality of the here and now requires a specific type of cultural engagement on the part ofthe recipient s: we can reach the metaphysical lining of reality only if we are willing to enter what Sebald calls 'die Zeit der Kultur'. What is required here is the ability to bracket off the present and tentatively explore the original context of a particular work of art. In the light of this it would be a massive error of judgement to read Sebald's usage of fine art as an example of postmodern playfulness.16 His deliberations 16 I thus disagree with Claudia Albes, who interprets the repetitive and supplementary structure of Sebald's narratives as evidence of his postmodernism. Albes argues with reference to Die Ringe des Saturn that the supplementary structure of the narrative only highlights 'die Arbitraritat des in diesen Texten Erzahlten, das letztlich nichts anderes ist als die aufwendige Maskerade eines</page><page sequence="10">176 W. G. Sebald's Painters on fine art develop a model of what one might call 'knowing contemplativeness', a form of seeing that attempts to leave the framework of the present behind. Agood example of this is the narrator's description of Giotto's famous frescos in Schwindel. Gefiihle. The visit to the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua occurs in the summer of 1987, during the narrator's second trip to northern Italy, which he undertakes in order to work through his uncanny recollections of the first journey seven years earlier. Accordingly, on the way to Italy the narrator is flooded by the memories of his first trip, which he jots down frantically during the entire train journey. Such self-absorbed memory work makes him oblivious to his surroundings; only when the train crosses the lagoon to Venice does he regain full consciousness. However, the therapeutic intention of the trip is already called into question when, after his arrival in Venice, the narrator looks up from his writing and sees a barge laden with rubbish as well as a rat scuttling along and plunging head first into the water: Ich weiB nicht, ob es dieser Anblick gewesen ist, der mich den EntschluB fassen lieB, nicht in Venedig zu bleiben, sondern unverzuglich nach Padua weiterzufahren und dort die Kapelle des Enrico Scrovegni aufzusuchen, von der ich bisher bloB eine Beschrei- bung kannte, in der die Rede ist von der unverminderten Kraft der Farben des Fresken des Malers Giotto und von der immer noch neuartigen Bestimmtheit, die iiber jedem Schritt der in ihnen gebannten Figuren waltet. (SG, pp. 99-100) Images of rubbish, decay, and waste evoke a threatening sphere of life outside our meaningful social structures. They draw our attention to abjection as a condition which disturbs all available notions of identity, meaning, and order. According to Julia Kristeva, the abject can take hold of the subject when, after fruitless attempts to identify with objects on the outside, it withdraws to a world within, where, however, it finds itself confronted with the foundational experience of loss. Sebald's travelling narrator is such an abject character, who in Vienna and Venice fails to recognize a familiar and meaningful world. While the threat of abjection is pointed to in the waste imagery in Venice, Giotto's art holds the promise of the sublimation of abjection. It is interesting to note that writing fails to have the same effect in this scene: instead of sublimating the self's experience of abjection, the narrator's autobiographical annotations only enhance his sense of displacement and dejection. At this point of the narrative, writing functions as a symptom of the repetition compulsion that drives the self to re-enact an earlier trauma. Only when and if the self manages to reconnect itself with the world can his writing sublimate the desolate experience of abjection. One should note in this context that Kristeva reads Freud's notion of sublimation as a modern variant of the sublime: sublimation and the sublime both transcend the object. As Kristeva puts it, the encounter with the sublime triggers a spree of perceptions and words that expand memory boundlessly. I then forget the point of departure and find myself removed to a secondary universe, set off from the von Stillstandsangsten angetriebenen Erzahlens'. In contrast I argue that the encounters with visual art always result in significant moments of sublimation which maintain a loose connection with the sublime. See Claudia Albes, 'Die Erkundung der Leere: Anmerkungen zu W. G. Sebalds "englischer Wallfahrt" Die Ringe des Saturn\ jfahrbuch der deutschen Schiller-Gesellschaft, 46 (2002), 279-305 (p. 304).</page><page sequence="11">ANNE FUCHS 177 one where T am?delight and loss. Not at all short of but always with and through perception and words, the sublime is something added that expands us, overstrains us, and causes us to be both here, as dejects, and there, as others and sparkling.17 She writes: 'In the symptom, the abject permeates me, I become abject. Through sublimation, I keep it under control. The abject is edged with the sublime. It is not the same moment on the journey, but the same subject and speech bring them into being' (p. 11). Here and in his other books Sebald uses the travel paradigm to set a journey in motion which, on the one hand, traces the self's sense of abjection, and on the other hand explores the sublimation of abjection in and through art. John Zilcosky has recently argued that Sebald reconceives travel literature's master trope, the fear of getting lost and the desire to find one's way home, by telling stories in which the self can never sufficiently lose his way. According to Zilcosky, Sebald's travel narratives demonstrate that our 'disorientations never lead to new discoveries, only to a sense of uncanny, intertextual returns'.18 His analysis of the repetition compulsion in Schwindel. Gefuhle. convincingly shows how the paradigm of the controlling 'fort/da' game that underpins, for instance, Goethe's Italienische Reise gives way to a series of uncanny repetitions and returns in which the subject always returns to familiar places. Zilcosky's reading thus draws attention to Freud's repetition compulsion and the return of the repressed as key concepts that underpin Sebald's usage of the travel paradigm. However, it is important to note here that the narrator's repetition compulsion is often punctuated by meaningful encounters with works of art. These encounters interrupt the repetitive quality ofthe journey by suspending the narrator's sense of dejection. The therapeutic effect of visual art is, however, premised on the self's ability to suspend his self-absorption in favour of the entry into what Sebald in the essay on Tripp calls 'die Zeit der Kultur'. Such careful engagement with a work of art ultimately produces a new affect in the observer which results in the sublimation of pain. A prime example of such a successful moment of sublimation is the narrator's encounter with Giotto's frescos. Their undiminished intensity of colour and certainty of expression invite precisely the knowing contemplativeness that allows the self to transcend the immediate concerns of the present: Wie ich dann, hereingetreten aus der Hitze, die an diesem Tag in den fruhen Mor- genstunden schon iiber der Stadt lastete, tatsachlich im Innern der Kapelle vor den vom Gesims bis zum Bodensaum in vier Reihen sich hinziehenden Wandbildern stand, erstaunte mich am meisten die lautlose Klage, die seit nahezu siebenhundert Jahren von den iiber dem unendlichen Ungliick schwebenden Engeln erhoben wird. Wie ein Drohnen war diese Klage zu horen in der Stille des Raums. Die Engel selber aber hatten die Brauen im Schmerz so sehr zusammengezogen, daB man hatte meinen konnen, sie hatten die Augen verbunden. Und sind nicht, dachte ich mir, die weiBen Fliigel mit den wenigen hellgriinen Spuren der Veroneser Erde das weitaus Wunderbarste von allem, was wir uns jemals haben ausdenken konnen?

Sebald's Painters Once the narrator crosses the threshold and enters the chapel, he leaves his own subjectivity behind and focuses his attention on the details of the fresco. Moved by the expressiveness of the angels' 'silent lament', he disco vers an endless calamity which is the metaphysical lining of our reality. The oxymoron of a 'silent lament' is further underlined by the insertion of three black-and- white reproductions of some of the angels that surround Christ's body in the fresco. Their facial expressions and gestures emphasize the intensity of a suf? fering that is always unfolding right now in front of our eyes. However, in order to make this connection with an allegorical meaning the viewer has to abandon his own preoccupations in favour of the minute observation of the work of art. In this way, the study of a work of art initiates a moment of sublimation that places the self's own suffering onto a different level that is at a remove from the here and now. It is important to note at this juncture that for Sebald such moments of allegorical transposition are always premised on the artist's keen interest in the minutiae of the natural world, ranging, for example, from weather phenomena and geological observations to the animal and plant kingdoms. Only if the artist engages with the manifold facets of life, no matter how small they appear to be, can his work reach a sublime level of significance. Sebald explores the interdependence of the artist's groundedness in the diverse phenomena of life and the moment of sublimation most explicitly in his description of Pisanello's frescos in Verona. Prior to his visit to the Pellegrini Chapel in Verona, the narrator explains that Pisanello's paintings had always instilled a desire in him to give everything up except his sense of vision. And he continues that it is not so much Pisanello's realism which has this effect on him but, above all, the way in which the artist manages to transpose this realism onto a flat surface with a view to giving everything, from the principal protagonists to the single leaf of the forest, the same right to exist. In other words, it is the artist's deviation from the requirements of the central perspective which creates the painting's lasting effect. The narrator then proceeds to locate the position of the famous fresco of the Legend of St George inside the church before giving a detailed description of it. Imitating the movement of the narrator's eyes from left to right, the description is punctuated by narrative moments that encapsulate the theme of the fresco. Sebald returns to the issue of the artist's respect for all forms of life by emphasizing the diversity and vivid realism of the animals and plants in the fresco: Gebusch, Gestrauch und Blattwerk sind auf das sorgfaltigste gemalt und mit Liebe auch die Tiere, denen Pisanellos groBte Aufmerksamkeit immer gegolten hat: der land- einwarts fliegende Storch, die Hunde, der Schafbock und die Pferde mit den Berittenen, unter denen sich ein kalmuckischer Bogenschutze befindet mit einem schmerzhaften Ausdruck der Intensitat im Gesicht. (SG, p. 90) Only after this exploration of the entire composition of the fresco does he turn his attention to the central depiction of St George's leave-taking from the Principessa: In der Mitte des Bildes die Principessa in einem Federkleid und San Giorgio, von dessen Riistung das Silber abgeblattert ist, den aber der Glanz seines rotgoldenen</page><page sequence="13">ANNE FUCHS 179 Haupthaares noch umgibt. Zum Erstaunen ist es, wie es Pisanello verstanden hat, den jah heraustretenden, seitwarts schon auf die schwere blutige Arbeit abschweifenden mannlichen Blick des Ritters abzusetzen von der nur durch die geringfiigige Senkung der unteren Lidgrenze angedeuteten Beschlossenheit des weiblichen Auges. Two fragments of the fresco, St George's eyes and the Principessa's profile, are inserted into the description at this point. However, instead of setting the extracts next to each other on a horizontal line, Sebald arranges them vertically, which has the effect of disconnecting the Principessa's gaze from the departing St George. The vertical arrangement dramatically heightens the desolate separ? ation ofthe two figures. Sebald's reading emphasizes the intensity of expression of both figures, which, in their isolation, now seem to see far more than the fate awaiting them. The two extracts taken from the Pisanello fresco are thus repre? sented as emblematic carriers of a melancholic view of history which, unlike modern teleological historiography, contemplates the losses that are brought about by the history of human destruction. This melancholic reading of his? tory comes to life only under the scrutinizing eye of Sebald's narrator and reader. With its skilful choreography from left to right his description moves from the concrete to the allegorical, from an anchorage in the phenomenologi? cal world to a metaphysical perspective. It appears, however, that in his later publications Sebald abandons this type of positive allegorical epistemology in favour of the aforementioned unsettling relationship between image and text. The Aurach story in Die Ausgewanderten addresses the problematic of figurative art after Auschwitz in the context of Au- rach's painterly technique. Aurach's portraits are described as the final record of a potentially open-ended process, which involves the painter's alternation between drawing and scrubbing the outlines back into the paper until it wears away under the rubbing ofthe rag:19 EntschloB sich Aurach, nachdem er vielleicht vierzig Varianten verworfen beziehungs- weise in das Papier zuriickgerieben und durch weitere Entwiirfe iiberdeckt hatte, das Bild weniger aus Uberzeugung, es fertiggestellt zu haben, als aus einem Gefuhl der Ermattung, endlich aus der Hand zu geben, so hatte es fiir den Betrachter den Anschein, als sei es hervorgegangen aus einer langen Ahnenreihe grauer, eingeascherter, in dem zerschundenen Papier nach wie vor herumgeisternder Gesichter. (Ag, pp. 239-40) Aurach's painting technique aims not so much at the representation of the vi? sible world as at its erasure in favour of the ghostly presence of an unmastered past. The painting, which is inserted mid-sentence at this point, illustrates the self-reflexivity of Aurach's method; it is a reproduction of Frank Auerbach's Head of Catherine Lampert VI, in which the face of the sitter appears like a 19 The description of Aurach's technique is highly reminiscent of Robert Hughes's description of Frank Auerbach's way of working: 'Each day's work is leftovernight, taken up the next day when the sitter arrives, and then scrubbed back to a gray blur?usually to the sitter's disappointment, since there seems no end to all this. The work begins again. There may be fifteen, twenty, thirty vanished states in the end, each corresponding to a giornata, a day's work. Their only final record is the deepened, tarnished silver-surfaced surface the paper has taken on from so many coats of ingrained charcoal left by the successive erasures. After a while the paper sometimes wears away under the scratchy attack of the charcoal and the rubbing of the rag, and must be repaired' (Robert Hughes, Frank Auerbach (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1990), p. 198).</page><page sequence="14">180 W G. Sebald's Painters ghostly palimpsest of an inaccessible original.20 Aurach's/Auerbach's procedu- ral painting technique thus understands art as a form of displaced and highly painful memory work.21 And yet this art is still figurative and intent on main? taining at least minimally a mimetic relationship to its subject precisely by foregrounding the absence of its referent. In any case, it appears that Sebald has once and for all done away with the type of artistic sublimation that char? acterized the traveller's encounters with visual art in Schwindel. Gefuhle. This positive epistemology of sublimation through allegory has become an untenable position in the world after Auschwitz: although the Max Aurach story contains a reproduction of Courbet's Oak of Vercingetorix, the picture is mentioned only as a point of departure for Aurach's continued 'Zerstorungsstudien' (Ag, pp. 268-69). At first sight this assessment seems to be borne out by Sebald's second nar? rative, which explicitly addresses the Holocaust. Although Austerlitz is full of pictorial material?in total there are more than eighty pictorial reproductions? the work does not reproduce a single famous masterpiece of fine art. While Schwindel. Gefuhle. and Die Ringe des Saturn each contain and thematize fa? mous works of art, in Austerlitz there is only one reproduction of a small watercolour, entitled Funeral at Lausanne, by J. W. M. Turner (Ay p. 159). This watercolour has a quite different status and function in the narrative. Unlike the Giotto or Pisanello frescos, which, as we have seen, receive extensive narrative treatment, the watercolour is described in a fleeting fashion: Das nahezu substanzlose Bild, das die Bezeichnung Funeral at Lausanne tragt, datiert aus dem Jahr 1841 und also aus einer Zeit, in der Turner kaum noch reisen konnte, mehr und mehr umging mit dem Gedanken an seine Sterblichkeit und vielleicht darum, wenn irgend etwas, wie dieser kleiner Lausanner Leichenzug, aus dem Gedachtnis auf- tauchte, geschwind mit einigen Pinselstrichen die sogleich wieder zerflieBenden Visio- nen festzuhalten suchte. {A, p. 159) This brief description seems to imitate the light and evocative nature of the watercolour itself. However, in spite of its reference to the moment of dis? solution, the description still works with the allegory. It is in line with this quasi-baroque reflection on man's mortality that Turner's watercolour gives expression to Austerlitz's memory of the double funeral of Alphonso and Eve- lyn Fitzpatrick in Wales in 1957 and of his last walk with his friend Gerald through the vineyards of Lake Geneva in 1966. His discovery that Turner had passed through the same spot in Wales in 1798 and that he was exactly the same age as Austerlitz when he attended the funeral makes the watercolour another emblem of historical loss. In any case, closer scrutiny shows that even in Austerlitz Sebald continues his allegorical exploration of art as a special carrier of cultural memory. Although the narrative contains no reproductions of famous masterpieces, he continues to explore art's ability to reveal the metaphysical lining of reality. Instead of 20 Hughes, no. 152. 21 On this issue see also Jan Ceuppens, 'Im zerschundenen Papier herumgeisternde Gesichter: Fragen der Reprasentation in W. G.

Jahrhunderts, wahrend der sogenannten kleinen Eiszeit, von Lucas van Valckenborch gemalten Bild die zugefrorene Schelde vom jenseitigen Ufer aus zu sehen sei und hinter ihr, sehr dunkel, die Stadt Antwer- pen und ein Streifen des flachen, gegen die Meereskiiste hinausgehenden Landes. Aus dem dusteren Himmel iiber dem Turm der Kathedrale Zu Unserer Lieben Frau geht gerade ein Schneeschauer nieder, und dort drauBen auf dem Strom, auf dem wir jetzt dreihundert Jahre spater hinausblicken, sagte Austerlitz, vergniigen sich die Antwer- pener auf dem Eis, gemeines Volk in erdfarbenen Kitteln und vornehmere Personen mit schwarzen Umhangen und weiBen Spitzenkrausen um den Hals. Im Vordergrund, gegen den rechten Bildrand zu, ist eine Dame zu Fall gekommen. Sie tragt ein kanarien- gelbes Kleid, der Kavalier, der sich besorgt iiber sie beugt, eine rote, in dem fahlen Licht sehr auffallige Hose. Wenn ich nun dort hinausschaue und an dieses Gemalde und seine winzigen Figuren denke, dann kommt es mir vor, als sei der von Lucas van Valckenborch dargestellte Augenblick niemals vergangen, als sei die kanariengelbe Dame gerade jetzt erst gestiirzt oder in Ohnmacht gesunken, die schwarze Samthaube eben erst seitwarts von ihrem Kopf weggerollt, als geschahe das kleine, von den meisten Betrachtern gewiB iibersehene Ungliick immer wieder von neuem, als hore es nie mehr auf und als sei es durch nichts und von niemandem mehr gutzumachen. (A, pp. 19-20) In this detailed analysis of the composition, colour, and theme of this painting Austerlitz develops what one might call a 'school of seeing' which his recipient, in this case the narrator, has to master before he qualifies as a suitable witness of his life story. Sebald does not reproduce the painting at this point, favouring instead the kind of ekphrasis which translates the process of reception into the interplay between careful perception (description) and interpretation (narra? tion). The point of the passage is not to suggest a false supremacy of one form of art over another but to evoke precisely the kind of 'knowing contempla- tiveness' that gives access to the metaphysical lining of our reality. By turning our attention to the mishap of the fallen woman, which, in Austerlitz's view, is overlooked by the majority of viewers, he makes our attentiveness towards that which seems marginal and insignificant the condition of true knowledge. Under the contemplative gaze of the careful observer, the fall of the woman takes on a new meaning; suddenly it suggests a metaphysical time-jump: we now realize that the mishap is happening right now in front of our eyes. Thus for Austerlitz and his author the accident is not just another detail in an example of Dutch genre painting, but is an allegorically meaningful event which gives expression to the melancholy view of history as a history of accumulating calamities.23 I would like to finish with one further example from Austerlitz which, at 22 On ekphrasis see James Heffernan, 'Ekphrasis and Representation', New Literary History, 22 (1991), 297-316; Murray Krieger, Ekphrasis: The Illusion of the Natural Sign (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992). 23 On Sebald's metaphysical reading of a universal history of catastrophe see Amir Eshel, 'Against the Power of Time: The Poetics of Suspension in W. G. Sebald's Austerlitz', New German Critique, 88 (2003), 71-96.

G. Sebald's Painters first sight, seems to unsettle the two distinctive epistemologies that underpin his usage of photography and visual art in his narratives. Towards the end of Austerlitz the protagonist relates how his search for any traces of his father led him to the new Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris; his description of the approach to the library, with its complicated system of staircases, escalators, and security officers who control access to the reading rooms, maps out a Kafkaesque system of regulations that aims at disempowering the individual. Denouncing the 'cartesischen Gesamtplan der Nationalbibliothek' (A, p. 394), Austerlitz claims that the gigantic library complex serves the 'fortschreitende Auflosung unserer Erinnerungsfahigkeit' (A, p. 400). A grainy aerial photograph depicts two of the library towers and the giant esplanade with a few tiny figures walking along. A few pages later, the reader comes across a second photograph, which, according to Austerlitz, depicts the archive at Theresienstadt that houses the files on former prisoners. This picture, which is taken from an architectural magazine, produces in him 'die zwanghafte Vorstellung [. . .], daB dort in der kleinen Festung von Terezin, in deren naBkalten Kasematten so viele zugrunde gegangen sind, mein wahrer Arbeitsplatz gewesen ware und daB ich ihn nicht eingenommen habe aus eigener Schuld' (A, p. 397). Austerlitz's painful self-accusation raises once more the question whether a cognitive approach to the past, which accumulates historical knowledge, merely supports, as he puts it elsewhere, 'ein ersatzweises, kompensatorisches Gedachtnis' in the service of repression (A&gt; p. 202). For Austerlitz the Bib? liotheque Nationale is the architectural expression of precisely the sterile type of knowledge which is divorced from emotional affect. The contrast between the two pictures could not be greater: while the first image simply illustrates Austerlitz's thesis of our forgetful culture by depicting the giant exterior of an apparently inaccessible and hostile complex, the second image invites a different level of enquiry. On closer scrutiny, the question arises whether the picture is what Austerlitz claims it to be: is it really a photograph of the Registraturkam- mer or is it rather a painting or drawing of some kind of archive or reading room? It seems to me that, in this instance, Sebald sets up a deliberate tension be? tween the documentary status of the photograph of the Bibliotheque Nationale on the one hand, and the mysteriousness of the interior on the other. While the emptiness of the photograph of the library gives expression to the cultural forgetfulness that Austerlitz diagnoses as a problem, the second image?be it a photograph or a painting?invites a quite different reading: here the objects appear to be leftover traces of their former users. Although there are no people in the room, the position of the various objects seems to indicate that it has been used until recently; these objects appear to be traces of a former presence: for instance, the door is left open, three of the chairs are moved away from the table, and the hands of the clock are approaching six. The room is an enigma that triggers the kind of cultural memory that points to the ghostly presence of the absent other. 'The enigma', writes Emmanuel Levinas, is 'the intervention leading to Theresienstadt' (p. 88). On Sebald's view of history see also Andreas Huyssen, 'On Rewritings and New Beginnings: W. G. Sebald and the Literature about the Luftkrieg', Zeitschrift fiir Literaturwissenschaft und Linguistik, 31 (2001), 72-90; and Anne Fuchs, 'Geschichte als Meta- physik des Unglucks', in Die Schmerzensspuren der Geschichte, pp. 165-205.</page><page sequence="17">ANNE FUCHS 183 of a meaning which disturbs phenomena but is quite ready to withdraw like an undesirable stranger, unless one harkens to those footsteps that depart [. . .].'24 The image of the Registraturkammer thus transcends the therapeutic epis? temology that characterizes Sebald's treatment of fine art in his early prose works. While works by masters, such as Giotto, Pisanello, von Valckenborch, or Rembrandt, provide a haven of contemplation in or a counterpoint to an otherwise alienating world, the image of the Registraturkammer emanates a sense of stillness which has a ghostly quality and which situates this image in our post-Holocaust world. A similar effect is achieved by the Auerbach portrait in the Max Aurach story of Die Ausgewanderten. In both instances, an epis? temology of displacement and erasure takes the place of the earlier allegorical treatment of the masterpieces. However, the fact that Sebald's narrator refers to the image of the Registraturkammer as a photograph suggests that Sebald attempts to uphold the epistemological distinction between photography and fine art as developed in his seminal essay on Jan Peter Tripp. Regardless of the enormous differences in style, genre, and epoch, Sebald's painters all share a strong sense of partisanship with the victims of history: for Sebald good works of fine art are expressions of a resistance to the modern world as well as the melancholy carrier of cultural memory. By revealing the frightening depth which is hidden behind the surface of things, these works give access to the me? taphysical lining of our reality. Perhaps one could say that Sebald's allegorical epistemology makes memory work a very cultured and aestheticized activity that produces a worrying nostalgia towards cultural loss. On the other hand, what separates this cultural engagement from a flight into nostalgia is the fact that it advocates a form of cultural enquiry that resists the appropriation of the past.
