<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology on the Northern Coast of the Black Sea MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV INTRODUCTION This report provides a survey of work in Classical archaeology in the North Pontic region during the 1980s.' The area covered comprises the coastal region of Ukraine including the Crimea and sites in southern Russia around the Sea of Azov and the Russian littoral of the Black Sea (fig. 1). The Georgian seacoast is excluded. This is the region first made well known to Westerners by E.H. Minns in his celebrated Scythians and Greeks (Cambridge 1913). Much work has been done since his day. The survey by J.G.F. Hind in AR 30 (1983-1984) 71-97 included activity in this region from 1970 to 1980, itself following earlier surveys by J. Boardman (AR 1962-1963, 34-51) covering work from 1945 to 1962 and by K.S. Gorbunova (AR 1971- 1972, 48-59) covering work between 1965 and 1970. Some of the cities in this region are listed in the 1976 Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites (PECS) with entries containing selected bibliography through the early 1970s. These are the most readily available sur- veys of pre-1980 work for English readers. Here we will seek to cover the principal results of the excavations of cities and settlements established by the Greeks in the North Pontic region. Most aspects of Scythian, Taurian, and Sarmatian cultures, how- ever, more properly the subject of a separate report, will not be covered. We have sought to draw upon information in local Russian and Ukrainian publica- tions, access to which tends to be limited in the West. The titles of monographs and articles are transliter- ated and translated. An asterisk (*) signifies that the publication has a summary in English or French. In the first section of this newsletter we provide a general bibliographical background by topic; in the second section, we summarize the results of archaeological fieldwork, proceeding clockwise around the Black Sea from the lower Dniestr to the Taman' peninsula. I Publication of this newsletter was funded in part by a grant from the Joukowsky Family Foundation. The authors and the editors of AJA are very grateful for the Foundation's generosity. Completion of the project would not have been possible without the cooperation and support of our col- leagues Andrew Oliver, Jr., and Carol Mattusch, who have been involved from the beginning and who revised our original English text and assisted us in many other ways. We are deeply in their debt and express our great gratitude to them. We also wish to thank Jeannine Davis-Kimball and Vasily Rudich for reviewing the revised version of our manu- script, as well as AJA's editors for their assistance. We are also grateful to the following individuals for gen- erously supplying information and illustrations: E.M. Alex- eyeva, T.M. Arsenyeva, V.V. Dolgorukov, V.D. Kusnetsov, A.A. Maslennikov, E.J.

Shcheglov covers the territorial expansion of Chersonesos in the fourth century B.C. in Dialogues d'histoire ancienne 13 (1987) 239-73. V.M. Zubar' dis- cusses the long-debated question of Chersonesos's po- litical history at the turn of the era in VDI 1987:2, 118-29*, arguing that the city was not dependent from the Bosporan Kingdom. On the subject of Bos- porus and Chersonesos relations in the reign of As- andros see S.Y. Saprykin in SovArch 1987:1, 48-57*. V.I. Kadeyev considers the socioeconomic, ethnic, and political history of Chersonesos on the basis of ar- chaeological, numismatic, and epigraphical data in his Hersones Tavricheskiy v pervykh vekakh nashey ery (= Tauric Chersonesos in the First Century A.C., Khar- kov 1981). F.V. Shelov-Kovedyayev discusses aspects of the po- litical history of Bosporus in "Istoriya Bospora v VII- IV vv. do n.e.," in Drevneyshie gosudarstva na territorii SSR; Materialy i issledovaniya (= "The History of Bosporus in the VIIth-IVth Centuries B.C.," in The Earliest States in the Territory of the USSR. Materials and Researches, Moscow 1985) 5-186*. Shelov-Koved- yayev covers the social and political structure of Bos- poran tyranny in Dialogues d'histoire ancienne 12 (1986) 173-81. In VDI 1984:3, 24-48*, V.P. Tolstikov reconstructs the military and political situation in Bos- porus in the late sixth and early fifth centuries B.C. in the context of the establishment of the Bosporan state. Ethnic Issues. Issues associated with the relation- ship of the North Pontic Greek colonies to the local population were considered in the papers of the fourth Tshaltubo-Vani colloquium, as well as in nu- merous other publications such as those devoted to the rural territory of Olbia or the Elisavetovskoye settlement in the Don estuary. The following publi- cations or articles bear on the subject: D.B. Shelov in Heinen 395-97; K.K. Marchenko and Y.A. Vinogra- dov in Antiquity 63 (1989) 803-13, Klio 71 (1989) 539- 49, and SovArch 1991:1, 145-55*; and the disserta- tion by Y.A. Vinogradov on the particular character of Greek-indigenous relations in the Bosporus from the sixth to the third centuries B.C. (1990). A dissertation by S. Krykin is devoted to the Thra- cians in Greek colonies of the North Pontic region (1988); Krykin also has an article on this subject in Thracia 8 (1988) 58-83. K.K. Marchenko has undertaken a study of ethnic history, focusing on the indigenous population of Olbia and Berezan' from the seventh to the first cen- turies B.C.: Varvary v sostave naseleniya Berezani i Olvii (= Barbarians in the Population of Berezan' and Olbia, Leningrad 1988). A collection of articles in Materialy k etnicheskoy istorii Kryma (= Materials on the Ethnic History of the Crimea, Kiev 1987) is devoted to local populations of the region; Chersonesos is covered in articles by E.I. Solomonik and V.M. Zubar' (67-78 and 78-105) and Kerkinitis by V.A. Kutaysov (27-40). T.L. Nazarova and I.D. Potehina discuss the anthropological material from the late Roman and early Medieval necropolises of Chersonesos and the Luchistoje settlement in An- tropologicheskiye materialy iz mogilnikov Yugo-Zapad- nogo Kryma (= Anthropological Material from the Necropolises of Southwestern Crimea, Kiev 1990). I.S. Pioro's Krymskaya Gotiya (= Crimean Gothia, Kiev 1990) is a general survey of ethnicity in late Roman and early Medieval Crimea. Ethnicity in the European Bosporus in the Scythian period is the subject of two publications: an article by E.P. Bunatyan and S.S. Bessonova in Arkheologiya (Kiev) 1990:1, 18-27*; and a book by Bessonova, Bunatyan, and N.A. Gavrilyuk, Aktashskiy mogilnik skifskogo vremeni v Vostochnom Krymu (= The Aktash Necropolis of the Scythian Period in Eastern Crimea, Kiev 1988), dealing with a necropolis of the fourth and third centuries B.C. Similar issues of the late Hellenistic and Roman periods are discussed in a monograph devoted to the Zolotoye necropolis in eastern Crimea: V.N. Korpusova, Nekropol Zolotoye (Kiev 1983). A.A. Maslennikov considers issues about the population of the Bosporan kingdom, utilizing grave goods, in two studies: Naseleniye Bosporskogo gosudarstva v VI-II vv. do n.e. (= The Population of the Bosporan State from the VIth to IInd Centuries B.C., Moscow 1981)*; Naseleniye Bosporskogo gosudarstva v pervykh vekakh nashey ery (= The Population of the Bosporan State in the First Century A.C., Moscow 1990)*. Maslennikov also discusses populations on the basis of grave goods in cities of Asian Bosporus using first-century necropolises in VDI 1981:1, 150-62* and SovArch 1985:1, 61-74. Other publications take up the problem from two different points of view. One uses anthropological data: M.M. Gerasimova, N.M. Rud', and L.T. Jablonskiy, Antropologiya antich- nogo i srednevekovogo naseleniya Vostochnoy Evropy ( The Anthropology of the Ancient and Medieval Popula- tion of Eastern Europe, Moscow 1987); another is based on a study of handmade pottery from the excavations of Myrmekion, Tiritake, and Iluraton: E.G. Kastan- ayan, Lepnaya keramika Bosporskikh gorodov (= Hand- made Pottery ofBosporan Cities, Leningrad 1981). Rituals and Funerary Practices.

VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 discussed respectively by A.S. Russyayeva and V.M. Zubar' in Obryady i verovaniya drevnego naseleniya Ukrainy (= Rituals and Religious Beliefs of the Ancient Population of the Ukraine, Kiev 1990) 40-60 and 61- 83. V.M. Zubar' and V.F. Meshcheryakov survey cults of the first-century A.C. population of Chersonesos on the basis of grave goods in Naseleniye i kultura Kryma v pervye veka n.e. (= Population and Culture of the Crimea in the First Century A.C., Kiev 1983). On this subject see also M.I. Zolotarev in KSIA 168 (1981) 56-58, who publishes a cup of the Roman period found in Chersonesos with a dedication to Jupiter Dimeranos. T.A. Matkovskaya examines the typology and com- position of first-century A.C. grave reliefs and their role in funerary customs in Naseleniye i kultura Kryma (supra). See also E.A. Savostina in KSIA 191 (1987) 13ff; L. Bacchielli in NumAntCl 17 (1988) 209-16; and A. Wasowicz, "Les coutumes funeraires du Bos- phore a l'epoque de Mithridate VI Eupator et de ses successeurs," RA 1990, 61-84. A dissertation by E.A. Savostina treats Bosporan tombs (1984). I. Shaub con- siders the ritual symbolism of Hellenistic Bosporan terracottas of Eros with attributes of Herakles in KSIA 168 (1981) 41-42. International Relations. Pontic unity is consid- ered by several scholars: D.B. Shelov in VDI 1986:1, 36-52*; Y.G. Vinogradov in Acta Centri Historiae Terra Antiqua Balcanica 2 (Trinovi 1987) 9-77; A. Mehl in Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur historischen Geogra- phie des Altertums I, 1980 (Geographica Historia 4, Bonn 1987). Relationships among certain states of the North Pontic region, for example Olbia and Cherso- nesos, are discussed by M.I. Zolotarev in VDI 1986:2, 88-93* and in his dissertation (1985). M.J. Treister considers the long-discussed nature of contacts between Ptolemaic Egypt and Bosporus in the third century B.C. in VDI 1985:1, 126-39*; see also Y.N. Litvinenko in VDI 1991:1, 12-26. In his 1984 dissertation, V.A. Goroncharovskij discusses contacts between Pergamon and the North Pontic region in the Hellenistic period. The relations between Chersonesos and Heraclea Pontica are considered in a monograph by S.Y. Sa- prykin, Heracleya Pontiyskaya i Hersones Tavricheskiy (= Heraclea Pontica and Chersonesos Tauricae, Moscow 1986). On the Roman military presence in the North Pon- tic region see in general D.B. Shelov in VDI 1981:4, 52-63; B. Funck in Altertum 32 (1986) 27-35; and T. Sarnowski, Woysko rzymskie w Mezyi Dolney i na polnochym wybrzezu Moraz Czarnego (= Roman Troops in Moesia Inferior and on the Northern Coast of the Black Sea, Warsaw 1988). Trade. I.B. Brashinskiy discusses the methodology of studies of ancient trade based principally on am- phoras in Metody issledovaniya antichnoy torgovli (= Methods of Studies in Ancient Trade, Leningrad 1984). Archaeological finds are employed for a study of the economic relations of Chersonesos with other centers around the Black Sea and the Mediterranean as well as the local population of Tauris in a publica- tion by V.I. Kadeyev and S.B. Sorochan, Ekonomi- cheskiye svyazi antichnykh gorodov Severnogo Pricher- nomorya v I v. do n.e. - V v. n.e. (na materialakh Hersonesa) (= Economic Relations of the Classical Cities of the North Pontic Area from the Ist Century B.C. to the Vth Century A.C. [based on the Materials from Cherso- nesos], Kharkov 1989). See also the following on this subject: A. Avram in Miinster Beitrdige zur antiken Handelsbeziehungen 7 (1988) 87-91; V.I. Kadeyev and S.B. Sorochan in Arkheologiya (Kiev) 1989:4 on the contacts of Chersonesos with the western Pontic re- gion; and D. Panitschek in Miinster Beitriige 7 (1988) 27-42 on Attic trade in the Black Sea. In Dacia 32 (1988) 21-25, C. Domaneantu discusses the presence of sixth-century B.C. spherical faience aryballoi in the Black Sea, arguing that they were distributed by mer- chants from Aegina. In two publications by Y.S. Bad- alyants, the question of trade between Rhodes and the North Pontic region is discussed in the light of amphora stamps: VDI 1986:1, 87-98*; Klio 71 (1989) 226-40. Soviet literature on trade published before 1977 is surveyed by D.B. Shelov in Heinen 393-95. Coinage and the Circulation of Money. The fol- lowing section is organized by region. Northwest Pontic Region. A new book by V.A.

Grandmeson in KSIA 197 (1990) 57-59. In KSIA 174 (1983) 108-10 and KSIA 182 (1985) 60- 63, Grandmeson publishes previously unknown var- iants of Chersonesian coins; and in KSIA 191 (1987) 38-40 he deals with coins showing a head of Athena and the name of the magistrate Herodotus, which he assigns to the second half of the third century B.C. T.I. Kostromicheva and N.A. Alexeyenko discuss a hoard of fourth- and third-century B.C. coins of Chersonesos found in the Heraclean peninsula in KSIA 174 (1983) 40-43. An aureus of A.D. 65-68 found in the vicinity of Chersonesos is published by V.M. Zubar' and T.I. Kostromicheva in KSIA 197 (1990) 83-86. In VDI 1989:4, 91-95*, G.R. Tset- skhaldze publishes 28 late second-century B.C. coins of Dioscurias from the excavations of Chersonesos. A sanctuary in the mountains of Crimea (Gurzuf Pass), under excavation since 1982 by a Yalta museum expedition led by N.G. Novichenkova, yielded many finds, principally coins, glass, and silver and bronze statuettes. The statuettes have been illustrated in the Schleswig exhibition catalogue; two unique coins have also been published: one is a stater of the Bosporan queen, Dynamis, published in SovArch 1990:3, 204- 14 by S.Y. Saprykin, who reviews the politics in Bos- porus from the 50s to the 20s B.C. and dates the coin to the year 277 of the Pontic-Bithynian era, i.e., 20 B.C.; the other, published in SovArch 1985:1, 260-63 by N.G. Novichenkova, is a gold stater of Chersonesos dated to the year 120 of the local era or A.D. 95/96. Bosporus. A monograph by V.A. Anokhin, Monet- noye delo Bospora (= The Coinage of Bosporus, Kiev 1986) reexamines the typology and chronology of Bosporan coins. There is a review article of the book by N.A. Frolova in VDI 1988:2, 122-43*. Frolova's dissertation (1988), devoted to first-century A.C. Bos- poran coinage, had already been published: The Coin- age of the Kingdom of Bosporus 1: A.D. 69-238 (BAR- IS 56, 1979), 2: A.D. 242-341/342 (BAR-IS 166, 1983). In SovArch 1983:2, 109-16", V.N.

Zolotarev in VDI 1984:1, 89-92*. In SovArch 1988:4, 138-45*, N.V. Anfimov pub- lishes a hoard of bronze coins of Pantikapaion discov- ered in 1985 during construction work in Slavyansk on Kuban'. This is the fifth recorded hoard of Bos- poran coins of the late fourth to early third century B.C. found in the territory of the Meotian tribes, namely the Dandarii and the Psessy, a region that, according to Anfimov, was annexed to Bosporus un- der Leucon I. In VDI 1991:1, 70-75, Anfimov pub- lishes another hoard of 1,213 coins of the same period found in 1986 near the village of Staronizhnestebliev- skaya. Anfimov supposes that the right bank of the lower reaches of the Kuban' was part of the Bosporan kingdom in this period. N.A. Frolova discusses the bronze issues of the Bosporan kingdom of the late first century B.C. to early first century A.C. in Numizmatika i epigrafika (= Numismatics and Epigraphy) 15 (1989) 3-18; pub- lishing a gold coin of Mithridates III dated to the year 338 of the Pontic-Bithynian era (A.D. 41), Frolova reconstructs the events of Roman intervention in Bos- porus in A.D. 45-49, and concludes that Roman gar- risons were not a regular feature of towns of Bospor- us: VDI 1986:4, 54-59*. Elsewhere, Frolova considers attributes on certain Bosporan staters of the third to the early fourth century A.C. in connection with the spread of Mithraism in Bosporus: Problemy antichnoy kultury (= Problems of Classical Culture, Moscow 1986) 209-14. In VDI 1989:1, 93-97*, A.I. Anisimov publishes a unique aes of Rhescuporis II, now in a private collec- tion in Kerch. In Numizmatika i epigrafika 14 (1984) 50-60, D.B. Shelov and A.I.

In Wiadomsci Numizmatyczne 32 (1988) 140-41, M. Mielczarek surveys the numismatic finds of North Pontic origin in Poland. In the same issue of that journal (185-89), K. Mitkowa-Szubert publishes 12 coins (eight of Bosporus, two of Chersonesos, one Ptolemaic, and one Roman) found in Kerch in the late 19th century and now in the State Archaeological Museum in Warsaw. An analysis of 32 third-century A.C. hoards of Bos- poran coins found in Bosporus has revealed to N.A. Frolova three gaps in the issues of that city (datable to A.D. 239-242, 258-260, and 268-274) caused by nomadic invasions: SovArch 1989:4, 196-206*.

On the basis of spectroanalytical studies of Bos- poran coins from the fourth century B.C. to the fourth century A.C. and coins of the Pontic kingdom of Mithridates VI, M.J. Treister traces the use of copper-based alloys in the context of the economic and political history of Bosporus: Bulletin of the Metals Museum (Japan Institute of Metals) 13 (1988) 1-22. Epigraphy. Y.G. Vinogradov has compiled in ArhVest 31 (1978) 301-16 a bibliography on Greek epigraphical studies published in the former USSR up to the year 1978 and subsequent to the publication of three books: V.V.

Peters is de- voted to bone-carving of this region: Kostereznye delo v antichnykh gosudarstvakh Severnogo Prichernomorya (= Boneworking in the Ancient States of the North Coast of the Black Sea, Moscow 1986)*. Ceramics. Trade amphoras, so often the subject of study by specialists in the West, have also been widely considered by Russian and Ukrainian scholars. Two articles readily available to Westerners have appeared in J.-Y. Empereur and Y. Garlan eds., Recherches sur les amphores grecques (BCH Suppl. 13, Paris 1986): D.B. Shelov, "Les amphores d'argile claire des pre- miers siecles de notre ere en mer Noire" (395-400); and A.N. Shcheglov, "Les amphores timbr6es d'A- mastris" (365-73). Amphoras of Amastris, located in Turkey on the south coast of the Black Sea east of Heraclea, have been found in the region under re- view. We also wish to draw attention to the following articles and books in Russian. In KSIA 174 (1983) 8- 10, I.B. Brashinskiy disputes the hypothesis proposed by V.V. Ruban in Issledovaniya po antichnoy arkheologii Severnogo Prichernomorya (= Studies in Classical Ar- chaeology of the North Pontic Region, Kiev 1980) that amphoras of Zeest type III,9 are of Attic manufac- ture, arguing instead that their place of manufacture is not yet resolved. V.V. Ruban discusses the chronol- ogy of red clay amphoras of the seventh to fifth centuries in KSIA 197 (1990) 12-19. Amphoras found in Olbia are classified by N.A. Leypunskaya, Kerami- cheskaya tara iz Olvii (= Ceramic Containers from Olbia, Kiev 1981). A monograph by S.J. Monakhov, Amphory Hersonesa Tavricheskogo IV-II vv. do n.e. (= Amphoras of Tauric Chersonesos of the IVth-IInd Centuries B.C., Saratov 1989) is devoted to the amphoras of the fourth to second centuries. Monakhov considers am- phora production in Hellenistic Chersonesos in VDI 1984:1, 109-29* and the methodology of calculations of the capacity of amphoras in Antichnyy mir i arkheo- logiya (= Classical World and Archaeology) 6 (Saratov 1986) 106-14. An article by S.J. Monakhov and E.J. Rogov in Antichnyy mir i arkheologiya 7 (1990) 128-53 covers finds of amphoras in the late fourth-third century B.C. necropolis of Panskoye in northwestern Crimea. In SovArch 1988:3, 198-206*, S.J. Vnukov classifies the light clay amphoras dating from the first century B.C. to the first century A.C. found in settle- ments of northwestern Crimea. Colchian amphoras from northwestern Crimea are discussed by Vnukov and G.R. Tsetskhladze in Pamyatniki zheleznogo veka v okrestnostyakh Evpatorii, 170-85. F.V. Shelov-Kovedyayev in BCH Suppl. 13 (Paris 1986) 9-29 surveys the subject of trade amphora stamps in the former Soviet Union: "Histoire et 6tat actuel de l'6pigraphie c6ramique grecque (amphores et tuiles) en Union Sovi6tique." Not mentioned there are two more recent publications: one by V.I. Kats on the typology and chronology of Chersonesian magis- trate stamps in VDI 1985:1, 87-13, and another by A.B. Kolesnikov on amphora stamps from excavations of estates near Eupatoria in VDI 1985:2, 67-94*. Hellenistic relief ware is the subject of a dissertation (1989) by S.A. Kovalenko and an article by him in SovArch 1988:2, 237-42. Note also the short piece by V.A. Goroncharovskiy in KSIA 174 (1983) 66-69.

Sorokina discusses glass- making centers of the North Pontic region in her dissertation (1988); J.L. Shapova also considers the subject in Ocherki istorii drevnego steklodeliya (= Essays on the History of Ancient Glassmaking, Moscow 1983) 139-65. Sorokina has published a bibliography on glass manufacture of the first century A.C. in this region in Arkheologicheskiye issledovaniya na yuge Vos- tochnoy Evropy (TrudyGIM 70, Moscow 1989) 142-49. Glyptics. O.J. Neverov has presented a typological study of metal rings of the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods found in the North Pontic region in Antichnaya torevtika (= Classical Metalwork, Len- ingrad 1986) 17-27. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES Before moving on to a survey of specific archaeo- logical sites we should draw attention to several studies on the identification and location of sites. First there is a continuation of the topographical study by M.V. Agbunov on this subject (begun in VDI 1981:1, 124- 44 and referred to by Hind 77, 79) in VDI 1983:4, 110-19 and 1984:4, 124-41*. Second, in SovArch 1987:3, 40-52*, V.G. Zubarev and A.A. Maslennikov have made an attempt to place on a modern archae- ological map the European Bosporus towns men- tioned in Ptolemy's Geography. S.R. Tokhtasjev dis- cusses passages from Hecateus (FGrHist 1 F211), Strabo (11.2.10), and Ptolemy (5.8.2) attempting to localize the sanctuary of Aphrodite Urania in Asian Bosporus, perhaps near Hermonassa: VDI 1986:2, 138-45*. Third, I.I. Vdovichenko and S.G. Koltu- khov discuss in VDI 1986:2, 145-56* the ancient for- tifications in northern Crimea, including the walls of Asander, in the light of literary testimonia and histor- ical geography. See also B.S. Mosejchuk in KSIA 174 (1983) 74-77 on the identification and excavations of the Ak-Kos rampart in northern Crimea. The Lower Dniestr Basin. Moving clockwise around the shores of the Black Sea in the region covered by this survey we start with the area of the estuary of the Dniestr (fig. 1). First some general bibliography. The results of excavations of sixth- and fifth-century B.C. settlements in this region are pre- sented in S.B. Okhotnikov, Nizhnee Podnestrovye v VI- V vv. do n.e. (= The Lower Dniestr Basin in the VIth and Vth Centuries B.C., Kiev 1990). Collections of articles on the archaeology of the region appear in the following books: Pamyatniki rimskogo i sredneve- kovogo vremeni v Severo Zapadnom Prichernomorye (= Monuments of the Roman and Early Medieval Period in the Northwestern Pontic Region, Kiev 1983); Ranniy zheleznyy vek Severo-Zapadnogo Prichernomorya (= The Early Iron Age of the Northwestern Pontic Region, Kiev 1984); Severnoe Prichernomorye (Materialy po arkheo- logii) (= The North Pontic Region [Materials on Ar- chaeology], Kiev 1984); Pamyatniki drevney istorii Fig. 2.

We may also single out two articles: E.A. Symanovich, "The Finds of the Antique Period from the Village of Belen'koe, Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy District," KSIA 168 (1981) 48-50, and T.V. Blavatskaja, "A Grave Stele and an Altar from the Village of Belen'koe," KSIA 168 (1981) 50-56. Tyras. Tyras is located near modern Belgorod Dniestrovsky. The city, founded in the sixth century B.C., was destroyed in the mid-first century B.C. It was replanned and for some time garrisoned with Roman troops, and then again destroyed in the mid- third century A.C. A great medieval fortress, called the White Fortress or Belgorod in Russian (hence the modern name), covers much of the ancient city. Minns recounts old investigations of the site in Scythians and Greeks 445-49; Hind 77-78 gives a summary of more recent work; further information can be found in a report by D.B. Shelov in Heinen 350-51 and in three recent books that also include bibliography: Antich- naya Tira i srednevekovyy Belgorod (= Classical Tyras and Medieval Belgorod, Kiev 1979); P.O. Karyshkov- skiy and I.B. Kleyman, Drevniy gorod Tira (= The Ancient City of Tyras, Kiev 1985) and T.I. Samoylova, Tira v VI-I vekakh do n.e. (= Tyras in the VIth to Ist Centuries B.C., Kiev 1988). A team from the Institute of Archaeology, Kiev, and the Odessa Museum has been excavating the site. The finds are in the Odessa Museum. I.B. Kleyman has kindly provided the following information. The current work has taken place in the central section of the east part of the cape formed by the curve of the Dniestr estuary (fig. 2). Below the levels of the Golden Hoard and Late Antique periods, the excavators found a house (N4) of the second-third century A.C. (walls N431, 442, 452) and the remains of a street with a drain consisting of channels and pits (N464, 465, 378). In the southern wall of the house (N4) was a fragmentary marble relief with the frontal image of a warrior carrying an oval shield of Galatian type (I.B. Kleyman in Novye issledovaniya po arkheologii Sever- nogo Prichernomorya [Kiev 1987] 46-52). The dwell- ings facing the street were adjacent to the curtain wall (N37) of the Hellenistic defenses (N460, 481-83).

Among the finds were stamped tiles of three legions (the 5th Macedonian, 1 Ith Claudian, and 1st Italic), coins of Tyras and the Roman Empire, two intaglios with heads of Zeus and Helios, and a red-glazed vessel in the shape of a ram. A marble votive plaque bearing a dedication to Askle- pios and Hygieia from the physicians of the Roman garrison (fig. 3) was found nearby (P.O. Kary- shkovskiy in Novye issledovaniya po arkheologii Sever- nogo Prichernomorya [Kiev 1987] 52-56). An earlier find, made in 1978, of a dedication in Latin by a Roman centurion born in Ancyra and dated to be- tween A.D. 146 and 161, has been published by N.A. Son in VDI 1986:4, 60-68*. Fibulas from Tyras are published by E.L. Gorochovskij and N.A. Son in Ar- kheologiya (Kiev) 1989:3, 69-78*. A Roman sword scabbard from Tyras is published by E.V. Chernenko and V.M. Zubar' in SovArch 1989:3, 250-53. Earlier remains, of late Hellenistic buildings, were found below house N4. They in turn lay over a com- plex of buildings with material of the third and second centuries B.C. and over a section of a street of the same period. In the east row of rooms in house N7 the team excavated a cellar room (N446), a paved court (N439), and a ground floor room (N447).

Kleyman in Arkheologicheskiye pamyatniki stepey Podnestrovya i Po- dunavya (Kiev 1989) 19-25. This weight, together with a fragment of a measuring vessel bearing the stamp of the agoranome Herakleides, argues for the existence of an agoranome's collegium in fourth- and third-century B.C. Tyras. The recent excavations have brought to light de- fensive constructions belonging to two complexes and have clarified the east sections of the succeeding pre- Roman fortifications. The west section of the walls has not been found, possibly because it lies under the Medieval fortress. The first line of defense, of the fourth century, protected the cape (where the town was situated) from the south; later, in the third cen- tury B.C., after joining the southeastern part of the cape to the territory of the town, the defensive func- tions passed to newly built fortifications with a round tower (N68) and curtain walls on the south end. The earlier walls were partially dismantled and the south- ern part of house N7 (N395 and 409) was built over this level. The curtain wall (N72) was then incorpo- rated into the town's buildings. A wall with a stone base for a bronze statue, inscribed with a decree in honor of Autokles, dates to the third/second century B.C. This reveals the close connections between Tyras, Histria, and Nikonion. Nikonion. The site of Nikonion is located at mod- ern Roxolanskoye across the Dniestr estuary from Tyras. Like Tyras, Nikonion was founded in the mid- sixth century B.C. After disasters in the fourth and second centuries B.C. it flourished into the fourth century A.C. Hind 78 briefly summarizes, with bibli- ography, the excavations of the late 1950s, the early '60s, and mid-'70s. D.B. Shelov has a report in Heinen 352. Since 1985 a joint expedition of Odessa Univer- sity and the Odessa Museum, directed by N.M. Sek- erskaya, has excavated the site. The finds are in the Odessa Museum. Sekerskaya has kindly provided the information for this report. The buildings of the northwestern part of the up- per terrace, where the current work has been focused, have been attributed to three periods: the fifth cen- tury B.C., the late fourth and first half of the third century B.C., and the first century A.C. The buildings in this part of the site are of relatively late date. The earliest belong to the second and third quarters of the fifth century. Six rectangular pit-shelters, which prob- ably functioned as dwellings, were excavated and range in size from 10 to 18 m2. The excavators were able to trace details of their interiors: clay floors, remains of staircases, hearths, partitions, and storage pits. Household pits had been dug near the pit-shel- ters. Foundations of the north defense wall, 1.1 m in width, probably dating from the second quarter of the fifth century B.C., were uncovered in the northern part of the excavated area. A variety of fifth- and fourth-century B.C. wares were found in this area: pottery from Chios, Thasos, Lesbos, Mende, Samos, Heraclea, and Athens (fig. 4). The remains of houses and a drain are attributable to the late fourth and early third centuries B.C. By the middle of this period imports from Athens and Heraclea had virtually disappeared, superseded by items from Sinope and Chersonesos. Twenty graves, belonging to the fourth and third centuries B.C. to judge from the finds, were excavated in a necropolis situated to the east of the site. To the first century A.C. belong the remains of stone foundations of houses as well as the stone pave- ments of rooms, courtyards, and household pits. A typical feature is the use of mudbrick walls on stone</page><page sequence="13">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 533 Fig. 5. Kosharskoye settlement. Red-figure krater of Kerch style depicting an Amazonomachy. foundations. Children's urn burials were excavated beneath the floor level in the rooms near the walls. Kosharskoye Settlement. The Kosharskoye settle- ment, situated within a 4-ha square on the right bank of the Tiligul estuary, has been excavated since 1955 and an associated necropolis has been dug since 1967. The information presented here has kindly been fur- nished by E.A. Levina. E.A. Symanovich has identified the site with ancient Odessos, mentioned by Classical authors, although to date no corroborating epigraph- ical or other data have been found: VDI 1954:4, 146- 50. The establishment of the settlement probably should be associated with the expansion of Olbia in the early fourth century B.C. The site was occupied for only a relatively short time, into the mid-third century B.C. The earliest period is represented by one room of a building constructed of large limestone slabs and blocks and containing six pithoi and a series of house- hold pits. Regular town planning seems to have begun in the third quarter of the fourth century. Three houses and their associated streets have been exca- vated in the northeastern quarter of the site. The streets, 3-6 m wide, are paved with stone slabs, and one had an associated drain. The houses covered 160 m ; in plan they had several rooms facing onto a central court. Some rectangular rooms, ranging in size from 7.5 to 11.0 m2, had hearths. The finds affirm trade with Heraclea, Chios, Thasos, Sinope, and Cos. Much of the pottery is handmade Scythian. Among the finds are a red-figure krater of Kerch style with an Amazonomachy (fig. 5) and a fourth-century B.C. terracotta statuette of a drunken Herakles. A necropolis with pit burials and barrows was lo- cated north and northwest of the settlement. Forty burials were excavated, some of them cremations. Imported Greek pottery predominated among the offerings. A marble gravestone and a limestone altar were found near the graves. Leuke. The island of Leuke (White Island, later Phidonisi, now Zmeinyy Island), situated ca. 45 km east of the Danube delta, almost due south of Tyras, was known to early Greek poets as the site of a sanc- tuary of Achilles. Investigations took place as early as the 1840s, and in 1841 the site produced a fragmen- tary kantharos (now in the Odessa Museum) potted by Nikosthenes and signed by Epiktetos (ARV2 77, 87; G.A. Dzis-Raiko et al., Odesskiy Arkheologicheskiy</page><page sequence="14">534 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOOV [AJA 97 Muzey AN USSR [= Odessa Archaeological Museum, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev 1983] 35, fig. 55). A report by N.V. Pyatysheva on work carried out much more recently has appeared in TrudyGIM 40 (1966) 58-70 and Hind 78 mentions the site. In 1988- 1990 an expedition from the Odessa Archaeological Museum directed by S.B. Okhotnikov and A.S. Os- troverkhov continued work on the island and in the surrounding waters. These two scholars have fur- nished the information printed here. The finds are in the Odessa Museum. To the rather skimpy material that has already been associated with the Temple of Achilles the recent campaign has added a marble slab with lead clamps and the letter lambda cut on one side. Late sixth- or early fifth-century painted simas of Milesian manu- facture, also found, may have belonged to the temple. Judging by the fluted calypters, the temple was still in use in the first century A.C. Some pottery has also been recovered. The earliest fragments, of East Greek manufacture, belong to the late seventh and early sixth century B.C. More numerous are sherds of late sixth- and early fifth-century Attic black-figure vases. New finds have significantly augmented the corpus of graffiti recording dedications to Achilles; some pre- serve the names of the dedicants and their ethnics. A vessel with the head of a Silen belongs to the Helle- nistic period. Roman pottery is represented by red- glazed plates and bowls, Roman glass by flasks. Tiles bear the names of the 5th Macedonian legion and the Moesian fleet. Underwater research has revealed ceramics and tiles. Six anchor stocks were found, 100-150 m off the beach at a depth of 9-12 m. Five were of lead, one of stone; they range in date from the sixth century B.C. to the third century A.C. These finds assist in plotting where ships were moored and help substan- tiate statements in ancient authors regarding the con- venient harbors on Achilles' island (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux. 34; Philostr. Heroicus 19.16). Olbia. Olbia, one of the richest sites in the North Pontic region, is situated along the estuary of the river Bug. The city was founded by Milesian colonists in the first half of the sixth century B.C. and prospered through the fourth century B.C. Beginning in the third century Olbia was invaded by Sarmatians, Scyth- ians, and Getae. The city declined in the Roman period. Olbia was built on two terraces, one forming the Lower Town along the river, the other the Upper Town, which included an agora and temenos with sanctuaries to Zeus and Apollo Delphinios. Extensive necropolises lay to the north and west beyond the city walls. The Russian excavator Farmakovskiy began work there about the turn of the century and exten- sive excavations have continued ever since. E.H. Minns summarized, with bibliography, the results of work at Olbia between 1915 and 1945 in a review article, "Thirty Years of Work at Olbia," JHS 65 (1945) 109-12. Boardman continued the account through 1962 in AR 1962-1963, 42-43; Gorbunova reported on work conducted at Olbia from 1965 to 1970 in AR 1971-1972, 50. The discoveries of the 1970s are covered by Hind 78-82; see also D.B. She- lov in Heinen 353-60.

Skrzhin- skaya examines the Hellenistic dress of the Olbiopo- lites in Arkheologiya (Kiev) 1990:4, 29-42*. Excavations. S.D. Kryzhytskiy and V.V. Krapivina have kindly supplied the following information. N.A. Leypunskaya has excavated the area designated NGSju near the center of the Lower Town. There late fourth- and early third-century levels were over- laid with 3 m or more of alluvial soil washed down from the slope of the upper terrace. In the fourth century it is likely that this area was devoid of build- ings and functioned as an agora or temenos. Leypunskaya and T.L. Samoylova excavated section NGSs along the northwestern edge of the Lower Town close to the posited line of the north defensive wall. These excavations revealed traces of buildings from the fifth century B.C. to the first century A.C. (fig. 6). Proper city life, however, is little in evidence after the second century B.C. No remains of late Archaic habitation were found in situ, thus support- ing the hypothesis that the Lower Town was settled later than the Upper Town where earlier buildings, dating from the second half of the sixth century B.C., have been uncovered. The remains of fourth-century B.C. buildings excavated here are limited to cellars and an altar constructed of a large, reused limestone slab on a stone pavement. Three oval boulders and a conical stone bowl had been placed on the slab. Three cross streets and part of an area associated with the third- to second-century B.C. houses were almost completely cleared. Here the street grid was rotated about 15' from that of the Lower Town to the south, confirmation that Olbia lacked a uniform, rectilinear building plan (S.D. Kryzhytskiy, Olviya: istoriografi- cheskoye issledovaniye arkhitekturno-stroitelnykh kom- pleksov [Kiev 1985] 128-29). Sometime in the third century B.C. a landslide heavily damaged this densely populated area and it was then abandoned. Only after half a century did rebuilding start. The plans of the damaged buildings are well preserved: the streets were between 1.8 and 3.0 m wide and have gutters; the houses, not less than 200 m2 in size, were of typical Greek plan. The houses in this quarter were probably aligned with the north defensive wall of the Lower Town, although remains of the wall have not yet been revealed. A second- century B.C. inscription has, however, been found with a dedication of the fortification wall to Demeter, Kore, Pluto, and Demos (N.A. Leypunskaya, Arkheo- logiya [Kiev] 1990:3, 117-22*). In the Upper Town, A.S. Russyayeva continued work in section AGD in the west temenos, an area datable to the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. and associated with the cult of Apollo the Healer (Russyayeva in Antichnye drevnosti Severnogo Pricher- nomorya [Kiev 1988] 166-74). Here were found re- mains of more than a dozen stone rectangular altars,</page><page sequence="16">536 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 Fig. 7. Olbia. Late sixth-early fifth century B.C. temple foundations, Upper Town. two round altars, the remains of an Attic portico, the east and west walls of the temenos, and the wall of a separate area within the temenos having its own pro- pylon. The temple dates from the late sixth to early fifth century B.C. and is the earliest known of the North Pontic region. Its plan can be reconstructed on the basis of the trenches of the robbed-out walls and two sections of floor in situ. The temple was in antis or prostyle with a main facade about 7.30 m wide (fig. 7). Within the temenos several bothroi of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. were found together with var- ious other ceramics, as well as a unique complex of painted Ionic architectural terracottas of Archaic date: fragments of simas, calypters, antefixes, acro- teria, etc. (see A.S. Russyayeva in Antichnye drevnosti [supra] 33-51). Remains of a stone acroterion and two Ionic bases of Asia Minor type, painted red and grooved to accommodate a wall, were also discovered in the west temenos. The temenos was in use until the second century B.C. In addition to Apollo the Healer, other deities were worshipped: Cybele, the Dioscuri, Hermes, and Aphrodite. Fragments of monumental sculptures, including a marble statue of Apollo and reliefs of local limestone depicting Cybele, have been found. Beginning in 1979 and continuing from 1982 to 1990, V.V. Krapivina, Institute of Archaeology, Kiev, directed excavations in the southeast part of the Up- per Town (R-25), the Roman citadel. On the terraced slope, remains of buildings of several periods from the first to the third centuries A.C. were uncovered. The earliest activity, dating from the first century to the first half of the second century A.C., is repre- sented by an assemblage of household pits and a Doric portico, the latter perhaps from a temple. In the second half of the second century, with the appearance of a Roman garrison in Olbia and the construction of a citadel in the southern part of the Upper Town, the region was leveled and laid out anew. A length of the southwest defensive wall, 2.0- 2.6 m wide, together with houses of the lower terrace adjacent to the wall, belongs to that period. In the upper part of the terrace several houses and a trans- verse street were unearthed. Here evidence of fire and destruction was found, dating to the third century A.C. and possibly the result of the so-called Scythian or Gothic wars. The latest period is represented by poor remains of several rectangular houses and a street attributable to the third century and first half of the fourth century; this is the latest habitation level so far found at the site. Construction belonging to the Archaic period is rare, probably because of extensive later rebuilding activity in this part of the site. Nevertheless, household pits and pit-shelters datable to the second half of the sixth and early fifth century B.C. indicate that the southern part of the Upper Town was first inhabited no later than the Archaic period. Fragments of vases from the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. have also been found but not in their original context.</page><page sequence="17">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 537 Fig. 8. Olbia necropolis. Fifth-century B.C. pit-shelters. An expedition of the Institute of Archaeology, St. Petersburg, has conducted smaller scale excavations in Olbia: V.I. Denisova working in the town, and K.K. Marchenko, J.V. Domanskiy, and Y. Vinogradov in the environs of Olbia. Denisova has published a fourth-century B.C. building inscription in SovArch 1982:1, 95-104, and in SovArch 1988:1, 251-56 a gravestone with an epigram of the first half of the third century B.C. The results of work by the St. Petersburg team during the period 1951-1970 are published in E.I. Levi, Olviya: Gorod epohi ellinisma (= Olbia: The City in the Hellenistic Period, Leningrad 1985). Olbia Necropolis. In the 1980s, J. Kozub, Institute of Archaeology, Kiev, excavated in the necropolis of Olbia. Here fifth-century B.C. pit-shelters (fig. 8) were constructed in front of the town walls (K.K. Mar- chenko, VDI 1982:3, 126-52*). The first-century A.C. tombs that were explored had rectangular chambers and inclined, and often stepped, dromoi. The rich and varied finds from the new excavations have not yet been published, but 266 tombs of the Archaic necropolis excavated by B.V. Farmakovskiy between 1902 and 1915 are now published in V.M. Skudnova, Arkhaicheskiy nekropol Olvii (= The Archaic Necropolis of Olbia, Leningrad 1988). The finds from these tombs are housed in the Hermitage. Environs of Olbia. K.K. Marchenko and J.V. Do- manskiy describe the excavations at Staraya Bogda- novka in ArkhSbErm 22 (1981) 62-74 and 24 (1983) 56-72*, and report on Kutsurub 1 in KSIA 174 (1983) 37-40 and ArkhSbErm 27 (1986) 48-50*. In the chora of Olbia efforts have been concentrated in the late Archaic settlements. A.S. Russyayeva and S.N. Mazarati have worked at Shirokaya Balka and S.B. Buyskikh and V.M. Otreshko have conducted excavations at Kozyrka IX and XI, where a fine red- figure skyphos was found (fig. 9). Buyskikh, Otreshko, and V.V. Ruban have worked at Chertovatoe VII; Buyskikh has also explored Beykush. In recent years S.B. Buyskikh has excavated the Hellenistic settlement in the eastern part of the Olbian chora, near the village of Glubokaya Pristan on the right bank of the Dniepr estuary. Here, for the first time, fortifications in the form of ramparts and ditches were found in the rural countryside around Olbia. This discovery has implications for the rela- tionship between the Olbian polis and Chersonesos, on the one hand, and the population of the lower Dniepr fortified settlements, on the other. Up to now more than 150 Hellenistic rural settlements, all un- fortified, are known from this area. These excavations also suggest that the change from pit-shelters to sur- face constructions of stone and mudbrick took place in the fifth and early fourth century, rather than in the Archaic period when the Greeks first settled in this region, as stated earlier by S.D. Kryzhytskiy in Olviya 60-63. The results of the 1988 excavations of the fourth- and third-century necropolises of the Olbia chora are</page><page sequence="18">538 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G.

Snytko, Materialy po arkheologii Olviyi i ee okrugi (= Materials on the Archaeology of Olbia and Its Environs, Kiev 1990). Berezan'. Berezan', an island at the entrance to the estuary of the Bug and Dniepr rivers, is now no more than 900 x 320 m. At one time it may have been connected to the mainland; now it is separated by about a mile and a half of very shallow water. The island was first occupied in the late seventh century B.C. and was largely abandoned by the end of the fifth century when Olbia became the dominant town of the region. Some later remains, including Roman and Medieval, have also been found at the landing on the east shore. The habitation quarters and the ne- cropolis have been excavated periodically since the 19th century. Unfortunately, the tombs have suffered from looting. As Hind 79 reports, V.V. Lapin exca- vated on the east side of the island from 1959 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1975; L. Kopeykina excavated on the northwest end from 1970 to 1978 and in 1980, digging both in the settlement and in the necropolis. J.V. Domanskiy, director since 1982 of the Hermi- tage Museum expeditions, excavated in both the set- tlement and the necropolis. The finds from his work are in the Hermitage. The Institute of Archaeology, Kiev, with S.N. Mazarati and V.V. Nazarov as expe- dition directors, has also undertaken work at the set- tlement. Two reports give information on the excavations from 1982-1988: J.V. Domanskiy, Y.G. Vinogradov, and S.L. Solovyev in Drevniye pamyatniki kultury na territorii SSSR (= Ancient Monuments of Culture in the Territory of the USSR, Leningrad 1986) 25-32; and J.V. Domanskiy, Y.G. Vinogradov, and S.L. Solovyev in Itogi arkheologicheskikh expeditsiy Gosudarstvennogo Ermitazha (= Results of the Archaeological Expeditions of the State Hermitage, Leningrad 1989) 33-60. In the latter publication several fragments of Rhodian-Ion- ian vases and of a fine late sixth-century red-figure Attic cup with komos scene are illustrated. Twelve sixth- and early fifth-century B.C. scara- boids of Naukratite manufacture from both the set- tlement and the necropolis are published by A.O. Bolshakov and Y.I. Ilyina in VDI 1988:3, 51-67*. A black-figure Attic skyphos by the Theseus Painter of ca. 510 B.C. is published by Y.I. Ilyina in SoobErm 52 (1987) 31-33*. J.V. Domanskiy has kindly provided the following information regarding the most recent excavations of the Hermitage team, which have been concentrated in the northwestern part of the island, at the periph- ery of the ancient settlement (sector A) and in the necropolis (sector B). Items from the earliest history of ancient Borysthenes came to light. More seventh- century B.C. painted pottery comes from the Berezan' settlement than from any other North Pontic site. Habitation sites. The 1989 excavations revealed a rectangular pit-shelter (N51), 3.8 x 5.0 m and 1.0 m deep, partly overlaid by later constructions. East Greek painted pottery found at the site dates this</page><page sequence="19">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 539 complex to the last quarter of the seventh century B.C., making it the earliest reliably dated habitation area on the site. Its location at the periphery of the settlement suggests that there was probably a dense concentration of contemporaneous buildings in the center of the town, i.e., in the northeastern part of the island near the ancient harbor. Fifty-five pit-shelters can be dated to the sixth cen- tury B.C. Sixty percent of them are round, and the rest are oval or rectangular in plan. Each occupied between 5 and 14 m2 and were usually about 1 m deep. Details of interior construction, including a mudbrick wall in one, confirm their use as dwellings. One pit-shelter (N41), covering 27 m2, combines ele- ments of semisubterranean and surface construction. It includes stone orthostats, unique among Archaic dwellings of the region. This house may be dated to the first half of the sixth century B.C. and confirms that large stones were used in houses at least by this time. Pit-shelters survived until the later sixth century B.C. In the same quarter of the site, surface buildings were constructed using stone and mudbrick. Excava- tion of the latter took place in an area of some 60 x 40 m on an east-west axis. Nine houses and a paved street were revealed. Similar streets bordered the quarter. The rooms of the houses faced an inner court. One house of ca. 250 m2 had five rooms with mudbrick walls on stone socles facing a paved court. In the court a limestone slab altar, a well, and a household pit were discovered. This area flourished from the last quarter of the sixth through the first third of the fifth century B.C. Several inscriptions from Berezan' have been pub- lished. A sacred graffito, dating to the third quarter of the sixth century B.C. and cut on a bone plaque, was excavated about 1980 by V.V. Lapin. It provides much information on the history of Milesian coloni- zation of the Lower Bug region (A.S. Russyayeva in VDI 1986:2, 25-64*). W. Burkert has reinterpreted the graffito as an oracular text of Didyma referring to Olbia (VDI 1990:2, 155-60*). F.V. Shelov-Koved- yayev published an inscription found in 1988, a ver- sified Greek dedication to Achilles Pontarches dating to the first century A.C. The text suggests that Bere- zan' was already an island by that date (VDI 1990:3, 49-62*). Pottery excavated in the houses at Berezan' is treated in two articles with English summaries in Khu- dozhestvennye izdeliya antichnykh masterov (= Artistic Ware of Classical Craftsmen, Leningrad 1982): L. Ko- peykina, "Rhodian-Ionian Seventh-Century B.C. Ce- ramics from Berezan' Island as a Documentary Source for the Early History of the Settlement" (6-35); and K.S. Gorbunova, "Attic Black-Figure Pottery from the G Excavation Area in Berezan Island (1962-1971 Field Seasons)" (36-49). In addition, L. Kopeykina has published an Attic black-figure amphora datable to ca. 560 B.C. from the 1974 excavations (SoobErm 47 [1982] 39-41). Hind 79 mentioned a fragmentary, unpublished Chian chalice in the Kiev Museum show- ing a rider; the chalice fragments have now been illustrated in Kultura naseleniya Olvii i ee okrugi v arkhaicheskoye vremya (= Culture of the Population of Olbia and its Environs in the Archaic Period, Kiev 1987) 45, figs. 17.1, 18. Also illustrated are many fine frag- ments of other early East Greek vases. I.V. Ksenofon- tova surveys the first-century A.C. ceramics in TrudyErm 24 (1984) 138-46*. Berezan' Necropolis. Y.G. Vinogradov reports: In 1990, in the northwest cape of the island, the excavation of the necropolis was nearly completed. Work here was initiated by G.L. Skadovskij, who ex- cavated some 600 burials of various types in 1900 and 1901: V.V. Lapin, Grecheskaya kolonisatsiya Severnogo Prichernomorya (= Greek Colonization of the North Pon- tic Region, Kiev 1966) 110-21. Excavation was contin- ued by K.S. Gorbunova, who explored an additional 16 graves in 1967-1968; see K.S. Gorbunova, Drevniye greki na o. Berezan' (= Ancient Greeks on Berezan' Island, Leningrad 1969) 20-25. Work in the necrop- olis was conducted systematically from 1976 to 1990 (with the exception of 1981). During this period a further 213 graves were cleared. They have been published in J.V. Domanskiy, Y.G. Vinogradov, and S.L. Solovyev, Drevniye pamyatniki kultury na territorii SSSR (Leningrad 1986) 32-36, figs. 2, 7, 8 and in Itogi arkheologicheskikh expeditsiy Gosudarstvennogo Er- mitazha (Leningrad 1989) 38-60, figs. 1, 4-5, 15-19. One hundred fifty-one burials, excavated between 1982 and 1990, range in date from the first half of the sixth to the first half of the fifth century B.C. Only six (ca. 4%) were cremations, the rest inhumations. Ten (ca. 7%) were children buried in amphoras or urns. Approximately 5% of the deceased did not die of natural causes, but had been killed, possibly in conflict with the local tribes. Most of the graves con- tained the standard inventory of offerings: amphoras, jugs, and oinochoai of both light and gray ware; black- glaze, black-figure, and red-figure bowls and lekythoi (e.g., fig. 10); askoi, small Chian jugs, Ionian gutti, and Corinthian aryballoi. Two burials contained dam- aged red-figure kraters of the fifth century B.C. Ad- ditionally there were bronze needles, iron knives, and whetstones. Ornaments consisted of glass beads, bronze and iron bracelets, bronze and silver rings,</page><page sequence="20">540 MICHAILJ. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 Fig. 10. Berezan' necropolis. Black-figure lekythos. earrings, and pendants. Dolphin-shaped money was also present. Except for bronze arrowheads associated with those who had been killed (about 10 burials, mostly of the late sixth or first half of the fifth cen- tury), arms were not represented. Kerkinitis. Kerkinitis (modern Eupatoria), a Greek colony on the northwest coast of Crimea, was founded in the late sixth or early fifth century B.C. on the site of an earlier settlement. Kerkinitis prospered during the late fourth century B.C. after it came under the control of Chersonesos. The settlement provided Chersonesos with grain, and, at the same time, traded with the Scythians. These tribes captured Kerkinitis in the mid-second century B.C., occupying it until the early centuries A.C. Systematic study of the ancient city beneath modern Eupatoria began in 1980 under the direction of V.A. Kutaysov of the Crimean Department of the Institute of Archaeology, Kiev. For the results of earlier work on the site and of Kutaysov's excavations through 1986, see V.S. Drachuk and V.A. Kutaysov in VDI 1985:1, 82-87; PECS 449, s.v. Kerkinitis (T.S. Noonan); and Kutaysov, Antichnyy gorod Kerkinitida (= The Classical City of Kerkinitis, Kiev 1990). J.G.F. Hind has also reported on the site in Hind 83. For a preliminary publication of the necropolis, see S.B. Lantsov, Nekropol antichnoy Kerkinitidy: Istoriya i itogi izucheniya (= The Necropolis of Classical Kerkinitis: History and Results of Studies, Kiev 1989). The site covers an area of 400 x 135 m, and the strata within the defensive walls, 4.5-5.0 m thick, provide a record of two main periods of occupation, ranging in date from ca. 470 to 113/2 B.C. The colony was established during the second wave of Ionian (Milesian) colonization, between the third quarter of the sixth century and the first quarter of the fifth century B.C. At that time there were perhaps 100 colonists. The earliest Greek settlement consisted of pit-shelters dug in sandy soil over a region mea- suring about 0.8-1.0 ha. Between 470 and 460 B.C., a defensive wall was built, enclosing about 3.2-3.3 ha. The excavated por- tions of the fifth-century wall are between 1.25 and 1.48 m wide. In the mid-fourth century B.C., foun- dations were dug deep into the subsoil, and the wall was widened to 1.5-1.8 m. The area within the walls was divided into equal grid-sections, where dwellings were built. Each section of the grid occupied approx- imately 2,000 m2 and was surrounded by streets that were 3.0-4.0 m wide. In the mid-fourth century it is possible that there were as many as 17 or 18 grid- sections within the walls, each one containing 16 or 17 houses. Most of the houses were 85-115 m2 in size, with two stories, and contained three to four rooms grouped around a small courtyard in the typical Greek scheme. In the early fifth century there were probably 170 houses, accommodating a population of 1,200 to 1,400; by the late fifth century B.C., there were 220 to 230 houses and 1,600 to 1,800 inhabi- tants; and in the third quarter of the fourth century, 270 to 290 houses with 2,000 to 2,400 inhabitants. The plans of 14 houses are known. One belonging to the third quarter of the fourth century has an andron with a pebble floor (see V.A. Kutaysov in SovArch 1985:3, 178-90). A southwest-northeast orientation of the town was retained during two subsequent phases of construction and expansion, which accom- modated the growth in population from the late fifth to the third quarter of the fourth century B.C. A</page><page sequence="21">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 541 house of the Hellenistic period has been published by Kutaysov in SovArch 1987:1, 169-82. Building activity in Kerkinitis during the second half of the second century B.C. was carried out by the Scythians, who had just captured the town from Cher- sonesos. The Scythian settlement was in turn de- stroyed by the Pontic troops of Mithridates VI under the command of Diophantos. The site was then re- turned to Chersonesos, but the town was never re- built. Rural estates excavated in the vicinity of Kerkinitis have been published by D.B. Shelov in Heinen 366- 68; in Hind 83; by A.B. Kolesnikov in Antichnye sel- skiye usad'by v okruge Evpatorii (= Ancient Rural Es- tates in the Area of Eupatoria, Diss. Moscow 1985); by G.M. Nikolayenko in KSIA 182 (1985) 11-15; by E.N. Zherebtsov in KSIA 182 (1985) 38-45; and by S.A. Kovalenko in Pamyatniki zheleznogo veka v okrestno- styakh Evpatorii (Moscow 1991) 6-36. The third-century B.C. fortified settlement of Chaika, which was probably used for storing agricul- tural products from nearby unfortified settlements before transport to Chersonesos, has been published by I.V. Yatsenko and T.N. Turina in Pamyatniki zhe- leznogo veka v okrestnostyakh Evpatorii (Moscow 1991) 82-154, and by Yatsenko in KSIA 174 (1983) 18-26. V.M. Zubar', S.G. Koltuchov, and V.L. Mytz discuss a fortified settlement found in 1990 3.5 km from the mouth of the Alma River, and southwest of the mod- ern village of Vilino. The site is square in plan, mea- sures 70 x 70 m, and has been partially destroyed by modern agricultural activity. The stratigraphy of the site can still be seen, as well as remains of a mudbrick and stone wall. Close to the wall a limestone grave stele, similar to Hellenistic anthropomorphic monu- ments from Olbia and Bosporus, was found. Frag- ments of third- to second-century B.C. Sinopian and Chersonesian amphoras, four with stamps, were also excavated. This fortified settlement, another one 3.5 km to the southwest, and traces of field boundaries near both sites suggest that the region belonged to the Chersonesian state from ca. 300 into the second century B.C. In the late second century, after the wars between Chersonesos and the Scythians, the latter settled in the region. Scholars now believe that the agricultural territory of Chersonesos in the Hellenistic period may have included the western Crimean coastline all the way to Kerkinitis, making the territory of Chersonesos considerably larger than was once thought. On the organization of the Chersonesian chora, see M.I. Zo- lotarev in VDI 1981:4, 144-50. Western Crimea Chersonesos and Its Chora. Chersonesos lies on the west coast of the Crimean peninsula, ca. 3 km west of modern Sebastopol, in what was southwestern Tauris. It was founded in 421 B.C. by colonists from Herakleia Pontica, and became both the major Greek city and the major trade center in the region of Tauris. Chersonesos controlled both Kerkinitis and Kalos Li- men in the third century B.C. Mithridates Eupator of Pontus saved Chersonesos from the Scythians in the second century B.C., and thereafter it survived only as one of the cities in the Bosporan kingdom. The information on the nine archaeological expe- ditions covered in this report was provided by M.I. Zolotarev, Chersonesos Archaeological Museum. The finds from all of the sites are kept in the local museum in Chersonesos. For general reports on the region, see PECS 221-22, s.v. Chersonesos (M.L. Bernhard and Z. Sztetyllo); Hind 83-85; D.B. Shelov in Heinen 360-65; and M. Koromila, The Greeks in the Black Sea (Athens 1991) 147-57. Chersonesos. A.V. Sazanov of the Institute of Ar- chaeology in Moscow excavated a well (N K-4) in the northeastern part of the site. The well was 6.8 m deep and filled with debris dating from the first half of the fourth to the second half of the third century B.C. An investigation of sixth- and fifth-century strata in sector VII of the same area provided evidence for an Archaic, pre-Ionian, settlement on the site. In the eastern part of this quarter, oval pit-shelters cut in the rock were overlaid by mid-fourth century B.C. walls. For the pre-Ionian settlement, see Y.G. Vinogradov and M.I. Zolotarev in Le Pont-Euxine vu par les Grecs (Paris 1990), and Zolotarev in Arkheologiya (Kiev) 1990:3, 68-76. The Crimean Department of the Institute of Ar- chaeology, Kiev, under the direction of O.I. Dom- brovskiy, investigated the skene building of the theater at Chersonesos, including fill in its cellar, the backside of the skene, and the left parodos. The cellar fill yielded remains of the tile roof, architectural de- tails, a herm of Dionysos, and a fragment of a lime- stone frieze with reliefs of Achilles and an Amazon. Excavation of the right parodos beside the defensive wall of the site revealed six different street levels, paved with pottery and pebbles, and three drains. In the pre-theater levels there were traces of metallurgi- cal activity dating to the mid-fourth century B.C. The evidence places the construction date of the theater at the end of the fourth or the beginning of the third century. The theater survived until the fourth century A.C.</page><page sequence="22">542 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 Fig. 11. Chersonesos. Sectors III and V of the northeastern part of the site. M.I. Zolotarev directed excavations on behalf of the Chersonesian Museum in the northeastern part of the site, sectors III and V (fig. 11). A thick layer of mid- fourth century B.C. debris contained numerous am- phoras, plain and coarse pottery, and black-glazed and red-figure vases (e.g., fig. 12). Several Apollo protomes and ceramic beads were found in an Archaic sanctuary that was apparently dedicated to the god. Furthermore, several deposits yielded dozens of Her- aclean amphora stamps. These should help establish a more precise chronology for the stamps. Eleven round and oval pit-shelters, cut into the soft upper marl layer of bedrock, were found for the first time on this site. They are the earliest dwellings of Doric Chersonesos, predating the surface houses built in the same region of the city. About a dozen intact amphoras, as well as black-glazed and handmade pot- tery of the late fifth to the first quarter of the fourth century B.C., were found on the floors of these dwell- ings. An oval pit excavated in the center of this part of the city was filled with Archaic amphora fragments. Attic black-glazed pottery and an ostrakon made of a Proto-Thasian amphora fragment date from the late sixth to the first half of the fifth century B.C. S.B. Sorochan of Kharkov University continued excavations in the central harbor region, studying Hellenistic and late Roman levels in the rooms of private houses, as well as a fourth-third century B.C. cellar. The principal drain, some 15 m long, was also uncovered. Several rooms of a barracks building (ca- serna) also contained fourth- to third-century B.C. levels. An interesting bronze ring found there is dec- orated with a lion holding a spear in its jaws, as on Chersonesian coins of 330-320 B.C. V.M. Zubar' of the Institute of Archaeology in Kiev continued excavating pit burials near the western de- fense walls of Chersonesos on the east slope of the Peschanaya Gully. Seven graves and two tombs were explored (N 82-90), all of them cut in the bedrock. N 85 is a child's burial in an amphora, and N 86 contained evidence of about 400 burials, ranging in date from the first century A.C. to the 12th/13th century. Analysis of the remains suggests that in the early centuries A.C. this section of the necropolis had been used for children's burials. The Heraclean Peninsula. V.I. Kuzishin directed Moscow Lomonosov University's investigation of an estate (N 132) located on a gentle slope on the east branch of the Juharine Gully. Five rooms of the estate, a defensive tower, and a cellar were excavated in an area of ca. 500 m2. There were three building periods: the first half of the third century B.C.; the second half of the third to the early second century B.C.; and the late second to first century B.C. In room N 4 more than 30 rusted limestone blocks were found. These were first explained as masonry, but later they were recognized as blocks removed from the defensive tower. The tower had two rooms and a cellar with eight pithoi of the late fourth to third century B.C. The cellar was used for the storage of wine and in- dicates the specialized nature of the economy of the Heraclean Peninsula.</page><page sequence="23">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 543 Fig. 12. Chersonesos. Fourth-century B.C. red-figure vase fragments. A.A. Zedgenidze of the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow continued excavations on the Mayachnyy Peninsula at a site tentatively identified as the Cher- sonesos mentioned by Strabo. In the area within the walls two phases dating to the fourth century B.C. were studied. The site was destroyed in the late fourth century B.C. O.Y. Savelya excavated on behalf of the Chersone- sian Museum in the eastern Heraclean Peninsula. Remains of a tower measuring 9.5 x 10.5 m were discovered at Tash-Kulle on the slope of Mt. Sapun, at the junction of the Inkerman and Balaklava valleys. The tower was built in the early third century B.C. and destroyed by fire and partly disassembled ca. 200 B.C. Hellenistic settlements were excavated on the southwest slope of Mt. Gosfort and on the crest of Mt. Sapun; three additional Hellenistic settlements were revealed in surveys of the Baidar and Varnaut valleys. Finally, a small necropolis of the first century A.C. was excavated at the mouth of the Belbek River. E.Y. Turovskiy of the Chersonesian Museum ex- plored an estate (N 46) in the central part of the Heraclean Peninsula. The estate was established in the late fourth century B.C., but no date for its de- struction has been fixed even though all of the build- ings seem to have been dismantled in the middle of the third century B.C. At that time the stones were taken to Chersonesos to strengthen the city's defen- sive walls. Doric buildings of the fourth and third centuries B.C. at Chersonesos are discussed by B.N.

V.P. Tolstikov, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, reports: Pantikapaion was the capital of the Bosporan king- dom and a major port city on the Black Sea coast. Now on the outskirts of the modern port city of Kerch, Pantikapaion was built on the site of an earlier settle- ment named Panti Kapa, founded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the late seventh to early sixth century B.C. The city occupied the top of Mt. Mithridates, its slopes, and a lower seaside terrace. Strabo, Pliny, Dio- dorus, Pseudo-Scymnes, Pseudo-Arrian, Ammianus Marcellinus, and other ancient authors mention the city. Excavations at Pantikapaion were first conducted during the 1820s and 1830s, and continued sporad- ically into the early 20th century. Systematic study of the site began in 1945 under the direction of V.D. Blavatskiy. The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Mos- cow has sponsored the excavations since 1959, first under the direction of I.D. Marchenko, and, from 1977 to the present, under V.P. Tolstikov.

The acropolis is now known to have included the top of Mt. Mithridates, and to have been framed by the rocky upper plateau, the so-called First Step of Mt. Mithridates, and the western plateau: Tolstikov, SoobGMII 7 (1984) 28-56. Recent excavations have concentrated on the west- ern plateau of Mt. Mithridates.

A dedication on the sacrificial table made by a certain Dedmotis (Sena- motis?), daughter of the Scythian king Skiluros, throws light on the political relations between the Bosporan kingdom and the Late Scythian kingdom in the Crimea during the reign of the Bosporan king Perisades V (ca. 140-111 B.C.). See V.P. Tolstikov and Y.G. Vinogradov in VDI 1987:1, 55-87 and 88- 114. A fragmentary Neo-Attic marble hekataion found in the sanctuary is published by L.I. Akimova in VDI 1983:3, 66-88. First-century A.C. levels have recently been inten- sively studied. A street runs across the western plateau from west to east, with a water supply and drainage system connected to a cistern measuring ca. 7 x 10 m across and more than 3 m deep. Major efforts have been concentrated on a photo- grammetric investigation of the central part of the western plateau. Here a large architectural complex occupying more than 1,500 m2 was revealed. The complex is rectangular in plan, and included a paved peristyle court, which was probably framed by a two- story colonnade, Doric on the first story, Ionic on the second. The walls of the rooms adjacent to the court- yard were decorated with polychrome painted plaster, and the floors were paved either with flagstones or with mudbrick. In the center of the complex, there was a basin for water storage, and 5 m north of the basin was a well lined with coursed limestone. The well has been excavated to a depth of 7 m. Outside, it is faced with white mortar. A stone foundation for a bastion or a tower in the center of the outer western wall suggests that the complex was fortified. Among the many finds from the rooms, the basin, and the well in this complex are plain, black-glazed, and relief-decorated Hellenistic pottery, amphoras, coins, fragmentary terracottas, part of a marble ac- roterion, a marble plate decorated with a rosette, and some carved ivory. There were also fragments of marble sculpture of high quality, as well as a fragment of a decree dating to the reign of Perisades I (second half of the fourth century B.C.). The inscription was once imbedded in the wall of the main building in the complex (F.V. Shelov-Kovedyayev, VDI 1988:4, 81- 83). Another decree, dated to the reign of Leukon I, was found in the central section of the plateau in 1976. It has been published together with a third decree of the same period from the north slope of Mt. Mithridates. Both concern grants of rights and privileges to foreigners. Twelve such decrees are known at present (F.V. Shelov-Kovedyayev, VDI 1985:1, 57-72; 1988:4, 83). A second-century B.C. stone matrix for stamping gold foil ornaments sug- gests that there may have been a goldworking shop in the complex (M.J. Treister in Kochevniki evrasiyskih stepey i Antichnyy mir [= Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes and the Classical World, Novocherkassk 1989]; JWalt 48 [1990] 29-35). The location of the complex in the center of the western plateau, its enormous dimensions, the so- phisticated construction techniques, the lavish archi- tectural decoration, as well as the nature of the finds, suggest that this was a palace (V.P. Tolstikov in Demo- kratie und Architektur 77). The palace was erected on the ruins of an earlier monumental building complex, dated to the late fifth or the first half of the fourth century B.C. The andron of the earlier structure was paved with a pebble mosaic bordered with red plaster 0.9 m wide (fig. 13). To date, this is the earliest known pavement of its kind in the North Pontic region. The later palace was built in the last third of the fourth century B.C. and was repaired or reconstructed sev- eral times. In the third century B.C., an earthquake destroyed the colonnade in the peristyle courtyard. In the first half of the second century B.C., the column drums were reset, and vertical cuts were made in preparation for fluting. The work was not completed, however, and 17 column drums were thrown into the well. The rooms of the palace were ruined, perhaps by fire. After the palace was abandoned, its walls were</page><page sequence="26">546 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 Fig. 13. Pantikapaion. Andron with pebble mosaic from late fifth/early fourth century B.C. used as a source of stone. In the debris layer, coins and hundreds of fragments of Megarian bowls allow the refilling of the trenches to be dated to the last quarter of the second century or perhaps the early first century B.C. In the northern part of the central section of the plateau traces of a defensive wall and bastions were found, built just before Mithridates VI came to the Bosporan throne. The wall partly overlay the north- ern outer wall of the palace, whose blocks were used for its construction (M.J. Treister, ArchNews 14 [1985] 64). Red-glazed lagynoi and glass vessels of Italic or Gallo-Roman manufacture from the early excavations of the necropolis at Pantikapaion have been published by E.K. Sokolova and N.Z. Kunina respectively in TrudyErm 24 (1984) 125-37 and 147-64. Twenty-two pieces, presumably from the necropolis, were ac- quired in 1981 for the Hermitage (N.Z. Kunina, SoobErm 48 [1983] 33-37). A red-glazed vessel in the shape of the head of Herakles, found in the necropolis in 1905, has been identified by D.S. Gertsiger as an idealized image of Mithridates VI (SoobErm 46 [1981] 43-44). For black-glazed pottery from Pantikapaion in the collection of the Pilsen Museum in western Bohemia, see D. Braunova in Graecolatina Pragensia 9 (Acta Universitatis Carolinae-Philologia 1, 1982) 7- 34. Black- and red-figure vases, imported Hellenistic pottery, Megarian bowls, and carved ivories excavated at Pantikapaion between the late 1950s and the early 1970s are published in SoobGMII 7 (1987) 57-180. Gold-stamped plaques from a fourth-century B.C. Scythian kurgan (tumulus tomb) at Kul-Oba near Pan- tikapaion have been published by L.I. Kopeykina in Antichnaya torevtika (Leningrad 1986) 27-63. A silver bowl from the same kurgan decorated with figures of Scythians is most recently considered by I. Marazov in VDI 1988:4, 103-109. Round-bottomed silver ves- sels are discussed by N.L. Grach in TrudyErm 24 (1984) 100-109. O.D. Chevelev reports on two first- century A.C. tombs in the Pantikapaion necropolis that were decorated with frescoes in Skifiya i Bospor (Novocherkassk 1989) 46-47. Nymphaion. The Hermitage Museum has spon- sored excavations on the site of ancient Nymphaion and its necropolis since 1939. N. Grach has directed the excavations since 1966. For general reports, see</page><page sequence="27">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 547 D.B. Shelov in Heinen 373; Hind 86-87; and PECS 636, s.v. Nymphaion (T.S. Noonan). For the results of the excavations from 1973 to 1987, with further bibliography, see N. Grach in Itogi arkheologicheskikh expeditsiy Gosudarstvennogo Ermitazha (Leningrad 1989) 61-79. Grach has also published a Hellenistic fresco with inscriptions and a depiction of a Ptolemaic ship (VDI 1984:1, 81-88; Arkheologiya (Kiev) 57 [1987] 81-94; Skythika n.s. 98 [1987] 87-95). Other finds from Nym- phaion include fourth- to third-century B.C. pottery from the 1970 excavations (O.Y. Sokolova, Drevniye pamyatniki kultury na territorii SSSR [Leningrad 1986] 43-57); two glass jugs from the Rhine region exca- vated in the necropolis (Khudozhestvennye izdeliya an- tichnykh masterov [Leningrad 1982] 119-24); a fifth- century B.C. bronze oinochoe found in a kurgan in 1876 (SoobErm 47 [1982] 41-43); and a fifth-century B.C. bronze statuette of an athlete that originally belonged to a lamp stand (Skulptura v Muzeye [=Sculp- ture in the Museum, Leningrad 1984] 5-11). Myrmekion. Myrmekion lies 4 km east of Panti- kapaion (see D.B. Shelov in Heinen 374; Hind 87). Excavations were conducted by V.F. Gaydukevich of the Institute of Archaeology in St. Petersburg between 1957 and 1965. A general survey of the excavations has been published by V.F. Gaydukevich, Antichnye goroda Bospora: Mirmekiy (= Classical Cities of the Bosporus: Myrmekion, Leningrad 1987). Y.A. Vinogra- dov is now in charge of the expedition to Myrmekion. Akra. Akra is mentioned by Strabo (11.28), by Pseudo-Arrian (76), and by Pliny (HN 4.86). The ancient settlement has tentatively been identified with Cape Takiel. Excavations were carried out at the site in 1975-1976. The upper levels yielded pottery of the fourth to third century B.C., and the lower levels sixth- to fifth-century B.C. pottery. The finds are published by N.V. Moleva in Antichnyy mir i arkheo- logiya 7 (1990) 122-28. Tiritake. Tiritake, modern Kamysh Burun, is lo- cated in the European Bosporus. It is mentioned by D.B. Shelov in Heinen 373-74 and by Hind 87. Ex- cavations have shown that V.F. Gaydukevich was probably wrong to date the destruction layers as early as the third to fourth century A.C. The ceramic finds are comparable to North Pontic and Mediterranean pottery dated between the late fourth/early fifth cen- tury and the second quarter of the sixth century A.C. In line with the new dating, A.V. Sazanov and Y.F. Ivashchenko have proposed that King Gord's destruc- tion of the cities of the European Bosporus occurred in the second quarter of the sixth century (SovArch 1989:1, 84-102). Porthmeus. E.G. Kastanayan and, since 1986, M.Y. Vakhtina have directed the excavations at Porthmeus on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology in St. Pe- tersburg. The site lies at a strategic point on the northwestern coast of the Kerch Strait, from which the city could control the crossing of the straits. Thus Porthmeus was fortified from the late sixth century B.C. onward. A fourth-century B.C. grave stele for Neumenis, the wife of Aramat, was found in 1983; it is the earliest known inscription from the site (E.G. Kastanajan, VDI 1987:2, 85-87). Iluraton. V.A. Goroncharovskiy, Institute of Ar- chaeology, St. Petersburg, reports: Iluraton was a fortified agricultural settlement that served as a border fort for Pantikapaion (fig. 14). The site is located on a high hill overlooking miles of the steppe and is somewhat difficult to locate. Investiga- tion of this first- to third-century A.C. fortified site and its necropolis has been in progress since 1947. Since 1983 the excavations have been led by V.A. Goroncharovskiy. There have been numerous publi- cations of the site, including V.F. Gaydukevich in MIA 85 (1958) 9-148; Gaydukevich in Bosporskiye goroda (= Bosporan Towns, Leningrad 1981) 76-136; I.G. Shurgaya in KSIA 143 (1975) 102-108; V.A. Goron- charovskiy in KSIA 182 (1985) 79-82; Goroncharov- skiy and V.P. Nikanorov in VDI 1987:1, 201-13; M.M. Kublanov in KSIA 128 (1971) 78-85; Kublanov in Nauchno-ateisticheskiye issledovaniya v muzeyakh (= Sci- entific-atheistic Studies in Museums, Leningrad 1983) 96-128; Kublanov and V.A.

Shelov in Heinen 375; Hind 87; and PECS 408, s.v. Iluratum (M.L. Bernhard and Z. Sztetyllo). Major efforts between 1986 and 1990 were concen- trated on the excavation of the northwest fortification wall and various building complexes. The slope of the site forms a small terrace below the latest defensive wall, which was built in the first half of the third century A.C. In the central portion of the northwest wall, two defensive lines about 30 m apart were joined with a wicket. A tower whose foundation measures 6.0 x 6.0 m and a section of wall about 2.0 m long and 0.8 m thick belonged to a proteichisma. The tower flanked a passage about 2.5 m wide, with a staircase that was probably originally locked with a wicket. A two-room house has a passage 1.3 m wide and a central staircase that led to the front of the tower. The house partly overlaid an ash pit that was in use until the early third century A.C.</page><page sequence="28">548 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 / V //-.

In the center of Iluraton, excavation of a wine- making complex has continued since 1981 (fig. 15). In its northwestern part, a stone weighing 1.4 tons was found; it belonged to the press. A storeroom with three pithoi set in the clay floor has also been uncov- ered (V.A. Goroncharovskiy in KSIA 182 [1985] 89- 92). In the upper necropolis of Iluraton, about 180 m southeast of the site, 50 burial complexes, including ritual grounds and horse burials, were excavated be- tween 1986 and 1990. In the northern part of the necropolis a chamber tomb (N 52) datable to the late second or to the first half of the third century A.C. was excavated. A corridor consisting of well-cut reg- ular limestone blocks leads to a single chamber that contained several burials in stone boxes as well as pit burials. Near the tomb a terracotta statue of a woman, ca. 0.62 m tall, was found; it is the first of its kind to come to light in the Cimmerian Bosporus. A round building ca. 7 m in diameter was excavated 50 m southeast of tomb N 52. There were two burials inside. One contained a pear-shaped glass vessel and a bronze coin of Arcadius (A.D. 395-408). This evi- dence suggests that the round building was built after the destruction of the fortress. In the southern part of the necropolis, a second- to third-century A.C. tomb (N 37) was excavated. It had two rooms lined with limestone blocks and was origi- nally faced with red-painted plaster. Nearby there were pit burials of the late second and early third century. Near the modern village of Ivanovka a necropolis of the second half of the first to the third century A.C. has been explored. The deceased were usually buried in stone boxes (fig. 16); sometimes stone slabs were simply laid over a burial cut into the earth. Female burials usually contained glass paste, cornelian, and chalcedony beads, as well as a bronze mirror, and</page><page sequence="29">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 549 Fig. 15. Iluraton. Wine-making complex. sometimes a bronze needle-case, and either a red- glazed or a gray-ware basin placed at the woman's feet. Graves of men were normally equipped with long swords and spearheads. Zenon Chersonesos. A.A. Maslennikov, Moscow Institute of Archaeology, directed the excavation of a fortified site, perhaps Zenon Chersonesos, located at Cape Zyuk on the Sea of Azov. Besides a general publication by Maslennikov and O.D. Chevelev in KSIA 168 (1981) 79-83, articles have been devoted to the graffiti and the dipinti (Maslennikov, KSIA 191 [1987] 45-53) and to the black- and red-figure pottery (Maslennikov and V.N. Rozov, KSIA 197 [1990] 66- 73). Rural Settlements in the European Bosporus. A.A. Maslennikov directed the East Crimean expe- dition for the Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, from 1986 to 1990 and has kindly provided the following information. The major investigations concentrated on the south coast of the Sea of Azov, a populous and busy region during antiquity. The mid-fourth to mid-third century B.C. settle- ment of Generalskoje-West was actually a complex of interrelated structures linked by common fortifica- tions. A large building with rusticated exterior walls and three square towers was excavated. At a later date, one tower was taken down and replaced by a Fig. 16. Iluraton. Stone cist grave.</page><page sequence="30">550 MICHAILJ. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 vineyard. A nearby dwelling had a rectangular court- yard with an enormous grain storage pit, measuring ca. 5.5 m in diameter. On the seacoast near the small rocky cape port buildings and a well were excavated. Among the finds are more than 1,000 amphora stamps from Sinope, Thasos, Heraclea, and other centers, and more than 250 brick stamps, 80 graffiti, about 100 coins, some bronze arrowheads, terracottas, lamps, and stone shots. Pottery consisted of some black-glazed ware, plain red-ware, and handmade pieces. This area, one of the richest in the chora of the Bosporus, was de- stroyed in the mid-third century B.C. See A.A. Mas- lennikov and O.D. Chevelev in KSIA 168 (1981) 79; KSIA 182 (1985) 50-56. A rich settlement was located on the long narrow cape of Lake Chokrak, a gulf of the Sea of Azov in antiquity. In the center of the site was a nearly square monumental structure measuring ca. 420 m2 with rusticated outer walls up to 2.1 m thick. The site was inhabited from the fourth to the late first century B.C., at which time it was destroyed by fire. The third- to second-century B.C. "Steep Bank" settlement had small rectangular buildings and nar- row streets. It was defended by a 1.8-m thick fortifi- cation wall consisting of narrow wicket laid with stone. Another settlement of the same period, known as Zolotoye-East, is the largest along the Azov coast. It is remarkable for its fortifications. The limestone de- fensive wall is up to 2.8 m thick and incorporates large and small bastions as well as a gate, 3.2 m wide. On both sides of a broad street leading away from the gate are dwellings that have yielded stamped am- phoras, terracottas, and coins. The "Glade" settlement, dating to the first century B.C., is composed of several blocks of houses that contain small rooms. Excavation of one of the towers near the so-called Uzunlar Rampart revealed a small building (12 x 11 m) that was constructed no earlier than the mid-first century B.C. and destroyed at the end of that century. This seems to confirm Strabo's account of Asandros's construction of a defensive line along the Kerch Peninsula (V.K. Golenko in Skifiya i Bospor [Novocherkassk 1989] 72-73). A site known as "Artesian," whose citadel was sur- rounded by a large ditch or fosse, yielded traces of houses and pits dating between the mid-first century B.C. and the mid-third century A.C. Excavations at Cape Kazantip and elsewhere on the peninsula yielded perhaps 100 graves in various ne- cropolises, including several Late Antique tombs with long dromoi and deep niches. Grave goods included glass vessels, jewelry, red-glazed and plain pottery, armor, and coins. Forty-four first-century A.C. graves in the necropolis at Kyz-Aul were dug by O.D. Chev- elev of the Kerch Archaeological Museum between 1979 and 1981 (KSIA 182 [1985] 84-89). Interesting evidence relating to the seismic history of the region and to its ecology has also been uncov- ered. All of the archaeological finds are now in the Kerch Museum. They throw new light on the nature of Bosporan rural settlements. A.A. Maslennikov has distinguished three major types of settlement, each of which can be subdivided. His typology makes it pos- sible to locate a new settlement within the Bosporan administrative and economic systems (Maslennikov, SovArch 1989:2, 66-78; D.B. Shelov in Heinen 375- 77). Geroyevka I. V.A. Goroncharovskiy, Institute of Archaeology, St. Petersburg, has studied the rural settlement known as Geroyevka I, and furnished the following information: Geroyevka I lies on a rocky cape 2.5 km from the village of Geroyevskoye, and 3.5 km west of Nym- phaion. I.T. Kruglikova excavated the southern part of the settlement in 1956-1957 and 1963 (Kruglikova, Selskoye hozyaystvo Bospora [= Agriculture of the Bos- porus, Moscow 1975] 39-42). Excavations begun in 1986 revealed five building periods in a region ca. 1,000 m2: 1) an unfortified settlement with both sur- face and pit dwellings existed in the late sixth to early fifth century B.C.; 2) ruins of a big building date to the last quarter of the fifth century; 3) a fortified complex of the first half of the fourth century, with a tower and a defensive wall 1.4 m thick, had rooms concentrated around a central court; 4) a complex was built over the ruins of the early fourth-century structures during the late fourth or early third cen- tury, at which time rooms were added to the old outer wall; and 5) the courtyard of the complex was paved during the late third/second century B.C. This chro- nology coincides with that of Chersonesian settle- ments as well as those of the Olbian chora, and is probably tied to political changes in the steppes of the North Pontic region. Mikhaylovka Settlement. A fortified settlement near the village of Mikhaylovka was excavated by the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow, under B.G. Pe- ters, between 1963 and 1983 (KSIA 182 [1985] 23- 27; see also Hind 87). The following chronology has been proposed for the site. In the first half of the fifth century B.C., an agricultural settlement was estab- lished near Nymphaion. In the fourth to early third century a royal fortress was razed during the inter-</page><page sequence="31">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 551 ! : ? i ; : . . . . -: v??: ... :. ? iii iii i : -----':::?: . ......... ........ . ..??~- .... .............. .: :: : :.::  .. .. :i :: .. .. . .. .

Stamped amphoras, coins, terracottas, and other finds from the late fourth- to mid-third-century set- tlement are analyzed in the context of trade links with other Bosporan centers by B.G. Peters and A.G. Avdeyev in SovArch 1990:4, 207-23. Avdeyev, A.P. Abramov, and Peters analyze amphora stamps and black-glazed pottery in SovArch 1989:4, 182-95. First- century A.C. amphoras and jugs are published by Peters and Abramov in KSIA 191 (1987) 53-57. The Lower Don Taganrog Settlement. K.A. Semina, Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, has kindly provided the follow- ing information: The northernmost Archaic Greek settlement in the Black Sea region was located near modern Taganrog. The site is under water today. Only the pottery has been studied; sherds are often found after low tides or storms. Pottery found during the 1930s and 1950s as well as that from V.D. Blavatskiy's underwater expedition of 1960 is housed in the museums of Ta- ganrog and Rostov (Hind 88). Sherds found in 1989-1990 include amphora frag- ments (Lesbian, Chian, etc.) and Archaic plain pot- tery, as well as a few fragments of East Greek pottery. Ten sherds belong to so-called bird-vessels (fig. 17). On one of them, the head of a bird, a semicircle, and a drop are shown; on another, there is only a semicir- cle. The remaining eight are decorated with hatched rhomboids and with groups of hatchmarks. Of about the same date are fragments of bowls with sets of triple lines and five rays above the base, probably originally belonging to rosettes. Normally, the rosettes and the vertical lines in the pattern around the han- dles are large. One rosette is star-shaped. Also rep- resented in the collection are Ionian cups of types Al, A2-B2, and B3, the most numerous being those of the A2 type. All of these ceramic finds suggest that the settlement at Taganrog was established no later than the first quarter of the sixth century B.C., prob- ably close to 600 B.C. Tanais. T.M. Arsenyeva, Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, reports: Tanais lies on the right bank of the Mertvyy Donets, a branch of the Don River delta (fig. 18). Strabo states that the city was founded in the early third century B.C. Tanais was a commercial center that provided a link between the Graeco-Roman cities of the Black Sea and the cities north of the Sea of Azov. The Bosporan king Polemon destroyed Tanais at the end of the first century B.C., but it revived during the next century and flourished until it was destroyed, probably by the Goths, in the mid-third century A.C. A brief revival in the late fourth century lasted into the first half of the fifth century. Excavations at Tanais were initiated in 1955 under the direction of D.B. Shelov and have continued un- der T.M. Arsenyeva. Finds are housed either in a small museum at the site or in the Rostov Museum. See Shelov in Heinen 387-89; PECS 877, s.v. Tanais (M.L.

View of excavations. senyeva, KSIA 174 (1983) 100-108; Arsenyeva and S.A. Naumenko, KSIA 191 (1987) 75-83. Shelov has proposed that Hellenistic Tanais (early third to late first century B.C.), although founded by Bosporan Greeks, was not part of the Bosporan king- dom, but rather an independent polis exhibiting a peculiar dualism as a result of the presence of two different ethnic communities. Only the eastern part of Tanais continued to be inhabited between the first and third centuries A.C. Excavations in recent years have concentrated in that region. Few traces remain of the Hellenistic buildings that were destroyed during Imperial construction. In the southwestern part of this region, however, the foundations of the third-century B.C. defensive wall were uncovered. Further to the west, another defen- sive wall and a tower were built in the second century B.C. The configuration of the Hellenistic defensive system remains obscure, however, because of later construction in the area. A street running from west to east, and joined by four narrower streets, was uncovered in the central part of the excavated area. All were bordered with stone slabs and paved with sherds, including many Rhodian stamped amphora handles, which fix the construction date in the late third to second century B.C. The streets, ca. 1 m thick from numerous repav- ings, were in use until the mid-third century A.C. The city blocks formed by these streets were of varying dimensions. There are almost no remains of Helle- nistic dwellings; only one third- to second-century B.C. cellar has been found, overlaid by a first-century A.C. cellar. The Hellenistic cellar yielded a Rhodian stamped amphora fragment and a piece of black- glazed West Slope ware. During the early second century A.C., Tanais was converted into a well-defended fortress, rectangular in plan (225 x 240 m). The south wall was recon- structed at this time, and was 4.5 m thick. A southern entrance flanked by two towers yielded an inscription recording that the gates were reconstructed in A.D. 229. Inside the town walls the typical house plan consisted of rooms grouped around stone-paved courtyards, the latter housing water-storage tanks. The economy of Tanais was based upon farming, cattle-breeding, fishing, and various crafts such as bone-carving and bronze- and ironmaking. Of partic- ular interest are the remains of glass manufacture. Glass slag and a crucible were found as well as pat- terned molds (perhaps imported) of the kind used to decorate hemispherical bowls and phialai made in the Rhine region. Among the imported Roman objects are bronze statuettes (fig. 19) and utensils. Found in a cellar and</page><page sequence="33">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 553 Fig. 19.

Roman bronze statuette. possibly of Bosporan manufacture is a silver perfume bottle with an egg-shaped body, a cylindrical neck, loops on both sides of the body, and a silver chain for attaching a lid. The body of the bottle is decorated with gold wire and inlaid garnets. With the perfume bottle were found gold plaques, silver staters, and beads. D.B. Shelov has published the dipinti on amphoras excavated in the 1950s and 1960s and dated to the first half of the third century A.C. in Numizmatika i epigrafika 15 (1989) 97-125. L.M. Kazakova discusses the first-century A.C. rooftiles from Tanais in KSIA 191 (1987) 83-89. T.M. Arsenyeva considers certain types of red-glazed pottery in KSIA 182 (1985) 77- 84. Terracotta and bronze lamps and bronze cande- labra, mostly of the first century A.C., along with some Roman imports, are published by Arsenyeva in Sve- tilniki Tanaisa (=Lamps from Tanais, Moscow 1988). Arsenyeva also considers bronze statuettes from the site in Problemy antichnoy kultury (Moscow 1986) 129- 35. Tanais was destroyed and burned in the early 250s A.C., no doubt by the Goths. The latest coins found at the site were struck for Rescuporis V in A.D. 250 (A.I. Anisimov in Skifiya i Bospor [Novocherkassk 1989] 128-30). The latest period in the town's history is marked by an increase of "barbarian" influence. Occupation continued in the main rectangular area, but houses, some now apsidal in plan, were built over earlier streets. There are also some round buildings dating to this period. Pottery is primarily handmade, with close parallels to that of the Chernyakhov cul- ture, and it is likely that in the fourth-fifth century Tanais was largely populated by the Chernyakhov tribes. Elisavetovskoye. K.K. Marchenko, Institute of Ar- chaeology, St. Petersburg, has kindly provided the following information: Elisavetovskoye was a major Graeco-nomadic mar- ket center, located 17 km southeast of Tanais in the Don River delta. It was a fortified settlement, one of the largest in the steppe region of North Pontus, between the fifth and the first half of the third century B.C. For general reports see PECS 300, s.v. Elizave- tovskoe (T.S. Noonan); I.B. Brashinskiy and K.K. Marchenko in SovArch 1980:1, 211-18; Brashinskiy and Marchenko, Elisavetovskoye: Skythische Stadt in Don-Delta (Munich 1984); Hind 87-88; and Mar- chenko in Klio 68 (1986) 377-98. From 1986 to 1990 the St. Petersburg Institute of Archaeology, the Rostov Regional Museum, and the Rostov Pedagogical Institute sponsored excavations under the direction of K.K. Marchenko of the upper levels of the so-called acropolis. The site's fortifica- tions have also been under investigation, in order to reconstruct the defensive system of the latest period of habitation. All finds are housed in the Rostov Re- gional Museum. During the first period of habitation, in the late sixth century B.C., a winter camp at Elisavetovskoye was occupied by nomadic Scythian tribes who traded with the Greeks. In the fifth century, the seasonal camp became a permanent settlement. In the first half of the fourth century, the relatively small unfortified Scythian settlement became the largest "barbarian" marketplace in the entire northeastern Pontic region. Scythian economic activity and cultural life in the Don delta reached its zenith between the mid-fourth and early third century B.C. At that time Elisavetovskoye</page><page sequence="34">554 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 P-xx A 50 ' 0 o 58 66 o 00 0, L :2 " I Fig. 20. Elisavetovskoye. Plan. offered protection from military threat. The site's final period begins ca. 290-280 B.C., when the Bos- poran kingdom established a large Greek colony on the site. See K.K. Marchenko, V.G. Zhitnikov, and E.V. Yakovenko in SovArch 1988:3, 63-78.* It appears that two Bosporan colonies existed si- multaneously at Elisavetovskoye. One, dated between the second half of the fourth and the early third century B.C., was located in the western part of the site above the outer defensive wall of the acropolis. Excavations between 1986 and 1988 revealed a block of stone houses, a street 4.5 m wide, and a roughly worked stone wall separating the colony from the peripheral areas of the site. The plan of Elisavetov- skoye (fig. 20) seems to have been regular, with all of the main elements oriented to the points of the com- pass. The earliest Greek colony at Elisavetovskoye was relatively small and was incorporated into the site as a separate quarter. No valuable objects have been found at Elisavetov- skoye, nor are there signs of fire or destruction. Per- haps the Bosporan Greeks who lived there left the site when the Scythians did, either at the end of the reign of Eumelos or in the early years of Spartokos III (304-284 B.C.). See K.K. Marchenko in VDI 1990:1, 129-38. Evidence of a second Bosporan colony was found on the acropolis, where later building complexes fol- lowed the previously existing plan (fig. 21). The layout was a nearly regular grid divided into separate dis- tricts and quarters. Archaeological evidence suggests that the second Bosporan colony was founded at the beginning of the third century B.C., or soon after the departure of the inhabitants from the Greek quarter. There is evidence for the destruction of this apoikia some time between 270 and 260 B.C. The dates of the various phases of the site have been established on the basis of Heraclean, Thasian, and Sinopian stamped amphora handles. Those from the Bosporan colony have been published by V.I. Kats and N.F. Fedoseyev in Antichnyy mir i arkheologiya 6 (1986) 85ff. The numismatic material is treated by V.A. Goroncharovskiy in Antichnaya tsivilisatsiya i var- varskiy mir v Podonye-Priazovye (= Classical Civiliza- tion and the Barbarian World in the Don-Azov Area, Novocherkassk 1987) 10-11. A gold pendant with a stamped image of Aphrodite Urania has been pub- lished by M.Y. Vakhtina in KSIA 194 (1988) 92-95. The date of the city's destruction is discussed by V.P. Kopylov in Antichnaya tsivilisatsiya (supra) 13-15. Excavations of the defensive system south of the acropolis (sector XXVI) in 1989 and 1990 revealed fortifications belonging to two building periods dating between the second half of the fourth and the early third century B.C. Construction during the first pe- riod was of stone and mudbrick, following Greek building techniques. The second period is character- ized by fortifications of pier-type construction. An investigation of bronzeworking at Elisavetov- skoye provided typological information about bronze objects; spectrographic analysis identified eight dif- ferent copper-based alloys. Objects made of tin-lead bronze prevailed. See V.G. Zhitnikov in SovArch 1989:2, 153-68. The Taman' Peninsula and the Lower Kuban' Area The Taman' Peninsula is bordered by the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, and the Sea of Azov. During the 19th century scholars discovered many ancient towns, settlements, kurgans, and graves in the pen- insula. From the fifth century B.C. onward, Taman',</page><page sequence="35">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 555 Fig. 21. Elisavetovskoye. Third-century B.C. building complex on the acropolis. like the eastern Crimea, was part of the Bosporan state. Kepoi. V.D. Kusnetsov, Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, has kindly furnished the following infor- mation: Kepoi, a Milesian colony 3 km northeast of Phana- goria on the Taman' Peninsula, was founded in the mid-sixth century B.C. according to Strabo, Diodoros, and Pliny. The site, occupying ca. 20 ha, was first investigated between 1957 and 1970 under N.I. So- kolskiy. The inhabitants paid tribute to the Bosporan kings. Farming and trade made up the initial economy of Kepoi. Trade in wheat led to prosperity from the fourth century B.C. to the first century A.C. From the second century A.C., the Sarmatians controlled Kepoi; in the fourth century, the Huns destroyed it. See N.I. Sokolskiy in KSIA 78 (1960); 83 (1961); 86 (1961); 91 (1962); 95 (1963); 103 (1965); SovArch 4 (1964); VDI 1973:4; and in Actes de la XIIe conference internationale d'itudes classiques "Eirene" (Bucharest 1975). See also D.B. Shelov in Heinen 380-81; PECS 447-48, s.v. Kepoi (M.L. Bernhard and Z. Sztetyllo); and Hind 89. For Rhodian amphoras with graffiti from Kepoi, see N.P. Sorokina in Problemy antichnoy kultury (Moscow 1986) 195-99; for a "barbarian" im- itation of a Roman denarius see O.N. Usacheva in Problemy antichnoy kultury 199-201; on Hellenistic terracottas from the kurgan near Kepoi, see Usacheva in KSIA 174 (1983) 77-82. Excavations at Kepoi were resumed in 1984 under the direction of V.D. Kuznetsov. The campaigns of 1984-1989 revealed that on the western edge of the site, near the coastline, there were second- to third- century A.C. buildings. These were largely destroyed later, but traces of house foundations and street pav- ing prove that this was a residential quarter. The area was terraced during the Hellenistic period. Partial excavation of the uppermost terrace revealed remains of a stone staircase and a mudbrick building on a stone socle that had been severely burned. Ten pithoi set in the floor contained burned grain. Three bronze Bosporan coins from the reign of Mithridates VIII (A.D. 39-45) found in the building help date the destruction, which probably occurred during the war for the Bosporan throne between the brothers Mith- ridates VIII and Cotys (Tac. Ann. 12.15-21). A frag- mentary cuirass was also found near the building. Although Kepoi's Archaic levels were already de- stroyed during antiquity, much Archaic pottery was found on the site. Sixth-century B.C. pits dug in the subsoil yielded several hundred fragments of Attic and Corinthian vases, and East Greek pottery in the Wild Goat Style. Dishes and bowls of the Levitsky class with rosettes and lotus leaves, and Ionian cups of types B 1, A2-B2, and B3, are among the finds (fig. 22). The Attic pottery consists mostly of Little Master cups (fig. 23), but komast cups, Siana cups, a lekane lid by the Polos Painter, and a Tyrrhenian amphora were</page><page sequence="36">556 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 Fig. 22. Kepoi. East Greek ceramic imports. Fig. 23. Kepoi. Attic Little Master cup fragments. also found. Several white-slipped cup fragments in the Chian animal style also came to light, as well as a few examples of Corinthian skyphoi, amphoras, and kothoi. All of the pottery may be dated to the second- third quarter of the sixth century B.C. and supports a date for the foundation of the Milesian colony at Kepoi to the late first or early second quarter of the sixth century. Another find of special interest is the head of a Hellenistic marble statuette of Aphrodite (ht. 10.2 cm). Phanagoria. V.S. Dolgorukov and A.A. Zavoykin, Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, have kindly pro- vided the following information: Phanagoria, on the southern coast of the Taman' Peninsula, was colonized by Teos ca. 540 B.C. Al- though independent from 480 B.C. onward, the city belonged to the Archeanactid monarchy. A rich ne- cropolis attests to Phanagoria's contact with major Hellenic cities. Excavations directed by V.S. Dolgo- rukov and, since 1989, by A.A. Zavoykin, have con- centrated primarily in the southern and southeastern suburbs of the town. The excavations have yielded extremely important material for the reconstruction of the history of Phanagoria. See D.B. Shelov in Hei- nen 378-79; PECS 698-99, s.v. Phanagoria (M.L.</page><page sequence="37">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 557 Bernhard and Z. Sztetyllo); Hind 90; and M.M. Ko- bylina, Phanagoria (Moscow 1989). Finds from the site are divided between the Taman' Museum and the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. The Late Archaic and Early Classical finds are discussed by V.S. Dolgorukov in KSIA 197 (1990) 30-37. The sixth-century plan of Phanagoria was rectan- gular and measured ca. 400-450 x 500 m. Buildings in three sections of the northwestern part of the site have been excavated. More than 100 graves dating to the second half of the sixth and early fifth century B.C., covered by structures of the first quarter of the fifth century B.C., were revealed in the southeastern part of the site. Three graves of adults and six of children from one to 10 years old, as well as three babies buried in Chian amphoras, were among the first sixth-century burials to be uncovered. All of the deceased had their heads oriented to the east or the northeast. The graves may be classified under four types: 1) rectangular pits with rounded corners, lined and covered with wooden boards; 2) amphoras; 3) pits with an apsidal western wall (fig. 24); and 4) mounds. There is evidence for funeral banquets at the burial sites. In one case (N 470), over the tomb itself a kind of heroon with an apse at the west end was built of wattle and wooden pillars coated with clay. Twelve houses built of wattle and mudbrick have recently been found at Phanagoria (fig. 25). Four of the houses have connecting rooms and are oriented from west to east. Their open courtyards are paved with pottery fragments. V. Dolgorukov attributes this new building technique at Phanagoria to an influx of Fig. 24. Phanagoria. Sixth-century B.C. burial. Greek colonists after the Ionian revolt against the Persians was suppressed by the Achaemenids in 494 B.C. Two building periods have been identified. Buildings from the first period fell into disrepair because the materials used were short-lived; buildings of the second period were destroyed by fire. Weapons Fig. 25. Phanagoria. Isometric drawing of wattle and mudbrick house.</page><page sequence="38">558 MICHAIL J. TREISTER AND YURI G. VINOGRADOV [AJA 97 found in the structures suggest that the conflagration may have been the result of a confrontation between Greeks and local tribes. During the second half of the fifth century B.C., Phanagoria flourished. The period is characterized by regular town planning, stone-and-mudbrick build- ings, paved streets, rich and varied imports, and new religious and public buildings. By the last quarter of the fifth century, silver coins were minted and forti- fication walls were built. By the end of the fifth cen- tury B.C., however, Phanagoria was ruined, perhaps because the city was incorporated into the territory of the Spartokids. In the early fourth century the mint closed, and the fortifications were dismantled. New construction is documented in the Hellenistic period. The buildings are poorly preserved, but two large structures were uncovered in part in 1984-1987 and in 1990. Both buildings were first constructed in the fourth century and then rebuilt several times up to the mid-first century B.C.; one may have been a temple. Both were built of Kerch limestone and richly decorated with architectural terracottas and with po- lychrome plaster. Like many houses on the site, both buildings were destroyed in the mid-first century B.C. probably at the time of the siege of Pharnakes (App. Mithr. 108, 120). A large building set on a stone foundation was constructed over the ruins of the Hellenistic temple. South of this many-roomed building was a street paved with pottery fragments. House construction in the southern suburbs of Phanagoria was stopped in the late first century B.C., possibly after Polemon's expedition against the nearby Aspurgians (Strab. 11.2.11, 13.2.29; Dio. Cass. 11.4.24). In the first cen- tury A.C., however, building was resumed and struc- tures associated with agriculture, fishing, and pottery manufacture were constructed; 20 pottery kilns have been found. Farther to the north the remains of three vineyards have been discovered. The buildings stood until the invasion of the Huns in the fourth century A.C. Salvage excavations in the necropolis of ancient Phanagoria brought to light one Hellenistic and two first-century B.C. tombs, all robbed in antiquity, and several graves of the first century A.C. In one of these was found a wooden sarcophagus with 12 plaster masks of Gorgons, a glass dish, and a jug (T.G. Sha- vyrina in KSIA 174 [1983] 69-74). A.K. Korovina has published 338 graves excavated in 1964-1965 dating from the fourth century B.C. to the fourth century A.C., as well as metal finger rings from Phanagoria and from the necropolis of Tyramba in SoobGMII 7 (1987) 71-109, 137-46. For a late sixth-century B.C. mold fragment from Phanagoria used in casting a life-size bronze statue, see V.S. Dolgorukov in Problemy antichnoy kultury (Moscow 1986) 145-49. S.M. Krykin discusses recent discoveries of Hellenistic and first-century A.C. ter- racotta riders in KSIA 191 (1987) 57-59. Hermonassa. S.I. Finogenova, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, has kindly supplied the follow- ing information: Hermonassa, one of the largest sites on the Taman' Peninsula, is located on a high coastal plateau on the south shore near the modern town of Taman'. It was founded in the sixth century B.C., thrived during the fourth and third centuries, and survived until the 14th century A.C. Excavations have uncovered many levels to a depth of 12 m; those of the Greek and Roman periods are between 6 and 7 m deep. Arrian, Strabo, Pliny, and Dionysius "Periegetes" refer to the site. The colonists were primarily Ionians, with some Aeo- lians as well. The recent excavations at Hermonassa by the Push- kin Museum were led by A.K. Korovina until 1989 and have been directed since then by S.I. Finogenova. See D.B. Shelov in Heinen 380; PECS 389, s.v. Her- monassa (M.L. Bernhard and Z. Sztetyllo); Hind 89- 90; and M.J. Treister in ArchNews 15 (1989) 42-46. The latest excavations at Hermonassa have been concentrated on the post-antique periods. Neverthe- less, in the northern part of the site, studies of fourth- and fifth-century A.C. levels have revealed the ruins of a mudbrick hearth and a few pits filled with debris, but no architectural remains. Red-glazed plates, some decorated with stamped crosses, fragments of glass vessels, and third-century A.C. Bosporan coins have been recovered. Recent publications of the finds from Hermonassa include N.A. Sidorova's study of Archaic painted pot- tery and I.R. Pichikyan's article on two red-figure vases in SoobGMII 8, 110-25 and 126-36. M.J. Treis- ter and F.V. Shelov-Kovedyayev have published a sixth-century B.C. conical object inscribed by Cretan craftsmen: "An Inscribed Conical Clay Object from Hermonassa," Hesperia 58 (1989) 289-96. G.F. Ar- zamanov has suggested that an Ionic capital from Hermonassa of the first quarter of the fifth century B.C. (fig. 26) was made by Ephesian craftsmen for a temple on the site dedicated to Ephesian Artemis: VDI 1989:4, 49-54. A.I. Boltunova, VDI 1989:1, 86- 92, has published a first-century A.C. marble base for a bronze statue. The base, discovered in 1983, is inscribed with the name of Pythodoris, the second wife of King Polemo of Bosporus; she erected the statue in honor of her benefactress, the empress Livia.</page><page sequence="39">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 559 : r;ijjl ~ ?., r?-?I,:,, -::-;-j~ r?-t,?r;lz~?l tsCT'-'''"T'r.-';7~:4'1?!--~~-~-57j~~ ~T~Jli~~-~?I:??iS; ; ~2- .. i:.? ~-- - .

Nikolayeva, Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, has kindly supplied the following informa- tion: The fortified settlement of Ilyich in the Taman' Peninsula was built between the first century B.C. and the first century A.C., and survived until the seventh century. The site has been excavated for more than two decades under the direction of E.Y. Nikolayeva. Nikolayeva's most recent publications on Ilyich have appeared in KSIA 168 (1981) 88-93; in KSIA 174 (1983) 110-17 (pithoi of the fifth-sixth centuries A.C.); and in Problemy antichnoy kultury (Moscow 1986) 183-88 (weapons). The citadel is approximately 3,200 m2 and was surrounded by a 32-ha area fortified by a moat. To date some 2,000 m2 have been excavated (fig. 27). The exposed buildings include a barracks with 17 rooms along the western and eastern sides of the citadel, as well as three additional rooms in the north; the dwelling of the garrison commander at the north- west corner; two towers; and a glassblower's workshop near the gate at the southeastern corner of the for- tress. The citadel rests on a stone foundation, but its walls are of mudbrick. All of the buildings have two stories, plastered walls, and glazed windows. Many of the rooms adjoin the fortification walls with exits to the central courtyard. The lower floors were probably used for domestic activities, as storerooms, kilns, and agricultural implements were identified here. The upper floors served as living quarters. The citadel was destroyed by fire, preserving many organic remains. The fire must have been sudden and unexpected, to judge from the uncooled and de- formed vessels found in the glassblowing workshop. Ilyich has been identified as Trapezunda, and much attention has been paid to the levels corresponding to the Justinianic period. At that time, the garrison con- sisted of mercenaries and confederates, Goths, Alans, Bosporans, and Huns, who were engaged in farming, fishing, gardening, and various crafts. Most of the population seems to have been Christian, as many crosses and other Christian symbols have been found on lamps, vessels, and wall-plaster. A chapel has been excavated, and marble slabs and architectural frag- ments may have belonged to it. Further finds include a bronze enkolpion, glass icon-lamps with bronze chains for hanging, and bottles for lamp oil and myrrh. Red-glazed pottery is fairly common. The glassblowing workshops excavated between 1983 and 1989 produced both window glass and Christian cult vessels. C o a SI L". a so Fig. 27. Ilyich.

Fourth-century A.C. bronze Bosporan coins found with gold solidi ofJustinian prove that Bosporan coins were circulated for a period of three centuries. The so-called Ilyich Hoard, found in 1975, necessitates a revision upward of the date for the burned layers both at Ilyich and elsewhere, from the Hunnic de- struction of the fourth century to the sixth century A.C. This extends the history of Bosporus for some 200 years. Excavations at Ilyich also prove that at least this region, if not the entire Taman' Peninsula, was included within the Byzantine limes. Gorgippia. E.M. Alexeyeva, Institute of Archae- ology, Moscow, has kindly provided the following in- formation: Gorgippia, a coastal site on the Taman' Peninsula south of the mouth of the Kuban' River, is mentioned by Strabo. It was founded in the sixth century B.C. by the Greeks as a trading center, inhabited by the Sindi, and named after a member of the Spartokid dynasty. The Goths destroyed Gorgippia in the third century A.C., and although it recovered briefly, its history ends in the fourth century. The ancient town occupied an area of ca. 40 ha, and now lies beneath the modern town of Anapa. The joint excavation by the Academy of Science and the Krasnodar Archaeological Museum has been directed by E.M. Alexeyeva. See PECS 360-61, s.v. Gorgippia (M.L. Bernhard and Z. Sztetyllo); D.B. Shelov in Hei- nen 384-86; Hind 90-91; and I.T. Kruglikova in KSIA 182 (1985) 70-76 on the results of excavations from 1960-1972. E.M. Alexeyeva has published the results of excavations from 1973 to 1984 in KSIA 188 (1986) 61-69. A thorough, but earlier, work on all aspects of the site, with contributions by Alexeyeva, Kruglikova, N.A. Frolova, E.A. Savostina, M.J. Treis- ter, and G.A. Tsvetayeva, is Gorgippia (2 vols., Kras- nodar 1980 and 1982). Alexeyeva's dissertation (1990) is devoted to the history and archaeology of Gorgip- pia. She discusses the archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the economic history of the site and its place in the administrative system of Bosporus in VDI 1988:2, 66-85; her study of the religious cults ap- peared in SovArch 1986:4, 34-52. Finds from the site are stored in the museums of Anapa and Krasnodar. Nearly 7,000 m2 in the northeastern part of the site have been excavated, revealing two streets and the houses between them. The regular planning of the town dates to the second quarter of the fourth century B.C., when the Greek apoikia that had been estab- lished in the second half of the sixth century was included in the Bosporan state and named after Gor- gippos, the brother of King Leukon I. The plan re- mained unchanged until the destruction of the town in A.D. 240. The latest coins found in the burned houses are those of Ininthimeus, and date to A.D. 239. The latest houses on the site occupied ca. 500- 700 m2, each one having five to seven cellars directly accessible from the street by outdoor hatches. Shops were probably situated over these underground stor- age cellars. Many of the houses had their own vine- yards. A tower in the town's defensive system was linked to the center of town by a street 8 m wide. The third-century necropolis was located directly beyond that tower. In 1987 and 1988, a 2,000 m2 area excavated in the southwestern part of the site revealed the potters' quarter, which lay just beyond the city wall during the</page><page sequence="41">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 561 Hellenistic period. A fortified building, no doubt part of the city's defensive system, was destroyed by fire in the mid-first century B.C., to judge from the am- phoras, the plain pottery, and the imported bronze utensils found within it. A 4,000 m2 area has been excavated on the seaward side of the site, revealing 11 building periods. The earliest remains are those of partially underground pit-shelters from the late sixth- and fifth-century B.C. settlement. One of these pit-shelters produced an Ionian krater (fig. 28). Houses on stone foundations were constructed during the next three building pe- riods in the fifth century. During the fourth century, the houses of the early settlement were overlaid by a monumental building, whose limestone blocks are now to be found throughout the area. This building in turn was built over in the second century A.C. by two large houses with wine-making areas and cellars. More than 400 burials, including simple graves, tumuli, and stone-built tombs, have been excavated in the necropolis of Gorgippia. One of the finds is an impressive marble grave stele of the second century A.C. (fig. 29). In the sixth to fifth century B.C. the necropolis was located in an area that now lies beneath the northeastern part of the later town; several of the fifth-century graves are preserved between first-cen- tury B.C. cellars (E.M. Alexeyeva in KSIA 197 [1990] 19-30). Recently discovered inscriptions from Gorgippia have been published by A.I. Boltunova in VDI 1982:3, 61-78, and in 1986:1, 43-61. S.Y. Saprykin discusses two inscriptions from the reign of Sauromates II in VDI 1986:1, 62-75. Fourth-century B.C. graffiti with dedications are studied by G.I. Tsvetayeva in Problemy antichnoy kultury (Moscow 1986) 215-17. M.J. Treister has published spectroanalyses of bronzes from Gorgippia in KSIA 174 (1983) 117-24, and bronze engraved rings found in Gorgippia and its environs in VDI 1982:3, 67-78. Three gold rings set with agates, made in Italy, were found in the rich third-century A.C. tombs (S.I. Finogenova in Soob- GMII 8, 147-53; and E.M. Alexeyeva in Problemy antichnoy kultury 118-25). Two coin hoards discovered at Fadeyevo and at Kumatyr near Gorgippia raise the question of the circulation of bronze coins in the Bosporan kingdom during the last quarter of the second century B.C. (N.D. Nesterenko in VDI 1987:2, 74-84). Terracottas were produced in Gorgippia from the fourth century B.C. to the third century A.C. E.M. Alexeyeva published the molds and the major types in KSIA 191 (1987) 19-26. A late third- to second- century B.C. ceramic complex found in a pit was published by Y.V. Zuykov in KSIA 191 (1987) 70-75.

Lemyakina in KSIA 191 (1987) 67-70. Also found on the site was a first-century A.C. marble Corinthian capital (I.A. Karpushkina in KSIA 197 [1990] 79-83). A gold plaque from Gorgippia stamped with the image of Helios is now in the Her- mitage Museum (S.Y. Saprykin in VDI 1983:1, 68- 94). A rural estate with several courtyards and many rooms has been excavated approximately 15 km northeast of Gorgippia. It dates to the fourth-second century B.C. Accumulations of pottery and of frag- mentary architectural blocks in the environs suggest that there may have been many estates in the chora of Gorgippia. In contrast to the houses in the town itself, which had mudbrick walls on stone foundations, the rural estates around Gorgippia were built entirely of</page><page sequence="42">562 MICHAIL J.

A survey of the rural Taman' Peninsula was made be- tween 1981 and 1985 by the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow under the leadership of Y.M. Paromov. His findings are published in KSIA 188 (1986) 69- 76; 196 (1989) 72-78; and, with A.N. Voronov, in Arkhitekturnoye nasledstvo (=Architectural Heritage, Moscow 1990) 3-11. The history of the Phantal part of the Taman' Peninsula in the first century A.C. is discussed by V.P. Tolstikov in Arkheologiya (Kiev) 1989:1, 52-65. For the southeastern part of the Asian Bosporus see N.A. Onayko and A.V. Dmitriev in KSIA 168 (1981) 93-100 and in VDI 1982:2, 106-17; D.B. Shelov in Heinen 386-87; and Hind 91. Yubileynoe. E.A. Savostina, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, has kindly supplied the following information: Yubileynoe is located on the Taman' Peninsula in the area farthest from the Black Sea, near the Greek towns of Kepoi and Phanagoria. In the fall of 1982, deep plowing turned up a fourth-century B.C. Attic grave stele. The fragmentary marble relief, 1.5 m in height, depicts an attacking warrior wearing a short cloak and carrying a shield on his left forearm. Ex- cavations directed by E.A. Savostina began in 1983. The major structure uncovered, designated Yubiley- noe I, was a country villa of the first century B.C. to first century A.C. The villa was square in plan, with a central paved courtyard surrounded by two to three stories built of mudbrick on a stone socle. All of the stone consisted of reused blocks. The results of the excavations are published by E.A. Savostina in Sov- Arch 1987:1, 58-71* and RA 1987, 3-24; and in the catalogue Vystavka novykh postupleniy, 1981-1986 161-67. Among the finds from Yubileynoe I are two grave reliefs, reused in the construction of the villa. In 1983, three pieces of a large limestone relief were discov- ered among paving slabs leading to the villa. In 1990, a fourth fragment was uncovered beneath the villa (fig. 30). Originally at least 2.5 m high, the relief depicted an Amazonomachy, of which parts of six figures are preserved. It is certainly a Bosporan work, dating to the late fourth or early third century B.C. In 1985, another Attic marble grave stele was exca- vated; it probably dates to the third quarter of the fourth century B.C. It had been reused face down as a step; the two figures, standing warriors wearing tunics and Corinthian helmets, are carved in high relief and remain in good condition. The necropolis from which these grave stelae came has not been</page><page sequence="43">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA 563 found, nor is there yet any clue as to whose graves these unusual reliefs might have marked. They have been published by M.J. Treister in ArchNews 14 (1985) 57-61; by U. Mrogenda et al., in Boreas 11 (1988) 51- 61; by B.S. Ridgway in Hellenistic Sculpture I: The Styles of ca. 331-200 B.C. (Madison 1990) 46 and 68 n. 32; and by E.A. Savostina in RA 1987, 10, fig. 6 and in Antichnaya skulptura iz sobraniya GMII im. A.S. Pushkina (Moscow 1987) 124. In 1986 a second villa, known as Yubileynoe II, was located ca. 500 m from Yubileynoe I. The full plan of the villa is as yet unknown, but portions of the walls of subsidiary buildings have been uncovered. Savostina believes that the Yubileynoe I and II villas were constructed at the same time. They are strati- graphically homogeneous, suggesting that the areas were cleared before construction began, a practice fairly common in the Asian part of the Bosporus, and one which may also be observed at Kepoi, Hermon- assa, and Gorgippia. The reused building materials probably explain the presence of fourth- and third- century B.C. ceramics in settlements that were not established until the first century B.C. Kuchugury Necropolis. Pit and kurgan burials near the Sea of Azov, 1.2 km from the village of Kuchugury, have been the subject of study by Y.M. Desyatchikov and M.V. Kalashnikov under the aus- pices of the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow. Of particular interest are terracottas from a burial of the third or second century B.C., published by T.V. Mi- roshina and A.V. Sazanov in KSIA 197 (1990) 73-78.
