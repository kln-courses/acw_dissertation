This paper highlights how the outdoors comes to be known matters for the integrity of human and non-human bodies performing and encountered in outdoor spaces. It examines some of the ways of knowing demanded in accomplishing responsible outdoor access with dogs , in terms of constituting response-ability - or the capacity to respond - across species and geographical difference. Through mobile and visual ethnographic methods enabling episodes and repertoires of canine-human enactments to be witnessed and recounted , we identify ways of knowing the outdoors that exceed cognition of the formal scriptings of conduct , yet are crucial to preventing its transgression through engendering capacities to respond. We identify in particular the role of anticipa- tory knowledges , and argue that better account needs to be taken of the embodied preparatory and pre-emptory ways of knowing that make the mutual doings of response-ability across spatial and species difference possible. These encompass a set of temporally interleaving spatio-corporeal competencies that render the crux time-spaces of ' irresponsible ' human-nonhuman ruptures preventable rather than merely recognisable. They work by shaping and being attuned to how dog and human bodies become articulate to each other in relation to the shifting ecologies , topographies , terrains and proximities of an outdoor excursion. Consequently we raise the question of the work of responsibility done (or not) in terms of our human obligations to animals when attentions become focused on codified rather than the broader range of outdoor knowledges. Key words: anticipation , knowledges , video ethnography , outdoor access , embodiment , human-animal relations Know the Code before you go! So urges campaign materials seeking to encourage responsible outdoor practice in Scotland. The message is typically followed by a brief set of principles or rules of conduct drawn from the Scottish Outdoor Access Code (hereafter 'the Code'; SNH 2005), which stipulate 'responsible' behaviour, upon which these legal rights of access are explicitly contingent. Clearly a 'responsible' subject - and thus one meriting legal legitimacy - is held to be a 'knowing' subject. In this paper we seek to address what exactly is meant by knowing how to conduct oneself responsibly outdoors. Using the example of outdoor access with dogs, we consider the ways of knowing demanded in achieving responsible practice, in terms of precisely how people need to know. This in turn highlights how the outdoors comes to be known matters, not only for enjoyment and confidence in enacting rights of outdoor access, but also for the integrity of human and non-human bodies performing Area Vol. 44 No. 1, pp. 37-45, 2012 ISSN 0004-0894 © 201 1 The Authors.

Walking with dogs counts for one in five outdoor excur- sions (SNH 2005), so plays a key role in realising outdoor participation. However, it is subject to a range of formal and informal procedural competencies (Laurier et al. 2006) often relating to the keeping of dogs under control. Failure to do so 'can cause serious problems, including worrying of and injury to livestock, disturbance of wildlife and alarming other people' (SNH 2005, 42). From the Code and supporting leaflets we learn that sheep and deer may be mutilated and killed; lambs may be aborted; chicks of ground nesting birds may die if they become separated from their mother; dogs may be shot; and humans may be trampled as they attempt to rescue their dog from mobbing cattle. This formal advice stipulates the practice of 'proper' or 'close control' of dogs as essential for responsible practice that prevents such disruptive events. Codes have long played a central role in governing outdoor access. They are devices of self-governance designed and employed to influence conduct at a dis- tance, especially where mobile or diffuse practices are involved (Merriman 2005). They can also be seen as technologies of anticipatory governance (Massumi 2007; Anderson 2007 2010) in that they seek to shape action in the present based on possible futures, in this case, to avert harm or alarm to humans and nonhumans. Reli- ance is placed upon the ordering engendered by mundane, everyday practices and norms. Yet most studies of outdoor access have focused on the official scriptings contained within laws and Codes (Merriman 2005; Barker 2006; Mackay 2007), with little attention paid to how governance is enacted through bodily practice. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to examine how responsible outdoor access is actually accomplished (or not) in the conjoint performance of dog and human, and the ways of knowing thus demanded. Building on the work of Laurier et al. (2006) and Goode (2006) on dog- human encounters, we pose the question: What does it take to achieve responsible access with a dog? Precisely how is it made 'mutually doable'? Moreover, we consider how ways of knowing engender response-ability in outdoor access, in terms of being able to form an adequate response in choreographing cross-species encounters (Haraway 2008; Greenhough and Roe 201 1 ). The paper draws on an ethnographic study of outdoor access that enrolled discursive and visual methods to explore important geographical and more-than-linguistic dimensions of the work of 'response-ability'. It thereby elucidates ways of knowing that enable, preclude or produce coalescences and ruptures in the human-dog relational fabric referred to as 'control'. Geographies and responsibilities of human-animal encounters Configuring human-animal relations Accomplishing responsible outdoor access with dogs can be understood as a case of humans and nonhuman animals having to share space and to learn to live together across species difference. Such concerns are at the centre of recent debate on human-animal relations and their political and ethical dimensions. Geographers have made valuable contributions to these discussions, highlighting how animals are conceptually and materi- ally placed in (dis)association with particular areas (Philo and Wilbert 2000; Matless et al. 2005), and ques- tion how knowledges count in - and are generated through - spatially constituted relationships between people and animals (Wolch and Emel 1998; Lorimer 2006; Hinchliffe et al. 2005). Debate surrounds the capacity of animals to transgress, elude, undermine or even resist such spatial boundings (Philo and Wilbert 2000). Just as a dog 'out of control' is deemed to have transgressed the bounds of conduct set by various laws and Codes (Michael 2000), there is a need to take account of dogs and other animals as more than passive adherents to human orderings (Laurier et al. 2006). A critical challenge identified in the literature is how we work through, and act upon, this acknowledge- ment of human-nonhuman (co)agency, whilst acknowl- edging its asymmetry, and how it complicates our efforts to articulate and enact ethical obligations of multispecies co-flourishing (Haraway 2008). Here too, geographers have generated insights into how ethical relations between human and nonhuman animals - such as those of responsibility - might be practically accomplished (Whatmore 2006; Jones 2000; Greenhough and Roe 201 1 ; Lorimer 201 0). A key proponent informing such work is Haraway (2008), who suggests that respon- sibility in a multispecies existence is constituted through response-able practice; the ability to respond. This is understood as a set of connections and sensibilities that demand and enable response, and that are performed, nurtured and crafted in processes of intra-action 'through which entities, subjects and objects, come into being' (2008, 71). Drawing on Derrida, she explains that responding is necessarily more than reacting by way of a formulaic or fixed calculus, and is not solely achievable through reasoned reckoning or universal principles. Instead, response-ability requires the dissolution of mind- body dichotomies that lure us into seeking, framing and codifying moral legitimacy through emotionally and bodily detached ways of acting. With reference to the ethics of animal and human experimental practices, Greenhough and Roe (201 1 ) draw attention to the embodied, everyday ways of knowing that Area Vol. 44 No. 1, pp. 37^5, 2012 ISSN 0004-0894 © 201 1 The Authors.

They note that offi- cial scriptings of principles, codes and protocols designed to shape conduct valorise the human ability for language and rational communication, and hence tend to overlook the situated, contingent, corporeal and affectual practices through which ethical relations are enacted (see also Whatmore 1997; McCormack 2003). Cross-species encounters - making the mutual doings of human and dog possible Attention to the intercorporeal communications of humans and dogs in complex webs of everyday social relations has, to date, been limited. Notable exceptions include Haraway (2008), Power (2008), Goode (2006), Fox (2006), Laurier et al. (2006) and Michael (2000), who have examined canine-human relations as constituted through situated practices such as walking, playing and home-making. Haraway uses the notion of the 'contact zone' to foreground 'the fleshy historical reality of face- to-face, body-to-body subject making across species' (2008, 66), where dogs and humans come together in mutually transformative ways, though 'often within radi- cally asymmetrical relations of power' (2008, 216). The coherence and unity of the dog-human partnership is, therefore, a fluid, provisional and relational achievement, which can be interposed by problems and dilemmas of interpretation and communication. Interrogating the spaces of dog-human encounters in a public park, Laurier et al. (2006) make visible some of the practical efforts and procedural competencies involved in achieving the conduct-with across asymmetrical bodily and conceptual possibilities. Regarding dogs - as well as people - as knowledgeable and skilful subjects, they show how people and dogs evaluate and respond to each other's actions, including their pace, gestures, comport- ments and bodily orientations. Walking with a dog is considered a mutual doing in which 'participants never- theless bring different things to one another's attention and expect that different things will engage the other's attention' (Laurier et al. 2006, 20; see also Goode 2006). Enrolling video methods The challenges of researching human-dog encounters include their highly (and at times unpredictably) mobile (Lorimer 2010) and mundane, taken-for-granted (Michael 2000) nature, as well as the central ity of more-than-verbal communication (Grandin 2006; Despret 2004). As Laurier et al. (2006) and Goode (2006) have shown, talk alone is insufficient for understanding the conduct and conjoined doings of people and dogs. In order to overcome this we employed a mobile video ethnography with dogwalkers. This entailed them filming their everyday practices of dogwalking 'on-the-move' using 'headcam' video, and the researcher and the participant viewing and discussing the footage together afterwards. We also made a film (CLOAF and MLURI 2010) in collaboration with the Local Outdoor Access Forum, involving dogwalkers, land managers, rangers, access officers and dog training professionals. Here audio-visual materials were gene- rated through predominantly handheld video recordings of interviews, group discussions and the walking and training of dogs. Using video helped us to witness human-animal entanglements in the becoming (Lorimer 201 0). The hand- held recordings in particular enabled an account of their interbodily comportments, motions, gestures, timings, responses, glances, enrolment of objects, as well as vocal expressions. This complemented the headcam video technology, which granted camera admission into the intimate, journeying and sometimes-momentary time- spaces of dogwalking practices without precluding their unfolding. In focusing on grounded episodes of situated interac- tion, embracing their gestural, temporal and procedural complexity and contingency, it is possible to explicate 'the orderliness of conduct' as and where it happens (Laurier et al. 2006, 7), as well as make apparent what might otherwise be missed if relying solely on accounts of what people say they do (Laurier and Philo 2006). Yet we still found an important role for talk in appreciating the various ways in which human subjects made sense of their relations, practices and encounters with animals. Like Philo and Laurier (2006), we consider talk an embodied practice, and one through which normative practices can be explored in relation to the visual material. Further- more, headcam footage in particular can be hard to inter- pret on its own (Haraway 2008, 258). It is thus especially valuable to mobilise these images in ways that can evoke participants' memories and feelings of their dogwalk- ing experiences so as to interweave further layers of sense-making. Enacting 'response-able' dogwalking Ordering the conduct of dogs and humans The 'Walkies' leaflet designed to abstract the main mes- sages of the Code for dogwalkers emphasises the need for dogs to be under control for achieving responsible access. It states that: the Code defines 'under close control' to mean that your dog responds to your commands and is kept close at heel. If he can lie down or return to you on command, your dog Area Vol. 44 No. 1, pp. 37-45, 2012 ISSN 0004-0894 © 201 1 The Authors.

If you're not sure that your dog can do this the responsible thing is to keep him on a short lead. (SN H 2008, np) Dogs that are 'out of control' transgress boundaries and spatial orderings of conduct devised by humans. One land manager explained: 1 think there are a lot of responsible dog-owners out there, but we see plenty of times when they are not responsible and the dogs are running away and doing their own thing ' (SNH 2008, np; emphasis added). Likewise, dogwalkers in the study conveyed to us numerous instances in which the coher- ence of the human-dog partnership had ruptured and opened the possibility for 'irresponsible' happenings to ensue. They often talked candidly about (occasional) past bad experiences and near-misses of their dogs chasing livestock or wildlife, or frightening or annoying people. To explore the performative constitution of such absence of control, we will begin with the story of Bobby and his owner. Bobby's human was familiar with the Code. She knew very well that dogs ought not worry sheep, and the pos- sibility abhorred her. It was therefore with a palpable sense of distress and remorse that she recounted an inci- dent where the 'normally obedient' Bobby put sheep at risk: going up a brae ... he was ahead of me and before I realised it he was up over the top. And I didn't realise, there were no fences, no field . . . but there were sheep out there. And he was up there chasing the sheep. Well he stopped immediately when I called him, and came right back, but I hadn't realised . . . that there were going to be sheep out in the open up there, so, really I should have had him more under control and shouldn't have let him go over the top. This dogwalker was by no means alone in such an expe- rience, which illustrated that people can know the Code in an intellectual sense, and can readily recognise disrup- tive events when they happen; yet this does not in itself equip them with the embodied, reciprocal human-dog coherence, or the spatio-corporeal competencies, sensi- bilities and attunements necessary to prevent transgres- sions. An access manager explained the problem in relation to crux moments of harm or alarm in which outdoor access practices become legally legible as 'irre- sponsible': 'the trouble is that a person can be responsible until the moment they're not ... a dog is under control until it's not'. Recognition of, or response to, the disrup- tive, 'irresponsible' event itself was not considered adequate because it could be too late to avert harm or damage. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that such conspicu- ous episodes of rupture in human-dog coherence emerge relational ly from complex threadings of past, present and future bodily intra-actions and spatial practices, despite not always being fully appreciated or acted upon by par- ticipants. For example, continuities could be traced between a given moment of outdoor practice, puppy training in the kitchen (often years before), attentions to topography and terrain (immediately preceding moments further up the trail), which suggests that the capacity to respond of human and dog - and thus the location of agency in achieving responsibility - is constituted through cascades of events in overlapping (indoor and outdoor) spaces. Indeed it was emphasised by one access officer that 'it's a case of anticipating problems' rather than solving them. This suggests that being 'response-able' in access with dogs entails the ability to form an adequate response to the possibilities and precursory configurations of disrup- tive events as much as the events themselves. We there- fore argue that such response-ability retíes heavily on anticipatory ways of knowing (Anderson 2007 2010) - or more accurately perhaps, anticipatory ways of knowing- with - that weave dog and human practice together as they relate to various continuities and sequences of spatio-temporal convergence of more-than-human bodies, movements, terrains and vegetation. Moreover, these encompass, in the words of Massumi, 'actuatable know-how rather than a reflective and empirical knowing- thať (200 7, 219) in that they mobilise affective as well as cognitive ways of knowing. The dogwalking partnerships in the study illustrated two key senses in which anticipa- tory knowledges engender a capacity to respond. These ways of knowing relate to forms of: • preparation: enskilling for building human-nonhuman coherence • pre-emption: interbodily attunement for achieving and maintaining human-nonhuman coherence on-the- move. Knowing-before-you-go : mutual enskilling and attunement of dog and human Perhaps as important as knowing the Code 'before you go' is dog and human coming to know and make sense of each other; to be competent-together. As one Local Outdoor Access Forum member asserted, achieving responsibility was, in part, 'a question of the dog getting trained in the first place'; although with dogwalking gen- erally, the 'control' of dogs is a fluid, relational accom- plishment, in a continual state of becoming, and thus always open to rupture. Nevertheless, participants dem- onstrated and described a kind of preparatory knowing in which expectations of coherence between person and dog were stabilised as they learned to attend, attune and Area Vol. 44 No. 1, pp. 37-45, 2012 ISSN 0004-0894 © 201 1 The Authors.

In part, a stabilisation of responses to commands such as to 'sit', 'wait' or 'come' (Platel) entailed nurturing forms of interest in and availability to each other, which acted as the invisible threads of bodily co-positioning and lines of more-than-verbal interspecies communication vital for adequate response. For example, in demonstrat- ing the 'recall' command (Plate 1) needed to enact 'close control', the dog trainer explained how she and her dog had built up and stabilised through countless repetitions - in progressively more distracting spaces - a sequence of mutual articulations of movements, sounds, gestures, proximities, tactil ¡ties, eye contact and comportments that cultivated mutual meaning, attunement and the expecta- tion of further invitations to respond. The key was allow- ing the dog to associate the particular verbal and gestural expressions of the human (the holding up of palm with a 'wait!' sound, or opened arms with a 'come!' sound), not only with its own actions (sitting, watching, running) and inactions (waiting), but with the experience of being rewarded (in this case with praise, a pat and a morsel of food). Similarly, Karen explained that the regular visual or bodily check-backs performed by her dog during the walk (Plate 2) were a result of her regularly hiding from him when he was a puppy whilst out on walks, in order to cultivate his interest in her and articulate their bodies spatially to each other. Sometimes from this looking back the dog appeared to judge that the distance between him and the human had become too far and either waited or retraced his steps until within range of being able to keep a better eye on the actions of his human. Likewise, there were times when Karen was not satisfied with their visual contact and would call him back into what she consid- ered an acceptable vicinity. Interestingly, however, the role of such processes of enskilling and bodily co-articulation in achieving 'respon- sible' outdoor access were not always fully recognised by dogwalkers. There was little sense in which they felt 'irresponsible' when not possessing such preparatory response-abilities. It was also striking how the agency of dogs was selec- tively mobilised in outdoor practice. In many cases, dogs were ascribed only limited recognition in, and potential for, achieving 'responsible' access. Indeed, dogs were more often ascribed agency-as-culpability in 'irrespon- sible' practice. For example, recounting a near-miss inci- dent with livestock, Barney's human positions him as a 'bad dog': I didn't realise there were sheep there [pauses], so I called him, and I really shouted at him 'bad dog!', you know, and fortunately he stopped in his tracks, and he did come back. Denoting the dog as 'bad' here disavows somewhat the mutual constitution of conduct in such time-spaces of rupture, and works to absolve human culpability in the near-'irresponsible' event. Similarly, we detect a tendency to refer to interspecies coherence-building as 'dog- Area Vol. 44 No. 1, pp. 37-45, 2012 ISSN 0004-0894 © 201 1 The Authors.

Yet if training is understood as a co-shaping of human and dog, it can be argued that, changing (in order) to be prepared - in terms of developing anticipatory com- petency for outdoor access response - requires both parties being prepared to change. Any underestimation of dogs' potentiality as (co)skilled and knowledgeable (and therefore response-able) subjects, or disavowal of human agency in shaping the partnership's capacity to respond and communicate across asymmetrical difference, is consequential. Knowing-as-you-go - corporeal and proximal spatialities of human-dog attunement Crucially, person and dog had to be able to enact such sensibilities and skills as they were co-constituted with particular outdoors on-the-move. Being response-able meant dog and human maintaining interest in each other despite the distractions and demands of shifting terrains, with their new textures, sights and smells. Human failure to appreciate how a dog makes sense of the world and what the dog attends to on a walk was a key way in which coherence could be thwarted. The dog-trainer underlined to her class that 'a dog doesn't go out for a walk . . . when you take your dog for a walk, you are effectively simulat- ing a pack hunť. Later discussion amongst class participants showed that she had succeeded in unsettling some of their more anthropomorphic assumptions. However, in leaning on the now substantially critiqued 'lupomorph' model of dog behaviour - in which explanations of dog behaviour are inferred from (now scientifically discredited) under- standings of wolf ancestry and wolf-pack dynamics (Bradshaw 2011) - she risks obfuscating the situated, intersubjective and reciprocal ways in which dogs and humans come to know each other and their environ- ments. As Fox states, 'such readings tend to essential ize animal actions into supposed "biological" behaviour, such as the "pack instinct" in dogs, and ignore animal agency and individual interaction in the relationship' (2006, 529). Land managers echoed such conceptions when they asserted the importance of apprehending predator-prey socialities of the chase that they held to configure a dog's sensibilities and yearnings of outdoor practice. Nevertheless, one of the insights the dog trainer hoped to convey to the class was a fuller appreciation of the dog's sensory hierarchies and how they tend to differ to humans. She emphasised the olfactory extravaganza on offer to the dog, and the possible desire of the dog to pick up and follow a 'scent' that could lead to wildlife or livestock. Attunement to the bodily comportment of the dog was considered vital in signalling possible imminent rupture of 'control'. As one dogwalker said: 'you can tell. They've got that body language when they've got the scent. And as soon as he's got the scent he's straight back to me'. Coherence also seemed to hinge on an attunement to spatio-corporeal practices that facilitate or hamper the articulations of human and dog. Partnerships seemed to have a proximal ly constituted bond, referred to by the trainer as 'distance': 'that point before you lose control . . . , that's your distance'.

Timing was, therefore, of the essence since human agency only existed pre-emptively before this 'distance' was transgressed. Many dogwalkers spoke of disruptive events before which the dog has gone 'that little bit further' than the point of availability to their human: he was away for an hour and a half once chasing pheas- ants. This particular time he just went that little bit further than I'd realised he'd gone, and an hour and a half later I was still standing there like an idiot shouting. Recall too the episode of Bobby, whose human con- ceded she had let him go 'too far on his own'. It was the loss of visual contact as Bobby went over the rise of the hill, or rather the failure to pre-empt and account for its possibility, that undermined interspecies availability and the capacity for response. Sightlines and indeed 'sound- lines' could also be 'lost' in relation to blind corners, forest vegetation and wet or windy weather. One par- ticipant explained watching headcam footage of their outing that they were keeping their dog close to them because 'the wind was against' them. Haraway warns us that, yes, 'the human decides for the dog what the acceptable criteria of performance will be' but [t] he human must respond to the authority of the dog's actual performance. The dog has already responded to the human's incoherence . . . the invitation to response has been tendered. (2008, 221) Thus Bobby did not actually 'disobey' his owner, he merely responded to the invitations and articulations made available to him. This underscores that response- able ways of knowing encompass a pre-emptive attentive- ness to how different environmental entanglements (dis)enable the body-to-body articulation of dog and human, as well as the ability to enact a timely response in relation to spatio-corporeal orientations, gestures and proximities. Anticipating how and where rupture could transpire was fundamental, after which there was always the option of enrolling the leash into the dog-human assemblage to alter the distribution of (co)agency (Michael 2000). Conclusion: Ways of knowing the outdoors for response-able practice We began by raising the issue of precisely how the responsible subject ought to be a knowing subject (Whatmore 2006), especially since the enactment of legal entitlement - such as rights of outdoor access - can hinge on such knowledgeability. Our findings suggest that ways of knowing the outdoors that make response-able mutual doings of human-nonhuman com- posites possible (or otherwise) can elude and exceed official scriptings of outdoor access conduct in signifi- cant ways. Locating the crux moments of harm or alarm in which outdoor access practices become legally legible as 'irresponsible', such as a dog worrying sheep, was relatively straightforward for dogwalkers and land managers alike. What was not fully appreciated or acted upon was that such conspicuous episodes of rupture in human-nonhuman coherence - as well as spaces of possibility for pre-emptive response - emerge relation- ally from complex threadings of past, present and future bodily intra-actions and spatial practices. This suggests that inhering in practices such as outdoor access, response-ability, in terms of forming an adequate response, is the need to act 'in the present on the basis of the future' (Anderson 2010, 778), which in turn relies heavily on anticipatory ways of knowing-with. Tracing dogwalking practices through crux time-spaces of canine-human coalescence and rupture allowed us to identify hitherto underappreciated material-semiotic requirements of accomplishing response-able outdoor access. A range of spatio-corporeal attunements and more-than-verbal communicational exchanges are shown to be vital anticipatory competencies in constituting an adequate capacity to respond, in that they enable the skilled choreography of dog and human bodies as they (actually and nearly) become interwoven with the bodies and traces of other animals, such as sheep, deer and ground-nesting birds, in the varying ecologies and topog- raphies of the outdoor excursion. The need to attend to how the countryside comes to be known in sensuous and embodied ways (Carolan 2008) is thus underlined, with knowing through animal bodies as well as (or, indeed, in conjunction with) human bodies being thrown into par- ticularly sharp relief. The dogwalking partnerships in the study illustrated two key senses in which anticipatory knowledges engender a capacity to respond, relating to preparation and pre- emption. Firstly, person and dog can become aware of, and develop, their material-semiotic coherence through prior training-together so as to build socio-spatial exper- tise in conjoint conduct (after Haraway 2008; Laurier et al. 2006), and, moreover, recognition of how such pre- paratory time-spaces engendered readiness for perform- ing particular outdoor spaces. Secondly, person and dog had to be able to enact such sensibilities and skills as they were dynamically co-constituted with particular outdoor spaces.

We have illustrated not only the limited ability of formal principles and procedures to adequately capture a responsible ethical response, but also explored the consequent implications and obligations. Both human and nonhuman animals demonstrated culpability in undermining coherence, and, in turn, the ability to respond. Nevertheless, here we must recall the asymme- try of agency of human-animal relations flagged in debate, and that in outdoor access, as elsewhere, dogs are working under circumstances not of their own design (Haraway 2008), and so consider the obligations humans have 'to be good walkers with dogs' (Laurier et al. 2006, 22) and, moreover, how they might be ful- filled. Is it really a 'bad dog' when its human has allowed it to breach its invisible thread of nonverbal communication, or 'disappear' round a corner? Or is it a 'bad human' that fails to intervene before a dog exceeds such lines of sight and distance? Our study suggests that responsible practice is not only a case of enabling animals to be articulate, but for humans to cultivate ways of co-knowing (in this case knowing-each-other-in- the-outdoors) that enable response in a timely and geographically-attuned manner to such articulations. Are humans disavowing their part in the work of accom- plishing responsible practice if they focus on knowing the contents of the Code yet neglect their agency in cul- tivating anticipatory and spatio-corporeally situated ways of knowing required to enact their rudiments?
