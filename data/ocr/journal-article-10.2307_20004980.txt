<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kai Neilsen. Contemporary Critiques of Religion. Pp. I63. (Macmillan, I971 in the series 'Philosophy of Religion' edited by John Hick.) This book is novel in its form i.e. in that it sets out to state and assess con temporary critiques of the Christian religion, as opposed to directly offering a critique of the Christian religion itself. The assessment of Contemporary Empiricist Critiques as paradigmatically represented by the work of Ayer and Flew however turns out to be not solely an assessment, but a spirited (and well argued) defence, right down to the very last ditch. The attackers of such a contemporary empiricist position such as Mascall (Chapter 3, Section II ff.), Plantinga and Alston (Chapter 4, Sections I and II), Hick (ibid., Section III) and Sellars (ibid., Section IV) are all subjected to rigorous and acute examination and all fail the test of answering Flew's challenge or successfully by-passing it. In summing up at the end of Chapter 4 Nielsen writes: 'To sum up the thrust of this chapter, I have tried to show that what has been dubbed Flew's challenge is a genuine challenge indeed and that it has not been met or successfully by-passed. Core religious utterances purport</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 273 to be truth-claims, yet they fail to make intelligible truth-claims. The critiques of religion coming out of the empiricist tradition have given us good grounds for believing that the key claims of anthropomorphic God-talk are false and that non-anthropomorphic God-talk-the talk of the dominant tradition of Judaism and Christianity-is so incoherent that no intelligible truth-claim is actually made by these putative truth-claims'. Chapter 5, entitled 'The Challenge of Conceptual Relativism', is crucial since 'Conceptual Relati vists' like Phillips, Holland, and Malcolm, do not try to answer Flew or Ayer (like Crombie or Hick), or try to point out (like e.g. Mascall or to a greater and more thorough extent, Plantinga) supposed deficiencies in the empiri cist tradition or supposed inadequacies in the criterion of 'factual significance' or 'factual meaning' for an utterance, but claim that the claim that there is a challenge to be answered is thoroughly misguided and represents a gross misunderstanding. It is so thoroughly misguided and represents a gross mis understanding since such a claim takes the concept of reality, and of ration ality and intelligibility embodied in scientific discourse and common sense discourse derived from such discourse and applies them to a universe of discourse (religious discourse) in which they can have no intelligible appli cation. No wonder Flew's challenge can never be met- he will necessarily win at his own game when his potential opponents cannot even be properly regarded as competitors! Nielson however argues that far from it being the case that commitment to 'Conceptual Relativism' leaves Christianity un scathed, if taken to its logical conclusion it offers a far more fundamental form of criticism than the empiricist critiques; for commitment to conceptual relativism entails saying that Christian-talk is but one language game among a myriad of language games and thus Christian-talk can have no legitimate claim to a superior reality or deeper truth or profounder insight than any other language game. It is in no better position, and cannot meaningfully be said to be in any better position than-'Zande witchcraft-talk, Haitian voodoo-talk, Dubuan talk of sacred yams, Apa Tani talk of the Land of the Dead and the like' (pp. I04-5). On a conceptual relativist position, how can one make sense of the point made in Christian talk that Christ is the way, the truth, and the life? Nielsen hammers this point home and in my view he is right to do so. He does attempt to produce some counter argument on the part of the conceptual relativist (cf. pp. I07-8)-viz. that 'Christ is the truth and the way' is a religious utterance, made within a particular language game for distinctive religious purposes making no world-historical claim but comments (rightly in my view) that in saying 'Christ is the truth', 'the agent thinks he is making a statement which not only holds for him and for people in his tribe, but for all men as well, regardless of their condition. It is the key, so he believes, to their salvation' (p. io8). I contend that Neilsen himself offers an important challenge to the conceptual relativist-namely, how does one cope, on such a position, with 'Christ is the way, the truth, the life?'</page><page sequence="3">274 REVIEWS Nielsen is in some difficulty however, and his writings makes it clear that he appreciates that he is in some difficulty when he goes on to make the claim that to say the Christ is the Truth is irrational on a conceptual relativist thesis (pp. IO9-IO). Nevertheless in spite of a weak passage (top of p. I Io) he does make some case out-but some more argument and a consideration of potential objections from the conceptual relativist would have helped here. I have discussed Chapter 5 at some length since I think that is it this chapter which will provoke the most interest. Chapter 6 deals with certain specific problems, as opposed to general problems, raised by particular Empiricist critiques-for example such problems as whether God is able to be identifyingly referred to under the Christian concept of 'God'; whether any sense can be given to the notion of an agent without a body in the sense of a living organism; whether the concept of 'God' can possibly be said to have application. Such problems come under the heading of whether the concept of 'God' in the Judaeo-Christian tradi tion is a coherent one. Nielsen comes to the conclusion that we have good grounds for thinking that the Judaeo-Christian concept of God is an in coherent concept and that 'we are no more able to "conceptually identify" God than we are able to empirically or experimentally identify him' (p. I 34). I have not the space to comment on Nielsen's arguments in this chapter-but instead of being entitled 'On Dining with the Theologian', it should have been entitled 'On making mincemeat of certain Philosopher/Theologians' (if I may be allowed to be unserious for a moment), for there is no common food partaken and no theologians as such discussed. This book is clearly written and presents a challenge. I find Nielsen's criticism of Plantinga (Chapter 4) particularly acute and biting; by contrast I find the discussion of Mascall on the question of mystical experience some what unfair and over dramatised. In my view several questions are begged here: I do not understand what is meant by a 'pure description' of mystical experience (cf. pp. 50-4). As a final comment, I think this book would have been improved by the insertion of a more detailed discussion of the Con ceptual Relativist position even at the risk of reproducing arguments produced elsewhere: I am left with the firm impression that the Conceptual Relativists do not get anything like as good a run for their money as Ayer and Flew do, even though I agree with Nielsen that the Verification Principle has been too much maligned and that Ayer's position needs to be fairly presented, as it indeed is here.
