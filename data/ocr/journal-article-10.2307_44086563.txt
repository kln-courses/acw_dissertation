<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sarah E. McFarland Exploring "at the Edge of Things": A Conversation with Susan Zwinger A writer, naturalist, artist, and teacher, Susan Zwinger is the author of several volumes of environmental literature, including The Hanford Reach (2004), The Last Wild Edge (1999), Still Wild, , Always Wild (1994) and Stalking the Ice Dragon (1991), and is the co-author of Women in Wilderness (1997) with her mother, Ann Zwinger. Zwinger's essays and poems have appeared in a number of journals and anthologies, including Poetry , American Nature Writing , The Seattle Weekly , and The North American Review. She received the Washington State Governor's award for her environmental writing. Zwinger currently lives on an island in Puget Sound and teaches in the Whidbey Island Writers' Master of Fine Arts program in creative nonfiction. The following conversation took place in July 2005 in Portland, Oregon. Sarah McFarland: In The Last Wild Edge , you say that you don't want to write another book about the sexy megafauna at the top of the food chain, that you want to turn your eyes toward the smaller, less-appreci- ated wildlife around you instead. What initiated that decision? What were you hoping to accomplish? Susan Zwinger: It comes from two different places. The funny place it comes from is my work with the Sierra Club's Ancient Forest Committee. We got so tired of the NSO words, the "northern spotted owl"- because so many people said, "You're protecting the forest just for a stupid owl." Everything was owl, owl, owl, bear, bear, bear, wolf, wolf, wolf. In the meantime, the specials on TV were lions, tigers, Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 14.1 (Summer 2007) Copyright Â© 2007 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">162 ISLE bears. I didn't want to add to that abundance of stuff about such a small number of animals. The second place is that I think we need an attentiveness toward nature- attentiveness toward life and toward everything around us. It takes noticing the small creatures; they really run the universe. The masses of lichen in the trees and the forest- they're just huge! It's equal to all the other bushes and plants put together, but we don't see those little beings that make up our lives or make such a big difference. That's why I really celebrate the little beings and the little subtle noticings- because everything else in our culture is fighting against that. It's so big and flashy! [Laughs.] I think it is in our attentiveness to the little things that we can change how we approach the world. McFarland: You let your reader celebrate those subtle things, too, when you integrate different sensory processes into your writing. Your writing is so dependent on all of your senses, not just visual ones, that it really lets a reader experience what you describe and opens up a world to people that they may not be able to experience firsthand. Zwinger: It's interesting: we're getting into my teaching of writing now. That is my very, very first exercise in creative nonfiction classes. I give students a list of 57 senses. There are tons of senses, not just the main five: sense of balance, sense of direction, sense of light and dark- ness, small senses, Jacobson's organ [detects pheromones and airborne chemicals], your sense of space around you, and so on. When you're walking through the dark at night with a hill on one side and a lake on the other, you really do use echolocation, for example, and sense the differences in the landscapes to either side. I find what drives me crazy about some authors' writing is when I'm not given the sensual experience of where they are. The text just reads, "This is really beautiful and I'm just awestruck and sitting on this cliff, I have all these thoughts, thought, thought, thought, thought, thought." And as a reader, that's torture. So, yeah, I'm very, very aware of using all the senses. And I do that very purposefully and, of course, that comes from being a poet. In poetry, you can't get across your ideas by saying them directly. You can't say, "Nature is really important. You should love nature." You can't ever do that or else you're a really bad poet. [Laughs.] With sensory descriptions, somebody in New York City can be there on the tundra with me, and as I smell it and see it and squish around in it, they can too. McFarland: In Stalking the Ice Dragon , you describe seeing dots on the mountainside and readers discover over the course of the passage that the dots are sheep and that they are behaving strangely because a bear is there, too. As a reader, it is so wonderful to be carried along through that discovery because we- readers- don't know quite what's going</page><page sequence="3">Exploring "at the Edge of Things" 163 on at first. And then when you step into animal bodies and imagine being the sheep and then imagine being the bear crushing the sheep's skull- the hunger, and all of that- it's a perspective change again. Zwinger: I do try to speak from within the biology of the animal, without being cute or anthropomorphic about it, but to really study the animals and then speak within their consciousness. And partially I do it when I've begun to bore myself with statistics, you know. "Bears disappeared from California in 1935, and New Mexico in 1948, and blah, blah, blah," and all of a sudden I get bored with my own writing. And so a good trick to do is to step back and get into the bear's conscious- ness and try to imagine the way he is perceiving the world. When you write about an experience, it's much more fun to let the reader go along with your own consciousness, as you discover it, rather than say "XYZ happened." You'll notice in fiction that authors let the main character slowly experience the action: "What is that noise in the night? Is it the mass murderer come to strangle me, or just the wind?" [Laughs.] That slow build-up of thrill, rather than to say, "Oh, well, there's 12 sheep on the hill, and then there's a bear behind them." That wouldn't have been wonderful for you as a reader, and it wouldn't have been a per- spective change at all. McFarland: Is that why you decided to use the non-fiction essay as a forum for your environmental message? Zwinger: I think we really have a hunger for storytelling that's real, like John McPhee and Barry Lopez and men and women who talk about things that are very real and so wonderful you couldn't pos- sibly make them up. And I've just fallen in love with the essay form. It's really challenging because you have to be creative and lyrical and use all the literary skills a poet and a fiction writer use with plotting and narration, but you get to talk about real things. Reality is just so amazing, [laughs] especially if you're writing about nature. It kind of writes itself. McFarland: In your books, nature is an artist too; you appreciate your surroundings in that way. Zwinger: Yeah. That's well-put. You know, when I moved up to Washington, the first thing I did was join the Sierra Club and then the second thing was to get involved with the Ancient Forest Committee. I learned so much about forest ecology so fast, and I wrote a lot through those projects, sometimes for the newspapers. So I learned a lot about environmental reporting, which I don't do much any more because, no sooner do you put your fingers on the keyboard then the facts have changed. [Laughs.] And I guess, through that, I got into books, but I never planned to write a book. That first book on Alaska, for instance: I just kept big journals when I was there, three or four big journals,</page><page sequence="4">164 ISLE and I came back down and spent that winter typing them up. I'd work one day when I'd type up eight or nine pages, which would turn into 20, and I'd add research from the library. And, at the end of a couple seasons, I had a stack of papers that looked like a book. [Laughs.] So I went through and rewrote it a couple times and, lo and behold, there it was! It was almost an accident that I wrote that book. McFarland: I'm curious about that first book's title, in fact: Stalking the Ice Dragon. Had you imagined that trip to Alaska as "stalking" an ad- venture? What was your purpose and what were you seeking there? Zwinger: Well, I'd just come out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and I knew I needed to do some grieving for what seemed lost. I've always wanted to go to Africa or Alaska so, when I got up to Seattle, I thought, well, I'll just do both. I'll visit Alaska this summer and then I'll im- mediately turn around and visit Africa. It just didn't dawn on me how much money, time, energy, and research goes into each trip. I couldn't even get to Alaska the first summer, but I researched it for the whole first year, in '87, and then, by the summer of '88, 1 knew I needed a great big trip, not your little two-week jaunt because I can do those with my eyes closed and transformation doesn't happen. That's it: I wanted a transformation. McFarland: And you got one. . .. Zwinger: It was the best thing I ever did, I think, in my life- besides some of the childhood outdoor stuff- but it was just wonderful. For the first four days, I was lonely: lonely for my friends, lonely for Santa Fe, lonely for my boyfriend, lonely for my arts connections, lonely for everything, and- all of a sudden- I was nobody, nothing, nobody knew me, nobody cared about me. Nature doesn't care. You're just a little blip. I realized, "One could die up here." But after the first four days of being a little bit lonely, I just went around with this big shit-kicking grin on my face going, "This is so cool. Oh, wow, look at this tundra, look at all these mushrooms." [Laughs.] And it was just so pretty. The sad part never happened. I kept on think- ing, well, when does the grieving happen, you know, shouldn't I grieve? And I think I was grieving, but very joyfully. I was replacing the things that I'd thought I would miss or I was kind of addicted to- just all the stuff down there- and I just changed, totally shifted into nature. McFarland: What do you want readers to do or think or believe when they put down your books? Are you hoping to spark some sort of transformation in your readers? Zwinger: Well, I don't think I can do that directly. I'd rather spark their need to go out and journey on their own and have their own transformation. I'm not quite sure my books themselves can be trans- formative so much as fuel the desire to go out there and to explore.</page><page sequence="5">Exploring "at the Edge of Things" 165 From my years of teaching, I think you just have to help people go out and experience nature and then, all of a sudden, they have the transformative experience on their own. And, hopefully, it won't be the same as yours. But I don't have any intention. When I'm writing, I'm writing for myself, and when I do environmental writing, of course, I'm trying to get that across: to save the ancient forest and to care about that in a very direct way. I'm writing for myself in my journals and then, later, when I transcribe it, I'm still not really thinking of an audience, I'm not thinking of the reader at all. I'm very selfish. But, by then, I'm asking, "How can I make this communicative?" You know, how can I explain solifluction or glaciology so that a regular person can get really excited about it? But I don't really have an agenda in mind. People who are trying to change your values directly- I get kind of bored with them sometimes. [Laughs.] McFarland: Do you think it's been hard to share a genre with your mother, who is also a popular writer? Zwinger: Mostly no, because I was a writer before she was writing, so my identity as a writer is actually older than hers. I was backpack- ing in college and we'd come through town and she'd go, "Whoa, that looks like fun," but she was still at home with two younger ones. So in a sense, I actually influenced her in wanting to go out. So sometimes it gets frustrating, especially when people introduce me as Ann Zwinger, or they keep on thinking I am, or they credit her with my books. [Laughs.] We both write about the extremes- "the biologically chal- lenged," as someone once called it. Mom and I like the extremes. She likes the desert. I love the desert, too- how could something survive in the desert? Or how do you survive up in the tundra, which is actually a very dry landscape? And at the edge of things. So sometimes people get us mixed up, but that's not really a problem. McFarland: Who are your favorite influences, and what do you think is most important about what they do? Zwinger: Lots and lots and lots of influences. Starting with Kazant- zakis and his description of Zorba the Greek. But then I was really into T.S. Eliot and the dark side- I really liked going to the dark side as a teenager. And later, of course, Richard Hugo was my teacher, and he really influenced me. But right before that, I had discovered Theodore Roethke and loved his view of gardening and the roots and the green- houses and the earth. And I guess I sensed a deepness, and then also that joy with nature. An "In the dark time, the eye begins to see" kind of thing [Roethke]. And so that really influenced me in kind of getting out of my own dark places- or at least understanding them and having somebody else describe them so beautifully.</page><page sequence="6">166 ISLE Gary Snyder really changed my life- all of our lives in '68 or '69, when his first books were coming out. That first book, wow, that was just so mind-boggling. "Riprap" is just so there; it's so simple and so real and tangible- especially after I'd been reading T.S. Eliot! Looking up all the references, being an English major with two sets of notes for The Wasteland and doing all the footnotes- and then here comes Gary Snyder, and it's just like Roto-Rooter for the soul or something. He's talking about what I know about, which is the out-of-doors. Just climbing the mountain, building the fire, doing trail work, which I've done, and sticking your head in the creek, which I've done, and see- ing trout, which I've done. It's- whoa, you mean you can write poetry about that? And then later on, Barry Lopez and Arctic Dreams just took me and shook me upside down. But I've been an artist since I was young, and I've always conceived of myself as an artist and a writer. And I loved all the outdoor stuff. When I was still a little kid, Mom would take me walking along the beach in Florida, and I can remember her reading me The Edge of the Sea and The Sea Around Us [by Rachel Carson] and it was so magic. We had so much attachment to the ocean. And then my two sisters came and we moved to Arkansas and I felt kind of out of it, so I spent as much time as I could in the woods. I spent lots of time in the little scrubby hardwood forest in Arkansas. Then we moved to Colorado Springs; that was wonderful because we started going up in the mountains a lot. I was a Girl Scout; out there in Colorado back then, you'd go back- packing and you'd walk 20 miles into the woods and primitive camp. I got a lot of really good outdoor skills and knowledge from that. They took me up Pike's Peak when I was 15, for instance, and that was just a peak experience. [Laughs.] And so I was very much involved in nature, ever since I can remember, and I've been poet ever since I could hold a pen. [Laughs.] McFarland: Do you want to say more about what happened up there? Zwinger: Well, I was lucky because I lived in Colorado already and we went up in the mountains a lot, to our mountain land near Deckers, Colorado, but a lot of the other kids were from the flatland. They would come in for Girl Scout camp and I can remember helping other kids up the mountain because they were so sick- they weren't used to altitude at all- whereas I lived at the foot of Pike's Peak, so it seemed a normal thing to me. But I guess that year, we primitive camped, which meant our group went way out in the woods and we built everything. We lived in these little pup tents. Then we built a huge table where all of us could sit, showers that you could pull [from a sprinkler can overhead], a log table, and a whole kitchen- all with lashing, no nails or anything, so</page><page sequence="7">Exploring "at the Edge of Things" 167 we could take it down at the end of the summer. And that was incred- ible, being out there in a totally primitive way like that. I found it pretty easy to live in the woods for a month, totally primi- tive, until a friend of mine put a knife through my hand. And then I realized, gosh, we really are far out. [Laughs.] I had to walk a number of miles holding my hand up high, and then they had to take me to a jeep and then by car to a hospital some 40 miles away. I remember that sense of knowing- really knowing- that we really are way out there. And to know that my body, my 15-year-old body, could do that and do it well. [Laughs.] That was pretty exciting. McFarland: Did that primitive living experience influence your decision to travel into Alaska and live in the back of a small pickup truck? Zwinger: I had never made that connection, but I think you're ab- solutely right. I love backpacking because when you really consolidate down to, you know, just 48 pounds, then you learn what life can be minimally, how to live very simply. You learn to live with just, you know, your mess kit and a couple of big pots on the fire. You learn that, when you take a shower, you've got to heat up the water and put it in a big sprinkler can. That's all the water you get, so you'd better wash your hair fast.... That definitely translates, because that was a very small pickup- that's a very small space in the back! [Laughs.] Everything that goes in the pickup has to work, and it has to fit together. Things have to go in the right place, so that I can wake up in the middle of the night and go "keys, flashlight, Kleenex, cooler." [Laughs.] I never thought of it but, yeah, that primitive camping really enabled me to do truck trips- I knew I could do it, that I could manage without comfy hotel rooms and hot restaurant food. Besides, it was so much fun to go around Alaska slowly. If I hadn't been living out of the truck, I would have been stuck in the city every night and missed my favorite parts of the day- dawn and dusk. McFarland: One of the things I find so valuable about your writing is its honesty about the practical aspects of traveling in wilderness. You write about your truck, the mosquito netting, the inconveniences you encounter, the food you eat, and the nitty-gritty day-to-day stuff of life in addition to the awe-inspiring events. Did you make a conscious effort to counter the traditions established by folks like Thoreau, who make invisible some of the practical living parts? Zwinger: It was very unconscious. Basically, if you're writing true stuff, you're writing out of your personality and your own values and your own system, and I just happened to be a female who does not pose and say, "I'm this big glorious tough male." That kind of macho</page><page sequence="8">168 ISLE posing in the woods, which some contemporary male writers who are really wonderful do, is just not part of my personality. And I made a conscious decision to be entirely truthful. One thing that drives me nuts about Barry Lopez, for instance, is that all of a sud- den we're landed in the middle of this beautiful island in the Arctic, among super hard conditions, and camp is all set up and food is served. Then all of a sudden, he's somewhere else. And I go, wait a minute: how did you fly in, who paid for it, what are you eating, who's fixing it? Peter Mathieson does this in Africa all the time. And it just makes me crazy- it is so disappointing and false. I guess there is a value system there; it's like, okay, the slaves are- you know, the women, or the other cultures, and they are going to fix my dinner, so I don't even have to mention that. It's taken for granted and it becomes an invisible inequality that I don't like. One of my critics said, "I got so sick of her changing tires" and said that she didn't want to read any of that in the book- that the redness of it was a bad thing. But I know how younger people react when I give readings: "How do you do that? How do you change a tire? How many extra tires do you take?" They're not asking, "What's your philosophi- cal principle?" They ask about very practical things. I also guess that maybe as a woman, I'm trained that food is re- ally important for survival, and it's kind of tough up there all alone, because you can't just go get more food or fresh food. And so how do you eat a healthy diet? [Laughs.] And I like to know what people eat. You know, I think it tells something about people. As a backpacker, that's your dominant reality: food, warmth at night, getting your tent set up in the pouring rain, starting a fire in the pouring rain ... all those survival things are really dominant, as they still are throughout many parts of the world. And if we're really going to go out in the land and be vulnerable and open to it, I think we have to recognize that we go out as primitive humans again, and let the elements do with us what they will. Rather than landing and having dinner all set up and stuff. [Laughs.] McFarland: What other effects do you think your gender has had, if any, on your life and your travels? Zwinger: Well, it's harder for women to travel, but I never let that bother me. I grew up with an Air Force father who taught me skills like cutting with a chain saw or working a little bit on engines or building a kayak and learning to kayak. The message I got from those lessons was that there are no boundaries. But the verbal message I got was that women don't travel alone, you should get married so you can travel with your husband. But the actual physical message I was getting was you can kayak, you can cut wood, you can fix a truck, you can do</page><page sequence="9">Exploring "at the Edge of Things" 169 anything. When I do readings, younger women have approached me to say, "How do you do that? How do you travel in a truck alone? Can you go alone?" And then older women in particular have said, "Oh, you shouldn't go alone." I still get that out in the woods: "You shouldn't go out there alone." I've been doing this for years and years and years.... [Laughs.] Other people's assumptions about women aren't going to influence my ad- ventures. McFarland: It sounds as though people assume you- as a woman- should be scared alone out there, but one of the few times you actually express fear is when you come across that flapping orange tent in a field in Alaska. It seemed to embody isolation, loneliness, and a fear of death. You're not afraid of the other things, like going into a bar alone or dealing with people you encounter out there. It was just a tent, and you were so afraid. I found that really interesting. Zwinger: Well, I was fairly scared of the grizzly bears. Partially I was naÃ¯ve, because I thought because I was sleeping in my truck, I would be okay. But they can just open it with one claw, no problem- you know, "Should I use one claw or two to open it? Wow, I love these things! Crunchy on the outside and squishy on the inside!" [Laughs.] And yeah, there are real fears. When I'm walking alone, even with a dog, in grizzly bear country, I am afraid, but it's kind of a reality-based thing. Because I've studied grizzly bear biology and behavior and I know the risks. But the flapping orange thing had something to do with death. I thought maybe it was a tent with a dead body in it. It set up these irrational fears in me that were just huge. And every once in a while that happens to me. I usually don't write about it, but I really wanted to look at that particular fear experience. It happened to me a couple of weeks ago up in the North Cascades. I hiked four days up to get to this high alpine pass. Never made it up there, it was so wild, but I was camped in this dark, dark forest right before the pass, and all of a sudden I just got this scary, evil feeling. And the next morning I could hardly get out of there fast enough. It was totally irrational. So those kind of fears are interesting to me, like the tent. I'm also interested in fear because I think the way men handle fear and the way women handle fear and the way people handle fear is very different. I think men handle fear differently because they have to be more macho. And there are advantages and disadvantages to that. I also believe that human beings who don't go out in nature have all these unfounded fears about it, and I want to help clear that up for them. Because mostly it's safe. If you know how to go out there and you have good camping skills, it's very safe. In the desert, I'm out by</page><page sequence="10">170 ISLE rattlesnakes all the time, and I've never had a bad encounter. Although I've had many, many encounters with rattlesnakes, that's not a fear for me, because I understand what they're doing and how not to bother them. But fear is an interesting human emotion; it gets us in a lot of trouble. McFarland: You have traveled extensively and been a successful writer, artist, scholar, and teacher- what do you dream of doing that you haven't already done? Zwinger: I love to travel. I want to go to Africa. I'd like to learn more about the animals and some of the cultures there. Africa is very different from any place I've been. And I think Africa has always drawn artists. Picasso was really influenced by African images when he started in on the cubists or some of his very fragmented images, and artists all through European history were influenced by visits to Africa. And I love the energy of the dances. I was in an African-style dance troupe for a while. I hated trying to learn ballet or anything that kind of de- nies the earth, but African dance, you're pounding, you're connecting with the earth with all these repetitive poundings into the earth. And it just seems like it's part of the earth and about getting close to it. So the aesthetic- I guess it's the aesthetic that draws me, and I love the food, too. But I love almost all food. [Laughs.] The notion of visiting Africa really appeals to me. But there are so many places I'd love to go. I once thought that if I had unlimited funds, I would just travel, but I'd really have to make myself come back and write. You can't just go off and travel forever and not filter and process all that information and experience. Without the processing, you just become kind of a globetrotter- a purposeless wanderer. And there's no possibility for transformation that way. NOTES Sincere thanks to Jane Zwinger for allowing us to use her home for this interview.</page></plain_text>
