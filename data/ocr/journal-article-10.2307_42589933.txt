<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Thought , Fall 2004 9 Exploring John Dewey as Border-Crosser between Spiritual and Political Discourses: A Social Justice-Focused Teacher Educator Self-Study That Argues for More Attention to the Metaphysical Barbara Regenspan State University of New York at Binghamton Introduction In this article I engage in teacher educator self-study (Hamilton &amp; Pinnegar, 2000) to continue my own interpretation of John Dewey's writing and life example for use in my work with students. Both my data and thoughts have been generated in work with pre-service elementary education master's students in our social justice-focused program at the State University of New York at Binghamton, where much of our progressive social foundations orientation is integrated into our social reconstructionist curriculum and child development courses. In addi- tion, our final student teaching seminar is now combined with a course I designed called Social Action As Curriculum. In the context of Dewey's conception of "democracy as a way of life," I will consider the four themes that have guided my own curriculum- making with my students over time, and particularly, a fifth theme which has recently become central to that work. My primary interest is in framing the rationale for more attention to the metaphysical/spiritual dimension of our teaching in social justice-focused teacher education, which is a dimension that I believe is intimated in Dewey's expansive understanding of democracy. Autobiographical Rationale for This Article Given that religion and spirituality are typically conflated in academia,</page><page sequence="2">10 Exploring John Dewey as Border- Crosser and especially given that Dewey's relinquishment of the Christianity and the God of his childhood and young adulthood helped earn him his progressive credentials, I understand that I have some challenge ahead of me in terms of invoking Dewey's work in support of a spiritual dimension in my own teaching. To quell fears that I am interested in promoting a conception of a religious path for teacher education, let me establish immediately that my investment is in revaluing what I believe are common misconceptions regarding Dewey's understandings of the experimental nature of human life. In so doing, I will also trace the gradual shift in the focus of my own work with my students in response to this revaluing, from a strongly political orientation to an orientation that is grounded in both the political and the metaphysical. Whereas the primary goal of my practices in the past was to sensitize my students to the implications for education and public schooling concerning the phenomenon of oppression, in my current work I am equally focused on the potential quality of life in schools and communi- ties that freedom from oppression makes possible. For me, that shift means increased attention to that which animates life, to the spiritual or the metaphysical, the search for meaning that transcends the current realities of life. Such "realities," which Dewey himself acknowledged despite his romanticization of technology, are and have been the chief determinant of social and political relations, even in his day: the creation and consumption of material resources to generate profits for the few. Interestingly, it was my students who offered me an opening to begin to speak in terms of a "spiritual dimension" to my work with them and to their work as teachers of children. During a time when I was already inserting into my teacher education classes more of the hands-on, lively, community-exploration-based, integrated curriculum that had made el- ementary school teaching so gratifying to me for many years, my students were increasingly bringing to our classroom dialogues a consciousness of the destructiveness of the mass culture's passive consumption orientation on the "spirits" of children. Once invited to use the term "spirit," I took the risk of using the term "spiritual" despite its dependence on a specific context for meaning. The students and I then found that there was enough consensus among us for a loose, non-religious conception of spirituality due to the influence of philosophies asserting mind-body connection and the universal interdependence of all living things, which have seeped into the popular culture. Since discovering Dewey's writing in defense of the Alexander Technique (Alexander, 1932), which directly pleads for a consciousness of mind-body unity to guide all aspects of "human life" (including the organization of labor), my job has become much easier. Further, with very modest textual study, my students are now able to</page><page sequence="3">Barbara Regenspan 11_ appreciate that the Buddhist concept of "living mindfully" not only has a great deal in common with Dewey's conception of "democracy as a way of life," but that it also offers the possible advantage of correcting Dewey's (historically understandable) anthropomorphism. 1 In earlier years in teacher education my focus on the forces of oppression as they express themselves in schools forcefully highlighted the implicatedness of myself and my students in patterns of social inequity. I assumed that my students' ability to generate appropriate social reconstructionist curriculum, including quality teacher-child and child-child relationships, would emerge out of their own intensifying personalized social critique. I discovered, however, that the connections between that critique and what to do as a teacher were not as clear to my students as I had imagined. And there was a tendency for the students to identify with the practices of socially uncritical cooperating teachers if they appeared more empathie than I did to the students' understand- able feelings of inadequacy in the classroom. Further, I was missing the viscerality and physicality of the Dewey-inspired curriculum that had attracted me to elementary education in the early 1970s and that later moved me to become a teacher educator. I realized that academia had drawn me into "the life of the head" so successfully that I had gradually accommodated a practice of explaining and interpreting, which was further and further removed from the "action" or experience so central to Dewey's philosophy. Yet it was precisely my own appreciation of the empowering nature of thoughtful action that not only explained my investment in teacher education, but also inspired my continued activ- ism for social justice. Resulting from gradual responses to this re-evaluation, I now char- acterize my practice as a social justice-focused teacher educator, as an experimental democratic enterprise that resonates with the Buddhist injunction to live one's life as a mindful experimental enterprise. Relat- ing my experiences to this revaluing of Dewey's lifework, my practice is now based upon my new perception of and appreciation for the combina- tion of spiritual and political elements in Deweyan discourse. Although this combination continues to confound many political progressives, I am convinced that the border-crossings between discourses that it offers can inspire appropriate curriculum for contemporary social justice-focused teacher education, particularly in this disturbing historical era. The remainder of this article is organized into four labeled sections. First, I offer my rationale for embracing John Dewey's philosophy as the foundation of my own work with students in social justice-focused elementary teacher education. In this first section I also identify the four Deweyan themes into which I have, until recently, woven all other</page><page sequence="4">12 Exploring John Dewey as Border- Crosser sources for research-based theory and practices. In the second section, I identify and describe a fifth theme that has recently become central to newer practices, which I describe. Third, I consider what it will take to inspire in our students the broader social and political activism that was central to Dewey's own work and to his conception of "human life." In addition, I grapple with the reality that an acceptance of human limita- tion - missing in most ideologically progressive educational foundations theory - appears to make possible the plunge into community activist experience, which the SUNY Binghamton program requires from stu- dents. Finally, I argue that within our current cultural atmosphere, the multiple levels of risk-taking required to practice social justice-focused teacher education can only happen in a context, in which there is an acceptance of human limitations. The Usefulness of John Dewey's Philosophy for Contemporary Social Justice-Focused Teacher Education My work with students is based upon four themes, which emerge from the following personal and socio-political assumptions: (1) The struggle for social equity is good; (2) Democracy is tied to the struggle to appropriately play out individuality within community; (3) The work of teaching is noble and doing it well requires a degree of differentiation from one's family/community of origin; (4) We grapple in a contingent, unpredictable world. I will engage in further discussion of all four of my recurring themes by using them as the subheadings throughout the following section. The Struggle for Social Equity is Good At present, with simplistic, right-wing, pro-militarist, and imperial ideologies both trickling down to, and literally constructing public school curriculum, Dewey earns his role as a visiting philosopher to my elementary education curriculum and supervision courses, in that he viewed the social class structure as antithetical to democracy. Of more specific significance to me, however, is the fact that he intimated this critique of capitalism (better developed in numerous other writings) in the same book, The School and Society / The Child and the Curriculum (1990/1902) that valorizes, without sentimentality, the imaginations of</page><page sequence="5">Barbara Regenspan 13 children. He also proposes a public school curriculum that both appeals to my students' love of children and makes sense to them from the perspective of what their own schooling lacked. Related to the above, the connective tissue between the love of children and the opposition to an economic system that benefits the few is his quest for the "truly moral", the "good," the "free," and the "rational," which he equates with "truly human life." In a few compelling citations from Democracy and Education (1916) he defines the bedrock reality of all of the work that my students and I do together and the work we anticipate them doing with their students. Dewey explains that "the peculiarity of truly human life is that man has to create himself by his own voluntary efforts; he has to make himself a truly moral, rational, and free being" (D&amp;E, p. 95). Dewey further explains the direction offered for this pursuit of one's "true" self: A democracy is more than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience. The extension in space of the number of individuals who participate in an interest so that each has to refer his own action to that of others, and to consider the action of others to give point and direction to his own, is equivalent to the breaking down of those barriers of class, race, and national territory which kept men from perceiving the full import of their activity, (p. 87) I explore with my students Dewey's use, twice in that first sentence, of the word "truly," which is an adjective no curriculum theorist or progressive educational philosopher of the current historical era could ever employ. To me, that word is indicative of the moral/spiritual assumption that underlies all of Dewey's work. It distances him from many contemporary radical academics in education because of the poverty of metaphysical inquiry underlying the critical race, class and gender theory of our own era. Democracy Is Tied to the Struggle To Appropriately Play Out Individuality in Community "True to what?" is a question that troubles progressives looking for more concrete guidance than Dewey ever offered about how to build a movement for social justice. Yet for my students, Dewey's belief that the struggle to enact a conception of democracy grounded in social equity represents "goodness" and "truth" comes relatively easily. They recog- nize the crossover discourse in Dewey's philosophy between the spiritual and the political that leads them to identify their own best instincts for children in an emerging critique of social inequality.</page><page sequence="6">14 Exploring John Dewey as Border- Crosser My students are typically not initially focused on building a move- ment for social justice. However, they readily observe that "the cards are stacked against" many of the children in the classrooms in which they intern; Jean Anyon's Social Class and School Knowledge (1981) speaks to them immediately. They want to know how to help all of the children in their internship classrooms value one another, how to help them identify one another's strengths and possibilities, and how to build a curriculum that speaks to those possibilities. That is why, when studied immediately after the Anyon piece, the essay "Treating Expectations for Competence," in Elizabeth Cohen's intriguing book about group work (1994), reconnects us so powerfully with Dewey's metaphysical edge and its tight relationship to the quest for democracy. Cohen is concerned with the creation of circumstances whereby children will value one another through the interaction of their own "competencies," reflecting that such a process is the object of classroom life. My students can readily identify the parallel nature of such "class- room life" and Dewey's "truly human life." Classroom life is a microcosm for the ideal society: No one could better express than did [Plato] the fact that a society is stably organized when each individual is doing that for which he has aptitude by nature in such a way as to be useful to others (or to contribute to the whole to which he belongs); and it is the business of education to discover these aptitudes and progressively to train them for social use. (p. 88) The Work of Teaching Is Noble and Doing It Well Requires a Degree of Differentiation from One's Family/Community of Origin Dewey affirms not only the direction my students want to move in as teachers, but also their own value and importance expressed through the choice to do this work, when he states that it is for "men striving to educate their successors not for the existing state of affairs but so as to make possible a future better humanity" (p. 95). He also gives them important insight into a reality of human limitation, in which they are positioned by the very nature of our program to recognize. Unfortu- nately, according to Dewey, parents are typically obstacles in that they "educate their children so that they may get on; princes educate their subjects as instrument of their own purposes" (p. 95). Students are opened to non-defensive exploration of their own social construction in families who want them to "get on" in the social status quo. Dewey offers my generally middle class students a "next step" in</page><page sequence="7">Barbara Regenspan 15_ their own ongoing process of healthy differentiation from their families of origin. The practice of democracy "as a way of life" necessitates a continual personal movement in the direction of taking action in groups (constituted by individuals) based on the best available thinking (Dewey called acting on the best available thinking "science"). In addition, students are fortified with both the knowledge that outcomes are not necessarily predictable, and the willingness to continually self-critique and articulate réévalua- tions of belief, theory, and policy/practice implications. We Grapple in a Contingent , Unpredictable World For Dewey, democracy was both a goal of all "consummatory expe- rience" and a way of being that made what he called "human life" possible. According to Deweyan biographer Robert Westbrook, Dewey notes in Experience and Nature that democracy requires a world. In Dewey's words, we are in A universe in which there is real uncertainty and contingency, a world which is not all in, and never will be, a world which in some respect is incomplete and in the making, and which in these respects may be made this way or that according as men judge, prize, love and labor. (Westbrook, 1991, p. 362) My students are invited to judge, prize, love, and labor their way through the process of becoming social reconstructionist curriculum-makers. Early in our program, I briefly introduce my students to what Lillian Weber terms as "grappling," which is the process of acting to understand and understanding to act in a universe of contingencies (Weber, 1997, p. 96-101). Weber reminds teacher educators that aspiring teachers in our courses, and children in classrooms will engage in this process no matter what we provide as resources. It is the quest for "final truths" and "certainty" that contaminated this process of grappling, and she admon- ishes her students to refuse complicity with such a quest. What Weber set in motion at the Dewey-inspired City College Work- shop Center for Open Education was a process of continual action and re- evaluation with others in an environment rich in the materials of natural science and human cultural artifacts. Her almost militant refusal to collude with her teacher-students' desire for definitive answers from books resonates with Dewey's insistence on experience as the cornerstone of the primary curriculum, his critique of the parent as likely enforcer of the status quo, and his understanding of our world as one "not [and never] all in." Weber reinforces the reality that the desire to help one's own children, including those in one's classroom, "get on" is natural, yet that natural response becomes the obstacle to grappling. Awareness such obstacles,</page><page sequence="8">16 Exploring John Dewey as Border-Crosser therefore, defines for our students the spiritual path of rejecting singular definitive answers in favor of plunging into experience. The Uncovering of a Fifth Deweyan Theme We have known and taught that Deweyan education spirals outward from children's interests, given that those interests are those whose exploration would lead to "genuinely educative experience." Not only did Dewey reject education both as a commodity and as a pandering to a limited conception of imagination as fantasy, but he also rejected what was the realization of an adult-conceived stylized product. The teacher's role was the selection and the shaping of children's interests into educative, important, expansive inquiries. The rich lower school inquiry- and-experience-driven curriculum of the Dewey lab school, selectively spiraled from children's interests to ultimately explore the history of human making and doing, laid the groundwork for both the older children's more conventional assimilation of enriching content-area knowledge, and for the application of imagination to real social chal- lenges by students/people of all ages. As previously stated, I learned over time through my own work in teacher education that focusing solely on social inequity in schools cannot substitute for enacting the notion that students' and teachers' moral and aesthetic concerns might be necessary for social equity within schools and society to be possible. Fortunately, Dewey's The School and Society I The Child and the Curriculum supplies the foundation for such an enactment. Like myself, many progressives in teacher education, who are typically influenced by our best and often least-privileged students, have become convinced that critical theory and post-structuralism - including post- colonial theories - can themselves become commodities that distract us from providing "genuinely educative experience" in this work. The recent dissemination via internet of Dewey's presentation to the New York Medical Society in 1928 and his introduction to F. M. Alexander's Uses of the Self (1932) raises the probability that Dewey would have supported the understanding that the generation and consumption of much socially critical theory, which almost no one within the public school is positioned to enact, generates cynicism within our education students. Nothing is more devastating to the process of building a consensus for social reconstruction than cynicism. In resistance to the cynicism of his own era, Dewey was moved by his friendship with F.M. Alexander and his own practice of the Alexander Technique, which was a kind of passive yoga focused on the breath. By embracing this practice, Dewey acted as an advocate for a conception of "mind-body in a unified</page><page sequence="9">Barbara Regenspan 17 wholeness of operation" that resonates with the Buddhist direction of living mindfully. He writes: Thus the question of integration of mind-body in action is the most practical of all questions we can ask of our civilization. It is not just a speculative question, it is a demand - a demand that the labor of multitudes now too predominantly physical in character be inspirited by purpose and emotion and informed by knowledge and understand- ing. It is a demand that what now pass for highly intellectual and spiritual functions shall be integrated with the ultimate conditions and means of all achievement, namely the physical, and thereby accomplish something beyond themselves. Until this integration is effected in the only place where it can be carried out, in action itself, we shall continue to live in a society in which a soulless and heartless materialism is compensated for by soulful but futile idealism and spiritualism. (Dewey in Alexander, 1932) The division in question is so deep-seated that it has affected even our language. We have no word by which to name mind-body in a unified wholeness of operation. For if we said "human life" few would recognize that it is precisely the unity of mind and body in action to which we were referring. (Dewey, 1928) Dewey's writings lead to the question: What are the implications of Dewey's "mind-body in a unified wholeness of operation" for our work in contemporary social justice-focused teacher education? Human Making and Doing Contests the Naturalness of the Division of Labor In recent research inspired by the above citations (Regenspan, 2002), I explored and experimented his conceptions of mind-body wholeness in curriculum workshops with my students. A fifth theme organized my work, which recognized that human making and doing (while interpret- ing and consciously breathing), which Dewey (1928) called "mind-body in unified wholeness of operation," contests the naturalness of the division of labor. To contest that "naturalness" is to challenge the contemporary discourse of production and consumption in schools and in the communities that circumscribe schools. I understood literally and interpreted as Dewyan the challenge offered by Hamilton and Pinnegar (2000) as part of their criteria for teacher educator self-study: If we were trustworthy as teacher educa- tors, we would act with our students exactly the way we expected them to act with their students (p. 238). After working in small groups with a specifically focused study guide (which I will not discuss here) to</page><page sequence="10">18 Exploring John Dewey as Border- Crosser structure discussion of The School and Society / The Child and the Curriculum , I asked my students to respond to Dewey's directive for integration of the intellectual and the physical by constructing indi- vidual pinch-pots out of clay while recording collective responses to a writing prompt. Students brainstormed around the following: We are members of an early human community living by the banks of a clay- bottom river. The possibility of a container made out of the clay has just emerged. Identify potential changes (while attempting to categorize them "positive" or "negative") in our (imagined) early human community related to the emergence of the clay pot container. Briefly, the general rationale I offered for this work was the need for our students to experience the specific role elementary education can play in the pursuit of global social justice through the pursuit of greater economic equity. It can foster a vision of, even model an enactment of, "the wholeness of labor" (my language), whereby the thinking/directing and doing aspects of labor are not separated and respectively assigned to different people. In speaking to the problems of a division of labor between "cultured people" and "workers" in his text about school curriculum- making, The School and Society / The Child and the Curriculum , Dewey establishes that the way we are typically expected to learn is antithetical to our humanness in precisely the same way that the way we are expected to work is antithetical to our humanness. Further, the spiritually mis- guided nature of these parallel expectations is exposed in Dewey's particu- lar wisdom about human beings; most human beings are not drawn to thinking in the abstract, but rather, want to make and to do in a context, in which we have the power to think about what, why, and for whom we are making and doing. Crafting the argument so that it is especially compelling for the work of elementary teacher education, The School and Society / The Child and the Curriculum establishes that elementary school is the place to replicate the history of human doing and making. The purpose of elementary education is to retrace the building of human communities and their rationales and to empower children to couple the uncovered knowledge with the requisite imagination and discipline to address the community's problems and challenges of the present. In the citations from Dewey's 1928 presentation and his 1932 introduction to the Alexander text, Dewey uses a metaphysical discourse to suggest the possibility of what I call "the wholeness of labor." If we agree that our students (and their students) need this vision of quality (for Dewey "quality" equates with "democratic") human life that the phenomenon of oppression masks and distorts - then for those of us drawn to the work of teacher education out of our own commitments to fight for social justice - Hamilton and Pinnegar's equation of success in</page><page sequence="11">Barbara Regenspan 19 the work of teacher education with "integrity" and/or "trustworthiness" has a Deweyan kind of validity. We enact with them what we expect them to enact with their students, in that we challenge the limited individu- alistic conception of imagination many of them have internalized, which is the very conception that Dewey ridicules for its failure to exploit the positive social inclinations of children. In so doing, we articulate the experimental nature of our own grap- pling with appropriate curriculum for social justice-focused teacher edu- cation. Such grappling brings into our work a model of human beings striving to live Dewey's conception of "human life." For example, in my introductory curriculum course this term we are meditating for the first five minutes of class in order to consciously access our own breathing, our connection to "mind-body in wholeness of operation." Then, we plunge into curriculum making. Currently, we are using homemade gelatin-in-cookie- sheet printing presses to continue exploring the possibilities of a "whole- ness of labor" discourse. When students grapple with making collective sense of our course readings, and then "publishing" in class the results of their sense-making process, they experience what it might be like to live in a society where they would have some democratic input with regard to what gets published and why. At the same time, they are experimenting with Dewey-inspired curriculum particularly appropriate for the elemen- tary classroom, for we introduce the potential to take "in-house" publish- ing of children's stories to the level of "mass" production. Coupling such activity with the theory of African-American educator Lisa Delpit (1995) allows my students to experience the social ^con- structionist dream of expanding what Delpit calls the "codes of the culture of power" so that these typically exclusive codes are influenced by the writing they do in class, and then, potentially, by the curriculum they spiral with the young people they teach. Building a Movement for Social Justice in Teacher Education Although I now believe that the political task of "expanding the codes" can be supported by an appropriate Deweyan curriculum in teacher education, what of the more daunting social reconstructionist task of building support for activism against oppression outside of educational institutions, which Dewey's lifework modeled as well? Ap- preciating that teachers are socially constructed individuals who will have an impact on the social construction of the current generation of children makes insights available from contemporary critical theory, post-colonial theory, race theory, and feminist post-structuralist re- search on schooling and education important to my work. Yet, as has</page><page sequence="12">20 Exploring John Dewey as Border-Crosser been stated earlier, with years of work in teacher education I know that these insights do not initially transfer to the education of the actual human beings I teach. Their socially constructed attitudes are not neutralized by the availability of new theory, even when that theory is labeled "emancipatory." It is no longer surprising to me that critical theory initially fails to connect with many of my students, even leaving some of them feeling attacked. Most have never internalized a concep- tion of structural inequalities in the society, let alone the thinking that their unearned privilege (especially for those who are white and middle class) implicates them in an exploitative system's perpetuation. And very few have experienced the potential expansiveness of living con- sciously and strategically in multiple subject positions, making much feminist poststructuralist theory equally abstract when it does not, alternatively, provoke the unsafety and silencing so effectively charac- terized by educational researchers such as Elizabeth Ellsworth (1989). Again, it was Dewey who has made the strongest case for an education, which takes as its starting point those student interests that would provide a "genuinely educative experience. Therefore, what in- sights can a contemporary teacher educator and activist glean from Dewey's premise, given that the overwhelming majority of our students never experienced in their early schooling that educative under layer for which he so convincingly advocated? How can we compensate for the reality that they missed the personalized entrée into the history of human making and doing in community, which Dewey believed would shape the pro-democratic consciousness, in which the seeds of demo- cratic citizen activism, not just knowledge, might find fertile ground? Further, understanding that the historical era itself helps to construct the consciousness of the learner, how do we use our awareness that our students did not live through the emerging labor movement, the brief period in which the Socialist Party had real influence on mainstream politics, or the movement to outlaw war, as Dewey did? How do we factor into our pedagogy the reality that many of us teaching prospective teachers out of our own commitments to social justice are currently peace activists who did live through, even participate in, the Civil Rights movement, the feminist movement, and the protest movements against the War in Vietnam, and that most of our students did not? Interestingly, the most profound contradiction in the non-Dewyan critical social foundations texts that frame contemporary progressive educational discourse is that although its' authors perceive "truth" only in the realities of social complexity, contingency and contradiction, these "truths" rarely translate into theory or practice that acknowledges human limitation in the process of making social change, which of course</page><page sequence="13">Barbara Regenspan 21 includes change in schools. The permission to make mistakes that teacher educators advocate for in our students' work with children, is lacking in the progressive foundations literature, which, equally inter- estingly, does not even begin to broach the construction of theory on how to inspire political activism in our students. A Focus on Limitations Makes Possible Social Action as Curriculum Social Action As Curriculum is the culminating course in our social justice-focused master's program in elementary education at SUNY Binghamton. The course requires students to pursue, within or outside of a public school, a community activist commitment inspired by the program's vision of social equity and justice. In the past four years these projects have included cultural histories murals and photographic essays created with children in two schools and an inner city housing development, a proposal for a youth credit union at the local housing authority, a successful book drive organized and enacted by first and second graders, English-teaching to Iraqi men who work with the anti-sanctions organization Voices in the Wilderness , poetry-writing with teenagers in detention, the building of a trail through a nature preserve on land adjacent to an elementary school, a lunch-time research group with children pursuing information about a local - now infamous toxic industrial spill, and a collectively created "Museum of Social Advocacy as Art" (featuring a collaboration with a sister city project in El Charcon, El Salvador). Organizing efforts also include working against the Rockefeller drug laws, puppy mills, marginalization of blind and deaf people, and child labor. Currently, some of our elemen- tary education students are involved in our doctoral program's recent initiative called Teachers for Peace, an effort to support anti- war teachers and curriculum in public schools. Paradoxically, the Social Action As Curriculum seminar that sup- ports these projects features the fewest theoretical foundational texts of any course I teach in our program. Instead, we read multicultural fiction and memoirs that explore the spiritual journeys of teachers and students who, in the course of the stories, become activists. The study guides that accompany our reading of Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father , (1995) for instance, require students to interrogate the social construc- tion of what they initially tend to conceive of as psychological constraints of the characters. We gradually build a critique that begins with compas- sion for these characters and ends with compassion for ourselves as (often) first-time activists.</page><page sequence="14">22 Exploring John Dewey as Border-Crosser During the past few years I have learned that the relative success of the projects has an uncanny relationship to the amount of seminar time devoted to a focus on the multiple limitations that constrain our efforts. Like the protagonists of the life stories we read, the initial interests of students typically construct them as "visitors" in the communities willing to host their efforts. We spend time projecting different types of potential disappointments relative to the students' hoped-for outcomes while the projects are in the planning stages. Incidents from John Dewey's life are particularly inspirational; in that he never regretted his involvement in "failed" efforts to mass circulate a progressive newspaper, to outlaw war, or to have a positive impact on public schooling. In the course of pushing for progressive social change, he wrongly colluded with redbaiting, roman- ticization of technological innovation, and even, as some charge, sexism, racism, and the growth of the military industrial complex. We return continually to our collective limitations as "men [and, more typically women] striving to educate their successors not for the existing state of affairs but so as to make possible a future better humanity." We face that in this work we have going against us not only the structural inequalities in the society whose specific manifestations we want to contest through our projects, and our own necessarily limited situatedness, but also the related spiritual lack of integration Dewey identifies in his plea for mind-body connectedness. I have learned that this more encompassing, yet in many ways more personal focus on our limitations has made selections from critical foundational texts acces- sible to some of my students for the first time. I believe this is the case because they are now invited into them as "insiders." To use social critique well, one must identify as a potential activist; this reality, too, reflects Dewey's vision of "mind-body in wholeness of operation." Participation in this active struggle has been personally emancipatory for many of them, as well as the children they will teach. The potential for personal emancipation comes with a new orientation to the work of teaching conflated with the work of "living," which in the Deweyan sense is not focused on success, or "getting on," but rather, on a process that is always somewhat experimental in character. "Democracy as a way of life" is this continual experiment. In the current historical era this experiment is particularly challeng- ing. As I write this paper the sabers that rattled for Afghanistan and Iraq are turned in the direction of Iran. While there are significant indicators that the majority of Americans know they were lied to regarding the motivations and the costs of both of the recent invasions, fear continues to keep most people allied with the current administration's global life- endangering course. The Vice President's corporate interests are en-</page><page sequence="15">Barbara Regenspan 23^ riched by the contracts to build the country we just invaded and signifi- cantly destroyed, as overtime pay is threatened for millions of U.S. workers. While the Patriot Act nullifies our most taken-for-granted civil liberties, a parallel and closely related climate of fear increasingly domi- nates our schools, which are places where the futures of our children and their teachers are increasingly determined by test scores, where Head Start programs are endangered, and parents, too, are offered reduced emotional and material resources to support the most vulnerable children. The mothers of the four-year-olds I taught in my first urban teacher position would not get daycare coverage to go to college today as they did in the 197 Os, and although bordering pockets of gentrification, the deterio- ration of their neighborhood has escalated to a state of devastation. In the local schools where I now place beloved student teachers, other than in rare individual classrooms, an ethnic dish of the month club is the only evidence of "doing multicultural education." Further, except in public schools that are part of the Coalition ofEssential Schools Consortium , you can hardly say the word "racism" much less organize to combat it. In New York state, where I live, the Dewey-inspired curriculum of the public Consortium schools, one of which my own children are fortunate enough to attend, is currently endangered by the revocation of waivers from the State Department of Education, which permitted these schools to use portfolio and performance assessments in place of Regents exams. In response to these daunting obstacles, a "spiritualized" political discourse finds another application in my work with students. I make explicit that we human beings are limited creatures; yet we share one thing worth our investment: the continual growth project described (with slight variations) by Dewey in different phases of his lifework. It is a growth project that implicates them personally and that will always provide inspiration not only for their work in schools and communities, but also for their quest to create meaningful personal lives by practicing "democracy as a way of life." We have reached the point in progressive teacher education where we have generated far more critique about the structure of social inequity and its replication in schools than anyone knows how to apply. Class analysis and its increasingly finer tunings in critical theory and feminist post-structuralist interpretations of schooling do not create a strong enough foundation for social justice-inspired teacher education unless offered in an activist context. The problem isn't knowing too much per se; it's the distorted nature of knowledge that is not created in interaction, knowledge, then, that denies the spiritual complexity of the project of human life and growth, which includes human limitation. Classroom teachers cannot do good work with children without acknowl-</page><page sequence="16">24 Exploring John Dewey as Border- Crosser edging this complexity. Further, if they see that its acknowledgement is missing in the work of teacher educators, they dismiss those of us in teacher education as irrelevant. Conclusion: The Urgency of Attention to the Spiritual Dimensions of Our Work in the Current Historical Era I want to conclude by raising the probability that the pursuit of social justice, which must become the basis for renewed activity in the public world, including the world of public schooling, will not be successfully motivated by more knowledge about the current state of social inequi- ties. In the words of Pulitzer prize winner Ernest Becker, "beyond a given point man is not helped by more 'knowing', but only by living and doing in a partly self-forgetful way" (p. 199). It is likely that if John Dewey were alive today his philosophies would be viewed as a combination of positive psychology, Buddhist mindfulness, chaos theory, and class analysis, which included with an awareness that the same bodies of thinking guided his actual life. Dewey's relevance is explained by a continual focus on structural inequality, the potential to use intelligence to address policy aimed at a "public good" and an awareness of the continually contingent and unpredictable character of human life in community. I believe that our students only understand what Dewey has to offer if we teacher educators focus on "consciousness" in both its political and spiritual conceptions. Finally, I want to appreciate that Dewey's writing and lifework has doubled the resources available for our challeng- ing work with our students in social justice-focused teacher education by identifying two different levels of potential student receptivity in his effective border crossing between political and spiritual discourses.
