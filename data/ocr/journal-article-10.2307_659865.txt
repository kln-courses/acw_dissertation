Pages 1-12 of this well-printed guide to the City Ethnological Mu- seum of Cologne from the competent hand of Dr Foy give a brief history of the Museum, and pages 13-42 are devoted to very good brief intro- ductory essays on ethnology, the general evolution of human civilization, primitive and civilized peoples, races and peoples. The rest of the book is descriptive of the collections in the Museum, each grand division and its subdivisions: Australia, the South Sea (New Guinea, Eastern Mela- nesia, Bismarck Archipelago, Micronesia, and Polynesia), America(South, Central, North), Africa, Asia (Asia Minor, India, Indonesia, Siberia, Central Asia, East Asia), having a brief general discussion of its culture- phenomena, etc., as a sort of introduction. The illustrations consist of characteristic specimens, those in the section on America(pp. 144-170), e. g., are: a feather hip-ornament of the Chiamacoco, a primitive Boror6 human figure, an ancient Peruvian anthropomorphic vase, an ancient stone vessel from Costa Rica, tomahawks of the Prairie Indians (of the three figures on page i66 one is of the type given by Holmes on p. 271 of the American Anthropologist, N. S., 19o8, x, another approximately of the type on p. 265, while the third is of the stone club variety), a basket of the Yakima, a raven-mask from western Vancouver island, and an Eskimo kaiak. A useful feature of the book is the small maps of each continental and important area. The American collections in the Mu- seum represent the Fuegians, Araucanians, and Patagonians; Indians of the Gran Chaco; Forest Indians of Paraguay; Forest Indians of Brazil and westward; Guiana Indians; Peruvian antiquities; Central American and Mexican antiquities; North American Forest and Prairie Indians; Indians of the Northwest Coast; Aleuts and Eskimo. The library of the Museum now contains 1740 works in 2900 volumes. There are also about 960 lantern-slides for use in lectures, etc. The organ of the Museum, " Ethnologica, " will begin publication this year. The citizens of Cologne owe this excellent Museum to the generosity of Mr and Mrs Rautenstrauch, to whom had been left a large part of the collections of Prof. Wilhelm Joest. ALEXANDER F.
