<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION NOTE The Figure of Euthyphro in Plato's Dialogue WILLIAM D. FURLEY Probably the most influential, or at least most widely consulted, English language commentary on the Euthyphro, that of Burnet in 1924, has some very odd things to say about Euthyphro, which need correcting, in my opinion. Bumet argues against the traditional view that Euthyphro is a kind of "docteur en thdologie traditionelle" (M. Croiset'), in favour of an interpretation which sees Euthyphro as a "sectary of some kind" (p. 5), someone on the fringe of conventional Athenian society, parallel to the Pythagorean Telauges with whom Socrates converses in a dialogue of Aeschines, someone who receives ridicule for his religious position at the hands of the Athenians (p. 5), in short as a "kindred spirit" (p. 6) to Socrates in the matter of the latter's alleged invention of new gods. Clearly this view has far-reaching impli- cations for the way we read the dialogue, if true.2 In particular, it bears on two questions: (1) One main charge against Socrates was 'inventing new gods'; how far are we to see Euthyphro as a defender of the old? (2) Connected with this, Plato introduces what looks like a precursor of the fully- fledged theory of Forms as an argumentative strategy when Euthyphro talks of many holy things instead of The Holy (6 D 9-10: ?XE7LVO OtVT TO E18os, ibid. JLia LbiE? T&amp; TE &amp;VOW60 &amp;V6oo ELVXL XO&amp;r Tr oova 0&amp;Lt. Also, 6 E 2-5). If Euthyphro is a representative of the old anthropomorphic religion, then we see Plato's ambition for the Forms; if he is a religious innovator himself, as Bumet and others seem to think, then the theory of Forms is demoted to the position of one among other equally new-fangled alternatives. History does not help us a great deal in identifying Euthyphro's position in the religious spectrum current at Athens. Plato appears to mean the same Euthyphro in 1 M. Croiset, Platon, Oeuvres Completes, Tome I, Paris 1920 p. 179. 2 J. Bumet, Plato's Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates, and Crito, Oxford 1924. That Burnet's view is not an isolated freak can be seen in A. E. Taylor's words (Plato, London 1926 p. 147): "As to the main purpose of the dialogue, again, I think Bumet is clearly right. As both Plato and Aeschines represent, Socrates had lived in association with religious ascetics and mystics of the Orphic type; everyone also knew that he had been formally convicted of some kind of religious innovation. The natural inference would have been that he was himself a sectary much of the same type as Euthyphro...". Likewise we find Taylor's position on this point being taken up by R. G. Hoerber, Plato's Euthyphro, Phronesis 3, 1958, p. 96: "Is Euthyphro representative of the populace of Athens? Grote, Jowett and Comford, for example, answer in the affirmative; A. E. Taylor objects ... We tend to agree with Taylor . . .. 201</page><page sequence="2">the Cratylus, whom Socrates attributes with expertise in etymology, divine in- spiration (&amp;vOovuTozv) and divine wisdom (8atpovia eoqia, albeit ironically, in his favourite manner.3 We learn from our dialogue that Euthyphro was a pdvns (3e3), one who was very sure of his interpretation of divine will with respect to Athenian law (4e4-5al); we hear that he has resided on Naxos, where his father held lands. Presumably they were xXqpoD3XoL, holders of land apportioned by (Athenian) lot;4 now the Athenian land-holdings of this sort had to be relinquished in 404 B.C. This gives us a time lapse of at least four years between the act for which Euthyphro is prosecuting his father and the dramatic date of our dialogue.5 We know further that Euthyphro appeared publicly before the Athenian Assembly in his capacity as seer (3c 1). Plato makes him totally ignorant of the charge to be brought against Socrates by Meletus when the two meet outside the office of the Archon Basileus, though he knows Socrates well, and is apparently a fervent admirer of him as a man (3a6-8). The historical evidence is sketchy enough, but Burnet uses it to try and button- hole Euthyphro. Naxos, he writes, is close to Paros, which was a hot-bed of Pytha- goreans; some of their crankiness is therefore likely to have rubbed off on Euthyphro; Naxos was famous for its cult of Dionysus. This, insinuates Burnet quite unjustly, makes it likely that Euthyphro became imbued with a religion foreign to the Athenians.6 Likewise he was an "authority" on Uranus and Cronus, as evidenced by both our dialogue and the mention in the Cratylus. Taylor has taken this last point up and written: "It was a duty of piety to his (Socrates') memory to make it clear that his views on religion were very different from those of a sect who found the 'deep things of God' in stories like those of the binding of Cronus and the mutilation of Uranus - tales which had nothing to do with the official worship of Athens and were repulsive to the ordinary Athenian."7 Since Euthyphro's fondness for the tale of Zeus' treatment of Cronus has been used as the main evidence against his being a traditional Athenian theologian, we had better examine the charge.8 Euthyphro is conducting a suit against his elderly father for the accidental manslaughter of a member of his work-force, who was himself a murderer awaiting trial. Euthyphro's friends and relations are incensed by his intention of prosecuting his own father on such murky grounds, but Euthyphro tells them, as he now tells Socrates (5e2-3), that there is a compelling divine precedent (?rx pwv 5e2) for his action: Zeus himself, whom men hold to be the highest and justest of gods, bound his father Cronus, because the father had swallowed his children unlawfully: 8TL rovis vets xwrrinvev o&amp;vx (v 8&amp;xn (6a l). Euthyphro tacks on the similar action of Cronus before him against his father Uranus, for good measure. 3 396d2-397al. 4 Bumet 1924, p. 25. 5 Bumet's explanation (1924, p. 25) that the revision of Athenian laws following the restoration of democracy in 403 B.C. was responsible for the delay in Euthyphro's law-suit, seems plausible. Hoerber (1958, p. 97) prefers to think Euthyphro had waited that long before prosecuting his father. 6 Burnet 1924, p. 5-6. 7 Taylor 1926, p. 147. 8 Hoerber 1958, p. 96 writes: "Euthyphro's implicit faith in militant Olympians reflects Orphic beliefs rather than popular tenets." 202</page><page sequence="3">It is intimated that Euthyphro's use of this mythical precedent marks him as a "sectary of some kind", much as the story of creation from an egg, for example, marked a man as a follower of Orphic cosmogony.9 Nothing could be further from the truth. The version of the cosmogony used by Euthyphro is that canonized by Hesiod in the Theogony and the Works and Days, whom the Greeks accepted, with Homer, as founders of their public pantheon.10 Homer too regularly recognizes Cronus and the Titans as the forerunners of the present-day Olympians.1" Cronus was anything but a sectarian deity: at Athens he was chiefly famous for the festival of the Cronia, a rural feast one of whose features was slaves' exchanging roles with their masters.12 Cronus' role as tutelary god of the honest country life seems to accord with Pindar's depiction of him as Lord over the Islands of the Blessed,13 and with Hesiod's view that men of the Golden Age lived under Cronus.14 The Roman equivalent of Cronus, Saturn, is likewise connected by Vergil in the Georgics with the state of man in the blissful, golden age.15 There was moreover a temple of Cronus on the Athenian Acropolis.16 It would be wrong to claim that a man who relied on the authority of Homer, Hesiod, Pindar was guilty of aligning himself with an eccentric sect. What is true is that many Greeks found the tales of internecine feuds among the gods distasteful generally.'7 We have Plato's severe censure of precisely such tales as the fight between Zeus and Cronus, Hera and Hephaestus, in the Republic (378aff.) and a statement by the False Argument in Aristophanes' Clouds (904ff.) which seems to indicate general Athenian non-approval for Zeus' retaliation against his father: sCos 8irxa Aix,qs olkcpjs 6 Ze6s o'vx &amp;i%6X.XEv ir6v 'acrp' aVxrov 8ioas; "How comes is that Zeus is still around after binding his own father, if there really is a Justice?" What these voices of protest give expression to is dissatisfaction with the idea of feuding gods, and particularly sons feuding with their fathers, not an indication that these tales were the province of cranks. By aligning himself with Zeus and Uranus in their "law-suits", Euthyphro aligns himself with the older, traditional order, before men had begun to question its authority, much as a disciplinarian nowadays might hark back to the days of unquestioned parental authority under Queen Victoria, regardless of how damaging severe disciplining may have been to impressionable youthful minds (this is Plato's criticism of the effects of myths such as the one in question on the minds of the young, Republic 378a). Euthyphro's position is that of one cleaving to a tradition which has begun to 9 Orphic fragments 60, 61, 70 and 86. 10 Theogony 127-506; Works and Days 109-120. Plato himself attributes the succession myth Uranus, Cronus, Zeus to Hesiod's genealogy in Cratylus 396b3-c5. Herodotus' comment on the "canonizing" influence of the works of Homer and Hesiod on Greek religion is too well known to need repeating (2, 53). 11 e.g. Iliad 5, 893; 8, 477ff.; 14, 203, 224, 274, 278. 12 Accius apud Macrob. 1 7, 37; Athenaeus 639 d; Plutarch, mor. 1098 b. 13 Pindar, Pyth. 4, 291; 01. 2, 75ff. 14 Works and Days 109-120. 15 Georgics II 523-540. 16 Pausanias, Attica I, 18, 7. 17 cf. Isocrates XI 38-40. 203</page><page sequence="4">come under fire from progressive thinkers. It is the very opposite of the Orphic or Pythagorean sectary, with whom Burnet would have us equate him. The most compelling reasons for reading Euthyphro in this way, however, are to be found in the ironic structure of the dialogue, as conceived by Plato. Socrates is to be prosecuted by one Meletus for inventing new gods (qrqri y4p F aroviin4v ElvL tEXLv, xa; 's X4XLVO'Vs 'OLOUVoT?4 &amp; S 'TOi 8'&amp;fpxl'OVS ot VOPIovrna iyp6+afo ... 3b l-3) and for corrupting the youth of Athens (2c3-3a5). Euthyphro is about to prosecute his father on a highly dubious charge, but a religious one involving manslaughter (Xi&amp; qovoi) to be heard before the Archon Basileus. Since Euthyphro is a self- professed expert in things religious, Socrates suddenly has the brilliant (but ironic) idea of placing himself in Euthyphro's hands for religious instruction, so that he can defend his case against Meletus by appealing to the religious authority of Euthyphro, his teacher (5a2-8). I can say to Meletus, Socrates hypothesizes, that either he must acquit me if he holds my teacher's religious views to be correct, or he must prosecute my teacher, not myself, as being responsible for the undoing of elderly gentlemen (5a9-b7). Euthyphro retorts to the suggestion that Meletus might try to prosecute him on a religious charge: "By Zeus, Socrates, if he were merely to attempt to prosecute me, I'm pretty sure I'd discover his weak spot, and he would far sooner be the subject of discussion in the courtroom than I" (5b9-c2). In view of this piece of dialogue it seems impossible to me that Socrates wishes to place himself in the hands of a "sectary of some kind", someone as likely to incur judicial odium for his new-fangled religious ideas as Socrates himself. There is a deeper level to the irony of the situation as well. Socrates is to be charged with upsetting the religious order. Euthyphro, a man pushing religious dogma (as expressed in the Hesiodic canon) to the point where he repels Athenian public opinion, expresses astonishment when he hears of the charge of corrupting the youth of Athens which Meletus has accused Socrates of. "It seems to me he's striking at the very foundation of the City in trying to prosecute you," says Euthyphro (3a6-7). Then Socrates mentions the second charge of inventing new gods: "I suppose he's referring to the 8a&amp;pvtov you say keeps appearing to you," Euthyphro says indulgently. "He's concocted this charge of being an innovator in the religious field ... because he knows charges like that can easily be made to stick among the general public (EWis 8Lr EvA8l(o4XQ r&amp; -Tolaira rrpo 'ros sfoXXois). Why, even I myself (xaci &amp;poiv yap roL) receive jeers of laughter in the Assembly when I predict the future on the basis of divine signs ... People simply do resent everyone like us (&amp;XX' 8PS qovovofV IAiV ITf&amp;OL 'rots TooirOlms)". Euthyphro recognizes Socrates for the deeply religious man that he is, and considers the charge of impiety one to be openly challenged (&amp;XX' 6P6Ce LivaL, 3c5). Parallel to the tactic Plato employs throughout the Apology of showing Socrates' deep loyalty to Apollo, Plato here is using Euthyphro as a means of securing a vote of 'not guilty' on the charge of impiety, at least from the reader of the dialogue, if not from the jurymen at the actual trial. It is part of the apologetic tendency of the Euthyphro, reinforced in the course of the dialogue by the dawning realization that Socrates is a more profound thinker on the subject of piety than even the epitome of the holy man, Euthyphro.-8 This apologetic thrust of the contrast between the two figures of Socrates and Euthyphro is lost if we take Euthyphro's last quoted words literally, with Burnet, 18 cf. W. A. Heidel, On Plato's Euthyphro, TAPA 31, 1900, p. 166. 204</page><page sequence="5">and imagine that they are both religious eccentrics of one sort or the other, both equally vulnerable to the charge of XaELVO-T%oLV ipi nrv &amp;ewv. For the drama (and pathos) to work, Euthyphro must be a high-priest of the conventional dogma, against which Socrates is allegedly sinning.19 His affection and respect for Socrates underline the hollowness of the charge trumped up by Meletus. Why then, ask Burnet and Taylor, did Euthyphro know nothing of the charge against Socrates if he was a pillar of the orthodox establishment? First, Plato goes out of his way to emphasize the obscurity of the man bringing the charge, and the fact that Euthyphro is not personally acquainted with him (2b7-cl). Second, the charge is at the preliminary stage of the npOxXiaIs before the Archon Basileus, and might therefore still be anything but common knowledge in Athens. Third, Euthyphro, a high-priest of the Homeric and Hesiodic orthodoxy, needs to be unaware of the charges against Socrates for the dramatic irony which Plato uses to structure the dialogue. A conversation between Socrates and a fellow-conspirator of Meletus' might make for a heated duel of wits, but hardly for the gentle, even humorous, way Socrates' insights into the holy are made to seem vastly superior to Euthyphro's. We can also sift Euthyphro's responses to Socrates for doctrines central to, or alien to, orthodox Athenian belief. If we have sufficiently ruled out the possibility that Euthyphro's taking Zeus' lead in prosecuting his father marks him as a "sectary of some kind", what of the other positive doctrines produced by Euthyphro in the course of the dialogue? First, there is the question of the ritual pollution attached to manslaughter. As Burnet says, manslaughter for the Greeks was a religious offence, one involving a &gt;;wsFa to the person of the miscreant and his family, as well as an &amp;&amp;xov against the family of the victim, provided that the killing could be shown to be ovx iv &amp;x9l0 Because of the ritual pollution involved, the offence was one against piety, and therefore to be heard before the Archon Basileus.2' When Euthyphro relates to Socrates the nature of the charge he is bringing against his father, and Socrates asks whether the victim was also a relation (for otherwise, it is implied, Euthyphro's action would hardly be justified), it is precisely the question of the pollution in- volved in associating with a killer that Euthyphro states as his reason for prosecut- ing: "It is ridiculous, Socrates, that you think it makes any difference whether the dead man was a member of the family or not, and not that the only thing one ought to scrutinize carefully is whether the offence was justif ied or not, and ifjustified,that one ought to acquit the defendant, and if not, have him brought to justice, parti- 19 R. E. Allen, Plato's Euthyphro and the Earlier Theory of Forms, New York, London 1970, p. 8-9, calls'this "a third common misinterpretation". Whilst I agree with him that Euthyphro was not representative of the average Athenian, but was a religious pedant (see below note 27), I cannot agree that the Euthyphro was not intended by Plato partly as an apology for Socrates' religious views. Is the harping on Apollo in the Apology not apologetic in this way? And likewise the references to Socrates' piety in the Phaedo? Allen writes as if there was nothing to defend Socrates against! 20 Burnet 1924, p. 3. See especially R. Parker, Miasma, Pollution and Purification in early Greek religion, Oxford, 1983, p. 104-143, on the pollution attached to the killer, and ibid, p. 370-392 on the ritual purification of killers in myth and actual fact. 21 cf. Aristotle, Athenian Const. 57, 2. 205</page><page sequence="6">cularly if the defendant shares your hearth and table with you: for an equal degree of ritual pollution is attached if you associate with a person like that, fully aware of his crime, and do not purge both yourself and him by bringing him to justice" (4b7-c2). It is exactly the danger of becoming contaminated by another's blood guilt which underlies an Athenian myth told about one of their mo6t popular festivals, the Anthesteria: the custom of drinking from individual flasks at the festival of Cups (XOES), derived from when Orestes fled from Mycenae to Athens after killing his mother Clytemnestra.22 To avoid the danger of all the celebrants becoming contaminated by Orestes being 6prp&amp;'neios with them, it was decided to celebrate without any intermingling of the wine among the celebrants. Numerous other myths tell of the ritual purification which must follow blood- guilt: Apollo's cathartic pilgrimage to Tempe after slaying Python;23 Hercules' purification before he could be admitted to the company of Fvoacm at Eleusis:24 Euthyphro's action, in putting his ritual duty before the ties of kinship to his father, once more marks him as a rigid adherent to traditional mores, rather than someone coining new beliefs and practices. It should perhaps be added that the commen- tators are probably right who say that Euthyphro was doubtless counting on the acquittal of his father in court; he had done his duty, both to his father and himself, by placing the responsibility for cleansing any possible blood-guilt in the hands of the court.25 The second major religious tenet adduced by Euthyphro on being pressed by Socrates to improve his definition of piety, is likewise typical of conventional thinking based on epic tradition. Socrates elicits from Euthyphro (after much fruitless discussion) the opinion that holiness (-rb Brov) is that part of the larger concept of justice (rb 8xawov), which concems the tendance of the gods (TO mepi iv Trv &amp;Qv &amp;pava'v 12e6-7). Socrates asks: I don't quite understand what you mean by OEpafrrea; surely you don't mean the sort of tendance a herdsman gives his herd, in order that the animals are benefited? Euthyphro agrees immediately that men 22 Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 960 (...'S ~sit yevovTo oCpustV 6pu)01fov8o &amp;'EXrOV'; v 'ripc.p . ). Also schol. Aristoph.

Socrates points out that most people employed in the service of an overlord help their superiors to achieve some worthwhile goal. What is the goal in the case of men, gods and religion (E'L Til ?lPOs ALOS TL 'noTr aiCLV iXbEV0 TO '&amp;yxaXov Epyov 8 oiL @Oi atEp-y&amp;xoVrrtv p'rats xpt&gt;pvoL; 13e 0-I l). Euthyphro takes a deep breath, saying that it is no easy matter to sum up such a matter in a few words, before proposing: "Nevertheless I can tell you this much, that if someone knows how to render what is pleasing to the gods, both in prayer and at sacrifice, then this is the holy, and this sort of behaviour protects both private families and the community affairs of the city-states." (14b1 -5). This statement reads almost like a prose synopsis of Phoenix' words to Achilles in the Iliad: .U. . pTT'roi be E xaiL &amp;Eoi avXToi, ?G)v srp xa;X ?LEitwV &amp;pET1 Tlt1 TE Oiil TE. xcxa gLE V TOVS VihECECUL XO(L EUVXWXnS &amp;y-YOW1L XoLI3 TE XViGT It'Txpxr(c1(,' &amp;VO)pWYTOL WolwBn~ TE xvanT?apaTpwa'MC pO XLo6OLEVOL, OTE X?V TLS UvITp Eppfnl XvL a&amp;appT- (9, 497-501) "Even the gods themselves can be swayed, whose power and majesty and strength is of course greater. And men influence them in prayer with incense and reverend vows, and the smoke from sacrificial animal fat, whenever someone has erred and gone astray." A comparison with this passage shows that Euthyphro reproduces all the salient points: (1) the service of the gods consists of two activities, saying the right things (prayer) and doing the right things (offering sacrifice); (2) the purpose of offering up to the gods is to protect oneself (Euthyphro: TomvLaU Ga(EL TOUS 7? tLOVS O';XOVS Xai T&amp; XOLVX T&amp;AV iT6XEwV. Homer: Tovs . . . iTapaorpwirC' &amp;VOPOLrrO, O6T XECV TLS . . . &amp;x&amp;p7,). It should be further observed that Euthyphro's point about religion protecting private homes as well as the community affairs of state shows his concern to coincide exactly with the domain of the Athenian state religion (domestic and public religious observances).26 The best summary of what Socrates' encounter with Euthyphro entails can be given by means of analyzing Socrates' parting words: "What a thing you are doing to me, my friend! Your departure is a real blow to the great hope I had of being acquitted of the charge Meletus has brought against me by learning from you what holiness and its opposite are; I thought I would be able to demonstrate to him that I had already learnt about religion from Euthyphro and that I no longer improvise and invent new forms for it through ignorance, and that I would spend the rest of my life in the most respectable way possible." (I5e5-16a3) The points that emerge (through the teasing irony) are: 1) the dialogue is seen as directly relevant to the charge Socrates will have to face in the Apology. Socrates' encounter with Euthyphro is a preview of the battle which 26 One may compare Xenophon's defence of Socrates against the charge of impiety: 153cv 'rE yap qY&amp; vrpOEPS V ToXX&amp; I ?v olxo, rroXX&amp;xs be xa;i 1'r xowS o rfis s6Xews j3wpZv (Mem. Al, 2). That Xenophon had the Euthyphro in front of him when he wrote this part of the Memorabilia is a surmise prompted by many coincidences in the thought-structure relative to piety/impiety. 207</page><page sequence="8">will be enacted between Socrates' private religion and Athenian orthodoxy at the actual trial. 2) Socrates believes that gaining access to Euthyphro's religious wisdom will enable him to achieve respectability in the eyes of Meletus and the court. This belief (however ironically stated, for of course Socrates never intended altering his position one bit, unless forced to by a superior intellectual argument, which he never felt would be forthcoming from Euthyphro), is incompatible with Euthyphro's stat is as a "sectary of some kind". 3) He likewise believes that, upon being enlightened by Euthyphro, he will no longer have to avroaxte&amp;aELv and xawvo?T%iv about religion. In other words, assimilation with Euthyphro's doctrines will have re-aligned him with "established" ways of thinking. If, as I believe, we should return to the pre-Burnet position of seeing in Euthyphro a stickler for adherence to received tradition, we have both a meaningful foil to the originality and perceptiveness of Socrates, and an interesting witness in him to the existence of highly dogmatic religious thinkers in Athens at the tum of the fourth century B.C., who lived and taught as if no intellectual water had flowed under the bridge since Homer and Hesiod.27 Seminarfiar Klassische Philologie der Universitdt Heidelberg 27 R. E. Allen's (1970 p. 9-12) position tallies with this, I am glad to say ("Euthyphro stands to Homer and Hesiod in much the way that a modern Fundamentalist stands to Holy Writ; his beliefs, extreme as they are, have their proof texts; but the texts, treated with great literalness, are selectively chosen"), but his exposition on "The Euthyphro and Greek Religon" skates over the surface in other respects. 208</page></plain_text>
