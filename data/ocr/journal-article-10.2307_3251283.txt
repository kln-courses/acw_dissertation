<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Along the Watchtower"- Cultural Studies and the Ghost of Theory i? Tom Cohen "There must be some kinda way outta here," said the Joker to the Thief. Jimi Hendrix The profile of "cultural studies" today cannot be assessed outside of a view to its own genealogy within recent critical history-for it will be found, on inspection, to occur over a series of faults. The first, in the American context, would be its role as inheritor of a series of historical, often left-inspired critical projects (new historicism, iden- tity politics in all variations) which brilliantly superseded the lan- guage-centered critique of deconstruction in the 80's attending the call for a "return to history"; a second fault might attend the manner in which it appeared institutionalized in ways that have mutated away from its elusive initial impetus to intervene in the historical itself. Having busily abjected "theory," why is cultural studies berated today by more orthodox left observers as itself too literary, as a failed political enterprise? Could an array of projects have found themselves re-inscribed in a familiar epistemological model going back to academic historicist trends? There is, perhaps, a problem in the direction criticism has taken in its "post-theory" careers-that is, following in the 80's the cavalcade of projects spanning identity politics, new historicism, and post-colonial critique which have, in some respects, melded into the absorbing cover offered by cultural criticism and cultural studies. For one thing, MLN 112 (1997): 400-430 ? 1997 by TheJohns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M LN a drive to press academic and popular culture into a political and emancipatory posture has witnessed the opposite effect-a decided drift to the right both within the academy and without. One cannot help but wonder if the abjection of what was called "theory" in the 80's did not take place in too hasty, ritualistic, or misleading a mode, as if something was missed in the supposed "return" to the political and historical all along. At all events, the manner in which we have been presented with a progressive narrative leading from that phase has not played out as expected: despite the dominance of an all- absorbing cultural studies trajectory, presenting itself as a kind of "end" of critical history, it may be that this narrative is neither linear nor progressive, and that a good many folds or regressions have been involved to date. One thinks, say, of the proclaimed return to the agency of the subject, to a context-driven historicism not very different from seemingly older models (if dramatized inversely, as if from subaltern positions), of the return of discourses of "identity," and so on. Yet the array of subjectivities has had something spectral about it, like a parade of the undead, as if the return to everydayness, experience, the body, the "political," the pragmatic-everything supposed other to "theory" (had that term ever occupied a binary)- nonetheless echoed a precritical or phenomenological program. If so, one of the blind spots of "cultural studies"-aside from its being utilized, we might say, by a set of institutions to occlude a "theoretical" project that may, in the end, have been on the verge of disassembling a traditional representational economy-may be the manner in which it substituted new objects (pop culture, gender issues) for traditional ones without altering the preceding representational model, or for that matter, epistemology. Language receded as an issue; the political was thought to have been restituted, but in a manner programmed still by the institutions that were initially to have been transformed. This brings us perhaps to a another fault-line, that lying within cultural studies as we (and who does this not touch?) practice or identify with it today. Here it is again useful to sketch a mock genealogy-particularly if we plan to return to one issue that seemed suppressed from the opening under the name of "theory": the problem of what must conditionally be called a linguistic materi- ality the agency of which contests historicist narratives, anthropo- centrisms, and a mimeticism that had seemed, from the first, associ- ated with metaphysics itself. For one thing, what we call "cultural studies" not only seems embraced institutionally but seems to mark a return to descriptive 401</page><page sequence="3">TOM COHEN premises that reinforce representational ideologies which "theory" had intricately (which is to say, practically) jeopardized. That is to say, that by absorbing all practices of critical intervention it also replicates that supposed form of post-modern late capitalism that equalizes all differential vectors by accommodating each-turning them into "studies." To some degree, the embrace of "cultural studies" by the academy entails the archivization, no longer of the past icons, but of a certain "present": given the roots of its contextualism in new historicism-and the way, today, that "new historicism" appears a Reaganite phenomenon, a return to referentialism through the establishment of reserves-we might speak, here, of a historicism of the present. However we today understand historicism, or mimeticism, or the regressive features of certain styles of humanism (most notably, the equation of meaning with property, say, but also the anthropo- centrism rooted in anthropological tropes that its "studies" restitute), it works to defer a more problematic yet inescapable encounter. Has the eudaimonist archivism of cultural studies, begun as a project of political change, in fact served to enforce an "older" signifying order and hence politics of knowledge-objects? What if the older epistemol- ogy we accuse cultural studies of returning to never existed "as such," was itself, all along, a canonical hermeneutic mode of defending against and (dis) appropriating historical events-events that occur or are known on the level of inscription-by reasserting models of interiority, meaning, or reference where these had been disinvested or exceeded? If theory is associated with death (among else, its own), and cultural studies with life as it is lived, it is the category of "life" within this field of writing that becomes suspicious. The possibility of addressing three moments of "cultural studies" in the American scene-what we have called an initial move to imple- ment "theoretical" projects in practical terms, as though followed by the institutionalization of cultural studies in a return to representa- tional ideology, and a cultural studies to come that may, precisely, neither be mimetic nor explicitly humanist-draws attention to other cracks in the narrative. If the initial turn as if "outward," away from a specific notion of textualism, intended to translate some epistemo- logical reconfigurations of post-structuralist thought into political terms (Said's selective use of Foucault, the interface of certain feminisms and post-colonial techniques with deconstruction, and so on), it seemed side-tracked when institutionalized by a more conven- tional attempt to legitimize a literary studies (or "humanities") embar- rassed as to its relevance by appeal to sociology as such. Having 402</page><page sequence="4">M LN endured the balancing act of deconstructive suspensions, this critical current raced back toward the promise of concrete reference-an urge one can be in total sympathy with. And yet, if it is true that global and academic politics are indeed more conservative than even in the recent past, and that we are now in the era of "cultural studies," we might ask whether there is not a sort of political imaginary of cultural studies-the elaboration of an archive that, in effect, upheld a kind of mimetic humanist program it could not intervene in since it involved a form of regression. Interestingly, a "second" phase of cultural studies ensued-though the chronologics may well be shuffled. Here, the turn toward descriptive and sociological matter was accompanied by the conjuring of inverse "origins," a seeking of legitimacy in retro- genealogies-leading back to Habermasian communication, Bour- dieu's contextual historicizations, and of course, the "Birmingham School." The invocation of the "Birmingham school," which may have little to do with American cultural studies ultimately, suggests a ritual turn to an Anglo-centered "genealogy"-as pragmatism does also- that sheds not only the onus of continental dialectics or "the French," but sees itself as a recovery of self. When later, "cultural studies" is opportunistically allied with Habermas' Enlightenment project-not to mention the sociological imaginary-it will have identified further with traditional hermeneutics.1 If this "second" moment of cultural studies voided the transformative ambitions of its initial leap in favor of a political imaginary that, descriptive, sought the legitimization of mimeticism and the sociological imperative, we may inquire after a "third" phase that has been implied, yet left virtual, on this game board-a cultural studies to come. This was that already promised in the first moment of cultural studies as a transformation of the mimetological model itself, and in this schema it might take the form of an anti-mimetic politics that is also a politics of memory, a mnemotechnic responsive to the materiality of inscription. Such a cultural studies to come (it will have other names) pursues the promise of a specific transformation (implied in the "first" phase), yet does so by looping, first, through a problematic that had been occluded, massively, in the Certainly American "cultural studies" ritually returns in its British namesake to an Anglo paternity by which alien, dialectical, or francophone influences might be purged: though, at the same time, it can be said to have had little originally in common with what was, arguably, a minor pedagogic program with specific social aims in Britain. Stuart Hall, among the offerings collected in Cultural Studies, eds. L. Grossberg, C. Nelson, and P. Treichler, New York 1992, expresses consternation and non-recognition of the "institutionalization" American cultural studies had taken (285). 403</page><page sequence="5">TOM COHEN announced death of a "theory" thought to have been, simply, gone beyond. We may begin to ask if what was abjected with theory can be called, with hindsight, not a too abstruse, too "theoretical" discourse, but access to a what has been gestured toward as a material effect of language that had begun to arrest the underlying anthropomorphism of the hermeneutic-referential model? How would "theory" be identified, in this socio-political grid, with a kind of historical material- ity, while the pragmatics associated with cultural studies, here, ap- pears idealist, retro-humanist, depoliticized?2 Keeping what one may call the contemporary aporia of cultural studies in mind (its being so wedged in mimetic premises that its epistemo-political value is suspect) one may be reminded, here, of the way Adorno read or misread Benjamin when sent a piece of his "Arcades" project. He took the latter for a type of descriptive poetics: The 'mediation' which I miss, and find obscured by materialistic-historio- graphic invocation, is nothing other than the theory which your study omits.... If one wished to put it drastically, one could say that your study is located at the crossroads of magic and positivism. That spot is bewitched. Only theory could break the spell....3 If we take this site as a double one-in Adorno's reading, in Benjamin's dissimulative text-the "spell" expands, doubling errati- cally. To be effective, to break this style's specular spell, to get away from the mimetic blind of a pretense to the sociological as such, to become political (again), material (in fact), requires a (re)turn to what had, ostensibly, been effaced. What is called for has itself a loaded name: theory. And if what seems meant is Benjamin's own "theory," our inability still to make aspects of his so-called allegorical project out-and Adorno's own dismissive rejoinder about "invo- cation (s)"-reminds us that what is gathered, still, under this word is a question of material events. Benjamin, according to Adorno's specular but luminous scan, is to give up his "materialistic-historio- graphic invocation," which only simulates a certain Marxist cant, and return to "theory"-if only to get back to a different materiality which that "invocation" summoned but, in naming, obscured. That "spot" 2 For Benjamin's performative development of "materialistic historiography" ("the exact point where historical materialism cuts through historicism" [255]) see, of course, "Theses on the Philosophy of History" in Walter Benjamin, Illuminations, New York 1968, pp. 253-64 (hereafter III.), (Illuminationen, Frankfurt 1961, pp. 251-61).

"Magic," because it presupposes transformation for the asking; "posi- tivism," because it relies on a descriptive address. What shape would a cultural studies take that, as a writing project, could break into a different, allomimetic epistemo-critical order? Adorno singles out for complaint what he terms the latter's "materialistic-historiographic invocation"-Benjamin's transposed and altered term whose mock-Marxian echoes frustrate and irritate Adorno. (There is, indeed, a trace of pique, as though Adorno sensed the parodic emptying of more traditional dialectics such an act would imply.) Adorno becomes, in the course of this letter, nonetheless more drawn or intrigued by what may lie behind the inflection that the invocation of "materiality" takes on, invoking Nietzsche in the process: God knows, there is only one truth, and if your intelligence lays hold of this one truth in categories which on the basis of your idea of materialism may seem apocryphal to you, you will capture more of this one truth than if you use intellectual tools whose movements your hand resists at every turn. After all, there is more about this truth in Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals than in Bukharin's ABC of Communism.4 In fact, the "materialistic-historiographic invocation" that irks, and then attracts, Adorno at this spot emerges most pivotally, perhaps, in the Theses on the Philosophy of History, where it names a kind of program (even if it is, precisely, anti-programmatic) for what might be called intervention in, or the reconfiguration of, the historical. And while amply "theoretical," it must be said that this program is unnervingly pragmatic in its way-involving, as it does, what might be weakly called a model of disinscription and reinscription of and within memory, the shape or definition of "history" as such. It is a model easy to parrot or parody but difficult to identify. "Materialistic," here, does not refer to any familiar redaction of the term-not, that is, the hyle of philosophy, nor any base in Marxian dialectic. It seems to imply a conjunction of inscription and a politics of memory, the manner in which future presents are programmed by different ways that the past ("the dead") is managed, produced, relayed, occluded. In the narrative 4 Aesthetics and Politics, p. 132. 405</page><page sequence="7">TOM COHEN of our own critical present, a privileged example of such occlusion might be, conveniently, the trauma for received models of reading presented by "theory." One among other examples of this could be the way a figure like de Man-and specifically his late work in which, too, the term "materiality" comes to dominate-appeared variously bracketed, encrypted, or erased in a "return" we may now see as less to history than (not so new) historicism.5 Here we recall that, in the case of Benjamin, historicism is hardly a casual term. In the Theses it occupies a singular place-one that, if given its full metaphoric resonance, unsettles some of the more familiar categories in criti- cism. It is, of course, interesting that in this text which we associate with the time of Benjamin's flight and suicide, where he identifies the "enemy (Feind)" as fascism, there is little overt reference to Hitler or Nazism. That would have been easy enough, and certainly given immediate pathos to the text-but it is absent. Instead, the "enemy" is repeatedly identified as an epistemo-political style, with what is simply named historicism as such. One need only compare the image of the jackbooted nazi to your everyday new or old historicist-in my experience, often left-leaning if a bit passive aggressive, hardly "fascist"-to appreciate the scandal of this text. Nonetheless, Ben- jamin is insistent, since what is called "historicism" takes on the sense more generally of an installed mimetological order, a blind or totally compromised model of reference and narration out of which anteriority itself is emptied, managed on behalf of a reactive mecha- nism. If at the time of the Theses, Benjamin faced a perceived foreclosure of history by the onslaught of Euro-fascism, itself allied to a historicism of the past, what do we make of the horizonless model, today, at a time of generally liberal studies and the accommodation of seemingly new archives, of a historicism of the present-horizonless, 5What we will imply by "historicism" leads beyond any technical definition of the term to encompass a series of symptomatics that return to the epistemological programming to which it points. In Benjamin's use "historicism" undergoes a certain general translation and programmatization, to encompass an over-reaching narrative, referential, and interpretive itinerary. Nonetheless, the emergence of an American redaction of "cultural studies" directly out of new historicism cannot be overlooked, nor the tepid prescriptions offered for what, minimally, the term implies. See Patrick Braitlinger, for instance, in Crusoe's Footprints, New York 1990, where we are reminded that cultural studies "begins with the realization that reading the isolated 'classics' or 'great book' is not possible without also reading the larger 'cultural text' into which it fits" (22), a prescription usually adapted, as in new historicism, to a bottom's up political agenda (cited in Stanley Fish, Professional Correctness: Literary Studies and Political Change, New York 1995, p. 78). 406</page><page sequence="8">M LN without other, and unable to die? Specifically, if we use this text as a node of reference (for it is not the authority of it or one interpreta- tion that we invoke), are "we" in that other future which would have been saved from the historical impasse of which Euro-fascism was a marker-or might we be more politically compromised in some general sense for having extended a historicism of the past to a historicism of the present? Is this "present" threatened by a still greater epistemo-critical foreclosure than the time of the Theses? At issue, then, is not only a potential blindness that adheres to the political imaginary of cultural studies-a mimetic b(l)ind, we might say, that trusts to and is re-inscribed in an aesthetico-political model that something we associate with "theory" labored to break with.6 It is not accidental that one of the ideological gestures inherent in cultural studies (or, more obviously, its American pragmatist wing) is the bracketing of what it calls epistemology or "theory" or philoso- phy-as though the latter could be ejected in a safe return to the practical and political.7 What if, today, just this gesture-which, we know, encompasses to some degree the "literary" and, at times, reading itself-were not only inscribed in a mimeto-humanist model, but a clear idealism or idealization to begin with? One, that is, whose anthropomorphism and pan-mimeticism is designed to elude the entire question of the material (to cite Benjamin) that conceives of the historical in relation to the non-human. If the issue of a certain allohuman, allomimetic materiality resur- faces here, it is only to remind us that any provisional history of the critical present would not, again, be a linear or progressive one-but a matter of folds, backloops, arrestations, blinds, and regressions like any other. The role of figuration and what precedes it, which is related to the site Adorno called "theory," returns. In Benjamin's ' By mimesis we do not mean so much the double sense opened in Plato-that, on the one hand, of poetic imitation (and a certain third person narration) and, as if inversely, the installation of a representational concept of language (paradoxically, perhaps, in the figure of the eidos, which may be otherwise read as the phenomenalization of an inscription, or the cancellation of figure itself, even a "primal letter" as remarked in the Theaetetus). Rather, we use the term in such a way as to flatten and combine both, converted into what may be an installed regime of interpretation more generally-and what, invariably, legislates an assumed model of reference. This model, typically, trusts in a descriptive rhetoric that actively effaces the event of prephenomenal inscription. Thus historicism too can be heard not as a nineteenth-century historical practice but an entire epistemo-critical (and mimetic) disposition toward archives of narratable reference. 7 This is the primary thesis of Cornel West's The American Evasion of Philosophy: A Genealogy of Pragmatism, Madison 1989, on behalf of multiculturalist politics. 407</page><page sequence="9">TOM COHEN case, we look for this trace first in that most seemingly literary of topoi, allegory, a term or word (if it is one) with a strangely bewitched history of its own-one, moreover, so saturated with the appurte- nances of traditional literary history that in both Benjamin's radical dislocation of it and, later, in de Man's continuation, one may point to a failure of the strategy and reliance on the term itself. Like other critical projects that bear an abruptly transitional and transcriptive import (Bakhtin, say, not to mention Derrida), there occurs a lin- guistic engineering, a voiding of received semantic import, or what is more openly called a translation-effect in such "words" themselves. Something like what Benjamin interrogates as translation occurs in many received concepts he will redeploy (allegory, natural history, translation itself, cinema, materialism)-that is, where exposure to the sheer exteriority of "pure language," the formal networking of material differences, empties interiorist and binarized fields of mean- ing or aura. (For Benjamin, translation passes through a moment of reine Sprache, "pure language," to be heard not as the fullness of meaning inherent to speech as such, but as the irruptive play of prefigural or material differences common to all linguistic struc- tures-a kind of aural or visual differencing, we might say, possible to conceive as a knocking, or a series of bars precedent to any possible perception.8 Reine Sprache, we hear, rather than being a reserve of "meaning," empties out meanings-understood as the anamorphic and ideological refuse of past hermeneutic pockets. It transposes texts first into trace-systems in which what had been "meanings" are transvalued according to differential signifying orders. If we hear in the image of rhythm (which always implies a-rhythm) a kind of knocking commonly said to accompany a seance-the registering, as if from beneath the table, of the presence of an outside, the material other of others, where the dead are brought to table with the so- called living, in order to re-decide alternate possible pasts and futures-we better grasp how for Benjamin's "materialistic historiog- raphy," historicist chains and mimetic interpretation must be semiotically disrupted. Translation, transvaluation, passes through a pre-mimetic and "materialistic" moment that, by invoking the past in transposed form-in, and through, the sheer anteriority of reine 8 See "The Task of the Translator," in Walter Benjamin, Ill., pp. 69-83. This knocking or bar-series, in fact, is Hitchcock's usual way of marking this semiotic base or materiality-not unconnected, in Hitchcock, with "mother." That is, through aura knocking and variations on the bar-series (/ / / /) that network his texts and plots. 408</page><page sequence="10">M LN Sprache-involves a seancing of the virtual. Not as a suspension of reference or meaning alone, but as the supercession of an older humanist and mimetic programming of these same terms which would be requisite to bringing affairs to the point of any decision.) In the Trauerspiel we witness how allegory is reprogrammed to anticipate what will, in the Theses, finally take the unexpected name of "materi- alistic historiography"-that is, of a mode of intervention, a political and historical mnemotechnics. It seems to do so first by a reflexive inversion, whereby the traditional concept of "allegory" (a text bearing an idealized signified) is converted into reflexively address- ing its own site of production or consumption-but it goes beyond this move. We may, in tracking how this term is gambled, look back again to a subtext of the Trauerspiel that has routinely been underread, one in which the very category of the "aesthetic" too is rewritten. The relation of the Trauerspiel to Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, whose supposed embrace of "aesthetic" agency the former is commonly thought to reject and distance itself from,9 may be reconsidered. We might find that rather than reversing Nietzsche's conception of the aesthetic, it offers-only to then efface or forget-the most accurate reading of the import of that dissimulative work available. Suffice it to indicate the direction of this reading, keeping in mind that for Benjamin an entire series of terms will be altered-among them allegory and translation, but also cinema-that appear, traditionally and at first, to be guardians of high mimeticism (traditional allegory would resolve itself in transcendental meaning, translation would be judged by its fidelity to the original, cinema would reproduce the image of the real, and so on). These terms in fact are adjusted or "translated" themselves to actively deface the mimetic order of reference, reproduction, and origination. One must be wary, then, in understanding too quickly what a so-called "modernist" redaction of allegory entails-as if Benjamin's shift were accounted for somehow, 9 This hypothesis contests as misleading the commonplace that Benjamin's Trauerspiel constitutes an "inversion of Nietzsche" (see Rainer Nagele, "The Poetic Ground Laid Bare (Benjamin reading Baudelaire)," diacritics 22, 3-4 (Fall-Winter, 1992), p. 48). Gary Shapiro, in "Hashish Passages: Benjamin's Labyrinth" (unpublished), recently suggests that the " Trauerspiel book must be understood as an anti-Birth of Tragedy," which would be true only in so far as the Birth of Tragedy must be itself understood that way (that is, as an entirely other text than the canonical-hermeneutic reading takes it to be). Where Nietzsche seems to place the "aesthetic" before the human agent, Benjamin protests- in one of criticism's most vertiginous performances-that "all sane reflection is at an end" (Origin 103), and in that gesture appears inscribed in this counter-model, even programmed by it. 409</page><page sequence="11">TOM COHEN as Jameson suggests recently in writing on film,'0 by the reflexive ability of the modernist text to account for its own conditions of production (or consumption). If such reflexivity, broadly under- stood, is one moment of the "allegorical" text, the gesture as here described still remains mimetic, representing, say, supposed conditions of production. Allegory can be said to emerge rather as one of the names ("translation" is another) that theorizes and practices a "materialist" mnemotechnics, a performative reconfiguration of cul- tural imprinting, at points of intervention Benjamin will elsewhere use figures like constellation and monad to name-radically singular sites on what may be termed the mnemonic switchboard, topoi and atopoi of virtual events at which, through a suspension of historicizing trace-chains in a caesura-like effect allied to what is occasionally termed "shock" (associated, in turn, with a suspension of the ideology of experience, the rendering exterior of all interiorist imaginaries), the possibility of alternative pasts and alternative, virtual futures can be adduced, opened, gambled." The term "allegory," here, functions inversely as a kind of pragmatic or techne for historical disinscription and, potentially, re-inscription, and not, that is, description. What occurs in the site which allegory names takes the "reflexivity" mislead- ingly attributed to an aestheticized modernist moment and alters, "negates," re-programs it mnemonically, as we hear: "(Allegory) means precisely the non-existence of what it (re)presents" (Und zwar bedeutet es genau das Nichtsein dessen, was es vorstellt).l1 There is a potential shift, immediately folded into the textual movement, from one signifying order into another model of reference-and, with it, occurrence, the event, chronographics.13 For if so-called modernist 10 See, first of all, Jameson review of William Rothman's The Murderous Gaze, "Allegorizing Hitchcock," in Signatures of the Vi.sib, New York 1992, pp. 99-127.

It is the corollary of a "materialistic" agenda if we associate the material now with that prefigural order-of the trace, mnemonic vectors, anteriority-out of which representational logics will appear programmed. The effaced "relation" of the Trauerspiel to a particular (perhaps still virtual) reading of the Birth of Tragedy is worth probing-one that does more than note the too obvious citation and disfiguration (a sort of decitation) operating between Geburt and Ursprung, Trag6die and Trauerspiel. For the relation, if it is one, begins to unravel not only what happens to the definition of the aesthetic here (which, unex- pectedly, will return us to the abjection of "theory" and the literary by cultural studies), but why the term allegory seems instantly overbur- dened in Benjamin, wounded and semi-retired after this text in his writing-compelled, as a program, to haunt and inhabit a series of alternate terms. What the Birth provides, too bluntly, is a dissimulative model in which historical narration appears first of all indexed by the unfolding of a linguistic or rhetorical model-that story which Nietzsche provides, using the representational and performative site of Greek theater when moving as if from dithyramb and lyric to chorus, dialogue and dialectic, passing into the rationality of Socratism, and so on. On the one hand-and Benjamin appears, simultaneously, to recoil from and totally imbibe its implications-what seems set up is the epistemo-linguistic programming of historical "experience," what Benjamin will elsewhere come to imply as the "sensorium" itself. It is a site where perception appears conflated with the aesthetic, implied now as the phenomenalization (one thinks of Nietzsche's jubilating satyrs, but the model segues to cinema easily) of forms of inscription. What is called the aesthetic in Nietzsche-such as in the famous statement: "it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence 14 Ursprung thus becomes the site in a performative genealogy of a critical or historical juncture in which the prospect of re-inscription presents itself as virtual. This concept is developed and elaborated in Samuel Weber, "Genealogy of Modernity: History, Myth and Allegory in Benjamin's Origin of the German Mourning Play," MLN, 106 (Spring, 1991), pp. 465-500. 411</page><page sequence="13">TOM COHEN and the world are eternally justified (gerechtfertigt)" (a strange word, suggesting as it does an ethics of the aesthetic, of the material in this sense)-must be heard through the Greek aisthanumai, for percep- tion, as implying the sheer exteriority or materiality of any cultural order whose consciousness-effects will be narrated as the transforma- tion of theatrical and linguistic forms. It seems critical, then, to ask what is intended by Musik in Nietzsche's text, what serves at the trope of origin (and, perhaps, what Benjamin might imprint as a kind of re- inscribable Ursprung). Without opening up this scene, we may return to why it can be said that Benjamin's trope of allegory seems inversely predicted by a "reading" of Nietzsche which it strives to efface-one that in ways stands against still canonical modes of interpreting Nietzsche's early work. One trauma that inhabits the Trauerspiel might be termed its performative apprehension, in regard to the event-text it would rewrite (but instead repeats more sharply, then effaces its own reading of), of that Musik which, in a way, it will in part rename "rhythm." Not music itself, but what Nietzsche calls in his title its spirit or Geist, a certain essence or spectral reading of music. Invoking art and the senses, the ear, it is also a gateway to the prefigural-the site where an iconic interiority is resolved into a scene of marking, a sheer formalism. In Nietzsche's work there is a split between the way this seems presented and performed. In the first case, most familiarly, that appears in the mode of a mock-dialectic between the two figures, Dionysus and Apollo, in which, despite counter-indications, the first will appear associated with the primacy of music and the pre- representational, and Apollo with a kind of secondary formalization (and mimeticism). According to the familiar coding, Dionysus, despite his disruptive force, is reinscribed as a trope for inwardness, while Apollo, secondary, appears the god of a marked formalization, and Musik, as though the ultimate icon of inwardness or will, is associated with the first. This arrangement is classical enough, but conceals a rupture and reversal in the story-telling, a moment where Musik emerges briefly in association with a moment that precedes the "Dionysian" as such (which then appears a sort of primary revision, effaced in turn), where a mode of ur-Musik is marked (then dis- missed) as Apollonian, as mere form, as (a)rhythm. It occurs in section two and concerns the term rhythm: If music, as it would seem, had been known previously as an Apollonian art, it was so, strictly speaking, only as the wave beat of rhythm, whose formative power was developed for the representation of Apollonian 412</page><page sequence="14">M LN states.... The very element which forms the essence of Dionysian music (and hence of music in general) is carefully excluded as un-Apollonian- namely, the emotional power of the tone, the uniform flow of the melody, and the utterly incomparable world of harmony.15 This "careful" exclusion or incision leaves a scar-in the text, and in the tradition. More than a scar, a fold that has mobilized and instituted defensive counter readings and occlusions. What is cov- ered, however, is not a semantic content, but a dismembering formalism that precedes "the essence of Dionysian music (and hence music in general)": it is an un-musical music, the Geist of music perhaps, reaching into an un-genealogy of the genealogy that erupts and is effaced at once, momentarily allying the effect of music not with harmony or melody, not with Schopenhauer, but with a kind of metronomics, measure, formalization, spacing, alternation, marking- effect. I will hazard that this effect colludes with what Benjamin will have already, and problematically, marked in Die Aufgabe des Ubersetzers as "pure language"-an exterior exchange-site of linguistic and prefigural difference, purely formalized and actively void of interior- ity (unlike the facade of Dionysus).16 This pre-Dionysian effect against which "Dionysus" himself is staged should perhaps not be dissociated from what will translate in Benjamin the "materialistic" itself. That is, a prefigural eruption in and of mimetic and narrative trace-chains that organize a historical scene or experiential model. This buckle or (a)topos is registered differently as "shock" or "caesura," void of representational claims yet proto-linguistic, destructively evocative of the proto-muse Mnemosyne, out of which the "aesthetic" emerges as a certain material or semiotic effect instantly and retroactively programmed as perception-what, like the "sensorium," may be understood as an installed program of interpretation.'7 This detour brings us closer to the enigma of a 15 Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy, trans. W. Kaufmann, NewYork 1967, p. 40. '6 It is interesting that, in order to mount a related reading, de Man would have to invoke Nietzsche's notes taken from outside of the Birth of Tragedy-whereas precisely such an "Apollonian" occasion is clearly present (if bracketed) in the text. A blindness to this counter-moment extends, in this case, not only to canonical readings that aestheticize the text itself but to their strategic undoings. See Paul de Man, "Genesis and Genealogy (Nietzsche), in Allegories of Reading, New Haven 1979, pp. 79-102. On the other hand, it is precisely this "logic" that will be associated with "Dionysus" in Nietzsche's later works. 17 In fact, the precise reading of the Apollonian in Nietzsche that I have sketched- what remains a dangerously accurate, and still forbidden understanding of that text, it seems-leaves a trace in a note of the Arcades project, in "Konvolut N": "every 413</page><page sequence="15">TOM COHEN critical agenda that has been submerged, in some respects, during the pan-mimetic cycle of historicist and "culturalist" criticism. The abjection of this path has involved political decisions-among other things, the very definition of the political, agency, and the human; meaning, "history," and the social.18 From a certain vantage point, it can be argued that if "cultural studies" presents itself, today, as if at the end of critical history, an alluvial plain capable of accommodating any variation on pop cultural or identity-centered critiques-and if it has done so by a return not so much to "history" as techniques of historicism, the agency of the subject, and a potentially regressive pan-mimeticism as such-then a pyrrhic riddle attends this conquest. One would have to note here two ancillary effects of this mode-first, that the assimilation of every other critical style afield resembles little so much as the "late capitalism" it partially intended to confound; and second, that (for a while) the pretext of cultural study not only represents the raising of an iconic "otherness" to the status of object of consumption, but that the market-value of such, and pop cultural images, ends by being cultivated for a marked commodity value (one may consult the recent fortunes of Routledge, to some degree, on this calculation). If cultural studies has no apparent horizons and, unlike previous critical trends-deconstructionism, various feminisms, new historicism-seems without end, unable to die, this lack of mortality is bound to the possibility that, in another sense, it has never yet quite existed as such. And yet what, after all, is a "present" that is defined by the historicization of itself, an auto-archivization, if not an (absented) historical state of affairs presented dialectically polarizes and becomes a force field in which the conflict between fore- and after-history plays itself out. It becomes that field as it is penetrated by actuality. And thus historical evidence always polarizes into fore- and after-history in a new way, never in the same way. And it does so beyond itself, within actuality per se; as a length divided according to the Apollonian measure experiences its division beyond itself." See "N (Re the Theory of Knowledge, Theory of Progress)," in Gary Smith, ed. Benjamin: Philosophy, Aesthetics, History, Chicago 1989, p. 60. The Apollonian figure of measure, here linked to rhythm and a "division beyond itself," networks with the concept of caesura that defines, for Benjamin, the so-called "dialectical image," or for that matter translation ("This image is the caesura of the movement of thought" [67]). For a consideration of how the word Massen operates in Benjamin-which might lead to a correlation between the trope of the "masses" and the formal effect of rhythm or measure-see Samuel Weber, Mass Mediauras: Form Technics Media, ed. A. Cholodenko, Stanford 1996, pp. 100-105. "8Judith Butler, in Bodies That Matter, New York 1993, seeks to re-establish the problem of "materiality" in a double relation to the metaphorics of inscription and the body, in which the later serves, nonetheless, as a constitutive site.

The ghost of something that never quite existed or arrived, horizonless, does it feed nonethe- less off a future it stands to foreclose? Moreover, as a virtual historicism of the present that would be practical, on the side of life, it yet can appear to fetishize and archive the corpse of that "present," to partake of a sort of web-spinning which, while wanting to install new referents and rules of image-commerce, not only defers to some future transformation of the entire cultural order any activation of such a memory-grid to come but guarantees that deferral. Yet what Benjamin's Theses seems to tell us is that it is, first of all, between alternate epistemo-political models of reference and reading that any real terrestrial and historical politics or wars stand to be played out. "Terrestrial," since no politics today, certainly in the mock post- specular era following the collapse of the cold war, can be called such that does not rethink such topoi as the non-human: that is, also, materiality. The project impending in Benjamin's text involves, we might argue, alternative conceptions of temporality and agency, a politics of memory and inscription that precedes and exceeds the mimetic management of semantic reserves. Returning to our opening "genealogy," we might better see what original errors, misreadings, or intentional foreclosures seem embed- ded at this site. Strangely, what will be called "materialistic historiog- raphy" in Benjamin's text is only the last of a series of inadequate terms used to cover the project of historical intervention-which can only be possible by altering the very epistemo-critical system out of which the past itself is managed, futures produced, reserves con- sumed (what, for Benjamin as for Nietzsche, will link the idea of a materiality of inscription to that of "earth"). The open if dissymmetrical series includes "shock," translation, sometimes cinema-the apparatus that, projecting the sensorium from inscriptions, simulates mne- monic reproduction while disrupting historical continuity-and, again, allegory. We can note where a mimetic blind prevents the logic of the term from being read as a precursor of "materialistic historiogra- phy"-where, now, "material" is heard not as mimetic or referential (the hule of philosophy, the "base" of a Marxian dialectic), but as the prefigural knocking or differencing that reine Sprache seeks to name, precedent to any "site" of inscription. Even in Benjamin, after the Trauerspiel, the term allegory seems shifted, put more in the background 415</page><page sequence="17">TOM COHEN and altered, in some ways unable to bear the weight it was given: that is, as a reflexive intervention in the mimetic machinery of historicism, an altering of the real by a disruptive (re)initializing and (dis)- installation of the mnemonic hard disk. As, that is, a practice- proleptic, contractual, hypothetical, dependent on the context of anticipated chains of readings. For if "classical" allegory can be called the very model of mimesis (the representation of a transcendental meaning by an absolvable signifier), so called "modernist" allegory would again not only mark the work's purportedly reflexive account- ing for its own mode of production. Such a model is still mimetic, even if it complicates its signifieds. Benjamin's "allegory" goes a step further: it does not re-present but actively dislocates, disfigures, alters, or negates. It alters or negates the very site of what it had, reflexively, configured as a mode of (its own) production-it alters anteriority itself by the impact of material signs upon signs, potentially deleting its own present or memory in the process (or, as in Benjamin, the viability of the term allegory). If this praxis of seancing called "materialistic historiography" had a name today, when that of allegory is eviscerated as a carrier, it might be allography: a premimetic locating of the otherness of inscription that opens-by invoking the premimetic site of material differencing-the possibility of disinscription and reinscription. This Benjamin projects not in grand terms, but in minute circumstance, in those signifying nodes and mnemonic relays he calls "monads," upon which entire "constellations" of historical representation hinge. It may be that de Man, whom we most associate with an abjected or dead "theory" today, may have been most precise in just this: devising technologies required for the intervention in such mnemonic nodes or "monads," out of which alternative trajectories stand to be optioned. It is here that the act of occlusion more or less attending the return to the historicizing and contextual models of cultural studies re- emerges-that is, in the conceit of "theory" more or less as sum- moned by Adorno above. By "theory" we might unacceptably general- ize, now, and say the figure of materiality, which emerges in Benjamin in relation to a program of intervention we might too simply label a mnemotechnic. It is here that the name de Man resurfaces poten- tially as an icon and resource. As an "icon," since the question arises as to what was associated with the name (made a moniker for a certain agenda of "theory") that required it to be bracketed, ex- cluded, in the rise of cultural studies. The answer could not rely alone on the familiar strategies for caricaturing this work-that de Man's 416</page><page sequence="18">M LN concern with "literariness" reinscribed him in a surpassed model of new criticism or a textualism that was "nihilistic" and ahistorical, or that the presumptive "scandal" of his war-timejournalism disqualified and tout court foreclosed his project. It is not accidental, here, that the pro-active model of "allegory" as a mnemotechnic associated with Benjamin is potentially extended, on a necessarily micro-technical level of reading, in de Man's work, or that the figure of materiality emerges distinctly in his last essays-precisely those whose import seems to have been pre-empted by shifts in tastes and idioms neither entirely wholesome (as one might think of a return-but from where?-to the body, to context, to identity, to history as being) nor innocent. It would seem that many vectors congeal at this site, between the death of a "theory" that seems not to go away for all that, and a horizonless and undead cultural studies that, nonetheless, has per- haps not yet existed. Specifically, at the contemporary stylistic and political impasse ("bewitched spot") that adheres to the mimetic model of cultural studies-the reinscription in historicist models of causal agency, linearity, an iconography of context, self and so on- together with any re-reading, today, of the occlusion of "theory." For while we associate cultural studies with the death of theory (as is often remarked) it remains to consider what "death" entails here, or whether a more powerful role must precisely be allotted to the dead-not to mention that anything occluded or encrypted with the violence that "theory" has been suggests, as well, a constitutive crypt that will, of course, (already have) return(ed). In this sense, of course, no signature has been deemed more synonymous for this death of theory today-so-called literary theory, in ways even the "literary"-than that of de Man. Yet the fact that the latter's oft noted interface with Benjamin seems at once so elusive and so precise (the topoi of allegory, materiality, the aesthetic, the war against mimetic hermeneutics and historicism are all variously extended by de Man) may make this a useful counter-spot to return to for a moment.19 How does the topos of "materiality" that is so insistent in late de Man '9 That the relation of de Man to Benjamin has been taken as a routine assumption does not mean it has been calibrated in effective ways. A recent collection addressing itself to history, Walter Benjamin and the Demands of History, ed. Michael P. Steinberg, Ithaca 1996, is introduced with-and against-a certain notion of this link in mind ("the pairing produces intricate problems" [5]). This link is not really defined in the "Introduction," before it is quickly turned from with a certain coding of de Man's Le Soir episode as focal point ("Does de Man exorcise Le Soirby seeing through Benjamin's 417</page><page sequence="19">TOM COHEN operate, and that specifically with reference to the prefigural order of inscription and the event? How might we see it continue or prosecute Benjamin's trajectory on a mnemotechnic level? Today, from the perspective of a cultural studies to come-that is, one perhaps predicated on a mnemonics of inscription rather that of mimetic- phenomenological description-it may not be evident what use de Man might be. Submitting to the category of "use" (which logic might require a lengthy excavation itself) could itself be a useful exercise, here, if only to bracket various ideological investments de Man's name solicits (what, bound as signature to a certain "materiality," we may have reason to review in itself). We may take the newly published late essays of de Man as an appropriate enough occasion to re- consider this issue. Generally, these papers seem to articulate in ways not elsewhere available what collectively might almost be seen as a sort of "program." What is interesting is the degree to which the treatment of materiality-which recalls the use of this term in Ben- jamin, what Adorno calls Benjamin's "materialistic-historiographic" invo- cations-supersedes some of the characterizations of de Man that still linger: that of a figure associated with the literariness of the text; a practitioner of a close reading that recurred to new criticism; the strategist of tropological displacement or "nihilistic" aporias, and so on. What emerges more clearly in the "late" essays, rather than the associations usually spawned by the term aporia (or impasse), may be a figure seeking an active intervention in a historical model, to project-and this recurs to the Nietzschean-Benjaminian project- the passage from an already spectral, non-existent, but institutionally installed interpretive or signifying order (in)to an other notion of praxis allied to an other (and, perhaps, finally "older" still) epistemo- political model of reading, materiality and anteriority.20 eyes, thereby acquiring a certain moral subjectivity and authority?" [6]). In fact, that this link is not established or explored widely to date may perhaps reflect less on a blockage, severe, in the digestion of de Man's emergent project than a desire to preserve a certain iconization of Benjamin-and is attested to by the mentioning of de Man, for all that, only once in all of the succeeding essays. It may be, that is, that this interface-de Man/Benjamin-has been another "given" that has been publicly tagged in order to archive or occlude it. 20 Benjamin's Passagen is routinely translated as "Arcades," and has proven an evocative image for a virtual project, yet the term also, clearly, echoes an association with textual passages and the figure of passage, poretics itself: the implication of a site of translation, transport, within a mnemotechnic cultural text is lost with the mimetic translation of "Arcades." This problematic arises elsewhere, as in his commentary on Baudelaire's passante in "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" (Ill. 155-200). 418</page><page sequence="20">M LN It is not arbitrary that while a covert Auseinandersetzung with Benjamin can be marked throughout these last essays-the recur- rence to allegory in Baudelaire,21 a movement as if beyond the aura, or anthropomorphism, or "mourning," the thinking of materiality, uses of the term "shock"-it is Benjamin's essay on translation that de Man singles out for his sole commentary. We might note that if "allegory" becomes to some extent bracketed and transposed into other figures in Benjamin, in de Man it is pursued, pressed to the limit and gambled on-to the point where it will no longer function usefully, only to be revived even there.22 What happens to the term "allegory," it seems, is another example of what Benjamin will imply by translation-where a received term, taken over from a past constellation (allegory as a mimetic trope of signification), is emptied out of its "meaning" in the process of remarking its own material signifying practice ("to turn the symbolizing into the symbolized"),23 which transformation or translation in turn it proceeds to assume as an always future and always already past point of crossing. What does translation entail, here, or rather what kind of passage does it envision for itself in de Man, if what is further involved appears to be a movement as if toward a prefigural, material domain of history ("the passage from trope, which is a cognitive model, to the performative" [AI 132])? How can one "move" toward the prefigural, and this in a way called "irreversible," both in reading itself and across nodal texts whose materiality are in question ("That process ... is irreversible" [AI 133])? We can keep this question in mind if we are to ask how a certain de Man can be said to present a program for intervention in the (cultural) construction of mnemonic and hermeneutic grids. If when in contact with the hypothesis of "pure language" the translator- reader is placed in touch with a virtual system at once before and 21 Samuel Weber observes in Mass Mediauras, in a footnote to commentary on de Man's "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," "a silent, implicit dialogue with Benjamin's reading of Baudelaire" (104). 22 In "Pascal's Allegory of Persuasion" we read: "To say then, as we are actually saying, that allegory (as sequential narration) is the trope of irony (as the one is the trope of zero) is to say something that is true enough but not intelligible, which also implies that it cannot be put to work as a device of textual analysis" (AI 61). 23 See "The Task of the Translator," in Ill., p. 80. For a pivotal exploration of how such a principle of reine Sprache may be conceived to operate within Benjamin's text, see Werner Hamacher, "The word Wolke-if it is one," in Benjamin's Ground: New Readings of Walter Benjamin, ed. Rainer Nagele, Detroit 1988, pp. 147-76. 419</page><page sequence="21">TOM COHEN beyond trope ("In this pure language ... all information, all sense, and all intention finally encounter a stratum in which they are destined to be extinguished"),24 de Man proceeds to address the more technical problem of intervening in the mnemonic economy by way of what Benjamin termed a monad. That is, the (only) site where disinscription and reinscription can be attempted, the node or trace- chain crystallized as a point of entry to and alteration of a cross- historical switchboard, itself radically singular at every potential site: "Where thinking suddenly stops in a configuration pregnant with tensions, it gives that configuration a shock, by which it crystallizes into a monad. A historical materialist approaches a historical subject only where he encounters it as a monad" (Ill. 262-63). The monad appears like a situated non-word out of which diverse referential orders are culturally deployed, or deposed.25 For the de Man of Aesthetic Ideology, we might say, the engagement of such "monads" as are clustered about Kant and Hegel solicits terms like the "aesthetic" or materiality. This parallels the account of how "events" associated with such names routinely generate an inversely hermeneutic or canonical interpretation to that which a more material reading of their texts might disclose ("taken to state the reverse of what it states").26 The persistent logic of this counter-formation is important, 24 "'Conclusions': Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator,"' in Resistance to Theory, Minneapolis 1986, p. 80. 25 For a discussion of the concept of "natural history" in Benjamin which positions the concept of a non-human history, see Beatrice Hanssen, "Philosophy at Its Origin: Walter Benjamin's Prologue to the Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels," in MLN, 110 (Spring 1995), pp. 809-33. Commenting on Benjamin's figure of translation, Hanssen notes that Benjamin's concept of pre-linguistic materiality-through which a Nietzschean topos of transvaluation now appears to pass-involves a "non-human, non-humanistic history," that is renamed "natural history in the prologue to The Origin of German Tragic Drama" (817). Hanssen elsewhere differentiates Benjamin's concept of Ursprung as an attempt to "move beyond the theory of the eternal return, which he regarded to be the manifestation of a mythical power of history" (823). But one could counter that this is only a particular interpretation or "mythical rigidity" of this trope-rather on the order of his dismissal of Nietzsche's "aesthetic" prioritization. In fact, the return of a materialistic-aesthetic premise in the Trauerspiel-like the alliance between Apollonian Musik and reine Sprache technically-predicts where, by the time of Thesis XII, Benjamin will be citing Nietzsche's "Use and Abuse of History" as a cipher of "materialistic historiography," a return to the early Nietzsche. Hanssen similarly reads Benjamin's "erkenntniskritisch" prologue as, literally, a "radical repudiation of epistemol- ogy" (820) in the mode of a philosophy of consciousness, which, while true enough, does not account for a reverse inscription, through the prioritization of language, where a different "epistemo-critical" model returns (as can be said, too, of The Birth of Tragedy). 26 Paul de Man, Aesthetic Ideology, ed.

(Hereafter AI.) 420</page><page sequence="22">M LN since the detour or parenthesis in which the pan-mimeticism of cultural studies by and large must be located can be said to involve a bracketing evasion of the historical itself. The model for this opera- tion can be retrieved somewhat from the essay "Kant and Schiller," where these two positions function in part as broader ciphers (indeed, in ways they might read, "Theory" and "Cultural Studies"). One should add, at once, that what authorizes the rereading of such texts is entirely consistent across de Man: one must locate how the materiality of language is addressed by or encrypted in the textual system, a point of reference that functions the way "pure language" does for Benjamin's translator, as a prefigural facticity from which no effort at signification escapes. Yet the point of identifying an institu- tional or hermeneutic foreclosure precisely of what a Hegel or a Kant, as exemplary "event," can be said to have stated-as, according to de Man, the entire manner in which Romanticism is understood as an interiorist project and historical "era," together with the very import of the Enlightenment, is evaded, suppressed, simply bracketed- returns to the resonances of what once bore the name of "ideology" ("Schiller appears as the ideology of Kant's critical philosophy" [AI 147]). If the return of (the second) cultural studies to mimetic humanism and an "older" epistemo-critical model involved a retreat from the specifically transitional (and material, it would seem) aspects of "theory," this dilemma appears the focus of de Man's late work: how to exceed the anthropomorphic model in order to access a material domain of history, a site of (dis)inscription, out of which the politics of memory (or "man") appears programmed?27 We come back to the ersatz paradox, mentioned above, by which something like a cultural studies political imaginary, while aiming at an emancipatory politics, can collude with a conservative swing on a national political and academic level. It would appear at present that any battle for a future politics and a politics of the future will occur not between an encoded left and right configuration, but between alternative herme- neutic and signifying orders, problems of translation and disinstalla- tion, that precede the various objects (or "studies") we group together under a more or less archival logic. In "Kant and Schiller," de Man asserts that the rhetorization of the 27 Much as part of the import of Derrida's Specters of Marx entailed suggesting that the true heirs of Marx's attempt to think historical intervention lay, today, with others than official Marxists, so de Man appears, in his last essays, to usurp the prerogatives of those oriented with regard to the event. 421</page><page sequence="23">TOM COHEN material in Kant's text must be understood as an (always virtual) event on the level of history-"a movement ... which is to some extent an occurrence, which has the materiality of something that actually occurs" (132)-and that it is effaced in the humanistic interpretative apparatus installed by Schiller from which, thereafter, the more familiar profiles of "Kant" as such were to be taken. The intervention named Schiller, representative of a vast network of representational and aesthetic presuppositions designed to invert and humanize the materialistic consequences of Kant's radical formalism, more or less is said to frame the entire tradition of reception as "a regression from the event, from the materiality of the inscribed signifier in Kant"-"in the whole reception of Kant from then until now, nothing has happened, only regression" (134). For de Man, the site of the aesthetic has a more than oblique relation to what Benjamin will hypothesize as a "sensorium," in which perception (like "experi- ence") is cast as both interpretively and historically programmed, and radically exteriorized. What is called perception will appear differ- ently structured and linguistically (or even (ana)grammatically) legislated by such turns or decisions, both historically and in ways inversely derived from the site where the "aesthetic" appears to occur through the phenomenalization of material semiosis. This means that the manner in which understanding is traditionally archived not only entails an original inversion (defacing the materiality of the event) but continues to codify mimetic or referential information that derealizes-and conceals, protects along with the ideological defor- mation itself-the domain of inscription one nonetheless, at all times, operates in programmatic if not antithetical reference to. For de Man, however, opening this site to inspection involves a violence not without punitive consequences, particularly where what appears involved entails the formal emptying out (or "translation") of any interiorist model of meaning, or of the "human." This is not unrelated, perhaps, to the entire narrative of de Man's abjection- which repeats, in ways, a very old turn, though one may say it functions in this case as fully anticipated. According to de Man, our culture only tolerates the "Schillerian" reading of Kant, shying collectively from much of the import and consequences of Kant's materialism. Not only are we all "Schillerian," but "if you ever try to do something in the other direction and you touch on it you'll see what will happen to you" (AI 142). Indeed. Rather than being, as he has been caricatured, a proponent of working inside texts rather than in the outside world, the domain of 422</page><page sequence="24">M LN mimetic actuality, de Man locates a radical exteriority at the site of memory, a mnemotechnic (or historiographics) at times referred to through the term inscription which, in advance of every hermeneutic system, marks the inevitable materiality and exteriority accorded the human apparatus-that is, the usual figural suspects whose concep- tualization rests upon promoting interiorizing models: perception, experience, history, identity, the social.28 For de Man, there seem to be two distinct senses in which movement, or transformation can be cited, both of which are fairly traditional. It involves only a move toward assuming the implications of such materiality in the "human," rather than effacing it with the array of defensive, privileging, politically suspect (for Benjamin, "fascist") gestures that unwittingly aestheticize this terrain-therefore, at the same time, may also not involve an explicit movement as such. A first use by de Man of the word transformation would be bracketed, ineffectual, transformative only within a closed specular order. It is that of a "tropological system," say, which "totalizes itself as a series of transformations" (132)-that is, networks of tropes whose ability to accommodate substitution and reversal would appear structural. Then, following and breaking with that (but not in narrative fashion, since it has, recall, already occurred in advance of the installation of "tropological systems") is a second use, we might say, where "you pass from that conception of language to another conception of language in which language is no longer cognitive but in which language is performative" (132; de Man's italics). In performative, of course, echoes both of acting and action are intended. This passage or "direction"-from the entire model that encompasses mimetic humanism, historicism, the "magic and positivism" of "cultural studies" as such-is nonetheless said to be irreversible once initiated, one cannot return from it, partly because the "first" site never really existed as other than an installed cultural reaction-formation: "That process. . . is irreversible. That goes in that direction and you cannot get back from the one to the other" (133). The figure of passage is impossible to decode in progressive, temporal terms. Rather than the de Man we may associ- ate somewhat facilely with the term aporia, then, we encounter one for whom the aporia is itself a kind of techne of passage, a(n(a) )poretics. 28 In "Sign and Symbol in Hegel's Aesthetics," for instance, this exteriority is associated with mnemonic inscription itself: "In order to have memory one has to be able to forget remembrance and reach the machinelike exteriority, the outward turn, which is retained in the German word for learning by heart, aus-wendig lernen" (AI 102). 423</page><page sequence="25">TOM COHEN His project appears more in contact with a tele-mnemotechnics that seems already coming into place in a clearly post-humanist popular culture. For de Man, for whom the trope of cancer had some resonance, it is interesting that the move as though back to a tropological model of representation-phenomenological, experien- tial-from this other site, what is accomplished supposedly under the name "Schiller," is called a relapse rather than mere reversal ("the recuperation, the relapse, has to be distinguished from a reversal"). The historical seems configured with reference to "events" from which the relapse represents a regressive detour away from the domain of history-in part since its narrative, decisions, and experi- ence will appear more or less programmed.29 Indeed, what Schiller's recuperation represents operates repeatedly on the tropological model of mere "chiasmic crossing" (135)-what, precisely, deters or defers the other crossingfrom a tropological model (of language) to a prefigural one. De Man finds in the pairing of Schiller and Kant another mock opposition, not only that between an interiorizing and a materialist model, but that as if of the practical and theoretical divide with which our own discussion opened. Like the "return to history" or pragmatism out of which cultural studies was to issue- which involved a determined abjection of a literary, or philosophical, or epistemo-linguistic "theory" as aestheticizing operations-there occurs here a predictable inversion. A "relapse" is anything but harmless, and may be deadly, terminal even: after all, it restitutes a humanist and aesthetic model that can appear to (re)institute not a humane but (what Benjamin calls) a "fascistic" order-not by sympa- thy, not even obviously, but by an epistemo-political bias programmed into assumptions about reference, context, history, ethics.30 Cultural studies, today, bears some traces of such a "relapse." Thus we might ask where this "second" cultural studies has reason to recalibrate its political premises-that is, its overt reinscription in a mimetic and historicist epistemology that has always, potentially, been an institu- tional form of anteriority-management and deferral. It might dis- cover that any break with the anthropocentrism (and auto-referen- tiality) of a certain foreclosure of the historical itself accesses the 2" It would be possible to think of de Man's enterprise, here, as a proactive attempt at a way of an interventionary approach to what Althusser names the non-historical domain of "ideology." See Louis Althusser, "Ideology and Ideological State Appara- tuses," in Lenin and Philosophy, trans. B. Brewster, New York 1971, p. 169. 30 At the end of "Kant and Schiller," de Man connects the Schillerian program to a justification of the "aesthetic" state witnessed in Goebbels' novel, Michael (AI 155). 424</page><page sequence="26">M LN traces of a "materiality" that opens different configurations of inter- vention, or configuring alternative pasts that make possible alternate futures to those passively inscribed in received narratives. Like American neo-pragmatism that supposes itself to turn from "theory" to practice by restituting the trope of self and identity, we are told that Schiller's great "realism," over against Kant, involves an apparent blind, a mimetic blind: "this apparent realism, this apparent practical- ity, this concern with the practical, will result in a total loss of contact with reality, in a total idealism" (142). Indeed, if this is so, this spot remains bewitched. It is not accidental that the very project that thinks of itself as exceeding the humanist fold of traditional academic archivism-with all the policing authority that has had epistemologi- cally-should be that entrusted, today, with the former's most success- ful extension, re-installation, and return. It is not accidental that the code which gave us "theory" (as idealist) versus cultural studies (as practical) can not only be inverted in this sense, but that this inversion is fraught with cultural and political consequences of an entirely determining order. If a specific use of de Man may appear today as a cipher for what has become of "theory" in the time of cultural study, rather than retreat as an icon for a sort of hypertextual enclosure we may choose to ask where his text pragmatically presses the allegorical-that is to say, translational and transvaluative-project of Benjamin to a sort of micro-mnemonic precision? If "materialistic historiography" opens how to proceed in the access of shock attending the rewiring of monads in the mnemonic grid, de Man in one possible reading divulges the near banal specificity of this form of intervention. Accordingly, we may now be in a different position to assess less public forces at issue in this abjection. It reminds us that, once again, the movement from literary "theory" to the mimetic politics of cultural studies was not in all ways a linear narrative, but involved folds, regressions, occlusions, relapse, and that, in the face of this, one may predict a reconnoitering to come between the political imaginary of cultural studies and the problems of materiality, inscrip- tion, the rewiring of a certain cultural or representation mnemonics in general. The clarification and resituating of the "aesthetic" as such, rather than being another arcane preoccupation of theoretical ecumenicism, designates one conceptual key through which a shift in the signifying order (and referential model) would secure itself from relapse. Indeed, one may argue that the mimeticism which under- writes "cultural studies" (if such exists) involves not a turn "outside" 425</page><page sequence="27">TOM COHEN from an imaginary interior but precisely the opposite, an unwitting strategy for the retention of interiorist economies of identity, causa- tion, agency-indeed, humanist and historicist logics that have al- ready made themselves felt in the lack of opposition with which "cultural studies" has been embraced by the academy. If Benjamin appears to have been interested not in any return to history as narrative but in intervention, the same must be said of de Man-as occluded icon, in the genealogy of the critical "present," for "dead theory." In the latter's case, this devolved to the issue of a certain materiality of the aesthetic which, itself prefigural, positions some writing practices to intervene in the production of alternate (mate- rial) signifying constellations. Like the priority of Apollonian formal- ism in the secret non-history of Musik that Nietzsche offers, the materiality of inscription in de Man attempts to access a radical exteriority, a knocking from without, that divests any model of anthropomorphic aura in the most matter of fact, banal, and poten- tially undramatic way. It is not accidental that Benjamin, when returning to the figure of "allegory" and Baudelaire in Zentralpark (both repeating and inverting his analysis of the baroque), does so in relation to the figure of the labyrinth:3' that is to say, to the hypothesis of an altered memory grid constructed from the debris and by- products of the allegorical or allographical shock.32 In the context of the "Kant and Schiller" essay, two versions of this aesthetic are again marked: "This transcendence of the aesthetic in Schiller differs entirely from the disruption of the aesthetic as return to the material- ity of the inscription, to the letter, that we found in Kant" (146). It is the "idealism" of Schiller, presented as evading materiality, that would be countered by what is nonetheless a kind of return to that which, in a sense, one never left but only bracketed, mystified, converted, humanized. But the "human" is precisely what is at issue in the pragmatic or materialistic opening of Benjamin, or here de Man, which stands to be recalibrated in relation to a non-human some- 3' The great exception to bringing up "allegory" again is around the figure of Baudelaire, and this to sheer excess, in Zentralpark (Ill. 230-50), which one might describe as a hyperbolization or allegorization of "allegory" itself-a near implosion. The figure of the labyrinth in this text testifies to the emergence of a new mnemonic grid tied to commodities: "Das Labyrinth ist der richtige Weg fiur den, der noch immerfriih genug am Ziel ankommt. Dieses Ziel ist der Markt" (236); then: "Doa Labyrinth ist die Heimat des Zigernden" (238). 2 I have tried to develop these problems in Ideology and Inscription: Cultural Studies After Benjamin, de Man, and Bakhtin, Cambridge 1997. 426</page><page sequence="28">M LN times accessed through the trope of language or a "concept" of history which, in the latter's text, is not only not narrative or mimetic, but not even temporal. One may assert, however, that it is precisely the technical side of this exteriority-where the phenomenalization of the aesthetic derives from mnemonic inscription, from which the category of the public or the social itself appears linguistically programmed-that proffers what cultural studies or historicist criti- cism cannot: the highly political implications of intervention within the representational system (and its ordering of cause, time, nomina- tion). When de Man turns, repeatedly, to the prefigural "trope" of prosopopeia, he is less fetishizing the trick of lyric personification than returning to a site from which the represented or historical real is still virtual-that is, open to reconfiguration. The anti-trope of the "monad"-and with it, the implication of a cross-historical switch- board by which intervention, re-wiring of the signifying and mne- monic matrix may be broached-repositions "materialistic historiog- raphy" as a non-humanist, translational politics of (dis)inscription. It is interesting, perhaps, that in the public trajectory of cultural studies a marked turn to science as trope and topos, has become paradigmatic. This is, no doubt, an exhilarating and potent field for a redetermination of perspectives, yet one cannot be blind to the repeated gesture witnessed above, by which a specifically "literary" activity rewritten as humanist would be superseded (in conjunction with a diversely framed emancipatory politics) by a systemics that proffers the aura of the objective, the referentially "real" (the alternative movement to a return to phenomenological tropes in the icon of the body). Often the most technophilic rhetoric-not exclud- ing Haraway's trope of cyborgs, or Andrew Ross' "techno-culture" marketing-conceals less an encounter with a material or even the dreamt of metallic other, than yet another repositioning of a human- ist interior and archive.33 Any materiality associated with inscription, on the contrary, would be indistinguishable from that of the trace of anteriority itself, and being allohuman and non-mimetic, it endeavors to network the slippage of the contemporary historicist projects to what one might be tempted to relate to the effect called "earth." It is 33 See, for instance, Technoculture, eds. Constance Penley and A. Ross, Minneapolis 1991, and, differently, Andrew Ross, The Chicago Gangster Theory of Life-Nature's Debt to Society, New York 1994, where the humanism of emancipatory politics is opposed to the discourse of material limits in eco-politics, returning, in the process, to a virtual rightist rhetoric. 427</page><page sequence="29">TOM COHEN not accidental if Benjamin, beginning his final thesis, invokes the "history of organic life on earth" to reduce and explode a nineteenth- century anthropocentric concept of history, recalling of "the paltry fifty millennia of homo sapiens" that "the history of civilized mankind would fill one-fifth of the last second of the last hour" (Ill. 263). Yet this placement of "man" or consciousness in relation to a material trace that is not distinguished from that of organic "life"-which too, like the Dionysian, articulates itself according to semiotic logics- clears the space for new chronotechnologies. No doubt, if there is to be intervention in the prescribed or received narrative logics defining the human project on earth (dare we risk such a banal and affected yet inescapable formulation, apparent in Benjamin's example?), it will have to access other logics, other temporalities and other, proac- tive forms of mimesis than those which-imbricated in the logics of deferment and reserve familiar in mimeto-capitalism-continue to program a cancellation of reserves to come, from bio-diversity to cultural identity. Instead of the trope of science, then, Benjamin seems to proffer in "materialistic historiography" something along the model of the seance-a coming to table of past and future trace- chains, an invocation of the dead to option and recast or gamble the possibility of future trajectories, broken with the empty, homogenous time of the (auto-reflexive) humanistic archive. One would have not only to ask why, before any seancing which lays the groundwork for an active mnemotechnic (the inverse reading of "magic and positivism"), there must always be in attendance a knocking-not so much from "outside," as beneath the table itself, an outside already without location that for the moment summons materi- ality in the form of a prefigural semiosis, sheer form, sheerly exterior, pre-mimetic, without content, Apollonian-Dionysian, yet capable of rendering received narratives again virtual. Rather than leaving a humanistic study of literature in its wake, destined to be assigned the role of guardian over the foreclosure of the age of the book, an uncanny topos of literariness presents itself in relation to this seancing, this knocking, whether in the form of Apollonian rhythm, "pure language," the materiality of inscription, or other "names" we make no effort to summon at this time. Rather than cultural studies being the advance guard of a new cross-cultural techno-conscious- ness, it appears to have slipped on this path, and proffers more often a retro-humanism and interiorist model unable to break with the epistemo-critical order that this relapse seems recast in. In any of these scenarios, what seems apparent is that the story of 428</page><page sequence="30">M LN cultural studies' rise and theory's death remains politically encoded and crevassed with unexamined folds and reversals. Any inspection of this spot today (assuming it is time to re-open this crypt)34 might begin by asking what place an already dead theory has at table with the reverse ghost of a yet non-existent cultural studies. It would seem the renown "nihilism" that certain supposedly pragmatist schools at- tribute to the word theory is entirely perspectival or even specular. For seancing "theory" reminds us that neither death nor occlusion amount to erasure. Moreover, as a potential archivism or historicism of the present, the "life" of cultural studies may be, to a certain degree, phantasmal, a matter of inversely borrowed time, rather than the arrival of a kind of end of critical history. As a promised program of historical intervention, "cultural studies" does not yet exist. The histrionic pitting of a putatively dead "theory" against a not-yet- existent "cultural studies," however, risks losing in the kicked up dust of a staged and misleading agon the possible futures that this lack of closure-lack even, to date, of (a) history-forcibly leaves ajar. We can relinquish some of the iconic services provided by address- ing the texts of de Man or even Benjamin-who function in measure as ciphers. What lingers may be Adorno's use of the word "cross- roads." What might also be recalled is that the "history" we have tried to return to may never have been where it was sought (that is, not in nineteenth-century eschatological models)-any more than, given the appallingly slight 3000 years or less human communities have even tried to track that in writing, "we" yet know what that means. To remark this is not to call for a "return to theory" from what has proven to be a return less to history than to historicism. It is to say that the return to a linguistic materiality, sometimes associated with the term "theory," may be required, as Adorno implies, to break the spell of the mimetic blind which the latter today enforces: to return, not to a past moment, but to that cultural studies to come that was promised, precisely, from the first. As the mode of the seance suggests, with this a potential redefinition of the human and non- human, the living and dead, agency, succession, and the epistemo- critical is presupposed. As such, we may see the epoch of "cultural studies" itself not merely as mortal-it has proven powerful as a real institution, despite (or because of?) its non-existence-but an open 34 For a critical collection exploring implications for cultural analysis of "materiality" in de Man's late essays, see Material Events, eds.

This can be inspected in the relation between a cultural studies that cannot die because it does not yet exist and a "dead" theory that, deflected, still names an inescapable rendez-vous.
