<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE 'LOST CITY' OF KOTA GELANGGI: AN EXPLORATORY ESSAY BASED ON TEXTUAL EVIDENCE AND AN EXCURSION INTO 'AERIAL ARCHAEOLOGY' by RAIMY CHÉ-ROSS 'But while these monumental structures of spectaculation rise magnificently above the ground, the ancient kingdoms themselves remain undisturbed below.' Stewart Wavell, The Naga King's Daughter 1 Introduction2 Archaeological remains throughout the Lembah Bujang in Kedah are traditionally associ- ated with the legendary Raja Bersiong from the Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa. Old graves and fortifications along the Johor River are linked to the exploits of the heroic Badang mentioned in the Sejarah Melayu. Unusual geological formations in Kelantan and Sarawak are likewise ascribed to the deeds of Puteri Sa'adong and Puteri Santubong respectively. As with folklore elsewhere, the links between fact and fiction in these tales are tenuous at best. Having no other explanation for the existence of these ancient ruins or intriguing natural landmarks, popular myths were adapted to rationalize their presence and new ones embroidered to enhance them. One such legend that luis persisted consistently in Malayan folklore for over four centuries, both from oral and documentary sources, concerns the presence of a iost city ' Kota Gelanggi, lying deep in the jungles at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula. Allegedly raided by Raja Rajendra Cholavarman I (r. AD 1014-44) of the South Indian Chola Dynasty at the dawn of the last millennium, Kota Gelanggi (or 'Kota Batu Hitam' that is 'The Black Stone Fort') is mentioned by name in the Sejarah Melavu and may hold the key to the riddle of Srivijaya's triumvirate polities. Its precise location - and thus its veiy existence - has been the subject of much speculation over the past century of modern archaeological and historical research. Winstedt (1932) and Gardner (1932) both suggest that the site may lie somewhere along the upper reaches of the Johor River. Swettenham (1885) and Linehan (1936, 1947a and 1 This article is dedicated to Ché-Ross Mohamad Noor, whose personal presence and moral support at my preliminary expedition in search of Kota Gelanggi is very much appreciated. Likewise, a hutang budi is owed to Stewart Brooke- Wavell, author, broadcaster and explorer, whose books, The Naga King's Daughter and The Lost World of the East , are a constant source of inspiration in my own travels and writings. 2 A slightly different version of this article, focusing on the technical and visual aspects of the topic, was presented in a series of closed-door briefings between January and June 2004 at the Jabatan Muzium dan Antikuiti Malaysia, Muzium Negara, Kuala Lumpur (Ref. JMA/BP/1 46/1 5/7), the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore, the Johor Chapter of the Badan Warisan Malaysia and, finally, to a select group of interested scholars at the Badan Warisan Malaysia and the Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia. These briefings were prompted by the official notification of my preliminary findings to the relevant authorities on 20 December 2003, as required under the Antiquities Act (1976), Revised 1998, Part II, Section 4(1). 27</page><page sequence="2">PART 2, 2004 1947c), on the other hand, equate Kota Gelanggi with the cave complex of the same name in Pahang. In the absence of substantial opposition over the issue, the Kota Gelanggi cave complex of Pahang has since been recognized as 'the' Kota Gelanggi, despite the highly circumstantial and unconvincing evidence put forth to support the claim. Disturbingly, this latter hypothesis has gained wide enough credence to prompt the notion among some philologists that the perplexing 'Goa' mentioned in the introduction to the Sejarah Melayu refers to a 'Gua' (cave), more specifically the 'Gua' of Kota Gelanggi in Pahang (Linehan, 1947a: 112-16; Abdul Rahman Ismail, 1998: 7-20). In a harsher vein, Quartrich- Wales (1940: 57-9) dismissed the possibility of a 'lost city' ever existing in Johor based entirely on superficial grounds. Recent scholars (Abdul Halim Nasir, 1990, Nik Hassan Shuhaimi, 2002) have tactfully disputed these arbitrary conclu- sions by proposing that the 'real' Kota Gelanggi might still lie hidden in the darkest interiors of Johor. The following speculative essay sets out to unravel the two major threads of this 'fable' via an entirely fresh and holistic approach. The main thrust of this article will be to rationalize, clarify, and explain the status of the Kota Gelanggi of Pahang in relation to the Kota Gelanggi of Johor. On the basis of these findings, the question of which 'Goa' is referred to in the Muqadimah of the Sejarah Melayu shall then be addressed. The discus- sion concludes with a brief 'postscript' detailing recent efforts to determine the probable sites for the Kota Gelanggi of Johor.3 The Sejarah Melayu and Kota Gelanggi: A Tale Retold 'A problem cannot be solved, with the consciousness that created it.' Einstein Our primary source of information on Kota Gelanggi appears in Chapter II of the Sejarah Melayu that was edited and revised, according to conventional wisdom, by Tun Seri Lanang, Bendahara at the Royal Court of Johor, c. AD 1612. This chapter appears to narrate an account of the devastating raids struck by Raja Rajendra Cholavarman I along the western coast of the Malay Peninsula, c. AD 1025. After destroying the city of Gangga Negara (now generally identified with Beruas in Lower Perak), Raja Rajendra Cholavarman I - known here as Raja Chulan or Suran - turned his attention to Kota Gelanggi: 3 The article will therefore be limited to the question of the location of Kota Gelanggi. What it was shall be dealt with in a different forum. Preliminary attention may, however, be drawn to Moens' (1939) discussion regarding the Kingdom of Lo-Yue and its location in Johor. Incidentally, official Japanese records note that a former Imperial Crown Prince of Japan, Prince Takaoka, Shinnyo Hosshinno (AD 780-ca. 856), reportedly met his death in Lo-Yue after being attacked by a tiger (a different source has it that the prince succumbed to an undisclosed illness). The prince had broken his journey at Lo-Yue on his way to study the Holy Buddhist Scriptures in India (Personal Communication from Prof. Nomura Toru, Keio University, 24 June 2004). His remains or ashes are presumably interred somewhere in the ruins of this kingdom. A Memorial Tablet erected in his honour by Bishop Nakagawa from Shinno-in Monastery may be found at the Japanese Cemetery in Johor Bharu (Personal Communication from Rev. Eijun Eidson, 19 September 2004). The monastery, located at Mount Koya near Osaka, was established by Prince Takaoka prior to his departure from Japan, i.e. over a thousand years ago. I am indebted to Datin Patricia Lim for sharing this detail and for supplying a copy of an unpublished paper on the subject by Prof. Nomura Toru. Cf. Note 17 below and Hirth and Rockhill (1911: 60-7). 28</page><page sequence="3">JMBRAS VOL. 77 FIG. I. Raffles Malay 18 Sejarah Melayu : The Jawi passage concerning Raja Rajendra Cholavarman I's progress to Kota Gelanggi. Reproduced by kind permission of the Royal Asiatic Society, London. Setelah negeri Gangga Negara sudah alah, maka Raja Chulan pun berjalanlah davi sana. Setelah beberapa lamanya di jalan , datanglah hingga sarhad negeri Linggiu; dahulu kala negeri itu negeri besar, kotanya batu hitam lada, datang sekarang lagi ada kota itu. Adapun asal namanya 'Gelanggui', ertinya 'Perbendaharaan Perniata' ; kerana kita tiada tahu menyebut dia, menjadi 'Linggiu'. Adapun nama rajanya Raja Chulin, akan baginda itu raja besar, segala raja-raja di bawah angin itu sekaliannya dalam hukumnya. After Gangga Negara was defeated, Raja Chulan took his leave and continued on his journey, and after a while, he arrived at the boundaries of the city of Linggiu. Once upon a time, this was a large fort whose walls were made of rock as black as peppercorn; this fort still exists to this day. The original name of this city was 'Gelanggui', which means 'The Treasury of Jewels'; but due to our mispronunciation of the word, it has now become 'Linggiu'. The name of its ruler was Raja Chulin, and he was a great king, with all the kings below the winds coming under his sway {Sejarah Melayu Raffles Malay 18 (Cheah, 1998: 75)). Hatta berapa lamanya berjalan itu, datanglah ke negeri Langgiu: dahulu negeri itu negeri besar, kotanya daripada batu hitam; sekarang lagi ada kota itu di hulu Sungai Johor. Adapun nama asal 'Langgiu' itu dengan bahasa Siam ertinya ' Perbendaharaan Permata '. Maka adalah nama rajanya Chulan; akan baginda itu raja besar, segala raja-raja yang di bawah angin dalam hukumannya. 29</page><page sequence="4">PART 2, 2004 After travelling for a while, they arrived at the city of Langgiu: once upon a time this was a large city, with walls of black stone; this fort still exists today on the upper reaches of the Johor River. The original name for 'Langgiu' comes from the language of the Siamese, where it means 'The Treasury of Jewels'. The name of its king was Chulan, and he was a great king, with all the kings under the winds coming under his sway. ( Sejarah Melayu , DBP MS 86a Recension II (Abdul Samad Ahmad, 2000: 11)). From Gangga Negara, Raja Suran advanced to the country of Glang Kiu; which in former times was a great country, possessing a fort of black stone up the river Johor. In the Siamese language, this word signifies the place of the emerald (Khlang Khiaw), but by persons ignorant of this language, it is usually termed Glang Kiu. The name of the Raja of this country, was Raja Chulan, who was superior to all the Rajas of the countries lying under the wind (Leyden, 1821: 10). The first excerpt is taken from a transliteration of Raffles Malay 18 of the Sejarah Melayu preserved at the Royal Asiatic Society in London (see Fig. 1). This manuscript is generally acknowledged as the sole copy extant bearing the earliest version of the text, i.e. one predating its revision in c. 1612. The second excerpt is taken from a modern translit- eration of its later recension (Roolvink's Recension II), from manuscripts kept by the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The last comes from Leyden's (1821) English translation of the text. Various tales, both ancient and modern, have been spun from these brief lines. Though much is shrouded in myth and pointless confusion, the question also arises of whether or not we should take Tun Seri Lanang for his word. Three points can neverthe- less be drawn from the Sejarah Melayu' s assertion: that there exists a great fortified city, that it was built of black stone, and that it lay far on the upper reaches of the Johor River. In spite of Tun Seri Lanang's clear-cut explanation that the name 'Kota Gelanggi' means a 'Treasury of Jewels', the name has been subjected to much misinterpretation. We are reminded here of the old Malay saying, 'Sudah Terang, Lagi Bersuluh.'4 Wolters (1970: 97-8) agrees that the Malay rendition 'Gelanggi' resembles the Thai 'Khlang' or 'Treasury', perhaps suffixed with the word 'Kaew' or 'Jewel', thus 'Khlang-kaew' mispronounced as 'Klangkiu'. It may be noted that the Thai word for 'Box' is 'Ghlong'. We therefore have 'Glang Gui' and 'Gelanggiu', and hence the more familiar 'Gelanggi' and 'Linggiu' today, with the latter being a plausible derivation of 'Khlang-Kaew', an entirely acceptable digression. The attribution of its origins to 'Bahasa Siam'5 is likewise deftly explained by Douglas (1989: 501): '... we know that Malays habitually name places or mines as Siamese, which are known to have existed long prior to their arrival [i.e. the arrival of the Siamese], and so must mean the people who occupied the territory [which was] later occupied by the Siamese; and this at the period of the Chola raids [meant] the Khmers.' Wolters (1970: 77-107), however, inventively associates 'Gelanggi' with the Malay word for 'Anklets' or 'Gelang', which he considers to be symbols of sovereign power; 4 In one sense, 'to cast superfluous light onto an already brightly illuminated path'. 5 On this point, Major Dato' Haji Mohamed Said (1950: 12) has the following to say: 'The Siamese Kingdom ... invaded and occupied a portion of the South of Malaya, in the region of the present Kota Tinggi, Johore. The city was called Klang Kiew early in the 9th century AD. They built a strong fort of black stone on the right bank of the upper part of the Johore River about four miles from the present Kota Tinggi Police Station. It flourished until it was conquered by Raja Suran early in the 11th century AD....' Said appears to have mistaken the seventeenth-century remains at Johor Lama for the site of the pre-Malaccan Kota Gelanggi. 30</page><page sequence="5">JMBRAS VOL. 77 though the principal presumption had more perhaps to do with their aural similitude than anything else. This 'link' was then reconjured by him as a literary allusion to Kota Gelanggi's fall to a Tamil invader, represented by the royal 'Gelang'. Wolters proposes on this basis that 'the genealogist' of the Sejarah Melayu may have invented the word 'Glanggui' by means of complicated linguistic convolutions to hide this 'embarrassing sit- uation'; i.e. the subjugation of a Malay city by an Indian conqueror. Rajantheran (1999: 204-10) recently echoed the same view without further analysis or amendment, while Braddell (1941) jumbles some vowels and favours a Burmese pitch on the question instead. These novel attempts at playing historical scrabble with phonetic tiles are nonetheless fundamentally flawed. Relying, it seems, solely on the Sejarah Melayu" s text in Raffles Malay 18, Wolters inexplicably confuses Kota Gelanggi with Palembang. 'Unless future research discovers in the toponymy of the Palembang area an explanation of either Glang Gui or Lunggui/Lenggui, "Glang Gui" must be discarded as a genuine place name and instead, be studied as a genealogist's symbol' (Wolters, 1970: 105), which explains his misguided tangent. Apart from clarifying its actual location on the headwaters of the Sungei Johor in later recensions, the unambiguous chronology presented in the Sejarah Melayu of Raffles Malay 18 itself shows that the city was patently named 'Gelanggi' before its fall to the conquering hordes ('adapun asal namanya ...'), thus negating Wolters' theory about the quoted segment by default. By the same virtue, we may take heed of his own maxim that 'Historians will then have to keep on reminding themselves that their eagerness to exploit the contents of a text does not relieve them of the prior responsibility of deciding what needs to be known about the text before it can be used' (Wolters, 1970: xi-xii). Incidentally, by casting an Indian light on this question of nomenclature, we see that the Hindustani word for a 'Warehouse' is 'Kidangi', in Hindi 'Godam', or in Telugu 'Gidangi' (and, of course, the Malay 'Gudang' and hence English 'Godown'), all mean- ing 'a place where goods lie' or where goods are stored (Winstedt, 1917: 67-8). Unlike the doubtful connotations of the 'Anklet' theory, the aural and intrinsic semblance of these Indian words with 'Gelanggi' and its Thai definition possesses a more persuasive premise in light of the strong Tamil merchant presence in the region at the time (Guy, 2001). Scholarly Appraisals: A Fable Unfolds 'Harap ada, percaya tidak.' Old Malay Proverb Over 300 years after Tun Seri Lanang's first notice of the 'lost city', we find Kota Gelanggi being mentioned by another distinguished historian and counsellor to a ruler of Johor, Sir Richard Olof Winstedt (1878-1966), British General Adviser to Johor (1931-5). In his History of Johor (1932), Winstedt (p. 207) mentions the legendary fortress with a tinge of good humour: 'Did this Black Stone Fort ever really exist? If so, would not the author of the "Malay Annals" have defined the site more closely? . . . The topographical surveyors have missed the Black Fort, if it exists, and the Jakuns have so far failed to get the reward offered for its discovery.' 31</page><page sequence="6">PART 2, 2004 Winstedťs musings were influenced in no small measure by the theories of the amateur scholar and archaeologist Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), who discovered the remains of Kota Kara and Kota Budak at Johor Lama in 1931 (Winstedt, 1932: 139-41). Gardner, whose fascination for legends, sorcery, and witchcraft would earn him much notoriety in his later years,6 listened closely to the tales recited by the Sakais of Johor concerning a 'Kota Batu Itam' on the upper waters of the Johor River. As late as 1928, Gardner reported that there was an Orang Asli who had offered to take people to this mysterious place. Regretfully, the invitation failed to entice any takers before the Orang Asli's death in 1932 (Brocelin, 1960: 107). Was this man the 'Proto-Malay' Pak Kombong mentioned by Winstedt (1932: 145), who claimed to have seen the site, 'in good condition [and] built on white sand, [with] its gate guarded by a serpent!', two days' journey from Pengkalan Rumput on the Linggiu River? Winstedt also relates a more detailed anecdote by a Johor game warden, Captain Ahmad Muhammadun, who once travelled three days from a Jakun kampung called Menjar at Ulu Semberong Rawa to Pasir Chawil at the headwaters of the Linggiu River. Captain Ahmad informs us that the Linggiu River was blocked by sand near a site called Selong. Half a day's trek from there took him to Sulor Kantan, where his Jakun guides, Batin Tala and Batin Jebus, told him that 'travellers, who lost their way there, sometimes found themselves in orchards and among buildings surrounded by a Black Stone Fort called Kota Gelanggi. Travellers could eat the fruit on the spot but not take it away or they could never find their way out! ' (Winstedt, 1932: 145). Even the usually dismissive Quaritch- Wales (1940: 57-8) was moved to grudging- ly consider the existence of Kota Gelanggi as a possibility : ' . there was the belief, deeply rooted in interested Johor circles, in the existence of a certain Black Stone Fort (Kota Batu Hitam) dating from the pre-Malacca period, which according to the 1612 AD edition of the Malay Annals, was situated up the Johor river. It seemed to me that this belief in the existence of such a site differed somewhat from the usual products of the unlettered imag- ination which I find are most frequently offered as a sop to archaeologists in districts where in fact no ancient remains are known to the inhabitants. I hoped therefore it might be possible to find on what basis of fact or legend the claim rested.' His investigations, however, unearthed nothing, though the negative result was undeniably due to his languid method of gathering research data ( quo vide), rather than the failure of on-site fieldwork. The myth, in the meantime, endured all the same. 6 Gardner's colourful and controversial life is well documented in Brocelin's Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960). A gifted amateur historian and archaeologist in his own right, Gardner is credited as the modern founder of the alternative Wiccan Religion. In 1954, he published a treatise entitled Witchcraft Today , which revived the creed that is actively pursued in the West. Modern writers have by and large focused primarily on this late (and titillating) aspect of his life, and ignored his scholarly contributions to Eastern antiquity. This has been due, in part, by their appearance in relatively obscure journals not readily accessible by those who are unfamiliar with Gardner's early interests (Personal Communication from Morgan Davis, Web-Maintainer of the Official Gerald Gardner Website, 8 July 2002). Readers of this Journal may, however, recognize Gardner as the author of various papers on early Malay numismatics and the landmark study on Malay ker is, Keris and Other Malay Weapons (1936). Gardner's private papers and library are now held by the Wiccan Church of Canada. His impor- tant and valuable collection of historical Malay keris and other weapons was bought by the Ripley's Believe-It- Or-Not Museum organization, and now lies scattered throughout its museums worldwide. 32</page><page sequence="7">JMBRAS VOL. 77 Kota Gelanggi Yang Mana? Four years after the publication of the History ofJohor , Linehan (1936: 241-6) countered Winstedt's report by arguing that what the Sejarah Melayu had truly proposed was the 'famous Kota Gelanggi' cave complex near Pulau Tawar in Pahang. To support his asser- tions, Linehan quoted at length from Cameron's report {quo vide) of his visit to Pahang's Kota Gelanggi in 1882, and cited both Evans (1927) who discovered prehistoric artefacts there, and Swettenham (1885) who visited the fabled caves in 1884. Linehan further claimed that: Johor forces sacked Pahang in September 1612, a year or so before the Malay Annals were com- menced. The Johor men brought back captives, who no doubt, circulated among the people legends of Pahang including that of Kota Gelanggi. It is probable that this was the account which inspired Tun Seri Lanang to connect Ganggayu and its king, Raja Chulan, with Gelanggi and its fabled monarch. Why do the 'Annals' state that Gelang Kiu was situated in the upper reaches of the Johor? We may assume either that the story of Gelanggi reached the author in a garbled form, or that, as a patriotic son of Johor, he was determined that his country should be connected with the beginnings of the Malay kings, or that he made the simple mistake of writing Johor for Pahang, or that a subsequent Johor commentator, convinced that the author was wrong, took it upon himself to emend the original text and that this emendation became incorporated in the MSS of the 'Annals' which have been handed down to us. We have d'Eredia's word for it that in ancient times the King of Pahang ruled over the coun- tries of Ujong Tanah (which of course included Johor). Mention of the 'Siamese' subjects of Raja Chulan would point to Pahang rather than Johor as having been the scene of conflict between him and Raja Suran. In the vicinity of Kota Gelanggi [Pahang] is a stream called the Sungai Lego (Ligor).7 The name of Raja Chulan's daughter, Puteri Onang Kiu, is reminiscent of that of Puteri Onang (or Wanang) Seri, the daughter of the King of Pahang who was captured by the Malacca Malays about 1454, married Sultan Mansur, and was the ancestress of the ancient Sultans of Pahang (Linehan, 1936: 242). While Linehan's arguments for equating the Sejarah Melayu' s Kota Gelanggi with the Kota Gelanggi or any other caverns in Pahang (cf. Bradell, 1941; Linehan, 1947a, 1947c), is convincing based on his reading of the facts, they may be disproved on histor- ical and textual grounds, and by reviewing the results of modern archaeological excava- tions carried out since at the Pahang cave complex. The Kota Gelanggi of Pahang is situated approximately 25 kilometres east of Jerantut, off the old road to the township of Maran in central Pahang. It consists of a sprawling cave complex and eight of these, for example, Kota Tongkat, Kota Burung, Kota Balai, and Kota Angin, are open to the public. Visitors to the caves are routinely taken on an amateur spelunking adventure and shown two anthropomorphic limestone formations. One bears the abstract form of a striking cobra. The other supposedly resem- bles a bridal couple sitting in state (mempelai ber sanding) when shafts of light strike upon the stalactite from an opening high above - lending its name to the chamber, Gua Sanding. These mystical ascriptions are hardly surprising, for the jungles of Pahang have long been regarded by the Malays and Orang Asli with superstitious veneration and fear. 7 It is worthwhile to note that the Siamese did not gain suzerainty over the coastal regions of Ligor until the late thirteenth centuiy, i.e. 1280 (Douglas, 1989: 499-502). Kota Gelanggi was supposedly raided by Raja Cholavarman I in ca. AD 1025, two centuries before. 33</page><page sequence="8">PART 2, 2004 The Hikayat Pahang reports that during a pleasure trip to Chenor in c. 1 860, Wan Ahmad (1836-1914), then the Dato' Bendahara Siwa' Raja of Pahang, had overheard a strange tale about a mysterious city inhabited by supernatural beings in the interior of Ulu Tekam, Setelah beberapa lama bersemayam, hendak berangkat hilir, balik ke Pekan. Maka dapatlah suatu khabar yang indah. (Rakyat) Ulu Tekam banyaklah (yang) pelik-pelik dan elok dan rumahnya cantik, khabarnya dayang-dayang zaman al-Marhum Lubuk Pelang. Akan hal tempat itu, seorang pun tiada berani pergi, takut akan rakyat besar panjang, tapak kakinya tiga jengkal kononnya, lebar dua jengkal Having resided there for a while, they decided to make their way back downstream to Pekan. A beautiful tale was thereupon received, that there were many strange and enchanting beings living in beautiful houses at Ulu Tekam; they were apparently royal handmaideñs from the time of the late Marhum Lubuk Pelang. As for the place itself, there was not one single person who has been brave enough to venture there, for they were in fear of these large and tall beings, whose footprints allegedly measure three spans in length and two spans in width. Maka Dato ' Bendahara Siwa Raja dipanggilnya Imam Perang Rasu (dan Haji Muhammad Nor), dititahkan suruh cari, langgar jikalau ada, dilawan sekalian Sakai di dalam Tekam itu. Maka sembah Perang Rasu, 'Taatlah patik mengerjakan titah. ' Kemudian Raja pun berangkat hilir ke Pekan. The Dato' Bendahara Siwa Raja then summoned Imam Perang Rasu (and Haji Muhammad Nor) and commanded them to search for these creatures, and seize them if they do indeed exist, by hunting down all the Sakais in Tekam. To which Perang Rasu replied, 'Your Humble Servant shall loyally carry out your Command.' The Raja then departed and made his way downstream to Pekan. Maka Imam Perang Rasu pun mudiklah berkerah sekalian anak buah pegangannya, beratus-ratus diajak masuk Sungai Tekam dengan alat senjatanya seperti hendak berperang. Мака buatlah dicarinya didalam Tekam itu, tiadalah ia berjumpa dengan Sakai-Sakai; yang ada itu hanyalah ada dua tiga belas kelamin sahaja yang selalu turun di Kampung Kuala dan Pulau Tawar, membawa damar dan rotan. Imam Perang Rasu in the meantime went upstream where he ordered all those under his liege, numbering in their hundreds, all fully equipped with weapons as if they were prepared for war, to join him on his expedition along the Sungai Tekam. A thorough search was then executed in the interior of Tekam, but there were no Sakais to be seen; those who were there numbered merely a measly twelve to thirteen couples or so, who travelled frequently down to Kampung Kuala and Pulau Tawar bringing resin and rattan. Kemudian balik hilirlah Imam Perang Rasu keluar ke Sungai Pahang dengan terus hilir ke Pekan mengadap Raja, persembahkan tiada, dan ia-lah bohong orang-orang sahaja. Maka Raja meneri- ma kasihlah di atas kepenatan itu (Kalthum, 1986: 65). Imam Perang Rasu thus wended his way downstream back into the Sungai Pahang, whereupon he set straight forth to Pekan for an audience with the Raja; it was duly reported that there was no such thing, and that it was purely lies which were made up by people. But the Raja nonetheless gave his thanks for their pains. 34</page><page sequence="9">JMBRAS VOL. 77 Notwithstanding the wild Sakai chase, Wan Ahmad was enthralled enough by these fascinating tales to embark on another mystery adventure trip into the interior, c. 1863, just prior to his installation as the Sultan of Pahang. This time, the venture succeeded with more tangible and pleasing results: Dengan kelamaan Raja berangkat mudik ke Pulau Tawar bermain-main. Sekalian Dato '-Dato ' semuanya bersediakan balai. Пар-Пар tempat mengadakan persembahan kerbau, kambing; sekalian makanan dengan suka reda. Tambahan Raja berangkat mudik dengan membawa isteri sekalian putera-puteranya. Sangatlah indah angkatan itu. Sekalian kenaikan sampai ke Pulau Tawar, maka disambut oleh Imam Perang Inderà Gajah Pahang dengan sambut mulianya, disediakan dengan kota istana dan membuat jalan ke Kota Gelanggi. Berangkatlah Raja membawa sekalian isteri dan putera-putera dan sekalian dayang-dayang, sebab tempat itu sangat cantik dan peliknya (Kalthum, 1986: 94). A while later, the Raja made his way upstream on a pleasure trip to Pulau Tawar. All the Dato' there had pavilions prepared; each presenting offerings of buffalo, goats; and various food in generous delight. The Raja was also accompanied upstream with all his wives and children in train. This royal flotilla made a very beautiful sight indeed. Upon the arrival of the Royal Barge at Pulau Tawar, they were greeted with due pomp by Imam Perang Inderà Gajah of Pahang; who had palace dwellings prepared and a track cut through to Kota Gelanggi. The Raja thus made his way there, with all his wives, children and handmaidens accompanying him along, for the place was truly beautiful and enchanting. Their sense of wonder was also shared by William Cameron (1882), the first European to visit the cavern, and who would later (1885) discover the verdant highlands now bearing his name on the western fringes of Pahang: About this place [Kota Glanggi or Klanggi] there are many legends amongst the natives, but hitherto no European has ever been allowed to visit it. Native rumour describes it as an ancient ruin, the inmates of which, as well as their furniture and utensils, have been turned to stone. This is the substance of most of the native descriptions of the place ... the story was imparted to me whilst lying becalmed opposite Kwala Kuantan [sic], and seven idle Malay boatmen lying under the combined influence of sirih and roko' assisted in spinning the yarn. I must say that I was not deeply impressed with the truth of the narrative as a whole, but comparing what I heard with what I had previously seen on the Patani river, I was enabled to guess what these fabled ruins would turn out to be ... the wonderful ruins are, after all, only limestone caves, with no trace of man's handiwork about them, and no evidence whatsoever of having ever been even occupied by man.... I do not know how to describe it, language fails me, from the fact that there are no familiar objects to which I can liken it. ... I do not wonder that the superstitious Malays should have sought an explanation in the supernatural: according to them, this cave is the home of a great Hantu, and the violent wind which met us at the entrance was the breath of the angry spirit opposing our intrusion (Cameron, 1882: 153-8). Ill-humoured goblins aside, the Malays evidently overcame their reluctance in bringing Orang Putih to the caves after Cameron's innocuous visit to the 'sacred' site. Swettenham (1885) followed in his tracks three years later by exploring Kota Gelanggi in the company of none other than the legendary Pahang warrior and Wan Ahmad's protégé, Tok Gajah. His account of the side trip is considerably subdued and furnishes little detail compared to Cameron's. Swettenham, however, ends his diary entry concerning the excursion with the following postscript: 'It is worthy to record that this Kota Kelanggi is 35</page><page sequence="10">PART 2, 2004 mentioned in the Sej ara Malaiu [sic] (the Malay Annals) as having been occupied by the Siamese. The Sejara Malaiu is supposed to be the earliest written record of Malay History' (Swettenham, 1885: 24). This erroneous remark, plus other similarly careless statements, have ultimately led to the misidentification of the cave complex in Pahang with the Kota Gelanggi of Johor. Working on more solid ground, however, we find that numerous archaeological investigations have since been conducted around the Kota Gelanggi cave complex in Pahang. Scientific work was begun by Wray who collected and reported samples taken from a surface study in 1905. Evans (cf. 1920 and 1927) followed suit in a more academ- ic fashion by detailing trenches that were revisited by Peacock and Dunn (1968). Comprehensive excavations were later conducted by Adi Hj. Taha (1983) at Kota Balai, where over 3,000 pieces of freshwater shells, pottery, and stone tools were found. The last reported formal excavation carried out within the area was led by Kamaruzaman Hj. Abdul Rahman and Zulkifli Ja'afar in 1997 (cf. Mazlan, 1999; Wazia, 1999). Their findings reveal that the Kota Gelanggi cave complex was formerly and predominantly populated by prehistoric Hoabinhian and Neolithic inhabitants, a fact supported by the large remnants of food waste and stone implements produced by these cultures that were unearthed within. Of crucial significance is the fact that no evidence of any substantial habitation by an advanced culture postdating that time has ever been found in this cave complex, hence undermining Linehan's proposition entirely. Beside these definite findings, Linehan's arguments can be refuted further by a number of explicit and salient facts.8 A glaring oversight in Linehan's theory relates to the construction material of the real Kota Gelanggi. The Sejarah Melayu explicitly describes Kota Gelanggi as a 'large city, built of stone as black as peppercorns'. The Kota Gelanggi of Pahang is merely a network of limestone caves, not a 'large city built of stone as black as peppercorns'. If Kota Gelanggi were indeed a cave, Tun Seri Lanang would have surely said so. Geological maps and studies of Johor (for example, Ingham, 1948; Alexander, 1958; Jamaludin, 1992) show that the locality of Hulu Sungai Johor, that is, the purport- ed site of the real Kota Gelanggi, is characterized by a formation of granite and allied rocks, with a slight layering of hornblende granite from the post-Trias age upon it. Samples of granite taken from the area display colours ranging from deep shades of bluish black to grey-black. Such ample, durable, and readily available construction material would have been a natural choice for masons bent on building a fort in the area - and 8 Wavell (1986: 175-6) harboured similar qualms over Linehan's theory that an ancient town lies under Tasik Chini: 'A strangely vague observation for a scholar, I thought. Surely, he must have seen the lake and formed his own conclusions based largely on guesswork and instinct! Certainly he gave no reasons in his book. Unfortunately, I had never been introduced to Dr. Linehan. He died in 1955.... I tried to find out what he was like. ... Gerald Hawkins said of him: "He was a quiet scholarly type. I'm sure that whatever he says can be treat- ed with a great deal of respect". Mrs. Clark, a historian, knew Dr. Linehan well, "Many people thought", she said, "that he had some strange ideas and some even used to laugh at him, but I have always been impressed by the thoroughness of his research. He was a great scholar and knew what he was talking about".' It must be stressed here that my critique of Linehan's hypothesis above, as with Wolters', is strictly confined to the subject at hand. Linehan's reputation as an authority on Pahang's history is still unrivalled and his history of the state remains the key reference on the topic. For a detailed account of Wolters' distinguished scholarship, see Matheson-Hooker (2001). 36</page><page sequence="11">JMBRAS VOL. 77 certainly a striking feature for Tun Seri Lanang to comment on, seeing that he was more accustomed to the earthen embankments, coral stone and laterite walls surrounding the old royal environs around Johor Lama (Abdul Halim Nasir, 1990).9 On this point, it is useful to note that while myths abound connecting the legendary Cik Siti Wan Kembang with the caves of Cinta Wangsa in Kelantan, no tangible evidence exists to show that caves were ever utilized as the site or focal point of a permanent and substantial Malay istana or kerajaan. Instead, Malays generally subscribe to the belief that caves are the abode of Orang Bunian, Orang Halus, or a Tempat Bertapa - place of seclusive meditation and retreat - as remarked by Cameron. Coggin-Brown (1918: 395-6) notes that 'they [the caves] are universally regarded [by the Malays] with super- stitious respect ... in the Jalor caves, a strong wind blows outwards towards the entrance at certain times of the day, and inwards from it at others. This is believed by the Malays and Siamese of the district to be the actual Cave-Spirit (Hantu Goah) [sic].' With such terrifying manifestations, a cave could have hardly rated as an auspicious choice for any Malay abode, much less that of a royal kota. Secondly, while scribal errors and alterations are the rule rather than the exception in Malay philology, there is no logical reason for the author or scribe of the Sejarah Melayu to switch the location of Kota Gelanggi from Pahang - or anywhere else for that matter - to Johor. If a sense of misguided 'patriotism' was the impetus for this claim, Tun Seri Lanang could have utilized his poetic licence instead to relocate the grand empire of Inderapura romanticized in classical Malay literature from Pahang to Johor. Why choose a 'lesser' vanquished city such as Kota Gelanggi, unless the editor of the Sejarah Melayu was well aware that it was indeed located in Johor? Thirdly, and since we can presume no closer a familiarity with Tun Seri Lanang's neighbourhood than Linehan did, how can we ignore the Bendaharas', and the successive copyists', emphatic statement and elaboration that 'sekarang lagi ada kota itu di hulu Sungai Johor'? Living on its lower reaches as they were then, Tun Seri Lanang - and his scribal colleagues, both contemporary and subsequent - should be accorded the benefit of the doubt to know what was lying in their own backyard. There are two suggestions as to why these caves in Pahang are called Kota Gelanggi. Cameron (1882: 159-60) recounts that the Kota Gelanggi of Pahang was named after a legendary Raja Gelanggi.10 The exploits of this raja , however, had no direct 9 For a discussion on the description of forts and fortified cities in classical Malay literature, see Perret (1999: 245-60). 1U There is also another reference in classical Malay literature to a kingdom called 'Kelinggi' situated near a Pulau Air Tawar, a small inland island surrounded by a freshwater lake, to the south of Siam. The Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa (Siti Hawa Salleh, 1991: 61) describes the location of this 'negeri Kelinggi' in relation to the unsuccessful moves made by an ambitious Raja Kelana Hitam to subdue it. Fuming with anger and resent- ment, Raja Kelana Hitam opted instead to create a kingdom for himself by forcibly resettling all the Orang Asli in the area to live around his fiefdom of Pulau Air Tawar. The Raja then proclaimed himself their ruler, bearing the title Maharaja Darul-Salam. The Malay passage reads as follows: 'Sebermula, maka tersebutlah perkataan seorang Raja, Kelana Hitam namanya. Ia duduk pada suatu pulau, namanya pulau itu Pulau Air Tawar. Sebab dinamai orang Pulau Air Tawar itu kerana berkeliling pulau itu tasik, airnya pun tawar. Maka akan pulau itu kecil, duduknya ke timur negeri Kelinggi, ke selatan benua Siam. Maka raja itu ke negeri Kelinggi; pun tiada tunduk; dan ke benua Siam; pun ia tiada ditakluk. Kerana hatinya keras, hingga ia duduk menghimpunkan rakyat daripada bangsa Semang dan Wila dan rakyat bukit dan Sakai, digelarnya nama Penghulu yang besar- besarnya, disuruhnya duduk berkeliling tasik air tawar itu, pada masing-masing Penghulu Semang. Maka namanya Maharaja Darul-Salam....' There is also reference to another (or perhaps the same?) 'Kelinggi' earlier in the text (Ibid: 25-30). 37</page><page sequence="12">PART 2, 2004 association with the cave complex at all. Instead, the boatmen's tale was wrought around mythical supernatural wars fought between various neighbouring ethereal princely suitors for the Puteri Raja Gelanggi's hand in marriage. Compared to Tun Seri Lanang's ardent description of the real Kota Gelanggi's destruction by a temporal ruler; who was an actual historical figure from the Indian subcontinent (cf. Venkatachari, 1987), the basis of Pahang's Raja Gelanggi fades into trivialities and irrelevance. Furthermore, since the story was told 'by one of the oldest men at the kampong, as we rested ourselves after our labours on a rock at the foot of Kota Papan' (Ibid: 159), it was in all likelihood a yarn spun to flit away an afternoon's repose, with fragments of various rudimentary legends fitted together to form an entertaining whole, and off-handedly equated to the edifice before them. Gardner's memoirs, however, infer that accounts of the fabled city had long circu- lated among the Orang Asli and interior Malays living by the Johor-Pahang border. One could imagine the Johoreans gesturing vaguely towards the mysterious jungles of Pahang when asked where it was and the Pahangites reacting vice versa, with both being none the wiser as to its actual whereabouts. Hence, and alternatively, the Kota Gelanggi of Pahang could have been named after the real Kota Gelanggi in Johor, in a transmogrification of local legends from Johor to Pahang, and in opposition to the suggestion evoked by Quaritch- Wales (1940: 78): 'Thus it looks as though we can here actually trace an exam- ple of the transference of a legend from one site to another in conjunction with the migra- tion of a people. On their way to Johor, the Malacca Malays passed through Pahang. Possibly the natural limestone caves in Pahang which local Malays believed to be a fort and referred to as Kota Gelanggi may be a relic of the passage of the legend through Pahang.' Quaritch- Wales cites Cameron as one of his sources for this legend, and as we have seen above, the veracity of the tale recorded by the latter can be summarily dismissed. Failing to find the abode of the mythical fairy princesses of Ulu Tekam for Wan Ahmad, his chieftains brought him to the cave complex at Pulau Tawar to satisfy his curiosity for the supernatural. The Hikayat Pahang mentions that Wan Ahmad's consort, the Encik Puan Bongsu, was fond of reading Malay histories: ' . . . ia tiada khali sekali- kali menyuruh orang-orang membaca Sejarah Melayu dan Kanun zaman dahulu....' (Kalthum, 1986: 55), and so would have known of a Kota Gelanggi from her readings. Did she prompt the visit to the Kota Gelanggi of Pahang? Or did Wan Ahmad initiate the visit to impress his permaisuri by equating the fabled Kota Gelanggi of Johor with the caves in his newly inherited realm? Lastly, paraphrasing Douglas (1989: 501), why a pre-Malaccan state would want to establish its capital at Kota Gelanggi in central Pahang far from any direct route to the Tembeling and Pahang rivers, and hence vital access to riverine trade so crucial to its exis- tence, is beyond comprehension. Though the suggestion that Langkasuka may lie in the depths of Tasik Chini is plausible due to its close proximity to key riverine routes, equat- ing the historical Kota Gelanggi with the geological Kota Gelanggi of Pahang is geo- graphically misplaced due to its distance from the same.11 1 1 For reports on aerial surveys of Tasek Chini and the probability that it may have been the site of a sub- stantial ancient settlement, see McHugh (1961) and Southwood (1960). 38</page><page sequence="13">JMBRAS VOL. 77 Hence, by taking the evidence presented above (and debated below) into consider- ation, the suggestion that the Kota Gelanggi of Pahang was the site of a pre-Malaccan metropolis may perhaps be now conclusively discarded - and the original premise that the 'real' Kota Gelanggi lies in Johor can likewise be firmly reinstated. Resolving the 'Goa' in the Muqadimah of the Sejarah Melayu 'When we consider a book, we musn't ask ourselves what it says, but what it means.' Umberto Eco If the argument above merits acceptance, viz. that the Kota Gelanggi referred to in the Sejarah Melayu lies not in Pahang but in Johor, we are still confronted by one remaining issue: which 'Goa' was the editor of the Sejarah Melayu referring to? It is galling to learn that throughout the entire dispute over this vexed question, an evaluation of the usage of the word 'Goa' within its own textual, historical, and geographical context has never been attempted. In the first respect, a search for occurrences of the word 'Goa' in the longer version of Recension II of the Sejarah Melayu, using Proudfoot's Malay Concordance Project program, produced revealing data.12 To amplify the point of this discussion, the results of a standard search for the full context of all occurrences of the word 'Goa' in this recension is reproduced sequentially below.

As we can see, there are thirty instances of 'Goa' in the entire text: nineteen using 4 Goa' to mean the Bugis city in Macassar, and eleven in relation to the Portuguese 'Goa' in India. More importantly, the use of 'Goa' in each context is chronologically and distinctly separated in the text. Besides appearing in the Muqadimah , references to the Bugis Goa occur solely and specifically in the chapter concerning the visit of a Malaccan delegation to Goa in Macassar, that is, in the earlier section of the Sejarah Melayu (Abdul Samad Ahmad, 2000: 100-5). The fact that this is also the same chapter where the interpolation asserting the Bugis origins of Hang Tuah is forwarded cannot be over emphasized. Similarly, the attribution of Goa to the port-city in Portuguese India appears strictly with reference to the Portuguese incursions into Malacca, with this correlation consistently underlined in the relevant passages. There can, therefore, be no mistaking the distinction drawn between their respective appearances in the text: the earlier section refers to Bugis Goa, and the later segments to Portuguese Goa (also cf. Raffles, 1879). On this topic, it should be noted that the word 'Pahang' occurs 268 times in Recension II, with no references whatsoever to the seat of government being anywhere near a 'Gua' or 'Jelai'. Surely if the Hikayat Melayu - the Sejarah Melayu' s predeces- sor - had indeed been brought from a 'Gua' or the vicinity of a 'Gua' in Pahang, there would be further citation of the place in the text? There are, moreover, no examples of the 42</page><page sequence="17">JMBRAS VOL. 77 use of 'Goa/Gua' (Cave/s) in the Sejarah Melayu. Nor is a 'Gua' or even a 'Pahang' ever mentioned in the Hikayat Hang Tuah. We find 'Pahang' cited sixteen times in the Bustanus-Salatin , but the name is again devoid of any connection to a 'Gua'. The utter absence of such a vital co-relation in the Sejarah Melayu , and other contemporaneous works (besides the historical and scientific points argued above), com- pel us to eliminate once and for all the notion that the source text was ever preserved in a 'Gua' in Pahang. Superimposed against the convincing and judicious points raised by Douglas (1989: 495), Roolvink (1998: 27-34), and Abdul Samad Ahmad (2000: xxiii-xxvi) in dismissing the Portuguese-Goa as a definite option (Gibson-Hill, 1956: 185-8); thereby identifying 'Goa' with the Bugis Goa in Makassar, we may have now finally reached the logical solu- tion to this confounding question (barring the future discovery of a hitherto unknown Hikayat Melayu at the archives in India's Portuguese Goa!): that the Sejarah Melayu' s nucleus text was brought to Johor, not from Portuguese Goa in India or a 'Gua' in Pahang, but from Bugis Goa in Macassar. 43</page><page sequence="18">PART 2, 2004 FIG. 2.

Comparable doubts and questions over the definitive location of the Kota Gelanggi in Johor were recently raised, albeit in a more subdued and considered manner, by the late Malay writer and renowned explorer, Abdul Halim Nasir. In his landmark study on Malay forts and fortifications, Kota-Kota Melayu , Abdul Halim (1990: 57-8) remarked: AMi-ahli sejarah masih belum dapat menentukan di mana sebenarnya terletak Kerajaan 'Langgiu ' atau 'Klang-Kio ' itu, adakah terletak di Hulu Johor, berhampiran dengan Sungai Pangkali yang disebut oleh Sejarah Melayu itu, kerana di Hulu Sungai Johor ada sungai kecil terletak disituyang bernama Sungai Linggiu. Barangkali Sungai Linggiu itulah yang dimaksudkan 'Linggiu'. Setengah-setengah ahli sejarah berpendapat 'Langgiu' atau ' Klang-Kio' itu tidak lain adalah Kota Gelanggi yang terletak berhampiran dengan Jerantut, Pahang. Sejauh mana kebenarannya belum ada bukti yang boleh digunakan. Bagi pendapat penulis, kerajaan *. Linggiu ' itu tetap di sekitar Sungai Linggiu yang terletak di Hulu Johor, kerana selain dari namanya yang hampir sama, di sekitar Sungai Linggiu juga terdapat kesan-kesan perkuburan yang berusia tua, serta kesan-kesan penempatan tertua. Perkara ini patutlah diberi perhatian oleh pakar-pakar penyelidikan, terutama sekali ahli-ahli sejarah tempatan. Historians are yet to determine just precisely where the kingdom of 'Langgiu' or 'Klang-Kio' may be located, perhaps it is located at Hulu Johor, near the Pangkali River mentioned in the Sejarah Melayu , for at the Hulu Sungei Johor there is a small river nearby called the Linggiu River. Maybe it is this Linggiu River that is meant by 'Linggiu'. Other historians are of the opinion, on the other hand, that 'Langgiu' or 'Klang-Kio' is none other than the Kota Gelanggi that is situated near 47</page><page sequence="22">PART 2, 2004 Jerantut, Pahang. As for the truth behind this, useful facts are yet to be had. In the opinion of the writer, the kingdom of 'Linggiu' is firmly located around the environs of the Linggiu River at the Hulu Sungei Johor, for apart from having almost similar names, there are also remnants of ancient graveyards and ancient settlements scattered around the Linggiu River. This matter ought to be really given due attention from research experts, and in particular by our local historians. A reflective opinion was voiced by Nik Hassan Shuhaimi (2002: 111-12) in his paper commemorating the sesquicentenary of archaeological research in Johor. Summarizing a pastiche of former theories on the existence of this city, and falling heavily on Hervey's itinerary for support, Nik Hassan Shuhaimi mentions that: Kemungkinan besar misteri kerajaan proto-sejarah di Johor yang diperkatakan itu dapat disele- saikan dengan diberi tumpuan kepada tempat yang bernama Candi Bemban di Ulu Sungai Madek, dalam pertyelidikan arkeologi lanjutan pada masa akan datang. Selain itu , wajar diliputi juga tempat seperti Gajah Mina dan Pasir Berhala kerana ada juga kaitan dengan tamadun agama Hindu dan Buddha di tebing Sungai Lenggiu. It is highly likely that the aforementioned mysterious proto-historic kingdom in Johor, may be resolved by giving due focus to a place known as Candi Bemban at the Ulu Sungai Madek, in further future archaeological research. That aside, it would also be appropriate to cover places such as Gajah Mina and Pasir Berhala, for it has links to Hindu and Buddhist civilizations on the banks of the Lenggiu River. But despite such documentary clues, enticing comments, and succinct directions, the matter has not warranted enough attention to encourage a full-scale search for the site.13 There was, however, one near exception. Quaritch- Wales (1940: 59) had once toyed with the idea of searching for the lost city, but was deterred after a discouraging encounter: 'Accordingly, during my stay of four months in Johor, every effort was made to obtain such information [about the Black Stone Fort]. I was personally present when the headman of all the scattered Proto-Malays in the Lenggiu District [s/c] - the only people able to support life in this desolate region at the present day - was carefully interlocuted on the subject one day when he visited Kota Tinggi. He was quite clear and definite on the subject, admitting that, while the Proto-Malays had an extensive knowledge of the jungle which they continually had to traverse in search of jungle produce, the Black Stone Fort story was only known down river at Kota Tinggi. I was entirely satisfied with the genuineness of this man's statement.' Given Quaritch- Wales' extensive experience in dealing with the evasiveness and exaggerations of simple village folk from Singapore to Thailand, one cannot but still feel amused by his Mead-like naïveté and ready acceptance of the Orang Asli's 'interlocution'. Granted that the Batin could have genuinely been oblivious to any knowledge of the actual location of the elusive Kota Batu Hitam;14 it is nevertheless tempting to wonder if 13 Chasing 'Lost Cities' by reinterpreting ancient and obscure texts is, of course, nothing new in archaeolo- gy. Two recent and successful ventures include Sir Ranulph Fiennes' 1991 discovery of the Lost City of Ubar, a Biblical city mythologized in A Thousand &amp; One Nights (Fiennes, 1992), and the underwater discovery of an entire ancient city lying submerged off the sea near Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, in 2001 (Parthasarathy, 2002), based on information gathered from local myths and legends. 14 Incidentally, how would Orang Asli know what a 'Black Stone Fort' looked like if they have not seen one physically themselves? It is highly unlikely that 'Black Stone Forts' are such a common a sight in the jungles 48</page><page sequence="23">JMBRAS VOL. 77 the Batin's deflection had merely been a smooth tactical retreat. Faced with the prospect of playing Umbopa to Quaritch- Wales' Quatermain, it would have been infinitely wiser for the Batin to protest his ignorance as he steadily backed away; thus saving himself the trouble of unwanted impositions and possibly perilous demands at the behest of this commanding Orang Putih. Hence, while the general consensus is that a Kota Gelanggi does probably exist - saving Quaritch- Wales' presence - somewhere up the Johor River, the actual location and existence of this fabled city is yet to be ascertained, and hands-on exploration of the sug- gested area has been neglected15 - until today. Postscript: An Awfully Big Adventure 'And here, poor fool, with all my lore, I stand no wiser, than before.' Goethe Now that we have assessed the salient textual facts - as they stand - is this definite proof that there is a 'Lost City' of Kota Gelanggi ? Most certainly not. What we have discovered and determined are merely considerable historical hints alluding to the presence of this 'lost kingdom' somewhere in the heart of our southernmost state.16 The question now is, if Kota Gelanggi did once exist, where would its ruins lie? Extensive examination of contemporary descriptions relating to maritime trade and kingdoms in the vicinity of Johor has proven instructive.17 They indicate that there are, in for the Orang Asli to be familiar with their appearance or mode of construction; as in the instances we have recorded here (i.e. oral descriptions dating from the 1920s to the present day). Pak Kombong's ( quo supra ) description can also be convincingly pared down to its bare details: part of the remains consist of a granite wall or fortifications, that bears a gate carved over on its lintel or pediment with a Boma or Naga or adorned with a pair of Makara (hence his statement that it was guarded by a 'Serpent'). Pak Kombong could not have conjured this up from thin air, as there were no examples of this kind of carved stonework in the Malay Peninsula at the time (with the exception of the very worn Makara near the Stadhuys in Malacca). Since the building was built on white sand, we may assume that it was located by a river or sandbank. What Pak Kombong may have there- fore seen was just its entrance (hence the 'Gate'). The orchards described by Capt. Ahmad would thus be located slightly further inland from this spot, thence leading to the other structural remains reportedly there. 15 I stand partially corrected on this point. While discussing the matter with various officials during my initial briefing at the Muzium Negara on 19 January 2004, I was told that a number of (failed) attempts had indeed been made to look for the site of Kota Gelanggi; the most recent misfortune saw the boat carrying equip- ment for the expedition team capsizing thrice over, which was enough to discourage the team from venturing any further. That being said, I was also informed that on-site surveys have only reached Sayong Pinang, 35 kilome- tres downstream from the area I had personally identified and explored (quo vide). 16 Naturally, there are a number of private reservations and misgivings over the future prospects of any endeavour in this direction. Recent developments in archaeological ventures elsewhere are not encouraging. In one deplorable example, Souvaltzi's (2002) excavation of a Macedonian mausoleum at the Oasis of Siwa in Egypt was completely sabotaged and artefacts looted before she was given a fair opportunity to verify her find- ings. Similarly, this 'quest' for the real Kota Gelanggi may be viewed negatively as nothing but a 'fantasy trip' and that 'lost cities' no longer exist. But the facts should nevertheless be appraised accordingly, rather than dismissed outright with nary a ponder.

Before we proceed, one geographical point must be flagged. The coastal shoreline and riverine reaches of the Malay Peninsula, even as recently as a thousand years ago, were vastly different from what we presume to know of them today. The proposed sites for Kota Gelanggi may seem entirely and incomprehensibly isolated too far inland from our present standpoint - or, as Quaritch- Wales (1940: 58-9) had scoffed: 'We now come to the upper reaches of the Johor River, particularly its tributary the Sungai Lenggiu, far up which the mysterious Black Stone Fort is locally supposed to be situated. In view of the absurdity of locating a city in a practically uninhabitable region, many miles up a stream navigable only by sampans, far from the reach of sea-going trading ships, I had no intention of adding my name to those of the select and optimistic few who had set out in search for this elusive phantom, unless some definite information on which to base a plan of campaign could be obtained.' But in this respect, it is often forgotten that the Sungei Johor is, in fact, largely an arm of the sea. Moreover, it is entirely possible that when Kota Gelanggi was reportedly at its peak (c. AD 1000), the four sites identified in central Johor were assuredly well with- in reasonable reach of ocean-going vessels.18 A parallel situation has been postulated about the geography of the Lembah Bujang by Khoo (1996: 347) in his authoritative and meticulously argued paper, 'Geomorpholog- ical evolution of the Merbok estuary area and its impact on the early state of Kedah, north- west Peninsular Malaysia': 'Considering several lines of evidence from field data to historical and archaeological evidence, it is interpreted that the fall in sea level from 2-3 metres to the present level [in the Lembah Bujang] was relatively rapid (200 years or less) compared with periods of still-stand. The reconstruction of the palaeo-shoreline also helps to clarify geographical features described in the ancient Kedah Annals [Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa], which appear to contain eye-witness accounts of regression of the sea-level and not fairy-tales as believed by several eminent commentators.' Although the Sungei Johor and its estuary are yet to be subjected under equally probing geological analysis, it would not be too far-fetched to argue that the same theory and evidence could apply here, given that Kota Gelanggi was meant to have flourished contemporaneously with the Hindu citadel at the Lembah Bujang in Kedah, i.e. c. AD 900-1200 (cf. Hamdan Sheikh Tahir, 1980). Having considered all these factors accordingly, a brief expedition was mounted late in September 2003 to investigate certain geographical anomalies detected in the most arresting of the four locations cited above. This private, self-supported venture came in the wake of two personal aerial surveys of the said area. Photographic material obtained from these fly-overs produced startling results. Unusual geometric patterns and baffling structures were detected semi-hidden and 18 For a discussion of a trans-peninsular route located nearby, see Thomaz (Í995: 79-124). Cf. McGee (1985), Suarez (1999: 187-9) and Wheatley (1955). Also see Pasquale (1938: Quadro Iva- Asia Centrale Meridionale e Orientale Tavola XVI), where Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), cartographer and founder of the Roman Catholic Missions in China, marks the City of 'Loi' as lying adjacent to Malacca and located at the end of a river flowing eastwards into the depths of the Malay Peninsula. The following intriguing description is also given: 'Sanfuzi cioè l'antico Cantouli cambiato oggi in Vecchio Porto governato da un Pacificatore.' The mid- sixteenth-century India Tercera Nvova Tavola (ca. 1561) has a city named 'Polepi' drawn below Malacca (Rex Nan Kivell 11605). 50</page><page sequence="25">JMBRAS VOL. 77 blanketed by the thick jungle growth below. The most compelling of these photographs depicted, what resembles to be, a 'boxed' set of clearly defined 'double walls', that is, a large rectangular structure encasing a smaller version within (see Fig. 7). On the one hand, these visuals seemed to betray the precise handiwork of a pedan- tic timber logger with an uncommon penchant and unnerving skill for landscape architec- ture.19 On the other, the regular grid-like symmetry and undeniably contrived shape of these forms inarguably warranted a closer inspection of the terrain; at the very least to evaluate the archaeological worth (or lack thereof) of this particular site.20 The impetus thus provided, a ground reconnaissance was conducted, though with restrictions emerging at every turn. After overcoming the isolation, steep elevation, and dense foliage of the area, traces of substantial human intrusion were found to be much in evidence, with deep strong ditches and earthen embankments in abundance. So too were various aberrations that may denote the presence of artificial construction covered over by earth and structures embedded underground. In one instance, a square earthen platform framed by a nearby pair of parallel mounds were found neatly aligned, almost as though they were purpose-built, along a well-defined embankment.21 Compare this with Quaritch- Wales' (1937: 95-103) report on the layout of the seventh-century city of Sri Deva, which he discovered and excavated near the Pasak River in the Menam Valley of Thailand: 'The main city was about a mile square, enclosed by great earth and laterite ramparts, which resemble nothing so much as tall green railway embankments, and bordered on the outside by a moat which sometimes reached a hundred yards in breadth ... the four main gateways were now merely gaps in the ramparts ... the 19 Discussions with officials at the Jabatan Perhilitan (Cheras), Pejabat Daerah Kota Tinggi and private sur- veyors who have worked extensively in the district, confirmed that while timber logging activity was sanctioned and managed in the lower reaches of the inspected site, none had - as far as they are aware - officially taken place in the pinpointed area. It should be further stated that the investigated site is also a gazetted Forest Reserve. While it is entirely possible that the physical features found may be the traces of illegal logging (perhaps unknowingly criss-crossing over an ancient site), the extent of the intrusion reflects the residue of a more thor- ough, lasting and exacting enterprise. I am indebted to Low Guan Peng and his colleagues at Jurukur Perunding (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd for kindly and patiently sharing their time and expertise to answer my detailed inquiries. I am further much obliged to them for supervised access to their invaluable in-house map collection. 20 Compare Fig. 7 with the diagrams and plans of Khmer and Cham sites given by Dumarcay (1997), Freeman and Jacques (1999), Guillon (2001), Jessup and Jephin (1997) and Sanday (1997). 21 Kota Gelanggi's purported signature construction feature, granite, was nowhere to be seen above ground along the path trekked by us. Neither could we search along the original riverbanks for traces of a granite quarry nearby, since the banks now lie submerged under 5-8 metres of rotting wood, plants and murky water. However, granite boulders were detected in the ravines on the lower spur of the area explored, particularly along the creek leading to the peak. While the ruins at the peak of Gunung Jerai, Chandi Batu Pahat, Pengkalan Kempas and Kota Tinggi were partly visible above ground thanks to their protruding stonework, these sites had formerly been cleared and felled for forest produce, rubber cultivation or disturbed by human habitation and curiosity when the remains were first noticed. We should not, of course, expect to stumble across a 'lost city 'of Angkor Wat-like dimensions (or sophistication) protruding from the landscape. A more realistic anticipation would be the discovery of loose granite bricks, perhaps some carved but mainly not, lying scattered over large earthern mounds on a series of terraces. These would constitute the remnants of the inner sanctum of the 'city'. The homes of the general populace, mainly constructed of wood and attap , would have long disintegrated, leaving only traces of domestic residue underground. The city walls, if there are any left intact, were meant to have been built of granite. But since no such pre-Malaccan structure of this nature or these dimensions have ever been found on the peninsula, it would be difficult to speculate as to what it may resemble. However, a close approximation would be to study surviving examples of early Cham architecture. 51</page><page sequence="26">PART 2, 2004 temple itself, on its laterite base, was situated on an extensive earthen platform raised about three feet from the ground, and on it were a number of laterite bases, no doubt the foundations of various little wooden shrines and pavilions....' Coincidentally, when he had first set eyes on it, the 'Lost City' of Sri Deva was lying 'in the remote, secluded valley of an unnavigable river' (Quaritch- Wales, 1937: 92). Notwithstanding these teasers, the temperamental weather, lack of time, resources and professional support on this occasion curtailed efforts to attempt any on-the-spot excavations or to venture further into the tangled jungle.22 Consequently, the key focus of the expedition - to reach and verify the actual nature of the 'double walls' described above, had to be suspended although another week's trek would have sufficed to reach it. At the time of writing, discussions are being finalized with the relevant authorities to coordinate a follow-up survey of the area, in the hope that solid evidence may be uncov- ered to explain the irregularities sighted, either way. Until then, the weight of textual and physical evidence tips the balance in favour of a multi-disciplinary reassessment of previous studies on Kota Gelanggi and the substance of its existence in Johor. For should this 'lost city' be found, the intricate nature of our pre-Malaccan past, mutandi mutandis our existing ideas of the region's historical mien, would have to submit itself to a radical re-evaluation. These factors, in turn, oblige us to approach all future explorations and searches for the 'lost city' of Kota Gelanggi in a comprehensive and heritage-focused manner, in line with internationally regulated and accepted standards of heritage preservation, restoration, and conservation. By adopting such a stance, the jungles of Johor could be persuaded to yield their secrets; and we may finally catch more than just a scribbled glimpse of this mythical ancient city in the mists.23 22 Being mindful as well of Solheim's (1960: 17-18) admonition, 'The layman with an interest in the histo- ry or prehistory of Malaya would be of great help in working out the archaeology of Malaya, as long as he has forbearance. He must not excavate' If he does, he does irreparable damage. Without unlimited funds, archaeol- ogists depend to a considerable degree on information received from the interested layman for the location of sites.' See the Antiquities Act (1976) Revised 1998, Part III Article 9: 'Excavations: Subject as hereinafter provided, no person shall excavate for the purpose of discovering antiquities, whether on land of which he is the owner or occupier or otherwise, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Director General [of Museums, Malaysia].'
