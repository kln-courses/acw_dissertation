<plain_text><page sequence="1">CIRCA 6 "Works of art remain afloat on a sea of words. Those refractory facts, art works, are launched into the treacherous currents of language with its sudden undertows, backwaters, and shifting mainstreams. Works will sink out of sight, cause ripples or even occasional tidal waves. But this trackless, navigational nightmare is not without direction. For below, silently at work, is that force which waits for no man: the tidal pull toward judgment which assigns to works a certain coefficient of power measured in terms of cold cash and those slippery verbal chips to be redeemed for a piece of history." ? Robert Morris In the intimate relationship between Art and Money, there is no doubt that Art is the subordinate partner. The lack of a strong visual tradition in Irish culture over the last few centuries is due mostly to the lack of surplus wealth in the economy, exasperated by British economic control during the 19th century. (This is an important and contentious point, but cannot be discussed here in any depth. John Turpin's article, Unbeautiful Ireland?History or Apathy?, published in The Crane Bag Vol. 6 No. 1 1982, covers the finer points of the argument very welt.) Art production, and especially sculptural work, relies primarily on the availability of this surplus wealth for direct support and for the provision of resources. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that within the limited tradition of Irish visual art, sculpture hasn't had much of a chance to develop. (In fact, there is virtually no discernible sculptural tradition since the later period of Celtic art, around the 11th and 12th centuries). The situation today is that resources are still very limited. Consequently, sculptural activity is largely restricted to small-scale academic dabbling and the proliferation of cute coffee-table ornaments in the guise of 'serious' work. Alternatively, faced with the lack of sculptural 'history', some artists have drifted into a kind of neo-Celtic Twilight, referring back (usually innocuously) to the 'wonders' of an earlier culture. There are exceptions, of course. Some serious and ambitious artists here have attempted to push sculpture into new and fresh areas. (Deirdre O'Connell, in her companion article, discusses some of their work). But, who are their role models, whose work do they look to for 'inspiration', who are they reacting against? It's a sad but inevitable fact that most sculptors making interesting work in Ireland today rely on outside (international) artists and activities to measure their achievements by. This does not necessarily lessen or contribute to the 'Irishness' of their work, which cannot be quantified or qualified. What it effectively does is either enrich or impoverish the sculptural 'vocabulary' available to Irish artists, within an Irish cultural context. Some of the main outside influences over recent years can be roughly plotted. -O In 1969, Robert Morris made an environmental work called Steam, which, according to Sam Hunter in his book American Art of The 20th Century, "offered nothing more than hot air and promised, according to the catalogue, to fill the available space". Hot air, as a metaphor, could easily be applied to a lot of American Minimal sculpture of the late 60s. Its main purpose seemed to be to fill the available gallery space, and little else. However, its initial driving impulse, as exemplified by the works of Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris and others, was to de-structure certain assumptions about sculptural activity and to challenge the emotional, expressive, anthropomorphic and transcendental content of earlier American art (influenced by Abstract Expressionism). It offered instead, rationality, serial progressions, 'anonymous' industrial finish, and a manipulation of spatial perception in a highly organised way. Real space, virtual space, architectural space, cultural/social space and, later, topographical space were all invoked; and Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception became required reading. Minimalism reached its apotheosis in the work of the famous brick-man Carl Andre, who claimed at one stage that his sculpture was "atheistic, materialistic, and communistic". This was probably polemics, but his "droning, complacent piles and squares of this and that" (Robert Hughes) were a considered attempt to achieve an art devoid of metaphor or association. An impossible task, but one which, given the 'success' of Minimalism and its off-shoots, seemed to finger a certain pulse within American culture?a thinly disguised streak of puritan morality, a kind of analytical, impersonalised W.A.S.P. mentality reflected and reinforced by the American cityscape. The necessary theoretical underpinning ("the sea of words") and the radical posturing implicit in much Minimal work led eventually to ephemeral installation work (like Steam), Process art (like Richard Serra's Casting and most of Eva Hesse's work), and then Conceptual art. On the other hand, the large scale, physicality, and spatial manipulation in Minimal art developed into Land art (like Walter De Maria's Lightning Field) and the famous Earthworks of Robert Smithson and Michael Heizer. Ironically, these hugely ambitious projects, designed to escape "cultural confinement" (Smithson) by the museums and to respond in some adequate fashion to the immense space of the American continent, were eventually represented through photographs as heroic, romantic gestures motivated by some powerful American drive towards a transcendental experience. These shifts in American avant-garde art are well documented in the art-history books. What concerns us here is their possible influence on Irish sculpture. Obviously their basic impulses, and what Walter De Maria. 'The Lightning Field' West Central New Mexico, 1977. Robert Morris.

Rather their appearance, their 'look', their morphology, and their experimental use of materials were absorbed (mostly through books and magazines) and spread like a kind of visual osmosis. This was probably reinforced by the experimental parallels and morphological similarities seen in the art of some very influential European sculptors, like Joseph Beuys and the Italian Art Povera artists, including Mario Merz and Jannis Kounellis.

Their anarchic, mobile relationship to a stratified and diverse art historical and political/cultural background simply could not be paralleled in Ireland with its comparative lack of art-historical material and its Irish/British cultural see-saw. The profound differences between American and European sculptural practices during the late 60s and the 70s was probably of no real consequence in Ireland. The more than occasional similarity of 'appearance' was sufficient and influential. This has a lot to do, again, with the lack of a strong visual tradition here and the consequent lack of an intellectual tradition capable of dealing effectively with the vagaries and the epistemological complexities of visual artworks (those "refractory facts"). If the work of Morris, Smithson, Andre, Serra and associates was, by and large, analytic, materialistic and impersonalised, whereas the work of Beuys, Merz and Kounellis etc. was largely based on symbolism, metaphor and individual 'sensibility', then what were the impulses behind the experimentation with similar forms and materials that was evident in the work of young Irish sculptors in the 70s? Indeed, does it matter now what other influences, less experimental, are obvious? It matters in the sense that the cultural acceptance of 'appearance' art, 'cardboard' art, leads inevitably to more 'cardboard' art, and possibly to a cardboard culture. This has, in fact, happened to a small degree, but it must be emphasised that there has also</page><page sequence="3">CIRCA 8 been a genuine questioning of sculptural conventions going on in Ireland. This should and could be consolidated by a continuing dialogue between artists (and other interested parties), plus a rejection of facile look-alike gestures. -o The second major influence in Irish sculpture during the 70s seems to have been 'formalist' work, mostly welded steel constructions (as exemplified by Anthony Caro and early Phillip King), or constructed wooden sculpture, or a combination of both. Put simply, 'formalism' in sculpture was originally an American phenomenon, fed by early abstract art and perpetuated by the likes of Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried. Informed by a variation on the same theme of "dialectical necessity" as used by the Minimalist/Conceptualist camp, it eventually proposed the work of artists like Caro as the pinnacle of modernist sensibility. Robert Smithson called the formalists "parodies of modernists" and, in 1968, he criticised the equation of "technological ideology" with 'progress', implicit in the work of David Smith and Anthony Caro. Rather, he claimed that their artistic ideology contained a false sense of 'progress', in fact a "dissolution of progress". In England, Caro's work has been associated (by Peter Fuller) with Harold Wilson's famous "white-heat of the technological revolution" speech, made in 1963. Caro's 'radical abstraction' has been seen as a challenge to the tradition of anthropomorphic and mimetic sculpture, and his works were regarded as subtle metaphors for body movements or bodily sensations. Taken as a whole, his mature work could also readily be seen as a metaphor for a kind of cheerful confidence in modern technological processes and modern industry. But, by 1975, when William Tucker staged his Condition of Sculpture exhibition in the Hayward Gallery, London, this kind of welded steel sculpture (and other constructed sculpture) had become endemic in British galleries, museums, and art colleges. Its concerns had become almost totally academic, and its original range of metaphorical content, except in rare cases, was brutalised into non-existence. Seen in museums now, most of these works appear repetitive and lifeless. As Smithson said in his essay, The Monuments of Passaic, "Time turns metaphors into things and stacks them up in cold rooms". The impulses behind the original formalist 'campaign' are, once again, foreign to Irish art?modernism has not yet become the 'official culture' here as Robert Hughes claims it has for other Western capitalist countries (even though some Irish artists are now talking about post-modernism). But 'abstract' welded or constructed sculpture with its 'modern' look and its aura of 'progress', however vague, would obviously appeal to certain commercial or civic organisations intent on a modern image in a comparatively young state. Consequently, in the South of Ireland, this kind of work is quite frequently purchased by companies, and some of the most recent public sculpture, sponsored by companies, has been of this kind. At its best, public sculpture of this sort 'brightens the place up' and sometimes has a kind of imposing elegance; at its worst, it looks superfluous ?a flower in the buttonhole of institutional or corporate power. Abstract' constructed sculpture of a formalist kind is also quite common, on a more modest scale, in some Dublin galleries, but, inevitably, its implications in any wider context are rarely discussed and the many variations, successes and failures within the 'genre' largely go unnoticed. Installation work, Performance art, and Body art have been given considerable attention in international art since around the early 60s when Happenings were happening all over the place. When Yves Klein leapt into the void in 1962 he set a precedent for the artist as hero/buffoon/ paranoic nuisance/mystic traveller/social conscience/living sculpture that is still with us today. Joseph Beuys' Actions' (usually tableau performances) and 'social sculptures' (usually lectures and guest appearances) have set him apart as an artist of great charisma, great influence and, unfortunately, great pretensions. Dennis Oppenheim, Vito Acconci, Richard Long, Gilbert and George, and Stuart Brisley, among others, have been major influences in the momentum of performance, installation, body art and related fields, within a loose sculptural framework. Once again, their impulses have been mixed and varied but usually shaped by and specific to their cultural backgrounds. Thus, while Richard Long was taking long 'poetic' walks in the English countryside in 1969, Vito Acconci was following people around New York City, probably terrifying some of them. Oppenheim's "delirious operations" (Jonathan Crary) were geared to American scale and aggressiveness, Gilbert and George's brand of fey eccentricity is peculiarly English arty-farty theatricality taken to its limits, and Brisley's work reflects a profound awareness of the alienation possible within a bureaucratic, class ridden, consumer society. -o Installation, performance and body art have now been generally accepted in Ireland as important areas within the visual art scene. Possibly (though this is debateable), the aforementioned lack of resources for more conventional sculptural activity and its lack of A Mario Mer/, Mai alzato pietra su pietra' Mixed media, 1968. l^i^i^iiM^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^KK^^^^^SUH^?'^'.:i _____________________K^-'_is^fe^^'* * # &lt;v ? y^^ * -ma ^^^^^I^M-_________________l J^3I__S8__3*'"-". _______________H_fe^'i^fl^o" fe&gt; " ^ '"^ * % *" 9i?#^^IS_i^___M_^_^_H '^IS^I^^K''"'^ ' '''' ____________________9_l_l^_^%\ /-*"^ %ii__^ *^ * / &gt;* f " Y*'L&gt; l-i.^ S_^^s^^l8______________l JSSilllS:!* ffl-BKIEil^flByf' ';:.:' '.-.,' _______________________________li_^^^M.1^- ' ' ^*^N___. ^ "Mfe*v 1 ft ,W x:.::l$rWBr ^ J^Mj^^^^^^^B .

'Trefoil', painted steel. 1968. 'glamour' have pushed a lot of younger artists and students to concentrate on performance art, or more ephemeral art pieces. The constant hassle of studio space, equipment, overheads, and storage problems is thus avoided to a great degree. This is not to denigrate the work being done ?in fact, it provides a very healthy alternative, capable of sniping at complacent attitudes within both the art complex and the general social environment. As with the other work discussed, one of the main problems is the lack of a sympathetic working environment, meaning, in this case, a lack of suitable venues and also a lack of contact with or discourse with other fields of activity (e.g. music, dance, theatre, TV.) which could encourage the various practitioners to a high degree of professionalism. Of course, the practitioners may not want to become professionalised ?the informal, ad-hoc and 'non-commercial' nature of much performance art presentation and of some installation work could be their strongest asset in an increasingly institutionalised cultural structure. However, the price to be paid for this kind of independence is limited availability (i.e. small audiences and a kind of mythical status achieved through photographs and second-hand reportage. So, the same gritty questions about basic impulses and motivations come up again, and once again in the form of generalisations which can only be the starting points for further discussion. Are these 'ephemeral' art-forms basically a resistance to a commercialised culture? Are they seen as such by their audience, or are they seen as some kind of modish by-products of international experimental-art expansionism, soon to be exhausted. Breaking-down-the-limits -of-art manoeuvrings are sometimes ridiculous, sometimes interesting, and occasionally effective in some small way in a general social context. When Joseph Beuys was punched on the nose during the Fluxus Festival of New Art in Aachen, Germany in 1964, it was the beginning of an unusual and controversial involvement with political/cultural issues, which led to his recent association with the Green party. When Laurie Anderson's oblique 'performance art' comments on American culture were adapted for recording, she became a reluctant pop star virtually overnight. It seems that chords can be struck, channels can be tapped, nerve-ends can be activated ?if the resources are available and if priorities can be established. -o Within the last few years, international sculpture has undergone some drastic shifting of priorities. Post-modernism is now the key word, and with the advent of New Image painting came a sudden necessity for New Image sculpture which duly appeared on the scene, mostly under the aegis of the Lisson Gallery in London. As Michael Newman has pointed out, British society may be on the decline, but the fragmented debris from its disintegrating industries has now become some of its most potent exports, via the manipulations of Bill Woodrow, Tony Cragg, Jean-Luc Vilmouth and Richard Deacon. Some of their work, made mostly from scavenged materials, may appear trivial (especially Vilmouth's), but it indicates a kind of post-industrial anxiety about the built-in obsolescence of everything around us, including our assumed identities.

Parallel with this, Anish Kapoor offers a rich, sensuous 'spirituality' as an antidote to the over-riding anxiety, while Antony Gormley goes looking for its existential dimension with his plaster and lead figures, grey and introverted, almost catatonic. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, moves are being made to reinvigorate some of the old guard by the propagation of a brash 'metaphorical' sculpture steeped in technological-rundown anxiety and nuclear holocaust projections. In a 1981 show, in Washington, called Metaphor: New Projects by Contemporary Sculptors, Alice Aycock and Dennis Oppenheim showed installation pieces of wildly moving, dislocated machinery, similar to their previous work but now seeming somehow more 'topical'; and the ubiquitous Robert Morris showed a piece which included "Nazi-helmeted human y_? i. , ?: "*.'\'t/_i ?r $ ? ' ' \ Tony Cragg. Britain seen from the North', 1981 Antony Gormley. Three Ways'. Plaster and Lead. 1982 skeletons astride nuclear warheads". More recently in Germany, Joseph Beuys made an installation entitled The End of the 20th Century, followed, this year, by another work which apparently looked like a lead-lined torture chamber. These latest developments in sculpture (if indeed they can be considered unequivocally as such), coupled with the latest crazy painting, signal a certain disquiet behind the we-can-cope facade of Western society as it rides the latest economic slump. Not for the first time in Western art there seems to be a broad consensus that something's not quite *' ' ' ?... _w _*.- ' ' right with the world. Skeletons (both human and industrial) are being pulled from cupboards, almost as a common strategy, and pushed around as representative images of art in the 80s. Similar signals of disquiet have been apparent in recent Irish art, though not so pronounced and not so much in sculpture. Perhaps the limited exhibition system is choking the signals; perhaps witty new-image antics or leaden gloom are simply not compatible with the Irish brand of economic depression; perhaps sculptors here will find their own original ways to express the prevailing moods and anxieties of Irish society. Perhaps they already have. D Micky Donnelly is an artist who also writes about art. Since completing his M.A. in Sculpture in 1981 he has been living and working in Belfast.</page></plain_text>
