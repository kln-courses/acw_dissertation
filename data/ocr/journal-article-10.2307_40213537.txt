<plain_text><page sequence="1">DECONSTRUCTING DECONSTRUCTION: ZHUANG Zl AS BUTTERFLY, NIETZSCHE AS GADFLY Sandra A. Wawrytko Department of Philosophy, San Diego State University The movement known as Deconstruction is generally regarded as among the most significant philosophical focal points of the late twentieth century. The influence of the movement has been felt far beyond philosophy, revolutionizing such fields as lit- erary criticism, cultural studies, and even mathematics. An overwhelming tendency exists to view deconstruction and destruction as a continuum, on the assumption that to deconstruct is to destroy. Deconstruction certainly seems intent on the death of definitive meaning, absolute truth, theoretical flights, and universal values. Corre- spondingly, the cowered critics of deconstruction seem to be defending their chosen fields, most especially science and analytic philosophy, from destructive assaults. Christopher Norris characterizes these fears as follows: [W]e have reached a point where theory has effectively turned against itself, generating a form of extreme epistemological skepticism which reduces everything - philosophy, pol- itics, criticism, and "theory" alike - to a dead level of suasive or rhetorical effect where consensus-values are the last (indeed the only) court of appeal.1 According to this reading, Postmodernism qualifies as an extended postmortem, with philosophy as one among many cadavers. The acknowledged father of the Deconstruction movement, Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), has a more nuanced view, as shown by his remarks on philosophy: Those who think they stand outside institutions are sometimes those who interiorize its norms and programs in the most docile manner. Whether it is done in a critical or decon- structive way, the questioning of philosophy's relation to itself is a trial of the institution, of its paradoxes as well, for I try to show nonetheless what is unique and finally untenable in the philosophical institution: it is there that this institution must be a counter-institution, one which may go so far as to break, in an asymmetrical fashion, all contracts and cast suspicion on the very concept of institution. And then, however untenable it may be, it is in this institution that I live 2 If deconstruction were simply a form of destruction, where would Derrida live? Others have supported the interpretation of deconstruction as an "undoing": "The deconstruction of a text does not proceed by random doubt or generalized skepti- cism, but by a careful teasing out of warring forces of signification within the text it- self. If anything is destroyed in a deconstructive reading, it is not meaning but the claim to unequivocal domination of one mode of signifying over another."3 However, for Derrida, the deconstructive task reaches far beyond the confines of the text, to which most scholars have relegated it. After Deconstruction's popularity 524 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 58, Number 4 October 2008 524-551 Â© 2008 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">peaked in the 1970s and 1980s, he defended his movement against those who her- alded its demise. Simultaneously he acknowledged the intimate intertwining of deconstruction and death: "All my writing is on death. If I don't reach the place where I can be reconciled with death, then I will have failed. If I have one goal it is to accept death and dying."4 It is noteworthy that Derrida's desire for reconciliation avoids a futile denial of death, seeking instead an acceptance of both death and dying. In the present context the term "deconstruction" will be applied very broadly, referring to a careful probing of our generally accepted constructs. Mark C. Taylor observes: By attempting to de-construct both the constructive subject and the horrifying world it has created, Derrida points beyond the certainty of absolute knowledge to the uncer- tainty of post-modernity Deconstruction repeatedly demonstrates the impossibility of modernity by soliciting the other which, though never present, "always already" haunts presence Derrida is the postman whose letters bear a message that never arrives.5 Despite the Postmodern connection, versions of the deconstructive task have been addressed and applied by philosophers throughout history and across cultures. By examining their approaches we may be able to decide whether deconstruction must bring destruction in its wake, or whether another outcome might be possible. To test this hypothesis I have chosen to compare the approach of the Chinese philos- opher Zhuang Zi (399-295 b.c.e.) with that of the European philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). Zhuang Zi's views resonate with a deconstructionist ques- tioning of language and thinking, while Nietzsche often has been cited as an impor- tant influence on the development of Derrida's philosophy.6 Despite the myriad differences distinguishing Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche - including their time periods, cultural contexts, and philosophical orientations- both were deconstruction ists par excellence. Both practiced what Norris refers to as "extreme epistemological skepticism" and what Derrida views as a questioning of the untenable. In a truly radical way (tracing the etymology of "radical" to its Greek source, radix, or root), both were intent on getting to the root of reality. To do so they were willing and eminently able to probe, poke, and question the most dearly held assumptions and institutions of their respective cultures, as well as those of human beings in general. Their challenges constitute an expose, bearing the promise of dis- closure and revelation. For example, in seeking to transcend the antagonistic ethical dualisms of the Confucian and Mohist schools, Zhuang Zi concludes: "if we want to right their wrongs and wrong their rights, then the best thing to use is clarity. . . . The torch of chaos and doubt- that is what the sage steers by."7 Similarly, Nietzsche refers to the Twilight of the Idols (Die Gotzen-Dammerung) (1 888) as "a great decla- ration of war" aimed at "the sounding out of idols, ... not just idols of the age, but eternal idols, which are here touched with a hammer as with a tuning fork."8 The methods by which Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche pursue their respective decon- structive tasks point to a deeper issue of contrasting cultural assumptions and grounding principles. By comparing their methodologies we may come to a better Sandra A. Wawrytko 525</page><page sequence="3">understanding of what lies at the heart of the philosophical divide between "East" and "West," reflected in what I have termed Either/Or versus Both/And logics. The deconstruction/destruction continuum assumes that we either grasp the real mean- ing of a text or no such meaning exists; either we have sound theories of truth or truth is nonexistent; an interpretation either is right or it is wrong; either we win the debate or we are on the losing side. This deep-seated dualism permeating Amero- Eurocentric culture and thinking, privileging one view over all others, is what Der- rida was intent on deconstructing. But did he, or Nietzsche, succeed in escaping the very downfall they diagnosed in their own discipline? Their own culture? Did they unconsciously slip back into a destructive mode when they thought they were deconstructing or disassembling deluded constructs? Derrida's case is beyond the scope of this essay (although his long-sought reconciliation resonates with Both/ And logic). However, we will pose these questions with regard to Nietzsche as a rep- resentative of Europe's philosophical heritage. Both/And logic offers the possibility of nondualistic deconstruction. By exposing the delusory, or untenable, quality of constructs, their hold on us is dissolved. We neither cling to them nor do we need to demolish them. Such is the general approach of Daoist philosophy, which is cognizant of the inherent complexities of reality as both perceived and conceived. Viewed in the context of the deficiencies of language and the relativity of perspectives, meaning both does and does not exist. The same may be said of truth, rightness/wrongness, and winning/losing.9 Zhuang Zi's goal of reconciling seeming opposites, or, more precisely, revealing their preexisting congruity, is clearly set forth in the second chapter of the Zhuang Zi. Aptly titled "Discussion on Making All Things Equal" (Qi Wu Lun), the text addresses the tendency "to wear out your brain trying to make things into one with- out realizing that they are all the same."10 To undo (wu-wei) this damage, one needs to unthink the dualities constructed by cunning intellect (zhi).'1'1 The dualistic as- sumption that we can either work against the natural flow (zi-ran) or with that flow is dismissed. Because we are of and in Dao we must participate in, play within, zi- ranP Hence, Zhuang Zi advises us to eschew the futility of arguments and self- imposed limitations, then "Leap into the boundless and make it your home!"14 Nietzsche appears equally intent on undoing the damage of past philosophizing, as in his discussion of the noumenal "true world" under the heading "The History of an Error."15 However, the textual evidence strongly suggests that he hit a glass ceil- ing instead. Having seen the Promised (deconstructed) Land beyond dualism from the mountain top, he was unable to reach it himself. Martin Heidegger (1889- 1976) shared this assessment of Nietzsche's philosophical limitations. In his essay "The Word of Nietzsche: 'God is Dead/" Heidegger characterizes Nietzsche's chal- lenge to Platonism as "a mere countermovement" that "remains, as does everything 'anti,' held fast in the essence (Wesen) of that over against which it moves," which constitutes "an inextricable entanglement."16 As Lao Zi observes in the Dao Dejing, each extreme (like the poles of Either/Or logic) generates and sustains its opposite.17 The lingering dynamic of dualism also is reflected in Nietzsche's insistence on espousing the label of Nihilism - saying "no" to entrenched assumptions. Interest- 526 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="4">ingly, Heidegger deems Nihilism "the fundamental movement of the history of the West/'17 consistent with Either/Or logic. Heidegger views Nietzsche's "overturning (Umkehrung) of metaphysics" as the end of the essentiality of metaphysics and an entry into "disarray."18 To borrow Heidegger's own metaphor, while Nietzsche excels at plowing "the unavoidable predominance of the land of metaphysics," he does not participate in "an unobtrusive sowing."19 I will attempt to demonstrate that Zhuang Zi did take that additional step when deconstructing the claims of his philo- sophical opposition. Despite Nietzsche's apparent understanding of the metaphysical malaise of his own tradition, he appears to have been trapped in a kind of time warp between the aims of ancient and modern philosophy. This is perhaps best demonstrated in his puzzling advocacy of the "eternal recurrence" (die ewige Wiederkunft), "the doc- trine 'of the unconditioned and infinitely reiterated circulation of all things.'"20 Hei- degger, who identifies this as "the fundamental doctrine in Nietzsche's philosophy," considers it a reversion to Plato's obsession with eternality, citing as evidence Nietz- sche's pronouncement: "To stamp Becoming with the character of Being - that is the supreme will to power." 2^ Early on Nietzsche extolled his indebtedness to the early Greek philosophers: "what they invented was the archetypes of philosophic thought. All posterity has not made an essential contribution to them since."22 In the role of "well-loaded" camel, Nietzsche takes on the burdens of the past, reverently and self- effacingly following the dictates of the great dragon "thou shalt." Yet, as his philo- sophical metamorphosis unfolds, Nietzsche as lion comes to challenge the dragon with "I will," in an Either/Or scenario of "Yes"/"No" vis-a-vis the values of his heri- tage. Although he seems finally to glimpse the possibility of creating new values through the child, who harbors "a sacred 'Yes,'" I will argue that Nietzsche never fully experienced the final transition. The adherence to Either/Or logic generates behaviors and consequences that vary greatly from those of Both/And logic. Consider a phenomenon that has unfortu- nately begun to proliferate in the field of mountain climbing, specifically among those seeking to "conquer" Nature in the form of Mount Everest. In May 2006 two tragic cases of dying climbers were reported. The first involved British climber David Sharp, who slowly froze to death as forty other climbers trudged past him. Appar- ently they decided that they could either try to rescue him, at the cost of their own ascent, or continue on. Ten days later Australian Lincoln Hall similarly was aban- doned by his companions, who left him for dead. However Hall was more fortunate; American Dan Mazur gave up his Everest dreams to stay with the barely alive Hall until help arrived.23 Evidence drawn mainly from the inner chapters of the Zhuang Zi places Zhuang Zi under the rubric of Both/And logic as he attempts to bring his beloved enemy along with him, resulting in a win-win scenario. For Zhuang Zi, deconstructing the errors of cunning intellect does not require the destruction of intellect.24 Nor does exposing dysfunctional thinking mean that the thinker of such thoughts is irretriev- ably lost. In this regard Zhuang Zi resonates with Lao Zi's descriptions of the Daoist sage in the Dao Dejing as one who does not abandon people (chapter 27), treating Sandra A. Wawrytko 527</page><page sequence="5">both the good and the not good equally well so they may realize their goodness (chapter 49). By remaining wu-wei the sage allows for the natural transformation of others (chapter 57), is "four-square without piercing" (chapter 58). The same cannot be said for Nietzsche in his innumerable encounters with his philosophical foes. Like Zarathustra, Nietzsche seems resigned to a solo ascent, without the sense of "profound identity" (xuan-tong) that Lao Zi considers an emu- lation of Dao (Dao Dejing, chapter 56). To validate these claims we must examine their respective views of and attitudes toward their opponents - will they be left to their solitary demise or be embraced as fellow travelers? The Strategy of Fruitful Opposition We will begin with an overview of the shared strategy of Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche in meeting opposition to their views. Even philosophers of their caliber were wisely wary of trying to take on the world en masse. If one seeks to confront and confound deeply entrenched majority opinions, a subtly effective strategy involves simulating a one-on-one confrontation with concrete embodiments of these opinions. It is espe- cially useful to focus on "high-value targets," since besting such icons would make deep inroads into the opposing camp. Prominently positioned among Zhuang Zi's beloved philosophical adversaries we find Zhuang Zi's predecessor, Confucian pa- triarch Kong Zi (Confucius) (551-479 b.c.e.), and his contemporary, the logician Hui Zi (380-305 b.c.e.), of the School of Names (ming-jia). Nietzsche's list is much longer, ranging from the ancients (Socrates, Plato) to classic thinkers (Immanuel Kant, Benedict de Spinoza) and contemporaries (Arthur Schopenhauer). These are not simply historical figures, but revered founders of pivotal schools of philosophy, personifying the values and methodologies being challenged. Their selection is consistent with Nietzsche's view that individuals are embodiments of problematic positions.25 Much can be learned about our philosophers and their cultural contexts by ana- lyzing their interactions with their opponents. In parodying the opposition, Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche clarify their own positions. Each reacts to his philosophical "other" in a unique fashion, characteristic of their own literary styles and a certain set of philosophic priorities. Zhuang Zi is a fluttering yin butterfly, who invites us to play.26 Ever receptive and flexible, imbued with wu-wei effortless action, the but- terfly has no purpose beyond its own play. The famous butterfly dream passage (Zhuang Zhou meng die) that ends chapter 2 resonates with Both/And logic. The newly awakened Zhuang Zi is at first uncertain whether he is a human who dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a human. Zhuang Zi ultimately rejects this false dilemma, embracing the underlying harmony of the "Transforma- tion of Things" (wu-hua).27 He is both butterfly and human, the dreamer and the dream. Zhuang Zi also eschews a fixed or fixated position. Critics have defended Zhuang Zi against the mistaken assumption that he presents a monolithic stance, emphasizing instead how he plays with and meanders among many positions.28 528 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="6">Zhuang Zi incorporates this flexibility into his playful language, an essential aspect of the butterfly's flight pattern. For example, he tells the story of some irate monkeys who protest their rations ("three in the morning and four in the evening"), but are completely content when the numbers are reversed.29 This is followed by convo- luted wordplay on the notions of beginning, being, and nonbeing. Zhuang Zi resists the temptation to settle on one view, the Either/Or option: "Now I have just said something. But I don't know whether what I have said has really said something or whether it hasn't said something."30 Nietzsche, reluctant heir to Socrates, resembles a second generation yang gad- fly, prone to attack mode. In February 1872, making an apparent reference to his de- piction of Socrates in The Birth of Tragedy (Die Geburt der Tragodie aus dem Geiste der Musik)(\&amp;72), Nietzsche enthusiastically exclaims "my Socrates is all of a piece; I feel so strongly the contrast between my description and the others, which all seem so dead and moldy."31 Like Socrates, Nietzsche's role is to goad others to action by well-placed stings. Once aroused, the targets are very likely to retaliate (as Socrates notes in the Apology), following the Either/Or principle that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Nietzsche's wei assertiveness pushes the envelope in pursuit of its ends, making it more difficult for the gadfly to avoid fixation. Nietzsche does defend the pragma- tism of philosophical fluidity: "The snake that cannot shed its skin perishes. So do the spirits who are prevented from changing their opinions; they cease to be spi- rits."32 Nonetheless, unlike Zhuang Zi, he is fond of declarative sentences and prone to unqualified assertions, perhaps the most famous being his pronouncement "God is dead." Both philosophers take flight against a richly diverse, even convoluted, canvas. Outbursts of stupidity and naivete alternate with Daoist insights in the concocted conversations of Zhuang Zi's Kong Zi. According to Burton Watson these are part of Zhuang Zi's philosophical strategy: "The reader must learn to expect any opinion whatsoever from any source, to savor the outrageous incongruities, and to judge for himself which of the opinions offered represents the highest level of enlighten- ment."33 Correspondingly, Nietzsche's depiction of Socrates vacillates between his enshrinement as "the vortex and turning point of Western civilization"34 and the de- nunciation of a sick buffoon "who got himself taken seriously."35 Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche also share a common sense of dismay at the spectacle of their misguided, self-deluded fellow human beings and fellow philosophers. For Zhuang Zi the spiri- tually deaf and blind are symbolized by the little birds in chapter 1, who refuse to acknowledge the Peng bird's astounding capacity for flight. Nietzsche is more vehe- ment, denouncing the "Egypticism" that gives rise to "concept-mummies" - "When these honorable idolaters of concepts worship something, they kill and stuff it; they threaten the life of everything they worship."36 Our butterfly and gadfly demand much more from their audiences. Zhuang Zi opens his text with an invitation to accompany him on a "leisurely stroll" (xiao yao you), the title of the first chapter, concluding with a leisurely nap (xiao yao) under a "useless" tree. The reader must possess fully engaged imagination and free-flowing Sandra A. Wawrytko 529</page><page sequence="7">creativity to appreciate Zhuang Zi's mythic creatures, common critters, historical fig- ures, and fictitious characters featured in charming stories highlighting relativity of perspective, assessments of natural limitations, and the usefulness of the useless. Nietzsche is very specific about his requirements, listing the "three characteristics" of his ideal reader: "He must be tranquil and read without haste. He must not always interpose himself and his 'education/ Finally, at the end he must not expect new tablets as a result/'37 The creative participation required of Zhuang Zi's readers is conspicuously absent from Nietzsche's list. Both distrust dialectic for absurdly seeking to confine reality within logical con- straints. For Nietzsche, "What first must be proved is worth little One chooses dialectic only when one has no other means It can only be self-defense for those who no longer have other weapons/'38 Zhuang Zi playfully explores the intricacies of argumentation, which vainly tries to establish an objective judge of rightness and wrongness (Either/Or). Realizing that no such standard exists, "the sage harmonizes with both right and wrong and rests in Heaven the Equalizer" (Both/And).39 The shared importance of freedom for these two philosophers is significant. Fol- lowing from his radical (root-seeking) critique of prevailing values, Nietzsche's sub- title for Human, AII-too-Human (Menschliches Allzumenschliches) (1878) directs its contents to "free spirits" (freie Ceister). Correspondingly, Burton Watson argues that freedom from the self-imposed bondage of conventional values (the very values Nietzsche seeks to revaluate) is the underlying theme of the Zhuang Zi.40 Yin evoca- tion is the liberating force in Zhuang Zi's approach,41 as well as an expression of thought that has been freed from the bondage of convention by unthinking the errors of cunning intellect. However, in Zarathustra's Three Metamorphoses Nietzsche invokes the yang image of the lion to embody the "creation of freedom for oneself and a sacred 'No' even to duty."42 Like the gadfly, the lion has a particular prey to stalk, the "thou shalt" that burdened the camel. Hence, Nietzsche's freedom rests on demolition, a freedom from past enslavement that is grounded in dualism (either free or enslaved). Zhuang Zi's freedom looks forward rather than fixating on the past. It is a freedom to play, to create, requiring one more step beyond Nietzsche's freedom to reject, namely the metamorphosis to the child (or even further to Lao Zi's infant who has not yet smiled43). Both Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche employ shock treatment to dissolve metaphys- ical myopia. Intellectual provocateurs, they incite mental riots with their verbal "atrocities." Although referring to Thus Spake Zarathustra (Also Sprach Zarathustra) (1883-1885), Nietzsche's advice to his readers seems to hold true for all of his works: "no one should claim to know it who has not been, by turns, deeply wounded and deeply delighted by what it says."44 Earlier he proclaimed "To make the individual uncomfortable, that is my task,"45 linking shock to insult. Zhuang Zi elicits awe and audacity, as his "conversation" between Zhang Wu-zi (Chang Wu- tzu) and Zhu Que-zi (Chu Ch'ueh-tzu) reveals: You see an egg and demand a crowing cock, see a crosspellet and demand a roast dove. I'm going to try speaking some reckless words and I want you to listen to them 530 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="8">recklessly The sage leans on the sun and moon, tucks the universe under his arm, merges himself with things, leaves the confusion and muddle as it is, and looks on slaves as exalted.46 The end result, if successful, is the awakening of the "desire to create something sig- nificant ourselves," without being dependent on the past or others.47 It is important to note that Nietzsche's recklessness seems to be an inherent part of his character, not the utilitarian pose it is for Zhuang Zi. By Zhuang Zi's definition, Nietzsche is assuredly no sage, because he cannot leave "the confusion and muddle as it is." Like the pompous version of Kong Zi, Nietzsche seems to have lingering delusions of grandeur concerning his role in "saving" the world. He not only exhib- its the "strain and struggle" of the ordinary individual,48 but actually revels in them, as will be shown below. Thus, he seems destined for Zhuang Zi's list of would-be reformers and sterling characters who were doomed by their own ambitions: "all of them slaved in the service of other men, took joy in bringing other men joy, but could not find any joy of their own."49 Other significant differences arise in terms of their ultimate aims in question- ing the status quo. Nietzsche's "revaluation of values" strives toward a science of morality - a rather common exercise among European philosophical system- builders, including Plato, Descartes, and Kant. As an iconoclast, he is well aware that the existential denial of ultimate values and universal moral standards must be accomplished without substituting new values to be idolized in turn. The will to power ultimately is taken as his guiding principle in fulfilling this task, even after he had acknowledged that "power makes stupid."50 While Nietzsche declares war on mediocrity, Zhuang Zi lives up to the title of "world philosopher at play" bestowed by Kuang-ming Wu.51 The Daoist's "task," if it can even be stated in such mechanical terms, is not to wrench meaning from a bleak cosmos, but rather to transcend even the desire for ultimate meaning in the face of Dao, which "treats human beings like straw-dogs" (Dao Dejing, chapter 5). Unlike Nietzsche, Zhuang Zi seems comfortable with the fluidity of meaning, having gone beyond the human obsession with creating something (anthropomorphic pur- pose) out of nothing (cosmic purposelessness). He even comes to Derrida's hoped- for reconciliation with death: "How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?"52 Since both power and play are expressions of creativity, Zhuang Zi and Nietz- sche share the ideal of the "thinker-artist" embodied in the True Person and the Obermensch, respectively.53 However, although Nietzsche respects Nature, he can hardly be said to delight in it, the way Zhuang Zi does. The "natural" Dionysian must resort to the artificial oblivion of inebriation to achieve a sense of oneness with reality. By contrast, Zhuang Zi's co-creativity with Nature is effortless (wu- wei), so he is able to discern the pipings of Earth and Heaven beyond those of humans (chapter 2): "Running around accusing others is not as good as laughing, and enjoying a laugh is not as good as going along with things. Be content to go Sandra A. Wawrytko 531</page><page sequence="9">along and forget about change and then you can enter the mysterious oneness of Heaven/'54 Nietzsche and His Predecessors: Wariness and Righteous Wrath Let us examine more closely the distinctive flight patterns of gadfly and butterfly in turn, as they circle their respective targets. We will begin our discussion with the gadfly, due both to his insistent presence and the effusive words expended in making his case. Nietzsche provides cryptic and often contradictory hints of his agenda, consistent with his desire to avoid erecting new idols. By piecing these together we may come to understand why he adopts his adversarial approach. The subtitle of The Twilight of the Idols is exemplary in this respect: "How One Philosophizes with a Hammer" (Wie man mit dem Hammmer philosophiert). Nietzsche's brief explana- tion of this puzzling subtitle, a veritable invitation to misunderstanding, casts the hammer as a tuning fork able to expose the hollowness of philosophical idols. Nietz- sche the iconoclast describes his approach in terms of "prankishness" on the one hand and "war" on the other.55 To place Nietzsche's approach in its proper context, one must recognize his em- ulation of the Greek spirit. He seeks to engage his opponent in the agon that even Socrates could not deny, but merely revise: "the Greek knows the artist only as en- gaged in a personal fight without envy, jealousy, and ambition in the contest, the Hellenic city, like the Hellenic man, degenerates. He becomes evil and cruel."56 Furthermore, Nietzsche's own worth is confirmed by his having chosen someone so formidable; his victory is all the more sweet for having engaged an opponent wor- thy of his best efforts.57 Nietzsche speculates that the impetus for tragedy might lie in "hankering for the enemy (the worth-while enemy) so as to prove its strength, to ex- perience at last what it means to fear something."58 Is this pronouncement self-referential? Certainly Nietzsche does not attach any negative connotations to this strategy when he recognizes it in his philosophical mentor, Arthur Schopenhauer. Rather, it is a sine qua non of philosophizing, at least for some personality types. Nietzsche argues that Schopenhauer required enemies to keep himself healthy, ward off pessimism, and indeed to keep himself alive: "his rage was his balm, his recreation, his compensation, his specific against tedium, in short, his happiness."59 These comments seem equally applicable to Nietzsche. Walter Kaufmann argues that Nietzsche's obvious admiration for Socrates is less a sign of any fundamental agreement with his view than it is a means of adding glory to the contest, while insuring Nietzsche's own survival and happiness.60 Socrates, "the vortex and turning point of Western civilization," is also described as a daring "daemon," "demigod," even "the new Orpheus."61 Nietzsche rhapsodizes about the "errors of great men" being "more fruitful than the truths of little men."62 A passage in Human, All-Too-Human asserts the enno- bling effects of degeneration: "every great progress must be preceded by a partial weakening."63 The truly strong are said to be able to absorb such an infection and profit from it. Moreover, Nietzsche claims that the educator's task is to exploit such 532 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="10">wounds, even inflict new ones, as a form of inoculation against degeneration.64 Lou Salome describes Nietzsche's view as follows: The potential obstructions by the outer world pose simultaneously a stimulus and a chal- lenge, for nothing is more natural to him ["the active personal ity"] than a healthy com- bativeness directed outward, regardless of the scope of his intellect.65 Salome notes that ''Nietzsche's heaviest physical suffering had coincided with his inner and outer self-release from the influences of Wagner and the philosophy of Schopenhauer/' while his creative peaks were accompanied by his most severe ailments.66 Thus, one should expect the great Socrates to be capable of equally great errors: "a solitary man, arrogantly superior and herald of a radically dissimilar culture, art, and ethics, he stepped into a world whose least hem we should have counted it an honor to have touched." This condescending attitude on Socrates' part "disturbs us so profoundly" that it ranks him as "the most problematic character among the ancients."67 Socratic ethics and dialectics are characterized as "symptoms of de- cline, fatigue, distemper, of instincts caught in anarchic dissolution."68 In short, Soc- rates is "[t]ruly a monstrosity!"69 Yet Nietzsche's denunciations of Socrates in The Birth of Tragedy are quite mild when compared with the vituperation to be found in The Twilight of the Idols. Among the many idols targeted, the many philosophers maligned, Nietzsche reserves an entire section for "The Problem of Socrates," an honor not accorded to any other individual. Despite Nietzsche's disclaimer of using his hammer as a mere "tuning fork," the text seems to betray a much more violent application, particularly as it is wielded at the "eternal idol" Socrates. In Ecce Homo (1888) Nietzsche describes the text as "a demon that laughs," and admits that the reference to touch- ing (rather than smashing) the idols was "a cautious euphemism."70 For students conditioned by philosophical propaganda to revere Socrates as the veritable patron saint of Amero-Eurocentric philosophy, Nietzsche's characteriza- tion in "The Problem of Socrates" can only be described as shocking. The title itself, which asserts a problem with the Socratic tradition, is disconcerting enough. But further into the piece the reader is assailed by descriptions of Socrates as "sick," "pseudo-Greek, anti-Greek," a criminal exemplar possessed of plebian ugliness. He is "the buffoon who got himself taken seriously," "a misunderstanding," a perpetra- tor of "bizarre" doctrines motivated by revenge.71 Furthermore, Nietzsche claims that the Socratic monstrosity epitomizes the degeneration of the times. As the sun of Greek culture set, Nietzsche admits it was "necessary to turn reason into a tyrant," to be "absurdly rational," although the attempt to extricate oneself from decadence is merely another form of decadence.72 The vehemence of Nietzsche's attacks seems proportionate to his disappoint- ment that such a potential Obermensch as Socrates could collaborate with the forces of decay. He is both shocked and dismayed that Socrates would enslave his passions to reason, rather than draw upon their creative tensions. The conflicts Nietzsche experiences in his harsh judgments are reflected in his description of Socrates as Sandra A. Wawrytko 533</page><page sequence="11">the "most brilliant of all self-outwitters," trapped by his own dialectical web of words.73 Zarathustra is similarly depicted in Nietzsche's poem, "Between Birds of Prey" (Zwischen Raubvogeln): O Zarathustra! ... O Zarathustra! . . . Self-knower! Selbstkenner! Self-hangman! Selbsthenker . . ,74 As previously mentioned, Socrates is not the only target of the crusading Nietz- sche. Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (Jenseits von Cut und Bose: Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft) (1 886) opens with a section "On the Prejudices of Philosophers." Here the author attacks the shining lights of "West- ern" philosophy, denouncing "the hocus-pocus of mathematical form" donned by Spinoza and "the stiff and decorous Tartuffery of the old Kant," who leads us astray and seduces us.75 Elsewhere he dismisses Plato as "a first rate decadent in style" and quite simply "boring."76 Zhuang Zi Co-opts Kong Zi and Confounds Hui Zi Zhuang Zi's targets are selected not so much for their philosophical principles as for their limited and limiting points of view: the well frogs incapable of conceiv- ing of the expanse of the ocean, the summer insects oblivious to the existence of the other seasons. Their narrow perspectives make them appear profound one mo- ment and inane the next. Rather than being devoid of truth, their philosophies are simply partial truths - the Small Knowledge consistent with the meager experience of small birds in contrast to the Peng Bird's overarching vantage point of Great Knowledge. Zhuang Zi's methodology is inherently multi-perspectival, the antithesis of limi- tation. His depiction of the "enemy" is multi-dimensional. Zhuang Zi's Kong Zi is alternately hopeless and profound, possessed of both stupidity and transcendent wisdom - in short, a typical human being. His self-appointed nemesis Hui Zi is also a great friend, whose passing is much lamented. In delving deeper than a superficial Either/Or logic of sage/idiot or friend/enemy, Zhuang Zi also reflects the profundity of wei-wu-wei - acting (wei) without (wu) artificial action (wei) - that underlies the dualism of wei assertiveness and bu-wei passivity.77 Thus Kong Zi is revealed to be both an insufferable moralist and an incipient Daoist sage. In large part, the problem for Zhuang Zi's Kong Zi lies in his inability to resist the temptation to demonstrate his intellectual prowess in debate, since idle arguing is nothing more than "the Supreme Swindle."78 Nonetheless, many passages offer us a Kong Zi on the path to profundity who has been co-opted for the Daoist camp. An excellent example of Kong Zi as the antithesis of an accursed smug person appears in chapter 4. Here he offers very Daoistic advice to his disciple Yan Hui, who is enthusiastically setting forth to reform the ruler of Wei. Kong Zi warns him of the consequences of trying to force a situation (wei) by converting people to virtue (de, more aptly translated as virtuosity), 534 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="12">[which is] destroyed by fame, and wisdom comes out of wrangling. Fame is something to beat people down with and wisdom is a device for wrangling Though your virtue may be great and your good faith unassailable, if you do not understand men's spirits, though your fame may be wide and you do not strive with others, if you do not under- stand men's minds . . . this is simply using other men's bad points to parade your own excellence. Neither the camel-like attitude of the "outwardly compliant" (resembling bu-wei passivity) nor the lion-like proactive (wei) stance of "a companion of antiquity" is effective. Instead "fasting of the mind" is recommended (undoing the damage, wei- wu-wei).79 Similarly, in a conversation with Duke Ai, Kong Zi advocates protection of the "Spirit Storehouse" through wholeness of power and "the establishment of perfect harmony,"80 an interesting parallel to the balance of the Apollonian and the Dionysian that Nietzsche credits for the birth of tragedy. In chapter 6 the character of Kong Zi offers an insightful self-assessment. Speak- ing to Zi Gong, Kong Zi notes the differences between himself and the followers of Sang Hui: "Such men as they wander beyond the realm; men like me wander within it. Beyond and within can never meet [T]he petty man of Heaven is a gentleman among men; the gentleman among men is the petty man of Heaven."81 Earlier, in chapter 1, Zhuang Zi mentioned the progressively more encompassing types who transcend the limitations of the Confucian moral ideal, the scholar-official: the self- less perfect person, the meritless spiritual person, and the nameless sage. Lao Dan asks No-Toes (a convicted criminal) to free Kong Zi from his self-limiting "handcuffs and fetters," signs that he has been "punished by Heaven" (just as No Toes' human punishment was the loss of some appendages).82 Among these fetters is the search for understanding. Elsewhere, Kong Zi reveals that he has come to the truth of the "Great Change,"83 which mandates that one hold "fast to the source."84 Such is the message Lieh Zi learns from Hui Zi: "He got rid of the [Confucian] carving and polishing and returned to plainness.... In the midst of entanglement he remained sealed."85 Then there is Zhuang Zi's contemporary philosophical nemesis - and irreplace- able friend- the logician Hui Zi. Although not as high-value a target as Kong Zi, their interactions reflect Zhuang Zi's overall approach, and are especially revealing in terms of the deconstruction of language and opportunities to enjoy language games. In passages scattered throughout the text Zhuang Zi confronts and inevitably confounds his beloved enemy, Hui Zi. These debates not only reveal Zhuang Zi's Daoist agenda of no agenda, but further enlighten us as to the little-known school that Hui Zi represents. The short-lived School of Names (ming-jia), also known as Scholars of Names and Debaters (ming-bian), flourished briefly in the Warring States Period (481-221 b.c.e.). Its members advocated a purely intellectual approach to re- ality. In this they differed from, and were criticized by, Confucians and Daoists alike. The latter sought a more balanced approach, inclusive of such resources as emotion and transrational intuition. The encounters follow a consistent pattern, grounded in Hui Zi's penchant for competition. He is presented as an agon-addicted individual overly confident in his Sandra A. Wawrytko 535</page><page sequence="13">argumentative skills. Hui Zi inevitably initiates the conflict by challenging Zhuang Zi with conundrums from the standpoint of "common sense": an unusually large, hence seemingly useless, gourd (chapter 1), a person devoid of feelings (chapter 5), the inability to know what fish enjoy (chapter 17). However, Zhuang Zi skillfully turns common sense on its head, using Hui Zi's own words to ensnare him, just as a diminutive we/-obsessed weasel inevitably dies in a net (much like Socrates). In contrast, Zhuang Zi depicts himself as a seemingly useless ox. Luxuriating in wu- wei, the ox is "as large as an overarching cloud/' yet is incapable of catching even a mouse. However, that uselessness is the key to its survival.86 This certainly bears comparison with Socrates' self-professed usefulness as a gadfly to a flabby horse (Athens) that led to his execution. In contrast to Nietzsche's sharp denunciation of Socrates, Zhuang Zi displays great empathy for his contentious friend. In chapter 5 Zhuang Zi chides Hui Zi for treating his spirit "like an outsider. You wear out your energy, leaning on a tree and moaning, slumping at your desk and dozing - Heaven picked out a body for you and you use it to gibber about 'hard' and 'white'!"87 Their symbiotic relationship is most poignantly revealed when he happens to pass by Hui Zi's grave. Comparing Hui Zi to a plasterer and himself to Carpenter Shi, Zhuang Zi describes their unique synergy. The plasterer has an occupational hazard, flying mud. When he needs to have a speck of mud no thicker than a fly's wing removed from his nose, he asks his friend Carpenter Shi to slice it off for him. Shi would whirl his hatchet so deftly that it sounded like the wind. He removed every bit of mud without injury to the plasterer's nose, while his target remained completely at ease. How different from Nietzsche's intent to cause discomfort! Carpenter Shi and Zhuang Zi have much in common with Cook Ding (chapter 3). In their deconstructive tasks each elicits maximum effect from minimum effort (wei-wu-wei). Each knows exactly where to strike and make their cut, without wear- ing out their tools (whether hatchet, intellect, or knife). Yet there is no destruction in their deconstruction. Hearing of Ding's meticulous caution, Lord Wen-hui rightly exclaims that he has now "learned how to care for life!"88 Carpenter Shi also makes an appearance in chapter 4, where he has a disturbing dream about an oak tree after he had rejected it as unsuitable for his trade. The tree points out the usefulness of uselessness in terms of guaranteeing longevity, leading Shi to unthink his prejudices: "If you try to judge it by conventional standards, you'll be way off!"89 When Carpenter Shi is asked to repeat his incredible mud-slicing performance for the king he declines on the grounds that "the material I worked on has been dead these many years." For Zhuang Zi, Hui Zi was the material to be worked on, skillfully removing the blemish without injuring the person bearing the blemish. Zhuang Zi feels the loss of his friend deeply, lamenting "There's no one I can talk to any more."90 The Zhuang Zi closes with more regrets over his friend/foe's coun- terproductive behaviors that he shared with other rhetoricians: Dazzling men's minds, unsettling their views, they could outdo others in talking, but could not make them submit in their minds - such were the limitations of the rhetoricians of the world. . . . What a pity- that Hui Shi abused and dissipated his talents without ever 536 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="14">really achieving anything! Chasing after the ten thousand things, never turning back, he was like one who tries to shout an echo into silence or to prove that form can outrun shadow. How sad!91 Although they are exemplars of Lao Zi's deluded worldlings, Zhuang Zi expresses sincere empathy for their predicament. Skilled players of the game of logical dis- course, they mistook it for reality, failing to see it as mere play. Opponent/ Competitor, Wu-Wei/Wei [l]t's a very great thing to have an opponent Competition is the ugly sister of op- position. In true opposition, there's nothing to gain or lose. You can only benefit - Competition is self-centered, but opposition is ennobling.92 The subtle distinction between opposition and competition perhaps can explain the essential difference between our two philosophers. Zhuang Zi is ennobled by his interchanges with Kong Zi, Hui Zi, and others among his loyal opposition, because his deconstruction is a means of nurturing life (yang sheng zhu, the title of chapter 3). His strategy parallels the principle underlying isometric exercises, whereby a mobi- lization of creative tension benefits both parties. Zhuang Zi's philosophy exists, not because of the opposition, but in spite of it. As Kuang-ming Wu observes, his Daoist stance is one of "meta-opposition Zhuang Zi does not oppose Confucius. He does not need to." Competition hereby is transcended by "natural nonchalance/'93 By acting (wei) without (wu) artificial action (wei), spontaneity (zi-ran) bubbles up. As Zhuang Zi learned from Lao Zi, because the Daoist sage does not compete, there is nothing that is not accomplished. Nietzsche, on the other hand, seems to have been seduced into the counterpro- ductive wei mode of competition, making the other not merely an opponent but an actual enemy. Kuang-ming Wu's discussion of the contrast between Zhuang Zi and Soren Kierkegaard is relevant here. Among the three significant elements Wu sees as unique to Kierkegaard is a stylistic approach "pervaded with caustic despair and barbed satire." This seems equally applicable to Nietzsche, for the two thinkers do indeed display an "aggressive melancholia" in their writings. Wu also portrays Kier- kegaard's method as that "of a Socratic gadfly," the same metaphor applied here to Nietzsche. Furthermore, both philosophers find themselves confronting a common enemy, Christianity. Zarathustra is an excellent example of Nietzsche's attempt at the wei-wu-wei "nonchalant joy" of butterfly Zhuang Zi. However the gadfly was ultimately unable to sustain that state.94 Nietzsche mistakes entanglements for mutual support. His enemy is beloved for playing that very role, indicating that emotional attachment has yet to be tran- scended. Socrates, the man and the demon, is a figure Nietzsche loves to hate and must hate in order to love. Is he perhaps guilty of "using other men's bad points to parade your own excellence," as Zhuang Zi's Kong Zi warns Yan Hui? In fairness to Nietzsche we must recall that he is being judged on the basis of an entire opus of work, spanning some twenty years. During this time an inevitable evo- lution in his own thought processes, in his attitudes, is apparent. He did make an Sandra A. Wawrytko 537</page><page sequence="15">attempt to transcend the reactive, warring lion who roars "no/' A more sanguine Nietzsche appears in The Cay Science (Die Frohliche Wissenschaft) (1982): "I do not want to make war against the ugly. I do not want to accuse, I don't even want to accuse the accusers. May looking away be my sole denial! And, all in all: I want to be some day nothing else but a yea-sayer!"95 Three periods of Nietzsche's philosophical evolution have been identified, par- alleling Zarathustra's three metamorphoses.96 The path of self-transcendence moves from camel resentment to lion aggression - both indicative of a competitive spirit, respectively covert and overt - and thence into the childlike state of "innocent" op- position. How far was Nietzsche able to follow this path? It has been argued that his madness resulted from an ongoing battle between the child and the father.9 Perhaps this is what Lou Salome had in mind when she described Nietzsche's thought pro- cess as "a never-ceasing motion of returning into himself."98 This analysis seems to concur with Nietzsche's apparently autobiographical observations in Mixed Opinions and Maxims (Vermischte Meinungen und Spruche) (1979): Every philosophy is the philosophy of some stage of life. The stage of life at which a philosopher found his doctrine reverberates through it; he cannot prevent this, however far above time and hour he may feel. Thus, Schopenhauer's philosophy remains the re- flection of ardent and melancholy youth - it is no way of thinking for older people. And Plato's philosophy recalls the middle thirties, when a cold and a hot torrent often roar toward each other, so that a mist and tender little clouds form - and under favorable cir- cumstances and the rays of the sun, an enchanting rainbow." This collection came out in 1879, when Nietzsche, not coincidentally, was in his mid-thirties, the very same period when Dannhauser finds him to be "most favorably disposed to Socrates."100 Reflecting the clash of hot and cold torrents, in the same work (maxim 357) Nietzsche comments on unfaithfulness as "a condition of master- ship," for the disciple, too, "is destined for mastership."101 Based on the evidence available in Nietzsche's works, a strict parallel to Zhuang Zi's Daoist overcoming seems difficult to discern; the evolutionary line wavers. In the earliest period, Nietzsche approaches Socrates somewhat warily, as "both a great temptation and something to be rejected."102 Torn by his own conflicting cur- rents of Dionysian and Apollonian urges, he is both attracted to and repelled by this "despotic logician"; "to argue with Socrates, the logical man of reason, about logic and reason is to meet Socrates on his home ground. Because he consents to argue, Nietzsche must, at least temporarily, subscribe to the very reason and logic he seeks to attack."103 More importantly, Nietzsche's reaction points beyond the historical Socrates to the "symbolic event" embedded in Socratism,104 namely the rise of "the theoretical man" and with him the tyranny of reason/science. This rise heralds the decline of art/creativity. As "the great opponent of Dionysus," Socrates is "more than a mere man."105 Early on Nietzsche cherished the hope of a mutually beneficial synthesis, wondering "whether there is really anything inherently impossible in the idea of a Socratic artist." Such a synthesis is prefigured in the imprisoned Socrates, who 538 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="16">composed music and verse, motivated by an "uneasiness about the limits of his logical universe/'106 Has Nietzsche identified himself in his enemy here? Was Nietzsche another case of an individual whose artistic vocation was subordinated to the demands of philosophy, only to suffer the revenge of illness? This possibil- ity was glimpsed by at least some of Nietzsche's friends, including Malwida von Meysenbug. She was very impressed by Nietzsche's pianistic abilities, but also apprehensive - "She had sensed that an artist was lost in the scholar and agreed with [Richard] Wagner that a man endowed with so much musical inspiration had no business being a professor."107 The seeming conflict between art and science is explained by Nietzsche in terms of levels of perception. Science "approaches those outer limits where the optimism implicit in logic must collapse [L]ogic in that place curls about itself and bites its own tail." As a result the one seeking scientific knowledge "is struck with a new kind of perception: a tragic perception," which only art can cure. Socrates' "insatiable zest for knowledge" thereby becomes "tragic resignation, and the need for art." Al- though this "zest" appears to reject all art, including Dionysiac art, Nietzsche sees it rather as "the subversion of Aeschylean art by Socratism."108 Nietzsche temporarily succumbs to the Siren song of Socrates, as is evident in the second period of his works, where a camel-like adulation of reason and its potentials emerges. In The Wanderer and His Shadow (Der Wanderer und sein Schatten) (1880), Socrates is celebrated as "the simplest and most imperishable mediator-sage. The roads of the most divergent philosophic ways of life lead back to him" (aphorism 86). 109 Nietzsche has suspended hostilities to forge an alliance with Socrates against what he assumes to be their common foe - Christianity. Fur- thermore, he identifies with the Socratic character and method: If all goes well, the time will come when, to develop oneself morally-rationally, one will take up the memorabilia of Socrates rather than the Bible Above the founder of Chris- tianity, Socrates is distinguished by the gay kind of seriousness and that wisdom full of pranks which constitute the best state of the soul of man. Moreover, he had the greater intelligence.110 In Zarathustra the reversal inherent in the lion's roar bellows forth. The meta- morphosis is signaled most clearly by the radical change in Nietzsche's style of presentation- the methodology of reasoned discourse is usurped by semi-chaotic poetic flights, the very voice of Dionysian delight: "I have consecrated laughter. But not a single soul have I found strong enough to join me."111 This statement harks back to the self-centeredness of competition. More leonine rumblings follow in Be- yond Good and Evil, as Nietzsche intones "the philosopher, as a necessary man of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, has always found himself, and always had to find himself, in opposition to his today: the ideal of the day was always his en- emy."112 In the conclusion of Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche identified the ideal of his day as science, "whose archetype and progenitor is Socrates."113 In Toward a Genealogy of Morals (Zur Genealogie der Moral) (1 887) Nietzsche gives precise form to the camel's flaw of ressentiment, denouncing the enemy as "evil," in contrast to the "noble" stance of the beast of prey: Sandra A. Wawrytko 539</page><page sequence="17">Slave ethics . . . begins by saying no to an "outside/' an "other/' a non-self, and that no is its creative act. When a noble man feels resentment, it is absorbed in his instantaneous reaction and therefore does not poison him It is a sign of strong, rich temperaments that they can- not for long take seriously their enemies, their misfortunes, their misdeeds; . . . Such a man simply shakes off vermin which would get beneath another's skin - and only here, if any- where on earth, is it possible to speak of "loving one's enemy." The noble person will respect his enemy, and respect is already a bridge to love Indeed he requires his en- emy for himself, as his mark of distinction nor could he tolerate any other enemy than one in whom he finds nothing to despise and much to esteem.114 The enemy is thus the sine qua non for Nietzsche. Speaking of Genealogy, Nietzsche attributes the prevalence of the ascetic, priestly ideal, the ideal of decadence, to the lack of a competing alternative: "Above all the counter-ideal was lacking - until Zarathustra."115 The extent to which Nietzsche was capable of assuming the noble stance toward his enemy, Socrates, remains open to question. Certainly in Twilight of the Idols he does take Socrates quite seriously, is unable to "shake him off" along with the other vermin.116 Does this indicate a respect for Socrates, which would implicate him in a "love" relationship? Can it be said that he finds in Socrates "nothing to despise and much to esteem"? All of these points remain unclear. True to his philosophy, Nietz- sche is dedicated to insuring our discomfort. Indeed, "The Problem of Socrates" reveals a Socrates who is sick, resentful, revengeful, a nay-sayer to life, steeped in the disreputable "improvement-morality" - in short a Socrates identified with the very same slave ethics that Nietzsche condemns in Christianity. Apparently any hopes Nietzsche may have cherished of an alliance with Socrates to defeat Chris- tianity had by this time been abandoned. Daoist Deconstruction as Philosophical Play Although Nietzsche avowed that "every great philosophy so far has been . . . the per- sonal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious mem- oir,"117 that memoir certainly bears the traces of cultural influences. Nietzsche's defective wei strategy is the dysfunctional methodology he inherited from the Hel- lenic roots of European civilization. This collective dysfunction derailed his greatest personal triumph - an intuitive grasp of the child's "yes" to life, wu-wei. Despite Nietzsche's greatest efforts, he reached an impasse; he was able to glimpse the dis- solution of the problem without being able actually to reach it. Desirous of health, Nietzsche remained mired in dis-ease. His diagnosis was correct, yet he was unable to effect a cure. In a letter to Lou Salome he refers to the "chain fever" that seems to have plagued him to the very end - "the old deep heart- felt request: become yourself! One must break free of one's chains to begin with, but of this breaking free itself in the end!"118 Breaking the chains of camel servitude the lion bursts on the scene. But the lion remains obsessed with the chains, defining it- self by its rejection of camelness. Only when the dualism of both camel and lion has 540 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="18">been left behind does chain fever dis-solve, allowing the emergence of the playful child: "innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred 'Yes' [H]e who had been lost to the world now con- quers his own world/'119 Methodological differences aside, both Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche did recognize the dangerous deficiencies of their fellow humans, and accordingly attempted to awaken them from their stupefying slumbers. This required engaging and even embracing the beloved enemy to share in deconstructing our commonly held delu- sions. However, legions of lions who believe themselves to be deconstructing are in fact on a destructive rampage. Recall Derrida's warning about alleged outsiders in relation to the institution of philosophy being critiqued or deconstructed - did Nietz- sche "interiorize its norms and programs''? A more viable model of deconstruction appears in the fully nonfixated philoso- phy of Zhuang Zi, where even the opposition is invited to join the free-wheeling play of spontaneous (zi-ran) creativity. Philosophy is not destroyed by deconstructing it, but merely demystified. Would this not constitute what Derrida suggests in his cryp- tic definition: "deconstruction, if there is such a thing, takes place as the experience of the impossible."120 Perhaps we are sufficiently removed from the heyday of de- construction to reconsider its potential contributions to philosophy in a Daoist form. What would such a deconstructed philosophy be like? To begin with, it would adhere to Both/And rather than Either/Or logic. To elucidate such philosophical play, Thome H. Fang (1899-1977) invokes a lively metaphor about a child flying a kite. Inspired by Zhuang Zi, Fang casts the kite in the form of a butterfly that invites the playful child "into infinitude." The kite itself is compared to the philosopher's soul "now mounting higher in realms of the unafraid speculation ... now darting down into lower spaces ... but most of the time hovering in the open, lofty empy- rean with levity and freedom and strength as if to marshal all features of Nature into a gladdened order of comprehensive harmony."121 Once the magic trick of the construct-prone mind, cunning intellect, has been exposed, the trick remains while the magic dissipates. Then one may appreciate one's philosophical flights without mistaking them for reality. These "things of rea- son," as Spinoza refers to them, are actively constructed by the mind as rational models of reality.122 However they must be transcended by intuition, Spinoza's third and highest kind of knowledge, to experience blessedness and ultimate freedom. Interestingly, Spinoza defines freedom as acting by necessity, or in accordance with one's nature, which a Daoist would recognize as zi-ran.U3 What could be more free and blessed/blissful than a child flying a butterfly kite, interacting with Dao wei-wu- weR Notes I would like to thank the reviewers of this journal for their meticulous reading of several drafts of this essay, engendering invaluable suggestions for clarifying a Sandra A.

Like many Daoist terms, the negative phrasing disguises the affirmative intent of a return to nat- ural (zi-ran) behavior. Hence, we can undo the damage caused by the proac- tive stance of what Watson refers to as "the mind which makes artificial dis- tinctions" (The Complete Works ofChuang Tzu, p. 57 n. 4). In acting without artificial action (wei-wu-wei) one is not passive but rather interactive, resonat- ing with Dao.

Sandra A. Wawrytko 545</page><page sequence="23">51 - Ernst Behler argues for the "centrality of the play concept for Nietzsche's philosophy," based on Nietzsche's appreciative discussion of Heraclitus in "Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks," in Confrontations: Derridaj Heidegger/ Nietzsche, trans. Steven Taubeneck (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), p. 94. Cf. Kuang-ming Wu, Chuang Tzu: World Philosopher at Play (New York: Crossroad Publishing, 1982). Play is indeed highlighted in Nietzsche's characterization of his favorite Greek thinker: "In this world only play, play as artists and children engage in it, exhibits coming-to-be and pass- ing away, structuring and destroying, without any moral additive, in forever innocence. And as children and artists play, so plays the ever-living fire" ("Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks" [section 7], p. 62). This point does not undermine the distinction drawn here between Zhuang Zi and Nietz- sche, but rather enriches it. Studies of play have recognized that it takes differ- ent forms. One form provides young animals a safe environment in which to hone survival skills (i.e., cats practicing mock attacks). Such productive play seems to be what Nietzsche, and perhaps Heraclitus, have in mind: "Not hu- bris but the ever self-renewing impulse to play calls new worlds into being [The child,] when it does build, combines and joins and forms its structures regularly, conforming to inner laws." Nietzsche contrasts this with "innocent caprice," in which the "child throws its toys away from time to time" ("Phi- losophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks" [section 7], p. 62). Capricious or pure play reflects the leisurely strolling of Zhuang Zi as spontaneous (zi-ran) creativity, which is devoid of purpose and hence "unproductive" from the standpoint of cunning intellect.

"Nietzsche's admiration for Socrates is a focal point of his thought and reflects his views of reason and morality as well as the picture of man he envisaged" (Kaufmann, Nietzsche, p. 391; Dannhauser, Nietzsche's View of Socrates, pp. 35-36). Significantly, Kauf- mann devotes mere paragraphs to a discussion of Twilight of the Idols, with its harsh critique of Socrates. Ecce Homo is treated as a reflection of Nietz- sche's Socratic tendencies, paralleling the Apology (Dannhauser, Nietzsche's View of Socrates, p. 37). 61 - Birth of Tragedy, in Golffing, The Birth of Tragedy and the Genealogy of Morals, pp. 94, 84, 82. 62 - "Fragment of a Critique of Schopenhauer" (dated 1867), in Werke, 1 :393 (Musarion edition), quoted by Dannhauser, Nietzsche's View of Socrates, p. 30. 63 - Human, All-Too-Human, (section 224) in Kaufmann, The Portable Nietzsche, p. 55. 64 - Ibid., pp. 55-56.

A notable exception to Nietzsche's sweeping condemnation of his philosophical prede- cessors is Heraclitus, the Riddler, who alone was not seduced by the lure of permanence (ibid., p. 480). Interestingly, Graham Parkes hails Zhuang Zi as "the Chinese Heraclitus: though perhaps not quite as obscure as his Ephesian counterpart, and a whole lot more cheerful" (Parkes, "Nietzsche and East Asian Thought," p. 376). 77 - Wu defends Zhuang Zi against the bu-wei label, which he describes as the "Do-nothing-ism . . . complete uselessness" espoused by egoist Yang Zhu (Chuang Tzu: World Philosopher at Play, p. 6). 78 - Watson, The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu, chapter 2, p. 48. 79 - Ibid., pp. 55-57. 80 - Ibid., chapter 5, p. 74. 81 - Ibid., pp. 86-87.

As Dannhauser states: "Nietzsche implicitly admits that Socrates himself points beyond Socratism Socrates is the great partisan of science, but the figure of Socrates, especially the Platonic Socrates, suggests that the conflict can be transcended." "The world did not, to be sure, simply take a turn for the worse because of Socrates. . . . Socrates and Socratism are . . . revealed as preservers of life. Moreover, if science is a form of art, the 'inartistic' Socrates is nevertheless an artist" (Dannhauser, Nietzsche's View of Socrates, pp. 65-66). 1 07 - H. F.
