<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD LIND A Microphenomenology of Aesthetic Qualities NEARLY ANYONE can tell aesthetic qualities from other kinds. The difficulty lies in specifying exactly in what that distinction consists. Though the psychology of perception would seem a promising approach, some writers contend that any attempt at perceptual ex- planation is doomed to failure.' I hold that their arguments only tell us what to avoid in a psychological formulation. This essay will explore the possibility that the variety of qualities normally called "aesthetic" can, in fact, be explained as various aspects of a single, complex perceptual event. I. What can we learn from the objections to the perceptual approach? Most of them have cropped up in reaction to Frank Sibley's suggestion that there are two different kinds of perceptual abilities-the ordinary kind, by which we can perceive the color of a painting, the pattern of a fugue, or the posture of a figure, and "taste," alternately described as "a special perceptiveness," "sensitivity," and "aesthetic discrimination" or "appreciation," by which some, though not all, individuals are able to detect qualities like "tightly knit," "deeply moving," "graceful," or "lacking balance."2 Taste is simply said to be a certain ability to discriminate special properties in the perceived object.3 Sibley defines aesthetic qualities in terms of taste: When a word or expression is such that taste or perceptiveness is required in order to apply it, I shall call it an aesthetic term or expression, and I shall, correspondingly, speak of aesthetic concepts or taste concepts.4 RICHARD LIND is associate professor of philosophy at the University of Tulsa. It is this conditioning of aesthetic "concepts" (the words that refer to aesthetic qualities) on taste that has come into question. Ted Cohen attacks this and any similar thesis with several arguments. In one, he offers three illustrations-a straight line, a jagged one, and a slightly curved arc segment.5 We are asked which of them is the graceful one. Since we have no trouble picking the curved line with "virtual insensitivity," Cohen concludes there must be no such thing as "taste" necessary to perceive gracefulness. Cohen's little "test" is inconclusive, however. If one shows subjects an arc segment by itself, no one will agree that it is "graceful." Since Sibley can concede that curvature is a necessary physical condition for a line's gracefulness6, he could attribute any tendency to identify the arc as the "most graceful" of the three to the fact that it is the only figure to satisfy this condition. In a related argument, Cohen cites com- monplace instances of uncomplicated judgment: Can't you imagine situations in which it would be natural, easy and obvious to say-"It's a rather lovely day today"; "This glove is too big; you have a rather dainty hand"; "He's an elegant old gentleman"; "The sun has broken through and now the sky is pretty"; "I couldn't see the vessels on the last one, but this earthworm is a beautiful specimen."7 Finding it "natural, easy, and obvious" to make these judgments supposedly shows that no special sensitivity is required. But is this not analogous to saying that because a skilled mathematician regards algebra as natural, easy and obvious he need not possess any special facility? Even if taste perception is somewhat more difficult than the normal kind, there could be commonplace applications of it for which most of us possess more than adequate skill.</page><page sequence="2">394 LIND But another of Cohen's points is devastating to Sibley's crude psychology. Special sensitiv- ity, Cohen notes, is hardly limited to A qualities. There is, for instance, the ability to recognize a person's place of origin by his behavior. Some observers "can tell on sight, by attending to a person's size, shape, posture, gesture, gait, etc. Jews, Northern Europeans, homosexuals, New Yorkers, etc."8 The example shows that if aesthetic discrimination is a defining characteristic of A qualities it must involve discrimination of a specific kind, not spelled out by Sibley. Cohen's greatest challenge to the psy- chological approach is directed at Sibley's suggestion that any person possessed of a reasonable degree of taste could easily sort A from Non-A terms. He introduces his own long list of terms frequently used in reference to artworks.9 A sampling: Baroque by Beethoven classical climactic daring didactic geometric introspective Kafkaesque lyrical mechanical metaphysical moralistic obscene painterly poetic pompous religious restful rhythmic sentimental serious sincere suggestive Cohen invites us to decide in which category, A or non-A, each falls. He asks, for instance, how we decide when it is appropriate to assign the predicate "by Beethoven." Do we employ taste or normal faculties?'Â° Our total bewil- derment at such questions is evidence enough to convince Cohen that the taste/normal distinction is bogus. And since the possibility of there being distinct aesthetic qualities seems to hinge on this distinction, Cohen concludes there is no such conceptual distinction as A/non-A. " Of course, a difficulty for one theory is not necessarily a problem for all others. Cohen's list challenges us to sort out a tremendous variety of candidates for A qualities. By Beethoven, lyrical, pompous, painterly, and geometric, for example, are such very different sorts of properties. Our consternation seems to result mostly from the suggestion that all these terms could be neatly stacked in one or the other of two all purpose cubby holes. An adequate theory must provide a complete taxonomy for all these terms. While Monroe Beardsley does not share Cohen's skepticism about the existence of A qualities, he offers additional doubts about the feasibility of a perceptual explanation.12 He attacks the idea that A qualities correspond to taste while ordinary ones answer to normal perception, pointing out that the very same psychological process that brings out A qualities can also reveal non-A qualities.13 We can, for instance, see both the gracefulness and the curvature of a line at the same time. Instances like this do seem to show that there are not two mutually exclusive modes of perception. Beardsley goes on to offer his own phenomenological description of what aesthetic perception actually is: To perceive such A qualities, you have to apply a more diffuse attention, to let yourself go to a certain extent, to surrender yourself to what is given rather than trying to force the visual field to disgorge the desired or predicted datum. In this way of seeing there is a relaxation, an absence of strain, but also a kind of visual fulfillment, an escape from impoverishment, as one takes in a variety of qualities, instead of concentrating on certain "relevant" ones and trying to exclude others. There is an enjoyment, almost an exhilaration, in the exercise of pure unfettered power of seeing as seeing is freed from subservience to a practical end.'4 To Beardsley, then, aesthetic perception is a kind of openness to what is "there" in the phenomenal field. The implication is that the quality is prior to and therefore independent of aesthetic perception, which merely serves to discover it. Beardsley's description seems quite accurate as far as it goes, but it would preclude a perceptual explanation of A qual- ities only if we could be sure it was adequate. We must keep open the possibility that there are additional perceptual processes not detected by Beardsley. Harold Osborne agrees with Beardsley that "aesthetic activities" have always made manifest both A and non-A qualities.'5 But he adds that nonaesthetic interests can also take cognizance of both A and non-A qualities: There is no quality among those usually classed as aesthetic which may not be the object of a practical, scientific or other nonaesthetic interest. You may be interested in a woman's gracefulness as a means of recognition or for the mild stimulation it occasions to the erotic emotions. You may have a psychological interest in the pompous demeanor of a, shy man subject to nervousness. ... If you are a Frenchman, you may be interested in "La Marseillaise" because of its patriotic associations.'6 Admittedly, this argument falsifies any psychological theory which regards aesthetic</page><page sequence="3">Aesthetic Qualities perception as incompatible with nonaesthetic interest. But if a theory is able to show how it is possible for aesthetic and nonaesthetic interests to be compatible, it will remain untouched by this objection. It is evident, then, that the standard objections to the psychological explanation of A qualities do not justify a priori dismissal. But they show that a successful hypothesis must (1) explain exactly how aesthetic qualities could be generated in perception; (2) demon- strate how both A and non-A properties can appear at the same time; (3) provide a theoretically-based taxonomy for sorting out the many different candidates for A qualities. II. To succeed, our psychology must discover more than is directly observable through the sort of descriptive introspection in which Beardsley is engaged. For this deeper search I shall use microphenomenology, by which I mean the hypothetical reconstruction of the swift and subtle dynamics of the phenomenal field. What we are able to detect through direct reflection sometimes suggests hypotheses about phenomenological principles. Direct reflection, in turn, can test these conjectures against what we clearly do experience.'7 The thesis to be described and defended is this: certain spontaneous attentive events are opera- tive in all perception. Effects appear as qualities of the object perceived. Aesthetic perception differs from normal perception only by its special interest in the experience of the object, which makes us sensitive to everything occurring in that experience. That interest is stimulated by perceptual attraction, heightened discrimination elicited by the peculiar ar- rangement of the phenomenal field. Those apparent qualities of the object experienced as participating in this attraction are regarded as positive A qualities. But if our aesthetic interest is frustrated, those apparent qualities participating in our repulsion are treated as negative A qualities. Experience becomes intelligible, I believe, by constant and continuous focal comparisons among the available data so quick as to be usually manifest to introspection only by their resultant pathways. That is, compared items are "sized up" by these focal shifts while the wholistic connection between them is consti- tuted by the latter's subliminally swift move- ment.'8 That would explain how it is possible for the Gestalt of a complex painting or musical piece, for example, to become elaborated in ever greater detail the more we discriminate its elements. It shows why the proper analysis of a work of art does not leave so many pieces lying on the floor but instead enriches the interweaving of its fabric. Consider the visual appearance of two side-by-side straight vertical lines of equal length. Barely attended to, they remain unrelated elements in the background flux. But when focused upon fully, their equality becomes apparent even as the individual elements fuse into a pair of lines, a single structure composed of parallel lines. Close analysis reveals that the reason these lines appear as a unit is that the intervening space is as apparent as the lines; the two lines and the intervening space stand out against the background material as a single phenomenal prominence. Our hypothesis about how this synthesis- by-analysis occurs is based on the observation that material in the phenomenal field becomes figurally prominent through "attentive focus- ing." Sometimes intentionally, usually auto- matically, we "select out" elements or areas in the sensory matrix, excluding others. Selective focusing enables us, for instance, to see two concentric circles as either a doughnut or a sombrero, depending on whether we "highlight" the center circle. It is because of this ability to bring out definite figural shapes that attentive focus can also serve as an instrument of comparison. By shifting between two lines to compare them, our focus would create the figural unity of two parallel lines even as the transferred focus serves as the standard for measuring their relative lengths. Analyses conducted in a previous article have led me to postulate a variant of the Gestalt psychologists' principle of similarity to describe this automatic process: once sensitized to a particular quality, property, or relation, atten- tive focus will oscillate among all proximate similar elements.'9 This process (1) brings out their similarity or differences and (2) weaves the compared elements figurally together. One of the best ways to test a perceptual hypothesis is to put it to the test of perceptual illusion. Can it explain seeming aberrations in the way we see or hear things? The famous Miiller-Lyer illusion (hereafter referred to as M-L), in which an externally finned line 395</page><page sequence="4">LIND falsely appears longer than an internally finned one, is both the favorite example and the downfall of most illusion theorists.20 While some theories have accounted for a small part of the magnitude of the M-L's effect, not one of them has fully succeeded in accounting for it.21 Consideration of several of the more prominent theories will give an idea of the difficulties encountered. (1) The "blur" theory of illusion, as I shall call it, holds that spherical aberration, chromatic aberration, and diffraction all conspire to leave parts of the visual field ocularly indistinct.22 Deliberately blurring the image of the M-L does increase the illusion. However, exper- iments have shown that increased clarification does not reduce the illusion at anywhere near the rate one would expect if ocular factors were the only or even a significant cause.23 (2) Another hypothesis puts the problem further along the perceptual channel, in the retina. Two factors here are thought to affect illusions: summation, the tendency of stimu- lated retinal cells under certain circumstances to excite neighboring neurons not directly stimulated, and inhibition, in which highly stimulated cells prevent their neighbors from being directly stimulated.24 The resultant blurring effect broadens some images, reduces others. While this factor may play a role in the M-L, its contribution must be quite small since it is well known that the illusion can be virtually eliminated when subjects are advised to ignore the fins,25 a fact which indicates that the main source of the illusion occurs in the "higher" processes. (3) Gregory's popular thesis explains the M-L illusion as resulting from improperly reading the fins as depth clues.26 Gregory holds that even when the M-L appears perfectly flat, we still unconsciously judge it according to the depth cues presented by the fins.27 In fact, however, it can be a minor factor at best since the illusion persists with many variations of the M-L in which depth cues are not present. (4) Averaging theories are the most recent form of explanation.28 They all share the view that the illusion results from our difficulty in adjusting the field of attention to the parallel lines to be compared; our attentive field tends to expand to include the fins as well. This conflict induces us to average the difference between the length of the total configuration and that of the line by a mechanism that varies according to the theorist. The general theory is supported by the experimental fact that the magnitude of the illusion is usually an average of the difference between the length of the shaft and the length of the fins.29 But one finds the following difficulties: (a) All such theories are extremely vague. The most egregious omission is to fail to spell out exactly how the attentive field is supposed to contribute to the illusion. In particular, there is no attempt to specify how the comparison between elements is accomplished. As Plato once observed, to compare one thing with another you need a third factor, a yardstick as it were. What is the yardstick and how is it applied in averaging? (b) "Averaging" is apparently supposed to be a process that goes on behind the scenes, a neurological event without any correlative phenomenal manifestation. But, phenomen- ologically, one finds that our apprehension of the relative sizes of the figures is not a matter of judgment in the sense that we suddenly simply know or believe that they are equal or that one is larger than the other. They actually appear equal or unequal; their size relation is phenomenally manifest. Our microphenomenological hypothesis, in contrast, will offer both a yardstick (the focus of attention) and an analysis of the actual experience of the equality or inequality of compared items. This explanation requires that we distinguish three factors: (a) the phenom- enal field, (b) the attentional field, and (c) attentive focus. Visually, the phenomenal field encompasses all that is present at any given time, although much of it is undifferentiated. The attentional field, to which the averaging theorists seem to allude, is that portion of the phenomenal field in which features are distinguished. This aspect of attention is subject to voluntary control in two ways: (1) We can determine the scope and location of the area of the phenomenal field to be articulated. Among a cluster of dots, for instance, we can include some to be distinguished and exclude others at will. (2) We can establish the mind set which specifies which features in the attentive field emerge. Given a complex painting, one can cause all red things, for example, to pop out from the other features. Now my hypothesis is that the automatic functioning of the third factor, the focus of attention, is indirectly controlled by these voluntary adjustments in the attentive field. 396</page><page sequence="5">Aesthetic Qualities The oscillating focal shifts of comparison are restricted to the scope of the attentive field, and the elements they compare can be restricted by the set. Unlike the attentive field, which includes both figures and ground, the focus brings out figural prominence wherever it goes. Its scannings, I hold, can result in illusions like the M-L whenever one's set is not sufficiently precise, for specificity of set is difficult to achieve. Thus, when one first tries to compare the two M-L shafts independently of the fins, the scanning focus will be distracted, by similarity, beyond the shaft to include the central fins. The falsely expanded focal process is then carried across as the measure of the alternative shaft. The internally finned figure does not measure up to that standard, indicating a shorter line. When the focus returns to the first figure, it again expands by distraction, thereby signaling a longer line Researchers have developed data which seem to support this reconstruction. For one thing, they have noted that the degree to which the fins are similar to the shaft is directly related to the strength of the illusion. Girgus, Coren, and Horowitz, for example, have shown that fins which are straight like the shafts induce greater magnitude than bowed or rounded accessory lines.30 Coren and Girgus have also shown that color and brightness differentiations of these elements also reduce the illusion.3' Secondly, our hypothesis is consistent with the previously noted exper- imental observation that when subjects are advised to "ignore the fins" the illusion is reduced or eliminated. One can ignore the fins only by reducing the scope of the attentive field or by refining one's set. Thirdly, it has been determined that the M-L is the type of illusion to which we become less susceptible with age or practice.32 Control over the scope and set of the attentional field would seem to be a skill that only improves with age. Why then, does the magnitude of the M-L tend to be half the length of the fins? According to our theory, when we try to focus on the shaft of the longer of the figures our focus would tend to flicker between the shaft and the total figure in virtue of a distracting similarity. But when this transferable process leaves the sensuous elements which induced this focal schizophrenia, the flickering could very well begin to diminish. It could plausibly achieve a sort of stability midway between the two competing lengths by the time it arrives at the other shaft. We would end up comparing the alternative figure with this averaged length. This conjectured tendency toward focal stabil- ity is at least consistent with the well known principle of "good figure," whereby irregular shapes become quickly regularized in short term memory.33 Our perceptions are known to tend to stabilize in memory. At any rate, our hypothesis about the way visual comparisons are made is more specific and more plausible than any of its competitors as the explanation of the M-L illusion. These considerations, in turn, support the claim that focal discrimina- tion of similarities and differences is the way we make the objects of perception intelligible. III. In order to appreciate what focal activity has to do with aesthetic qualities, we must first address the question as to what aesthetic sensitivity truly is. It consists, I believe, in the ability to apprehend more than the purely physical features of things. When aesthetic sensitivity is engaged, we become aware of, among other things, the operation of our own attentive focusings, if only in an oblique, impressionistic way. Physical perception, according to this position, involves a process of focal comparisons according to both the principle of similarity and the principle of familiarity.34 The latter consists of reading and anticipating events according to, among other things, purely physical perception, not unlike overlooking the cracks in an old painting. However, when one is sensitized to the movements of attentive focus itself, a whole new set of events becomes obliquely evident.35 When we speak of a line "extend- ing," for instance, the datum itself is not moving. The moving focus of attention, in revealing the line according to its internal similarity, gives the impression that the line itself is extending. In this and similar ways, the dynamics of our attentive focus appear inherent in the object as its own qualityto higher discriminating activities which are not normally in operation. These phenomenal dynamics do not, how- ever, automatically qualify as aesthetic qua- lities. The extending of a single straight line, the thrusting of a wedge or the tension between two color masses can be aesthetically indif- ferent to us. A special aesthetic interest seems 397</page><page sequence="6">LIND to be the missing ingredient, a practical interest in experiencing an attraction to the discriminated object.36 What is it to be attracted? It is, I say, to have one's focus of attention engaged in a heightened, sustained discrimination of something. Aesthetic attrac- tion seems to come about only when the similarities within the object are so subtly or intricately arranged that they require prolonged discrimination to make them intelligible. Though a simple arc has no appeal, the subtly altering curves of many designs can elicit rhythms of focal analysis that give rise to aesthetic interest. It is generally acknowledged that to be "aesthetic" (in the positive sense) something must be interesting to perception in this way. Before we can completely understand what A qualities are, we must also analyze the role of feeling, which is clearly a significant aspect of many aesthetic qualities. I have observed that while there may be other causes of feeling as well, there appears to be a direct correlation between the degree of focal activity required to make anything intelligible and the intensity of corresponding muscular and visceral sensations. The more one strives to solve a puzzle or to see a thing whole the more one feels a certain "tension" or "pressure". Paradoxically, these sensations are not necessarily felt in the body. They are more likely to be felt "about" or "toward" the eliciting object. Sensations of different orders (sight, hearing, touch, feeling, smell, taste) appear to be phenomenally organized in relation to one another according to their mutual significance. In the drive-in movie, for instance, the sound which first annoyingly emanates from the speaker in the car window soon appears to be coming out of the mouths of the actors on the screen. By the same token, the feelings in our bodies come to appear as "tied" to their stimulus, experienced as a quality of the object, just as Santayana long ago insisted.37 But what Santayana did not note is that because of their close association with the object, these feelings become as attractive to attention as the object itself during the aesthetic experience. Conversely, they become repellent in relation to any repellent stimulus. The feelings of pleasure and displea- sure we feel in relation to aesthetic objects are therefore totally explicable in terms of the control which these objects exert on our efforts to make them intelligible.38 IV. The foregoing theoretical sketch is suffi- cient to guide us in the attempt to define specific terms generally acknowledged as designating uniquely aesthetic qualities. Let us consider everybody's favorite example, "grace- ful." While gracefulness may be said to vary considerably from one instance to the next, it may still be possible to find the common phenomenal features among graceful lines, shapes, musical passages, movements, writing, and the like. When we call something "graceful," part of what we are saying about it seems clearly to be that it is aesthetically attractive. Indeed the term is derived from the Latin gratis, meaning pleasing or agreeable. Could one honestly call the movements of a dancer "graceful," for instance, if they were not found so perceptually attractive as to motivate one to continue to watch them? But attractiveness is not sufficient; not everything that is interesting to perception is "graceful." A further qualification for gracefulness seems to be a special dynamic quality. In the very process of being attracted to the object, attention infuses the graceful object with a certain fluidity of motion. Consider, for example, the figure of Adam in Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, perhaps not the most obvious example of gracefulness, but one with which everyone is familiar. A continuously modulated movement throughout the supple limbs and rippling muscles unmistakably contributes to the figure's gracefulness. These dynamics are not induced by the moving eye; even if one fastens one's eyes on a fixed point the motion continues. But repetitions of shapes, textures, colors, light and shadow, and line can all inspire extended discrimination through the principle of similarity. The progress of our focal scanning is manifest as a purely phenomenal sweeping motion coursing the length of the figure. This same phenomenal fluidity can occur in music and other media as well. Music is the movement of sounds varying in intensity against a backdrop of silence through two directions simultaneously-pitch and time. But what actually moves? The tones themselves merely succeed one another. Again, the connecting factor would seem to be our own focal activity, since the fewer similarities and repetitions there are to track among the sounds 398</page><page sequence="7">Aesthetic Qualities the more antikinetic the music becomes. What makes any given music graceful has to be a succession of tones ordered in such a way as to heighten the discrimination of similarities and proportions while at the same time permitting the process to flow easily from one sound or squadron of sounds to another. The graceful "Skater's Waltz" has these qualities, and it clearly exhibits this sort of fluidity. In the area of expository writing, when is it we attribute gracefulness? It seems to be when the ideas are so arranged that we pass from one to the other in a smooth, unhindered way. No matter what the medium, fluid dynamics seem an integral part of a thing's gracefulness. But there is yet a third phenomenal factor necessary for gracefulness and that is the gentle feel of it. A fluid object which feels strong is more likely to be called vital or dynamic or even powerful, depending on the intensity of the sensation. Consider again the Creation of Adam. The figure of God satisfies our first two criteria, attractiveness and a flow of focal energy. But the focal process in this figure builds to a crescendo and flashes across the gap between the outstretched fingers like psychic lightning. This great God-mass is more "powerful," than "graceful." The "feel" of Adam is gentle (though perhaps on the high side) because the discrimination of his features, while absorbing, is not difficult. But the mantle of God shelters a host of angelic cherubim. These beings resemble God in their anthropomorphic shapes, and they jut out at various angles to His form. Like the fins of the M-L illusion they thus become distractions by the principle of similarity. The effect is to slow and make more difficult the focal flow along the otherwise smooth lines of the divine body. The kinesthetic sensations correlated with these increased activities therefore become far more intense than in the Adam, creating the impression of great power. This difference in feeling tone between the graceful Adam and the powerful God serves to demonstrate that the third criterion of "graceful" is a feeling tone that falls into the lower range of intensity. I shall therefore define "gracefulness" as the attractive and gently fluid dynamics attributable to any object of experience in virtue of the particular focal operations elicited in the discrimination of that object. It's antonym, "clumsiness,"seems simply to be the slightly repellent absence of gracefulness where our aesthetic interest has led us to expect it. I submit that one cannot find a single instance in which any of the following statements, when intended in the aesthetic sense, is true: This is graceful but is not attractive in any way. This is graceful but it lacks any sort of fluidity. This is graceful but it does not have the feel of gentleness to it. V. Cohen's challenge to the aestheticians is to determine which of the many sorts of predicates normally ascribed to artworks should count as A qualities. The analysis of "gracefulness" helps us see that aesthetic qualities are definable, but we have yet to arrive at the general characteristics that distinguish the great variety of A qualities from all others. Several aestheticians, among them Monroe Beardsley,39 have in recent years proposed that A qualities are those which can be given as reasons for the aesthetic value of anything. Presumably, a reason would be anything that would satisfy the "because" in sentences approximating the form, "This is aesthetically good because it is X." But while the formula may serve as a test for distinguish- ing A qualities from non-A qualities, it by no means tells us what makes an A quality different. The problem is complicated by the apparently unnoticed fact that aesthetic value- grounding reasons fall into two very different sorts of categories. Terms in one category seems to constitute a sufficient condition for the aesthetic worth of the object to which they are predicated: beautiful, gorgeous, graceful, delicate, etc. It is an apparent contradiction to say, for example, "This is graceful, but it has no aesthetic value." The terms in the other set of reasons have no such implication: unified, diversified, balanced, soft, tense. For example, "This is balanced but it has no aesthetic value," implies no contradiction even though "balanced" here has the same meaning as in "This is good (in part) because it is balanced." With. such very different subsets of value reasons, we shall have to dig much deeper than the proposed "value-grounding" criterion to determine what makes any given quality an A quality. I propose we attempt to classify the kinds of terms Cohen has questioned according to what they appear to designate in aesthetic 399</page><page sequence="8">LIND experience, as it has been described through microphenomenology. All properties, qualities, relations, and events involved in this experi- ence, I have said, tend to appear as qualities of the object. While the listing of terms in each of the following categories is subject to revision, the categories themselves have been arrived at by careful analysis. However, even these categories do not necessarily exhaust the possibilities consistent with our theory. (1) Attentional Valence. There should be, on the present theory, terms which refer only to the fact that the object is attractive, or, if it disappoints our aesthetic interest, repellent. Such terms as beautiful, gorgeous, lovely, pretty, handsome, and comely in some of their uses come close to fulfilling the positive side of this category, while attractive, fascinat- ing,and interesting accomplish it with even greater purity. Such terms seem to differ in degree (beautiful and attractive are more often used to indicate easy, rapid discrimination, while fascinating and interesting indicate greater difficulty though beauty when used as the generic term for this category, is often divided into "easy" and "difficult"). Used in a purely aesthetic sense, terms like hideous, ugly, strident, garish, and homely tend to be used when the object is found repellent either because the composition poses an overwhelm- ing difficulty in finding intelligibility or because repulsiveness of a nonaesthetic sort opposes any aesthetic interest in discriminating the objects. (2) Dynamics. We should also find pred- icates referring to phenomenal movement, which is nothing more than the manifestation of attentional processes. Such words seem to include balanced, rhythmic, lyric, unified, tightly knit, loose, and linear. These are purely dynamic terms, in that they do not appear to include attraction, repulsion, or other factors. (3) Feelings. There are many terms refer- ring to kinesthetic and visceral sensations stirred by enhanced discriminatory processes. Thrilling, restful, soothing, moving, charming, and exciting all refer to the object's capacity to elicit such feelings. But these are not pure references to feeling since they also indicate attractiveness, just as boring and tedious indicate negative feelings. Terms which refer purely to the "feel" of an object are: hard, soft, strong, gentle, rough, jagged, rugged, and smooth. These terms refer to attentionally- elicited kinesthetic feelings experienced as a quality of the object. (4) Intelligibility. Our microphenomenolog- ical hypothesis holds that discrimination is a process of making intelligible the internal relations of the object. Consequently, we should find terms that refer purely to the intelligibility of the object as well. Included are such terms as clear, paradoxical, ambig- uous, intelligible, obscure, simple, and co- mplex. And since recognition plays a large part in intelligibility this category should also include realistic, impressionistic, painterly, abstract, and nonobjective. (5) Compositional Arrangement. What we strive to make intelligible are the relations of similarity, difference, and proportion among the elements. Terms indicative of such arrange- ments are diversified, variegated, flat, golden section, geometrical, muted, minimal, telling contrast, Gothic, style of Beethoven, and classical. (6) Valanced Compounds. Many of the terms used in reference to artworks tend to designate a positive or negative valence combined with one or more of the other features. Some are like "graceful" in that they seem to indicate both attractiveness and dynamics, often coupled with a certain feeling as well. These positive dynamic complexes seem to include graceful, vital, powerful, fiery, majestic, delicate, robust, and organic while among the negative ones are clumsy, lifeless, anemic, and flamboyant. When we identify the patterns of feeling in an aesthetic object with human emotions we seem to imply that some of them possess positive aesthetic interest: serene, joyous, gay, somber, melan- choly, spiritual, exalted, romantic, tragic, sad, and wistful. Pompous, oppressive, and sentimental, on the other hand, clearly indicate feelings with negative aesthetic valence. Positively valanced intelligibility is signalled by vivid, fresh, consonant, and profound, while examples of negative intelligibility are murky, trite, dissonant, and shallow or superficial. And when we speak of grandeur or richness we seem to be alluding to attractive compositional relations. Admittedly, not every term on Cohen's list falls into one or the other of these six categories, but their exclusion can be explained. Many of Cohen's terms, for instance, are clearly references to some nonaesthetic aspect of certain artworks. Our interest in certain 400</page><page sequence="9">Aesthetic Qualities qualities of artworks is sometimes moral, religious, or cognitive rather than aesthetic. For that reason such terms as metaphysical, introspective, moralistic, religious, and dida- ctic fall outside the aesthetic realm. Besides these, Cohen lists items which truly refer not to characteristics of the object but to the intention of the artist: daring, serious, and sincere, for instance. Others merely draw a comparison: derivative and Kafkaesque, for instance. Popular merely names the artist. So it seems that all those characteristics listed by Cohen that could count as.aesthetic qualities can be classified under one or more of our six categories. Our microphenomonological classification, if correct, demonstrates that when "aesthetic" is applied to qualities it does not have exactly the same meaning as when applied to objects. According to our theory, objects are aesthetic only if our spontaneous discrimination of them is of sufficient magnitude to engage a practical interest in that discrimination. But nearly all of our candidates for A qualities-valence, dynam- ics, feelings, and intelligibility-are, jointly or severally, aspects of the process of discrimi- nation itself, not qualities to which attention is drawn. They therefore cannot qualify as A qualities on the grounds that they are, like the objects, highly attractive. I shall try to make the case that an A quality is any characteristic the attribution of which to any object implies that that object is aesthetic, as "aesthetic object" has been herein defined. We need, however, to distinguish a strong sense and a weak sense, respectively, of "imply": (1) strict logical implication and (2) "suggestion," or contextual implication. Both senses of "imply" are intended in this definition of "aesthetic quality." By the very definitions we have given them, characteristics falling within two of our categories, (1) attentional valence and 6) valanced compounds, imply in the strong sense that their objects are aesthetic. Since objects are, according to our definition, aesthetic if attractive in the specified manner and degree, any term which indicates that the object to which it is predicated is attractive in this way, as for example, beautiful, gorgeous, or pretty do, logically implies that the object is an aesthetic one. Any valanced complex, e.g., graceful or delicate, makes the same implication. However, since none of the other categories contain this essential ingredient, they cannot make such a strict implication. I submit, then, that only the two aforementioned categQries are true aesthetic concepts, whose meaning guarantees by definition that their objects are aesthetic when the term is used in its aesthetic sense. The terms in the other four categories do not, of themselves, strictly imply that their object is aesthetic. To say of a shape that it is unified (dynamics), hard (feeling), clear (intelligibility), or minimal (arrangement) carries with it no necessity that the shape is aesthetic even when those terms are used in the sense applicable to an aesthetic object. Sibley is therefore mistaken to claim the terms in these categories are "aesthetic concepts." Why, then, have most aestheticians treated them as A qualities? The reason, I believe, is that when we find an object aesthetic we are aware that these aspects of the object somehow participate in the aesthetic character of the object. For instance, the very process of being attracted to any masterpiece both brings out its unity and makes manifest the many compared elements, its diversity, from which this unity emerges. Unity and diversity are therefore an integral part of the experience. As a result, we take this particular unity and this particular diversity to be factors in our attraction to this specific object. It would seem, then, that our references to these qualities under these circumstances are intended to imply in the weaker sense that the object is aesthetic in virtue of having the qualities. We succeed in conveying the suggestion that the object is aesthetic by the specific linguistic manner or circumstances in which we refer to the quality. Often we do this by offering the quality as a reason for the object's value: "This is good because it hangs together so well" (unity). Clearly we would not use it as a reason if we did not think of the quality as in some way contributory to the object's aestheticness. But we also can suggest a quality's involvement in an aesthetic object just by using intensifying modifiers: "Such a sense of calm!" "So unified!" "How com- plex!" And frequently an aesthetic implication can be conveyed just because there would be no other reason to mention a quality: "Look at the soft edges on those clouds." Most often the implication is communicated simply because the aesthetic context has already been set up, as when we know we are reading a critical review. By "suggestion," then, I mean 401</page><page sequence="10">LIND not verbal implication but speaker implication; the speaker is able to convey to the listener what he or she means by reason of (a) what is actually said, and (b) the tacit circumstances the significance of which both parties under- stand. As Arnold Isenberg put it in "Critical Communication,"4 the speaker uses her terms in these cases to point to what she experienced (an aesthetic object). If correct, this account vindicates those who use as criteria for distinguishing A qualities their capacity to be cited as reasons for aesthetic value judgments. For if the attribution of a quality in any way implies that an object is aesthetic, it also must imply that the object has value as an aesthetic object. After all, can an object be aesthetic and not have any aesthetic value? Our analysis has shown why terms like graceful or gorgeous will always support a value judgment while flowing, soft, ambiguous, or geometrical will only do so on occasion. VI. The microphenomenological theory can now be shown to meet all the serious challenges to psychological aesthetics reviewed at the outset of this essay: (a) To the observation that many A quality attributions are natural, easy, and obvious, we may reply that our world is full of things like beautiful sunsets and elegant people, the mere apprehension of which stimulates a discrimi- nation of sufficient magnitude to make us want more, unless we are so "set" on merely recognizing what is before us that discrimi- nation is firmly precluded. (b) The objection that "sensitivity" is required for non-A qualities as well as A qualities is easily accommodated by noting that aesthetic sensitivity is not the mere ability to analyze details. It is the capacity to be reflectively alert for attractive phenomena, an attitude adopted in order to allow any potential aesthetic experience to flower fully. (c) It has been claimed that, since both A and non-A qualities appear to aesthetic perception, the manner of perception cannot be the determinant of A qualities. But our theory does not specify that A qualities are consistently generated solely by a specific kind of perception-taste for example; it bases the appearance of A qualities on the degree of perceptual activity and the participation of the quality in the attraction. The non-A qualities that appear in the aesthetic experience are those that fail to satisfy these conditions. (d) It has been noted that aesthetic qualities can be observed even when perception is guided by nonaesthetic interests. Our theory, however, does allow for the coexistence of aesthetic interest with other sorts of interest. Since we have defined aesthetic interest as any interest which takes as its intrinsic goal the state of being attracted by some compositional arrangement, any other interest which takes this state of attraction as a means to another, ulterior goal would be perfectly compatible with it as long as both were able to be satisfied. A long lustful look, for instance, could subserve one's erotic impulses while at the same time enabling one to savor a person's gracefulness. The word "curvaceous" seems to convey just this combination of interests. (e) Finally, there is Cohen's list of divergent properties attributable to works of art. One important test of a definition is to determine whether it is coextensive with the term it defines. As we saw, all but those terms clearly unrelated to aesthetic character seem to conform nicely to our theory. But even if in fact they do not, the underlying theory makes it at least possible to correct or amend the category list through more careful inspection. I should like to suggest the possibility that the microphenomenological approach could be to aesthetics what the Darwinian hypothesis has been to biology, though in a far more modest way, of course. That is, it can serve as the theoretical basis for a taxonomy of attributes previously classified only according to intu- itive similarities or differences. It gives us a way to explore the phenomena in terms of their etiology. Such explorations will undoubtedly lead to more exact reformulations or perhaps even outright rejection of the theory outlined here, but at least our approach to aesthetic qualities will have gotten beyond the stage of treating them as mere brute facts, as some of our leading aestheticians are now willing to do.

These events are the how of perception, the dynamics of the phenomenal field during our perception of intentional objects. Hypotheses about these events, I hold, have certain implications that we can detect if the hypotheses are true. 18 The mechanics of these focal activities and the evidence for them have been detailed in my "Attention and the Aesthetic Object," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 39, no. 2, 131-42. 19 Ibid., pp. 136-39. 20 Stanley Coren and Joan Ster Girgus, Seeing is Deceiving: The Psychology of Visual Illusions (Hillsdale, N.J., 1978), p. 32. 21 Throughout Coren and Girgus's survey of theories (Ibid.), the limitations of every major theory regarding the M-L are cited.
