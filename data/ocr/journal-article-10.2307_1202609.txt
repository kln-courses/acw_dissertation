<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Religion exploration of the rich inner lives of two female subjects; and his brief discus- sions of the potential contributions of maternal imagery to the idea of God demonstrate a sensitivity to these concerns. There are, however, limitations to the analysis. McDargh purports to offer a paradigm relevant to all religions: he sees faith as a "universal human dynamic that cuts across lines of belief and barriers of culture" (p. 5). But the argument falls far short of the universality toward which it aims: the substan- tive understanding of religion offered by McDargh necessitates a personal, theistic deity. As he says, "human religiousness . .in order to be genuinely religious, must somehow be configured as personal" (p. 10; see also p. 105). Are the only true faiths, then, theistic? Must God be imaged as personal, anthropomorphic, transcendent, and other than self, for a religion to qualify as genuine? What of monistic Hinduism, in which Brahman, the divine, is neither personal nor other than self? What of Theravada Buddhism, which postulates no divinity and no self? This study falls prey to a danger common to many psychological studies of religion, not the least of which is Freud's: Western monotheism provides the definition and the norm; all else falls out- side of the category and is either ignored or relegated to a lower position in the developmental hierarchy. One can find no quarrel with McDargh's contention that object relations theory is a powerful model for understanding the origins of human religiosity. However, his neglect of certain essential elements of human faith is trouble- some. There are, in fact, resources in object relations theory for a more uni- versal and less ethnocentric vision of human religiosity. The potential of object relations theory as a paradigm for understanding religion remains, in this book, incompletely tapped. There are other minor limitations, including the lack of an index, and the very transparent origin of the book as a doctoral dissertation (Harvard Uni- versity, 1981). Nevertheless, these flaws do not obscure the value and signifi- cance of the ideas. McDargh has created a richly interwoven tapestry, of interest to both the generalist and the specialist. He lucidly demonstrates the great value of psychoanalytic object relations theory as a resource for address- ing a central problem in the psychology of faith development: the role of the representation of God in the life of faith. DIANE JONTE-PACE, University of Santa Clara. KITAGAWA, JOSEPH M., ed. The History of Religions: Retrospect and Prospect. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1985. xix + 186 pp. $19.95 (cloth). This volume includes papers of the second conference on the history of reli- gions held at the University of Chicago in 1983 by Ugo Bianchi, Mircea Eliade, Joseph Kitagawa, Charles Long, Michel Meslin, Paul Ricoeur, Kurt Rudolph, and Ninian Smart, an introduction and an afterword. With the exceptions of Eliade and Ricoeur, the papers and the discussion summarized in the afterword reflect upon the history and future of the history and phe- nomenology of religion. This volume should be a valuable document for those unfamiliar with this field of study and Chicago's contribution to its develop- ment. Eliade's paper attempts to connect modern descendents of Homo faber with 226</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Homo religiosus. Although the documentation is not convincing, the last sentence should help clarify his position: "Of course, certain homini religiosi may add that it depends on every one of us to learn how to reach the highest state of consciousness, namely the awareness of pure Being" (p. 11). Ricoeur's paper is a meditation on "The History of Religions and the Phenomenology of Time Consciousness." The connection between the two is not clear, but the notion that "there may be a recurrence of rhythmic patterns without circular- ity" (p. 23) is an interesting revision of sacred time as purely cyclical. Meslin's paper is an accurate presentation of the past and present in the history and phenomenology of religion, the autonomy of the discipline, oppo- sition to theology, the Wholly Other, reductionism, the concepts sacred/ profane, religious symbolism, and the need to move beyond "mere historical research" (p. 47). Instead of trying to construct a morphology of the sacred, he rightly suggests our need to "reflect on its syntax" (p. 41). However, his asser- tion that a being, animal, or object "possesses a specific immutable nature" (p. 41) is surely an odd syntactic notion. Bianchi's essay on "Current Method- ological Issues" seems to indicate that he has mellowed. But I found the dialectical relations between "historical" and "systematic" research and the var- ious paragraphs on definitions difficult to follow. Smart's paper on "The History of Religions and Its Conversation Partners" is an overly optimistic view of the possible "import" and "export" opportunities between the history of religions and other disciplines. He remains convinced that "there is a case for thinking of the study of religions as the study (more broadly) of worldview" (p. 74). This seems to be a case of solving problems by substituting one label for another. Charles Long provides the reader with a fine overview of the "Chicago Tra- dition." He ends with doubts about ever fulfilling the expectations for a science of religion and suggests that "our goal would then not be a science, but a serious human discourse" (p. 102). Rudolph argues for an integration rather than a reduction of theories of religion, and his stress on the cultic, on "praxis," leads him to conclude that "that historian of religions is mistaken who believes that mythology as such, including symbolics, provides access to the 'heart of religion'" (p. 112). Whom does he have in mind? Moreover, we are not informed as to how we may integrate theories incompatible with each other. The final paper by Kitagawa reflects upon the contributions of Religion- swissenschaft. He cites the critique of the "overly rationalistic view [of religion] and [the] blindness to the transcendental referent of religion" (p. 133), but then he concludes that the term "'religion' does not refer to any ontological reality but to a reality once removed from religions, somewhat like making generalized statements about 'language,' which is a reality once removed from language" (p. 140). "The history of religions," he asserts, "urgently needs to articulate its own identity and to define its own mode of relating to other fields of inquiry, instead of allowing other disciplines to define the relationships from their perspectives" (p. 133). The afterword is an attempt to describe "the dialectic of the Parts and the Whole" (p. 145) and seems to be about the conflict between "methodological individualism" and "holism." Since I do not fully understand it, making a critical judgment is difficult. For those who know, the book can be summed up as follows: Plus qa change, plus c'est la meme chose. HANS H.
