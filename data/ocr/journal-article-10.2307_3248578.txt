<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yaksas I, p. 7 and II, p. 4), or as a totemic or agrarian god (Foucher, in Getty, Ganesa, pp. xxi- xxii)-Mr. Aravamuthan has contrived, with con- siderable imagination, a case for an exclusively Vedic provenience of the elephant-headed Lord of Obstacles. Having searched the Vedas (largely by the way of Macdonell's Vedic Mythology) for the earliest evi- dences, not of an animal-headed or of an elephant god, but of the concept of a divine being who interposes and removes obstacles and is likewise a lord of wisdom and leader of hosts, Mr. Arava- muthan suggests that there must have taken place "an assimilation of features of the Maruts and of Brhaspati" (p. 9) at a time "when the literature of the Rg-Vedic milieu was still in the process of active growth" (p. 17). "Through the tendency, characteristic of the Rg-Vedic age, to compare the gods to animals," he continues, "this god, anthropo- morphic at this stage, was apparently coming to be thought of also as an elephant, in recognition of similarities fancied to subsist between the gods of whom he was made and the animal. This se- condary fancy of an animal-god on all fours appears to have again given place, in course of time, to the primary fancy of the god in the erect form, in answer to the imperative preference for an anthropomorphic over a theriomorphic god" (pp. 20-21). The pot-belly of the upright elephant, finally, conduced to yaksa assimilations. No concrete evidence is presented, however, to illustrate the course of this development. "Not unless we are willing to allow," writes Mr. Arava- muthan (pp. I8-20), "for developments for which there can be no testimony in the material remains which have survived to us may we hope to progress in the elucidation of the transformations of Rg-Ve- dic ideas in later times." One cannot quarrel with Mr. Aravamuthan's pro- posal to give primary consideration rather to the history of the concept that informs a deity than to the comparison of his shape with similar shapes in different cultural contexts, serving differing functions. Nor is the tentative positing of the coalescence of a number of Vedic gods too bold a step for careful scholarship. Certainly, however, when a bridge of fancy is all that leads from this hypothetical Vedic god through a millennium of time to the first concrete evidences of Ganesa, many will feel less certain than the fashioner of the bridge that the problem has been solved. Mr. Ara- vamuthan appears to have begged the question. 7oseph Campbell Verrier Elwin: The Tribal Art of Middle India, A Personal Record, Oxford University Press, i95i. 21z pp. 30s. To the valuable publications of Verrier Elwin on the hill peoples of Middle India this attractively il- lustrated and composed little book supplies, for the layman, an inviting introduction, and, for the specialist, a delightful supplement. Two hundred and twenty-nine photographs and line drawings il- lustrating the folk arts of the Gonds, Baigas, Agarias, Marias, Murias, Bondos, Saoras, Gadabas, etc., of the Central Provinces, Orissa, and Bihar have been elucidated by a terse, sensitive, gently humorous text. Dr. Elwin's personal devotion to the people in whose squalid villages he has dwelt for two decades and his intelligent respect and care for their hu- manity have given to this book, as to all his writings, a vitality and profundity, as well as seasoned knowledge, unusual in the scriptures of anthropo- logy. He is extraordinarily sensitive, moreover, to the aesthetic qualities of the precious evidences he 294</page><page sequence="2">has gleaned of an unselfconscious art that has all but disappeared with the transformation and dis- integration of the cultures that it served. "I have called this book a personal record," writes Dr. Elwin in his Preface, "because nearly all of it is the result of my own original research in the field.... Had I raided the museums for material, the book would have been fuller and more repre- sentative, but it would have been neither new nor mine." The book is, indeed, new; and it abounds in in- sights into the relationship of its charming materials to the joys, pains, and intimacies of Indian village life. The opening chapters on the decoration of the body and the art of tribal dress are followed by particular notices of the cowrie, the comb, the head-dress, and tobacco cases. These suffice to introduce and differentiate the several tribes. Sub- sequent chapters on the wedding, fantasy, funerary pillars, the decoration of walls and doors, totemic emblems, and the human figure, enrich the rendi- tion of the social and spiritual world of these vestigial yet warmly living cultures. An amusing chapter is devoted to the worship of Sahibosum, "a local cult, apparently confined to the Hill Saoras of the Ganjam District, which aims at keeping divine and human visitors out of the way". There follow short but suggestive sections on the dance, the mask, the peacock, the elephant, and the hunt, a fine chapter on the cult of Bhimul (Bhimsen of the Mahabhdrata) among the Konds, and a brief notice of a series of Kond pillars that once were associated with human sacrifice. The volume con- cludes with an excellent presentation and discussion of the ceremonial wall paintings of the Saora. Yoseph Campbell Orientalische Teppiche aus vier _ahrhunderten, Ausstellung im Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg 1950. 9 pp, 49 illustrations. During the war Germany lost a great part of its important collection of Oriental rugs which were in the Islamic Department of the German State Museum. On March I , 1945, eighteen of the most valuable rugs were destroyed through a direct bomb hit on one of the storage places of the State Museum. The exhibition arranged in Hamburg brought together the more important pieces re- maining in museums and private collections of Germany. Since the great exhibition of Muham- medan art in Munich held in 191o, there was no attempt made in Germany to arrange an exhibition of Oriental rugs. Besides rugs from several collect- ions in Munich, particularly the National Museum, the Residenz Museum, the Ethnographical Museum and the City Gallery, the exhibition contained pieces from the museums at Frankfurt, Cologne, Diisseldorf and Essen. Many rugs from the rich collection of the Bemheimer Gallery of Munich were also shown. In addition, new acquisitions of the Hamburg Museum of Art and Industry formed part of this exhibition. The catalogue of the exhibition was written by Dr. Kurt Erdmann, at present Professor of Islamic Art at the University at Istanbul. All known types of rugs from Turkey, Egypt, Persia, the Caucasus, India and Spain were well represented. M. S.
