<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VICTORIANNESS OF THOMAS HARDY Thomas Hardy, the greatest English writer of our time, was not of our time only. He stood alone not only for the height of his achievement but for the length of his span. His earliest poems are dated 1865?the year of Essays in Criticism and Sesame and Lilies. His first novel was published in 1871, the year of Darwin's Descent of Man. After a series of novels covering twenty-five years, novels that have set his name among the foremost in English fiction, he turned irrevocably to the poetry he had first and always sought, and produced, amid the stream of lyrics of unflagging vigor and vitality, The Dynasts, the most significant poem of our age. He has lived to be hailed as master, even in his own land, to hear the English public acclaim the very novels it at first attacked, and to be revered by the younger writers, as Rebecca West has said, as "a kind of saint". The younger generation is hardly wont to seek its saints among the Victorians. It would indignantly deny that the author of Tess of the D' Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure was, in any sense of that abused term, a Victorian. And if, as it usually assumes, Victorianism were simply complacency, compromise, and cant, Hardy would be its very antithesis. But it is only of the first decades of Victoria's reign, the age of the first Locksley Hall, that these terms can be fairly used. The period that opened in 1859 with The 07'igin of Species, with the immortal duel between Bishop Wilberforce and Huxley, and the explosion over Essays aud Reviews, was stirred to its depths by ardent controversy. In the words of one of its greatest spokes men: "Those years?say from i860 to 1890?were an animated, hopeful, interesting, and on the whole, either by reason of, or in spite of, its perpetual polemics, a happy generation ... a generation of intrepid effort forward." 1 And some of the root ideas of Hardy's work, the great themes that resound from the ^ohn Morley : Recollections,</page><page sequence="2">The Victoriamtess of Thomas Hardy 311 early lyrics through the novels to The Dynasts, are themes that were beaten out of the struggles of those fighting sixties and seventies, themes that echo through the writings of George Eliot and Matthew Arnold, of Mill and Morley, of Leslie Ste phen and Huxley. To trace a few of these recurrent Victorian problems in Hardy's work may quicken our sense of his art. For with all his intense ?and Victorian?absorption in prob lems, Hardy was first and last artist, not thinker. Critics who would pluck out the heart of his philosophy in a formula would do well to heed his own warnings. Of one of his volumes of poems, for example, he writes that it will be found to possess "little cohesion of thought or harmony of coloring". And he adds significantly : "I do not greatly regret this. Unadjusted impressions have their value, and the road to a true philosophy of life seems to be in humbly recording diverse readings of its phenomena as they are forced upon us by chance."2 True it is that from the art of Hardy, as from all great art, there emerges a philosophy?the tragic metaphysic finely interpreted by Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie and others: the human spirit eternally frustrated in its struggle with "the implacable, impersonal drift of things". But, as always in art, the real unity of Hardy's work is that of personality rather than of logic. And the prevailing sombreness of Hardy's "twilight view of life", as Meredith once called it, is made up of hues as various as the blended shades of a twilight landscape. Nowhere are these diverse moods more striking and more like echoes of the striving voices of the age than in Hardy's various interpretations of that aspect of the mystery of things that we call Nature. And nowhere is his art more sure. To many of Hardy's readers, Wessex is more real than their own town ships. In novels like Far from the Madding Crowd or The Woodlanders, Nature herself is the real protagonist, and the lives of farmers and foresters are one with her vast processes. Sheep-shearing and harvesting, the waxing and waning of love, are as much a part of the cycle of the seasons as summer's heat 2 Preface to Poems of the Past and Present, 1901.</page><page sequence="3">312 The Sewanee Review and winter's storm. "Natural processes", Hardy says of Tess, "seemed part of her own story." In this poetic rendering of the interwoven life of man and Nature, Hardy often recalls Wordsworth. Scenes like the magnificent starlit hilltop at the opening of Far from the Madd?7ig Crowd, or the midsummer eve in The Woodlanders, carry us back to A Night Piece and The Prelude. Hardy's Gabriel Oak and Wordsworth's Michael are brothers in a dignity undwarfed by the grandeur of their moors and hills. But the likeness ends there. Over against the "beauteous forms" of Tintern Abbey, the . . . sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns And the round ocean and the living air And the blue sky, and in the heart of man, arises the twilight majesty of Egdon Heath, "singularly colossal and mysterious in its swarthy monotony". Whether or not Egdon Heath is, as Hardy suggests, the typicai scene for the nature-lover of the future, its "lonely face, suggesting tragical possibilities", is the symbol of Hardy's view of Nature. Here is his grim retort to the Wordsworthian idealization of Nature: "Some people would like to know whence the poet whose philos ophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is sweet and pure, gets his authority for speaking of 'Nature's holy plan'." 3 For Hardy's protest against the romantic conception of a beneficent Nature is the very voice of mid-nineteenth-century rationalism. Not only the scientists, but the poets, and even the theologians, had shaken the older sentimental deism "that looked from Nature up to Nature's God." The new science that revealed a "Nature red in tooth and claw with ravin" had permeated literature, finding a voice in the poignant question ings of hi Memoriam. Even that stronghold of orthodoxy, Butler's Analogy, had conceded that a world so full of evil was not the strongest proof of a beneficent God, and had confirmed 8 Tess of the D ' Urbervilles.</page><page sequence="4">The Victorianness of Thomas Hardy 313 James Mill in his refusal to believe that the Creator of such a world could combine infinite power with perfect goodness. And it was his more famous son, John Stuart Mill, who penned in his essay on Nature an indictment of the wanton waste and cruelty of "nature's every day performances" that transformed his cold logic into literature. His verdict (concluded the year before Darwin published the Origin of Species'), that human conduct must amend, not imitate, the course of Nature, recalls Arnold's "Man must begin, know this, where nature ends", and anticipates Huxley's famous judgment in Evolution and Ethics (1893): "Let us understand, once for all, that the ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less in running away from it, but in combatting it". Or, as paraphrased by a modern scientist: "The conquest of nature, not the imitation of nature, is the whole duty of man." Hardy, writing amid the battle for the new science, is steeped in its teachings. Like George Eliot, the pioneer of the novel of ideas, he not only turns scientific facts to imaginative uses, but makes his grey stories instances of the inexorable laws of char acter and circumstance. So Tess and the milkmaids are victims of "an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature's law". And like Mill, Hardy is driven to deep indignation at what Jude calls "the scorn of Nature for man's finer emotions". With Sue, he cries out, "Oh, why should Nature's law be mutual butchery?" With Phillotson, he declares, "Cruelty is the law pervading all Nature and Society." But side by side with the scientist's conception of Nature, with the humanist's indictment of her, we find utterly different images. In one of the earliest novels, A Pair of Blue Eyes, (1873), there is a scene that vividly illustrates this antinomy. The hero is hanging in deadly peril on the face of the terrible precipice over which he has slipped. "He could only look sternly at Nature's treacherous attempt to put an end to him, and strive to thwart her." As he struggles, the imbedded fossil that catches his eye sends his geologist's mind in a momentary sweep through the centuries, surveying the mon</page><page sequence="5">314 The Sewanee Review strous procession of life in a flash of the scientist's imagination. The next instant his mind swings back to the primeval imagin ings of the "musing, weather-beaten West-country folks" : he confronts, not the Nature of law and science, but the cruel Be ing of lawless caprice. The very wind whose current he had rashly attempted to test, now seems a cosmic agent of hostility, "active, lashing, eager for conquest". The philosophic import of this scene is as striking as is its dramatic effect. Nature is seen in successive flashes as imper sonal law and as lawless being. Logically, the scene is a paradox; artistically, it expresses two phases, the reasoned and the emotional, of Hardy's revolt. It is possible to interpret these phases, as does Dr. Samuel C. Chew in his recent study, as successive stages in the growth of Hardy's thought from an earlier anthropomorphic conception of Nature, first as conspir ator against Man, then as a fellow-sufferer with Man, to a later scientific determinism. But inasmuch as the old indignation against Nature flames out in the passages just quoted from the very last novel, while the personifications recur throughout the poetry, one may, I think, take them quite simply as expressions of varying mood rather than stages of systematic thought. For Hardy is first and always the artist, now seizing the new con ceptions of science, now recalling the age-old pagan traditions of Wessex folk-lore, finally creating his own image for Nature, the blind, groping "Sleep-Walker" of his poetry. And it is deeply characteristic of his own spirit that the recurrent note of the lyrics in which Nature is thus personified is that of pity for her blindness rather than indignation for her unconscious cruel ties. Thus he pictures Nature the Mother mourning her unwit ting ways to man and thus appeals to her children's mercy: Deal, then, her groping skill no scorn ; no note of malediction, Assist her when thy creaturely dependence can or may. For thou art of her clay.4 This linking of Nature and Man is the one note of likeness between Hardy's dealing with Nature and that "reading of 4"The Lacking Sense."</page><page sequence="6">The Victorianness of Thomas Hardy 315 Earth" that is the recurrent theme of Meredith's poetry. No groping sleep-walker is Meredith's Earth: This Earth of the beautiful breasts Shining up in all colours aflame. She is a "Mother of grace", seemingly heedless of Man's cries, slayer of the weaklings, yet "showing a kind face and sweet" to those of her children who live by her laws. For earth is truly our "feeding root", the Mother not only of our blood, but of brain, and spirit, that "Triad" of our slowly growing powers. Thus human life is a struggle, not as with Huxley and Mill, away from Nature, but into fuller harmony with her: She being spirit in her clods Footway to the God of Gods.5 Earth and Man is Meredith's noble song of man's struggle with the "shapeless and the dun" without, and "the passion Self" within?a struggle through which he wins to order and beauty and oneness with the law and purpose of Earth: He builds the soaring spires That sing his soul in stone : of her he draws, Though blind to her, by spelling at her laws, Her purest fires. If he aloft for aid Imploring storms, her essence is the spur. Her cry to heaven is a cry to her He would evade. And her desires are those For happiness, for lastingness, for light. Such moments of tragic experience in which Earth brings to the stricken spirit strength and healing are disclosed in the poem A Faith on Trial and in the crisis of Richard Fever el, the prose poem "Nature Speaks." So Spirit and Earth are finally at one * For love we Earth, then serve we all ; Her mystic secret then is ours.6 Meredith's faith in Earth, a faith rooted in science but flower ing into a kind of mysticism, finds few echoes among his con 5 " Woods of Westermain." 6 " The Truth in February."</page><page sequence="7">3i6 The Sewanee Review temporaries. But his hope of Man's ultimate self-conquest links him with that great hope of the nineteenth century which was replacing the old beneficent Providence by the new religion of Humanity. Does Hardy, too, share the high hopes for human destiny that illumine the grave rationalism of a Mill, a George Eliot, a John Morley? For Hardy's conception of our social order, we must turn to his latest novels, Tess and Jude. In the earlier novels, society is simple, static, a background almost as changeless as the heath itself. Warren's malthouse and the Casterbridge bystreets furnish, it is true, chorus and comment for the action of the drama; but the destinies of Gabriel Oak and Michael Henshard are wrought not by social forces, not even by a blind Nature of nescient will, but by their own endurances and passions. In Tess of the D' Urbervilles, however, Society becomes an active force determining the heroine's fate by its conventions. And it is against the social rather than the natural order that Hardy hurls his indictment. Tess, "an almost typical woman", is the victim of "an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in nature." Clare, the cultured idealist, is yet the slave of con vention, of the aesthetic tradition with "its abhorrence of the unintact state". Clare's spurning of Tess, his tragic failure to understand her real spiritual integrity, is the sentence of a blind social order. Yet there are passages in which Hardy's con sistency is swept aside by outbursts of indignation against the frame of things entire, "the fundamental injustice of man's existence", passages such as the famous but irrelevant con clusion: "Justice was done, and the President of the Im mortals . . . had ended his sport with Tess." What need had Hardy of a malignant deity as scape-goat for his great novel of man's inhumanity to man? Jude the Obscure is likewise presented as the victim of social convention, of "the artificial scheme of things under which the normal sex-impulses are turned into devilish domestic gins and springes to noose and hold back those who want to progress". But here the case against Society is weakened, not only by the folly of the first marriage of both Jude and Sue, but by the</page><page sequence="8">The Viet o?Harme s s of Thomas Hardy 317 very natures of two beings so unfitted for marriage as the absorbed student and the sensitive ethereal girl, "a distinct type . . . intended by Nature to be left intact". Here, far more than in Tess, the tragic issue is blurred by Hardy's blanket indictment of Nature, Society, and whatever Powers there be. If the human will is indeed doomed to eternal frustration, the struggle truly availeth naught. If there is no hope in resis tance, there is no tragedy. We need only to recall the outcries aroused by Tess and Jude to realize how far Hardy's social criticism outran his time. In his attack on the current morality of marriage and sex relations he is of the moderns, not of the Victorians. John Stuart Mill and Meredith alone anticipated him in claiming for women a large freedom to live and love. But Mill's great argument against the subjection of women in politics, in work, in mar riage, is based on the same faith in the reason of woman and of man that underlies his plea for Liberty. Hardy's heroines, on the contrary, are, as he says of Tess, the greatest of them, "vessels of emotions rather than reason". They are victims of circumstance, of unscrupulous lovers, of their own fears and passions. Bathshebe Everdene makes "no attempt to control her feeling" by thought of consequences. Eustacia Vye, lament ing that she has been "crushed by things beyond her control", is in reality the prey of her own uncontrolled desires. Through her emotions, the innocent Elfride is lead into deceit, the passionate Viviette to self-imolation, the high-souled Grace to inconstancy. And Sue Briclehead, "ethereal, fine-nerved, sen sitive", breaks down finally in self-torture and desertion of Jude. Here, to sum them up, is Hardy's comment on the sleeping girls in Sue's school: ". . . Every face bearing the legend, 'the Weaker', upon it, as the penalty of the sex wherein they were moulded, which by no possible exertion of their will ing hearts and abilities could be made strong, while the inex orable laws of nature remain what they are." Women, Hardy seems to insist, are doomed by their very natures to an emotional instability, unable to withstand the impact of life. For answer one recalls the heroines of Meredith?</page><page sequence="9">3i8 The Sewanee Review the gentle Lucy, the sensitive Clara, the passionate Diana. They, too, are surely beset by man's unfaithfulness, by society's taboo, by their own traitorous impulses. But in the depths of their own natures they find strength,?strength of mind and heart to sustain them ; they are souls "born active, wind-beaten, but ascending". And we need not forget those humbler, but heroic figures among Hardy's own women: Marty South, Eliza beth Jane, Tess herself, who do not conquer, but who through sheer integrity and devotion endure to the uttermost. No, Hardy does not belong among those ardent spirits of his time whose faith in progress toward a better social order sus tained their battles and their denials. He is closer akin to those prophets of protest?Carlyle, Ruskin, and the rest?whose out cries against human injustice and misery had stirred Victorian England to a great awakening. But Carlyle's stern faith in an eternal justice, Morris's radiant vision of a future brotherhood of man he cannot share. Like Browning, he sees man's life as a long conflict with hardship and evil, but his is not that joy in struggle that exclaims Then welcome each rebuff That turns earth's smoothness rough! or that faith in the outcome that maintains And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence For the fulness of the days? Yet we cannot take the bleak conclusion of Jude the Obscure, the eternal frustration and futility of man's endeavor, as Hardy's last word. He, himself, in a conversation with William Archer, while admitting the pessimism of his general view of life, in sisted that "my practical philosophy is distinctly meliorist". "What are my books," Hardy went on, "but one plea against man's inhumanity to man?to woman?and to the lower ani mals ? . . . Whatsoever may be the inherent good or evil of life, it is certain that men make it much worse than it need be."7 On that same note ends Agnosto Theo, the poem that might well stand as Hardy's apologia: 7 William Archer : Real Conversations.</page><page sequence="10">The Victorianness of Thomas Hardy 319 For, in unwonted purlieus, far and nigh, At whiles or short or long, May be discerned a wrong Dying as of self-slaughter ; whereat I Would raise my voice in song. His own epitaph is in those haunting lines that close the 1920 edition of the Complete Poems\ AFTERWARDS When the present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay, And the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings, Delicate-filmed as new spun silk, will the neighbors say, 'He was a man who used to notice such things'? If I pass during some nocturnal blackness, mothy and warm, When the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn, One may say, 'He strove that such innocent creatures should come to no harm, But he could do little for them ; and now he is gone.' Again we may appeal from Hardy the philosopher to Hardy the artist; from his judgments to his creations. That noble band of patient, devoted, enduring men and women?Clym Yeobright, Oak, Giles Winterborne, Marty South, Elisabeth Jane, Tess?are themselves witnesses that human sufferings are not all in vain. Their tragedies are moralized by their own nobility, and by the high compassion with which their stories are told. There is a third aspect of Hardy's thought, the most signif icant for a study of his relation to his time. For the late nine teenth century was deeply concerned not only with laws of nature and of society but with what Carlyle called "the In finities and Eternities." Nowhere in Hardy's work does the voice of the seventies sound more unmistakably than in his dealings with that "Overworld".8 At first his attitude may seem one of sheer negation. And denial it is, so far as it deals with orthodox Christian theology. 8 The connections between Hardy and Schopenhauer have been fully analysed in Dr. Ernest Brennecke's Thomas Hardy's Universe. This essay aims not to controvert his position but to supplement it by tracing in Hardy's work connections with the great English thought movement of his formative years.</page><page sequence="11">320 The Seivanee Review The nineteenth century rationalist's revolt against the creed of his fathers is the starting-point of Hardy's thought; Agnosto Theo is his premise, as it is that of his contemporaries, Huxley, W. K. Clifford, John Morley, or Leslie Stephen. Here is the conclusion of Leslie Stephen's famous manifesto, An Agnostic s Apology: "that the ancient secret is a secret still; that man knows nothing of the Infinite and Absolute; and that, knowing nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about his ignorance." But Hardy's agnosticism is an assumption rather than a con tention. There is in his work little of that strain of argument that permeates such famous tracts for the time as An Agnostic's Apology or the Essay on Compromise. Of religion, as of nature and man, Hardy speaks, in the main, as an artist, not as con troversialist. It is true that some of his references to or thodoxy, some of his portraits of clergymen, are tinged with irony; but Angel Clare's father is drawn with a gentleness very different from Samuel Butler's relentless exposure of the Rev erend Ernest Pontifex. The characterization of Christianity in Tess of the D' Urbervilles, "a creed which had served mankind well in its time", is echoed by the Spirit of the Pities, comment ing on Napoleon's coronation rites: I did not recognize it here, forsooth : Though in its early, loving kindly days, Of gracious purpose it was much to me.9 Occasionally Hardy gives voice to the same moral indignation against the God of the old theology that animates John Stuart Mill's famous outburst: "I will call no being good, who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet to my fellow-creatures; and if such a being can sentence me to hell for not so calling him, to hell I will go". Herbert Spencer's indictment of "the cruelty of a god who condemns men to tortures which are eternal" rings through Hardy's conclusion on the catastrophe of Tess: "But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature". 9 The Dynasts, Part 1,1,6.</page><page sequence="12">The Victorianness of Thomas Hardy 321 Yet the prevailing mood, especially in the poems, is not so much of anger as of grave regret, the mood of an age Wandering between two worlds, one dead, The other powerless to be born, "the chronic melancholy", as Hardy once put it, "which is taking hold of the civilized races with the decline of belief in a beneficent power". Such poems as The Impercipient ata Cathe dral Servicehave something of the wistful note of Clough: O, doth a bird deprived of wings Go earthward wilfully? Enough. As yet disquiet clings About us. Rest shall we. And Arnold never probed the sickness of his age more search ingly than do these fine lines from The Sick God: Souls have grown seers, and thought outbrings The mournful many-sidedness of things. The Problem poses the rationalist's dilemma, the recurring question of Morley's On Co7npromise and Leslie Stephen's Free thinking and Pla?7t-speak?7ig\ Shall we conceal the case or tell it, We who believe the evidence? God's Funeral sings the nineteenth century's requiem for the "man-projected Deity"; hails the "pale yet positive gleam" of the new day that seems always about to dawn on so many of these seekers; but ends, as do so many of them, "dazed and puzzled 'twixt the gleam and gloom". As Hardy's laments for "blind Nature" read like an answer to Wordsworth, so his requiem for "a sick God" recalls Browning, "the last of the optimists", as Hardy once called him. Once, indeed, his reply is explicit. Angel Clare, watching Tess out of sight, "in the anguish of his heart quoted a line of a poet with a few improvements of his own : ' God's not in His heaven : all's wrong with the world ! ' " Over against Browning's growing certainties, we have the deepening hopelessness of Hardy's later novels, stamping Clym si</page><page sequence="13">322 The Sewanee Review Yeobright's expression with "the view of life as a thing to be put up with", declaring of Tess, "to her and to her like, birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal compulsion", and creating the grotesque, pitiful little figure of Father Time, the child of Jude and Arabella, as the very symbol of despair, "the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live." The failure of the human struggle against the blind, inevitable force of destiny?that is the theme of the later novels of Hardy. Whether such a reading of life is called pessimism or not depends on whether the reader's final impression is that of the uselessness of life so conditioned and fated, or of the gallant resistance of the characters, the deep pity of their creator, and the masterful art that gives us, as Mr. Abercrombie maintains, a sense of "command and power" that belies its own con clusions. If Hardy's work had ended with Jude the Obscure, we might, while agreeing on the mood of his art, differ endlessly as to its ethical and philosophical implications. But in his last and, posterity may add, his greatest creation, The Dynasts, we have not indeed a "systematized philosophy", but an imaginative projection of a modern outlook. We are beginning to appre ciate the art of this tremendous epic drama: the cosmic imag inative sweep of its panoramas, the dramatic power of its epi sodes, the vividness of its characterizations, the range and sweep of its poetry. But all this and more has been finely said elsewhere. It is the "modern outlook" of The Dynasts with which we are here concerned. This modern outlook is expressed in those impersonated abstractions of the Overworld: The Spirit of the Years, inter preter of the cosmic spectacle; The Spirits of the Pities; The Spirits Ironic; and above them all, aloof, unconscious, "The Immanent Will," "the purposive, unnoticed, dominant thing" . . . works unconsciously, as heretofore, Eternal artistries in Circumstance. By this "unmaliced, unimpassioned, nescient Will", the whole action is visibly determined; every event from Trafalgar to</page><page sequence="14">The Victoria7iness of Thomas Hardy 323 Waterloo is visualized as its convulsive workings; the host of actors is shown as its "puppetry". This strange "First Energy", Hardy's projection of the Ding-an-Sich or Will of Schopenhauer, had been foreshowed at the end o? Jude the Obscure in Sue's imaginings, "that the First Cause worked automatically like a somnambulist, and not reflec tively like a sage". The same dim figure haunts some of Hardy's poems. Nature's Questioning is a comparatively early version: ? ^ T , ...^ Has some vast Imbecility Mighty to build and blend, But impotent to tend, Formed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry ? Or come we of an Automaton Unconscious of our pains? Or are we live remains Of Godhead dying downward, brain and eye now gone? Or is it that same high plan betides, As yet not understood Of Evil stormed by Good, We the forloi-n hope over which Achievement strides? Most poignant of these renderings is the prayer of The Bedridden Peasant to an Unknowing God: Then, since thou mak'st not these things be But these things dost not know, I'll praise Thee, as were shown to me The mercies Thou would'st show. We have already spoken of the paradox of Hardy's thought. The Dy7iasts is the very essence of paradox: an unconscious Creator of conscious, helpless puppets. The Pities themselves, voicing the human mind's reaction against the idea of a mind less universe10 cry out But O, the intolerable antilogy Of making figments feel ! Critics have pointed out the dramatist's dilemma: the deter minism expounded by the Spirits and visualized by the "Will 01 An idea of which Mr. W. L. Courtney observes that "no one can believe it for more than a few minutes together?and then only in a severely log eai mood".</page><page sequence="15">324 The Sewanee Review Webs" nullifies the dramatic and ethical values of the action. Napoleon, proclaiming himself a puppet, disclaiming his acts and their consequences, is no tragic hero. His vision before Waterloo of the victims of his wars does not, like Richard Ill's vision before Bosworth Field, fill us with pity and terror. We can only echo his own cry; Why hold me my own master if I be Ruled by the pitiless Planet of Destiny? Again we must recall Hardy's warning that he offers no philos phy warranted to 'lift the burthen of the mystery'. With many another thinker of his age he faced the universe. Some among them found solutions, new gods for old: Spencer's "Unknowable" ; Arnold's "Power, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness;" the Positivist's "Humanity past, present, and to come". Hardy remains among those, agnostic to the end, who find no solution. His Immanent Will is not so much an answer as an embodied question: instead of resolving the paradox, lightening the mystery, he puts paradox and mystery at the heart of things. How can it be, he reiterates, that beauty and goodness and love are doomed to fade and suffer and die? At times he erects the injustice of things into an unjust God on whom to vent his indignation. But, like the dying peasant of his poem, he absolves God of cruelty by making him unaware of his work. The malign "President of the Immortals" of Tess was unendur able ; the nescient Will of The Dynasts is only unintelligible. As Hardy himself says of Gym : "Human beings, in their generous endeavour to construct a hypothesis that shall not degrade a First Cause, have always hesitated to conceive a dominant power of lower moral quality than their own". Here is the secret of the nineteenth century's revolt against the God of its childhood: of James Mill's repudiation of a God who could doom his creatures to eternal torture; of John Stuart Mill's attempt to "save God's goodness at the expense of his power". And just as Hardy, having imaged a cruel Nature, pardons her in pity for her blindness, so he turns from the idea of a malig nant deity to "an Immanent Doer that doth not know",</page><page sequence="16">The Victorianness of Thomas Ha7'dy 325 Which in some age unguessed of us May lift its blinding Incubus And see and own ; It grieves me I did thus and thus! Such a hypothesis is not indeed a solution: it is not an escape from doubt, not a surrender to the longing for certainty. Hardy, affirming that the mystery of things is unanswerable, is one of the voices of an age of refusals. He stands as a thinker who did not flinch from the consequences of his thought, as an artist who did not fear to paint life as dark as he saw it. But, as in the song of The Darkling Thrush there trembles "some blessed hope", so in the darkling world of Hardy there gleams now and again a ray of light. That Being may evolve consciousness, and so at last knowledge and pity?that is his faint, far-off hope. And the root of that hope lies in the very protest against injustice and wrong which makes the art of Thomas Hardy so true a voice of an age of widening pity and deepening understanding. The Pities, those incarnate sym pathies of human nature, refuse to rest in the prospect of a Creator forever blind, a humanity forever groping. Through the darkness rings their chorus of hope: Yet it may wake and understand Ere Earth unshape, know all things, and With knowledge use a painless hand. And it is to them that Hardy gives the last words of his last great work: But?a stirring thrills the air Like to sounds of joyance there . . . Consciousness the Will informing, till it fashion all things fair! Frances Wentworth Knickerbocker. Sewanee, Tennessee.</page></plain_text>
