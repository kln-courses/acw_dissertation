<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Iconography and Ritual of ?iva at Elephanta. By CHARLES DILLARD COLLINS. Albany: STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK PRESS, 1988. Pp. 331, 90 figs. Complete in its documentation, the book treats, to begin with, of the situation of the Elephanta cave temple of giva in space and time. It treats of geography and history as they determine form and content of the temple. The date here assigned to the stupendous excavation is the last quarter of the sixth century. Political history and stylistic considera- tions, single and combined, support this date. The bulk of the book treats of the iconography of the sculptures, each single theme being followed in its literary occurrences from its Vedic antecedents through the epic and puranic texts and also through secular literature. Charged with the evocation of each of the myths in its manifold versions through about fifteen hundred years, their rep- resentation in Elephanta resounds with the richness of its narrative, its past versions as well as its abiding meaning. No similar conspectus has been offered by any previous writer. Charles Dillard Collins evokes in straightforward narrative the integrity and power of the cumulative substance of each myth. He does more than that. He finds the iconographic themes in an order that is sequential. The several reliefs that he has analyzed are arranged by a mode of sequential ordering according to the ritual of worship peculiar to the Pasupata sect. Its mode of worship, different from the generally established mode of worship in clockwise direction, is here observed in counterclockwise procession. This in- version of the generally performed ritual of worship is seen by Collins in the sequence of the scenes, each represented in a gigantic relief panel of its own. The way of seeing the panels in their sequence in counterclockwise direction form- ing a complete narrative of giva's life and being appears plausible if not absolutely convincing. Most outstanding of all the Elephanta sculptures of giva is the triple-headed colossal carving of giva situated at the end of the north-south axis of the temple. Its deeply recessed relief could be shut off by wooden doors from the hall of the temple-of which all the other relief panels form the walls. In this respect the colossal triple-headed giva relief is singled out from the other reliefs. Singled out from the carvings is also the small lifiga, which is the main object of worship in the innermost sanctuary, a small cell the wooden doors of which could be open or closed according to ritual demands. The linga is small; its position alone at the end of the east- west axis gave it architectural and cult significance. Collins draws attention to three-headed giva images from Gandhara of ca. the third century. There the three heads have but one anthropomorphic body. The triple-headed giva image in Elephanta has no body. In Elephanta the three heads rest on a horizontal expanse terminating at the height of the nipples. Collins speaks of this sculpture as a "bust," though no such term is known in corresponding icono- graphic texts. This colossal sculpture has been designated as giva as Mahega, the central head being called Mahadeva. This distinguishes giva as 'the great Lord' from Mahddeva, 'the great God'. Dr. Collins points out the Gandharan origin of an-albeit "naturalistic"-triple-headed giva image, the prototype of the three heads of Elephanta. It was the vision of a master- mind, be he priest or artist, that created the colossal triple- headed image. This vision, in contemporary and subsequent examples, degenerated into an array of three faces juxta- posed. Collins does not refer to the four-faced giva lingas created at the same time in different centers of art.</page><page sequence="2">552 Journal of the American Oriental Society 110.3 (1990) "The Iconography and Ritual of giva at Elephanta" is an invaluable guide to the temple and its sculptures. Innovative and written in simple language, it is the as yet most complete and insightful book we have on the subject. The illustrations are well chosen, the photographs are good, but could have been better printed. STELLA KRAMRISCH PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART</page></plain_text>
