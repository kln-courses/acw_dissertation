It's a black-and-white print from the early 1940S, and a black house servant named Jasper Staples is holding the young Eggleston, then about two years old, in his arms. The baby has a little camera, and he is taking a picture of his grandfather at the same time as his grandfather is taking a picture of him. By the early '6os, Eggleston had taken up photography seriously. Although he would ultimately be celebrated for his work in color, his first photographs were in black and white, and from time to time, especially in the '7os and '8os, he has returned to that format, particularly for serial projects. Eggleston's night portraits, ca. 1973, were taken with an unusual 5x7 camera set up to use infrared film. With it, Eggleston could shoot in virtual darkness in the juke joints and clubs around Memphis. Almost all of these pictures are of people who were unaware that he was photographing them. Eggleston's camera, which he would rest on a table, looked like just a plain rectangular box. The portraits are offhand and spontaneous but insistently stark; their brutality is heightened by the absence of color. For his Memphis bungalows, ca. 1969, Eggleston sought out houses that resembled one another as much as possible, then shot them head-on with a 35 mm Leica. He made over one hundred of these pictures and used to carry them around bundled up like stacks of money in a large black photographer's equipment case. I remember his bringing them to the home of a mutual friend, the artist William Christenberry, in Washington, D.C., where he kept me up most of the night inspecting them. As soon as I thought I'd exhausted all there was to see in one image, he'd point out something new. The night portraits and the bungalows share a commitment to portraiture. The bungalows, with their curiously anthropomorphic quality, look like passport shots of one person after another. The portraits also have a leveling effect whether biker or debutante, the people Eggleston photographed are clearly denizens of the same realm. But if the similarity between the subjects in each series is immediately apparent, it's the distinguishing details that linger, as if Eggleston is reminding us: look closely, each of these individuals is subtly different.
