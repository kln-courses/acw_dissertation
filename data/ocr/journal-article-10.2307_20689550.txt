Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium The essential function of art is moral. Not aesthetic, not decorative, not pastime and recreation. But moral. The essential func tion of art is moral. D. H. Lawrence A. B. YEHOSHUA'S RECENT NOVEL, A Journey to the End of the Millennium, is a work that invites interpretation. In many ways it marks a return to its author's early allegorical mode, but in a manner that is complicated and enriched by facets of Yehoshua's more realistic and psychologically oriented later works. The underlying allegorical attri butes are infused with the author's compassion for his characters, his interest in their internal development, and his passion for moral explora tion. The capacity to penetrate the psyches of the characters and to have them undergo development and change is made part of a complex structure of symbolic signification. One marker of the novel's allegorical orientation is the fact that, although the story is set one thousand years in the past, A journey to the End of the Millennium is not given the temporal span, narrative scope, and local detail of a typical historical novel. This is a very narrowly focused work. It concentrates on the actions and interac tions of a small group of Jewish characters moving through a medieval landscape that is only lightly sketched in and remains largely abstract. PROOFTEXTS19 (1999): 235-256 ? 1999 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">236 GILEAD MORAHG The evocation of local scenes and period customs is governed by a tight economy of thematic needs and rendered in spare, almost minimalistic, strokes. The invitation to interpretation is extended further by the quality of the narrator's voice and the nature of the narrative strategies he employs. The narrator of A Journey to the End of the Millennium does not seek to be transparent. He is a palpable presence who relishes telling the tale, commenting on it, and inviting his audience to join him in speculating about its implications. Yehoshua has claimed that the voice of this narrator is essentially that of a "chronicler who was not of the same period, but not a modern narrator either/'1 This is a misleading character ization. The narrator clearly infuses his story with a sense of the past by casting it in a literary register that is associated with earlier modes of Hebrew writing: a lush, somewhat archaic, vocabulary and a poetic, often idiosyncratic, turn of phrase. But this richly textured and elegantly crafted prose is sprinkled with a tincture of modern allusions and Hebrew neologisms that indicate that the story is a recent construct with distinct contemporary significations.2 Far from being a mere chronicler, the narrator of A Journey to the End of the Millennium is a deliberate, and very sophisticated, storyteller who readily sacrifices chronological sequence to narrative need and factual veracity to imaginative possibility. He withholds information for narra tive effect, as no chronicler should. He records his characters' deepest emotions and innermost thoughts, as no chronicler could. This is a narrator who sets the scenes, motivates the characters, and charts the plot in order to advance an ambitious thematic agenda.3 The action of A Journey to the End of the Millennium is initiated by the decision of Ben Attar, a wealthy merchant from Tangier, to save his business partnership with his beloved nephew, Abulafia, a young wid ower whose wife had committed suicide and left him with a retarded daughter. While serving as Ben Attar's agent in Europe, Abulafia had fallen in love with an Ashkenazi woman, Esther-Minna, and married her. A childless widow, Esther-Minna is an educated and strongly independ ent woman from a scholarly family in Worms. When she discovers that her new husband's uncle and chief partner has two wives, Esther-Minna is outraged. She proclaims her profound aversion to this uncle and demands that Abulafia dissolve his partnership with him. Abulafia acquiesces, and Ben Attar, who loves his nephew dearly and values his qualities as a merchant, is so affronted that he sets out with his two wives, his Muslim partner, and a shipload of merchandise to confront the couple in their new home, in Paris. He intends to restore the partnership by challenging Esther-Minna to a public trial in which he would defend the</page><page sequence="3">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 237 practice of having multiple wives and prove the error of Esther-Minna's aversion to it. To this end, he brings along an Andalusian rabbi, Elbaz, who is to represent him at the trial. A story about a wealthy Jewish merchant from North Africa who travels with his entourage to the heart of medieval Europe in order to challenge the Jewish community there on matters of high principle inevitably creates anticipation of a narrative attempt to engage some of the complex divisions between Ashkenazim and Sephardim in Israel today, especially since this is an issue that Yehoshua has long been expected to address more directly in his fiction.4 But there is little in this novel that pertains directly to these contemporary ethnic tensions. Nissim Calderon is correct in observing that "whoever reads A Journey to the End of the Millennium looking for the ethnic rift between the Israelis of today will not find much in it."5 Yehoshua deliberately avoids the customary distinction between Eastern and Western Jews. He consistently defines the demarcations of his characters' origins in terms of north and south and uses the novel's medieval setting to distance the interactions between these two communities from the conventional constructs of contemporary political discourse. The medieval Jews of the south have no sense of social deprivation or ethnic discrimination. On the contrary, they are confident in the superiority of their material and social culture over that of the northern Jews. And it is with no small measure of distaste that they set sail from their civilized city of Tangier to "that small and distant town of Paris,"6 which they regard as "a remote and barbarous place" (54, 45). Ben Attar's purpose is to dispel the northern aversion to the southern practice of polygamy in order to restore his partnership with Abulafia. The terms "aversion" and "partnership," which are reiterated repeatedly, almost obsessively, by the narrator function in counterpoint to each other and serve not only to bolster the structure of the narrative, but also as key elements of its thematic design. And, as his journey proceeds, Ben Attar gradually comes to understand that the partnership he must seek to renew and preserve, even at the expense of his pride, his passion, and the depth of his convictions, is not the partnership with his southern nephew, to whom he had been so close, but rather the partnership with Esther Minna and the distant, and very different, world of the northern Jews that she represents. Gradually, and with increasing force, it becomes evident to him that the partnership that is truly worthy of effort, compromise, and sacrifice is not his personal business partnership but rather a far more important national partnership: the partnership between communities that may be separated by distance, by custom, and by culture, but are bound to each other by force of their common Jewishness. Even before the first Jewish court is convened at the Villa Le Juif near Paris, Ben Attar observes that his Muslim partner, Abu Lutfi,</page><page sequence="4">238 GILEAD MORAHG could never, never ... understand why a Jewish merchant who, with his two wives, enjoys the respect of both Jews and Muslims, should care about the aversion of distant Jews who dwell in dark forests and on the banks of wild rivers in the interior of a remote continent. (131,124) At this stage, it is not clear whether Ben Attar himself understands the full depth of his distress over this aversion. But intimations of national concern are already being offered by the narrator. When Ben Attar and Elbaz win in the first trial, the narrator reports on the reasons that each of the judges had for deciding in favor of the North African claimants. He concludes with the opinion of the oldest judge, stressing that "it was she who, with her inner sense, was convinced that the renewal of the partnership between north and south was the hidden desire of the entire Community" (148,140). The force of this hidden national imperative gradually becomes apparent to the southern Jews and alters their conception of the partner ship they are seeking to preserve. The first to express this is Ben Attar's spokesman, Rabbi Elbaz, during the preparations for the second trial, which is held in Worms in the hope of reversing Esther-Minna's refusal to accept the indignity of a verdict that affirms a man's right to have multiple wives. Before the trial, Elbaz links the threat to the integrity of the family partnership with the danger to the unity of the Jewish people. He insists that "judgment should be passed by a single magistrate, who will have on his conscience the blame for a final schism between uncle and nephew and between north and south" (199, 192). At the trial, he sums up his case with the hope that he has succeeded in persuading the Rhenish judge to pass "an enlightened and tolerant verdict that will allow the natural partnership to continue in honor of ancient solidarity and for the sake of future redemption" (207, 201). But the argument for cultural tolerance for the sake of national unity does not prevail. Ben Attar loses his case, and a verdict of ostracism is proclaimed. And when, soon after, his second wife dies, the North African merchant is compelled to confront the broader implications of the position held by Esther-Minna and the Jews of Worms. He understands that he must now choose between maintaining a partnership with them or clinging to a cultural custom that he cherishes and they abhor. Grudgingly, and with, great sorrow, Ben Attar makes his choice. He decides to carry the body of his beloved second wife to Paris in order to prove unequivocally to the stubborn averter and to her brother, Mr. Levinas,7 that the man standing before them is from now on a worthy partner, husband to only one wife, and it is therefore possible to renew, albeit in pain and in anger, the interrupted partnership and to make it endure forever by the testament of a grave and a tomb in their courtyard. (263, 256)</page><page sequence="5">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 239 In making this choice, Ben Attar affirms his realization that the partner ship he must maintain, even at great cost to himself, is not with his southern ally, Abulafia, but rather with his northern adversary, Esther Minna. From then on, he remains steadfast in his determination to restore and reinforce the partnership between the Jews of the north and the Jews of the south. The conceptual axis that orients the novel's narrative development extends from a belief in the necessity of a strong sense of Jewish unity, through a recognition of forces that jeopardize this unity, to an explora tion of ways in which these forces may be resisted. This, of course, is an extension of concerns that inform important aspects of such earlier works by Yehoshua as A Late Divorce (1982), Molcho (1987), and Mr. Mani (1990). However, A Journey to the End of the Millennium constitutes an important turning point in this ongoing line of inquiry by moving the exploration beyond its earlier preoccupation with issues of constructing identity and creating unity among the Jews of Israel and expanding its concern to the Jewish people as a whole.8 While in Mr. Mani all paths lead to Jerusalem, there is no connection to the Land of Israel and not a trace of longing for it throughout the entire Journey to the End of the Millennium. Here, questions of national unity are engaged from an entirely new perspective that reflects a willingness to consider the possibility that the quest for the sources of such unity cannot be constrained by the values of the Zionist movement or the history of the Jewish state. This is the impetus that carries the narrative back in time, to a mythic encounter between representatives of the disparate Jewish communities of North Africa and central Europe, whose great differences of manner and conviction put the notion of unity and identity among the dispersed communities of Jews in the world to a critical test. And it is this concern that connects the allegorical world of the Jews at the end of the first millennium to the world of realities with which the Jews are still struggling at the end of the second millennium.9 In its quest for sources of national cohesion that precede, and exceed, the ideology of territorial unity, A Journey to the End of the Millennium identifies language as a primary binding force. It recognizes the capacity of a common language to generate imagined communities and build distinctive solidarities.10 It also recognizes that loss of a common lan guage is a precursor to national fragmentation and cultural assimilation. Time and again, the novel points to Hebrew as a continuing key to preserving affinity between dispersed Jewish communities. It also shows that this is a key that can be easily lost.11 Even stronger than the linguistic connection is the bond of religious ritual. Much of the story takes place during the Jewish High Holidays and is imbued with a shared sense of festivity and solemnity that brings the members of the two communities</page><page sequence="6">240 GILEAD MORAHG together, especially in moments of worship and prayer. Again and again, the Jews of the south and the Jews of the north find themselves tran scending differences of custom and style, adapting each to the others' manner of prayer, and joining in common worship.12 Underlying the bonding properties of language and ritual is a sense of primal kinship with which Jews from disparate cultures respond to one another. This spontaneous affinity is evident even when Ben Attar and his company bring their challenge to the Jewish community of Worms: The local residents absorb the visitors into the fabric of their lives quickly and with love. Since on the eve of the High Holidays, there is no one who would not like to bring these wise and wondrous guests into his house... in order to unite wandering Jews with permanent Jews in one synagogue for the holiday. (188,181) This ancient sense of kinship is also at the heart of Elbaz's arguments for preserving the partnership between north and south on the basis of tolerance and mutual respect for cultural difference. At the conclusion of the first trial, Elbaz addresses Esther-Minna and Mr. Levinas in elegant Hebrew: Just as we take care not to judge you according to our strength, so you, too, are not permitted to judge us according to your weakness. Therefore, allowing each to remain loyal to himself and true to his nature, restore the ancient partnership and do not destroy it. (143,136-37; this and all subsequent emphases are in the text) He concludes his arguments in a similar vein at the second trial, when he asks for a recognition that "there are different Jews, worthy and good, who take two wives, and whose righteousness and faith do not depend on the views of others," and expresses the hope that the Ashkenazi judge "will allow the natural partnership to continue in honor of ancient solidarity and for the sake of future redemption" (p. 206-7, 20O-201). What is significant, of course, is that Elbaz's call for national solidarity based on mutual tolerance is not heeded. A ban against Ben Attar is proclaimed, and the partnership is dissolved. This development indicates that while the distinguishing elements of tradition, ritual, a common language, and a deep sense of kinship are important constituents of national partnership, they may not be sufficient to sustain it. A key question that emerges from this narrative is whether there is a stronger, more elemental, foundation on which such a partnership can be made to endure. In seeking to answer this question, it is important to remember that the contest of forces that act to undo the national partnership and those that work to secure it is played out in the metaphorical context of another partnership, which is much more central to the action of the</page><page sequence="7">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 241 novel. This, of course, is the partnership between a man and a woman, in a marriage and within a family. Anne Golomb Hoffman's observation that Yehoshua's fiction invites the reader to think about modern Jewish history in light of the relation ship within families13 may be readily extended to the premodern setting of A Journey to the End of the Millennium. Here, as elsewhere, Yehoshua's practice of constructing symbolic analogies between family situations and national issues extends beyond his interest in exposing and exploring the power of instinctual drives and the workings of unconscious motivation in determining the dynamics of social history.14 It also reflects a desire to identify and examine central moral issues that equally affect the private and the public spheres of life. "Family relations," writes Yehoshua in an essay published shortly after the appearance of A Journey to the End of the Millennium, "and especially relations within a marriage, are, in my view, one of the areas of life that are richest in moral dilemmas and choices. Here ... a person's morality is tested. Especially because connections of love and mutual dependence are so characteristic of family relations, the moral equations become subtle, complex, and often painful."15 In A Journey to the End of the Millennium, the confrontation between the Jewish communities of the north and the south is caused by a moral divide involving the customs of marriage. The narrative is driven by the opposition between the stern commitment to monogamous marriage that had been recently adopted by the Jews of the north16 and the practice of polygamy, which was still cherished by the Jews of the south. The anachronistic nature and contem porary irrelevance of this dispute suggest its emblematic function as a metaphor for other, more immediate, moral and social concerns. The initiator of the confrontation is Ben Attar, who sets off to the unfamiliar regions of Europe in the belief that he will be able to persuade his northern adversaries to accept the difference in marital customs by demonstrating the virtue and the beauty of what he calls "the triple bond of love" (99, 91). The novel allows Ben Attar ample scope for making his case. His spokesman, Rabbi Elbaz, is both elegant and forceful in his presentation of the benefits of polygamous marriages and in his argument that, while this practice need not be embraced by the Jews of the north, it should be recognized as a legitimate mode of family life that is central to the culture of the south and should therefore be tolerated as a valid strand in the cultural fabric that binds the Jewish people together. Much of A Journey to the End of the Millennium involves an exploration of the moral validity of this notion that tolerance of cultural difference is a first principle of national unity. Elbaz's moral point of departure is his claim that Ben Attar's relation ship with his two wives is wholly benign and that in it "there is no</page><page sequence="8">242 GILEAD MORAHG suffering and no sorrow" (117, 116). At the first trial, he introduces Ben Attar as "a loving man, a sage and philosopher of love, who came from afar to proclaim in public that there can be two wives, equally loved" (140, 134). He then proceeds to make the case for such love. A man will always have fantasies of another woman, he says. No legislation can prevent this, and no living wife can compete with the qualities of the imagined one. Consequently, she will always be subject to her husband's disappoint ment and resentment. But when the second woman is not a fantasy but a reality of flesh and blood, the first can measure herself against her, reconcile herself to her existence, and eventually even come to love her. Because, he concludes, "only a second wife can alleviate the torment of the man's unending desire and transform it from an act of admonition to an act of love" (141,135). Following this defense of polygamy as an antidote to the harms of male fantasies of desire, Elbaz argues that having multiple wives not only enables masculine love but is also essential for maintaining masculine identity. Using his own experience of having only one wife as an example, Elbaz tells that, in his constant anxiety about fulfilling his sexual obli gations and satisfying his wife's passions,17 he clung so closely to her that there was a real danger that he would become a female himself. But, he continues, "when a woman does not stand alone before her husband and he is required to alternate regularly between two, he has no choice but to renew his original essence, his masculine nature" (142,136). Ben Attar embodies Elbaz's notions of masculinity. He is a powerful, commanding man who alternates faithfully between his two wives, steadfast in his determination to fulfill his sexual obligations equitably, even when the exertions this requires become burdensome. He echoes Elbaz's belief in the benevolence of such love and is completely confident in its power to soothe any anger or pain that may come from jealousy or loneliness (31, 20). His, he believes, is "a great love that continues to give much pleasure to both his wives" (201,194). Ben Attar is also convinced that the vibrant femininity and serene presence of his two wives will present "the very picture of happiness and love that that new and arbitrary rule that came from a little town in Ashkenaz was seeking to destroy" (88, 80). This, he believes, is the most effective way to "prove to Abulafia's new and opinionated wife how far she is from understanding the true nature of the love that abounds on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea" (30,19). Foregrounding the perspective of a particular character in a narrative almost inevitably creates reader empathy with this character. The power of perspective is such that we reflexively want the protagonist to succeed. The dominance of Ben Attar's perspective in A Journey to the End of the Millennium has the effect of drawing readers into his world and works to</page><page sequence="9">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 243 align their loyalties and sympathies with his own. This may be part of the reason so many of the novel's early reviewers saw the ultimate repudia tion of Ben Attar's claims as a reprehensible imposition of the rigid legalistic codes favored by the cold, repressed, and cerebral Ashkenazic Jews of the north upon the warm, sensuous, and spontaneous Sephardic Jews of the south.18 But Ben Attar's perspective does not define the vision of this novel, which, in actuality, moves persistently against the grain of such simplistic stereotypes, exposing with growing clarity the contours of a common humanity that underlies the contending differences. The narrative is also more subtle and complex in engaging the question as to whether the verdict passed against Ben Attar in Worms should be regarded as a legalistic travesty of cultural intolerance or as a moral act of humane judgment. Ben Attar's view is vigorously contested by Esther-Minna. She is the champion of the ban against him and the embodiment of the spirit in which it is imposed. Polygamy, which, for Ben Attar, is an affirmation of masculinity, is, for Esther-Minna, an affront to human dignity. Contrary to the portrait of harmonious bliss presented by the men of the south, she regards the practice of having more than one wife as barbaric (80, 72), demeaning (152,145), and as a source of great pain to the women who are subjected to it (153,146). When the opportunity is given, she rejects her brother's wish to counter the North Africans' arguments on strictly legal grounds and chooses to defend her position by revealing "the true emotional source of her aversion, which, in her eyes, is even more important than the rules that came down from the Rhine district of her birth" (134,127). Instead of resorting to abstract legalisms, Esther-Minna makes her case by telling the story of her efforts to discover the secret of the vitality of Abulafia's previous love, as well as the secret of its weakness and failure. These secrets involve the mystery of why Abulafia's first wife, who was so clearly beloved by her husband, had given up this love and killed herself. Esther-Minna claims that she ultimately found the key to these secrets in the marriage customs of Abulafia's community. As she learned about these customs, she "began to make the connection between the dead woman's terrible act of despair and the threat of adding a second woman to the marriage." She realized that "when a second wife is introduced into the household ... she carries within her a force of terrible destruction" because of the anguish and degradation that such an arrangement creates. Esther-Minna concludes her argument by proclaim ing that her aversion is necessary not only to protect the love she shares with Abulafia, "but also, yes, yes, to avenge, if only in small measure, the sorrow, the humiliation, and the fear of the drowned woman" (136-37, 130).</page><page sequence="10">244 GILEAD MORAHG Esther-Minna's reconstruction of Abulafia's wife's state of mind at the time of her suicide is questionable.19 But her interpretation is impor tant because it is a reflection of her deepest convictions. It embodies a vision that contradicts the claims for the benign nature of polygamy and constitutes an ideological alternative to the argument that such practice must be tolerated for the sake of national unity. Esther-Minna's perspec tive provides a standard against which the actual relationship between Ben Attar and his wives can be measured and the norms that govern this relationship can be tested. Since Ben Attar rarely converses with his wives, the true nature of his relationship with them is reflected most clearly in the episodes of sexual intimacy that frame the narrative and contribute greatly to its significa tion. The novel's opening movement introduces Ben Attar as he is awakened in the bed of his first wife and prepares to make his way to the bed of the second. Mistaking the caress of the black slave who is waking him for the touch of his sleeping wife, Ben Attar thinks smugly that "even in her sleep, the first wife does not forget to thank him for the pleasure that he brought her." He knows that his leaving the cabin will disturb her sleep, but "he is convinced that she will restrain herself and not attempt to detain him, not only because she knows the obligation that he must now fulfill, but also because she may share the hope that he will manage to fulfill it before daybreak" (13,3). These first thoughts reflect the essence of Ben Attar's relations with his wives and suggest that they are driven more by pride of ownership and the obligations of husbandry than by true emotional engagement or a genuine concern with how these women actually feel. He placidly presumes that their inner worlds are completely attuned with his own and that his primary responsibility is the equitable satisfaction of their physical needs. Here, as elsewhere, Ben Attar reflex ively appropriates his wives' imagined voices in order to support his convictions and justify his actions to himself and to others. The ironies that are apparent at the outset persist throughout the novel, consistently undeimining Ben Attar's self-proclaimed qualities as an attentive and generous lover. He is, in fact, a man who regards his wives as his property and is eager to exhibit them to the Jews of Paris and of Worms in order "to prove his quiet capacity to realize, fully and with total equality, his rights and responsibilities of ownership" (201,194). He is also a man who, upon encountering Esther-Minna's palpable revulsion at the sight of him moving from the chamber of one wife to that of the other, does not hesitate to force himself upon his unwilling second wife in order to prove to his adversary "with deeds and not with words, that she is wrong in her thinking, and that love is possible at any time and in any place where there is a lover" (110,102). But there is no love in the ensuing sexual encounter, only a calculated assertion of power.</page><page sequence="11">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 245 At its core, A Journey to the End of the Millennium is a novel about moral judgment: the judgment that Ben Attar invites and receives, the judgment that he must exercise after the death of his second wife, and the judgment that the narrative seeks to convey. A key tenet of Ben Attar's credo is that the kind of marriage he has come to defend causes no pain and brings only benefit to his wives. In his view, his marriage constitutes "a great love that always gave and continues to give much pleasure to both of them" (201,194). Although Ben Attar's wives are given little voice, there are moments in which they signal a distinctly different perspective. Intimations of this discrepancy are evident from the outset. The second wife is first introduced at the end of a long night in which she has been waiting for Ben Attar to leave the bed of the first wife and come to hers. When he finally arrives, the first thing he sees are her amber eyes, "fin-shaped and bloodshot from a long sleepless night, like the eyes of a predatory animal that has just been trapped" (29,18). When, somewhat later, she realizes that her husband's primary concern is with the fate of his business venture, which has been jeopardized by his marriage to her, "a venomous spark ignites her fine amber eyes . . . and they open wide with the force of her affront" (33, 22). There is also a moment, late in the journey, when even the older wife, who has always been first on Ben Attar's carefully calibrated schedule of attentions, is seen "weeping silently in the bowels of the ship, yearning for love" (287, 280). While the wives' mortification is communicated through subtle indi rection, Esther-Minna's thoughts and emotions are given full voice. She is a strong, articulate, and independent person,20 whom Rabbi Elbaz regards as "a new woman" with "surprising ideas" (135, 128). Yet although Esther-Minna's character constitutes an antithesis to the submis sive pliancy of Ben Attar's wives, she is not unlike them in the anger and the anguish that she feels at the prospect of having to share her husband with another wife. The fear that, as a result of his ongoing partnership with his uncle, Abulafia will revert to the marriage customs of the south underlies Esther-Minna's determination to sever the connection with Ben Attar. She has an acute sense of the emotional deprivations and painful indignities caused to women in polygamous marriages and is detennined not to subject herself to them. When the court in the first trial finds in favor of Ben Attar, Esther Minna is devastated. Realizing that she cannot tolerate a sanction that so fundamentally violates her deepest sense of self, she begins to cast about for "a fresh thought that will repel the new threat to her dignity" (152, 145). The solution she arrives at involves parting ways with the two men who had become the mainstays of her life and charting a bold course of her own. Defying her brother, who was prepared to accept the verdict,</page><page sequence="12">246 GILEAD MORAHG Esther-Minna disavows the partnership by proclaiming herself "a rebel lious wife who no longer wants her husband" (158,150). By placing the value of her individual dignity above the cause of familial and communal affinity, Esther-Minna draws the moral line that separates her position from that of Ben Attar and connects the novel's concern with the sources of national unity to fundamental questions of morality. Ben Attar and his spokesman, Rabbi Elbaz, represent a position that maintains that unity within diversity can be attained only through tolerance and mutual acceptance of disparate, often contradictory, cul tural traditions. Esther-Minna arrives at a position that rejects inclusion as the supreme standard of unity and insists on a recognition of common humanity as the moral basis of a national community. Her adamant refusal to be part of any form of union that allows a man to have more than one wife embodies a broader concern that bridges the millennial span between the time in which the story is set and the time in which it was written and is being read. In clear opposition to Elbaz's ethos of total inclusion, Esther-Minna advocates placing a clear limit on tolerance and excluding any cultural practice in which the desire of some members of the community dominates and diminishes the humanity and the dignity of others. The judgment that is passed in Worms and the ban that is pro nounced against Ben Attar coincide fully with Esther-Minna's position. A key critical question is whether this is also the position that the novel as a whole works to uphold. In considering this question, it is important to note that the judgment in the second trial is not made on the basis of Esther-Minna's public arguments but rather on the basis of the private testimony of Ben Attar's second wife. Joseph son of Kalonymos, the Rhenish scholar who is selected by Rabbi Elbaz to adjudicate the case, is a gentle and conscientious man who quickly comes to recognize the moral depth and human weight of the responsibility entrusted to him. Deter mined to be as fair-minded as possible in carrying out this responsibility, he is reluctant to pass sentence merely according to the letter of the law and seeks to verify the moral validity of its spirit. Sensing that great pain and severe damage are inflicted upon women who are given into polygamous marriages, Joseph son of Kalonymos wishes to uncover the "secret shame and hidden humiliation" of such marriages (214, 208). However, as the trial proceeds he finds himself powerfully swayed by the arguments of Rabbi Elbaz and Ben Attar. But then, in a profoundly judicious move, which should serve as a critical signpost in any reading of this novel, he alters his received perspective by inviting heretofore silenced voices to inform it. Rather than assessing the passionate appeals of the southern men according the cold code of northern law, Joseph son of Kalonymos decides to judge their claims for</page><page sequence="13">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 247 the benefits of condoning polygamous marriages against the views of those who are most directly affected by them. Once the arguments of both sides are concluded, he orders that Ben Attar's wives be brought before him for private questioning. He hopes that his interrogation of the wives will yield "at least a bit of incriminating personal testimony that will aid his conscience in making a judgment in the spirit of the sages of Ashkenaz" (215, 210). The first wife disappoints him by being consistently "reserved in her speech and careful of every word, lest she incriminate or taint the duality that was so dear to her husband (215, 210; italics added). The second wife surprises him by confessing a fantasy she had been cultivating through out the journey. She reveals that she is not jealous of the other wife, as he had expected, but of Ben Attar, who is allowed several wives while she can have only one husband. Her voice resonating with long-accumulated bitterness and anger, the second wife proclaims boldly that "she is not only willing to be duplicated, she wishes to be a duplicator as well." Stunned by the implications of such a fantasy, the judge is moved to ask: "A second husband? Like who, for instance?" And the young woman astonishes him even more by uttering one of the few lines that are actually given to her: "Like yourself, sir. Like yourself, for instance ..." (216, 211). Although the second wife will later try to explain that she had been misunderstood and that "while the man seeks duplication of the body, the woman seeks duplication of the soul" (223, 216), it is this alarming exchange that brings Joseph son of Kalonymos the insight he has been seeking. It was, we are told, "as if only now he managed to understand, completely on his own, the deep source and the true reason for the new prohibition that an entire community was trying to convey to him through the curtain: There is no duality without multiplicity, and multiplicity has no boundary" (216, 211). Having recognized the allure and the danger of unbridled desire, the judge can affirm the prohibition that is designed to avert the damage that may be inflicted by acting on such desire. He now has the confidence to pass a decisive verdict. He proclaims "not only an aversion from the partner who came up from the south, but also excommunication and banishment" (217, 212). And it is in order to "cancel . . . not only the excommunication and banishment of Worms, but also Paris's right of aversion" that Ben Attar sets aside his anger, his pain, and his pride and resolves never again to take a second wife (262, 255). A key critical question at this juncture is whether Ben Attar's conces sion signifies an affirmation of a superior moral code or a critique of the self-righteous imposition of one cultural code upon another. On this matter, Ben Attar remains ambivalent to the end. The view that emerges from the narrative as a whole is much less equivocal. It repeatedly shows</page><page sequence="14">248 GILEAD MORAHG desire as being inherently self-centered and the fantasies it engenders as leading to actions that have little regard for others. This is most evident in Ben Attar's relations with his wives, especially in the recurring instances of sexual intercourse, which constitute a metaphoric distillation of these relations and form a central pattern in the novel's signifying design. As Ben Attar begins to make love to his remaining wife, for the first time since the death of the younger wife, she senses that the urgency of his desire stems not only from his love for her, but also from a fantasy of recapturing the presence of the dead wife in the body of the living one. Her realization that his sudden passion contains "a strange wish to combine a dead wife with a living wife in a single coupling... wracks her soul with sorrow and with pain" (289-90, 281-82). She tries to resist, signaling to him that if his arousal is only a need of the body and not of the heart, it might be better to wait a few days. And when Ben Attar persists in forcing himself upon her, "she feels, for the first time since she became a woman, an aversion to her husband, as if the difficult journey she had made, back and forth between the two great rivers of Europe, transformed her, too, into a new woman" (290, 282). The lexical linking of the first wife's awakening consciousness to Esther-Minna's characterization as a "new woman" and to her aversion to a form of marriage that denies a woman's singularity and degrades her humanity suggests that the differences between Ben Attar and Esther Minna are not merely manifestations of benign cultural difference, but rather the embodiment of a profound moral divide. This notion is structurally reinforced by the narrator's recurrent practice of contiguous signification in which the correspondences and incongruities between adjacent episodes from different strands of the story serve to illuminate concerns that unite the narrative as a whole. As the novel approaches closure, the narrator accelerates the contiguous alternation between the various narrative strands, accentuating their refractive qualities as he draws them more tightly together toward the story's final point. Thus, he intercuts the scene of Ben Attar, who is forcing himself on his first wife, "and, by force of his fantasy of desire, is also evoking the face and the body of the second wife" (294,286), with the story of the black slave who is pursuing his own fantasy of desire. The narrator points to the connection between these seemingly unre lated incidents by interrupting his depiction of Ben Attar's struggle to satisfy his desire for duality and inviting the reader to join him in wondering "whether it was by force of that same desire that is now flooding the bowels of the ship, that the young pagan is trying to make his way ... back to the cottage of graven images?" (291, 282). Earlier that day, the black youth had been aroused by three women who share a household with a sculptor who had used him as a model. The desire that</page><page sequence="15">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 249 is now driving the innocent youth back to their cottage, and what takes place when he gets there, provide a defining moral perspective on Ben Attar's persistent desire for duality. Like Ben Attar, the young pagan is driven by self-absorbed desire. He is drawn back to the cottage "not only because he was possessed by a strange desire to bow down, for once, not before images of others but before the image of himself, but also because he could not forget the laughter of the three women who so freely fondled his genitals, which since then have remained full and erect in their honor" (291, 283). Entering the cottage once again, he removes his loincloth and presents his "aching, elongating, circumcised maleness" in an unabashed declaration of male desire (292,284). The narrative soon shifts back to the feverish sexual struggle in the bowels of the ship and to Ben Attar, who, "resolute in his yearning to merge two desires in one coupling," undoes his robe "in order to lend exultant nakedness to a copulation that is without limits and full of possibilities" (295,286). It then shifts back again to the sculptor's cottage, where such a copulation actually takes place. This is the novel's great cautionary scene. For, as the narrator takes care to point out, "the spirit of the imagination not only can expand but also go wild, as it does now among the women who arouse one another in the sculptor's cottage at the sight of the young guest who was drawn through the night to bow down naked before his own image" (296, 288). Ben Attar's self-centered desire is echoed in the profligate carnality of the three women and shown to be both debasing and debased. We are told that the beauty and innocence of the young man's avid sexuality "pene trates the fantasy of desire not of one woman but of three, creating a dark opening to a new horizon, which is very thrilling but also endlessly depraved" (297, 288). As the women prepare to share the young man among them, the narrator steadily passes judgment on their acts. Describ ing their intent as "a lascivious plot" (296, 288), "a debauchery" that is "grievously licentious" (297,289), he proceeds to depict the consequences of being subjected to acts of unbridled self-gratification: The three women approach the youth, the sight of whose black flesh releases within them the abandon to pass him from hand to hand, from mouth to mouth, from vagina to vagina, as if this were not a human but an animal. And the more the triple desire that was rampaging through the night increases its frenzy, the more the throes of pleasure that wrack the crumbling innocence of this son of the desert become infused with sorrow and with pain. And through the moans of pleasure that erupt now from his mouth ... he already knows and feels that from now on, to the end of his days, he will have no rest from the fury of his longings, which will always compel him and his descendants to journey from the south to the north. (297, 289) This intricately constructed parable confirms Joseph son of Kalony mos's conclusion that "there is no duality without multiplicity, and</page><page sequence="16">250 GILEAD MORAHG multiplicity has no boundary." By universalizing the destructive force of indiscriminate desire, it also affirms that Esther-Minna's aversion to southern conventions of marriage is not to be regarded as a biased rejection of a foreign custom, but rather as an effort to confront a profound moral challenge. Positing compassionate humanity and mutual dignity as the first principles of love, Esther-Minna offers a humane alternative to the oppressive code of marital relations that Ben Attar is striving to uphold. The fact that Esther-Minna's aversion constitutes an affront to Ben Attar's sense of masculinity is one of the main reasons he is so anxious to contest it. When he is defeated in this contest, loses his second wife, forgoes the prospect of ever taking another, and feels his control over his ship and his business interests slipping away, Ben Attar clings to the fantasy that sustains his sense of masculinity and tries to enact it on the body of his remaining wife. As he approaches her, "resolute in his yearning to merge two desires in one coupling, [and] overcome with longing for the duality that was taking shape within him," we are told that the small cabin "swirled with a new and different thought about sin and punishment" (294-95, 286). This disembodied thought hovers over the unfolding scene, suggesting a heightened narrative awareness that what is taking place is of profound moral significance. Intimations of this awareness are transposed onto Ben Attar, who, as he undoes his robe in feverish anticipation, "feels the hardness of the malehood, avidly seeking purpose and relief, overtake him, and, while still throbbing against the mourners rent in the robe, no longer holds back and wraps itself, but only itself, in the warm velvet of its seed" (295,286). The importance of Ben Attar's thoughts at this emblematic moment of failed manhood is indicated by their emphasis in the text: Is this the merging that I so desire, Ben Attar thinks in horrified despair and disappointment at the seed that was spent in vain into the darkness of the cabin. Because if it is, then it is not a merging but a punishment, which I seek to inflict not only upon myself, but also upon the one who remains with me. (295,287) With this piercing insight, Ben Attar finally connects with the moral matrix that has been evolving through the story of his journey. He now realizes that his self-centered fantasy of desire cannot lead to a true union of love between himself and his wife because this fantasy was actually a reflection of self-love that led to the abuse of his wife's dignity, as well as to a diminishment of his own. Ben Attar's recognition that the desire for duality is actually an impediment to mutuality moves the narrative strongly toward an affirma tion of an alternative concept of love and a different notion of manhood.</page><page sequence="17">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 251 This movement is expressed through an almost anthropomorphic trans formation of Ben Attar's male member from an imperious instrument of indiscriminate desire to a much more humble source of solace and communion. We are told that "the malehood that had lost its crest and its purpose" now stands flaccid and ashamed, soft and teary. And although in this condition it is afraid to approach the single wife, who may have already despaired of it, it knows that it will have no expiation except by true touch, which, while not leading to consummation, will bring about consolation. (295, 287) Driven toward such true touch, the master of the ship kneels silently before his wife, and, in the most tender of the novel's love scenes, gently kisses and embraces her, seeking not passion but compassion, and discovering to his surprise "that the tears that he had suppressed so forcefully and so firmly for so many days are now flowing freely from his eyes" (296,287). Once again, Ben Attar is not fully aware of the import of what is occurring. He mourns what he considers to be a loss of manhood, and, as the narrator reveals, he "cannot imagine how wonderful and how sweet the woman found the man's tears that were trickling between her breasts_Because precisely at the point where maleness falters and fails, manhood is sometimes sweetest and most appealing" (296, 288). It is precisely at this point of introducing an alternative notion of masculinity that the narrator also has the first wife express, with the most intimate part of her body, her affirmation of the narrative's preferred notion of love. She conveys "the message of the single wife, who does not want the man's fantasy or the spirit of his imagination, but only his reality and his love" (296,288). This is also the point where, after explaining that this is because "the spirit of the imagination not only can expand but also go wild," the narrator shifts his focus from the moment of intimacy aboard the ship to the scene of debauchery in the sculptor's cottage, sharpening the moral contrast between the two competing notions of love. He clinches this contrast by juxtaposing the aftermath of the black youth's night of licentious desire with that of Ben Attar's experience of tenderness and compassion. We are told that while the body of the exhausted idol worshiper lies sprawled among the graven images at the feet of his own shrouded likeness, bearing the tooth marks of the Gallic women's voracious desire, and stained with the endless outpouring of his own seed, the rain stirs Ben Attar from his slumber, and... amid the new fragrance of leftover spices that spilled from their sacks and became intermingled, he begins to caress to embrace to kiss and to squeeze the one wife who was left with him. And the first wife is quick to respond to the awakening man with the full force of her love, in a singular and intact</page><page sequence="18">252 GILEAD MORAHG coupling, with no extraneous thought and with no trace of another. (298-99, 291) This juxtaposition of the spent slave, who is drained and stained by the excesses of desire, and Ben Attar, who is awakened to a consumma tion that is free, if only for the moment, of anything but the love of one person for another, is a metaphorical refutation of the ethos of desire and a powerful affirmation of an ethos based on a recognition of mutual humanity and individual singularity. And, as it moves through its final chapter, the novel reaffirms that these are the essential foundations of a true and lasting union, in a family as well as in a nation. They mark the moral boundary where the principles of humanity supersede the impera tives of diversity. By this point, the narrative has fully joined in Esther Minna's view that these are principles that must never be relinquished to contradictory cultural practices and that the boundary they mark must not be crossed, even in the name of national unity. To the end, the narrator maintains his sober and determinedly unsentimental perspective on the complexities of the human soul. The monogamous choice promulgated by Esther-Minna and upheld by the narrative is not presented as a source of emotional redemption or harmo nious bliss. It is seen as a sacrifice: a necessary loss taken with great pain for the sake of a greater gain. Ben Attar's sense of loss is agonizing and profound. But as Rabbi Elbaz, who has himself learned a thing or two in the course of the journey, points out, it is also secondary to other considerations. When Ben Attar awakens Elbaz on the night they set sail for home, in order to bemoan his defeat and proclaim "that the partner ship that was renewed between north and south could never compensate and comfort him for what he lost forever on this journey" (317, 308), the rabbi has little patience for his lament. He regards Ben Attar's personal deprivation as insignificant compared with the tribulations that await the small group of southern Jews on their journey home. It certainly pales in comparison with catastrophes awaiting the northern Jews with the onset of the new millennium, and with the threats to their existence as a people, which will intensify as this millennium progresses. It is against this imminence of catastrophe and fragmentation that characterized the Jewish experience during the second millennium that the emotional price exacted from Ben Attar is weighed and found to be well worth paying. The true gauge of the losses and gains resulting from the sacrifices required for the sustenance of the partnership, which has come to symbolize the unity of the Jewish people, is provided not by Ben Attar's vexed proclamations, but by the shifting pattern of his relations with his chief rival, Esther-Minna. As the narrative draws toward conclusion, there are intimations of a growing attraction between the two antagonists. When the time to set sail</page><page sequence="19">A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium 253 again approaches, Ben Attar discovers that it is hard for him to part "not only from the nephew, whose partnership had been renewed with blood and suffering, but also from his blue-eyed wife, whose firm gentleness suddenly transforms her old aversion to a new and powerful attraction" (301, 292). This leads the narrator to wonder about the nature of "the strange attraction that is now flowing between the northern woman and the southern man" and to raise the possibility "that their close proximity during the slow journey from Paris to Worms kindled in one of them, or perhaps even in both, an insane and forbidden fantasy, and that the desire to act on this fantasy is actually delaying the departure" (302, 293). The fact that they refrain from acting upon this forbidden fantasy and direct their newfound affinity toward strengthening a far more important unity is the novel's final affirmation that the antidote to fantasies of desire is not, as Elbaz had argued, the subordination of one gender to another, but rather a mutual sublimation of this desire in the service of a higher common cause. Having systematically fused the personalities of each of the two rivals with the attributes of the disparate communities that they represent, and with the problematics of unity in the nation to which they both belong, the narrator brings Ben Attar and Esther-Minna to the point where, operating as equals and drawing on their deeply felt affinity, they break through the barriers of doubt and suspicion to collaborate in a plan to secure the partnership between them. The details of the plan they devise involve leaving Rabbi Elbaz's son with Esther-Minna and having Ben Attar take Abulafia's daughter back to Tangier. But it is in the narrator's mode of telling about this plan that the thematic points are most clearly made: Indeed, this is the strange notion that is, amazingly, now flickering in the minds of both litigants, harsh adversaries who battled each other, first at a distance of two continents, then face to face, and now, as they prepare to take leave of each other, in the midst of the reservations and the suspicions they have about the partnership that was renewed, they come together [mizdavgim], fearful and fatigued, to a new idea that involves exchanging a child for a child, not only in order to ensure the ongoing existence [of the partnership], as Ben Attar wishes, but also to ensure its virtue,21 as Esther Minna wishes. (309, 300) By his extraordinary use of mizdavgim, the Hebrew word for copulation, to denote this coming together, the narrator points to the sublimational effort that is needed to overcome individual fantasies of desire so as to forge a communal union that is both lasting and moral. With Ben Attar and Esther-Minna having successfully made this effort, the transforma tion from cultural adversity to a shared sense of unity is complete. The</page><page sequence="20">254 GILEAD MORAHG narrator affirms the consequences of this transformation in a telling passage of celebratory grace: And thus, on an evening of autumn in Paris, to the sound of bells from the abbey of Saint Germain de Pres on the riverbank, the old aversion dissolves, and a partnership that was born anew from within the nearby grave of the second wife, is so powerfully welded and fused . . . that for a moment it seems that from now on, it will be even stronger and more stable than it was before Abulafia met his future wife at the inn in Orleans. (310, 300) Geoffrey Hartman has argued that there are two major concepts of culture that are contrasting and perhaps contradictory. One denotes a culture, which embodies a specific and distinct form of religious, ethnic, racial or national solidarity. The other adheres to a general ideal that transcends the distinguishing particularities and posits a shared human heritage.22 A Journey to the End of the Millennium questions the inevitability of this dichotomy. It suggests that in order to attain unity in a nation consisting of cultures of the first kind, there are junctures in which the contrasts must be transcended and the contradictions resolved on the basis of the shared human ideals of the second kind. These shared ideals are offered as the fundamental source of viable national unity because they proclaim the equality and preserve the dignity of every member of the national community. In the course of the novel, polygamy becomes a metaphor for all cultural practices that permit the desires of certain members of a society to impinge on the equality and dignity of others. By affirming the ban against such practices, the novel draws a moral line that marks the limits of cultural tolerance and connects the imagined events at the end of the first millennium to the realities of personal and national life at the end of the present miUennium. Ben Attar's choices and the sacrifices he makes in order to preserve the national partnership are emblematic of the choices and sacrifices that must continually be made in order to continue to preserve this partnership. Since these choices point to a partnership based on concrete moral principles that are bound to the humanity of others?as opposed to the drives of fantastic, therefore boundless, and ultimately dehumanizing, desire?it may well be that the narrative's underlying concern with national unity stems not from the diversity of the ethnic communities that make up the Israeli partnership, but from the fervors of the ideological communities that are in deep conflict within it.

Yehoshua, interview with Ya'akov Besser, 'Iton 77, 205 (March 1997): 44. 2. Some of the more obvious allusions are to the poem "Ben lu hayah li" [If I had a son] by the poet Rahel (1890-1931), p. 304; and, twice, to Yehoshua's own story, "Shtiqa holekhet umitmashekhet shel meshorer" [The continuing silence of a poet] (1966), pp. 212,229. Some examples of strictly contemporary Hebrew usages are: sihmutf [debriefing], p. 48; memutar [miniaturized], p. 173; and phrases such as "an error in the calculation of time and space," p. 77, or "a small anthology of pleas," p. 246. For more examples and discussion of mis aspect of the novel, see: Avraham Balaban, "An Idealization of Rivals" [Hebrew], Hado'ar, 7 March 1997, p. 14; Dorit Silberman, "The Yehoshua Report: On Male Sexuality" [Hebrew], Moznayim 71, no. 7 (May 1997): 4, 7. 3. While he was writing the novel, Yehoshua identified himself as this narrator: "In the new novel I really do take total authority, and I won't even say that I have a main speaker. There is no multiplicity of voice but ramer a pluralism that comes only through the authority of the writer himself. In the new novel there are very, very few dialogues?it is a novel without dialogues, or very few dialogues, because even when people speak to each other they speak through me, I interpret what they are saying," Bernard Horn, Facing the Fires: Conversations with A. B. Yehoshua (Syracuse, 1997), p. 164. 4. The assumption that this particular social issue is central to A Journey to the End of the Millennium is evident in many of the early reviews of the novel. See, for example, Avraham Balaban, "Between Two Women" [Hebrew], Yedi'ot Aharonot, 28 February 1997; Aviad Kleinberg, "A View from the End of the Second Millennium" [Hebrew], Ha'aretz, 4 April 1997; Amnon Navot, "Exceeding the Limits of Elite Acceptance" [Hebrew], Ma'ariv, 7 March 1997.

In the midst of writing A Journey to the End of the Millennium, Yehoshua told Bernard Horn that the book "is very ideological, but not, of course, in the Israeli context" He then continued, "With this new novel I am going back beyond Zionism, beyond all the modern issues, to try, if possible, to discover the unity of the Jewish people" (Horn, p. 167). 10.

He believes that his refusal was the cause of her suicide. A Journey to the End of the Millennium, p. 205. 20.

After looking long and thinking hard, I chose "virtue" as the translation for Yehoshua's use of the Hebrew word kashrut.
