<plain_text><page sequence="1">EFFECr OF ULTRA VIREs TRANSACTIONS. -When the sovereign gave definite effect to the idea that the act of a community of men should be distinguished from their several acts by erecting the community into an artificial legal person,' the courts naturally had to pass upon the rights and liabilities of this new being. In its nature they found its limitations. Being invisible, it could appear only by attorney j2 and being intangi- ble, it could not suffer or commit personal injuries.3 Having no soul,4 it could not commit a crime 5 or take an oath.6 All these limitations were inherent in its nature, and not due to any legal prohibition. Even in requiring a seal, the courts merely followed the custom of cor- 1 X Poll. &amp; Mait. Hist. Eng. Law, 2d ed., 502, 669 et seq. 2 Brooke Abr. tit. Corp. 63. 8 Brooke Abr. tit. Corp, 63.

But these statutes did not change their nature. When, however, the question of the effect of ultra vires transactions first came before courts of the nineteenth century, the principles of agency were sufficient to overcome the difficulties which beset the ancient lawyers on account of their pseudo-anthropomorphic conception. Nevertheless, many courts seem to have confounded the older idea of inherent limitations with an idea of disability arising from lack of authorization by charter.8 As a result, the law is in conifusion. Many cases go to the extent of saying that an ultra vires transaction, whether executed or executory, is absolutely void. Sha7w v. Nationa4, etc., Bank, I32 Fed. Rep. 658; 4nglo-American, etc., Co. v. Lombard, 132 Fed. Rep. 721. Most of the authorities, how- ever, agree in refusing to enforce a wholly executory ultra vires contract,9 and also in refuising to overthrow the transaction if completely executed on both sides.'0 If one party has fully performed, and thereby conferred a benefit upon the other, the courts are almost evenly divided as to holding the party benefited to his bargain." And where the act done is within the apparent power of a corporation, so that only its officers have means of knowing whether the contract is ultra or intra vires, some courts enforce it.12 Moreover, in many of these cases, the ultra vires transaction is held so far effective as to give one of the parties quasi-contractual rights.13 Upon principle, as well as historically, the theory that a transaction is absolutely void simply because it is ultra vires is without foundation. Un- der this theory no corporation could commit a tort or a crime or do any- thing to justify quo warranto proceediings on the part of the State. 'rhe argument that in such cases a corporation is acting not in excess but in abuse of its powers is untenable, for abuses, as well as excesses, are strictly beyond the lowers granted in the charter. The true doctrine would seem- to be that a corporation has the power to do anything, while its charter defines the limits of its authority. Lack of authorization is not equivalent to absolute statutory prohibition ;14 but the stocklholders and creditors have the right to rely upon the terms of the charter, and, therefore, to object to ultra vires transactions.15 Upon this ground it has been ably argued that, in the absence of objection by creditors or stockholders, all ultra vires transactions should be enforced."8 This contention, however, disregards the interest of the public in controlling and limiting corporate action within the bounds imposed by charter. It is this public policy which 7 I Poll. &amp; Mait. Hist. Eng. Law, 2d ed., 683. 8 Thomas v. Railroad Co., fOI U. S. 71, 82 et seq. Davis v. Old Colony R. Co., T31 Mass. 258. See South, etc, Ry. v.

S. 538. 14 Sometimes statutes forbid a corporation to do ultra vires acts. In such a case the court must decide what the statute means, and apply the law in regard to any illegal contract. See 20 N. J. Eq. 542, 562, 564. Similarly in deciding the effect of the Mortmain Acts, the courts decided that the tranisaction was void as to superstitious corporations, but voidable as to other corporations. It is important to distinguish such cases from simple ultra vires acts. 15 Colman v. Eastern Counties Ry. Co., iO Beav. I. 16 Professor George Wharton Pepper in 9 HARV. L.

Though the corporation has acted, the courts refuse to give effect to those acts. But when the contract is fully performed in good faith on one side, the public policy against its enforcement is overbalanced by the hardship which such refusal would cause. The disability, being imposed for reasons of public good, should be removed by the sanme considerations.</page></plain_text>
