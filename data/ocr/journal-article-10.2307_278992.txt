MESOAMERICA If a single approach could be argued to characterize the diversity of recent Mesoamerican research, it would be settlement pattern studies. Few major site or regional projects neglect to incorporate settlement patterns among their data and analytic foci; many are devoted expressly to demographic and economic studies which can be accomplished only through systematic survey, surface collection, and excavation. The Basin of Mexico, the Teotihuacan Valley, Tula, the Valley of Oaxaca, Coatlan, Tehuacin, the Valley of Guatemala, Chalcatzingo, the Lower Papaloapan, and various parts of the Maya lowlands are among the subjects of such study. A secondary focus of research is trade and economic specialization pursued through obsidian and ceramic analyses of sources, production, and distribution. In view of the relatively complete coverage of major periods and areas, it must be expected that such research will substantially revise our conceptions of Mesoamerican behavioral diversity and economic interactions. Several recent publications apply economic and locational models (e.g., The Early Mesoamerican Village, edited by K. V. Flannery, 1976) which are relatively recent in archaeology and enrich the methodological repertoire (e.g., site catch- ment and areal nearest-neighbor analyses have been applied and discussed). Where the previous decade provided a critical impetus in subsistence and ecologi- cal studies, particularly in regard to the origins and implications of farming, recent projects typically address later periods and other economic and demographic topics. VALLEY OF MEXICO. The Proyecto Cuenca de Mexico was inaugurated in early 1976 in the Departamento de Monumentos Prehispanicos, I.N.A.H., coordinated by Jurgen Bruggemann in archaeology and Eduardo Corona S. in ethnohistory, with the participation of additional personnel. The broadly conceived project is oriented to tracing sociocultural development as well as to mitigating the increasing impact of urban expansion on archaeolog- ical resources in the valley. Five target areas have been chosen, each of which is expected to yield distinct kinds of information. A fossil chinampa area between Xochimilco and San Gregorio will be studied in terms of chinampa morphology, patterning, and technology, in conjunction with excavation of associated habita- tions and presumed control sites to determine settle- ment pattern and systems of economic production and distribution. The northern Ecatepec area will be surveyed, with some excavations, to establish a ceramic sequence and site and regional settlement patterns, with an emphasis again on economic inter- pretations. The Azcapotzalco site will be studied stratigraphically to establish a cultural sequence, with interpretive emphasis on the site's Classic and Post- classic political roles. The Huexotla-Cuauhtinchan area, for which relatively rich ethnohistoric data is available, will be used to develop archaeological methods for verification of written descriptions. Finally, archaeological salvage investigations will be continued in Mexico City. Such excavations have been numerous and revealed, for example, a predominately Coyotlatelco phase series of habitation constructions at Cerro de la Estrella, which provided data on relatively large room size and on an extensive drainage system. Robert K. Alexander (Delaware) and three assistants continued survey and excavation of water- control features in the northern Valley of Mexico. The project, sponsored by the Centro de Investigaciones Superiores, I.N.A.H., is coordinated with Angel Palerm's ethnohistoric research on pre-Spanish water control systems. Excavations test trenched a major causeway once separating the northern lakes from Lake Texcoco and tested a fossil system of chinampas southeast of the site/village of Xaltocan in the northern valley. The research is oriented to the relationships between the development of intensive agriculture, district-wide systems of water control, and centralization in the Postclassic. Felipe R. Solis 0., Ma. Antonieta Cervantes, and Ruben Cabrera (Museo Nacional de Antropologia, I.N.A.H.) continue excavation and salvage of late prehispanic and historic hydraulic systems in Chapultepec. Ponds, cisterns, and aquaducts have been 272</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH 273 located, some in association with representations of water deities. Solis is also engaged in study of Aztec sculpture with a goal of enlarging the catalog of museum collections and interpreting the ideological role played by the monuments. Thomas H. Charlton (Iowa) and a staff of research assistants conducted surface survey and collection in 1975 along two probable natural trade routes, one between Otumba in the Teotihuacin Valley and Tlaxcala, the other from Otumba to Santiago Tulantepec near Tulancingo, Hidalgo. Sites ranged temporally from Terminal Formative to Late Re- publican. This NEH project attempted to expand knowledge of precolumbian trade systems and their significance. Data analyzed indicate a major develop- ment of trade beginning with the rise of Teotihuacin in the Terminal Formative and continuing to the end of Teotihuacin. This trade included the export of Thin Orange pottery from Teotihuacan to the south- east during the city's later phases, persisting into Metepec times. In addition, sites were established near Tepeapulco northeast of Teotihuacan which were involved in the exploitation of obsidian from at least two sources (Pachuca and Paredon). It appears that the Paredon source materials were redistributed out- side of the Teotihuacan Valley. Subsequent to the demise of Teotihuacan, the trade routes fall into disuse during the Coyotlatelco phase. The route to the southeast began to be used again only during the Aztec period. However, the Tepeapulco area became the center of obsidian exploitation and tool manufac- ture during the Mazapan phase, continuing into the Aztec period. Again, the trade in Paredon obsidian was outside of the Teotihuacan Valley. Two preliminary research conclusions are suggested. (1) There is in- creased trade associated with cultural development and expansion in the Valley of Mexico. (2) The trade takes various forms including the centralized manufac- ture and distribution of Thin Orange and the decen- tralized exploitation of obsidian and redistribution of obsidian tools (i.e., the resource materials do not occur at the primary centers of Teotihuacan, Tula, or Tenochtitlan). Martin Boksenbaum (Queens, CUNY) is analyzing chipped stone manufacturing in Early and Middle Preclassic sites in the Basin of Mexico excavated by Paul Tolstoy (Queens, CUNY). To date two manu- facturing approaches have been distinguished, one involving less elaborate nodular flake production and the other a more sophisticated blade-core process. Further investigation will seek to determine if these manufacturing techniques correlate with household production and craft specialization, respectively, and if distinct procurement and distribution patterns of materials pertain to each. Geological, geochemical, and petrographic studies of Mexican obsidian deposits from 15 sources and three archaeological sites in the trans-Mexico volcanic belt have been conducted by Gary C. Allen (New Orleans) and Guillermo Ramirez (formerly New Orleans, now National University, Bogota). Samples were chemically analyzed for ten elements during 1975-76 by X-ray fluorescence; the results were subjected to statistical testing to determine between- source discrimination. This is one part of research planned with additional geologists to obtain a valid data bank to which archaeologists may compare Mesoamerican obsidian artifacts to trace ancient trading patterns. HIDALGO. Proyecto Tula, coordinated by Eduardo Matos M. (Monumentos Prehispinicos, I.N.A.H.) continued regional settlement pattern studies in 1976, including survey which located approximately 300 sites of varied functions and periods. Further excavations in Tula itself will test diachronic interpretations from which population estimates were developed by Juan Yaduen in one of the three volumes already published by the project through I.N.A.H. The Tula Archaeological Project directed by Richard A. Diehl and Robert A. Benfer (Missouri- Columbia) continues analyses with NSF support. Dan Healan (Baylor) is preparing a descriptive and func- tional study of over 60 rooms comprising 13 houses plus a barrio-type temple located in the northern city sector. Healan is interested in room use, household economy, and the interrelationships among social groups. James Stoutamire (Florida State Museum) is finishing analysis of the urban zone survey, which will (1) delineate the city's occupational history from Prado phase ("Metepec") beginnings up into the colonial period, (2) point out specialized activity areas such as workshops and residential zones, and (3) provide population estimates. Trend surface analysis and other computer techniques are among the procedures used. Robert Cobean (Harvard) has defined a ceramic sequence and is examining economic pat- terns reflected in ceramics. Lithic remains are the subject of a number of investigations. Alice N. Benfer (Missouri-Columbia) is finishing obsidian analysis which has as its goals: (1) the description of manu- facture of prismatic blades, which form the majority of the assemblage, (2) interpretation of the distribu- tion of various tool types within architectural con- texts, and (3) a wear pattern study of the blades to ascertain use. Alice N. Benfer, Robert Cobean, and James A. Vogt will analyze obsidian using X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation. On the basis of present evidence, approximately 80% of Tula obsidian originated from the Pachuca (Cerro de Navajas) mines, approximately 18% from the Zinepecuaro, Michoacan source (exact location of mines presently unknown), and very small amounts (less than 1%) from the Otumba and Altotonga source areas. Ground stone artifacts, fauna, flora from soil flotation samples, figurines, and relevant ethnohistoric sources are sub- jects of study by other project personnel. Robert Benfer is preparing a computer data tape of all the project information, to be made available to scholars unsatisfied with project conclusions or who wish to use the data for other purposes. EDO. DE MEXICO. Thomas E. Durbin and Judith B. Durbin (CSC Stanislaus) will conduct an eth- nographic project in 1977 to obtain comparative data in the Valley of Toluca on socioeconomic determinants affecting multiethnic communities. These data are designed to complement their previous prehistoric and ethnohistoric studies of Matlazinca, Otomi, and Nahua groups. The research will be focused on non- competition among ethnic units due to their exploita-</page><page sequence="3">274 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 tion of distinct ecologic niches, which minimizes exchanges across ethnic boundaries and maintains high degrees of cultural uniqueness. MORELOS-GUERRERO. The Coatlan Project under Jorge Angulo (Centro Regional de Morelos- Guerrero, I.N.A.H.) was begun in 1975, targeted at the area described in a sixteenth century codex listing Coatlan and adjacent towns, which form subareas of study. Rough geographic limits include the area between Cuernavaca, Iguala, and Malinalco. Surface survey of the Coatlan de Rio region by Kenneth Hirth (Western Michigan and I.N.A.H.) during 1975 and 1976 attempted to locate, map, and sample over 200 sites within the valleys of the Rio Chalma and Rio Amacusac. All of the area was surveyed using methods based on those developed by Parsons in the Valley of Mexico. Material recovered ranges from Early Forma- tive to the Postclassic. Settlement pattern and demographic analysis will be pursued. Stratigraphic test pit excavations were conducted by Hirth at Cuautlita, Coatlan, and Miahuatlan, Morelos to develop a cultural sequence. Data indicate Late and Terminal Formative occupations were large in western Morelos. Teotihuacin influence appears to have been greater in eastern Morelos than to the west. Hirth also began mapping the extent and distribution of residential areas around the site of Xochicalco on a field by field basis. Surface collections were taken in transect samples, and major features were sampled non-randomly to augment the transect data. Soil phosphate testing was used to help establish differential population densities. As another aspect of the Coatlan project Raul Arana (Centro Regional de Morelos-Guerrero, I.N.A.H.) surveyed the Laguna de Coatetelco region in 1975, locating major sites and describing a size hierarchy of settlements. Arana test excavated at the Coatetelco site and uncovered Classic to Postclassic occupation. In 1976 excavations and restoration were continued with the support of the Secretaria de la Presidencia which plans eventual installation of a local museum. As part of a settlement pattern study Dennis Lewarch (Washington) and Roger Mason (Texas) have recently conducted survey and surface collection using a 25% (or more) systematic random sampling design in the Rio Chalma Valley. Some test excavations will help refine the ceramic chronology. The research project at Chalcatzingo, Morelos, under David Grove (Illinois), Jorge Angulo, and Raul Arana conducted a brief field season in 1976 which attempted to clarify certain aspects of stratigraphy during this excavation a stone-faced Early Formative platform structure was uncovered. The project's earlier work had identified several examples of Middle Formative monumental architecture, the earliest cur- rently known north of Oaxaca. Project publications are in preparation, with ongoing research directed to specialized analyses including computerization of ceramic data (Ann Cyphers, U.N.A.M.) and figurine data (Mark Harlan, New Mexico), and strontium analysis of burials (Margaret Schoeninger, Michigan). Neutron activation of obsidian will be carried out by the Environmental Research Laboratory at Illinois. At the walled site of Cerro de Zacatepechi in Morelos, located on a prominence about 4 km west of Xochicalco, Jaime Litvak K. (U.N.A.M.) and univer- sity students have completed two of four projected seasons of excavation and consolidation. This site was occupied during and after the period of maximum occupation of Xochicalco. Investigations are method- ologically oriented to evaluate excavation techniques and laboratory methods in ceramic analysis. During 1975-76, the first season of the Valley of Xochipala Archaeological Project was directed by Paul Schmidt, assisted by Maria Teresa Cabrero (U.N.A.M.). 2Fifty sites of varied sizes were located in the 70 km valley in Guerrero. Surface collections were made, and 25 pits tested five sites. The ceramics suggest continuous occupation from Middle Preclassic to Postclassic times. One probably Late Classic site included corbel vault architecture, one of the few indicators of external relations. Louise Paradis (Montreal) located 100 sites in the Middle Balsas Basin in Guerrero in the vicinity of Amuco de la Reforma (10 km2 ) and excavated in six. This research between 1971 and 1974 documented a long sequence from 1600 B.C. to the present, with gaps in the Late Preclassic and Late Classic Periods. Ceramics from Amuco represent a local tradition with some similarities to material described by Brush for the Pacific coast of Guerrero. Among the few "intru- sive" artifacts from the Middle Balsas were an Olmec style ceramic miniature mask and figurine head at- tributed respectively to Sesame subphases 1 and 2, between 1600 and 1200 B.C. In general, the Amuco area is characterized by geographic isolation and cultural conservatisnm. Prehistoric settlement patterns give good evidence for a predominantly agricultural society because river banks and the valley floor were favored locations. Paradis' doctoral dissertation (Yale) explores ethnographic and ethnohistoric alternatives for economic and political interpretations of the archaeological record. OAXACA. During 1976 Charles D. Cheek (Tulsa) and Marcus Winter (I.N.A.H.) began a seriation project with Monte Alban I ceramics from bell-shaped pits in residential zones of Monte Albin. They expect the computerized seriation to permit identification of two to three subphases which will provide more conclusive, finer chronological control than is pre- sently available. This in turn will facilitate study of differential rates of population growth at sites in the Oaxaca Valley. Their classification, which does not use the type-variety system, emphasizes form as a primary characteristic. A second phase of a settlement pattern project in the Valley of Oaxaca directed by Richard E. Blanton (Purdue) is nearly completed. Supported by NSF and the CUNY Research Foundation, the project is pro- ducing the final 1:10,000 map of Monte Albin, designed for comparability with Millon's Teotihuacin map, and is also engaged in coding and analysis of Monte Albin settlement pattern data. Steve Kowalewski (Hunter, CUNY) extended systematic survey to the valley's central region, an area of 230 km2. Project results suggest that the evolutionary trajectory of the Valley of Oaxaca as well as its regional organization differed from those in the Valley of Mexico. Specifically, Monte Alban seems to have been almost exclusively a regional political capital and</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH 275 perhaps ritual center with few or no economic roles, in contrast to Teotihuacan, which combined all three functions. Currently Robert N. Zeitlin is using X-ray fluo- rescence on obsidian samples from 26 geologic sources in M6xico, Guatemala, and Honduras to characterize each in terms of trace elements. In conjunction obsidian artifacts from dated archaeological contexts from the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Oaxaca) are being analyzed to assign them source origins. PUEBLA. Since 1974 Robert D. Drennan (former- ly R. S. Peabody, now Michigan) has directed the Palo Blanco project in the Tehuacan Valley, devoted to analysis of the emergence of Classic period society. La Nopalera (Ts240) and Quachilco (Ts218) were tested in 1975. Refinement of the Palo Blanco phase ceramic sequence is possible with the collections from these sites. Intensive surface survey at Quachilco in 1975 by John R. Alden (Michigan) defined larger than ex- pected site boundaries in the Late Formative and Early Classic. Surface indications of functionally distinct areas will be investigated in 1977 by excava- tion. During 1976 Charles S. Spencer (Michigan) and Elsa Redmond (Yale) mapped and made intensive surface collections of habitation sites in the vicinity of the Purr6n Dam in order to obtain data on settlements believed related to the dam. Survey and collection were also used by Judith A. Nowack (Michigan) at larger Palo Blanco sites in the north and central sections of the valley in order to study ceramic production and distribution. GULF COAST LOWLANDS. Settlement pattern studies were continued in the estuarine zone of the Lower Papaloapan Basin, Veracruz, under the direc- tion of Barbara L. Stark (Arizona State). In 1974 Stark made further field tests of aerial photography for site location. J. Simon Bruder, with Robert Gasser and Elinor Large (Arizona State), analyzed modern vegetational variation on different landforms and documented greater diversity of economic species both on active levees and prehistoric sites. With respect to floral resources alone, Bruder concluded that the assumption that settlement shifts will strictly follow channel shifts is unwarranted. Various preliminary ethnoarchaeological studies were pursued in 1976, among them the sampling of activity areas in the patio of a modern rural fisherman's house by Marsha Smith (Arizona State). This investigation gathered data to assess the archaeological "visibility" of activity areas and the respective merits of flotation and wet screening with graduated fine screens. Large conducted a feasibility study of determinants of modern rural settlement patterns, and Stark collected information on modern pottery making in Tlacotalpan for comparison with archaeological ceramics from Patarata Island, Veracruz. John F. Scott (Cornell) received an NEH grant to study post-Olmec art in Veracruz during 1974-75. Two sites proved important for Scott's research, El Carrizal, located between Jalapa and the coast, ex- cavated by Bertha Cuevas de Alvarez during the early 1960s, and El Mes6n, in the Tuxtla Mountains, surface surveyed by Ponciano Ortiz. Two stone "frog yokes" were found at El Carrizal in Lower Remojadas contexts associated with tetrapods and a sherd with the incised profile of an Izapan long-nosed dragon; this strongly suggests a date for Lower Remojadas in the Protoclassic. El Mes6n ceramics appear to date from the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic, which Scott suggests is also the temporal placement for the El Mes6n stela. In 1973 the U.N.A.M. Centro de Estudios Mayas began a project coordinated by Lorenzo Ochoa in the northwestern Maya lowlands, aimed principally at terrain in Tabasco. To date survey, mapping, and excavation in lithic workshops and habitations has been accomplished. Artifacts and osteological remains are undergoing analysis. The project is designed to obtain settlement pattern data adequate to test the hierarchical settlement model developed by Joyce Marcus using central place theory and epigraphy. CHIAPAS. Mari Cruz Paill6s H. (Museo Nacional de Antropologfa, I.N.A.H.) excavated at the 18 mound Paj6n site on the coast of Chiapas in 1973. By 1975 analysis was completed on material from test squares and a trench, which documented occupation from 1000 B.C. to A.D. 600. Subsistence practices empha- sized estuary and sea resources. Over time social organization became more complex, with public architecture eventually constructed. In 1975 Paill6s began excavations at Mano Amate, in the Ci6nega de Lagartero near Trinitaria, Chiapas. This Late Preclassic to Protoclassic site includes occupation areas and a plaza with public buildings. Its investigation is part of a larger project directed by Gareth W. Lowe (N.W.A.F.) to investigate the demographic and cul- tural history of the Ci6nega district. A final report on excavations at three shell midden sites in the coastal mangrove zone of Chiapas has been completed by Barbara Voorhies (UCSB) and will appear in the N.W.A.F. reports. The Chontuto occupa- tion at these sites dates to the Late Archaic (3000- 2000 B.C.) and gives evidence of resident fishermen seasonally augmented by inland groups. Merle Greene Robertson (Robert Louis Stevenson) has directed the Palenque Stucco project from 1973-76, photographing in black and white and color all stucco sculpture at the Chiapan site. Preparation of corrected line drawings is also underway. I.N.A.H. and M.A.R.I. will serve as repositories for the photographs. Robertson is also working on the Florida State Museum's project to construct slightly reduced repro- ductions of some stucco structures at Palenque. Molds were made and shipped to Florida for cement casting, with the final product then painted in the original colors. Robertson is also producing oil paintings of reconstructed scenes of Maya life as subjects for museum exhibit transparencies. Reproductions of a Palenque Palace and of Room 1 at Bonampak (with paintings executed by and based on new drawings of the originals by Phillipe Davalos) are part of the FSM project. The museum exhibits are designed to demon- strate the possibility of creating a Maya ceremonial center exhibit without removing material from the country of origin. Dumbarton Oaks has recently sponsored various projects and conferences which have an epigraphic emphasis. Robert L. Rands (Southern Illinois) and Linda Schele (South Alabama) prepared a history of Palenque using the ceramic sequence, building stages,</page><page sequence="5">276 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 and inscriptions. Dumbarton Oaks sponsored a series of conferences on the inscriptions of Palenque, in which a number of scholars participated. Another conference addressed Maya site interrelationships as revealed by inscriptions. Ian Graham assisted by Eric von Euw (Peabody Museum) continue a long-term project devoted to recording and publishing as completely as possible the extant corpus of Maya inscriptions. Various sources have funded the work, consisting of photographic and drawn records of both hieroglyphic and figural sculpture from sites in all parts of the Maya lowlands. YUCATAN, QUINTANA ROO, CAMPECHE. The I.N.A.H. southeast regional center at Merida has sponsored several recent archaeological studies. An archaeological atlas of Yucatan is being prepared by Silvia Garza T. and Edward B. Kurjack on the basis of survey and mapping during 1975 and 1976. Classic period lithics from Becan, Chicanna, and X-Puhil in southern Campeche are undergoing statistical typolog- ical analysis by Barbara E. Konieczna, in part to determine manufacturing technology. The Can-Cun survey and excavation project under Pablo Mayer G. is engaged in study of Protoclassic to Postclassic settle- ment pattern in the native province of Ecab. Mapping, consolidation, and excavation by Victor Segovia P. at Kohunlich in southern Quintana Roo attempted to delimit the site and define the rainwater capture and distribution system. In northern Quintana Roo the Coba project, under Norberto Gonzalez C., director of the southeastern center, has recently published a cooperative study of modern flora and ethnobotany in the site area, authored by Alfredo Barrera M., Alfredo Barrera V., and Rosa Maria L6pez F. One element of settlement pattern studies around Coba has been completed, the mapping and regional interpretation of the road network by A. Benavides C. Other aspects of settlement pattern, ceramics, and mural painting are foci of other investigations by Jaime Gardunio A., Fernando Robles C., Eduardo Toro Q., and Martine Fettweis. Anthony P. Andrews (Arizona) is con- ducting survey and mapping to identify sites of precolumbian salt production and attendant com- mercial routes (also sponsored by the National Geo- graphic Society). The Tancah-Tulum Archaeological Project directed by Arthur G. Miller (Dumbarton Oaks) has systematic- ally recorded extant murals in the Tancah-Tulum zone. Excavations helped fill out the cultural historical framework. Colonial period occupation at Tancah was investigated by test pits in 1975. Frank Saul will ana- lyze skeletal remains from burials at the site, and Joseph Ball is in charge of ceramic analysis. During 1974-75 Miller and Nancy M. Farriss (Pennsylvania) co-directed the first phase of an underwater coastal survey in Quintana Roo, at Chunyaxche, a freshwater lake connected to the Caribbean by a series of lagoons and channels, at Tancah Bay, and at the inlet of Xelha. The project includes a number of additional personnel who have participated in diving and exploration of underwater caves which were once utilized prehis- torically. The Royal Ontario Museum has sponsored the Uaymil Survey Project in southwestern Quintana Roo, directed by Peter D. Harrison with Robert E. Fry (Purdue) as the co-investigator responsible for ceramic testing and analysis. During 1972-74 sites were located, mapped, and tested as the first stage of the research. Eighty-one sites were visited, 79 of which were previously unreported; they range in size from hamlets to moderate-sized "ceremonial centers." The ceramic sequence ranges from Late Preclassic to Postclassic. Site distributions correlated closely with the natural distribution of seasonal swamps, which aerial photographs suggest may have been used for intensive agriculture. Conclusions to date suggest that the area was densely populated both in Late Classic and Postclassic times. Late Classic structures show affiliation with Central Yucatecan architecture (Chenes, Rio Bec, and Puuc). During the Late Post- classic in the Lobil phase there seems to have been resettlement and extensive architectural remodeling which overlies Late Classic buildings at many sites. The final survey report is now in preparation. Irwin Rovner (Northwestern) and Stephen Ferguson (Western Michigan) are analyzing obsidian from the Rio Bec sites of Becan and Chicannd by X-ray fluorescence. Preliminary results on Preclassic to Postclassic material support contentions developed from previous analysis of the total lithic assemblage. The sparse Preclassic obsidian is split between Mexico, probably Guadalupe Victoria, and Guatemala, prob- ably Ixtepeque. With the initiation of the Early Classic Period (which sees the completion of the Becan ditch-and-parapet fortifications), obsidian importation reaches a peak, and virtually all of it is Mexican, mainly from Guadalupe Victoria with a small per- centage of Pachuca green obsidian from Teotihuacan. Mexican obsidian dominates the rest of the sequence, with Guatemalan obsidian, mostly from Ixtepeque, occurring at specific times in limited contexts. The investigators view Becan as having been located on a frontier of a Maya sphere which was oriented toward the northern lowlands and the Gulf coast region, at least with respect to obsidian and other lithic trade. Material from the south, both obsidian and basalt, and cherts and granite from Belize, appear to intrude on the normal flow of Mexican imports. Interestingly, Guatemalan and Belize lithics appear in substantial quantity only in the Postclassic period, with the exception of the Preclassic. Final project conclusions await further calibration of results with source obsidians. J. D. Eaton and R. E. W. Adams (Texas-San Antonio) conducted fieldwork in 1975 for the Yucatan Salt Project, an ethnographic and archaeolog- ical study of salt production at San Crisanto on the north coast of Yucatan. Salt is produced today by solar evaporation at a large salt lagoon, and has been recorded since colonial times. Archaeological remains along the older, inland side of the lagoon suggest a long tradition of such specialization. The modern community and its immediate environment were mapped, and interviews provided data on production, collection, and marketing of salt. Salt can be collected on the coast all year, but there is a peak harvest at the end of the dry season. The neighboring archaeological zone was surveyed, test-pitted, and mapped. Two sites form small islands in the lagoon. The westernmost is composed of several low platforms, of both circular</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH 277 and rectangular form; pottery was Late Formative and Early Classic in date. About 1.5 km east lies a second site with remains of masonry structures forming a small public center, apparently dating to the Early Classic. Extending between the sites and beyond in both directions are many small platforms lined with upended slabs forming enclosures. These are inter- preted as ancient salt storage platforms. There is some evidence of connecting stepping-stone walkways. The salt industry at San Crisanto is one of many similar sites along the north coast of Yucatan noted during a previous archaeological survey by Eaton. Although there is evidence for coastal occupation (most notably at salt lagoons) from possibly the Middle Formative to the present, the largest number of sites tested were Late Formative and Early Classic. This might suggest that sometime before the Late Classic Period permanent settlement and civic-religious direction were largely shifted to interior sites. During 1976-77 David Webster (Pennsylvania State) will undertake excavations at three apparently fortified Maya centers in northern Yucatan, Chacchob, Cuca, and Dzonatak6. The NSF sponsored fieldwork will examine elements of what are thought to be defensive structures in order to test this functional interpretation, facilitate reconstruction, and give them a temporal placement. BELIZE. A Royal Ontario Museum project at the Lamanai (Indian Church) site in Belize, directed by David M. Pendergast, began fieldwork in 1974. Col- laborators include H. Stanley Loten (Carleton, Ottawa) in architectural and environmental studies and Herman Hellmuth (Trent) in physical anthro- pology. Lamanai was chosen for investigation because of continuity of occupation from Spanish contact times back into the Late Postclassic, which has so far been the principal target in fieldwork. The large ceramic collection has affinities with the Mayapan ceramic tradition. Lamanai appears to have undergone major development during the Postclassic while neigh- boring centers declined. The site map, which covers 2 approximately 16 km , was completed in 1976 and will be published in the first volume of the site report. 1976 excavations probed Classic Period architecture apparently dating to the fifth and sixth centuries A.D. Some sherd collections are Late Preclassic but no structures from that time have yet been identified. The Rio Hondo Project in northern Belize under Dennis E. Puleston (Minnesota) and Alfred E. Siemens (British Columbia) includes a number of cultural ecological studies. The investigators have conducted intensive surface and aerial survey along the river floodplain, in part directed toward raised fields and canals. Excavations and paleo-ecological studies of fields, canals, and the underlying floodplain peats were carried out on Albion Island in the Rio Hondo with assistance from John P. Bradbury (Minnesota). In 1974 an experimental raised field with canals was constructed; it is presently being used for agricultural studies. Settlement pattern survey by Bruce Dahlin (Catholic) randomly test-pitted house structures. It appears that prehistoric settlement densities during Classic times were at levels equivalent to those around Tikal. Raised field platforms were constructed out of limestone marl transported from the uplands, an investment apparently justified by their potential for permanent cultivation. Pollen analysis indicates that maize and cotton were important field cultigens. C-14 dating places use of the canal-field system back before 1000 B.C., with maize pollen occurring in adjacent lake sediments dated to approximately 1800 B.C. The project also includes complementary ethnographic studies of local hunting techniques by Mary Pohl (Harvard), of modern diet in relation to modes of production by Claire Cassidy and Olga Stavrakis- Puleston (Minnesota), and of the economics of village pig rearing by Marion Marshall (Minnesota), plus botanical surveys by Philip Leino and Barbara Coffin (Minnesota). At Cerros, on the coast of Chetumal Bay, Corozal district, Belize, David Freidel (Southern Methodist) has directed field investigations in 1974-76, assisted by Maynard B. Cliff (Southern Methodist) and Robin A. Robertson (Harvard). Cerros is a major Maya center with about 5 ha of monumental public architecture plus associated settlement. Major construction and occupation occurred in the Late Preclassic (300 B.C.-A.D. 150) with casual reuse of major mounds during the Early Classic (around A.D. 250-600) and a minor reoccupation during the Late Postclassic (A.D. 1250-1500). The first two seasons of work emphasized exploratory test pits. The third season concentrated (1) on horizontal exposure in a rich, extensive midden underlying the main plaza, (2) on partial clearing of a central substructure dated to the Late Preclassic, and (3) on partial clearing of the main pyramidal substruc- ture at the site, also tentatively dated to the Late Preclassic. Partial restoration of the main precinct is one goal of the project, which is also expected to clarify variability in the heretofore "homogeneous" Chicanel ceramic sphere. Analysis of burials (20 to date) will provide information on mortuary practices, nutrition, and disease. Faunal and floral remains will provide information on subsistence practices at a major center located in an estuary environment. Anal- ysis of trading patterns will be another major facet of the research. Investigations to date reveal the Late Pre- classic presence of vaulted substructural chambers, polychrome stucco facades, massive architecture, lux- ury exotics including carved jade, shell, volcanic hema- tite, and obsidian. There is thus similarity with the accouterments of civilization found in contemporane- ous deposits in the Peten. Placement of Cerros in a Late Preclassic "horizon" calls into question for Frei- del the diffusion of Maya culture out of the central Peten to peripheral areas during the Late Preclassic. Alternatives are (1) diffusion during Middle Preclassic times, with the Late Preclassic representing a period of consolidation analogous to that witnessed in Early Classic times, or (2) the innovation of Maya high cul- ture through the interaction of polities throughout the southern lowlands during Middle and Late Preclassic times (i.e., a diffusion model versus an interaction sphere model). The site of Colha in northern Belize was surveyed and surface collected preliminarily by Richard Wilk (Arizona) as a prelude to more intensive work being planned with other archaeologists. Colha is the largest lithic manufacturing and quarrying site known in the Maya lowlands; a small ceremonial center constructed</page><page sequence="7">278 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 1977] largely of chert nodules is surrounded by tens of square kilometers of chert workshop mounds, raised causeways, and enigmatic complexes of mounds and walls. In 1975 a team of members of the Corozal Project, directed by Norman Hammond, conducted a brief reconnaissance at the newly discovered site of Nimli Punit near Lubaantun in southern Belize, in conjunction with the Belizean government. The site is a relatively small ceremonial center, but has produced 28 stelae in the main plaza alone. Legible dates on three stelae fall into the eighth century A.D.(GMT). Subsequently Richard Wilk test excavated at the site to obtain a ceramic sequence. In 1976 Norman Hammond (Bradford, England) and Thomas R. Hester (Texas-San Antonio) co-chaired a conference on Maya lithic technology and production processes in Orange Walk Town, Belize. The symposium was sponsored by the Center for Archaeological Research at Texas-San Antonio, which plans to publish the papers. GUATEMALA. In 1975 and 1976 the Quirigua Project with William R. Coe as project director and Robert J. Sharer as field director completed the first half of the planned fieldwork. NSF, the National Geographic Society, and the Ford Foundation have contributed to the investigation of Quirigua and its environs in the lower Motagua Valley, Izabal, Guatemala, in a cooperative program with the I.N.A.H. of Guatemala. The project will explore the local role of the center and its relationships to the presumed heavy volume of trade traversing the Motagua from the highlands to the Caribbean. A new map of the site core (75 acres) is underway, and deep trenches have been placed through architectural features. The Guatemalan government is managing the subsequent consolidation and restoration of buildings. In the site periphery (100 km2 ) reconnaissance, survey, and limited excavations have been undertaken to date. Special techniques include aerial survey, magnetometer survey, and core-drilling. Artifactual analyses and monument studies are other facets of the project. Occupation at Quirigua seems to have been late, falling between A.D. 800-1000. The magneto- meter traced a buried causeway that appears to connect the series of presumably elite structures which run in an E-W line north of the site core. Beyond these structures peripheral settlement is generally located on raised ground, adjacent to water sources and modern routes of communication. The largest peripheral clusters are at the greatest distance from the core and tend to be regularly spaced. There is Late Preclassic and Protoclassic occupation in the peripheries, but its distribution and the reason(s) for the Early Classic hiatus are unknown. Survey in the rest of the valley documents the presence of a number of earlier and contemporary elite centers which lack the stone monuments found at Quirigua. At Quirigua lack of polychrome pottery suggests disrupted ties with Copan, which is also attested to epigraphically. Domestic wares, however, are virtually indistinguish- able from those at Copan. Within the Quirigua area there is evidence of differential distribution of ceramic forms in areas of elite residences and public architecture versus residential locations of lesser status. Since 1972 an NSF ecological project in the central Peten lakes region under Edward S. Deevey (Florida State Museum) has attempted to integrate geo- chemical, biological, and settlement studies to explore factors important to Maya land-use and sociopolitical evolution. The goals of the investigations are to search the sedimentary record for evidence of Maya land use, to evaluate the basin-wise budgets of water, carbon, and major cations and anaions, both at present and (by inference from chemical paleolimnology) as they were modified by Maya exploitation. Project person- nel took cores from Lakes Quexil, Salpeten, and Yaxhi in 1972 and from Lake Sacnab in 1974. The limnological, hydrological, and biological studies were coordinated with an archaeological settlement survey of the Yaxha-Sacnab basin in 1973-74, which provided data on the characteristics, timing, and location of Maya occupation. The archaeological fieldwork involved survey, test-pit excavation, and data analysis directed by Don S. Rice (Florida State Museum) and Prudence M. Rice (Florida). An analysis of vegetation stands within the Yaxha-Sacnab region was conducted by Don Rice, John Ewel, and Ron Myers (Florida) for the purpose of characterizing present topographic and agronomic structures and to obtain gross measures of relative productivity. While data analysis is continuing for all phases of the project, comparative information is currently being collected by Don Rice and Mark Brenner (Florida), who obtained limnological data in 1976 on seven of the lakes. Borings are planned for Lakes Macanche, Sacpuy, and Perdida in 1977. John Ewel and Don Rice are extending their vegetation analyses to the other lake basins by way of ground-truth surveys and ERTS/LANDSAT image analyses made possible by a facilities-use grant from the Applications Projects Branch of NASA at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Pru Rice is currently undertaking analysis of the artifacts from William Bullard's excavations at Lake Macanche and plans are underway for comparative settlement surveys in this and three other lake basins. Prudence M. Rice has recently completed tech- nological analyses of some "whiteware" pottery from Kaminaljuyu and the Valley of Guatemala. "White" paste pottery, defined as having a paste color ranging through white to very pale brown, is manufactured today in communities north of the Valley of Guatemala (Chinautla, Sacojito, Durazno) and appears in the archaeological record of the valley as early as 1000 to 500 B.C. The analyses investigated the antiquity of use of these contemporary resources in the valley and explored craft specialization, produc- tion, and distribution of archaeological pottery through technological indicators. Analytical methods used for characterizing the raw materials and fired pottery included: observation and measurement of physical properties (texture, color, hardness, etc.), petrography, granulometry, and neutron activation. The results suggest that during the Formative Period 1000 B.C. to A.D. 200, there was increasingly specialized production of particular formal classes of pottery (labial flange bowls, cuspidor vessels, and composite silhouette bowls) using clays from the northern valley and from an unknown source (believed to be in Sacatepequez, to the west). After the Formative Period whitewares declined in frequency,</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH 279 but Postclassic pottery appears close in many properties to the contemporary pottery and clay source of Chinautla. Rice considers that occupational specialization began early in the valley, co-evolving with stratification and sociopolitical complexity (evident at Kaminaljuyu) rather than as a response to "population pressure." Technological analysis of pottery provided a useful means of exploring questions of ceramic craft specialization over and above the traditional indicators, such as stylistic homogeneity or "mass production." John A. Graham (UCB) directed a preliminary field season in 1976 to investigate the site of Abaj Takalik, Retalhuleu, Guatemala. R. F. Heizer and E. M. Shook are collaborators in this project sponsored by the National Geographic Society and other sources. The explorations assessed the feasibility of additional work at the site to understand Maya, Izapa, and Olmec relationships. Stone monuments were discovered bearing early Maya inscriptions and carved in a style antecedent to Classic Maya art of the southern lowlands. The newly discovered Stela 5 is inscribed with two Initial Series dates, the latest of which is A.D. 126. Study of the damaged text on St. 2 leads to placement of it no later than the epoch of Tres Zapotes St. C and Chiapa de Corzo St. 2, and possibly earlier. A radiocarbon date supports this reconstruc- tion. Compared to monuments at the nearby site of Izapa, those at Abaj Takalik dating to the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic differ in subject matter, figural costuming, hieroglyphic texts, and artistic canons. On this basis, the investigators question the notion of Izapan ancestry for early Maya art and feel that the question of the locus of origin of Maya civilization will be reopened. Olmec style monuments were also discovered at Abaj Takalik, although their age and relationships to the Maya occupation remain to be examined during the planned 1977 field season. HONDURAS. The Naco Valley in northwestern Honduras is the focus of a Cornell University project directed by John Henderson. Prehispanic exchange systems will be a principal topic of investigation because the Spaniards found a thriving commercial center at Naco engaged in maritime trade. The project will address not only long-distance trade, but also intra-valley procurement, production, and distribu- tion. Preliminary work in 1975 was mainly survey, with test excavations and mapping at two sites. At Naco itself, which originally occupied more than 75 ha, most mounds are low and probably supported domestic structures. Profiles were cleaned and recorded at several looters' pits. Pottery predominant- ly resembled that from the Late Postclassic in the Guatemalan highlands. Obsidian was plentiful, with evidence of obsidian working of imported raw material. Eighteen additional sites have been located in the valley, mostly small clusters of 5 to 50 mounds ranging up to 3 m high. One La Sierra, is large, covering more than 100 ha; there to date the project has mapped over 400 mounds. In the site center is a zone of large, stone-faced substructures up to 8 m high, covering more than 5 ha. Three test pits beside stream cuts in the northern part of La Sierra revealed stratified deposits more than 4 m deep. The site's occupation spans the Classic Period, with an apparent peak in the Late Classic. Polychrome pottery suggests wide-ranging external connections. An NSF supported, prehistoric settlement pattern study of the Copan Valley, Honduras, was begun by Peabody Museum in 1976 under the direction of Gordon R. Willey, assisted by Richard M. Leventhal (Harvard). The project will gather basic settlement data on the "sustaining area" surrounding the Copan center. Ecological, economic, and sociopolitical organization are subjects of investigation. During the first season detailed maps were made of outlying ruin groups on the valley floor east of the main center. Some mapping was initiated at other ruin locations at somewhat higher elevations in the valley. One medium-sized (seven-mound), apparently residential unit was excavated in great detail; ceramics indicate construction at around A.D. 600 and occupation through most of the Late Classic. It is hoped that the Harvard project will be integrated with a long-term program at Copan now being planned by the Honduran government. Paul F. Healy (Trent) directed the third and final season of a National Geographic Society sponsored archaeological project in northeastern Honduras. The project has surveyed sites in the Aguan river valley in Colon to obtain data on cultural contact along a Mesoamerican "frontier" zone. 1976 fieldwork con- centrated on a large (around 150-300 m in extent), well-preserved, Selin Period (A.D. 600-900) settlement located near Trujillo. The site includes over 20 earth and earth-and-shell mounds from 1-6 m high scattered in a disorderly fashion about one km from the south shore of Guaimoreto Lagoon. Five test excavations produced ceramics dating most of the site occupation to the Selin Period. Decorated trade sherds from the Ulua Valley were included in the inventory. Pre-Selin occupation also occurs at the site, and one excavation revealed a transition from Late Selin to Early Cocal ceramics. Carbon samples, obsidian, and faunal remains will be analyzed in the near future. EL SALVADOR. Payson D. Sheets (Colorado) conducted a pilot project sponsored by NSF to determine if a large-scale volcanic disaster occurred about the time of Christ in the El Salvador highlands. Archaeological and geological samples were taken from a 95 km E-W transect in 1975. Analysis by Ginger Steen-McIntyre (U.S.G.S.) in 1976 indicates a three-component eruption of two ashflows and a massive ashfall, probably from Ilopango volcano. Preliminary estimates indicate over 3,000 km2 rendered uninhabitable by the acid ash. Numerous Protoclassic villages were buried by volcanic ash. The sudden arrival of Protoclassic artifacts as "site-unit intrusions" at numerous lowland Maya sites may be explained by this disaster. Evidently the southeastern highlands were reoccupied about 200 years later by Classic Maya from the Copan area after chemical and mechanical weathering had produced satisfactory agricultural soil. At Jayaque, in La Libertad, El Salvador, 32 stratigraphic pits and surface collections were part of a rescue operation in 1973 by Luis Casasola G. (Centro de Estudios Mayas, U.N.A.M.) sponsored by the Museo Nacional "David J. Guzman" in El Salvador. Analyses are expected to result in a final report in</page><page sequence="9">280 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 1977] 1976. Pottery bears resemblances to that from Chalchuapa and to a lesser extent Kaminaljuyu; occupation at the site falls between 700 and 200 B.C. Internal and external relationships of the site are the focus of Casosola's interpretations. AGENCIES. Eduardo Matos M., now head of Monumentos Prehispanicos, I.N.A.H., reports a re- orientation of that department's salvage activities from straightforward data recovery to planned problem investigation. Recent examples are connected with the Tomatlan Dam in Jalisco (directed by J. Mountjoy), the "Chicayan" Dam near Panuco, Veracruz (directed by R. Cabrera), and Cerro del Oro Dam between Veracruz and Oaxaca (directed by A. Pefia), and the Chicoas6n Dam in Chiapas (directed by A. Martinez). An Institute for Mesoamerican Studies has been formed at SUNY Albany. The institute will sponsor a multidisciplinary project scheduled to begin in 1976, focused on the evolution of Quich6 culture and directed by Robert Carmack, Lyle Campbell (SUNY Albany), and Kenneth Brown (East Carolina). Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and linguistic research will be included. Other institute research by a variety of students and scholars is directed at ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and epigraphic topics. For example, Peter T. Furst and Jill Leslie Furst have begun such studies in the Apoala region in the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca. BARBARA L. STARK WESTERN AND NORTHERN MEXICO JALISCO. Phil C. Weigand (SUNY Stony Brook) continues survey in the highland lake valleys west of Guadalajara. He has located 512 sites, six obsidian quarries, two copper mines, and many areas of chinampas. Currently investigation is focused on a site pattern characterized by circular pyramids surrounded by circular patios, which in turn are surrounded with circular banquettes surmounted by 8 to 12 rectangular platforms. This settlement type, which began in the Late Formative and peaked in the Late Classic, is represented at Teuchitlan, Providencia, Ahualulco, and Tala. Teuchitlan is the largest, most complex of these; it covers over 8 mi2 and includes extensive terracing, irrigation, obsidian quarries and workshops, 16 circular complexes (with up to 6 banquettes), ball courts, and at least 1,000 platform compounds. Urbanization may have been underway. Garmon Harbottle, Edward Sayre (Brookhaven National Laboratory), and Weigand are comparing artifacts of turquoise and other copper-bearing minerals with source areas by neutron activation. The goal of this project is to quantify the trade for these rare resources within ancient Mesoamerica, the American Southwest, and across the Plains, and to offer conclusions on the economics of long-distance trade. In 1976 archaeological salvage for I.N.A.H. in the Tomatlan river basin of coastal Jalisco was directed by Joseph B. Mountjoy (North Carolina) assisted by Mario Antonio Perez C., Patricia Monsivais G. (Escuela Nacional de Antropologfa, I.N.A.H.), and Steve Webb (Tennessee). Fieldwork was first directed at 2,000 ha of floodbasin until that area was inundated. Then laboratory work began along with testing of a site in the 20,000 ha irrigation zone. Floodbasin work was in paleoethnography of contact period peoples. The project mapped 43 Postclassic habitation sites which manifest a riverine adaptation. One hundred petroglyphs and one pictograph were recovered and three habitation sites were excavated. Analysis is presently concentrated on house floor artifact distributions, 15 burials, typology and composition of 179 metal artifacts, and radiocarbon dates. Mountjoy reports that the work promises to give detailed information on Pacific coast peoples only sketchily described in ethnohistoric records plus insights into the "Mesoamericanization" of West Mexico. The irrigation zone site was test trenched, revealing superimposed hearths, rich midden deposits, and burials. Much of the material is similar to Early Morett in Colima and promises to contribute to our understanding of Formative period adaptation in West Mexico. SONORA. Thomas Bowen (CSU Fresno) and Richard S. White, Jr. (Centro Regional del Noroeste, I.N.A.H.) conducted a survey of northern Tibur6n Island in 1976. Because of the lack of previous work, the survey was exploratory. Nevertheless, it was oriented to certain goals: (1) investigation of a reported Paleoindian site, (2) evaluation of whether geochemical alteration of lithic material can serve on Tibur6n as a relative dating device (apparently not), (3) identification of historic Seri remains (several historic Seri sites were located), and (4) assessment of survey methods involving no collecting or other site disturbance. The survey clearly demonstrated that many but not all archaeological problems can be addressed effectively through surveys that eschew collecting. Among the unanticipated discoveries were two distinct lithic complexes that appear to correlate with Seri oral traditions of band movement on the island. Future fieldwork is expected to attempt band identification and assessment of oral history with archaeological data. The Rio San Miguel area has been the focus of survey and excavations by Beatriz Braniff C. (Centro Regional del Noroeste, I.N.A.H.). Sites are plentiful, with remains of rectangular houses which are sometimes contiguous. Diagnostic, and possibly intrusive, pottery is affiliated with the "Trincheras" area of the Rfo Altar-Concepci6n to the north. Tentative dates are A.D. 800-1200. Richard Pailes (Oklahoma) has been investigating parts of the Sonora piedmont area, which has remains of the "Rio Sonora culture." In 1975 an intensive survey was conducted from Baviacora to Aconchi along the Rfo Sonora. Throughout the survey area incised and punched pottery was frequent along with Chihuahua polychromes, suggesting a date post-A.D. 1060. In 1976 rectangular and pit houses were excavated in the San Jos6 Baviacora site. Fossil pollen records were obtained in direct association with prehistoric use surfaces and fill deposits. Palynological studies by James Schoenwetter (Arizona State) suggest that a pollen chronology will result. TAMAULIPAS, NUEVO LEON. Joel Shiner (Southern Methodist) surveyed the valley of the Sota</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH 281 La Marina-Purificaci6n river inland about 50 km from where McNeish and Ekholm found Huasteca sites on the coast. This river is believed to be the line between the farming Mesoamericans and the scavenging North Americans. The area shows no evidence of permanent villages, but, rather, stone and ceramic assemblages of short-term camps, probably Huasteca. Hunter-gatherer sites are north of the river valley and continue to central Texas. COAHUILA. In 1975 and 1976 the field segment of the NEH supported Project Gateway was completed at Guerrero, about 35 mi down the Rio Grande from the Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras crossing. R. E. W. Adams directs this archaeological and ethnohistorical project, with collaboration by T. R. Hester, J. D. Eaton, T. C. Greaves, and F. D. Almarez (Texas-San Antonio). Excavations were directed at the San Juan Bautista and San Bernardo missions, founded in 1700 and 1702, respectively; survey was conducted for 60 km and 10 km inland on either side of the river. About 200 prehistoric sites have been surficially examined, and the regional sequence may extend back as far as 6000 B.C. Laboratory analysis and historic research continue in order to develop a prehistoric and historic regional framework for artifactual, settlement, and economic shifts. Excavation data bearing on these objectives seems promising. Indian quarters, work- shops, kitchen areas, kilns, churches, streets, fortifica- tions, and priests' quarters were located, mapped, and excavated. Artifacts and a relatively large faunal collection are undergoing analysis. BARBARA L. STARK LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA Recent work has concentrated on the analysis of material recovered in earlier projects, salvage and preliminary excavations, and surface surveys. Most investigators have gone beyond the establishment of ceramic sequences to field strategies with a broader theoretical base. It is becoming increasingly apparent that much of Lower Central America is a unique adaptation zone that repudiates adjectives such as "intermediate" and "marginal." One possible and another certain Paleoindian deposit have been located and will be investigated more completely in the near future. A large number of foreign experts were invited to review the evidence for man's activities at the Late Pleistocene El Bosque site. It was a welcome and courageous experiment by Jorge Espinosa which should be repeated: too often the acceptance or rejection of controversial Pleistocene material is attributed to "national" attitudes, which is quite absurd. It was refreshing to see people of contradictory opinions discussing details at the very site of operations. Field projects in the Atlantic watershed indicate that the sometimes deterministic rejections of the Caribbean slopes as being of limited human carrying capacity are too simplistic. In Costa Rica, complex sites-with "empty plazas," underground architecture, artificial mounds, and extensive stone "calzadas"- point to a societal level which in some areas equates with that of the Pacific coastal lowlands. This new evidence may engender a reconsideration of some of the more unilinear approaches to Tropical subsistence. In answer to the declarations of the "Primer Congreso de Antropologia y de la Defensa del Patrimonio Cultural de la Am6rica Central" (San Jos6, July 1975), Sr. Luis Ferrero (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica) formally returned a fine Tonosi Group double-jar to the Patrimonio Hist6rico de Panama at the Primer Congreso de Antropologia de Panama (October 1976). NICARAGUA. Jorge Espinosa (Instituto Geografico Nacional) convened the "Primer Simposium Mundial de Arqueologia Nicaragiiense" at Pueblo Nuevo, Esteli. Thirty-two specialists visited the open excavations at the El Bosque site where a Late Pleistocene lacustrine deposit contains a varied fauna, including the most northerly occurrence of Toxodon recorded to date. They witnessed the removal of stone material which had been left in situ, close to the faunal remains. Though acceptance of this material as being of human manufacture varied according to the intellectual persuasions of the individual participants, it was agreed that El Bosque is a valuable site that should be studied more completely. The possibility of locating more definite evidence of human interference with a 30,000-year old fauna will make the future excavations all the more interesting. Richard Magnus (Banco Central de Nicaragua), reports continuing fieldwork along the Atlantic coast with an emphasis on prehistoric cultural ecology. Newly found inland sites strengthen the hypothesis that coastal localities were the seasonal fishing stations of a predominantly agricultural population. A preliminary analysis of faunal remains from the lagoon-shore Kukra Point site, suggests an exploitation of resources which falls short of the subsistence potential of the surrounding area: fish genera are those which can be caught at the river-bank (Arius, Bagre, Batrachoides, Centropomus, Micropogon, and others) but surprisingly little turtle was being consumed. In contrast, the Italia site, about 10 km inland from Kukra Point, has a far greater abundance of faunal materials. Though the same genera of fish are represented, harvesting seems to have been more selective, with Batrachoides and Epinephelus the most favoured genera. Kinosternon turtles seem to have been consumed in some numbers and mammals were also hunted more intensively. In Chontales, Magnus excavated a site with a new ceramic complex which appears to link the coastal Siteia Complex to the Zoned Bichromes (300 B.C.-A.D. 300) of Greater Nicoya. The implication is that during the Late Formative, all of Nicaragua was to a certain degree culturally homogeneous. COSTA RICA. Frederick Lange (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica), reports on excavations along the Bay of Culebra, Guanacaste. At one coastal site, the bottom-most level of a 4.8 m deep trench, revealed a ceramic zone clearly stratified beneath well-known Zoned Bichrome types. The same excavations showed that marine molluscs were intensively utilized during the Early Polychrome period (A.D. 500-800). A preliminary examination of these ceramics suggests that it will be necessary to revert to the original Coe/Baudez classification-into Early Polychrome "A"</page><page sequence="11">282 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 and "B"-eliminating the "Linear Decorated" period. At another site further inland, Lange reports finding a mold used for casting gold. The object cast was a typical "Costa Rica-Chiriqui" frog, with expanded back legs and a double face-volute. Ninety-three percent of the sherds recovered at this site belong to the Late Polychrome (A.D. 1200-1500). Lange hopes to expand excavations to determine whether gold- working was a major activity in Guanacaste which has never been considered a primary area of production. This find suggests once again that the typical Lower Central American "styles" may have been manu- factured over a very wide area and that the stylistic differences often attributed to locality ("Diquis," "Veraguas," "Cocl6") may be, at least in part, chronological. Gold frogs similar to Lange's example have been recovered in Cocl6 at El Cafio, in direct association with Colonial artifacts (R. G. Cooke, "Rescate arqueol6gico en El Cafio [NA-20], Cocl6, Panama," Actas del IV Simp. de Antro., Panama, 1976). Laura Laurenchic Minelli (Instituto de Anitro- pologia, Bologna) has been excavating Zoned Bichrome deposits on the Nicoya Peninsula. At the Barrahonda site a date of 3400?1000 radiocarbon years: 1450 B.C. (no lab. number) was associated with an "intermediate layer." This figure seems too old for the Zoned Bichrome Horizon but it may indicate that Zoned Bichromes were being manufactured before the hitherto accepted date of 300 B.C. At a nearby site, a date of 8230?1000 radiocarbon years: 6280 B.C. (no lab. number) was associated with a lense of lithic workshop debris, which may predate the Zoned Bichrome deposit with which it was ultimately mixed as re-used material. Carlos Aguilar (Laboratorio de Arqueologia de la Universidad de Costa Rica) reports on four sites investigated during the field project: "Secuencias Culturales en el Intermonano Central." At the Tatiscu Site (Cant6n de Oreamuno, Prov. de Cartago) stratigraphic cuts placed amidst "huaquero" excava- tions, revealed a sequence comprising the three previously defined phases for the Central Inter- montane Area: Pavas (330 B.C.-400 A.D.); Curridabat (A.D. 400-850), and Cartago (A.D. 850-1500). The Curridabat Phase deposit provided the most complete information, including offerings of tripod-vessels and a "Cocl6" style "maracas-player" copper effigy. This last find would appear to substantiate the relative dating of these figurines in Central Panama, where it is calculated that the major Sitio Conte burials date between A.D. 400 and 900 (see Cooke, Actas del IV. Simp. Antro., p. 317, Panama, 1976). Carbon samples recovered at Tatiscu gave recent dates and were presumably contaminated. At the Vaildeperas site, stratigraphic pits contained Pavas phase material. A partially excavated structure seems to represent a sculpted phallus placed in the center of a stone pile. Material directly beneath a stone-walled construction of the Pavas phase at the Alvarado site, near Volcan Irazui, has been dated to 1605?160 radiocarbon years: A.D. 345 (I 9493). At the Cedros Site, near the University Campus, profiles exposed by a construction trench revealed a layer of volcanic ash overlying a spring deposit. Organic d6tritus, representing vegetation growing at the time of the eruption, was dated to 1325?80 radiocarbon years: A.D. 625 (I 8010). Unfortunately the cultural material associated with the date is difficult to place typologically although there was a figurine with a conical cap, typical of the northern plains. Sherds found in the vicinity were of the Curridabat Phase. Michael Snarskis (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica and Columbia University) has been analysing an extensive lithic collection from the Atlantic water- shed. Fifteen whole and fragmentary fluted points have been recovered. Some of these are morphological- ly similar to the Clovis-like examples recovered earlier in Costa Rica and Guatemala (Handbook of Middle American Indians, 1964, Vol. 1, p. 389, fig. 3a, d). Snarskis, in company with Lange and H6ctor Gamboa (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica), are also excavating at Site-20, Linea Vieja, where a complex, domestic-cum- ceremonial center has recently been revealed. So far they have uncovered a number of paved "calzadas" leading to a central "empty plaza," which is surrounded by a sequentially used crypt structure, tombs, and mounds. William J. Kennedy (Florida Atlantic), conducted field research during spring 1976 in the Reventaz6n valley. Excavations were conducted at the Torito and Najera sites and surface collections were made at sites excavated previously. Preliminary analysis of the data confirms earlier findings (see W. J. Kennedy, "Archae- ological Investigation in the Reventaz6n River Drainage Area, Costa Rica." Ph.D. thesis, Tulane University, 1968), that Torito is a single-component site of the Early Period (300 B.C.-A.D. 400) roughly coeval with the Zoned Bichrome Period in adjacent regions. Ceramic wares belonging to the El Bosque complex of Snarskis (American Antiquity 41[3], 1976), comprise the bulk of the artifact assemblage. Kennedy also undertook an analytical study of a Middle period Lithic assemblage from Monte Cristo, a site excavated in 1966. PANAMA. Olga Linares and Antony Ranere (Smithsonian Institute for Tropical Research and Temple University) are completing the Chiriqui-Bocas del Toro project, while Richard G. Cooke (Smith- sonian Institute of Tropical Research) is continuing analysis of materials from Sitio Sierra (A.D. 150-500). Raul Gonzalez and Marcia Arosemena de Arosemena (Patrimonio Hist6rico del I.N.A.C.), conducted brief salvage excavations at La India, Tonosi, a site previously excavated by Alain Ichon ("L'arch6ologie du Sud de la Peninsule d'Azuero, Panama." Doctoral thesis, Universit6 de Paris, 1974). A small number of flexed burials were excavated, belonging to the end of Phase IV of the Central Region sequence (A.D. 150-500) (R.G. Cooke, "Panama: Regi6n Central." In Vinculos 3, San Jose, 1976). The Patrimonio Hist6rico is restoring-for possible use as an archaeological park-the so-called "Temple Site," El Cafio, Cocle, in- vestigated by A. Hyatt Verrill, in the 1920s. Gold pieces and El Hatillo Group vessels recovered from excavations in a large artificial mound, adjacent to the "temple" corroborated the late date for these struc- tures (see Current Research 40:240).

At the Casita de Piedra site, dates of 4085?75 radiocarbon years: 2135 B.C. (SI 1845) and 2890?70 radiocarbon years: 940 B.C. (SI 1844) were associated with the Boquete Phase. At the nearby Trapiche Shel- ter, materials of the earlier Talamanca phase were asso- ciated with dates of 4685?85: 2735 radiocarbon years (SI 1848) and 3870?75 radiocarbon years: 1920 B.C. (SI 1847). Though the dates for the two phases overlap slightly, the sequence originally suggested by Ranere has been substantiated. Ranere now believes that the division between the two phases (which probably represents the beginnings of root- and tree-crop agriculture) should be shifted from 3000 to 2200 B.C. At the El Trapiche site, the latest preceramic deposit gave a reading of 2200?75 radiocarbon years: 350 B.C. (SI 1846), which suggests that ceramics were introduced much later to the western Highlands than to the central coast. At Monagrillo, excavated by Ranere, McCarty, and others in 1975 (see Current Research 41:225, 1976) the first of a stratified series of radiocarbon samples has given a date of 3325?85 radiocarbon years: 1375 B.C. (I 9384), which is somewhat later than the 1952 date of 4090?70 radiocarbon years: 2140 B.C. (Y-585). The complete series should clarify the length of occupation of this important coastal site. In August 1976 Mr. Charles Bennett, a local collector, picked up another fluted point with "fish-tail" affiliations, at San Juan, north of the Rio Chagres, on the eroded shores of Lake Madden. It is the only complete example known from Panama and brings the total for the Canal Zone area to six "fish-tail" and two "Clovis-like." Bird observes that the ears of the stem do not flare as much as in some Fell's Cave examples and further discoveries may validate a Panamanian subgroup of this kind of artifact. A search is being made for in situ deposits in the same locality. In May-June 1976 Jos6 Cruxent and geologists from the Instituto Geografico "Tommy Guardia" located and mapped minutely a sequence of possible Pleistocene river terraces near Agua Buena, Col6n. Tools found in apparent association with these land forms are in the editor's opinion typical of the Panamanian preceramic in general. We await further reports and hope that notice is taken of Jorge Espinosa's example. R. G. COOKE CARIBBEAN PUERTO RICO. Excavations from June to November 1975 at the Tierras Nuevas site, discovered by amateur archaeologists at the mouth of the Manati River on the north-central coast, were directed by Ovidio Davila (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture) under the sponsorship of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico. He found four ceremonial ball-courts near the shore line and evidence of more than 800 years of occupation as determined by radiocarbon dates. Historical docu- ments as well as archaeological evidence, including two Spanish coins minted in Santo Domingo in 1505, suggest that the site was visited by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1508 on his voyage to conquer and colonize Puerto Rico. This is one of the few sites in the West Indies where there is both archaeological and historical evidence of Indo-Hispanic contact. In the Vega Baja Region, Davila discovered a cave containing nine zoomorphic and abstract pictographs painted in red and black. Potsherds found on the floor of the cave belong to the Capa style, dating at about A.D. 1270. These are the first pictographs reported from Puerto Rico. Samples of the paint of the pictographs were collected for chemical analysis. One hundred twenty additional pictographs were discovered in caves explored by Davila in the Moravis Region. Most designs ,are anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, painted in black. Some motifs were both painted and engraved. No excavations were conducted. ST. KITTS. R. Christopher Goodwin (Arizona State) completed the second consecutive field season of excavation at the endangered Sugar Factory Pier site in August 1976 under the joint auspices of the Behavioral Sciences Foundation of the government of St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla. Test excavations in 1975 revealed a protracted habitation sequence, beginning with an early Saladoid occupation, considered to date from the first century A.D. It is characterized by inverted bell-shaped vessels decorated with white-on- red paint and with zoned-incised cross-hatching. The site appears to have been continuously occupied through the Terminal Saladoid period, a span of roughly 600 years. By the end of the Saladoid occupation white-on-red painting and zoned-incised cross-hatching were gone from the ceramic sub- assemblage. Statistical analysis of modes for pot thickness indicated a pronounced trend toward thicker, cruder ceramics during this period. While crab claws were diagnostic of the faunal assemblage in the early Saladoid levels, by the Terminal Saladoid these were virtually absent. Data indicate a dramatic diversification in dietary fauna to include such energy intensive, low protein yield species as the nerites. Six flexed burials were recovered from Terminal Saladoid contexts at the site. Three individuals evidenced Harris Lines in the long bones and/or intense neonatal lines in the anterior dentition, data further suggesting a breakdown in traditional subsistence techniques toward the close of the Saladoid Period. One female, aged at approximately 30 years, was found in situ with the articulated skeleton of an agouti (Dasyproctidae sp.). A preceramic, or Meso-Indian component was found at the Sugar Factory Pier site where the basal portion of a thick, sterile zone of volcanic tuff and ash (deposited during the Mansion Seires of eruptions of Mount Misery) interfaced with a silty loam indicative of a shallow lagoon environment. The bulk of this midden deposit was comprised of Anadara notabilis and Arca zebra shells. Although the Archaic deposit was floated, not a single vertebrate bone was recov- ered. Fire-hardened Strombus gigas shell celts, edge ground and edge battered cobbles, and a fragment of a cylindrical ground stone mano were</page><page sequence="13">284 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 excavated from the midden. The Meso-Indian midden is estimated to date from about 4000-3500 B.C. Restoration of the historic English fortress at Brimstone Hill was begun this year, under the directorship of Lloyd Matheson and Roland Humphrey. Sponsors are the Society for the Preservation of Brimstone Hill and the Department of Public Works of St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla. Major effort is being devoted to the preservation of parts of the fortress damaged during the earthquake of 1969. CHARLES A. HOFFMAN ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA PERU. Herbert H. Eling (Texas) completed his field study of the Jequetepeque Valley, through which he intends to establish the relationship of precolumbian hydraulic agriculture to the growth of urbanism. The physical relationships between canals, canal-related sites, roads, boundary and defensive walls, and urban complexes were mapped in detail. Eling also conducted test excavations and will use pollen analysis to establish crop patterns and relate furrow type to specific crops. Canal capacities, gradients, filtration rates, and construction techniques will be described in his report. Jean M. Dricot (San Marcos) has undertaken a multivariate analysis of prehistoric Peruvian cranial remains. He is also studying the human skeletal remains, recovered by Claude Chauchat, that are thought to be associated with the Paijan lithic complex. Explorations by Frederic Engel (Universidad Agraria) in the Cupisnique Canyon disclosed a new large encampment where thousands of chipped stone artifacts may be in association with the bones of Paleolama. From another site in this quebrada, Engel obtained a radiocarbon date of about 7500 B.C. on charcoal from refuse lying below the superficial sands and famous Paijanense industry. Crist6bal Campana Delgado (Trujillo) completed his examination of the sunken fields (huachaques or mahamaes) which have allowed farmers to take advantage of the high water table in the lower parts of most of the coastal valleys. In the Moche Valley Campana finds the first evidence of sunken fields in preceramic times; by the Formative period many huachaques were dug, contributing to a stable settlement pattern of villages supported by sunken fields and fishing. Eventually there were over 1000 hectares of sunken fields on the southwest side of the Moche Valley. Campana believes that the investment represented by these fields, yielding two maize harvests per year, largely explains the location of Chan Chan, as well, perhaps, as the entire North Coast process of increasing population and urbanization. Recent fieldwork by Michael West (Los Angeles County Museum) has concentrated on social, eco- nomic, political, and demographic aspects of Puerto Moorin-Salinar remains in the Virui Valley. Noting that significant regions of the valley could have been farmed without canal irrigation and that there was a considerable diversity of agricultural techniques, he postulates community autonomy in food production. There is also evidence of internal social stratification, specialization, and perhaps the formation of ruling elites. A political confederation may have united these communities, but West's ecological data imply that relations between groups were not predicated upon control of irrigation systems. The Puerto Moorin- Salinar period is characterized by rapid increases in population and greater contacts with outside zones. West feels that militarism solidification of social structure, and higher rates of energy production are also implied. Following upon the five successful Andean expeditions between 1958 and 1969, the University of Tokyo has sent another, headed by Kazuo Terada, to the highland Province of Corongo in the Department of Ancash. Staff participants in 1975 were Tamotsu Ogata, Hiroyasu Tomoeda, Tatsuhiko Fujii, Yasutake Kato, Tsuyoshi Ushino, and the Peruvians Isabel Flores and Justo Caceres. Most effort was spent on a semi-artificial mound at La Pampa, where Formative, Cajamarcoid, and Inca phases were recognized. In 1976 Fujii and Kato returned to Lima to work on the La Pampa collections and the catalog for the Museo Amano. Work was also begun at a monument consisting of concentric stone circles, probably dating to the Cajamarcoid period, and at the hill of Tornapampa where there are numerous chullpas. Terence Grieder (Texas) concluded his project at Pashash, an elite center of Recuay culture, in 1976 and the final report is to be published in 1977. With Alberto Bueno Mendoza (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) Grieder surveyed for sites in the Chuquicara Canyon, some 1100 m below Pashash, and in the neighborhood of the mining town of LaGalgada. In addition to the expected material of Pashash age (around A.D. 300-600) they found burials and structures running from preceramic to Inca times. Grieder finds the Pallasca preceramic burials and structures reminiscent of Basketmaker culture in the U.S. Southwest and plans to return for more work in 1978. Hernan Amat 0. (San Marcos) has elaborated a sequence for the Mosna Valley, based on survey, test excavations, and the major work at Chavin de Huantar between 1966 and 1974. The lithic stage is represented by Kanrash and Yuraj Machay, with industries similar to that at Quishqui Puncu on the other side of the Cordillera Blanca. The Initial Ceramic ware, Huantar, shows affinities with Las Aldas, but also with Toril in the Callej6n de Huaylas. The Formative now comprises seven phases, Rocas having been subdivided into three and Ofrendas into two, followed by Mosna and Raqu which show close similarities to the Cupisnique and Tembladera (Jequetepeque) wares of the coast. Huaraz White on Red has two phases. The Regional Development period is characterized by the Recuay culture, to which Amat gives five phases. Moche II ceramics from tombs near the South Temple at Chavin represent the Classic period, while rare sherds of Huari Vifiaque type correspond to the Huari horizon. The period of Kingdoms and Confederations is well represented by the ruins of Rapayan in the ceja de la selva of the upper Marafi6n. From Chachapoyas (Cuelap) in the north to Junin in the south, and in- cluding the Gran Pajaten and Tantamayo in</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH 285 Huanuco, the pattern includes villages of circular or semicircular houses, public buildings with four to six stories, and two or three storied mausoleums for collective burials. Documents dis- covered by Waldemar Espinoza attest that this entire area was occupied by the kingdom of the Yarus. Amat also reports numerous sites of the Inca and Colonial periods, especially the historical- ly documented workshops in Uco and Rapayann. At Chavin itself parts of the system of interior and subterranean drains have been restored to working order, demonstrating that the siphon system of flushing was understood by the Formative builders. Unflushed residues suggest human, camelid, and guinea pig sacrifices accom- panied by obsidian and ceramics. In addition to his work at the Early Man site of Los Toldos in Argentina, Augusto Cardich (Museo de la Plata) has returned to Lauricocha (Huanuco) with Guggenheim support. The excava- tions in Cave L-1 were greatly expanded, the stratigraphy confirmed, grinding stones identified as early as Lauricocha I, and the new preceramic burials were located. Through extensive survey and test excavations in numerous sites, Cardich con- firmed the extension of the Lauricocha industry far into the mountainous interior of the Dos de Mayo province. Notable results include the re- mains of a Scelidotherium, unfortunately not associated with cultural material, and a radio- carbon date of 13,460 B.P. from a level with weak indications of human activity. Cardich also began an investigation of the prehistoric agri- cultural systems of the Lauricocha Puna, with particular attention to irrigation works and late centers of population and significant architecture. He suggests that amelioration of the climate from about A.D. 1100-1300 permitted extensive settle- ments at higher elevations in the Upper Mara?i6n drainage. Lorenzo Samaniego Roman (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) spent much of 1975 and 1976 on the excavation, cleaning, and restoration of Pafiamarca, Punkuri, and other sites in the Nepefia Valley. However, he also worked at several sites in the Departments of Lima, Huan- cavelica (Huaytara, near Castrovirreyna), and Pisco (Tambo Colorado), and in the Casma Valley at Pampa de Llamas. In 1977, after Samaniego returns from a German sponsored study tour in Europe, further ORDEZA support is targeted for work at Pampa de Llamas, Paramonga, Pafiamarca, Chavin, and Wilkawafn. Near the beach at Huarmey, Duccio Bonavia (Universidad Cayteano Heredia) has discovered a lithic quarry known as El Volcan. After con- trolled surface collection, stratigraphic excavation, and a statistical study by Jean Lesage (CNRS, France) Bonavia concludes that El Volcan repre- sents a single unified industry related to those from Chivateros and Paijan. As at Chivateros there are many preforms and waste flakes, but very few finished artifacts. Bonavia is now searching the Huarmey area for workshops and habitation sites corresponding to the El Volcan complex. He calls for a revision of the Lanning and Patterson seriation of the Central Coast Preceramic. From his 1976 season at Los Gavilanes (PV35-1, former- ly Huarmey North 1) Bonavia brought back larger samples as well as more data on the stratigraphy. This site definitely belongs to the final stage of the Preceramic, and preliminary studies of the maize by Alexander Grobman show that it is an early form of Confite Morocho. There are no indications of Mexican races or teosinte/tripsacum introgression. Karen E. Stothert (Fordham), in cooperation with Rogger Ravines (Instituto Nacional de Cultura), excavated a small architectural complex and burial grounds in the Lurin Valley. The ceramic offerings are of a previously unknown style, which she has called Villa Salvador and assigned to the early phases of the Early Inter- mediate period. Supported by grants from the Ford Foundation and Fordham Research Council, Stothert was able to stay an entire year and expand her research into a comprehensive study of the Early Intermediate origins of complex style on the Central Coast. Frederic Engel (Universidad Agraria) reports that his institute has been elevated and renamed the Centro de Investigaciones de Zonas Aridas (CIZA), and that it is now charged with planning for the future as well as understanding the use of arid lands in the past. CIZA will soon publish an atlas of the prehistoric occupation of the desert coast, showing all regions of lomas vegetation and inhabited and cultivated zones, from Ecuador to Chile, at a scale of 1:100,000. Robert Benfer (Missouri) is collaborating with Engel on further excavations at Paloma (prefarmer village 613) in the lomas of Chilca, where Engel has already excavated 45 huts and 90 graves along two six-meter-wide trenches. With support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the NSF, they hope to study the demography of the Chilca Valley, where by 4500 B.C. settlers had begun to cultivate cotton and beans. Faunal remains are under analysis by Elizabeth Reitz (Florida State Museum) who is also studying West's material from the Viru Valley. As organizer, staff archaeologist, and inter- preter, Ann Kendall (London Institute of Archae- ology) helped a group of geophysicists from Liverpool and Oxford collect archaeomagnetic dating samples from sites on the North and Central Coasts, Junin, Ayacucho, Cuzco, and Puno. In return, with financial support from Liverpool, various project members helped her to renew her work at Cusichaca, 30 km upstream from Machu Picchu. Her work continues to utilize extensive horizontal excavation as she focuses on functional interpretation of Inca architecture and the field authentification of ethnohistoric ac- counts. Kendall will continue her work in 1977. After finishing his dissertation project at Cerro de Arena, a late Formative site in the Moche Valley, Elias Mujica Barreda worked at the major Formative site of La Florida in the Rimac Valley. The La Florida excavations were coordinated by</page><page sequence="15">286 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 Idilio Santillana and the report will soon be published by the INC. Mujica now works as resident archaeologist at Pukara (Puno) on the UNESCO-sponsored (COPESCO) project, along with Ernesto Nakandakari. They have excavated structures similar to those found by Kidder at the Principal Pyramid. Equally noteworthy is the dis- covery of architecture in the Inca pattern over- lying structures from the Pukara phase; Mujica thinks they may possibly have found the Tambo of Pukara mentioned by the chroniclers. Meg Kluge, Joel Rabinowitz, and Rick Watson (Texas-Austin) conducted a three month survey of the central Chicama Valley to investigate the area's role in coastal-sierra interaction from the Early to the Late Intermediate Periods. They worked in cooperation with Victor Antonio Rodriguez SuySuy and the Proy- ecto Museo de Sitio "Chavimochic." Funds were provided by the University of Texas Latin American Anthropological Program. BOLIVIA. From Cochabamba William J. Korn- field writes that he has located three lakeshore workshop sites, entirely preceramic and previously uncollected, north of Tarija at 3,650 m elevation. The situation is similar to that of Viscachani, except that the nearby lake is still a reality, with hundreds of flamingos and wild ducks present. Artifacts are predominantly large willow leaf points of the Ayampitfn variety described by Rex Gonzailez. They are made of fine grained quartzite and exhibit well controlled bifacial pressure retouch. Kornfeld notes the strategic location of the Tarija sites on a line between Ayampitin and Viscachani. In 1976 he planned to return to the locale for more survey and surface collection after plotting the location of each artifact. CHILE. Reorganization of the universities in the North of Chile has resulted in a loss of several positions, but the research program remains strong. Mario Rivera (Universidad del Norte, Arica) continues his dissertation-related investiga- tion of the Early Intermediate period. His attempt to understand the diet and economy have led him to coordinate a study of the coprolites by an interdisciplinary team of scientists: Pedro Gallo (plant pathologist), Blago Razmili'c (chemist), and Hugo Escobar (palynologist). Jorge Hidalgo, now in Arica, is studying the sixteenth and seventeenth records of San Pedro de Atacama which are located in the Bolivian archives in Sucre. Patricia Soto has turned from her osteological analyses to a study of the headresses worn by the mummies of the Arica area, while Liliana Ulloa completes her investigation of archaeological textiles. Guillermo Focacci, Director of the Museo Arqueol6gico de Aza- pa, is involved in the analysis of his collections from the site Azapa-6. In the Antofagasta area Agustfn Llagostera Mar- tinez (Director, Museo Regional de Antofagasta) has developed, in concert with Hector Garces, an ambi- tious program to study the prehistoric cultural ecology of the coastal region. With the aid of a computer Lla- gostera is trying to quantitatively define ecotypes based on a multitude of environmental, cultural, and chronological variables. In 1976 the ecology and set- tlement pattern of the Mejillones Peninsula was studied in detail. Llagostera also conducted new exca- vations at the Cerro Moreno site. Lautaro Nulnez Atencio (Universidad del Norte, Antofagasta) excavated one of the stratified Tulan sites, near San Pedro de Atacama, assisted by Virginia Popper (Harvard University) and a team from Cornell University led by Thomas Lynch. Nulnez and Lynch represented their respective universities in a full semester undergraduate field school, during which survey and test excavations were also conducted in the Upper Loa drainage and the Puna de Atacama. Gustave Le Paige (Director, Museo Arqueol6gico de San Pedro) was honored through a festschrift volume authored by his Chilean colleagues, presented with the award of the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa by the Universidad del Norte. George Serracino has finished his studies at Cornell and returned to San Pedro de Atacama to assist Le Paige in his archaeological and ethnological research. Gonzalo Ampuero Brito, returning to the area of his earlier work near La Serena, has been appointed Conservator of the new Museo Arqueol6gico de Ovalle. Ampuero anticipates the establishment of a new program of investigations in the Norte Chico. Horacio Larrain Barros (Instituto de Geografia, Universidad Cat6lica de Chile) worked out of the Instituto Otavalefno de Antropologfa during 1976. His latest, ethnobotanical research concerns the ritual use of drugs by Quechua and Aymara speakers of the historic and prehistoric past. Thomas Dillehay (University of Texas) was engaged as an instructor and research scientist last year at the Temuco seat of the Universidad Cat6lica. He surveyed areas of both the sierra and coast, obtaining data on subsistence, chronology, and the relationships between the zones. Bones of extinct animals were collected from the talus debris in front of one cave in which the early cultural layers are sealed by roof fall. Near Quele (Cautfn) on the coast, earthquakes have produced new exposures and cuts that are of great archaeological interest. Dillehay reports a situation where up to 3 m of sand overlay two well developed soil zones, the lower of which contained charcoal and remains of a stone structure. Surface finds include points somewhat like the Ayampitfn and, less expectedly, the Plainview types. In addition, a local Mapuche has two fish-tail points in his collection from the same area. Earl C. Saxon (University of Durham) has reinvestigated the stratigraphic associations at Eber- hardt (Mylodon) and Fell's Caves in the far south. Saxon finds that the human arrival in both cases coincides with the appearance of woodland vegetation and is accompanied by a pattern of exclusive guanaco exploitation. In Mylodon Cave, level 6 is followed by a return to more glacial conditions in level 7, when the cave was reinhabited by mylodons. Saxon notes that the survival of mylodons after the initial human arrival, along with the absence of signs that men killed mylodons at either Fell's or Mylodon Caves, argue against the universality of Paul Martin's overkill hypothesis. THOMAS F. LYNCH</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT RESEARCH 287 NORTHWESTERN SOUTH AMERICA ECUADOR. The joint archaeological expedition of the University of Illinois, the Banco Central, the Florida State Museum and the University of Guayaquil reported last year was led by Donald W. Lathrap and Jorge G. Marcos. The Rumicucho Expedition from Museo del Banco Central, Quito spent seven months at a hilltop fortress (pucari) 24 km north of Quito at the eastern edge of the xerophytic Lulumbamba Plain. The site is com- posed of a series of terraces which descend the hillside to give the site a pyramidal appearance. Each terrace is delineated by a large stone retaining wall made from reddish colored quartzitic porphyry joined with earth and pumice. Some walls are up to 3 m high but others have completely disappeared. Stone foundations are barely visible on the terraces. A large habitation area, 22 m by 9 m, was excavated on the fifth terrace. The strategic position of the site along with the large quan- tity of arms (axes, sling stones, bolas) and the height of the walls suggest that the site really did serve as a fortress. In addition to the soldiers garrisoned there, a group of important dignitaries may also have occupied the buildings. Because the site is almost on the Equa- tor it may have fulfilled a ceremonial function as well. The Chroniclers affirm the importance of the equatori- al zone for ceremonies in honor of the Sun and it was important to the aboriginal population to know the date of the equinoxes and solstices. Most of the arti- facts from the site are Inca related but there may also have been a pre-Inca occupation. A relationship be- tween this site and the tolas of Imbabura is suggested. A second expedition from the Museo del Banco Central is excavating a Formative (Machalilla) period site on the outskirts of Quito. Fernando Plaza S. (Instituto Otavalefno de Antropologia) completed the first phase of an archaeological/ethnohistorical project on the Inca conquest of northern Ecuador. In a monograph to be published by the IOA he reports 23 pucaras (fortresses) which were used during the local resistance to the Inca conquest. He plans to continue the study of fortresses on the Pambamarca Meseta and to test various sites to establish the relationships between architecture and ceramics, particularly at Caranqui, near Ibarra. Stephen Athens (Instituto Otavelefno de Antro- pologia and the University of New Mexico) continues work on the Imbabura tolas. Emilio Bonifaz, a responsible amateur, continues to surface collect lithic materials from the region of El Inga and Ilal6. He has complete hydration datings which cover the gaps in the series as already known. The joint British Museum-London University Institute of Archaeology is continuing work in the Jubones valley under the direction of Elizabeth Carmichael and Warwick Bray. Site survey has located settlements of all periods from Formative to Inca, and several of these sites will be tested. Excavation has begun at a site with stone-faced platforms of approximately the thirteenth century B.C. Resfa Parducci (Casa de la Cultura del Guayas) and Ibrahim Parducci (Museo Municipal) report excava- tiolls at a Guayaquil phase site on the outskirts of Guayaquil. They have developed a ceramic chronology based upon 2,300 rim sherds which have been divided into 25 vessel forms. Reports of this work have appeared in Nos. 37 and 39 of Cuadernos de Historia y Arqueologia and the final chapters will appear in No. 42 of that journal. Jos6 Alcina Franch (Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid) continued research in Esmeraldas and at Ingapirca. COLOMBIA. Lucia R. de Perdomo (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia) briefly reports her work during 1975 and 1976. In Valle del Cauca she excavated shaft graves with multiple chambers and niches at different levels. These graves are associated with a new style of ceramics. In Guaduas (Cundinamarci) she excavated a burial site with individual and multiple burials characterized by tabular erect skull deformation associated with typical Panche ceramics, spindle whorls, and grinding stones. In Arauca Province in thfe Llanos Orientales she tested a habitation site with caraipe tempered ceramics which are technologically similar to the pottery made by the SSlivas Indians. In five caves in Santander, Buraramanga and San Gil burials attributed to the Guan6 Indians were accompanied by textiles, beads, coca, and maize leaves. Some of the caves were decorated with pictographs. Rectangular and oval Muisca graves in Funza and Soacha contained pottery. Only the Soacha graves were covered by a stone slab. THOMAS P. MYERS AMAZON AND EASTERN BRAZIL PERU. Peter Roe (Delaware) carried out both archaeological and ethnographical research in the Montania of Peru. His ethnographical work involved the study of Shipibo art which is derived from the prehistoric Cumancaya Tradition. Special reference was given the elaborate painted and appliqu6 designs used by women to decorate their skirts. The art produced by a male Shipibo artist was also studied and compared with the more typical female art. Roe's archaeological work consisted of a survey of the Calleria river where he hoped to find sites containing sherds pertaining to the interfluvial Panoan groups. Ceramic materials were found, but analysis and comparison with materials previously found by Robert Braun (Bryn Mawr College) have not been completed. Peter Siegel (Delaware), working under the super- vision of Peter Roe, excavated a recently abandoned Shipibo compound in order to measure the rate of midden accumulation and to study the nature of artifact preservation in a tropical forest situation. The analysis attempted to define activity areas and generate hypotheses on Shipibo life. The hypotheses were later tested by interviewing informants who previously lived on the site and by doing an inspec- tional analysis of presently inhabited compounds. The goal of this ethnoarchaeological study is to produce a scale of comparison for historically related Cumancaya archaeological sites. EASTERN BRAZIL. Goias. The Goias archaeolog- ical program (Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas and the Universidade Cat6lica de Goias) continued into the</page><page sequence="17">288 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 fourth year of research. Participants in the project include Pedro Ignacio Schmitz, Altair Sales Barbosa, Irmhild Wiist, Avelino Fernandes de Miranda, Wilson Ferreira da Cunha, Silvia Moehlecke, and Silvia Matilde Pozza. During the dry season of 1976, four cave sites were excavated, bringing the total of excavated cave sites to 17. The known archaeological sequence dates from 10,400 B.P. to the sixteenth century A.D. Flakes and knives are the principal artifacts found. Food remains consisting of small mammals, birds, and reptiles have been found in some of the drier caves. Many other cave sites have been located and mapped, and 300 m2 of pictographs have been copied. Minas Gerais. Odemar Dias (Instituto de Arqueolo- gia Brasileira), Eliana Carvalho, Lilia Cheuiche, and Franklin Levy excavated the Caverna do Gentio site (MG-RP-6), sponsored by IPHAN and the Smithsonian Institution. The calcareous cave site includes nearly 100 m2 of occupational area and 1.20 m of strati- graphy with evidence of diverse occupations. Carbon taken from the middle of the long preceramic se- quence has been dated to 8215?150 radiocarbon years: 6265 B.C. (SI 2372). Artifacts of agate, flint, chalcedony and quartz predominate, but some miner- alized bone projectile points also were found. Food remains include land snail (Strophocheylus) and un- identified palm nuts. Ceramic material of the Unaf tradition overlay the preceramic levels. Associated lith- ic artifacts like ones from coastal sites indicate that this late occupation may represent a blending of both interior and coastal influences. Other varied cultural materials recovered include pottery, basketry, gourds (Cucurbita), cordage, string, woven material, and feather work. Food remains recovered from coprolite analysis include undigested cake, coconut, corn, pea- nut, gourd, unidentified seeds, and insects. Calasans Rodrigues and Arthur J. Filho (Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira) excavated the Caverna do Boqueirao Soberbo site near Varzelandia. Pictographs and various cultural materials including flakes of chalcedony and flint were found. The upper levels of this dry cave contained corn cobs and beds of grass. The program of research in the Sao Francisco river valley continued under the directorship of Ondehuar Dias and Eliana Caravalho. Work was carried out on the upper course of the river in the region of Bambui. New sites of the Piumhi phase of the Unai tradition were found in caves as well as in the open. One site of the Belvedere Phase of the Tupiguarani tradition was found near the Rio Grande in southern Minas Gerais. Rio de Janeiro. Excavations continued at the preceramic site (RJ-JC-64). The artifacts from this site are now considered to belong to the Apicum phase of the Itaipu tradition. For a description of the site see American Antiquity, 41:229. The littoral Fluminense research program directed by Odemar Dias and Eliana Carvalho and sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution entered its second year of work. A survey of the northern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro has led to the identification of Itaipu phase sites, Maca6 phase sambaquis, and one Tupiguarani Corrugated Tradition site of the Sernambitiba phase. Rogerio Carrasco and Lilia Cheuiche of the Serra Fluminense program surveyed an area of the lower course of the Paquequer River and a 50 km section of the middle Paraiba River. Two new Tupiguarani Corrugated Tradition sites of the Itaocara phase were identified. In the mountainous area between the rivers, new sites of the Mucuri phase of the Una Tradition were found. The editor of this report believes that the distribu- tion of Una Tradition sites in the interfluvial area and the Tupiguarani sites along the rivers is similar to the Panoan situation of riverine and interfluvial groups on the Ucayali River. It is probably the same dichotomy that exists between the Ge type adaptation and the tropical forest riverine adaptation of the ethnographic- ally recorded Tupi-Guarani. Rog6rio Carrasco, Calasans Rodrigues, and Jos6 Antonio Alves de Azevedo continued their work of recording and salvaging of sites in the municipio of Rio de Janeiro. Three sites of the Guaratiba Phase of the Tupiguarani Painted Subtradition were in- vestigated. RON WEBER</page></plain_text>
