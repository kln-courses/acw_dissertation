<plain_text><page sequence="1">JERROLD L. ARONSON ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' A recent trend in philosophical literature concerning the concept of causation has been to speak of causes in terms of manipulation or the ability to control certain facets of nature. One pernicious outcome, I believe, of such talk is that this view of causation would deny the use of 'cause' in the theoretical sciences (especially in physics) since these sciences are not directly concerned with controlling or manipulating nature. In other words, our conception of causation turns out to be anthropomorphic in nature, its application depending on how the physical situation relates to human beings. It is argued, for example, that one can not identify causes or distinguish cause from effect unless he appeals to human manipulation. This paper is an attempt to answer the above position and justify the use of 'cause' in the theoretical sciences by supplying the reader with nonanthropomorphic conditions for deter mining the direction of the cause-effect relation. i In his article 'Causation and Recipes', Douglas Gasking attacks the view that regular succession captures the essence of causal relations. But this "regular succession" notion will not do. For there are cases where we would speak of A causing B where it is not the case that from the occurrence of A we may infer the subsequent occurrence of B.1 This is because the cases Gasking has in mind are those in which "the effect is not something subsequent to the cause, but simultaneous."2 From the fact that a bar of iron is now glowing we can certainly infer (and it will be a causal inference) that it is now at a temperature of 1,000?C. or over. Yet we should not say that its high temperature was caused by the glowing: we say that the high temperature causes the glowing, not vice versa.3 Gasking's point is that there are numerous cases where the Humean view fails to enable one to discern cause from effect, i.e. it fails to establish a Synthese 22 (1971) 414-430.

However, if one cannot distinguish cause from effect by appealing to temporal succession or by the ability to infer one event from another, then how does one establish this cause-effect asym metry? Gasking's answer is quite convincing. When we have a general manipulative technique which results in a certain sort of event A, we speak of producing A by this technique. (Heating things by putting them on a fire.) When in certain cases application of the general technique for producing A also results in B we speak of producing B by producing A. (Making iron glow by heating it.) And in such a case we speak of A causing B but not vice-versa. Thus the notion of causation is essentially connected with our manipulative techniques for producing results. Roughly speaking: "A rise in the temperature of iron causes it to glow" means "By applying to iron the general technique for making things hot you will also, in this case, make it glow". Thus a statement about the cause of something is very closely connected with a recipe for producing it or for preventing it.4 But what of those uses of 'cause' where it seems quite futile to speak of human (or otherwise) manipulation, for example, 'Gravity causes un supported bodies to fall'? Gasking's answer: There is, however, what might be called a "popular science" use of "cause" which may not exactly fit the account given a use of the word by laymen who know some science and by some scientists in their less strictly professional moments. I have in mind such a locution as "Gravity causes unsupported bodies to fall". Such a statement is not quite on a par, logically, with "Great heat causes steel to melt". It would be fair to say, I think, that the use of the word "cause" here is a sophisticated extension from its more primitive and fundamental meaning.5 (my emphasis) I seriously question Gasking's claim that his analysis reflects a use of 'cause' which is a fundamental one. Note that with 'Gravity causes un supported bodies to fall', cause and effect are, again, simultaneous. There are other causal situations in the sciences where cause and effect are simultaneous, especially in mechanics; these will be discussed below. But, if Gasking's analysis can not be extended to science - being so entangled with the notion of human manipulation - then what can one appeal to in these scientific situations in order to distinguish cause from effect? One answer already supplied by some philosophers (and hinted at by Gasking) is that there is, in fact, no legitimate use of 'cause' which is free from anthropomorphism; and, since causal propositions turn out to be "descriptions of relations between natural events in anthropomorphic terms," 'cause' should be eliminated from theoretical science altogether.6</page><page sequence="3">416 JERROLD L. ARONSON So, the challenge presented by Gasking's position is to find a basis for determining a cause-effect asymmetry without having to appeal to human manipulation. To begin, let us examine what I take to be a paradigm case of simul taneous causation : it is simply a mechanism consisting of two gears that are meshed; the clockwise rotation of one gear causes the other to rotate counter clockwise. Here, cause and effect are simultaneous; yet, if neither gear was being manipulated at the time, I should still insist that one causes the other to rotate. The question is, 'Which one?' One may object that one of the gears is being manipulated by some external driving force and that is the cause of the other's rotation as well. But this will not do, primarily because the notation of manipulation is so an thropomorphic in the first place. Note that 'manipulate' is used in con texts where intelligent behavior occurs. For example, here are some dictionary headings for 'manipulate' : 1. To handle, manage, or use, esp. with skill, in some process of treat ment or performance. 2. To manage or influence by artful skill. 3. To adapt or change to suit one's purpose or advantage. But a driving force does not handle with skill, or, say, turn a gear to suit its own purpose. These expressions modify intelligent behavior. At most, one may say the driving force causes one of the gears to rotate and that gear, in turn, causes the other gear to rotate. If one still insists on talk of manipulation in this case, then such talk is a significant extension of that term. Now there are countless cases where causal claims are made without bringing in manipulation. The motion of one body causes another to move even though no one manipulated (or even could mani pulate) the first body.7 Connecting rods may move pistons back and forth even though no one manipulates them. There are cases of human action causing events to occur where 'manipulation' is not applicable. Consider the case of explaining why the inkwell is on its side by saying that John knocked it over. Suppose John accidentally brushed his hand against the inkwell. If so, John did not manipulate anything at the time; there is no skill involved here. (These cases will be discussed below.) There are numerous situations where we want to say that one thing caused something to happen; yet, according to Gasking's thesis, we can not make such a claim simply because non-intelligent behavior was involved.</page><page sequence="4">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 417 In the following sections, I shall present a model that will be able to handle those cases the 'regular succession' view can not cover, while enabling us to determine the direction of the causal relation for these situations where cause and effect are contemporaneous. Although it applies mainly to mechanical causation, it can also account for the non scientific examples presented by Gasking as well as certain nonscientific cases which his analysis can not explain. I shall go on to show that, contrary to what Gasking says, statements of causation in science are quite on par with many causal locutions in ordinary language. ii Before I present the reader with this account of mechanical causation, it is imperative that certain grammatical or syntactic features concerning 'cause' are made clear, features which should be explained if our analysis of the causal relation is to work. Now, on cursory inspection of causal locutions, it appears that transitive verbs such as 'push', 'pull', 'lift', 'knocks', 'makes', et al. invariably occur. This grammatical fact indicates that 'cause' is really a dimension-word, that is, it serves as "the most general and comprehensive term in a whole group of terms of the same kind, terms that fulfill the same function."8 In this case, the class of terms of which 'cause' is a dimension-word consists of many transitive verbs such as those mentioned above. The fact that there is a special transformational relation between transitive verbs and 'cause' serves as evidence for this claim. In sentences containing transitive verbs and objective complements9 'cause' can be substituted, along with other modifications, for the transitive verb, that is, a sentence of the form Noun Phrase + Transitive Verb + Direct Object + Objective Complement can be replaced by Noun Phrase+ caused+ Direct Object + Copula+Objective Complement. For example, 'John knocked the book on the floor9 can be changed ac cordingly to 'John causedthe book to be on the floor9. Of course, 'knocked' is more specific than 'caused' and it is more likely to be used.10 Another</page><page sequence="5">418 JERROLD L. ARONSON example would be 'The connecting rod pushes the piston back and forth9. Here, using the suitable copula, 'moves', this sentence can be transformed to 'The connecting rod causes the piston to move back and forth9.11 The reason why I selected this particular phrase structure context or schema is because it serves as a formula that enables one to sort out causal verbs from non-causal types. The linguistic context supplied by the objective complement allows one, for example, to distinguish between sentences such as 'John looked at the book for a long time9, 'at' and 'for a long time' being adverbial, and 'John knocked the book on the floor9, 'on the floor' being an objective complement. The transitive verb in the latter sentence is causative, as hallmarked by the objective complement, while the transitive verb in the former sentence is not. Of course, if there were a situation or context where one could 'look the book on the floor', then 'look' would be a causative verb. (Note, also, that the transformational relation is one-way, for if we know that A causes B, it does not follow that we know what particular transitive verb fills in for 'cause'.) There are minor exceptions to this transformation: transitive verbs such as 'know', 'found', 'call', etc. take objective complements, but they can" not be replaced by 'cause'. For example, 'He found my remarks intelligible' is not transformationally related to 'He caused my remarks to be intelligible'. However, transitive verbs such as these can be reparsed in such a way as to eliminate the objective complement in favor of an appositive clause. Thus, 'We thought his remarks unkind' can be changed to 'We thought that his remarks were unkind', whereas 'John knocked the book on the floor' can not undergo the same conversion. In other words, transitive verbs such as 'know', 'see', etc. are not really factitive verbs, and the objective complements in these cases do not really denote any significant change in the object that is due to such things as 'seeing' and 'knowing'.12 If I am correct about these syntactic features of the word 'cause', then it follows that a complete understanding of the nature of causation would ultimately require an understanding of the meanings of various types of transitive verbs.13 However, if this is so, then Gasking's analysis of'cause' surely has been amiss, for talk of manipulation can not possibly account for the occurrence of transitive verbs in causal locutions. This is so because, as I have pointed out above, the notion of manipulation is connected with concepts that serve to modify intelligent behavior; but</page><page sequence="6">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 419 transitive verbs can be used without being modified by adverbs of manner such as 'skillfully', 'delicately', 'intentionally', etc. Another outcome of the above syntactic formula is that if a given application of 'cause' is a legitimate one, there should be some specific transitive verb that appropriately describes the situation. There does not, as yet, seem to be any analysis of causation that accommodates this particular fact about causal locutions. For example, in his Aspects of Scientific Explanation, Carl G. Hempel presents an analysis of causation which fits his deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation.14 In this essay, he distinguishes between two kinds of laws, laws of (tem poral) succession and laws of coexistence (352); only the former type of law can be used to establish causal relations. A cause turns out to be "some antecedent state of the total system, which provides the 'initial conditions' for the computation, by means of a theory, of the later state that is to be explained." (pp. 351, 352) However, even if one can show that B is a function of A by some law of succession, it does not follow that A causes B. If 'A causes B9 is true, then there should be a more specific transitive verb (e.g. 'forced', 'pulls', etc.) available to describe such a relation between A and B, and talk of initial states, alone, will not supply us with that verb. Because of this, Hempel's analysis turns out to be too inclusive, for there are many states that fit his characteriza tion of 'cause' although they would not be considered causes by the scientist. The law of free fall, for example, S=i gt2 + Vt (where S re presents the distance the body falls, g the gravitational constant, V the initial velocity of the body, and t the amount of time the body falls), is a law of succession; however, even though the distance travelled by the body in free fall is &amp; function of its initial velocity (V) and how long it has been falling, the cause of the body's motion is a gravitational field - not the initial conditions - which acts simultaneously with the accelera tion it causes. At each instance, gravity pulls or attracts the body toward the center of the earth. Besides, if causal claims are established only through laws of succession, how can one confirm sentences such as 'Gravity causes unsupported bodies to fall', 'Heat causes iron to glow', 'Gear A causes gear B to turn', etc.? (Gasking would surely agree with this.) If Gasking and Hempel (and others) cannot account for these gramma tical features of 'cause', then what condition(s) can we cite in order to</page><page sequence="7">420 JERROLD L. ARONSON understand the occurrence of transitive verbs in causal expressions? I fear that such a task is far beyond the limited objectives of this paper. In fact, an attempt to arrive at some unified account of transitive verbs may be quite inadvisable because of such a vast variety of applications ranging from mechanical cases such as 'John knocked the inkwell over' to more mentalistic cases such as 'My friend brought me to my senses'. Thus, the ensuing model will be limited to a central core of transitive verbs that occur in "mechanical" contexts, for example, verbs such as 'push', 'pull', 'hit', 'knock', 'attract', etc. The model will particularly avoid mentalistic applications of transitive verbs which occur in sentences like 'His remarks made me laugh', 'The noise of the crowd rattled me', 'His inconsiderate treatment of others angered me', etc. Not that these cases are uninteresting, but they are beset with difficulties which do not seem to occur in the mechanical cases.15 On the one hand, we say 'His words made me angry' or 'The dog's barking made me afraid'; but 'makes', here, functions very much like a dummy variable, and it does not seem to denote anything more specific going on between the 'cause' and 'effect' objects. On the other hand, when specific transitive verbs do occur in these expressions, their application trades off mechanical paradigms, as illustrated by these cases found in A. Michotte's The Perception of Causality: ...'I was struck all of a heap9, 'It shook me to pieces', T was overwhelmed by grief, 'I was transported with joy', 'I am deeply impressed9, 'It pierced me to the quick\ 'It crushed me', 'It got me down9, 'It knocked me flat', 'I am bursting with enthusiasm' 'I feel drawn towards9, 'That is repulsive9, 'I am stricken with grief, 'That is attractive9 'That gave me a shock9, and many others.16 Contrary to Collingwood's conclusion that the word 'cause' is dependent on anthropomorphic conceptions, it may be the other way around: 'cause' is applied to mental phenomena in analogy to mechanical causation, that is, paramechanically. So, let us turn now to mechanical causation. m I think that it is an unfortunate outcome of the philosophical dictum, 'Every event has a cause', that any kind of change turns out to be a caused change. This does not seem to be the case in the theoretical sciences, for they clearly distinguish changes in objects that take place</page><page sequence="8">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 421 independently of other objects with changes that result from interactions with other objects; only the latter type of change is a causal change. In other words, there are certain changes that take place in individuals that can be completely accounted for without having to appeal to the be havior of other individuals. I'll call these changes, 'natural changes'. The sense of 'natural' I have in mind when I contrast it, say, with 'unnatural' is not the same as that used in such phrases as 'natural phenomenon' or 'natural sciences'. In the latter case, 'natural' is used to denote real or physical as opposed to spiritual or supernatural. In this sense, all changes that are caused are natural changes. But, theoretically, an object may undergo a change that is free from (or independent of) external constraint. This is the use of 'natural' I have in mind. What this emphasizes is that the cause is external to the object that it affects. In order to pursue this further, let us examine some examples of natural change. In Feynman's Lectures on Physics, the law of inertia is stated in the following way: If an object is left alone, is not disturbed, it continues to move with a constant velocity in a straight line if it was originally moving, or it continues to stand still if it was just standing still.17 The key phrase, here, is 'left alone' ; bodies take on a unique behavior pattern when left to themselves. Now, in the same way that Galileo regarded circular motion about the center of the Earth to be "entirely natural and self-explanatory,"18 Newton would reject a request for a causal explanation of constant linear velocity, and Einstein would not search for the cause of motion along a geodesic. Hart and Honor? also have a similar idea in mind when they speak of the cause as "something which interferes with or intervenes in the course of events which would normally take place."19 Condition one, then, contrasts a caused change in an object with a change that would have taken place if it were left to itself: (1) In 'A causes B9,6B9 designates a change in an object, a change which is an unnatural one.20 The cases of causation these conditions are meant to cover - including Gasking's cases - are those where the cause and effect are simultaneous; and, as I pointed out above, these cases are quite frequent in mechanical</page><page sequence="9">422 JERROLD L. ARONSON (e.g. gravitational phenomena) as well as in everyday situations. However, if the cause and effect are separate in space at the time of the occurrence of the change in question, then certain conceptual difficulties are pre sented to the scientist. These difficulties have often been categorized under the problem of 'action at a distance', to wit, if the cause and effect are separated in space when the causal relation occurs, then how is the cause able to act on the object affected? Below, I will supply the reader with more details on this problem when I show how our notion of causation is conceptually related to conservation principles. But, for now, I will introduce condition two not so much as a strict condition for causal locutions in mechanics as an adaptation meant to incorporate develop ments that have occurred in the history of mechanics : (2) In KA causes B9, at the time B occurs, the object that causes B is in contact with the object that undergoes the change. At this stage, we have yet to account for what underlies the use of transitive verbs in mechanical situations, especially those cases covered by Gasking's analysis. Not only must we add a condition that serves to enlighten us about certain causative transitive verbs, if it is to successfully rival Gasking's analysis, it should also serve as a device which enables us to determine the direction of contemporaneous causal relations. So, at this point, I will add a third condition which claims that what underlies the use of mechanical transitive verbs is a process of transference which occurs between the cause and effect objects: (3) Prior to the time of the occurrence of B, the body that makes contact with the effect object possesses a quantity (e.g. velocity, momentum, kinetic energy, heat, etc.) which is transferred to the effect object (when contact is made) and manifested as?. Thus, if conditions one through three are correct, 'A9 in 6A causes B9 refers to an object that successfully transfers one of its quantities to the effect object. When causal propositions are applied to mechanical situations, one is not simply talking of A and B as events that occur together, but cause and effect are identified by noting the direction of transference between bodies. Now conditions one through three can be used to settle the ques</page><page sequence="10">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 423 tion as to which gear was the cause of the other's movement by asking and answering another question, viz. 'Which gear transferred its motion to the other?' The test might be to disengage the gears and see which one stops moving and which one continues to move as before. If, for example, gear A continues to move clockwise while gear B ceases to move counter clockwise, then we have reason to say that A transferred its motion to B and not vice versa, i.e. A caused B to rotate, for if B were left to itself it would not have rotated. (I'm sure that this is experimentally naive, but it will serve purposes for the present.) IV There are countless applications conditions one through three have for causation in the sciences and for every day situations. Although scientists use the technical concepts of momentum and energy as opposed to 'motion', the spirit of interpreting mechanical behavior as instances of my three conditions is retained. Suppose that a billiard ball is moving on a billiard table; the ball has a definite momen tum. Each time the ball rebounds from a cushion its momentum changes in magnitude and in direction, and eventually as a result of friction the ball comes to rest. ...as the ball moves forwards and backwards, the earth must move backwards and forwards. We may understand how this situation arises by noting that when the ball rebounds from the cushion it communicates a certain motion to the cushion and thereby to the billiard table. Since the latter is fixed to the ground, it drags the earth along, so that the earth's momentum is changed in consequence, (my emphasis)21 We are again reminded how most transitive verbs denote a process of transference. 'John knocked over the inkwell' or 'John caused the inkwell to topple over' has us picture John's hand imparting a rotational motion to the inkwell. The cue ball causes another billiard ball to move in that it transfers its motion to the latter. 'John threw the ball away' is another case of transference of motion, this time from John's hand to the ball. Connecting rods transfer the rotational motion of a wheel to linearly moving pistons. Consider: 'Heat causes water to boil'. Heat energy is transferred to the molecules of the water and manifested as kinetic energy. Increase of air pressure causing a barometer to rise is a case of one thing displacing another - and so on. These cases of causation were selected because Gasking's model can not account for them while the model I have proposed can. In each example, we know something was caused to</page><page sequence="11">424 JERROLD L. ARONSON happen, but we did not have to know if, in fact, manipulation had taken place. v Before I go on to other issues, I should like to mention some apparent counterexamples to the conditions I have set forth for distinguishing cause from effect. The first concerns cases where we are inclined to say one thing causes another to stop. For example, if a motor scooter runs into a fixed wall and is stopped, what did the wall transfer to the scooter?22 If inertia (in this case, rest) were a quantity that things possessed, then inertia was passed on. Unfortunately, inertia is not something things possess and pass on. A scientific interpretation of the above case can be given; however, the causal relation is the reverse of what one normally might expect, viz. instead of speaking of the wall causing the scooter to stop, we speak of the scooter stopping because it transferred all of its kinetic energy to heat energy in the wall, that is, it caused the wall to get hotter. (If the wall weren't quite fixed, we would say the scooter crashed through the wall or knocked it down.) The above cases are not that serious, for a physicist will point out that the wall transferred some momentum to the scooter as well. In other words, there were actually two causal relations that occurred in this situation: the scooter caused heat or a deformation in the wall and the wall caused the scooter to stop. A case similar to the one above consists of placing ice cubes in a glass of water. Sometime later, the ice cubes melt and the water becomes cooler. Commonsensically, one might wish to say that the ice cubes caused the water to cool. This becomes a clear counter instance to con ditions one through three since there is no quantity - viz. one identifiable with the effect (e.g. 'coldness') - that ice cubes could possibly transfer to water. It seems, at first, that this case is an easy one for the manipulation view of causation: 'ice cubes cause water to cool' means if you want to cool water, place ice cubes in the water. But suppose we wished to get rid of ice cubes by following this recipe : if you want to get rid of ice cubes, place them in a glass and pour water over them. Now the direction of the causal relation is reversed, this time, water causing the ice to melt. In terms of the physics of the situation, however, it shouldn't really matter whether we add water to the ice or ice to the water. Actually, what</page><page sequence="12">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 425 happens is this : when ice is added to water, heat is transferred from the water to the ice and is converted to kinetic energy. This newly acquired energy overcomes the molecular forces that tend to keep the ice in a solid state. As a result - but not an effect - of this process, the water loses its heat and, thus, is at a cooler temperature than before. In other words, the correct description of this case is that in the process of causing the ice to melt, the water gave up some of its heat, i.e. became cooler. I shall call this last class of cases triggering phenomena.23 Consider a weight that is attached to a stretched spring. At a certain time, the catch that holds the spring taut is released, and the weight begins immediately to accelerate. One might be tempted to say that the release of the catch was the cause of the weight's acceleration. If so, then what did the release of the catch transfer to the weight? Nothing, of course. However, an interpretation in terms of conditions one through three is still available : the spring transferred its elastic energy to the weight, and the elastic energy was manifested as the weight's newly acquired kinetic energy; or, in more everyday terminology, it was the spring that pulled (caused) the weight from one end to the other. The above example is meant to illustrate an important distinction to be made between a cause and an occasion, the cause being that which brings about change while the occasion is a condition for making (transitive verb)-ing possible, i.e. a condition that enables the cause to act. Talking of causation in terms of manipulation or in terms of initial states fails to make this distinction. For example, when the rocket lifts off the ground, is it the thrust of its engines that causes it to accelerate or the initial pressing (manipulating) of the ignition button? VI Now let us return to the statement, 'Gravity causes unsupported bodies to fall'. This is a nebulous statement for layman and scientist alike, not because of some extended use of the word 'cause', as Gasking believes, but because that concept is applied to gravitational phenomena. Scientists do, however, interpret gravitation (in classical theory) as an instance of collision phenomena. In order to show how this is done in mechanics, let us return to the problem of action at a distance which was mentioned on page 83. The problem actually concerns action at a distance in relation to the conservation of momentum.24 If the sun acts on a planet at a dis</page><page sequence="13">426 JERROLD L. ARONSON tance, then such action must be instantaneous, or else conservation of momentum would be violated. More fundamentally, the axiom of the equality of action and reaction shows the importance of action at a distance in Newton's theory; in case body A is the source of an action which only later reaches a body B, where it produces an equal and opposite change of momentum, the sum of the momenta of both bodies is evidently not the same during the interval of transfer as before and after.25 However, this difficulty is avoided if action at a distance is replaced by field theory. The sun transfers momentum to the surrounding field which, in turn, transfers momentum to bodies in contact with the field. The sun does not act directly on the planet; it merely generates a change in the con dition of the ether, and it is this condition of the ether which betrays itself in a gravitational pull. The ether, or space, surrounding the sun thus plays an active part in the phenomenon. We also note that, according to the foregoing field interpreta tion, a certain period of time must elapse between the instant at which the sun comes into existence and instant at which the gravitational pull is experienced by the planet.26 This applies to electro-magnetic phenomena as well. (The development of these ideas is attributed mainly to Faraday and Maxwell.) Feynman shows how action at a distance can be eliminated by introducing the notion of a field: It takes time for the influence to cross the intervening distance, which it does at 186,000 miles a second. In that tiny time the momentum of the particles is not con served. Of course after the second charge has felt the effect of the first one and all is quieted down, the momentum equation will check out all right, but during this interval there is another kind of momentum besides that of the particle, mc, and that is momen tum in the electro-magnetic field. If we add the field momentum to the momentum of the particles, then momentum is conserved at any moment all the time. The fact that the electro-magnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes the field very real, and so, for better understanding, the original idea that there are just the forces between particles has been modified to the idea that a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field itself has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have.27 This suggests a definite connection between our concept of 'cause' and conservation principles. The ancient maxim, Ex nihilo, nihil fit tells us that if a quantity comes into being, there must be some source of that quantity. For example, scientists agree that all 'real' forces must have a material origin. This works for non-scientific situations as well. When change is thought of in quantitative terms, it becomes quite natural to ask</page><page sequence="14">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 427 for the origin of that change (or new quantity). So, in seeking the cause of a change that takes place, we are essentially seeking its source or contributor. But this is another way of saying that quantities (e.g. mo mentum and energy) within a system are conserved. I should like to emphasize that if the reader finds the above talk of fields and the momentum and energy they possess quite unintelligible, it does not follow that the use of the notion of cause in such scientific locutions is an extension of a more 'primitive and fundamental meaning' of 'cause' or that such a use is extraordinary. On the contrary, I have attempted to show that the uneasiness the layman might feel with the expression, 'Gravity causes unsupported bodies to fall' is more readily explained by the occurrence of the word 'gravity' - a word which is bound to make the layman feel uneasy because of its connections with technical concepts such as 'energy', 'momentum', 'field', et al. - than by the oc currence of the word 'cause' which, Gasking believes, is given an extended use. The conditions set forth in section three are able to account for a vast array of causal phenomena. They make meaningful uses of 'cause' in the science of mechanics and supply us with a non-anthropomorphic means for determining the direction of the causal relation. In addition, they are able to account for a core of cases which the manipulation model can not handle. Finally, conditions one through three enable us to unify causal locutions in scientific and ordinary contexts while nullifying the claim that the use of 'cause' in the sciences is vague or parisitic on 'manipulation'. (I'll return to this in the last section.) In conclusion, I find that Gasking's claim that 'Gravity causes un supported bodies to fall' is not on par with 'Great heat causes steel to melt' is false. Both cases are explicable by conditions one through three. The former has just been discussed. The latter can be viewed in terms of heat energy from the heat source being transferred to kinetic energy in the molecules of the iron. Likewise, some people may say that heating iron causes it to glow and not vice versa because human beings have a mani pulative technique for making iron hot but not for making it glow.28 But one should establish this cause-effect asymmetry, instead, by pointing out that heat energy (say, of the furnace) has been converted into kinetic energy of photons (given off by the metal) and not vice versa. However, I do not wish to deny that there is a close connection between causation</page><page sequence="15">428 JERROLD L. ARONSON and manipulation, for, very often, if A causes B to occur, then we can bring about B by manipulating A. But this does not mean that manipula tion is fundamental for distinguishing cause from effect. I have argued that the conditions presented above are fundamental instead. VII In the beginning of this paper, I mentioned that there are philosophers who advocate the elimination of 'cause' from science and philosophy. For example, consider this recommendation of Bertrand Russell's: The word "cause" is so inextricably bound up with misleading associations as to make its complete extrusion from the philosophical vocabulary desireable.29 Collingwood believes that any use of that term which is free from con ceptual confusions is anthropomorphic in nature, either involving human action or human control of nature. Russell attacks the notion of cause by criticising (a criticism that Collingwood eagerly takes up) the doctrine of necessity in nature. However, if my analysis of 'cause' holds true, then those criticisms presented by Collingwood and Russell are beside the point; for causal propositions are not anthropomorphic in nature, nor are they expressions of necessity (e.g. compulsion) in nature. Rather, 'cause' is a dimension word for transitive verbs, and I have maintained that transitive verb talk need not be anthropomorphic, especially if I am correct in maintaining that they are used to describe various forms of transference in nature. Since the notion of'cause' is so related to transitive verbs, I think those who maintain that 'cause' should be removed from scientific and philosophical discourse are, ipso facto, committed to the removal of transitive verbs - which occur often enough in the sciences - as well. Perhaps transitive verbs can be removed from our vocabulary. One might wish to argue, for example, that they should be eliminated in terms that describe combinations or configurations of motions. Thus, sentences that contain transitive verbs can be reparsed into sentences that describe a unique configuration or pattern of motions between bodies. The above recommendation may work, but I see no a priori reason why it should. In fact, all attempts to do this have failed so far.30 However, even if such a task were successful in "eliminating" transitive verbs and 'cause' from our</page><page sequence="16">ON THE GRAMMAR OF 'CAUSE' 429 vocabulary, it seems that scientists (and others) would continue to speak of the various sources of quantitative change. Physicists would still insist on talking about energy and momentum transfer; and, as I have pointed out above, this talk is wedded to conservation principles. For these reasons, alone, removal of 'cause' (and its more specific counterparts) from science and philosophy is a price, I believe, that scientist and nonscientist alike would not be willing to pay.

Austin, Sense and Sensibilia, Oxford University Press, London, 1962, p. 71. 9 The objective complement is defined as an adjective or noun or the equivalent of either which completes the action expressed in the verb and modifies or qualifies the direct object; not only does the objective complement complete the verb, it also describes the state of the object that results from the action performed. 10 There are philosophers who are quick to point out that 'cause' is rarely used in the theoretical sciences, as if this were evidence for its being an unscientific notion. How ever, there is a better explanation: the scientist and layman alike tend to substitute other words for 'cause', not because that concept if somehow vague or misleading, but because 'cause' is a dimension-word and, most often, they prefer to use a more specific term. But it doesn't follow from this that the word 'cause' should be avoided or that it loses its utility. One might argue in the same way that 'real' should be removed from the language. II Connection statements are an interesting subclass of transitive verb statements. Let us define a connection as an element in a system that maintains or brings other elements into relations. For example, a rod may serve to connect two other rods by maintaining a constant distance between their endpoints. In other words, rod C holds A and B together. So, in the case of connection statements, the direct object phrase refers to two or more entities while an objective complement designates a relation between them.

Peirce Society 3 (1969) 158-171.</page><page sequence="17">430 JERROLD L. ARONSON 12 I am certain that the above phrase structure transformation is too sketchy to cover the complete syntax of causative verbs. For a more sophisticated and detailed syn tactical approach on the grammar of transitive verbs, see Noam Chomsky's 'A Trans formational Approach to Syntax', in Jerry A. Fodor and Jerrold J. Katz feds.), The Structure of Language, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1964, pp. 211-245, as well as his Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1965, pp.102-106;189-192. 13 In Jean Piaget's The Child's Conception of Physical Causality, Littlefield, Adams, Paterson, N.J., 1960, he relates several cases of children attempting to explain the mechanisms of bicycles (pp. 195-212). The interesting aspect about these examples concerns the fact that the failure of each child to explain how the bicycle worked was not due to a lack of observation or to ignorance of a law of nature but it essentially reflected a general inability to master the use of various transitive verbs. (I discuss these cases in my 'Explanations without Laws', The Journal of Philosophy 66 (1969) 554-555.) 14 Collier-Macmillan, London; Free Press, New York, 1965, pp. 347-354. 15 Cf. B. A. O.

However, even if this distinction is relative to one's framework, it does not follow that there is, in fact, no distinction to be drawn between two kinds of change. 21 A. d'Abro, The Rise of the New Physics, Dover, New York, 1939, p. 223. 22 I owe this example to Fred I. Dretske. 23 I borrowed this expression from A. Michotte (op. cit., p. 144) who uses it to describe situations where the movement of the effect object is independent of the active object "but remains dependent on it for its origin." 24 Talk of transference of a quantity may make one balk since it presupposes the intelligibility of one quantity being the same although a different thing now possesses it. In answer to this I can only say that the identity conditions for 'motion', 'energy' and 'momentum' are not the same as for particles; otherwise, we would have to speak of energy and momentum being destroyed in one entity and recreated in another. This would lead to equally unhappy results and fails to express what the scientist is saying. 25 M. Von Laue, 'Inertia and Energy', in P. A.

It was shown, however, that his definition will not work for n ^ 5 bodies. (See Max Jammer, Concepts of Force, Harper and Row, New York, 1962, p. 246.
