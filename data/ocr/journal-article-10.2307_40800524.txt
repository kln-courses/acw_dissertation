P.</page><page sequence="17">1 INTRODUCTION This WORK DISCUSSES the architectural history of the Central Palace Sanctuary Area at the Palace of Knossos and reassesses its function through a study of architecture and finds. The Early History of the Site The Kephala hill, later known as Knossos, attracted the attention of Minos Kalokairinos, a local antiquarian. Kalokairinos opened twelve trenches in what was later recognized as the West Wing of the Palace.1 The work was soon stopped by the authorities. Most of the finds from Kalokairinos's excavation were published by the French archaeologist Hassoullier2 and the German scholar Fabricius.3 Some were sent to a few major European museums.4 The rest were destroyed when Kalokairinos' house, where they were kept, was bombed and burnt by the Turks in one of the periodic disturbances. Many scholars, who visited the site and saw the objects, tried to gain permission to excavate, among them Stillman5 and Schliemann.6 Arthur Evans succeeded, having bought part of the site in 1894.7 In 1900 he managed to buy the whole hill, a condition necessary to excavate.8 Excavation began on 23 March 1900 (PLATE 2).9 Duncan Mackenzie acted as assistant, keeping the Day Books of the excavation; Theodore Fyfe was the architect responsible for preparing plans, sections and drawings. A great part of the Palace was uncovered in the first season, although it lasted only two months. Among the first parts to be investigated was what is now known as the West Wing of the Palace, the central part of which is The Central Palace Sanctuary' (PLATE 3, FIG. 48; PLAN I in pocket).10 In 1901 the excavation season lasted about four months, starting at the end of February. The £Room of the Two Cists',11 later to be termed the Temple Repositories Room, was opened, together with a space just to its E. Here there was a small niche between the lines of the earlier 1 Hood 1981, 1; 1987b, 85-6, 91; Kopaka 1990, 7-69; Driessen 1990, 14-43. 2 Hassoullier 1880, 124-7. 3 Fabricius 1886, 139, Taf. Ill; see also Kopaka 1992, 382-^. 4 Hood (1981, 1) wrote: 'Kalokairinos presented three of the pithoi to foreign museums, in London, Paris and Rome, and one, now in the National Museum in Athens . . . Three more went to the Archaeological Collection . . . the embryo of the present Museum in Heraklion.' 5 Evans 1899-1900, 4; Hood 1981, 1; 1987b, 89. 6 Evans 1900, 4; Hood 1981, 1-2 ; 1987b, 03. 7 1 had found the contract in the part of the Turkish Archives kept in the State Archive (Ipothikofilakion) in Heraklion. It is in Turkish and was translated for me by Dr V Dimitriades (Institude for Mediterranean Studies, Crete) for which I am grateful. It will appear in a forthcoming publication on the property of Sir A. Evans at Knossos. 8 Evans 1899-1900, 4-5; although Evans said that he bought 'the whole', there is no contract found to prove this purchase. Since there are letters in the Ashmolean (I thank Mrs Anne Brown for this information) speaking of the purchase and of the sum paid, it is possible that both Evans and the local authorities were satisfied with a preliminary contract and the final contract was never signed since the Turks left the island in the meantime. 9 Evans i8qq-iqoo, cl. 10 The only room not excavated in the first season was the Temple Repositories Room. 11 Evans 1899-1900, 27.</page><page sequence="18">2 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS East Façade wall and the later E line of orthostats, which both run along the W side of the Central Court. A second door (the northern one) leading from the Lobby of the Stone Seat into the East Pillar Crypt was recognized;12 the E-W corridor south of the two Pillar Crypts, previously believed to have been a blind alley,13 was found to lead into the House Tablets Corridor. The Lobby of the Stone Seat is thus directly connected with the Magazines to the W (PLATE 4).^ In the 1903 campaign the gypsum floors of the magazines were lifted, revealing cists underneath.15 That same year gypsum floors in other rooms were lifted, among them the Vat Room and the Temple Repositories. In the preliminary report the area occupied by the two Pillar Crypts and the rooms N of them (the Great Pithos Room, Temple Repositories, Lobby of the Stone Seat and the small niche N of it) was called the 'Central Palace Sanctuary'.16 The idea causes no surprise since, even in 1900, Evans had spoken of the importance of the Pillar Crypts with their central pillars carved with double axes.17 He pointed to the West Pillar Crypt as the 'actual shrine, since the double-axe symbol appears in this case on all four sides of the pillar instead of only three. It is observable that while the West room was otherwise clear, the adjoining chamber to the E had been partly used as a store such as might well have existed in connection with a sanctuary'.18 On 28 May 1903, 19 'the Great Stone Repositories of the Central Palace Sanctuary'20 were opened and the excavators were faced with what they immediately referred to as the 'fittings of a small shrine'.21 Successes and Limitations No prehistorian can remain unmoved reading the accounts of the excavation of this area, whether the diaries or publications. As one who had completed a MA thesis22 on Minoan Domestic and Palace Shrines, the Central Palace Sanctuary area was an object of compelling attraction to me. Thus I began a Ph.D. thesis on the Central Palace Sanctuary area for the University of London under Professor J. N. Coldstream. I soon became aware, however, of two major problems. Firstly the published discussions were inadequate. The most important finds published by Evans could be easily recognized. Others, however, photographed in groups and often not to scale, were more difficult to recognize. All too often Evans would refer to objects, but not illustrate them; worse, he would occasionally imply their existence, but offer no account of their numbers or descriptions. These, I feared, would be almost impossible to identify. The second problem was their present location. Although most of the published objects were recorded in the Heraklion Museum catalogues, they could not be located in the museum stores today, after their removal to a place of safety during the Second World War and their subsequent return to different positions. In addition, some of the catalogued objects had slipped among the uncatalogued and unprovenanced material. Recourse to the 12 Although Evans (i 900-1, 27-8) never implied that the door was blocked, Driessen saw it so in his hypothetical fourth architectural phase (1990, fig. 12) and so did Hallager (1987, 176). 13 Evans 1 899-1 900, 26. 14 Evans 1900-01, 27 and 49: 'The supposed isolation on this side does not exist.' 15 Evans 1902-3, 28-35. 16 Evans 1902-3, 32-4. 17 Evans 1899-1900, 32-4. 10 Evans 1 899-1 900, 34. ■9 Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, 86. 20 Evans 1902-3, 38.

A related, though slightly lesser problem applies to the inventories of the Ashmolean Museum, in Oxford. So I turned to published and unpublished photographs relevant to my research from the Ashmolean archives. Often, Evans photographed as a group pieces from the same find-spot. With the aid of unpublished photographs a few pieces could be identified. The pursuit brought rewards, some quite unexpected. In 1989, when I had given up hope of finding anything else, I came upon a tiny paper box in HM, bearing the legend (in a small and neat hand, probably Prof. N. Platon's), of 'Wats Room' - clearly a misspelling of Vat Room (see Chapter 2). Within were the long sought-after 'cobalt blue beads,'23 together with some larger ones, a crystal core, two seal impressions, fragments of copper and shell, and ostrich egg (most published by Evans, but not catalogued in HM). Through this find it was possible to identify beads of the same kind in the Ashmolean together with more pieces of copper. In the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos I identified a few faience objects as coming from the Temple Repositories. I also found material from deposits in the Central Palace Sanctuary area, which had not been published or even mentioned in the notebooks. None of these deposits can be safely associated with the walls of the Central Palace Sanctuary as they now stand. Also in the Ashmolean a small pill-box containing carbonized corn was identified by its label 'Porcelain Deposit, burnt corn'.24 Four gold foil fragments in the shape of plant leaves were identified by their general resemblance to others, from this area, housed in Heraklion. The culmination of many years of searching and my greatest reward came early in 1990, when Vasso Fotou drew to my attention a few loose pages with sketches by Evans. They were unpublished and unknown sketches and notes, by Evans, of material from the Temple Repositories.25 A few objects, previously in doubt, have now been confirmed thanks to these notes. But, most importantly, it has now become clear, thanks to these notes, that Evans had confused the number of the different impressions of the sealings with the actual number of the sealings.26 Although a few objects remain unlocated, many (previously unknown) appear here for the first time. Among them some pithos fragments stored in Rooms A and B of the Central Palace Sanctuary (see Chapter 4). The detailed study of the architecture is based on the excavation notebooks, sketches and plans and my own observations of the area. In February-March 1995 I was allowed to make three soundings in the Vat Room and the East Pillar Crypt, which proved of great importance for the architectural history of the area.27 However, more such soundings are 23 Evans 1902-3, 98. 24 Both Evans and Mackenzie referred to the Temple Repositories deposit as 'Porcelain Deposit' (DM/DB 1903 90, 30 May and for Evans, see Panagiotaki 1993, 49-50, fig. ia) and Evans (1902-3, 41) recorded burnt corn found in them. 25 Panaeriotaki 1993, 4Q-Q1. 2(5 Though Evans published most of the designs of the seal impressions (1902-3, figs. 28-38; 1921, figs. 363 a-b, 372, 374, 411 a-b, 456 a-c, 509, 514, 518 a-1, 519, 520, 522 a, 524; 1935, figs. 423, 451, 531, 541 a, 544 a, 597 a, e, 604 a-b, 921), which Gill identified later (1965, 69-71, 73-4), a few sealings remained undetected, and it was unclear how many in all there were.

This study is thus based on my Ph.D. thesis but it includes material which was recognized later, as well as the results of the three soundings made in 1995. The Nature of the Written Sources and Scholarly Research The original excavators left two classes of evidence. First come the writings produced on site: the Note Books of Evans (AE/NB and AE/LsPgs),28 the Day Books kept by Mackenzie (DM/DB),29 together with his pottery notes from the apotheke, and the plans and sketches produced by Fyfe (Fyfe/SkB).3° Together with these are the photographs, now housed in the Archives of the Ashmolean Museum in both negative and print form (PhEvans). From all these Evans worked up a second set of sources: the annual excavation reports (BSA 1900-1903), articles, lectures and The Palace of Minos (1921-36). Mackenzie was primarily concerned with writing the details of the excavation each day, a task of utmost importance, but in reality impossible for a single person to accomplish, given the number of trenches open at a number of locations across the site. Inevitably he missed details; and sadly some of his books are mislaid. Despite these drawbacks, Mackenzie offered a general picture of events as the excavation unfolded; finds were recorded, often with an accompanying sketch to give their position on plan, and a note to say if they were on a floor or in a fill. Only the depth tended not to be mentioned, a practice adopted later. After objects had been cleaned, Mackenzie might add a further note. Evans made short and precise notes, often reproducing what Mackenzie had written. His main concern seems rather to have been in the sketching (with annotations) of the more interesting finds; he had a very good eye for detail and a considerable artistic skill to reproduce what he saw on paper. He was particularly good on very small objects. His notes may also give details of numbers and type. To a degree, thus, this pair of capable people complemented each other's strengths. Fyfe's detailed plans and sketches, together with contemporary photographs, are invaluable in assessing the exact nature of the site as it was revealed. The initial yearly Reports, presented best in the BSA, are the nearest Evans came to what would be recognized as an excavation report today. The monumental Palace of Minos is in many respects an encyclopaedia of sources and ideas on the Aegean Bronze Age, and the Cretan in particular, as represented at Knossos. Evans's skill at synthesizing and presenting an interwoven account of the many strands that he uses to create his 'history' of this period is consummate, often delicate in its control and given free rein. He also established the chronology of the period, dividing it up into Early Minoan (EM), Middle (MM) and Late (LM),31 usually with ever finer subdivisions (I, II, III at first and then A, B, C). He also produced extended articles and monographs on topics first broached in the early reports: thus 28 Evans AE/NBs concerned with the CPS: 1900 (1 vol.); 1901 (1 vol.); 1902 (1 vol.); 1903 (1 notebook with drawings of objects from the Vat Room Deposit and loose pages of drawings of objects from the Temple Repositories); 19 13 (1 vol.); 1925 (1 vol.); 1929 (1 vol.) 1930 (1 vol.). 29 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900 (3 vols., two in pencil and one in ink - the ink version is used in this study); 1901 (2 vols.); 1903 (2 vols.); 1904 (i vol.); 1907 (i vol.); 1925 (1 vol.).

In 1909 he produced Scripta Minoa /, about the inscribed clay Tablets and other objects of clay. The passage of time brought some problems. As concerns the Central Palace Sanctuary, in particular the Temple Repositories, discrepancies arose about the find-spots of a few faience objects and the seal impressions. In the original notes, they were assigned to the East Temple Repository; by the time The Palace of Minos was brought out, they had moved to the West one. Such lapses of memory are to be expected after so long a gap of time; Evans also, on occasion, misread his notes. Generally, it is safer to follow the early accounts, the more so when Evans and Mackenzie are in agreement. (Discrepancies will be discussed in detail below in the appropriate place). Since The Palace of Minos many scholars have written about the Central Palace Sanctuary, usually about the Temple Repositories finds and, to a lesser extent, the Vat Room Deposit and the Tripartite Shrine. Writers on the Vat Room Deposit pottery include, besides Evans, Pendlebury,32 Walberg,« Hood,34 Andreou,35 MacGillivray,36 Momigliano37 and Cadogan.38 The rest of the material has never been studied. The Minoan vases from the Temple Repositories have been considered, in addition to Evans and Mackenzie, by Piaton,39 Popham,4° Walberg,41 Warren and Hankey,42 and the Cycladic Bird vases by MacGillivray43 and Jones.44 Evans45 published most of the clay documents, i.e. seal impressions, noduli and roundels and Gill4() identified many of those in the Heraklion Museum, Kenna47 others in the Ashmolean. Younger48 and Pini49 have dated them, while Weingarten50 has discussed their role in the administration. With Pini,51 she infers their function from the undersides of the impressions, which reveal to which types of package they were attached. The roundels and their place in administrative procedures, have been studied by Hallager;52 he has examined the signs inscribed on them and compared them with known scripts, and has also studied the sealings.53 Foster54 has presented a general study of Bronze Age Aegean faience and with Kaczmarczyk she published analyses of the pieces in the Ashmolean.55 No other finds from the Temple Repositories have been studied since Evans. Of the material associated with the final architectural phase of the CPS, some of the clay documents have been studied by Gill,56 and the Linear B tablets from the Lobby of the Stone Seat and elsewhere studied by Chadwick et al.,57 Godart et ¿z/.,58 Olivier and Killen.59 {2 Pendlebury 1939, 104. :w Walberg 1976, 104, 121 -2. :14 Hood 1974, 34; 1988, no 11. :53 Andreou 1978, 180 n.6. :5&lt;&gt; MacGillivray 1086, 47. 57 Momigliano 19QI, 167 7^. :*8 Cadoean et. al. iqq^, 218. w Platon 10,73, 241 w . 4" Popham IQ70, 226. 41 Walberg iQQ2, 12 13, 115. 42 Warren and Hankey 1989, 72 4. 4;&lt; MacGillivrav 10,84., 1^-4.. 44 Jones 1986, 430-1. 43 Evans 1902-3, 51 60, 88-90; 192 1, 496, 689, 694 700. 4() Gill 196^, 69-70. 47 Kenna i960, 41 4. 48 Younger 1989, tä q. 49 Pini 199°, 53- 3&lt;) Weingarten 1986a, b; 1988, 1-19; 1989, 39-52; 1990a, 95 105; 1990b, 105-20; 1994, 181 3. 31 Pini 1983, 560-2; in a forthcoming piece of work Pini interprets the details of the underside of sealings. &gt;-' Hallager 1987, tt-jo: iqq6. 3:1 Hallagcr iqq6. 34 Foster 1979, 56-93. 33 Foster and Kacmarczyk 1082, 14.3 ^7. 3&lt;&gt; Gill 1965, 73. 37 Chadwick, Killen &amp; Olivier 1971, 168 81; iq8q, 17^-01. 38 Godart et al. 1976 85. 3&lt;) Olivier 1973; and 1994, 157 70; Killen 1989, 175-91; and !992, 351 63-</page><page sequence="22">6 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS On the function of the CPS area, Hallager considered it to be 'one of the main sacred areas in the later Minoan period', but rejected cult continuity stating that 'in this area at Knossos the "religious" element had ceased to exist by the time of the final destruction'.60 Begg, in contrast, argued for continuity on the evidence of the finds.61 Other scholars, such as Nilsson,62 Platon,63 Rutkowski,64 Gesell65 and Driessen66 have also written on the function of the area, basing their arguments mainly on Evans's published accounts. Hallager67 and Driessen68 have considered the architectural history of the area and produced hypothetical plans of the different architectural phases they proposed. As shown in this work, the architectural and stratigraphical evidence that we have is so fragmentary, that any attempt to distinguish architectural phases and produce plans exemplifying them must remain hypothetical. The Central Palace Sanctuary is directly connected with other areas, which have not been considered by me. Such are the Room of the Chariot Tablets to the south, and accessed through a polythyron from the Lobby of the Stone Seat; the House Tablets Corridor and ultimately the West Magazines. The last are reached through the E-W Corridor south of the Crypts, and perhaps by a door (now blocked) in Room A; another possible doorway would have given access to the Room of the Jewel Fresco to the N.69 The failure to pursue these is regretted - in particular the Chariot Tablets Room, with its stone and clay lamps70 as well as the archive material - but the complexity of the room, and the fact that it is part of another larger, not well defined, complex have deterred me. In this I do but follow Evans's judgement, for he too, in his tripartite division of the West Wing into insulae, excluded this region from the 'West Central Insula, Middle', my starting point.71 In addition, it is worth while pointing out that the Chariot Tablets Room has formed the subject of a complete study, that of Driessen.72 I also considered that the southern position of the tablets in the Corridor of the House tablets put them outside my brief. Although I have included in this work all the finds from the CPS some require further study and they will be the subject of separate articles. These are: the Neolithic pottery, the obsidian, the pithoi of the last period, the natural sea shells, the gold leaf and the faience objects. In Chapters 2 and 3 the study of the objects does not follow the same order; each chapter opens with the most important objects and closes with the second in rank. 60 Hallager 1987, 173, 176.

The aim is to understand better the function of this area before the gypsum paving was laid. The discovery of cists under the gypsum paving in the West Magazines and Long Gallery prompted, in 1903, an investigation beneath the similar floor in the CPS (PLAN I - in pocket).1 That is how the Vat Room Deposit (VRD) and the Temple Repositories (TR) came to light.2 Similar investigations continued in subsequent years but, as most of them were not published, or recorded in the excavation diaries, we do not know how many test pits were opened. However, from the published accounts of the VRD,3 and Pendlebury's guide to the Stratigraphical Museum4 (KSM), we may safely suggest that floor slabs were lifted at random in each room and trenches dug down to about one metre. The exact dimensions of these trenches have not been recorded. Apart from the VRD, Pendlebury5 recorded material from eight more deposits as coming from the CPS (see below - deposits in inverted commas). Among these, however, 'Test Pit S. of Central Stairs. 0.-.60 (boulders)' and 'Magazine S. of W. Pillar Room, ist m.' may have been wrongly allocated to the CPS area (see the appropriate sections). 'Wall S. of Central Stairs', comes from the Tripartite Shrine area, and not below the gypsum floors. One more deposit was listed by Evans6 as from the Great Pithos Room, from a trench that was opened around half the circumference of the Great Pithos. The material has not been found, apart from a few obsidian fragments in the Ashmolean (131). One other deposit recovered by Hutchinson and Platon7 is also unidentified. Recent stratigraphical tests conducted by the author will also be discussed. The full analytical study will appear later, when all the planned stratigraphical tests in the CPS have been completed. The following deposits from the CPS Area will be examined here, and compared to the VRD, which will be discussed first. 1 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. i, 86, 28 May) wrote: 'Having fairly well exhausted the possibilities of finds in the cists of the great store-room region we turned our attention elsewhere. As a working rule we adhered to the principle that throughout the palace where ever there was pavement, there might be a cist beneath the pavement'. 2 The VRD material had been placed in a pit (it is here argued), while the TR was in two stone cists, see Chapter 3. The TR material forms a chapter on its own, only because of its sheer size. 3 For the Vat Room see Evans 1002-3, Q4--8: 1021, 16^-71. * Pendlebury 1933-35, 14 (boxes: 750, 751, 752, 754, 756, 758). 5 Pendlebury iq1^-^, 14. 6 Evans 1935, 635. 7 Cook 1946, 1 17-18, fig. 7; Platon 1954, 433; Hutchinson 1962, 165, 171.</page><page sequence="24">8 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS i.

The VAT Room Deposit Though this region was investigated and the deposit recovered in 1903, Mackenzie's two notebooks of that season give no record of the work or of the finds. Was he too busy elsewhere to make notes, or has the account been lost? Evans, however, did produce sketches of many of the objects, together with the brief comment: 'Early Minoan Deposit N of E Pillar room. Immediately under pavement within space of about 1 mtr., going down into Neolithic III out of which hole had been cut'.8 Later Evans9 was equally terse about the findspot of the deposit, observing only that the objects were 'beneath the pavement at the entrance of the early Magazine that opens North of the East Pillar Room (see plan, fig. 121) known as the "Room of the Stone Vats".' Pendlebury placed the deposit near the cist against the N wall of the Vat Room.10 In my thesis11 I put forward the idea that it may have come from the middle of the room, where there was modern concrete; but the recent excavation there proved it had not (see below). Only re-excavation can give the exact location of the deposit. The only secure information on the dimensions of the 'hole' in which the objects were found, is its depth, 1 m. As Momigliano12 has pointed out, it must have been at least a cubic metre inside to judge from the amount of material recovered. Although Evans13 said specifically that the material came from a pit and further stated that the pit had a plaster facing,14 MacGillivray15 has suggested that the finds belonged to a series of Old Palace floors running under the stone paving of the entire area. His theory was prompted by Evans's statement16 that the finds were 'superposed, however, on these earlier remains . .'. But Momigliano17 supported Evans, principally because a trial trench opened in the Room of the Niche (RN)18 found Neolithic layers directly under the floor level, but also because most of the VRD vases are perfectly preserved and therefore unlikely to come from a floor deposit. This idea is further supported by most of the tests by Evans, published here for the first time, and by the recent work of the present author in the Vat Room. Two trenches opened (one at the centre of the Vat Room and the other at the south part of the entrance into it) reached Neolithic immediately.19 8 On Evans's notes see Panagiotaki; 1998a, 167-84. 9 Evans 1021, 16^. 10 Pendlebury 1933-5, fig. 9. 11 Panagiotaki 1991, 35-6. 12 Momigliano 1991, 167. '3 Evans AE/NB 1903, 2; 1902-3, 94; 1921, 165; see also Mackenzie (1906, 252) who called it a 'pit deposit'. 14 Evans (1921, 236) wrote: 'In some cases, as that of the deposit beneath the Vat Room at Knossos, and that of the Third Magazine, mere pits, excavated in the Neolithic clay, with at most a plaster facing, were used as receptacles'. '5 MacGillivray (from Momigliano, 1991, 168) 1986, 49. 16 Evans 1002-3, 04. 17 Momigliano 1991, 169. 18 Hood 1988, 69; 1994, fig. 1 (Test FII io); Momigliano 1991, 168. '9 Panagiotaki 1996, 40.</page><page sequence="25">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS g Thus, the evidence I present in this chapter, which includes mainly material from the wide spread of trenches Evans opened in the area, vindicates his observation that 'the floor levels of the "Later Palace" rest directly on the Neolithic clay, very little belonging to the earlier, intervening Minoan Age being traceable, except where such remains were found in pits or cists. . .'.20 Hood's tests in the West Wing in 1973 support this view: 'Almost everywhere in the West Wing later palace floors seem to rest immediately on top of Neolithic or EM I- II deposits'.21 One exception is the Great Pithos Room in which Evans22 found an earlier plaster floor, on which the^öreat Pithos sits. In his publications Evans23 concentrated on just some types of find (such as the clay vases), and only alluded to others, with remarks such as 'among the stone vases'. I have paid particular attention to the objects he did not discuss. A number of them have been identified, but I have been unable to find certain of the pieces he illustrated in PM: the pedestalled cup with 'polychrome red and white bands' and the bowl;24 the knob-like object (below the block of obsidian) and the gold fragment.25 As compensation, however, there may be new pieces to include in the group, which are in boxes that clearly contain published objects from the VRD. In KSM there are many pieces of obsidian, copper and rock crystal in those boxes, which hold the published vases.26 In HM there is rather more: obsidian, and various stone pieces. Among the uncatalogued material is a small container with the label 'cppéocp T| Stone Wats Room Knossos'.27 Inside is a large number of the beads Evans described as 'deep cobalt blue',28 together with larger faience beads and plaques; also a cylindrical rock crystal core,29 two more fragments of 'white shell',30 some of ivory, copper fragments,31 a piece of 'ostrich' egg and two seal impressions.32 In another box, 24, fragments of 'ostrich' egg were identified. And in the AM are other finds, apart from clay vases (beads, copper fragments and stone objects) that may come from the VRD. The Finds pottery The vases will be discussed individually with attention being paid to potential function. I shall start with the whole vases in coarse or semicoarse ware: Coarse / Semicoarse Ware Amphorae (FIG. 1; PLATE 1 6, c). Four amphorae of globular-cylindrical type were found (1-4). 33 They have a motif incised on their shoulders: a rectangle with crossing diagonal lines - a 20 Evans 1902-3, 04. 21 Hood 1074, 34. 22 Evans 1935, 635. 23 Evans 192 1, 170. 24 Evans 1921, 167, fig. 118a .7, 16. 25 Evans 1921, 169, fig. 120. 26 The published vases are in boxes (K.03) FII 3, 750 and 751; with them are 60 obsidian fragments. 27 The name of Hogarth is mentioned on the other side of the box, as the excavator. Since the box contained published pieces from the VRD such as the rock crystal bore core (83), the sealings (106-108) and the beads (120), there is no question about the provenance of this material; whether all the material in the box comes from the same source remains debatable. 28 Evans 1902-3, 98; 1921, 170, fig. 120, middle in small bowl. 29 Evans 1Q02-3. 08: 1021. no. fier. nob. 30 Evans (1902-3, 95) wrote: 'the remains of a mosaic of shell plaques'; also 1Q21, 170, fig. 120. 31 Evans 1902-3, 98. 32 Evans IQ21, fig. nqc. 33 Evans drew two amphorae in his notebook (AE/NB 1903, 2), the same ones shown in fig. 66c, o (also seen in Evans 1902-3, 96.9,10). Next to the first drawing he wrote: '[pi] dull red slip round 31 cm h. incised' ['5 +] plain 1 plain'. Number '5+', although crossed out, may refer to the whole amphorae Evans saw. Just below the following is crossed out by Evans: 'Same c. 33 cm other 30'.

Two fragments (5-5A) in the AM, probably from similar vessels, also have incised decoration of two triangles joined at their apices to create a 'bow-tie' effect recalling the double axe, a religious symbol and a Linear A sign, meaning A'.35 The third whole amphora (3) is included because it is like 1 and 2 and is stored together with two of the necked jars (see below).36 The fourth (4) is recorded in the KSM catalogue as coming from the shrine area, but was included here because it carries the number of one of the boxes containing many of the VRD objects37 and also because its shape and type fit with those from the same deposit. Amphorae are good for transporting or storing liquids, and for pouring. Similar vessels were still used in Crete in the 1950s to carry olive oil, offered at churches, and are still used in Cretan villages today for drawing and carrying water, keeping it cool, and for storing wine and olive oil. They also take on a magical role in a midsummer rite connected with water, fruit and fortune- telling.38 Could the VRD vessels have had a similar secondary purpose? If one sees the incised motif as a double axe (incised on four of the vases), a symbolic value is likely. Evans thought that vases inscribed with Linear A signs were 'of a votive character'.39 Evans40 dated the amphorae to EM in his first report, and later to MM Ia. Andreou41 placed them in MM Ib/IIa (Early Kamares), Walberg42 in MM Ia (Pre-Kamares) and Momigliano43 in MM IIa. In the most recent terminology of Cadogan44 et ai, an MM IB date would seem likely, and would broadly agree with Andreou and Momigliano. Necked Jars (FIGS. 1, 2; PLATES 1 ¿z, 2 ¿z, 6, c). Eight whole, or almost whole, necked jars (6-13) and fragments of another (13A) were found.45 Some are included here only because they are like the known VRD ones and are listed in the HM catalogues together with them.46 11 (PLATE 1 a) is in the AM47 while 12-13 and 13A are in the KSM.48 34 Evans 1921, 642, fig. 476.55: L 43; being on its own it is certainly not part of an inscription; it may stand for a whole word (see note below). The same mark was found incised on a loomweight at Petras, see Tsipopoulou (1990, 100, fig. 3.15 and 1996, 931-71) who also speaks on the significance and interpretation of 'potters' marks'. See also Owens 1990-91, 370-2, especially n.12. My warm thanks to Mr G. Owens for discussions on the Linear A signs; similar marks were also found on vases in Quartier Mu (Poursat 1978). 35 On the double axe as a Linear A sign see Evans 1921, 643, fig. 474 c; as a 'mason's mark' see Hood 1987a, 205-12 and fig. 5; as a religious symbol see Nilsson 1950, 194-235; and Gesell 1985, 62. The double axe is also seen on Early Dynastic vases in Egypt but its meaning is not clear there either; it has been suggested that it may indicate the workshop, but certainly not the signature of the artist since it is repeated for many dynasties (Hood 10,87a, 211 comment by W. Helck). 36 The third amphora (HM 4497) appears here for the first time first, because Evans recorded more than '5' amphorae in his notes, second, because it was recorded together with the other amphorae of the deposit and it also belongs with them stylistically, see footnote 4-6. 37 F II&lt;* box 7^0. 38 On 23 June, St John's Eve, an ordinary amphora becomes a 'klidonas': an amphora which reveals the fortune of the people who perform special rites for St John; on 'Klidonas' rites performed on ist May in Cyprus see Ohnefalsch- Richter 1893, 12 1-2. The Cretan rites differ only slightly. 39 Evans iQ2i, b^q. 40 Evans 1902-3, 96, fig. 66c, o, 1; 192 1, 168, fig. n8a.4, 15, 19. 41 Andreou 1978, 180 n.6, 187 n.23. 42 Walbersr 1Q76, 122. 43 Momigliano 1991, 169. 44 Cadogan et al. 1993, 21-7. 45 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 2a) wrote: 'Plain red ware 31 cm. 3 Smaller pale clay - 1'.

Their neck is tall enough to hold a (flanged) lid, or to have a leather or cloth cover tied on it; and as their handles tilt upwards, they could be hung up from the roof to give further protection to their contents. Jar 6 contained c. 500 g of buff-grey soil, which may have been soil in the VRD pit, which Evans left in the vase on purpose.49 Vase (7) contained a few g of the same soil, further supporting the idea. When sifted, the soil from jar 6 yielded charcoal, ash, fragments of white-buff plaster with plant impressions, tiny sherds from pots like those in the VRD group, a few animal and fish bones, pieces of sea shell, two angular fragments of rock crystal,50 and a scrap of gold leaf. About 100 g, on flotation, produced three pollen-like objects, probably from plants that like water.51 The combination of ash, charred wood, plaster, and that a few of the vases (2, 7, 9) exhibit strong traces of burning, may imply destruction by fire of a building here or nearby. Recent excavations within the Palace (Hood and Macdonald), and immediately W of it (Macdonald), have shown a destruction and fire contemporary with the VRD.52 This destruction occurred early in the Old Palace Period, probably in MM IB or IIa. Evans53 argued that the Old Palace was finally destroyed in MM IlB. Evans assigned the vases to MM I.54 Momigliano rightly pointed out that they are like vessels in MM Ia deposits, but are also similar to a vessel in a MM IIa-IIIa context.55 Bowls (fig. 2). Three bowls (14-16) are known, two with a flaring rim and one with a spout.56 Like cups, bowls are useful in domestic and cult contexts. Handled bowls were placed by Evans57 in his MM Ia phase; the shallow specimen is close to MM Ia-B types but continued in production into MM IIA.58 Lids (FIG. 2; PLATE 1 a). Two flanged lids were found: one has two perforated lugs (17), the other is perforated on top (18) and has a dark wash with crossing white lines.59 They probably covered jars. Evans placed them in MM.6° 49 The soil was well packed in the vase and difficult to remove. 50 The fragments are triangular in shape, parts of bigger objects; but it is not clear, because of their size, whether their shape is deliberate or accidental. Analogous rock crystal fragments, although much larger, were found in the Throne Room (Evans 1935, fig. 900), and are seen in the Drauffhtsboard (Evans IQ21, Colour PL V opp. p. 472). 51 The objects were photographed at the University of Crete (Biology Dept.) by Mrs U. Potter-Damioulaki using a Scanning Electron Microscope. The results were studied by R. Scaife (Institute of Archaeology in London); he suggests that they could be the following: foraminifera or an ostracod. I thank both Mrs Potter-Damioulaki and Dr Scaife. 52 Hood 1994, 1 01, fig. 1; Macdonald pers. comm. and 1993, 68. My warm gratitute to Dr Macdonald for allowing me to use this information. 53 Evans (1921, 299) wrote: 'it is clear that this stage of Minoan culture was cut short by a catastrophe'; and on page 300 'we have in fact abundant evidence of a contemporary disaster which befell both the great palatial centres of Minoan Crete at the close of the Second Middle Minoan Period'; also 1928, 287. 54 Evans 1021, 168, fia ii8a.6, 11. 55 Momigliano (1991, 171) cited a necked jar found in a MM Ia deposit in House B, and another from the NW Pit which is of MM IIa-IIIa context. 56 Evans 1902-3, fig. 65s, 66n; in his notes Evans (AE/NB 1903, 3a) drew two of them and wrote next to the bowl with the spout : 'brown glazed slip h. 7 cm.'; and on p. 4 just below the drawing of the second bowl he wrote 'Diam. 21.3 plain clay Another similar diam. 12.2'. 57 Evans IQ02-3, Q^ fis;- 66m, n; 10,21, 168, fia:. ii8a.i6, 18. 58 Momigliano 1991, 169 (after MacGillivray 1986, 143-4: shallow bowl type 1). 59 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 4) drew this lid and wrote next to it: 'Cover q.^ diam. white cross lines on brown slip'. 60 Evans 1902-3, 95, fig. 65m, r.</page><page sequence="30">!4 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS FIG. 3.

There are fragments of two (19, 20). 19 is part of a rim, with red slip, belonging to a small conical-shaped pithos. Its rim recalls MM III and LM pithos profiles, and the red slip is characteristic of MM IIIb/LM Ia pithoi.61 It may thus be intrusive. Fine Ware The majority of these are made of fine buff fabric. Beaked Jugs (FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 7; PLATES 1 0, 2 d). Nine jugs with cut-away spouts have been found (22-31). 62 Most of them are in HM, but 28-29 are in the AM and 22 is in the BM.63 They have a conical or conical-globular body, are coil-made and have paring marks. Their decoration is standard: brown to black bands round the neck and a cross-hatched 'butterfly' motif positioned below the spout,64 recalling again the double axe.65 One more vessel with a cut-away spout (31 FIG. 7; PLATE 3 a), identified and restored by Popham,66 has two arched bands running the height of the whole body, from base to shoulder to base again and no 'butterfly'.67 Jugs are for pouring, whether in every-day use for water or wine, or for libations or drinks in a ritual or festival. The set of nine more or less identical jugs in this deposit must have some special purpose. The 'butterfly'68 motif, with its resemblance to the double axe, again suggests cult or ritual. Evans dated these jugs originally to EM,69 then to MM Ia;7° three more of this class at Knossos come from uncertain contexts.71 Similar jugs (only upper part surviving) come from MM Tylissos.72 Miniature Spouted Jug (FIG. 2; PLATE 3 b). This jug (32) has decoration similar to that of the beaked jugs - a triangular arrangement of small discs below the spout suggesting a pendant. Its small size and good fabric point to contents of some value, such as perfume or a special oil. A similar but larger jug was found at Gournes.73 Evans74 dated it to EM in his original report. 61 My thanks are due to Dr K. Christakis (working on Minoan pithoi) for his help in dating this pithos as well as the others from the CPS. 62 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 2a, 3) drew two of them and wrote: '20 cm. black on buff Another 12.5 cm. black on buff (9 of this class)' and 'Black on buff 17 cm. Marks of cutting out'. Number '9' refers to the number of this type of vase Evans saw, which agrees with what exists today; also Evans 1902-3, 97, figs. 65p, 66b, d, f, g, k; 1921, 166, figs. 117a, b, 118a. 3, 5, 14, 21. 63 These three vases were among the first objects to be taken to England by Evans, permission having been granted by the Cretan State on 31 July 1904 (Document in the Cretan State Archives housed at the Historical Archives of the Cretan Museum at Chania, to be published shortly), following an application by Evans dated 10 July 1904. As it is evident from letters in the Archives of the Philekpaedeutikou Sylogou (HM) Evans had been trying since 1 90 1 to persuade the Cretan authorities to grant him permission to take some objects to England in order to attract more money for his excavations. A law which passed in 1903 was in favour of this scheme and all the excavators of the time (Evans, Halbherr, Hogarth, Boyd) were allowed to take abroad some objects from their excavations. My warm thanks to Mrs Simandiraki (in charge of the Cretan State archives) and Mr Ch. Kritzas (HM director and in charge of the archives of the Philekpaedeutikou Sylogou) for allowing me to study and use for publication material from the archives. 64 Other beaked jugs with cutaway spouts and 'butterfly' motif were found in the Monolithic Pillars room, House A or N of Kouloura II, as suggested by Momigliano (1991, 171). 65 See Nilsson 1950, 213-15.

Four jugs of cylindrical body were recovered (33-36): all roughly made (hand-made, with perhaps only a wheel finishing touch on the rim).75 Their form, with a tiny pinched-out spout, suggests their use for pouring of liquids. Their poor quality may indicate that they were mass-produced, or were not made by professional potters.76 Evans dated them to EM at first, MM Ia later.77 Momigliano78 suggested that (like 1) they find close parallels with specimens found in the tombs at Gournes. Zois dated this material from Gournes to MM Ia,79 but Momigliano compared MM IIa and even MM IIIa pieces at Knossos.80 Miniature Spouted Jar (FIG. 5; PLATE 3 d). The miniature jar (37) is of slightly better quality than the jugs.81 Evans dated it to MM IA,82 Momigliano thought it later.83 Recent excavations by Macdonald84 suggest that miniatures are characteristic of MM IB deposits (as defined by Cadogan et al.)85 at Knossos or even MM IIa, but not earlier than MM IB.86 Cups (FIG. 6; PLATES 4 fl, b). Two probably wheel-made cups (38, 39): one with almost straight sides,87 the other with slightly curved ones.88 A handleless conical cup was also found (40). Cups are suited equally to cult (especially conical cups)89 or domestic use. Evans dated them at first to EM, later to MM Ia.9° Momigliano dated the straight-sided version (38) to Early Kamares, MM IIA.91 The rounded cup (39) she saw as close to MM Ia types,92 though similar cups were still produced in MM IIa. She also assigned the conical cup (40) a MM IIa date,93 with reservations. Both the straight-sided and the rounded cup could be given a MM Ib date, as defined by Cadogan et al^ Footed Goblets (FIG. 5; PLATE 3/). Four were found (41-44). They too may have been mass- produced.95 44 has white and red alternating lines around its body.96 They could have had the same function as the cups. 75 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 4) wrote: 'several miniature pots about 4 cm h. 1 to 4-6 plain clay'; '4-6' refers to the number of the pots Evans saw. When Evans writes on page 5 'Cups are with cut marks not wheel as Early Palace' he probably refers to these vases; also 1902-3, 97, fig. 65 u, w, y; 192 1, 166, fig. n8a.ic{. 76 They could have been made by individuals to be brought to a shrine and used just once, be it to bring something in, or to be used there in the activities. 77 Evans 10,02-3, 07; 1021, 166. 78 Momigliano iqqi, i6q. 79 Zois 1969, 4 , 24. 80 Momigliano 1991, 169. 81 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 3a) drew the pot in profile and from above and wrote: 'burnished buffh. 4-^'. 82 Evans 192 1, fig. n8a.i7. 83 Momigliano 1991, 169, 171. 84 My warm thanks to Drs Momigliano, Wilson and Macdonald for allowing me to use this information.

I02 Three fragments from similar cups in the AM must also come from the deposit (51). The thin walls, fine polychrome decoration and lustre indicate luxury, drinking vessels. Vases in this fabric are among the most characteristic of the Early Kamares phase, MM Ib/IIa. Dated to MM Ia by Evans,103 Momigliano104 (although concerned that they may be intrusive because some of the fragments joined with material from a box labelled as unprovenanced)105 considered the type undoubtedly Early Kamares, MM IIa. Carinated cups occur from MM IB to MM ÜB and are typical of the Old Palace Period,106 but these look more like MM IB cups. Burnished Ware Four-Handled Jars (FIGS. 6, 7; PLATES 1 0, 4 d). One whole specimen (52)107 and two fragments (53, 54) were found.108 They have a tiny collar that could take a lid, to be tied to the smaller pair of handles. The decoration is again cross-hatched 'butterflies'. Evans gave them an EM context at first109 and MM Ia later,110 while Andreou dated them to the Early Kamares phase of MM Ib/IIa,111 and so did Momigliano.112 Lamp (FIG. 6; PLATE 4 e).

One (56) is repaired from many fragments. Another (57) is represented by a body and base segment, and there are parts of at least three lids (58-60). Il8 The shape is cylindrical with three small feet; they carry incised decoration filled with white, contrasting with the dark, burnished surface.119 Evans saw similarities between these and Cycladic specimens.120 Later, he saw them as 'actual imports from the central Aegean'.121 Later still, he recognized that the incised patterns on these pyxides were different from those in the Cyclades, and argued instead that the technique was Neolithic and had survived into MM Ia.122 Platon123 and Andreou124 suggested that the pyxides were simply Neolithic and had been retrieved from the Neolithic portion of the test-pit. MacGillivray, on the other hand, thought that they should be assigned a MM Ia date.125 Samples were submitted for physico-chemical analysis, the results of which point to Central Crete as the area of production.126 Momigliano thought they may have been produced locally,127 but in imitation of Cycladic prototypes. Mantelli pointed out to me that they are unique as they combine several Neolithic features with later ones,128 and that cylindrical pyxides with three small feet are typical of cemetery assemblages of the EC I Grotta-Pelos culture.129 They do recall Cycladic pyxides from Naxos.130 However their surface treatment is basically the same as Cretan Neolithic vases, but their incised decoration is much finer than on the latter. In conclusion, these pyxides are locally made. Although they combine earlier Cycladic and Cretan Neolithic features, they should be seen as contemporary with the other vases of the deposit or slightly earlier: imitation of earlier traditions rather than these vases surviving over hundreds of years. Pyxides, as observed above, are commonly associated with cemeteries and very few have been recovered from residential areas. They most probably contained perishables to accompany the dead. The concentration here of five in a single non-funerary deposit may point to the singular nature ofthat deposit. They may, for example, have been used in a shrine as containers of perfumes or oils. Conclusions on the vases Evans131 at first saw most of the vases from the VRD as typical EM. Only one goblet and a few cups did he place in the first part of the MM period. Later132 he viewed the deposit as 118 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 3a) drew the pyxis and wrote: '4 holes Diam. 18 h. 9.5 3 legs light brown polished slip with incised decoration' and next to the drawing of the whole lid: 'Diam. 15.5 punctuated and incised with white filling'. "9 Similar pyxides have been found at Myrtos (Warren 1972a, 642-3, fig. 84) and Sphoungaras (Hall 1912, 47, fig. 21). They have flanged bases and tripod feet, but not incised decoration. Three incised pyxides from Koumasa are similar (Xanthoudides 1924, pl. xviii.4195, 4196, 5035). Another well known example is from Patema near Palaikastro, (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 5, fig. 2). 120 Evans 1902-3, 97. 121 Evans 1021, 166. 122 Evans 1935, 89-91.

He was therefore the first to pronounce a later date (MM IB)136 for the VRD vases. Andreou went further, suggesting that the VRD is a mixed one containing Neolithic, MM Ia, and MM Ib/IIa (the last being those vases dated as MM Ia by Evans).137 Hood later stated that 'The Vat Room deposit ... is assigned to MM Ib because wheel-made vases occur in it. In fact it is probably MM IIA'.138 Momigliano assigned some vases to MM IIA139 (for which now read MM IB).140 Deposits excavated by Hood and Macdonald141 within the Palace (Magazine A) as well as by Macdonald W of the Palace (w of the South-West House) seem to be the result of a fire in MM IB. The VRD, which bears the same characteristics as these deposits (traces of fire, miniature vases, red-burnished vases, goblets, rounded or straight-sided cups and carinated cups), is probably a result of the same destruction. If so, it occurred in MM IB, the first phase of the Old Palace Period or slightly later. It is unlikely that the vases were moved any distance in or after the destruction. They may be part of the furnishings of this area of the West Wing. It is hard to draw conclusions about the purpose of this group of pottery. Though some shapes occur in multiples or matching sets, they need not imply cult use. After all, domestic cupboards contain more than a cup or a jug. In terms of shapes, all could equally well serve in a house or a shrine. But the 'butterfly-double-axe' motif in their decoration does suggest a religious symbolism. Their apparent deposition in a pit,142 which was subsequently covered with gypsum slabs, may be significant. One could argue that they were given a deliberate burial not because they were rubbish, but because they were honoured objects. Burial of this kind is often associated with the disposal of superfluous goods from shrines.143 Whether or not the burial was also a foundation deposit is uncertain.144 The other finds may help to resolve the question of the use of these goods. CHIPPED STONE The VRD yielded 119 pieces of obsidian: i. a nodule, ii. blades, iii. cores, iv. flakes and v. unworked fragments. 133 Pendlebury 1939, 104. 134 Walberg 1976, 104. 135 Hood 1974, 34. 136 Hood 1978, 132. 137 Andreou 1078, 180 n.6. 138 Hood 1088, 110-11. 139 Momigliano 1991, 160, 172. 140 Cadogan et al. 1993, 21-8. 141 Hood 1974, 34; Macdonald 1990, 84-5; Hood 1994, 101; Macdonald pers. comm. 142 Evans (1921, 165) wrote: 'the deposit itself occurred in a small pit going down about a metre deeper into the Neolithic layer'. 143 On ritual burials of cultic objects in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Near East see Garfinkel 1994, 159-88; also Tell Asmar, in Mesopotamia (Early Dynastic Period), where cult statues were 'either when danger threatened or when the shrine was completely renovated buried together under the floor beside the altar' (Frankfort 1989, 46). In Minoan Crete there have not been any such burials recorded before. The disposal of 'superfluous' objects, or the deliberately burnt remnants of the same, in pits, is a common practice in Cretan churches and monasteries today. The fact that the VRD vases cover a broad period of time may point to their being kept as heirlooms or to the effects of religious conservatism, so obvious too in modern churches. 144 Foundation deposits usually (but not always) involve complete objects. Here there were quite a few fragmentary and incomplete ones.

Scale 2:3.</page><page sequence="41">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS 25 Obsidian Nodule The small nodule is of irregular shape (61) and contains what Evans called 'nests of crystals'.145 These are formed around gas cavities in the block, and present an angular, polygonal appearance: they are white-grey in colour. The colour of the nodule itself is rather shiny, black, but not transparent. Renfrew suggested that it probably came from 'South Anatolia'146 and it may have, since it is shiny like the Anatolian obsidian and unlike the Melian.147 On two sides the cortex remains,148 whilst the two larger surfaces contain the 'nests'. There is no evidence for the removal of blades; some rounded scars recall 'waves of percussion', but this could have resulted from accidental damage. Blades Evans illustrated four blades,149 three of which are identifiable in HM (62.1-2, FIG. 8, and 62*22, FIG. 9) and one in KSM (64.22, FIG. 9). Today there are 79 blades (62-64) in HM and in KSM. Many of them have long, parallel sides, with small bulbs of percussion: both features pointing to removal by pressure-flaking, and probably to Bronze Age rather than Neolithic production.150 Such blades are best suited for lighter tasks (see Crabtree151 and Torrence152) such as the cutting or scraping of relatively soft materials. Two have plunging distal ends153 (FIG. 8) - which suggest a rather unsuccessful attempt at a straight blade. 62.8 has a rounded, rather blunt, distal end and slightly chipped sides; it is uncertain whether this is sufficient evidence to argue for its use as a tool. The rounded and blunt end could perhaps have served to avoid injury to the fingers. There are at least three crested blades (62.14; 64.34, 35} FIGS. 8, 9), which mark the start of the core reduction.154 A few First Series blades (perhaps 62.14, 19), which mark the removal of the external layer of the prepared core, have traces of cortex and of the crested blades. The vast majority of blades are of the Second series, the best kind for use. Most blades are of dark grey (almost black) and matt, often with striations that give a green or a brown tinge; they are not transparent, but opaque and have a 'pearly lustre', all characteristics of Melian obsidian.155 62.1-5 are glass-like, almost transparent, with the matrix shot through with black; and there are very few spherulites irregularly distributed in it: all of which suggest that this obsidian comes either from Giali,156 because of the spherulites, or from south Anatolia (see below). Others (62.20, 24-55 64.1, 5, 23, 29) are of the same type but without the spherulites and more transparent. Since Renfrew stated that 'none of the pieces so far examined from Giali lacks these spherulites'157 we should look for another source, perhaps Antiparos, the obsidian of which, as described by Renfrew,158 is similar to the above blades. 145 Evans 1921, 170, fig. 120, top middle. These 'nests' were most probably formed by gas entrapped in the obsidian during its solidification.

Scale 2:3.</page><page sequence="43">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS 27 Some blades are also transparent, glass-like with dense, parallel, black lines running askew (64.23); these too may have come from Antiparos or another source. 63.3, 7-8, 10, 12; 64.2-4, 6, 20, 34, 36-7 are more transparent and glass-like, shot through with varying shades of grey. Such features are typical of south Anatolian obsidian as described by Renfrew,159 who analysed one blade (which is unknown) from the VRD; he described it as 'transparent and glass-like', falling 'within group 2b, which refutes any suggestion of a Giali origin. The only source for this variety is in south Anatolia'.160 Two such blades (of very light grey colour) were also found in a tomb at Plátanos.101 The presence of obsidian from possibly three or four different sources is important. It shows that the Minoans had access to a wide-spread network of exchange, involving people of at least the southern Mediterranean. The study of further classes of material will extend the nature of these contacts.162 Cores There are 13 cores in HM and KSM (65, 66; FIGS. 10, 11; PLATE 27 a, b). The degree to which they have been reduced varies. Most have one side or surface left unworked. The method of reduction (mainly pressure-flaking)163 tends to lead to a core ellipsoidal-oval to tabular in section. Distal ends may take on a tapered profile, especially if some plunging blades have occurred. No evidence for secondary use has been detected. One (66, FIG. 11) has a peculiar natural deformity: one large and one smaller near-cylindrical hole. They must be a natural phenomenon as they show no signs of working scars and are too irregular inside. The core production is of the kind usual in Crete at this date: flakes are removed (by percussion as well as pressure) to prepare the profile, a crested ridge made; the platform made ready by one major and several minor transverse flakes. The removal of the prismatic blades has left regular enough blade scars, though at times they overlap and merge; a few stepped fractures show where problems in blade removal had not been overcome. Working seems conducted from one end only. Rejuvenation flakes from redesigning the platform are but rarely encountered. Removal of platform overhang is not evident - though this may simply be because the cores were set aside, after their last serviceable blades had been taken off. Flakes Flakes and smaller nodules (FIGS. 10, 11) were also recovered in some numbers, 26 in total (67, 68). Their irregular form and general lack of any clear signs of deliberate working argues that they are by-products of some other process. Core preparation is the obvious one. Where surviving, the size of the bulb and strength of the waves of percussion (ripples) argue for their removal by percussion, or occasionally by the pressure method. Fragments Two irregular fragments (69.8-9) show no signs of use or preparation: the transparency they exhibit as well as the white speckles (densely distributed) are characteristic of Giali obsidian. l64 159 Renfrew 10,6^, 230. 160 Renfrew 1965, Table I no. 135. 161 Xanthoudides 1924, 105; Renfrew 1965, 239. 162 On such contacts see Branigan 1987, 245fr.; and 1989, 65-77; also Wiener 1987, 26 iff.; and Kopeke 1987, 255fr. 163 On the methods of blade production (core preparation and reduction) see Newcomer 1975, 97-8; Torrence 1979, 71-3; Evely 1993, 119-28. 164 Renfrew 1965, 232.</page><page sequence="44">28 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS ■ O 'r O Ar 7 8 10 11 FlG. io.

Scientific analyses of the VRD obsidian are now being carried out by the author. Flint One fragment (69.10) of flint is also catalogued.166 It has a shape roughly recalling that of a single axe-head, and shows traces of weathering at its pointed end, probably the result of use. The flint is similar to that of an Egyptian knife, probably from Knossos.167 Conclusions What may we conclude about the obsidian? Blades were obviously the main end product, as their numbers indicate. Present too are the cores from which they were extracted and some of the discards produced in the shaping and reduction of the same. Does this constitute a working area? Certainly the micro-debitage of such is totally lacking. It is quite normal to find collections of blades, flakes and cores on Neolithic and Bronze Age sites, right down into the LM period;168 they do not all argue for manufacture at the place or time of their final deposition. Like sherds, obsidian travels easily in the soil. But there are other concentrations of obsidian in the West Wing. Rooms 46 a and b, w of the Throne Room, yielded large numbers of blades (though not in situ).169 The cists N of the Temple Repositories contained sizeable blocks of obsidian;170 and the Room of the Great Pithos, S of the same Repositories, had so many blades that Evans suggested it was used as a barber's shop.171 There may be a case to be made, therefore, for the West Wing in the Neopalatial era (MM IIIa-LM Ia) as acting as a store for raw material, and thence the production - somewhere - of blades. Did the same situation apply earlier to the Vat Room? It is doubtful that we can answer this. The VRD obsidian is not enough to be very significant, but the fact that it was deliberately deposited along with the other objects, is. All the evidence from the core types and blades argue for a method of manufacture based on pressure flaking: the normal process in the Bronze Age, though beginning hesitantly in the Late Neolithic. The procedure can be seen better in obsidian from Mallia and the Royal Road at Knossos.172 The block with the 'nest of crystals' may well have been kept as a curiosity,173 since the presence of the 'nests' rendered it useless for blade production. 163 Evely 1993, 134-7, fig- 61. 166 Fiint or chert fragment. 167 Cadogan 1966, 147. 168 Evidence for obsidian knapping has turned up on many sites: amongst the more significant, or published, are the Unexplored Mansion (Evely 1984, 230), Mallia (Seferiades 1975, 24, 109, pls. vi-vii, and Van Effenterre 1969, 17 ff., pls. xxv. 3 and 4, xxvii.3 and xxix), Royal Road, Knossos (Torrence 1979, 75, 77-9), and Phylakopi (Bosanquet 1904, 232). Working areas at the last three have been identified, but only Phylakopi has produced a large amount of debitage and is therefore considered by Torrence (1979, 77) to be a working area or a dump. The Royal Road South workshop produced 540 grs. of waste (Warren 1972a, 393), and Torrence (1979, 77) suggests that a degree of clearing had already taken place. 169 Evelv pers. comm. 170 These blocks of obsidian are now in KSM: the legends on their boxes refer to the 'Cists North of the Temple Repositories' as the spot of their discovery. 171 Evans icm, 635 n.2. 172 Seferiades 1975, 24, 109; van Effenterre 1969, ¡7ff. for Mallia; Torrence 1070, 76 for Knossos. 173 On 'rarities' see Rouse 1902, 318-21.</page><page sequence="47">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS 3! STONE FRAGMENTS (Vases and other pieces) Fragments of more than the four stone vases published by Evans are involved (70-78). I74 Another (77) described by Evans as 'part of thin ostrich shell-like vase of marble (whitish) V75 is indeed ostrich shell (see below). 70 (FIG. 12; PLATE 5 a) is probably what Evans recorded as 'amongst stone vessels were remains of a cup and a "bridge-spouted" bowl of coarse alabaster'.176 As a matter of fact there are three fragments (70A, B, C) of exactly the same stone, banded tufa,177 recorded under the same HM number. One (70A) has had its spout, which is set very close to the body, altered. Whether this was done in the course of manufacture178 or later to counter a natural breakage is unclear. Another (70B) has a raised zone (slightly visible on either side of the spout in the previous piece too) that effectively defines the rim area and it also has a lug-handle.179 The third fragment (70C) comes from the body of a vase and has no distinctive characteristics. All three have the honey-brown bands naturally present in the tufa. At first impression, they all seem fragments of the same vessel; but some uncertainty remains as it is not usual for tea-pots to have lug handles (at least on the evidence of their clay counterparts).180 Furthermore, only a vague hint of the raised zone (as slight incisions at the appropriate position, but creating a broader zone) exists on the piece with the spout. If more than one vase is involved, it would still appear that they made a set. The spouted fragment belongs to a Type D teapot, on Warren's system of division, and was datedtoEMIII-MMI.181 71 is a marble bowl fragment (PLATE 5 é), with flat base off-set, and a slightly inverted rim.182 The stone has pairs of dark grey horizontal bands on a whitish-grey ground. The type (plain bowl with moulded base) was dated by Warren to MM IA.183 A fragment (72) of body and rim in the AM probably belongs to this bowl. Finally, Evans published a lid (73; FIG. 12; PLATE 5 c), sketching it in his diary and recording 'another smaller with a handle' (74; FIG. 12; PLATE 5 c).1^ Warren, who published both lids, dated them to MM I.185 He pointed out, however, that they are the sole specimens of their type earlier than LM II-IIIai. He felt that they are later than the rest of the VRD objects and thus intrusive.186 Lids similar in shape but of serpentine were found in Quartier Mu (MM IIb) at Mallia.187 174 Evans 1902-3, 95; 1921, 169, fig. 120, right-hand corner and below. 175 Evans 1921, 169, fig. 120, bottom right. In his notes (AE/NB 1903, 5) he wrote: 'and part of thin Ostrich shell like vase of marble (whitish)'. 176 Evans 1921, 170, fig. 120, right-hand side, just below marble bowl. In his notebook (AE/NB 1903, 5) he drew the fragment with the spout and wrote: 'Coarse Alabaster' and 'Marble Limes' crossed out, and 'remains of cup similar material'. 177 On banded tufa see Warren infio.

This may be the cup fragment that Evans referred to, although it could equally be part of the teapot itself. 180 Although a teapot from Mochlos carries three lugs on its body (Seager 1912, fig. 18.VI, pl. 4). 181 Warren (1969, 99) assigns the teapot to his Type D, and presents parallels from Mochlos (see above) and Mallia (Chapouthier and Joly 1936, 39, pls. xxd, xxivc). 182 Evans 1921, 170, fig. 120, top right. In his notes (AE/NB 1903, 5) Evans wrote: 'Part of cup of banded whitish and dark grey limestone or rough alabaster'. 183 Warren (1969, 79) assigns it to Group A in his 'plain bowls with moulded base' section. Similar examples were found in the Mesara tombs (dated to EM III-MM I) and Quartier Mu (dated to MM II by Detournay 1980, 231-4). 184 Evans (AE/NB 1903, 6) wrote: 'Gypsum or rough alabaster 10 cm. diam.'; see also 1902-3, 95; one lid appears in Evans 1921, fig. 120, top left. l85 Warren 1969, 68. 186 Warren 1967, 200 n.35 and n.50.

It is a tiny lid of chlorite, from a miniature vase.188 Two other fragments of serpentine or steatite vases were found stored with the other objects: one (76; FIG. 12; PLATE 5 d) is a rim piece with a crisp, V-shaped incision; the other (78) is also a rim and body piece. Both fragments may have come from small vases, to judge from their thin walls. One 'Neolithic axe-head' (79) is known,189 fragmentary and with the working edge and part of body surviving: it carries the slight scratching from being worked to shape with an abrasive. Other tools in the group are a whetstone (80; FIG. 13; PLATE 5 g) of slate/phyllite, and a faceted tool (81; FIG. 13; PLATE 5 e) probably of heated steatite.190 Finally two very small steatite fragments (82) are stored with the obsidian. They exhibit no traces of working. One may argue that similar stone vase fragments are quite common on many sites of different character (e.g. Unexplored Mansion, partly domestic, partly industrial; South House)191 and that therefore the VRD examples are of no particular significance. However, we should consider the possibility that these objects were in some way connected with the workings of a shrine, and thus came to be deliberately buried alongside more valuable objects. ROCK CRYSTAL AND OTHER TRANSLUCENT MATERIALS Four broken pieces of crystalline mineral and a spherical bead come from the Deposit.192 They are of two different degrees of translucency and colouring, and thus materials. A cylinder-like object (83; FIG. 13) of rock crystal was published by Evans,193 who said that it 'was apparently a core produced by boring, and as in similar cases broken off by the lapidary in the process of hollowing out a vessel of that material'. Evans was right since the cylinder exhibits the typical slight taper of such pieces and the tiny abrasion scratches and pitting (like 'frosted glass') all over its surface. The top is scratched also. The lower end displays the typical fracturing scars of the material. There is also one piece broken off a natural rock crystal (84; FIG. 13), as is shown by the angle of the planes and its physical appearance. Two square plaques (86; FIG. 13; PLATE 5/) are cloudy and softer. They are unworked natural crystals and would seem to be of calcite.194 The rock crystal spherical bead (85; FIG. 13) was found among the frit and faience beads (120). It is slightly battered, from the roughing out, and still shows traces of the chipping to make its basic shape (before the final polishing).195 The biconical string-hole is drilled from both sides. The worked crystal pieces show chipping and scratching from rubbing with some abrasive, which would have to be emery196 to be effective on such a hard substance. Plain though they are, these items are of value, since they extend the short list of objects of such material from 188 Similar lids were found at Tylissos, see Hatzidakis 191 2 and 1 92 1, fig. 24. 189 On Neolithic axe-heads see Evely 1984, 237. 190 A similar whetstone was found in the Unexplored Mansion (Evely 1984, 226-7, pl. 208.9).

These pieces in the VRD are interesting for their early date and as indications of the kind of objects being produced. Whether the material comes from Egypt or from a local source cannot be known. Like the obsidian, they are incomplete or wasters from craft activity but they do not present a strong argument for manufacture in this area of the palace because they are so few.1" IVORY, SHELL AND RELATED SUBSTANCES Ivory Evans did not mention any items of ivory200 in his publication. Five plaques, however, (FIG. 14; PLATE 37 a- c) were found in the box with the frit and faience beads (120).201 For that reason they are included here (87-92). They survive in a rather fragmentary condition. In comparison with the TR examples, they are extremely thin, brittle and fine: it is hard to see them as free standing. They are more likely inlays, even though well polished on both main surfaces. Two of the thinnest (90-92; FIG. 14; PLATE 6 d-e) have three fine parallel decorative incisions at one end, and a dowel hole that goes right through the plaque. The fact that they are finely polished on their lower surface as well, may suggest that the craftsman tried to have a perfect fit with another flat and well polished plaque of material less costly than the ivory such as wood or bone. Nails in the dowel holes may have secured the pieces. Perhaps they decorated a pyxis202 or a stave.203 Another fragment is a strip (87; PLATE 6 a) with one end broken away diagonally. It exhibits darker, elongated veins or lamellae.204 Fragment 88 (FIG. 14; PLATE 6 ¿), of angled profile (Ponce a hexagon), has on the upper surface a row of round depressions drilled in an irregular pattern to varying depths (about half the thickness of the piece). It is likely that these were sockets for an ornamental device or inlay. The lower side shows a pattern of random scratches, and two mortises, known already at Knossos and Mycenae205 for fixing the inlay to its backing. The fifth piece (89; PLATE 6 c) has few signs of working. It is probably from a curved object but its poor preservation does not permit a guess as to what that was. One surface is heavily weathered, the other curves slightly; a brown substance, probably spilt glue, is seen partly covering both surfaces. 197 Examples of rock crystal objects of First Palace date: beads from the tholoi of Porti and Plátanos, see Xanthoudides 1924, 69, 124; a sealstone, see Evans 1921, 274-5, fig- 2O4.a,b,c; and a seal workshop, including some pieces, at Mallia Quartier Mu, see Poursat, 1981, 11 iff.; also Evely 1984, 224 n.116. 198 As found at Knossos in the Temple Repositories (Chapter 3), the Throne Room (Evans 1935, fig. 900), the Draughtsboard (Evans 1921, Colour.

Evans wrote, 'most of the plaques . . . were of white shell'209 and in a later publication he suggested that they might be of tridachna.210 Eleven pieces are triangular (e.g. 93. ai; FIG. 14) and five crescent shaped (eg. 93. a2; FIG. 14), one of the former seems incompletely worked, others are rough even on the upper surface, probably the result of weathering. The upper surface is recognizable only by its high polish, while the sides and underneath have signs usually of slight scratching from the abrasives used to work them. Often the piece curves slightly, which is partly a result of the method of working, and partly reflects the material's natural form. Evans arranged211 these pieces to form medallions, suggesting that they might be part of a draughtsboard (93; FIG. 14; PLATE 6/).212 His design is plausible. They could, equally, have decorated the lid of a box, recalling the one from Tylissos,213 or a piece of furniture.214 They could have been combined with similar pieces of faience (one found in the same deposit), and ostrich egg, also found in the VRD. Ostrich Egg Shell In PM I, fig. 120, next to the shells on the right are two tear-drop shaped objects (96.a, b; FIG. 14; PLATE 7 Ô).215 Two such are in HM today, and one more is in the AM216 (97; PLATE 7 d top). They are skilfully cut from ostrich egg shell, and have edges and upper surfaces finely polished. The matt underside is concave. They are likely to be inlays. There was also a triangular piece217 (98; PLATE 7 a top) in the box with the frit and faience beads (120). Its edges are rather rough and unpolished; its upper surface is slightly polished but has retained the brown spots, which are typical of a kind of ostrich egg.218 Twenty-four more pieces were found recently in HM (PLATE 7 a, c). Although they had been catalogued together with other objects 206 Identified by Dr F. Poplin to whom I am indebted. He thinks that 89 could be weathered elephant tusk. The presence of almost exclusively hippopotamus ivory at this period agrees with what we know already: Evely 1993, 248-9. 207 On the sources of ivory in the Aegean see Karali- YannacoDoulos 1002, ^7-60. 208 Mallia provides many examples of general and specific parallels, see Demargne 1945, 57, pl. 68.1; 1953, 18, pl. 46; Treuil 1975, 132, pl. 40; Detournay 1980, 143fr.; Poursat 1992, 3-5. 209 Evans 1921, 170, fig. 120, centre.

The darker crescentic piece in the upper circle is of faience. Only nine triangular pieces (eleven exist now) have been arranged by Evans with six crescentic, five of which exist now. 212 Evans 1921, 170. No pegging holes or mortises exist on the shell pieces; they would, thus, have to be embedded into wood or a paste, and perhaps further supported by silver or gold foil. Objects of similar shape were found at Pylos (Tomb E.6: LH IIIa-B, see Biegen 1973, fig. 242) but they are of ivory. Biegen (1973, 185, 188) believed that they were 'probably inlaid in wood'; Similar pieces are used on their own or combined with stone and set in blue paste, bitumen or wood in the standard from Ur or in the harp and goat offering stand also from Ur (for illustrations see Strommenger 1964, pls.

Many have been joined to produce part of an egg (PLATE 7 c). I identified among the joined pieces (99.a) the three originally connected and published by Evans as 'Egg-shell fragmt from marble vase'.219 The small triangular piece (98) does not join the other fragments and, as it has brown spots (which the others do not) it may have come from a different egg or have not been polished to the same degree. Several of the triangular fragments do not have polished edges like the tear-drop pieces. If the triangular shape is not accidental, the pieces could have been inlays. If so, we see another instance of unfinished objects being deposited in the group. Some of the fragments have a circular form at the edge (not polished), reminiscent of the round mouth of the ostrich egg rhyta from Thera220 and Mycenae.221 Sakellarakis rightly associated the ostrich egg rhyta with cult; they were, as he said, fashioned into precious cult vessels in Crete, whence they spread to Thera and Mycenae.222 This association of ostrich eggs and cult is further supported by the existence of ostrich egg fragments in the Shrine treasury at Zakro.223 Reese has shown that ostrich eggs were connected with shrines and burials from Neolithic to modern times in Greece, Cyprus, the Near East and some West Mediterranean countries. As he said, ostrich eggs 'are thought to be symbols of resurrection into the life of the underworld, symbols of eternal life and a nourishment for the deceased'.224 In sanctuaries they were simply exotic gifts to the deities, perhaps by people who had travelled to countries where ostriches lived.225 Their meaning in modern Orthodox churches is not fully understood; if they carry on from earlier traditions they certainly show religious conservatism. At Panagia on Tinos226 ostrich eggs are hung from bronze or silver chains together with oil lamps; also in Christ's burial place in Jerusalem, and in St Catherine's Church in Sinai.227 METALS Gold Evans recorded 'pieces of gold plating, thicker than the mere foil found with later remains, and of copper (much oxidized) on which the gold had probably, in part at least, been overlaid'.228 These pieces of gold (100) have not been found and in PM I, fig. 120 only one piece is shown. Two additional tiny scraps of leaf (101-102) were found recently: the first in the soil contained in vase 6, and the other among the frit and faience beads (120; see above). They are so fragmentary and creased that nothing can be said about them. However their presence is another pointer to overseas contacts, probably with Egypt or the Near East,229 and hints at the original richness of the objects. 219 Evans 1921, 169-70; in his notebook (AE/NB 1903, 5) he wrote: 'part of thin ostrich shell-like vase of marble - (whitish)', but he has not drawn it. It seems possible to suggest that Evans saw the fragments when they were already joined by his conservators and as the joints are covered with a thick layer of glue, Evans failed to recognize that it was ostrich esrg fragments and not marble. 220 Marinatos 1971, 197, figs. 296-9; 1972, 22, 35-6, fig. 36b, 81-4; Renfrew 1985, 324; Sakellarakis 1990, 286-9, figs. 1-19. 221 Karo 1930-3, 114, 116, 146, 239, 319, figs.

They are stored together with whole ostrich eggs, still retaining the yolk. They are associated with whole elephant tusks and other treasures. 227 In St Catherine's church in Sinai (Manafis 1990, figs 22, 24), where some are decorated with metal bands recalling the Dendra vase (Persson 1931, 37; Sakellarakis 1990, figs 45-53)- 228 Evans 1902-3, 98; 1921, 170. In his notes (AE/NB 1903, 6) Evans recorded: 'Small piece of gold plate thicker than foil of later inlays'. On the copper he wrote on p. 5: 'Fragments of bronze - (copper ?)'. 229 On the sources of gold in the Aegean see Muhly 1983, 1-14.</page><page sequence="55">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS gg Copper and Bronze Evans's idea of gold foil or leaf plating cannot be correct, if the copper or bronze (103-105) fragments he found have been correctly identified with a series of corroded pieces in KSM, in HM (PLATE 8 h) and the AM (PLATE 8 g). The largest piece from the AM has been analysed:230 it is arsenical copper,231 and perhaps waste from an industrial process such as melting in a crucible (see APPENDIX I).232 These metal pieces suggest again the possibility of an associated workshop area, like those at Mallia,233 and in a later shrine at Kition.234 Provenance analyses of the copper fragments are now in progress using Lead Isotope Analysis.235 It would be interesting to know whether it came from a local Cretan source, from the Cyclades, Lavrion or Cyprus.236 SEAL IMPRESSIONS Evans published two sealings (106, 108). 237 One (108) of them shows an arrow: Evans took it to be a 'Hieroglyphic A sign.238 Two fragments were found in the box with the frit and faience beads (120). One (106) has marks of the string, probably the object onto which it was pressed and has traces of a cable-like design on its upper surface.239 The other (107) also carries marks of the object sealed - a smooth surface, and the impression of two strings240 and what looks like part of a rosette motif above.241 The first is argued to be the sealing Evans published.242 These sealings were used for securing something, probably by tying it up. Not much can be said about the seal shape or designs, because of the fragmentary nature of the evidence. However, both seals were pressed lightly and they seem to have been round. The presence of sealings in the deposit is important because it extends the list of sealings from the Old Palace period and illustrates the palace's or the shrine's bureaucracy. Their light baking points rather to an accidental fire, the same that is witnessed on some of the vases. FAIENCE AND FRIT Faience Evans reported finding 'inlays of . . . faience and of very fine texture' as well as 'a great variety of beads in the native faience, some very minute, some bugles, and others globular with a large perforation'.243 He did not list them. Only a single inlay of half-crescent shape (109; FIG. 14; PLATE 7 ¿/right) is recognizable from Evans's illustration, and is now in the AM.244 One more (109A) together with four other inlays 230 Mr K. Zervantonakis studied the fragments optically and believed they were copper slag. Analysis of a piece from the Ashmolean Museum by Dr. P Northover has essentially confirmed this. Thanks are due to the authorities of the Ashmolean Museum (Ann Brown) for permission to carry out this work. 231 Arsenical copper vases were found in Quartier Mu, see Detournay 1980, 233; on copper trade see Stos-Gale et al. 1984, 59-63- 232 On melting and smelting techniques see Branisran 1074, 68-71. 233 Pelon 1987, 269-71; Poursat 1987, 75-6; 1992, 14-17. 234 Karageorghis 1985, 74. 235 1 thank Drs Stos-Gale and Gale for this analysis. 236 On the sources of copper see Stos-Gale et al. 1990, 72-89; and on the sources of metals and trade see Stos-Gale et al. 1991, 249-88. 237 Evans 1921, 168, fig. ii9c,d. 238 Evans 1921, 171; in his notes Evans (AE/NB 1903, 5) has written: 'Seal impression broken ? arrow Pictoeraph'. 239 Evans made a drawing of this sealing in his notes (AE/NB 1903, 5) and wrote: Another part of circular ribbed border'. 240 The strings were made from leather, parchment or intestine; I thank Professors I. Pini and W. Müller for this information. 241 Evans made a drawing of this sealing with the legend 'another' and a question mark next to it (AE/NB 1903, 5). 242 Evans 1902-3, 94; 1921, fig. 119c; and Gill 1965, 74. 243 Evans 1902-3, 95, 98; 192 1, 170.

Greenish surface'</page><page sequence="56">40 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS (110-113; FIG. 14; PLATE 8 d) are in the box with the frit beads (120; see below), as well as a segmented rod (114; PLATE 8 b): seven in all. There are simple triangles (no, 112, 113); no rather larger, with bevelled edges; the half-crescents (109, 109A) have two concave edges, also bevelled; another (in), more irregular, is hard to determine in respect of form: one side is arched, the whole slightly concave in profile. It has an incised exaggerated Z on the reverse, perhaps to guide it to the exact spot where it should be set.245 The segmented rod (114) is divided on top into eleven more or less equal sections. Parallels are known in the Temple Repositories.246 All these faience pieces could have been used as inlays, probably in combination with the shell inlays, and set in wood. The concave and arched pieces would make sense if attached to the Ostrich egg(s) for decorative purposes as on the examples from Mycenae.247 Two different types of bead were found.248 There are two complete big, ring-like or annular specimens (115-116; FIG. 14; PLATE 8 a, e), as well as seven fragments (117, n8.a-f; PLATE 8 a) of the same type but smaller. One of the complete beads and a fragment are identified in the AM (116, 117; PLATE 8 ¿).249 The whole beads have a perforation of considerable size, which preserves slight V-shaped and longitudinal incisions suggesting that the bead was probably formed around a wooden rod. Their core is of fine white material - 'Type 1' in Foster (see Chapter 3).250 The glaze (of matt green) does not coat the inside of the hole, which suggests that it was applied as a slurry onto the surface of the bead, a method used in Middle and New Kingdom Egypt.251 The same is true of the smaller versions. Evans252 referred to these beads as having 'a pale bluish or greenish hue resembling the Egyptian faience of ... the Sixth Dynasty'. They may, however, be of local manufacture.253 The second type is a cylindrical bead (119; FIG. 14; PLATE 8 a), similar to one found in the TR.254 It has a small, smooth perforation, slightly enlarged at one end. It was probably formed, by coating a plant stem in the faience mixture, as Foster255 has explained. Frit There exist 1639 spherical beads (120; PLATE 8 c) in the box labelled '(ppéocp Stone Wats Room.' Two were stuck to a fragment of copper from the same deposit. A further 82 (121) are now identified in the AM.256 They are tiny and of a 'deep cobalt blue'.257 These beads are of 245 Such marks are common on ivory and bone inlays (see Evans 1930, 405-7; and Sakellarakis 1979, 62fr. , fig. 87). The Throne Room pieces (Evans 1935, 941, fig. 912a) have marks of a different kind on their undersides: dashes and dots. 246 Segmented plaques were found in the Temple Repositories (207-209) and as part of the Draughtsboard (Evans 1921, Colour PL V opp. p. 472). Similar objects, in ivory, are used as a frame at the Artemision, in Delos (Poursat 1977b, pl. xiii.1-4). 247 Sakellarakis 1990, figs. 31-9. 248 On the types of beads see Beck 1928, 1-7; also Hughes- Brock 1995, 1 13-14. 249 Evans 1921, 170. A whole bead and part of another were identified in the AM by the present author. The Ashmolean beads have been analysed by Foster and Kaczmarczyk (1982, 157) and were found to consist of (by %): Si 88.5, Ca 1.63, Fe 0.51, Cu 2.63 - quite rich in calcium and copper; Si 89.6, Ca 2.20, Fe 0.31, Cu 2.28 - ditto. In his notes (AE/NB 1903, 4a) Evans drew a whole bead of this type in profile and from above and wrote: 'pale blue porcelain beads'. 250 Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 145. 251 This observation ought to imply that neither efflorescence nor cementation was the method used, as both provide an overall glaze (unless perhaps the hole was blocked?); see Vandiver 1989, 169. A possible method is the application of a thick slurry (fritted glaze material in ground condition in a water vehicle) to the exterior; this method does not appear in Egypt until the Middle Kingdom. 252 Evans 1903, 98; 1921, 170. According to Dr C. Andrews thev do not look Eeryptian (pers. comm.). 253 Analyses now in progress may give some evidence on their provenance. 254 See Chapter 3 (203). Evans drew this bead and wrote: 'pale greenish' (AE/NB 1903, 5a). 255 Lucas and Harris 1962, 44-6; also Foster 1979, 2. 256 Foster and Kaczmarczyk (1982, 147, 157) provide further analyses (by %): Si 70.2, Ca 7.59, Fe 0.56, Cu 5.90; and Si 70.7, Ca 8.25, Fe 0.68, Cu 6.45. 257 Evans 1902-3, 98; 1921, 170; in his notes (AE/NB 1903, 6) Evans wrote: ' "kyanos", abundant'.</page><page sequence="57">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS ^ various dimensions, probably formed around a plant stem and then cut off individually from the resulting cylinder before firing, as described by Lucas and Harris.258 The material is not glazed faience but the porous substance known as frit, a mixture of calcium-copper tetrasilicate crystals and quartz cemented together with glass.259 Most are of the blue colour described by Evans,260 but there are also three white beads and one green. The white and green beads are extremely fragile, while the blue ones are harder. Does this mean that the white and green beads contained 'insufficient copper or calcium to produce the calcium-copper tetrasilicate crystals'261 or is it the result of a difference in the circumstances of their preservation? These frit beads are unique in the palace of Knossos at this early period, both because of their material and colour and because of their small size. The fact that so many were retrieved at the time of excavation is surprising, considering their smallness. Perhaps they were stored in one of the pyxides? Their origin is a puzzle: were they produced in Crete or did they come from the Near East or Egypt?202 The number of the beads is enough to make a complete necklace - perhaps an offering to the faience figurine in the same deposit. Beads of various materials are common in tombs and sanctuaries in Crete and on the Mainland. The earliest faience beads in Crete are those from Mochlos and the Mesara tholos tombs, where they were probably part of the personal possessions of the dead. In shrines they would have been the deity's possessions (see Chapter 3). Two bead-like objects (123.a, b; PLATE 8/) were among the beads. They lack the central perforation and are of a spherical, slightly depressed shape. One (123.a) is pure white, the other (i23.b) greyish; both are disintegrating to a powder. The material is homogeneous and finer in texture than faience and more glassy; they are bryozoans.263 Finally, Evans recorded the existence of 'the fore arm of a small figurine' (122; PLATE 6).264 He said that it was of 'moulded material which seems to have been some kind of vitreous paste with a pale surface'. In his diary, however, he called it 'arm-like fossil-ivory'.265 It had been examined by Dr O. Krzyszkowska and Prof. K.D.S. Lapatin in 1995. On the basis of Evans's notes (Panagiotaki 1998a) Dr Krzyszkowska identified the arm as the VR arm and its material as ivory (type undetermined). It will be published in Prof. Lapatin's forthcoming study on chryselephantine figures. The arm may have been part of a cult figurine, perhaps a protectress of the shrine, and the predecessor of the faience figurines from the Temple Repositories.266 Overall Conclusions on Vat Room Deposit Two themes are worthy of discussion here: cult and craft working. The existence of a shrine267 is argued on the grounds of: the arm of a faience statuette, the 258 Lucas and Harris 1062, 44-6; Foster 1070, 2. 259 Tite (1986, 39) writes: 'Frit is distinguished from faience in being coloured throughout and having no glaze layer. The most common blue frit, which is referred to as Egyptian Blue, consists of an intimate mixture of calcium-copper tetrasilicate crystals (CaCuSi+O,.,) which produce the blue colour, and unreacted quartz (FIG. 1 1), the two phases being typically cemented together with a thin layer of glass'. The identification of frit was here done using a low powered (x 10) magnifying glass. Further investigation has been scheduled using a SEM. It is significant that frit was used as early as this. On frit objects from Minoan Crete see Cadoeran 1076, 18; and Panagiotaki iqqcsa, 146. 260 Evans 1902-3, q8; 1Q21, 170. 261 Tite 1986, 39. 262 A drawing from the tomb of Menkheperresenb (c. 1450 B.C.) depicts Aegeans carrying strings of beads as gifts. Was the traffic the other way about a few centuries before? Vitreous materials 'were produced in the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean from about the fourth millennium BC onwards' as Tite (1986, 39) has pointed out. 263 Dr M. Durkin thinks they are bryozoans, which are fossils of a primitive reef-building mollusc (usually marine; their skeletons resemble those of small colonial coralsi. 264 Evans 1021, 170. 265 Evans AE/NB 1903, 6. 266 See Chapter 3. 267 On town shrines (domestic and palace) see Hood 1977, 158fr; Gesell 1983; Panagiotaki 1985.</page><page sequence="58">42 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS vases, some in sets (with arguably religious motifs on them connected with the double-axe), and the ostrich egg fragments. Figurines of faience or ivory tend to have religious connections, if not actually representing priest-figures or deities.268 Apart from the ivory figurine, what is important and points to cult is the combination of luxury objects269 and the manner of their deposition, which shows that they were honoured. The evidence for manufacturing is: obsidian cores, flakes and blades; rock crystal and other minerals partly worked; partly worked ostrich egg; and copper fragments from some industrial process. Clearly there is not enough to represent more than a fraction of what a working area would be expected to contain; nor does it have to mean that any work in these crafts was carried out at the shrine. Indeed, their status as materials being still worked, as opposed to general rubbish, is in several cases open to question. However, evidently one is dealing not with the actual working area, but with a selection of items from it, deposited in a pit together with a faience figure. Why should they be deposited in this manner if they were not connected with the shrine? The combination of shrine and craft need cause no surprise. Various examples are known from Quartier Mu, at Mallia (MM IIb);2?0 the West Wing at Zakro (LM Ib);2?1 the Unexplored Mansion (LM II);2?2 from the Mainland, the Citadel House at Mycenae (LH IIIb).273 Mesopotamia274 provides Early Bronze Age examples. It would be satisfying to be able here to point to another early example from within a palace. However, caution is needed. The evidence is slender; even if what was recovered is only a small part of what was once there. And the case rests on the considerable assumption that the Vat Room Deposit is a coherent group in a pit dug down into Neolithic strata. Even allowing for the introduction of some pieces as rubbish included with the soil of the fill - one must assume that it was a deliberate decision to open the pit (and perhaps give it a plaster lining)275 and to put into it the finds we know. The disposal of unwanted but still 'active' religious items, or the creation of a foundation deposit, are the two likely possibilities. The inclusion of broken objects seems a little odd for the latter suggestion, but suitable enough for the former. Thus, as to the question of the degree and nature of the interaction of shrine with some craft activities, it is all best left as shadowy possibilities than as proven fact. Nonetheless, the material is of great value in showing that even in the Old Palaces the artisans had reached considerable levels of skill, as exemplified in the faience, frit and ivory and shell working. But also because they show that different crafts276 such as obsidian cutting, copper (s)melting, faience making, and carving were all practised. Trade277 connections, or at least contact,278 are also witnessed: with Egypt, probably Cyprus, North Africa and the Near East. The ivory and gold, the ostrich egg, Anatolian obsidian, the copper fragments, the faience craft and possibly the rock crystal, all owe their presence in Crete to such sources. 268 On Minoan goddesses see Nilsson 1950, 389-425; Willetts 1962, 148-98; Gesell 1983, 93-9; Marinatos et al. 1983, 185-201. 269 An analogy is provided by the Pyrgos shrine, see Cadogan 1981, 169-71. 270 Poursat 1981, 159-65; 1983, 277-81; 1985, 297-300; 1987, 75-6; 1990, 125; 1992, 32-3; 1996. 271 Platon 1971, 86ff.; and Platon 1993, 1 12-13, fig. 4. 272 Popham 1984, 7ff. 273 Taylour 1969, 93-4; 1970, 270-9. 27* Foster 1987, 15. 275 Evans (1921, 236) speaks of a 'plaster lining'. 276 Cadogan 1987, 71-4; and Hood 1978. 277 On trade in the Old Palace period see Branigan 1987, 245-9; and Wiener 1987, 261-7; and 1991, 325-50; on trade in the Bronze Age generally, see Catling 1991, 1-13; and Bass 1991, 69-82; see also Cline 1994 and Warren 1995, 1-18. 278 On contact and exchange between royal courts see Alexiou 1987, 251-3; also Kopeke 1987, 255-9; and Foster 1987, 14.</page><page sequence="59">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS 43 Social implications are a difficult topic to tackle. But, if the locally made material were offered by different worshippers, then the existence is implied of mechanisms through which the objects were acquired; this presupposes some form of trade. The 'imported' material is more likely to have been brought to the shrine by palace officials, responsible for overseas connections. Analogies exist in Egypt279 and the Near East.280 But nothing excludes the possibility that the shrine itself had contacts with overseas. Given that the evidence is so slight, it is quite inappropriate to ask whether the shrine controlled the craftsmen who produced the objects.281 The date of the VRD should, I think, remain open, although the balance of evidence would suggest that it lies within the Old Palace Period. Many of the vases may belong to MM IB, but at the same time there are two marble lids, the sole specimens of their type earlier than LM II- IIIai and a MM IIIb/LM Ia pithos fragment. If indeed of this late date, they would be intrusive. Time may show whether the VRD was an Old Palace shrine, as indicated by the luxury goods in it (ivory, shell, gold and faience) destroyed in the first phase of the Old Palace Period (MM Ib) as originally suggested by Hood282 or slightly later. As Evans pointed out it may not be a coincidence that this deposit is only two metres or so away from the later Temple Repositories.283 It seems likely that some continuity of function in the area could be proposed from the Old Palace period into the New Palace period, although the concrete evidence which might bridge the chronological gap between the Vat Room Deposit and the Temple Repositories is lacking. The strength of tradition should not be underestimated. The Other Deposits VAT ROOM DEPOSITS (Tests made by the author in 1995). Centre of the Room The test was made at the centre of the Vat Room where there was modern concrete. The dimensions of the trench were: N-S 0.90 m X E-w 0.72 m. Its depth was about 0.40m. Neolithic layers lay under the modern concrete, and a number of small sherds were collected. However, the Minoans had cut the Neolithic layers from N to S along the E side of the trench, so creating an incline (c. 0.20 m wide) which runs under the vats. It is clear that the cutting was made for inserting the vats. A few small sherds were collected together with red faced plaster fragments. The sherds include a body sherd from an in-and-out bowl (124, PLATE 15 ¿), which could belong to the transitional MM IIIb/LM Ia period.284 To the same date belongs a rim and body fragment from a conical cup with a ledged rim (125).285 On the present evidence this is the date when the vats (or at least the two southern ones) were installed. It should be remembered that according to Hood this date is what Evans called MM IIIb.286 279 Helck 1987, 17-19. 280 Foster 1987, 15; see also Sherratt 1991, 351-86. 281 On craft and craftsmen see Branigan 1983, 23-32; and Poursat 10,8^, 20.7-300. 282 Hood 1974, 34; 1978, 132; see also MacGillivray 1994, 47-8. 283 Evans 1921, 171. 284 See a similar one in Warren 1991, 332, fig. 7h; and Popham 1984, fier. 145.4. 285 For similar ones see Popham 1084., dI. 14.4.. 14.. 286 Hood 1996, 10; and Macdonald 1996, 17.</page><page sequence="60">44 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS South side of the threshold This was a small test (0.68 X 0.42 m) at the S side of the gypsum threshold.287 The upper level contained a few Minoan sherds (undiagnostic), tiny obsidian fragments and some painted wall plaster. Immediately below were Neolithic layers with the remains of an E-W Neolithic wall. The stratigraphy of this trench is like Evans's tests viii and ix only a metre or so away to the SW, in the EPC. TEST PIT SOUTH OF CENTRAL STAIRS. 0-. 60 (boulders). 1 box '04'. Box 748. The location of this test is not certain. Pendlebury288 placed it at the NE corner of the LSS, but the excavators had placed deposit ix at that spot.289 The label inside the box containing the material from this test does not help much: 'TE S. of Stair Up W. in Central Court. Goes down .60 to boulders'. Because of the uncertainty of its find spot the deposit will be discussed here but the objects will not be included in the Catalogue. The objects are: the upper part (mouth, handles and shoulders) of an oval-mouthed amphora, recalling the TR amphorae; a horizontal handle and part of the body of a closed vase and part of the base and lower body of a large cooking pot; about 15 more small Minoan sherds and 35 Neolithic. Pendlebury saw the deposit as EM and MM II;290 the oval-mouthed amphora, however, may be MM III. If the deposit comes from the NE corner of the LSS after its extension east, it may date to when the extension was made (see Chapter 4). Since the find spot of the deposit is not certain, nothing more can be said about it. BELOW THE THRESHOLD OF DOOR BETWEEN ROOM OF THE GREAT PITHOS AND THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES, DOWN TO EARLIER PAVING. BOX 754. According to Pendlebury291 this trench was opened in 1930. In PLATE 24 the threshold seems to be at the same level as the latest TR gypsum floor, and probably part of it (see Chapter 4). In the recent cleaning of the area, a trench was found between the threshold and the WTR; could this be identified as the above test? It is possible, although this test is adjacent to the threshold not below it. It is about 0.30 m deep and two small rectangular slabs are visible at its bottom, perhaps part of a floor. It certainly needs further investigation. A few Minoan sherds and a conical cup were found, together with Neolithic sherds, obsidian cores and two stone items. Pottery A conical cup (126.a), like similar ones retrieved from the Cists N of the TR, is the only whole vase from this area.292 There were also two further fragments (i26.b-c) of similar vessels - all badly made. They could belong to Evans's MM IIlB293 or Warren's MM IIIb/LM Ia or LM Ia early date,294 see Chapters 3 and 4. Pendlebury saw the deposit as MM III-LM I.295 287 There are remains of the gypsum threshold only against the jamb bases; the centre, where this trench was sunk, was free of gypsum. 288 Pendlebury 1933-5, fig. 9. 289 Pendlebury 1933-5, 14. 290 Pendlebury 1933-5, 8- 291 Pendlebury 1933-5, 8» J4- 292 Hood 1996, 13, fig. 1.16. 293 Evans 1921, 317; Hood (1996, 13) agrees with Evans. 294 Warren 1989, 63, 72-5. 295 Pendlebury 1933-5, °-</page><page sequence="61">DEPOSITS UNDER THE LATEST FLOORS 45 To MM IIlB-LM Ia or LM Ia belongs part of the body of a large vase (126. e) painted in the dark-on-light technique: three parallel bands in brown paint running across it, and part of a spiral. From smaller vessels with an all over reddish wash comes a sherd (126. f): part of a rim and a strap handle with a slanting white bar296 of probably MM IB or IIa date. Also early (MM Ia) is a piece probably from a bridge-spouted jar (126. g), with a brownish- red wash.297 A further thirteen pieces exist (body, base and handles: 126. h): dating broadly to MM I- III. There is also a pithos sherd (126. d), with rope decoration recalling MM II- III pithoi,298 and some Neolithic pieces (127. a-c), including part of a cooking vessel, and a lug-handle.299 Stone Ten obsidian cores are known (128.1-10; FIG. 15): all, with the exception of 128.9, have small platforms and many parallel-sided, straight and regular scars, left by the removal of prismatic blades. These morphological features point to pressure-flaking as the method of reduction. 128.2 is perhaps more accurately described as a blade, being the distal end of a plunging blade that has severed the tip of the core. 128.3 is tabular in form, with its distal end much reduced. The large number of smaller (pressure) flakes on its surface indicate that greater care than usual was spent preparing this core. One (128.5) still carries a crested blade in position. The colour and degree of translucency vary. 128.1-2 are nearly transparent, shiny and black. The rest are matt grey, grey-green and may have darker streaks inside. The latter probably come from Melos, whilst the others are similar to those pieces analysed by Renfrew300 and identified as South Anatolian obsidian. One fragment (129) of the other stone pieces turned out to be a species of obsidian perhaps from Melos; it lacked all signs of having been worked. The other object (130) was of serpentine, with flat prepared surfaces, of which one carries scratches from some tool. It probably belonged to a table or lamp.301 Conclusions The exact depth and stratigraphy of this test are not known. It is not therefore clear if Evans reached the earlier plaster floor, which lies c. 0.30 m below the latest plaster floor302 (still visible at places over the gypsum floor). Evans3°3 assigned the earlier plaster floor to MM III; the sherds examined here cover a rather broader horizon: Neolithic, MM I and MM III-LM I. This material could be contemporary to the TR material. It is tempting to see the obsidian as significant, in view of the amount reported in this area (the VRD, this deposit and the following one from next to the Great Pithos). But we do not know if the obsidian belongs to one horizon (MM I) or to a wider range of horizons (MM I-III-LM I) and cannot say when or for how long obsidian might have been worked in this part of the Palace. 296 Both fragments may belong to small cups, the one with the strap-handle to a near straiffht-sided form. 297 My gratitude to Prof. P M. Warren and to Dr C. F. Macdonald for discussing the fragmentary vases from this deposit. 298 Dr K.

Evans306 wrote 'on the original floor here were found numerous "blades" or knife-like flakes of obsidian'. They have not been located, with the exception of four fragments of obsidian (131. 1-4) in the AM. The label on them reads 'From the barber's shop', a name Evans307 attributed to the Great Pithos room because of the 'numerous "blades'" found in it. There is a striking similarity between this obsidian and the pieces in Test iii. Evans saw the cups in FIG. 60 as MM IIIa and so did Hood.308 MM IIIa would, thus, be an ante-quern to the earliest floor of the GPR. WEST PILLAR CRYPT: TEST PIT IN SE CORNER. Boxes 752-3. One Minoan sherd, about 5 kg of Neolithic sherds, 375 animal bones and two stone fragments were recovered. Pottery A fragment from a roughly made, straight-sided cup (132), with thin walls and orange clay and wash, was found. It is hand-made and can be dated to MM IB.309 Pendlebury saw the deposit as Neolithic and sub-Neolithic, Furness310 as Late Neolithic. No Minoan presence was recorded by Pendlebury;311 it is thus possible that the Minoan sherd is intrusive. The Neolithic fragments come mainly from the bodies of vases (about 218 sherds: 133), rims (55: i33.b) and very few (8: 133.a) from their handles. Three whole, horizontal handles and fragments from five vertical were recovered. In addition, one fragment from the foot of a cooking pot and four from the bases of various vases were retrieved. A few rims have incised decoration: horizontal lines or dots and herring-bone designs. A very few have knob-like decorations. Stone A fragment was found from a serpentine pounder (134; FIG. 15);312 also a round stone (135), with a flat surface on one side, of quartz-veined limestone. This last shows no trace of use. Bone About 375 bone fragments (136) were studied. 62.4% could be identified (see Appendix II); 37.6% could not because of their fragmentary nature. Eighty-seven of them belonged to domesticated animals (sheep, goat, pig and cattle), while 17 belonged to wild animals.313 Something midway between the domesticated and the wild bull or ox was recognized.314 304 Evans 1935, 634, fig. 622. 305 Remains of this later plaster floor are visible today after a thorough cleaning of the room, see Chapter 4. 306 Evans 1935, 635 n.2. 307 Evans 1935, 635 n.2. 308 Evans 1921, 589; Hood 1996, 12. 309 According to Cadogan et al. 1993, 21-8. 310 Furness 1953, 102, fig. 3. 311 Pendlebury 10,33-^, 8. 312 Pounders of the same general type are common; see Evely 1984, 225. 313 On the Neolithic fauna of Knossos see Warren et al. 1968, 24.1-62. 314 Dr G.

Though there is no similarity in the nature or amount of material between this and the VRD (the Minoan presence here represented only by the cup) they are of roughly the same date. EAST PILLAR CRYPT: TEST PIT N OF W CIST. Box 757. About 1 kg of Neolithic sherds315 was recovered, together with an animal tooth and two fragments of bone. Pottery The Neolithic sherds316 comprise fragments (41: 137. a-f) from the bodies of vases: 11 (137. c) of these are ornamented with incised zig-zags, sets of parallel lines and elongated dots. Rim fragments (10: 137.a), straight or everted, exist, two of which have incised decoration (137. b); also two horizontal handles and pieces of another two (137.6, f ). EAST PILLAR CRYPT: TEST PIT N OF E CIST, AND TO 1 MTR. Box 758. About 1 kg of Neolithic sherds was recovered, together with a LM IIIA2 sherd. A fragment of painted plaster and a stone tool were also found. Pendlebury317 saw the deposit as Neolithic and sub-Neolithic; the LM IIIA2 sherd may be intrusive. Pottery A sherd (138) of orange fabric, with decoration in darker orange-brown paint is probably from a LM IIIA2 kylix.318 The Neolithic comprises body and base sherds (26: 139. a-e): two (139.a) of which have incised decoration: elongated dots; rims (7: 139.a), both straight and everted, one (139.1*) with incision in the form of a horizontal line below the rim proper; and two pieces of rounded handles (139.C). Fresco A fresco fragment is perhaps of MM date (140): on a white (lime) plaster backing it has dark blue and red bands.3I9 Conclusions Evans excavated viii and ix in the same room. Their finds are similar. It seems that these trials went almost immediately into the Neolithic strata. The LM IIIA2 sherd is probably an intrusion. EAST PILLAR CRYPT: SW CORNER Deposit found by Hutchinson320 and Platon,321 and partly excavated by the author.322 This deposit was associated, according to the excavators, with an earlier burnt gypsum floor.323 315 Pendlebury (1933-5, 8) also presented the deposit as purely Neolithic. 316 Furness 1053, 102, fíe:. 3. 317 Pendlebury 1933-5, 8. 318 I am grateful to Prof. P.

W. 1.30. Dep. 0.10-0.15 m), in the SW corner of the crypt, which I believe is Platon's and Hutchinson's test. Two gypsum slabs were revealed extending N from the S wall, and having a strong tilt down to the N. Cleaning of the trench in 1995, and the removal of the hard plaster that covered most of the gypsum slabs, brought to light a structure: five rectangular gypsum slabs set horizontally (the four in pairs N-S, the fifth extending E-w), and the remains of two vertical slabs, which create a rectangular cist-like structure. The original excavators missed these vertical slabs, because they were covered by the plaster mentioned above (see also Chapter 4). The N-S vertical slab projects below the horizontal slabs and is sitting on pink kouskouras. Below the horizontal slabs was a thick layer of burnt black soil; the slabs are also heavily burnt. It is significant that no such burnt material was recorded in trenches viii and ix immediately to the N and NE of the structure, where Neolithic layers were found under the gypsum floor. This suggests that it was only along the S side (or the SW corner) of the Crypt that the Neolithic was cut, to insert the structure. It is not clear whether this material was burnt while in situ, or was brought, from elsewhere, to be used as the bedding for the structure. If from cists, the horizontal slabs could be either the covers or the bottom slabs. It is possible that they were originally the bottom slabs of the cists and that later the vertical slabs were broken and pushed down, so that the whole was levelled, perhaps, to be used as a floor. It is strange, however, that it exists only in the SW part of the room. Extending the trench at its NE corner brought to light the cutting made by Hutchinson and Platon as well as another cutting made by the Minoans, probably for the insertion of the vat W of the pillar, during which they partly destroyed the structure. Perhaps at the same time, they covered the sunk horizontal slabs with a hard plaster and used the whole structure as the support for the gypsum floor now visible. The few sherds found in the pit opened by the Minoans point to a possible MM III/LM Ia date. The material found by Hutchinson and Platon has not been located. Their short account mentions a stone lamp (141.a); a few handleless cups (i4i.b), a jug (141.C) with a cut-away spout and a spiral rising from the base, and animal bones (141.a).324 This group was in a burnt layer, presumably the same still visible under the structure and extending E, where Platon's and Hutchinson's trench was identified. Platon dated this to the Old Palace period,325 while Hutchinson,326 most probably with the Vat Room Deposit material in mind, placed it in MM Ia. Momigliano, however, suggested that 'a burnt level of destruction is typical of the MM IIa phase,327 for which we should now read MM IB.328 The recent excavation of the burnt soil in the NE corner produced animal bones (141. k), pieces of pumice (141. j), all burnt. Also retrieved were half of a round object of stone (141. i) and various sherds of Neolithic (141. h) and Minoan (141. g) date, including conical cups (141. f) and the foot of a MM Ia329 cup (141.0). Further investigation of the gypsum structure may determine its nature and precise date. 32+Cook 1946, 117. 325 Platon IQ54, 433. 326 Hutchinson 1962, 165; Cook 1946, 117, fig. 7. 327 Momigliano 1991, 168. 328 Cadogan et al. 1993, 21-8; also MacGillivray 1994, 48-9. 329 I thank Dr C.

Conclusions This trial reveals a picture similar to that of the VRD. The deposit is significant for having material that may be contemporary with the VRD, and had been caught in a destruction by fire, possibly that which destroyed the Vat Room shrine. If cists are to be identified, their existence in the Old Palace period alters the appreciation of the Crypt since cist(s) show that the room had a storage use. They may have been part of the Vat Room shrine treasury. LOBBY OF THE STONE SEAT: TEST PIT IN NE CORNER, DOWN TO 1 MTR. Box 756. About i kg of Neolithic sherds (142), together with four animal bones (143) and two small stone fragments (NC) make up the finds of this deposit. Pottery The Neolithic pottery330 is mostly body sherds (88: 142), with some rim fragments (11: 142.a), one base (142. c) and one round handle (142. b). It is evident, once more, that the deposit comes from Neolithic strata, and this agrees with Pendlebury331 MAGAZINE SOUTH OF WEST PILLAR ROOM. 1ST M. 1 BOX '04'. Box 755. Although a magazine is referred to as the find spot of the deposit, Pendlebury placed it in the corridor S of the two Pillar Crypts.332 It may belong to area G ('Area South of Shrine, etc.'),333 and in that case, it should go with the G.I. 10 group in KSM '2nd Magazine S. of W. Pillar Room, T.P. 1 box '04'. It is, however, possible that both deposits have been assigned wrongly to south of the West Pillar Crypt since the rooms south of it are called 'corridors' in Pendlebury. 'South' may have been mistaken for north since there are two magazines north of the West Pillar Crypt. These are Rooms A and B (see Chapter 4). Because of the uncertainty of its find spot the deposit will be discussed here but it will not be included in the Catalogue. There were found about 22 Minoan sherds, 33 Neolithic and about 10 fragments of different bones (rib, spatula, cannon fragments and a tooth of a big animal). The Minoan sherds include a lid, a body sherd with tortoise-shell ripple, and two sherds with dark-on-light decoration, one of which, probably from a dish, could be LM III. Pendlebury saw all the Minoan sherds included in this deposit as 'intrusive'.334 If the deposit came from the Corridor S of the Crypts the date of the tortoise-shell ripple fragment could be used as the date of the creation of the corridor (see Chapter 4). Overall Conclusions It is apparent that the material from the VRD is different in quality, quantity and so, probably, in function from that in the other tests, including test v which, however, has some similarities. The VRD yielded luxury items (ivory and shell, rock crystal, faience, frit and gold); whole pots, some in sets. By contrast, Neolithic sherds predominate in the other trials and animal bones are regular. These are normal domestic rubbish.

In terms of quantity, the disparity is enormous. Everywhere outside the VRD, the presence of Neolithic below the stone floors seems to support Evans's remark that this portion of the palace is built 'direct on the Neolithic'.335 Recent work in the room immediately west of the VR336 and in the VR itself,337 reinforces this conclusion. However, Trial x may indicate that, though the finds recovered are hardly numerous, they still yet show that some earlier structures were not uprooted but used as the base for the later palace. Thus whatever the exact nature of the Minoan deposits below the paving for much of the CPS, they were no more than a relatively shallow, perhaps intermittent, presence. Certainly they were not of sufficient depth to allow for whole vases. Of itself, this observation lends strength to the argument that the VRD was deposited in a hollow or pit within the general high level of Neolithic strata in the area. It does not prove that a pit was deliberately opened (only re-excavation could do that), but the hypothesis is quite plausible, especially if the pit had a plaster lining as Evans338 suggested. As for MacGillivray's suggestion that the VRD represents a series of floors through which Evans cut regardless,339 it seems strange that of all the CPS so far tested, only the spot where the VRD was found should have a series of well preserved earlier floors. In the light of the recent work in the VR, a pit makes good sense. Evans was undecided about the nature of what he had found: once he wrote that the Vat Room 'goes back to the earliest period of the existing palace and was laid directly over the Neolithic clay . . .',34° and again that the objects had been collected and placed in a pit 'going down . . . into the Neolithic layer'.341 If one accepts the deposit as basically coherent and in a pit, there is still the question of whether it was a foundation deposit or a disposal of ritual items. It has been argued above that the fragmentary nature of the finds make a foundation deposit less likely but not impossible. A combination of events and motivations is always possible, when ritual material is laid down as a foundation deposit. Either way, the ritual or cult element is undeniable. The date of the destroyed 'shrine' would be within MM IB or slightly later. I assume that the VRD finds were originally in use somewhere nearby and not brought in from outside. The destruction, to judge from the soil in a vase (6), as well as traces of burning on some vases and the light baking of the sealings, was accompanied by a fire. This is also apparent in test x, and both may be connected with an Old Palace destruction, perhaps at the end of the first phase of the Old Palace. Further excavation may allow a clearer view on this point. The copper slag, the 'unfinished' state of some of the finds and the obsidian are intriguing, but it would stretch the point to see them as definitely coming from a workshop in the Vat Room Shrine.

Located in a small room N of the Great Pithos Room, they are sunk into the floor and are lined with stone. The TR were discovered in 1903;4 their presence was detected from 'a slight depression in the pavement in the east section of the room'.5 The ETR, slightly larger than the other, is built of slabs of 'hard grey limestone'.6 These are arranged in two tiers, their ends interlocking with a form of dovetailing (FIG. 64). The floor is a single thicker slab, slightly hollowed.7 Evans and Mackenzie both recorded that all the joints of the slabs were 'filled with cement and there were traces of a cement lining'.8 The WTR is of a different construction: blocks of limestone instead of slabs.9 They are arranged in three courses, each side made up of one piece, except that the S upper course has two blocks. All the blocks rest on 'a lower course in a single piece with the bottom of the 1 Evans (1902-3, 49) gave this name to the two big earlier cists sunk in the room N of the Great Pithos Room. The Repositories are referred to in the Catalogues of Heraklion Museum as the 'Underground treasury', 'Palace Shrine treasury', 'Shrine of Knossos'. 2 N of the TR and just S of the Antechamber to the Throne Room lie three cists on a N-S axis which according to Evans were sealed at the same time as the TR, since they contained similar vases (Evans 1028, 810-11, fie. 520; 1030, 4). 3 Evans 1899-1900, 22-3, fig. 4; 1902-3, 28-32, figs. 15-16. The cist found under the South Propylaeum is larger than the TR; it measures L. 2.35; W. 1.60 and depth. 1.50 (Evans 10,28, 600-702, fig. 43Q)- 4 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 86-91, 28 to 30 May) described the cists and made a quite detailed list of the objects. Evans sketched on loose paper, used as a notebook, many of the objects, especially the seal impressions, with short descriptions, see Panagiotaki 1993, 49-91. The material found in the TR was published in the BSA of 1902-3, 38-94 and in the PM 192 1, 463-523 for the most part; Evans announced their discovery in 1903 at Southport: paper kept in Ashmolean Archives. 5 Evans 1902-3, 39; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 86, 28 May) wrote: 'E of these (meaning the two oil vats) a sinking was noticed in the rough gypsum paving. This kind of sinking in other areas usually meant fill-in deposit which had set with time'. 6 Evans 1902-3, 44; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 88, 29 May) wrote: 'It was constructed of huge slabs of hard limestone of grey colour in two courses. Each slab took up the whole of the side to which it belonged so that the minimum length of a slab for the N and S sides was 1.57 and for the E and W sides 1.42'. 7 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 88-9, 29 May) recorded: 'The lower course of slabs was 60 cm reckoning from the floor up, the upper course was 90-95. The floor consisted of one large thick slab being the same dimension as the cist. It was grooved out on its upper surface, and the wall slabs of the cist were fitted onto the sides of the floor slab. The slabs were joined into each other at the corners in a manner calculated to prevent the sides falling in or out provided they were securely backed behind', with Sketch no. 3. 8 Evans 1902-3, 44; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 88, 29 May) wrote: All joinings were filled up with cement and traces of a cement lining were also observable'. The cement lining was looked at by Dr J. E. Bassiakos who thinks that it consists of lime and clay. 9 Evans 1902-3, 47; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 90-1, 30 May) wrote: 'The walls of the cist this time are not of slabs but of solid limestone block masonry. Also a single block goes the whole length of a side in every case, except the uppermost course of the S wall which has two blocks of fairly equal length. This masonry is in three courses which rests on a lower course all round in one piece with the bottom of the cist. This bottom of one huge block of soft limestone has its sides 28 cm deep. At the angles the blocks are keyed alternately as in good angle masonry, generally the joinings are carefully closed with very hard cement', with Sketch 4.</page><page sequence="88">72 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS cist'.10 Sets of almost square dowel holes are placed at varying intervals on some blocks11 (FIG. 56). There seems no pattern to their arrangement and interpretation is difficult. They may have held up shelves or a cladding in wood or metal.12 Three symmetrical holes in a N- S pattern (a central circular hole flanked by two oval ones) re-emerged recently after cleaning. Evans13 mentioned them in his notes and Fyfe drew two of them in a sketch (FIG. 56), but they have never been published. They are roughly at the centre of the floor (towards the w). Their purpose is uncertain: perhaps to hold wooden beams as a further support for shelves around the sides of the cist, or to drain out water.14 The cement lining of the TR suggests liquids were involved. Their original use may have been different from their final; they may have been used together with the cists to the N in some industrial process.15 The room also had two upper cists: one on top of the WTR, and the other between the two TR. The cist over the WTR was removed in excavation.16 In PLATE 24 it looks as if the S and E walls of the cist are still in position (at the SE corner), resting on part of the S and E walls of the TR. This could indicate that this smaller cist was built at the time the WTR was closed. The position of the other upper cist, an exact fit between the two TR, supports this suggestion. Mackenzie and Evans reported the same stratigraphy in the fills.17 Under the covering of the later stone paving was a clay layer 'of a reddish terracotta colour'.18 Deeper, the soil was 'darker with an admixture of rubble and charred wood'.19 The pottery came from this layer. It was 'closely packed'20 to a depth of 1.10 or 1.20 m. Fragments of gold foil were also found. Below this point the fill grew 'fatter and more compact', and it was here in about 0.30-0.40 m 10 Evans 1002-3, 47. 11 They are all rather large and of varying dimensions: 4.5 X 5 cms, 5.5 deep up to 6 x 7, 11 deep. 12 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 91, 30 May) recorded: 'The arrangement of dowel holes is a curious feature in the walls of the cist. They are all about .05 square and .10 deep. They possibly may have served to fix a lead lining to the walls, but if that was so the lead was plundered before the cist was closed'. Also Evans (1902-3, 47): 'They seem to point to a wooden framework'; and 192 1, 468: 'such dowel- holes in the masonry point in other cases to a wooden framework, but it is possible that there was here also a metal casing'. I feel that the large size of the dowels argues that at least the pegs that fitted them were of wood rather than metal. 13 Panagiotaki 1993, 53: 'floor flat with dowel holes'. 14 Today after a torrential rain, when the WTR was half filled with water it drained out fairly quickly through these holes; this may indicate that the holes are connected with a drain or that the soil under the WTR is loose. 15 The TR Room may have extended N, S and W when the TR were in use. They may have been part of an oil processing installation (together with the cists n) probably for perfumed oil. 16 Evans 1902-3, 44; 1921, 466. 17 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 29 May) wrote: 'It looked almost as if there was a distinct stratification and as if the deposit with the porcelain figures in whatever way it was to be connected with the ordinary use of the cist, had been already there sometime in the deposit before the vases and the other debris came to be thrown in on the covering up of the cists with the pavement'. Also Evans 1902-3, 40: 'The contents showed a distinct stratification'; and 1921, 466: 'The stratification of both Repositories was practically identical'; see also Panagiotaki 1993, 50-2. 18 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 86, 28 May) wrote on the ETR: 'The surface earth of the deposit was of a reddish terracotta colour - produced by the action of fire through the floor'; on p. 90, 30 May he wrote on the WTR: 'then successively reddish loose terracotta-like earth gave place to a deposit of large amphorae and pitchers like those of the other'. Evans (1902-3, 40) also recorded: 'The surface earth of the deposit was of a reddish terracotta colour due to the action of fire through the floor'; and 1921, 466: 'Immediately beneath the later pavement was a clay layer on which it had been set, in this case of a reddish terracotta hue'. Pieces of the terracotta earth are still visible along the S side of the WTR but if it owes its colour to fire, it was burnt before the latest gypsum paving was laid, since the last was not burnt. 19 Evans 1902-3, 40; 1921, 466; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 86, 28 May) wrote: 'Deeper down the earth was darker and had more intermixture of charred wood'. 20 Evans 1902-3, 40; 1921, 467; also Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 86, 28 May) recorded: 'From the surface of the deposit downwards to about a depth of 1.10-1.20 existed closely packed together a large quantity of vases the two prevailing types being the amphora and the pitcher'.</page><page sequence="89">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES 73 depth of earth that all the other objects were found.21 In the ETR, according to the early report22 and Mackenzie's diary,23 there were objects of faience, ivory and bone; a clay tablet, roundels and sealings; a marble cross, and stone libation tables; and antlers, carbonized corn and seashells. In the WTR, where the same kinds of vase were found in the same type of soil, the finds at the base of the TR were said initially24 to comprise the 'missing part, namely of the figure of a snake goddess just below her waist' of faience; a great quantity of gold foil with carbonized matter, crystal plaques and a disc; objects of bronze and a 'mallet of limestone'.25 Such are the objects and their distribution as described in the diaries and the annual reports of the excavation. In PM*6 however, Evans (probably partly influenced by his own notes,27 where he mentioned 'some other porcelain &amp; bits' apart from the 'zone of Goddess', but also because of the passage of almost twenty years since excavation) ascribed more faience objects to the WTR; he also placed there other objects such as the sealings and the beads which were found in the ETR according to the earlier publication and to Mackenzie's diary.28 21 Evans 1902-3, 40; 1921, 467; also Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 87, 28 May) wrote: 'At about 1.20 down an alteration took place in the character of the deposit. The pottery ceased and the deposit which looked fatter in character was no longer so loose as above'; and 88, 29 May: 'Of the deposit it was very noticeable that its appearance was richest where the finds were most plentiful and that this appearance of "fatness" culminated with the floor'. 22 Evans (1902-3, 44) originally assigned these objects to the ETR: 'In contrast to the corresponding layer of the other cist, faience objects were here wanting, with one notable exception - a missing part namely of the figure of a Snake Goddess just below her waist and showing a triple interlacement of snakes forming her zone'. In the same publication, however, (p. 62) he wrote: 'The most characteristic element among the contents of this Temple Treasury - except for a few scattered pieces found in the other cist, confined to the Eastern Repository - are the abundant series of objects made of a kind of faience or native "porcelain" '. 23 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 87-8, 28-30 May) wrote: 'The pottery ceased and the deposit which looked fatter in character was no longer so loose as above. In the deposit fragments of porcelain began to come out along with various kinds of seashells predominant among which was the variety called in modern Greek petalida. It was further noticed that some of the shells were painted in different colours : red, green, black. Then a great discovery was made among the porcelain fragments. Firstly appeared the fragments of two small porcelain cups with branch decoration in black, sepia? on the pale green ground of the porcelain. Then the bust of a statuette of a woman appeared with low bodice showing the bosom laced tightly in front by a sort of corsage arrangement. Then the bust of a second similar figure of slighter proportions was discovered together with other fragments apparently belonging to one or other of the figures. Further parts of the skirts of at least 3 figures were discovered there being 3 different varieties of ornamentation and pattern. Lastly, after some parts of arms were taken out, the head of one of the figures was discovered. There were a good many other fragments whose meaning we could not make out for the moment. Various kinds of seashells in porcelain came out with the natural shells, among these were several nautiluses of different sizes. Fragments of bulls* (*when put together afterwards it turned out that these were cows suckling calves) in low relief formed part apparently of the same design'. And 88, 29 May 'in the deposit and in the sieve a good many clay seals and other inscribed fragments were discovered'. 24 Evans 1902-3, 44-7 and fig. 24; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 90, 30 May) wrote: 'successively reddish loose terracotta-like earth gave place to a deposit of large amphorae and pitchers like those of the other. Then came the stratum at the bottom corresponding to the porcelain stratum of the other cist. Of porcelain, however, only one solitary fragment occurred but that of great importance, namely a part below the waist with entwined snakes of one of the figures from the other cist. Of gold leaf there was found a larger quantity than in any other single spot on the site and with these crystal petals apparently of some rosette design. There was also a large disk of crystal in two fragments with silver adhering to one side of it which may have been a mirror'. 25 In the Heraklion newspaper 'Qcovrj TOV Aaov' (1903, 8 June No 21) a catalogue of.the objects is given. Most agree with what we know but some do not; such are: 1. 'a mould used for the production of exquisite objects of porcelain', which according to the publication was found in the NW Treasure House, see Evans 1921, fig. 349c; 2. fragments of curved ivory with hunting scenes in which women participate; 3. several bronze ornaments. Also the numbers of beads and vases are given: 100 small beads of porcelain, 300 bigger ones and 50 clay vases; the number of the beads was never published by Evans; the number of the clay vases agrees with that given by Evans (see Vase section below). 26 Evans 1921, 462. 27 Panagiotaki 1993, 50-3. 28 Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 87-9, 28-9 May.</page><page sequence="90">74 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Foster and Kaczmarczyk,29 identifying the faience objects from PM,3° concluded from their analyses that the pieces in each TR were made differently, and might therefore come from different workshops. Certainly more than one workshop may have been responsible for the production of the faience objects, but to distinguish the workshops on the basis of differences between the faience objects within each TR is incorrect, an error that can be put right by reference to the early reports.31 Most of the pieces Evans published in BSA 1902-3 with illustrations have been found and studied. A few he talked of, but did not illustrate, have also been located, such as the third dress, and the third girdle.32 Some remain elusive: an object described and shown in his fig. 24, as 'clay partly covered with gold leaf',33 the 'limestone mallet', a gold button, and what looks like a crystal pendant at the left of the crystal disc.34 In fig. 20,35 the pieces 'c, f, g, h' of stone are missing. Of the 40 or 50 ceramic vases,36 over half of which are shown in PLATE 24,37 about 35 have been identified. Finally, a few faience pieces in the Heraklion Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, and the Stratigraphical Museum have been included because of their close stylistic affinities. Quantities of unrecorded seashells may also belong here.38 The above finds were not simply thrown into the TR, as was the case with all the other cists in the Palace; on the contrary, the objects were placed in the TR according to their material, the vases always on top.39 There was, therefore, a kind of stratigraphy which makes it clear that the objects placed in the TR were honoured and treasured, not so much because gold was involved but because of the figurines representing goddesses or priestesses; the idea that the figurines had been 'ritually buried with their cult equipment' has already been rightly expressed by Gesell.40 The fact that the objects were placed in cists and not in pits is unique; whether they were used as a foundation deposit for the later cists (and other contemporary structures) remains unresolved but possible. The Finds Most of the finds are in Heraklion Museum, though some items are in the Ashmolean Museum, the British Museum, and the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos. FAIENCE 'Porcelain' was how Evans and Mackenzie first described the faience objects.41 Neither 'porcelain', nor 'faience', however, is a precise term, as both contain mainly clay, which is 29 Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 148. 30 Evans 1921, 469, 486. 3' Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 86-91, 28-30 May; Evans 1902-3, 44. 32 For the third dress and girdle, see Evans 1902-3, 83. 33 Evans (1902-3, 46) wrote: A piece of clay partly covered with gold leaf also showed traces of an elaborate design in relief apparently of circular form and recalling some of the thin gold disks found in the Akropolis tombs at Mycenae', and fig. 24. 3+ Evans 1002-3, 47, fig. 24. 35 Evans 1902-3, fig. 20. 36 Panagiotaki 1993, 53, fig. 1 (b) 'about 40 more or less perfect vessels'. 37 Evans 1902-3, fig. 25; 1921, fig. 333. 38 I have included these seashells, firstly, because Evans recorded 'bushels' of them from the ETR (1902-3, 43), while only a few (the ones Evans had photographed), not enough to account for 'bushels' have been recorded and are on display in HM; and secondly, because among them were a great number painted in the same way and in the same colour as the TR seashells. Among them were also found faience beads like the TR ones. There is, thus, no doubt that these seashells belong to the TR deposit. 39 Panagiotaki 1993, 50-2, 85-6. 4° Gesell 1983, 95. 41 Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, vol. 11, 87, 28 May; ranagiotaki 1993,5o-1-</page><page sequence="91">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES 75 absent from Minoan 'faience' at least.42 Minoan has not received such detailed study as Egyptian faience.43 The analysis of 50 objects mainly from Knossos (now in the Ashmolean Museum) is probably the only comprehensive published account of the composition of Minoan faience.44 According to this, the main constituents of Minoan faience are silica, alkali and lime. The silicon dioxide varies from 84.3 to 96.7%, the calcium oxide 0.32-5.39%, the copper oxide 0.01-1.86% and the manganese oxide o.O3~2.33%.45 Three types of core are identified by Foster:46 i. White, fine-grained and soft. Probably made from 'powdered quartz (or washed sand), limestone and natron', ii. Creamy and less friable. These cores have 'comparable levels of Na2O and K2O which suggests the use of sand and limestone (or calcareous sand) with plant ash as the main alkali', iii. Harder and in several shades of grey. These were probably produced by mixing the sand with manganese dioxide. The glaze was presumably created by a method(s) like those used in Egypt;47 analyses now in progress will show the method(s) used.48 The faience objects are treated first. They were retrieved in great abundance (no other find, in the palace, or elsewhere in Crete, has produced so much faience), they are the most artistic and elaborate pieces in the TR, and they are the objects most representative of cult activity, since they include figures usually taken to represent deities or priestesses. Plants and Flowers Evans published one plant, three flowers, two buds, one fruit and a pendant with a flower representation.49 One of the best executed flowers is a kind of lily, made in the round (144; PLATES 9 «, b' 17 and 19 where an extra piece is added to the trunk). Evans presented it as part of a group with a trunk, stem and two pointed leaves.50 It is not clear, however, whether the trunk and stem belong to the lily, since their execution is not the same. The trunk is designed to lie flat, as its plano-convex section and the distribution of the glaze show.51 It is also rather too wide and stumpy for the lily, the overall effect being ill- proportioned and unbalanced. 42 Egyptian faience does contain clay occasionally; see Vandiver 1082, 174. 43 On Egyptian faience, see Lucas and Harris 1962, 178-92; Kaczmarczyk and Hedges 1983, 6ff; Vandiver in the preceding, App. A 1-143; 1982, 167-79 and 1987, 79-90; Tite, Freestone and Bimson 1983, 17-27; and Nicholson 1993, 9-41. 44 Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 143-57; see also Foster 1979; and Panagiotaki 1995, 137-49; on tne composition of the faience colours, see Foster 1987a, ^7-64. 45 Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 143-57: Present too at between 0.01% and 0.58% are such elements as iron, barium, zinc, lead, nickel, chromium, vanadium, titanium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, sulphur and aluminium. 46 Foster and Kaczmarczvk 1082, 14^-7. 47 Vandiver 1982, 168, 174; Tite 1986, 69-78; Peltenburg (1987, 10) states the three different methods of glazing used in Egypt: a) the application of a glaze as a liquid slurry or powder, followed by firing to melt and form the glaze; b) the firing of a layer of soluble salts which are effloresced or deposited on the surface from the fabric of the body during drying; and c) the cementation method, which involves the slow roasting of a body of crushed quartz buried in a container of a glazing powder; see also Tite 1083 and 1086. 48 The glazing methods on Minoan faience will be discussed in a forthcoming article with Prof. M.S. Tite and Dr Y. Maniatis. The technical aspects of the Cretan faience (Minoan and later) will be published in a forthcoming book. 49 Evans 1902-3, 67-8, figs 44-5; 192 1, 498-9, figs 356, 368; Panagiotaki 1993, 62-5, figs. 4a,b; 1995, 140-1. 50 See Evans 1902-3, 68, figs. 45, 63; 1921, 500, figs. 358, 377; also Panagiotaki 1993, 62, fig. 4a. 51 Inlays usually have glaze on the upper surface, as this was the only surface visible, unless they were produced by the efflorescent method, where the positioning of the glaze was not so controllable. Here the glaze may have been applied (application method) on the upper surface only.</page><page sequence="92">y6 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS The leaves are to be viewed in the round. The decoration of chevron-like lines, in black, is distributed symmetrically on either side.52 The lily flower (probably pancratium)^ has five pointed petals in the round, joined at their base, where a perforation may have held a stem. A small disc or button of faience or gold is suggested, intended both to carry the stamens above and perhaps to permit the joining of the separate stem at the other end. The technique and manner of decoration are the same as for the leaves. As both the leaves and the lily are in the round, perhaps the supporting stem was also;54 the whole flower would then be free-standing. If the piece were to be embedded in something, it would not have been made in the round, nor would it have had a perforation (unless we accept the possibility that the stem was inlaid and only the flower projected beyond the composition, as on the clay vase from Phaistos).55 Similar lilies in gold were found in the tholos tombs at Dimini and V0I0.56 The lily is a favourite flower with the Minoans, and comes in many species and media,57 and is probably connected with cult.58 145 is a lotus flower and two buds (PLATES 9 c; 19) with an overall glaze in light blue (greyish) or turquoise.59 It is depicted in the same way as lotus flowers in Egyptian wall paintings,60 but it has a small petal or leaf on the left side (a scar in the same position on the right suggests that there may have been another to balance), which is typical of papyrus as shown in Egyptian paintings. Although both the flower and the buds are represented in a most naturalistic way, they are left flat underneath, destined perhaps to be inlays. Three more buds were identified in KSM (146 a, b, c; FIG. 19). They may belong to this deposit, as Evans's notes indicate.61 The plant, whether lotus or papyrus, shows the Egyptian influence on the Minoans. In Egypt the lotus flower is probably associated with the goddess Hathor and is symbolic of rebirth,62 but we do not know if it meant the same to the Minoans. Papyrus63 was a source of 52 Similar decoration is seen in an incense burner from the Temple tomb at Knossos as well as on a spray, see Evans 1935, Colour Plate xxv. 53 On lilies see Cerceau 1985, 181-4, figs. 1-4; and on the pancratium lily, Sficas 1087, 276, fig. on p. 279. 54 The stem could have been made from some other substance, probably metal, which went through the lily to be attached to the stamens. 55 Levi 1956, 249, pl. 2, opp.p. 246. 56 See Kourouniotis 1906, 232-3, figs. 8-9; and Evans 1921, 96 fig. 68 a,b,c. 57 See Higgins 1980, 81; also the lily group from a fresco at Aghia Triadha (see Evans 1921, fig. 444), and at Amnissos, Evans 1935, Colour Plate lxviib; the lily vases from Knossos, Evans 1921, fig. 443; and on other ceramics, Evans 1928, figs. 266c, 276, 278b, 283; a fresco with sprays, Evans 1921, Colour Plate iv; a bronze plaque with repousse work at Zakro, see Platon 1969, 125.

The earlier report shows the lotus flower with two buds (Evans 1902-3, fig. 45), in 1921 (fig. 358), the two buds appear in combination with the two saffron flowers (i47a,b). In glaze colour the buds match the lotus. On an ivory tusk fragment from Mycenae the lotus flower is depicted with a bud on either side, see Poursat 1977a, 301/2961, plate xxxi, and Niemeier 1985, 43-53. 60 See the painted limestone fragment from the El-Bersheh tomb of Djehutyhotep of 1900 B.C.

However, fresco scenes from Thera65 and Knossos suggest that papyrus may have had cult associations (see below).66 147.a, b represents two saffron flowers (FIG. 19; PLATES 9 d; 19). 6y They are flat, probably intended as inlays. The upper surface is dark brown, almost black, while the underside is of light blue or turquoise colour.68 The dark upper surface may point to the species of crocus.69 Saffron flowers are known in frescoes and in other media.70 This piece and the scenes in Xeste 3 at Thera,71 demonstrate that they were held in high esteem in the Minoan world. They may have been cultivated for making saffron powder and may have had some connection with the divine.72 148 is a fruit Evans73 called a plum (PLATES 9 e; 19). A scar on its side may mean that there was a small leaf. The upper surface of the fruit has been treated in the same way as the saffron flowers, with a second coat of paint or glaze. The light brown upper surface here may suggest that the fruit is ripe. 149 is included in this section because, although it is a pendant, it represents a somewhat stylized Waz lily with tufts of papyrus (FIG. 19; PLATES 14 d' 19).74 It is a combination of a Waz papyrus and a pancratium lily.75 It is well delineated in low relief. A pierced cylindrical loop was placed horizontally at the end of the calyx for suspension. The roughly executed underside of the pendant may sugggest that it was framed or inlaid, or that it was intended for a statue rather than a human. Similar pendants adorn the crown of the 'priest king' and his neck as a necklace in the fresco from Knossos76 and are seen in frescoes in Thera;77 they also appear in other media.78 They are considered as objects with cult associations.79 64 Morgan 1988, 23. 65 Morcan 1088, 24. 66 On the cult associations of papyrus see Warren 1985, 199-207. 67 Evans 1902-3, 68, fig. 45; 1921, 500, fig. 358; 1935, 1013, fig. 063; Panagiotaki 1QQ3, 62, fie. 4a. 68 The flowers were originally coated in the grey/ blue shiny glaze and then the upper surface was coated with the dark glaze, painted with a brush (brush marks on edges). 69 Crocus cartwrightianus can be of 'dark mauve' and crocus oreocreticus 'violet or purple' and they both flourish in autumn (Sficas 1987, 277-8 and figs, on p. 279, 281). 70 For the House of the Frescoes see Evans 1928, fig. 271; Cameron 1968, figs. 4, 6, 12 and pl. B. A scene of the gathering takes place (Evans 1921, 265-6, Colour Plate iv). A Lady in Blue has a necklace of them (Evans 1921, fig. 398). On ceramics it exists as a motif (Evans 1921, 264, fig. 197), and as a garland element with spherical beads (Evans 1921, figs. 220-2). It also appears as a motif on the two votive robes and a girdle of faience from the TR (217, 218, 221); for the development of the crocus motif on pottery see Niemeier 1985, 61-3. 71 See Marinatos (1984, figs. 40, 44, 48, 60) the crocus gatherers in Room 3, Xeste 3 at Thera, and on a 'ritual vase' and an altar from the same building; also Doumas 1992, figs. 1 16-17, I25~6. 72 Evans (1935, 718) stated that 'throughout the whole of the Palace period one of the sources of wealth to the Lords of Knossos was to be found in the culture of saffron' ... 'In the ancient world, saffron was a favourite hue for the robes of Goddesses'; also 1935, 720; Morgan (1988, 32) also sees the cultivation of crocus as part of the maritime trade of the island; see also Marinatos 1985, 224-30. 73 Evans 1902-3, 68, fig. 45; 1921, 500, fig. 358; 1935, 1013, fig. 963; Panagiotaki 1993, 62, fig. 4a.; fruit have also been reported to have been found at Zakros, see Platon 1971, 147. 74 Evans 1902-3, 68, fig. 45; 1921, 499, fig. 356; Panagiotaki 1993, 62, fig. 4b; Higgins 1980, 65, 81, fig. 10; Morgan (1988, 23) calls it 'triple papyrus heads'; see also Niemeier 1985, 56-7; and Walberg 1989, 10. 75 Morgan 1988, 23. 76 Evans 1028, ^04, ^08; also Warren 108^, 106-208. 77 Marinatos (1984, fig. 16), the Cabin-Screen fresco: analogous lily pendants are hung in garlands alternating with spherical beads.

Being three-dimensional, the lily and its leaves cannot have been intended to be an inlay; all the others could have been. It is difficult to be sure whether the fact, that only the lily 'stem and trunk' pieces are not coated with glaze on the reverse, is of significance. Even though the others are evenly coated, nonetheless an emphasis on the upper surface is discernible in the relief details and the second layer of glaze on the saffron flowers and the fruit.81 The fruit could be the only one of many that has survived, and may have stood on a fruit stand in the shrine. Similar fruits have been found on stands in Egypt in religious contexts.82 Marine Objects Evans published the marine objects as one panel.83 There are nine pieces imitating rocks shown in Evans's photographs. In the HM catalogue seven are recorded, but only four are on display (150.a, b, c, d; PLATE 10 a); three more were found among the uncatalogued objects (151.a, b, c). Another piece is in the AM (152; PLATE 10 ¿),84 while a small fragment was found in the KSM (1535 FIG. 16). All are well made and realistic. A few have elongated grooves on their underside, probably guide-marks to assist the positioning of the piece in the overall composition, or to help glue the object. Similar marks are seen on the underside of the faience roundels from the Throne Room and on ivory and bone objects from the E wing of the Palace.85 All the pieces have shallow round depressions on the upper surface indicating that the artist was attempting to portray the irregular contours of rocks. Similar rock representations are seen in the Dolphin fresco86 from the E wing of the Palace, and in the House of the Frescoes.87 The portrayal of rocks in Minoan art is well attested in other media.88 Whether these objects belonged to a panel like that reconstructed by Evans is not known. The fact that they are glazed back and front does not have to mean that they were free- standing. The depressions, being on only one surface, may indicate that they were intended as inlays. There is no trace of any discoloration on the reverse that might be interpreted as the remains of glue. 154. a-1 consists of 12 cockleshells now in HM (PLATES 10 c' 17 at both bottom corners); 15 appeared in the original publication,89 of which 13 are in the HM Catalogue. The shells are highly stylized, with about nine vertical ribs and a projection on either side of the umbo. A real cockle has more numerous and finer ribs and does not have such pronounced projections. However, the spiky effect of real ribs has been neatly achieved. 8&lt;) Foster 1979, 81. 81 The existence of an all-over first coat may be the result of the method of manufacture, see Vandiver 1982, 168, 174, and Peltenbursr 1087, 10. 82 See Haves io,1^, 201, ^6-8; also Foster IQ7Q, V'- 83 Evans 1902-3, 69, figs. 46, 63; 1921, figs. 377, 379; Panasriotaki iqq^, 68, fie;. 6a, b: iqq^, 141. 84 This fragment was analysed by Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 146; (the core belongs visually to Type iii).

At Zakro cockles were used to decorate boxes.90 Cockles are represented in other media.91 Six argonauts are depicted in Evans's photographs (156-61). 92 Five are in HM (FIG. 16; PLATES 10 d, e; 17), one in the AM (FIG. 16). They are executed in the round, with external ribbing and small lateral projections on either side of the 'head'; inside, some are slightly hollowed. A natural argonaut, however, has thinner ribs between its main ribs (here lacking), and the projections are hardly noticeable. Thus, these models are somewhat stylized. The bigger pieces have the partial hollow opening out from their 'head', their spines are flatter and marked with vertical cuts, and they are highlighted in brown glaze. The smaller specimens have a spine made from peaks and no brown glaze. It is not clear whether they were in a panel together with the other marine objects; their size is much greater (proportionally and actually) and they are clearly three-dimensional. On both counts their presence in a panel may be unlikely; some kind of free-standing arrangement seems more likely. The lack of the brown glaze on the smaller pieces may mark differences in species. In appearance they recall Argonauta Argo L., which is native to the Mediterranean.93 As with the other marine species here, the argonaut is well represented in Minoan art94 from MM Kamares pottery to LM frescoes and becomes a common theme on pottery from LM IB on.95 Mountjoy96 has identified different types of argonaut on LM pottery; the large TR argonauts are close to her Type A (without the tentacles). The fact that the argonaut shell is created to house the eggs of the female may suggest that argonauts symbolize not only the sea, to which they belong, but also fertility. 162-3 are tne two flying fish published by Evans.97 Only fragments survive and they have been heavily restored (FIG. 16; PLATES 11 a; 17). They are naturalistic, though the wing tips are more rounded than in nature, and a vertical tail fin is missing. Overall, they resemble a species called Exonautes Rondeletiß8 They also recall the flying fish shown swimming on LM IB pots,99 and, as Evans pointed out,100 the fish in the Phylakopi fresco and the Vapheio bronze sword. 164 is a head of a fish formed in the round (FIG. 16; PLATE 11 b). The underside is slightly concave and with no glaze; if it was not glazed originally, presumably the object was intended as an inlay. 165 is the naturalistic fin of a flying fish (FIG. 16; PLATE 11 c). It is not straight, as on the above two specimens (162-3), but curves as if to depict movement. It is executed in the round. 90 Platon 1971, 145 ; also Vandenabeele 1990, 205. 91 For cockles see Higgins 1980, 81; also Reese 1989, 82-3, and Gill 1985, 80; a larger terracotta cockle was found in the walled 'rubbish pit' of the West Court at Knossos, see Evans ^ßö» IO2~3&gt; fig- 6o,&gt; another of faience from Knossos, but without the spiky effect, is in the uncatalogued material of HM; similar, but more stylized, representations were found in the workshop of the shrine at Zakro, see Platon 1969, 219; and in blue glass (parts of a necklace) at Archanes, see Sakellarakis 1967a, 281, fig. 14; and in ivory at Mycenae, see Poursat 1077b, pl. xiii. 92 Evans 1902-3, fig. 46; 192 1, 377, 379; Panagiotaki 1993, 66, fig. 6a. 93 Prof. A.

If marine creatures, they are not of any recognizable species. They could equally well be floral. An object (166) seen in the upper border of the panel, which looks like a ribbed worm, has not been found.103 Whether all these objects were placed in a panel, as suggested by Evans, or were in part free- standing cannot be determined. Evans reconstructed the marine panel having in mind the dolphin fresco from the Queen's Megaron,104 the marine fresco from Phylakopi, on Melos,105 and also scenes on gemstones.106 However, the only indication of the existence of a panel is the fragment of rockwork designed to fit in a corner. The argonauts, on the other hand, are too large to have stood in the same panel, and the fin of a fish (165) curves, giving the impression of a free-standing object. It is significant that such a variety of marine creatures is portrayed. Their existence in the TR may point to the veneration of the sea, perhaps in the form of a sea goddess. In the MM II period cockleshells appeared in relief on clay vases.107 The TR marine objects are far removed, in style, from those of MM II, and they may belong to the same cultural horizon as the LM Ia frescoes108 with marine scenes and the LM Ib Marine Style vases.109 The faience objects, made of a costly material, could (together with the frescoes) be the forebears of the (less costly) LM IB Marine Style clay vases.110 One wonders whether the recurrence of the representation of marine animals in art in different chronological periods (MM II, LM Ia/b) meant that in those periods the Minoans turned more to the sea, either because the land alone could not sustain them or after destructions by earthquakes. Land Animal Plaques A series of low relief plaques representing animals was found.111 Evans112 published three of them, while fragments of others appear here for the first time. Characteristic of them all is that the line of the body of the animal (the back) forms the upper margin of the plaque; Evans took this to be an indication that they 'were applied to a backing of coloured plaster'."3 He may be right, since in Egypt faience plaques, plain or polychrome, were used to decorate walls, often combined with wall plaster or limestone into which the faience was set."4 101 Evans IQ02-3, 71. 102 Evans 1902-3, fig. 46; 1921, fig. 379 on the upper border of the panel; in his notes he had drawn them among the flowers, see Panasriotaki IQQ3, 62, fier. 4b. 103 Evans 1Q02-3, fi?- 46; IQ21, fiç. 370,. 104 Evans 1921, fig. 394; 1928, fig. 2^1. 105 Evans 1921, fig. 393; 1928, fig. 251. 106 Evans 1021, fiers. 40^, 400. 107 Evans 1935, 1 16-19, %*• 82-6; . 108 Evans 1921, fig. 395; 1928, fig. 305. 109 Mountjoy (1993, 50) sees many motifs on LM IB vases as deriving from LM I frescoes; She also sees a 'connection of marine motifs with ritual' (1985, 240-2); see also 1078, 143-71. 110 On marine style clay vases and their ritual associations see Mountjoy 1985, 231-42. 111 Panagiotaki iqqcj, 68, fie:. 7; iqq^, 14.1-2. v_^ *-» *-» s~r ' ' * 1 w ' %^r %*s '_^ t x 112 Evans 1902-3, 71 and Colour Plate iii (where only the Goat relief plaque is shown), and 1921, figs. 366-7, 369; also Foster 1070, Q0-2.

For example, the plaque depicting a wild goat or agrimi has a base looking like rocks115 or mountain peaks (a setting out of doors), while the cows stand on something recalling isodomic masonry (to show that they were domesticated). Lastly, all the animals are shown in profile. Evans wrote, 'Although no perfect example of any single plaque was preserved, the fact that there were remains of several from the same mould has made it possible to complete practically the whole relief with absolute certainty'."6 There are, however, indications that each plaque was modelled separately. Grinding followed to create the details; in spots where there is no glaze, usually in parts of the surface which are lower, traces of the grinding tools are visible, together with accidental cuts. 168 represents a wild goat or agrimi with two kids (FIG. 17). "7 One sucks, the other 'stands before her, bleating for her turn'."8 The main outline of the body of the animals is picked out in black; the same outlining is seen along the back of the natural Cretan agrimi and recalls the antelopes in the fresco from Thera."9 The posture of the kid also recalls the way one of those antelopes turns to look back at her companion. One striking difference between the goats and the antelopes is that the goats are shown moving slowly (with the far leg last to move), while the antelopes look quicker and more alert. The similarities, however, are so close, that it seems almost certain that the Theran and the Cretan artist were exposed to the same stylistic traditions. This may mean that there was little gap in time between the Theran fresco and the Cretan plaque. 169 depicts a cow with its tongue out to lick the calf that it is suckling (FIG. 18).120 In addition to the main plaque, a horn extends well beyond its edge. This is in the round and most probably was modelled separately and stuck onto the body. The horn, which Evans restored, is not a true join, as a crucial piece is missing. A small unpublished fragment in HM showing the head of a suckling calf may well go with this plaque, where the relevant area is restored (174; PLATE 12 ¿).121 170 is an unpublished plaque showing the same isodomic structure as that on which the cow and calf of 169 stand (FIG. 18; PLATE 12 a). It also depicts bovids. It is included here because of its strong similarities with the TR plaques, and because it is catalogued with them in HM. The animals cannot be made out so well, but there are more than one cow or bull, as indicated by the position and direction of the legs. 171 is another unpublished fragment: it represents the head of an animal in profile, probably a cow, according to details of the size, the lines of the head and neck and the eye; though traces of what looks like a beard could make it a goat. Where the horn should be is a scar, indicating its existence. 172 is another similar fragment. It shows the head of a goat-like animal and the foreparts of the body (FIG. 20). The mouth is open and the eye in relief looks out calmly. Again a broken projection, broader than usual, marks the position of the horns: perhaps both were shown. 115 For a different view see Bloedow 1990, 76-7. 116 Evans IQ02-3, 72. "7 On agrimi representations see Gesell 1985, 63; that it is a goat or agrimi and not an antelope is indicated by its beard and its short stumpy tail (the antelopes have long tails and no beard). 118 Evans 1902-3, 71-2, Colour Plate iii; 1921, 510-11, fig. 366; Panagiotaki 1993, 68, fig. 7.

Evans presented three fragments from this composition, only one of which now exists.122 The line of the body does not follow the upper margin of the plaque: this indicates that the animal was part of a larger composition. Its position recalls the young kid on the goat or agrimi plaque (168) and a long element under its belly could be seen as the leg of its parent. Five more unpublished fragments in HM depict animals (174-177, 177.a). 174 shows the mouth of an animal suckling (PLATE 12 b); it is probably a calf, to judge from its size and shape, and recalls 169. 175 has what looks like part of the leg of a big animal like a cow (PLATE 12 c): all the power and slow movement of a bovine is captured. 176 indicates part of a rectangular structure, probably with alternating dark and light squares, like those on the Cow and Calf plaque (FIG. 20; PLATE 12 d). Two legs and feet may also be depicted, perhaps of a small animal. 177 is another fragment, most probably from the same plaque as the previous one (FIG. 20). A long leg-like element in relief probably indicates the presence of a slender animal. The glaze looks almost black, as if burnt. 177.a belongs to a set of fragmentary objects under the same HM catalogue number; it shows the knee of a bovine. A final piece is part of a curved horn like those restored in the plaques by Evans (178). It was modelled in the round. Five further fragments were identified in the KSM (179. 1-5; FIG. 20). They all exhibit the same characteristics as the TR horns, which is why they have been included here. 122 Evans 1921, 512, fig. 369.</page><page sequence="102">86 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Fig. 20. TR: Faience plaques depicting animals in low relief, horns.

They seem to have been made either by a single artist or, more probably, a school.123 All show certain shared characteristics in the way the lines of the body, the flesh and bones are portrayed. They betray a powerful hand not seen in the animal plaques found in the E wing of the Palace.124 In the goat or agrimi plaques the lines of the body are emphasized by black bands. The mouth is half open and the far back leg the last to move, suggesting slow movement. The eye is always triangular with the central pupil giving it a benign expression. In fact, the common theme of these is designed to bring out the tender side of such animals, unlike the ones portrayed in the Vapheio cups,125 or on a rock crystal plaque from the Throne Room at Knossos,126 where the power of such animals, when they defend themselves, is stressed. The shared peaceful atmosphere of the TR animals may hold a clue as to the character of the deity in whose shrine they are presumed to have once been. Perhaps the deity was a mother figure, kourotrophos, concerned with the softer and maternal aspects of life.127 Other Plaques Evans mentioned in the preliminary report various plaques and inlays, but did not illustrate any: 'of the minor objects such as the mosaic plaques and parts of borders of inlays, it is impossible to speak here in detail'.128 Later he said that the crystal disc and 'petals' were found in the WTR and referred to plaques of faience there too.129 Since neither in the excavation diaries130 nor in the original publications131 were such plaques assigned to the WTR, it is possible that Evans made a mistake, perhaps unconsciously influenced by the discoveries at Hissarlik and Mycenae,132 where rock crystal plaques were found with similar plaques in faience. It is possible that the pieces described below come mostly from the ETR. Evans eventually published a few of the plaques,133 but in a photograph in the AM more are clearly present alongside many objects from the TR (PLATE 11 e). As Evans often, though not always, used to photograph pieces from a common source as a group, it is possible that these all come from the TR. The published objects will be presented first. 180 consists of three fragments, to be seen in PLATES 11 e and 13 a' a fourth may be added from the AM (180 d). In Evans' fig. 344b134 the plaque is drawn as a whole and it is impossible to make out how many fragments it is made up from. In his notes Evans has drawn one fragment.135 These pieces are of great interest for the information they contain on the manufacture of Minoan faience.136 They are both modelled and inlaid. The core consists of two different fabrics: the centre is white, while the flanking pieces (nearly circular in section) are brown.137 Probably the white element was formed first, being left slightly convex on top 123 On faience workshops see Foster 1087b, 287-Q2.

Into the surface of this were then pressed at regular intervals thin strips or cords of brown (of varying width) to form a pattern of alternating bands. This approach was not easy, since the additional strips had to be placed in prepared channels at just the right moment when the core material was still wet and soft. Otherwise the inlay, as it dried, would contract and work loose.138 Here the process has been successful, and it is difficult to realize that it is an inlay and not merely painted lines. To the sides of the ornamented central segment were attached the flanking cords: these were separately modelled and probably positioned with the aid of a quartz slurry. These two pieces are smaller, and thereby permit the underside of the central element to protrude. As the underside of this was bevelled, the object cannot have been free-standing but was an inlay. One of the fragments has one narrow edge rounded, suggesting that it would fit with another piece to make a composite pattern. 181 was published, but not to scale (FIG. 21, PLATE 13 ¿).139 It appears to be composed of two fragments. Only one was found in HM, and only one can be seen in the AM photograph (PLATE 11 e). Another plaque has now been restored from very small fragments identified in the KSM (182; FIG. 21). These plaques are also inlaid themselves. 183 a-f consists of six rectangular plaques with mitred ends (PLATES 11 e' 13 è). Though photographed by Evans, they are not published anywhere. In Evans's photograph there are six plaques, but another one was found in the KSM (184; FIG. 21). The plaques are similar and exist as pairs. 185 1-5 is made up of five plaques (PLATES 11 ^; 13 c' 14 a). Evans published them together with the crystal disc140 and argued that they were all part of a draughtboard. A small fragment in the KSM may also belong here, as it is of identical manufacture (186; FIG. 21). The plaques are inlaid. 185 1, 3, 4 have one curved side, while 185 2 has two (one more marked) of different dimensions, suggesting that if they were designed to encircle discs, those discs would have been of different sizes (PLATE 14 a). 185 5 is somewhat different: much thicker, one of its narrow sides has been fashioned into a point that would fit with another inlay, but not a circular one (FIG. 21, PLATE 13 c). 187 is a similar plaque to the above, though larger and not necessarily intended for the same design (FIG. 21; PLATES 11 ^; 13 d). It is inlaid: white bands alternate with brown, the white being inlaid into grooves opened in the brown.141 188 is another plaque, with inlaid white bands against the grey background (FIG. 21; PLATE 11 e). 189 is a plaque reminiscent of the feathers in the crown of the 'priest-king' fresco at Knossos (FIG. 24, PLATE i i e).1*2 It is flat and its upper surface is divided into three parts at different levels. Evans identified 'darker bands' on its 'bright green' body,143 but they are not now detectable. pigment. The core contains higher Si (92.5%) and Ca (3.16%), while Mn and Cu are lower (0.1. and 0.09% each); the Fe at 0.60% is much higher. The green edging (155) is presumably that element of the basic glaze where surviving at the edges; it seems closer to the brown core elements than to the white (by %): Si 88.4; Ca 2.35: Cu 2.52; Pb 0.23; Fe 0.31. 138 The separation of the inlay from the body occasionally occurs in Middle Kingdom Egypt, but is used regularly and in a controlled manner in decoration in the New Kingdom, see Vandiver 1982, 176.

'Rings', 'Bracket3 and Shields Evans did not publish these objects but they appear in a photograph with other objects from the TR (PLATE i i e), are catalogued alongside the TR objects in HM and Evans145 sketched a shield in his notes. There is, thus, no question about their provenance. 190 is a 'ring-like' object, plano-convex or hemispherical in section (FIG. 24; PLATES 11 e; 14 b). It is difficult to think of a use, but perhaps it was meant as part of the hiking arrangement of a sword, probably combined with a rock crystal or gold leaf covering.146 It is also reminiscent of the circlets placed round the neck of ostrich egg rhyta, though too small to have served as such.147 191 is another ring-like object (FIG. 24; PLATES 11 e' 14 b). Its purpose is a puzzle but, being made in the round, it could stand on its own. It is similar to the earrings from Tutankhamun's treasure, but it is a complete closed circle, unlike the earrings, which are open so that they can clasp the lobe. It resembles a piece from Mycenae, possibly part of a sacral knot.148 192 was termed by Evans a 'bracket or console'.149 As it is fragmentary, it is difficult to be certain of its complete form (FIG. 24; PLATE 11 e)9 but it looks like a miniature stepped altar, or a stepped capital as suggested by Karageorghis.150 As an altar it would be very appropriate in this context. A small fragment (192.a) in HM may belong to this object (FIG. 24). 193. 1-5 is a group of shield-like objects (PLATES 11 e; 14 c). Foster151 included them in her publication, perhaps because they were in the same case in HM as many other objects from the TR, but, since Evans had not published them, their provenance was uncertain, until the discovery of his notes.152 Their shape is unique: it consists of two circles joined at a point, to give a pyramidal effect and a more realistic representation of the 'figure-of-eight'. Fine cords of different colours are placed at the join and both circles have depressed centres. In representations the 'figure-of-eight' shield is well attested,153 and there are large-scale representations in the palace of Knossos (LM Ia),154 as well as at Tiryns155 and Mycenae.156 In LM IB the 'figure-of-eight' shield becomes a regular motif on pottery.157 As a religious symbol it has been interpreted variously. Evans158 saw it as 'a means of spiritual possession', while Nilsson was uncertain about its meaning;159 Rutkowskil6° sees it as a symbol endowed with religious and or magical power, while Marinatos161 calls it 'an implement in the cult' which, 144 Panagiotaki 1993, 71, fig. 8. 145 Panagiotaki 1993, 64, fig. 4b. 146 Similar objects but in other materials and unperforated can be seen in Evans 10,3^ figs. 841, 848, 840, 851. 147 Marinatos (1972, pl. 36b), shows a rhyton of faience with a bigger circlet round the neck.

The last is important considering the context: the young animals in the animal plaques discussed above symbolize life and the renewal of life. Vessels Seven faience vessels (and fragments of more) were found in the TR. Evans presented a jug with spirals, two tall cups, two baskets and two bowls.162 The skill of the faience craftsman has already been seen in inlays and small objects, but it is best witnessed in bigger objects such as the vases, for it is difficult to use the fairly inflexible faience to make them. In New Kingdom Egypt vessels were often thrown,163 the vessels from the TR, however, seem to have been modelled in pieces and joined together. 194 is a jug with a spherical body, a slightly conical base, a neck with a somewhat cut-away spout and a round-sectioned handle (FIG. 22; PLATE 15 0).164 Its shape argues a metal prototype as stated by Foster,105 and its flaring handle recalls one such from Mycenae,166 but also a stone vase from Zakro.l6y It seems to have been made in pieces (neck, main body and base) and then joined together, though heavy restoration makes it impossible to be certain.168 The glaze is in light brown. Spirals in low relief cover the spherical body, in the same way that white on dark spirals cover the shoulders or belly of many of the clay vases from the deposit. The jug could be seen as contemporary with such clay vases, though its conical base, absent from the clay vases, (except one 32.C) may put it later. The metal vases with spirals from Mycenae are also later. l69 Even more exquisite is the pair oftall cups (195-196), which are almost identical in shape and could probably have been made by the same artist. They too seem to have been modelled in sections. The base and the cylindrical body could have been made as one piece, opening towards the top to receive a wide, separately fashioned rim. A strap handle joins rim and upper body. 195 has a single spray of a three-branched plant, 'fern-like',170 springing from a pyramidal base at the bottom of the vase, whence it spreads upwards on its cylindrical body (FIG. 22; PLATES 15 d; 17). The plant is dark against a light brown ground. A spray of rose leaves starts from the handle and trails across the wide part of the interior of the rim:171 all leaves are stuck on, one being adjusted to fit its position on the rim. 196 has three separate plants from three slighter pyramidal bases172 (FIG. 22; PLATE 17). The way the leafy branches or plants are portrayed recalls similar plants on the faience House façades from the Loomweight Basement173 and the gold spray from the same deposit,174 as well as the sprays on a gold cup from Mycenae.175 They are all presented in the same naturalistic way, which is surprising considering the chronological gap. 162 See Evans 1902-3, figs. 48-53; 192 1, 498, fig. 356 and 499, fig. 357; also Foster 1979, 61-4; and Panagiotaki 1995a, 1 1 8-40. 163 Lucas and Harris iq8q, icLQ-61; Vandiver 1082, 177. 164 Evans 1902-3, fig. 48; 1921, fig. 356 far right. 165 Foster iq7q. 6 a. 166 Karo iqqo-^, fig. 40. 167 Platon 1 97 1, 10, fig. on same page. 168 The vessel will be x-rayed to establish the manner of its construction; similar attempts will be made on a number of other pieces from the TR. 169 Marinatos and Hirmer i960, pl. 195. 170 Evans IQ21, 400. 171 Evans 1921, fig. 357a; Foster (1979, 63) mistakenly read this as a pilgrim's flask. 172 Panagiotaki 1003, 6^, fig. ^. 173 Evans 192 1, fig. 228ff, hh. 174 Evans 1921, 252, fig. 189b. 175 Marinatos and Hirmer i960, pl. 194 bottom.</page><page sequence="108">g2 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS 194 196 195 Fig. 22.

Its hemispherical body has a rounded rim; below, a cord was stuck on separately, forming a double rim, from which emerge four projections at regular intervals. On each a 'figure-of-eight' shield was stuck with knobs at the waist. The walls are irregular in thickness; the inside has been scraped and ground to become very smooth, while the less visible outside has been left with many imperfections and traces of tool marks. For the ritual connections of the Tigure-of-eight' shield, see above. The fact that the execution and finish are markedly superior on the rim and inside may suggest that the vase was embedded in some substance, and its lower part not seen, or that the outer surface was covered in gold or silver leaf, of which no trace exists now. 198 is another miniature bowl,179 made in the same way and perhaps by the same hand (FIG. 23; PLATES 11 e' 15 c; 17). In this case, however, the double rim is not so obviously stated, and the projections carry pointed leaf-like applications with a flattened disc or knob either side. These designs recall items found in the East Wing Treasury180 and may also be identified with a type of shield. Two more vessels of high quality were restored by Evans181 from one small fragment each (199-200; PLATE 11 e). What has survived appears to be of a finer workmanship than that displayed in the two previous bowls: the walls are thinner and smoother and the vases, being bigger, must have been correspondingly more difficult to form. 199 and 200 are basket- vases with two handles; each has decoration on its lip or rim. 199 has parallel incisions, while in the inner margin of the rim there is a small ridge (FIG. 23). On 200 there are seashells, possibly cockles which recall the MM II tradition of relief cockle shells on clay vases (FIG. 23), but the workmanship of this vase is so superior to what faience vases we know from the MM II period. 200. a is a strap handle, much finer than those on the tall cups (195-6). It probably belonged to a smaller and more delicate vase (FIG. 24). Beads Evans recorded 'beads here of which whole heaps were found' (PLATES 11 e' 16 c).182 A little more than two thousand exist in HM, KSM and AM, but it is not quite certain whether all of them come from the TR (see n. 57). There is a great variety of shapes: segmented, cylindrical, grain-like, spherical.183 The segmented beads were probably formed round a plant stem or a wire, by rolling when the faience was soft and malleable (201-202; FIG. 24; PLATES 11 e; 16 a). The hole is in most cases rather large and smooth-sided and is sometimes off-centre. A single cylindrical bead was found, with a large hole of the kind that would probably result from the method described above (203; FIG. 24; PLATE 16 a top left). A similar bead was recovered in the VRD (119). 176 Foster 1979, pl. 32. 177 Coldstream 1972, 228, fig. 83.2. 178 Sakellarakis 1995, 107, fig. on same page, top left: the cup has a small base which is absent from the faience cups and the leaves trail on the outside of the cup; however, the idea is the same. 179 Panagiotaki 1993, 65, fig. 5 top. 180 Panagiotaki ioo^a, 14.4.. 181 Evans 1902-3, figs. 51-2; 1921, 356. 182 Evans 1002-3, 62-3; 10,21, 400-4. 183 Panagiotaki 1995a, 146; for the classification of beads, see Beck 1928, 1- 71; for bead manufacture see Lucas 1989, 46-7; and Foster 1979, 2-3.</page><page sequence="110">Q4 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS 197 199 ^-s^ 270 yJ^/^^X 244 Fig. 23.

Most beads are roughly spherical (204. b, 206; PLATES 11^16 c). Very few are exactly spherical. They tend to be pear-shaped, depressed, angular or even barrel-like (or globular). Many are even less regular, and this is surely indicative of the method of manufacture: a roughly spherical ball was perhaps modelled first and then, when still soft, it was pressed onto a slender point, perhaps fixed firm in a thin base-board to produce the string-hole. The irregularity was caused by the pressure exercised by the tool and the fingers holding the bead. In some cases the hole was probably worked from both sides. The colour of the glaze varies. Most have no glaze at all, but others are various shades of green, turquoise, blue, dark blue, purple and purplish-black. Often the interior of the hole is glazed. One spherical bead has a turquoise base glaze with a spiral band of varying width in badly applied black: a poor attempt to produce a polychrome bead. In a few cases a single bead will exhibit two shades of colour, usually a shiny blue and a matt green. Foster and Kaczmarczyk made the same observation of the beads in the Ashmolean: 'Some of the beads recovered from the Western cist of the Temple Repositories exhibited more than one shade of green on the same bead. The latter glazes (eg. 1938.529b) contain considerably less calcium than the former (c. 0.2% vs. 8-9% in 1938.529a or c), and slightly more iron and manganese'.105 They went on to say that these colour variations may not have been intentional. These beads may have been offerings to the shrine. As shown on frescoes, garlands of beads and pendants were hung between columns186 or were combined with lilies.187 On the Theran frescoes they are paired with crocuses.188 In another Theran fresco a lady is wearing two strings of beads around her neck and wrist and is also holding a necklace of the same beads as the ones from the TR.l89 207-209 are rod-shaped objects (24 in HM, 16 more uncatalogued in KSM; FIG. 24; PLATES 11 e bottom right; 16 6), with one flat and three segmented surfaces. They are all unpublished but are included here because they appear in PLATE 11 e with objects that certainly come from the TR and because a rod appears in Evans's notes.190 They are of various dimensions and most are broken. They recall rods made of faience or ivory and covered in gold leaf seen in the Gaming Board.191 'Human' Figures and Articles of Attire I turn now to those pieces which may represent the powers with which the shrine was concerned, or their earthly representatives (210, 211, 212; PLATE 17). According to Evans, one of the figurines is to be identified as a snake goddess, the other two as attendants or votaries.192 There are other views, such as that they are snake-handlers participating in a ritual.193 Whoever they might be intended to be, they exemplify to the full the skill of the Minoan artisan and are among his most elaborate creations in this material. 184 Persson 1942, fig. 95. 185 Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 148. 186 Evans 192 1, 494, fig. 353 and 444, fig. 320. 187 On a vase from Tylissos, see Evans (1928, fig. 248). •88 Marinatos and Hirmer 1973, fig. 153. 189 Doumas 1992, 100-4.

One defect, which, it seems, the artist was unable to control, was the colour of the skin, which, unlike human skin, is in turquoise. They were found in fragments, mostly in the ETR:194 first the bust and then the rest of the bodies, a head and the arms. The part below the waist of the main figure was found in the WTR.195 Their restoration may be accepted as generally correct, although as a result it is no longer possible to learn details of their manufacture from investigating the interiors.196 They were made either in closed, multi-piece moulds or in a series of open moulds.197 Some modelling is also possible. Wire and pins of metal gave internal support and held the pieces together, to judge from incomplete examples, where holes have been located in the appropriate positions, and by reference to similar pieces in other media, notably ivory.198 2 io is the figure held usually to represent a goddess, as she is wearing a tiara and is encircled by snakes (FIG. 26; PLATE 17). I99 Most of the skirt, however, has been restored according to the pattern of 212. There is every indication that the work was pieced together from many elements, probably joined with a slurry or paste; the arms were made individually, a hole indicating how they were joined to the upper arms with the aid of a pin. Analysis around one such (215) in the AM showed a high presence of lead, suggesting that the pin was made of lead.200 The eyes (in low relief) appear to stare.201 This produces an abstracted effect, which is in keeping with the rigid and demonstrative pose of the body and suggests that a trance-like state is being portrayed.202 Snakes encircle the body and head. The snakes just below the waist are sizeable and form their bodies into a kind of knot. Those around the arms are smaller and are spotted. They are either of different species or of different age (mother and young is a tempting thought in view of the animal plaques discussed earlier). The embroidered bodice or jacket is very tight stressing, thus, the bare breasts of the figure; it is cross-laced with the low-relief thongs in black and is unique in the sense that it falls apron-like at the front and back but is much shorter on the hips.203 The short sleeves are also emphasized by black lines or straps, as are the lines from arms to shoulder. The whole impression is that the blouse was of a fine, almost transparent, material with embroidered spiral-recalling designs in black and also black trimmings. The same effect is achieved in the saffron-gatherers fresco in Thera204 where the ladies wear 194 Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, vol. ii. 86, 28 May; Panagiotaki 1993» 52-3- 195 Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, vol. ii. 90, 30 May; Panagiotaki IQQ3, W. 196 Most of their interior is filled with plaster and consequently one cannot trace their manufacture by mere visual inspection. They will be X-rayed. The person who originally restored them was Mr. Halvor Bagge, according to Evans, see Panagiotaki 1993, 57, fig. 2b. 197 Panagiotaki 1995a, 146. 198 Sakellarakis 1979, 56-8; Evely 1984, 242. 199 Evans 1902-3, 74; Nilsson 1950, 354-61; Alexiou 1958, 249, 256; on snakes see Gesell 1985, 62-3. 200 Foster and Kaczmarczyk (1982, 149) wrote: 'It appears that a lead pin must have beem used, since the area in the vicinity of the hole showed 0.2% PbO, whereas other parts of the arm only contained c. 0.06% PbO, a value quite close to the 0.05% detected in an almost identical glaze of the argonaut shell, which did come from the same Temple Repository cist as the arm'. 201 The way the eyes and eyebrows are made compares well with a head later in date (decorating a cup) from Minet-el- Beida; the hat too is comparable, see Schaeffer iQSQ, pl. x. 202 This trance-like state may suggest supernatural powers which are exercised on the snakes. Foster (1979, 73 n. 68) wrote that a 'contemporary Tennessee sect handle snakes as part of their service of worship, believing that snake handling proves divine anointing'. 2°:{ The ladies in the Room of the Ladies at Thera (Marinatos 1972, pls. G, H) seem to wear a skirt similar to that on the TR figure, with a flounced apron over it, which, however, terminates in two points at the front of the figure (the back is not visible) and is much longer than the TR figures apron. 204 Doumas 1992, pls. 1 16-21.</page><page sequence="114">g8 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS blouses like those of the TR figurines but without the apron-like piece. Some of the Kea205 clay figures also wear blouses with straps all around the breast, arms and sleeves. 211 is one of Evans's attendants, votaries, priestesses or 'doubles of the Goddess' (FIG. 25; PLATE 17). 2o6 If, however, 210 is deemed a deity because of her headgear and encircling snakes, so can this figure be on the same grounds. Her hat is low, with rosettes around it (only the front three are original) and a small feline on top. This animal is catalogued in HM under a separate number (211 a) because it was not at first identified as belonging to this figure.207 As the head was never found, and the present head is a complete restoration, this hat could belong to another figurine. The hair hangs down behind to the buttocks. The blouse is decorated with bands of different style. Parts of the flounced skirt are original. Seven layers are shown from waist to hem: each is divided into squares by the application of glaze to make alternating light and dark patterns. The light patterns have highlights of two vertical stripes: dark on one layer, pale on the next. The arrangement recalls the skirt worn by the Goddess with outstretched arms, on a gold pin from Mycenae.208 The border of the apron-like bodice, bracelets and snakes are made exactly as 210, and so must the arms have been.209 The feline is probably a leopard, as it has black spots.210 A difference between the figures is that the extremely tight bodice (shorter on the hips), the flounced skirt and lively posture of the second, suggest a younger person.211 If so, this may be another instance of the theme of young and old. Perhaps a mother and daughter are portrayed.212 The calmer pose of the first figure, with no apparent aggression in the way she controls her snakes, may show that she embodies the kourotrophos aspect of a divinity. This does not seem to be the case with the second, who flourishes her snakes, although it should be remembered that one of the arms is restored and it is not certain that it held a snake. 212 is only a lower portion of a figure: the skirt (FIG. 26; PLATE 17). Even so, it is much restored.213 Much of its design is painted on rather than modelled. The apron has its usual cord border and a pattern of applied or moulded knobs; the bodice carries its normal lacings. It is impossible to know what this figure was holding; perhaps one of the arms to be discussed next belonged to it. Three arms (213-215) are preserved, two in HM (PLATE 16 e), the third in the AM (PLATE 16 úí):214 each is different and from a different figure. There is also a hand (216; PLATE 16 e). Thus, once there may have been as many as three figures more, making a total of 5 or 6. Sockets of small size at their sections argue for metal pins or wire, perhaps of lead, to attach the arms to the torso.2I5 213, from a lower left arm, is longer than the other two. This suggests a figurine of considerable size. A snake of the spotted kind has been added to curl along the arm's length. The end of the sleeve of a bodice and a bracelet at the wrist were also made separately and 2°5 Caskey 1986, pl. 36a,b,d. 206 Evans 1902-3, 78; 1921, 501, 503; Panagiotaki 1993, 57, fig. 2b. 207 Evans 1902-3, figs. 56-7; 1921, 504-5; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 88, 29 May) wrote: As the whole of the deposit having been removed for sifting it was found that unfortunately a second head would not be discovered'. 208 Marinatos and Hirmer i960, fig. 200 left. 209 An arm is restored, see Evans 1 921, 501, fig. 360b. 210 Evans (1921, 504) calls it 'a miniature lioness or spotted pard'. 211 The youthful look of this figure is also commented upon by Gesell 1085, 87. 212 A Demeter and Persephone perhaps, see Willetts 1962, 148-52. 213 Evans 1902-3, 78, fig. 63; 192 1, 505-6, figs. 377, 382a/b; Panagiotaki 1993, 57, fig. 2b. 214 Evans 1902-3, 79-80; Panagiotaki 1993, 58, fig. 2c. 215 Foster and Kaczmarczyk 1982, 149.</page><page sequence="115">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES gg 1 &lt;U u in ¿ S) i ¿ä H d</page><page sequence="116">I00 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS 210 4s3|||slli§^ Fig. 26.

The snake's head passes into the oddly truncated hand, which is partly closed, with only the thumb properly distinguishable. 214 is of better workmanship. Another lower arm, its hand is clenched, though the fingers are well formed, but rather longer than would be natural. A wavy bracelet is set around the wrist. 215 is an arm divided off at just above the elbow. It has lost the hand entirely, though part of an added bracelet survives. 216 is a hand, but not of the proportions to match any of the arms above. The fingers are well formed, and a wavy bracelet curves down across the palm. Here the hand is open, perhaps to accommodate a perforated, conical object on the back at the base of the fingers: it looks like a large conical seal and may have been intended to be a seal hanging from the bracelet. The figures and the arms were made in the same workshop. This is evident in shared characteristics such as the detailed work on the dresses, the glaze colour of the flesh and the addition of the bracelets. Three robes (217-219) and three girdles (220-222) were found in this group (FIG. 27; PLATES 16/; 17). 2l6 Unlike the pieces above, they are two dimensional and plaque-like. They are surely all from the same artist as their form and decorative designs show, though in size they differ. They are probably modelled: the skirt in one piece, the upper body covering in another. Imperfections in the modelling exist, usually at the edges. Basically, a short- sleeved bodice is connected at the waist by a double girdle to a full length skirt below worked in low relief, its reverse flat and the design painted in variously coloured slurries. Evans217 wrote, 'The larger . . . is, like the other, in two pieces superposed on one another at the junction of the two curves of the double girdle. Both halves show a small perforation going right down the centre, evidently for the wire or string by which the garment was suspended'. In 219, the largest and unrestored example,218 one can see the hole that Evans talked of (PLATE 16/). It penetrates the skirt vertically.219 Another depression visible on the upper part of the girdle may be an abandoned second hole or have been intended to take a small locating pin for further local security. The decoration is the same on all the skirts, a double 'canopy containing a clump of flowers, apparently crocuses'.220 Later Evans wrote, 'On the front of the two skirts appears a kind of "Watteau" panel with a group of the sacred saffron-flowers, in which the influence of Egyptian lotus clumps is clearly traceable'.221 Analogous saffron flowers and clumps of the same are seen on the Saffron Gatherer fresco,222 and notably on a fresco in Building Beta, at Thera.223 According to Popham,224 Evans225 saw in the flower decoration of the robes the influence of New Kingdom Egypt and concluded that the beginning of the New Kingdom 'must have preceded that of the great Earthquake that took place toward the close of MM III'. 216 Evans 1902-3, 81-3, figs. 58, 63; 1921, 506, figs. 3Ö4a/b, 377; Foster 1979, 86-9; Panagiotaki 1993, 59, figs. 3a,b; also i995a&gt; *46-7- 217 Evans 1002-3, 81. 218 Panaeriotaki 1003, rq, fier.

TR: Faience dresses and girdles. Scale 1:2; 222 2:3.</page><page sequence="119">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES ^3 The part of the girdle that survives on 219 was stuck onto the skirt. Its upper portion rises above the top of the skirt thus, first, concealing the wire that holds the pieces together, and secondly, giving a more three dimensional aspect to the girdle. On this last is a black wavy line recalling the contours of a writhing snake. Perhaps this could be taken as some evidence that Evans was correct in associating the girdles with snakes around the hips of the goddess, when he suggested that they represented 'mummified snakes'.226 220 and 221 are the two girdles Evans227 published (FIG. 27; PLATE 17). 220 shows well- executed asterisks and crosses in consecutive circles, while 221 has crocuses, the stems of which curve to create spirals. All are delineated in black, probably standing in low relief above the golden-brown glaze. The designs are much faded today. Evans also spoke of a third girdle which shows a 'Vandyke pattern' (FIG. 27). 228 The located fragment (222) is hardly recognizable as a girdle and no design is visible except for three black bands created by a rather thick black slurry on top of a golden-brown glaze, traces of which exist. All three pieces were probably modelled. Two cords of the basic faience mixture, but of differing sizes, were fashioned, then bent into a curve, and finally joined along the side. The cracks in the fabric indicate the pressure that was exerted as the cores were deformed almost into semi-circles. These robes and girdles point to a religious aspect in the material recovered from the TR&gt; and by association the general area. They may have been offered to the deity or deities in a manner akin to the dedication of items of dress (real or in representation) depicted on Minoan seals,229 or in contemporary Theran frescoes,230 or in Classical Greece, such as the peplos offered annually to Athena in the Parthenon at Athens. Their position in the shrine, however, is not clear; were they suspended as Evans thought, or were they embedded in plaster or wood? The crocus or saffron flower is clearly a flower of symbolic importance to the Minoans: it is seen here on all the dresses and one girdle. The fact that the crocus is amply represented in LM Ia pottery and is frequent on Theran frescoes231 may suggest that the faience robes were contemporary to LM Ia pottery and the Theran frescoes. Conclusions Two broad thematic groupings can be isolated in this material. One focuses on the flora and fauna of the natural world; the other concerns the figurines and associated articles of clothing. The figurines seem to represent the goddess or priestess(es) in whose honour a shrine had been established. The flora and fauna can be seen as symbolizing the sphere(s) of influence of the divinities concerned. Some confirmation for this connection comes from the clear association of snakes, felines and crocuses with the figurines. Among the figurines (about half of which, it is suggested, appear to be missing now), it is difficult to point to a central one. They are all upright (no seated figures were found), two have headgear (tiara and hat), whilst the third lacks the relevant portion; snakes are present wherever the relevant parts of the figurines survive; their dress is broadly comparable. In size, that without the upper torso (212) would have been the largest. Evans's views notwithstanding, 226 Evans 1902-3, 83. 227 Evans 1902-3, 83, figs. 58, 63; 1921, 506, figs. 3640/0!, 377. 228 Evans 1902-3, 83; Panagiotaki 1993, fig. 3a. 229 Marinatos 1986, 58-61; 1993, 144-5. 230 Marinatos 1984, 97-105, figs. 68-g, 71. 231 Marinatos 1984, figs. 40, 43, 493; Morgan 1988, 29-32.</page><page sequence="120">!04 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS it is difficult to single out any as holding the central role. If any distinction is to be made between aspects or persons, it will have to be derived from facial details or overall stance, clearly a subjective matter. I have already tentatively suggested a tender and maternal kourotrophos, and perhaps a younger daughter figure. What is important is that the figures are all made of faience, the only such in the Minoan world, apart from the VRD human arm, and they share the same characteristics. They also carry snakes, a tradition that probably began with the EM clay figurines in the Mesara232 and is seen again in the post palace period.233 The nurturing aspect is picked up emphatically by the plaques of the goat and cow with young, but also by the stressed breasts of the goddesses themselves. Nature with no signs of aggression is also represented in the plants, marine life and snakes. Whether the concern of the divinity was for the natural world in general, or whether various areas of responsibility are being separately presented, is a matter for conjecture.234 The considerable emphasis on marine life (fish, shells, argonauts and the numerous natural painted seashells) is not surprising for an island race, although I cannot help thinking that it shows the Minoan respect for the sea, if not veneration of it.235 The sea must have belonged to the spheres of influence of the goddess(es). The only element not covered is the air: no images of birds or insects in faience were found unless one sees the flying fish as ca link between the bird and the fish'.236 The snakes clearly had a significant role to play: they must be partly symbolic, probably with a chthonic aspect and/or connected with the oikos237 (a role perhaps extended to embrace the whole palace); Goodison sees it as an 'emblem of regeneration',238 a theme appropriate in the TR. The other use of the faience in the Shrine was to embellish its shrine furniture or votive offerings. Many of the floral and faunal pieces were probably inlays. The plaques in geometric shapes and the so-called rods must have also been used as inlays; parallels to gaming boards have been drawn above. Where exactly the 'shield-like' objects fit in is debatable. A powerful symbol, they often appear as inlay or on encrusted work in several media. Finally, the vessels are the effective equivalents in faience of vessels known to have existed in precious metals, stone, and clay in religious contexts. The floral decoration on some fits my suggestions above. CLAY SEAL-IMPRESSIONS AND RELATED OBJECTS Mackenzie reported in his daybook the recovery of sealings from the ETR239 and so did Evans.240 In his later statements, however, Evans recorded that 'the Western Repository contained a variety of important relics. A clay tablet and three discs presenting inscriptions of the Linear A script, as well as a hoard of 150 clay seal impressions'.241 In the same publication he referred to the WTR as the place where the sealings were found at least two more times.242 Since Evans and Mackenzie assigned the sealings originally to the ETR, it looks as if a 232 Xanthoudides 1924, pl. II, XIX; Branigan 1969, 34-5; for a different view see Marinatos 1993, 148 n. 6. 233 Marinatos 1993, 221-7; Goodison 1989, 51-2, 82. 234 Cameron (1987, 324) saw the Knossos goddess as representing 'the unity of nature in its multiple expression'. 235 See also Mountjoy 1985, 231-42. 236 Goodison iq8q. qo. 237 See Nilsson iq^o, 321. 238 Goodison 1989, 51. 239 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 88, 29 May) stated in connection with the East Repository: 'In the deposit and in the sieve a good many clay seals and other inscribed fragments were discovered belonging to the same period as the figures and tending to show the connection of those with the religious usage'. 240 Evans 1902-3, 51. 241 Evans 1921, 496. 242 Evans 1921, 505, 515.</page><page sequence="121">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES l0^ mistake was made later, either because of the lapse of nearly two decades from the original to the final publication or because of a misreading of the original notes. What is important is that the sealings are many and are from a closed dateable context. On discovery Evans wrote of 'fifty different designs, besides about a dozen in too imperfect a condition to be made out with certainty'.243 The short list of the seal themes and figures of 13 sealings was extended in PM.2^ Mainly on the basis of these figures, Gill245 identified 82 sealings in Heraklion Museum, and a few more were identified by Kenna246 in the Ashmolean Museum. More recently, Weingarten247 has added three more, Pini248 one, and Hallager249 two roundels. The discovery in the Ashmolean Museum of 21 loose pages with sketches and short descriptions,250 used as a notebook by Evans, has helped to complete the catalogue of the TR sealings. Through these notes the following seal impressions have been recognized and added to the TR corpus: L2. as one side of HM 355, 356 (2), 1248; L3, 33 (one variety) as the other side of the above; L23 as HM 1272; L34 as HM 344; L37 as HM 353; L44 as HM 1186.251 Evans made 44 annotated sketches252 under the heading 'Sealings from Porcelain Deposit' and mentioned six more, which he did not draw.253 Two that he drew, and described as 'Cabin 1' (HM 354 combined with a cross with elongated dots) and '2 agrimia seated 2' (HM 355, 356 combined with L21), he had missed in the initial publication.254 He also omitted to describe a few impressions, which were combined with others which he did describe. These are the following: HM 404, a dog's or horse's head; HM 389, a grain stalk and sun design; HM 346, a curvilinear design; and probably HM 399, an architectonic design. The six impressions he referred to but did not draw are 'Doubtful 10 12', 'Goddess and lion 10 11', 'Man-sea monster 5', 'Armed God shield 5', 'Boxer 1'. Two of the sealings already published are missing from Evans's notes. They are in Evans's255 and Gill's256 catalogue L29 ('She-goat and kid'257 or 'parturition'258 HM 1240) and L4s ('scene of the bull-leaping'259 HM 396). Their absence from Evans's notes may mean that they were included in the 'doubtful 12' at the time, or that not all the pages originally used have survived. Nevertheless, representations of these two sealings were found together with others already drawn here, among drawings cut out for publication in the Ashmolean archives.260 A few sealings that Evans261 knew have not been identified: L2s, 30, 3, 33 (one variety). When we add the 44 drawings Evans made to the six impressions he referred to, and also the two published designs, which he has neither drawn nor referred to in his notes, we have 52 designs.

The error concerns the number of the sealings as opposed to the number of the impressions each seal may have. Evans referred to 160264 or 150265 sealings found in the TR. It is, however, evident from his notes that he confused the number of impressions written next to each drawing with the number of the sealings, the objects themselves.266 Some more discrepancies are also evident: Lie and Li7? where originally he drew the same scene twice, once upside down and calling it 'canopy' and again reversed with the caption 'or boat'. Later he took the sketches to represent two different items, referring to them as 'design apparently representing a canopy with four forked supports. Two varieties.'207 L15 is termed 'Uncertain subject with crescents or stands' and may be the same as L22, 'three tree stems apparently growing out of rocks'.268 L34 'Goat seated looking back: apparently a cruciform symbol below'209 is roundel HM 344 (233), on which a goat is seated looking back, and a cruciform-like ideogram270 on the one flat surface was taken by Evans to be a cross. Discrepancies also exist in the numbers of the sealings Evans271 had originally seen and described (in his notes) and what survives today in the museums. In the case of the sheep/goat with seashells on reverse (HM 333: 223 (6 items), 334: 224 (2), 335: 225 (4), 387: 255 (2), and 1938. 1439. a-c: 278; PLATE 19 fl, 6), Evans has listed 15 for the sheep/goat and 16 (in ink) + 3 (in pencil) for the seashells. If there were once 19, there are only 17 today; two are lost. For the crab and pallium set (HM 388: 256 (9 items), 1938.1440.a-b: 281; PLATE 18 e9f)9 Evans gave 14 for the crab and 12 for the pallium: therefore three are missing. Finally, in the 'Goddess and lion' group, Evans gave a total of 11, while a dozen exist now, though one is barely recognizable. The extra piece must have been included in the 'Doubtful 12' in Evans's notes,272 or else Hogarth was right when he assigned it to Zakro.273 Evans identified sealings and roundels in his descriptions, but not what Weingarten called noduli.274 He drew a pair of roundels (HM 345, 413: 234) life-size because of his interest in their inscriptions, while another (HM 344: 233) was drawn smaller with a description of the designs and numbers round the edge of the roundel. Of the others he sketched, often his comments 'on side . . .' or 'on edge . . .' show that he was talking about the roundels. Sealings When Evans first referred to sealings he stressed the fact that they had sealed objects275 'attached by strings or threads that ran through them, and of which traces remained, to documents on perishable materials, perhaps parchment, or even papyrus, relating to the Sanctuary'. These are the 'flat-based' sealings, which Pini276 had originally called 'parcel', Weingarten277 'flat-based' and I 'leather package'.278 They sealed soft leather 'documents', 263 Evans 1902-3, 54-60. 264 Evans 1Q02-3, 54. a65 Evans 1021, 40,6. 266 See Panagiotaki 1993, 88-9; 1995b, 714. 267 Evans 1902-3, 54. 268 Evans 1902-3, 54-5. 269 Evans 1902-3, 55. 270 Hallager 1987, 63. 271 Panagiotaki 1993, 75-83, figs. na-e. 272 Panagiotaki 1993, 81, fig. ne. 273 Hogarth iqio-ii, 264. 274 Weingarten 1088, 3; iqqi, qo6. 275 Evans 1902-3, 54; on the underside impressions of sealings and administration, see Ferioli and Fiandra 1080, 41-53. 276 Pini 1083, 560-2. 277 Weingarten 1983, 8-13; 1988, 5; and 1994, 182; also Hallager iqo6, 135-58. 278 Panagiotaki 1995b, 716-7; Hallager maintained the 'flat- based' term which I have also adopted after talking with Profs.

Evans himself noted only 5 of these in his notes. Since this would be the sixth, I include it in the TR corpus because of the similarity of its clay to the TR sealings' and because it was grouped together with them, but would place it rather among the doubtful class. All these sealings were used to fasten and safeguard property. This is indicated by the existence of string impressions on their underside. The sealings are rectangular, except for a very few irregular pieces, e.g. HM 348, 358 (237, 248), and carry a smooth impression below cut across at right angles by the string mark. The character of the impression below is uniform (PLATE 19/ g): rectangular, often with rounded corners, slightly concave and smooth. The width is generally c. 9 mm and the length, where measurable, c. 1.5 cm, although 237 measures over 2. One may infer that these sealings were associated with small rectangular objects, which were in fact pieces of leather or parchment with written messages, folded for safety.282 The rounded corners on some and folds reflect the curvature of the folded material: leather strips. Holes may appear at the longer side of the sealing, less often immediately under the seal impression above. This with other signs (such as impressions on the surface and edges) enables a reconstruction of the manner of their use. A lump of soft clay was first pressed onto the object (already tied), either on top of the knot (e.g. HM 337: 227) or at some convenient spot. Then the string was passed one or more times over the lump of clay, thereby binding it firmly in position. Often layers of clay were added; an example is HM 405 (268), where string holes exist in the clay at various levels. The 'administrator' then steadied the sealing with one hand and pressed home the seal with the other into the somewhat rounded upper surface. His fingerprints are always visible at the edge of the sealing; at times he smudges and mars the seal design. In many cases the thickness and material of the binding string can be made out. Fine threads or fibres twisted together produced a heavier piece, e.g. HM 339 (229), 340 (230). On others a single thread has been wound round many times. A few have the threads running along the edge. 281 Weingarten 1989, app. 1, 48. 282 Pini 1983, 559-79; Weingarten 1983, 8-13; see also Hallager 1996, figs. 47-56.</page><page sequence="125">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES IOg A few sealings in HM with the regular string marks had more than one seal impression. HM 388 (256), of triangular section (pyramidal): a tripartite design with pallium-like central motif is placed on the very top, with a crab design at the pulled-up edge. This sealing type may have had a different role to play: did both seals belong to the same person, or were two parties involved? As Weingarten has pointed out, flat-based sealings are the characteristic Neopalatial type, being found at a number of LM IB sites: Zakro, Chania and Aghia Triadha.283 It may be significant that there are so many in the TR.

Pyramidal in shape and with traces of cord within them, they were suspended from the object by these cords, which are of a heavier calibre than the ones used for the flat-based sealings. Weingarten places them in her Class IX. 286 They are L37 'dove flying' and L2. 'uncertain plant with curving foliage' on one side of HM 355, 356 and 1248, and L31-33 'wild goat running. 3 varieties' on the other.287 The two-hole nodules are: HM 385 (253), 359 (249), 1240 (272), 397 (264), 1272 (277). Their underside is missing and so the impression of the string that ran along their horizontal axis is shown on the preserved part. It seems to have been made of leather, parchment or intestine.288 Evans289 sketched in his notes HM 1272 (277) where he wrote 'lion app. seizing prey'. Presumably this is L2329° with the same description. The problem is that, although the sketches match in shape, they do not in detail: in Evans's notes the head is in profile, while on the HM nodule it is more in three-quarters view. In addition the lion on the nodule appears to be crouching peacefully. There is no apparent aggression in its face.

Using hanging nodules is a clean method of safeguarding something as the clay does not touch the object sealed. The size and weight of the single-hole type suggest that the objects sealed were perhaps heavier than the leather strips sealed by the flat-based sealings. Small bags were probably tied by the cords which were subsequently sealed using a hanging nodule. According to Weingarten this clay object type is as characteristic of the Neopalatial period as the flat-based types.291 Hallager's study showed that 'the single hole nodule is unique to Linear A administration5 while the two-hole nodule covers the period MM II 'and would continue into Mycenaean administration'.292 Noduli Noduli carry seal impressions but lack signs of strings or of any attachment to objects. They comprise the majority of the pieces associated with the TR, but were not distinguished by Evans. Weingarten calculates that they make up 54% of the clay objects (sealings) from the TR.294 They come in three forms: i. triangular with a single seal impression (termed by Hallager2^ dome-shaped), ii. More tablet-like (Hallager's296 'disc' and Weingarten's2»? 'thick ovals') with an impression on each main face. iii. A squarish disc, much smaller and thinner than ii and again with an impression on each face. A disc implies a round object and our noduli type ii are not round, but rectangular with somewhat rounded corners; 'thick oval' or 'tablet' seems more accurate than 'disk'. Dome-shaped noduli. These are triangular or pyramidal in section, and are often irregular because of the manner in which they were pinched from a lump of clay using the thumb and two fingers of the left hand to hold the clay, while the seal was impressed by the right, as is evident by the finger impressions. The seal was held upright in all but a very few (HM 383/2: 25I5 383/4, 383/8, 383/9, AM 1 199: 279), where it was inverted. In HM 374 (250) and 390 (258), the clay was held between thumb and first finger, the seal applied horizontally. TABLE 4.

Most of these are slightly bowed because one of the impressions was made with greater force and has distorted the clay as a result. They all have a single combination of seal impressions: a horned sheep or goat on one side (PLATE 19 ¿), and a quatrefoil, cardium shell design (4 shells around a central dot) on the other2" (PLATE 19 a). The shell motif was impressed first, since it is the application of the seal with the sheep or goat that has caused the distortion. In a few instances there is a slight difference in the details of the sheep or goat motif, which is discussed below. Table 5.

Thus, HM 333 (1, 2, 3) (223) has a short horn and a tiny star or cross-like sign over the back of the animal (near the top of the margin of the sealing); HM 335 (2) (225) has a long horn continuing below the neck, while a rectangular structure (the so-called manger) is visible under the front leg. In the last case the animal is depicted in a more naturalistic way. In HM 334 (1) (224) the animal is exactly the same as in 335 (225), and there is also a swastika immediately above the back of the animal. It could be concluded that there are two types of sheep or goat in these sealings. One has a short horn and a small sign (cross or star) above the animal near the margin. The second animal is portrayed in a more natural way with a long horn. There is also a manger.300 Such variations on a theme recall observations made by Weingarten on the 'look-alike' phenomenon.301 In this case perhaps three people were involved, the sea-shell seal owner and the owner or owners of the two similar but not identical sheep or goat seals. Squarish noduli. This pair is put together because they are of the same shape. They are squarish with two flat surfaces. Weingarten sees them as of the oldest type of 'sealing'.302 In the grain stalk of 257 (HM 389) she sees the 'goddess' figure of 262 (HM 395), suggesting that they are both forms of 'a single glyptic unit'.303 Table 6. Squarish noduli Cat HM KnS/s Seal Impressions Clay 243 354 Lib-17, Lx Boat prow A red/brown Cross with dots B 257 389 Lx Grain stalk+rayed disk A orange Architectonic B In attempting to understand these different types of noduli, one must take three facts into account. They do not seem to have been attached to any object; two classes have multiple impressions (with a fixed order of precedence visible in the second type), and some may show variations on a theme. If we accept recent research into the use of sealings, this combination of features may mean that classes ii and iii, which involved two different seals, were a form of receipt for 'business' transactions. Further the visible subtle differences in the sheep or goat set may be evidence for the use of a symbol acting as the insignia for a 'department', each functionary in the department being supplied with his or her own variant for personal identification. Noduli have been discussed extensively by Weingarten304 and Hallager.305 They have been explained as 'dockets', i.e., receipts for work done, or 'tokens'. Hallager sees them more as receipts for goods delivered to the administration. This explanation fits well with the TR noduli, all of which seem to be of the same clay, and therefore produced in the same place, perhaps the shrine storerooms. 3°° These observations have been made by comparing the different fragments. No complete example of the second type of animal exists. 3O1 Weingarten (1989, 40-1) wrote: 'The Temple Repository also prefigures Zakro practice in its use of "look-alikes" - that is, different seals which look so much alike that they must have been made intentionally similar in order to assert similar authority'; and IQQ4, 183. 302 Weingarten iq8q, 40, 44, 46. 303 Weingarten 1990a, 102-4. 304 Weingarten 1988; 1989; 1990c. 3°5 Hallager 1996, 121-33.</page><page sequence="129">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES Hg The TR are 'unique in ... exploitation of noduli'.306 All types are present, which may be of some significance, although of more importance must be the fact that only three or four seals stamped the majority: the 'Goddess and Lion', the sheep/goat and the four seashells. Could these seals belong to the shrine administrators who issued them for goods delivered to the shrine? The Linear B tablets from the CPS area record deliveries; the situation may have been the same in the TR period. Roundels™1 Two types exist in the TR: i. with a projection pinched up at the edge and ii. without a projection. In his original publication Evans308 referred to 'roundels' retrieved from the ETR; further below, in the same publication, he dropped the word 'roundel' and referred to 'a clay label, and two clay discs with seal impressions around their edges' found in the 'lower stratum of the Eastern Repository'. 3°9 What he meant by the 'clay label' must be HM 342 (231). 3I° Firstly because of its shape, which answers in Evans's description of 'label' as 'perforated "labels" in the form of bivalve shells with a hole through the projection answering to the valve',311 except that it is not perforated. Secondly because similar (perforated) clay objects were found at Aghia Triadha and Evans drew attention to the similarity of the TR sealings to those from Aghia Triada.312 HM 342 has two identical seal impressions on either side of the projection. They are described in Evans's notes313 as 'flowers 2 + 2' with a sketch of the inscription just below and the comment 'on side flowers'. There is no doubt that this must be L.8, .9, 'Flowers of aster type two varieties'.314 The '2 + 2' and the 'two varieties' refer to the four seal impressions with flowers; all four impressions seem to have been stamped by the same seal; they are two on roundel HM 342 and two more on HM 413 (see below). The 'two clay discs' are later published, together with a third one, as 'inscribed clay documents'.315 The 'two discs' are HM 413 (269) and 345 (234), 3l6 both are fragmentary. The same two 'clay discs' with inscriptions are drawn once more by Evans,317 their periphery completed with short lines. Under one is noted 'wall twice - couchant ox - cross twice': this is HM 345 (234). The 'wall' design318 is drawn once more, with the observation '?trees + wall on edge of flat round seal with cross'. This description is appropriate to L8 ,2, 'semi-decorative ... to represent façades and doors of building. A characteristic Minoan class.

Evans also published the impression of L47 HM 343 (232) but without mentioning that it was a roundel.328 In his notes he did not attempt an illustration, except in so far as the shield was portrayed in a brief verbal description: 'Armed god [drawing of shield] shield 8'.329 Number '8' refers to the number of the seal impressions made around the edge of the roundel. In addition Hallager330 published one more roundel and attributed it to the TR corpus on the basis of its impressions; it is HM 346 (235). Its provenance is confirmed by the evidence of Evans's notes.331 Though no overall sketch was made for HM 346 (235), elements of its designs appear scattered elsewhere. The spiral appears among the five varieties of 'spiral and curvilinear' patterns, L1-6.332 The word 'twice' is used because the spiral design was imprinted twice on the edge. The 'canopy' design of L.6-17, 'apparently representing a canopy with four forked supports. Two varieties',333 appears in Evans's notes once upright and once inverted, where it is labelled 'boat or Pcanopy'.334 Evans did not notice the word 'or' he had written with the drawing and consequently took the two drawings as depicting two different seal impressions. Hallager has used the upside- down ('or canopy') version.335 A cross motif is also sketched, together with the inscribed sign associated with roundel HM 345 (234) with the note 'with couchant bull and wall on edge of flat seal with P3-5)'.336 The '?3-5' applies to the number of crosses Evans saw, the 3 was corrected to 5.

Two or more seals were used (apart from HM 343-4: 232-3), in five or more separate actions. Linear A inscriptions were incised onto the flat surface in three cases (HM 345: 234, 413: 269, and 344: 233). None is clearly readable, though the last case probably involves the CAPM ideogram.337 Whether the incidence of crosses on three separate cases has any significance is unclear. Table 8. Roundels Type ii: with projection Cat HM Wc/R Seal Impression No. Clay 231 342 Wc23 Flowers (Rf) 2 red The sole example here of a commoner group (cf. Aghia Triadha, Mallia), which often has a means of suspension, although this one does not. The carefully rounded disc (HM 342: 23 1)338 had seal impressions each side of the projection as well as a deeply cut design on one main face. The other has three tiny pinholes regularly spaced as if it might have been pressed onto something. Evans had seen the roundels as 'obligations of some sort undertaken by the person or persons whose signet impressions they bore'.339 Hallager sees them as 'receipts kept by the administration for products that have left the storerooms'.340 This explanation would fit HM 343 and 344 as they are each sealed by an identical seal: the first, eight times by the 'god carrying a shield and accompanied by a lioness' and the second nine times by a 'goat' seal. In the first case the owner of the seal signed for eight Pproducts that he received from the shrine storeroom, while the 'goat' seal owner signed for nine Pproducts. With roundels such as HM 345 or 346, which are stamped by three or four different seals, it is difficult to see the different owners being on the spot simultaneously to sign while the clay was still soft. Unless some people owned and were able to use more than one seal, perhaps a different one for each product that was delivered. I think that we are not yet in a position to fully understand the function of the roundel or the nodulus. Conclusions I shall now consider the chronology of these sealings, the seals used in their production and any evidence we may have to their function. The most 'archaic'341 are sealings attached directly to objects (TABLE 1), and the discs342 (TABLE 6). Both types are common in MM II. Next come two types of sealings, the flat-based and the hanging nodules (TABLES 2 and 3): the flat-based is Neopalatial, the hanging nodule starts in MM II and continues to LM IB.343 They are both known in other contemporary deposits, the former at Zakro, the latter at Aghia Triadha.344 A further well-known Neopalatial sealing type is represented in the TR (258, 236): the dome nodulus. Of the seals that made this corpus, flat-faced ones (common in MM II) are present, but most were convex, round and oval (from discoids or lentoids). Very few were rectangular (223) 337 Hallager 1087, 63; Godart and Olivier 1070, 8&lt;s. 338 Panagiotaki 1993, 81-3, fig. nc.e. 339 Evans 1021, 621. 340 Hallager 1996, 132. 341 Weingarten 1989, 40, 44. 342 Weingarten 1989, pls.

Some roundels were impressed by flat-faced seals that are of the prismatic type and thus of stone, (235. c, 269). According to Weingarten,346 the earliest seals represented are the Revolving Sheepheads (238, on a disc, a type equally ancient), the Interlacing Rope-pattern (247), and the Whirly motifs (258). As old are those taken from 4-sided Prisms (343, 257): the prow on 343 is termed primitive, and may be the Hieroglyphic sign H116.347 The cstar-and- dots' on the same nodulus she suggests is a 'cross with extra flourishes', derived from the sign 'croix pommetée'.348 The combination of seal design and sealing type both point to an early date: probably Old Palace. Other designs that may belong to the Old Palace are, the grain stalk and the rayed disc that are associated with another disc nodulus (257). 349 The architectonic designs have been assigned by Younger350 to the middle to end of the Old Palaces (MM IIa-b). 257 may belong to his earlier category, while 271, 266 and 268 are better placed in a later or 'classical' one. The agrimia group (244) he placed at or after the end of the Old Palaces and early in the Neopalatial period (MM IIIA-B).351 The standing sheep or goat, with variants of swastika and manger (333, 334* 335)? will fit somewhere here: they are not as stiffly portrayed as the animals of the Hieroglyphic deposit, but nor are they as naturalistic as the agrimia (244, 234). In LM Ia, he locates the 'Skylla' seal set (227, 228, 229, 239, 240), as well as the 'boxer' (226) and the 'Goddess or God and Lion' group (262, 251). 352 This last is an important chronological point. Pini is of the same opinion.353 One cannot fail to see the naturalism in the representation of the human figure, particularly the 'boxer' and the 'Skylla' male figure.354 They are figures full of vigour and vitality; this betrays a powerful hand which is not seen in earlier works of art, seals or figures in the round. To conclude, true sealings that marked objects directly, noduli type iii (discs) and the single- hole hanging nodules are earliest, then come the flat-based, and finally the noduli types i and ii and the roundels (the last being characteristic of the Chania corpus).355 As for the seal patterns, the Hieroglyphic come first, followed by the Architectonic; then Naturalism appears, in the flowers (253), pallium and crab (256; PLATE 18 &lt;?,/), trees in the wind356 (252; PLATE 18 c) and the human figures. Weingarten terms these low and high-level naturalism, the last accounting for 25% or 27% of the total.357 The subjects of the seals are concerned with nature, in its non-violent aspects. 228 and 229, with perhaps a sea-monster attacking a man on a boat,358 are the sole exception.359 No 345 pini 1 990, 52. 346 Weingarten 1989, 44; 1990a, 97. 347 Weingarten (1989, 44 n. 22) wrote: 'Inverted the "boat prow" becomes the wine ideogram of Linear A and B'. 348 Weingarten 1989, 44. 349 Weingarten iqqoa, 06-7. 35° Younger 1989, 56. 351 Younger 1989, 57. 352 The 'Skylla' was taken by Younger (1989, 59) to represent 'the regardant animal-head stern-aegis of another ship below'. Both Younger and Betts took the 'goddess' to represent a male; she was included in the 'Group of the Robed Priest' by Betts (1981, 2-8); see also Walberg 1986, 1 1 2-14 and Tamvaki 1989, 259-73. 353 Pini 1990, 52-3; see also Weingarten 1990a, 99. 354 Weingarten (1990a, 99) correctly suggested that both the 'god' and 'goddess' could be by the same artist though the 'goddess' was impressed by a metal ring and the 'god' by a flattened cylinder. 355 Weingarten io88, 3. 356 Betts (iq68, 140-^0) saw them as boats. 357 Weingarten iq8q, 44, 47; iQQoa, 96. 358 One should be reminded that Younger (1989, 59) saw the 'monster' as the prow of a ship and Weingarten agreed (1990a, 101 n. 24). On boats and the marine element in the Minoan and Mycenaean world see Marinatos 1933, 170-235. 359 The postulated 'Lion seizing prey' of Evans (1902-3, 55), would be another violent action. However, if this is in fact equivalent to 277 (HM 1272), then it is not clear that Evans's reading is correct. The lion looks more couchant and at rest.</page><page sequence="133">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES uy exact parallels in iconography are visible between these and the faience objects, but this is not surprising given the difference in size. Nonetheless, floral types (lilies), marine creatures (seashells) and animals (agrimi, bulls) are common to both. This probably just reflects a common artistic language and framework of reference. The representations of human or divine figures holding a spear or staff and accompanied by 'lions' (262, 251, 232) clearly reflect some generic iconography, either as hunters or protectors of animals, the latter being the more likely since they are portrayed in a non-violent posture. The presence of a male counterpart to the female, if it is a female, has perhaps some relevance to considerations of the make-up of the Minoan body of deities. Within the context of the TR, one question remains unanswered from this material. Were all these sealings stamped at much the same time, or are they the accumulation of several generations that somehow were all placed in the TR? In terms of function, the three classes of object probably represent different kinds of activities. This is obvious when we contrast the flat-based sealings with the noduli and roundels. String marks on the first show how the sealing was a warranty and a label: they have been used for small strips of leather used for written messages; one of the direct sealings was probably attached to a wooden peg, perhaps of a sealed box (in the TR) or it could have sealed a door in the shrine. Neither of the other two classes is thought to have been directly or indirectly attached: they share, with the exception of noduli i), the characteristic of multiple impressions and, often, multiple sealstones as well. Even so the varieties within these sets make a single explanation unlikely, as Weingarten has pointed out.36° The simplest noduli may be a form of receipt or identity of the holder as Weingarten has said;361 the second class are more likely to record a transaction in which one department or individual regularly countersigned a token from another, or else a single person owned and used more than one seal. These suggestions could also apply to the roundels, involving perhaps more than one person,362 or again a single person with more than one seal. If some are stamped by a multi-face seal belonging to one person, this may be evidence for different kinds of authority this person may have had. The fact that a series of sealings are stamped by the same seal (e.g. 'Goddess and Lion', 'Skylla' and sheep or goat and seashells) might point to a central administration of palace or shrine, in this case probably Knossos itself. The similarity of clay type (tempered with small grits) reinforces the argument that they were produced at Knossos and not sent from different places. This may suggest that many of these sealings were related to the internal palace or shrine administration.363 Their light baking may point to an accidental preservation, although, if they do come from a span of time, then perhaps some were deliberately fired. Considering their context, they could also be seen as related to the workings of the shrine's business as a religious institution. The noduli and the roundels may represent receipts for goods that were delivered to the shrine storerooms or left the shrine storerooms.364 Gifts made to the shrine could have been sealed and stamped to aid identification of the sender and or for security in transport or storage. The flat-based set might have carried requests for blessings. The multiple sealings may indicate multiple donors or repeated acts of piety.

But this is all speculative, and one should remember that the same practices are seen elsewhere in Minoan Crete in circumstances that do not demand a religious interpretation.365 Inscribed clay tablet Evans mentioned the recovery of one tablet (282) in his first publication.366 He recognized the writing as 'Linear' and distinct from that '. . . in use towards the conclusion of the first Period of the Later Palace at Knossos'.367 The new form he labelled 'Class A as opposed to Class B of the latest Palace Period'.368 Class A tablets were found on other sites of the island at about this time, e.g. Palaikastro and Gournia. But Evans valued highly the closed context of this Knossian specimen. In his later publication he called it 'a typical example of the earlier and simpler form of those presenting the Linear Script A'.309 He seemed to call it 'earlier' because he saw it as 'closely corresponding in type' with a tablet found together with the Phaestos disk and MM III pottery.370 Is it truly earlier? And if so, why was it kept ... or has it emerged from some architectural fill at the time of the destruction? The readable part of it is concerned with numbers: the circles with 'hundreds', the short lines with 'units'. ANTLER, IVORY, BONE, CEREALS AND WOOD Antler Evans presented three deer antlers at the top of PLATE 17 (283.a, b, c):371 they were cut out in later representations. They were identified as from roe-deer, correctly (PLATE 20 a);372 less happy is the association of the 'fatness' of the soil of the TR with some sacrificial ceremony involving deer.373 This may not be true, partly since no other skeletal remains of the animals were recovered, (the skull, for instance) but especially since at least one of the antlers had been collected as a shed specimen, as the 'flowery growth' at the base indicates. This same piece has a scar, perhaps where a tine has become detached. Another lacks the 'growth' but widens at the base the way multibranched antlers do. The shed example may argue that the antlers were brought to the shrine either as an aspect of the natural world, or as talismans to ensure success in the hunt. The 'fatness' of the soil is more likely to be due to oil dregs from the vases in the same Repository. Weasel Bones Evans recorded in his notes374 'bones of ... weasel' (284), which may refer to a head that appears in PLATE 17 combined with fish vertebrae (see below). The bones have not been 365 Weingarten 1983, 8-13; Pini 1983, 560-2; Hogarth 1902, 76-Q3- 366 Evans 1902-3, 51, fig. 27. 367 Evans 1002-3, ^2. 368 Evans 1Q02-3, 52. 369 Evans 192 1, 617; Godart &amp; Olivier 1970, 256; 1976, 25-57; 1994, 161-2, fig. 1. 37° Evans 1921, 618; on the time span of the use of Linear A at Knossos see Olivier, 1994, 165. 371 Evans 1902-3, fig. 63. 372 They have been identified as such by Prof. G.

If it was part of the deposit (and not a later addition) it may have been dedicated to the shrine. Analogies exist, particularly in peak sanctuaries.376 Fish Vertebrae In PLATE 17, at the centre, in front of the cross and between the two faience figurines, lies what looks like a coiled snake (285). 377 Evans, influenced no doubt by the snakes on the figurines, thought of a snake-cult, and placed the 'snake' in a prominent position in this first group photograph of the cult objects from the TR. The figure, however, was never published: in the original report, a version of this plate appeared, but without the 'snake'.378 The spot is blurred, and shows how the object was deliberately blocked out in the print. In PM a small offering table has been positioned on the blurred spot.379 Closer inspection shows that this 'snake' consists of a head, from the weasel postulated above but unlocated, and a body composed from a series offish vertebrae some of which have been found in HM.38° The species of the smaller ones is difficult to identify, but a larger vertebra is that of a shark. They may have been brought to the shrine as offerings to ensure a good catch, or as a thank-offering for having done so. Bone The bone items from the TR381 comprise pomegranate flowers (286. a-d), parts of arrows (287-8) and plaques (288.a, b). The first are made up of two flowers (286.a, b) and two buds (286. c, d; FIG. 28; PLATES 20 b, 19): again the combination of young and mature stages appears, as with some of the faience pieces. All four items have incised on their underside what resembles a capital I with a pair of dots in the case of one of the flowers and the buds. Similar marks are known on ivory and bone objects from the Palace, the East Wing in particular.382 They helped the artist to position each inlay correctly within a larger composition, or, less likely, they were the signature of a particular craftsman or school. The pomegranate flowers and buds are surely inlays, as they are flat on the reverse, perhaps they were associated with trees and flowers. They were a significant plant to the Minoans, as to many peoples.383 The second set represents 'the notched end of the plume of an arrow'384 (287-8; FIG. 28; PLATES 20/ 19). The upper surface is well carved and some of the incised lines are filled with red paint as highlight. The decoration consists of 'crested waves' or 'flames' on either side of the raised middle shaft; this carries horizontal incisions also filled with red paint. The underside is flat, with a pegging hole near the narrower end. Evans thought that they 'had been probably applied to a metal shaft, fixed on to or forming one piece with the metal plate 375 Dr L. Paragamian identified the head in PLATE 17 as one of the weasel family. 376 Dietrich 1974, 292. 377 See Panasriotaki iqqq, fiçs. B, C. 378 Evans 1902-3, fig. 63. 379 Evans 192 1, fig. 377.

Dictynna or Britomartis . . .'.386 Evans387 saw the flame-like designs of the arrow plumes as similar to the way the wings of griffins are portrayed; he also drew attention to the similarity of the decoration to that on a hearth from Mycenae,388 and on skirts of figurines from Knossos.309 He, thus, saw this motif as not simply decorative but 'of a religious character'.390 When it appears on tables of offerings it may have some religious connotations but does it mean the same when it becomes a common motif on LM IB pottery?391 Evans drew two plaques in his notes, neither of which has been located.392 One is a small strip with the note 'bone' appended, while the other is larger and has a capital T, probably incised on its back. Ivory The corpus of ivory objects is restricted, and includes some rather unusual pieces. 289 Evans393 described as 'the delicately carved handle plate of some instrument, showing rivet-holes for fixing the blade, which ran at right angles to the end of the handle' (FIG. 28; PLATES 20 c, 19). Later he recorded 'The elegant ivory plate of a knife handle here brought to light may well have belonged to a sacrificial instrument'.394 However, this object would be difficult to hold for such a purpose, and there is no parallel for such a form in the Minoan or Mycenaean world. It has more resemblance to the side plates of a lyre, in miniature form,395 or the prow of a ship.396 The underside is flat, with the usual scratches that inlays have to hold the glue. There has been some polishing, in a pattern that may imply that another plaque of similar size and shape was fastened to it, and/or that it was attached to a backing. Further, the holes for rivets, according to Evans, are too big to receive rivets of bronze, except for one smaller hole, and were perhaps meant to take a decorative peg of ivory covered in gold. A small crescent-shaped object is also an inlay (290; FIG. 28, PLATES 20 e, 19).397 The shape is well represented, especially in faience, elsewhere in the Palace.398 Under 291 are recorded several objects in HM, all arguably inlays (PLATE 20 d). Two of these appear in an unpublished photograph where a collection of pieces from the TR are shown (PLATE 19); these are a 'grain'-shaped plaque (291.4) and a strip or plaque with pegging-holes (291*1). It is argued here that the other three (291.2, 3, 5), all plaques, should be included too, since they are recorded under the same catalogue number in HM. The 'grain' (291.4) has a well polished upper surface and a much less polished lower one, where there is a pair of deep holes; perhaps both served as a guide-mark and gave a better 385 Evans 1002-3, 61. 386 Evans 1021, S4-8. 387 Evans 102 1, fia SQQb, 400. 388 Mylonas 1983, fig. 79. 389 Evans 1921, 549-50. 390 Evans 192 1, 549. 39' Warren and Hankey 1989, 141. 392 Panariotaki iqqq, 73, fit 10a. 393 Evans 1902-3, 60; see also Panagiotaki 1993, 73, fig. 10b 'once double with metal blade between'. 394 Evans 1921, 496. 395 A life-size ivory lyre was found in the Menidi tholos tomb, see Poursat 1977a, 145, pl. xlv (425/1974; 426/1975); see also Aign 1963, 82-3 (I thank Mrs H.

On the strip (291. i) is a line of six small drilled (well-polished) holes, which have broken through to the underside. They may have held metal wires or nails, no doubt with decorative intent, as on a slightly larger equivalent from the Palace, whose gilded pegs are still in position.399 The remaining pieces are a circular plaque (291.3: half lost), a square one (291.2: with peg hole) and a strip with a mitred end (291.5). Two mortises partly survive on the reverse of the strip and one on the circular plaque. So far as can be told all these pieces are of elephant ivory. Their role in the shrine is hard to comprehend, other than a purely decorative one with some reference in 290 to the natural world. Carbonized Corn Evans mentioned 'burnt corn found in some abundance', suggesting that it 'may also have had an offertory character'.400 A tiny pill-box in the Ashmolean contained burnt corn (292) in such a condition as to be hardly identifiable. On the box was written 'porcelain deposit',401 for which reason it is likely that it belongs to the TR. This cereal may well have been offered at the shrine. It would have been preserved simply because it was caught in the fire that swept the area. Carbonized Wood Burnt, or at least charred, cypress wood (293) has been recorded in the HM catalogue as coming from the TR. As no description beyond that exists, it is difficult to locate it among the remnants of wood known from several parts of the Palace. It is probably safer to assume that this wood was from some architectural element or piece of furniture. Evans also refered to 'carbonized remains of what seems to have been a large and very costly chest together with smaller caskets' (294).402 In this identification he was presumably influenced by the bronze handles of differing sizes (see below). None of these carbonized remains have been located. Another object in the Ashmolean (295) may be from the TR. It is labelled 'faience' but the material has been identified as of wood,403 burnt to a light blue colour. It is a segmented strip: a form reminiscent of the faience rods (207-9) and others of rock crystal. STONE AND ROCK CRYSTAL Stone These comprise a marble cross (296), two 'ritual hammers' (297-8), four libation tables (299-302) and six rather irregularly shaped stone objects (303-5). The cross (296) is made of a well polished grey marble, much veined in white and grey (PLATES 17, 21 0).404 The limbs are of equal length, with an incision (parallel to the ends) at the end of each on the reverse. It may be speculated that these incisions were to aid its adhesion to some form of backing by retaining the glue. The cross probably originates in the East as an astral symbol.405 Evans saw the cross as 'a symbol of the Great Minoan Goddess under her chthonic aspect'.406 If this was the case, a speculative suggestion, it would constitute almost the only reference to the deities involved in this shrine as having had any power in that sphere. 399 Unpublished objects from the Palace at Knossos. 400 Evans 1902-3, 41; 192 1, 497. 401 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 87-8, 28-9 May) spoke of 'porcelain' objects and of 'porcelain stratum', while Evans (see Panagiotaki 1993, 50, fig. ia) talked of 'Porcelain Deposit'. Thus there is no question about the provenance of this material. 402 Evans iQO2-q, 4a. 4°3 Identification by A. MacGregor and F.

The prominent position bestowed upon this item by Evans in his reconstruction of the shrine contents presumably reflects his Christian background rather than anything else.408 Of the 'ritual hammers' found, one (297) has not been located, but Evans409 drew it in his notes ('hammer of limestone 9 cm X ...') and also presented it in plate 22 with an annotation appended: 'Limestone hammer fractured'.410 The other (298) is of conglomerate/breccia, and carries strong traces of use (FIG. 29; PLATE 21 ¿).4" Evans viewed their presence as pointing to attempts by the plunderers of the TR area to break into the 'vault' (the TR themselves).412 Their shape, however, declares that they belong to the well-known group of ceremonial hammers or maces.413 Similar hammers were found in the shrine stores of the West wing at Zakro.414 The four small, well-fashioned libation tables are of marble (302), breccia (300-1) and serpentine (299; PLATE 21 c, d, e)A15 Their sides taper downwards to a small flat base, while in plan they are square with a shallow central bowl and raised collar.416 300 has a further rim defining its square receptacle. They are by definition believed to have received and presented the 'fruits of the earth' and consequently to point to cult practices. Whether the offerings were in liquid or solid form cannot be told now; they could equally be used for both.417 They contain no evidence of having been exposed to heat or burning and thus need not be seen as incense burners. In addition, there are a series of enigmatic pieces (303-5) Evans418 presented, two of which have been found (303-4). He interpreted them as 'cylindrical cakes', suggesting that they were probably used as the raw material for the production of faience. The pieces located, however, are of limestone.419 They, like others in the photograph,420 appear but half-made, with an irregular profile. Some of them look more as if they are half-finished bowls or tables. 303 has strong traces of a working tool (FIG. 29; PLATE 21/). They generally carry traces of damage by fire. Comparable objects exist in the unprovenanced material in the KSM, made of a similar limestone, but they do not match the ones illustrated by Evans.421 Rock Crystal A quite large convex disc (306) was found together with 21 petal-shaped objects (307) and an unspecified number of plaques, some 'ribbed' (308) (FIG. 29; PLATE 22 centre).422 Evans423 in 407 Evans iQ2i, &lt;u6. 408 Evans 1902-3, fie. 63; IQ21, fig. 377. 409 Panagiotaki 1993, 71, fig. 9. 410 Evans 1902-3, fig. 24. 411 Evans 1902-3, 47; 1921, 468, fig. 336; I thank Dr. D. Evely for this identification. 412 This idea may have originated with Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 90, 30 May) who wrote: 'the fact that part of one of the figures belonging to the other cist was found in this one shows that there was a good deal of throwing about of the objects possibly by plunderers'. 413 Platon 1981, 74-83; Marinatos (1986, 7) sees them as an instrument for stunning an animal before it is sacrificed. I should point out that the heavy damage to the hammer or mace in the Ashmolean would suggest a different, Drobablv heavier use. 414 Platon iq6q, q: and Platon io8i, 74.-83. 415 Warren (1969, 63) dates only the first two.

A 'piece of fluted crystal' is also recorded, with a drawing. The 'petals' are slightly grooved on one side, probably to make them look more naturalistic. Evans reported that 'they were partly enveloped with gold-leaf and that 'the underside of one or two of them was coated with closely-adhering silver foil'.424 He explained that this helps to preserve the silver from 'oxidation to which immediate contact with wood or ivory might have rendered it liable'.425 From the description it seems that the objects were covered with silver on one surface, with gold leaf on top to hold the silver by curving round the edges and partly cover the unsilvered surface. One could thus see gold on one side of the objects and silver, under the crystal, trimmed with gold on the other. As to the purpose of these pieces, Evans saw the petals as 'marguerite flowers, like those seen on the border of the Gaming Board'.426 The disc itself could have been part of the same arrangement, although its considerable size and the fact that its reverse is covered with silver foil may suggest other uses. It is of the size to have been a mirror with silver foil backing427 or the silver foil had some kind of pattern worked upon it, which would have been enhanced by the slight magnifying effect of the convex disc. The disc and petals might form a single unit of disc and rays of the sun. Such representations are common in Minoan Crete and in the East.428 The attached foils would give the disc two appearances: silver under the crystal (trimmed with gold) and plain gold, both highly reflective. If carried as an emblem with both sides visible, the effect when exposed to the reflected light of the sun would have been dazzling. Goodison has traced a female sun deity in the Bronze Age, represented on seals and in other media.429 Could the kourotrophos element proposed above be connected with the sun? The evidence is only in the crystal disc, the marble cross, the star representations on one of the faience girdles, and the sun disc on a sealing.430 However, the position of the Shrine facing E and being at the centre of the Central Court suggests that its position was chosen in order to receive the rising sun and the moon. Ceremonies with both the rising of the sun and the moon may have taken place in the Shrine or in the Central Court in front of it. The sun emblem may have been used in such ceremonies to inspire awe with its dazzling effect. Such emblems, which strongly recall our sun emblem, also in gold and silver (but not rock crystal) are carried in ceremonies in Cretan churches today.431 METAL Besides the unlocated silver foil (310), there are gold and copper/bronze pieces from the TR. Gold Mackenzie wrote that in no other single spot in the palace was so much gold recovered.432 Evans repeated this point in both the first433 and later publications,434 and showed gold leaf 424 Evans 1902-3, 47. 425 Evans 1902-3, 47. 426 Evans 1902-3, 47; 1921, Colour Plate v opp. p. 472. 427 Evans IQ02-3, 47- 428 Goodison 1989, 12-13, figs. i2n, 14. 429 Goodison 1989, 169. 430 Weingarten iq8q, 46, fiç.

As is evident from both Mackenzie's notes and Evans's (see Panagiotaki 1993, 50), gold foil was found in both TR, but probably most of it came from the WTR. 433 Evans 1902-3, 45. 434 Evans 1921, 469.</page><page sequence="142">I26 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS FlG. 30.

The whole amount (309) is barely a few grams, and in fragmentary condition: creased, difficult to handle and prone to disintegration. All is very thin leaf, with just two pieces slightly thicker (PLATE 22 top right, 23 c). One of them (309.1) shows parallel symmetrical grooves creating a semi-circle (FIG. 30; PLATES 22, 23 c top left). Four other pieces (309.2-5) are like strips, with parallel horizontal impressions as if they had been applied to a segmented object (FIG. 30; PLATES 22 top left, 23 a). Such objects in rock crystal have been recorded by Evans436 and are known from the Throne Room,437 but their segments are shallower than those of the objects this particular gold leaf covered. Evans believed that the gold leaf was connected with 'carbonized remains of ... a chest together with smaller caskets. From the fluting and traces of ornamental designs visible on some of this gold foil, it was evident that it had been used as a coating of decorative reliefs'.438 The rest of the foil (309.8-33) is in the form of large flower petals (in the shape of the petals of a daisy), some retaining both their main surface, and the turned down edges that would have gripped the sides of whatever objects they had covered (probably of faience, wood or stone); they are of two different sizes and some come in double form (FIG. 30; PLATES 22, 23 ¿, c).439 They may have been combined to form a daisy-like flower; they could even have been combined with the crystal disc 306 and crystal petals. Finally, Evans440 presented a clay lump with gold leaf adhering to it (309.34; PLATE 22 top left). In HM a small bag was revealed containing both soil and tiny fragments of gold leaf (309.35), some still adhering one to the other. Perhaps these are the remains of what Evans showed in the photograph, although the gold there looks thicker. He described it as having an 'elaborate' design,441 even though barely visible. Four more fragments of gold leaf were recognised in the uncatalogued material in the Ashmolean (309.a). One, near complete, is flower petal-shaped and the others may have been of the same shape. All these fragments were embellishments of other items: inlays or separate pieces. Foliate designs or daisy flowers are suggested by most pieces which probably decorated chests or boxes perhaps in combination with the faiance flowers and fruit.442 Nothing of solid gold is known, although a button-like object, photographed by Evans,443 has not been located. Copper/Bronze Three fragments were found; two handles and a bar that Evans444 called 'clamp' (310.a. 1-3; PLATE 22). The large handle (310. a.3) was for a box probably of wood, and the small one (310.a. 2) for a smaller container. The bar (310.a. 1) was perhaps a strap or part of the handle of a vessel. The difference in size of the handles may well have put into Evans's mind the idea of wooden receptacles of differing sizes.445 The inlay he postulated with some of the available faience, crystal and ivory or bone, with gold leaf embellishments, is not impossible. 435 Evans 1902-3, fig. 24; 1921, fig. 337. 436 Panagiotaki 1993, 71, fig. 9. 437 Evans io,^, fie;.

In his illustrations449 about ioo shells are visible, while 183 are on display in HM45° together with the faience figures. Neither the shells illustrated, however, nor those on display can account for the 'bushels' alluded to by Evans. Amongst the material classified as uncatalogued from HM were two boxes of shells (311), from Evans's excavations at Knossos.451 I propose to treat these shells as the missing material for the following reasons. Firstly about 340 are painted in the same way as those known to be from the TR. Secondly with them was a small number of faience beads of the same shape, texture and colour as those from the Repositories. Thirdly not all the species recorded by Evans (see below) appear in his published photographs, but they are all among these uncatalogued shells. The names of the shells Evans gave were provided by W. F. R. Weldon 'from some specimens submitted to him' although not all specimens could be identified, because of the 'worn state of the valves'.452 They were cDolium galea, Trochus lineatus, Cardium edule, Pectunculus glycimeris, Spondylus gaederopus, Venus verrucosa, Venus multilamellata, Mactra stultorum, Tellina (worn), tube ofSerpulid worm and piece of an Echinid' Further specialist study (to be published separately)453 has revealed more types. The following is a list of the marine organisms found: Dosinia lupinus, Mactra stultorum, Glycymeris glycymeris, Glycymeris insubricus, Acanthocardia tuberculata, Venericardia antiquata, Cerastoderma glaucum, Loupes lacteus, Chamelea gallina gallina, Chamelea gallina striatula, Venus verrucosa, Callista chione, Donax trunculus, Spondylus gaederopus, Monodonta articulata, Monodonta turbinata, Lima lima, Arca noae, Ostrea sp., Vermetus sp., Venerupis decussatus, Naticarius millepunctatus, Barbatia barbata, Veneridae, Tonna galea, Phalium granulatum, Cassidae, Murex trunculus, Abra alba, Cypraeidae, Anomiidae, Chlamys varia, Nassarius gibbosulus, Conus méditer raneus, Collumbella rustica, Patella caerulea, Vermetus arenarius, Vermetus triquetrus, Chama gryphoides, Paracentrotus sp. About 500 of them are painted, as pointed out by Evans,454 'streaked and banded with brilliant artificial tints - crimson, Venetian red, orange, brown, green, and black - tastefully applied in unison with the natural lines and hues.' The paint is applied only on the dorsal surface,455 in red, green and black only, which agrees with Mackenzie's notes.456 At first glance the paint appeared to be different shades but closer 446 Mackenzie DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 87, 28 May wrote: 'In the deposit fragments of porcelain began to come out along with various kinds of seashells predominant among which was the variety called in modern Greek "petalida". "Petalida" is what Evans called "cockle"' (1902-3, 43). 447 Panadotaki iqoq, ^o. 448 Evans 1902-3, 43; 1921, 517-18. 449 Evans 1902-3, 42, fig. 21, 63; 1921, fig. 377, 378. 450 Cat.

Moreover, case (64) referred to as their previous storage place contained mainly objects from the Temple Repositories (the case does not exist now). It should also be noticed that no seashells are recorded in the excavation Day Books and Notebooks as recovered in 1904. 452 Evans 1902-3, 43. «3 Undertaken bv Prof. A. Eleftheriou. 454 Evans 1921, 519. «5 Samples of the paint are being studied at Demokritos, Athens. «6 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, vol. ii, 87, 28 May) wrote: '. . . some of the shells were painted in different colours, red, green, black.'</page><page sequence="145">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES I2g study revealed that the shade depends on its preservation, being darker where it is better preserved. The artificial orange colour mentioned by Evans may have been a mistake for the natural horizontal orange striations of a few Acanthocardium shells which are in a very good state of preservation and thus vividly coloured. Similarly the brown could be the natural banding of Glycymeris or the natural spots on a few Naticarius shells. The painted shells present a variety in composition. A few (Mactra stultorum) have just three black, slightly curved lines, from umbo to the periphery of the shell, on only half of their dorsal surface. A few others are completely black. Usually the paint follows the striations of the shell, obviously an easier way to apply it. On the Chamelea gallina striatula, for instance, horizontal bands (of almost the same width) appear from umbo to the widest part of the shell in red or in green (5-6 bands), following the natural horizontal lines of the shell. The same arrangement is seen on Docinia exoletus. Acanthocardium tuberculatum, on the other hand, carries vertical lines and bands once again following the natural vertical lines of the shell. This type of shell presents a variety of designs which have been skilfully executed: either the shell is entirely painted in green, or only the depressions are painted alternately, again in green, or a combination of both styles appears on the same shell; alternatively red paint is applied in the depressions alternately, or a tripartite arrangement is created by a rather wide central band (following the natural vertical depressions of the shell) flanked by two slighter bands. The uniformity of style and paint of the shells points to the work of a single person; it is, therefore, highly possible that they were all painted by one person. The inside of the valves is never painted, with one exception: one valve has traces of red paint in the bottom part of its ventral surface, as if it was used as a small vessel to carry the paint: a kind of palette. The preservation of the shells also varies. The majority are well preserved, but there are in addition a few kg of shell fragments. Many look worn, but they exhibit no traces of an obvious use (e.g. for rubbing or scraping); it is more likely that they were collected worn on the seashore. A large number are calcified, or burnt to varying degrees; in some cases the shells are badly burnt, thus excluding the possibility that they were roasted in order to be consumed. The burning is more likely to have been caused by fire in the place where the shells were stored. It is likely that they were caught in the fire which destroyed the shrine to which the TR objects belonged. Quite a number of shells are pierced, some in the umbo, others on different parts of the body. The perforations were created by the predatory gastropod Naticarius, a few shells of which were found among the rest of the shells.457 Their commonest victim was Mactra stultorum, which shares the same habitat with Naticarius and also has a very fragile shell. Some of the holes on the umbo (particularly on the Mactra shells) were created by abrasion, most probably the result of the shells being washed against the rocks by the ceaseless movement of the sea. A small number, however, have been deliberately pierced by man; the holes are rectangular or squarish, and are often on the umbo. These shells may have been used as ornament. How did the shells reach the palace? Most are edible (except Naticarius and Serpulid) and were probably eaten by the Minoans. Some therefore may have been collected alive to eat, while others seem to have stayed dead in the sea long enough to allow worms to encrust, with their tubes, the inside of their valves. 457 1 thank Prof. A. Eleftheriou for explaining this to me.</page><page sequence="146">I3o THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS The next question to be proposed concerns the identity of those who brought them to the palace. Were they offerings to the shrine by fishermen for a good catch? Had the fishermen painted them themselves, or were they painted at the shrine for decorative purposes? What was the meaning of the shells in the shrine? To answer this question one has to consider similar finds in the Aegean world. Seashells are found on sites from Neolithic onwards458 in Crete, on other Aegean islands459 and on the mainland.400 Whether they are natural or man-made in various materials such as faience or clay, they were used as ornaments or as burial offerings.401 They seem, however, to have been found in contexts, or directly connected with objects, that carry religious overtones, at sites such as MM IIb Phaistos,402 MM Ib-LM I/II Youktas,463 LM I Pyrgos,404 LH III Phylakopi,465 and many sites of all periods in Cyprus and the Near East, as shown by Reese.466 The shells like the argonaut shells can be taken as female creatures symbolizing fertility, as pointed out by Goodison.407 Evans468 suggested that the seashells from the TR had decorated the floor or the altar of the shrine, in much the same way as the Double Axe shrine altar409 was decorated with water- worn pebbles. Since the majority of the shells, however, could not withstand the weight of footsteps (Glycimeris and Chamelea gallina striatula perhaps excepted), they would be quite unsuitable as a floor cover. Besides, to decorate the floor they would have to be embedded in plaster or cement and there is no trace of such materials on the shells. They could on the other hand have decorated the altar of the Shrine or they could have been incorporated into panels, probably attached to them by means of glue, which has not survived. The perforated ones may have been used in garlands, perhaps in combination with the faience beads. A similar association is seen in a much later site, Hasanlu, which has produced comparable numbers of sea shells stored in the shrine area together with amber, glass and paste beads.470 In conclusion, the importance of these seashells is twofold: archaeological, and biological and ecological. Their archaeological importance lies in the fact that they were not retrieved from all over the site as food debris. On the contrary they were recovered from a closed deposit, where they were deliberately deposited. They accompanied the faience figures and objects of art, arranged at the bottom of the ETR.471 They should thus be seen as directly connected with the shrine of the Palace to which these objects belonged. The seashells, together with the faience marine objects, should represent the sea. The number of the marine objects, exceeding by far all the other objects put together, may be indicative of the importance of the sea to the Minoans at the TR period. It has already been suggested that seashells and beads were dedicated to female rather than male deities in the East;472 the TR may be another instance.

They were identified through the above figures. Some are included because they are recorded in museum catalogues as a group together with known vases from the TR or are mentioned in connection with other deposits. Evans never distinguished which vases came from which TR and it is impossible to distinguish them now. What is known survives in HM, the AM478 and the BM. They can be divided into three main categories: jugs, oval-mouthed amphorae and jars. They are all large vases in closed shapes. Their fabric is coarse or semi-coarse with variation in the degree of coarseness, some being quite fine. Analysis of the clay has been applied only to the bird vases.479 Five types of which Types 3, 4, and 5 are decorated. Size: H. 0.46-0.52 m. Jug type 1.

I think, however, that Evans did not mean that all twelve vases came from the TR, as modern scholars understand him.501 Probably two or three more than those first identified by the excavators may have been restored from fragments (some taken to the AM), and some fragments do exist in the Stratigraphical Museum. Mackenzie mentioned some retrieved from the cists N of the TR.502 It is impossible now to distinguish which vases came from where. That is why all the bird vases in different museums are studied here but not all necessarily belong to the TR.5°3 Concerning the shape and the origin of the bird vases Evans wrote that it is derived from 'a primitive skin vessel' ... it is in fact a typical ceramic product of Melos'.5°4 Since such vases have been found in other Cycladic islands and not only Melos, they could be considered as Cycladic products, and not necessarily Melian. 5°5 Physico-chemical analyses conducted by Jones point to the Cyclades as their place of production.506 Though no pithoi were found in the TR, all the vases recovered are large and heavy. It is very difficult to view them as vases actively used in the cult, in the sense of being moved about as part of the ritual. However, their role was almost certainly that of bringing liquid offerings in to the shrine.507 It is no doubt significant that most are decorated, with the implication that these were gifts from people of substance and that they formed noteworthy pieces of furniture in the shrine. The fact that some vases come from the Cycladic islands shows the extent of influence of the Knossos Shrine. The small mouth and general shape of the bird vases imply that they too contained liquids. Some of the bird vases, the interior of which could be examined, have an extremely rough interior surface which may be due to the action of acidic liquids such as wine, perhaps brought and offered to the Knossos Shrine by people from the Cyclades, as Evans pointed out.508 The birds he saw as 'a misunderstood copy of a winged griffin'.509 MacGillivray510 identified them as Alectoris Chukar. Their formation in a file recalls migratory birds in flight; the circles among them are enigmatic. DATE OF THE VASES At first Evans511 dated the TR vases to LM Ia, mainly on the strength of the white spiral on a dark ground and again of the white on dark 'grass design' (FIG. 26 ¿/, type 3). In the subsequent publication512 he saw them as 'typical MMIIF . . . 'belonging to the latest MMIII phase'. Of amphora 331 (FIG. 36; PLATES 24-5, 28 ¿/),513 (which he had originally thought imported) he recorded: 'an example of dark decorative patterns on a light ground. The surface, however, unlike that of the typical LM I vases is dull'. 500 Evans 1921, 557. 501 Stucynski 1982, 52; Gessei 1985, 87. 5°2 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1904, 11) wrote: 'fragments of a vase or vases with birds apparently of Melian fabric like those found in the cists which contained the porcelain figures'. 503 MacGillivray (1984, 153) attributed two vases to the TR, while in note 7 he mentioned fragments of at least two more bird vases in KSM FII 14 boxes 740-742, from the cists N of the TR. 504 Evans 1902-3, 50. 5°5 I thank Dr M.

What he had originally considered as LM Ia became typical MM IIlB. However, views on what is MM IIlB or LM Ia are still controversial. This problem has been extensively discussed by Hood,51* Popham,515 Cadogan,5'6 Warren and Hankey51? and Walberg.518 It seems probable that by 1906, when Mackenzie519 was writing on the MM pottery from several deposits, among them the TR, they had decided that the co-existence of the light-on- dark and dark-on-light decoration and the trend to depict natural themes such as plants and flowers were features that characterized the MM IIlB vases. Popham520 wrote that Evans saw the flower decoration on the TR faience robes as an Egyptian New Kingdom influence and concluded (Evans) that the destruction occurred at the end of MM III, when the two techniques, light-on-dark and dark-on-light, co-existed. Much later Pendlebury521 wrote, 'No doubt if the original excavators had been gifted with prophetic knowledge of what they were going to find, they would have labelled the post-seismic M.M. IIlB pottery L.M. Ia, and put the division between Middle and Late Minoan at that point.' He, however, thought it would be absurd to alter the terminology but suggested 'expanding it to transitional M.M. IIlB - L.M. Ia'. I cannot help thinking that Evans must, at that time, have agreed with Pendlebury's opinion. It seems that he continued to be uncertain to the end about the distinction between MM IIlB and LM Ia pottery or that he did not want to alter the dividing line of the two periods. The TR vases have been dated variously by modern scholars. Platon522 considered the vases to be MM IIIb/LM Ia, noticing at the same time their similarity to some Theran (Akrotiri) vases. Betancourt523 too recognized that although most of the vases are MM III, the presence of faience with dark painted flowers and the vase with dark-on-light spirals 'raise the possibility that they are at the edge of the next phase'. Warren and Hankey524 presented a more critical study of all the deposits in the Palace and in the Houses surrounding it, deposits assigned by Evans to the MM IIlB destruction. Their results transferred many of Evans's MM IIlB deposits to the MM IIIb/LM Ia transition period and others to the pure or late LM Ia. The TR vases were placed in a mature LM Ia phase (contemporary with the main and final Theran destruction), essentially because some of the vases are 'close to pieces from Thera'.525 A large number of vases in the final destruction of Thera has been identified by Marthari as imports from Knossos.526 She, however, believes that none of the TR vases are clear cases of LM Ia late date.527 Warren too sees them now as MM IIIb/LM Ia vases.528 This would imply that the TR destruction occurred before the final Theran destruction, all the more so since Marthari529 found fragments of Melian bird vases (like those in the TR) in the destruction layer of LM Ia early date on Thera. Warren530 sees this Theran LM Ia (earthquake) destruction as contemporary with the MM IIIb/LM Ia transition in Cretan terms.

It is evident that the uncertainty in dating the TR vases continues to exist among modern scholars and this reflects the difficulty they present. This difficulty is accentuated by the fact that all the TR vases are heavily built specimens which, like pithoi, do not break easily and so can last for a long time. Their shape and decoration too may not change as often as on the small vases. As Popham532 has pointed out small, fine wares are easier to date. In the TR there is no small fine ware, not even conical cups. The only small vases recovered are in faiçnce; two small bowls533 actually recall conical cups (197, 198), but unlike most conical cups, they are carefully made (at least the inside surface) and elaborately decorated with cockles or figure-of- eight shields and knobs in relief (see section on faience). A closer study of the TR vases, most of which have now been identified may throw some light on the problem of dating them. Most of them are made of bad quality clay, are not well fired and are carelessly painted. The white-on-dark vases with bands and spirals exemplify this to the full; often the white spirals are rather irregular and the bands have drips of the paint. These are characteristics of the MM III period large vases discussed by Evans,534 Betancourt,535 and Niemeier.536 A few vases, however, exhibit certain features which are characteristic of a later date. 323 (FIG. 33; PLATE 27) was published by Marinatos with Evans's permission.537 It is decorated with white olive tree flowers on a purple ground; the bad quality fabric and the purple ground are characteristics of MM IIIb date and the olive spray is a motif which appeared in MM IIb according to Evans.538 In MM IIb pottery the sprays are arranged on the vases side by side in a rigid row always bending to the right. On a vase from a house in Mesara539 this same arrangement of five olive sprays is seen; they bend to the right but they are portrayed in an extravagant way with many leaves and sprays, while 'purple orange' rosette-like flowers and white dots are sprinkled around the olive sprays. Marinatos recognized the naturalism of the flowers in this vase but gave it a MM IIb date because of its polychrome decoration. What is important is that this vase was found together with small vases, which Marinatos dated to LM I, some of which have dark-on-light reed decoration.540 The question is, was the vase with the olive sprays contemporary with the small vases from the same deposit, or was the deposit disturbed? The vase from the TR (323) is executed freely with the olive sprays arranged in pairs, bending to the right, but their sprays are also bending gracefully in pairs, almost joining while the top sprays are in fact double with a fine leaf in between. This naturalism and freedom of execution is as, or even more, advanced than that in similar representations in frescoes at the Palace, which are considered to be LM I.541 Amphora 327 (FIG. 35; PLATE 26 a) was singled out by Warren and Hankey,542 because it has reed or grass decoration 532 Popham 1977, 192. 533 Evans 1921, fig. 356. 534 Evans 10,21, ^0,2-3. 533 Betancourt iq8^, 103. 536 Niemeier 1985, 80, fig. 27.

It is divided into vertical zones by wide brown bands from shoulder to base. On the bands as well as on the shoulder there are fine white reed or grass ornaments. The other zones are covered with dark-on-light ornament: elongated leaf-like orange designs on a buff-orange semi-lustrous or lustrous ground. One more vase, 330 (fig. 35; PLATE 28 c), exhibits similar decoration and seems to have been made by the same hand. It is divided in the same way, by deep orange bands, but instead of the reed or grass design it has white fine wavy lines where the reed or grass should be. These two vases bear characteristics of both MM III and LM Ia vases. The quality of the clay is better than in MM IIIb vases. The division of the vase into vertical panels of light and dark can be seen on a polychrome MM IlB vase from Phaistos.543 On the TR vases, however, the vertical and horizontal panels in light-on-dark and dark-on-light monochrome could be seen as examples of the blending of the two techniques. The dark-on-light leaf-like ornament may be the predecessor of the mature LM Ia reed with wide leaves. These two vases could stylistically lie on the borderline of MM IIIb and LM Ia, when the light-on-dark technique was giving way to the dark-on-light. Another amphora544 326 (FIG. 34) described by Mackenzie545 is divided (in a rather more abstract way) into zones defined by double circles or double lines. Inside the two circles, covering the front and back, there are white-on-dark vegetable designs similar to the peas shown on a vase from Palaikastro.546 Just below the handles a set of 3 'tulip-like flowers' or crocuses spring out of a bunch of leaves. The natural way these flowers are painted, again points to the naturalism seen on LM Ia vases. The same arrangement is seen on a vase from the Theran seismic (LM Ia early) destruction.547 Amphora548 328 is unique in the TR because it exhibits polychrome decoration with two colours involved (FIG. 36; PLATE 26 a, frontispiece). The design covers the whole vase: two plants, palm- like with white leaves, springing from the base of the vase (terminating in a single filled in spiral) and white petals filled in with ochre yellow paint. This vase seems to continue the MM polychrome tradition but the way the paint is applied recalls wall paintings rather than a clay vase. Amphora 331 is also unique in the TR (FIG. 36; PLATES 24-5, 28 d). It combines a lustrous buff/ orange surface with deep orange bands549 and white decoration on them bearing spirals and wavy lines, as well as ripple, it is the only vase in the TR with tortoiseshell ripple decoration. A series of such examples were found in the final destruction layer at Thera.550 322.0 (frontispiece) is also a unique example; it is the only clay vase with a conical base and it is decorated with circles and elongated dots in polychrome imitating conglomerate. Popham551 considers this type of decoration to be characteristic of LM Ia date. Analogous decoration was found on a vase at Gournia552 in a LM Ia context and at Thera. Most importantly Evans placed a fragment from a vase with the same decoration (except that it is mostly dark-on-light) from the Temple Tomb to 'the mature L.M. Ia phase ... the date thus . . . answers to that of a considerable catastrophe that befell both the palace, and ... the neighbouring "Temple Tomb".'553 Many deposits in and around the palace have recently been seen by Macdonald as the result of this 'catastrophe'.554 Could the TR deposit be the result of the same destruction? 543 Evans 192 1, 260, fig. 193. 544 Evans 1921, fig. 446. s« Mackenzie iqo6, 2^8. 546 Evans 1Q21, fier. 44&lt;sa,b. 547 Marthari 1984, fig. 9. 548 Evans 1921, Colour Plate vii opp.p.596; Brown 1986, fig. 30b. 549 This may be what Evans called ' "new red" decoration of the early part of L.M.

The vases which have reed or grass decoration, naturally delineated plants, approaching the naturalism seen in LM Ia frescoes557 and conglomerate decoration, could have been made in LM Ia or in MM IIIb/LM Ia or they are the work of advanced potters in MM IIIB,558 perhaps working under the aegis of the palace shrine. Or they could have been offered to the shrine after the MM IIlB destruction and before the sealing of the TR; this would imply that some time intervened between the MM IIlB destruction and the closing of the TR. If they were made in MM IIlB this would mean that the destruction did not stop the cultural development and thus the blending of dark-on-light and light-on-dark vases and the representation of natural themes continued after the destruction until naturalism reached full maturity in late LM Ia. Again this implies that the destruction was not severe enough to stop the cultural development; however, we know that the MM IIIb destruction was so severe that it triggered the Great Rebuilding in LM Ia, we could, thus, wonder whether the TR belong to the MM IIIb destruction or to a later, less severe, one. Probably two factors need to be taken into account in dating the TR vases. Firstly, as stated above, by their nature their decoration may not change much with time. Secondly the large number of Minoan imports at Thera, which are the same as the TR vases, could not all have been kept as 'curios' like the Cycladic bird vases at Pyrgos.559 The faience vases, which may be taken as equivalent to the small fine ware in deposits such as those from Warren's560 Stratigraphical Museum or Popham's561 Unexplored Mansion excavations, have plant decoration in the dark-on-light technique. The robes of the same material have crocuses presented in the most naturalistic way, again in the dark-on-light technique. Of course being of faience they may have been the first objects to be made with such scenes, the forerunners of what was to be depicted on clay vessels. To this should be added the observations made on the other objects found in the TR. Younger, on stylistic grounds, and Pini, on typological, have dated to LM Ia the latest seals, which are responsible for the impressions.502 Strong similarities are also evident between the faience figures and the ladies on the Theran frescoes.563 The same applies to the way the agrimia are portrayed on the faience plaques and the antelopes on the Theran frescoes.504 What should also be pointed out is the idea of the marine element so much emphasised in the TR. The artist of the faience marine objects may have been in the forefront in promoting such decorative motifs in faience, a luxurious, costly material. The fashion was naturally followed by the painters who painted frescoes with marine themes such as those in the Queens Megaron565 or at Phylakopi,566 and naturally the potter, with his less costly material, would follow suit: hence the LM IB Marine style pots.567 There need not be a large chronological gap 555 Warren and Hankey 1989, 57, 59, 63. 556 Warren and Hankey 1989, 72-5. 557 On frescoes from Knossos see Cameron and Hood 1967. 558 As put forward by Walberg 1992, 13. 559 Cadogan 1984, 162-3. 560 Warren iqqi, 31Q-32. 56' Popham 1984, 153-8. 562 Younger 1089, 59; Pini 1990, 52-3. 563 Doumas iqq2, pls. 1 16-21. 564 Doumas 1Q02, pl. 83. 565 Evans 1021, fig. 3Q4- 566 Evans 1921, fig. 393. 567 Mountjoy 1985, 231-42 and 1993.</page><page sequence="163">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES Y^ ' ) J Z' 0 K&gt; ' 1 J 0 K&gt; ' I ' / 1 I n te~ 364a Fig. 40.

The LM IB potter was not far removed in time from the TR faience artist or the Theran fresco painter. These observations show that there are grounds for seeing a connection between the TR destruction and the Theran destructions. Whether the destruction of the TR shrine was the result of the seismic or the main and final destruction at Thera568 or of some local event569 close in date to the Theran destructions, must remain an open question. At least until more deposits containing vases similar to those in the TR are found together with small fine wares, which are easier to date. General Conclusions The material discussed above was retrieved from two cists. None was in position in a shrine, though it is believed that all was from a common source and was sealed in the TR at the same time, since parts of the main faience figure were found in both. Such an assumption is fundamental to all further discussion. The first point is to review the evidence and to assess its nature and intent. This has been partly anticipated in the above text wherever the term 'shrine' has been employed. Two separate sets of finds argue directly and incontrovertibly for a concern with matters outside the ordinary everyday world: namely the figurines in faience and the stone offering tables. Much of the rest, though impressive, could as well be at home in a secular milieu. It matters not whether, with Evans, the figurines (five or six) are seen as divine or, with Foster,570 as participants in a rite (presumably therefore serving priestesses). Snakes never have been an accoutrement of normal daily attire. Aspects of the figures' clothing (especially the hats) reinforce this point. There can only be one basic interpretation, the religious.571 Starting from this focal point, how we see the remainder of the evidence is more subjective and hypothetical. There are two interconnected questions: what part did the other finds play and to what kind of deities was the worship directed? Most of the preserved finds, apart from the ceramic vessels and the seashells, are the faience pieces. Their number and the often elaborate forms, into which they have been fashioned, are an indication of the importance of their source. Many are suitable for inlays forming compositions, which suggest display. The vases were intended perhaps as part of the ritual activities, and the beads may have had some decorative function. Display seems to be the central theme and motivation. Display is also evidenced in the stance of the figures: they are standing displaying their snakes.572 The same holds true for the gold, the stone objects, some ivory and bone pieces, the antlers and the seashells. Another major concern must have been storage: the ceramic vessels are largely concerned with this. Though it is assumed that liquids are involved (water, wine or oils), the presence of the corn shows that there were other commodities. The stone offering tables could serve for either solids or liquids. If 289 is from a lyre, a musical dimension is added. If it is a ship's prow, it maintains the marine connection. 568 Warren and Hankey 1989, 72-3. 569 Probably that referred to by Evans: 'It is clear that there was some widespread partial destruction at Knossos during the earlier phase, a, of L.M. I - or somewhat later than 1550 B.C.' (1928, 625). 570 Foster 1979, 72. 57' On Minoan Religion see Evans 1901; 1931, 3-42; Nilsson 1927; Dietrich 1983, 55-60; Warren 1979; and 1989; Marinatos 1993. 572 Evans's display of the firgures in PLATE 17 is reasonable. Unlike the similar clay figures from Kea (Caskey 1981, 133) they cannot be taken as dancing.</page><page sequence="165">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES ^g Of the remaining finds, little can be said from this viewpoint about the fish vertebrae, carbonized wood and bronze fragments. The clay objects (sealings, noduli and roundels) pose another problem: it is not unreasonable to see them as part of the bureaucratic administration of a working shrine, perhaps for internal security or book-keeping, perhaps recording relations with the outside world or dependencies elsewhere. Another possible line of interpretation has been offered. The sealings might have marked offerings sent to the shrine, and the flat-based type enclosed requests for blessings. Since we do not know the ultimate source of the sealings, it is difficult to determine what relevance the scenes they portray have to the shrine: the 'God' or 'Goddess' with attendant felines are a good case in point. The fact that the clay of most looks the same may point to a single source, perhaps the palace itself. It is noticeable that flowers and animals are well represented, in generally neutral or non-violent scenes: but this is an element in Minoan iconography (in seals and other media) that is characteristic of Minoan society as a whole, and not merely the overtly religious side of it. Among the display material, apart from the simply ornamental such as ivory or faience strips and plaques intended for inlay, the common feature is the theme of Nature. Animals of sea and land are well represented, flowers and fruits too. The snakes might have a chthonic and regeneration value, and the cross and 'sun' symbol (of rock crystal and precious metal foils) an astral one. All the kosmos could be present. At the more detailed level of identifying the deities, I have stressed the emphasis on the gentle and nurturing side of nature.This is observed not only in the presence of young and mature together (animals, and perhaps in the bud-flower- fruit cycle), but also in the explicit scenes of suckling and in the argonauts which are the symbol of fertility since they create their shells only to enclose their eggs. More broadly expressed, this same theme could encompass all the natural objects in the TR, including the somewhat less obvious instances offish vertebrae and the antlers. Is there any aggressive, violent or sacrificial component present? The way the faience figure (211) waves the snake(s) about may be taken as an act of violence. But whether this exercise is intended to portray outright dominance of the creatures or to demonstrate more spectacularly the power of the wielder (through the protection of the divinity) in being invulnerable cannot be told. Dominance may also be shown in the sealings showing a figure with an animal (Master or Mistress of the Beasts). Such may indeed have been a or the central figure in the shrine, but this class of evidence cannot be invoked to prove it. Sacrifice or offerings are assumed to have occurred:573 corn perhaps being one element in it. Active blood-sacrifices are another matter: Evans has suggested these by several of his interpretations: the ivory handle of a sacrificial blade (our potential lyre or boat piece), and the deer antlers and greasy condition of the soil. The antlers, however, are ones shed naturally; the soil's texture (ETR) could be due to oils spilt in the destruction (or kept in the repository, see Chapter 4) or dregs leaked from the vases after disposal in the cists. There is, thus, no evidence for blood sacrifices, unless the seashells are seen in this light, smaller-scale offering, but their condition shows that many were collected as beach shells of already dead animals. What then may we conclude concerning the Powers being revered? That they were female and concerned with the natural world is clear, the common Minoan expressions (symbols) or exemplars of this, seen in all media, are present: goats or agrimia (wild), cows (tame); crocuses, pomegranates, lilies and the lotus or papyrus; and several sea creatures, including argonauts. 573 On sacrificial ritual see Marinatos 1986.</page><page sequence="166">!50 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Their concern perhaps also extended to the heavens in the form of a sun disc and astral cross and the fish which are associated with the sun. The young and mature pairing argues for an interest in fertility and prosperity (traditionally associated with the female side of life) which may in turn explain the dominance of this sex in the obvious motifs in the animal plaques and the 'human' figurines. The sole male figure is the 'Master of Animals' on a sealing: ambivalent evidence as has been pointed out above. The second issue is what light these findings may cast on the where the shrine was, and its organization and likely clientele. Mackenzie speaks of a certain stratification both in the positioning of the clay vessels at the top of the cists and also of the faience objects. This might have implied that the Repositories, as found, were storage units for shrine paraphernalia between festivals and services, and that accordingly a proportion of the trappings were not ordinarily on display. This, however, seems unlikely to be the case: a good proportion of the objects were broken in antiquity or out of position (some even dispersed between the two cists). Naturally, something was kept in the cists (see Chapter 4), but as found they represent the careful collection and deliberate disposal of a mass of shrine furniture.574 The fact that two smaller cists had been built over the closed tops (probably in the course of the closing of the main pair) in a raised floor level firmly demonstrates that no disturbance was then planned to occur. Nor did it, despite Evans's assertions about the two stone hammers. It seems reasonable to assume that the Temple Repositories were part of a shrine area, but it is an assumption. Whatever the purpose they were finally put to need not have any bearing on earlier usages. Accordingly, a better appreciation of this point should be left to a consideration of the broader architectural picture, as set out in Chapter 4. It is unlikely that these contents would have been shifted too far from their original position, and so the presumption is that a shrine did exist in this area. In this respect, it is worthwhile observing the proximity, and similar nature and circumstances of the Vat Room deposit, a few metres to the west, with all its implications of continuity of purpose in this part of the West Wing in the Old and the New Palace. Evidence such as the carbonized corn and wood, the soft-baked sealings, the calcified seashells, the seemingly mud-brick derived soil in the cists (with pieces of white and red lime wall-plasters) may all show that a destruction accompanied by fire was responsible for the broken pieces so ceremoniously disposed of. The soil in the sealed cists was probably from a structure caught in the same catastrophe as that which damaged the objects. The alternative to this would be that the items had been laid to rest and sealed over before the destruction that affected the architecture of the unit in which they were so stored. The quality of workmanship in the more complete pieces and the luxury status of much of them argue for a richly endowed shrine, which would be expected from its position well within the Palace itself. But there are half-made stone tables or lamps; it is not obvious how they are to be taken. Whom was the shrine meant to serve? Its position within the palace, but overlooking the open area of the Central Court, may offer a clue. The clue is given by the Miniature Temple Fresco, if it represents activities taking place in the area of the West Wing itself.575 Here Court ladies (dressed in much the same costume as are the faience figurines) are drawn in some detail and at a greater scale amidst a sea of male and female heads sketchily blocked in en 574 Panagiotaki 1993, 50-2. 575 On the use of the Central Court at Knossos on the basis of the Miniature Temple fresco see Davis 1987, 157-61; on cult scenes see Willetts 1962, 54-119.</page><page sequence="167">THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES ^ masse. This surely represents a division of social ranking, and thereby argues that such events were open to all Minoan society.576 That does not directly mean that the shrine itself was available to all comers, but it might yet have been so to a degree. In this manner, the items such as the myriad painted seashells and beads could be interpreted, as well as apparently more individual and unusual 'dedications' like the deer antlers and fish vertebrae.577 The position of the shrine area facing E may indicate that it was used for ceremonies connected with the rising of the sun or the moon. The possible astral disc may have been used in such ceremonies to attract the light and dazzle the people present and thus announce perhaps the Goddess's epiphany.578 A final word on the dating: The date of the vases has been seen as MM IIIb, MM IIIb/LM Ia or LM Ia. It is certain that not a single vase from the TR could be dated as LM IB. However one cannot avoid noticing the great numbers of marine objects in faience (such as argonauts, seashells, sea rocks, fish), which are all found in LM IB depicted on frescoes, painted on clay vases, inlaid in gold daggers or worn as ornaments in various materials. Also the crocus seen on the faience dresses in the TR is a common theme on clay vases in the LM Ia period. Nor can one ignore the similarities of the faience figures (in dress and ornament) to the ladies depicted on the Theran frescoes. With these considerations in mind I tend to see the material produced and eventually sealed in the TR as thé forerunners of the Marine Style579 so characteristic of the LM IB period, and therefore not far removed chronologically. Although most of the clay vases do belong to earlier dates the evidence taken together ought to place the closing of the TR in LM Ia. Catalogue of Finds faience Plants and flowers 144. Lily. HM 85.

Most part of skirt restored, parts of neck and body; recomposed of innumerable fragments. She wears long skirt, tight around waist, opening to hem: parallel horizontal lines cover the whole full skirt and terminate at a border filled with connected lozenges. An apron falls in front down to about knee level, and also at back: it has a border of two horizontal lines followed by another band of 'connected' S-spirals. The middle is covered with round spots matching the spots of the snakes. A tightly fitted jacket of probably transparent material, with richly embroidered sleeves comes down to elbows. A deep 'V in front leaves breasts bare; below breasts edges of jacket are braided and laced across by black cords which are tied in big bow-like knot. A high tiara, wound round spirally, is worn on the head. Arms are stretched forward, holding two snakes which curl around them. More snakes circle around breasts, climb up the tiara, hang down on the apron and around the waist. All snakes are of greenish colour with black spots; the ones tied in a knot around waist are much bigger and thicker. Her hair falls in fringe on forehead just below tiara, and behind reaches to her shoulders: it is straight and black. Her eyebrows and eyes are shown in relief: eye- pupils and eyebrows picked out in brown/black. Her ears are slightly too large. Her skin is greyish/bluish- white, and of a fine texture. Dress is purplish or purplish brown, its decoration in black. H. 0.342. Not measured or handled.

The aim is to understand the function of the CPS Area in its last architectural phase, based on the surviving architecture and the finds that go with it. Further evidence of architectural remains belonging to earlier phases may help to better understand some of the conclusions involving function arrived at in the two previous chapters.1 Concerning this area Evans wrote: 'this Western Palace Section . . . presents a curiously symmetrical, tripartite arrangement. This consists of a Middle block containing the two Pillar Rooms and their surroundings, and the two others of almost exactly equal dimensions which may be distinguished respectively as the West Central "insula", North, and the West Central "insula", South'2 (FIGS. 48, 49; PLATE 30). The CPS as defined in this study is thus called by Evans the West Central Insula Middle. It is bordered to the North by the WCI(N), the Throne Room as it now stands, together with the Jewel Fresco Room; to the South by the WCI(S), once called the 'Central Clay Area'3 or 'Court of the Altar'4 together with the Chariot Tablets Room and the Stone Vases Room; to the East by the Central Court; and to the West by the Long Corridor of the Magazines. It is a rectangular area consisting of nine rooms and a corridor with their floor levels sunk (like the Throne Room area) below the level of the Central Court (PLAN I in pocket; also FIG. 46). The rooms are: the Lobby of the Stone Seat (LSS, 32)? the East and West Pillar Crypts (EPC, 30 and WPC, 29), the Great Pithos Room (GPR, 33), the Temple Repositories Room (TRR, 34), the Vat Room (VR, 31), the Room of the Niche (RN),6 the narrow room N of the WPC, (A), the large Room N of A (B), the Corridor S of the Pillar Crypts (C), and the space between the Central Court and the GPR and the TRR (Z&gt;), which forms the N wing of the Tripartite Shrine (TS). Structures above the CPS have not survived, but it is evident from the staircases that have, and from gypsum door-jamb bases at the appropriate level, that there was at least one floor above it.7 Two staircases, one immediately N of the CPS and a smaller one E of the Chariot Tablets Room, lead to the upper floor(s). The CPS can be divided into two units both ultimately and to varying degrees dependent on the LSS.8 These units are (a) the NE Unit, consisting of the GPR and the TRR, and (b) the 1 On the relationship of architecture and function see Fotou 1988, 178-89; and forthcoming. 2 Evans iQ2i, 424-^. 3 Evans 1 899-1 900, 17. 4 Evans 1902-3, 36. 5 The numbers in brackets next to each room are the ones used in Hood and Taylor 1981, 33. 6 Neither this room nor the following ones are numbered in Hood and Taylor 1081, 33-4. 7 Restored Plan of Entrance System and Piano Nobile of West Palace Section by Newton and Fyfe (see Evans 1028, in pocket). 8 As Palmer (1963, 79) observed 'to the north and west of the room of the Chariot Tablets lies a suite of rooms, the key to which is the open lobby off which they open'.</page><page sequence="197">î82 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS W Unit. The latter is made up of sub-units in which the EPC plays a local pivotal role similar to that of the LSS with respect to the whole. The sub-units are: (i) the WPC; (ii) the VR, and (iii) the RN with Rooms A and B. A third unit would be the SE Unit, the Chariot Tablets Room (ChTR) with the Stone Vases Room (SVR) and their surroundings. Evans did not see this unit as part of the CPS probably because, although it is directly connected to it, it forms a unit of its own. I have considered it here only from the circulation point of view. For more details on this unit see Driessen.9 There is no confirmed connection between the CPS and the rooms adjacent to it N (the Jewel Fresco Room and Throne Room area); the N wall of the CPS is the S load-bearing wall of the grand E-W staircase leading to the upper floor(s). History of Excavation in the Region Excavations started in late April 1900, and were largely completed within a fortnight (25 April-8 May; see FIGS. 46-7). At the same time excavation continued in the Throne Room, the Central Court, the Stone Vases Room and the Chariot Tablets Room. Attention was focused on the Throne Room and the Stone Vases Room because of their impressive finds. There were not any such finds in the CPS, with the exception of clay tablets, so naturally it received less attention, which may explain why we have so little stratigraphie information. All the rooms were excavated down to their floor levels10 with the exception of the TRR, Z), and the W part of C (FIGS. 46-7; PLATE 32 a). These were completed in 1901. In or before 1903 (i.e. before the TR were excavated) a trench was opened in Room B as it is indicated in FIG. 45 but nothing is known about it. In 1903 a series of tests were made under the gypsum floor slabs of the region; the material from these tests is presented in Chapters 2 and 3. In 1907 the SE corner of the LSS was investigated and the staircase was reconstructed as wide as it is today, on the evidence found then (PLATE 31 b' also FIG. 59). " In 1909 Evans12 identified the bases of columns on the 'stylobate5 along the E façade of the CPS and the idea of the existence of a Tripartite Shrine was formed (FIGS. 58-9). In 1923 the CPS acquired a roof, the continuation of the Stepped Portico.13 In 1925 the 'Wall S. of Central Stairs' was investigated14 and tests were made under the 'stylobate' along the Central Court, two of which were in that part of the 'stylobate' belonging to the CPS. In 1930 a trench was opened immediately S of the Great Pithos in the GPR and another one at the threshold leading into the TRR.15 What can be deduced from the above work is that below the gypsum paving lie Neolithic layers except where MM material is trapped in pockets between later floors or when it is deliberately placed in pits or in cists. Much later, further investigations were carried out by Hutchinson and Platon.16 Evans, Hutchinson and Platon also restored and consolidated remains in the area, carefully imitating 9 Driessen 1990, 48-73; also Popham 1993, 178-9. 10 See levels on Plan FlG. 46. Mackenzie always recorded the depth of a room, from the top to the floor, in his daybooks. 11 Mackenzie DM/DB 1907, 83, 7 May. 12 Evans 1928, 803-8. 13 Brown 1986, 52, 26b. It is evident from fig. 7 in Cook 1946 that the EPC was only half roofed until then, and the same may be true for the WPC as its concrete roof is split in the same way as the roof of the EPC is (E-W). Both may have been roofed over by Platon in 1948 or later. 14 Pendlebury 1933-5, *4&gt; % 9- 15 Evans 1935, 634-5; Pendlebury 1933-5, 14. 16 For Hutchinson 1962, 165; Platon 1947, 635; 1955, 554-5; 1961, 103-11.</page><page sequence="198">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY ^3 A 354 I i^T^^l ' ^ft I ( I Fig. 41.

It is easy to confuse the original with the restored since few records of these interventions were published. It is even uncertain, to which of the authors (Evans, Platon, Hutchinson) the various repairs are to be assigned. Evans tended to inset the top portions of walls that he built up, and used a clawed chisel freely to form stone blocks. Platon was concerned with achieving a high standard of verisimilitude in his repair work,17 though his tendency to favour a pinkish-tinged cement over Evans's grey often provides a clue to recognition. However, certainty and consistency are far from absolute. One can never be sure how much of a wall was pulled down before reconstruction began. The New Study This study of the CPS was conducted in three stages. The first stage, which was part of my Ph.D. thesis, began in 1987 and involved cleaning and studying the whole area, except Rooms A and B.18 A photographic record of all the architectural features was kept.19 A series of the original photographs provided by the Ashmolean Museum20 enabled me to understand the state of the architectural remains when Evans found them; this meant that comparisons between what Evans found and the restoration work that followed could be made. A new architectural plan was made which was based on plans prepared by the Greek Ministry of Culture as part of the restoration work in the Palace, now in progress.21 The plan was completed with architectural details, which became obvious when the area was cleaned and studied.22 The second stage of my study, conducted in 1993, involved the transport of the pithos fragments from Rooms A and B (where they were stored) to the Stratigraphical Museum.23 Permission to transfer them was granted by the then Curator of the Heraklion Museum, Mr Kritzas, and the Director of the British School, Dr French, in collaboration with Dr Macdonald, the Knossos curator and the present Heraklion Museum Curator, Mrs Karetsou.24 Subsequently, Dr Macdonald and I sorted and stored the pithos fragments in new plastic boxes in the storeroom west of the Lapidarium, in the Stratigraphical Museum. Among them were pithos fragments from the CPS, which had been mentioned by Evans25 but were never published and were subsequently considered lost. Mr N. Daskalakis and Mr A. Klinis devoted a week to cleaning the CPS26 under my supervision. A thick layer of soil had accumulated in the rooms that I had cleaned in 1987 as a result of rainwater saturating them through the now old and weakened concrete roof. A much thicker layer (often up to 15 cm), lay in A and B which had not been cleaned in 1987.27 A photographic record was kept of all the architectural features previously undetected. 17 Platon 1955, 554-5 18 The study of these two rooms was impossible because of large boxes with pithoi fragments stored in them. 19 A series of these photographs can be seen in my PhD thesis (Volume 2), at the University of London (UCL). 20 I am greatly indebted to Mrs Ann Brown and the Ashmolean Photographic Archives for allowing me to have copies of the original photographs. 21 I am grateful to the Ministry of Culture for allowing me to use their plans. 22 The plan was inked by a HM draughtslady Mrs P. Stefanaki with my guidance. 23 The large wooden boxes that contained them were all rotten and were thrown away; one, the best preserved, was placed empty on the stone bench in the RN. Most of them had wooden labels which were placed in the new boxes together with the new wooden labels that we prepared using permanent ink. 24 I am grateful to them all. 25 Evans 1800-1000, 28, 34. 26 I thank them dearly for the careful work they have done. 27 This may have come from the wall mud plaster or even been brought in to be used as a bedding for the wooden boxes with the pottery fragments.</page><page sequence="201">r86 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS I ^^ i i 362 Of 'J I A 363 Fig. 43.

I was allowed to make three small soundings, which had to be away from weight-bearing walls and only where soil or modern concrete was. I was not allowed to lift gypsum or schist slabs. The new architectural plan was revised and completed; the final version was traced by F. Zanon and N. Skoutelis. RESULTS OF THE NEW STUDY i. In the GPR remains of a plaster or gypsum floor laid over the known gypsum floor slabs were identified (PLATES 34 a; 36 a-b); this floor was missed by Evans and Mackenzie (but not by Fyfe) who, however, recognized it later;28 ii. The floor slab of the West Repository has three perforations, prompting suggestions for its function (plate 37 b); iii. A trench opened by Platon and Hutchinson29 in the EPC was identified and cleaned (PLATE 39 a-b); iv. Room A, which was thought to have a soil floor, was found to have a gypsum one with a burnt layer of soil over it (PLATE 43 b); v. A trench opened by Evans in Room B was also found (PLATE 44 a). RESULTS OF THE EXCAVATION i. The gypsum slabs in the EPC partly uncovered by Platon and Hutchinson and seen by them as the remains of an earlier gypsum floor seem to be part of a gypsum structure, probably cists (see Chapter 2 and PLATES 45 a-b); ii. A test on the S side of the threshold of the Vat Room came upon Neolithic levels almost immediately (see Chapter 2). The same picture was evident at the centre of the Vat Room except that the Neolithic was cut along the W side of the vats and a long sloping trench was created for the insertion of the vats. The few sherds collected from the above trench give some idea of the date the vats were positioned in the VR (see Chapter 2). The architecture of the last phase Design and function of the architecture Access to the CPS Area The CPS is not directly connected with a street or with areas outside the palace on present evidence (FIGS. 48-9; PLATE 30). It is accessible through the Central Court (CC), which could be approached from the N entrance by a street, from the S through the Procession Corridor, and from the E through the river.30 Access was therefore controlled and limited to those who were welcome to the palace. The CC played the role of the intermediary between the outside world and the palace or between the 'public' and the 'private'.31 The exterior of the CPS Area The E façade of the CPS, positioned a few centimetres higher than the pavement of the CC, is not a wall but a 'stylobate' running N-S, from the northernmost limit of the CPS to the S end 28 Evans 1935, 635. 29 Platon 1954, 433; Hutchinson 1962, 165; Cook 1946, 117. 30 It is not clear if the CPS could be approached from the S Propylaeum or even the West Court through the Magazines: detailed investigation/excavation is needed before such routes can be considered possible. 31 By 'private' I mean the people who were using the CPS on an everyday basis while 'public' applies to visitors.</page><page sequence="203">!88 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS of the CC.32 The rooms N and S of the LSS have an E wall, situated about one metre W of the 'stylobate', which forms a kind of niche with it on either side of the LSS. Unlike them, the 'stylobate' forms the E limit of the LSS; as it is of low height, one wonders whether the LSS was open to the CC, or closed off, either by a wall built on the 'stylobate' or by a wooden structure. The walls of the CPS survive to more than four or five courses. The N and S walls and all the internal walls W of the LSS have been restored to a great height to receive a concrete roof. The narrow room E of the ChTR is also roofed with concrete and so is the SVR partly. The LSS, the GPR and the TRR have a plastic roof instead. No entrance or threshold survives on the 'stylobate' but a staircase at the SE corner of the LSS marks the position of the entrance door33 (see FIGS. 45-50 and PLATE 31 a). The dimensions of the staircase imply a large door, though the fact that it leads into a building, which has a floor situated lower than the CC floor, takes us by surprise today. The Minoan visitor conditioned to the Minoan culture and aware of the function of the building may have anticipated such an arrangement. Internal Organization of all Rooms: Circulation (FIG. 44) This study is based on the hypothesis that the position of a building within a whole and its internal organization signify its relationship within this whole and the outside world. Palyvou has stated that in Minoan Architecture the 'private and public domains are usually well defined'.34 With the CPS, however, which is part of the palace, a two-level 'public' relationship should be conceptualized: one within the palace and another with the outside world. As stated above access from the outside world was controlled by the CC. Within the palace the prominent position of the CPS at the 'geometric centre'35 of the West Wing suggests, even without knowing what its façade looked like, that it was a focus. The existence of a staircase from the CC into the CPS may also imply the existence of a door and therefore controlled access into it, even for the users or 'residents' of the palace. The first room to be entered is the entrance hall or what Palyvou would call the 'entry point'36 and since this is the point where the visitor or 'public' first arrives, its relation to the other rooms ought to signify the relationship of these rooms to the public. Thus rooms, which could be accessible to the public, ought to be easily reached from the entrance hall, and rooms, which were confined to the private sector, ought to be far removed from the entrance hall. According to this hypothesis, storerooms where precious objects are kept, whether in a house or a palace, ought to be positioned in spots difficult to reach, in order to protect their contents. Circulation (FIG. 44) The circulation pattern within the CPS offers a great choice. The flow of movement could be directed to the N, W and S. The Minoan visitor would automatically follow the right route to reach the specific room for which he had come;37 we, though, without any clues to guide us, are bound to find ourselves led astray. 32 Although it should be noted that it is interrupted in front of the staircase leading into the LSS as it is obvious in FlGS. 45-50 and PLATE 31 a. 33 In PLATE 31 a and FIG. 46, no threshold is evident consequently what we see today may not be the original. 34 Palyvou 1987, 195; see also Michailidou 1984, 37-50; and 1987, 509-26. 35 Preziosi 1983, 95. 36 Palyvou 1987, 195. 37 Palyvou (1987, 195) points out that architecture can provide certain clues, symbols and orientation marks which are understood by the people of this specific culture.</page><page sequence="204">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY jßg I i i 1 I 1 I - n UIEÏ i tr -1 3 ^■■■^^M mm c=JLJ LI U m MJ t 1 0 S n I ' -1 1 0 S I -1 1 ■" I Fig. 44. Plan of the Central Palace Sanctuary Area and the Chariot Tablets Area (based on Plan I and on Hood and Taylor 1981) showing circulation patterns; traced by Nikos Skoutelis. A single door from the LSS leads north into the NE Unit, first into the GPR and by walking along its west side into the TRR. A polythyron (now reduced to four doors) leads south into a small E-W corridor and through it west into the SVR and south into the ChTR. The ChTR plays a pivotal role locally, since it provides access to rooms further south, east into a narrow room and to the upper floor, through a door on its east wall and a staircase above the narrow room.38 Out of the three doors in the west wall of the LSS the southernmost leads to Corridor 38 Driessen (1990, figs. 12-13) saw this unit completely cut off from the LSS in the two last phases he created; there is not, however, any evidence to support this idea; see Popham !993&gt; I78-9-</page><page sequence="205">!go THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS C and thence into the House Tablets Corridor (HTC) and the West Magazines, while the other two doors lead into the EPC. The EPC is at the geometric centre of the CPS, as Preziosi39 says, and movement from it is directed north and west. The easternmost door, in the north wall, leads into the VR. The westernmost leads into the NW Unit, first into the RN, and then through it into Rooms A and B. A door, in the west wall of the EPC, leads into the WPC. Through an opening, in the south wall of the WPC, one enters the HTC and again, through two more doors, the West Magazines. Thus the flow of movement within the CPS varies. From the LSS there is a one-way movement north into the NE Unit, a dead-end; west into C ending up in the Magazines; one can come back to the LSS through C or through the WPC into the EPC and then into the LSS. In this case one route confronts the other either in the LSS or in the EPC or the WPC; the latter meeting places, since they are further removed from the entrance, may be of a more private character. This private character is further explored in a secondary route within the West Unit followed by the users or 'residents': from the Magazines into the EPC (through the HTC and the WPC) and into the VR or the NW sub-unit and back without the interference of the LSS. Thus the opening in the south wall of the WPC leading into the HTC holds a key position in the circulation pattern of this region, since it provides a private route within the West Unit. If Evans40 was right in seeing the door as 'blocked' during the last phase, this route was at some point discontinued, which means that the Magazines were accessible only through C, which provides a direct connection between the LSS and the W Magazines.41 If the RN was also in part cut off from Rooms A and B, by the cross wall dividing the RN into two, then I cannot visualize for what the north part of the RN and Rooms A and B were used. For there would be no access into them, unless they were either entered from the upper floor (through a trap door or stairs/ladder), or were connected with rooms north or west through doors now blocked (for which there is some evidence).42 However, in all plans the cross wall of the RN does not extend to the east wall of the room and, consequently, access would still have been possible to the north part of the room and Rooms A and 2?.43 Again from the LSS there is a one-way movement south, into the SVR (and back the same way), or into the ChTR. A more private route would be from the SVR into the ChTR and back. From the ChTR there is a one-way movement east, into the narrow room, a dead end; while through the south door in the east wall one reaches the upper floor and comes back into the ChTR. This route is important because it connects the ChTR with the floor above without having to use the CC and the staircase north of the CPS; it is, therefore, a private route to the upper floor(s). Thus the ChTR holds a key position, since it connects the upper floor to the CPS and shows how indispensable the ChTR would have been to the CPS. 39 Preziosi 1983, 95. 40 Evans 1 899-1 900, 34. 41 Driessen (1990, figs. 12-13) saw the corridor as blocked; this was an idea that Evans expressed in his publication of the first season's work (1899-1900, 26) but corrected after the completion of the excavation of the corridor in the next season (1900-1, 27); he stated: 'This circumstance refutes the view that communication between this part of the Palace and the Long Gallery was at any time interrupted'; see also n. 2. Driessen (1990, fig. 13) in his fifth architectural phase, showed the CPS to consist only of the LSS, the GPR, the VR, the EPC and the E part of C. There is not any evidence to suggest that this isolation ever existed. A few doors were not identified in the first excavation season but this, as Evans suggested in his publication (1 900-1, 27), does not mean that they were blocked. 42 Evans (1900-1, 49) referred to door-jamb bases in the W wall of the CPS (leading into the Long Corridor), but he did not give their exact location. Excavation in these rooms could solve the problem of the presumed now lost blocked doors. « See n. 214.</page><page sequence="206">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY xg! This reconstruction of the circulation pattern presupposes that there are openings through which one can pass, but not physical doors which can, in their own right, direct and control movement. Doors have not survived but their stone jamb bases have; their rabbets indicate the way a door closed and, consequently, the side from which it was controlled.44 This is based on the argument that the rabbet on a door-jamb base indicates the direction the door opened (inwards from the rabbet end) and thus the position from which the door was controlled by being bolted or barred.45 In fact, doors may also be locked by various means from either side, but the evidence (holes for the bolts in the door-jamb, some distance off the floor level), is rarely preserved (see examples in the S. House basement46 and the Temple Tomb).47 The doors leading into all the units from the LSS can be closed off from within all these dependent units (including the S Unit, Corridor C and the HTC), an action not undertaken from within the LSS, but in every case from within the unit itself. In the same way the upper floor can be closed off from inside the ChTR; it is not, however, evident if the rooms south of the ChTR controlled access into it or whether they were connected with the CC or the Procession Corridor. Also undetermined are the opening in the southwest corner of the WPC, for which no evidence of a door can be found, and the openings within the NW Unit itself. It is thus evident that the LSS can be shut off from the north, south and west. In the same way the EPC could be isolated from the WPC, the VR and the NW Unit, but it would control access into the LSS. The ChTR would control access into the LSS and to the rooms above, but there is no evidence whether it controlled access to the south as well. In conclusion there are two areas in the CPS (at ground floor level) which are protected from the visitor or public: the NW and W Units; the latter leads into the magazines. Both units are away from the LSS and to reach them you have to go through at least two sets of doors, which are controlled by these areas themselves. On the other hand, the EPC, the NE and the SE Units (ChTR and SVR) are situated closer to the LSS, with only one or two sets of doors to pass through, so they would be more accessible to the visitor. This pattern of access from a central pivotal area controlled by subsidiary rooms is regularly encountered in Minoan architectural planning.48 That control of access should be imposed is not in itself surprising. However, it does seem odd that those exercising control could end by shutting themselves into rooms such as the VR, perhaps Rooms A and B, or the narrow room east of the ChTR, from which there are no other exits. This might make sense if some kind of work or ritual were conducted here, but this inference is only hypothesis. It is more plausible to say that the circulation pattern as the rooms now stand, although it provides good protection for the Magazines, does not make good sense for the use of the VR and the NW sub-unit (particularly if the door leading into the HTC from the WPC was blocked). The south unit is also confusing. This may be the result of architectural alterations to an existing plan in the region, perhaps to serve needs different from before. This idea is further explored in the Phasing Section. 44 On doors and locks see Graham 1987, 170-9, figs. 105-12, 113 (A, B, C), 117. 45 V Fotou pers. comm. 46 Evans 1928, 382-4, figs. 215, 217-18. 47 Evans 1935, 993-5, figs. 946-7. 48 V.

On 1 May a gypsum seat against the N wall was recorded50 (PLATES 32 a-b, 33 a) and the name Lobby of the Stone Seat (used here) was acquired. Excavation continued and on 2nd May the base of a pithos immediately E of the seat (PLATE 33 a) and clay tablets further E were reported.51 The room is mentioned again on 7 May in connection with a rectangular sinking in the middle of it (PLATE 32 a) and the polythyron in the S wall.52 The LSS is rectangular, the largest and grandest chamber in the CPS and this accords well with its pivotal position in affording access to N, W, and S. The S and W walls are restored while the E and N seem to have been left almost as found. Their construction varies considerably and this may be ascribed to differences in function, i.e. simple internal wall, façade wall, and weight-bearing internal wall; it could also indicate that not all the walls were built at the same time. The N wall, stripped today of its revetments, shows its construction: it is the most striking and complex, having been divided into sections (PLATE 33 a). The easternmost part is only a thin partition which consists of two gypsum blocks one set on the other (both with traces of burning) and forming a recess. Between the two blocks are limestone floor slabs, which are part of the mosaiko floor in the N part of the TS area and which must have originally continued S (see TS section and Evans's53 reconstruction). The upper block has a vertical depression, which recalls the recesses cut for clamps, which tie together individual stones in the W façade, but is larger and runs right across the stone. Perhaps, it is intended as a slot for a wooden beam, of which there are plenty of other examples in this wall. It is possible that this block was once part of the adjacent E façade wall, and was merely turned round 90o to its present position (sitting on the mosaiko slabs, see FIG. 58). The vertical depression and the 49 Evans 1899-1900, 28; 1921, 213, 441, fig. 318; Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 25 April) wrote: 'The region immediately N. of the chariot inscriptions-and-stone vases rooms is still being excavated but there seems to have been considerable disturbance of wall remains and no intelligible plan can as yet be made out. The most prominent features are two column bases neither of them, however, in position'. 50 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 1 May) wrote: 'The room with the column-bases and the W pillar room, 37/1, are being excavated to the flooring. The room with the column bases, 2, was found to have a gypsum seat going along its N wall similar to those in the bath-room' [Throne Room] . 5' Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 2 May, sketch 39) recorded: 'The room with the column-bases is being cleared all over its floor. Against the N wall is a stone seat already mentioned and at the E end of this stood a pithos the upper part of which was found broken away. E of this pithos just above the floor a fragment of gypsum slab was raised and underneath it in a deposit of burnt wood a nest of inscription tablets began to come into view most probably belonging to one set. The tablets were in a very brittle condition apparently through the action of gypsum sediment and only a few were brought out fairly whole. The burnt wood as Mr Evans suggests probably belonged to a chest in which the tablets were kept'. 52 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 7 May) wrote: 'The room with the column-bases 45/1, has now been completely excavated and swept. In the centre of the room is a long rectangular sinking of irregular shape running N-S apparently having some function like that of the similar sinking in the pithos- room adjacent to the N. Three steps go down W. into the room from the S. end of its E wall. There is a low stone seat along the N. wall (s.37/2) similar to the ones in the bath- room system. In the NE corner is a hearth-like recess 2. At the S. side is a corridor-like recess 3 with a system of 6 gypsum door- jambs which at a certain date seem to have gone out of use for they are half below the level of the floor adjacent. A central wall-pillar in the flight of doorjambs E-W possibly then supplied the place of the door-jambs. When the spaces between the doorjamb-like blocks were freed of deposit they were found to form rectangular sinkings like those of the room 42/1, W. of the "Pithos-room". The sinking in appearance may, however, have been accidental'. 53 Evans 1921, fig. 152, opp. p. 203.</page><page sequence="208">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY jgg recessed effect of the NE corner of the room, in combination with the traces of burning, were probably responsible for the original interpretation as a 'curious hearth-like structure'54 or as having housed an ingle-nook for a fireplace.55 Later Evans saw it as 'the lower part of the Cella, in which sacred objects may well have been displayed'.56 W of the recess, up to the E end of the bench, the wall consists, at its base, of limestone and gypsum blocks and smaller stones; but above is series of badly burnt and cracked gypsum slabs, horizontally placed one over the other, with mud plaster between to bind them. Immediately E of the bench, there are two gypsum door-jamb bases57 with a block placed between them: a blocked door recorded by Evans58 (see FIG. 50 but also FIG. 54 and PLATE 33 a). Set on each jamb base is a vertical slot left by a timber with its accompanying mud plaster still visible behind the modern concrete repairs, apparently part of the timber framework of the door-jambs.59 Next is the bench area and above it are the same piles of burnt gypsum slabs mentioned before, interrupted at regular intervals by three more vertical slots. So badly deformed was the wall that Evans60 was obliged to construct three buttresses on its N face to keep it upright. Beyond the W end of the bench the wall projects forward, and incorporates reused limestone blocks and irregular pieces of gypsum. This segment, along with another at the E end of the bench, defines a kind of recess (smaller than the bench) which could be nothing more than a gap created by the slumping and erosion of this wall. PLATE 32 a-b reveals a patch of light-coloured wall plaster,61 which was not recorded, and today there is a small patch of hard grey plaster on a gypsum block, at the W end of the wall, perhaps the remains of the plaster in PLATE 32 a- b. A number of vertical beam slots, of which five are clear, were spaced at intervals of 0.60-0.76 m (a feature visible in both faces of the wall). This contrasts with the tendency, found elsewhere in the region, of putting only a single beam roughly at the midpoint of the wall. The technique of using a series of gypsum slab fragments to infill is unique too. A clue to the interpretation of these two features may lie in the pair of door-jamb bases for the blocked door, over which there is a matching pair of the vertical slots. It is likely that in an earlier phase62 there was a polythyron here perhaps mirroring that opposite in the S wall. Mackenzie63 instead of the six probable doors suggested by the beam slots in the wall, placed a very wide door (of roughly the length of the bench) with the blocked door E and the still open one W (FIG. 57 *-*)■ Excavation could probably resolve whether there was a wide door next to the one or a set of six doors now blocked. But here it is proposed that, in the rebuilding during the final or penultimate phase,64 the basic structure was not demolished, but rather infilled with the burnt slabs. Within the wooden beams of the door-jambs, the gypsum slabs were piled up with mud plaster between them; more regular material, reused blocks, was used at the E and W end of 54 Evans 1899-1900, 28. 55 Evans 1028, 804. 56 Evans 1028, 808. 57 On door-jamb bases see Shaw 1973, fig. 181. 58 Evans 1021. fier. 1^2. odd. d. 20^. 59 Fyfe called them 'wooden spaces of later wall', see FlG. ^4. 60 It may be Evans who constructed the buttresses, judging from the grey concrete used. 61 On plasters see Shaw 1973, 207-26. 62 Evans 1921, fig. 152; In FIG. 59, there is a third door-jamb base visible W of the other two but close to them and without a rabbet.

The source of the gypsum slabs may have been from an earlier upper floor or dados,65 in that they appear to show traces of burning on both sides even amidst the mud plaster. Further damage was no doubt sustained once they were in position here. The bench against the N wall was presumably positioned there at the closing of the doors. Platon dated the N wall to MM IIIb, because he found the same kind of burnt slabs as under the present floor of the EPC, where they were connected with MM II pottery.66 He was, no doubt, influenced by Evans, who believed that the reconstructions in this area dated after the MM IIIB67 destruction; it is not, however, clear whether the N wall was infilled then or later. The easternmost part of the S wall consists of a gypsum block similar to those in the recess of the N wall (FIGS. 50-1; PLATE 31 a). Whether it was moved from an earlier position in the E façade wall along the CC is not clear. It does have a deliberate cutting at its centre, probably used to tie it to another such block. The use of these gypsum blocks on the easternmost parts of the N and S walls of the LSS, on either side of the entrance, now gives the impression of a monumental treatment. Did they give the same impression when they were plastered over?68 Fotou thinks that plaster, applied directly on dressed gypsum blocks or ashlar walls, looks much better than when applied on rubble and, moreover, only a thin coat is required.69 The blocks on either side of the staircase would, thus, have preserved their grandeur even if plastered. Running W the S wall consists of rubble masonry with reused limestone and gypsum blocks. A vertical slot is preserved, its timber set on a square limestone block.70 Further W is a series of four doors in a polythyron effect with a thin wall in the middle (FIGS. 50-1; PLATES 31 a; 33 b). Mackenzie71 recorded that six door-jamb bases were found, which he suggested belonged originally to an earlier period, since they 'are half below the level of the floor'. However, he added in pencil: 'the door-jambs in question come hardly above the floor-level of the room'. This would mean that they were above the floor even if only just above it and would, therefore, go with it. The polythyron may originally have had six doors, and later the two middle ones were infilled with rubble, hence the thin middle wall. These alterations may be part of an attempt to reinforce the supporting elements of the wall to receive an upper floor. The date of these alterations is not clear. Only part of the three W pairs of door-jamb bases survive today, badly burnt and corresponding in height to the adjacent floor, which has, however, been repaired and, as a result, its original level may have been altered. Mackenzie72 recorded 'When the spaces between the door-jamb-like blocks were freed of deposit they were found to form rectangular sinkings'. As pointed out by Popham73 it was the first time that Mackenzie had encountered this type of door and he found it reasonable to call them 'sinkings'. 65 Shaw IQ73, 83. 66 Platon 1942-47, 635; these slabs are part of the structure /cist identified in the recent excavation by the present author.

In the NE corner a large block (part of the 'stylobate') lies on an E-W axis, together with one next to it to the N (unlike the others which are on a N-S axis): it projects westwards beyond the width of the 'stylobate'. The block has deliberate cuttings and marks74 along its W side, probably from having been used as a support (see FIGS. 50, 58-9). It looks as if this was the original height of the 'stylobate' but it is not clear what lay on it, to close off the LSS from the CC (see the TS section). The floor is of gypsum and limestone slabs (PLATES 31 b' 32 a); the part w of the steps of the entrance forms a square of irregular limestone slabs (pale in colour, amygdalopetrd) surrounded by a border zone of rectangular gypsum slabs,75 similar to the Throne Room and its Antechamber.76 The NW corner of the square is formed by two heavily burnt gypsum slabs,77 at a slightly lower level than the amygdalopetra ones. The same degree of burning is obvious in the border zone slabs in front of the bench, which seem to be original (the bench is sitting on them, PLATES 32 a' 33 a). Many, if not all, of the other border slabs look modern; some seem to have been placed over the original worn ones to protect them, as part of the restoration, perhaps by Platon. The E part of the room (N of the entrance steps) is covered with pale gypsum slabs of varying size (PLATE 31 b). In colour and type they look the same as the two original steps, adjacent, and the balustrade. The floor of the recess is placed slightly higher, and so is part of the floor adjacent to the dado of the E wall, mentioned above. Immediately W of the balustrade (PLATE 31 b) there is a door-jamb base recorded;78 at a lower level than the surrounding gypsum floor slabs, it may have gone with an earlier floor. Adjacent to it to the N is a small 'trench' with stone remains, which Mackenzie79 (FIGS. 57 a, b' see also Evans's note on FIG. 59) saw as part of the original E façade wall, extending from the GPR down to the door-jamb base, thus defining the original room size. This original room probably went with the burnt gypsum slabs in front of the bench and a central square consisting also of gypsum slabs. This would mean that the mosaiko was later, laid over the burnt gypsum slabs but within the same walls. The gypsum floor slabs N of the balustrade will have been later. The idea of the mosaiko being later than the gypsum paving contradicts Evans80 who saw the 'mosaiko' floor as typical of the MM II period and the gypsum ones as later. Shaw,81 on the other hand, has cited 'mosaiko' floors found in Neopalatial buildings such as Nirou Khani and the palace at Zakro. Lighting. The room may have drawn light from the E, although it is not clear how. Evans thought that 'the R. of the Column Bases had two openings on E for light and approach. One from the steps (which extended its whole breadth) and one from a little area to the N of 74 On clamps and dowels see Shaw 1973, 157-85. 75 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 7 May) wrote: 'The Room of the Column bases 45)1 has a central panel of irregular slabs bordered all round by the usual system of rectangular slabs of gypsum'. On a plan (FlG. 59), Evans has written 'irregular slabs forming base for painted plaster central to pavement' and also 'this may need exploration'. 76 Evans 1899-1900, 36, 54. 77 At first 1 thought it was a repair by the Jvlinoans, but it makes no sense to replace the ironstone irregular slabs with two rectangular gypsum ones. Moreover, the mosaiko is at a higher level than the two gypsum slabs; is it so as the result of restoration by Evans or Platon? I think, however, that both would be more likely to respect the level of the pavements. It seems more likely that the gypsum paving is earlier than the mosaiko which was probably laid over the burnt gypsum floor. Only excavation could resolve this. 78 Mackenzie DM/DB 1007. 84; Evans 1909, fig. 2. 79 Mackenzie DM/DB 1907, 84. 80 Evans 1921, 211; see also Driessen (1990, figs. 9-13) who has seen the mosaiko as an element present throughout the history of the LSS; and Macgillivray 1994, fig. 2. 81 Shaw 1973, 18-19.</page><page sequence="214">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY !gg C/3 &lt; bo fi 1 Q tí cd &lt;u "o Vi &lt; 'co &amp; H o o íã o &lt;u o .g o I bO S o fi &lt; co Th Ü</page><page sequence="215">200 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS FlG. 49.

When he considered the area in connection with the TS, he wrote 'the two wings would have been open'.83 How practical this would be remains unanswered! Hallager84 placed a window over the gypsum dado, which, with its top repaired with white plaster, gives the impression of a window-sill (PLATE 31 b). The block extending into the recess of the N wall, described above, may have been used as a support of a window; however, the concrete evidence of proper dowel holes is lacking and the matter must remain open. Consequently, there is no clear evidence of how the room was lit. 82 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1925, sketch 4) also separated the part of the room N of the staircase by a door, which would give light to the LSS from E, if the 'stylobate' was open. 83 Evans 1928, 808. 84 Hallager 1987, fig. ic,d.</page><page sequence="216">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 201 Furniture. These consist of a flight of steps, one bench and one balustrade, all of gypsum.85 The staircase, almost entirely reconstructed, is a striking feature as it is incorporated into the room (FIGS. 50-1, 57 a, b; PLATE 31 b). It is divided vertically into two parts; only the second and third steps from the bottom up are original and then only their N parts and also two tiny pieces against the S wall. The bottom step was probably in too poor a condition and was replaced; but it seems clear from Mackenzie's86 and Evans's87 notes (FIG. 59) that the remains of three steps were found attached to the S wall of the room. The staircase was thus, originally, as broad as it is now reconstructed. Evans88 thought that the next three risers, above the three gypsum steps, were of wood. It is, however, possible that the level of the CC was lower at an earlier phase and went with the three gypsum steps and the balustrade; or simply the three upper steps were of gypsum too but were removed by stone robbers. The bench89 against the N wall is constructed in exactly the same manner as the benches in the Throne Room and its antechamber. Gypsum slabs on top are supported by gypsum slabs with pilasters, set vertically (FIG. 53 upper sketch; FIG. 54 lower sketch; PLATES 32 a-b; 33 a). There are also gypsum back-panels recalling a bench at Myrtos Pyrgos.90 A strange feature is the shallow recess formed behind the bench (mentioned above) which is too short for the bench to fit completely. It may not have been a true recess but a result of erosion and slumping of the wall. Another, lower, bench-like structure is set against the flight of steps, forming a balustrade; but it looks too low for the present height of the staircase (FIGS. 50-1; PLATE 31 b). It would, however, be of the right height if there were only three steps (three are the original steps found, see above). It is of simpler construction than the bench mentioned above and without pilasters. It is of gypsum, the same kind as the original steps of the staircase and the adjacent floor slabs to the N, suggesting a single source and contemporary construction. A 'sinking' was described by Mackenzie91 in the first excavation season and is shown in PLATE 32 a; it is rectangular and near the SE corner of the central square; it was not mentioned in the publications and it cannot be seen today.

Later during restoration the remains of three steps against the S wall were identified, see Mackenzie (DM/DB 1907, 83, 7 May and sketch on p. 84) 'SE corner of Room of the Column Bases. This stair has now been reconstructed with double the width of its previous restoration. Remains of the S ends of its 3 lowest steps have this year been identified at xxv adhering to the adjoining wall and it was this discovery that made the new reconstructions possible'. 87 See also Evans (1899-1900, 28), originally wrote 'of the steps leading down into the "Room of the Column Bases" only the two lower of stone remained'; in FlG. 59 he indicated the remains of the three steps on the S wall with an arrow and noted 'Show steps running right across (remains were found against S wall)'; see also FIG. 46 'steps 3%'. 88 Evans i8qq-iqoo, 28. 89 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 1 May, also 7 May) wrote: 'there is a low seat along the N wall (5.37/2) similar to the ones in the bath-room system'; Evans (1899-1900, 28) wrote 'along the N wall a gypsum bench with flat pillasters resembling these to be described in the Throne Room and its Antechamber'. 90 Cadogan 1978, 77, fig. 23. 91 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 7 May reported: 'The Room with the Column Bases 45)1 has now been completely excavated and swept. In the centre of the room is a large rectangular sinking of irregular shape running NS apparently having some function like that of the similar sinking in the "pithos-room" adjacent to the N.' 92 Evans (1899-1900, 28) wrote: '. . . two column bases were found above the floor level'; and (1921, 441-2, fig 318) 'gypsum bases of columns fallen from sanctuary above pillar rooms'; also Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 25 April p. 84): 'N of the chariot-inscriptions-and stone-vase rooms is still being excavated but there seems to have been considerable disturbance of the wall remains and no intelligible plan can as yet be made out. The most prominent features are two column bases neither of these, however, in position . . .' Since the column bases were found before the plan of the room could be made out, it is reasonable to suggest that they were found high in the fill and have therefore fallen from the floor above.</page><page sequence="217">202 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS C/3 &lt; be G 1 Q G 03 I I I H % i bo G en &lt;U O &lt;u T3 G cd i-, .3á Tí (D &lt;U bß G I C/5 G oí O m d</page><page sequence="218">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 203 exact position nor their depth was recorded. In PLATES 30, and 32 a, taken in 1900, they can be seen lying by the balustrade. In a later photograph93 they stand against the W wall of the LSS. It seems possible that they were found near the balustrade and they were left there because they were large and heavy, until they were moved and stood upright to be photographed. Evans94 associated them at first with a 'hall or Megaron that seems to have bordered this room to the North upon a higher level'. But later he saw them as the 'Gypsum bases of columns fallen from sanctuary above pillar rooms'95 and 'which [column bases] had clearly belonged to the upper Columnar Hall of the Central Palace Sanctuary'. Evans restored them to what he thought were their original positions above the pillars of the Pillar Crypts.96 However, it seems odd that the bases should have fallen into the LSS from the centre of the Pillar Crypts and not into the fill of the Pillar Crypts themselves. If we accept the hypothesis that they were found near the balustrade, they may have fallen either from the 'stylobate' or an upper equivalent of the LSS room. Evans saw the use of gypsum for column bases as a MM IIIb innovation,97 perhaps influenced by the LSS bases, which may have been the first gypsum column bases he encountered, together with those set in the staircase N of the CPS. They should, thus, be taken as belonging to the great restoration. A gypsum chest, associated with burnt wood and the Linear B tablets, was recorded by Mackenzie and Evans.98 They implied that the wooden box with the tablets was in the gypsum chest. In Mackenzie's Daybook (FIG. 61)" the position of the tablets is indicated by a circle with an X covering the space of two rectangular gypsum slabs which are still in situ (PLATE 33 a). They are the same as the floor slabs around them but smaller (FIG. 57 a-b). It is not clear if they are part of the floor slabs or the remains of the gypsum chest, which according to Mackenzie and Evans contained the tablets. Since the tablets were baked hard and the wooden box turned to carbonized wood, there should be some trace of burning in the gypsum box enclosing both tablets and wood; the two slabs, however, show no trace of burning. It is thus possible that they are part of the floor and not of a box containing the tablets. The tablets as shown in Mackenzie's daybook cover the two gypsum slabs (an area of one metre) and some were found near the entrance to the GPR. If they were all originally together, it is possible that they had fallen from a floor above; if, however, the ones found near the GPR entrance were kept elsewhere, the main group could have fallen from a box, a shelf or a cupboard situated at ground floor level. The gypsum slab, under which they were found (as Mackenzie recorded), may have fallen from the adjacent disintegrating N wall, though this consists of burnt gypsum slabs. What is important is that the excavators recorded that the tablets were found above the floor,100 meaning the gypsum floor, contrary to modern ideas, which place the tablets at floor level.101 This may imply that there was another floor above the 93 Evans 1921, 442, fig. 318 which must have been taken later than 1900 since the W wall of the EPC has been restored. 94 Evans 1899-1900, 28. 95 Evans 1921, 442, legend of fig. 318. 96 Evans 1928, 352, fig. 200; Alexiou 1969, 174. 97 Evans 1921, 211; see also Shaw 1Q73, 21-2. 98 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 2 May and sketch 39; Evans (AE/NB 1900, 2 May) wrote: 'This morning a find of tablets occurred in the NE corner of the Room of the Column Bases.

In the same publication Evans also speaks of sealings - 'two of the clay seals with which the chest itself had been secured', but Gill (1965, 73) wrote that Evans made a mistake in confusing two locations. She must be correct since sealings were not mentioned in the diaries. 99 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 2 May sketch 39. 100 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 2 May '. . .

Under the last one the gypsum has been protected from weathering and, as a result, stands a little raised today. Some fragments can also be seen on the W end of the bench in PLATE 30. There may thus have been at least four pithoi in the LSS. The LSS has yielded many tablets (352). I05 Though the work of a single scribe (141),106 it has been strongly argued that they were produced by a sub-office set up in the LSS, which was part of a much larger administrative department, located in the West Wing, and also heavily involved in handling honey and aromatic spices. Like other sectors of the Linear B administration at Knossos, this one carried out its work on the system of 'receipts and disbursements'. The clues to this are most clearly set out in the vocabulary employed: deliveries acknowledged (a-pu-do-si: Fh 340, 349, 366) and debts owed (qe-te-o: Fh 348). I07 The material being handled is olive oil: some distinguished as being of a second pressing (ie. inferior quality, zo-a: Fh 343, 355, 369), others have some function indicated, mostly not now comprehended (e-pi-ko-wa: for Panointing, Fh 343; po-ro-ko-wa: for ?pouring, Fh 350; to-ro-qa: for Pconsumption, Fh 358; and e-te-ja: use unknown, Fh 359). Most may be assumed to be of normal quality, possibly some younger material is indicated in 'new' (Fh 362, 375). The amounts are at times considerable, a few tablets recording grand or sub-totals (Fh 366, 367). Some fall into recognizable groups: to male persons (in the dative, not usually seen elsewhere in the corpus: Fh 342, 344, 355) or professions (bronzesmiths: Fh 386); to places (with -de suffix: Fh 351, 353, and 357); and most importantly to what are considered as deities (in the dative, Fh 356, 390). Io8 Ethnic groupings are very rare (Fh 392). It is felt that these allocations are in the form of rations to the listed males, offerings to the gods; the significance of the findspots is not understood. Often the quantities concerned with the last are considerable (Fh 340, 349). One particular set (Fh 347, 361, 371, and 372) concerns ku-pi-ri-jo. The balance of opinion tends to make this person, in conjunction with evidence from elsewhere in the department, a professional perfumemaker. Foster109 and Melena110 have suggested that a workshop was connected to a shrine somewhere in Knossos, an interesting theory for this piece of work (see the VR Chapter). Evans included111 here a dozen tablets of a more assorted nature (395-8, 409-14) as well as a series of illegible fragments (399-407). Olivier and Palmer112 have placed most of them with the House Tablets set and Magazine 4; only 408 is left. To this, on the other hand, they add 733 and ?872. Nearer the door into the GPR come more pieces (Fh 408, C 394 and ?K 872): the first is a receipt, the second is connected with a series of individual sheep, probably offerings and allocations, whilst the last (if not from elsewhere)"3 inventories a series of metal vases (3 bull's head rhyta, 3 PVapheio cups) with precious metal trimmings and other decorative traits.

Their presence in such rooms may hold some clues to the state of the palace in its last phase, already discussed by Popham.115 The tablets, whether they were stored in the room or had fallen from above, again present a picture not alien to this last epoch of the palace. The incomings and outgoings of goods such as oil may point to cult activities, in the form of offerings arriving at the Sanctuary area, and then amounts of it being allotted to other areas or sanctuaries. Hallager's"6 picture of the room with a scribe sitting and recording on the tablets does not appear unreasonable, if the tablets were indeed kept in this room. THE NE UNIT The NE Unit is entered through a door at the W end of the N wall of the LSS (FIG. 50; PLATE 3°)- The Great Pithos Room (GPR): 33 The GPR has taken its name from a large pithos, still in situ (PLATES 30, 34, 35 ¿), found on 26 April,"7 the first day of excavation in the room; it was accompanied by the remains of seven others. The next day a false-necked amphora came to light"8 and the following day the floor of slabs was cleared and a piece of lead sheet and the stand of a stone lamp were found."9 On 30 April a rectangular sinking was located.120 It is a small, rectangular, narrow room. The S wall is the N wall of the LSS. The N wall divides the GPR from the TR and is a thin rubble wall, with its E end abutting onto the E wall, its upper courses cut into the E wall for better bonding. It is possible that the N wall is a later addition.121 This observation is further substantiated by the fact that the W end of the same wall sits on part of the threshold into the TRR, and some of the gypsum floor slabs seem to continue under the wall at its E end. The E wall is formed by the original façade wall along the CC (see Two Façades section below). The lower two or three courses are well built with limestone blocks and smaller stones. There are two well-dressed limestone blocks neatly positioned side by side with their tops at the same level (PLATE 35 a). Above them the wall continues to be neatly constructed, though on top there are two large gypsum blocks with 114 Evans 1935, fig. 877. 115 Popham 1987, 298. 116 Hallager 1987, 172. 117 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 26 April) recorded: 'In room 2 came into view about opposite the middle of the N. wall a very large handsome pithos - the ornamentation in relief being a sort of [illegible word] arrangement with rope bands [illegible word] and triglyphs separated by horizontal bands in the shape of triple rows of impressed circles. To E and S were other pithoi standing or on their sides but all much collapsed. Judging from the large circumference and the amount already brought into view (1.30) the oithos must be of extraordinarv height'. 118 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 27 April) wrote: 'The room 33/2 with the large pithos has a doorway at the W end of its S wall. A little distance within the doorway was found on the floor 2.30 down on its side a false-necked amphora with brown-black horizontal bands in the usual ochre slip'. 119 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 April) wrote: 'The pithos room 33/2 has a flooring of slabs at a depth of 2.30 from the surface. This flooring is now in the course of being completely cleared. Including the large whole pithos the room had altogether 8 pithoi. At x were found a large piece of lead lining and the lower part (the stand) of a Mycenaean lamp in purple stone'. 120 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 30 April) recorded: 'In the pithos-room 34/2 just SE of the pithos a long rectangular slab-lined sinking in the floor was discovered probably having some function similar to that of the two in the E pillar room 34/1. The floor of the pithos-room was completely freed of deposit and swept.

The W wall, shared by both this room and the TRR, contains reused blocks of gypsum, including some with masons' marks: a curved star and another with a handleless trident.122 A vertical beam slot stands at the midpoint of the wall, which falls at the side of the opening dividing this room from the TRR. This may support the argument that advantage was being taken of the chance to combine a structural member with a door frame. The floor visible today consists of gypsum slabs at the same level as the original slabs in front of the bench in the LSS; they are all blackened and burnt the same way (PLATE 35 b). The part of the floor W of the Great Pithos is heavily repaired with modern concrete, the result of the trenches opened by Evans (see Chapter 2). Along the W, N and E walls there are traces of a plaster or gypsum dado (PLATES 34 a-b' 35 a-b' 36 a-b). There are also traces of a plaster12^ floor evident, above the gypsum floor slabs, along the edges of the walls (often preserved in the bottom corners of the walls), and particularly behind the Great Pithos (PLATE 122 Hood (forthcoming) Cat. Nos: 467, 468; I thank warmly Mr S. Hood for the catalogue numbers of the mason's marks found in the CPS which he uses in his book. 123 On plasters see Shaw 1973, 207-21 n.3; I thank Dr M. Durkin for looking at the plasters in the CPS; the remains in the GPR and the TRR may be gypsum based rather than lime - analyses are in progress.</page><page sequence="227">212 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS 35 b). Even the interstices of the gypsum floor slabs at the NE corner of the room are filled with the same plaster. These remains of the plaster floor were missed by Mackenzie; Evans124 recorded 'stucco' in his notes but he did not mention it in his publications until 1935.125 Fyfe126 noted 'Door-jamb broad plaster step' where the gypsum door-jamb bases of the door leading into the GPR from the LSS are (FIG. 51). This plaster floor must have belonged to the last phases of the CPS, and probably corresponds in date to a series of such floors or layers of floors found in the Throne Room area.127 Similar floors were found at the SW House.128 The difference is that, unlike the plaster floors mentioned above, this one does not have a surface, but looks like a solid mass on the gypsum slabs. Was it an isolated case, or did more rooms have such floors, as suggested by Mirie?129 This question cannot be fully answered now. But there are probable traces of such floors in the TRR and in the EPC. Since the burnt gypsum slabs of the GPR and the threshold of the door connecting the GPR to the LSS were all covered with plaster, one wonders whether the similarly burnt gypsum slabs in the LSS were too. This plaster 'floor' explains the difference in level given by Fyfe (FIG. 46) in 1900 and in 1904 (FIG. 50) between the floor of the GPR (at depth -37 or 1. 12) at a higher level, and that of the LSS (at -41 or 1.16). DriessenI3° mistakenly applied the floor level of the GPR, on which a stirrup jar was found (at depth -2.30 m), to that of the LSS and, naturally, found a discrepancy of 0.11 m. Mirie131 also found a discrepancy of 0.18 m between Fyfe's and Mackenzie's measurements, which can also be explained by the plaster floor, the thickness of which varies. Lighting. The only wall that could have a window is the E wall; the two neatly set limestone blocks have their tops at roughly the same level, giving the impression of a window sill (PLATE 35 a). Driessen132 accordingly placed a window in this wall, which would make good sense if the two well-dressed blocks were at a higher level. As they are now they look too low for a window sill to go with the present height of the gypsum or plaster floor, but they could have been at the right height to go with the earliest plaster floor, at 0.30 m lower (see the Phasing section). A large block of gypsum now sits on them, which, if in situ, disposes of the idea of a window in the last phase. Furniture. In the middle of the room and just S of the Pithos there is a rectangular cist133 (FIGS. 61; 62). A lead sheet (360), recorded in the diaries, might have been used to line it134 although its exact location and size seem open to dispute. The top of the cist is lower than the surrounding floor slabs; it is not clear whether this was intended, or if it went with an earlier floor (see Phasing Section). I24 Evans (AE/NB 1900, 27 April, vol. 32, p. 53) wrote: 'lines on stucco at W end of this room like scores of an account no real letters'; 'stucco' may refer to the dado along the W wall or to the plaster floor. The 'lines' are not visible now. 125 Evans 1935, 635. I26Fyfe/SkB 1901, 112.

Eight pithoi (353, 354 a-d, 355 a-d), were recorded by Mackenzie and Evans135 none of which was published, with the exception of the Medallion Pithos that still remains in situ (PLATES 34 a-b' 35 a-b). Five are shown in FIGS. 61-2. Fragments of 16 large pithoi were found in a box stored in Rooms A and B with the label 'Room of the Tall Pithos'.136 It is possible that pithos fragments from the LSS and the EPC were included in this box since the GPR could have held eight pithoi, but is too small for 17 (Great Pithos included). It is impossible now to identify which belong to which room, and it is only hoped that they all come from the CPS. All the pithoi seem to have been decorated (perhaps not as elaborately as the medallion pithos) in low relief: horizontal or wavy bands with plait-work or crosshatching and horizontal or wavy ropes (FIG. 42). Similar pithoi are found in the Magazines.137 Evans wrote that although the pithos was found to be sitting on a MM III floor it bears no certain MM III characteristics; he went on to say that its 'tall, upright, . . . narrow contour . . . anticipates a prevailing characteristic of vessels of early L.M. la date5.138 Its rim profile was seen as 'common to the usual type of "Medallion" pithoi'; further below, however, Evans wrote 'it seems best to regard this tall jar as contemporary with the others', meaning the other seven pithoi in the GPR. About these Evans said (loc. cit.) that they were found 'on the upper, plastered, floor-level' and are 'of a late class'. Consequently, Evans was uncertain about the date of this pithos but it seems that it has characteristics which are closer to LM Ia or even later pithoi.139 The fact that it is sitting on an earlier floor does not make it contemporary with that floor. It could have been placed in a deliberately created hole for better stability.140 The 'typical Late Palace pithoi' Evans considered as LM Ib- II, but they could be later. A stirrup jar (356) I41 was found, but beyond the fact that it had bands, no description was provided to help date or find it. Driessen142 gave it a LM IIIb date but since we have never seen the vase, it is best to leave its date open.143 A lamp foot of purple stone (357), I44 was mentioned but again it has not been found. Evans wrote that both the stirrup jar and the lamp were found 'above the upper floor' meaning the upper plaster floor.145 This could suggest that they had fallen from above. However, Mackenzie reported that the stirrup jar was found 'on the floor at a depth of 2.30 down'146 and the lamp was recorded (one day later) together with the discovery of the cist, refuting, thus, the idea of their coming from the upper floor.147 135 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 April) wrote about the pithos room 'this flooring is now in course of being completely cleared. Including the large whole pithos, the room had altogether eight pithoi'. On 30th April, he wrote 'the floor of the pithos room was completely freed of deposit and swept. Four of the broken pithoi were for the time being left in their places'. Evans (AE/NB 1900, 53) commented on the same pithoi: 'in a chamber N of the Chariot room an enormous Pithos was found 1.45m high, 85 diam at top, about .70 at bottom. Two handles inside pithos at 0.65 from rim'. Also Evans 1899-1900, 28-q and 103e;, 6^-5, fie. 622. 136 The fragments were found by the author; they have been studied by Dr K. Christakis who has identified 16 different pithoi on the basis of decoration and clay type. I3? Evans 1935, fig. 625a,b, pls. LVII, LIXa,b. 138 Evans ioc^, 634-5. 139 My sincere gratitude to Dr K. Christakis for discussing this as well as the other pithoi of the area. They will appear in greater detail in a forthcoming joint publication. 140 At least one more pithos from the same room is of similar height, but it has not been recorded whether more pithoi had been sitting on the earlier floor. 141 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 27 April) wrote: 'A little distance within the doorway was found on the floor 2.30 down, on its side, a false-necked amphora with brown-black horizontal bands in the usual ochre slip'. Again two days later, 30 April, Evans reported AE/ NB '. . . and just inside the doorway a large b.kanne'.

Also recorded was a piece of lead lining (360). I5° Function. The number of pithoi found in the room point to storage;151 little space must have been left free to move about. The function of the cist also may have been that of storage, or to collect spills. The fact that a hole in the lower S side of the Great Pithos (opened by drilling into the pithos when dry, and placed much higher in its body than is usual)152 is aligned with the cist, may show that there was some connection intended between the two. A purpose that was perhaps decided after the pithos was placed in the room, and hence its perforation. The Temple Repositories Room (TRR): 34 The room took its first name, 'Room of the Two Cists',153 from the two later cists sunk in the ground (FIGS. 51; 56 left; PLATE 37 a); the name I use here comes from the two large Repositories found under the gypsum floor154 (PLATE 24). The room was excavated in 1901.155 It is a small rectangular room entered from the GPR by the N-S passageway corresponding to the W side of the GPR. The walls survive well, the N and W to a great height. The S wall divides the room from the GPR, and the W and E walls are shared with it. The S wall contains, in its W section, a small reused gypsum block with a finely carved double axe.156 Evans mentioned also 'white-faced stucco' with 'stripes of red below and above, forming a kind of dado and cornice band similar to that of the Magazines and Long Corridor'.157 The N wall contains many reused gypsum blocks, one with large dowel holes. A patch of mud plaster is preserved near the NW corner. The E wall contains two further well dressed blocks, at the same level as the two already mentioned in the E wall of the GPR, but set widely apart. A trident is found at the S end of the E wall. An interesting feature is a gypsum block projecting by 0.20 m at the foot of the W wall; it certainly could not have been hidden by any dado or plaster. A similar effect can be encountered occasionally in the rooms behind the Throne Room (Rooms 44a, 48), and may mark a slight carelessness in construction, when they attempted to reinforce the wall.158 Under this particular block, however, a vertical gypsum slab is partly visible, with a horizontal one adjacent and extending w. The purpose of these slabs is not evident and they cannot be investigated since they are under the wall. They could, however, be the remains of a gypsum floor and dado, or a threshold, or even part of a cist hidden under the projecting gypsum block, which was perhaps placed over it in order to conceal it. It is also possible that the block was used to block a door connecting the TRR with the VR. At the time of the excavation the room was covered with a gypsum floor,159 which was sacrificed in the excavation of the TR (PLATE 37 a). Traces of this floor survive along the N, W and S walls; it is at a higher level than the gypsum floor in the GPR. Along the W wall there is 148 The sealing fragment according to Gill (1965, 71) is the fragment depicting the 'upper part of an attendant'.. 149 Olivier 1967, 22. 150 On lead lining see Wiener iqqi, 320. 151 On Minoan storerooms see Begg 1975. 152 I thank Dr K.

A thin layer of red soil or clay exists under the remains of the later gypsum floor along the E part of the S wall. Along the W part of the S wall of the room the remains of a plaster or gypsum (not clear which) floor and dado were found over the gypsum floor during the recent cleaning. The plaster or gypsum is of the same kind as that in the GPR.l6° This floor and dado must have been noticed by the excavators, although they never mentioned it, since they have restored part of the dado along the wall in modern concrete. The threshold between the TRR and the GPR is positioned at a higher level than the floor in the GPR, but lies at the same level as the gypsum floor in the TRR (PLATE 37 a). It consists of two gypsum slabs, the smaller E one (partly set under the S wall), contains two dowel holes for the wooden frame of the opening to be fixed. A trench between the threshold and the W Repository, probably opened by Evans, was located and cleaned by the author. At the bottom of the trench are two limestone slabs which are at the appropriate level to have gone with the TR, had they been the remains of an original floor.161 More investigation is needed in and around this region before anything more positive is said. A large piece of red clay was found placed against the S wall of the WTR, evident in the above-mentioned trial trench. Lighting. No windows were detected in the TRR. If there was a window, it would have been on the E wall. Furniture. The smaller cists (FIGS. 51, 56 left; PLATE 37 a) only are examined here. The two large ones that comprise the Temple Repositories proper have been dealt with in the relevant chapter and more details are to be found in the Catalogue (see FIGS. 55, 56 right, 63-4). Today only one of the two small cists, the easternmost, survives; it lies between the two large ones. The other, slightly larger, was removed in the course of excavating the West Repository, in whose SE corner it lay. Both consisted of gypsum slabs, arranged to form the base and sides of the cist; the ends of their longer sides were allowed to project. Though today the sides quite obviously protrude, this does not seem to have been so in relation to the contemporary (now removed) floor at least in the case of the surviving one. Plate 37 al62 shows that they both had recesses made at the tops of their sides to receive a lid. According to Mackenzie,163 these were used as oil vats. Unfortunately, Evans has not given a full description of the missing cist, nor of its relation to the larger WTR in which it was sitting. From drawings,164 it can be estimated that the missing cist had a depth of at least 0.30 m and thus must have impinged a little on the filling of the TR below. The remaining cist situated between the two TR fits so exactly that it must have been constructed at the time, when the TR beneath was covered by the later gypsum floor. 160 I thank Dr M. Durkin for looking at this material for me. 161 They seem to be at the same level as the earlier plaster floor in the GPR. 162 Evans 1902-3, 39, fig. 19. l63 Evans (1900-1, 27): 'at 1.30 m. down was a deposit of burnt wood'; and Mackenzie (DM/DB 1903, 28 May, 86) wrote: '. . . having 2 oil cists set into the floor ... the 2 vats or oil receivers were grouped close together in the W half of the room'. Evans (1902-3, 39) reported: 'From the occurrence of two shallow superficial cists or stone vats in its pavement ... it seemed to have been used during the concluding period of the building for the storage of oil'. In 1 92 1, (464) Evans described the cists and compared them to the 'vats' constructed above the lower part of the original 'kaselles' of the magazines 'ex hypothesi, in the first Late Minoan Period'. He went on to say that they were probably receptacles for 'solid objects probably of ritual use. When considered in relation to the discovery of the more important cists below, it becomes evident, indeed, that they represented a religious survival'. Ib4 Evans 192 1, fig. 335b.</page><page sequence="234">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2ig Finds. A quantity of burnt wood was noted, which may have been from wooden boxes or the remains of the ceiling; also the tablet165 (359) that Olivier allocated to the GPR.166 There is some question as to whether some pithoi were found or whether Evansl6y was confused in asserting this. Function. The two cists in the middle of the room point to storage, particularly if they had a cover. The carbonized wood may suggest wooden boxes again used for storage. The fact that it is entered through the GPR by just walking along its W side may also indicate that both were storerooms. THE WEST UNIT The East Pillar Crypt (EPC): 30 The EPC, whose name was taken from its central pillar and its dark nature, is entered through two doors from the LSS. Only the S one was recognized in 1900, the N door being opened in 1901,168 which is why the earliest plans and photographs show only a single entrance (PLATE 32 a). Excavation started on 25 April when the pillar was discovered169 and continued on the 28th when the floor was cleared and the two sinkings on either side of the pillar appeared170 (FIG. 51). On 7 and 9 May the W side of the room, which consisted of large blocks out of position, was cleared and the actual W wall was found.171 It is a large square room with walls of rubble masonry with the occasional large gypsum block; one at the foot of the N wall (adjacent to the door leading into the RN) has strong traces of burning. The S wall is very thin compared to the other walls of the room and it does not contain gypsum blocks. A vertical beam slot is in the middle of the wall, with another one just before its E end by the southern door in the E wall. 165 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1901, 4 April) wrote: 'nothing has turned up in the deposit with the exception of 2 fragments of inscription tablets' ... At 1.30 down a deposit much impregnated with burnt wood appears'. On 6th April, he recorded: 'the only find was in the shape of two fragments (fitting) of an inscription; so far, however, there is not - as was expected - any deposit'. 166 Olivier (1967, 22, fig. on p. 21) assigns other tablets to the LSS. 167 Evans 1902-3, 38-9 referred to 'remains of some clay pithoi of the usual late character'; Mackenzie has not recorded anv pithoi. 168 Evans (1900-01, 27-8) stated that 'the doorway leading from the Hall of the Column Bases to the East Pillar Room was flanked by a second'; this statement does not imply that the door was blocked as Hallasrer suggested (1087, 176). 169 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 25 April) wrote 'W of where these column bases were found [meaning the LSS] the plan of a room can just be made out and about the centre of it apparently in position the gypsum-block of a square pillar (measuring .62 NS .55EW). On the E face is the typical sign [drawing of double axe] . The top of the block was at about .70-80 from the surface'. 170 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 April and sketch 34/1) reported 'The E pillar room 31/1 has now been excavated down to the flooring and this also is being completely cleared of deposit. There were altogether 10 pithoi in this room all collapsed but with the lower parts of 4 still in position. The flooring of this room was also at a depth of 2.30. The central pillar stood 1.82 high from the floor and consisted of 4 blocks all 4 blocks being inscribed with the double axe sign on the N, E and S sides. At the NW corner near the floor was found a large fragment of an inscription tablet. A curious feature has appeared in the flooring of this room first W and then E of the pillar in the shape of two rectangular stone-lined reservoirs coming up just to the floor level. Both are about .25 dep .80 E-W by 47 N-S and .80 by .w' 171 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 7 May and sketch 39) wrote 'The tumbled condition of the construction separating the E. from the W. pillar-room surmounted as it was by large blocks out of position and leaning strangely E made it seem unsafe and an attempt was made to shift the blocks to a more stable position W-wards. While this was being done, however, it became doubtful whether these blocks really formed a wall at all and whether the real wall, with communication between the E and W pillar-rooms would not be found to exist underneath'. And (9 May and sketch 48) 'The E and W pillar rooms have a much tumbled wall between them, mentioned in connection with the work for Monday 7th May, and in the process of getting fallen blocks into a more stable position we came upon the real wall running SN underneath with a doorway between the E and W pillar- rooms at its N. end at x'.</page><page sequence="235">220 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS IS tí &lt; bo fi 1 û "o I &lt;u s o fi g 1 ;!

A few of the original slabs, particularly at the W end of the room, have been covered with modern ones for protection. At the SW corner of the room a sounding made by Hutchinson and Platon was identified and partly excavated (see Chapter 2).173 Gypsum slabs became visible after removing a thick layer of sand and soil (PLATE 39 a). They lay at a lower level than the gypsum slabs of the latest floor by about 0.05-0.15 m (PLATE 39 b). According to Hutchinson and Platon they are the remains of an earlier floor. On cleaning them, however, they proved to be part of a partly destroyed structure with horizontal as well as vertical slabs, probably the remains of gypsum cists (PLATES 45 a-b). The pottery collected by Platon from under the E part of the horizontal slabs (from the burnt material) and the few sherds collected by me point to the Old Palace period as the possible period of their use. Along the base of the W wall is what looked like a rotten gypsum dado, partly covered by a thin layer of modern concrete and partly by dust (PLATE 39 a-b). Cleaning it during the recent excavation, I found that it is the remains of three consecutive parallel layers of wall plaster with a distance of about 1 cm from each other (PLATE 45 a-b). The earliest one (lying closest to the wall) is of almost pure white (backing) and has red paint on its surface. It curves outwards at the foot of the wall and covers part of the gypsum floor slab.174 The next one is a rather thick and crude pink plaster layer resting on the gypsum floor slab and cutting the red-faced plaster, which can be seen protruding under it at places. A third layer, of exactly the same nature as the second, exists now only in the middle of the wall. An incision on the floor slab,175 in line with this layer of plaster, confirms its existence along the wall to the gypsum door-jamb base of the door leading into the WPC.176 Finally from this door-jamb base running S to the middle of the wall an off-white layer of soft plaster spreads horizontally and extends E from the wall. It partly covers the three wall plaster layers (at places completely) (PLATE 45 b). This may be the remains of a plaster floor applied over the gypsum floor slabs covering the stumps of the wall plasters. Like the GPR plaster floor it does not have a surface. Although it is different in texture from that in the GPR (softer, a kouskouras-like mixture), it may be contemporary with it. It is certainly later than the gypsum paving and the three layers of wall plasters, since it covers them (see the Phasing Section below). Evans mentioned the existence of painted plaster on the walls of the EPC;177 it is possible that the red-faced plaster remains along the base of the W wall were part of the plaster Evans saw, although the bands he described cannot be traced now. Lighting. Although the walls survived to a great height no window was identified. The room was completely dark, one assumes, when the doors in the E wall were shut. Furniture. A square pillar178 of gypsum is set roughly in the centre of the room, as it now measures (FIG. 51; PLATE 38). It is built up of four solid, dressed blocks, burnt almost black by 172 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 April and sketch 34.1) wrote: 'The flooring of this room was also at a depth of 2.30'. 173 Cook 1946, 117; Hutchinson 1962, 165; Platon 1954, 433; Panagiotaki 1996, 39-40. 174 It extends about 10 cm from the wall onto the gypsum floor slab. I thank V Fotou for a discussion on wall and floor plasters. I?5 This incision defines the part of the slab under and protected by the plaster (the rest of the slab has swollen because of weathering). 176 This door-jamb base was investigated during the recent cleaning: its rabbet is on the E end; it consists of gypsum disintegrating into white powder; the concrete vertical door- jamb is sitting on it. 177 Evans (AE/NB 1909, 1910, book 38, 20) wrote: 'In Pillar R same bands at same height' meaning the same as in the West Magazines. 178 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 28 April.</page><page sequence="238">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 223 fire. The double-axe sign is cut 'on three sides of every block, namely to the N, E and S and again on the top'.179 The lowest part of the bottom block of the pillar is not visible; it is not, thus, known whether there is a separate base on which it sits,l8° and whether it went with the visible gypsum floor, or an earlier floor. On investigation around the NE corner of the pillar a base was not found, but small stones seemed wedged under it. It is, however, possible that the base slab was under the wedged stones; this could not be investigated.181 Only excavation can thus clarify whether the pillar went with the visible gypsum floor. To W and E of the pillar, a solid stone vat182 is set with its top just below the floor slabs; there is no evidence whether either had a cover (FIG. 51; PLATE 45 a-b). Evans183 was of the opinion that these vats were used 'for offerings' but this cannot be proved. The W vat, which was partly investigated during the recent excavation, is different from the vats in the VR; its height is far greater than one would imagine when seeing the depth of the vat's basin. What is clear is that the burnt gypsum structure (cists) at the SW corner of the room was earlier than the W vat, since part of it was destroyed when the vat was inserted. Finds. Mackenzie184 recorded 10 pithoi (364), and a single tablet (365). l85 Fyfel86 drew six pithoi in a sketch (FIG. 51). In PLATE 32 0, two or three are visible; one is near the southern entrance and most of its lower part has survived (in fragments). In PLATE 33 ¿, one more pithos is visible against the N wall. The pithoi have not been found, but they could be amongst those fragments assigned to the WPC (see below) or to the GPR. The fragments of the pithos near the southern entrance (PLATE 32 a) are not among those and this may suggest that the EPC pithoi are still to be located. The plaster floor remains along the W wall may have been associated with these pithoi. A small pithos (a 'pithoid jar') in the Ashmolean has been recorded as an EPC vase: part of the rim (364a, FIG. 40) and shoulder survive. It has an overall purple wash with fugitive white lilies spread below the rim. It is a typical light-on-dark MM IIIb vase, which may have been kept longer because of its elaborate decoration. The tablet187 365 (Uf 432) concerns a series of male names and what have been suggested to be details of land tenure. Function. Although the pillar with the double axes (and the vats on either side) has been associated with cult by many scholars,188 there is no evidence for cult activity in the last phase. 179 Evans (1899-1900, 32) wrote: 'The other pillar (meaning the one in the EPC) is marked in a similar way on three sides of every block, namely to the North, East and South and again on the top' also (AE/NB 1900, 53): 'In two chambers W of this area two pillars. In first or "East Pillar room" it is in centre i.78mh. .65 X 56 of 4 blocks. Here occurs most methodical arrangement of signs yet noted.' Today only four double axes survive, one on the S side and three more on the E side; the N side is too worn from the action of trickly rainwater. 180 Usually the lowest block of a pillar is supported by a thick slab or a block which may not have been intended to be visible. 181 A strip of rotten concrete of only about 7cm width and 20cm length was removed mainly at the NE angle of the nillar. 182 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 April) reported A curious feature was apparent in the flooring of this room first W and then E of the pillar in the shape of two rectangular stone lined reservoirs coming just to the floor level. Both are almost 25 cms. deep, 80 E-W X 47 N-S (and 80 X 53)'. Evans (1 899-1 900, 34) wrote that these 'vats' are the same as in the VR. However, the recent excavation showed that the vats in the VR are much shallower and cut out of a thinner block of stone. The technique of cutting them out from a solid block of stone is however shared. 183 Evans 1900-1, 28; also (AE/NB 1901, 30) wrote: 'The shallow basins on either side of E pillar not like the Kaselles - for offerings probably'. 184 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 May) wrote: 'there were altogether 10 pithoi in this room, all collapsed but with the lower parts of 4 still in position' and also that they 'belonged to the latest period of the later palace'. l85 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 May) wrote: 'at the NW corner near floor, large fragment of inscription tablet'. 186 Fyfe/SkB iqoi, 112. 187 Olivier 1067, 22. 188 Evans 1899-1900, 32-4; 1901; Nilsson 1950, 237; Platon 1954, 428-83; Rutkowski 1972, 42; Gesell 1985, 26-7.</page><page sequence="239">224 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS FlG. 60.

The series of wall plasters mentioned above can be taken as evidence of the differences in the social status and, therefore, the function of the EPC. The early white plaster with the red-painted surface, associated with the gypsum floor, certainly implies better days for the EPC than the two latest layers. The possible kouskouras-plaster floor would be contemporary with the plaster floor in the GPR and the TRR (but of inferior quality) and must have gone with the pithoi. SUB-UNITS I, II AND III i. The West Pillar Crypt (WPC): 29 Excavation started on 27 April when the pillar was found189 and continued on 28 April.190 The floor was reached on 30 April191 and was cleaned and described on 1 May.192 The wall dividing the E from the W Pillar Crypt was found on 7 and 9 May (see footnote in connection with EPC). In this large square room, all the walls except the S survived to a good height. The S wall is mostly reconstructed as contemporary photographs show; perhaps only 2 or 3 courses are genuine and even they could have been much reworked. The construction of this wall, like its continuation in the EPC, differs radically from all others in the CPS: it is thinner and composed of smaller pieces without any reused dressed blocks and also on a slightly different alignment, positioned to the N a little. The floor193 consists of a central square surrounded by a higher border zone (FIG. 53). The central square is composed of irregular gypsum slabs, now worn. Fragments survive at nearly all the corners and along the S side while cement repairs account for the remainder. The border zone consists of square or rectangular slabs of gypsum and limestone. A single slab makes up the entire S side. As a general rule the width of the border is 0.70-0.75 m. The exception is the S side at only 0.40 m. Elsewhere such pavements are always given a border of a consistent width.194 This discrepancy is significant; investigation shows that the S wall is built over the S part of the border slab, occupying about half of it (PLATE 42). The original position of this wall would have been c. 0.40 m S, and the N-S axis of the WPC would have been longer. The implication is that the corridor S of the Crypts did not originally exist (see Phasing Section). 189 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 27 April and sketch 33/1) wrote: 'At once a block of a square pillar .65 X .65 apparently in position was brought into view at .90-1 down. The block was exactly like the top-most block of the pillar in room 31/ 1 already referred to'. 190 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 28 April and sketch 34/3) recorded: 'The W pillar room 33/1 has been excavated so far to bring into view 3 blocks of its pillar'. 191 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 30 April) wrote: 'The W. pillar room 34/3 has just shown the flooring at a depth of 3 m. The pillar in the room has 4 blocks and stands 1.75 high. The blocks are .65 X .65. The double-axe sign appears on the different blocks on all 4 sides of the pillar. The pillar stands 2 m E of the W wall of the room and 1.40 S of the N wall'. 192 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 1 May and sketch 37/1). See n. 193. 193 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 30 April) 'The W pillar room 34/3 has just shown the flooring at a depth of 3m.' He continued on the next day, 1 May, 'The W pillar room . 1 . has been completely excavated and the floor swept. This is paved with slabs some of them of gypsum'. Evans (1900-1, 28) said of the same floor: 'On the other hand the floor round the West Pillar showed a regular border and central square like that of the Throne Room and indicating that in this case as in the other it had been adorned with varied colouring'. The 'colouring' is not evident now and only small fragments of the gypsum slabs survive. In his notes Evans (AE/NB 1901, 30) wrote: 'The sunk space for Ppainted floor round W Pillar gives it importance'. 194 See Throne Room, Evans 192 1, 907 and figs. 877, 879.</page><page sequence="241">226 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS FlG. 6i.

The main feature is the gypsum pillar (FIG. 53; PLATE 41). It is on much the same E-W axis as that in the EPC, and essentially of the same construction and material and adorned with the same double-axes.195 In relation to the sunken central square of the floor, the pillar stands slightly closer to the east, and definitely so to the north, instead of being at the true centre. This may suggest that the square may have been earlier than the pillar and covered during the life of the pillar with a plaster floor; the inconsistency in the width of the border zone around the square supports the same idea. Also the fact that the lower block of the pillar rests on a base block (PLATE 41 b) that projects out beyond its edges, clearest on the east (by some 0.13 m) and stands slightly higher than the floor (by 0.05-0.06 m) points to the same idea.196 It is thus possible that the pillar had been added to an earlier pavement arrangement, resembling that in the LSS and the Throne Room. The only difference is that the central part here is slightly sunk and consists of gypsum slabs. In relation to the present walls, the pillar lies almost exactly on the midpoint of the N-S axis, but obviously would not have done so with respect to the suggested original line of the S wall. Therefore, the positioning of the pillar and the building of the S wall in its present position may have had some connection. Evans197 placed the double axe signs on the two pillars in the earliest class. Hood,198 however, saw them as later and, as Niemeier1" has observed, they belong to Hood's 'intermediate set', which is between Evans's first and second group, and therefore belong to an early MM III date. The pillar, however, may have been placed in the WPC at a later stage. Against the eastern wall a bench has been entirely reconstructed by Platon and Hutchinson, who found a gypsum slab fragment against the S wall at the appropriate height;200 this has now been incorporated in the SE corner of the modern concrete top of the bench. As presently constructed the bench is narrower than others in the region. An early photograph shows an untidy mass of stones at the foot of this wall - it is possible that they could be part of the stone core of a bench, or alternatively they could be tumbled wall stones. Finds. 18 fragments, belonging to about six pithoi (one perhaps a 'pithoid jar'), were identified among the pithos fragments stored in Rooms A and B. A wooden label with them stated 'West Pillar Crypt'. However, neither in the daybooks and notebooks nor in the publications have pithoi been ascribed to the WPC. On the contrary, it was stressed that nothing was found there.201 These pithoi may thus be remains of the ten pithoi found in the EPC - 'West' may have been mistaken for 'East'. However, they are here treated as if they belong to the WPC for the following reasons: 195 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 30 April; Evans (1899-1900, 32) wrote: 'those of the W pillar show this sign repeated on every side of every block as well as on the upper face of the topmost stone - in all 17 times'. Today eight double axes survive: two on the E side, two on the S, one on the N and one on the W. I9(&gt; Time has caused the juncture of the lower block of the pillar and the base block to become obscured - one cannot tell if one or two pieces of stone are involved. 197 Evans (1921, 218) referred to the pillars as belonging to the 'earlier palace' . . . 'From the character of the incised marks and the other indications these Pillars must clearly be reckoned among the structures of the earlier palace'. In 1921, 425, he wrote: 'it is clear that the massive gypsum pillars of the two small chambers in the centre of this region (see Suppl. PI X) belong to the original Palace structure. The deeply incised double-axe signs on their blocks are themselves characteristic of the earlier class'. 198 Hood pers. comm. and 1987a, 205-10. 199 Niemeier IQQ4, 7Q. 200 My gratitude to the late Prof. N.

They look different from the pithos against the S wall of the EPC visible in PLATE 32 a; iii. Many of the pithoi are represented so poorly by sherds that it is possible that these sherds came from the fill and they do not represent pithoi standing on the floor of the WPC. They exhibit decoration in low relief: bands with incised decoration, and wavy ropes (FIG. 43). They seem to belong to the Late Palace period, LM III. Function. According to Evans202 the WPC was the shrine proper because it was found completely empty and the double axe sign was carved on all four sides. If, however, the pithos fragments recently identified belonged to it (361-3), they can be used to challenge Evans's idea - at least for its final phase of use. Moreover, access to it through the EPC would have been difficult because of the number of pithoi stored in it; I would therefore hesitate to single out this room as the shrine in the last phase. it. The Vat Room (VR): 31 Excavation was first reported on 3 May when the floor was reached203 and continued on the 4th when all the vats were revealed.204 The name is taken from a line of shallow stone vats along the E wall (FIGS. 46-7; 62). It is a small, rectangular room with rubble walls containing reused blocks of gypsum. At the N end of the W wall the impression of the horizontal wooden beam survives and there may also be part of a transverse beam. The floor consists of gypsum and of burnt schist slabs, suggesting either careless construction or two different phases.205 The schist slabs cover the N part (just S of the cist against the N wall) and are burnt; the gypsum slabs do not show traces of burning but are worn. In the middle there is a concrete patch in which Trench 1 was sunk in the recent excavation (PLATE 40). Lighting. Although the walls survive to a good height, no window was identified; the room may thus have been completely dark. Furniture. The cist at the N wall (PLATE 40). 2o6 This is created by setting into the floor a hollowed-out block of stone. Though Mackenzie described it as shallow, it is deeper than the series of vats. Its base (partly restored by Evans) slopes to the centre. At present the preserved S edge is lower than the surrounding floor; it may have been intended to receive a lid that would 202 Evans 1899- 1900, 34. 2°3 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 3 May) wrote: 'N of the E pillar room a room opens off N which is now in course of excavation to the floor which is at a depth of 2.60. At the foot of the N. wall were found in the floor in the NW angle a shallow rectangular sinking of gypsum slabs in the NE angle a circular sinking. Next this at the foot of the E wall again a square sinking. The floor is paved with slabs of gypsum and shist'. 2°4 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 4 May and sketch 42/1) recorded: 'The room opening out N of the E pillar-room 42/1 was completely excavated in the course of the fore- noon. At the foot of the N. wall it was mentioned that yesterday a rectangular shallow sinking and a circular one adjacent to it were found in the floor in the NW and NE corners of the room respectively. To-day 4 similar sinkings square in shape but with their W. sides all curved out-wards were brought into view running N-S along the foot of the E wall. A broken pithos in position was found sitting in the 2nd from the S. end of the room. This fact makes it probable that the sinkings were meant to receive the moisture and droppings of oil or wine contained in the pithoi'. 2°5 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 3 May) wrote: 'the floor is paved with slabs of gypsum and schist'.

However the NW corner and the E side are higher (the W side is cut off). The NW corner seems to be partly incorporated into the N wall of the room, and a stone at the base of the latter projects sufficiently to reach the inside line of the cist (NW). This suggests that the cist may have been there when the N wall of the room was built (see vats below). Along the E wall are five vats207 (each cut from a single stone block) of varying shapes and dimensions and all different from that at the N wall (FIGS. 46-7; 62; PLATE 40). The corners of the room are left free of vats, but they are covered with schist and gypsum slabs. The NE corner shows strong traces of burning, even under the fragmentary schist and gypsum slabs. The vat at the N end of the row is the largest, being square in its outline with a circular depression. The next two are also square with a square depression of less than usual depth (0.025 m)i tney giye tne impression that they are a pair. The next one is substantially complete too and of the same shape but deeper (0.14 m). The last vat to the S is essentially the same shape, though the W side of the hollow has hints of a curved line to it, which is less obvious on the previous vats. The last two vats also look like a pair. The fact that the W side of the vats curves may indicate that they were cut so to facilitate someone working on that side, or the in and out movement of something. They all appear to be made of material like that of the cist against the N wall. It may originally have been white/creamy, but now it is mostly dark grey/brown. Specialists ascribe this discolouration to their contact with fire, since only their tops and parts of their W sides are burnt. The burning of the vats and the soil at the NE corner suggest that it was an intense fire which may have caused their tops to break off (if their walls were higher) as probably happened with the cist against the N wall. In places the E wall stones seem almost to overlap the back of the vats. This and the fact that the N wall of the room sits on the burnt NE corner, suggest that the N and possibly the E walls were perhaps built after the destruction, by burning, of the vats and the cist. Finds. The base of a pithos (366) was set in one of the vats208 (FIGS. 51; 62) but it has not been found. Function. It is assumed that the vats went with the last phase of the room and were not covered by a floor. During the recent excavation, Trench 1 showed that there are Neolithic strata immediately under the gypsum floor, which were cut to receive the vats. The few pottery fragments collected from the trench that the Minoans had opened for the insertion of the vats belong to Warren's MM IIIb/LM Ia transition (see Chapter 2). Mackenzie was of the opinion that the vats were used as the bases for pithoi;209 he made no comments about the cist. Evans adopted this idea in the publications but it is significant that in his original notes210 he had seen them as 'oil or wine presses'. Since only the base of one pithos was found in one of the vats, while ten pithoi were found in the adjacent EPC (presumably all contemporary), it is possible that the vats were not used as bases for pithoi but for something else. This could be craft activity, such as cloth dyeing,211 wine or oil pressing, or processing oils,212 perhaps 2°7 Mackenzie DM/DB 1900, 4 May. 208 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1900, 4 May) recorded: 'a broken pithos in position was found sitting in the 2nd vat from the S end of the room.

The intense burning, in both the vats and the cist, might have been caused by burning oils.213 in. The North West Sub- Unit (NW) Almost nothing is learnt from the diaries or publications about the Rooms entered from the western door in the N wall of the EPC beyond the fact that they were excavated in 1900 (FIGS. 46-7; 52). A trench was opened at the centre of Room A, shown on the annotated plan FIG. 45 (see also PLATE 44 a). Room of the Miche: RN The RN, the first room entered, now looks rather different from how it appeared when first excavated (FIGS. 46-7). It got its name from a small E-W cross-wall that projected out from the W wall to near the E wall, dividing the long RN into two, of which the first portion encountered was little more than a niche in the view of the excavators.214 This internal structure has long since been swept away. The walls contain some reused blocks of gypsum two of which have mason's marks: a trident in the E part of the N wall,215 a window in the N part of the W wall,216 and a handleless trident at the top of the vertical beam slot of the E wall.217 In the door of the W wall there is a pair of double axes at the N side218 and a star at the S side.219 The E wall is almost as thick as the E façade wall. The impression of the wooden door frame survives on the w jamb of the door leading from the EPC. If a horizontal impression is that of the lintel, the door must have been very low. This does not agree with the door jambs which are the largest in the CPS. The floor is of soil mainly but the S part of the room (the space of the original Niche) is covered with schist slabs (FIGS. 51, 53). Lighting. The room is now completely dark; although the walls survived to a good height, no windows were traced. Furniture. A long, low stone bench runs along most of the E wall; it is made up from thick slabs. It is built so close to the wall that the wall plaster must have overlapped part of the bench as well. Finds. From the RN come seven seal impressions (367-72) identified and studied by Gill,220 and some tablets. Great confusion exists concerning the tablets (373): two areas called the Room of the Niche, seem to have become confounded by Evans.221 Palmer and Olivier produced a much smaller list of 5: 434-38. 222 They form an eclectic group and are little 213 Analyses of the vats are being scheduled and their use will be further examined in a forthcoming article. 214 Fyfe/SkB 1901; Evans 1899-1900, pl.

String impressions run along the horizontal axis; the seal was pressed into one surface. Because of their nature they tell nothing of the object sealed. All of the designs depict animals; most have been endorsed or countermarked. One belongs to Younger's Animals with Dot- Feet'.2^ Function. It is not clear whether these finds belonged to the niche or had fallen from above. The finds do not point to the function of the room since we do not know their relationship to it. Room A A door in the W wall of the RN leads into a corridor-like space, the continuation of which W is Room A, while its continuation N forms a cupboard-like space (FIG. 52). A door W leads into Room B. None of the entrances has jamb bases but all of them are formed by large well- dressed gypsum blocks (pier-head construction), some of which bear finely carved mason's marks: two stars and two double axes on the N blocks of the W wall224 and two pairs of branches and stars on the S;225 a window exists in the S part of the E wall.226 The entrance into Room A is in no way emphasized and no evidence for a door exists. The walls are restored to a great height; they are of rubble, but the S wall (the N wall of the WPC) is neatly constructed, making use of many sizeable blocks in a careful, coursed effect. In no other wall in the CPS are so many gypsum blocks reused. Many of the blocks have mason's marks: 3 double axes,227 carved very deeply, a sign that they are of the earliest type,228 and a branch.229 The W wall has the remains of a vertical wooden beam (carbonized) at its centre; the size of the wall (the width of the room) is so small that it is striking that there was need for a wooden beam. It may be the remains of a blocked door (i.e. one of the vertical wooden beams of the door-jambs). The way the wall has collapsed (from the beam extending N, PLATE 43 a) could point to the same conclusion, but as far as can be seen, no second corresponding vertical beam seems to exist. The floor is of gypsum slabs previously undetected or not recorded; they are laid rather hastily and covered partly by a red, perhaps burnt soil (PLAN I; PLATE 43 b). Their upper surfaces are very worn. The slabs are unusually small, particularly near the W, where there is also an almost square space free of slabs; this may be a trial trench opened by Evans and not recorded. A schist slab over it (at a higher level than the gypsum slabs) and another one standing against the N wall nearby may have been part of the same or a later floor. The gypsum floor slabs are positioned lower than they should, regarding the walls, but the way they are laid, in a line along the N wall and partly so along the S wall, suggests that they go with the present walls. It is possible that the area was completely cut down to the Neolithic strata before the slabs were laid, as among them the soil seems to be Neolithic. Moreover, a 223 Younger iq8q. ^8.

The room may have been completely dark as no windows have been identified. Furniture. There is no furniture recorded in the room. Finds. No finds have been recorded. Function. The dark and cool nature of the room make it suitable for storage; as no pithoi were found, the room may have been used to store perishable goods (see Room B below). Room B Entrance is gained through an opening, which was not immediately recognized by the excavators.231 The room was given neither a name by Evans nor a number by Hood. The walls have lost most of their stone-binding mud plaster and as a result they need consolidation badly. The N wall contains one vertical gypsum block which resembles a door orthostat; it is possible that there is a blocked door here, leading to the rooms to the N. The remains of a horizontal and a vertical beam survive; the mud plaster shows that at least one side of the horizontal beam was curved, created by a timber, which was not squared (PLATE 44 b). A possible blocked door could also exist in the N part of the W wall. It would have lead into the West Magazines.232 The floor is of earth. At the SE corner there are a few gypsum slabs, perhaps the remains of a gypsum floor. At the NW and NE corners there are square depressions found with a gypsum slab each. Their meaning is not clear but they could have been the supports for vertical wooden beams used as supports for a light roof that would allow light and air into the lightwell. A trial trench was opened by Evans before the discovery of the Temple Repositories as is shown in FIG. 45 but nothing more is known about it. The trench lines were uncovered during cleaning by the author (PLATE 44 a). Lighting. The room is completely dark; despite the fact that the walls survived to a great height, no window was detected. Furniture. No furniture exists. Finds. No finds have been recorded. Function. Rooms A and B are both dark and cool and they could be ideal for storing perishable goods. The small cupboard-like space between Room B and the RN also supports this idea. Alternatively, this small space could have been used to accommodate a trap-door which would have connected Rooms A and B with the floor above. THE E-W CORRIDOR, SOUTH OF THE CRYPTS The S wall contains many reused blocks of gypsum - it is typical of all the rubble ones in the area that employ reused material. The N wall, on the other hand, is different:233 it is the S wall 230 They were lifted by the author during the recent excavation - permission granted by the authorities of Heraklion Museum; they will be published with the other finds of the 1995 excavation. 231 The opening is indicated by hatch marks in the plans of Fyfe, in Evans 1 899-1900, pl. XIII. 232 Evans (1900-1, 49) talked of a doorway that led 'directly from the Long Gallery to a somewhat complicated group of small chambers north of the Pillar Rooms'. 233 The fact that it does not contain reused gypsum blocks may indicate either that it was not built during the great campaign (when a lot of these were included), or that, being so thin, such massive blocks were simply not considered necessary.</page><page sequence="250">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2g5 of the E and WPC. A long, tall limestone block is set at the base of the N wall roughly at its midpoint and projects out into the corridor. A square dowel hole on the upper surface at each end of the block suggests that maybe it was used as the base for some construction made of wood. Its height and length suggest that it could not have been used as a door-jamb base. The corridor is paved with gypsum slabs. Those to the E are larger and more rectangular in comparison with the irregular pieces to the W. The orientation of the slabs varies, near the E end they are in pairs placed on an E-W axis, while near the W end they are on a N-S orientation. Some may be replacements. The date of the creation of the corridor is not evident from the architecture alone. The fact that its S wall contained many reused gypsum blocks suggests that it was built or rebuilt during the major rebuilding campaign when most walls were affected. The N wall, however, must have been built later. It is not clear either if the S wall of the corridor was also the original S wall of the Pillar Crypts (see Phasing Section). THE TRIPARTITE SHRINE (TS): 35 The N wing of the TS (D) is a niche formed by the Stylobate to the east, the E wall of the TR and the GPR to the west, the S load bearing wall of the E-W staircase to the north, and by the gypsum block of the recess in the LSS to the south (FIGS. 50-1; 58). A series of what can be called floors are seen: most of the space is covered by irregular amygdalopetra slabs (the mosaiko floor), some of which look like modern replacements; one towards the N part has a round, shallow depression, like a door socket. It may be a reused slab, as a door in that spot would make no sense. A line of smaller, rounded slabs are at a slightly lower level and run along, as well as partly under, a large gypsum block in the W wall. These may be the remains of an earlier floor, or the block was placed in this position later than the floor, or it was moved by the excavators and hence appears to sit on the slabs. The N part is covered with limestone slabs at a higher level, while the NE corner is covered by slabs and stones at the level of the 'stylobate'. These last look modern, but on what evidence were they reconstructed? We cannot answer now since in the records, two floors are mentioned, one of the mosaiko slabs, and another one of cement.234 The S wing is the space N of the staircase in the LSS, already described, while the central part cannot be described in the same way, since it is conjectural. Although the area of the TS was excavated in 1901, no interpretation was made, apart from a sketch produced by Fyfe, in which he drew three circular annotated marks, 'marks as of column bases', on the 'stylobate' (FIG. 51). Evans235 obviously had not seen Fyfe's sketch and almost ten years later he noticed what he called the 'clearly defined disks' of the column bases, still blackened by their burnt wood, after they had been brought out by the effects of rain (FIG. 58). As the 'stylobate' looks today (see PLAN i), in front of the recess D, east of the GPR (the N wing of the TS), are two circular features. That to the north is slightly raised in relation to the stone surface immediately around it, but no more than other areas a little further off in the 234 Evans 1900-1, 28; 1928, 804, 808; in his notes Evans (AE/NB 1913, 19) wrote: 'Red Pstamped cement pavement and layer of ashes above it and sealings of Goddess with ?[ ] wing. Earlier C. Court pavement below this . .'. 235 Evans 1909, 292-3; 191 1, 290-5; also 1928, 804: 'in the left wing of the section of stylobate in question there appeared clearly defined discs representing the lower ends of wooden columns, some traces of their carbonization showing in their partially blackened surfaces'.</page><page sequence="251">236 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS same block, where sub-circular forms are most probably natural features. Indeed, contrary to Evans's original observation, it is the rest of the stone that now appears fire-blackened while the circular feature is paler. Both look regular enough in form, size and spacing, being positioned on the same axis in relation to the front of the block, but not at its centre, which would be more natural. Evans further identified two more circular features (the S wing of the TS) at the end of the same stretch of the 'stylobate' just by the entrance marked by the staircase into the LSS. These are far harder to trace with any degree of certainty. They appear on a single block, their position is indicated by part of an arc at the E side of the block and they are again of roughly the same size and position. Further along the same 'stylobate', nearer the SW corner of the Central Court, similar effects are to be seen on some other blocks. Evans never specifically argued for further columns there, however. The central portion of the TS cannot be identified in any such manner, though it is noticeable that its position would lie on the sizeable limestone block, already described, that projects into the recess at the NE corner of the LSS (FIGS. 50-1; 58-9). This positioning may not be accidental, especially if one bears in mind the marks and cuts made on the block. Maybe these were deliberately positioned to support something, but that it was a Tripartite Shrine cannot be proven by that fact alone. Immediately adjacent to the projecting block, N, there is a small block in line with the gypsum block (and in the same E-W direction, unlike the others which are directed N-S), which has its E and partly its W side rounded (PLAN i). It was this block which Fyfe saw and recorded as a circle, on the same line as the two circles at the N part of the TS. It is, thus, clear that this third circle falls at the spot where Evans placed the N wall of the cellar of the TS (FIGS. 58-9) and not what he calls in FIG. 58 'probable central column at higher level'. If the circle noted by Fyfe is the impression of a column base, it completely undermines Evans's reconstruction of the TS. Concerning the interior of the TS, little can be reconstructed. As it presently stands, the floor level immediately behind the proposed façade-line differs greatly between the N portion, where the mosaiko pavement is preserved but a few centimetres below the CC, and the southern, where the gypsum paving of the LSS is about a metre lower. It is, thus, difficult to visualize what these two wings looked like. Evans felt they were probably open, as in the representation of the shrine on the Miniature fresco at Knossos,236 and again - less clearly - in the mountain-top shrine on the Zakro rhyton.237 Evans further envisaged238 some kind of display of cult objects in the recess in the LSS, visible to people seated on the bench or balustrade by the stairs. The evidence for positioning the columns on the 'stylobate' blocks can be challenged. This is not solely because the marks today are barely distinguishable from their surroundings, but, more tellingly, such construction of a colonnade would be unique in Minoan architecture, as Shaw has pointed out.239 He said that instead of setting separate bases for the columns 236 Evans 1028, 808. 237 Platon 1 971, 163-9; Shaw 1978, 431. 238 Evans (1928, 808) recorded: 'the southern wing, on the other hand, bordered a square open area about 2 mtrs. in depth and breadth, on the left side of which, with its back against the descending steps of the entrance passage, was a stone bench, facing, on the other side of the area, the nook representing the lower part of the Cella, in which sacred objects may well have been displayed. These would thus have been in full view of persons seated on the bench opposite'. 239 Shaw (1973, 114 n.3) wrote: 'The slabs of soft stone used for stylobates by the Minoans could hardly have withstood the strain of the columns. The only instance of which I know where the term 'stylobate' can be accurately applied in the sense used in Classical Archaeology is at Knossos, where apparently four columns of the Tripartite Shrine rested on a series of slabs alongside the Central Court . . .' On typical column bases and stylobates see Shaw 1973, m-23, figs. 128-52.</page><page sequence="252">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2gy surrounded by the slabs of the 'stylobate', the builders created slightly raised disks on the 'stylobate' slabs themselves 'by chiselling off the upper surface of the slabs around where the columns were to be set'.240 But such chiselling is not obvious now. Though observing the uniqueness of the situation, Shaw accepted the reconstruction proposed by Evans as 'correct in its essentials'. He cautioned that the scene in the fresco depicting a TS 'should not necessarily be considered evidence that the performance was taking place within the Central Court at Knossos'. Hallager241 argued that no TS existed in the last phase of the palace's existence. His position rests on the fact that there were no horns-of-consecration retrieved in the excavation. He found their absence particularly significant since the paving of the CC has survived in the area, with the implication that little disturbance had occurred there. However, it should be remembered that the walls of the CPS survived almost to ceiling height only by virtue of being basement rooms; any upper walls or crowning architectural embellishments would have disappeared,242 irrespective of the condition of the Court's pavement. One cannot therefore judge for or against the existence of a TS merely on the presence or absence of horns-of-consecration. As things are the 'stylobate' could not support the heavy structure presented in Evans's reconstruction, since there are no proper column bases. (Unless the column bases found in the LSS were originally positioned on the 'stylobate'; they, however, are wider than the 'stylobate' slabs and therefore unlikely to have been positioned on it.) Three points might undermine the theory of a TS as presented by Evans: i. The fact that there are no separate column bases set in the 'stylobate' as is usual, ii. The circles noticed by Fyfe, one of which falls at the spot where Evans placed the N wall of the cellar of the shrine, and iii. The difference in the floor level of the N and S part of the TS. Moreover, the circular marks are not as regularly arranged as shown on the plans and they are too close to each other to carry columns. Such marks could have been created by any circular object placed accidentally or on purpose on the 'stylobate', because of the protection the round object would provide to the spot. An example can be found in the LSS, east of the bench, where there is a pithos base sitting on a gypsum floor slab: the spot under the pithos base now looks like a column base. Another instance is in the Royal Villa,243 where a stone lamp stood on one of the steps of a small flight leading to the W section of the Main Hall. The three round marks of the 'stylobate' originally noticed by Fyfe could, thus, be the result of stone or clay pots positioned there. A lighter structure, of the sort that Evans described in the fresco as 'largely composed of wood and painted plaster . . . the columns and capitals were of wood',244 might have been possible. Hägg also saw the TS as simply a façade,245 and even Evans envisaged the wings as open.246 In this manner a Shrine is possible, of a kind not conforming with the architectural 240 Shaw 1978,431. 241 Hallager (1987, 169-71) wrote: 'the Tripartite Shrine (FlG. I:B,I) did not exist in this final phase of the palace . . . one would have expected in this undisturbed area to find remains of horns of consecration and probably also painted half-rosettes'. 242 Evans mentioned stone robbers 1899-1900, 68; 1900-1, 22. 243 My warm thanks to V Fotou for pointing this out to me and for a useful discussion on such cases. 244 Evans 1909, 291. 2« Hägg 1987, 133. 246 Evans 1928, 808.</page><page sequence="253">238 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS rules. I would see that part of the 'stylobate', which forms the E wall of the LSS, as covered either with a wall or with a wooden structure, to close off the LSS from the CC. The two niches created by the 'stylobate' and the true E wall of the CPS, north as well as south of the LSS, may have been open.247 In this manner a hypothetical tripartite division is obvious: a central part with two niches on either side. Religious associations with this general area are considered to have existed, though these have no direct relevance to the existence, or not, of a TS, let alone its form. Evans was early convinced of such connections.248 The evidence consists of several fragments of a seal impression (374~6):249 careful reconstruction has yielded a composition showing a female figure on a mountain peak, flanked by rampant lions.250 Behind her is a building decked with horns-of-consecration on its several storeys. A male figure stands in a subordinate position, hand to forehead.251 These were mostly found on a 'cement' floor252 over the mosaiko one: the majority in the SE corner, a few along the W wall. One was retrieved 'in a chamber to W . . .'253 presumably from the GPR, with another on top of a wall 'to N of this space'.254 This pattern of distribution could well argue for an original location on the floor above. It is tempting, therefore, to look for any shrine on the first floor. Apart from the sealings, a piece of fresco was discovered under the 'stylobate' (towards the SW corner of the CC, not near the CPS), 'showing part of the entablature in the miniature fresco style'.255 It was this that prompted Evans to declare that 'the façade of a small shrine erected on the Palace borders at the time of the great rebuilding would not have essentially differed in its details from the little temple already illustrated'.256 Once again, however, the argument makes assumptions. The fact that this piece was retrieved from under the 'stylobate' would rather indicate that any building it might echo belonged to the period before the great rebuilding, most likely when the Temple Repositories shrine was in use.257 As stated above, if one wishes to see a shrine in this region of the palace, basing an argument on the supposed connection between the miniature fresco and the actual architecture of the palace, then it would perhaps be better to look for it on the floor above. Many extant representations of Tripartite shrines show them to be elevated, the Zakro one, for example, being approached by steps,258 or comprised several storeys, as that on the sealings here. It is impossible really to successfully challenge Evans's interpretation after so much time, but it remains true that all the evidence for its placing at the ground level is at best circumstantial. 247 In FlGS. 48, 50 the N niche is more obvious than the S which seems to be slightly narrower and with its SW corner blocked. 248 Evans 1 900-1, 28. 249 Evans 1928, fig. 528. In 1900-1, 28, however, he wrote that at first sight 'they appeared to represent more than one sphragistic type, but a careful examination revealed the fact that though the fragments belonged to a series of clay sealings, they had all been impressed by the same signet'. In 1928, 808, he changed his mind and wrote 'in one case the lions stand on the ground on each side of the rocky peak'. See also Gill 1965, 71. 250 On the connection between female figures and lions see Goodison iq8q, 80-2. 251 On the relationship of the two figures see Sourvinou- Inwood iq8q, 247-8. 252 Evans (1900-1, 28) wrote: 'on removing the superincumbent earth early in the present season, a floor level came to light about 70 cms. below the surface covered with a deposit of burnt wood. In this layer, by careful sifting, was found a series of fragments of seal impressions'. Later (1928, 804, 808) Evans described this floor as of cement on which the sealings were found. 253 Evans (AE/NB 1901, 26) wrote: 'in chamber to W' and also (1900-1, 28) 'one in the chamber immediately to the west'. 254 Evans AE/NB 1901, 26; and another 'on top of wall to side' (iQoo-i, 28). 255 Evans 1928, 803, 808. 256 Evans 1028, 808. 257 See Evans's statement (1928, 803) 'among all the tests no single fragment occurred that could be assigned to even the earliest phase of LMIa'. 258 Platon 1 97 1, 163-9; Shaw 1978, 431.</page><page sequence="254">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 239 CONCLUSIONS FOR THE FINAL PERIOD Architecture and function are being explored. All the walls visible today were in use in the final period of the palace's existence. This does not mean that they were all erected at the same time. In the case of the rooms behind the Throne Room, in the same wing, the 1987 excavations produced enough evidence to argue that the walls, as seen today, were all rebuilt in the final construction campaign from the bottom course up.259 Such a sweeping renewal need not have been the case here, however. Some of the walls in the CPS may belong to main, earlier schemes, others could have been inserted at a later stage. It is quite clear from the condition of the dressed blocks, especially those where mason's marks or dowel-holes have been cut that a good deal of the material is re- used, probably more than once. There is nothing surprising in this, it was the rule in many parts of the palace, and particularly so in the West Wing. In order to unravel the sequence of events in the CPS, more excavation tests are necessary since no stratigraphical help is now available. What follows is thus both partial and in too many areas tentative. Judging from the majority of the walls, one major campaign of rebuilding was responsible for the present layout. Evans260 envisaged the Great Rebuilding to have occurred after the catastrophe at the end of MM IIIb. That catastrophe must have been considerable since it caused severe structural damage, which in turn led to the rebuilding seen today. In this manner, it is possible to argue that the area took its final form within the neopalatial era and more precisely in LM I.261 It must have been subject to local alterations later still, perhaps after a destruction at the end of LM Ia, witnessed in and around the palace, and even later in LM II also witnessed at Knossos.262 Finally there is the pierhead in the NW area, which recalls that observed in the rooms NW of the Throne Room, where it represents the latest architectural phase, which is quite conceivably dated to LM II-IIIa.263 In the rebuilding, not all earlier remains were totally razed. The N wall of the LSS was given its strange construction, by having the doorways of a polythyron infilled. The polythyron of the S wall into the ChTR was reduced. Part of the original E façade wall was pulled down, and floors were either kept, as in the LSS, or covered over by plaster without being lifted, as the evidence for the GPR might argue. Furnishings set in the floor may have been kept. The pillars in the Crypts belong to an earlier architectural phase but they may have been placed in their present position when the S wall of the Crypts was constructed, since they are positioned in the middle of the N-S axis of the Crypts but not the E-W.264 It is not impossible therefore that the plan of the CPS as seen today is in fact a far more subtle amalgam of two or three architectural periods. Some indications of this exist. There is a distinct difference in how the doorways are constructed in the E part and those in the NW, as mentioned above. Also the calibre and alignment of the S wall of the Crypts is in marked contrast with those nearby. This, in combination with the observation that it is placed over part of an earlier floor of the WPC, may mean that the S wall was inserted into an already standing scheme, when the EW Corridor was created to the south of the Crypts. Within the 259 This is a conclusion of great importance based on tests carried out in 1987 in the Throne Room area by Drs D.

The function of the area in this last period is hard to determine. Two types of shrine have generally been considered to be associated with cult: pillar crypts and bench sanctuaries.265 Evans from the start drew attention to the Pillar Crypts as the possible shrines. He called the East and West Pillar Crypts 'the House of the Double Axes'.266 He was influenced by the number of 'Double Axes' incised on the pillars, as well as by Hogarth's discovery, in the same year, of the Pillar Crypt in House B, at Gypsadhes.267 Later, Evans brought into the argument the pillar cult practised by Moslems, where the pillar was the focus of worship.268 Of the two Crypts, Evans distinguished the West as the actual shrine because the double axes appeared on all four sides of the pillar, and because it was empty, in contrast with the ten pithoi in the East.269 He saw the vats in the EPC, however, as associated with 'offerings of libations'270 and 'the pillars thus marked with the sign of the god are in fact his aniconic images.'271 Later he saw the Crypts as 'only crypts of a columnar sanctuary above', structural members supporting columns on the floor above from where 'the bases of two upper columns were actually found precipitated into the entrance lobby that borders the EPC on this side'.272 Nilsson accepted the idea that the pillars 'have a structural purpose ... as supports for columns in the upper storey'273 but he rejected the hypothesis that the pillar was the 'embodiment of a deity'. Rather he proposed that the pillars could be sacred by association with a shrine or 'that they were endowed with sacred power to strengthen their structural function'.274 Platon275 agreed with Evans that the pillar is an essential element of construction supporting the upper columnar shrine and further discussed the role not only of the pillar, but also of the pillar crypt and even the rooms associated with it as a whole, basing his arguments on the finds. Rutkowski was more sceptical, believing that the double-axe when incised onto a building could indicate that the structure was under the protection of a deity and that 'the purpose of these symbols of the deities was to give strength to the construction'.276 He may be correct in this sense. The crypts, it should be remembered, especially the E one, are at the geometric centre of the CPS bearing the weight of the upper floors, and they would, in theory, need the extra assistance of a deity to carry the weight of the upper floor. It should also be remembered that the gypsum column bases restored by Evans over the pillars of the Pillar Crypts were found in the LSS and it is impossible that they should have fallen into the LSS from the rooms above the Crypts. It is, therefore, impossible to accept that these column bases were connected to the pillars of the E and W Pillar Crypts. The presence of pithoi in the EPC and perhaps in the WPC points to storage. The number of the pithoi in the EPC would leave no space to move, let alone perform sacrifices or other 265 Evans 1899-1900, 34; 1902-3, 38; 1921, 425. 266 Evans 1800-1000, 32. 267 Hogarth 1899-1900, 76-7, pl. vi. 1,2. 268 Evans 1901, 102-6. 269 Evans 1899-1900, 34; it should, however, be remembered that some pithoi fragments may have come from the WPC, see above. 270 Evans 1900-1, 28. 271 Evans iqoi, 00-204. 272 Evans 1021, 4.2^. 273 Nilsson io^o, 237. 274 Nilsson 1 050, 248. 2™ Platon iQts4, 428-83. 276 Rutkowski 1972, 42.</page><page sequence="256">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 241 rites!277 They would also hinder access to the WPC. In the light of these considerations, and in the absence of finds associated with cult, there is no direct evidence that the Pillar Crypts in the CPS were used as shrines during the last phase. Only the bench sanctuary has been recognized as a definite type of shrine in Minoan architecture, because they exist with their cult figures and utensils from as early as EM II278 right down to the post-palatial era in the Shrine of the Double-Axes in the Palace at Knossos.279 Considering the stone bench in the LSS two questions need to be asked. Were any finds associated with it, or the room in general, that can be connected with cult? And to what extent can the architecture assist in identifying a bench sanctuary here? The answer to the first is that nothing connected with cult was found. To the second, to the best of my knowledge, all bench sanctuaries280 are much smaller, and do not occupy a pivotal position in their architectural setting, in the way the LSS does; they tend to be tucked out of the way. Of course, one never knows to what degree a palatial example might create its own pattern, but it is difficult to argue on this basis. The size and pivotal position of the LSS in combination with the bench, point to its function as a meeting place (not just a passage way).281 In conclusion, although pillar crypts can be seen to have religious connections, one requires the presence of the necessary finds to demonstrate this in specific cases. Essentially the same conditions apply to bench sanctuaries. And that is precisely what is here lacking for the final phase of use. The one indisputable expression in architectural terms would be the Tripartite Shrine, but there is some reason to express caution before accepting Evans's reconstruction of one at ground level. There seem to be no architectural criteria by which a sanctuary or cult area can be infallibly recognized within a larger structure.282 Taking into account Renfrew's criteria for determining the recognition of a religious area, there is nothing in the CPS to declare a cult activity.283 The only things that keep such a possibility alive are the clay seal impressions recovered from the area of the Tripartite Shrine. They depict a religious scene, perhaps the epiphany of a goddess standing in front of a multi-storey shrine crowned with horns-of-consecration, the goddess herself flanked by two lions. There is no evidence that the sealings were themselves being used in cult. It can, however, be argued that the ring, which sealed them, might have been, though such scenes are not uncommon in LM Crete.284 Nonetheless, if the nature of the scene has any connection with the function of the area where the sealings were found, it is on the upper floor that the shrine would have been located since the sealings fell from there. In this phase (for the ground floor) of the CPS there emerges a very prosaic picture as far as function is concerned: one mainly of storage, as already pointed out by Hallager.28^ Its sunken, cool and dark nature may have contributed to its importance as an area for storing various goods. The extent to which the area may be regarded as a department connected with the production and distribution of perfumed oils (mainly in the VR and probably in combination with the pithoi) remains conjectural, and even more so any attempt to connect such activities with a shrine in this region. 277 Evans 1 900-1, 28. 278 Warren 1972b, 85-7. 279 Evans 1928, 335-44. 280 Gesell 1985, 19-22; Panagiotaki 1985, 58-73; Pilali- Papasteriou 1985, 284-7. 281 Michailidou (1987, 509-25) has argued about the importance of the room with a column in Minoan domestic architecture (found mainly in east Crete). The LSS has a lot in common with 'the room with a column' but it lacks the column. The two column bases found in it were found in the fill and cannot have belonged to the ground floor level. 282 Shaw 1078, 431; see also Palwou iqqo, 44, tt. 283 Renfrew 108^, 22-3. 284 Popham 1974, 217. 285 Hallager 1987, 172.</page><page sequence="257">242 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS The distribution of liquids, such as oil, is also problematic; though it might be borne in mind that the recipients of a considerable quantity have been recognized as deities.286 It is, thus, tempting to see the incoming oil as connected with the deities of the shrine, and the oil going out, perhaps as perfumed oil processed in the VR and sent to other shrines. The fact that there is now a more direct route into the West Magazines (the corridor S of the Crypts) may suggest that there was an increase in goods delivered to the CPS, because other routes into the West Magazines (if they ever existed) were closed or reduced.287 Why should goods reach the West Magazines through the CPS in the last phase? Was the same happening in previous phases? The answer to the second question will be discussed in the Phasing Section; the answer to the first may be found in the tablets recovered from the LSS, which record names of deities as the recipients. This implies that the goods were collected in the West Magazines in the name of the deities.288 Hallager's289 idea for the purification of goods could be correct if both corridors (the one immediately S of the Crypts and the other further S connecting the Long Gallery with the Stone Vases Room) were contemporary. Evans290 presented them in plans as contemporary, but we should not forget that he saw the corridor S of the Crypts as a permanent feature from the Old Palace onward291 and I have shown in this study that it was created in the last phase(s) of the New Palace. What may, thus, be concluded is that goods were reaching the West Magazines through the CPS (and were also disbursed through it) during the last phase(s). This may suggest that the CC played the role of a large meeting place for the people who were bringing or collecting goods. This has important social implications: the visitor reached the CC through intricate routes but nonetheless they did reach the heart of the palace and approached the Sanctuary. Unless all this was done by high officials and not by individuals. Materials and Construction of the CPS Area This section is only a general review of the more obvious points, and as such no great effort has been made to separate the two strands that compose it. For a more complete background to Minoan architectural practices, the monograph of Shaw should be consulted.292 MATERIALS At Knossos two types of stone, namely poros limestone and gypsum, were preferred for architectural elements.293 Porolithos, a creamy white, fossiliferous limestone outcrops extensively on local hillsides. Being soft, easily cut, and ready available, it became the obvious choice as a construction stone. Other varieties of limestone played a subordinate role.294 A hard, bluish-grey, often brecciate variety 286 It should be remembered that the oil used for anointing in Orthodox Greek Churches today is provided by the Patriarch in Constantinople, the centre of Greek Orthodoxy Could the CPS provide an analogy? 287 Evans (1900-1, 21; and 1921, 448 and figs. 322-3) saw the 'isolation' of the Long Corridor of the Magazines as of MM III date. It is not certain, however, that the Long Corridor was directly connected with the outside of the palace in this period or earlier; for the Old Palace period see Momigliano IQQ2, 165-75. 288 See also Evans (1902-3, 36, 38) who saw a strong connection between the Magazines (especially the three southernmost ones) and the Sanctuary. 289 Hallager 1087, 174-5. 290 Evans 1921, fie. 18. 291 Evans 10,21, fig. 152, op. p. 202. 292 Shaw 1073, 11-27, 75-126, 139-235. 293 My sincere gratitude to Dr. M. Durkin for reading this section and making corrections and useful suggestions. 294 Papageorgakis and Boskos 1988, 9 Table 1. In this table the possible source of each stone type is also given.</page><page sequence="258">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 243 was utilised occasionally for pavements or column bases, while travertine (another calcium based material) from the lower slopes of the Ailias Hill was used for decorative purposes. Gypsum occurs locally in two varieties, a fine-grained white variant and one with coarse bladed crystals up to several cm in length.295 The fine-grained variant, more resistant to weathering than the bladed variety, degrades in moist air to a white powder consisting of various hydrates of calcium sulphate admixed with calcium carbonate. Coarse-grained gypsum is mechanically unstable its crystals readily deform and/ or separate under stress. Examples of the use of other types of stone, namely conglomerates, quartzites, and grey- green volcanics, are not unknown. Such rock types were probably recovered as boulders from the valley of the River Kairatos (directly to the east of the palace). Poros limestone fragments were no doubt collected in an undressed state from adjacent hillsides and fields. As such they were eminently suited to the construction of minor architectural features and were widely used as infill in block walls. Larger limestone blocks intended for use in ashlar work, hewn and ground to shape on site, were no doubt quarried rather than collected. Many gypsum slabs would have been shaped at or near the construction site, with the aid of a saw. The re-use of much of the material in the rubble masonry walls has often been remarked on. The evidence for this is drawn from breakage patterns visible on otherwise relatively regularly formed blocks, especially if a mason's mark is so damaged. Burning too is a valuable indication of the state of affairs. The condition of the schists exploited is difficult to assess: the stone has a natural tendency to split into slabs, and those observed on the floors have irregular forms that indicate a lack of deliberate shaping. OBSERVATIONS ON DEPLOYMENT OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS Gypsum The façades received a greater degree of attention than the interior walls, in that well-dressed blocks of limestone and gypsum were employed. The former formed a plinth, on which the gypsum blocks were set to form two faces. This style of construction is well known from the West Court façade;296 the blocks were held together by wooden tie-beams and clamps, running horizontally and set in grooves and recesses cut into the stone. The wooden tie system has not been preserved in the CPS area. The space between opposing gypsum blocks is filled with rubble and earth packing bonded together by a clay or mudstone matrix. Larger fragments of rubble were positioned toward the base for greater stability in the overall structure. The pierhead construction of the gypsum wall affords great strength combined with the aesthetically pleasing external appearance afforded by dressed gypsum blocks. The pillars are the free-standing version of the same principle.297 Most of the floors were paved, fine-grained gypsum being the preferred stone. Floor slabs, generally square or rectangular, are often discoloured by traces of burning. Slab dimensions vary, some of the thickest examples are to be seen in the WPC. 295 Papageorgakis and Boskos, (1988, 3) wrote: 'Gypsum, white to grey coloured . . . fine to very coarse-crystalline, the length of the crystals ranging from under 1 mm to about 3 cms ... the fine-grained varieties are relatively compact and can be used as building stones . . . especially when they contain finely distributed carbonate (dolomite or calcite)'. Also pages 8, 9, Table 1. 296 Evans (1928, 798) wrote: 'This Western Palace wall - as being an exterior wall - was thicker than that which bounded the Central Court, having a double line of orthostats with a rubble filling between'. 297 Evans 1899-1900, 53 n.i.</page><page sequence="259">244 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Fine-grained gypsum was often employed to provide architectural elements with a pleasing external appearance. Threshold slabs, door-jamb bases298 and a dado on the E wall of the LSS, and probably the dados in the GPR, all make use of it. The jamb bases are for single- leaved doors, with single rabbets, except the doors in the E wall of the ChTR, which have double rabbets. The coarser variant is used, except for the large specimens in the EPC at the entrances leading into the RN and the VR. Lastly various embellishments and items of furniture were fashioned from gypsum: the cist in the GPR and the upper cists in the TRR, and benches in the LSS and the WPC. Poros, limestone and schist Limestone was used for the Temple Repositories (blocks for the West, slabs for the East), the vats in the EPC, and the VR. Irregularly shaped slabs of limestone were used to form a mosaic pavement in the verandah. At the centre of the LSS2" a mosaiko pavement is formed by a combination of cream-coloured poros with stained limestone (amygdalopetra) held together by red (and white?) plaster. Schist,300 dense and blue-black (because of burning), forms the floor in the VR combined with gypsum slabs. Schist slabs also cover the south part of the floor in the RN. Wood Wood was also an important construction material though little in the way of building timber has come down to us. A noteworthy omission is the lack of examples of the timber framework to support the buildings. The Knossian architects employed a single vertical beam, situated in the middle of the wall of each room, to support a horizontal beam about 1.60 m above floor level. Through beams are seemingly very rare.301 It may be doubted that such a sparse and superficial arrangement would have given elasticity to the walls during earthquakes, as is generally argued. No structural timber has survived, and little now remains apart from occasional traces of carbonized dust. Analyses of charcoal from Minoan structural timbers are not yet available. From impressions left behind in mud plaster it can be inferred that bark was removed and timbers were used in their natural state. It can also be deduced that structural beams were circular or semicircular in cross-section. When used as clamps or ties, as in the façade walls, timber required more exact shaping. Similar requirements would have been necessary for doors, window frames and a wide variety of internal carpentry fittings. The same would have been true for the doors themselves, in the case of the entrance from the EPC into the RN, a glimpse of a local difficulty can be observed. Two squared planks, each set vertically at the ends of the jamb, apparently did not meet, the intervening gap being filled with mud plaster. Of course, much wood would have been used for ceilings and roofs, some remnants of which may have been recorded in the mass of carbonized wood found in the TR, about half way down the room's in- fill.302 298 Evans 1800-1000, 53 n.i. 299 Papageorgakis and Boskos 1988, 9, Table 1. 300 Evans 1899-1900, 53 n.3. 301 A probable tie-beam in NW corner of VR. 302 Evans 1900-1, 27 n.i.</page><page sequence="260">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2^ Plasters Plasters were manufactured from mud, lime and gypsum.303 A form of powdered kouskouras is another possibility, but analysis is required to confirm this. What little has survived at Knossos is an orange-red to brown mud plaster often mixed with chopped plant matter, and including small stones and sherd fragments. Wall surfaces were coated with this admixture to provide an even surface for the revetment, i.e. lime plaster or gypsum slabs. It was also used to coat and/or pack around the timbers incorporated in the walls and similar architectural features. The mud or clay used as mortar in the interstices of the rubble masonry is probably of a different composition, but this awaits further investigation. In this context it is quite feasible to suppose that a locally available marl 'kouskouras' could have been used. Lime plasters were predominately used to provide the final coating for the walls. They also provided a suitable base capable of accepting painted decoration (of which very little is known in the present context): red and white stripes in the TR,3°4 red in the EPC. Lime plasters provide a tough light-reflecting coating, but as floors they are vulnerable to the passage of feet. Evans may allude to plaster floors in the GPR.3°5 Lime plaster (but also gypsum plaster) was used to seal cracks between the stone slabs of cists, and, suitably coloured, is packed between the stone slabs of mosaiko floors. Mason's marks306 It is plain that none is in situ, to this extent any discussion of their original purpose is out of place here. The signs depicted are stars (7 examples), tridents (4), double axes (11, plus further examples on the pillars),307 windows (2), branches (3) and others of uncertain type (2). All are quite typical of those occurring throughout the palace. With the exception of the tridents most, from their size and relative neatness of execution, post-date the Old Palace period. The tridents, more deeply and crudely cut, belong to an earlier phase.308 They have been interpreted as 'masons' marks' or as religious symbols; most scholars would agree that they might have had some religious significance.309 Architectural Evidence for Phasing From the study of the architecture standing now, it is evident that walls were rebuilt, perhaps on earlier lines, or moved, while doors were blocked, and structures and floors were not removed but used as the foundations for later floors. However, the evidence for earlier phases in the CPS is so fragmentary that it is impossible to show on plans. The evidence of earlier phases is discussed room by room with attempts to tie the phasing detected in one to another. 303 Analyses have shown mainly lime based plasters, but also gypsum plasters were found at Knossos, see Cameron et ai, 1977, 121-84; and Shaw 1973, 207-18. 304 Evans (1900-1, 27) wrote: 'The white-faced stucco on the south wall of this room showed stripes of red below and above, forming a kind of dado and cornice band similar to that of the magazines and Long Corridor.' On pigments see Cameron et ai, 1977, 157-71. 305 Evans 1935, 635; AE/NB 1929, vol. 1, 3a. 306 Hood io8*7a. 20^-12: also forthrnmincr 307 The WPC pillar bears 17 incised double axes, while the EPC pillar bears 9 double axes according to Evans (1 899-1 900, 32).

Mackenzie presented the account of this work.312 The traces of 'he first façade start today at the Grand Staircase and continue to the S wall of the GPR.313 Here there is an interruption until a door-jamb base appears on line at the foot of the N side of the staircase of the LSS. N of the jamb, minor investigations revealed traces of stone thought to have been the base of the façade at the appropriate level,314 though Evans preferred to equate them more with the jamb.315 In character and technique it is similar to the West Court façade (as is evident by the GPR), though thinner: gentle recesses in its line are visible. On a limestone plinth are placed two lines of gypsum orthostats parallel to each other with rubble infilling. Evans316 was not clear about the date of this phase: he wrote that it 'goes back, like the orthostatic wall that borders the West Court, to the early days of the Middle Minoan Palace'. A few lines later, he states that 'it is possible, indeed, that the frontage along the Central Court may date back to this epoch (meaning proto-palace), since its Northern termination shows the same rounded outline . . . (as) the same original Palace insula'. Driessen317 saw it as an Old Palace wall together with other walls in the CPS following Evans.318 Niemeier319 expressed the opinion that it is an early MM III wall, but since these views were not based on the results of stratigraphical investigations, they should be considered hypothetical. The new façade (FIG. 50; PLAN I) is built further east and consists of a line of rectangular limestone blocks based on rubble.320 Evans called it 'a very interesting structural feature, marking ... an extension east of the frontage of the west section of the Palace.'321 While the first façade wall continues to be the E limit of the TR and the GPR with a verandah created between the older and the new façade, the LSS has undergone an eastward expansion instead, up to the new line. In 1925-6,322 Evans performed what he called 'a series of analyses of "pure" elements' 310 Evans 1928, 803, fig. 525 and n.16. 311 Evans 1928, 798. 312 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1904, 5) wrote: ' . . a little W ot the W façade of the Central Court runs a broken line of wall consisting of gypsum blocks on a stylobate of rough limestone slabs themselves intended to be invisible. This line of wall begins N-wards with the curious curved construction of gypsum . . . The curved wall has an organic function in relation to the system which forms its immediate arrangement but this construction at intervals of the same wall to the south has no such organic function in relation to the adjoining W façade of the Central Court. The whole wall by this fact betrays itself to be an earlier construction more or less completely assimilated into a later system.' He continued on p. 7: 'The gypsum construction in line with the curved wall further S also became absorbed as an element into later structure, but in this case the later structure is merely an inside wall - the E wall of the Room of the Large Cists which contained the porcelain deposit excavated last year.' 313 The same façade seemed to have continued N to the rounded corner of gypsum blocks at the NE angle of the Throne Room, and S to the sw corner of the CC. It is interrupted by the expansions of rooms E, i.e. the Throne Room Antechamber and the building of the Grand Staircase. 314 In FIGS. 57a,b, Mackenzie shows the N-S continuation of the early E façade up to the S wall (the space covered by the entrance door included) shaded and wrote 'Early Façade Foundations'. 3'5 In FIG. 59, Evans has noted of the door-jamb: 'alter as indicated to show Central Pillar N support of architrave over double opening (viz. one from steps and one from small area)'. 316 Evans 1928, 798. 3'7 Driessen 1990, 103-5, %• 9- 318 Evans 1921, fie 152 opp. p. 203. 319 Niemeier 1994, 79. 320 Evans placed on it two square pillars of gypsum - none found in situ, but restored from fallen positions nearby. 321 Evans 1028, 708. 322 Evans 1928, 801; Mackenzie DM/DB 1925, 36-7.</page><page sequence="262">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2tf beneath the new façade ('stylobate') in order to establish its date. All the sherds found he assigned to a MM IIlB date, regarding one or two pieces of 'tortoise shell ripple ware' he said that they were 'erroneously regarded as LMIA'.323 Mackenzie,324 however, very positively, called them LM Ia. Evans clearly assigned the 'stylobate' to the restoration that happened 'after the great seismic disaster towards the close of MMIIIB'.325 The sherds with ripple cannot be found in the boxes containing sherds collected from the above mentioned tests, consequently, we cannot be certain of their precise dating, and even less so, since Evans and Mackenzie did not agree. EVIDENCE FOR EARLIER PHASES: LOBBY OF THE STONE SEAT Good evidence for two architectural phases is retrievable with the slight chance of a more indefinable third one too. The first phase is connected with the manner in which the room is believed to observe the line of the earlier façade wall. The presence of this façade wall is obvious in Mackenzie's326 sketch (FIG. 57 a-b): the foundations of the E wall continue south as far as the jamb base beside the foot of the stairs. Traces of the mosaiko verandah floor (TS area) too are thought to be visible under the large gypsum block in the recess of the E end of the N wall327 suggesting that they originally continued S along the E side of the LSS. All this suggests a square room, whose internal dimensions would be those of the central mosaiko pavement and border. The unresolved question is to what extent this first façade wall is contemporary with the conception of the room in its polythyron form. If the association is accepted, however, the squarish room would have been served by a flight of stairs, of much the same width as is seen today, but probably lower, judging from the level of the mosaiko floor in area D of the Tripartite Shrine. A doorway opened at the foot of the stairs. Along the E side, on the outside, a verandah with a mosaiko pavement ran higher by about 0.65 m than the floor of the LSS.328 The façade would have had a very slight projection as it continued south of the room. At this point another piece of evidence for a yet earlier phase comes in: it rests on the fact that the door-jamb base at the foot of the stairs is below the level of the floor slabs adjacent. Was the pavement raised in the creation of the second phase? Or does the door-jamb base actually belong to a period predating the visible gypsum and mosaiko pavement? Recall that Mackenzie at first thought that the similar bases of the polythyron on the S wall were half-buried in the floor adjacent to them. This is not true, however, of the blocked eastern door in the N wall. This matter must rest undecided. Another important point should be noted. The NW corner of the mosaiko central square consists of two burnt rectangular gypsum slabs, at the 323 Evans 1028, 8o&lt;?. 324 Mackenzie (DM/DB 1925, opp. p. 34-8, relevant Tests no 19a and 20; opp. p. 35) wrote: 'The few sherds in this basket (Lot 19a) were not collected with the others because disturbance had taken place in connection with [not clear] of a drain built by us to carry off water from low lying area of Room of Column Bases. 7 unpainted not placeable. 1 MM III with traces of black glaze slip. 1 with LM IÃ ripple well known from cups found W. of North East magazines and Pholding up to LM Ia.' 325 Evans 1928, 798; Driessen accepts this date as correct (1990, 102). 326 Mackenzie DM/DB 1007, 84. 327 The mosaiko slabs are visible under the 'chimney block' of the recess in the NE corner of the room; they are in fact placed between the upper and lower block. If they are part of the mosaiko running along the verandah then the block under them must pre-date them. One cannot be fully certain that these slabs are from the mosaiko without lifting the upper block. 328 Evans (1921, fig. 152, opp. p. 203) saw the verandah running along the whole length of the CPS.</page><page sequence="263">248 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS same level as the gypsum slabs in front of the bench (the only original slabs of the border) and lower than the mosaiko (but still higher than the above mentioned jamb base). Is this a careless repair or did the central square originally consist of rectangular gypsum slabs as is the case in the WPC? This would make the mosaiko329 central square later330. Only excavation could give an answer to this question. The second phase sees the erection of the 'stylobate' façade. The E wall is removed and rebuilt on the new line: this action increases the size of the room and encloses the stairway. The old verandah line is interrupted. Internally, perhaps, the N polythyron is blocked up, and the door at its W end opened.331 The bench and balustrade are inserted and new floor slabs laid at the east (all look of the same kind of gypsum, and unlike the slabs in front of the bench have not been burnt). Access from the CC is exactly as before, except that there is no evidence of any closable doorway.332 The nature of the recess in the N wall, and whether there was a window above the dado in the E wall, are points for speculation, but not proof. If it can be shown that the mosaiko of the central square sits on a square of gypsum slabs, plaster may have covered the border line of burnt gypsum slabs, to go with the mosaiko. Such an arrangement is not impossible, to judge from the plaster floor in the GPR and from the fact that the central mosaiko pavement (unlike the similar ones in the Throne Room and Antechamber) is at a higher level than the original border of gypsum slabs in front of the bench. There must have been a floor of the same height as the mosaiko, to match. For the absolute date of these reworkings, there is no evidence, certainly the area was used down to the time of the Linear B archives, but whether there were minor alterations in the scheme, or even major ones, is not now detectable from the architecture alone. One assumes that the reworking was part of the basic rebuilding of the surrounding area because of the common reuse of earlier limestone and gypsum blocks, following the 'MM IHb' catastrophe.333 Test iv, it should be recalled, contained material which may have been contemporary with the TR vases, and this could be used to support some connection between the great rebuilding and the expansion of the LSS east. The infilling of the N wall, however, could be later. In the area of the Throne Room there is certainly evidence for a complete demolition of all walls to their bottom course before the final phase, associated with the white plaster floors, probably erected well into neopalatial (after LM I), if not later. However, it does not follow that so complete a rebuilding took place in the CPS. Perhaps the walls seen today are substantially those associated with the first phase. 329 Unlike the gypsum slabs no sign of burning is evident on the mosaiko slabs. 330 Driessen (iqqo, fig q) sees it as an Old Palace floor. 331 Its jamb bases are much lower than the jamb bases of the blocked door, they may thus not be contemporary. 332 In Figs. 46, 48-51 there is no threshold at the appropriate place on the 'stylobate'; is this the result of stone robbers, or was the staircase much lower than it has been reconstructed? This question cannot be answered now. In later plans there is a threshold, which must be conjectural. 333 Evans (1921, 317) wrote: '. . . the closing phase of this period - here defined as MMIIlB ... it is clear that throughout a large part of the West Wing there must have been a considerable conflagration . . .'; and (1928, 798): '. . . in the scheme of restoration adopted after the great seismic disaster towards the close of MMIIIb'. Mackenzie (DM/DB 1907, 83-4, 7 May) observed: 'the position now of the central panel show that the room as originally designed has to be put into relation with the Central Court W façade of the Earlier Palace . . . The probable date of the alteration which took place when the new W façade of the Central Court was built is given by the pottery ... to the end of the MMIII period'.</page><page sequence="264">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2^g PHASING FOR THE NE UNIT Great Pithos Room At the E end of the N wall a small slab of crystalline gypsum seems to continue under the wall line. In addition the W end of the N wall is sitting on the threshold.334 It may be that Evans was correct when he envisaged this and the TRR as one room.335 But the date is not known. The present slabbed floor is believed to be a later one, in that the Great Pithos seems to sit on a lower and earlier floor of plaster.336 A sketch by Evans337 (FIG. 60) may concern this area: two plaster and clay floors were found on either side of a gypsum one. Each of the plaster floors is cio cm' thick and about '30 cm' from the stone pavement. One of the floors he labels MM IIb, the other MM III. The upper floor roughly matches the height Evans gave in the sketch. In the publication Evans338 mentioned that the lower plaster floor was 0.30 m lower than the upper floor and thus it matches the height of the floor in the sketch. However, in the publications Evans339 saw this earlier floor as a MM III one, but he gave the pithos a LM I date. The N wall must have been inserted during the life of the gypsum floor as it seems to be sitting on it. The plaster floor seen today on top of the gypsum and, recorded by Evans340 as found around the pithos, may have been the last floor laid in the area. It is feasible to assume that the gypsum floor is that visible today, the upper, plaster one observed at the edges of the gypsum floor, and the lower as that on which the Pithos rests. The unsolved but critically important point is whether more of the CPS had such a plaster floor above the gypsum ones. It is tempting to associate the central mosaiko square in the LSS with a plaster floor surrounding it and matching in height that in the GPR. One solution would assign the visible stone floor, in the GPR, to a period equivalent to the first phase of the LSS, the earlier floor with the postulated earlier phase of the LSS. The white plaster one would date later to the final rebuilding and the second phase of the LSS. Temple Repositories Room It is not clear whether all the remains of gypsum belong to the same floor or to two different ones: one to go with the TR, and one later to seal them. Whatever the exact case, there is clear evidence, in PLATE 37 ¿z, for a gypsum slab floor associated with the small later cists and hence, the latest gypsum floor in the room. These cists stand 0.10-0.15 m at least above the tops of the TR, so that one can, indeed must, postulate another, lower floor to go with the TR. No certain records of its nature exist, however. In an irregular trench situated between the threshold and the WTR, found and cleaned by the present author, there are remains of limestone slabs at the same level as the earlier plaster floor of the GPR. Whether they are the remains of an earlier floor, at the appropriate level to go with the TR, has to remain but a possibility, until this trench is further investigated. Remains of what may be a plaster floor and dado are visible along the W part of the S wall; they are at a higher level than the plaster floor in the GPR. 334 It is possible that the W end of the wall has been rebuilt by Evans. 335 Evans 1921, fie. 152, opp. p. 203. 336 Evans 1935, 633. 337 Evans AE/NB 1020, vol. 1, 3a. 338 Evans 1935, 633-5. 339 Evans io«^, 6w. 340 Evans 1935, 633.</page><page sequence="265">250 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Conclusions for the NE Unit The TRR has one surviving gypsum floor, one earlier floor of unknown form and a probable plaster floor over the gypsum one; the latter is set higher than the gypsum floor and the plaster floor visible in the GPR. The GPR gypsum floor may run on under the N wall shared with the TRR. It would be satisfying if the early GPR floor and the earlier TRR one were the same, the gypsum one of the TRR and the upper plaster one of the GPR may have been contemporary. The gypsum floor of the GPR is at a lower level than the threshold into the TRR, and the TRR gypsum floor itself. If, however, the patches of gypsum along the E part of the S wall of the TRR (which are at a slightly lower level than the patches along the N wall but at the same level as the GPR gypsum floor) are a continuation of the GPR gypsum floor, then there may have been two phases of gypsum floor in the TRR. 'Below the threshold' of the GPR and the TRR, a deposit found by Evans (see Chapter 2), ought to predate the gypsum threshold, which seems to have been set in place at the same time as the N wall. One vase fragment has brown bands and traces of a filled-in spiral in the dark-on-light technique; this can be contemporary with some of the latest TR vases. A conical cup from the same deposit is seen by Hood341 as typical 'MM IIIb' (Evans's date), and of the same type as ones recovered from the cists N of the TRR which were sealed at the same time. If this deposit is contemporary with the TR and the contents of the cists north of them, the threshold and the N wall may have been erected at the time of the closing of the TR or slightly later. The gypsum floor visible in the GPR and in the LSS and the polythyra were probably in use during the life of the TR. Later must be the floor associated with the later cists of the TRR (since it had been covering the TR until Evans lifted it) and later still the upper plaster floor in the GPR and the TRR (LM Ia down to LM IIIa). The ßrst architectural period consists of the possible floor on which the Great Pithos is believed to rest; it may be equivalent to that hinted at in the LSS and the TRR. It remains obscure, but it may be early Second Palace. In its second architectural period (LSS first phase) evidently the room would have been served by the polythyron from the LSS, and may have been of some importance to be so treated. It would have comprised all of what is now included in the GPR and the TRR342 and its floor would have been of gypsum slabs. The TR may have been used in connection with the cists further north. The fact that the joins of both TR were sealed with plaster suggests that their use may have involved liquids; the perforated floor slab of the WTR points in the same direction. The TRR may have been used for craft activities probably under the aegis of the shrine. A fire accompanied its destruction, evident in the TR material, if it was caught in this destruction. The third architectural period (LSS second phase; Late Neopalatial or Mycenaean Knossos) saw a slight fall in the status of the area. This is indicated most clearly by the loss of the polythyron entrance. The GPR now has a plaster floor and dado. Perhaps the TR were sealed now; smaller cists were built over them, though their purpose may have been very different from that of the TR. If our conclusions are correct, then they were used for storage, a use also apparent in the numbers of pithoi recovered from the GPR. The partition wall of the GPR 341 Hood 1996, 13. 342 Evans 192 1, fig. 152. In the MM II palace, Evans presented a single room. This may have been the same in the MM III palace as well. More excavation is needed in these two rooms, particularly under the wall dividing them in order to have all this clarified.</page><page sequence="266">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2$l and TRR was inserted at the very start: perhaps it was an integral part in that it would have marked the divide between the TRR with its later and higher stone floor and the GPR with its plaster one. A plaster floor and dado were also laid in the TRR, perhaps at a later date (after the fire that destroyed the vats in the VR and probably the gypsum floor in the TRR?). The N face of the dividing wall of the GPR and the TRR shows that even now a simple linear decoration was applied to the frescoed walls. Other than the partition wall of the TRR and GPR, there is no obvious reason why the walls should not belong to the second phase as much as to a later one. PHASING FOR THE W UNIT The evidence is taken together by sub-units. TheEPCandWPC Matters here are less easily understood and centre on the floors of the EPC and the S wall of the WPC (and by extension EPC too). Other questions, such as whether the pillar of the WPC is related to the sunken floor or not, cannot be resolved. The first phase comprises the gypsum structure (cists) at the SW corner of the EPC. It seems to have been associated with Old Palace material, probably MM IB.343 No other such structures were found in the N part of the EPC or any of the surrounding rooms (except the pit the VRD came from). The second phase would involve, at least, the gypsum floor presently visible. It is difficult to know whether the latest gypsum floor is of the same period as the present walls. But the recent excavations, when the bottom of the W wall was cleaned, showed that the gypsum floor originally went with a red-faced wall plaster. The third phase affects the S wall of the Crypts, which was shifted to the north and also narrowed, so as to permit the creation of the EW Corridor to its south. The present S wall of the WPC is built on the southern portion of the pavement; the southernmost part of the E series of border slabs also runs on under the S wall. The inference is obvious enough: namely the present E-W corridor that runs south of the Pillar Crypts did not exist earlier. Its construction on top of the existing floor in the WPC and the wall's unusual thinness both argue that it was a relatively minor alteration to an already existing layout. It could have occurred either as part of a major rebuild along existing lines or as a minor rebuilding within a standing scheme. No clues exist as to which was the case unless something can be made of the fact that it abuts the wall dividing the E from the W Pillar Crypt and its style of construction is different from the other walls. It is, moreover, built over the Old Palace gypsum structure at the SW corner of the room. The S wall may have been moved, at the same time that the pillar was placed in the WPC. The pillar stands midway on the N-S axis of the room, but it does not respect the central square: it is placed near the N line of the square and slightly higher than the slabs in it. This may suggest that the square was covered by another floor, perhaps of plaster, after the pillar was placed in its present position. The inconsistency of the border surrounding the square points to the same 343 The vases from the trench were dated by Platon (1954, 433) as Old Palace but Hutchinson (1962, 165) saw them as MM Ia (now seen as MM IB, Cadogan et al. 1993, 21-8).</page><page sequence="267">252 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS conclusion (the S part of which is half of that of the N part of the room, since the S wall is sitting on it). However, the pillar and the double axes on it are the same as the pillar in the EPC, and the date of the double axes is seen as MM III (perhaps early). It is, therefore, possible that both pillars were either originally in the EPC (when the space occupied by the present S corridor was part of the Crypts) or, perhaps, in the central square of the LSS, especially if it consisted of gypsum slabs. Both pillars seem to lie on the centre of the N-S axis of the rooms but not the E-W, so there is some connection between the pillars and the position of the S wall. Moreover, if the pillar in the EPC was in its present position when the S wall was further south, it could not have been a 'central' pillar; it would have been off-centre. A fourth phase needs to be added if Evans was correct in seeing a blocking of the S wall opening in the WPC, although it is not clear that this was so. (Also the cross wall in the RN may belong to the same phase.) To this phase the two layers of wall plaster, applied over the red-faced plaster on the W wall of the EPC, must also belong. Still later would be the possible plaster floor applied over the three wall plaster fragments in the W wall of the EPC. This may be contemporary with the plaster floor in the GPR. It is not easy to fit the above four phases into the three architectural periods proposed for the LSS and the NE Unit. The walls visible today ought to go with their counterparts in the third architectural period. The fourth phase could belong to the lifetime of the same architectural period. The first phase, if truly associated with MM IB or II, may be contemporary with the VRD. But with which walls both deposits were associated has to remain open. The floors of the second phase and the S wall of the third (with the creation of the E-W corridor) must be Neopalatial (LM Ia) or later: but it is not clear if they start with the second or third architectural period of the LSS and NE Unit. It could be that the present walls go partly with the second and partly with the third period, and the S wall wholly within the third period. Sub-units ii and Hi If the wall dividing the VR and the RN is seen as a later addition, then during the first phase these two rooms formed one. Whether or not this partition wall was inserted rather than rebuilt cannot be proven; if inserted, then another large square room would have been situated north of the EPC, served by two doors, much as the EPC itself is from the LSS. From Trench i in the recent excavation an 'in-and-out' bowl fragment was found associated with a trench opened for the insertion of the vats. If this sherd is MM IIIb/LM Ia transitional (Warren's dating), it follows that the vats and the gypsum floor that goes with them were placed in their present position during or soon after the TR phase, perhaps during the great rebuilding. The presence of the pierhead construction might be used to argue that the present walls, if not the plan too, are of a late date.344 Whether it is later than anything else in the area cannot be ascertained. If the S and E walls of Room B were removed, then a fourth squarish room would appear, this time N of the WPC. This scheme appealed to Evans345 and the presence of 344 Pers. comm., V Fotou. 345 Evans (192 1, fig. 152) presented these two rooms as one.</page><page sequence="268">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 253 blocked doors in the W and N walls, if ever proven, would be a point in its favour. It is not inconceivable that four crypts, with or without pillars, existed here in an interconnecting unit at a time roughly contemporary with the postulated single room, served by a polythyron to the N of the LSS. All this needs checking by careful excavation before it is accepted. The mixing of schist and gypsum in a rather haphazard manner for the floors of the VR and RN may also show that more than one phase of flooring is involved. The gypsum paving in Room A, although slightly lower than it should be in relation to the standing walls, seems to go with them, in that it respects the line of the N wall so it may have been contemporary with it. The schist slabs (if they were part of a floor) must be later. The room may have connected with the Long Corridor of the W Magazines by a door at its W wall. The unusual concentration of many well-dressed, reused gypsum blocks in the S wall of Room A and the corner slabs for supports in Room i?346 may suggest a lightwell in the area, as their walls tend to be of ashlar construction. It could have lit the RN and the VR, here taken potentially as a single unit used for some craft activity. It has been suggested that the vats received pithoi, a base of one being located there. While not impossible, pithoi are not normally so treated and an alternative purpose must be sought. Furthermore, only one pithos was recovered here, though next door (in the EPC) ten were still in place. I suggest a working area, comprising the VR and RN (a single room), lit from the W by a lightwell in Rooms A and B. The recent excavation showed that the vats were burnt, heavily on their upper surfaces, less so on their upper W sides. This may have been caused by an intense fire fuelled by oil, that occurred after the TR catastrophe, perhaps during the last period of the life of the palace. The gypsum floor slabs adjacent to them, however, do not show any sign of burning. Consequently, either they were placed in their present position later than the vats or, whatever caught fire burnt inside the vats and in the NE corner, where there are also clear traces of burning. The schist floor slabs at the N end of the room were also burnt. " In terms of the architectural periods devised for the rest of the area, no exact assignations can be attempted. The walls of the VR and RN, being similar to the other units, should belong to the same major rebuild that opens the third architectural period. But the wall dividing the VR and the RN could be later, and the N wall later still, since it sits on the burnt slabs and soil (though it may have been rebuilt along the line of an earlier one). The walls of Rooms A and B, however, give a different impression. If the pier construction can be paralleled with that in the Throne Room system (and therefore be assigned a late date) this area could have undergone a local rebuild later than any of the other rooms under discussion. The gypsum floor of Room A (small slabs hastily laid) also points to a late construction. In this case a fourth architectural period must be proposed to accommodate it. The wall built in the RN, reducing its S end to a niche, may be later still. The Tripartite Shrine Two architectural phases are discernible in the floor area of the TS. The latest floor of cement or burnt clay was found to lie C8 cm' above the paving of the CC347 and see FIG. 59. On this floor Evans found the sealings showing a goddess in front of a shrine. He dated this floor later than the great rebuilding.348 It could be linked with the second phase of the LSS. 346 See Room B above. 347 Evans 1903-4, 28. 348 Evans 1903-4, 28.</page><page sequence="269">254 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Evans349 recorded a second floor, '23cm' below the cement one, which consisted of small limestone slabs. This was the mosaiko floor of the verandah that runs along the E façade wall, and was taken to be either of the First Palace period or the beginning of the Second.350 It could go with the first phase of the LSS. Part of this mosaiko floor was cut and dismantled to accommodate the extension of the LSS eastwards. The fact that the mosaiko floor was found to run under the 'stylobate'351 prompted Mirie352 to suggest that the CC had different levels corresponding to the floors in the West Wing. On this theory the basement rooms of the West Wing would originally have stood at ground floor level. There is not, however, much evidence to support it; Evans353 was certain that Neolithic lay under the CC slabs, because of levelling operations before the slabs were laid. However, he found the Egyptian statue354 '.70 cm below the surface on the edge of a small remaining patch of pavement . . .'in 'the clay on which these slabs rested'355 and which clay was sandwiched between the Neolithic and the pavement. It is not clear if this clay was placed in the CC to be used as the bedding for the limestone slabs or if it was part of an earlier level. Even if an earlier level of the CC, it would still be higher than the level of the CPS, since Evans recorded that the depth from the surface to the CC pavement varied from 'a small distance below the surface of the ground to nearly a metre'.356 CIRCULATION IN THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY IN ITS 'PREVIOUS' (THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES) PHASE Access was from the CC perhaps down a staircase. Its height cannot be estimated, but if we judge from the height of the mosaiko floor still visible in the TS area (D) it was lower than it is now (probably only two or three steps). A large door at the foot of the staircase357 led into the LSS, which played a pivotal role for the rooms N, S, and W. Through a polythyron in the N wall one entered a large square room: the GPR and TRR as a single room. Through another polythyron, to the south, the ChTR was reached. One entered the EPC through two or three doors to the west {polythyron effect again) which, like the LSS, played the same pivotal role for the rooms N and W. We do not know if a door in the S wall connected the crypt with the rooms S. One or two doors in the W wall led into the WPC. Through a double door a single room (the VR plus RN) was reached. The space now occupied by Rooms A and B may have been open (a lightwell) with one or more doors leading into the West Magazines. A possible door in the N wall probably led into the Jewel Fresco Room. The lightwell would have lit the room north, the WPC, the VR and the RN; thus changing completely the appreciation of these rooms, now completely dark. In this architectural phase the closing and bolting of the doors becomes meaningful. All the door-jamb bases which have survived show that the doors were locked from the inside. Thus, the LSS becomes completely cut off from N, S, E and W when the doors are shut. In the same 349 Evans 1903-4, 28. 35° Evans 1021, fie. 1^2; 1928, 798. 35' Evans 1903-4, 28; also (AE/NB 1913, 19) where Evans talked of an 'Earlier C.

This cutting off and isolation leads one to the NW sub-unit and through it to the West Magazines; the areas, therefore, to be protected were the NW sub-unit and the West Magazines. It is, thus, evident that the circulation pattern in the CPS in its two last architectural phases has a common feature: the protection of the West Magazines. In the earlier phase, however, the goods delivered in the LSS would have to go through the Crypts into the West Magazines (since the corridor S of the Crypts did not exist); also a working area was situated in what is today the VR and RN, while a lightwell was where Rooms A and B are; and the LSS was smaller in size but had a polythyron in the N wall and another in the S. When the polythyra were closed the LSS was isolated, but when open one would enter a large room N, which may have lead further N (to the Throne Room area) and one room S which may have again led further S and W. The LSS could, thus, become a large space extending N and S. The polythyra would control access and also the direction of movement.358 As Palyvou has stated, the polythyron is usually connected with the Minoan Hall359 opening on to a lightwell or a court.300 In the case of the LSS there is no evidence of either a lightwell or a court, unless one existed in the ChTR (where a column base occupies the centre of a mosaiko floor). Palyvou361 has also stated that there are polythyra which are not connected with lightwells or inner courts; these cannot have been used to control the air and temperature, but to conceal or bring something to view. As Marinatos has pointed out they act as 'screens . . . concealing or revealing a spectacle'.302 If the LSS was not connected with a lightwell or a court, it may be assumed that its polythyra led to rooms in which something important was concealed. The polythyra of room 3 in Xeste 3 in Thera conceal a lustral basin and wall paintings connected to cult.363 By analogy, it is possible that the LSS polythyra hold a clue to where the possible sanctuary of this phase of the CPS was: either S or N. If N and if the TR were in use they may have been connected with cult activities. Were they associated with some craft activities, involving liquids connected with cult, possibly oil or wine? Or is it possible that the TR was an 'adyton'? But it is also possible that the shrine was in the ChTR or on the first floor. The rooms on the ground floor were used for other purposes such as the processing and storing of goods. Recall that the West Magazines are paved with gypsum and their walls are painted in the same way as some of the rooms in the CPS. It is not, thus, surprising that the luxury, seen in the polythyra and gypsum floors of the CPS, is connected with storage or craft activities. Luxury may have implied wealth and a wealthy shrine implies a well-visited shrine and therefore effective deities. CONCLUSIONS ON PHASING Below the gypsum floors of the CPS lies Neolithic material as shown in Chapter 2. The cist and pit in the SW corner of the EPC and the Vat Room Deposit are the only evidence that this area was used during the Old Palace period. During the early period of the later Palace304 the early E façade wall provided the eastern limit of the Central Palace Sanctuary. It is not certain 358 See Marinatos et al. io86, &lt;s8. 359 Palyvou 1987, 199. 360 The arrangement of the polythyra in the LSS recalls that of the Little Palace where two polythyra from N to S are connected to a lightwell which has 'the form of a peristyle court' as pointed out by MacEnroe (1979, 117); on the Little Palace see Hatzaki 1996, 34-4 ^. 361 Palyvou 1087, 200 and n.16. 362 Marinatos et al. 1986, 59. 363 Palyvou 1987, 200; see also Marinatos et al. 1086, 60. 364 Although the same line may have existed during the Old Palace period.</page><page sequence="271">256 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS whether the rooms W of it took their present outlines at the same time or later. The gypsum floors in the LSS and the GPR may have been constructed at this time to go with the polythyra in the N and S walls of the LSS. The TRR and the GPR formed one room; the Temple Repositories may have been constructed at this period and may have served craft activities, probably oil or wine processing. The VR and the RN may also have been one room, lit by a lightwell to the W (later replaced at the final phase by Rooms A and B). The EPC was larger, extending S and including the space now occupied by the S corridor, which was probably created in the final phase. The pillar of the WPC may have been situated beside the pillar in the EPC or in the central square of the LSS. The floor in the WPC had a central square sinking and a border of large slabs. The walls of the EPC (and probably of other rooms) were decorated with white plaster painted red. It is, thus, evident that the architectural plan of the CPS in this phase is very close to the diagrammatic plan Evans365 presented and dated to the 'close of the second Middle Minoan period'. However, the following differences can be noted: i. the N wall of the LSS was a polythyron; ii. the corridor S of the Crypts did not exist and perhaps the EPC had two pillars while the WPC had none; iii. the vats were not placed in the VR until much later; iv. Rooms A and B were a lightwell with doors leading W and N. Finally, there is no evidence that this arrangement belongs to the close of the MM II period. On the contrary, judging from the dates given to the installation of the vats in the VR and the deposit under the threshold of the door leading into the TRR (see Chapter 2), this arrangement belongs to the Second Palace period. The next phase (after the MM IIIb catastrophe) sees the erection of the 'stylobate' and the expansion of the LSS east, the closing of the polythyron in the N wall of the LSS and the construction of the bench against its N wall. The sealing of the Temple Repositories and the erection of the small cists over them, and the division of the room into the GPR and the TRR, may belong to this phase or slightly later. Either at the same time or at a slightly later stage the corridor S of the crypts is created and the pillars are placed in their present position. The vats are inserted in the VR, and so may the vats on either side of the pillar in the EPC; probably the lightwell (Rooms A and B) continues to give light to the VR/RN, in which craft activities would continue the tradition of the Temple Repositories phase. Plaster floors are now laid over the burnt gypsum ones, and it is only the TRR, which has a new gypsum floor, to seal the Temple Repositories and their contents. Later, it too receives a plaster floor, after another catastrophe (in LM II or later) which is also evidenced in the VR. The N wall of the VR is now built, or rebuilt, over the burnt soil next to the vats, and a plaster floor is laid in the EPC and probably the whole area, while less glamorous plasters are placed on the walls in the EPC. The potential doors in the W and N walls of Rooms A and B are blocked, and so may the door in the WPC leading into the Magazines; the creation of the corridor S of the crypts made the doors through the lightwell unnecessary. The lightwell is replaced by Rooms A and B, a gypsum floor is hastily laid in Room A, and, probably slightly later, the cross wall in the RN is built. Only excavation could give an exact date for these alterations. Pithoi were found in four of the rooms of the CPS: eight large pithoi in the GPR, three or four in the LSS, ten in the EPC and one in the VR. If the vats and the pithoi were 365 Evans 192 1, fig. 152, opp. p. 203. Before the 1995 tests I also agreed with Evans, see Panagiotaki 1994, 267-9.</page><page sequence="272">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 257 contemporary they may have both been connected with oil processing. If not, the pithoi may have been used to store objects that were perhaps to be taken out soon after, like the oil recorded in the tablets found in the LSS. It is, then, evident that part of the CPS was used for storage and perhaps craft activities in its final phase. Was it also in previous phases? If the structure at the SW corner of the EPC represents the remains of cists then storage is implied in the Old Palace period. The TR contained 50 large and heavy vases which must have been stored somewhere in the CPS area; storage is, thus, again implied in the New Palace period. This is not surprising, it seems to have been normal to have storerooms in a sanctuary area. The CPS should, thus, not be seen as an area devoted to storage only in its last phase(s). This study has shown, on the contrary, that parts of the area were devoted to storage from the Old Palace period down to the last phase. Moreover, as the tablets found suggest, a lot of the goods arriving at the CPS were offered to deities; they were connected with the shrine. The possibility that part of the area was used for craft activities again from the Old Palace period (evident in the VRD) to the last phase (vats in VR) should not be excluded.

All measurements are in metres. THE FAÇADES BORDERING THE CENTRAL COURT Two phases of façade are visible (FIGS. 50, 57, 58): the later lying to the east of the earlier. The first façade starts at the N with the rounded corner of gypsum blocks at the NE angle of the Throne Room, continues with a single block surviving on the S wall of the antechamber of the same Room, whence it runs continuously from the grand staircase to the S wall of the Great Pithos Room. Here there is an interruption until a door- jamb base appears on line at the foot of the N side of the staircase of the LSS; north of the jamb, there are traces of stone, perhaps the base of the façade (PLATE 31 b), at the appropriate level. From the S wall of the same room the façade can be traced to the SW corner of the Central Court. On a limestone plinth, a line of gypsum orthostats were placed at either side with rubble infilling and wooden ties fitted into mortises cut in their tops. Traces of a mosaiko floor are still visible as irregular limestone slabs (PLAN I; FIG. 50). The new façade (PLAN I; PLATE 30) is a 'stylobate' of limestone blocks. To the south it runs to the SW angle of the Central Court, to the north, to the area of the Throne Room complex. In the CPS area the north part (by the TRR and the GPR) has the character of the verandah (FIGS. 48-9), whilst in the south (by the LSS) this feature has been replaced by an eastward expansion of the LSS. THE LOBBY OF THE STONE SEAT (LSS): HOOD'S ROOM 32 The Room is entered from the Central Court by a flight of stairs sited at the S end of its E wall, and actually lying within the room itself (PLAN I; PLATE 31 b). Taken all in all the room is rectangular measuring E-W 8.42 X N-S 5.29. Analysis of the walls The S and W walls are restored. North wall. L. 8.60 (doors and recess included); 5.80 up to early façade wall lines; H. 1.70-2.00. It is divisible into sections of different character. The easternmost part (PLAN II; PLATE 33 a) forms a recess of c. 1.25 wide and 0.85 deep, which consists of two gypsum blocks bearing traces of burning, the one set on the other. The upper is vertical (and between a block and a slab in thickness 1.35 X 0.90); between and below are a few small stones and slabs (slabs 0.03-0.06 thick). The lower block is not well hewn, whilst the upper one is and carries a depression (0.17 wide, 0.1 o deep) running across its width at its E end. West of this recess, up to the E end of the bench, the wall consists at its base of two courses of limestone blocks interspersed with a layer of smaller pieces, and then a course of two gypsum blocks, in one of which a set of dowel holes indicates that the block has been reused. Above and at the west is a series of badly burnt and cracked gypsum slabs, horizontally placed</page><page sequence="273">258 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS one over the other with mud plaster between to bind them. At this point, two squared gypsum pieces project from the base of the wall: the western is almost hidden by the bench itself (PLATE 33 a; FIG. 54). These are the door-jamb bases (H. of E jamb base 0.09, W jamb base 0.12; they both project from the wall line by 0.08) of a door 0.60 wide. Their rabbets are at their southern ends, which indicates that the door could be bolted and controlled from the N, i.e. from within the GPR. This door was blocked, large blocks are placed between the jamb bases. Set on each jamb base is a vertical slot left by a timber, with its accompanying mud plaster still visible behind the modern concrete repairs Dim: 0.16-0.20; they preserve the position of the door frames. Next is the bench area (PLATES 32 a-b' 33 a). Above much of the bench today the wall is recessed; its visible surface is composed of the same piles of burnt gypsum slabs mentioned before, interrupted at regular intervals by three more vertical slots (o. 17-18 wide). The wall is badly deformed. Beyond the W end of the bench the wall projects forward again, and incorporates reused limestone blocks and irregular pieces of gypsum (PLATE 33 a). This segment, with another at the E end of the bench, defines the above-mentioned recess behind the bench. In this have been set vertically two larger gypsum slabs both burnt (West one: 0.76 X 0.73, East 0.60 X 0.72) (PLATE 33 a). A small patch of greyish plaster is on a gypsum block at the w end of the wall. At the w end of the wall an opening leads into the GPR (0.95 wide); it is fitted with two gypsum door- jamb bases of a different size (L. 0.67, W. 0.20, H. 0.03) from those of the blocked door. The rabbet is on the S end. West wall. (L. 5.20 doors included) has two door openings of similar dimensions which leave only a narrow segment of wall (L. 1.00, H. 0.87, now restored to 3.50) between: both lead into the EPC (PLATE 33 b). Dim. with doors included: L. 5.20; central segment: L. 1. 00; H. 1.60 now reconstructed to 3.50. At the S end of the wall, an opening (1.13 wide) is left between it and the S wall of the LSS. This leads into an E-w corridor running along the S side of both the pillar crypts, and thence via the N-S corridor of the House Tablets into the West Magazines. The segment of wall between the two doors into the EPC is built of rubble masonry. At the centre it survived to H. 1. 30-1. 40, though the present concrete jambs have obscured and Preplaced its ends. The door-jamb bases are in good condition, perhaps they are replacements by Evans. He certainly increased the wall's height considerably in order to construct a ceiling for the rooms further west, but since he did not set it back as was usually the case, the exact original height concerned can only be estimated. South wall. (L. 8.71 doors included, H. 1.30, at gypsum blocks: H. 1.55), as is shown on photographs (PLATES 30; 31 a), did not survive to a great height because of the polythyra. Only at the E part does it survive to a considerable height, where two large gypsum blocks were placed in an overlapping manner at the side of the staircase. Immediately next to them the wall reverts to rubble masonry with reused limestone and gypsum blocks; its original height is uncertain. A vertical slot (0.20 wide, mostly replastered) is preserved here, its timber once set on a sizable, square limestone block. Running west are a series of four doors in a polythyron effect (Dim. from West: i. 0.72 wide; ii. 0.60 wide; iii. 0.73 wide; iv. 1.06 wide; their rabbets are North). Between the middle pair is a short segment of wall (L. 1.20, H. 0.87 now restored to 3.50) similar in size and condition to that already mentioned for the W wall: at least the bottom 0.90 looks original, much else is obscured by cement. Only part of the three W pairs of the door-jamb bases survive today, badly burnt and seemingly corresponding in height to the floor which has, however, been repaired and its level now may not be as the original. East wall line (L. 5.25, H. 1.06) is partly taken up to the south by the staircase leading down from the Central Court into the room (PLATE 31 b). Immediately alongside the N face of the stairs is an E-w bench/balustrade. The wall here forms part of the later 'stylobate': the first 1.25 at the south shows how the 'stylobate' blocks are supported on much smaller stones, in front of which is part of a gypsum dado (L. 1.30, H. 0.94; PLATE 31 b): its top is much restored and thus its original height is unknown. The final northern 1.25 m forms the E side of the recess associated with the N wall described above: a large limestone block again rests on smaller stones. This block lies on an E-W axis (unlike the others, N-s) and it projects westwards across and beyond the N-S width of the 'stylobate' façade proper. It bears deliberate cuts and marks. Its position must be intended too. The balustrade and the northern section of the wall define a kind of dado-lined recess, whose existence is underlined by the separate treatment given to its gypsum floor, of which two kinds are visible. Analysis of the floor The floor may be divided into two zones: the main section to the west is roughly square (3.20 X 2.90) (PLATES 31 b' 32 a' PLAN I), with a second and smaller part to the east, that corresponds with the area opened up in the later phase, after the 'stylobate' façade had replaced the earlier one (PLATE 31 b). The main area is composed of a central square of irregular limestone slabs (ironstone or amygdalopetra) today held in a red-stained cement replacing the</page><page sequence="274">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 259 original red plaster (3.20 X 2.90, largest slab 0.70 X 0.54). The colour of the slabs is grey to pale brown. The NW corner consists of two rectangular gypsum slabs with evident traces of burning, and shattered to small pieces (1.20 X 0.45; 1.00 X 0.60; PLATE 32 a; PLAN 1). They are at the same level as the adjacent gypsum slabs N but are at a lower level than the mosaiko slabs, by 0.02-0.03. Around the mosaiko is a border zone of rectangular gypsum slabs of varying sizes (largest slab 1.36 X 1.22). Those directly in front of the bench appear larger. They run under the bench as is evident at its west. The border slabs seem to have been restored by modern workers, who instead of removing them simply covered them with the modern slabs; on one occasion, a slab in front of the N door into the EPC has only partly been covered by a modern slab of the same material. The slabs in front of the bench are burnt and cracked like the two rectangular slabs in the mosaiko square. The part of the room east of the above pavement and north of the staircase is covered by unburnt gypsum slabs of varying sizes, and seems different in character from the other. The floor in the recess consists of two slabs, that nearer to the N wall of the recess placed higher by about 0.02 thus creating a small step (higher slab 1.08 X 0.42; lower slab 1.19 X 0.91). The floor in front of the dado of the E wall is also placed at a higher level, and consists of different, mainly crystalline gypsum slabs. Analysis of other features The bench (plates 32 a-b' 33 a; FIG. 53) against the N wall (L. 2.67, W. 0.73 as restored, H. 0.45) is constructed in exactly the same manner as those in the Throne Room and its antechamber. Gypsum slabs (at least two) form the top and are supported by set-back sides of similar slabs, worked with a THE NE UNIT Entrance was from the south through the LSS (PLAN I). The N wall of this last shows both in its eastern blocked door and in that at the west that remained open that both the doors had their rabbets on the S pilaster in the middle (0.40 wide) and one at each end (0.35). The balustrade north of the staircase (PLATE 31 b) is a plain structure (L. 1.83, W. 0.46, H. 0.38); vertically set gypsum slabs carry an overlapping seat (Th. 0.10) of the same material. The staircase leading into the room (PLATE 31 b) has been almost entirely reconstructed. Only the (N parts) of the second and third steps (from the bottom up) look original (L. 1.25, W. 0.35, H. 0.12): they seem of the same quality of gypsum as the top slab of the adjacent balustrade. The threshold consists of three irregular thick slabs. The earlier door-jamb base is situated at 2.33 from the S wall (L 1.03, W 0.32). Small fragments of gypsum steps adhere to the S wall of the LSS and are incorporated into the reconstructed steps (one next to the third, and one to the second PLAN I). A gypsum and wood chest which, according to Evans, contained the Linear B tablets. It may be reflected by two rectangular gypsum slabs (PLATE 33 a' FIG. 61) at the foot of the N wall, beside a pithos base. The tablets were mixed with carbonized wood.

Access internally was by walking along the western side of the rooms. There are two square dowel holes in the threshold between the GPR and the TR. THE GREAT PITHOS ROOM (GPR): HOOD'S ROOM 33 A narrow, rectangular room; Dim E-W 6.10 X N-S 2.70. The door at the W end of the N wall of the LSS leads first into the Great Pithos Room. There is both a difference in door width and a variation in the size of the door-jamb bases between this and the blocked one at the E end of the N wall. Analysis of the walls North wall. L. 5.87 (door included); H. E 1.74, w. 2.15, now restored 3.50; Th. 0.60. It is difficult to determine how much is original. It is of rubble masonry; various kinds of limestone; a small block of gypsum exists at the W end. Along the E part of the wall, traces of a plaster dado exist (PLATE 35 a), and</page><page sequence="275">26o THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS there are large fragments between the N wall and the Great Pithos (PLATES 34 b; 35 b). They sit on the gypsum floor slabs indicating that they are part of a plaster floor. A rather large piece of the same plaster is sitting on the floor plaster behind the Great Pithos and it may have originally been part of the wall plaster or dado and has fallen on the plaster floor (PLATE 34 b). A single vertical beam slot lies west of the midpoint of the wall: H. 1.50, W. 0.19. West wall. L. 2.40, H. 1.70 to 2.00, now restored to 3.50. It is shared by both this room and the TR to the north. Of rubble masonry, it contains many gypsum blocks, of which one near the door has a mason's mark (a star and handleless trident) near the S end, and at least three types of limestone. There is a vertical beam slot at the midpoint, which also falls at the side of the opening dividing this from the room to the north, H. 1.50 W. 0.20. At 1.70 a horizontal slot can just be detected in the modern cement. Portions of the same plaster dado and pieces of a plaster floor are visible along the base of the wall. South wall, as N wall of LSS. At three points small blocks of masonry have been erected to act as buttresses. Along the base of the wall pieces of plaster are visible, the same as in the other walls of the room. East wall. L. 2.45, H. at N part 1.30, at S part 1.85, Th. 1. 00. It is formed by the original façade wall along the Central Court, and looks totally unaltered. The lower portions, 2-3 courses, are neatly built with two well- dressed limestone blocks at the base (PLATE 35 a). The original height is largely around 1.30, rising abruptly to 1.85 with the large gypsum block. A plaster dado is also traceable at the very base (surviving to a greater height than on the other walls), heavily cemented in two different stages of modern work L. 2.60, H. 0.07- 0.45, Th. 0.06. The N and S walls butt onto this one. Analysis of the floor Two floors are visible; the earlier is of gypsum slabs heavily repaired with cement. It had been subjected to a fire, as its colour at the west declares, and seems to be on the same level as the burnt slabs in the LSS but smaller. At the NE corner and at other places along the N wall, the floor does not appear to respect the wall- line, but rather seems to run on under it (PLATE 36 b). The plaster floor and dado obscure the junction. The latest floor is of plaster and survives only along the wall lines (PLATES 34 b; 35 a-b' 36 a-b). Analysis of other features In the middle of the room, just south of the Great Pithos there is what was once a rectangular cist or sinking running E-w (L. 1.36, W. 0.42, 0.35 deep; FIGS. 47, 61, 62). Now it has become pinched in at the middle: the partial collapse of the long side at the north has occurred as the gypsum slabs that line its walls and base have gradually decayed. These now survive, fractionally, on the N, E, and W, though hardly at all on the S. The Great Pithos, whose exterior base when measured vertically can be calculated to be below the level of the present stone slabs, though the modern concrete used to hold it in place obscures any more direct observation (PLATES 34 a-b; 35 b). The pithos has had a hole bored at its foot just in front of the sinking. THE TEMPLE REPOSITORIES ROOM (TRR): HOOD'S ROOM 34 A rectangular room; Dim. E-W 6.00, N-S 3.00. This is served by the N-S throughway corresponding to the w side of the GPR, by virtue of the opening at the W end of the S wall. Door-jamb bases are not found, though a threshold of two slabs survives. The smaller eastern one, partly set under the s wall, has been shaped or worn down in the actual doorway, and contains two square dowel holes which might have been used (?re-used) to fix the wooden frame of the opening. Analysis of the walls North wall. L 5.91, H at W part 2.10, at E part 1.50 now restored 3.50. It is of rubble masonry, with many gypsum blocks closely packed in 4-5 courses and containing sizeable pieces. One of these, set lower in the wall, has a group of large dowel holes, obviously a reused block. A vertical beam slot exists in the midpoint of the wall, with hints of its horizontal partner remaining (H. 1.50, W. 0.19). At the NW, at H. 1.60, is a patch of mud plaster (0.90 X 0.40) of the canonical dark-orange of this region. West wall. L. 9.93. It is the continuation of that of the GPR. A gypsum block projects by 0.20 at its foot, too much for any dado or plaster to have completely hidden it; under it there is a horizontal slab running w and a vertical one along its E side (PLAN I). South wall. It is the N wall of the GPR. At the top of the W end is a small block of limestone with a partly preserved, finely cut double-axe, indicating the block's re-use. A vertical beam slot at the rough centre corresponds with that on the S face, H. 1.40. East wall. L. 2.90, H. at N part 1.75, at S part 1.60. It is again the continuation of the interior face of the original E façade. Here the large gypsum blocks at the</page><page sequence="276">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 26l top are lost. The lower limestone block and rubble composition remains. A mason's mark, a trident, is visible at the S end. Analysis of the Floor At the time of the excavation it is evident (PLATE 37 a) that the room was covered with worn gypsum slabs. Traces of these remain along the W and part of the N and S walls: that along the W has what appears to be a neatly-cut step in it. What is now visible along the w part of the N wall and along the w wall is the crystalline type of gypsum. Along the S wall there are two small patches of fine-grained and very worn gypsum. Traces of a plaster dado and perhaps floor are seen along the W part of the S wall, L. 0.82, W. 0.09 maximum. Analysis of other features Smaller cists (PLATE 37 a; FIGS. 51, 55, 56). Today a small cist (L. internal N-S 0.81 E-w 0.38, Depth 0.43-0.45) lies between the two large ones: rectangular, but much reduced in every dimension. A fourth, similarly of minor kind, but larger than the third, was removed in the course of excavating the West Repository, in whose SE corner it lay, L. internal 0.81 square, Depth 0.36. Both consisted of five gypsum slabs (Th. 0.05-0.60) joined to form the base and sides of the cist and with the ends of their longer sides projecting (PLATE 37 a). Though today the sides are quite obviously upstanding, this does not seem to have been so in relation to the contemporary (now removed) floor in the case of the surviving one. PLATE 37 a shows that they were both equipped with various cuts at the tops of the sides, to which some kind of lid might be assumed to have been affixed. West Repository. (FIGS. 55, 56, 63, 64) Internal L. N-S 1.37, E-W 1.72; Depth 1.50. Floor slab of one piece, cut THE W UNIT In the w wall of the LSS there are three openings (plate 33 b): the middle one with that to its N lead down at the centre to create a hollow of 0.28-0.33 depth. Three symetrical holes at centre (slightly to the w; PLATE 37 b): one round (0.06), flanked by two oval ones (0.08 X 0.05). Each side comprises three courses of blocks: N base 1.70 X 0.42, with two dowel holes (1.30 apart; W 0.06 X 0.06, 0.95 deep, E 0.05 x 0.05, 0.09 deep); middle 1.70 X 0.40, with two dowel holes (0.85 apart; W 0.045 x °-°5&gt; 0-085 deep, E 0.045 x 00455 O-IQ deep); top 1.70 X 0.40, no dowel holes. W base 1.40 X 0.42, with two dowel holes (0.51 apart; s 0.04 x 0.04, 0.065 deep, N 0.05 x 0.05, 0.085 deep); middle 1.43 X 0.42, no dowel holes; top 1.43 X 0.42, two dowel holes (0.73 apart; S 0.04 X 0.045, 0.055 deep, N 0.045 x 0-°455 °-°55 deep). S base 1.80 X 0.40, two dowel holes (1.26 apart; w 0.05 X 0.06, 0.10 deep, E 0.05 X 0.05, 0.085 deep); middle 1.77 X 0.42, no dowel holes; top two blocks, on the eastern of which is a slab, W 0.87 X 0.37, two dowel holes (w 0.04 X 0.04, 0.08 deep, E 0.05 X 0.06, 0.08 deep) and E 0.88 X 0.26, with slab of H 0.09-0.10 above. E base 1.40 X 0.43, two dowel holes (0.77 apart; N 0.05 X 0.05, 0.09 deep, S 0.06 X 0.07, o. 1 1 deep); middle 1.38 X 0.40, no dowel holes; top 1.38 X 0.33, two dowel holes (0.89 apart; N 0.06 X 0.045, °-°9 deep, S 0.055 X 0.065, 0.085 deep). East Repository, internal L. N-S 1.90, SE 1.43; Th. o. 13-0. 14; 1.62 deep. The base is a single slab with edges raised by 0.28-0.33. Each wall constitutes two slab components, the larger on the smaller. N lower 1.89 X 0.63; upper 1. 91 X 0.84-0.87; W lower 1.46 X 0.57-0.61; upper 1.87 X 0.97; S lower 1.93 X 0.56-0.58; upper 1. 91 X 0.98; E lower 1.42 X 0.56-0.61; upper 1.46 X 0.93. The N, W, and S upper slabs are cracked and repaired with modern concrete; the lower ones of N and S have an almost vertical and regular crack, as if it is two pieces. Plaster, evident throughout both repositories, seems to have sealed the joins and the two cracks mentioned above. directly into the EPC, and thence to the WPC; the southern one leads into an E-w South Corridor. THE EAST PILLAR CRYPT (EPC): HOOD'S ROOM 30 A rectangular room, it measures: E-w 6.00 X N-S 3.60 (FIGS. 53, 61). Analysis of the walls These differ considerably amongst themselves. North wall. L. 4.90 (two doors included), central segment L. 1.29; H. at E 1.80 to 2.07, at W 1.90+, now restored to 3.50. It has two openings, with a slender piece of wall between, and another such at the E end. E door 1.03 wide; W door 1.07 wide. The original height is hard to estimate as it has been heavily cemented to support the roof at 3.50. It seems to have been around 0.90, though at the east a patch of orange mud plaster at 2.10 shows it could be higher in places. Generally the composition is of rubble masonry, limestone and the occasional massive gypsum block, with traces of fire on its surface. The two doors at either end have high door-jamb bases of gypsum, L. 1.04, W the w jamb 0.45, the E jamb 0.47; H. the w jamb 0.17, E jamb 0.23. The rabbets are at the S side.</page><page sequence="277">262 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS West wall. L. 3.45 (door included); H. at N part 1.85 to 1.78 at S. It has a door at its N, whereby entrance could be gained to the WPG. The rubble masonry is typical, except for the presence of a massive limestone block set high up, at 1.30. It is visible in PLATE 30 sitting uncomfortably on smaller stones. At the base of the wall there are remains of a series of three plaster layers at a distance of one cm from one another (PLATES 39 a-b; 45 a-b). Layer 1. nearest to W wall (0.015-0.02 from the wall space, originally covered by mud plaster) and earliest has white backing and a red face; it curves and it sits (0.12) on the gypsum floor slab adjacent to the W wall (L. 2.25, W. 0.45); L. of red plaster 1.82 with tiny fragments visible near the jamb base of the door into the WPC (Th. 0.015-0.02, H. 0.01-0.07). Layer 2. is of bad quality pinkish plaster with many inclusions (L. 1. 1 2, Th. 0.02, H. 0.03-0.085). Layer 3. as layer 2 in quality (L. 0.46, Th. 0.02-0.023, H. 0.045). South wall L. 4.94; H. at W part 1.10 to 1.17, at E part 1.60. It is much thinner than the others. Although it is made in the same rubble technique, the stones are on the small side and the wall is only some 0.50 thick. No gypsum is included. A vertical beam slot sits roughly in the middle (much restored), but another one is encountered just before the eastern end of the wall, by the door (0.19 wide). This wall butts the W one. East wall L. 3.62. It is the W wall of the LSS. The two doors that connect it with that room are equipped with door-jamb bases of suspiciously good preservation compared with others in the region. Their rabbets are at the E ends, which means that they closed off from within the EPC. The thresholds may have been replaced by either Evans or Platon since they are unusually well preserved. Analysis of the floor The floor consists of gypsum slabs, which survive quite well in front of the doors at the east and by the E flank of the pillar. Some of the worn original slabs have again been covered with modern reconstructions, particularly east of the pillar and in front of the door leading into the WPC. Elsewhere there are worn gypsum slabs, perhaps the original floor of the room. No pattern to their distribution is obvious. At the SW corner is Platon's trench extending from the S wall N and E (PLATES 39 a-b; 45 a-b). It reveals a structure consisting of five horizontal gypsum slabs and two vertical ones, (the one running N-S survives fractionally). Part of the structure extends w under a large gypsum floor slab, running along the W wall, while the easternmost slab of the structure disappears under the modern concrete and gypsum floor slabs running E. If the vertical pair are projected they cross at right angles and create a rectangle of 1.04 X 0.78; but another such could be created N and another E. Their dimensions are: horizontal easternmost slab partly uncovered L. 0.57, W. 0.495, Th. 0.04-0.065; SE horizontal L. 0.73, W. 0.45; SW horizontal L. 0.78, W. 0.62; NE horizontal L. 0.47 (continues under concrete N) W 0.46 maximum; NW L. 0.44 (disappearing under modern concrete N and under the floor gypsum slab w), W 0.25. Vertical slab E-W L. 0.765, Th. 0.055-0.07, H. maximum exposed 0.09; Fragmentary vertical L. 0.16, Th. 0.035-0.05, H. 0.23. Plaster, partly over the remains of the wall plasters, consists of perhaps kouskouras; it extends from the W wall E and covers most of the N part of the wall base; it may be the remains of a plaster floor, L. ?i.io, H. 0.11 maximum (PLATE 45 a-b). Analysis of other features A square pillar of gypsum is set roughly in the centre of the room, as it now measures; H. 1.78, W. 0.62 X 0.56. It is built up of four solid, dressed blocks, burnt almost black in colour (PLATE 38). It lies at 1.38 from N wall, 1.44 from s wall, 2.21 from W wall and 2.31 from E wall. Only four double-axe signs survive now, three on the E side and one on the S; the N side is too worn. Not all signs are the same, one on the second block of the E side and another on the third block look N while the one on the top block looks S; all their stems are turned downwards. There are differences in their size, form (the triangles of the blades are more regular on some than on others) and depth. To both W and E of the pillar, a solid stone vat is set at a level just below the floor slabs. Cut from a single piece of Ailias hill limestone to a rectangular pattern, they are well preserved. The W one measures 0.88 X 0.50, 0.20 deep; the E one 0.80 X 0.53, 0.20 deep. Doors jV Wall two doors. At E: W 1.03; jamb base L. 1.04; W. 0.45 w, 0.47 e; H. 0.17 w, 0.23 E; rabbet at S, 0.07 deep.

North wall. L. 5.05, H. at E part 1.90 to 2.00, at w part 1.65 now reconstructed to 3.50. It is of rubble masonry, none of any substantial size; in the middle stands a vertical beam slot. Plate 32 a gives a good impression of its original height. At the foot, a definite gap is visible between the wall and the edge of the floor slabs perhaps there was a dado there. West wall. L. 3.65, H. at N part 1.65 to 2.00, at S part 1.50. It has some larger gypsum blocks in it, set lower in the wall to the south, but is essentially of rubble.

It is felt that some of the stones in the NW corner demonstrate that the two walls are roughly bonded and therefore of the same date. Also two small stone floor slabs seem to go under the wall near its S end, probably a door existed there in a previous phase, leading into the Long Corridor. South wall. L. 3.77, H. at W part 0.50 to 0.70, at E part 1.40, Th. 0.50. It is mostly reconstructed; perhaps only 2 or 3 courses are genuine and even they could have been much reworked (PLATE 42). The nature of this wall, like the corresponding one in EPC, differs radically from all others in the neighbourhood: it is thinner and composed of smaller pieces without any reused dressed blocks. It is also on a slightly different alignment, turning to the north a little. Near the base at around the midpoint of the wall are some traces of carbonized wood leaking from in between the stones (PLATE 42): perhaps the remains of a vertical beam. At the w end is an opening; it lacks any jambs, but seems to have a kind of threshold still in position. The wall is clearly sitting on what were the border zone slabs of an elaborate slabbed floor. Fyfe noted the irregularity of the floor, see FIG. 53; also PLATE 42. East wall, forms the W wall of the EPC. Some quite large, dressed blocks of limestone are preserved on this face too. The door-jamb bases at the opening are much too large to fit with the present wall dimensions, projecting by up to 0.30-0.35 beyond their width. Analysis of the floor The floor is composed in a pattern of regular slabbing whereby a central square is surrounded by a higher II AND III. THE VAT ROOM AND NW UNIT From the EPC, two doors lead into separate rooms. From the one at the east the Vat Room alone (sub-unit border zone. The central sinking (e-W 3.17 X N-S 2.10), lower by 0.04-0.05, is composed of regular squared gypsum, now rather worn. Fragments survive at nearly all the corners and along the S side, while cement repairs account for the remainder. The border zone (2.40 X 0.70-5) is also made up of square or rectangular slabs of gypsum, ?some of limestone too. Unusually, a single slab makes up most of the slighter southern side (L 2.32 X 0.40). A large slab is also seen along most part of the N wall, and another along the S part of the E side of the room; the N part of the same side is of concrete; the W side consists of smaller square or rectangular slabs. Many of the border slabs are repaired with cement. Analysis of other features The main feature here is the gypsum pillar. H. 1.75, W 0.65 x 0.65; (plate 41 a). It is on much the same E-W axis as that in the EPC, and essentially of the same construction and material, and adorned with the same double-axes. In relation to the sunken portion of the flooring, the pillar stands much closer to the north: 0.37-0.40 from N edge, 0.98 from S edge, 1.08 from E edge and 1.29 from W edge. With respect to the present walls of the room, it lies almost exactly on the midpoint of the N-S axis 1 .42 from N wall, 1.44 from S wall; and 2.30 from E wall and 2.15 from W wall. The base of the pillar rests on a supporting block (PLATE 41 b) that projects out beyond its edges, clearest on the east (by 0.08-0.13); it also stands slightly higher than the floor (by 0.05-0.06). It is not clear if the supporting block is part of an original, Pearlier, floor or an integral part of the pillar itself. Eight mason's marks are now visible on all four sides of the pillar, two on the E side, three on the S (one barely distinguishable), two on the w, and one on the N. They all have their stems turned downwards, except one on the second block of the S side, which has its stem turned upwards. They are not all of the same type: some are bigger or less shallow than others. Against the eastern wall a bench has been entirely reconstructed. It is narrower than the one in the LSS. A small piece of gypsum belonging to the cover of the bench has been incorporated into the SE corner of the concrete cover; L. 1.94, W. 0.35, H. 0.56. Doors S Wall W. 1.33, opening without jambs; threshold: 1.35 x 0.75; E Wall: as w Wall in EPC. ii) is entered whilst the western gives access to a group of four interconnected units (sub-unit iii).</page><page sequence="279">264 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS THE VAT ROOM (VR): HOOD'S ROOM 31 The room is rectangular; Dim. E-W 2.26 X N-S 5.54 (PLAN I; FIGS. 47, 62). Analysis of the walls East wall. L. 5.75, H. at N part 1.93, at S part 1.65. It is rubble, built with small blocks of gypsum and limestone. A vertical beam slot exists in the middle, opposite its equivalent in the w wall (at H.1.60, and 0.19 wide) and traces of a horizontal can be made out in the modern repairs. In the SE corner a patch of orange mud plaster remains, in which are visible sherds including a small cup base with a brown wash. No date is offered from this sherd. North wall. L. 2.26, H. at E part 2.08, at w part 2.22, now reconstructed at 3.50. It is constructed like the E wall. At 1.80 is a line of calcium carbonate (1-7 cm thick). This seems to be a deliberate layer of lime plaster put down to level up or infill a gap connected with a horizontal beam slot which can be detected running just above it at H. 1.84 (near the NW corner). It is represented by a round hole surrounded by mud plaster, the ghost of the wooden beam. Patches of similar mud plaster exist above this level on the wall's face; also a probable transverse beam. West wall. L. 5.55, H at N part 2.49, at S part 1.70. It contains the usual material as well as two larger, dressed limestone blocks at the south, and one of gypsum to the north. There is a vertical slot at the middle with traces of a horizontal one over it at 1.64, and 0.17-0.20 wide. South wall, limited to a small stretch at the east of the doorway, and has been described in connection with the N wall of the EPC. The door-jamb bases are large, and despite their poor condition a rabbet survives at the south, indicating that the VR could be bolted from the inside. Analysis of the floor (PLATE 40) The floor is covered in schist and gypsum slabs. The latter comes in two varieties: a more robust, microcrystalline type and another with larger crystals that disintegrates easily. The threshold has not survived well: traces of gypsum in a disintegrated, even powdery state remain at the periphery, though that at and just beyond the north is firmer; in between is revealed a yellowish soil with tiny lumps of gypsum, charred wood, small sherds and obsidian fragments. Within the room two gypsum slabs at the east are in a poor condition, though a series of four to the west survive better due to their microcrystalline species. Two of these are much more regularly shaped than the others. A concrete patch lies at the centre on the E side, immediately west of the vats, L. 1.20, W. 0.80; (plate 40). A reasonably well-preserved gypsum slab lies beyond, and the remainder of the N part is paved with irregular pieces of schist. Another such turns up in the SE corner, alongside a gypsum fragment. Analysis of other features The cist at the N wall (PLATE 40). This is created by setting into the floor a hollowed out block, some 0.095 thick. Though Mackenzie described it as shallow, it is deeper than the series of vats. Its base is inclined to the centre. It is limestone, which is discoloured a dark-brown to black by the action of heat. At present the preserved heights of the walls, except the E, are lower than the surrounding floors. The NW corner is much higher (fractures suggest that the other sides were once higher and were broken off probably after the cist was burnt and could not be used), and is partly incorporated in the N wall. The distance between cist and N wall is 0.02-0.04, though a stone at the base of the latter projects sufficiently to reach the inside line of the cist (nw). Along the E wall are five more vats (PLATE 40), of varying shapes and dimensions, and all different from that at the N wall. The corners of the room are left free: 0.24 at the N, 0.64 at the S. The vats are all cut from a single block and seem to go in pairs. The two southernmost are of the same shape and, roughly, depth, then the two next also go together; and the northernmost one is completely different. It is the largest, being square in its outline with a circular depression: the SW corner and all the w side are restored; the base has received a coat of cement too. The next is square too, though only the NW corner is not now made up: its depression is squarer. The third is again square with a square depression of less than usual depth (at 0.025); a tnm skin of cement has been applied. The next one is substantially complete too with only the NE corner missing; of the same form as the preceeding, it is deeper (at 0.14). The last vat at the south is essentially the same shape, though the W side of the hollow has hints of a curved line to it; the SE corner is repaired. The material of which they are made appears to be limestone, like the cist against the N wall. In places the E wall stones seem close to overlapping the back of the vats. Cist. Against N Wall, gap of 0.02-0.04 separates the two. L. 1.07; W. 0.79 w, 0.80 e; Depth 0.14 at sw corner, 0.23 at NE, slightly deeper at centre; Th 0.095. Vats: against E Wall.

E-w 2.20 X N-S 536. Analysis of the walls All have been completed in such a manner as makes it difficult to assess their original height. North wall. L. 2.00, H. at E part 1.50, at W part 1.90, now restored to 3.50. It is of rubble in a variety of gypsum and limestone blocks, none of any great size. A small limestone one of irregular shape at the NE corner has mason's marks (a trident is clear, another sign nearby less so). The degree of rebuilding is hard to assess; PLATE 30 shows a substantial height standing, but the present careful standard of construction may imply that Evans dismantled it beforehand. West wall. L. 4.67 (door included), H. at N part 1.53, at S part 1.90. It incorporates larger reused blocks of both stones in its make-up, one of which, a worn piece of gypsum, carries the mason's mark of the 'window' (cross in a square). Near the N end an opening (W. 0.83) leads into a narrow N-S blind corridor: no door ever existed here, there are no jamb bases, but a pier construction of superimposed large gypsum blocks exists instead. Both sides carry mason's marks: the south has a finely cut star, on the north are a pair of antithetically arranged double-axes, both sets are finely cut. Sherds, eg. a footed cup base with a black wash, are visible in the mud plaster between the blocks. The substantial size of the stones makes it likely that the wall here had survived well. Close to the door are four stones of gypsum that are part of or attached to the wall and overlying the floor. Are they part of the original E-W cross wall from which the room took its name? South (SE) wall is the N wall of the EPC. Not as massive in its construction, it shows traces of fire. Patches of orange mud plaster, with a vegetable intermix, survive, as does one with coarse red ceramic pieces at the base. The doorway from the EPC has received huge jamb bases of gypsum, that project out well beyond the actual door itself; their rabbet is at THE NS 'CORRIDOR' A narrow, rectangular room; Dim. E-w 1. 18-0. 85 X N-S 3.90. This short corridor, with an E-W narrow room (Room A) running west from its southern end, forms in plan a kind of inverted gamma around the E and southern limits of Room B. Both elements of the corridor are the south (as seen on the w jamb), again demonstrating that the door could be secured from the inside. On the W jamb of the door is preserved evidence of a device connected with the doorframe. This once comprised two wooden planks, their reverses left rough (to judge from marks left in the mud plaster that supported them), which were placed flat either side of a low projecting ridge. A horizontal piece of mud plaster may carry the impression of the lintel. East wall. L. 4.69, H. at S part 1.57, at N part 2.34 is the w wall of the VR, with well dressed and carefully laid stones in it. A vertical beam slot holds its midway position, with a horizontal one above at 1.60. At the top of the vertical one is a block with a handleless trident on it; slightly higher patches of orange mud plaster survive. Analysis of the floor Like the floor of the VR, a combination of schist and gypsum slabs is used. In this instance the schist ones are concentrated in the region of the doorway from the EPC, the space S of the crosswall: a certain degree of what could be deliberate patterning is observable. Across the width of the door, functioning as a threshold, runs one slab, to which two more are set at right angles, followed by another large one parallel to the first. Beyond are two rows of smaller segments (three in each). At the far N end come three small pieces of gypsum of irregular size and arranged N-S. All the rest of the area was left bare, or is so today. Analysis of other features A long, but low bench runs along much of the E wall, L. 3-93&gt; W. about 0.80, H. 0.12. It is made up of three larger and two smaller pieces that range in size from thick slabs to slim blocks. The material is the microcrystalline variety of gypsum, with its mineral structure much destroyed. The smaller pair, nearest the entrance, are in poor condition and cemented as a result. The middle slab, complete, seems to run back slightly under a wall stone, and thus ought to indicate a relative sequence. today blind. The arrangements of the passages into it from the RN and into Room B separate off a northern element into a kind of deep cupboard. This is today full of large stones and blocks of several calibres and materials that inhibit exploration. There appears to be a high proportion of gypsum blocks present in the walls.</page><page sequence="281">266 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS West wall. L. i.n to N, 0.69 to s, H. 1.45. It has two courses many with mason's marks: a pair of stars on the lowest, of 4-leaved branches above. East wall. L. 2.53, H. at N part 1.80, at S part 1.60. It has at least one 'window' sign. To the south of the doorway, the E wall is composed of smaller stones with clear evidence of cementing. ROOM A A narrow, rectangular room; Dim. 5.00 X 1.32. This turns off at a right-angle from the above corridor. The opening is in no way emphasized and no doorway exists. In width, it is a little broader than the N-S corridor. South wall. L. 5.09, H. at W part 1.55, at E part 1.65. It is neatly constructed, making use of many sizeable blocks in a careful, coursed effect. Many gypsum ones carry mason's marks: four double-axes, of which two are larger and more deeply cut. North wall. L. 4.18, H. at E part 1.67, at W part 1.45. It is less massive, with few gypsum blocks. West wall. L. 1.32, H. 1.30. It seems variously composed: the southern part employs the large stones ROOM B A square room; Dim. E-W 3.48 x N-S 2.68. Entrance is again by means of an opening, without any door-jamb bases and with a pierhead construction. The room itself is squarer than the others in the region. Analysis of the walls North wall. L. 3.31, H. at W part 1.90, at E part 2.10. It is made of small-size rubble, of limestone and gypsum; the remains of a plaster lined horizontal beam slot are visible, of which one side at least was curved and a vertical equivalent of which lies at the midpoint of the wall. Here there may have been a door connecting Room B to the Jewel Fresco Room: there are suggestive vertical alignments (PLATE 44 b). North wall. L. 1.12. South wall. Part of the S wall of Room A. The floor is mainly of soil but near the entrance to Room A there are fragments of gypsum slabs, of the same type as the slabs in Room A; conical cups were collected from cleaning this S part of the corridor. seen in the S wall, whilst to the north only smaller ones exist in a relatively loosely-packed condition, with carbonized remains in a vertical alignment. A possible vertical beam slot may exist, or alternatively some kind of infilling of the N side may be responsible for this impression (PLATE 43 a). Might there once have been a doorway here, leading into the Long Corridor of the West Magazines? The floor is of gypsum slabs of small size and hastily applied (plate 43 b). At the w end there is a rectangular space, which is free of floor slabs. In the middle of it there is a large schist slab and another one was found nearby, perhaps they are part of a schist floor, laid over the gypsum one. West wall L. 2.70, H. at S 1.50, at N part 1.90. It is similar in both respects, though with larger blocks at its lower levels. The NW corner is rounded by the presence of mud plaster and some soil. South wall, the N wall of the E-W Corridor. This face seems to survive to a greater height, but in a worse condition. East wall. L. 1.93, H. 1.55. It is the w wall of the NS Corridor. The larger gypsum blocks were there commented upon, and smaller limestone ones also exist. Analysis of the floor This seems to be simply of soil with a few slabs along the S part of the W wall (PLATE 44 a) and one slab at a lower level at NW and NE corners perhaps used as supports for wooden beams. THE EW CORRIDOR, SOUTH OF THE CRYPTS At present this is entered through an opening at the S end of the w wall of the LSS; a set of jamb bases show from their rabbets that the door was controlled from the west (i.e. from within the corridor). It provides a direct route to the West magazines from the LSS. The width of the corridor is some 1.30; its length E-W 12. Analysis of the walls South wall, contains many reused blocks of gypsum, it is typical of all the rubble ones in the area that employ reused material. North wall, on the other hand is different: it is the S wall of the E and WPC. A huge limestone block is set at the base of the N wall and projects out into the corridor; it has two dowel holes one at each end. Analysis of the floor This is paved in gypsum: the slabs to the east are larger and more rectangular in comparison with the more irregular pieces to the west. Some slabs have a N-S orientation, while others have an E-W. Some may be replacements.</page><page sequence="282">ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 267 THE TRIPARTITE SHRINE (TS): HOOD'S ROOM 35 Nothing now remains. The area in question covers some 5.75 of the N-S stylobate to the N of the stairway down into the LSS from the Central Court. The extent of the gap between stylobate and earlier façade wall is 1.65. For the particulars of the size and positioning of the so-called 'disks' for the columns see PLAN I; and FIGS. 51, 58, 59. As the 'stylobate' exists today the supposed four bases, on Evans's reckoning, are barely visible. In front of the recess with the mosaiko floor by the GPR (the N wing of the TS) are two circular features. That to the north is slightly raised in relation to the stone surface immediately around it, but not more so than other areas a little further off in the same block, where sub-circular forms are most probably natural features. Two more semicircular marks are evident at the end of the same stretch of the stylobate just by the entrance marked by the staircase into the LSS. These are far harder to trace with any degree of certainty. They appear on a single block, their position being indicated by part of an arc at the front (e) side of the block. They are again of roughly the same dimension and position. The central portion of the TS cannot be identified. Although its position would lie on the sizeable limestone block, already described, that projects into the recess at the NE corner of the LSS. The interior of the TS cannot be reconstructed. Today the floor level immediately behind the façade-line differs greatly between the north portion, where the mosaiko pavement is preserved but a few cm below the CC, and the southern, where the gypsum paving of the LSS is about a metre lower.

PHASING Under all the Minoan levels lie Neolithic. Under those Minoan floors which have been removed1 ceramics and animal remains have been retrieved belonging mainly to Neolithic. No structures have been associated with these remains, which may reflect levelling operations at an early date in the Minoan era. This is compatible with earlier evidence.2 The earliest surviving Minoan stratum incorporates Pre- and probably early First Palace material (EM-MM Ib). The most important deposit is that from the VR.3 Most of the other deposits (excepting that of Hutchinson and Platon) contain mainly Neolithic pottery.4 It is difficult to relate the VR deposit to any structural features except the pit that contained it. The deposit recovered by Hutchinson and Piaton5 was found, during my own excavation, to be associated with a structure of horizontal and vertical slabs, probably the remains of one or more cists. The earliest structure found in the CPS, it is associated with MM Ia and, probably, Ib vases.6 The slabs themselves and the material under them are heavily burnt, a sign of their violent destruction by fire, perhaps the same that destroyed the VRD material. The earliest extant architecture is, according to Evans, part of a gypsum façade wall that runs along the E side of the later TRR and GPR up to a door-jamb at the N side of the stairs, known as the early E façade wall. This wall seems to have been associated, at some time, with at least two further elements: the mosaiko verandah, and, probably, a staircase7 descending from the Central Court, closed by a door at its base, as the door-jamb base at its foot would suggest. Evans seems to have dated this architectural phase to the First Palace. But, without soundings along the early E façade wall, we cannot choose between the First Palace period or the beginning of the Second.8 The next phase saw the Temple Repositories, in use, before LM Ia.9 The early E façade provides the eastern limit. The LSS will have been smaller, the limits set out by the rectangular border-and-mosaiko; the central square could have been of gypsum slabs 1 See Chapter 3. 2 Evans 1921, 34; Hood 1974, 34. 3 See Chapter 3. 4 See Chapter 3. 5 Platon 1954, 433; Hutchinson 1962, 165; Cook 1946,117. 6 See Chapter 2. 7 The staircase was probably lower than it has been recostructed. 8 Niemeier (1994, 79) sees it as 'early MM IIP. 9 See Chapter 3.</page><page sequence="286">272 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS originally, since two of them survive at the NW corner. Access to the south from this room was through a polythyron, as it was too to the north, whilst a double doorway into the Crypts at the west gave a similar effect. The TRR and the GPR were a single room with gypsum floors, and the ChTR must have been another impressive room. Probably the VR and RN were a single room; as were the NW sector Rooms A and B.i0 Room B may have been a space open to the sky: a lightwell.11 The presence of a lightwell corresponding to Rooms A and B could immediately alter our appreciation of the now dark rooms in this region, as they would all be lit: the VR and RN (a single room), the EPC and the WPC as well as perhaps the rooms N of B. The architectural plan of this phase recalls the diagrammatic plan, which Evans12 presented as of MM II date but with a few differences: i. the corridor S of the Crypts did not exist; ii. the NW section was a lightwell; iii. the N wall of the LSS was a polythyron. This arrangement belonged to the Second Palace, not to the First. This phase ended with a destruction evident in the gypsum floors in the LSS and the GPR and perhaps in the TR material, although this last could be the result of a later destruction. An extensive rebuilding campaign followed,13 but it is not clear which walls were affected. Most contain reused gypsum blocks and it is possible that all these were rebuilt. Probably the wall now separating the TR from the GPR was erected, since material collected from under the threshold into the TR, which seems to go with the N wall, is contemporary with the TR finds. The polythyron on the N side of the LSS was infilled now or later. The polythyron on the S side leading into the ChTR was narrowed, and the ChTR probably changed its form. The 'stylobate' façade along the W part of the Central Court was probably put up. A Tripartite arrangement was given to the façade, with the area of the LSS as the central part, flanked by two niches or verandahs, the N one to the east of the GPR and the TR, and the S one, east of the narrow room east of the ChTR. The LSS accordingly lost its earlier E wall-line and the door, but was expanded to the east into the area occupied previously by the verandah.14 The vats were inserted in the VR at this time and probably the vats in the EPC. It would be easiest to see the S wall of the Crypts moved north at this time, to create space for the new E-W Corridor, which leads to the Corridor of the House Tablets and the West Magazines. But this could be later, since this wall does not contain any reused blocks, in contrast with all the others. A later catastrophe is evident in the VR, as all the vats were heavily burnt. The door at the SW corner of the WPC might have been blocked at this time (or later) as well as the possible doors in Rooms A and B, one leading to the Long Corridor, another to the Jewel Fresco Room. In the same Rooms there may have been other changes. This is only suggested because of the pierhead construction visible, recalling similar examples in the rooms behind the Throne Room, dated probably to LM II-IIIa. The wall, which dissected the RN, may be even later. FUNCTION Little can be said about the use of the CPS in the First Palace period, since we have only deposits. The VRD gives us some indication. 10 Evans 192 1, fìg. 152, opp. p. 203. " See Phasing above. 12 Evans 192 1, fig. 152, opp.p. 203. 13 Evans 1921, 317; 1928, 798. 14 Evans 192 1, fig. 152, opp.p. 203.</page><page sequence="287">CONCLUSIONS ON THE PHASING AND FUNCTIONS 273 If the VRD were directly connected with construction activity, it could be considered a foundation deposit or, perhaps better, shrine offerings no longer needed and used as a foundation deposit. As it is, objects both offered at a shrine and utilized in it were caught up in a destruction, by fire, as is evident in a few of the vases and from the charred wood, ashes and fragmentary objects in vase 6. The inclusion in the VRD material of items (e.g. an ivory figurine, whole vases, many in matching sets, gold, inlays, sealings, ostrich egg), some of which could still be used, and the fact that everything was put in a pit together, point to their cult associations: perhaps a cult burial. The unfinished artefacts and the copper slag may imply that a working area was under the aegis of the shrine. The figurine arm included in the deposit suggests a female deity or priestess: a forerunner, perhaps, of the faience figurines in the Temple Repositories. As ivory is a costly material, much used in palaces, she is in keeping with the other luxury products in shell, rock crystal, gold and faience. If the shrine was connected with a working area, could the figure have been the protectress of the craftsmen? If the structure associated with the material, which Hutchinson and Platon15 found in the EPC, was a cist(s), the EPC may have been the treasury of the VRD shrine in the First Palace period. The sacral character of the Second Palace finds is self-evident.16 In no other Minoan context have so many faience figurines of this quality been found together. These elaborate figures are manufactured using costly processes; their dress is fit for a palace context, and their attributes indicate supernatural beings, rather than ladies of the court. Who they actually represent (deities, votaries or attendants) may never be known. The figurines' association with animals, as kourotrophoi, is given weight here. This maternal and nurturing side of nature is also apparent in the faience plaques with animals suckling their young, as well as in the faience representations of flowers and buds: the theme of adult and young in harmony is manifest in many of the faience objects. Their cult or religious associations are confirmed by the set of 'tables of offering' and, to a degree, by all the luxury goods accompanying them to their last resting place. Though the rich furnishing of their shrine is clear, other crucial matters remain unanswered. Where was it situated? Of how many rooms was it composed? What did it look like? Evans argued that the two pillar crypts and their surroundings might be called 'the House of the Double Axes'.17 He saw the WPC as the actual shrine because the double-axe was incised 'on all four sides of the pillar' and because the room was empty in contrast with the EPC which contained many pithoi.18 He viewed the vats in the EPC as associated with 'offerings or libations'19 and 'the pillars thus marked with the sign of the God are in fact his aniconic images'.20 Later he believed that the pillar crypts were 'only crypts of a columnar sanctuary above', supporting the columns on the upper floor, from which 'the bases of two upper columns were actually found precipitated into the entrance lobby that borders the EPC on this side'.21 However, no clinching argument can be put forward either for or against the cult or religious functions of the two crypts (in the TR phase), and at the same time no other rooms in 15 Hutchinson 1962, 165; Platon 1954, 433. 16 See Chapter 3. 17 Evans 1899-1900, 32. 18 Evans 1 899-1 900, 34. 19 Evans 1900-1, 28. 20 Evans 1901, 99-204. 21 hvans 1921, 425.</page><page sequence="288">274 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS the area can be proposed as the potential shrine. One point that should be emphasised is the existence of two polythyra in the LSS leading N and S. Could these hold the key to the location of the shrine? Was it situated in the TRR, or further N, or in the ChTR? The location of the shrine regrettably remains uncertain. Also an open question is the function of the TR in this phase. Were they an adyton or were they used for activities involving liquids as the careful construction, plaster lining and the perforations in the WTR would suggest? A Tripartite Shrine, probably placed at the front of the E façade, cannot be completely ruled out, for Evans mentioned a fresco fragment, reminiscent of the Temple Fresco, which was discovered under the 'stylobate' near the SW corner of the CC.22 The fact that it was found under the 'stylobate' suggests that this was earlier than the Tripartite Shrine he restored. If there was a working area attached to the Palace shrine, the Temple Repositories (and probably the cists N of them) might be viewed as working equipment. For which products cannot now be told. Oil, wine or perfumed oil are possibilities. For the last phase of use Evans argued23 for a Tripartite Shrine, its façade positioned on the new 'stylobate' line and partly occupying the space where once the mosaiko verandah ran. The existence of this shrine at ground floor level cannot be proved (see TS section). Evans had also argued24 that the Pillar rooms '. . . were certainly bound up with some sacral usage, and may be regarded as the 'crypts' of upper halls devoted to religious purposes'. Could a shrine exist on the first floor in the final phase after the closing of the Temple Repositories? The finds belonging to this last phase do not point to cult, with but two possible exceptions. First the sealings recovered from the space behind the Tripartite Shrine frontage, which had clearly fallen from above,25 and second the stone and faience vases,26 also fallen from above, in the Stone Vase Room. The majority of these vases (9 out of 16) are rhyta: three in the shape of a lion's or lioness' head, and one a triton shell. These, especially the rhyta, would be most at home in a shrine. If indeed fallen from above, they could indicate the presence of a shrine or sacred storage area. Evans originally dated some of these vases to MM IIIb, with one as LM Ib or even LM II. 27 Could they be from a (LM Ia/b) sanctuary replacing the Temple Repositories? The fact that they were not buried in the final ruins of the palace may argue against this. Finally, the two stone column bases fallen from above into the LSS must denote a structure of some quality there. It is likely that they were set above the LSS and that this is why they both have ended up in it. But equally in the LSS there are no signs of support at that level for these columns, unless they were situated above the line of the lower walls. Their reinforcement during the great rebuilding, namely the closing of the polythyron of the N wall and the reduction of the polythyron in the S wall, would thus be explained. For many scholars the large number of pithoi in the CPS points simply to storage. The discovery of vases and pithoi should not count against accepting the sanctity of a place. After all the TR contained about fifty vases. Where were these housed if not in the actual shrine or 22 Evans 1928, 803. 23 Evans 1909, 292-3. 2* Evans 1909, 291-2. 25 Evans iqoo-i, 20, fig. q. 26 Evans 1928, 820-2, figs. 537-9, 542 (a, b), 543-5 (AE/NB 1900, 43, 45, 15-16 April): A fine steatite jar with lid found here half-way down and other pieces . . .'; Hallager argued that they were stored in the room they were found in (Hallager 1987, 172 n. 35). 27 Evans 1928, 822-4; Warren 1969, 84 and 91, dates the manufacture of such rhyta and shell-vase to MMIIlB-LMI, but places these specimens, from their context, as being used in LMII-IIIai.</page><page sequence="289">CONCLUSIONS ON THE PHASING AND FUNCTIONS 2J5 the rooms with it? Vases and pithoi may be taken as an indication of the success a shrine has in attracting things of value. The traffic in oil and perfume recorded in the tablets28 from the LSS, which also list names and destinations, can be taken in various ways, but may offer some explanation of the contents of the pithoi. They could be receptacles for 'taxes' or gifts for the shrine. To conclude, the Central Palace Sanctuary Area may have been that region which housed the central palace shrine or shrines29 from its very beginning (in the Vat Room Deposit), and continuing into the Neopalatial phase (Temple Repositories). It cannot, however, be decided which rooms were used as the focus for worship. In the last (Postpalatial) period of use, cult figures are lacking and therefore, on Renfrew's definition30 of a cult place, there is no evidence of cult suggested by the finds, unlike earlier. Note, however, first that the CPS area was twice, successively, used for the burial of religious material. Unlikely to be a coincidence, the deposition of earlier religious material (perhaps a foundation deposit) together with the reconstruction of the shrine, is a consciously significant action. Secondly note the stone vases (and one of faience) together with a marble hand in the Stone Vase Room, which may have fallen from a shrine treasury above.31 Indeed, their forms and quality suits such a context, and compare the finds in much the same position within the W wing at Zakro.32 Their date ( MM IIlB-LM IB, or LM II)33 leaves open whether they belong to the Neopalatial phase (with the Temple Repository material) or after it. Recall also the sealings34 depicting an epiphany of the goddess in front of her shrine; even if the sealings were not directly connected with cult, the ring impressing them might have been. They too had fallen from above. The imposing staircase to the north of the CPS, with columns, as well as the column bases, which had fallen into the LSS,35 all further support the idea of an important locus above. In this light, the pillars of the two crypts could have been installed for structural support, assisted in their role by the double-axes cut into them. Evans may have been right in locating the scene depicted on the Temple Fresco in the CPS area. After all, this is the only area to have produced figurines with supernatural attributes and the only area with evidence for cult continuity. Their link with the West Magazines suggests that the wealth stored there may have been related to and dependent on the fortunes of the Sanctuary. If so in the First and Second Palace periods, could this have continued thereafter? It would have served the interests of anyone controlling the Palace, Minoan or Mycenaean, to maintain a means of attracting wealth. I prefer to see matters thus, and assume the destruction of the Palace still allowed time to remove the cult figures and their trappings, be it by the hands of pious worshippers or the more profane ones of plunderers. No interment followed this upheaval, unless the CPS still holds a major secret, and the vases in the Room of the Stone Vases remain the only possible indicators of a shrine of the period. a8ChadwickiQ7i, 168-81. 29 I am using the term the Central Palace Shrine because there is no evidence for any other major shrine in the Palace. 30 Renfrew 1085, 11-21. 31 Evans 1928, 820-3; in 1899-1900, 31, he recorded a marble-hand of which there is no other mention: 'A marble hand, apparently belonging to a female figure, was also found here. No other part of this figure, which must have been about half life-size'. 32 Platon 1 97 1, 262. 33 Evans 1928, 822-4. 34 Evans 1 900-1, 29, fig. 9. 35 Evans 1921, 441, fig. 318.</page><page sequence="290">276 THE CENTRAL PALACE SANCTUARY AT KNOSSOS Was the shrine removed to another part of the Palace? No evidence supports this contention. The Double-Axe Shrine in the SE part of the Palace,36 with its clay bell-shaped idols, is an anticlimax, which took over when the CPS was destroyed. Thus, until a major shrine of the last phase is found in the Palace area, the CPS should be accepted, in view of its history, as the most appropriate centre for a continuing focus of religious interest. The tiles discovered S of the ChTR are seen as ritual ones, ranging in date from Geometric to 2nd century BC. If the CPS remained free of buildings throughout the centuries with this one exception immediately to its S, namely a building with religious connections of Geometric to second century BC date, then some cult continuity in the area seems undeniable. 36 Evans 1928, 335-44. 37 Callaghan 1978, 186-7.</page><page sequence="291">Appendix I Analysis of Metalworking Residue from Knossos The sample from the Ashmolean Museum collections was kindly analysed by Dr P. Northover, of the Department of Metallurgy and of Materials Science, Oxford. Permission for the work was given by Mrs A. Brown, of the Museum. My thanks to both. The following is taken from the report submitted by Dr Northover. A small lump was submitted for analysis. It is believed to be from the Vat Room Deposit, Knossos. About iomm across, the piece was ground flat on one side, hot mounted in copper- filled acrylic resin, ground and polished. The sample was examined under the optical microscope and analysed using the CAMEBAX automated electron probe microanalyser at the Department of Materials Science, Oxford. Two areas, each 50 microns square, were analysed; the sample was then reground and polished and a further optical microscope examination was made, but no new structure was observed. The mean of the two analyses is: 16.39% Fe; 24.22% Cu; 3.94% As; tr Sb; tr Au; 0.15% S; balance: O, Ca with a small quantity of Si. The microstructure of the sample indicated complete corrosion of either metal or slag. In either case the sample indicates the working of arsenical copper in crucible-based process. The probabilities tend to be in favour of the sample originally being metal rather than slag, despite the high iron content. If the sample had been of slag it would be expected that rather more structure would have survived despite generally poor preservation of slag in the Knossos area. The iron and calcium would have been picked up from the groundwater but the metal itself might have had a significant iron content, perhaps up to 1%. However, the possibility of the sample being a crucible slag cannot be ruled out. The technology reflected by the sample is typical for a number of Mediterranean areas at the end of the 3rd millennium and into the 2nd millennium BC. P. N. Appendix II Animal bones, retrieved from Test Pit at the SE corner of the West Pillar Crypt, excavated by Evans. Stored at the Stratigraphical Museum, Knossos. Summary of a Report by Prof. G. Nobis, from the German. From the 375 bones (mainly fragmentary), 142 could be safely identified while 92 vertebrae and ribs can only be judged to be from 'bovids'. The range of identified species includes Bos primigenius, Bos taurus and the domesticated ox: a species that seems part way between Bos primigenias and Bos taurus was recognized. Sheep and goat, wild and domesticated pig complete the list. The majority of the bones, 87%, come from domesticated animals; 13% from wild fauna.
