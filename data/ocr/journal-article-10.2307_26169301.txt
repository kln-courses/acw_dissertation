Melvin Tandelta Mike Rains TK Holdings Inc ABSTRACT Throughout the first decade of the twenty first century, large improvements in occupant safety have been made in NASCAR®'s  (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc) race series. Enhancements to the occupant restraint system include the  development and implementation of head and neck restraints, minimum performance requirements for belts and seats and the  introduction of energy absorbing foam are a few highlights, among others. This paper discusses nineteen sled tests used to analyze  hypothesized improvements to restraint system mounting geometry. The testing matrix included three sled acceleration profiles, three  impact orientations, two Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) sizes as well as the restraint system design variables.

In 2007 NASCAR required a minimum six point seat belt restraint, The driver was an otherwise healthy 26 year old male weighing 182  which consisted of two shoulder belts, two lap belts and two pounds (82.7 kg) and 70 inches (1.78 m) tall. The driver was seated  anti-submarine belts. The purpose of this requirement was to improve in a composite seat and utilized a six point restraint system with a  pelvic restraint during frontal and frontal oblique impacts thereby HANS head and neck restraint device. This type of driver restraint  system and its effectiveness has been detailed in previous  reducing occupant chest loading. Specifically, the six point restraint  system replaced the single negative G belt, commonly referred to as publications [2,3,4,5,6]. The driver returned to regular racing activity  13 weeks after the on-track incident. Each NASCAR National Series  the fifth point, with two anti-submarine belts, also commonly referred  to as sub or crotch belts. The two anti-submarine belts have been race vehicle is equipped with an onboard IDR (Incident Data  Recorder) [7].

Setup parameters for all sled tests are shown  in Appendix A. The Takata sled is supplied by Instron Structural  Testing Systems. It utilizes a servo valve to control hydraulic flow to  achieve the desired acceleration pulse. This system also has pitching  (vertical axes) capabilities which were not used for these tests. The  sled has 562 kips (2.5 MN) of thrust and can achieve a peak  acceleration of 90 G's with an 1,100 lb (500 kg) payload. The  maximum system horizontal stroke is 67 inches (1.7 m) and the  maximum horizontal system velocity is 50 mph (80 kph).  Acceleration pulse matching accuracy is better than 2.0 G RMS at  greater than 80 Hz. Figure nine illustrates how accurately the target  pulse was achieved.

The loose shoulder belt condition was achieved by placing a 1.0  inch diameter metal dowel between each shoulder belt and the  HANS device during the ATD installation and belt tightening. The  dowels were then removed prior to the test. The loose anti- submarine belt condition was accomplished by adding 1.0 inches of  webbing length to the nominal measurement between the mounting  location and the metallic anti-submarine cam lock hardware. All  other restraint system belts were tight for these tests. It is important  to note that with the loose anti-submarine belt test, the shoulder  belts could not be normally tightened without the cam lock rising  significantly into the ATD abdomen, due to the loose condition of  the anti-submarine belts. Care was taken on this test to maintain the  appropriate position of the cam lock, which therefore resulted in  shoulder belts which were less tight. The test with the Belt Fit listed as, “Incident” was a test to most  appropriately replicate the anti-submarine belt fit from the human fit  check to the ATD.

Vertical Sled Tests While confidence was gained that moving the anti-submarine belt  mounts rearward and outward was a robust solution to reduce ATD  chest displacement, concern was developed that a six-point restraint  system with the new rearward and outboard anti-submarine mounts  could increase occupant excursion out of the seat during vertical, or  rollover type impacts. To assess the magnitude of this effect three  vertical sled tests were conducted as previously described. Two six-point restraint system tests (tests #17 and #18 - Appendix A)  were run, one with the subject vehicle anti-submarine mounting and  one with the new rearward and outboard anti-submarine mounting. A  third test (test #19 - Appendix A) was run with the anti-submarine  belts in the new rearward and outboard mounts, but with the addition  of a negative G belt (7th point).
