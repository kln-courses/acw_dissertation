<plain_text><page sequence="1">Creolizing the Roman Provinces JANE WEBSTER Abstract "Romanization," a concept first discussed by the Brit- ish scholar Francis Haverfield in 1905, remains the domi- nant model for intercultural change in the Roman prov- inces. Building on recent critiques of Romanization, this paper suggests that Romanization-which is simply ac- culturation-has merits as a means of envisaging the pro- cesses by which provincial elites adopted the symbols of Rome, but that the concept is fundamentally flawed when applied to the majority populations of the provinces. Drawing on developments in Caribbean and Ameri- can historical archaeology, it is suggested that the Ro- man provinces may more usefully be regarded as creolized than as Romanized. Creolization, a linguistic term indi- cating the merging of two languages into a single dia- lect, denotes the processes of multicultural adjustment (including artistic and religious change) through which African-American and African-Caribbean societies were created in the New World. It is argued here that a cre- ole perspective may fruitfully be brought to bear upon the material culture of the Roman provinces. Taking aspects of Romano-Celtic iconography as a case study, it is argued that a creole perspective offers insights into the negotiation of post-conquest identities from the "bottom up" rather than-as is often the case in studies of Romanization-from the perspective of provincial elites.* "Romanization," a term first used by Francis Hav- erfield,' defines the process by which the Roman provinces were "given a civilization."2 It remains the dominant concept in the analysis of Roman provin- cial culture, but has recently been subjected to sus- tained critique, particularly in Britain.3 These crit- icisms have emerged for several reasons, but taken together they demonstrate that Romanization is a simplistic and outmoded model of provincial cul- ture change. Despite a decade of discussion on the weakness- es of the Romanization model, work to replace it * I should like to thank David Mattingly for his comments on earlier drafts of this paper, and for his enthusiastic encour- agement of my work on creolization. Many thanks to the staff of the Department of History, University ofWest Indies (Mona Campus, Kingston,Jamaica), who also encouraged my interest in the application of creole models to the Roman world.

I have chosen here to focus on the development of Ro- manization studies in Britain, since British scholarship has had a particular influence on the study of Romano-Celtic art and iconography, the theme of my case study. The history of Gallic has only just begun. New studies are now emerg- ing,4 focusing on the capacity of individuals to find their own way of "becoming Roman" (or not). This work shares some fundamental characteristics with the present paper, which contributes to the replace- ment of Romanization by putting forward a new framework for the analysis of contact and culture change within the Roman provinces. This frame- work is termed creolization. In order to build something new it is helpful to reflect on the factors informing the demise of the old. The first part of this paper therefore reviews the historical origins of Romanization and ex- plores the criticisms subsequently leveled against it. Several of these studies have incorporated his- toriographical analysis,5 and it is not my aim to re- tread that ground. My purpose here is to review the decline of Romanization in order to propose a new model. Thus, in the central section of this paper I suggest a new approach to Roman Britain, moving beyond the simplistic notion of Roman- ization as a civilizing process, emulated at all lev- els of society. Building on my recent work,6 which has borrowed from developments in Caribbean and American historical archaeology, I suggest that we should think of the societies that emerged in the Roman provinces not as Romanized, but as creolized. Finally, these arguments are drawn togeth- er in a case study on the creolization of religion in Roman Gaul. ROMAN VIEWPOINTS ON ROMANIZATION We have a reasonably good sense of metropoli- tan Roman thinking on cultural interaction with provincial populations, and of the importance that the Romans attached to the dissemination Romanization studies, from the influential early work ofJul- lian (1908-1926) and de Coulanges (1891) to more recent work by Goudineau (1979), Clavel-Leveque (1989), and oth- ers, is usefully summarized by Woolf (1998, 1-23). 4Recent studies include Barrett 1997a, 1997b; Forcey 1997; Jones 1997. Two recent collections (Webster and Cooper 1996; Mattingly 1997) have also explored new approaches to identi- ty in the Roman provinces. 5Richard Hingley's work has been particularly important in this context.

Together with this civilizing ethos, on the other hand, went an ap- proach to cultural interaction guided by politi- cal pragmatism. It had been understood from the time of the conquest of Italy that political and cultural assimilation went hand in hand, and that the fostering of Roman cultural values among provincial elites was essential for the development of a unified ruling class. An understanding of the importance that the Augustan and later ad- ministrations attached to provincial elites in this respect has in turn informed recent studies of Romanization, and in particular the influential work of Martin Millett, discussed below." Roman attitudes are important here because they made it possible for provincials to become Roman, not as a matter of ethnicity or even enfranchise- ment, but by wielding a specific cultural reper- toire.'2 The fact that some provincials came to iden- tify themselves fully with the values of Roman civili- zation cannot be doubted,'3 but in terms of the ar- gument presented below, it is important to stress that efforts to naturalize Roman values were aimed by one elite (in Rome) at another (in the provinc- es).'4 A province is, however, more than simply the sum of its elites. How, and with what success, did Romanization operate at lower social levels? That is the question posed by this paper. 7See Woolf (1998, 1-23; 48-76) for a helpful overview on these issues. 8The development of the Roman pantheon is a case in point here: Beard et al. 1998, 339-48. ' Most clearly set out by Brunt (1976). 10The Roman concept of humanitas and the imperative to disseminate it to the barbaroi are discussed in detail by Woolf (1998, 54-60). Pliny the Elder (NH3.39) referred to Italy as "chosen by the power of the gods ... to gather the scattered realms and to soften their customs and unite the discordant wild tongues of so many people into a common speech so that they might understand each other, and to give civilization to mankind." ' Millett 1990a, 1990b. ' Within limits: as Woolf notes (1998, 19), cultures of ex- SHORTCOMINGS OF ROMANIZATION Romanization is simply another word for accul- turation: a concept seized upon by some Romanists in the belief that it takes us beyond a one-sided view of cultural change,'5 but comprehensively trounced in studies of intercultural contact in more recent colonial contexts precisely because it does not. To understand what is wrong with accultura- tion, we may turn to the comments of a non-Roman- ist, Leland Ferguson: "Originally, acculturation sim- ply identified mutual culture exchange between people in contact. However, in recent years accul- turation has commonly come to mean... 'the adop- tion of traits of another group.' In social science this generally means the adoption of European traits or patterns by non-European people ... The central idea of this modern 'Eurocentric' view of accultur- ation is that either through choice or through force, non-European people in contact with Euro- peans gave up their traditional ways and became like Europeans."16 Ferguson is here discussing the shortcomings of acculturative approaches to European contact with Native Americans and Africans in colonial Ameri- ca, but if we replace "European (s)" with "Roman (s)" we can grasp instantly that Romanization is an ac- culturative model of exactly the type described by Ferguson. Richard Reece, who defined Romaniza- tion simply as "foreign influence,""7 well under- stood that, despite the rhetoric about cultural in- terchange, what is really envisaged is a one-sided process (it is not, in the end, termed Romanization for nothing). Romanization thus does not conceive of a two-way exchange of ideas: rather, it presuppos- es a linear transfer of ideas from the center to the provinces, in the course of which provincial society becomes cumulatively more Roman in its ways. Why did such a model of contact and culture change come to dominate the study of the Roman clusion operated at all levels of Roman society. '3 See here Woolf s (1998, 1-7) elegant account of the as- pirations and deeds of the Gallic orator Eumenius, a wealthy and powerful late third-century citizen ofAutun. 4 Humanitas, in this context, was a concept that specifically defined elite ideals and aspirations: Woolf notes (1998, 55) that despite its applicability to humankind, humanitas embod- ied "concepts of culture and conduct that were regarded by the Romans as the hallmarks of the aristocracy in particular." 15 Studies of the Roman provinces drawing specifically on the notion of acculturation include Slofstra 1983; Millett 1990a, 1990b; Hanson 1994.

HAVERFIELD'S ROMANIZATION ( 192OS-1 96os) The German historian MommsenS' first coined the term "Romanizing," but it was the British schol- ar Havefield19 who offered the first sustained anal- ysis of a process he termed "Romanization." Haver- field suggested that Rome maintained its empire in two ways: by organizing frontier defenses and by fostering the growth of "internal civilization" with- in the provinces.2" Haverfield termed this civiliz- ing process Romanization, the means by which non- Romans were "given"2' a new language, material culture, art, urban lifestyle, and religion. His two central conclusions regarding the Romanization process were: "Firstly, Romanization in general ex- tinguished the distinction between Roman and provincial, alike in material culture, politics and language. Secondly it did not everywhere and at once destroy all traces of tribal and national senti- ments or fashions."22 These conclusions still inform the study of pro- vincial societies today, but they present a paradox. On the one hand, Romanization was deemed to be an empire-wide process, molding diverse peoples in the image of metropolitan Rome, and in the pro- cess creating new Romans: "One uniform fashion spread from the Mediterranean throughout cen- tral and western Europe, driving out native art and substituting a conventional copy of Graeco-Roman or Italian art, which is characterized alike by techni- cal finish and neatness, and by lack of originality and dependence on imitation."23 As a result, one of the lasting by-products of Haverfield's focus on the uniformity of Romanization has been, as Woolf re- cently put it, "a tendency for [provincial] studies to focus on cultural homogenization, sometimes seen as inevitable, rather than on the creation of cultur- al difference."24 On the other hand, however, Haverfield argued that Romanization was arrested or assisted accord- ing to the various political and economic structures it encountered in the provinces. Within Britain, Romanization was most successful in the lowlands, " Mommsen 1885. 't Haverfield 1905-1906. 2" Haverfield 1923, 10-11.

It was least successful among the "peasantry," where aspects of native culture (such as religious belief) "seem to have survived more vigorously."25 Because he regard- ed the Romanization of urban elites as representa- tive of the cultural development of the entire popu- lation, Haverfield did not expand upon why pre- Roman traditions were more vigorous among the peasantry. In a brief discussion of these issues, the failure of nonelites to Romanize was put down to the "latent persistence" of folk customs-"superstitions, sentiments, even language and the consciousness of nationality"26-which he argued lingered, at a dormant level, among rural communities. COLLINGWOOD AND "FUSION" (1930s) Haverfield's equation of Romanization with the spread of superior (Roman) lifeways and material culture did not remain unchallenged. Colling- wood's reading of the material culture of Roman Britain27 was in some respects a direct challenge to Haverfield's viewpoint. As Collingwood wrote, "we cannot be content simply to assert that Britain was Romanized. The civilization we have found exist- ing in even the most Romanized parts of Britain is by no means a pure, or even approximately pure, Roman civilization bodily taken over by the con- quered race. What we have found is a mixture of Roman and Celtic elements. In a sense it might be said that the civilization of Roman Britain is nei- ther Roman nor British, but Romano-British, a fu- sion of the two things into a single thing different from either."2' Collingwood's view of Romano-British culture as a syncretistic or hybrid culture, which resembles in certain respects the creolization model proposed here, has left an important legacy in Romano-Brit- ish studies.29 But what is not found in Collingwood's work, or that of his inheritors, is a sense that fusion processes cannot be studied in isolation from the consideration of power (that is, an acknowledgment of the fundamental inequalities of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized). This consideration underpins all recent writing on cre- olization in the Americas, where cultural fusion, " Haverfield 1923, 22. 27Collingwood 1932. 28 Collingwood 1932, 92. 29 Collingwood has had a particular influence on approaches to the development of Romano-Celtic art and religion, most clearly seen in the work of Martin Henig (1984, 1995) and Miranda Green (1996, 1989, 1997, 1998). 211 2001]</page><page sequence="4">JANE WEBSTER among nonelites in particular, is studied in terms of the desire to maintain indigenous beliefs, tradi- tions, and language, while simultaneously, and of- ten tactically, adapting aspects of a dominant mate- rial culture. For these scholars, the syncretisms de- veloped by modern creole communities are a bal- ancing act, in which the complex relationship be- tween power and identity is always to the fore. In Collingwood's work, fusion is argued to have taken place differentially,3" with the upper classes and the towns at one end of a sliding scale, and the lower classes and the villages at the other. Fusion is seen as a problem-free process at all levels of soci- ety, however, taking place beyond the politics of power, with a dynamic requiring no more elucida- tion than Haverfield had offered. Collingwood's view of the villages of Roman Britain is thus much like that of Haverfield's image of the peasantry: "a stratum of population in whose life the Roman ele- ment appears hardly at all; if we must still call their civilization Romano-Celtic, it is only about five per cent Roman to ninety five Celtic."31 We are no near- er here to addressing why that Roman 5%, and not more, was adopted, than we were with Haverfield. Nevertheless, although Collingwood nowhere ad- dressed the issue specifically, it is clear that he shared Haverfield's belief that Celtic survivals could not have represented either resistance to Roman culture or an adaptation of it, arguing that the Celt- ic revival among un-Romanized peasants during the late Roman period was in no sense a sign of disaf- fection with Rome.32 On this level, then, Colling- wood's work did not represent a shift in focus from Haverfield's reading of Romanization as the rapid civilization of native elites, and the more halting dissemination of some aspects of that civilization to the poor. THE NATIVIST COUNTERATTACK (197os-198os) The 1970s and 1980s witnessed a new develop- ment. "Nativist" counterapproaches emerged, stressing the purity of indigenous cultural tradi- tions in the post-conquest era. Nativist scholars in- 30 Collingwood 1932, 92. 31 Collingwood 1932, 92. 2 Collingwood 1932, 93. :3 Laroui 1970; Benabou 1976a, 1976b. For a comprehen- sive overview of the rise of the nativist position in the Magh- reb (which focused on overt resistance to Rome), see Mat- tingly 1996. 34 Haverfield 1923, 59. 3 Forcey 1997. troduced for the first time the notion of resistance to the overtures of Roman culture, completely invert- ing Haverfield's conception. The first of these na- tivist strands emerged in North Africa, a region which had experienced recent colonization by Eu- ropeans, and within which the notion of empire in general as "given" civilization was met with consid- erable skepticism.33 In the west, a different type of nativist countermodel emerged that can be traced back to Haverfield's own uncertainties34 about the extent to which the peasantry could really be said to have Romanized. This nativist strand echoed ideas expressed in the writing of Vinogradoff in the early years of this century,35 but mainly flour- ished in Britain in the 1970s and 1980s.36 For the nativists, who pointed to the slow uptake of Latin, the rapid demise of towns, and an apparent Celtic revival in the later empire,37 Romanization was lit- tle more than a surface gloss beneath which Celtic lifeways survived unscathed. Side by side with Ro- manization, as Reece expressed it, the nativist school thus envisaged a "British way, which most people in Britain followed before Romanization began, kept to while Romanization was in full flood, and which came back into fashion, or rather be- came the general way, when Romanization was no more than a symmetrical memory."38 In this Roman Britain, to paraphrase Forcey,39 a Roman veneer was applied to Celtic woodwork. That is, a tactical use of the symbols of Romanitas took place in public, but behind closed doors, the majority of Britons declined to become Romans. For the British nativ- ist school then, the Roman way was neither em- braced nor resisted, but largely ignored. The difficulty with the British nativist model was that, by polarizing Roman and native identities and material culture, it failed to explain the emergence of those features of provincial culture (including aspects of religion and art) that were evidently Ro- mano-Celtic hybrids, and that scholars such as Col- lingwood, themselves challenging Haverfield's polarized approach to Roman and native culture (civilization versus latent persistence), had so ably identified. It is worth noting here that in the Amer- 36 The work of Richard Reece on the rapid decline of the symbols of Romanitasin some urban settings in Roman Britain was particularly influential here: see Reece 1980, 1988. A na- tivist perspective also influenced studies of Romano-British settlement (Smith 1978; Hingley 1989) and ritual (Scott 1991). 37 Haverfield 1923, 60-8. 3 Reece 1988, 74. 39Forcey 1997, 17. 212 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="5">CREOLIZING THE ROMAN PROVINCES icas, a very similar charge to that levied against the nativists was also raised in reaction to early attempts to identify "Africanisms"(African-derived cultural traits) in the archaeological record of slave com- munities, a practice which in the 1980s was an im- portant antecedent to the emergence of an archae- ology of creolization.4" Some of these early studies fixed on the identification of "African survivals" as a means by which Africans could be shown to have resisted European lifeways. It quickly became ap- parent, however, that this resistance-based ap- proach to African survivals actually hampered the elucidation of the part African lifeways had played in the emergence of creole African American iden- tities. In Romano-British studies, for similar reasons, the nativist model became a cul-de-sac, but in this case it was bypassed not by developing a new ap- proach to the integration of Roman and Celtic life- ways (as happened in the Americas), but by falling back on the trend of thinking about Romanization as the gradual triumph of one set of lifeways over another, which has continued from Haverfield to the present. At the same time, however, the nativist counterat- tack also left an important legacy. Its effects can be seen in Martin Millet's reworking of Haverfield's model in the early 1990s, in which he explicitly addressed the nativists' criticism that Haverfield's Romanization gave indigenous Britons no active role in the development of post-conquest material culture. MILLETT'S ROMANIZATION (1990s) Haverfield's view of the Romanization process has been superseded by Millett's influential model of Romanization as native-led emulation.41 This mod- el, as Millett himself stated,42 built on Haverfield's foundations, but it made two major advances. First, Millett successfully attempted to reconcile Haver- field's view that the provinces were "given a civiliza- tion"43 with the British nativists' contention that the indigenous population played an active role in ac- cepting or rejecting Roman culture. He achieved this by accepting Haverfield's contention that Ro- manization was largely a spontaneous process,44 but 4" The transition from the search for Africanisms to a focus on African American creolization in the archaeology of slavery in the United States is described by Singleton (1999, 7-8). 41 Millett 1990a, 1990b. 42 Millett 1990a, 1. 4 Haverfield 1923, 11. 44Haverfield 1923, 14. 45 The key features of Millett's reading of the Romaniza- at the same time placing the motor for the adop- tion of the symbols of Romanitas firmly in the hands of native elites. In Millett's model, native elites, who had been given the power to govern, provided that power was exercised in broad accordance with Ro- man principles, emulated Roman material culture in order to reinforce their social position.45 The symbols of Romanitas, which provided status indi- cators for the elite and set them apart from the re- mainder of society, were gradually adopted lower down the social scale through a self-generating pro- cess of progressive emulation. In these terms, Mil- lett recast Romanization as an active process rather than a passive one, and the native population (or native elites at least) were given a part in shaping a new social structure that "owes as much to the na- tive as to the Roman ingredient."46 Millett's approach to the Romanization of elites owed a debt not simply to nativist approaches, but to broader discussions about the role of Rome it- self in this process. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, debate grew as to whether Rome had a delib- erate policy of Romanizing her subjects.47 Some ten- sion between notions of state-sponsored Romaniza- tion and hands-off Romanization (whereby the state was assumed to trust that the empirically persua- sive charms of Roman culture would be enough to ensure its adoption), has in fact always been present. Haverfield also had been uncertain about this, stat- ing that "the advance of this Romanization followed manifold lines. Much was due to official encour- agement by statesmen who cherished the ideal of assimilating the provinces or who recognized more cynically that civilized men are easier to rule than savages. More, perhaps, was spontaneous."48 In recent years, it has become widely accepted that Augustus ushered in a new era, during which the power of imagery emanating from the metro- politan center consolidated imperial authority and aided the Romanization of provincial elites. At one end of the spectrum, some scholars have seen this new cultural program less as a deliberate policy than as a naturally evolving process;49 at the other, schol- ars have argued that Augustus and his successors were engaged in deliberate state intervention.:0 tion process are set out explicitly in Millett 1990b, 37-8. 46Millett 1990b, 37. 47 See Millett 1990b; see also Woolf 1998, 22 n. 74. 48Haverfield 1923, 14. 9 Zanker 1990. 50A position advanced most forcibly by Whittaker (1997, 143-63). 213 2001]</page><page sequence="6">JANE WEBSTER Millett came down firmly on the side of Zanker's notion that the rapid adoption of the metropolitan cultural program in the west was a result of sponta- neous competition between natives "within every social class."5' He thus saw Romanization "as a re- sult of accidents of social and power structures rather than deliberate actions."52 Another important feature of Millett's model was to shift attention away from provincial homogene- ity (with which Haverfield had been concerned) towards provincial differences. In the 1980s and 1990s, work on the western provinces placed a much greater focus than Haverfield had done upon the nature of interaction between later pre-Roman Iron Age societies and the persistence and trans- formation of those societies following their incor- poration into the empire.53 This important devel- opment has been summarized by Jones, who has argued that although this work has contributed significantly to our understanding of provincial societies, it has remained "almost exclusively con- cerned with the emulation of Roman material cul- ture in the legitimation of political power."54 This leads to some major difficulties. First, it leaves intact Haverfield's implicit contention that the Romanization of elites was the only Romanization that mattered (as Haverfield wrote, "the rustic poor of a country seldom affect the trend of its histo- ry").5 Second, it ensures that provincial heteroge- neity is largely explained as a reflection of the het- erogeneity in Iron Age societies (and the differen- tial degrees of pre-Roman Romanization to which those societies were exposed), rather than as a re- flection of post-conquest choices. In other words, it is still assumed, as Haverfield had assumed, that had provincial populations entered the period of Roman fashions in what Richard Reece termed "a state of grace,"56 Romanization would have proceed- ed at an equal rate everywhere. Things may have moved on in Romanization stud- ies, then, but Millett's model is actually very similar to Haverfield's: both are primarily concerned with 51Zanker 1990, 316. 52 Millett 1990b, 38. 5: Influential studies on the transformation of Iron Age so- cieties include Millett (1990a, 9-39) and the work of Colin Haselgrove: see in particular Haselgrove 1984, 1987, 1990. 54Jones 1997, 35; see also 29-39 for a discussion of the re- cent focus on the transformation of Iron Age societies. 55 Haverfield 1923, 60. 5' Reece 1988, 5. 57 This point is made explicitly by Haverfield (1923, 10-1). He states the opinion that "had Rome failed to civilize, had the relationship between native elites and Rome, and both are based on a belief that the impetus for provincial change was emulation of Roman culture. EMULATING ROME Haverfield was convinced that what Rome offered native societies was self-evidently better than their own culture. The reasons for this were, however, more complex than a simple faith in the virtues of under- floor heating and painted wall plaster. Haverfield's writing was underpinned by the belief that in civiliz- ing the provinces, Rome fostered the values of the modern Western world.57 For Haverfield, Romaniza- tion was inevitable because it was nothing less than the triumph of the classical cultural values on which his own European, imperialist, turn-of-the-century worldview was itself based. Until quite recently, Ro- manization continued to be conceptualized in such progressive terms, summarized in Sellar and Yeat- man's comment that "the Roman Conquest was, how- ever, a Good Thing, since the Britons were only na- tives at the time."58 Several factors informed this pro- gressive approach, not the least of these being that the Romans believed it themselves.5' But does this mean we must believe it too? As Richard Hingley has argued,6" it must be re- membered here that provincial Roman archaeol- ogy developed against the backdrop of modern European imperialism, which reached its maxi- mum extent with the "Scramble for Africa" in 1875-1900, and which was itself popularly regard- ed as a civilizing force. Common sense suggests that these two imperial projects became to some degree conflated in the minds of the scholars who, in the early 1900s, formulated the cornerstone texts on the Roman provinces. Considerable de- bate has raged on this topic,6' but for Hingley, the most persistent critic of Romanization, the con- cept says more about 19th-century perceptions of European colonial culture and government than it does about the Roman world. He argues that Haverfield's understanding of Roman Britain the civilized life found no period in which to grow firm and tenacious, civilization would have perished utterly. The culture of the old world would not have lived on, to form the ground- work of the best culture of today." 58 Sellar and Yeatman 1975, 11. 5" See supra n. 10. 6" Hingley 1995, 1996, 1997. 6' Webster and Cooper 1996 contains two papers on this topic, offering strongly contrastingviewpoints (Freeman 1996; Hingley 1996). 214 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="7">CREOLIZING THE ROMAN PROVINCES must be seen in terms of a cycle of interpretation, in which the past was used to inform the present, and in the process of which the Roman past was itself reinvented. Among those inventions (which also included defensive imperialism62 and laissez- faire religious tolerance63) was the paradigm of Romanization as civilization. Whatever we make of this debate, we can surely agree that Romanization was the product of a spe- cific period in European history. Equally, the two nativist reactions to it reflect other moments and histories-the decolonization of North Africa and the new wave of critical post-colonial scholarship this brought, and the backlash in some European quarters against neoimperialism at the time of the Vietnam War. As Woolf has recently emphasized, modern accounts of Roman culture have moved a long way from the absolutist position represented by Haverfield.64 Indeed, much post-Haverfield scholarship has sought reasons-beyond cultural superiority-as to why imitation might take place, and has concluded that Roman symbols were not slavishly copied for their own sake but were emulat- ed for both aesthetic and pragmatic reasons. Millett's reworking of Haverfield,65 whereby elites adopt Roman symbols as a means of retaining pow- er and status, introduced the concept that emula- tion has at least as much to do with the pragmatics of power as with the recognition of superior cultur- al values. Though he does not explore the extent to which this form of pragmatic emulation was min- gled with a recognition of superior cultural values, Millett is thus able to suggest practical reasons why elites would emulate the symbols of Romanitas. Two observations may be made at this point. First, we only have to think about the Druids to realize not all elites shared that reasoning,66 and second, what about provincial nonelites? It is when we address this issue that both the weaknesses of Romaniza- tion as a model for culture change, and the con- tinuing dependency on emulation as the motor for change, become most apparent. t2 See Harris 1979 and, for a recent case study highlighting the continuing repercussions of this theme, see also de Souza 1996. :3 See Webster 1997a, 1997b. '4Woolf 1998,5. The similar viewpoints of other key figures in the development of Roman provincial archaeology, includ- ingMommsen (1885) in GermanyandJullian (1908-1926) in France, have also been superseded. " Millett 1990a, 1990b. 'i I have discussed elsewhere the spectacular failure of the Druidic elite to embrace the "community of interest" offered OPPOSITION TO EMULATION Since Haverfield's day, it has been acknowledged that at the bottom end of society (and in some re- gions more than others) Romanization was far less widespread than at the top. Only in the towns, Hav- erfield argued, could Romanization be shown to have extended throughout several social strata, from elites to the lower social levels.67 Elsewhere, civili- zation took a firm hold only among the aristocracy. The rustic poor, "covered with a superimposed lay- er of Roman civilization,"68 comprised the least Ro- manized stratum. Efforts to explain this phenome- non, more than any other, highlight the weakness- es of Romanization as a model for cultural change. The explanations put forward do not address local- ized choices or the development of countercultur- al movements from the bottom up (a possibility dis- cussed below). Instead, it is assumed that all levels of society must have desired the symbols of Roman- ization, as did the elites, despite the fact that some social groups, such as the rural poor, had little of practical value to gain from them.69 This is not to deny the existence of aspiring elites, whose role in the uptake of Roman lifeways was no doubt particu- larly important: it is simply to suggest that at some point on the social scale, such aspirations would only be realized (or even entertained) in excep- tional circumstances. Exactly where that point lies is an important question, but one little articulated in Romanization studies. Haverfield also accepted that some features of provincial life (such as religion) involved an inter- action between Roman culture and surviving na- tive traditions.7" As we have already seen, he regard- ed these survivals as evidence for the "latent persis- tence"7' of indigenous superstitions. The passivity implicit in the choice of the term latent is reveal- ing. It suggests that, however briefly expounded Haverfield's views on the Romanization of nonelites were, he did not consider the factors inhibiting the rustic poor from acquiring Roman material culture as having anything to do with choice. Indeed, Hav- by Rome (Webster 1999). 7 Haverfield 1923, 16. 68Haverfield 1923, 79. 69 Differential access to the opportunities offered by Rome is discussed by Drinkwater and Vertet (1992, 25-8). 70 Haverfield employs the term "coalescence" in describing this interaction (1923, 21). 71 On latent persistence see Haverfield (1923, 22), where a contrast is drawn between the passive persistence of indige- nous cultural traits and the concept of active opposition. 215 2001]</page><page sequence="8">JANE WEBSTER erfield drew an explicit contrast between latent persistence and the idea of active opposition. Such concepts as resistance, the development of coun- tercultures, or the birth of creole cultures simply did not exist in Haverfield's reading of the passive peasantry of Roman Britain. The fact that Haverfield, writing at the turn of the century, regarded provincial elites as the only active forces in the history and culture in the Roman west, is perhaps unsurprising. What is more surprising is the persistence of this trend into the 1990s. Millett's model-while representing a significant advance in attempting to determine the processes by which elites adopted Romanized material culture-has even less to say on the mechanisms by which Roman- ization spread to nonelites than Haverfield's did. Millett's contention, as we have seen, is that native elites emulated Roman symbols to reinforce their identification with Rome. Following this: "Progressive emulation of this symbolism further down the social hierarchy was self-generating, encouraging others in society to aspire to things Roman, thereby spreading the culture."72 Thus, nonelites were Romanized at second hand, emulating the material culture of their social superiors, who had set themselves apart from the lower orders through the acquisition of Roman status indicators. Millett appears to accept-though this is not discussed in any detail-that investment in the symbolic capital of Roman material culture would have rapidly become the only way in which aspiring elites, and those even lower down the social hierarchy, would have been able to enhance their own prospects or express their identity in the new order. The existence of other currencies (that is, of countercultural symbols of identity and status) is not envisaged. Some recent writing, building on Millett, has even suggested that if we accept that Romanization was the outcome of shared interest between native elites and the metropolitan center, it also follows that Rome would have shown no interest in extending Roman culture to the poor. As a result rural non- elites experienced Rome entirely through the mediation of Romanized elites.73 In such circum- stances, it is suggested, it is only to be expected that cultural assimilation in rural contexts will have happened more or less haphazardly.74 On the one hand, this argument represents an advance, in that 72 Millett 1990b, 38; the emphasis is my own. 73Millett (1990b) implies this, Whittaker (1997, 155) states it explicitly. 74 Or as Whittaker puts it (1997, 155) "by osmosis." it at least suggests that without a push from the top (whether Roman or native), Romanization was not the unstoppable cultural force many assume it to have been. On the other hand, this reasoning goes even further than earlier models in denying non- elites any say in their own cultural development. In this scenario of elite indifference, nonelites sim- ply become passive receptors of those random ele- ments of Roman culture that trickle down to them. The unstated assumption here, again, is that these Roman influences were always welcomed. THE CURRENT STATE OF ROMANIZATION STUDIES It can be seen that at the end of almost a century of Romanization studies, emulation, assumed to be a spontaneous or self-generating process,77 remains the dominant model of native engagement with Roman material culture at all levels of society. But what drove this emulation? Elites and urban dwellers may well have been motivated by pragmatic self-interest, as Millett has persuasively argued, but what did the ru- ral poor have to gain by adopting the symbols of Ro- manitas? Without an element of self interest, the only motor for change becomes the superiority of Roman culture, bringing us full circle to Haverfield's origi- nal (acculturative) conception of Romanization as the unstoppable march of civilization. Equally importantly, continued faith in Haver- field's notion that anyone who could have Roman- ized would have when given the chance means that the failure to emulate must be explained, wherev- er encountered. Unfortunately, the point where the trickle-down effect tapered off is never examined in terms of localized choices. It is instead explained in four ways: latent persistence of folk customs (Hav- erfield/Collingwood); overt resistance (the north African nativist model); Romanization as a veneer (the British nativist model); and pre-conquest re- gional differences (the 1990s approach typified by Millett and Haselgrove). Finally, but most importantly, the only alternatives to wholesale Romanization suggested to date are negative ones: not to Romanize at all (nativist ap- proaches), or elite indifference. All models of Ro- manization thus lead us to the same place: a polar- ized provincial world of Romans (or Romanized natives) and natives,76 with no gray areas in between. 75 "Spontaneous" is Haverfield's term for it (1923, 14); "self- generating" is Millett's (1990b, 38). 76 Woolf usefully terms this a dichotomy between Roman- ization and resistance (1998, 15). 216 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="9">CREOLIZING THE ROMAN PROVINCES Woolf recently suggested that revisionist studies of Romanization (such as this one) perpetuate that dichotomy by focusing on imperialism and Roman- ization in terms of the interaction of Roman and native cultures.77 It is my contention that only by revising some of our cherished attitudes can we move on from this "either/or" approach to provin- cial societies in order to understand the processes informing the emergence of new societies in the Roman provinces. Perhaps the greatest problem with the polarized view of Roman and native culture is that there can be no ambiguity whatsoever about what Roman or Roman-style material culture means: where we find it, we do not find people making active use of it in the negotiation of new identities-we find Romans and aspiring Romans. Where we do not find Ro- man-style material culture, or find less of it, we are in the company of natives. (Such was the case in northern Britain, which according to the conven- tional reading failed to Romanize because pre-Ro- man Romanization had not taken place. On the other hand, pre-Roman Romanization in the south fostered the community of interest upon which suc- cessful Romanization of indigenous elites depend- ed.) Again, this polarized view of Roman and na- tive material culture can be traced back to Haver- field, who explicitly ruled out the possibility that provincials, as they became acculturated, could re- gard Roman material culture with any degree of ambiguity.78 For Haverfield, to Romanize was to be- come Roman, and to use Roman material culture was to espouse all that Rome stood for. Theories have become more sophisticated since Haverfield, but, again, not enough. The British nativist model and that of Millett both suggested that tactical, po- litically-motivated ways of utilizing Roman culture may have existed. The former, however, supposed that use of Roman culture did not actually change Celtic society-beneath a Roman veneer lay an un- sullied pure Celticity-and the latter supposed that these strategies were played out simply in terms of gaining or maintaining a particular social standing in the new Roman order. Millett's reworking of Haverfield accepted that elities made a strategic use of the symbols of Roman- itas in order to advance their position. This point 77 Woolf 1997, 340. 78 Haverfield's views here are quite explicit: "When [the Roman provincial] adopted, and adopted permanently, the use of things Roman, we may say of him, firstly, that he had become civilized enough to realize their value, and further, that he had has been reiterated by Woolf, who in his recent study of Roman Gaul refines this position by stress- ing that part of the reason why Roman culture was widely adopted by provincial elites and would-be elites lay in the fact that "those Roman aristocrats who had taken on themselves the burden of regu- lating civilization had defined Roman culture in such a way that it might function as a marker of status, not of political or ethnic identity. In this way, 'becoming Roman' could again be a strategy, and one strategy among others."79 Thus, there is some recognition today that the use of Samian ware did not necessarily mean the user aspired to the full gamut of Roman values (any more than the millions around the globe who drink Coca- Cola would necessarily view American cultural val- ues as superior). But it must be emphasized again that all these studies have focused on elites. Rome opened up windows of opportunity for elites and aspiring elites that, at a certain point down the social scale, simply disappeared (or never existed at all). Equally importantly, none of these models allow for adaptive synthesis, in which Romanized materi- al culture could be used in ambiguous ways, simul- taneously creating new identities and maintaining key aspects of pre-Roman belief and practice. It is time to replace Romanization with a new framework that does address these issues. That framework is creolization. FROM ROMANIZATION TO CREOLIZATION Creolization is a linguistic term indicating the merging of two languages into a blended dialect.80 It has come to be used more generally for the pro- cesses of multicultural adjustment through which-from the interaction between Europeans, Native Americans, and displaced Africans-African- American and African Caribbean societies were cre- ated.81 It is a term increasingly employed in colo- nial archaeology in the Americas, and one that could usefully be brought to bear on the Roman provinces. The development of creole languages is instruc- tive for those attempting to understand the negoti- ations that shaped colonial societies. Abrahams ar- gues that in the New World colonies, West African slaves had to substitute some of their own words ceased to bear any national hatred against them" (1923, 20). 79Woolf 1998, 239. 80 On creole dialects see Abrahams 1983. 81 The earliest and most influential study of creole cultural development was by Braithwaite (1971). 217 2001]</page><page sequence="10">JANE WEBSTER with English words because they did not have the equivalent terms (especially for the slave-master relationship itself). But substitution of English for African dialects was not the norm. Instead, their language became a mixture of African and English elements, and English, where it was used alone, was employed in a limited range of contexts: "The language of everyday discourse remained essentially creole. Only on certain ceremonial occasions was the European tongue called into play, and then only the most formal style of that speech system."82 Archaeologists working in the Americas have for some time been extending the model of creole lan- guage development to the study of material culture,83 suggesting that, like creole languages, creole mate- rial culture represents not the gradual replacement of one way of life by another, but the blending of both, in a clearly nonegalitarian social context. Like language, creole material culture exhibits a degree of mastery of two cultural traditions, which can be drawn on to differing degrees according to context. The result is a highly ambiguous material culture, in the sense that it is imbued with different mean- ings in different contexts. Anne Yentsch's attempts to identify the experiences of domestic slaves in one elite household in Annapolis, Maryland, provides a good example here.84 Focusing on cookery, she ar- gues that because slaves were expected to provide some of their own food (grown on allotments), Afri- can foodstuffs and ways of cooking were thus main- tained. They became, in turn, staple elements of African American creole cuisine. Yentsch empha- sizes that what resulted was not simply an African nativist survival; rather, slaves negotiated a way of liv- ing that accommodated old and new, and out of this a new ethnicity was created. Leland Ferguson's work on Carolina plantation slavery85 represents perhaps the most detailed and successful application of creolization theory to ar- chaeology to date. Building on the work of the his- torian and folklorist Charles Joyner,86 who applied the creolization concept to the lifeways of 19th-cen- tury slaves, Ferguson has developed an approach to colonial material culture in which material things 2 Abrahams 1983, 26. "8The parallels between the creolization of language and material culture are drawn out explicitly by Yentsch in her study of the material culture of domestic slaves in Maryland: "Take, e.g., the process whereby African-born women living in the Chesapeake adapted elements of English cuisine with African cooking techniques and foodstuffs. What Abrahams [supra n. 80] wrote aboutverbal performance in the Caribbe- an points the way to what happens with food" (Yentsch 1994, (artifacts, icons, architecture) are viewed, like words in a dictionary, as building-blocks in the "lexicon of culture."87 In creole contexts, Ferguson argues, the "grammar" informing the use of what at first sight appears to be an "acculturated" material culture may be radically different from the material cul- ture itself. Slaves, for example, typically received their material culture from their European mas- ters. Yet Ferguson's work demonstrates clearly that these artifacts were frequently utilized according to sets of values that were principally African. Thus, while the artifacts of slaves might appear to be Eu- ropean American, they were created and used ac- cording to the underlying, African-derived rules of slave culture. This dialectic, in turn, contributed to the emergence of a new, African American society. Three points emerge here. First, just as it would be impossible to understand what it meant to be a person of color in colonial America without exam- ining creole processes, we cannot understand what it meant to be a provincial subject of Rome without focusing on similar processes of negotiation in the Roman world. Second, in any colonial context, those processes are given material expression. In this sense, material culture encapsulates colonial experience. Third, while creole culture is an amal- gam of different traits, creolization processes take place in the context of asymmetric power relations. Links with the past are maintained in opposition to the elite-sponsored trajectories of a dominant cul- ture, and maintaining tradition thus carries with it an element of risk. Creolization is frequently, there- fore, a process of resistant adaptation. What emerg- es from this process is not a single, normative colo- nial culture, but mixed cultures.88 Given its origins, how can creolization best be ex- ploited in studying the Roman world? Ferguson emphasizes that creolization theory allows for wide- ranging analyses of social and political interaction: "Since the emphasis of such studies is on the pro- cess of creolization, cultures need not be commonly known as 'creole cultures' for an analysis of creoliza- tion to be applicable."89 I suggest that in the same way that European artifacts could be used by slaves- 374 n. 4). 8Yentsch 1994. 85Ferguson 1992. 8Joyner 1974. 7 Ferguson 1992, xlii. 8 Ferguson (1992, xlii) envisages "a series of interacting subcultures rather than a single creolized blend." 89Ferguson 1992, xli. 218 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="11">CREOLIZING THE ROMAN PROVINCES not because they aspired to become European but according to an underlying set of non-European rules-provincial artifacts in the Roman world may likewise appear Romanized, but can in certain con- texts likewise operate according to a different, in- digenous, set of underlying rules. As creole artifacts, they can negotiate with, resist, or adapt Roman styles to serve indigenous ends, and ultimately, they are part of the emergence of creole societies. CREOLIZING ROMANO-CELTIC RELIGION Religion has always had a central place in the study of creolization processes. This is because, in many colonial contexts, religious belief has either been the focal point around which overt rebellion has crystallized,9' or it has been the aspect of indig- enous cultural life most resistant to acculturation. For example, Santeria, the creole religion of Cuba, developed as the beliefs and practices of diverse peoples (European Catholics, Christianized indig- enous elites, American Indians, and Africans) jos- tled together, creating a creole synthesis. As we examine Santeria, we need to bear in mind the fact that the ethnic make-up of Roman Britain was as complex in its own way as that of the Spanish colo- nies. In the Roman west, indigenous beliefs en- countered a Classical pantheon that was itself the product of centuries of religious interchange be- tween Roman, Greek, and Eastern religions. Add- ed to this, many of the Romans in the west (for ex- ample, auxiliary soldiers) came from territories that had also been conquered by Rome, and whose be- lief systems had already engaged with the Roman pantheon. Britons and Gauls, encountering these already complex gods of Rome, brought other strands of belief and practice into this arena. In Roman Britain and Gaul, as in the Spanish colo- nies, it seems reasonable to suggest that creole syn- theses may also have emerged. Needless to say, Romano-Celtic religion has never been conceptualized in these terms. The notion of Romanization has instead dominated the study of Romano-British religion, the main sources of evi- dence for which comprise inscriptions and iconog- raphy.91 It is perhaps easy to see why this has hap- pened. Post-conquest provincial iconography makes "0 See, e.g., Webster (1999) on millenarian protest move- ments in post-conquest contexts around the world, and the possible existence of this form of overt resistance in early post- conquest Gaul and Britain. '1 I concentrate on the latter here: on the former see Web- ster 1995a, 1995b. )9 Important studies advancing this viewpoint include G. use of media apparently only rarely used in the west before the conquest (sculpture in stone or bronze), and the deities themselves are depicted in human form. It has long been argued that the Iron Age Celts had a reluctance to construct anthropomorphic im- ages of gods, and it has therefore been assumed that after the conquest Celtic peoples adopted from Rome new gods and a new repertoire of anthropo- morphic representation, used to depict both Roman and Celtic deities. Anthropomorphic imagery is thus argued to mark both a classically-inspired Roman- ization of the representation of the Celtic gods, and, through the process of religious syncretism (itself seen as a manifestation of provincial Romanization), the welcoming of those deities into an accommodat- ing Graeco-Roman cosmology. As a result, Romano- Celtic religion has for many decades been interpret- ed as a neutral syncretism that was not imposed upon the provinces from outside, but reflected the spon- taneous desire of polytheistic peoples to accommo- date each other's gods.92 This position has been modified somewhat,93 but the majority of work still lacks an acknowledgment that Romano-Celtic reli- gious and artistic syncretism took place within a co- lonial context. While conventional models of Romanization have no explanatory power regarding the emergence of Romano-Celtic religion, nativist arguments for a Roman veneer overlying an unsullied Celtic reli- gion are of little help either. To regard Romano- Celtic religion-or its visual expression-as Celtic religion expressed in non-Celtic ways is not simply an error; it is a failure to recognize the emergence not of a problem-free syncretism, but of a creole religion. While we hold on to the idea of an emula- tive Romano-Celtic iconography, we cannot begin to recognize the religion's true nature and under- stand provincial icons in terms of negotiation with Roman beliefs and values. In order to explore the workings of creole reli- gion we may turn to Santeria, the creole religion of Cuba. Religion across the Caribbean today is a com- plex mixture of influences: American Indian sur- vivals, Christianity (first Spanish Catholicism, later English Anglicanism), and also African (mainly Yoruba) influences introduced by slaves. As Bran- Webster (1986) and Green's earliest studies of Celtic religion (1986, 1989). 93 Green 1997 and 1998, on the genesis and nature of Celt- ic and Romano-Celtic imagery, are more concerned with the impact of cultural interaction upon religious art than was the case in her earlier work. 2001] 219</page><page sequence="12">JANE WEBSTER don emphasizes in his study of Santeria,94 such reli- gions grow out of developing creole cultures as an opposition between the ideals of indigenous elites and the aspirations of nonelites. Colonial culture in Latin America and the Caribbean, he states, was "participated in by most of the population regard- less of ethnic or racial origin. Comprised of Span- ish, Native American, African, and Islamic influ- ences, it remained nevertheless oriented toward Spain and, as a result, was dominated proximally by the vision of Spanish culture current among the island's hegemonic elite. This elite in its turn saw the 'ideal,' the conquest culture promoted by the union of the Crown and the church, as its model and promoted it actively, selectively, and by exam- ple to the rest of the population."95 The problem, as Brandon documents, was that the rest of the pop- ulation did not embrace the same ideal. Making their own selections from Spanish Catholicism (the identity and iconography of the saints) and fusing them with Yoruba deities, the urban poor, among whom were large numbers of slaves and freed slaves of African origin, created a new syncretistic reli- gion. This process took place over a period of sev- eral centuries, centered on the years from 1760 to 1870. The visual expression of the resultant syn- thesis, Santeria, is highly idiosyncratic, making use of both Catholic imagery and Yoruba symbols. Brandon's point above is that local elites (in the Spanish Caribbean) adopted an ideal to which the Spanish had purposefully guided them, intending to impose Spanish culture and values upon the New World colonies. MillettO` makes much the same point in his model of the Romanization of the Roman west, whereby a community of interest was fostered be- tween native elites and Rome, ensuring that local elites were the first to adopt the symbols of Romani- tas. But at the root of Millett's model (as with Haver- field's) is the supposition that this colonial ideal trick- led down through society by a process of spontane- ous emulation. Brandon's point is that different ide- als and practices can emerge, as it were, from the bottom up, creating counter- or subcultures. It goes without saying that the social contexts in colonial Cuba and the Roman west were radically different, but the general point is that what is missing from Millett's model, and from all acculturative models of Romanization, is the possibility for this bottom-up cultural development to take place. '4 Brandon 1993. ' Brandon 1993, 43. ' Millett 1990a, 1990b. t7 The former term was employed by Stern in his study of Creole religions like Santeria offer an important lesson for students of Romano-Celtic religious syn- cretism. They demonstrate that there are limits to syn- cretism, which represents an adaptation, rather than an adoption, of new religious beliefs and practices. Syncretism is thus part of a process of intercultural negotiation, which scholars in the Americas call "re- sistant adaptation" or "resistant accommodation."97 The iconography that emerges from such negotia- tions is, as Cuban Santeria amply demonstrates, ex- tremely complex, drawing some visual elements from the metropolitan ideal, but conveying a very differ- ent, countercultural visual message. Is it possible to see similar processes at work in the iconography of Romano-Celtic religion? One of the difficulties of studying Romano-Celtic iconography is that it is often very poorly contextualized and lacks the depth of in- formation available to scholars of recent historical pe- riods. Indeed, a significant proportion of the Romano- Celtic data comprises stray finds, or poorly-contexted material from 19th-century excavations. It is argued below, nevertheless, that by comparing different cate- gories of iconographic representation and paying close attention to the degree to which different dei- ties are associated with other new developments, such as epigraphy, it becomes possible to isolate some di- vine figures that seem to be particularly resistant to what (in conventional terms) would be seen as syn- cretistic Romanization. I suggest below that Epona, the horse goddess from eastern and central Gaul, is a deity of precisely this type. EPONA: A CREOLE GODDESS FROM ROMAN GAUL Eastern and central Gaul are areas particularly rich in post-conquest iconography. Three major groups of non-Classical deities occur: 1. Celtic deities paired or twinned with gods from the Graeco-Roman pantheon. The epigraphic in- terpretatio Romana is frequently employed in these cases (e.g., Apollo Moritasgus), explicitly linking a Graeco-Roman and an indigenous deity, or identi- fying one with the other. Another manifestation of deity pairing is the divine marriage of a Graeco- Roman male deity with a female Celtic partner. The best-known example of this pairing is the divine marriage of Mercury and Rosmerta.9 2. A repertoire of clay statuettes, mass produced in the Allier region throughout the second century A.D. One of the most popular deities of this group was the colonial Peru (Stern 1982, 11). The latter is discussed by Gar- man (1998).

I have argued elsewhere"' that despite the Romanized appearance of Venus and oth- er deities in this category, it is possible to regard these clay statuettes as a pantheon of popular culture, re- flecting indigenous fertility beliefs. 3. A series of deities, which although depicted anthropomorphically, are clearly neither Graeco- Roman gods nor based upon classical exemplars. The horse goddess Epona, the horned god Cer- nunnos, and the hammer god Sucellus, who wears a distinctive sagum (Gallic cloak), are the principal deities of this group. Here, I will principally be concerned with the deities in group 3, and above all with Epona. The iconography of this goddess is more widespread than that of any other Celtic deity in Europe, and she is the one deity of this group for whom some resistance to the Graeco-Roman pantheon has al- ready been suggested in detail.1"' Epona's distribu- tion is concentrated in northern and eastern Gaul, with notable clusters among the Aedui and Mandu- bii."" She was also popular with Gallic auxiliaries on the border of Germania Superior, many of whom are likely to have come from the Aedui. Dating of these images is difficult, and usually performed on stylistic criteria alone, but the majority of attempts at dating place the images in the second and third centuries A.D. Images of Epona extend from Brit- ain to Dacia, and writing in the second century, Apuleius mentions figures of the goddess on sta- bles in Rome itself.1"2 Her cult therefore appears to have been long-lived and very widespread. It is important to begin by observing that, with the exception of Cernunnos,"'3 it is not certain that the deities in group 3 were represented in human form before the conquest. Indeed, it is probable that they were not. I suggest this because one of the most obvious post-conquest characteristics of this group is the presence of animal imagery. Cernun- nos is depicted as a semi-zoomorphic horned be- ing, and Epona is represented in human form, but is consistently associated with one or more horses. In Burgundy, where her cult probably originated, '"Webster 1997b, following Vertet 1984. "" By Linduff (1979). "" Oaks 1986. 1)2 Met. 3.27.

Indeed, the goddess's name apparently derives from the Gallic word for horse,1'4 and her identity is dependent upon her horse emblem; she does not exist without it. Conversely, horse and foal imagery does sometimes occur without Epona herself.1"" This zoomorphic trend is less tangible for Sucel- lus, but there are occasions on which he is associat- ed with dogs.""' It is very possible that the represen- tation of semi-zoomorphic deities in the post-con- quest period may be a continuation of pre-Roman traditions, and this, I suggest, is one of the keys to understanding the transformation of the group 3 deities in the post-conquest period. Drawing on Roman artistic traditions of naturalistic human im- agery, pre-conquest zoomorphic deities began to be either consistently represented in human form (as in the case of Cernunnos and perhaps Epo- na),"'7 or realized for the first time in a way that incorporated adoption of the human form (as may be the case for Sucellus and perhaps also Epona). The large body of evidence for horse imagery in Iron Age contexts, together with Epona's insepa- rability from the horse and her near-absence from the most Romanized parts of Gaul (Narbonensis in particular) has led to the claim that the goddess is "a Celt among the Romans.""'s I see this as a mis- take, because to conceptualize Epona in these terms is to regard her rather in the way that the nativist school of thinking on Romanization regards pro- vincial culture in general: as pure Celticity under a Roman veneer. In this sense, I completely agree with Henig's assertion"'"' that it is fallacious to as- sume that beneath a very thin veneer the Celtic gods remained uncorrupted by Rome. For Henig, however, this was because the Celtic gods, like the Celts themselves, had become Romans."" This I cannot accept. In my terms, Epona cannot be re- garded as a Celtic deity or a Roman one. She is the product of the post-Roman negotiation between Roman and indigenous beliefs and iconographic traditions: she is thus a Romano-Celtic deity but not, as discussed below, the product of a problem- free or spontaneous synthesis.

This point may be demonstrated by examining what is absent from Epona's imagery rather than what is present. First, we may note that although many of the stone images of Epona are the product of competent artisanship, and although the god- dess is frequently depicted with classical at- tributes,1" there are no instances in which she is paired iconographically with a deity from the Grae- co-Roman pantheon. Given the frequency with which other Gallic goddesses enter into divine marriages with male Graeco-Roman partners,"2 Epona's resistance to the married state seems im- portant. It suggests there are levels on which she operates beyond the Graeco-Roman pantheon; that despite her emergence into human form, there is a limit beyond which she does not syncretize or Romanize. Cernunnos is similarly resistant to icon- ographic twinning."3 It is also interesting to note, in this context, that the hammer god Sucellus is sometimes associated with a divine partner, but she is not a classical one: his partner has the Celtic name Nantosuelta.'14 Second, we may note that images of Epona, Cer- nunnos, and Sucellus rarely incorporate epigraphy. Again, there are some exceptions to this generali- zation,1' but these are far from common. Epona, in particular, lacks widespread epigraphic attestation. In his 1948 study of Celtic religion, de Vries noted a total of 26 inscriptions naming Epona."'l More examples may well have been identified since the 1940s, but given the widespread nature of Epona's cult (over 300 images of the goddess are known), this seems a very small number of occurrences. In this context, it is important to note that neither Epo- na nor Cernunnos is epigraphically name-paired, in any instance, with a deity from the Graeco-Ro- man pantheon. Throughout Gaul, as in Britain, epigraphic name-pairing (Lenus-Mars; Sulis-Min- erva etc.) was widely employed for the explicit iden- "'' Most commonly cornucopiae, but also paterae, from which she feeds her foal: see Green (1989, 92). ''" The iconography of the Romano-Celtic divine marriage is summarized by Green (1989, 45-73). 'The exception which proves the rule here is a very high quality relief from Reims on which the god is flanked by Mer- cury (Green 1989, fig. 38), but it is interesting here that the composition of the relief leaves no room for ambiguity regard- ing the principal deity depicted: Cernunnos, a seated figure pouring out grain or possibly coins, dominates the image. 14 Green 1986, 95-6. 15 E.g., the name Cernunnos appears on a relief image of an antlered god that forms part ofTiberian Sailors' Pillar, tification of Graeco-Roman gods with deities who have Celtic names but localized distributions. It is very interesting, therefore, that the group 3 gods, who were widely worshipped in the Roman west, were not paired with Graeco-Roman deities in this way. As I have argued elsewhere,"' the practice of epigraphic name-pairing was one enthusiastically embraced by high-ranking Roman officials and in- digenous elites, but was less enthusiastically adopt- ed by other social groups. Nonelites may have re- sisted the epigraphic interpretatio romana not because they were ignorant, but because they were unwill- ing to take syncretism this far: while the adoption of the human form may have been acceptable, nam- ing perhaps was considered objectionable. It may of course be counterargued that the dis- tinctions made here are simply a matter of econom- ics; Latin was only available to elites, and thus those lower down the social scale would not employ it."8 Some of the imagery I have discussed, however, is the product of good quality, and therefore expen- sive, artisanship,"9 and it is unlikely that the indi- viduals who commissioned such icons could not have afforded to incorporate epigraphy if they so chose. More fundamentally, to reduce that element of choice to a simple economic necessity is simply to fall, once again, into the trap of assuming that Romano-Celtic iconography is emulative of a met- ropolitan ideal. We should by now be wary of assum- ing that every provincial subject who could afford it would have epigraphized his or her iconography. Drawing these various strands of evidence togeth- er, it is possible to suggest that the group 3 deities, Epona, Cernunnos, and Sucellus, are neither Celt- ic deities'20 nor Roman ones. In suggesting that they are Romano-Celtic gods, however, I have tried to move beyond the related concepts of Romaniza- tion and syncretism to suggest that these are creole deities who encapsulate the limits to syncretism in Roman Gaul, and who were not actually incorporat- ed into the Graeco-Roman pantheon. They repre- Paris (Green 1986, 195). "6de Vries 1948, 276. "7Webster 1995a, 1995b. "8 This is certainly the view of Martin Henig (1984, 59), who like myself has argued that language lay at the heart of interpretatio romana (the explicit identification of Roman and non-Roman gods). Henig, however, sees this as simply a mat- ter of status, arguing that "in order to be able to 'interpret,' one must first be articulate" (ibid.). 119 See, e.g., the stone images from Meusault and Mellecy (central Gaul) in Green 1989, figs. 6-7. 120As Linduff (1979) has suggested for Epona, and Vertet (1984) appears to imply for the entire group. 222 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="15">CREOLIZING THE ROMAN PROVINCES sent an alternative creole pantheon in Roman Gaul and provide some of the best evidence pertaining to the complex negotiations that characterize Ro- mano-Celtic religion. Turning back to Santeria, an additional lesson may be drawn out with reference to the group 3 Romano-Celtic deity, Cernunnos. In order to read Santeria icons successfully-to understand the tensions and power play inherent in colonial reli- gious syncretism-it is necessary to pay as much attention to the juxtaposition of symbols (in this case Christian and Yoruba) as to the symbols them- selves. This is a point we should remember when we try to interpret the presence of Celtic attributes on representations of deities from the Graeco- Roman pantheon. This practice, like its inverse (the giving of classical attributes to Celtic gods) is conventionally seen as reflecting the problem-free syncretism of two deities. Reference to Santeria may allow us to see greater complexities to this process than formerly envisaged. In this context, Green has pointed to the tendency for some pre- and post-conquest anthropomorphic imagery from Gaul and Britain to cross species barriers, mixing human and animal traits together.'2' The horned god Cernunnos is the most obvious example here. This deity has definite pre-conquest origins,'22 and it seems likely that the representation of semi-zoo- morphic deities in the post-conquest period is a continuation, or strengthening, of earlier western European Iron Age traditions. It is thus particu- larly interesting to note that in Rome's western provinces, some images of classical deities are also given this semi-zoomorphic treatment.'23 For ex- ample, a few representations of Mercury from Ro- man Britain 24 appear to have horns in place of the god's more usual winged hair or petasos. As Green observes, it is sometimes difficult for the modern observer to determine whether horns or wings were intended, but as she points out, this may rep- resent for Romano-Celtic observers a conscious flexibility or ambiguity, allowing the spectator to see what it was appropriate for him or her to see; the classical god or a horned indigenous deity.25 Green herself126 places this ambiguity in the con- text of La Tene artistic traditions and Celtic con- cepts of liminality and polarity. Perhaps it is also possible that this type of flexibility reflects the '~2 Green 1997. 122 See supra n. 103. ''Green (1986,222-3) has also remarked on this phenom- enon. 124 Examples include a stone relief from a well at Emberton ambiguities of both syncretism and the colonial condition itself. The depiction of Celtic gods in the western prov- inces was neither a simple emulation of metropol- itan art, nor-at the other extreme-a visual ex- pression of nativist opposition to Rome. Rather, as it came into being by negotiating a spiritual path- way between acceptance and resistance, much post- conquest iconography represented a creole art form. Unfortunately, Romanization of form (the use of anthropomorphic imagery) has blinded us to what these icons meant to the people who fash- ioned and used them. Creolization, as a way to mod- el these complex processes, allows us to reevaluate these images as the active material culture through which new social identities were forged. CONCLUSION I have suggested above that, as the inadequacies of Romanization as a model for contact and culture change in the Roman provinces become increas- ingly apparent, this acculturative model should be discarded in favor of the concept of creolization, which offers a new way to approach provincial mate- rial culture in all its forms. The development of an archaeology of creoliza- tion in the New World certainly offers pointers as to where Romanists should now be looking as we at- tempt a more nuanced study of cultural negotia- tion in Roman Britain. In the Americas, the emer- gence of creole communities has always been stud- ied by focusing on everyday material culture, from verandahs, to pots, to clay pipes, to recipes. In the Roman provinces, too, colonial experience for the vast majority of people would have been acted out through the materiality of domestic life. Perhaps it is time, then, to shift the study of intercultural con- tact in Roman Britain away from elites, on whom so much work has focused, to other social categories; the urban poor, the rural poor, and that technically most invisible of social groups in the ancient world, the enslaved.
