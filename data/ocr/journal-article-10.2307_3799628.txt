Neither the preface nor Stephen Spurr's introductory state- ment adequately perfouns this needed task. The latter, especially, is a disappointment. Expanded, the introductory chapter, "The Natural Resource Ecosystem," could have pointedly developed ie need for the supremacy of the ecosystem concept in resource management; as presented, the chapter did not adequately represent Spurr's expertise in this area, nor did it offer sufficient depth or length to be a real contribution to the book. Here, too, would have been a logical place to underline our continuing inability to adequately understand ecosystems. The book gives a first impression that we now have tools sufficient to fully understand all ecosystems. Careful reading corrects this no- tion, but the authors fail to impress upon the reader the distance we still have to go. I commend the authors for pro^7iding a necessary stepping stone in the progression toward greater understanding of this eritieal eoneept. Among the human E&gt;roblems mentioned ean be included the question of how best to manipulate natural systeins toward their highest produetivity and benefit for man withollt detenoration or destruetion of iose systems. Itis book is a highly reeommended be- ginning toward answering iis partieular question through the use of eeosystem analysis in the man- agement of man's biologieally based resourees. GERALD L.

Sixty scientists £rom 19 eountries partieipated in these diseussions sponsored by the International Biologieal Program (IBP). Delayed publication and some organiza- tional difficulties appear to have been due b editorial complications.

Part 2 is a single paper introducing elementary concepts including some specific examples and data from elephants, deer, and beef cattle. Part 3 consists of five papers on population estimates, age determination7 diet measurements, metabolism, and postIlatal growth. Over half of the Guide (Part 3-31 papers) deals with the management of do- mestic and wild animals. The diversity of topics covers handling environmental physiology? repro- duction, nutrition, habitat manipuIation, epizooti- ology, and a collection of conversion factors for productivity measurements. Eleven papers dealing with habitat manipula- tion will attract the most immediate interest of contemporary conservationists in areas of herbi- cides, grazing, contolled fires, and similar topics. Other papers provide information on early aEempts to quantify a difficult area of study. As suggested by the editors, the primary value of this Guide is to provide information for future investigators to test and compare. Many techniques described will be helpful to researchers; tables and adeqllate references will aid research arld instruction. R. J. JONASN Department of Zoology, Wash£ngton State University, Pullman. The Last of the Loners. By Stanley P Young. Macmillan Co., New York. 1970. 316pp. $9.95. This book on the demise of wolves in Colorado is of historical rather than scientific content. It relates in fine narrative several case studies of wolves that gained renown as livestock killers in Colorado during the early days of government ad- minisbation of predator contc)l, beginning in 1915. AIthough local in scope, it is Americana but re- lates to a dme span of only about 8 years. The reader is likely to wonder what parallel eb were taking place eIsewhere as the era of the wif on American livestock ranges was coming to a close. Though this review should be confined to what the book ts rather than what it is not, it must be said that there is no account of the work of the research branch of the government on the development of control methods and not enough reference to the traDSitiOn from bounty hunting to a government hunter system of predator control. These are two important historical steps with whieh few people l;ving today have had personal contact. The author dida and while it is to his credit that he has produced a number of outstand- ing books on predatory Inammals, we may regret that in this book he did not have time to fill the gaps. The first third of the book is somewhat in con- trast to the main part, to which the title is more pertinent While the introduntory chapters provicle a good background for the stories of the last wolves in Colorado, there is some superficiality of treatment not entirely the fault of the author These chapters generalize the historic background too thinly but serve as a satisfactory introduction to the topic, unless one is a£ter more scholarly depth.

Evidently not much detail was recorded about methods of wolf control during the American colonial period or Young would have hunted it out. Ae weaknesses in these parts probably are inherent in the lack of historical record. Howeser, of more recent history, there is much more to the legal hassle that has pervaded the transition from bounty hunting to salaried professionals in government service than is told here. Young was one of the few men associated with the era; it is a misfortune that he did not expand this part of his book. Likewise, the efforts of the research branch to provide the hunters with the highest order of control technique is a related subject desernzing fuller treatment. Neverthele!ss, the substance of the book can be said to fulfill the author's intent and the title of the volume. The core of the book is a series of chapters devoted to the accounts of the capture of certain renegade wolves, the loners. Itere is a dulling redundancy to the description of wolf character as outlaw, renegade, or wanton killer, but this is relieved by a certain amount of vicarious excite- ment generated by the descriptions of wolf activi- ties. Some readers may feel that the author slipped into an anthropomorphic translation of wolf be- havior. Although the professional hunter is indeed clever at reading trail signs, the translation of trail signs into wolf mental processes is a long step, and to some extent it is overdone in these chapters. The literary style in places seems crossbred be- tween cowboy colloquialism and an affected form of high literary description. In places it seems that the author was carried away by the beauty and magnitude of a natural scene too enormous for verbalization. Descriptions of wolf behavior must have been created out of conjecture, particularly the parts relating the activities of wolves at night. Some of the detail laclcs credibility; for example, the description of Big Foot who campaigned at the age of 3 to lead the pack, was whipped, but came back at the age of 4 to take over leadership. It is just this kind of sleuthing that characterizes the professional hunter reading trail signs. It makes exciting reading where otherwise a narrative might drag. From time to time the author has injected into the framework of the book accounts of human interest. This is a relief from too much emphasis on wolf criminology. Although the author was himself a government hunter he seems not to have succeeded in tran- scribing the nature of the hunter into words, al- though it appears that he wanted to do so. It is doubtful if the character of the professional wolfer ean be articulated; and if this is soX there is no discredit to the author. He had a high sense of duty that is reflected in the chapter on the gosZernment hunter. This reviewer has the feeling that the sense of duty does indeed characterize the federal hunter. Howevern the attribute is not possessed solely by the government hunter, as the chapter seems to infer. To a large extent, this dedication might be the crowning tribute to the concept of predator control under governlnent supervision as compared with the bounty system. In keeping with the title, however, the book is more about wolves than about the life o£ the government hunter. In the body of the book the author takes a stand against outlaw wolves-the same stand of the livestockman during an era of western develop- ment. It can be understood only by those who have lost to the ravages of natural forces. This is a bygone age insofar as wolf predation is con- cerned, especially with the transition from open ranging to the feed-lot production of livestock. In more recent times the general public has come to view the wolf as a majestic symbol of the wilderness. The reader may not like the charac- terization of wolve!s as given by Young. This cur- rent in the bk outruns the epilogue lanenting the passing of the wolf in Colorado. The under- lying admiration that the hunter had for the hunfted, despite the tribulation each caused the other, is revealed. The impact on ie reader is hard to predict. He may be alienated by the stockman's and the wolfer's attitudes; he may not be convinced of the intent of the closing chapter. All in all, Stan Young's last book is to be cher- ished for its honest presentation of an episode in American history that otherwise might not have been recorded firsthand. Young was part of the scene. He witnessed a passing era. His account is all the more valuable in that few people with his experience have been inclined to write their experiences down.-HORACE F.

The volume has some omissions, as the author acknowledgesn but I have found it a useful quick reference.
