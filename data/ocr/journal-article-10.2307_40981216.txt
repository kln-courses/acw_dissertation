Whittaker Received: 6 June 2010 / Accepted: 7 June 2010 / Published online: 8 August 2010 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010 Abstract Despite the tendency to think that the justification of revealed truths depends on a verifiable contact with divine reality, this essay argues that the authorita- tive status of revelations is due to their role in defining a distinctively religious order of judgment. Rather than being immediately apparent to everyone, this kind of authority is local to particular forms of judgment that depend on the principles that frame these ways of thinking. Revelatory claims are logically exempted from the normal demands of justification because of this role they have as definitive judgments, and they share their immunity from ordinary forms of justification with other axiomatic principles. Yet their authority can in certain cases be challenged, and it is a secondary purpose of this essay to bring the various ways of challenging their truth to light. Keywords Revelation • Authority • Matters of principle • Divine • Human communication • Mistaken and revised revelations • Conceptual truths • Wittgenstein • Kierkegaard Because it stands apart from what many philosophers think of as rational epistemology, the concept of revelation has been relatively neglected outside of theology. Divinely revealed truths, precisely because they are revealed, are exempted from the justifica- tion that applies more generally to our beliefs. Yet the term "revelation" also covers a wide range of mostly secular intuitions - inspired ideas, hunches, premonitions, tacit insights, and so on. Most of these intuitions come to us in sudden and surprising ways, but their sudden arrival in consciousness does not necessarily imply anything special about their authority. When we speak of revelations in a religious sense, how- ever, we think of these revelations as authoritative. No doubt there are other intuitive J. H.

For it is the understanding of this issue that illuminates the nature of religious belief in general.1 In the Judeo-Christian tradition, for example, the whole body of canonical scripture is often referred to as revelation; and we often assume that every scriptural passage in the bible must therefore be accepted as an authoritative revelation. Yet as we will see, the canonical scriptures are said to be revelatory only because the fundamental teachings of the faith are drawn from it. The material in the bible, after all, includes a bewildering variety of things from poetry to the history of political infighting, from instructions of how priests should dress to predictions about the future, and from miraculous stories to historical narratives, and so on. Yet few biblical scholars think that all this material rises to the same standard of divine revelation. But what is this standard? Why do some biblical teachings qualify as religious revelations, while other teachings are largely ignored by the average believer? Part of the answer, I think, is that revealed truths are conceptual truths, not factu- ally informative truths; and the authoritative claims of revelation are made up of just this kind of teaching. They represent the characteristics of various things by identi- fying their definitive features, and it makes no more sense to demand an inferential justification for them than it does to demand such justification for definitive truths of geometry. In the religious traditions that have settled themselves around biblical teachings, then, these ideas come to possess an authoritative status because they have become the defining ideas that shape the way believers see themselves and the world. Of course, we do not have to accept these teachings as authoritative any more than we have to accept the reliability of defining principles of a way of thinking that seems alien or foolish to us. But this fact does not affect the logical status these revelations have as the definitive framework for a distinctive view of the world. Their conceptual role in defining this perspective sets them apart from ordinary, cognitive descriptions, placing them outside the reach of objective testing but hardly outside the reach of doubt. But though the truth of revelations cannot be objectively discovered, their truth can be inwardly sustained as an expression of the believer's confidence in the new way of thinking that follows from them. That is why we set them apart from hypothetical claims as authoritative ideas. They belong to a separate logical category of judgment. This authority, once again, is not unconditional or universally binding; and no one is under a logical obligation to believe in the revealed ideas of religion. Their authority is attached only to the peculiar perspective in which believers understand their lives, and thus it waxes or wanes with the sense believers find in this form of understanding. Of course, this is not the way in which the average believer thinks of revealed ideas; but it is implicit, I think, in the manner in which believers treat their basic religious ideas as matters of faith. For in practice believers do set revealed teachings apart from 1 Jaynes (1990), for example, offers an impressive, neurologically-based theory that stress induces audi- tory hallucinations originating in the brain's right hemisphere. But nowhere does he suggest that these experiences might have a logical basis as authoritative claims. â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 169 speculative opinions, and that is why they call these teachings matters of faith. Yet at the same time, when asked to explain why they accept various revealed doctrines about God as matters of faith, believers typically appeal to misleading pictures of how revealed ideas are delivered to various prophets by God. That is, they treat the divine source of a revealed teaching as the reason why it is authoritative; and while this sounds fine on the surface, it proves problematic as soon as we begin to explore the idea. Not only religious believers but skeptics as well tend to share this same picture. Revealed claims would have an authoritative status if a divine being had handed them down to prophets, but the skeptics believe that there is no reliable chain of divine transmission, either because there is no God or because a prophet's connection with God cannot be reliably established. There is, so to speak, no "parent" handing down its revelations to its off-spring. There are no genuine theophanies out of which a real God reliably speaks, as Yahweh is said to have spoken to Job. Yet such attacks miss the real the point at issue. For the point of presenting religious beliefs as revelations is to present them as conceptual truths - as practical axioms of life, as ruling principles that frame new conceptions of worth, happiness, and selfhood - and this puts them into different logical category than the basket that holds hypothetical claims. To explain the authority of revealed doctrines in an adequate way, then, we have to clarify the logical role that revealed ideas play in the thinking of believers. Problems with the delivery view Suppose we stay with the imaginary picture of revelations' delivery long enough to realize just how problematic it is. The usual conception goes something like this: God is a supernatural agent who interacts with people by selecting some of them to receive a divine message. Those who are favored in this way are God's messengers or prophets. Either the prophet hears God speaking directly to him and then repeats God's words to others, or the prophet has only a vague sense of a divine message that he must for- mulate in his own words. If we take the first of these ideas literally, it makes perfectly good sense to ask what God sounded like, whether he spoke in Hebrew, whether his grammar was always correct, whether he answered the prophet's questions, whether he spoke slowly or quickly, etc. And it also makes sense to ask the prophet how he knew that the voice he heard was in fact the voice of God, rather than say, a demon. My sense is that such questions are impertinent; and they are impertinent because they miss the point of utilizing such imagery, which is not to fill in all the details regarding what it is supposed to be like to receive a revelation, but simply to repeat the authoritative status of the prophet's claim by dressing it up in human analogies. The deeper issue here is the question of what accounts for the authoritative status of revealed claims, and to clarify this status requires more than a relatively minor adjust- ment in the picture of how the revealed doctrine came down from heaven and alighted on a prophet. It requires an elucidation of the inherent authority of the revealed doctrine itself, but that can be provided only by clarifying its logical role as a definitive truth in a particular, transforming, species of judgment. Once we understand the inherent Ö Springer</page><page sequence="4">170 Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 authority of revealed doctrines, we can take the details of their supposed transmission with a grain of salt. Here it does no good to say that the prophets realized a divine insight out of a more general pre-verbal contact with God, resulting in a prophetic insight that the prophets had to express in their own words. For this way of imagining a revealed teaching lies open to the same sort of awkward questions that plagued the literal view. What exactly is this "more general contact with God" supposed to involve? If it was a visionary, face-to-face contact, what did God look like? Did God look like a man? If it was neither visual nor auditory, how did the prophet know that his experience came from God, or that it represented an experience of God? Such questions would be relevant if the point of the story was to establish the character of a divine-human contact. But again, I do not think that establishing the specific character of such experiences is relevant to the logical status of the revelations that are distilled from them. It is perfectly understandable why those in theistic traditions might want to portray their revelatory experiences as coming from God. Conceptually understood, God is the source of truth, and the idea that revealed truths come from God definitively estab- lishes it as a true idea. For it is impossible - conceptually impossible - for God to lie. So it comes naturally to believers to imagine revealed truths as coming from those situations in which God speaks authoritatively to those who hear him. God speaks to his children just as parents speak to theirs, and just as the words of the parents carry authority for the children, so too does God's word carry authority for us - only God's authority, unlike that of parents, is absolutely authoritative and absolutely reliable. This can be said, but it is hard to imagine just how we might know that a teaching is authoritatively true by checking the details in the story of its transmission to us. What is to be done, for example, if God, the absolute authority, is beyond our understanding? Then we can never be sure that revelations came from God. And thus we would do better, I think, to understand the idea that a revelation comes from God not as a factual claim but as a conceptual truth that places revealed truths beyond the possibility of factual verification. The picture of God revealing himself to human beings simply restates this conceptual truth. To put the drift of these last remarks differently, we might say that the usual concep- tion of divine revelation is entirely anthropomorphic and should not be taken literally. The idea behind these anthropomorphic images is to insure that a revealed doctrine will enter into the believer's thinking differently from the way that a hypothetical conjecture or an empirical theory enters into it. Revelations, as it were, do not come in through the busy doorway of objective reasoning but through the side door of faith. They enter our thinking as the foundations for an altogether new - and from a secular point of view, very different - way of understanding the world. Looked at from this logical perspective, then, the authority of revealed teachings is bound up with the foun- dational role they play in a form of understanding that makes the whole world new. If they did not have this foundational role, they would not be authoritative. But this is a logical point, and the anthropomorphic way of thinking of revelations as coming from a divine source is a figurative - but also misleading - way of making this point. This new way of religious understanding, as I said, involves a transformed way of seeing oneself, a new way of thinking about true happiness, and a newly-conceived idea of true selfhood. These new ideas of happiness and selfhood make little sense £) Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 171 from a secular point of view, in which happiness is understood as if it depended on pleasure, comfort, the satisfaction of desires, the avoidance of suffering, and other so-called worldly goods, none of which are promised by faith. Faith places its trust in another kind of happiness, not "a peace that is no peace but life closed in the sod" (as one hymn puts it). This peace is not peace because it eliminates ordinary suffering but because it enables believers to withstand such suffering. That is why it is called the "marvelous peace of God."2 This same conception of real peace is also found, as we might expect, in scripture (Tim. 4:7 and in John 14:27). To trust ourselves to it requires us to give up our hold on earthly aspirations and imagine all things as being well despite the tragedies that surround us. Yet this trust depends guiding principles that lead us out of one way of seeing our fate into another. Perhaps St. Paul says it best: "all things work together for good [even life's tragedies] for those who love God and are called according to his purpose" (Rom 8:29). The very thought so jars our ordinary way of thinking about the good life that it is only intelligible from the point of view that comes by holding fast to the principles of faith. Still we know virtually nothing about how Paul "got it from God." Nor do we need to know anything about this precisely because it is offered to us as one of the first principles of faithfulness. As such, it is meant to accepted by following into a new way of thinking. That is faith's way of commending itself, not on the basis of speculative hypotheses to be argumentatively justified but on the basis of logically fundamental principles that lie at the bottom of a new way of seeing our lives. The revealed "truths of faith" are not the only teachings that fall into this category of claims that are exempted from the ordinary requirements of justification. There are, as I said, other ways of thinking that depend on first principles, and all these truths are conceptually defined rather than cognitively discovered. These principles are held in place by the form of judgment that follows from them, and in that sense they cannot be judged apart from an appreciation of the new world of insight that they open up. But since that understanding is available only by internalizing these principles in the way we think, there no possibility of assessing them apart from this internalized form of understanding. In other words, their reasonableness applies only to the systems of judgment that they conceptually underwrite, and even from that perspective their credibility does not result from data by way of inference. Nor does their reasonable belong to their general necessity; for if that were the case, then they might be intui- tively known by anyone who has learned to think, to communicate verbally, to consider questions, etc. Yet religious claims are obviously not self-evident in that sense. If they become credible at all, their credibility rests on the life of judgment that they regulate and sustain. Unlike the "delivery view" of revelations, which can suggest that revelations ought to be believed because an all-powerful God expects them to be followed, this view carries no such implications. Revelations "ought" to be believed only as the means to a higher form of judgment since it is only in the transformed life of faith that their credibility is to be found, if it is to be found at all. In this sense, their logical status gives them their authority and not their direct delivery from God to man. Saying that 2 The complete hymn can be found as number 661 in the Episcopal Hymnal (1982). â Springer</page><page sequence="6">172 Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 God sends us revelations simply repeats the idea that revelations are authoritative teachings, and this is a conceptual truth about revelations, not a truth to be checked by asking for more factual details about its chain of transmission. Thus, if the authority of revelations is to be believed, it is by directly following their implications into that new way of being in which their value appears. Further problems with the delivery view In describing the role of revealed claims as something that belongs to their logic, I am using the term "logic" in the way that the later Wittgenstein did; that is, as a normative conception that covers everything from the meaningful use of our words to the good sense involved in various sorts of judgment. The word God, for example, is properly a mystery; and this is a logically definitive truth about the concept. It means that God cannot be a being that we can see, touch, or get to know by ordinary means. Idols are the sorts of gods that can be handled and investigated, whereas the true God and cannot be studied in any factually informative way. So to say that authoritative reve- lations come from a mysterious God, then, cannot possibly be a factually informative truth about how God reveals himself; it must be a conceptual truth that says genuine revelations come from God - i.e., from the mysterious source of all saving truth. In trying to bring out the logic of revealed teachings, therefore, I am not trying to advance a novel factual theory of revelation. Still less am I trying to argue that religious ideas should be accepted as revealed ideas. My only point is to clarify the conceptual kind of issue that the religious belief in revealed truths leaves us with. Given this interest in logic, however, there is another, much simpler, point that should be noted. We commit a logical fallacy if we think that the origin of a belief, including that of a revealed doctrine, has any decisive bearing on its truth. This fallacy is the so-called genetic fallacy, and it results whenever we confuse the causal condi- tions of a truth claim with the conditions for its proper judgment. Indeed, the truth or the falsity of a message of any kind is logically independent of the conditions that give rise to it as long as these conditions are causal factors responsible for the act of belief Thus, if someone wakes up from a particularly powerful dream, saying "the events that I foresaw were so vivid, so plain, so clearly spoken that they just have to be true, he needs to be reminded that such impressions do not just have to be true. There is nothing in the vividness of dreams that logically guarantees the truth of the predictions that are derived from them simply because dreams about the future do not always come true. Here it makes no difference whether a prophet or a dreamer believes himself to have been in contact with God - or with a dead relative "on the other shore" or with any other kind of supernatural source. And if the dreamer reports the implications of his dreams in various authoritative statements, we do not have to accept these "revelations," even if we understand what has got the dreamer excited about them. We know that dreamers can be mistaken, even when they feel certain. The same is true of those who receive other powerful visual and auditory experiences. The extraordinary character of these experiences might well explain why they are caused to think that the statements are true, but this does nothing to guarantee the accuracy of their content.

I have a friend who is a prominent molecular biologist, and he has told me that he gets his best scientific ideas early in the morning just as he is waking up. In that half-awake state of mind, he has sudden insights that promise breakthroughs in the problems involved in his research. He has no idea where these ideas come from, but neither does he present these unac- countable gifts as revelations. If he did, I would understand that expression only as a reference to the sudden way that his ideas come to him;/ör / know that he always goes back to the lab to test these ideas. Here it is obvious that the circumstances in which he receives such ideas have nothing to do with the logic that governs their judgment. Even if we say that his ideas rise up from his subconscious mind, their subconscious origin changes nothing. They have no special authority because they are still scientific ideas' and as such, they require an empirical means of validation. That is a point about the logic of scientific claims, and it trumps all other considerations when it comes to assessing their truth. There is a difference, to be sure, between private inspirations and the revealed truths of religion, as the latter are reinforced by a traditional consensus. And one might think that this consensus, not their role in defining a conceptually transformed way of thinking, gives them their authority. But if this consensus represents noth- ing more than an appeal to the fact that that many people have believed - as if that might justify our belief - then it is simply another logical fallacy. To see this point, we need only consider cases in which a traditional consensus develops around objec- tively determinable truths, and the case of Galileo offers a good example. Galileo said that scientific claims about the motion of the heavenly bodies should be decided by scientific considerations, and not by the fact that a geocentric view was recorded in a book of divine truths, the church's original deposit of revelation. Even if there were a consensus regarding the geo-centric theory of the solar system, its teachings could not, in Galileo's mind, guarantee the truth of those opinions that fell within the compass of scientific or any other normal cognitive inquiry. At the time of Galileo's second heresy hearing, the Roman Catholic Church actu- ally had two views about biblical revelation, one that the Bible itself, and everything in it, was authoritatively revealed, while the other restricted biblical revelation to moral and religious, or essentially saving, wisdom. Galileo explained that the helio- centric theory of the solar system had no such salvific importance and thus could not be said to have any authority as a definitive principle of the church's spiritual teaching. Instead, the shape of the solar system is a scientific matter that stands to be determined by observational evidence, and hence the geocentric view found in the scriptures should not be authoritatively received. Yet an influential cardinal, Cardinal Bellarmine, had earlier drawn a curious distinction between everything that was immediately authoritative (the church's spiritual teachings) and those extraneous matters that were indirectly authoritative simply because they appeared in the Bible. Since the geo-centric theory is found in scripture, this meant that the geo-centric theory had an indirect but nonetheless binding authority, trumping the appropriate- ness of whatever logical standards there might be for the determination of scientific truths. Consequently, the commonly held helio-centric conception of the solar sys- tem should be believed no matter what the evidence indicated. Indeed, everything Ö Springer</page><page sequence="8">174 Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 contained in the Bible, no matter how evidentially dubious, must be accepted as divinely revealed.3 To the extent that the Church followed Bellarmine's view of biblical revelation in condemning Galileo, it made a terrible mistake, a mistake that the Church has now admitted. In so doing, the Church reaffirmed the arguments of St. Augustine and St. Aquinas, who said that Biblical revelation does not extend to those teachings that lie outside the intent of the "divine instructor," who reveals only the essential truths that people need to avoid despair and to live godly lives. This change leaves believers free to follow objective standards of judgment wherever they logically apply to the vari- ous material contained in the bible. Their judgment of historical as well as scientific claims, for example, are to be made on the basis of historical and scientific means of determining truth, not on the basis of the church's logically arbitrary consensus that biblical authority trumps these standards. By acknowledging this restriction in the concept of an authoritative revelation, the Church has avoided the repetition of the Galileo affair in modern times. And the same goes for other protestant and orthodox denominations, many of which had come to a similar conclusion much earlier. Only those matters that pertain to spiritual matters are subject to authoritative teaching. These teachings on these matters are not the product of deliberation but of grace, and they are to be accepted as the formative structure of a new perspective on our lives, our death, our ultimate values, our relation to others, and so on. Attributing such teachings to grace adds little to their authority. It too only restates their authority as divinely inspired ideas, adding only that that such graciously given ideas are not the deliberate products of human effort. Thus, for example, it is natural for us to define and pursue our prudentially understood welfare, but it is not natural to enter into a form of judgment that is tied to another conception of our spiritual good. That is made possible by teachings that are not only authoritative but also gracious. Revelations as definitive principles of judgment Thus, we come back to the point that I made earlier, that the credibility of a divine revelation depends on the life-changing effects that come after a believer enters into religious understanding through the door of revelation. Divine revelations, we might say, are truths to live by, and their most powerful commendation is the changed life of those who realize their role in awakening people graciously to a fuller sense of life's meaning. Here believing is not so much a matter of grounding revealed claims in evidence - something that logically cannot be done - but abiding in the insights that come with them by holding fast to them as reliable truths of practical wisdom. In short, authoritative revelations have a distinctive logic, and they must be com- mended in a distinctive way. The spiritual power of authoritative revelations is the power of a new principle of judgment, and what power that they might have as beliefs must be shown in the spirit of a new way of life rather than being inferred from strictly objective evidence. This is the insight that Kierkegaard was driving at when 3 See Langford (1978). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 175 he criticized Magister Adler for turning to the philosophers to confirm Adler's claims to revelation.4 Apparently Adler had been inspired by thoughts that came to him in a sudden and unaccountable way, becoming so enthusiastic about these ideas that he described them as revelations. Yet if these thoughts really were revelations in the religious sense - that is, if they were the transforming insights of a new way of being - then Adler should have stood by them in such a way as to let his changed life speak for them. He should have preached as St. Francis advised, only occasionally using words. But that was not what he did. Instead of dwelling confidently in a new way of life, he went off in search of philosophers to confirm his inspired ideas; and in so doing he confused the authority of a religious revelations by treating them as if they were hypotheses. Adler, in other words, misunderstood the logic of religious revelations. It is the definitive role that religious revelations play in a new order or understanding that rules out the logical possibility of their being justified on argumentative grounds. But there is a deeper point here. The very meaning of religiously authoritative revelations lies in the point they serve, which is internal to their proper understanding. Thus, the reg- ulative point of an authoritative claim determines what might count as an acceptable substitute for it; as any alternative expression for a revelation must bear the same internal point. Understanding the meaning of such framework beliefs is not, as we often think, a matter of grasping referential content prior to believing in them, as if this meaning were given apart from the role that such ideas play. Understanding their meaning is primarily a matter of understanding their definitive connection with a new way of understanding. Thus, in geometry we do not learn what dimensionless points are outside of geometery, as if we knew what dimensionless points are and might check the world to see if there are any out there. Rather, the point of identify- ing dimensionless points is internal to the construction of geometrical forms and the quantitative measurement of lines, angles, etc. Thus, we know what they are "about" only in making ourselves familiar with geometrical thinking, and the same goes for the principles that govern other forms of judgment. We know what they mean only if we understand the logical role that they have in a certain manner of thinking. This is why it is crucially important for those who, like Adler, advance their own private revelations; for the point of a revealed teaching must be made manifest in the demon- stration of what it means to adhere to it. In the case of religiously accepted revelations, there are teachers and saints who have already done that. The notion that misleads us here is the notion that we have independent access to the referents of such terms, as if we might find out more about objects that are conceptually defined without learning more about the world of judgment in which they figure. But this is not the case. The domain that fixes their meaning is the domain of their employment in the thought and practice of believers. In short, revealed ideas are exempt from the logical possibility of objectively certify- ing their truth. This and the suggestion that their sense also depends on their regulative role - and not on any independently identifiable referents - are the major points for which I have been arguing. I realize, of course, how strongly attached believers are to 4 Kierkegaard (1998) £) Springer</page><page sequence="10">176 Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 the idea that revelations come directly from God, as if their transmission were a matter of an almighty being passing his word along to human messengers. Admittedly, this way of picturing the delivery of revealed truths to human being serves to emphasize the graciousness that believers experience as they grow in a religious form of under- standing, since the insights of revelation do not come from willful effort on our part, nor are they confirmed by such effort. Rather, the truths of revelation seem to present themselves as new-born ideas, asking us to accept them simply by holding fast to their implications. Put in a different way, I am suggesting that it is another conceptually definitive truth about revelations that they come to us as gifts from God. If they do not come from God, they are not gracious; and if they are not gracious, then they not authoritative. Such remarks belong to what Wittgenstein called the conceptually true scaffolding, or the grammatical remarks, that characterize a religious way of thinking. Yet the real grammatical role of conceptually defined concepts is often hidden beneath their surface of our language's syntax, and the result of this is that we commonly falsely generalize about the way they acquire their sense. In this case, we think that God's gracious gift of revelations is a fact about God, and that we might check on the factual character of revelations by verifying their origin. Yet the "fact" that revelations come from God is a purely conceptual truth. It is still true in a way, but it is not a descriptive truth about an objectively given object; it is a definitive truth about God and it leaves the conceptual truth that God is cognitive mysterious untouched. Certainly, we did not find out about grace, much less about God's mysteriousness, by investigating God as an object; for then God would be an object of possible investigation and not a mystery at all. Again, therefore, we can gain no cognitively informative knowledge about how the divine mind works, how God inspires the scriptures, or anything of the sort. We have no factually informative knowledge of God's nature at all, and the truths that believers do have of God are conceptual in nature.5 So too are the truths about God's revelations. Change and disagreement These last points summarize my thesis, but to get clearer about some of the subtleties of thinking of revelations as conceptual truths, let us step back from the religious case and consider the closely related case of moral judgment. Our parents and teachers presented us with moral principles to live by, and they did so without attempting to ground these principles in argument. Instead, they taught us by authority, disciplining our behavior, and rewarding and punishing us as we as struggled to understand what we were supposed to do. All the while they repeated certain moral ideas, such as the idea that others deserve respect. Though we did not initially understand exactly what that meant, we gradually learned to act in certain ways that our teachers said showed respect for other people. Here our coming to understand moral thinking depended on learning not only how to think morally but also how to live morally; and without this practical accompaniment of our teachers' instruction and example, we would not have 5 See Whittaker (2009). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 177 been able to understand moral principles. Eventually, however, we made qualitative advances in our understanding. We realized that we were to treat other people with respect not simply because it pleased our parents but also because it pleased others and was somehow right. Had moral arguments been made to us before we had internalized any of the moral instruction that we might have been given, we could not have under- stood these arguments because we would not have understood the moral principles on which they were based. That is why the question, "how would you feel if someone did that to you," is not an argument but a thought that is intended to awaken moral understanding. No doubt this summary of our moral education is oversimplified, but the fact remains that our growth toward moral autonomy depends on a process of instruction in which we are asked to follow moral rules without being given an intelligible justification for these rules. In this process we gradually realize deeper levels of moral understanding, and these awakenings might conceivably be described as revelatory experiences. Leo Tolstoy, for example, witnessed the beheading of prisoners while he was a young man, and that experience had an unforgettable impact on his moral sensibilities. When I saw the heads being separated from the bodies and heard them thump, one after the next, into the box I understood, and not just with my intellect but with my whole being, that no theories of the rationality of existence could justify this crime. I realized that even if every single person since the day of creation had, according to whatever theory found this necessary, I knew that it was unnecessary and wrong.6 Here Tolstoy describes his awakening to a basic principle of moral judgment, but he did not describe this experience as a revelatory one. If he had done so it would have not have been because he learned that that it came from a divine source, it would have simply acknowledged the dawning of a life-changing conviction that lay deeper than theoretical reasoning. This conviction, however, did not dawn on him as an isolated principle. Rather it was a realization that deepened and expanded the moral ideas that he vaguely understood already. Once he saw these executions, the cruelty of this form of punishment inscribed itself on his conscience, not only because it seemed cruel but also because it expanded the scope of his sense that we owe others respect. Much the same thing has happened in white America's gradual realization that dawning that Negroes, women, the poor, immigrants, etc., are to be included in the principle that all people have inalienable rights. The point here is that moral insights, like religious revelations, can contribute to our moral sensitivity if they are expanded beyond the restrictions that we often assume in their scope. Rarely, however, do we say that divine revelations are required to bring about these expansions in our moral sensibility. Such leaps in our moral understanding are made possible by moral training and moral discussion itself, which is exactly why we say that such training engenders moral awareness. We do not have to say that God awakens us to moral insights, even when these insights brings us to the recognition of 6 Tolstoy (1987), p. 26. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="12">178 Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 our own internal darkness, deception, and sinfulness. Usually we simply say that we are awakened to such failings by the bite of conscience. Of course, we can and do argue over such matters, just as people argued over slav- ery in the time of the Civil War. But these arguments are largely dependent on our moral sensibilities, and there is no forthright way to change the morally undeveloped sensibilities we often find in other people. Yet there is similar need for growth in our understanding of authoritative religious principles, and to this extent our understand- ing of authoritative revelations - religious principles - is subject to change. For no matter how absolute we might think that revealed truths might be, we can and do dis- agree about their interpretation, and these reinterpretations are typically motivated by the interest people have in deepening their faith. We often think that the authoritative teachings of faith must be followed, and that is true. That is what it means to accept them as articles of faith. Yet just what it means to follow them depends, of course, on their interpretation. Our disagreements can be more fundamental than interpretive conflicts, of course. Sometimes we refuse to accept one revelatory claim and adopt another in its place, and sometimes we reject all revelatory claims. When that happens we find ourselves advocating a new religion, or rejecting religious belief altogether. But for now I am concerned with changes in accepted revelations, which cannot involve the out-and- out rejection of authoritative revelations. If a religious tradition is to retain its identity, the changes in its revealed dogmas must take place in more subtle ways, wherein the changes that are made are fashioned in the light of the tradition's more basic revela- tions. Thus if most Christians, for instance, no longer believe that God is a jealous God, or that he takes sides in our military and political disputes, the revelations that once seemed to imply as much must either be reinterpreted or treated as ideas that have since been overcome by more fundamental revelations. People might say that the first claim attributes anthropomorphic predicates to God and therefore must be inter- preted more deeply. Or they might say that the idea that God takes sides in political disputes might be challenged by the more fundamental truth that God loves us all. In both cases, the revelations in question call for a reinterpretation of their meaning or a downgrade in their status; but such changes must appeal to the original, normative, deposit of essential Christian teaching. Otherwise, those who reject various revelations will drift away from the conceptions that define the tradition. Much of the antipathy toward revealed religions arises because religious institutions are slow to change in this respect, whereas modern sensibilities tend to change more quickly. I don't expect this process to end, but the character of this change deserves notice because there is an important distinction between those who simply reject revelations as having any authority, and those who argue that a re-interpreted revelation still bears the authority of the original which is not cancelled but supposedly deepened by its reinterpretation. Some light can be shed on the process by comparing verbal reve- lations with visual ones. A visual experience requires an interpretation if it is to be turned into a revealed teaching, and this point represents an opening for changing the interpretation of traditional verbal revelations. Julian of Norwich, for example, experienced remarkable visions during a life-threatening illness early in her life; and she spent the greater part of her adult life trying to understand what these visions meant. Because these visions included religious imagery, she took it for granted that £} Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 179 they carried a religious message and described them as "shewings" that were meant to guide her spiritually. Yet what exactly did these "shewings" say? How was their secret to be identified? Eventually, she wrote two accounts of her visionary experiences, one an early and shorter version and the other a later and longer one. Both are translated as the Revelations of Divine Love.1 I doubt that any of her readers find it unusual to think of her shewings as reve- lations. They were obviously not the institutionally sanctioned revelations of official Christianity; they were, to be sure, private. Yet they have generally been accepted as revelations that illuminate Christianity's own teachings. Again, however, this would not be the case if she had interpreted her visual experiences in a non-Christian man- ner, or if she had interpreted her revelations as predictions of coming events that did not occur, or if she had used them to deny the virtues of faith, hope, and love. To remain true to the spirit of Christianity, the way in which she interpreted her visions must divulge essentially the same healing advice that is enshrined in Christianity's tradition. It also logically possible that a person might come to think of her own visual revela- tions as mistaken even when these revelations concern supposedly life-saving advice. Thus, Julian might have interpreted her experiences in her second account of the she- wings differently than she did in the first. However, the way in a person comes to think of an earlier interpretation of a divine revelation as an erroneous interpretation differs categorically from the way in which objective mistakes are discovered. This is because a personal element is involved in the acceptance of spiritual truths, which determine the form in which individuals understand their own lives. Yet our self-understanding often changes as we age, or experience tragic events, or simply become more honest about ourselves. And as we undergo such changes, our estimation of what it takes to satisfy our true selves can also change. Thus, if a young person believes that he is divinely called to a certain profession, it is because he finds himself in this calling. He feels inwardly satisfied. But if he later becomes ill at ease in this calling, it makes sense for him to say that he was mistaken about his former sense of having a divine calling. Similarly, a person who believes that she has found herself in the sacramental forgiveness of Roman Catholicism might later think that she was not coming home to her true self but only trying to live up to a persona. As she returns to her old anxieties, she naturally begins to doubt the sacramental revelations of Catholicism. Individuals, in other words, use their own sense of themselves as a guide in trying to understand divine revelations. If these teachings lead them toward inner peace and happiness, their understanding can deepen; but if it leaves them lost and searching for themselves, then the revelations that they were taught to believe in their youth require another, perhaps a newer, interpretation. Such is the way that theology itself proceeds as it tries to distill the insights that bring ultimate healing to human life. For example, in the Christian tradition, it was once widely (though not exclusively) assumed that the truth of the Christian message rules out the possibility that any other religious tradition might be true. That was the traditional way of interpreting Jesus' words, "I am the truth, the way, and the life; and no man comes to the father but through me"(John 7 Julian of Norwich ( 1 998). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="14">180 Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 14:6). But now this way of interpreting what Jesus meant is becoming dubious if not offensive to many people, and believers now find themselves in the midst of contro- versy on the subject. Was Jesus advising believers to anathematize all who do not accept the descriptive adequacy of his words, as if his teachings, and his teachings alone, were correct hypotheses? Or are there other ways of interpreting Jesus' words? Is it not perfectly possible that Jesus meant that true life was to be found by imitating his person and acquiring his virtues? Is that not the way that one finds true life by following Jesus? If so, then faithfulness is a not matter of believing in the intellectual truth of various formal opinions about who Jesus was (or is); it is primarily a matter of the believer's self-transformation. No one comes to the father unless he acquires a new sense of selfhood, a new understanding of ultimate worth, and a new manner of being. Such a rebirth brings true life, and people are guided along the way to such life by the advice and example of Jesus. To interpret John 14:6 in this way need not mean that the revelation that Chris- tianity finds in Jesus has nothing to do with beliefs. The point is that believers might change the way in which they understand Jesus' words by changing their conception of the kind of beliefs that his teachings involve. These teachings are essentially truths to live by, and such truths are not heeded unless one makes the inward change in self-understanding that they require. On this more practical level of understanding, Jesus offers spiritual healing by way of different kind of non-creedal teaching; and it is by no means obvious that his words must exclude those who find their way from selfishness to self-giving service in another set of essentially life-changing ideas. After all, if heeding Jesus' words by following his example is the medicine that heals our lives, how do we know, really know, that other medicines, delivered in other words, can not help others in comparable ways? On this issue, as I said, there is a cultural change in the way many people think. Some of those who have been reared in Christian traditions, in fact, now find less pro- fundity in the words of John 14:6 than they do in the words of the Buddha, who said that "it is not wise for a man who protects the [highest] truth to come to the conclusion that this alone is the truth and everything else is false."8 The highest truth is found in the freedom and joy of a changed life, but the Buddha did not presume to say that a similar joy is never to be found in other transforming truths by which to live. On this point, Christianity might re-interpret the words of Jesus along the lines that I have suggested. But if that happened - and I am not now arguing that it must happen - it would not change the revelatory status that Christians find in this teaching. Summary To summarize, perhaps we might list the ways in which authoritative revelations might be regarded as untruths. (1) If they are formally contradictory with themselves or with other truths one accepts, it makes perfectly good sense to reject them - although one must be sure about what they mean, and this is not easy when their subjects are held to be mysterious. (2) They can be rejected, and are rejected, when people find them 8 Rahula(1974),p. 10. ß Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2010) 68:167-181 181 pointless and fail to appreciate their force. (3) They can be rejected, and indeed must be rejected, when they claim divine authority for a matter of fact; for in that case they must be determined by the standards that govern any purely factual assertion. (4) They can be rejected under one interpretation but rehabilitated under another, as seems possible in the case of John 14:6. (5) They can be rejected when God's will is understood in relation to a specific vocation that the individual believer once thought was perfectly suited to his true nature, but which he later realizes is not what he really wanted for himself at all. In this case, the believer comes to doubt her understanding of what God's revealed will is, but not the more general understanding that God wills the best for us. Finally (6) they can be revised when God's general good will for the future is understood in terms of specific predictions of particular events, as trust in God's good will is not a matter of banking on specific events but a matter of trusting that all things work together for good for those who share in God's love. If we take the other side and imagine the positive reasons there might be for find- ing authoritative revelations credible, we might simply consider the opposite view on each of the preceding points. If the revelations that speak to a believer are not self- contradictory; if they are not pointless as truths by which to live but serve to open up truly freeing and self-satisfying view of the world; if they do not pertain to matters of observable fact but suggest ways of thinking and living in transcendent peace with ourselves; if they are subject to revised interpretations; if they do not require believers to identify God's revealed will with specific events and specific personal callings; and if they seem to have striking fit with the spiritual or existential problems that we know in ourselves, then they can be reasonably accepted as principles of faith. All of these epistemological points about religious judgment are not only com- patible with the logical classification of revealed doctrines as conceptually defined principles, local to a distinctive religious way of thinking, they suggest just such a view.
