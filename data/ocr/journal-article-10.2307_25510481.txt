<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND FOR THE YEAR 1945 VOL. LXXV AN INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN SYMBOLIC SCULPTURES OF EARLY CHRISTIAN IRELAND. By Helen M. Roe, Member. [Read 12th December, 1914.] IN his book on Christian Symbolism in Great Britain and Ireland Romilly Allen defines symbolism as a means of conveying ideas and facts to the mind by representations which are in the first instance merely pictorial. Such a pictorial representation was capable often of more than one allegorical meaning and might appear in compositions differing widely in subject. Christian symbolic work falls into three main classes. In the first are symbols which existed from the earliest times and still are employed with their original meanings ; for example, the Chi-Rho or subject of the Fall of Man. In the second class are to be included those which have ceased to be in use in these countries (i.e., Great Britain and Ireland) but are still known elsewhere, while in the third group are those symbols whose use is now discontinued both here and abroad. In this last category such symbolic representations can be divided into those whose meaning is still known, either by tradition or from written sources, and those whose meaning is now unknown and for which any attempted explanation can be, at most, only conjectural. In this paper an attempt is made to formulate a theory which may serve to recover the significance of a series of such representations whose meaning has been forgotten ; a series which, although rather small numerically speaking, is not only widely represented in Ireland and Great Britain, but has an extensive Eastern and European background. This series of sculptures has been divided for discussion into three classes or groups and, as many of the sculptures included have already been studied and variously interpreted, it has seemed LXXV A</page><page sequence="2">2 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND best to consider these explanations in detail as the sculptures are discussed seriatim. Group 1 comprises a series of designs which show a central human figure with or without animal attributes, flanked by affronted erect animals, often very grotesque, which seem to lick the man's cheeks or whisper in his ears (PL II : 3). Group 2 consists of representations of a central human figure flanked by grotesque human figures, having marked animal attributes. These animal men sometimes grip the central person and they usually appear to whisper in his ears (PI. II: 1, 2). Group 3 includes human figures with marked animal attributes. These may appear alone, in conjunction with others, be armed with swords, spears, shields or other weapons, and are sometimes found on either side of a cross shaft or in crucifixion scenes (Fig. 1:1). As the usual and accepted explanation of the examples, both from Ireland and the Continent, which are to be considered in Group I is that they are intended to represent the story of Daniel in the Den of Lions, it is therefore necessary, before proceeding to any detailed discussion of them to make a summary of the conventional treatment in Early Christian Art of the episode of the prophet Daniel and the Lions. The Iconography of Daniel in the Lions' Den The miraculous deliverance of the prophet Daniel from the peril of the Lions' Den early seized the popular imagination and appealed not only by reason of its dramatic possibilities, but by its homiletic application to the story of Our Lord, whereby Daniel was regarded as a precursor of the Saviour of the world. The most usual representations of the subject given by Coptic and Egyptian artists show the prophet in the " orant 'n position with a seated lion at either knee.2 Slight variations of this formula occur in the North African examples and there are terracotta plaques from Tunis which shew a grouping between pillars of the prophet with the lions' heads downwards in such a position that their hind parts are on a level with Daniel's shoulders.3 Whether this extraordinary position is due to the influence of representations of St. Menas flanked by kneeling camels,4 or whether it is an attempt to shew the lions licking the prophet's feet is not altogether clear. The story is frequently illustrated in the Catacombs, where the prophet is always shown with outstretched arms flanked by lions varying in number from two to six. From the sarcophagi at Aries and from the Gaulish province generally, 1 i.e., with the arms extended upwards, palms outwards.

I : 1). In some instances there are supporting figures which offer bread or food, and in a few examples there are pillars, trees or curtains which frame the design. Some of the sarcophagi show marked classic influence and the prophet wears draped garments, while in others he wears a coat and a sort of striped or pleated skirt. On the 5th century engraved glass goblet from Podgoritza in Albania, Daniel appears with two lions at his feet and the legend Daniel de Laco Leonis.6 Fig. 1. 1.?Bird-man on stone at Papil, Isle of Burra, Scotland; 2. Bird-man flanking human figure on a Merovingian bronze belt-buckle, Combles (Seine). After Holmqvist. The Byzantine Painters' Guide or Mount Athos Guide7 includes the subject amongst those for which detailed instruction as to treatment is given. The subject is to be depicted as follows. " Daniel in the Den of Lions : he is fed by Habbakuk, sent by the Angel of the Lord from Jerusalem ". With this should be compared the figures on the Gaulish sarcophagi who hold food in their hands. The Guide continues : " Daniel in the midst of a dark pit : his hands and eyes raised to Heaven. He is surrounded by seven lions. Above him the Archangel Michael holds the prophet Habbakuk by the hair. The prophet carries a basket of bread and viands which he presents to Daniel." 5 Le Blant, Edmond, ifitude sur les sarcophages Chretiens antiques de la ville d'Aries, Pis.

N., Christian Iconography, pp. 286, et seq.</page><page sequence="4">4 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND In the Merovingian and Carolingian periods the subject continued in popularity on the Continent and not only are there many monuments surviving, but also ornamental objects, which illustrate the scene of the prophet between two lions close to his knees or feet. One clasp has the legend Daninil dvo leones pedes eivs lengebant.8 On some other buckles the lions are head down wards in a way reminiscent of the aforementioned Tunisian plaques.9 When the main body of this European art is considered, it can be shown that the motives were largely derived from Coptic sources and probably reached France directly across the Mediterranean to Marseilles, whence they were diffused in northerly and westerly directions. An interesting example of the Daniel motif appears on a silver buckle from Bifrons which shows on the plate and also on the counterplate a full face half-figure of a man wearing a cloak or tabard.10 On each side of his head is a lion, a bird and an animal which may be a deer or a lamb. Although found in England this buckle is considered to be an importation from the Continent and probably, by reason of its sub-classical treatment, of earlier date than the Anglo-Saxon cemetery from which it comes. The treatment of the figure may be compared with the Killua shrine-mount11 (infra, p. 14) with which it has certain similarities. To turn now to Scotland and Ireland, in both of which countries the subject of Daniel was amply represented. In Scotland at Meigle slab No. 2 has a fine group which shews Daniel in a pleated skirt and short coat with two large lions standing at his feet, two above his outstretched arms and, above these, two small animals, perhaps lion-cubs.12 The cross at Keills bears a design which possibly represents Daiiiel&gt; although the human figure is described as : " an ecclesiastic or saint giving the benediction with the right hand and holding a book in his left. Two beasts on the side arms lick the saint's face."13 The curious position of these beasts, which are partially head downward, is probably due to the shape of the cross. With Keills should be considered the cross of St. Martin at Iona,14 as both these are situated in that part of Scotland most exposed to Irish influence. On this cross the prophet stands between two affronted rampant lions with long hanging tongues, and the arrangement is not unlike the representation which appears on the Irish cross of Arboe.15 Finally there is the recumbent monument at St. Vigean's, No. 14, which 8 Allen &amp; Anderson, Early Christian Monuments, Intro., p.

Considered as a whole the most frequently used motif follows closely the iconography of the Catacombs and the plan laid down by the Byzantine Guide, although the subject is reduced to its elements and Habbakuk and the Angel discarded, probably due to spatial restrictions and the essential technical differences between painting and scuplture. That the Byzantine Guide was familiar to Irish craftsmen seems to be indicated by some passages in the Book of Ballymote.18 The scene as shewn on the much effaced base of Ahenny North Cross has four lions arranged symmetrically, two below and two above the prophet's outstretched arms.19 On what Dr. Henry calls the Eastern or Granite Group of High Crosses the subject is of frequent occurrence. On each of the two crosses at Castledermot there are four little beasts while the cross at Moone displays all seven lions.20 (PI. I : 3.) The Ulster group has two good examples, one at Clones21 with four lions, and there are four also on the cross at Drumcliffe.22 The subject is listed as appearing on the remains of the Bray cross23, on Kells broken cross24, and again at Killary, Co. Meath25, but the details are not distinguishable from photographs. Most strongly reminiscent of the sarcophagi of any of the Irish or Scottish examples is the very clear representation on the cross of SS. Patrick and Columba at Kells, which has but two lions.26 Again at Kells on the Market Cross the story has been given exceptional prominence, as Daniel occupies the centre of the cross with two lions above and below his outstretched arms27, and the arrangement is so closely parallel to that of the Crucifixion that the importance of the story in its fullest application in Christian symbolism is remarkably apparent. As for the representation on the base of the Dysert O'Dea cross,28 in spite of the complexities of interlaced serpents round the legs and bodies of the seated beasts which flank the central 16 Alien &amp; Anderson, op. cit., p. 274, Fig. 285a. 17 Anderson, op. cit., Intro., pp. cii-cxiii. 18 Stokes, M., Early Christian Art in Ireland, p. 10. 19 Henry, op. cit., PI. 35, No. 5. 20 Henry, op. cit., Castledermot S. cross, PI. 40, No. 2, N. cross, PI. 48, No. 3, Moone, PI. 45, No. 2. 21 Henry, op. cit., PI. 65, No. 2. 22 Henry, op. cit., PI. 88 : 3. 23 Henry, op. cit., p. 140, PI. 97 : 1, 0. 24 Henry, op. cit., p. 147, Pis. 70 and 71. 25 Henry, op. cit., p. 147, Pis. 00 and 01. 26 Henry, op. cit., PI. 57 ; also Kingsley Porter, A., Crosses and Culture of Ireland, Fig. 220. 27 Kingsley Porter, A., op. cit., Fig. 231 ; Henry, op. cit., PI. 73, 23 Henry, op. cit., p. 81, Fig. 49,</page><page sequence="6">6 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND figure of the prophet, the design is found to be fundamentally in close con nection with some of the Coptic representations.29 From this much compressed survey of the iconography of the story of Daniel and the Lions the fact emerges that all the sources, Continental and Egyptian, offer an essentially similar representation of the prophet in the den. The central figure, arms raised or outstretched in prayer, is flanked by lions, seated, crouched, or even head-down ; the number varies but the posture of the animals is always indicative of abasement; with the exception of a piece of Coptic material, the interpretation of which is not certain, there is no example of the Daniel motif which shows the beasts rampant and pushing their muzzles against the prophet's head. Before leaving the subject it is of interest to remark the persistence of this design of a central figure dominating lions. It is of extraordinary antiquity and of an amazingly continuous fidelity of representation. Elamite work in Egypt, of considerably earlier date than that of Daniel's lifetime, and Sabaean bronzes30 can furnish examples which in detail and grouping might easily be taken from Irish High Crosses of the 9th and 10th centuries A.D., while on a cylinder from Susa there are figured back to back lions with interlaced tails which compare curiously with those at Dysert O'Dea. Group I. Discussion The examples included in Group 1 (p. 2, supra) are usually classed as variants of the iconography of Daniel in the Den of Lions. They show on close examination such marked divergences from the accepted convention of representation that they must be described as atypical and, in spite of the general similarity in grouping and design, are most probably unrelated to it either in their representation or symbolic content. To this atypical group belong a couple of Irish sculptures and a certain amount of Continental material. Much of this last has been considered at length by Holmqvist31, who illustrates a clasp from Combles (Seine) (Fig. 1:2), one from Montgifi and one from Tronche Belon. Another Frankish example, from Amiens, is figured in the British Museum Guide to Anglo-Saxon Antiquities (1923 ed., p. 149, Fig. 199). These four serve as good exemplars of a whole series of Merovingian artistic craftsmanship and although they are usually all stated to be derivatives from Coptic originals of the Daniel motif, their essential differences render this derivation very dubious. Holmqvist endeavours to account for their peculiarities by suggesting that they derive not from the Daniel motif, but are corruptions or misapprehensions of the well-known eastern motif of two birds drinking from a vase. This idea of the confusion of the two motives, that is, Daniel with lions and the bird-urn motif, so far from elucidating the enigmatic form of these ornaments, seems rather to complicate the matter unnecessarily. In these clasps the central figure is 29 Holmqvist, op. cit., Taf. XXXI. 30 Flinders Petrie, Decorative Patterns of the Ancient World, Pis. I, II, IV. 31 Jlolmqvist, op. cit., pp. 141-159, Taf.

TTe//^ Market Cross.</page><page sequence="9">SYMBOLIC SCULPTURES OF EARLY CHRISTIAN IRELAND 7 somewhat dwarfed by the two " lions " which stand erect and hold him with their forepaws while they press their muzzles upon his head. The position of these beasts is changed from that of the Daniel motif and indeed all resemblance to lions or to any recognisable animal is gone, the more so as the creatures wear some kind of garment which reaches nearly to their hind feet. Amongst the wonderful treasures of the ship burial at Sutton Hoo is a jewelled gold purse mount on which there are two medallions or plaques which give what is described as a stylised representation of Daniel in the Lions' Den in " the derived Frankish version."32 Although it must be acknowledged that the two rampant beasts which hold the central figure with their paws and press their gaping jaws to his head have no recognisable human attributes, the design and grouping resemble so closely the clasps here considered that they may be included with them. With these examples should be considered the sixth csntury Scandinavian plaque from Torslund, Oland, on which appears a warrior flanked by two bear-like rampant creatures which grasp him by the arms (PI. I : 2).33 With a sword in his right hand the warrior has driven the weapon into the belly of the left beast, while with the dagger in his left hand he seems to be getting ready for further defence. Later than the Torslund plaque is the trefoil brooch from Roskilde in Denmark on which, although the animals are painfully disarticulated, the essential components of the representation remain.34 An interesting sidelight on the long continued interest in this design is thrown by the ornamentation on one of the capitals of the 12th century church at Aisne, where the whispering " bears " have some kind of body covering remarkably similar to the scaly coats worn by the Torslund animals.35 Finally there are the Irish examples which must be taken out of the Daniel group. The first is the very carefully executed panel on the Kells Market Cross which portrays a central male figure wearing horns and a bull's tail, flanked by curious-looking erect animals which he grasps by their tails (PI. II : 3). Kingsley Porter's cursory judgment on this panel, that it is "merely a grotesque variation of a favourite iconographic formula," i.e., the Daniel motif, " without definite meaning," cannot be accepted.36 Such an identi fication becomes even less convincing when it is recalled that the story of Daniel is already so brilliantly represented on this cross in its fullest Christian interpretation, that a grotesque variation of the theme on the same cross would be not only superfluous but indecent. Actually this figure seems to stand in close relationship to one illustrated in the Anglo-Saxon Missal of Bishop Leofric.37 On one of the pages of this Missal there appears a monstrous 32 Antiquity, 14, 1940, 29, 37, PL XI. 33 Schetelig &amp; Falk, Scandinavian Archaeology, pp. 258, 259 ; Kingsley Porter, A., op. cit., Fig. 126. 34 British Museum Guide to Anglo-Saxon Antiquities, 1923 ed., p. 160, Fig. 212. 35 Holmqvist, op. cit., p. 147, Fig. 120. 36 Kingsley Porter, A., op-, cit., p. 83, Fig. 128. 37 Westwood, J.

The picture bears the legend " Mors ". This representation differs so widely from the more usual skeleton portrayal of Death that it may be conjectured that it symbolises not merely mortality but Death triumphant over the soul. The second Irish example is on Monasterboice West Cross, where there is a panel which shews a man flanked by two erect wolf-like animals which seem to wear a sort of shoulder cloak.38 Kingsley Porter thinks this may be a representation of the Temptation of St. Anthony, a suggestion which is really untenable on his own identification of a series of panels on other crosses with the story of St. Anthony, an example of which is to be seen on another part of the same West Cross. By Dr. Henry and also by Dr. Macalister this panel is included as an accepted iconographical form of the incident of Daniel in the Den. However, considering this group of designs as a whole, the conclusion seems inevitable that in them is illustrated some story or legend shown in symbol, which has nothing to do with Daniel, and further, from the distribution it seems to be a permissible deduction that the story, equally with its treatment, is something European and not Oriental. The Torslund example is decisive, as the deliverance of the prophet was effected by the intervention of the Angel of the Lord, and the violent measures taken by the Swedish warrior would nullify the whole effect of the miracle. It is also important to realise that the monstrous and improbable appearance of the beasts must not be attributed to any lack of skill in execution, nor to a barbaric miscomprehension of the reputed original motif ; for, from even a superficial study of the various examples, the fact emerges that what the artist wished to represent was not an animal, but a man wrapped or disguised in animal skins. Group II. Description and Discussion In the group of figure subjects next to be considered this matter of human figures masked or disguised in animal skins becomes quite explicit and the intention of the sculptors, if not the meaning of the panels, is clearly perceptible. When the distribution of this design is considered an interesting aspect becomes apparent. The design would seem to have no continental or eastern expression, and with the exception of two Scottish and one Welsh example all of this group are found on the Irish High Crosses. When these are studied it will be found that all resemble each other so closely in composition that a description of one will serve for all. On the cross at Moone, Co. Kildare, there is a clear and comparatively unweathered representation of the scene in question39. It consists of a central figure wearing a sort of long shirt or cloak, flanked on either side by two figures wearing similar garments (PL II: 1). These figures have human legs and feet, but that on the right of the central figure has a 38 Kingsley Porter, A., op. cit., p. 83, Fig. 130. 39 Kingsley Porter, A., op. cit., Fig. 120. Henry, op. cit., PL 45,</page><page sequence="11">SYMBOLIC SCULPTURES OF EARLY CHRISTIAN IRELAND 9 horned head which seems to be that of a goat, while that on the left has a bird's head surmounted, apparently, by a cock's comb. The arms and hands of all three figures are not shown. On Castledermot South Cross the arms of the figures can be seen and the central figure is gripped by the animal-men, who seem to wear long trousers.40 On Kells Market Cross41 the clothes worn by all three figures are given in considerable detail (PL II: 2), and the position and composition of the design resembles very closely the arrangement on Monasterboice West Cross.42 Other instances of the design are stated by Dr. Henry to occur on the crosses of Donaghmore and Arboe, Co. Tyrone, and Killary, Co. Meath43. Various animal heads are used, the most recognisable being goats or rams, swine, and birds. Kingsley Porter's suggestion that the panel illustrating a seated figure between two unidentifiable objects on the south face of the shaft of Kells Market Cross is another instance of the same grouping need not be taken seriously, as it presents no visible similarity with the sculptures under discussion and would in any case be redundant, as the scene in conventional form already appears on the north face of the same cross.44 Two Scottish examples are illustrated, one at Kettins, Forfarshire,45 and the other at Hamilton, Lanarkshire.46 The slab at Kettins is very much wrorn, having been used as a footbridge, but all that can now be seen of the work resembles, unlike the great majority of Scottish slabs, the Irish technique ; for the designs on it are enclosed in squared panels and appear in a ladder like arrangement, whereas the general Scottish plan was to have small designs scattered at random over the surface of the stone, or tucked into vacant spaces at the sides and under the arms of the flat ornamental cross which occupies the main area of the slab. On what remains of the Kettins slab much of the central cross is too defaced to be distinguished, but on the right of the shaft are four panels, one of which bears the design of a central human figure between two animal-men. All three wear the long garments which conceal the arms as at Moone, but the central figure has a sort of overcloak similar to the figure on the Kells Market Cross. On the free-standing cross of Hamilton the panel at the head of the cross has a human figure between beast-headed men, but it is too much effaced by weathering for any details to be discernible, except that all three figures seem to wear the long shirt-like garment. The only example from Wales is found on the cross in the Deer Park, Penmon, Anglesey where the representation is of a central figure with a horned being on his left and a horse-headed ( ? ) figure on the right.47 The long cloaks conceal the arms. On the whole the panel recalls that at Moone, but is not, perhaps, so archaic in treatment. 40 Kingsley Porter, A., op. cit., Fig. 122.

Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire, 1937,</page><page sequence="12">10 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND It has been suggested that the central figure on several of the panels in this group wears a nimbus, but it seems on close examination that this is an attempt to shew the hair worn in a sort of long " bob " such as can be seen on the page from the Book of Durrow representing St. Matthew.48 The sculptures included in this group have formed the subject of a certain amount of discussion. Henry O'Neill writing in 1857 thought that the panel on Moone Cross represented the Temptation of Christ, but did not recognise the analogous panels on other crosses and questioned their possible significance.49 Margaret Stokes merely describes the same design but offers no explanation of it.50 Crawford also makes no conjecture as to the interpreta tion of the series.51 It was not until 1930 that the late A. Kingsley Porter brought forward the theory that these sculptures represent a scene from the Life of St. Anthony illustrating the temptation of the saint by demons.52 He reiterates this theory in his larger work published in 1931 without, however, adding any material to that brought forward in the first-mentioned work.53 Kingsley Porter's suggestion has been unconditionally accepted by other writers such as Dr. Macalister54 and Dr. Henry, although the latter regards the Moone and other panels as representing the temptation of the saint, not by demons, but by seductive female phantasms sent by the Devil to plague him.55 In a lecture given before our Society Mr. Thomas Mason dealt with, amongst others, some of these panels under the description of " The Devil as Depicted on Irish High Crosses."56 The suggestion that these panels, representing a human figure between beast- and bird-headed beings, are the Irish mode of portraying the Devil is interesting, but scarcely tenable as an explanation of this extensive series and of a further related group, to be discussed later in this paper. There is in Irish art a well defined iconographical formula for the representation of the Devil of the Christian religion, which is already fully expressed as early as the Book of Kells (PL III : 1). There on the page so-called the Temptation of Christ the artist has drawn an astonishing skeletal figure, with great black drooping wings and a cruel beaky face with a long hanging crimson tongue. On Monasterboice and again at Clon macnoise the Devil can be seen in the panels of the Last Judgment and in spite of the weathering the curve of the wing is faintly discernible. That the winged figure on Christ's left hand on the eastern face of Durrow Cross is not an angel in adoration, but the Devil brought into subjection at the 48 Book of Durrow, fol. 245, v. St. Matthew. Kingsley Porter, A., op. cit., Fig. 27. 49 Illustrations of the Most Interesting Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland, pp. 7, 11. Incidentally, this interpretation is still current in Castledermot and was given to the writer not many years ago by the local grave-digger. 50 Stokes, M., High Crosses of Castledermot and Durrow, 1901, p. 5. 51 Crawford, H.

There is on a slab at Eassie, Forfarshire, Scotland, an emaciated beaky-looking figure armed with a spear.57 He seems to wear a cloak (but possibly a wing is intended) and the similarity of this Scotch slab to the Irish representations of the Devil is so marked that it must be included with them. In order to evaluate Kingsley Porter's identification of the panels with the incident of St. Anthony's Temptation, a brief survey of the recognised icono graphy of that saint in Ireland must be made. On the cross at Ruth well in Scotland there is a panel which shows St. Anthony and St. Paul of Thebes dividing bread, brought to them in the desert by a raven. This panel is surrounded by a legend scs. Paulus et A(ntonius) freger(un)t panem in deserto. The only record of this incident in the lives of these saints is found in St. Jerome's life of St. Paul (Acta SS. II Jan. die 10, 602) and no mention of it is made in the earlier Greek Life nor in the Greek Life of St. Anthony by St. Athanasius, nor in the Latin version of the latter by Evagrius. (Acta SS. Ill Jan. die 17.) With this determining panel it is easy to recognise the various Irish representations of the scene. In Ireland, however, as in most of the Scotch examples (other than Ruth well), it is the bringing of the bread by the raven which receives the emphasis, rather than its breaking by the saints, and this coincides with the prescribed treatment found in the Byzantine Guide, where this scene of the bringing of the bread is described as consisting of the two saints who embrace one another, while a raven perched on a tree holds bread in his beak, and the incident of the sharing of the loaf is ignored. The subject has a wide distribution both in Ireland and Scotland. In this country it appears on Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice ; on the North and South Crosses at Castledermot; on the Cross of SS. Patrick and Columba, and the Market Cross at Kells ; and on the Crosses at Moone, Bantry, Armagh, Killamery, Arboe and Dysert O'Dea. In Scotland the subject finds a place at Kirriemuir, No. 1, St. Vigean's, No. 7, Nigg, and Dunfallandy. In the last mentioned the two ecclesiastics are seated on either side of a cross which closely resembles in design the cross slab from Kirk Maughold, Isle of Man.58 Both these panels recall the seated saints as shown on Moone Cross. In all the Lives of St. Anthony there are full accounts of the temptations to which the holy man was subjected.59 These ranged from the appearances of beautiful women to the most terrifying collections of animals, including lions, wolves, panthers and bulls as well as serpents, vipers and scorpions. With terrible sounds these animals appeared to hurl themselves on the Saint.

The Byzantine Guide classes them amongst the miraculous deeds of the saint and gives instructions for illustrating the scene by showing the saint lying almost dead in a tomb as a result of the demons' blows. No provision for the representation of the beautiful women is included in the Guide though the subject does occur rather later in Christian pictorial art. To the writer's knowledge there are, as yet, no recognised versions of these so called temptation scenes from Egyptian sources nor is the subject illustrated in continental art of Merovingian or Carolingian times, but from the coincidental appearance on three of the Irish crosses which shew the design of the raven bringing bread to the saints, of the panel under discussion, that is, the man between beast-headed beings, Kingsley Porter " suspects " that they are intended to illustrate the episode of the Saint's " Temptation " by demons.60 He does not seem to have been aware of the panels at Hamilton and Kettins, nor that of Penmon in Wales, as he says " the scene of the tempta tion of St. Anthony does not occur in extant monuments of England or Scot land." It may be observed that the coincidence of the two designs does not hold good for Scotland or Wales. The design he considers to be " certainly Scandinavian," derived through the Torslund plaque, and the idea of animal headed men as symbolic of demons he traces ultimately from the Egyptian animal-headed deities. While the bringing of bread to the saints is definitely traceable to Coptic art there is nothing " precisely similar " in Egyptian Christian art to this motif, but, as the panel obviously illustrates the temptation of some saint, and as St. Anthony's temptation was the most celebrated of all temptations and as his life was widely known, the panels in question most probably refer to him.61 Realising, however, the difficulty of reconciling the details of the panels with the accounts given by SS. Jerome and Athanasius of the temptations of the Saint, he says that the sculptors in Ireland must have had access to some version of the Saint's Life, other than those which have survived. This summarises Kingsley Porter's case for the identification of these panels with the scene of the temptation of St. Anthony, a case which has been accepted by all subsequent writers despite its obvious lack of supporting evidence. Bearing in mind that this design of a man between twTo men disguised as animals is confined to Ireland and to the two allied cultural provinces of Scotland and Wales, the only permissible deduction to be drawn is that the subject expressed by this motif is one of Irish origin, and, while it may symbolise a temptation, the protagonist cannot be identified with St. Anthony ; and certainly not on the strength of an entirely hypothetical Life of the saint; which Life must be supposed not only to be lost, but the information contained therein to have been confined to Irish craftsmen. 60 Kingsley Porter, A., An Egyptian Legend in Ireland in Marburger Jahrbnch fur Kunshvissenschaft, 1930, pp. 11-14. 61 Kingsley Porter, A., Crosses and, Culture of Ireland, p. 86, Fig. 140,</page><page sequence="15">Platb IIL3 [Facing page 12.

Description and Discussion Although the sculptures just discussed have been shown to be confined to Ireland and its allied cultural provinces, Scotland and Wales, there remains yet another series illustrating analogous grotesque figures, which has a much wider distribution both as regards space and time. In this third group are comprised human figures with marked animal attributes. These may appear alone, in. conjunction with others, or sometimes on either side of a cross shaft, or in crucifixion scenes. Scotland furnishes a large number of these animal-men. On the stone at Papil, Isle of Burra, are two figures with birds' beaks and legs, human bodies and arms, wearing knee-length tunics and each armed with an axe. These bird-men peck at a human head. Originally, more of the human figure may have been discernible, but the stone has scaled away (Fig. 1 : l).62 The beaky and winged figure at Eassie, armed with a spear, has already been mentioned (supra, p. 11). On Glamis slab No. 1 is shown a figure with a beast head and wearing a tunic, which was originally affronted to another figure of which now only the end of the tunic and the legs and feet remain. Allen described the beast-headed figure as having an axe over his right shoulder, but it is possible that a rope or lasso is intended.63 At the bottom right hand corner of slab No. I at Inchbrayock there is a very tall figure with a horse's head. He wears a tunic with a belt or baldric ornamented with a key pattern. In front of him stands a small man armed with a stick. The beast-man seizes with his hand the little man's long hair which is finished in a sort of coil. This again may possibly be a rope.64 Two animal-men armed with swords and shields are engaged in combat on the slab at Murthly. The figure on the left has a bird's head and that on the right has the head of some animal. There is a long tail or queue hanging from the back of the latter head which terminates in a coil similar to the Inchbrayock example.65 At Rossie Priory at the right-hand top corner of the ornamental central cross (i.e., above the right arm) is a bird-man in a knee-length tunic armed with an axe with which he threatens a bird.66 On the same cross-slab at Hamilton on which occurs the panel illustrating the subject of Group II, there are also to be seen, on the right arm of the cross, an animal-headed man, and on the left side of the shaft two similar figures.67 Prom the Isle of Man figures very similar to these Scottish examples are recorded. The inscribed and sculptured monuments of this region are, according to Kermode to be divided into two chronological groups?a pre-Scandinavian 62 Allen and Anderson, op. cit., p. 11, Fig. 6. 63 Allen and Anderson, op. cit., p. 221, Fig. 223a. 64 Allen and Anderson, op. cit., p. 224, Fig. 235a. 65 Allen and Anderson, op. cit., p. 306, Fig. 321. 66 Allen and Anderson, op. cit., p. 307; Fig. 322a. 67 Allen and Anderson, op. cit., p. 471, Figs. 501c and 501d.</page><page sequence="17">14 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND and a Scandinavian.68 Only one of the pre-Scandinavian monuments bears a figure analogous to those under consideration and the resemblance is not very marked. On the cross-slab at Bishop's Court, Michael, there is a figure with a somewhat bird-like head, a human body and human limbs. He is seated with one arm flexed and resting on his updrawn knee, his hand supporting his chin.69 This figure may be compared with the crouched birdman on Castle dermot N. Cross (PI. Ill: 3). On the later Manx slabs which are to be classed as definitely Scandinavian in inspiration there are various sculptures to be mentioned. At Jurby is a bird-headed figure wearing a buttoned tunic with a short skirt or kilt. In his right hand he holds a long staff from which, by a rope round its neck, a dog-headed figure dangles.70 Three bird-headed men appear on Grims Cross to Hromund.71 One is armed with a spear and a sword, one with a dagger and the third has a sword. One of these figures is head downwards. On a slab at Michael there is a bird-headed man whom an eagle attacks.72 With these examples from the Isle of Man may be included the curious group on the wheel cross at Kirk Braddon where two monsters with fanged jaws and long tongues lick a human head between them ;73 it affords an in teresting comparison with the Papil stone described above. This design is to be identified, according to Kermode, as an illustration of Daniel in the Lions' Den, and he states that Allen's interpretation of the motif is wrong. Allen has included this monument as an example of a wide spread group of which the motif is a human head between two monsters which chew or swallow it, and suggested that this art formula may often be recognised as representing the incident of the prophet Jonah and the whale.74 The least difficult of identification of this group illustrates the swallowing and subsequent disgorging of the prophet by means of a human figure extended between two " whales " one of which swallows the prophet's head and the other regurgitates his feet. While it is possible that Kirk Braddon may represent this iconographical formula, it is most unlikely that the identification of it with the story of Daniel can be sustained,* and it may well be a more elaborate version of the ancient and very widespread decorative motif of affronted creatures with a disc, boss or human head between them. Such creatures, although often highly stylised and grotesque, have no human characteristics and therefore should not be included in this group of beast-men sculptures. The Killua shrine mount75 and also parts of the mounting of the Stowe Missal display an exceedingly interesting treatment of this motif of a man between two monsters ; especially note worthy is the obvious Scandinavian manner of the treatment of the human 68 Kermode, P.

Some examples of animal-men are available from Northumbria, from two crosses, one at Kirklevington and the other at Lancaster.78 On the Kirk levington cross, of which only a fragment remains, two beast-headed men in knee-length tunics hold between them the mast-like shaft of a Northumbrian cross ; above their heads but now unconnected with the shaft are a pair of human feet, possibly those of Christ crucified. At Lancaster two beast-men, one with a long hanging tongue, stand on either side of an ornamental cross. They wear long garments which conceal their arms. Another example of Northumbrian work is the well-known Franks Casket of carved whalebone, which is generally attributed to the beginning of the 8th century.79 On this appear scenes of varying content, some scriptural, . others historical or relating to classical mythology ; and some devoted to incidents from the Germanic myths. Most of these are explained by the accompanying runic inscriptions. On one panel mainly portraying scenes from the Sigurd epic, there is included amongst the recognisable features of the hero's death and burial, a human figure in a knee-length pleated garment with a cloak or cape of feathers. This figure has a horse's head and holds two leafy branches which it appears to taste or smell. The figure is seated on a small mound and is confronted by a warrior armed with a long spear and a circular shield. Before turning to the Irish examples of these animal-men sculptures, there is some material from Scandinavia to be mentioned, and one instance from Bavaria. Two bronze plaques, one from Torslund and the other from Vendel, present some curious details.80 The first has a dancing human figure armed with two spears or long poles and wearing a sword. On its head it has a helmet with two widely curving horns and beside it stands a bear-like figure also carrying a pole and armed with a sword. The " bear " has human hands and feet. The other plaque shows a warrior, naked to the waist, below which he wears long trousers. He carries an axe and holds by a heavy halter an animal with a body covered with a sort of basket-work or scaly coat very similar to that on the animals on the " Daniel " plaque from Torslund. This beast has a long, pointed, fanged snout with a hanging tongue. Both these Scandinavian plaques are earlier by a century or more than the Scotch or 76 Henry, Irish Art in the Early Christian Period, PI. 49b. 77 Historical and Descriptive Notes of the Ecclesiastical Remains at Glendalough, Co.

Still earlier and also Scandinavian are the animal-men which appear on the Gallehus horns.81 As the horns are unfortunately lost, evidence of their ornamentation is available only from an illustration. From this can be seen an animal-headed man brandishing a sword in his left hand and a figure with widespread horns carrying a spear, a sword and perhaps a round shield. Contemporary with, or possibly slightly earlier than, the Northumbrian Franks Casket is a device on a scabbard from Gutenstein, Baden.82 This has a horse-headed figure wearing a wide skirt with a lozenge pattern. The figure has human arms and feet and holds a spear. In comparison with Scotland, Ireland has relatively few of these animal men, but although not numerous the examples are of considerable interest. On the northern face of the base of Castledermot North Cross there is a representation of a bird-headed being bound by ropes into a crouched position.83 From the back of this figure's head there comes a long coil which is finished off into a formal design, but which seems to be the same feature as was noted at Inchbrayock and also at Murthly (PI. Ill: 3). At Kilkea Castle not far from Castledermot there is set in the wall a carved panel which bears a detailed group consisting of a man partially clothed, who seems to have a cow's tail.84 He wrestles with another human figure. This figure has a boar's head with projecting tusks and wears a sort of quilted jerkin. A bird flies between the men and both are being harassed by a biting dog, or perhaps a wolf is intended. There is also a curious account of this stone which suggests that what is here described as a male figure is instead a female one and that she " nurtures at'the breast an eagle." The animal-man's head is thought to be that of a fox rather than a bear's, but as the tasks are very clearly shown this seems an unlikely identification.85 The remaining examples are all analogous to but not so clear as the figures at Kirklevington and Lancaster. On Kells unfinished cross,86 on Inishkea North Cross87, on Castledermot South Cross,88 and on Clonmacnoise South Cross89 at least one of the two soldiers at the crucifixion is animal-headed. None is easily distinguishable, but the head is that of a snouted animal. The numerous examples just listed have received surprisingly little attention and scarcely any attempt has been made to explain the significance of these representations of men wearing a beast disguise. Collingwood suggests that their presence in the Northumbrian crucifixion scenes serves to intensify the horror of the death of Christ. The Franks Casket has been thoroughly discussed by many writers. Elis Wadstein identifies the horse-headed figure with 81 Schetelig and Falk, Scandinavian Archaeology, p. 208, PL 36. 82 Holmqvist, op. cit., Taf.

He says further that the interpretation of this horse headed figure is difficult and suggests that it " is a sprite of some kind in the form of a nymph, the animal head not being as we often find to be the case on the carved stones, a deliberate monstrosity, but a pleasing finish to a fanciful mythological creation." For the sculptures in Man, Ker mode is fully satisfied that they are all to be explained as illustrating scenes from Norse Sagas. For Jurby he quotes an incident from the Voilsunga Saga where a father hangs his son at the instigation of Odin. The bird-headed figure is to be taken for Odin himself ; for Odin is called " Arnhofthi," the eagle-headed. The dog-headed hanged person remains unaccounted for. The bird-headed beings on Grims Cross to Hromund are gods and heroes and the bird-headed man at Michael is again Odin him self, complete with raven. Norse mythology must also provide, according to Schetelig, an explanation of the figures on the Gallehus horns, which are therefore to be considered as anthropomorphic representations of the Norse gods, but in the absence of contemporary literary sources this identification cannot be considered certain ; for the plaques which were used as decorations on helmets, ultimately Roman in type, but introduced into Scandinavia through the medium of the South German people, he suggests a comparison between the fabulous animals which appear on them with some of those which appear in the Old English poem of Beowulf. Holmqvist deals at some length with the subject of animal-men, but his main pre-occupation is to establish a Coptic or oriental origin for all Continental art forms of the Merovingian period ; and, grasping at Kingsley Porter's suggestion that the animal-men in the so-called Temptation of St. Anthony on Irish Crosses were directly derived from Anubis and Horus, he is able to include them as being of Egyptian origin. However, the general incidence of these figures in the art of the British Isles is ignored by him. In support of his argument for a Coptic origin for the " Daniel " motif or the other grotesques noted by him, he instances an Egyptian motif which shews a man on foot who fights with a lion, a bear, or a boar. Such combat scenes are found on Coptic materials and Tunisian terracotta plaques of the fifth and sixth centuries, A.D. Derivatives and variations of these themes are frequent in Merovingian art. Some representations show the animal held by a rope or lasso and this design may be derived from a Byzantine plaque from Hamadieh in Asia Minor. On this last an animal-man is held in a halter or a noose and on the reverse of the plaque the same animal-man is shown bearing a shield. According to Holmqvist all these designs stem ultimately from representations of Horus and Anubis, and he endeavours to account for their penetration through the European mainland, and even to the distant Scandinavian peninsula, by the LXXV B</page><page sequence="21">18 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND diffusion of gnostic Abraxas amulets on which such armed, animal-headed beings frequently appear. Miss Stokes devoted some space to the consideration of the bound bird man on the base of Castledermot North Cross which she conjectured to be a representation of a crouched burial with the symbolic meaning of Death, i.e., Paganism overcome by the power of the Cross. She drew a comparison from the Byzantine Guide which provides for a tomb below the Crucifixion where the bones of Adam are washed by the Saviour's Blood?a comparison which, however, does not seem very helpful in the elucidation of this whole class of sculptures of which the Castledermot bird-man is but one. Miss Stokes* description of the Castledermot panel as illustrating a crouched burial is accepted by Mr. Mason, and in his opinion the figure represents the Devil, dead, bound with grave bands, and buried in the position of the pagans, and symbolises the triumph of Christ over Satan.90 The ithyphallic panel at Kilkea has been included without apparent justi fication by several writers in the class of grotesque figures known as Sheela na-Gigs or Evil Eye Stones, but no attempt seems to have been made either to establish its chronological place or its stylistic affinities with any other sculptures. Conclusion A comparatively large number of sculptures has now been considered. It has been found possible to subdivide them into classes or groups and on analysis these have been found to have one common factor ; they all represent, more or less clearly, men wearing animal or bird masks. The sculptures are all approximately contemporaneous over a somewhat prolonged period, viz., 8th-llth centuries A.D. so far as the Irish, Scotch, Manx and English examples are concerned, while the Scandinavian and European specimens are earlier, with the Egyptian and Oriental prototypes, if they be so considered, earlier still. The connecting links between these earliest examples and the Irish and allied figures do not seem strong enough to bear the full weight of the long connections, not only in time, but in geographical distance ; and too much stress, therefore, should not be laid upon them. The persistence of these figures, on the other hand, under Scandinavian influence must not be over looked and whatever be their ultimate origin, the cultural connections between Scandinavia and Ireland, Scotland and Man are significant. The' interpretation of these sculptures then takes on a two-fold aspect : that is, what explanation may underlie their representational content, and what may have been their symbolic meaning. A distinction between pictorial representation and allegorical or symbolic content must be drawn ; and further, it must again be stressed that from such early pictorial representations, in spite of essential formal similarities, more than one allegorical lesson might well have been taught. To consider the first part of the problem and to ascertain ??J.R.S.A.I., LXXII (1942), 131-5.</page><page sequence="22">SYMBOLIC SCULPTURES OF EARLY CHRISTIAN IRELAND 19 if possible the originals of such masked persons, recourse* must be had to traditional and literary sources. Bearing in mind the noteworthy Scandinavian and North Germanic associa tions of these figures, evidence may be sought in the saga material which has survived, and the essential homogeneity of the Northern European mythologies makes it possible to treat such sources as a whole. In the Icelandic Njalssaga there is a brief account of a powerful sorcerer who, when he wished to bring a magical mist of confusion on his enemies, wrapped his head in a goatskin before pronouncing the incantation ;91 while, again from the same saga, the mysterious being who appeared in Flosi's dream and called the roll of those men about to die was wrapped in a goatskin. The enigmatic " Hos " of the Franks Casket doubtless belongs to this same Northern magical group and may perhaps represent the form taken by Sigurd's " fetch " which appears before the hero's death. Such fetches or spirit followers are frequently mentioned in the sagas and often appeared in animal or bird form when they brought warning of impending disaster or death to the* individual to whom they belonged. So far as England is concerned there is a little direct literary evidence that the custom of wearing animal disguise existed amongst the Anglo-Saxons late in the 7th century, when Theodore of Canterbury found himself compelled to condemn as " devilish " any " who goes about as a stag or a bull .... dressing in the skin of a herd animal and putting on the heads of beasts."92 About the middle of the 8th century the clergy in Northumbria seem to have been troubled by the persistence of some sort of horse cult and endeavoured to suppress it by threatening with extreme penalties those (especially Norse men settled in this area) who made a practice of the ritual eating of horse flesh.93 Such a custom is mentioned also in some of the sagas where it is regarded with horror by those Norsemen who had become Christian. It is clear that a prohibition presupposes a practice, and the fact that the wearing of animal disguise had to be prohibited in southern England suggests that the custom had prevailed amongst the invading Germanic peoples and was continued by them to some extent at least, till a comparatively late date. So far, from these scanty references, it seems reasonable to assume that the wearing of animal masks was a pre-Christian custom among some North European peoples and that it was closely associated with magic and the supernatural, and further that such a practice was not unnaturally viewed with disapproval by the Christian Church. But when the case of Ireland is considered difficulties immediately arise : in this, as in so many other respects, Ireland occupies a peculiar position. So far as may be judged from the tales which have survived, her mythology has little or no relationship with the Northern European folk beliefs ; it is practically impossible to recover any direct information on pre-Christian 91 Dasent, Sir G. W., The Story of Burnt Njal, Intro., pp. xix, xx, also pp. 23, 25L 92 Thorpe, E., Monumenta Ecclesiastica, II, pp. 32-34, Liber Poenitentalis. 93 Ridgeway, Sir Wm., The Early Age of Greece, Pt.

However, in many of the secular tales there are incidents which seem to indicate that this custom of animal disguise was not unknown : there are talking animals and birds, wolves which are sometimes human beings and even Christian, .and also in the Lives of some of the saints there are hints of some such " human " animals. There are the wolves whom Molua pitied so greatly that, to the scandal of his community, he gave them a yearly feast in his house at Kyle, having first knelt to wash their feet.94 Something more than ordinary wild beasts was dreaded by Sadhbh when she erected the massive walls round Seir Kieran, near Birr, while from the same place comes the curious story of the great birds which screamed and stamped upon the grave of the Christian King Cearbhall.95 Perhaps the most unequivocal account of masked persons is to be found in the well-known tale of the Togail Bruidne Da Derga.96 There is the coming of the mysterious sire of Conaire Mor, who appears to the hero's mother as a great bird and who " leaves his birdskin on the floor of the house," and later there is the encounter between Conaire and the white and speckled birds, which when challenged by him quit their birdskins and attack him with swords and spears, and subsequently give him political counsel for his future eonduct as High King. These bird-men have apparently ensured the appearance of the appropriate omens at Tara to make manifest the young man's claim, and the whole incident seems to be some sort of initiatory test conducted by the official sorcerers or priests. In spite of the widespread adoption of the new faith by the people of Ireland, a certain number of pagans remained unconverted and consequently many pagan practices and beliefs persisted for some considerable time. These unconverted persons were not unnaturally hostile to the Christian teachers and seem to have banded themselves together to harry the saints and their followers. These are the companies or bands of " laymen " who are " vowed to evil" (duodecim layci votum malum promettentes), who are also called disciples or " scholars of the Devil " (scola diaboli occurrit eis vexilla in capitibus habentes) whose terrifying appearance is enhanced by something worn on the head which is also described as the outward badge of their evil trade. From their ranks also came those magicians who were a source of trouble to the saints by deluding with tricks of glamour and fallacious appearance crowds of simple people (coram eis signa fallaciae faciebet), who were so impressed that they accorded the magicians divine honours (divinumque honor em dabant ei). Although in sum these vestiges afford but a precarious foundation on which to base an argument, they seem yet more stable than a theory which invokes the aid of Horus and Anubis to account for the appearance in Irish 94 Plummer, V., Vitae SS.

The most cogent objection to the premise which postulates a native source for these representations is the question of their dating. At first sight it would seem unlikely, or indeed incredible that such a non-Christian practice should have continued so long as to present an intelligible picture in the 10th century A.D. in a country which had already by that time played such an outstanding part in the establishment of Christendom. When Miss Stokes interpreted the bound bird-man at Castledermot as a crouched burial, she was moved to wonder that such a form of burial should have been known so late as the erection of Castledermot North Cross. This question of the dating seems to be answered by two pieces of evidence, the one from literary sources, the other factual, which go to show that much which seems to modern minds irreconcilable with Christian practices did continue to a very late period. There is a considerable body of legal material pointing to the persistence and public acceptance of many curious customs ; for example, there is a group of laws97 quite late in date, relating to marriage, which covers the legal aspects of degrees of marriage with a number of wives, ranging on a descending scale from the head wife to what is described as the " woman in the shrubbery." As regards the crouched burial there has come to light in a 10th century cemetery at Castleknock, Co. Dublin, a perfect example of a crouched burial which was strictly contemporary with the normal extended burial, with the feet to the east, of the other bodies on the site. To turn to the second aspect of the problem of the interpretation of these sculptures, their allegorical or symbolic meaning, if any, must be sought. So far all conjectures about them have assumed that their connotation is evil, and this seems reasonable enough in view of the ecclesiastical condemnation of the custom of wearing masks as devilish, and by reason of the association of this custom with non-Christian practices, and possibly the belief that the evil spirits take on the form of black birds may have some basis in this custom and also help to make explicable the representation of a bird-man.98 But obviously many of these animal-men are purely representative in character and were not intended to serve any symbolic purpose. The Gutenstein scabbard, the Scandinavian helmet plates and most of the Burgundian material are entirely secular objects and at most can be considered as talismanic or prophylactic illustrations of divine or semi-divine personages, intended to afford protection or good fortune to the owner of the objects. The close relation ship between all these masked figures can be accounted for by the widespread common features in Germanic and Scandinavian mythology. Little more can be said for the Manx cross slabs, where all this profusion of non-Christian material was apparently intended to enhance the power and prestige of the subject of the memorial and doubtless that of his surviving relatives by testifying to their descent from some mythological or epic hero. The Scotch monuments are rather more difficult to assess ; their Christian " feeling," if it may be so described, is so much more marked than is the case of the Manx 97 Power, Nancy in Studies in Early Irish Law, R.I.A., 1936, pp. 81-108. 98 Tirechan Collectanea, 38.

As regards the various Irish examples included in the so-called Temptation of St. Anthony with their companion panels from Scotland and Wales, it has been shown that the grounds for this identification are not unassailable. While this picture of a man between animal men or demons may represent a temptation, there is an interesting comparison with a French sculpture (slightly later in date) of which the meaning is known. On the tomb of Dagobert at St. Denys there is a scene which shows the Frankish king naked except for his crown, his hands clasped, and standing in a boat between a hairy beast and a dog-headed monster who grip him with their paws, while in the prow sits Fig. 2.?Detail from the Tomb of Dagobert. After Didron. a bird-man holding an object like the mirror shown on so many Scotch slabs.99 This illustrates the carrying off to hell of the king, body and soul, by a troop of demons, a fate from which he was only saved at the last moment by the intervention of SS. Martin, Denys and Michael (Fig. 2). A parallel to this Frankish tale is found in the Life of St. Canice as given in the Codex Kilkenniensis100 and also in a tract included in the Book of Fermoy101 there is an account of how, when on one occasion the saint was in retreat on the island in the Stagnum Cre (Monaincha), he beheld a cloud of demons hastening by on horses (vidit turbas demonum sedentes super equos secus se festinantes). When the Saint asked them their business they told him that they were hurrying into Munster to carry off the soul of a certain rich man. To them St. Canice said : " Come and bring me word for this soul is mine." After some time one of the devils returned, lame, sore and sorry (tristem valde) and without his horse. He reported to the Saint that by the intervention of St. Patrick and a host of angels, armed with fiery darts, the soul of the rich man had been delivered out of the demons' hands. 99 Didron, A.

The Sunday, usually the last Sunday in July, is now known as Garland Sunday and is chiefly kept as an outdoor festival to celebrate the first harvesting of the potato crop. Some such story, popular and Irish in its essentials, may well have been illustrated by this series of sculptures of exclusively Irish distribution. Summaby The series of designs dealt with in this paper are the representations in Ireland of a widespread group of figures of grotesque aspect which are basically human and are distinguished from the normal by having marked animal attributes. Such beast-men are found in distribution both geographically and chronologically from Egypt to the Hebrides and from the 2nd century to the 11th and 12th centuries A.D. They may appear on purely secular objects or, in conjunction with scenes of Christian tradition, on sacred monuments. Their origin is to be sought in pre-Christian myth and legend, whether the divine protagonists of the Egyptian theogony or magico-religious figures of Germanic and Scandinavian mythology. For Ireland in particular the suggestion is made that the pagan priests or sorcerers assumed animal disguise in the fulfilment of their ceremonies. Their appearance on Christian monuments must, therefore, be assumed to bear a symbolic significance of evil and from that it is but a step to their employment as illustrations of demons and evil spirits. Ireland has been shown to be the only source of one particular grouping of these animal-men, viz., the scene, hitherto described as " the Temptation of St. Anthony," an identification untenable on various grounds and which seems more satisfactorily explained as representing some such local tale as the story of the attempt of demons to carry off to Hell the soul of Crom Dubh, the rich man of Munster. For the man between the whispering grotesque beasts it seems probable that a Scandinavian or Teutonic origin may be postulated as is also the case for the animal-men appearing either singly or in conjunction with others. No astonishment need be felt at the employment of such northern or Germanic material in what is otherwise the distinctive and individualistic Irish mode, for as Clapham has demonstrated this Irish mode must have been evolved and consolidated by the Irish ecclesiastical craftsmen in Northumbria from the medley of art motifs of the early centuries in England and brought with them thence into Ireland on the rupture of Anglo-Irish clerical relations consequent upon the decisions of the Synod of Whitby.102 In Ireland, a country which had already long prevailing connections with the southern Gaulish provinces, this mode of revived Celtic forms, combined with motifs of Mediterranean, Coptic, Spanish, Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian origin, gave rise to the justly famous beauty, competence and, in the last analysis, originality of Early Christian Art in Ireland. 102 Antiquity, 8, 1934, 43-57.</page></plain_text>
