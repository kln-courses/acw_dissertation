<plain_text><page sequence="1">Male Starlings Delay Incubation to Avoid Being Cuckolded HARRY W. POWER, ELIZABETH LITOVICH, AND MICHAEL P. LOMBARDO Department of Biology, Livingston College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903 USA Sperm competition is an inevitable result of anisogamy (Bateman 1948, Trivers 1972). Cuckoldry is a form of sperm competition peculiar to organisms exhibiting extensive male parental care and can be defined as a male's involuntary rearing of another male's offspring as a result of the latter male (the "cuckolder") having inseminated the mate of the former male (the "cuckold"). "Cuckoldry" is not properly an anthropomorphic term, because its root ("cucu") and usage to describe human behavior go back at least to the 14th century, when the nest parasitism of cuckoos (Cuculus sp.) was used as an analogy for describing marital infidelity (Oxford English Dictionary 1933). Moreover, there is no replacement term for "cuckoldry," and it correctly describes a behavioral complex found in species exhibiting extensive male parental care. "Cuckoldry" as a technical term in evolutionary biology differs from the "nest par- asitism" of the bird whose name provides the root word for "cuckoldry" in that in "cuckoldry" the sperm of a parasitic male is substituted for the sperm of a host male during fertilization, whereas in "nest parasitism" the egg of a parasitic female is added to (rarely substituted for) the egg of a host female during laying. Cuckolding another male should be generally favored, but being cuckolded should be always disfavored, because the cuckold (1) fails to reproduce his own genes or reproduces fewer of them, and (2) promotes the spread of a competitor's genes as though they were his own. Thus, behaviors preventing cuckoldry can be expected to evolve in tandem with male parental care (Trivers 1972, Alex- ander 1974). Here we present evidence of such behaviors in European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), including evidence that males avoid participation in incubation until after the end of laying in order to avoid being cuckolded. Previously, it was known that (1) male Starlings provide extensive parental care, including participation in incubation with females (Kluijver 1933, Kessel 1957), (2) incubation begins before the end of laying in New Jersey (Crossner 1977), and (3) copulation continues throughout laying (Kessel 1957). Viewing these facts in the context of cuckoldry risk, we predicted that (a) only females would incubate before the end of laying, because males could not guard their females from insemination by other males if they themselves were incubating, and (b) males would monitor their mates more closely before the end of laying than after it. We studied Starlings breeding in our trail of 120 nest boxes on the Livingston College campus of</page><page sequence="2">April 1981] Short Communications 387 Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey during the nesting seasons of 1978-1980. Twenty-five nests were watched from parked automobiles by a team of 25 trained observers every day during the laying and incubation periods until 2 days after we had determined that both sexes incubated at each nest. Nesting phenology was determined by daily nest censuses. One member of the pair at each of eight nests was marked, allowing ready identification of gender. At the other 17 nests, gender was determined by eye and mandible color. Females have light, yellowish eyes and pink patches at the bases of their mandibles, while males have dark, brownish eyes and blue patches (Witschi and Miller 1938, Bullough 1942). We found that we could use these characters to distinguish genders reliably when we positioned vehicles so that the birds were in good light. Sexing of birds was easiest when they poked their heads out of their entrance holes just before leaving their nests, because they nearly always paused at that time, affording a clear view of their faces. The onset of incubation was determined by noting the amount of time birds spent in their nest boxes and by touching eggs to determine whether they were warm or cold. At 14 nests, this "touch test" was performed during each nest census, and its results were compared to the results of behavioral observa- tions. At 8 nests the touch test and behavioral observations indicated the same day of onset of incubation; at another 3 nests the touch test indicated the onset of incubation to be a day earlier than behavioral observations did, suggesting laying may have occurred just before the census; and at the remaining 3 nests the touch test indicated the onset of incubation a day later than behavioral observations did, suggesting that the birds at these nests may not have been incubating even though they were spending long periods in their nest boxes (Kenneth A. Crossner pers. comm.). Despite this variation, behavioral observations always indicated the onset of incubation within 1 day of the time indicated by the touch test. Our results bearing on prediction (a) indicate that, in all cases, females began incubation before males (Sign Test, n = 25, x = 0, P &lt; 0.0001). Twenty of 25 females began incubation before clutch comple- tion, 3 females began incubation the day of clutch completion itself, and 2 females began incubation the day following clutch completion. No male began incubation before clutch completion, and only one male began incubation on the day of clutch completion itself. These results corroborate prediction (a). Males monitored the movements of their mates by (1) being at the nest box or in a position from which the box could be viewed when females entered or left their nests, and (2) guarding females from other males as they foraged. Guarding involved flying after and perching with females, waddling a few steps after or alongside females, and chasing away other birds that approached their mates or simply failed to move aside as a pair advanced. Males were at or within viewing distance of their nests on 169 out of 226 occasions (75%) when females entered or emerged from their nest boxes before the end of laying, but on only 76 out of 256 equivalent occasions (30%) afterward. This difference is significant (X2 = 95.62, df = 1, P &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, 17 out of 18 males for which we had monitoring data from before as well as after clutch completion reduced their frequency of monitoring at the nest box following the end of laying (Sign Test, n = 18, x = 1, P &lt; 0.0005). Similarly, males guarded females on 81 out of 86 foraging trips (94%) before clutch completion, but on only 42 out of 73 foraging trips (58%) afterward. This difference is also significant (X2 = 46.56, df = 1, P &lt; 0.0001). Of the 18 males for which we had monitoring data from before and after clutch completion, 12 decreased their guarding frequency after clutch completion, while the other 6 continued the same level of guarding (Sign Test, n = 12, x = 0, P &lt; 0.001). These results corroborate prediction (b). At least two questions are raised by our findings: (1) how do they relate to other bird species? and (2) what costs do male Starlings incur by protecting themselves against cuckoldry? (1) Because both predictions were derived from an hypothesis of cuckoldry risk, and their corroboration supports that hypothesis, Starlings can now be added to the growing list of species in which behaviors reducing cuckoldry risk have been found: Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) (McKinney 1975, McKinney et al. 1978, Hailman 1978); Common Murres (Uria aalge) (Birkhead 1978); Ringed Turtle Doves (Strep- topelia risoria) (Erickson and Zenone 1976, Zenone et al. 1979); Bank Swallows (Riparia riparia) (Hoog- land and Sherman 1976, Beecher and Beecher 1979); Black-billed Magpies (Pica pica) (Birkhead 1979); Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) (Power 1979, 1980; Power and Doner 1980); and Malachite Sunbirds (Nectariniafamosa) (Wolf and Wolf 1976). Corroboration of prediction (a) is particularly interesting, because it demonstrates for the first time in any species that males providing extensive parental care will delay the onset of incubation until after the end of the period of cuckoldry risk. Because both sexes are known or suspected to incubate in at least some species in 118 (70%) of the 168 families of birds found over the globe (Van Tyne and Berger 1959) and in 116 (40%) of the 293 species of passerines found in North America (Verner and Willson 1969), we expect our results for Starlings to be repeated in many other species.</page><page sequence="3">388 Short Communications [Auk, Vol. 98 (2) Male Starlings incur several costs in order to assure their paternity. When males escort their mates rather than performing alternate bouts of incubation with them, they leave their nests unguarded and therefore subject to parasitism, usurpation, and predation. We have no quantitative estimates of the risks of nest usurpation by other Starlings or of predation of eggs, but both usurpation and predation have been recorded in Starling populations (Kluijver 1933, Kessell 1957). We do have a preliminary estimate of the magnitude of nest parasitism. Intraspecific nest parasitism occurs in the form of dumping of eggs by females into the nests of other Starlings. Egg dumping is common in our study population. At 24 nests not included in our natural experiment, we made daily censuses and marked all newly laid eggs in order to detect dumping. We found dumping in 11 (46%) of these 24 nests. Clearly, intraspecific nest parasitism is a serious threat to Starlings. It is not as great a threat to males as cuckoldry, however, because egg dumping merely adds to the burden of parental care without reducing the actual number of offspring a male sires and rears. Only cuckoldry has the potential to divert all of a male's parental care onto young he has not sired. Even cuckoldry involving only one egg in a clutch is genetically more expensive to a male than the addition of a foreign egg to his nest by a dumper, because the price in terms of lost paternity is 1/n for the act of cuckoldry but 1I(n + 1) for the act of dumping (where n = the clutch size of the male's mate).
