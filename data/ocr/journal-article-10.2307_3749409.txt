<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Problem of Dreams Roger Squires i. The scientific study of sleep has recently been stimulated by com- parisons between people and advanced computers, whose normal activities need to be suspended periodically for reprogramming. I quote from a popular account by Dr Christopher Evans, which appeared in the Sunday Times during i969: Sleep is of course the state in which the brain-computer is 'off-line', during which time the vast mass of existing programmes are sorted, outdated ones revised in the light of recent experiences and useless ones or the remnants of modified ones cleared and eliminated. These processes take place for a substantial part of the night, but because the brain is 'off-line' and consciousness suppressed, we are mostly not aware of them. However, if for some reason our sleep is disturbed or when we wake in the morning, as the conscious mind 'comes to' it catches the programme operations at work, and for a moment has no way of knowing whether the events are internal or external in origin. It sets to work therefore to try to make sense of the programme or fragments thereof that are being run through, and the result is what we call a dream- though we should presumably call it an interrupted dream. The first sentence expresses an exciting suggestion about the function of brain activity in sleep. It is comparable to what biologists tell us about other parts of the body; for example, that the liver eliminates waste materials and that the heart pumps blood through the organism. There is no reason to suppose that the liver and the heart need internal or external supervisors. Similarly, Evans does not mean that an unconscious mind is at the controls during sleep, sorting and filing in the same kind of way as a human programmer. This would be self-defeating, since any operator skilled enough to do this would need a memory and intellect comparable to that which these sleeping processes make possible for their owners. The unconscious mind would need to go to sleep during the day shift! Again, when Evans says the conscious mind 'comes to' and catches the programme operations at work he does not suppose that there is an operator in the head of the person waking up, who seeks to make sense of what is happening in there like a scientist trapped in his own computer. Granted, the anthropomorphic descriptions, 'comes to', 'has no way of knowing whether', 'sets to work to make sense', make this primitive way of construing the matter a very natural one. But the amazing complication of the brain should not tempt us back to animistic models properly discarded Philosophy 48 I973 245</page><page sequence="2">Roger Squires by anatomists and physiologists concerned with the function of other parts of the person. It is better to avoid the word 'mind' here, which is itself a product of the old animism. Once again, Evans would not wish his talk of the mind to be interpreted as a reference to the person, who is still asleep. It is not McX or Ann Other who finds the neural machinery still ticking over, tries to use it in the familiar waking way and strives to make sense of the odd results of so doing. People are not equipped to observe their own brains, let alone operate them. They are therefore not puzzled by the results of operating with them inappropriately. Because this kind of suggestion can be ruled out, it is fair to interpret what Evans says as being a functional description, figuratively expressed in personal terms, as if the activities described were intentional. I hope I shall be forgiven for suggesting that this kind of view should be interpreted in something like the following way: Neurophysiological processes occur in sleep with a function analogous to what happens to a computer when it is 'off-line'. For instance, such processes are essential to the efficient use of old information. Sometimes, other brain processes begin which are typical of what happens in the brain when its possessor is awake. The function of these processes is, perhaps, to enable the person to react to his sensory input, to recognise things. When the 'waking' processes operate in sleep before the 'sleeping' processes have concluded in the normal way, this changes the brain in such a way that when the person wakes up he may seem to remember events which did not occur. The invention and testing of such suggestions is, of course, no ambition of mine. My footnote is merely that such theories about neurophysiological mechanisms would not, if established, support popular assumptions about waking impressions. The cerebral processes typical of Rapid Eye Move- ment phase sleep are not what we (men in the street) call 'dreaming'. We are equally unaware of the cerebral process which inappropriately switches on when our sleep is disturbed. So we (the men in the street) would not call this an 'interrupted dream'. It may well be true, on the other hand, that such interruptions explain or cause what we commonly call 'remembering a dream'. But this neurophysiology by no means shows that what we thus refer to as a dream occurs in the night, or at all. It does not show that our waking impressions are memories but rather the opposite. Metaphorical language about the working of the brain, especially when it says that the mind knows this or does that, encourages the animistic thought that the brain needs a controller. Since it works at night, it is easy to suppose that the controller is still a person, wearing a different nightcap (the same mind, only subconscious); that the sleeping person 246</page><page sequence="3">The Problem of Dreams (or his mind) is nevertheless alive to what is happening to him. This fits the traditional assumption that waking impressions are memories of what happened in sleep. But remove the metaphors, the mind, the awareness in sleep, and this pseudo-scientific support from popular accounts of neuro- physiological mechanisms evaporates. This is not a criticism of scientific suggestions such as those advanced by Evans. It is a caveat about how they are described and interpreted. That they do not support what I shall claim to be mistaken popular assumptions in no way diminishes, and may increase, their interest and importance. 2. It is almost universally believed that dreams occur during sleep and that people are capable of recalling them when they wake up. In his excellent book Dreaming (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1959), Norman Malcolm, following some hints of Wittgenstein, bravely rejects this popular view as senseless. He thinks that our ordinary use of the word 'dream' is perfectly in order and therefore cannot be based on any such view. I agree with the criticisms of this position expressed by Hilary Putnam in 'Dreaming and Depth Grammar' (Analytical Philosophy, ist series, ed. R. J. Butler, i962). The popular view is not nonsense and is integral to the meaning of 'dreaming'. Unlike Putnam, however, I shall argue that we are not aware of the interesting things that happen to us while asleep and that, though we often appear to recall strange events after waking up, we in fact remember nothing of what has happened to us in sleep. Ordinary talk of dreams may not be in order. The uncompromising version of my claim would be that people simply don't dream. But we could insist that dreams are simply what people appear to recall in the morning. My claim would then be that dreams do not occur in the night and that there are no 'unremembered' dreams. Alternatively, we could insist that dreaming is the sleeping activity which is responsible for a person's waking impressions. My claim would then be that a person is unaware of his dreams. Our use of the word 'dream' may depend on how we resolve the issue of whether we are contemporaneously aware of what happens to us in sleep, so in discussing it we should probably tread softly on dreams. It is tempting to argue, as Malcolm does, that there is an inconsistency in claiming both that someone is asleep and that he is alive to what is going on. If waking impressions were memories, would we not have to cancel the claim that a person had been asleep? This short way seems too short. Perhaps it is part of the meaning of being asleep that the sleeper should not recognize things in his everyday environment. It is harder to maintain that he cannot be aware of anything, even in special ways. Again, perhaps someone cannot be said both to act in certain ways and be asleep. It is harder to maintain that he cannot act at all, perhaps by making internal movements of which we are presently ignorant. Such things should not be ruled out before investigation. 247</page><page sequence="4">Roger Squires It is my contention that they should be ruled out after investigation. The rejection does not, I hope, depend on any special 'theory' about meaning, evidence or criteria. There just don't seem to be good reasons for treating waking impressions as memories. The arguments against this depend on what is urged in its favour. 3. The ability to relate strange adventures when awakened has been correlated with characteristic Rapid Eye Movement phases of sleep. In such REM phases, heart rate, breathing and blood pressure are irregular and brain waves show a distinctive pattern. What appears certain is that something happens in sleep which determines the occurrence and possibly the nature of a person's waking impressions. But it is a long stride from this to the conclusion that a person is even dimly aware of what is happen- ing in sleep and that he awakes with confused impressions of what was happening. Admittedly the occurrence of eye movements in sleep would suggest in isolation that the sleeper is watching something. But there is good reason to think that he isn't, in that nothing is moving about in front of him and his eyes are closed. Scenes painted inside his eyelids would be too close to be visible. Possibly he is watching something with another sense, an inner eye. But why should movements of his 'outer' eye be evidence that he is watching something with a totally different sense? When rhesus moneys were trained to respond only to images on a screen by pressing a bar they also made this movement during REM sleep. This was widely taken to confirm the hypothesis that dormant monkeys see images which they cannot distinguish from screen images. Yet we know there is no ordinary screen or image. And the monkeys are not usually fooled by something very different. Moreover, they have their eyes shut. No doubt it is possible that one day brain surgeons should unearth minute objects or physiologists exhibit phenomena in the brain which are detected by an inner-directed scanning mechanism and which are to the observer indistinguishable from things detected by the eyes in daytime. But it seems to me that superficial similarities between sleeping and waking behaviour are totally insufficient to support such speculative hypotheses. Indeed, insofar as neurophysiological studies have revealed no inner screen or inner eye it may be reasonable to suppose them disconfirmed in the same way as one disproves the thought that a dormant bar-pressing monkey is responding to a screen in his cage. 4. It is sometimes said that the observation of what happens in sleep confirms the evidence of waking impressions. What sort of evidence is this? If McX is under the impression that he saw a dragon, this is a reason for thinking that he did. There are no dragons. So it is perhaps a reason for thinking that he saw something like a dragon, such as a bulldozer or a statue. If McX has been dozing, not bulldozing, this can also be ruled out. 248</page><page sequence="5">The Problem of Dreams McX had his eyes closed. Perhaps his inner eyes were open. But how can his false impression that he observed one type of event in the ordinary way be evidence that he witnessed another type of event in a totally different way? It is a matter of experience that people sometimes mistake bulldozers for animals. It is not a matter of experience that people mistake internal objects for animals. It may be replied that someone who wakes up under the impression that he has been fighting dragons does not usually believe that any ordinary events occurred in his sleep. His impression is of special status events scanned in an unusual way. If his memory is usually reliable, why can't we accept these impressions as the best kind of evidence for special status events? It is doubtful if this reply is adequate because the awakened sleeper's reasons for putting his claims in terms of special status events are of a negative kind. He knows there are no dragons and that he is prone to have false impressions after sleeping. In short, it appears that he has no more reason than the rest of us for taking his impressions of not-seen non-dragons as recollections of the denizens of his skull as revealed by a mysterious mode of consciousness. The attraction of the inner event account is that it offers an explanation of our waking impressions as recollections of our night life. The alternative, it may seem, is to leave our impressions unexplained. But unless there is independent confirmation of the framework in which an explanation operates, it is an intellectual encumbrance. Consider these inner events or images, postulated to explain waking impressions. Are they 'trained to spend their nights in dancing'? Can we happily leave it to neurophysiolo- gists (who, so far as I know, have not stumbled upon such things in their researches) to explain the nature of these internal things and the manner in which we perceive them? Perhaps we should leave researchers to explain our waking impressions, dropping the nocturnal intermediaries. Perhaps we should resist the temptation to explain and admit that the usual infer- ences from a person's being under a certain impression break down in those special cases where he has just been asleep. 5. It is well known that there is a connexion between some things which happen to the sleeper and his apparent memories upon awakening. Suppose the room is very hot, his alarm-clock goes off without waking him up and someone sprinkles water on his face. When he finally wakes up he may be under the impression that during a hot spell the house caught fire, that fire-engines with bells ringing raced to the scene, and that they fought the fire with water hoses. It is tempting to suppose that the sleeper's apparent memories of fire bells and hoses are genuine memories of his alarm-clock and the water on his face. If some of his apparent recollections are genuine recollections of what happened to him in sleep, is there not some reason for thinking that all his impressions are impressions of what happened in sleep, though this may be hidden to other observers? 249</page><page sequence="6">Roger Squires But does the sleeper remember the alarm-clock ringing? Compare a waking incident. Someone working in his office sees a dark cloud issue from a distant building and later hears a bell ringing. Arrived home, he announces that there has been a fire but the fire engines were soon at the scene. Now suppose that the 'smoke' was a cloud of locusts and the 'fire bells' were produced by someone ringing a handbell. Though the office worker does not remember fires and fire engines he obviously remembers something, the dark cloud and the bell ringing. By virtue of the facts that the dark cloud was a swarm of locusts and the bell was a handbell, we could also say that he remembers the locusts and the handbell. Can we find a corresponding something which the awakened sleeper, with his false impressions of fire engines, undoubtedly remembers? When he wakes up he does not know, nor is he under the impression, that his room was hot, that the alarm went off and so forth. He does not even seem to remember these things. Perhaps, though, he at least heard a ringing noise, which he mistook for a fire engine, but which was in fact the alarm- clock. Certainly if you ask him he will say hle is under the impression that he heard a ringing noise. But we need to establish that it was the same ringing noise as that made by the alarm-clock. Se we ask him to identify the noise. He says 'Oh, the one made by the fire engine'. That won't do, so we ask him when and where the noise was. 'It came from the street,' he replies, 'a few minutes after the fire.' This won't do either, because lhe is only identifying it within an admittedly false story. If he has no independent way of picking out the noise, and he does not appear to have, then there is no way to establish whether 'it' was or was not identical with the noise made by the clock. It is no escape that the person himself may wake up to find the alarm ringing or notice that it must have been ringing in his sleep. Now he can identify a noise alright, that made by the clock. But he is unable to identify it as the noise he seemed to have heard in sleep, for the same reason that outsiders could not make this identification. There is no evidence that the sleeper, assailed by fire, air and water, identified anything in the way that the office worker identified the dark cloud and the bell. This is a reason for denying that he was aware of what happened to him in sleep or that he remembers what happened to him or that his waking impressions are impressions of those events. 6. 'Surely it is not a coincidence that a person's waking impressions are of rain or fire hoses after water has been sprinkled on him in sleep. He simply must be remembering what happened. He probably felt the water on his face and misinterpreted it.' It is not in question that there is a connexion between sleeping events and waking impressions. The sprinkled water has an effect on the sleeper which may make a difference to his later impressions and actions. The physiological explanation of how the water 'registers' may well be analogous to what happens when someone 250</page><page sequence="7">The Problem of Dreams feels water on his face. If this is what is meant by saying that the sleeper must have been aware of what happened, there is no need to disagree. Environmental influence in sleep is partly similar to the phenomenon of 'subliminal advertising'. By flashing images on the screen during a film, for instance, it is apparently possible to shape the later actions of the audience, even though the images passed so quickly that the audience was not aware of them either at the time or in retrospect. While admitting that this is a correct description, one is nevertheless inclined to say, 'It couldn't be a coincidence that they all bought Snibbo later. They must have been aware of the images after all, and been persuaded by them.' Probably the phrase 'subconsciously aware' would be used here. It is also the natural way of describing the sleeper, that he is subconsciously aware of water on his face and subconsciously misinterprets it as a fire hose. The claim that the audience must have seen the images (though it didn't) or that the sleeper must have been aware of the water on his face (though he wasn't) can be taken in two ways. It may mean that the images and the water affected their victims by a similar mechanism to that which would have operated had they actually seen the images or felt the water. This vague physiological claim is very likely true. On the other hand it may mean that, despite appearances, the members of the audience did see the images, that the sleeper actually identified the water on his face. This seems to be false. 7. The point may still be pressed that there is a sense in which the sleeper subconsciously remembers some of the things which happened to him in sleep. Is this not a reason for thinking that his other apparent memories are genuine, if subconscious, recollections of other things which occurred in sleep? It may soon be possible to account for waking impressions in detail by reference to neural activity during REM phases. We may be able to produce apparent memories upon awakening by stimulating the sleeper's brain. Surely this would confirm the view that our waking impressions are subconscious memories of brain activity, which we were subconsciously aware of in the night? I shall argue that this would be an illegitimate extension of subconscious memory. What makes it attractive to describe the sleeper as subconsciously aware of the water on his face is not just the causal connexion between this occurrence and his later reports. A wet face is something we are usually aware of and, if we had restricted information, it would be understandable if we attributed it to rain or even fire-hoses. This suggests that it is by virtue of the physiological machinery which equips us to feel water when awake that the water can have effects on us in sleep and also that it is because of our proneness to interpret and misinterpret what we feel that the water makes a difference to our later impressions. These vague claims may be expressed by saying that the sleeper subconsciously misinterprets or misremembers the water which fell on him. 251</page><page sequence="8">Roger Squires We are not usually aware of brain activity, however. It is not identified by the way it looks and feels, as water often is. No one knows what neural processes look, sound or feel like. Therefore, if it is found that whenever certain neural processes are initiated in someone's brain he wakes up and tells a story of dragons, there is still no reason to claim that he subconsciously misinterprets the neural process. For there is no way to tell whether it is understandable to mistake a neural process for a dragon or anything else. Since we do not know what it would be like for a person to be aware of his brain activity (except with the aid of elaborate equipment), a mere causal connection between that activity and some later propensities of the person concerned is an insufficient reason for talking of subconscious perception, awareness, misinterpretation or remembering. 8. If we reject the view that someone asleep monitors special status events or engages in internal adventures an attractive alternative beckons. This is that the sleeper at least thinks that he sees and does things. He suffers total hallucination or delusion. For example, he may suppose that tigers are after him or be under the impression that he is slaying a dragon. On this view, he is completely mistaken about the existence of what he imagines and about the nature of his own actions. So we are apparently freed from the search for miniature dragons, inner scanners, or even appropriate sleeping actions. I think the idea of a total hallucination or delusion is self-defeating. To attribute a false belief or mistaken impression to someone is to interpret something he did or would have done. It is not just to say that he did, or would have done, certain actions, but to explain those actions as appropriate to some non-existent state of affairs. The content of a false belief, what is falsely supposed, is a description of that situation which, if it obtained, would have rendered intelligible the person's actions or dispositions (including, of course, what he said or would have said). For example, suppose Macbeth's eyes focus in mid-air, he mutters something about a dagger and gropes forward with his hand. Nothing in the hall explains these mysterious things. But if there were a dagger in the air, their pattern would be immediately obvious. The content of his belief is what would make these actions intelligible, namely, the existence of a dagger in front of him. By virtue of the fact that there is no dagger before him, his belief is a mistaken one. Now if a person is to be totally mistaken, it cannot be true of him that he performs a successful action. For this would imply that he is not mistaken about something, that he knows what he is doing, if only in a limited way. Equally, it can hardly be true of him that he would act in certain ways, for this would imply a capacity for successful action, which would involve some correct, if inoperative, beliefs on his part. (It may be true of him that he would act in certain ways if he were not deluded, but this capability is explicitly not what the attribution of delusion is intended 252</page><page sequence="9">The Problem of Dreams to explain.) I conclude that if there is anything (some action or disposition) for the attribution of false belief to explain, the hallucination or delusion cannot be total. Where the capacity for action is lacking, the apparatus of delusion or hallucination gets no grip. A promising objection to the above argument runs as follows. To attribute beliefs to a person all that is needed is that he should try to perform actions, not that he should succeed. Not even successful limb- movements need to be carried out, for the person may be paralysed. It seems to me, however, that the attempt, no less than the deed, confounds the attribution of total illusion. The paralysed man who tries to move his arm, for example, believes he can move it, he wants to move it and would if he could. We can hardly ascribe these beliefs and intentions as an explanation of, or on the basis of, his 'pure tryings', since if we are justified in attributing attempts to him at all it thereby follows that he has already certain beliefs and intentions. So we come back to the point that the subject of such claims must be capable of action and not totally mistaken. If we cannot ultimately settle on something a person did or would have done there can be no grounds for attributing a mistake or false impression to him. Consider, again, the hallucinated Macbeth. He is not aware of a dagger or of something like a dagger or of a picture of a dagger, since there is no such thing. Nor is he aware of the activity of his heat-oppressed brain which is doubtless causing his confusion. But he is aware, on the other hand, that he is in the hall of his palace, that he intends to murder Duncan and that he is groping about in the air. On the basis of such correct beliefs we can attribute mistakes to him. Now if he were 'totally hallucinated', we should presumably have to replace all his correct beliefs. It seems to me that he would not then be aware of anything, though his cerebral activity may be at a peak. If the brain activity plays havoc with his later reports, this is an insufficient reason for saying that he was deluded or mistaken at the time of its occurrence. (If he had been capable of false claims at the time of course he could not have been 'totally hallucinated'.) 9. Those who talk of sleeping hallucinations, delusions, mistakes, misinterpretations or false impressions, tacitly assume that a person is capable of acting in sleep. It is well known that elaborate activity does occur in sleep, but it appears that it is not remembered. 'The sleep-walkers appeared to be aware of their environment but indifferent to it. Their eyes were open, expressions blank, and movements somewhat rigid .. . if spoken to, the subjects answered monosyllabically as if annoyed... There was complete amnesia for the incidents when they awakened.' (Jacobson, Kales, Lehmann, Zweizig in Scientific American, July i965.) Such activity does not occur in REM phrases, but in 'deep' sleep when the brain is apparently least active. Since there is no connexion with waking impressions, I shall not discuss whether these 'automatic pilot' i8 253</page><page sequence="10">Roger Squires activities, such as sleep-walking and sleep-talking, are properly described as deliberate acts, expressing their executor's awareness or mis- apprehensions. The minimal limb-movements, erratic eye-switching and related phenomena that occur in those phases of sleep during or after which the interrupted sleeper is most liable to 'tell a dream' do not even appear to be actions of the sleeper. Though slightly similar to things which would be appropriate to certain familiar situations, they are much more obviously dissimilar. For example, eye movements are appropriate when a person is looking for something, but not when he has his eyes closed. If it is said that the sleeper does not know his eyes are closed, this makes it difficult to maintain that he does know his eyes are moving, presumably a pre- requisite for regarding these movements as under his control, as exhibitions of his aims and mistaken assumptions. Similarly, suppose Kipper's leg jerked. The suggestion is that Kipper jerked his leg. Why should he do that, rocking peacefully in his hammock? 'Perhaps he thinks he is playing football.' Why doesn't he do all the other things pertinent to playing football? 'Perhaps most of his other impulses are inhibited by sleep.' Then Kipper must get very frustrated, though he doesn't show it! 'Perhaps he does not know he is "switched off", does not realize that he is not playing football.' Do you still wish to maintain that he does realize that his leg jerked? It is possible that such things should turn out to be actions. My point is that such evidence as we have renders the possibility remote. io. There is a world of difference between seeming to remember that a tiger chased you and remembering that a tiger seemed to chase you or recalling that it seemed as if a tiger was chasing you. The hallucination or delusion view of dreams is that a person remembers things that seemed to happen. Evidence is needed, over and above the waking impressions themselves, to establish that he does not merely seem to recall nocturnal adventures. Consider some undoubted instances of recalling a mistaken impression. Suppose McX walks into a mirror under the impression that it is a doorway between two rooms. His action is explicable by reference to a state of affairs which does not obtain. He may remember the whole incident, including stepping forward and smashing the glass. As a result of the impact, however, he may only recollect walking towards the mirror when told to circulate or being surprised that there were so many guests at the party, or saying to himself, 'I'll go through that door into the other room.' He remembers being under a false impression even in these cases because he recalls doing something which was, whether he knows it or not, to be explained as appropriate to an imagined situation. This is a sufficient qualification for the description, 'recalls being under the mistaken im- pression', though not a necessary one. McX may only remember things 254</page><page sequence="11">The Problem of Dreams he would have done. For instance, he may remember that he would have pointed to the mirror if asked for the way out. Provided the explanation of what he would have done lies in specifying the imagined situation, he still remembers being under the false impression. But if he does not recollect what he did, or would have done, at the party, he does not recall being under any impression. The question is whether someone who has been asleep remembers anything he did or would have done while asleep. He does not remember the neurophysiological activities that occur when he is awake. There is no reason to suppose he remembers them after he has been asleep. He does not know how to jiggle his brain cells or fire his nerves. He does not remember that his oculomotor system was periodically innervated, that his pulse rate soared or that his breathing was irregular, any more than that his brain waves roared and his basic skin resistance increased. Does he remember anything he would have done in sleep? Suppose Pewter has the impression that a tiger chased him. If he had had that impression in the night presumably he would have jumped out of bed, locked the door and telephoned the police. But he does not recall that he would have done this, because his impression was of being, not in the bedroom but in the jungle, when such actions would have been inappropriate. Nor does he remember what he would have done if he had not been asleep. For he does not remember being asleep. I see no reason to suppose that he knows what he would have done while still asleep. i I. It may be thought that the sleeper remembers trying to do things in sleep. If a person was completely tied up or paralysed, that the appropriate nerves fired when he was asked to move his arm would be excellent evidence that he tried to move it. Now motor impulses are similarly cut off in sleep. Yet we may find that those nerves fire which would have produced limb-movements. Does this not show that attempts are made to move? It may be suggested that it is this trying which is later misreported as, for example, 'running away from a tiger'. I shall argue that even if the neurophysiological evidence were thus favourable it would be insufficient to warrant this conclusion. If someone remembers doing something it does not follow that he remembers how he did it. He may remember winning a game of chess, for example, without remembering anything he did in order to win. Similarly, if someone falsely but sincerely claims to remember doing something, it does not follow that he remembers trying to do that thing, even if it is an undisputed fact that he did try to do it. Suppose Jennings attempts an anagram one morning by eating fish for breakfast and gazing into a crystal ball, intoning the letters one by one. He fails. That afternoon he claims to remember, or is inclined to think he remembers, having solved the anagram in the morning. It by no means follows that he at least remembers trying to solve it, even though he 255</page><page sequence="12">Roger Squires obviously did try to solve it. When we ask him further questions, we may find that he has no recollection of any steps he took or even of any steps he contemplated or would have taken. If this is so, we should deny that he recalls trying to solve the anagram. Is the case not like this for waking reports? People appear to remember doing various things, not attempting to do them. When they do appear to remember trying to do something, what they appear to recall bears no resemblance to the recondite neurophysiological phenomena which might tempt a researcher to suppose that the sleeper is trying to make bodily movements. A person may tell that he tried to escape from a tiger by running or climbing a tree. No one appears to recall that he fired his nerves or what he would have done if his motor impulses had not been cut off. Even if he did try to do such things in sleep, there would be no reason to suppose that he remembered or misremembered this after he woke up. Our imaginary researcher has the idea that the sleeper does what he can to act out his later narratives, but that all that happens is that his nerves fire, the usual sequel being blocked by some physiological barrier. On the face of it, this is no better than the idea that he was able to keep still all night only with an effort, since he would have run amok if he had not cut off his motor impulses! Of course, it is assumed that the nerve- firing is under control, but not the blocking mechanism. Evidence is needed for this question-begging approach. In particular, that the person is wholly oblivious to the failure of his spectacularly abortive 'attempts' makes it doubtful whether they were attempts at all. The analogy with someone who cannot move because he is tied up is misleading. The bound person is thwarted and knows it. We, and he, know that he would move if he could for all kinds of reasons. And he would know whether or not he had succeeded in achieving these further ends. Pewter asleep does not realize his limbs won't move. If they did move, there is no reason to suppose that he would have succeeded in anything or even know that they had moved (unless he woke up). There are no grounds for ascribing aims or purposes to Pewter. Does he want to shoot a tiger? One needs to be awake to shoot at tigers. But if we try to help him by waking him up he is much more likely to shoot at us. The upshot is that the sleeper does not remember what happened to him in sleep. He may be told what happened or surmise it from his general knowledge of such cases. But this cannot make legal tender of his counter- feit waking impressions. These would only be evidence for actions, or propensities to act, in sleep if they could be correlated with them. But there seem to be no independent reasons for holding that people can do things during REM phases. Therefore, there are no good reasons for holding that they think things then, that they suffer delusions, have hallucinations or fall under false impressions. i2. 'Surely it is no coincidence that Pewter became restless in sleep and 256</page><page sequence="13">The Problem of Dreams burbled about tigers, that perspiration broke out on his brow in the last REM phase before he woke up and seemed to remember being chased by a tiger. He must have been reacting at the time to what he recalled later.' We need to distinguish the traditional belief that apparent memories after sleep are genuine memories, from scientific hypotheses which are prompted by the similarity between our state when we remember and when we merely seem to remember. Probably the cerebral states of the persons recalling and apparently recalling are in some respects the same. In view of the correlation between REM phases and apparent memories, it seems likely that the parts, features or aspects of the brain which are involved in ordinary remembering are also affected in some way during the REM phase. Probably the sleeping processes which produce these cerebral changes also produce the externally obvious sleeping reactions, such as those ascribed to Pewter. If such a scientific story were confirmed, the correlation between some sleeping reactions and waking impressions would not, of course, be coincidental. Suppose that, as a by-product of some cerebral function in sleep, electro-chemical changes occur which are very like those that normally enable us to remember what has been going on. There may be associated reactions. For example, if someone sees another aim a blow at him, no doubt his brain registers vital changes which enable him to duck away or parry it. If similar brain changes occurred in sleep there could be a related effect. It may be that the reaction of the person who is awake is something he learned, something under his control. Then his corresponding sleeping reaction would be what it is because of the person's deliberate waking reactions. This would provide a ground for talking of the sleeper's sub- conscious reactions, of his acting in sleep as if he were awake. For similar physiological reasons, we saw that it may be tempting to say that sleepers sometimes subconsciously perceive such things as water on their faces. Because workers in the field and their interpreters take it for granted that waking impressions are genuine memories, they may present physio- logical accounts of the genesis and mechanism of apparent memories as if they were evidence for the traditional view. 'We have shown that it is no coincidence that Peter blanched and cried "Wolf" in sleep,' they proclaim correctly. But then it is tempting to conclude, incorrectly, that his later story of wolves was a memory after all. I 3. Here is a similar example where the results of scientific investigation have probably been misrepresented. The events of a fairy tale occur when the story says they occur and not at all. You can either say the ghost appeared to Hamlet in the early morning or that the events related never happened. The same is true of the tales people tell after sleeping. If these are not recollections, it is silly to press the question when the events really occurred. On the other hand, this would be sensible if the popular accounts were correct. Therefore, the discovery that if someone wakes up during or 257</page><page sequence="14">Roger Squires after an REM phase he may have quasi-memories, but that before an REM phase he never will, is widely taken to show when the apparently remembered events occurred. Macbeth appears to see a dagger three feet in front of him when there is no dagger, or anything like a dagger, in that position. Where is the dagger Macbeth thinks he sees? That it appears to him to be three feet away is the only sensible kind of answer. Now suppose we discover that when a shield is put between Macbeth and where he places the dagger, he no longer appears to see a dagger. This does not establish that the imagined dagger is really somewhere beyond the shield, that it now has a real as well as an apparent position or that its apparent position has been con- firmed! It shows something about the conditions under which Macbeth has the hallucination. The spatial position of the apparently seen dagger is analogous to the temporal position of apparently remembered events. The causal evidence about REM phases no more confers a time upon the supposed events than the (postulated) causal evidence would confer a place upon the hallucinated dagger. The correlation with REM phases helps to establish some conditions under which a person will seem to remember taking part in strange adventures. I4. It is often said that what we remember upon awakening are 'experi- ences' which occurred in sleep. The first difficulty is that, in normal usage, someone who recalls the experience of running away from a lion is someone who ran away from a lion. So it is sometimes said that what occurs in sleep is an experience exactly like being chased by a lion except that there was no animal involved and the sleeper did not run away. As if the experi- ence can be described without saying anything at all about what actually happened. The trouble is that it is not obvious that anything has been described. Something occurs, which is exactly like being chased by a lion, except that ... it is nothing like it? And I have something in my pocket which is just like a florin except that it's nothing like a British silvery coin twice the value of a shilling! (This rejection is dogmatic, but I cannot at present find an interpretation of the technical word 'experience' which makes it plausible to say that a person's waking impressions are recollections of his experiences.) If to describe an experience is to say nothing about what there is 'out there', but to talk of internal film shows, experiences should be rejected for the excellent reason that nothing like that goes on in the head. If to describe an experience is to describe what goes on in the head, only some scientists are partially qualified to describe them. If to describe an experi- ence is to say what someone thinks or supposes rather than what he did, we have seen that there is no reason to suppose that a person has experiences in sleep or that people commonly even seem to remember experiences. Unfortunately, the protean word 'experience' enables some accounts to 258</page><page sequence="15">The Problem of Dreams be stated in elusive ways. For example, experiences are said to be like moving pictures in that they are regularly mistaken for tigers and lions: yet they are not in the head or outside it. They are observed with an inner eye: yet they are nowhere to be seen. Even the inner eye is often said to be the eye of the mind, rather than of the person. It seems to me that such riders deserve disqualification from the scientific stakes. Just as the addition that souls are insubstantial renders safe but useless the claim that they wander in sleep, so the appeal to experiences which are non-spatial and apprehended by a mental eye gains immunity from disconfirmation at the expense of its explanatory force. I5. But in the dark hours of the morning, when the perfumes of the night are in one's nostrils or the flesh creeps at the thought of terrors past, how absurd it seems to deny that something is remembered! It is the magic of this primitive certainty that sustains the scotched myths; not laboratory evidence, reflection on unusual occurrences or even grammatical illusions. In the cold light of day, perhaps we should also wake up to the fact that this spell-binding certainty only shows what it shows: that we sometimes wake up with apparent memories. But can the rest be dogmatism about slumber? Have we been dreaming? University of St Andrews 259</page></plain_text>
