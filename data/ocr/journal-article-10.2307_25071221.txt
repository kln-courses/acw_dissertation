<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stealing a kiss at the golden section: pacing and proportion in the Act I love duet of la Boh?me* Allan W. Atlas The City University of New York One of the things that has long struck me about the love duet at the conclusion of Act I of Puccini's La boh?me (beginning at rehearsal number [RH] 41, with Rodolfo's "O soave fanciulla")1 is that the proportional relationships of the individual parts of the duetto the duet as a whole, as well as those within the individual parts themselves, seem "just right," that Puccini had an unerring sense of musical-dramatic pacing, and that he knew just when enough was enough and just when, therefore, to change gears. What follows tries to offer one explanation?and there are undoubtedly others (as many as there are listeners?)?for this intuitive feeling. As both the score (in Appendix I) and Table I should make clear, I hear the duet as a four-part structure: Table I. The four-part structure of the love duet, La boh?me, Act I; location is expressed (as it is throughout the article) in terms of RH number, measure within the RH number (after the diagonal slash, and including the first measure therein), and beat within measure (after the colon and meas ured in quarter notes); Qs = number of quarter notes in the part; M = Mimi, R = Rodolfo. Part Location Qs Comments I RH 41/1:1 -RH 42/1:4 66 lyrical; firmly in A major (with a hint of movement to the domi nant); R begins alone, then alternates and sings together with M; the last four Qs (63-66) overlap with first four of Part II RH 42/1:1 -RH 43/1:1 29 declamatory; primarily chromatic and unstable, but eventually moves toV/V of C major; M and R sing in alternation only; the last four Qs (26-29 = 88-91 of duet as a whole) overlap with first four of Part III * Earlier versions of this paper were read in Spring 2003 at both the Music Forum of the Ph.D. Program in Music at The Graduate Center, The City University of New York, and, at the kind invitation of Prof. Susan Weiss, the Musicology Colloquium, The Peabody Institute, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. My thanks to Mr. Lawrence Shuster, a doctoral candidate at the CUNY Graduate Center for his steady help. I Although the duet serves as the concluding a due of the large-scale scena for Mimi and Rodolfo that begins at RH 25 with Rodolfo 's "Non sono in vena," it can stand on its own as a self-sufficient struc tural-aesthetic entity (or "closed number"); on the structure of the scena, see Mich?le Girardi, Puccini: His International Art, tr. Laura Basini, Chicago, 2000, pp. 124-25.</page><page sequence="2">270 Allan W.Atlas Part Location Qs Comments RH 42/7:2 - RH 43/7:3 30 declamatory, but anchored on a dominant pedal that prepares C major; M and R continue to sing in alternation IV RH 43/7:4-to end of Act I 57 becomes lyrical; firmly in C major; M and R begin by alternating, but conclude together My analysis of the structure warrants three comments. First, it is possible to hear the duet as a tripartite structure in which my Parts II and III constitute a single, relatively homoge neous?though more so musically than dramatically?central panel, since not only is the articulation between Parts II and III the one that is least clearly defined, but the double bar that appears in the published score at RH 43/1 is lacking in the autograph manuscript2 Second, Parts I and II, on the one hand, and II and III, on the other, overlap, as at least one musical element of the previous section continues while one or another changes. Thus while the A-major chord at RH 42/1 brings tonal closure to Part I, it functions simultaneously as the springboard for the chromaticism that characterizes the first half of Part II. Likewise, though I initially hear the four beats at which Mimi sings "Se venissi con voi" (RH 42/7:2 - RH 43/1:1) as the end of Part II, I quickly reinterpret them as an upbeat to Part III. Thus the sum of the four individual parts in terms of their length as measured in quarter notes (66 + 29 + 30 + 57 = 182) is greater than that of the duet as a whole (= 174). Finally, the four parts that I initially discern on musical grounds alone (lyrical vs. declama tory melodic style, tonal-harmonic stability vs. instability, full vs. thin texture, etc.) coincide nicely with?and are surely driven by?the shifting dramatic situation on stage: the lush lyricism and tonal stability of Part I underscore Rodolfo and Mimi's mutual professions of love; the chromatic instability and declamatory nature of Part II reflect Mimi's momentary uncertainty about the relationship; while the dominant pedal on G (already prepared by the V/V at RH 42/6), which is sustained throughout almost all of Part III and takes aim at the tonal stability to come, seems to settle Mimi down and draw her back to Rodolfo; finally, the lyricism and stable C major of Part IV provide a cozy cushion for the lovers' reconciliation, even if, as more than one critic has noted, the C major lacks the weight of a true, end-of-act tonal closure.3 2 The autograph is housed at the Archivio Storico Ricordi, Milan; I am grateful to Casa Ricordi for per mitting me to study this and other Puccini autographs in 1991. Also absent in the autograph are the double bars that enclose the short, 2/4 measure at RH 41/16, the second of which marks the hinge-like articulation between Parts I and II. 3 On this point and for harmonic-tonal analyses of the duet, see William Drabkin, "The Musical Language of La boh?me," Giacomo Puccini: La boh?me (Cambridge Opera Handbooks), ed.

I suggest that it is, in part, an underlying network of two interlocking proportions: the golden section, on the one hand, and bilateral symmetry (defined by a central axis), on the other, and that these proportions work individually and, at the same time, tug gently against one another to create a sense of dynamic tension, structural ambiguity, and, ultimately, aesthetic satis faction. And since the properties of the golden section may not be part of everyone's work-a-day vocabulary, a little background about the proportion is in order. II Though seemingly known to the Pythagoreans in the fifth century B.C., who would have hit upon it through their interest in pentagrams and pentagons,4 the golden section was first described unequivocally by Euclid in Book VI, proposition 30, of his Elements (c. 300 B.C.), where he called it the "extreme and mean ratio." And though it seemed to accrue mystical attributes early on, it was only centuries (almost two millennia) later, that the likes of Luca Pacioli (De divina proportione, 1509?with illustrations by Leon ardo da Vinci) and Johannes Kepler (in a number of writings dating from 1608 to 1621), invested its properties with a sense of the "divine" and clothed the proportion in an aura of Christian mysticism.5 Briefly, the golden section divides a given length into two unequal segments in such a way that the ratio of the longer segment to the shorter segment equals that of the whole to the longer segment. As such the ratio is unique. And for practical purposes, we can determine the golden section of a given length by multiplying it (the length) by 0.618.6 Figure I provides a visual ?mage of the golden section, and shows that either the longer or shorter segment can come first as, arbitrarily, we move from left to right:7 Exposition and Musical Structure in Puccini's Operas," Ph.D. diss., The City University of New York, 1991, pp. 246-50, 289-98, who hears C major as a point of temporary closure in a large-scale tonal arc of B flat (beginning of Act I)?C (end of Act I)?F (beginning of Act II)?B flat (end of Act II) that spans the whole of what was originally conceived as a single, uninterrupted act. 4 See, among others, Mario Livio, The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number, New York, 2002, pp. 34-36. 5 The relevant excerpts from Euclid, Pacioli, and Kepler appear conveniently in Roger Herz-Fischler, A Mathematical History of the Golden Number, Mine?la, NY, 1998 (originally published as A Mathematical History of Division in Extreme and Mean Ratio, Waterloo, Ontario, 1987), pp. 12, 14, 171-75. The earliest use of the term "golden section" (at least in print) seems to date from 1835 (as "goldener Schnitt" in Martin Ohm's Die reine Elementar-Mathematik); its first appearance in English may be in an entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th ed., 1875; see D.H. Fowler, "A Generalization of the Golden Section," Fibonacci Quarterly, 20 (1982), 146. 6 Though the golden section is an "irrational number" with decimal places that continue ad infinitum, three decimal places (.618) are generally sufficient, with the product then being rounded off to the closest whole number if it is convenient to do so.</page><page sequence="4">272 Allan.

The golden section also has some "spin-offs," among them: (I) the so-called Golden Rectangle, in which the ratio of long and short perpendicular sides define the golden section, and (2) the logarithmic (or equiangular) spiral, which derives the curvature of its arc from a series of expanding golden sections and retains its shape as it expands into infinity. Finally, though the value of the golden section is irrational (see note 6), it has a close whole-number relative in the so-called "Fibonacci" series, especially as that sequence moves into its higher terms, each of which (from the beginning) is the sum of the two terms that precede it: (0) I 12 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233....9 7 Figure I actually displays three "levels" of relationships: AGCB (two units) is a ratio (the golden ratio); AG.CB = AB:AC (three units) is a proportion (and the true golden section as defined by Euclid); the single point C (or D) is a mean (the golden mean). I have however, used the term "golden section" even when referring only to a single point 8 On the terms "short" and "long," see note 17. 9 The series is named after Leonardo Fibonacci (figlio di Bonacci) of Pisa (c. 1170-1240), the mathemati cian who introduced the use of Indian-Arabic numerals to Europe. The literature on both the golden section and the Fibonacci series is enormous. I have found the following particularly useful: Livio (with an extensive bibliography); Herz-Fischler; Richard Padovan, Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture, London, 1991; H.E. Huntley, The Divine Proportion: A Study in Mathematical Beauty, Mine?la, NY, 1969; and, for the mathematically "challenged" (like myself), Joseph and Frances Gies, Leonard of Pisa and the New Mathematics of the Middle Ages, New York, 1969 (which my local public library catalogues under "Y" = "young adult"). For comprehensive discussions in the</page><page sequence="5">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 273 If the golden section is unique, it is also ubiquitous, as reminders of it (or the related Fibonacci series) appear all around us in nature: in the shape of the nautilus sea shell and the flight path of the peregrine falcon as it dives towards its prey, both of which describe the arc of the logarithmic spiral; in the layout of the clockwise and counter clockwise spirals of the sunflower, pine cone, and pineapple; and in the number of petals and flowers on the horizontal planes of the sneezewort (a plant native to England) and many other plants, to cite just a few instances.10 And perhaps it is this pervasive presence of the golden section and Fibonacci series in the organic materials of nature that has led architects and artists across the millennia to pattern works?whether consciously or not, whether precisely or closely approximate?on their proportional properties, works as diverse in terms of chronology, medium, and cultural context as the west fa?ade of the Parthenon (begun 447 B.C.), Frans Hals's The Laughing Cavalier (1624), Katsushika Hokusai's "Great Wave off Kanagawa" from his Thirty-Six Views of Ml Fugi (1823-1831)?Debussy chose this woodcut as the illustration for the title page of his La Mer?and Le Corbusier's rendering of the human figure in his Modular (1942-1948), in which the architect worked out the proportions painstaking detail." musicological literature, see especially Jonathan D.

I I The literature about the Parthenon is large and often uncritical. Briefly, though the overall design is certainly not based on the golden section, the west fa?ade measures 32,343 mm (width along the next to-bottom step) by 19,558 mm (height from lower-most step to the top of the triangular pediment prior to its partial disintegration), and therefore misses fitting into a golden rectangle by approximately two percent; see the meticulous study in Anne Bulckens, "The Parthenon's Main Design Proportion and its Meaning," Ph.D. diss., Deakin University (Geelong, AUS), 2000 (I am grateful to Dr. Bulckens for her stimulating correspondence about the matter); there is a graphic demonstration of the proportion in Hals's The Laughing Cavalier in Cook, Plates VII and XI, and pp. 463-64; on Hokusai (1760-1849) and the "Great Wave," see Muneshige Narazaki, Hokusai: The Thirty-Six Views ofMt.

For an attempt to debunk at least some aspects of what he refers to as golden section "lore," see George Markovsky, "Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio," College Mathematics Journal, 23 (1992), pp. 2-19, who would remove the Parthenon altogether from the works just cited on the grounds of what he claims are imprecise measurements.</page><page sequence="6">274 Allan W.Atlas In recent decades (momentum began to gather in the 1970s), musicologists too have been busy looking for and finding?or at least claiming to find?significant instances of golden sections and Fibonacci series. And if the favorite hunting grounds have been among the works of such fourteenth-, fifteenth-, and twentieth-century composers as Machaut, Dunstable, Dufay, Debussy, Bart?k, and Stockhausen, to name just a few of the richer quarries, sightings have also been claimed in connection with such seemingly less likely composers as Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, and Berlioz, among others.12 Now, while Debussy (to single out one composer) may have been attracted to the golden section by its culturally-accrued mystical associations,13 even those who do not worship at the altar (or are even completely unaware of the proportion) seem to appreciate its aesthetic properties. Indeed, a century-and-a-quarter of psychological testing has sug gested?though not without being challenged?that subjects who know nothing about golden sections or the Fibonacci series tend to show a preference for shapes that closely approximate their proportions, and may even proportion various bipolar judgments (such as good vs. bad, pretty vs. ugly, etc.) in accordance with them.14 Puccini, it seems, might not have been immune. 12 For a more comprehensive list of composers in whose works golden sections and Fibonacci numbers have been found, see Kramer, The Time of Music, pp. 303-304.

I begin by considering the proportion at the level of the duet as a whole. One of the constant problems in analysis of this kind has to do with finding a viable measuring rod; and for the purposes of this paper, I have measured the length of the duet in two ways: in terms of a constant metrical unit, and in terms of clock?or per formance?time.15 As we shall see, one mode of measuring supports the other. With respect to metrical unit, we can effectively measure the duet in terms of quarter notes, which move along at a relatively constant pace from beginning to end and upon which the beat falls throughout16 The duet is 174 quarter notes long. Thus the "short" golden section (the short segment preceding the long one)17 falls precisely?and rather spec tacularly!?between quarter notes 66 and 67, that is exactly on the bar line between measures I and 2 of RH 42.18 It therefore divides the duet exactly at the point at which and John Adams-Webber, "The Golden Section Hypothesis," British Journal of Psychology, 67 (1976), pp. II 15; Benjafield and T.P.G.

We might note along these lines that, at least in the United States, by far the most popular format for index cards conforms to Fibonacci proportions: 3x5, while the photo labs offer us the option of having our favorite photos developed as 5 x 8 prints. For counterclaims, see Markovsky, pp. 12-15; Michael Godkewitsch, "The Golden Section: An Artifact of Stimulus Range and Measure of Preference," American Journal of Psychology, 87 (1974), pp. 269-77, with a summary in Livio, pp. 181-82. 15. On the problem of "clock" time, see below. 16 Although at this hierarchical-structural level the measure itself could have served as the unit of meas urement, the quarter note produces a more finely tuned result and will definitely be required when we turn to the individual parts of the duet. On the question of beat vs. measure, see Howat, Debussy in Proportion, pp. 15-21.1 would note that the metronome indications quarter = 58 at both RH 41/1 and RH 43/8 do not appear in the autograph score. Nor is there anything about fluctuations of tempo in Luigi Ricci's observations about Puccini's rehearsals of La boh?me that would undermine using the quarter note as a reliable measuring rod; see Rica, Puccini interprete di se stesso, Milan, 1954, pp. 58-59. 17 There is no standard terminology with which to distinguish the golden section in which the long segment precedes the short one from that in which the short segment precedes the long one (again, in terms of spatial movement from left to right and temporal movement from beginning to end). I use "long" golden section forthat in which the long segment precedes the short one, and "short" golden section for that in which the short segment precedes the long one. Lendvai uses "positive" for the sequence of long-short segments and "negative" for the reverse, though this imbues them with qualities that are arbitrary and ultimately non-existent; the same is true of Pascoe's "active" (= long) and "passive" = (short); Howat prefers "primary" and "secondary" for the long-short and short-long sequences, respectively, but, as he admits, this reverses the spatial/temporal order in which they would appear if we are moving from left to right or beginning to end. 18 To spell out the calculations (but only this one time): 174 x 0.618 = 107.532, which I round up to 108; 174 minus 108 = 66, so that the golden section produces shorter and longer segments of 66 and 108 quarter notes, respectively.</page><page sequence="8">276 Allan W. Atlas the lyrical-stable (A-major) Part I draws to a close and the declamatory, tonally unstable Part II begins to stand on its own (after the four beats of overlap). As such, it coincides perfectly with what is surely the duet's single most notable articulation and change of gears, both musically and dramatically.19 Moreover, since Puccini himself suggested in rehearsal that Mimi and Rodolfo hold onto the syllable "-mor" (of "amor!") right through the end of RH 42/1 and then introduce an "interruption" for their kiss,20 the lovers kiss precisely at the short golden section.21 Measuring in real time is not quite as neat: different performances of the same piece may vary in terms of both total duration and proportional relationships within the whole; and though the music itself moves along inexorably through clock time, that is not the way we as listeners experience "musical time."22 Yet as the timings of the seven recordings listed in Table II show, the golden section exists on more than just paper23 Table II. Seven recordings of the duet, with timings (in seconds) for total duration, precise short golden section (SGS) of total duration, actual arrival at SGS, and percentage of total time by which that arrival misses the precise SGS.

If listeners' time estimates differ from measured clock time by 8-16%, we may just as well say that the clocks are wrong-wrong, at any rate, if they are being used to tell us anything about the ways we experience musical time." 23 The recordings were chosen simply on the basis of what I happened to have available at the time I was doing the research.</page><page sequence="9">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 277 For all intents and purposes, then, Antonicelli, Leinsdorf, and Schippers reach their respective clock-time short golden sections with near-perfect accuracy (despite a dif ference of twenty-two seconds in total duration between the slowest and fastest of the three performances), while Beecham, Votto, Berrettoni, and Bernstein miss by amounts that range from 1.6% to 2.6%, deviations that are surely imperceptible over the course of about four minutes.24 In all, the short golden section is very real, both "on paper" and "in time." Although the short golden section at the level of the duet as a whole is the most sig nificant proportion in the number, Parts II, III, and IV contain internal golden sections (now measured solely in terms of quarter notes) that further define important musical dramatic changes of pace. Part II, beginning at RH 42/1:1, is twenty-nine quarter notes long (including the overlap of four quarter notes with Part I), so that the long golden section divides it into seg ments of eighteen plus eleven quarters. Significantly, it is immediately after the eight eenth quarter note (RH 42/5:3) that the chromaticism, which had begun by moving at the rate of one halfstep per measure (RH 42/1-3) and then quickened its pace to two halfsteps per measure (RH 42/4-5:2), stops dead in its tracks, and leaves us dangling, as the anticipated halfstep ascent from A natural to A sharp never arrives. Rather, Mimi incorporates the A natural into an F-sharp minor triad (above an E flat in the bass), and uses its C sharp as a leading tone to D, which in turn takes aim at the dominant pedal on G that will prepare the C major of Part IV. Thus the long golden section of Part II defines an important moment in the overall tonal motion of the duet. Part III begins at RH 42/7:2 (its first four quarter notes overlap with the final four of Part II) and runs on for thirty quarter notes. The short golden section divides Part III into segments of eleven plus nineteen quarters, and so coincides precisely with the arrival of a tonic six-four in C on quarter note 12 (RH 43/3:1), the first unequivocal confirmation 24 For example, Kramer, The Time of Music, p. 332, reports on studies that suggest that the "imperceptible" ranges from 8% to 16%, though these figures apply to total durations of only four to thirty seconds. David Epstein, Shaping Time: Music, the Brain, and Performance, New York, 1995, pp. 498-99, allows for a deviation of up to 5% before discrepancies begin to become apparent, but without defining the total duration. In a communication of I March 2003, Anne Bulckens (see note 10) writes, in connection with the approximately 2% by which the fa?ade of the Parthenon misses fitting into a golden rectangle: "...I guess visitors would not perceive the difference between a precise golden rectangle of such size or an approximation of it..." By far the "hardest line" in terms of lack of tolerance for approximation is that taken by Livio, pp. 159-94, who seems to insist upon two conditions: accuracy of a sort that permits no deviation, and documentary evidence of intent to pattern things after the golden section (Livio, we might note, is an astrophysicist). Yet no matter where we ultimately land on the "impercep tibility" continuum, it seems clear that our tolerance for deviation must be more liberal with respect to temporal proportions than it is in connection with spatial proportions that are standing still.</page><page sequence="10">278 Allan W.Atlas of the C major for which we are heading. Once again, then, an important moment in the evolving tonal scheme of the duet turns on a golden section. Finally, the long golden section of Part IV divides that part's fifty-seven quarter notes into segments of thirty-five plus twenty-two. Here the long golden section, which falls between quarters 35 and 36, misses the upbeat of Mimi and Rodolfo's final "Amor!" (on quarter note 37, RH 43/16:4) by a single quarter and Mimi's high C, which finally resolves all tonal and dramatic tension, by two (that is, by 1.7% and 2,8%, respectively), well within the range of "permissible" deviation. Thus, as Parts II, III, and IV first stir up (with chromaticism and Mimi's uncertainty at the beginning of Part II) and then resolve (via falling fifths: D - G - C) the tonal and dramatic tensions of the duet, they do so pre cisely (Parts II and III) or very nearly at (Part IV) points that define golden sections. We need not dwell on the pleasurable aesthetic effects of bilateral symmetry and cen tral axes.25 First, it is deeply anthropomorphic, as we can see simply by looking in the mirror. Moreover, its balance is easily perceived, and not only allows for slight deviations and variations on each side of the central axis, but actually invites them. Finally, with its customary strong frame, it reinforces our habit of "reading" (and, perhaps, sometimes hearing) shapes from the outside in.26 And as with the golden sections, there are sig nificant instances of bilateral symmetry at the levels of the duet as a whole and within the individual sections. The central axis of the duet as a whole comes between quarter notes 87 and 88 (RH 42/7:2-3), precisely at the beginning of the four-beat passage that set's Mimi's "Se venissi con voi" and serves as the overlapping hinge between Parts II and III; significantly, it is the very point at which Mimi begins her reconciliation with Rodolfo. I shall return to this central axis below in order to consider the dynamic tension that it causes when heard against the duet's short golden section. The midpoint of Part I falls between quarter notes 33 and 34, with quarter note 33 being that on which Mimi enters for the first time and joins Rodolfo?in fff octaves doubled by winds and violins?for the famous melody from Rodolfo's "Che g?lida manina" that had set the words "Talor dal mio forziere..." earlier in Act I (upbeat to RH 32/9). As such, it 25 We might note, however, that it was only in the seventeenth century that the term "symmetry" came to mean the 1:1 proportion between parts on each side of a central axis; its earlier meaning simply referred to pleasing proportions in general, often, especially during the Renaissance, those of the harmonic variety: 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, etc.; see David Summers, "Symmetry," The Dictionary of Art 30, ed. Jane Turner, London, 1996, p. 171. 26. E.H. Gombrich, The Sense of Order: A Study in the Psychology of Decorative Art, Ithaca, 1979, pp. 126-32; see also, Hermann Weyl, Symmetry, Princeton, 1952, pp. 3-38.</page><page sequence="11">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 279 coincides with Part I's strongest affirmation of both tonal stability (A major) and passionate love; it is the climax of the section (and perhaps, in a sense, the very early climax of the duet as a whole); and since the duet had opened with Rodolfos "Talor" melody stated quietly in the orchestra as a counterpoint to his "O soave fanciulla," its return at precisely the middle of Part I lends it (Part I) something of a balanced strophic quality. The central axis of Part II falls precisely on quarter note 15 (RH 42/4:3?there are fourteen quarters on each side), the very beat on which the chromaticism of Part II quickens its pace from one to two halfsteps per measure; it therefore represents the point of maximum instability?both tonal and dramatic?in the duet. (As noted above, the chromaticism will come to a sudden stop four quarter notes later, at the long golden section.) Finally, the midpoint of Part IV's fifty-seven quarter notes comes on quarter note 29 (RH 43/14:4), on the upbeat to the two lovers' first sustained "Amor!" And with the move to the subdominant (of C major) and the ppp on quarter note 30, it launches the fading out (Mimi and Rodolfo are now singing offstage) that characterizes the final measures of Act I. In all, every one of the duet's important shifts of musical or dramatic gears is located at a point that defines either a golden section or a central axis, whether at the level of the duet as a whole or at that of an individual part. IV Any claim that the proportions of the love duet (especially the golden sections) are significant must come to terms with at least three questions often posed by skeptics of such analysis: (I) was Puccini himself conscious of them? (2) are there other significant golden sections lurking around in either La boh?me or any of Puccini's other operas, or are those in the love duet merely isolated flukes? and (3) do we?can we?hear any of this? And to these I shall add a fourth question (though I take it up second), one unrelated to those posed by the skeptics: wherein lies the "dynamic tension" between the duet's golden section and central axis to which I referred above? That Puccini consciously plotted the proportions of the duet with the golden sections (or central axes)27 in mind is inconceivable. Nothing in Puccini's educational background, intel lectual interests, or compositional methods suggests that he would have calculated the golden sections and then either planned or retrospectively adjusted the duet in accord ance with them. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that Puccini even knew what the 27 To a certain extent, the instances of bilateral symmetriy within individual parts grow naturally out of the combination of fairly regular phrasing and relatively short spans; this is clearest in Parts I and II.</page><page sequence="12">280 Allan W.Atlas golden section was.28 Rather, he would have arrived at the proportion intuitively. Does this argue against its structural-aesthetic significance in the love duet? Does it make the network of golden sections less?or even ir?relevant? My answer is no; and I would argue that it is the questions that are irrelevant.29 For in the end, the golden sections (and central axes) are there, just as the keys of A major and C major are there. And if the tonal areas are products of Puccini's conscious?and to some extent "public"?compo sitional choices ("public" in the sense that our musical/analytical training both privileges and teaches us how to deal with them), so the proportions stem from his subconscious intuition, an area that we can view only through a haze. Ultimately, however, both public and private choices are part of the compositional process. As I noted above, that we may hear the two most notable articulations in the duet?the short golden section and the central axis?as tugging against one another produces a sense of tension in our perception of the overall musical-dramatic flow and structure. If we hear the duet as a four-part structure (see Table I) in which the short golden section stands as the single most decisive point of articulation and change of pace, we might illustrate the flow of the duet as follows: (i) stability (lyrical, A major, momentary closure) || (?i) instability (chromatic, open-ended) -? (iii) becoming stable (dominant pedal and tonic six-four chord) ?? (iv) new resolution (C major, closure). In all, once past the articulation at the short golden section, the dynamic motion of the duet is straightforward, quick-paced, and goal directed. The articulation at the central axis, on the other hand, suggests a different flow:30 (i) stability ?&gt; (?i) instability || (iii) becoming stable ?&gt; (iv) new resolution. Now the overall dynamic of the duet changes, as the shift from the static A major to the kinetic chromati cism of Part II may strike us less as a point of simultaneous closure and beginning than as one marked simply by the breakdown of stability. What I think of as the "magical" quality of the short golden section?the melting of the A-major chord into both end and beginning?is perhaps a little less magical. Yet even if we judge this second way of hearing the duet as being subordinate to the first, it nevertheless forces us to go 28 We certainly know that, as a schoolboy, Puccini did not like mathematics; nor did he show any interest in the formal study of aesthetics while at the conservatory in Milan; see Mosco Carner, Puccini: A Critical Biography, 2nd ed., New York, 1974, p. 16, and Julian Budden, Puccini: His Life and Works (The Master Musicians), Oxford, 2002, p. 6. Though Puccini was certainly not a "scholar," Budden's judgment (p. 25) that he was "never an intellectual" strikes me as being somewhat ivory-towerish. 29 Both Kramer, The Time of Music, pp. 317-18, and Howat, Debussy in Proportion, p, 9, adopt similar tough stances, with Kramer writing: "Are proportions established consciously or intuitively? This is another fascinating question, albeit a fundamentally irrelevant one." 30 Clearly, for those who hear the duet as a tripartite structure (see above), both the sense of bilateral symmetry and the tension between central axis and short golden section is considerably weakened; in fact, the articulation at the central axis becomes almost inconsequential, though I think that hearing it as such is to miss the beginning of MimVs emotional about-face.</page><page sequence="13">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 281 back and question (even if we do not disown) our initial interpretation. And no matter how much we downplay the tension between the proportions, it provides a wonderful example of something that resides?whether readily apparent on the surface or buried beneath it?in any work of art that sustains our interest: ambiguity! Consciously or not, Puccini twists our ears.31 Are the golden sections in the love duet a fluke, or did Puccini land on the propor tion?always intuitively, of course?on other occasions? Although I have not "measured" all of Puccini's operas from beginning to end in search of golden sections (nor do I intend to do so), I can point to at least three other numbers in La boh?me in which the proportion seems to be significant: (I) the opening scene of Act III, from the raising of the curtain through RH 6/1; (2) Mimi and Rodolfo's little duologue, "Addio, dolce sveg liare alia mattina" (Act III, RH 30/1 - 31/14); and (3) Mimi's haunting "Sono andati?" in Act IV (measured from either RH 21/1 or RH 21/5 and running through RH 23/1?see Appendix II for details). On the other hand, two numbers in which I looked for signifi cant golden sections turned up nothing: Rodolfo's "Che g?lida manina" and Mimi's "Mi chiamano Mimi" (both in Act I), while a third, Musetta's famous waltz and the ensemble that grows out of it (Act II) had an intriguing series of "near misses."32 Finally, there is the stickiest question of all: even assuming that we come to the duet with some knowledge of the golden section and its lore, do we really perceive the proportion, whether at the level of the duet as whole or those within the individual parts? By far the most cogent and sophisticated discussion of the problem in the musicological literature is that in Jonathan Kramer's The Time of Music, where the chapter titled "Duration and Proportion" leads to a series of questions about the matter and ends with the following observation: "Neither music theory nor music psychology has offered many answers to these intriguing questions..." (p. 321). Unfortunately, I am equally short of answers, especially definitive ones. Yet we might briefly consider two basic points. First, and painfully obvious: since we can only perceive temporal proportions after experiencing the entire musical span, we perceive them only 31 How much weight we give to the central axis, where Mimi says "Se venissi con voi?," may depend on whether, at any given listening, we are concentrating on the musical fabric alone (as I am sure we all do from time to time) or considering the long-term dramatic implications. While the short golden section is surely a more significant articulation on purely musical grounds, it is at the central axis that Mimi overcomes her inhibitions with respect to Rodolfo and thereby launches the remainder of the drama once and for all. I can only say that my own sensitivity to the weight of the articulation at the central axis varies from one listening to another. 32 I limited my search to relatively closed numbers on the grounds that extending it over wider spans with varying tempos and meters (and less clearly-defined frames) raises the question of what to use as the unit of measurement.</page><page sequence="14">282 Allan W Atlas retrospectively, through recall and after the fact,33 something that makes their perception a far more complicated affair than that of spatial proportions, which are nice enough to stand still. Second, our perception of proportions is driven in part by musical context, by the nature of the music to which we are listening. Thus a passage with a lot of musical activ ity?or "information," as Kramer calls it?will be perceived as being longer than one that is skimpy in that respect.34 The Act I love duet provides an instructive example of this. Although a casual listening might leave us with the impression that Part I, with its rich melodic, harmonic, lightly contrapuntal, timbrai, dynamic, and even "wordy" (the libretto) content, is a good deal longer than Part IV, which is much thinner in all these respects (for example, the only three harmonies from one end of Part IV to the other are tonic, dominant, and subdominant, with the final twenty-five quarter notes?nearly one half of the part?consisting of subdominant and tonic only), Part I is, in fact, only nine quarter notes longer than Part IV (sixty-six to fifty-seven), with Leinsdorf, for example, registering a difference of only sixteen seconds (Part I = eighty-one seconds, Part IV = sixty-five seconds) or approximately 8% in his performance time of the two parts (for both of which the published score indicates quarter = 58).35 In the end, though, I doubt that many of us?including those well versed in (and sym pathetic to) golden section lore?immediately discern and identify the presence of the proportion right on the spot. Rather, we might come to recognize its presence through a three-stage process: (I) our retrospective listening process and aesthetic judgment combine to tell us that the proportion of Part I to the remainder of the duet seems "just right" (indeed, I was convinced that Part I ended at exactly the right moment and that its proportional relationship to?and "weight" against?the rest of the duet could not have been better long before it ever occurred to me to check for the golden sec tion); (2) we then analyze the music in terms of proportions; and (3) now armed with the knowledge that Part I defines the short golden section?and perhaps intimidated by the proportion's mythic folklore?we hear (or possibly delude ourselves into think ing that we hear) its presence when we listen to it or play and sing it to ourselves on subsequent occasions. In other words, analysis confirms and reinforces our gut reaction. Finally, perhaps some of us even tend to collapse the time/space dichotomy and actu 33 Kramer, The Time of Music, pp. 309, 320, 322-26, 367-70, refers to the process as "cumulative listening." 34 Kramer, The Time of Music, pp. 330-32. Clearly, this generalization breaks down when the music becomes so activity-packed that we tend to merge things into fewer events; likewise, too thin a musi cal fabric?perhaps a long stretch of recitativo secco in an eighteenth-century opera seria?can seem like an eternity, especially when transferred from the theater to the CD player. 35 See the recordings listed in Table II. I might note that Beecham and Votto reduce the time difference between Parts I and IV by another 1%.</page><page sequence="15">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 283 ally visualize the duet in such a way that we perceive the proportional relationships as if from a bird's-eye view, all at once from beginning to end (the duet is short enough, I think, for us to do so).36 V I should like to conclude with two observations and a postscript of sorts. One of the things that I find particularly striking about Puccini's intuitive placement of important articulations and changes of musical-dramatic gears at points that define the golden section is the slight preference (three to two in the love duet and the other numbers cited above and discussed in Appendix II) forthat version of the proportion in which the short segment precedes the long one. Given Puccini's occasional tendency to over heat, we might have expected the majority of golden sections to be of the long variety, coinciding with the revived-up climax of a number. Yet of the five golden sections at the highest hierarchical level in the four numbers cited (two in Miml's "Sono andati?"), only two define the long golden section, and only one of these?that in "Sono andati?" when measured from the four-bar "introduction" (see Appendix II)?marks the feverish climax of a number. Rather the tendency is toward the short golden section that defines the point at which the first important change of pace occurs, a point at which Puccini must intuitively have felt that it was time for something new, whether in the musical fabric as a whole, as in the love duet, or in something as "small" as the first move away from the tonic, as in "Addio, dolce svegliare alia mattina." As I noted above, Puccini knew just when enough was enough, just when the opening gesture had gained enough structural weight to become "maximally striking" against the longer segment that was still to come.37 Finally, we should view all of this from two other perspectives. First, that two of the seven numbers that I examined in La boh?me turned up nothing at all in the way of significant golden sections, while a third was at best of the "in-the-vicinity" variety, indicates that, whatever positive aesthetic attributes we may attribute to the proportion, it is only one among many factors that makes Puccini's sense of pacing and proportion seem just 36 On this point, see Rogers, "The Golden Section in Musical Time," pp. 141-45, who cites a wonder ful example of such collapse in J.B. Priestley, Man and Time, New York, 1964, pp. 85-86, in which the distance between two points is experienced first through the window of a train (temporally) and then through that of a high-altitude, high-speed airplane from which we can see both points simultaneously (spatially). 37 I borrow the term from Berlyne, p. 232, who argues that the golden section "allows the minor [shorter, smaller] element to occupy a proportion of the whole that makes it maximally striking"; in other words, when the smaller portion of a whole is equal to the short golden section (about 38%), its proportion becomes "maximally striking" against that whole; on the other hand, if it is notably smaller or larger, there is the danger that it will, respectively, get lost altogether or run the risk of no longer being perceived as the smaller portion; see also, Kramer, The Measure of Music, pp. 318-20; Benjafield and Adams-Webber, p. 13; Rogers, "The Golden Section in Musical Time," p. 109.</page><page sequence="16">284 Allan W. Atlas right. And second, I hope that I have not been guilty of kneeling at the altar; clearly, the presence of a golden section in a piece of music, no matter how pleasing an effect its presence might produce, does not make it a better piece of music than one in which the proportion does not play a significant role. For stripped of its folklore, the golden section, when it appears at all, is something that is simply there, to be appreciated as we appreciate any other element?a beautiful melody or an affective modulation?that contributes to our sense of aesthetic satisfaction. Postscript On 25 June 2002, I administered an informal test to four musicians who, while familiar with the Act I love duet to varying degrees, knew little or nothing about the golden section and its lore (as I ascertained after the test). The results show just how varied reactions to temporal proportions can be. The test consisted of three parts: (1) Having identified the work to which we would be listening as the Act I love duet, I played Part I only, letting the listeners follow the music with copies of the piano-vocal score that broke off precisely at the end ofthat section. (2) I then played the entire duet (without supplying the remainder of the score), and then, with no warning, asked the following questions: (i) was the propor tional relationship of Part I to the duet as whole "pleasing" or "unpleasing"; and (ii) approximately what proportion of the duet did Part I constitute? The four responses were as follows (bear in mind that the correct proportion is 38.2%): Listener A: "pleasing?2/3s"; Listener B: "pleasing?33%"; Listener C: "unpleasing?50%"; Listener D: "slightly unpleasing, a bit too short?2/3s." (3) I then played the entire duet again, this time telling the listeners in advance that I would once again ask them to estimate the proportion of Part I to the duet as a whole. Now the responses were as follows: Listener A: "1/3"; Listener B: "35%"; Listener C: "40%"; Listener D: "1/2." Thus each of the four listeners came closer?three of them much closer?to perceiving the correct proportion of Part I to the duet as a whole when he/she knew just what to listen for. And though we may draw different conclusions from this quite unscientific round of testing, one of these, I think, might have to be that, given both sufficient famili arity with the music and the opportunity to think about what we have heard (even for a short time) with the matter of proportions in mind, we can perceive the presence of the golden section with a fair degree of accuracy, and that, all other things being equal, we hear it as being proportionally "just right."</page><page sequence="17">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 285 APPENDIX I Appendix I provides a piano-vocal score of the love duet (Ricordi, 1896, Plate Number 99000) onto which I have laid out my analysis of the structure and proportional relation ships. I have numbered the quarter notes at strategic locations: the first eight and final eight quarters of the individual parts, and the points at which important articulations are defined by either the golden section or a central axis; when a quarter note has more than one number (for instance, 63/1) the first is the cumulative count, the second, the count within an individual part (the hinge between Parts II and III accounts for three sets of numbers).

Atlas APPENDIX II As I noted above, there are at least three other closed numbers or scenes in La boh?me in which golden sections coincide with important structural-dramatic articulations. 1. Opening scene of Act III: With its wonderfully delicate orchestration, the opening scene of Act III runs from the opening curtain through RH 6/1. It is 174 measures long, with the 2/4 measures themselves serving as a convenient unit of measurement (despite the occasional, small fluctuations in tempo). The long golden section falls on the barline between measures 108 and 109 (RH 3/30 - 31), and therefore coincides precisely with the point at which Musetta breaks off the quotation of her famous Act II waltz melody and a group of revelers simultaneously begin their "Trallerall?... traileralle... Eva e No?." The simultaneous end of one event and the beginning of another, so different in their emotional character, produces a striking change of musical and emotional gears. 2. Mimi and Rodolfo's, "Addio, dolce svegliare alia mattina," Act III: This little duo logue is eighty-two quarter notes long (RH 30/1 - 31/9), with the golden section falling between quarters 31 and 32 (RH 30/11). The proportion coincides with the most definitive cadence so far (on the tonic, G flat) and the first movement away from the tonic, as Mimi heads immediately for the mediant, B-flat minor. 3. Mimi's "Sono andati?" Act IV: Despite the occasional retard, the unrelenting, ostinato-like quarter note can serve as a convenient unit of measurement. Here there are overlapping golden sections depending upon the two seemingly possible points from which we may begin to measure: from RH 21/5, where Mimi enters with the words "Sono andati?" after an upbeat of a quarter note, or from RH 21/1, where a four-measure orchestral reprise of Rodolfo's "Talor dal mio forziere" (Act I) functions as an introduction of sorts (it establishes the pitch C as the tonic, even if, for the movement, C major instead of Mimi's soon-to-come C minor) and the real beginning of the number. In any event, the number ends at RH 23/1. (a) Measured from the downbeat of Mimi's entrance, "Sono andati?" runs along for 108 quarter notes, with the short golden section coming between quarters 41 and 42 (RH 21/11). As such it coincides with the final syllable of "Sei il mio amor," where Mimi sweeps up to a high A flat (her highest note so far), which immediately serves as a new and hopeful tonic in the major mode after the dark C minor in which she has shrouded herself up to that point. At the same</page><page sequence="23">Stealing a kiss at the golden section 291 time, the orchestra gives up its insistent, dirge-like, quarter-note accompani ment and gets swept up in the rhythm of Mimi's melodic line. In all, the short golden section marks the point at which melody, tonality, rhythm, and Mimi's emotional outlook all change character at the same?and for the first?time. (b) Measured from RH 21/1, "Sono andati?" grows to 124 quarter notes. Now both the short and long golden sections take on significance. The short golden sec tion falls between quarters 47 and 48 (RH 21/12), precisely at the end of Mimi's opening eight-measure statement (the "main theme," as it were, and all that the orchestra will quote nostalgically at the very end of the opera), while the long golden section arrives between quarters 77 and 78 (RH 21/20), as Rodolfo, following Mimi's hint, hits his own high A flat and the optimistic (false though it is, as the ensuing E-flat minor attests) climax of the number as a whole.
