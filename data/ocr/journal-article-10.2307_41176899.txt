<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mythos and Logos Brooks Otis lives his life in what can be called the world of proximate experience. This is the world to which at least 90% of our activity and thought is de- voted : it is the world of work, love and competition, of economics, politics and war. It is the world in which we must earn a living, raise a family, satisfy our personal ambitions and secure the love, friendship or respect of other men and women. But it is a world of very brief duration terminated first by death and second by oblivion. And this experience is, as has been often remarked, repeated in every second of our lives : the past is dead and soon forgotten and the present of actual living eludes us before we can grasp it. We look forward to the future but the future when it comes has the same characteristics. The poignance of such a situation is of course dimmed by many anodynes, - by the very routine of living, by sleep, by brief spurts of pleasure and by the occasional experience of personal success. None- theless man sooner or later raises a demand for something more durable and satis- fying. The answers to this demand cannot however be found within the world of proximate experience since this world does not of itself provide any vision of things beyond the apparent finality of death and time. The logos or rational theory by which man solves the problems of proximate experience does not help him to solve the problems of ultimate experience, - of the meaning of death and time and the universe as a whole. Here he therefore turns to something very different,- to mythos or myth, something not directly provable but also necessary in the long run for. continued existence even in the world of proximate experience. I There have been many mythoi or 'myths' in this sense but there are only two major mythoi, though the first of these has taken slightly different forms in dif- ferent cultures. These two mythoi represent the two major alternative ways Ã²f find- ing a value or meaningf ulness that transcend death and time. Let us call the first the Generality mythos. To this, the central obstacle to all meaningfulness in existence is the destructive movement of time. Time is what spells death to all particular things or configurations : what survive time are only generalities, - patterns that are repeated, types that persist even though their particular exemplars die, ideas that last when their temporal copies do not. These are the evidence for a principle of stability, permanence, changelessness, atemporality and immortality in the universe. Man can achieve real security and happiness only in so far as he withdraws himself from things temporal and particular and merges himself with the eternal, immutable center. Let us call the second the Eschatological mythos. To this, the meaningfulness of existence is inextricably bound in a temporal context : only in such a context can particulars exist or move. But this temporal context is itself anchored to an eternal This paper was read at the September 1954 "Week of Work" of the National Council on Religion in Higher Education.

[219]</page><page sequence="2">The Christian Scholar context through which it is saved from ultimate annihilation. Time moves to an end which is the fulfillment of time. This fulfillment is also the redemption of all the particulars within the temporal context. This is because the whole temporal- particular continuum is conceived to be the creation of a personal God who can do with it what He will. He can overcome natural mutability and death because He made them to be overcome : time is the stuff of the dramatic situation in which man is left free to choose the destiny that will be his forever at time's end. The prob- lem is not time and death in themselves but man's good or bad decision. Time and death are merely consequences of this decision and of God's plan to overcome the sin which is wrong decision. The eschaton or end of time is thus both a resurrection or restoration of the past (the dead) and judgment on the past. Only when the drama of man's relations with God and with other men is fully concluded will God's purpose and man's destiny be absolutely clear. In the meantime, however, God has not left man in ignorance: on the contrary he has revealed himself in a variety of ways, finally in the very shape and nature of man. For the essence of man's situa- tion as God has set it up is that (a) man should know God's will and (b) be free to follow it or not and (c) be saved from the consequences of misused freedom so far as this is possible without the total destruction of freedom. These two myths are nothing but the logical consequences of two basic con- ceptions of nature. In the first conception, nature is itself divine. This divinity was originally conceived as a pantheon of anthropomorphic beings, - gods with human bodies and thoughts but also natural powers or forces as well. The sun, moon, earth, rivers, winds, sea, and also some animals and plants are gods. This was and is the original religion of most simpler or 'primitive' peoples though in most pre-agricultural societies and many of the less developed agricultural societies the ghosts of the dead play a more important and immediate role than that of the actual 'nature-gods/ The great Chinese, Indian and Hellenic cultures all had such a nature-religion or mythos in their earlier stages. Yet as all these cultures reached a higher level of civilization and developed the capacity to think critically about the world, the discrepancy between the impersonal power and uniformity of nature on the one hand and the human arbitrariness or caprice of the manlike gods on the other hand led to a gradual discarding of the older anthropomorphism. The con- ception of nature as a living but impersonal force - physis, brahma, tao - first coexisted with and then supplanted (at least for the intelligent or educated classes) the simpler nature-religion. In this sense mythos yielded to logos, - simple myth to critical thought. This process could and did take a simply negative and sceptical turn involving a rejection of all sacral sanctions and ordinary morality : this is vivid- ly exemplified in the Chinese legalists, the Carvaka materialists of India, the Greek Sophists. But it also took - and this was the culturally more important and signi- ficant development - the form of a reassertion of mythos - of a world of ultimate experience - on a much higher level. This was in effect the generality mythos which we have summarized above. Man no longer appealed to Gods, to manlike be- [220]</page><page sequence="3">Mythos and Logos ings like himself but rather tried to achieve or find an identity between his own nature and the universal principle or force behind all things. In this way he could overcome particularity and time and achieve the timeless generality that is at the heart of existence. This meant of course a radical devaluation of ordinary, temporal, corporeal, social life : here the Taoist sage, the Vedantist, the Neo-platonist reveal a remarkable agreement in regimen and aim. The aim was to reject historical ex- istence and human particularity and withdraw into a state without time and without concrete multiplicity. The generality mythos is thus the mythos of de-humanized nature-religion. And it is just this that constitutes the real problem of the generality mythos. The older nature gods were admittedly very unsatisfactory but they at least showed some sort of human purpose and concern. They were to some degree 'thous' with which the human T could make contact. This was not true of the impersonal physis or logos, brahma or tao. Platonism and Stoicism, for example, tried hard but very unsuccessfully to combine the idea of purpose and providence with an essentially impersonal logos or archetypal unity. Carneades rightly exposed the absurd incon- sistency of Zeno and Chrysippus on this point. The very idea oipurpose cannot logi- cally exist in an immutable being who is also the whole of nature : how can he pur- pose to be something other than he already is? But this can only mean that the whole temporal, historical order is simply deprived of any real significance. It is good only in so far as it reveals a certain remnant or attenuated form of atemporal generality: the best that time can do is to move in a repetitive cycle. But in so far as it is time or movement it is a force that is alien to the divine and exists in spite of the divine. In so far as particular existence - existence within a temporal, material context - is concerned, it can only save itself by destroying itself, - by letting itself be absorbed in the timeless generality which is by definition its absolute antithesis. The contradiction here is not felt only by the modern Western mind but emerges clearly within the three cultures themselves. What reader of the Gita, for example, can fail to be impressed by the discrepancy between Arjuna's sense of caste duty and his desire for immediate emancipation? What student of Buddh- ism can fail to remark the singular lack of motivation for Buddha's great act of pity in withholding his own nirvana until he had taught others the way? The failure of the basic mythical premise to supply a reason for social or human concern is surely as great here as in Stoicism or in Taoism themselves. The whole modern development of social idealism in India - the Ramakrishna mission, Ghandi, etc. - come, as is well known, not from native Indian sources but from the Christian and humanitarian West. In contrast the eschatological mythos was by its intrinsic nature unsusceptible to dehumanization of this sort. It contained in itself what we may call a principle of mythical resistance to logos. Its God retained his personal, anthropomorphic char- acter: in fact Christianity, as distinct from Judaism, owes its origin to a deliberate [221]</page><page sequence="4">The Christian Scholar reassertion of the divine humanity. The reason for this is quite evident from what has already been said. For the Jewish-Christian God was not a nature-god as were other nature-gods. As creator He was above nature: he was not identified with any natural force or power. Nature was the product and not the essence of his arbitrary will. He thus could not be reduced to a principle of generality within na- ture. On the contrary, his personality could never be depersonalized because there was no impersonal standard to which he was supposed to conform. God remained a 'thou* confronting the human 'I* : one particular being beside another particular be- ing. But God also remained the source and ground of all being as its creator and sustainer. This is why God is able both to inform time with personal meaning and to master time and death by overcoming its destructiveness in an eschatological triumph over it. II But this does not mean that the eschatological mythos was completely im- munized against logos or critical reduction. In fact there have been three major attempts to reduce or transform this mythos by largely eliminating its Ã§schatological content. 1. The first took place in the Greek-speaking area of the Eastern Mediterranean in the first four Christian centuries. It was, to speak in very summary terms, an effort to harmonize the eschatological and generality mythoi or, iii other words, Jewish-Christian and Greek-platonic ideas. Though heretical attempts to deny the major credal tenets - including the eschaton - were rejected, salvation was more and more conceived as the acquisition of divinity in the sense of a generalized and timeless condition - an escape from temporal particular existence - '- rather than an eschatological redemption of time itself. The world of becoming - the (genetic) world subject to birth and death and change in time - was regarded, in the char- acteristic manner of the generality mythos, as a mere obstacle or mainly negative thing to be overcome and superseded by its exact opposite, beginningless (agenetic) and deathless stability. 2. A quite different development occurred in the Latin or Romanized West. Here the effort was not primarily to follow the Greek East in conceiving salvation to be divination or theosis in the sense of overcoming temporal particularity but to transform the new Christian society - the Church - into a permanent divine in- stitution with both heavenly and earthly branches so to speak. Eventually the branch on earth will be merged with the branch in heaven : this is the eschaton. In effect the movement of time and history is stopped in this conception : the last judgment is anticipated in all essential respects since the Church is the final and authoritative manifestation of God's will on earth. Of course individual members of the Church remain to be judged but even here the collective last judgment is effectively anti- cipated by an individual judgment after death. The effect of such a reinterpretation of the eschatological mythos was to make the whole mythos extremely vulnerable to [222]</page><page sequence="5">Mythos and Logos logos or criticai thought within the world of proximate experience, since in fact the ecclesiastical organization did not succeed in stopping the movement of history or establishing a truly stable religious society. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the secularism of the Church itself combined with the emergence of a far more dynamic European culture to shake the ecclesiastical ideal to its very founda- tion. The Church has survived but without unity or real ability to direct the course of events. 3. The third attack on the eschatological mythos corresponds rather closely to that of logos on mythos in the Chinese, Indian and Greek cultures. The scientific movement which started in the era of the Renaissance had an experimental or in- ductive character which we cannot parallel in any culture associated with a generality mythos and which really seems to be due in large part to the Christian attitude toward nature. Nonetheless it was also a continuation of Greek logical and mathema- tical thought and sought to subject the data it discovered in exploration or experi- ment to highly abstract and mathematical treatment. This at once created a very marked tension with the anthropomorphic thought-world of the eschatological mythos. This tension was not the same as that, for example, between the old nature-gods of Greece and the conception of natural generality which emerged from the logos of Ionia, for as we have seen the God of the esehatological mythos was never identified with nature as were the nature-gods. Nevertheless the creation and action of God had been conceived in an anthropomorphic way which seemed to be incompatible with the new idea of generalized, predictable action according to mathematically statable theory. We cannot describe all the results of this develop- ment : it is in fact all but coterminous with the whole of modern intellectual history. Two results must however be briefly mentioned : One is the re-emergence of sceptic- ism as to the existence of any world of ultimate reality and underlies all the theories which can be labeled very loosely as forms of naturalism, - the attempt to confine reality to observable phenomena ; the other can be as loosely labeled idealism and constitutes in effect a bifurcation of the universe that claims equal authority and trust for the world of value on the one hand and the world of physical phenomena and scientific law on the other, since both are manifestations of mind. For the fact that the mind is the funnel through which all experience must pass was conceived to involve the superior status of mind over experience. But this attempt to raise mind over experience has signally failed because in fact bare mind - the mind be- fore or above experience - is a mere abstraction. Ill This analysis - telescoped, oversimplified and schematic as it is - may never- theless help to bring out the essential point in the relation of mythos and logos. This is in brief that logos has in the past tended to reduce an original mythos (i.e., a mythos not already exposed to logos) either to nonentity (myth in the popular sense of falsehood) or to some form of generality mythos. No analysis of the human [223]</page><page sequence="6">The Christian Scholar needs and concerns which mythos admittedly meets as logos does not, can of itself rehabilitate mythos except in the form of a generality mythos. It can do no good to accept the eschatological mythos in a 'symbolic' or 'non-literal* way if the referents of the symbols are accepted only as given in generality mythos. Here it seems that the allegorizing of Origen is quite the same in effect as the symbolic interpretation of Tillich (i.e. the interpretation of biblical or theological statements - in short the statements of the eschatological mythos - as statements of a really ontologica! or philosophical character). This is equivalent to saying that the Bible must mean what a given doctrine of being means. But the Bible is not logos but mythos, and when logos reduces mythos in this way the result is always, as I have said, the reduction of mythos to myth (simple falsehood) or the reduction of all mythos to a generality mythos. And a generality mythos is precisely mythos in which there is no personal God, no ultimate concern for the particular, no real victory of the particular over the destructiveness of time. Modern interpretations of Christianity have not, it seems to me, altered in any essential way the basic problem involved in the logos-mythos relation. The existent- ialist analysis which really started with Kierkegaard, though its full development and impact was delayed for almost a century, has thrown very great light on a dimension of human existence : that of the particular human being in time who yet claims a meaningfulness beyond time and death - to which no objective philosophy like, for example, Hegel's had done justice. The attempt of modern man in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to live without mythos as if he could satisfy all his human demands in the world of proximate experience and, perhaps even more significantly, his appalling contemporary attempt to live by pseudo-mythoi in which aspects of proximate experience - a particular national group, a particular kind of economic system - are given a false ultimacy, have revealed the deficiency of all philosophies which neglect the plight of the particular human being in him- self. But between this particular human being, man in his existential situation, and any decisive reassertion of the eschatological mythos still stands logos, - this time in the form of modern science and modern scientific method. Atheistic existentialism accepts logos as truth of a kind that is wholly incompatible with any mythos : all that man can do is to accept the "absurdity" of his situation and in quite personal and wholly subjective manner assert himself against it. But much modern religious thinking also rejects the eschatological mythos for the same reason, - the fact that it is not compatible with modern logos. In other words there is felt to be no cosmic Person who really exists and who really can save the individual from time and death but merely an ultimate meaningfulness - a ground of being - which the particular must accept as his sole value even though this is not salvation of his particular existence. To put it plainly and bluntly, much modern religious thought rejects the idea of personal survival of death in any form. And it rejects it primarily because it no longer believes in the God of the eschatological mythos - that is in a God who really has power over time and death. It reveals here most clearly f224]</page><page sequence="7">Mythos and Logos the decisive influence of logos for it is just at this point - at the point where God's real power over nature is at stake - that the eschatological mythos seems most incompatible with logos in its modern form. Here also a curious sort of double game is often played even to a point of considerable self-deception. When we interpret the language of mythos as allegory or symbolism or some form of "non-literal" statement - i. e. as pointing to a referent other than that literally or actually given - we are saying of course that the thing symbolized and not the symbol is the reality, - the "thing-in-itself." But what we believe the referent of the symbol to be will be determined solely by our particular theory of truth or reality. To Origen this was essentially Platonism : to Tillich it is a particular kind of ontology (clearly derived from German idealism and exis- tentialism) : to Bultmann it is really a kind of modern existentialism very like that of Heidegger. Now this is something very different from simply rejecting a merely literalist or fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible. For one can accept the eschatological mythos as truth or reality and use it as a criterion of biblical inter- pretation without thereby accepting every statement of the Bible as literal truth. This is so because the Bible is not the mythos itself but merely a statement of the mythos in language partly literal, partly symbolical and allegorical. It is also a state- ment made by people over a thousand years or more and is therefore in no sense completely consistent. But this does not mean that we cannot get at the essential mythos - the real core of mythical truth or what purports to be the truth - which the Bible reveals. When we survey the history of mythoi, as I have tried to do in exceedingly schematic fashion in the first section of this paper, we can I think find out what the essential eschatological mythos is. One can still dispute about details and perhaps about some essentials : but I think it is in principle possible to distinguish quite clearly between the eschatological mythos as such and alternative mythoi or theories of truth. We can for example say with very considerable assurance that the eschatological mythos is not the generality mythos. If we try to reinterpret the eschatological mythos as a symbol or allegory of generality mythos, then we are really saying that the generality mythos and not the eschatological mythos is the truth. IV We can thus come to the nub of the problem. To what extent is logos really compatible with either the generality or the eschatological mythos? At first sight it seems far more compatible with the generality mythos since the generality mythos posits an impersonal nature which does not involve miracles or awkward inter- ferences with a system of internal causation. The abstract, generalized character of modern science seems far closer to an abstract, generalized view of nature. But when we look at another aspect of the modern logos, the generality mythos can be seen to be all but incompatible with it. What appealed to the ancient Greeks as the reality in nature with which the anthropomorphic nature gods could hardly be recon- [225]</page><page sequence="8">The Christian Scholar ciled was a permanence or permanent regularity which survived the temporality and mutability of particular existents. Nature as a whole was a constant entity. Nature worked by a logos or law that was itself immutable. To Plato the phenomenal world was an imperfect copy of the ideal world and even the time of the phenomenal world was a copy of eternity in that it was repetitive. Thus nature itself pointed beyond time to eternity. If the phenomenal world were considered to be simply an illusion - as with the Eleatics and the Vedantists - it would nonetheless be an illusion which revealed as well as concealed a reality. So far as the life of man is concerned, emancipation from merely phenomenal existence is possible because man is grounded in a nature which is itself translucent to ultimate permanent reality. It is precisely such a view of nature that modern science has all but des- troyed. We cannot now make sense of the universe without the temporal dimension. The eternal universes of both Ptolemy and Newton are to the modern conception as snapshots to a full-length cinema. Even most scientific law is to be viewed as the characteristic of a particular epoch of nature, not as a characteristic of na- ture Ã¼berhaupt. The very different character of the worlds that are infinitely small and infinitely great from the world of Newtonian or Euclidean experience has given us a perspective which makes talk about the eternity of any particular natural con- figuration seem quite parochial. The fact is that time is a far more radical dissolvent than we had thought. This is not merely because the universe is doomed to increas- ing randomness or entropy (if in fact it is and there is not as some think a con- stant principle of creation within it) but because it really is subject to radical trans- formations that dissolve the very texture of most seeming identities save perhaps at the very lowest electromagnetic level. This is why it is so extremely implausible to posit an existential unity between man as such and any ground of being in nature. We can put all this most succinctly perhaps by saying that for the modern logos the most fundamental category is time or that for it reality (has an historical character. This is the essential idea of modern process philosophy and in this respect modern process philosophy represents a radical break with both the Aristote- lian and the Cartesian or Newtonian conceptions of reality. But modern process philosophy has rather conspicuously failed to give meaning to the temporal process. Whitehead for example finds the really organic character of the process in its lowest component element- the atomic event - and conceives of God's nature as in part the consequence of the conjoint action of the events in process. Neither he nor Bergson nor Alexander nor Croce had any real conception of a God in terms of which the whole temporal process possesses direction and meaning. They protested against the older block universe in which the past wholly determined the future and in which therefore no true novelty ever emerged, but they all looked upon the on going process as a rather blind movement which produced God rather than was produced by God. Their utmost concession to a meaningful or vital prin- ciple in existence was to posit the pan-psychic character of nature at all levels: [226]</page><page sequence="9">Mythos and Logos this however signally failed to do justice to temporal process as an intelligible order or whole. Whenever, however, we really think through the idea of meaningful temporal process we inevitably arrive at something very close to the eschatological mythos. That is to say we arrive at the idea of a power controlling temporal process in a way which can have personal meaning to us. In so far as God is above nature, nature as it unfolds in time will never constitute a self-sufficient entity in terms of which each successive present can be simply deduced from the past. On the other hand the temporal process will not be merely arbitrary but will possess an order of its own. There are, I think, very strong reasons for seeing even in the rather limited, range of temporal process accessible to us an order which cannot be reduced to mere randomness or chance without a very improbable theory of probability. This however is an immense topic that I can only mention in passing : the chief point I want to stress here is that the modern man who accepts the modern logos in at least its major emphases and findings is almost inevitably forced to choose between either a really atheistic type of process philosophy or what finally amounts to an overt or covert acceptance of the eschatological mythos. What is no longer possible is to view nature in simply non-temporal terms as the true expression or experience of the whole of reality. There can be no adequate doctrine of being that is not con- joined with a doctrine of time. Much the same problem also arises in modern theories of human history. Here the modern world has, just as in its physics and biology, accepted the radically temporal character of existence : history is transformation not in the sense that it is a series of variations on an essentially identical theme or of merely repetitive cycles of events but in the sense that it is the bringer of genuine novelty and of a future that is always essentially different from the past. Modern man finds the historical theory of China, Greece and Rome - the theory of history as the infinitely repeated effect of an unalterable human psychology - to be simply naive and wholly lacking a real chronological perspective. But the modern view of history does not find any true meaningfulness in it. It wavers in fact between a Utopian optimism and a cynical pessimism depending on whether it views the past as a prelude to future perfection or to future ruin. But no matter what one expects of the future, it can never atone for the destructiveness of time. The future that really matters to the particular individual is not the unknown future beyond the present but the future of the past itself. If every particular moment is doomed as soon as it slides into the past, then there can be no escape from ultimate meaninglessness. Here Soloviev ex- pressed the fundamental truth when he declared that what really mattered was not the future of our great grandchildren but the future of our great grandfathers. This is why any view of history that finds the only locus of meaning in present or future is bound to be almost intolerably superficial. [227]</page><page sequence="10">The Christian Scholar Here again if we want meaning we must get beyond a conception of temporal process as the mere movement of present-death, - that is the conception of the present as that which reduces all vitality to a rigid and unalterable pastness. Here the very historicism of modern man - his consciousness of time as radical trans- formation - has, just as in his physical science, made any form of the generality mythos almost impossible. From this standpoint even so relatively recent a thinker as Emerson, with his notion of Man as a constant entity always finding the same nature around him and always rediscovering in his own experience the experience of his ancestors (so that he could be, so to speak, his own Christ in a perennially firsthand contact with deity), seems touched with a curious obsolescence. We can- not solve the problem of time by treating it as an illusion or as a tread-mill. The most eloquent testimony to the failure of Taoism, Buddhism, or Hinduism to satisfy modern man is in fact the present condition of India and China. Actually the only live option today is a choice between the eschatological mythos and mere atheistic negation. The pseudo-mythoi - the various attempts to give a show of ultimacy to proximate experience, to a new social order or a na- tional group - are doomed by the very nature of the temporal process for no present or future moment can ever satisfy an actual man and no social or intellectual structure can defy the action of time. Here the medieval experiment - the attempt to make Christianity a permanent institution rather than an eschatological conquest of time - itself prepared the way for its own decline. It simply could not contain the future and the future repudiated the theory which tried to immobilize it. Very unfortunately, however, though probably inevitably, the reformation and renaissance criticism of the medieval church did not in fact repudiate it on the ground of its perversion of eschatology. Instead they also repudiated an essentially eschatological conception of Christianity and operated with quite non-eschatological conceptions of individual piety and decision or individual happiness in the world. Also the profund- ity of the eschatological insight - the thought that the particular person is always bound in a temporal context and that real salvation of the particular person can never be divorced from the salvation of the temporal context itself - was lost in part because it seemed to both ancient and modern logos a merely miraculous and crude conception, - a mere aspect of the climate of opinion in first century Judea. Yet ironically enough belief in miracle, the survival of death and the power of God over nature was made extraordinarily difficult by the very fact of being removed from an eschatological frame of reference. They become mere interruptions of a con- stant nature rather than manifestations of the divine character of a temporal process which is at once unpredictable novelty and the fulfillment of an integrated whole. V Here we come at last to the fundamental factor which determines the relation of mythos and logos. The early nature myths were unable to hold out against the power of logos because they simply did not correspond to a growing insight into [228]</page><page sequence="11">Mythos and Logos the constancy and generality of nature. What we have called the generality mythos was an attempt to find meaning in a nature that was shorn of personal or mythical- anthropomorphic character. But such a mythos, as we have seen, could not do justice to man's demand for meaning in his social and cultural life: society and finally nature itself were devalued in the Neoplatonic, Taoist, Buddhist, Vedantist and other Hindu systems. On the other hand, the mearainglessness of the temporal pro- cess (the destructiveness of the past, the elusive instantaneousness of the present, the not-yetness of the future) could only be met by denying the radical transformation that time effects in both nature and human history. Modern logos in its theory of nature and history has fully recognized and even given supreme emphasis to the temporal character of existence but it has been almost pitifully superficial in its attempt to find meaning in time. To treat the past as a mere prelude to a secular present or future rests as we have said on a thoroughly false optimism about the future (or alternately a false cynicism) and, more fundamentally, on a failure to see that no doctrine of the future can solve the tragedy of the past. But modern logos has tended to reject the eschatological mythos because it cannot really believe in a God who has power over time. In fact it would be true to say that the Whiteheadean view - or the view of process philosophy in general - of a God who is the mere creature of process (in other words of time itself) is the one which modern logos finds easiest to accept when indeed it thinks in theistic terms at all. This is due to a number of reasons but fundamentally to a reason that is common to the most naive as well as the most sophisticated levels of modern thought, - that is an utter inability to believe that God can intervene from outside the process or that such things as the Sinai coven- ant, the Resurrection, and a real eschatological event are possible in any sense save that of symbols for certain subjective experiences. Such a symbolic interpretation must, it seems true, posit in the last resort a theory of reality which is only another form of the generality mythos. In fact the propounders of such symbolic interpreta- tion in our own day mix their theories with a rather desperate attempt to assert both the meaningfulness of temporal process as well as that of particular individuals. Their systems thus seem to me to be profoundly illogical. The eschatological mythos cannot be symbolized in these terms without indeed being converted into its exact opposite - generality mythos. A mere literalism is certainly not the answer. Nevertheless the eschatological mythos can only be truly meaningful when it is taken as pointing to real temporal events - to real loci of the divine breakthrough or more strictly the divine shaping of time become visible at particular points of translucency. For the eschatological mythos is not simply a mythical symbol of nature but also a purportedly factual his- tory of temporal process. This is why it was finally resistant to logos as the older nature myths were not and why it is today consistent with a view of radical tem- poral change as the generality mythos is not. The main prerequisite to an under- [2291</page><page sequence="12">The Christian Scholar standing of eschatological mythos today is not (as it never can be) mere willingless to believe without evidence but rather a deeper insight into the true character of time. A lesser but important prerequisite is much greater clarity as to the relation of symbol to object symbolized. Here we certainly can make some use of the mod- ern critical analysis of language and syntax if we can only avoid the positivistic presuppositions of many of the analysts. But in the last resort the relation of logos and mythos today is a problem of what we conceive the true character of the tem- poral structure of events to be. Here as in the past logos and mythos confront each other in a tension of attraction and hostility which we can accept in faith even if the ultimate outcome lies beyond any rational prediction. Thus the major point at issue here has been often obscured in modern dis- cussion of the Bible. This is the simple fact that whatever liberties of interpretation we may take with the Bible we can never eliminate the reference to some kind of intervention within history from a force that is beyond history without also elimi- nating the Bible's claim to be history. In concreto, this involves chiefly our inter- pretation of the Exodus experience - the divine choosing of the Jews- -and of the Resurrection - the event in which the Church saw validation of Christ's messianic and eschatological claims. In so far as we see these events to be unique exceptions to universal, natural law or to a purely self-contained history operating only through causes internal to itseif, we are involved in a psychologically impossible antithesis of fact and reason. But really modern logos as we have just seen does not at all in- volve such a view but rather tends to regard time as the locus of both continuity and radical novelty. I cannot further discuss this very difficult problem here. All I wish to point: out is that we cannot escape it by accepting the data or theories of 'science' (often quite out of date when the non-specialist becomes aware of them) as a structure of fact that has no real bearing on the reality of ultimate religious experience. We cannot believe by eliminating logos or asserting the independence of logos from mythos. Whether we like it or not, we are so made that the tension of logos and mythÃ²s will continue to operate in us and in our environment. VI And here we encounter a final fact of the most decisive importance. This is that the eschatological mythos finds the most powerful vehicle of its realization in logos itself. For in effect what this mythos, if taken seriously, asserts is that man can never hope to achieve any sort of permanence or cultural stability and that death and time themselves are signs or indices of a sinfulness which corrupts and dooms all human enterprise. Time is meaningful not in that it ever gives meaning to the passing moment (no passing moment can be so beautiful as to heed the Faustian cry of 'stay') but in the sense that its very motion is bringing to completion a drama whose end is redemption. One of the chief factors which time expresses and mobi- lizes is the cumulative process of man's understanding of nature and himself : that is logos. Logos is what gives man the illusion of power and progress and that raises [230]</page><page sequence="13">Mythos and Logos both his creativity and his sinfulness to a quite new dimension. It is thus at once the thing with which man tries to overcome the temporal fragility of his existence and the thing which threatens this existence most directly. While logos strives to establish a climate of permanency in a world of temporality and death, it establishes finally a climate of eschatological violence. Altogether it would almost seem that there can be no limit to human knowledge save human destructiveness. In this sense man is the master of nature and time is the master of both. Ironically enough it is logos - the very embodiment of man's attempt to build a rational society in which the problems of history shall be eliminated - that seems to push man toward ever greater historical activity and eventually a more serious and more objective escha- tology. Thus the eschatological mythos points to something quite beyond the perspectives of Aquinas or Calvin, Bacon, or Marx, Origen or Tillich. For it, there is no ecclesi- astical and there is no secular and there is no natural order that can escape sin, tra- gedy and judgement. Logos as the very instrument which destroys false mythos and false security, try as they may to make logos their tool, is thus the executor and proof of the eschatological mythos. For what we have really to fear perhaps is not logos itself but the corruption of mythos. In this sense the tension of logos and mythos is nothing but the coming of truth in time.
