PROPP University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 The following study addresses the problem of the sins of Moses and Aaron which exclude them from the promised land (Num 20:1-13). This is hardly the first such attempt;' more apt than ever is the comment of S. D. Luzzato: "Moses our Teacher committed one sin, but the exegetes have loaded upon him thirteen sins and more, since each of them has invented a new sin."'2 The analysis below does not propose a new sin, but supports, with important modifications, the obvious (and traditional) explanation of the sin of Moses, and also accounts for the treatment of Aaron. The persuasiveness of the argument, however, depends upon one's view of the nature of the Priestly source. While my theory is compatible with any of the current versions of the Documentary hypothesis and indeed with the traditional, one-source view, it follows most directly from the following characterization of the tetrateuchal documents. J, E, and P were originally independent manuscripts containing narrative, law, and sundry data. Though the relation of J to E is neither clear nor relevant here, the demonstration by R. E. Friedman that P was composed as a rival and alternative recension to the redacted JE3 is convincing and has the following implications: (1) Despite the havoc redactors may have wrought, we must believe that the original P was basically internally consistent. (2) One must read P without the intervening matter from JE to obtain a sense of its story line.4 This is not the only view of P For a survey of scholarship, see J. Milgrom, "Magic, Monotheism and the Sin of Moses;' in The Quest for the Kingdom of God (Fs. G. E. Mendenhall; ed. H. B. Huffmon, F A. Spina, A. R. W. Green; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1983) 251-65; and M. Margaliot, "Het(') m6ge(h) we'ahair6n beme meriba," Beth Mikra 19 (1974) 374-400. 2 S. D.

For my purposes, the issue of the date of P, which Friedman discusses in detail, is irrelevant. 4 The independence of P as a narrative source is maintained by many besides Friedman; e.g., M. Noth, A History of Pentateuchal Traditions (German original 1948; Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1981) 8-19; K.

(1) The children of Israel, all the community, arrived in the desert of Zin in the first month, and the people settled down in Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. (2) But there was no water for the community, and they gathered against Moses and Aaron. (3) The people strove with Moses and said: "Would that we had perished when our brethren perished before Yahweh. (4) Why did you bring the congregation of Yahweh into this desert to die in it,6 us and our cattle? (5) And why did you take us out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place, which is not a place of seed7 or fig or vine or pomegranate, where there is no water to drink?" (6) Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the opening of the Tent of Assembly and fell on their faces. The Glory of Yahweh appeared to them (7) and Yahweh spoke to Moses as follows: (8) "Take the rod and gather the com- munity, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to8 the crag before their eyes - it will give its water. You will produce for them water from the crag, and you will water the community and its cattle:"' (9) So Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he1' had commanded him, (10) and Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the face of the crag, and he said to them: "Listen," you rebels! From this crag are we to produce water for you?" (11) Moses lifted his hand and struck the crag with the'2 rod twice, and abundant water came forth, and the community and its cattle drank. (12) Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust me13 and sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, you shall not bring this 5 Contrast the conclusion of F M. Cross, "P is not a narrative source" (Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973] 301). 6 LXX translates freely, on the analogy of Exod 17:3, as though the Hebrew were *lhamimt 'dtani (Sam is not rendered). 7 LXX "is not sown. 8 For reasons to be disputed below, Margaliot ("H.t('),' 381) translates wedibbartem 'el- hassela'as "speak about the rock." Milgrom, who claims that the sin of Moses is speaking during the performance of a miracle and thereby implying that he is simply doing a magic trick ("Magic," 259-65), translates 'el-hassela' as "by the rock" ("Magic, 255-56). Both of these renderings, reading 'el as if it were 'al (originally proposed by Nahmanides), are unnecessary- in the vast majority of cases, dibber 'el means "speak to." A further defect of Milgrom's theory is that it requires radical emendation, for he hypothesizes that the verse originally lacked wedibbartem but contained a command to strike the rock which fell out by scribal error because of the repetition of hassela'. J. Koenig, following Nahmanides' line of interpretation, arrives at the unlikely suggestion that there is deliberate ambiguity in Yahweh's use of the preposition, which Moses tragically misinterprets ("Sourciers, thaumaturges et scribes," RHR 164 [1963] 174). 9 On the disagreement of the MT and LXX regarding the number of the verbs in v 8, see n. 25. 10 LXX "Yahweh:' I" LXX adds "to me: 12 So LXX; MT "his" is due to the influence of yeid6 and other factors.

If this is correct, two problems are apparent. (1) Why is he commanded to take the rod, if he is not to use it? (2) What is the sin of Aaron? A third problem is often mentioned, but I think it is not relevant to the secular scholar. That difficulty is whether the deeds of Moses and, afortiori, Aaron merit the punishment they receive. The Bible frequently violates our sense of justice,'6 and the author was faced with the problem of explaining an antecedent tradition, shared with other sources,17 that Moses (and Aaron) died in Transjordan. After all, P may have considered the punishment light; Moses and Aaron could have been incinerated immediately like so many others in the desert period. In a nutshell, P felt that Moses and Aaron must have somehow incurred divine displeasure, but he could not imagine them committing a major sin.'8 Later 14 Or possibly "through them [the waters]." Other Priestly passages referring to this incident are Num 20:24; 27:14; Deut 32:51; and Ps 99:8 also makes tantalizingly brief allusion to sins of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel(!). 15 Signs of Priestly authorship are the terms 'add (vv 2, 8) and gawa' (v 3), the presence of Aaron beside Moses (vv 2, 6, 8, 10, 12), their falling on their faces (cf. Num 14:5; 16:4, 22), the advent of the Glory (cf. Num 14:10; 16:19; 17:7), the stress on the power of the word (cf. Genesis 1), and the importance of sanctification. Moreover, the Tent seems to be in the center of the camp. Virtually all modern commentators see this text as the result of either the amalgamation of several sources or a complex process of literary accretion. See C. H. Cornill, "Beitrhige zur Pentateuchkritik," ZAW 11 (1891) 20-34; G. B. Gray, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Numbers (ICC; Edinburgh: T. &amp; T Clark, 1903) 258-59; G. Holscher, "Zu Num 20:1-13," ZAW 45 (1927) 239-40; Noth, Das vierte Buch Mose: Numeri (ATD 7; G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1966) 127-29 and J. de Vaulx, Les Nombres (SB; Paris: Gabalda, 1972) 223. G. W. Coats (Rebellion in the Wilderness [Nashville: Abingdon, 1968] 71-82) and F Kohata ("Die priesterschriftliche Oberlieferungsgeschichte von Numeri XX 1-13," Annual of the Japanese Biblical Institute 3 [1977] 3-34) maintain that our text is entirely P, but attribute supposed unevenness to preliterary tradition. Margaliot ("H.t('),' 374-400) and P J. Budd (Numbers [Word Bible Commentary 5; Waco, TX: Word, 1984] 216-17) stress rather the lack of unevenness, as would I. The best evidence of conflation is in vv 2-5, yet nothing is actually said twice (except lamd and hazze(h)) in vv 4 and 5. Rather, there is artistry here; the people's complaint moves backward through time -would we had died with Korah, why are we in this desert, why did you bring us out of Egypt at all-while the description of the lack of water grows ever more graphic-no water for people (v 2), none for cattle (v 4), none even for vegetation (v 5)- finishing with "there was no water to drink,' echoing "there was no water for the community" (v 2). As in Exod 17:2-3, also a unified text (E), the effect of growing hysteria is achieved. 16 Reference to 2 Kgs 2:23-24 will suffice. 17 See the observations and speculations of Noth, Pentateuchal Traditions, 32 n. 126. 18 Thus I disagree strongly with the popular "cover-up" theory that Moses' crime has been eliminated by prudish redactors; as Milgrom ("Magic," 252) notes, the Bible is usually (but hardly always) frank about the faults of its heroes.</page><page sequence="4">22 Journal of Biblical Literature exegetical attempts to make the crime fit the punishment have led to the results decried by Luzzato. Why does Yahweh seemingly ensnare Moses by ordering him to bring the rod? Some commentators observe that the rod which Moses takes "from before Yahweh" (v 9) should be Aaron's, which according to P had been deposited in the Tent (Num 17:25-26).19 If P is internally consistent, this must be correct; P replaces the rod of Moses in JE (probably only E) with the rod of Aaron20 and never mentions the former. In the MT, however, v 11 reads: "Moses raised his hand and struck the crag with his rod [bematteh6]:' Under our assumptions, this would have to be a textual error introduced subsequent to the redaction of JE and P; in the combined text, a scribe might naturally have equated this rod with the rod of Moses in Exod 17:1-7 and elsewhere. Therefore, the original reading was *bammatte(h), without the wdiw; in fact, the rod is designated hammatte(h) previously in vv 8, 9. Our emendation receives welcome support from the LXX, which has simply tq rhabdg, "the rod"' Though this much has been noted before, its importance has not been appreciated by modern commentators. The allusion to the presence of Aaron's rod in the Tent recalls the Korah rebellion and its aftermath, which are the preceding narratives in the P source. The perdition of the Israelites "before Yahweh" mentioned in v 3 refers both to the killing of the presumptuous Levites in Num 16:17-19, 35 and to the plague among the Israelites in 17:11-15, 27-28, where the root gw' also occurs and mention is made of approaching the Tent. The Korah episode also provides an adequate explanation of why Moses is commanded to take Aaron's rod. We learn in Num 17:25 that this rod is to be preserved as a sign to potential rebels (bend mern) against Moses, Aaron, and Yahweh; when the people see it they will cease to complain and so be spared the wrath of the deity. Accordingly, in Num 20:8 Yahweh commands Moses to take Aaron's rod as a sign21 to the grumbling Israelites and to bring forth water by speaking to the crag. Instead, Moses voices his doubts of his ability to create water from stone,22 calling the people m6rim (cf. Num 17:25), and he smashes 19 See, e.g., Rashbam (R. Samuel b. Meir) (Miqrd'Ot GCd6l6t [5 vols.; Jerusalem: Pardes, 1955] 4. 257, 259), A. B. Ehrlich, Randglossen zur hebriiischen Bibel (7 vols.; Leipzig, Hinrichs, 1909) 2. 186; de Vaulx, Nombres, 223; G. J. Wenham, Numbers (Tyndale OT Commentaries; Leicester: InterVarsity, 1981) 149. On the deposition of Aaron's rod, see G. J. Wenham, "Aaron's Rod (Num 17 16-28):' ZAW 93 (1981) 280-81. It is appropriate that the budding rod, symbol of fertility, should alleviate the drought of the sterile desert. 20 P mentions the rod of Aaron in Exod 7:8-13, 19; 8:1-2, 12-13; Numbers 17. 21 This same point was made by Rashbam, despite the fact that the MT of Num 20:11 has "his rod." Either Rashbam slipped or he tacitly (and implausibly) took the suffix of matt.hia to refer to Aaron. For the use of a pole as a sign, cf. the use of '6t to denote a military banner in Num 2:2; Ps 74:4; and Lachish Ostracon 4:11 (KAI 194.11). On signs in general, see F J. Helfmeyer, "'Oth:' TDOT 1. 167-88; and M. V. Fox, "The Sign of the Covenant," RB 81 (1974) 557-96. 22 Thus did Moses "speak rashly with his lips" (Ps 106:33) and "not sanctify Yahweh" (Num 20:12; Deut 32:51), forcing Yahweh to "sanctify himself' (Num 20:13) by providing water</page><page sequence="5">Propp: The Rod of Aaron 23 the staff twice23 on the crag, which duly gushes. This is the sin of Moses. What of the role of Aaron, and why is he culpable? Notice the inconsis- tency of the imperatives in v 8 with respect to number: qah, haqhjl, wedibbartem, weh6s*(')ta, w hi qftd.24 Only the third is plural in form; haqhjl, however, must be plural in sense, since the text immediately specifies "you and Aaron your brother" and since v 10 records the command's fulfill- ment "and they gathered:' Qah, however, must be singular; only one of them can physically take the rod, and in fact only Moses does so. The rest of the instructions are harder to interpret. Since w dibbartem, on the one hand, and weh6sj(')td, on the other, are of different number in the MT, they might not refer to the same act; that is, perhaps it is not the speaking that is to produce the water. Accordingly, Margaliot translates wedibbartem 'el-hassela' as "speak about the rock"; the plural is used because Aaron is Moses' interpreter (Exod 4:15-16; 7:1-2). On the other hand, Moses alone is com- manded in the singular to "produce water.., .and water the community,' nevertheless, lest further doubt ensue. The peculiar word order-"From this crag shall we produce water?'"- seems to express incredulity (cf. Gen 4:9; 2 Sam 7:5), as is perceived by Tg. Ps.-J. Num 20:10 (see G. Biename, Mosse et le don de l'eau dans la tradition juive ancienne: targum et midrash [AnBib 98; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1984] 118); the Midrash (Biename, 123-34); A. ibn-Ezra (Miqra 't GMd6l6t [5 vols.; Jerusalem: Vaad Hayshivot Beerets Yisrael, 1979] 4. 94); H.

Lohfink, "Die Ursiinden in der priesterlichen Geschichtserzihlung," in Die Zeit Jesu (Fs. H. Schlier; ed. G. Bornkamm, K. Rahner; Freiburg: Herder, 1970) 55. Lack of confidence in himself and Yahweh is a trait of Moses best attested in E (Exod 3:11; 4:1, 10; 14:15; 17:2; Num 11:21-22), but one certainly appropriate to P's ambivalent attitude toward Moses (see below, n. 27); compare Moses' hesitation in Exod 6:12-13 (P). Though Moses sins in his words as well as in his actions, the fault probably does not lie in the blasphemous use of the plural we" as Milgrom maintains ("Magic;" 257-58), agreeing with several rabbinic commentators. Yahweh's own command wah6sP(')ta indicates that Moses does have the power, so his crime cannot be the claim that he and Aaron (so Milgrom, plausibly) or he and Yahweh together (so, less plausibly, Margaliot, "Het(')," 387-88, and E. Arden, "How Moses Failed God"JBL 76 [1957] 52) possess miraculous power. If the Priestly writer had wanted to make clear that Moses was sinfully claiming the power to work miracles, he ought to have had Yahweh say *wWh6s1(')Pt and had Moses proclaim that he will produce water, rather than ask a question. 23 The reason for the "double stroke" (pa'dmayim, literally) is wholly obscure. Koenig ("Sourciers," 168) proposes that the double stroke emphasizes the sinful act, but there are other possibilities. Perhaps, in the author's mind, one stroke is required to implicate Moses, a second to implicate Aaron. Perhaps it is a gesture to indicate futility; Moses thought that not even two hard strokes would cleave open a spring-how much less the word of his mouth. Perhaps the first stroke did not take effect, since it was not authorized. Perhaps there were two springs. Perhaps pa'dmayim is a glossator's note that Moses twice performs such an act in the Pentateuch. And so forth. 24 LXX has the last two verbs in the plural, which eases difficulties so considerably as to be quite suspect.</page><page sequence="6">24 Journal of Biblical Literature presumably by the method he knows best-that is, striking the rock as in Exod 17:1-7.5 This rendering of 'el-hassela'is unacceptable, for it denies the original independence of Exod 17:1-7 (E) and Num 20:1-13 (P). Wedib- bartem 'el-hassela'... wnadtan memad(y)w has only one natural interpreta- tion: "Speak to the crag so that it will give its water," the sequence of the verbs indicating cause and effect. This is the command that Moses disobeys, but it sheds no light on the sin of Aaron. The peculiar treatment of Aaron in this story, his appearance and disappearance, the changing number of the verbs, can be explained neither by Margaliot's harmonization nor by resort to source division.6 Aaron, though mentioned, simply plays no role, and hence no amount of eisegesis will produce a morally acceptable explanation for his punishment. We must rather look to the author's conflicting motives as moralist, narrator, and polemicist. The problem the Priestly writer faced with Moses, envisioning the hero as having sinned severely enough to have deserved exclusion from Canaan, was even more difficult in the case of Aaron, for our author was always at pains to exalt Aaron, at times at the expense of Moses and the Levites he represents.7 Evidently, he wrote Aaron into the story just enough to implicate him by association. Although Aaron does nothing wrong, the misuse of his own rod by his brother taints him as if by sympathetic magic, and thus Moses causes the death of Aaron. Ironically, P found it easier to show Yahweh acting unjustly (at least from our perspective) than have Aaron commit even a peccadillo. P's program of the exaltation of Aaron and the denigration of Moses brings us to another question: What is the relation of Num 20:1-13 to Exod 17:1-7 in particular and to prior tradition in general? As we have seen, the Priestly writer revised the Massah-Meribah account in order to explain the deaths of Moses and Aaron and to impute sin to the former, but there are many other alterations and "improvements." The plural verb tOna in Exod 17:2 (MT) refers to Moses and Yahweh, but in Num 20:4-5 the plurals refer to Moses and Aaron. P eliminated the anthropomorphism of Exod 17:6, which has Yahweh standing before Moses.8 The intended miracle, speaking to the crag, goes the Exodus account one better, since there is to be no physical contact. The rod of Aaron, though illegitimately used, functions better than Moses, producing not just mayim but mayim rabbim.29 The 25 See above, n. 8. 26 See above, n. 15. 27 See Cross, Canaanite Myth, 198-206; and Friedman, Exile, 92-118 passim. 28 Friedman, Exile, 111-12.

The cattle, mentioned in Exod 17:3 but forgotten in v 6, are remembered in Num 20:11. P also deleted the theme of testing (massd), though it would have been appropriate,30 and changed the si2r to a sela', its poetic alternate?. Finally, P moved the site of the spring of Meribah from Horeb (Exod 17:6)32 to Kadesh;33 this seems to be a makeshift harmonization of conflicting biblical narratives?34 Prior tradition associated the punishment of Moses with the spy story at Kadesh (Deut 1:19-46). Just as P had Aaron suffer for the fault of Moses, so Deuteronomy had Moses suffer for the fault of Israel;35 he, like all his gene- ration, is to wander for forty years and die in the wilderness. The Priestly author removed the punishment of Moses from his spy story, also at Kadesh (Num 13:26), and created a new tale in which Moses is actually at fault. He rewrote the Elohistic Massah-Meribah story, thereby creating an opportunity to tell another story of the wonders of Aaron's rod, but moved the spring to Kadesh. He thus minimized the conflict with D- Moses is still punished at Kadesh-and also brought into harmony the tradition that Israel was pun- ished with wandering in the desert at Meribah (Ps 95:8-11), which had con- tradicted Elohistic and Deuteronomic texts. Note that an additional result of this transfer is that P dealt with the deaths of Miriam, Moses, and Aaron in a single account. Also in contradiction to E, Deut 33:8-11 had told that Yahweh tested the Levites and strove with them at Massah-Meribah, where they were awarded the priesthood, and that P's new version of Meribah describes a test of two Levites and Yahweh's subsequent antagonism to them. 30 The most probable explanation is that, having determined to identify Massah-Meribah with Kadesh, P found himself with one name too many and jettisoned the testing motif. 31 Cf. Deut 32:13; 2 Sam 22:2 (Ps 18:3) etc. 32 Bh. 6reb here is not a gloss; see my Water in the Wilderness (HSM 40; Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1987) 60-61. 33 P uses the compound name Meribath-Kadesh in Num 27:14; Deut 32:51, in which he is followed by Ezek 47:19; 48:28 (LXX). On the etiology of Kadesh hidden in the use of the root qd? in Num 20:12-13 see most recently Budd, Numbers, 219. On the scholarly view that most of the wilderness traditions originally pertained to Kadesh, see P Buis, "Qadesh, un lieu maudit?" VT 24 (1974) 269, and for a rebuttal see Buis (268-85) and R. de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Tsrael (2 vols.; Paris: Lecoffre, 1971-73) 1. 392-97. I share the reservations of Buis and de Vaux, particularly in the case at hand; we hardly expect to find a supposedly archaic Kadesh tradition in a passage that is clearly a polemical rewrite of an older story. 34 One might compare P's makeshift insertion of Joshua into the spy story (see Friedman, Exile, 107) to account for his survival. 35 J. L. McKenzie ("The Historical Prologue of Deuteronomy," in World Congress of Jewish Studies, Fourth [2 vols.; Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish Studies, 1967] 1. 97b) suggests that Moses is at fault in agreeing to send spies rather than trusting Yahweh (Deut 1:22-23), but I think this is unwarranted eisegesis; Moses appears as a paragon of piety in Deut 1:29-33. More likely, D could no more imagine Moses truly sinning than P could Aaron. T W Mann observes that Ps 106:32 seems to harmonize the Priestly and Deuteronomistic explanations of Moses' punishment ("Theological Reflections of the Denial of Moses," JBL 98 [1978] 483 n. 7).</page><page sequence="8">26 Journal of Biblical Literature In sum, the sin of Moses is striking the crag with Aaron's rod and addressing the people instead of displaying the rod and commanding the rock to produce water. I have said that this rod was a monitory sign to the rebellious Israelites. It was also a symbol of the primacy of the tribe of Levi and in particular of the exclusive priesthood of the house of Aaron, which had just been confirmed in the Korah rebellion. In illegitimately employing the rod of Aaron, the Levite Moses disobeyed Yahweh and deserved death. The moral to the Levites of P's day is clear. Aaron, on the other hand, remains almost spotless in Num 20:1-13, for his only sin is his presence?6 36 The reader should consult K. D. Sakenfeld, "Theological and Redactional Problems in Numbers 20.2-13":' in Understanding the Word (Fs. B. W Anderson; ed. J. T Butler, E. W. Conrad, B. C. Ollenburger; JSOT Sup 37; Sheffield: JSOT, 1985) 133-54. This treatment, which reached me too late to be included in my discussion, anticipates some of the points made here.</page></plain_text>
