JUNCTIONS: ON COSMOPOLITANISM AND NOMADISM IN D?AMELA ELTIT'S POR LA PATRIA (1986) AND EL PADRE M?O (1989) Jacqueline Loss University of Texas at Austin The term cosmopolitan has a long and complex history. Although the contemporary r??valua? tion o? cosmopolitan is closely linked to the sociopolitical and cultural mappings of postcolonial subjects, it has not focused specifically on the Latin American context. The present essay provides an outline of recent conversations on this "willfully provocative" term, in order to translate their possibilities for the present examination of late avant-garde writing produced during General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile (Robbins, Secular 182). As novelist, performance artist, and one of the founding members of the grupo Avanzada, a counterinstitutional art movement that emerged in 1977 and disbanded in 1983, Diamela Eltit (b.1949) is a key and, again, highly complex figure (Richard, "Destrucci?n" 85). The attention given to intellectuals' self-fashioning in current discussions of cosmopolitanism make this topic especially useful for deciphering authorial/intellectual positioning in Eltit's narratives, published during a dictatorship (1973-90) that executed approximately three thousand people and tortured or forced into exile tens of thousands more. Drawing mainly on the ideas of James Clifford and Bruce Robbins, I see cosmopolitanism as an umbrella concept that can capture not only the ethics of the intersubjective experience involved in reading Eltit's Por la patria (1986) and El padre m?o (1989), but also the politics of those works' reception both nationally and internationally. My assessment of various other critical approaches is central to engaging degrees of complicity with objects of study and the correspon? ding hierarchies authors and critics establish to codify art's transgressive dimensions. This secon? dary material highlights the difficulties of critiquing art produced in, as Mary Louise Pratt so accurately states, a "culture of fear." The testimonial El padre mio1 begs for laudatory appraisals Generic characterizations, especially, of El padre m?o have been difficult for critics. I assert that, while it is a testimonial, it shares many of the qualities of experimentation that this avant garde writer enacts in her fictional works. However, both the language and ideological framework of El padre m?o contrast with more traditional testimonials. The problems it presents to those classifying it are presented by Richard in "Desecho neobarroco: costra y adornos." She contends: "El padre m?o es un relato al margen, relato del margen, que dise?a un gesto editorial no previsto por las catalogaciones oficiales de la instituci?n literaria y que, al salirse de los formatos estable? cidos, ha sido relativamente desatendido por la cr?tica acad?mica que se ha mostrado m?s bien 24</page><page sequence="2">Jacqueline Loss 25 that, following Eltit's lead in the work's introduction, contain enclosed narratives with the poten? tial to reproduce the monadic structures such nomadic art attempts to transgress. In contrast, the novel Por la patria implements a cosmopolitanism with adequate space for dissenting voices and the capacity for provisional unification. Contemporary cosmopolitan theory holds possibilities for negotiating between distant and up close critical perspectives, a negotiation that I see as a consequence of Eltit's bold and needed attack on identitarian politics. My close readings of the novel and testimonial examine authority and power that, in both texts, are linked to the writer figure's travels into and self-identification with the peripheries. Eltit's approach to defying the ordered worldview imposed by the dictators? hip is based on those excentric peregrinations and corresponds to a rather general philosophic condition called nomadic consciousness, which, according to Rosi Braidotti: "is akin to what Foucault called countermemory; it is a form of resisting assimilation or homologation into domi? nant ways of representing self (25). The nomadic subject continually translates and spends much time in the margins, rejecting the monism of the center. This nomadic consciousness may seem to be at odds with a more traditional imaginary of cosmopolitanism, calling to mind the travels of a somewhat wealthy and cultured individual/gentleman in a world capital or perhaps a bohe mian with less funds in that same locale, but on its outskirts. However, cosmopolitan perspectives often emerge from, or are, at least, seriously invested in the margins. This critical cosmopolita? nism liberates me from the entrapping binary that has, on one side, a defense of identitarian politics, and an unquestioning affirmation of Eltit's nomadic approach, on the other. Cosmos: Making Up Worlds A hasty review of cosmopolitanism might begin with Diogenes of Sinope's misanthropy (for an in-depth study of cosmopolitanism that focuses on the Enlightenment, but also touches on the Ancient Greeks, see Schlereth). Living in a barrel on the streets and in exile, this anticonventio nialist responded to Alexander Great's inquiry into his origins with the following: kosmopolites. Diogenes of Sinope (320 B.C.), the Cynic (kyn meaning dog in Ancient Greek), is as imperative to introducing the components of eccentricity, the margins, and movement into my interpretation of cosmopolitanism, as the vagabond witness of the testimonial El padre m?o is for Eltit's strate? gies of nomadism. The two live on the streets, and thereby, do not conform to societal norms, but both are symbolic embodiments of rich philosophical notions. Some other unavoidable markers are the Enlightenment fraternities' concern with cosmopoli? tan truths, which resulted in ethical systems that, although they strove toward the appreciation of humanity's good, did not always take into account global differences among peoples. While the usage and implications of the cosmopolitan vary dramatically according to diverse contexts, the cosmopolitan realm, remaining faithful to the etymology of the word, has focused on an ideal of desorientada por su po?tica testimonial. Digo 'po?tica testimonial' porque el material discursivo que presenta el libro es un testimonio (la grabaci?n fielmente transcrita y editada de 'un habla encontrada en la ciudad' que identifica a un vagabundo realmente existente) y porque, a la vez, los sobregiros de voz que afectan el material y su presentaci?n desencajan el relato hacia un anti? naturalismo testimonial que retoca y adorna la crisis de habla del vagabundo con las met?foras culturales de un completo arruinamiento del sentido que se extiende, transimb?licamente, al paisaje finisecular. . ." (80-81).</page><page sequence="3">26 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism achieving the status of being a citizen of the world. This ideal has implied, more often than not, a detachment from the national realm (Joseph Stalin's characterization of the Jews of the USSR as "rootless cosmopolitans" would be one well-known and severe example of this criticism). There are, however, innumerable ones in disparate geographical settings that would fit equally well as instances in which this detachment is criticized. One such example in Spanish-American letters would be Jos? Mar?a Arguedas's critique of Julio Cort?zar. Thus, the consequences of this term used as an epithet can vary extensively. During the late 1980s and 1990s a number of researchers began emphasizing distinct aspects o? cosmopolitanism, a term that, because of its weighty inheritance, and timeliness, its durability and malleability, allows for multiple interpretations.2 In the first half of a two-part introduction to Cosmopolitics: Thinbng and Feeling beyond the Nation, Robbins explains a more modest cosmopolitanism at work today that disassociates itself from the elitism entailed in being a world citizen and embraces multiple affiliations.3 Key to Robbins's explicatory definition is the notion that at home and parochial are not a priori synonyms. In nineteenth- and twentieth-century Latin American discourse, cosmopolita and cosmopolitis? mo are frequently used to represent a certain desire to be realized.4 In a colloquial sense, today, cosmopolita and a privileged city dweller are sometimes interchangable, but even this similitude 2Amanda Anderson's essay states clearly an important point concerning cosmopolitanism's multiple interpretations: "[T]he forms of distance from cultural identifications that are advocated within specific cosmopolitanisms can range from the rigorously negative or exclusionary, as in the Stoic position of eschewing petty allegiances in favor of a universal standard, to the expan? sively inclusionary, as in those cosmopolitanisms that promote understanding of many different cultures and experiences. In exclusionary cosmopolitanism, little to no weight is given to explora? tion of disparate cultures: all value lies in an abstract or 'cosmic' universalism. In inclusionary cosmopolitanism, by contrast, universalism finds expression through sympathetic imagination and intercultural exchange. This tension, between bracketing affiliations on the one hand and appreci? ating and sometimes integrating them on the other, appears throughout the history of cosmopoli? tan thought, including its contemporary articulations, which tend to argue for a redefined dialectic between the two" (267-68). Anderson cites McKillop as assisting her articulation of these vari? ants. 3Robbins' comentary in this context is interesting. He states: "But if the nation-state is not the one political unit capable of doing something to control the world market, nor (therefore) the inevitable focus of or best political energies, neither is it cosmopolitanism's proper and inevitable antagonist. Struggles for social justice that simply begin at home, within a given nation-state, do not demand to be described as nationalist or to be dismissed as parochial" (9). One instance of such a struggle might be the Zapatista movement of Chiapas, Mexico, that has extended to Europe and Asia, as well; rather than supporters, people in those other-than -properly-Mexican spaces consider themselves to be Zapatistas. However, movements need not be as obviously translational to be considered cosmopolitan. Brazilian modernist Oswald de Andrade' s "Manifesto Antrop?fago" (May 1,1928) proposed a unique incorporation of the cosmopolitan and the national, inspiring a movement that has perhaps more in common with many of these recent invocations of cosmopolitanism than the more traditional nuances of cosmopolitismo in the Spanish-American context. Also, see Noel Salomen's "Cosmopolitism and Internationalism in the History of Ideas in Latin America (1979)," for a survey of this conceptual term in the Latin American context.</page><page sequence="4">Jacqueline Loss 27 depends on the particular economic and historical circumstances facing a region. Throughout several centuries, for instance, in the writings of Pedro Jos? M?rquez, Rub?n Dar?o, and Jos? Mar?a Arguedas, the term cosmopolita designates alternative, independent models of culture and politics as well as imperial, handed down ones. In "Cosmopolitan or Universal?" of The Modern Culture of Latin America: Society and the Artist (1967), Jean Franco discusses the creative projects of Latin American artists like Borges and Cort?zar to gain access to the cosmopolitan or universal realm. She continually emphasizes that modern Latin American artists signal the "right to participate in Western culture" (196). Franco moves between the terms internationalism and cosmopolitanism without interrogating them directly, although she does intuit the importance of class for cosmopolitan experimentation and eclecticism. Some six years later in "?Cosmopoli? ta? ensayo sobre la cultura moderna en Am?rica Latina de Jean Franco," Esther Cimet, while critiquing Franco's explanations of the cosmopolitan for being vague and aesthetic, asserts the need to connect more concretely the issues of cultural and economic nationalism. More recent studies on cosmopolitanism, crucial for comparing the efficacy of transgressions in El padre m?o and Por la patria, underscore those contexts and material conditions. Through acknowledging that distinct groups across class divides may already be cosmopolitan, these critical cosmopolitanisms draw on actual and not only normative possibilities. Robbins's explana? tion of cosmopolitanism rests on his reversion to the "original" meaning of cosmos,5 that is "order" or "adornment" as in "cosmetics" ("Secular" 188). He then associates the cosmos in cosmopolitanism with the act of making up the world rather than the world itself conceived as a totality. The making-up strategy thus insists on the various parts as much as it does on the totality. Clifford's analysis of the struggle with cosmopolitanism and professionalism that he shares with the objects of his study?the writer and ethnographer ("On Ethnographic Self-Fashioning: Conrad and Malinowki") is a recurring topos for Robbins's studies. Setting off on the premise that to acknowledge the "situatedness" of a "metropolitan" or "cosmopolitan" is not "ipso facto" "self-contradictory," Robbins explains Clifford's two resolutions to the dilemma of professional exclusiveness" (Secular 192). Using Robbins as a background to analyze self-positioning, I deem Por la patria to be more ethically transgressive and effective, in part, since it highlights what El padre m?o obscures, that is, the complex process of creating truths and speaking for others. In 5While Robbins does not mention the Stoics, their worldview is important to keep in mind with regard to the original meaning of "cosmos." For them, cosmopolitanism was a natural ontic and ontological condition based on the following rational principles. Making an epochal move from polytheism to monotheism, the Stoics appropriated the principle anthropomorphic god of the Greeks, Zeus, and imagined him to be a more abstract deity?divine principle. Such a divine principle manifests itself in phenomena, thus creating a web of universal interconnectedness of beings. This universal interconnectedness has its ethical implications as depicted in the Stoics' concept of cosmopolitanism. Copleston explains, "an ethical basis for the Stoic Cosmopolitanism was found in the fundamental instinct or tendency of self-preservation or self-love (oiKStcoaiQ. In the first place, of course, this instinctive tendency to self-preservation shows itself in the form of self-love, i.e. the individual's self-love. But it extends beyond self-love in the narrow sense to embrace all that belongs to the individual, family, friends, fellow-citizens and, finally, the whole of humanity" (400). While it is natural to love those closest more, the ideal is to "love all men as we love ourselves" (400). Thus, it is useful to recall the compatibility of the natural link and the ethical consequences when thinking of the recent variants of cosmopolitanism purporting to be more modest and less normative.</page><page sequence="5">28 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism any speech act, the subject necessarily validates certain experiences at the expense of different ones and implicitly makes decisions about what is said according to the audience at hand. These issues are multiplied with regard to speaking for others. In Clifford's allegorical reading of Conrad, Heart of Darkness becomes an alterna? tive model of writing that is no less professional than Malinowski's professional ethnography. The decisive difference between them is that Conrad includes the experience of fashioning and self-fashioning, the activity of selecting and discar? ding, that is usually suppressed from ethnographic writing. His fiction includes the exclusions. . . that are inevitable in all professional discourse. (Secular 192) Self-consciousness, a narrative technique proper to modernism, lays bare the contrasting elements that go into shaping truths. Robbins appropriates significantly from Clifford's interpretation for his "allegories of vocation:" "The ethnographer lies about his cultural objects, presenting them as more 'local' than they are, in or to make himself a member of the 'local' culture of his fellow professionals" (Secular 193). Alternatively, by making the reader aware of the selection process, Conrad, unlike the ethnographer, deals with the intellectuals' problem with allegiances. Robbins doubts that the Conradian ironic self-consciousness is sufficient means of toiling with the problems associated with placement within a profession, desire for the "purity" of the local, and knowledge of many worldly places. Nonetheless, Robbins argues that the combination of this self-conscious mode, along with the acceptance of a "postcultural" space in which neither the interpreter or interpreted is obstructed by the imagining of a unified culture, provides a plausible strategy for coming to terms with the link between professional and object of analysis. The "postcultural" space to which Clifford refers and toward which Robbins continually gestures is key to understanding Eltit's transgressive fictions. Robbins's description of this space further clarifies the relevance of a particular understanding of the cosmopolitan sphere with regard to her fiction. Instead of a dichotomy of professional describers of culture, on the one hand, and their non-professional objects of description, on the other, Clifford now assumes a "post-cultural" space where the subjects and objects of description are at least potentially reversible, where the mobility required for observation and comparison is not monopolized by one side, where the word "local" has lost much of its contrastive force. His name for this space?a space that is not exclusively profes? sional?is "cosmopolitanism." (193) Analyzing Eltit in the context of, primarily, this version of cosmopolitanism, while keeping the other versions of the polemical conceptual term in mind, offers a distinct framework for exploring several issues, which have begun to be discussed in recent years (there are several critical pieces that help to elucidate Eltit's role as intellectual/describer and her relationship to the described; see Malverde Disselkoen, Neustadt, and Nelly Richard, Residuos y met?foras). Such a "postcultural space" directly informs my interpretation of the role of complicity in Eltit's works, as well as their overall ethics, as will be revealed in the close-readings of them. It is advantageous to consider Eltit as both subject and object of criticism. In the introduction to El padre m?o, Eltit conceives of herself as both?an object, enabled by her local purity to link Chile's vagabonds to international modernism, and a subject, an alternative ethnographer with the mobility to observe and compare. In contrast, Por la patria acknowledges a reversability of both subject and object, which uniquely imbues that novel with an empowering cosmopolitanism. Similarly, the hybrid postmodern subject position, the "body-machine," that is so important to</page><page sequence="6">Jacqueline Loss 29 Franco's analysis of Eltit's novel L?mperica (1983), could be called cosmopolitan in the same sense, in which reversability and the making-up process of the self and world is privileged: Her first novel Lump?rica (1983) is an attempt to constitute a postmodern cons? ciousness; if the novel has any fixed point it is a 'person' in a central square of Santiago whose body reflects a neon sign. It is as if in a world saturated by pr?fa? brication and in the absence of a Cartesian subject, only the body machine esta? blishes disjunction and conjunction with the world. (344)6 Thus the cosmopolitan constitution of the self, in this case, the relation of the body to the sign serves as the only basis for conjoining with the world. The "disjunction," however, is equally important for understanding this cosmopolitan makeup, since it signals the impossibility of penetrating or entertaining absolute solidarities with the world. By resisting conformation to unrealistic binaries of bad universal vs. good particulars, this cosmopolitan position acknowledges the impossibilities of those absolutes and still clears some space to enact change. Cosmopolitanism's investment in intersubjectivity, "planetary expansive ness of subject matter," and "unembarrassed acceptance of professional self-interest" {Secular 181) create a space to negotiate issues of power that globalism and nationalism may be unable to do, since they deal primarily in binaries such as the seer and the seen, the mobile and the fixed, universalism and antiuniversalism. Thus, this more modest cosmopolitanism which may imply, not being there, but speaking about there, is often useful, and is especially so in conside? ring a critical distance with respect to Eltit's narrative ethics and nomadic consciousness. 6I cannot help but be reminded of Donna J. Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" in Franco's usage of the phrase "body machine." Haraway's analysis of organic and cyborg intellectuals enriches the present discussion of the intersubjective experience in Eltit. "American radical feminists . . . have profoundly affected our political imaginations-and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language. They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be under? stood in Sandoval's terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilities inherent in the breakdown of clean distinctions between organism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political 'technological' pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction" (174). While it would be faulty to transfer directly Haraway's myth to the Latin American context without taking into account another tradition of Feminist thought and experience of Modernity, Haraway's myth does salute "pollution" and blending of subject/ object positions that potentially disrupts patriarchy.</page><page sequence="7">30 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism The Formation of Allegiances: Reading Eltit's Nomadic Consciousness The works of Eltit challenge the notion of propriety set forth in both public and private spheres. They reveal the mechanisms of power that function at all levels of society. Rather than operating in the binary sphere the military dictatorship manipulates to its advantage, Eltit's works examine the complexities involved in the construction of self and the execution of power. Taking into account the proposed ideas regarding ironic self-consciousness and the cosmopolitan space, this section compares the relationship between the interlocutor Eltit and the crazy anonymous witness in the testimonial El padre m?o with that among Eltit narrator, Coya/Coa (a writer of testimony among the marginalized), and the female lumpen in Por la patria. By creating a dialogue between the testimonial writer Coya/Coa and the marginalized with whom she inhabits a prison ward, Por la patria makes explicit what El padre m?o only addresses implicitly?those are the complexities of speaking for or on behalf of the other. Por la patria makes explicit the complexities of representation and interpretation, by projecting the negotiation involved in spea? king for others onto the characters. The criticism of Eltit's fiction by Nelly Richard, Jean Franco, Mary Louise Pratt, and Mary Beth Tierney-Tello, the translations of her works into English by Dick Gerdes and Ronald Christ, and her most recent temporary academic posts at Stanford, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins Univer? sities have helped to shape her reputation, making her known primarily within academic circles as one of the most important writers from Latin America today. Coming together in Santiago de Chile during the dictatorship, Eltit and the Grupo Avanzada questioned social and geographic barriers by interrupting public space with nonfigurative artwork and disrupting more traditional linguistic structures with fragmented discourse. One of Eltit's more notable performances was her staging of self-mutilation in front of a brothel, followed by reading her novel Lump?rica within. By reinserting the body into a national discourse that promoted itself through spirituality and other transcendental values, such performative gestures attempted to interrupt the oppressive forces of normalcy imposed by the Chilean dictatorship. While the Left questioned the capacity of the Avanzada to effect societal change because of its refusal to incorporate the masses (the difficult situation regarding the form art takes to make political statements has often resulted in rather superficial divisions such as cosmopolitan/deca? dent/elitist: national/progressive/massive), Richard insists that incorporation merely reproduced the regime's totalizing function. Instead, Richard asserts, the Avanzada's works reveal the power to surmount oppression by reconfiguring art with symbols whose references are multiple, reintro ducing the body into a discursive system that is confounded by it, and by blurring borders between simulacra and the real. Hence a fiction is created with no "corresponding" final interpre? tation. In its place is a kind of aestheticization of the marginalized. In the first issue (1990) of the Revista de Cr?tica Cultural (Santiago de Chile), in addition to casting light on the distinct tactics of the more traditional Left social scientists and the Grupo Avanzada, by describing the first as centripetal and inclusive, and the latter as centrifugal and exclusive, the sociologist Jos? Joaqu?n Brunner helps to carve out such a space from which the Avanzada's alternative cultural praxis can be evaluated effectively: El propio 'pathos' de la situaci?n autoritaria, con sus secuelas represivas, reforzaba esas visiones alternativistas, haciendo virtud de la necesidad. Se lleg? a elogiar los m?rgenes, a identificarse uno con los desterrados y excluidos, a imaginar que la "cultura oficial" pod?a ser atacada, desarticulada y contrarrestada "desde fuera", por obra y gracia de nuevos lenguajes, nuevos contenidos y nuevas instituciones</page><page sequence="8">Jacqueline Loss 31 situadas metaf?ricamente en los extramuros de la ciudad sitiada. Incluso, hab?a una cierta pureza en el no-contaminarse, un excedente de valor simb?lico y prestigio que ven?a de ser aceptado como marginal o excluido. (22) What makes Brunner's approach to explaining culture during dictatorship so sustainable for me is that he is enabled, perhaps by his scientific apparatus, however faulty it may be, to take a certain distance from the particular praxis of the antihegemonical groups, while still recognizing his affiliations, and to thus provide an acceptable apparatus to evaluate their critical maneuvers. Eltit's avant-garde strategies of transgression form unusual pacts among artist, reader, and object of narration that sometimes make it difficult to enter into her texts and maintain any critical distance. One of the words that is used to describe the reader or the spectator of the Avanzada's texts is "accomplice" (Margins and Institutions 31). In order to understand my position as a critic of Eltit's texts which, in turn, have a peculiar relationship to the subaltern object of narration, it is important to think about what it means to participate as an accompli? ce/reader, and how to participate without being regarded as a full-fledged accomplice in the sense that Richard has identified. These questions relate to more general ones concerning the formation of allegiances and the advantages of allowing them to form more freely across borders, whether they be geographically or historically based. These questions regarding Eltit's ideal readers are directly related to the ethics of being the object of representation?the marginalized?in texts whose highly literate form makes an entrance into them as accomplices extremely difficult. So, while Tierney-Tello explains readers' possible dissatisfaction with Eltit's interventions as the consequence of their horizons of expectations still being linked to "great narratives of human redemption" (93) and not the local sphere posited by postmodernism, I propose the following as a counterpoint to her groundbreaking study o? El padre m?o. Eltit's concerns "with the margins of culture, with literature, with a decidedly local sphere of public cultural practices" (93) are also the product of an avant-garde context that is cosmopolitan in its weaving of context and theory. The transgressive tactics of the Grupo Avanzada do not erupt in a vacuum separated from theory, but rather are the products of intellectuals with at least some training in philosophy and poststruc turalism. Taking this link into account, "accomplice" continues to present difficulties. In "Ellipsis and Metaphor," a chapter in Margins and Institutions: Art in Chile since 1973 that discusses the Avanzada's techniques of subversion, Richard states: Under censorship, the various mediations or substitutions used by the artists to transmit information has the effect of stratifying the meaning of the messages: each double or reversible sign contains a series of implicit meanings which are activated by the particular circumstances called for on the part of accomplices. (31) The corresponding endnote from Bernardo Subercaseaux's Notas sobre autoritarismo y lectura explains the term accomplices. This involves the internalisation of an environment, the presence of a reader who is an accomplice and co-author of a reading full of meanings pointing to the wider socio-political context, to the phenomenon of a (self)repression of language and to the historical rupture of 1973. (33) Richard's use o? accomplice as an important term in the phenomenological experience of reading the Avanzada's works reveals how they could result in positive criticism from official critics in the newspaper El Mercurio (Santiago de Chile) at the same time that the artists "were committed to the work of dismantling the discourse of authority" (Margins 24). On an everyday level,</page><page sequence="9">32 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism accomplice means a participant in wrongdoing. In this way, the act of reading becomes a form of wrongdoing and the accomplice enables artistic subversions. According to Richard, the artists were preoccupied with their works being susceptible to the "violence of appropriation." This appropriation took place on both the national and international levels. On the national level, it was usually the result of official critics interpreting and valuing only the safer elements of controversial pieces in order to demonstrate their good taste. Likewise, on the international level, it resulted from a certain kind of intellectual tourism that insisted on seeing Third World art as a fixed category, onto which could be projected preconceived desires (Richard elaborates on the theme of the First World's demands on and desires of the Third World in a well-known essay entitled "Cultural Peripheries"). For instance, the responses to the Chilean artwork displayed at the 1982 Paris Biennale, the first one in ten years to which Chile was unofficially invited, testified to those desires. Richard reports that the international community sought beforehand the testimonial value of the work, but ended up perceiving it as pass? in its imitation of European and American models that had long ago been out-of-fashion. A gap existed between the artists' desire to interrupt models and the international community's understanding ofthat critique (Margins and Institutions 91). Such testimonial value would be difficult to locate, since rather than elicit clear interpretations, these works, using rich metaphor and ellipses, inten? tionally tried to slow down the processes of their absorption, especially by official interpretive communities. Many readers of Eltit's fiction, however, are not insiders. At the same time that Richard and Eltit purport the existence of nomadic consciousness,7 Richard's critique and Eltit's works neces? sitate an insiders' position. These two categories, at first, may seem irreconcilable. The official critics, we are told, can read and omit pernicious contents, while "international readers" must be cautious not to take on "compassion or solidarity" (Margins and Institutions 20). Once again, the Left has criticized the Avanzada's techniques for being too elitist at the same time that Richard has asserted the Avanzada's distance from the Left primarily in terms of the testimonial. North American critic/immigrant Djelal Kadir's response to the predicament of how to interpret Eltit from an unapologetical outsider's position is most interesting. After detailing his various levels of perceived outsider status, he asserts the need to intervene or take a stand regarding worlds that are, essentially speaking, not his. For Kadir those worlds are only other by accident. He concludes his excellent essay on Eltit with the following: "Any reading tinged by the slightest ethical commitment will find an obligation to breach the gap between self and other, between one's own and the other's cultural boundary, not for self-confirmation or for appropriate ends, but out of the necessity to understand and for the genuine sake of solidarity" (201). While I would agree with the necessity of intervention, Kadir, taking an important stance enabled by its cosmopolitan nature, fails to take into account the dimensions of Eltit's confrontational signal, that being a desire for a complicit reader. That signal suggests the impossibility of such a gap between self 7Richard's description of Eltit's travels into and self-identification with the peripheries link both Richard and Eltit to the nomadic consciousness. Here, I am using Rosi Braidotti's terminolo? gy. She states, "I am arguing that the nomadic consciousness is akin to what Foucault called countermemory; it is a form of resisting assimilation or homologation into dominant ways of representing self (25). The nomad is continually translating and spends much time in the mar? gins, rejecting the monism of the center. In this way, it seems to contrast with the more tradition? al associations of the cosmopolitan. However, in Eltit's works, these two terms can coexist, especially using the more recent evaluations of the cosmopolitan.</page><page sequence="10">Jacqueline Loss 33 and other ever being breached fully; perhaps that breach maintains the desire in the reader to continue addressing the formation of solidarities bearing in mind the tenousness of that gap. The interpretation and formation of solidarities are relevant not only with regard to reader and text, but also to author and object of narration. The content of the ramblings of the vagabond/wit? ness el padre m?o includes chains of names, of which el padre m?o is repeated endlessly, as well as talk of complicity, political and financial negotiations, and accusations. However, the content is not as important to understanding Eltit's project as is the erratic style o? el padre mio's speech. The witness referred to as el padre m?o is sacrificed in Eltit's equation of him with Chile in her introduction to the testimonial of the same name. This sacrifice rests on the following statements: Cuando escuch? al Padre M?o, pens?, evoqu? a Beckett, viajando iracundo por las palabras detr?s de una madre recluida y sepultada en la p?gina. Despu?s de Beckett, me surgi? otra imagen. Es Chile pens?, Chile a pedazos. (El padre m?o 17) Such a loss, however, seems part in parcel to the realization of Eltit's nomadic consciousness. This process can be explained with a closer analysis o? el padre m?o's function. The madman's three speeches recorded in 1983, 1984, and 1985, illustrate a breakdown of heroic and linear narrative and correspond to Eltit's critical need for marginalization. Through a peculiar experience of el padre m?o's fragmented and disoriented language, the reader is supposed to recall the experience of the dictatorship not by a unifying act of interpretation or remembering but by the fragmentation of the narrative, a narrative that creates another world with its own defiant logic. An extremely complicitous reader is essential for the understanding of this act of resistance. However, she does not need to be so in the ways the reasons Ariel Dorfman proposes in his discussion of the testimonio in Chile. The reader is not required to understand and accept the socialist position beforehand as the narrators do in their struggle to remember and project a continuous and heroic future. In "C?digo pol?tico y c?digo literario: Testimonio en Chile hoy" Dorfman identifies the slip between ideal and actual readers as follows: Aunque supuestamente el testigo apela al mundo entero (con explicaciones y notas a pie de p?gina para lectores extranjeros) para que el oprobio caiga sobre los 'esbirros', lo cierto es que el verdadero grupo se circunscribe y demarca m?s: se trata de aquellos que est?n convencidos de antemano. (195) Dorfman explains that within the nation the masses would not read testimonios as urgent calls to action. On the international level, their readership is also limited and thus so is their effective? ness as texts capable of enacting change. Regarding these limitations with readership, Timothy Brennan has reasoned in Salman Rushdie and the Third World that such texts do not fit into the magical realism boom on an aesthetic level and therefore this alters their marketing. Owing to these combined forces of taste and publication practices, people who do not already know about human rights abuses would not necessarily encounter the testimonials that document them. As Jorge Narv?ez describes the situation, many testimonials originally published outside of Chile made their way back in through underground channels but had in common this need to speak and transform through an internationalist consciousness. Eltit's ideal reader is equally complicitous, armed with a set of contextual and theoretical tools to apprehend the fragmented discourse. In addition to being familiar with the clues, she must know the model of testimonial that is being reexamined. Therefore that model, like the testimonial that Dorfman mentions, is circumscribed by another kind of "ideological" reader. Rather than one who is convinced beforehand of the need for a precise version of coming to consciousness, Eltit's has a knowledge of the national and international context, literature, and theory.</page><page sequence="11">34 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism Besides resembling the radical theoretical frameworks in Eltit's context of deconstruction and nomadism, the padre m?o's language resonates with that of the national father Pinochet in that they both escape being situated. In "Overwriting Pinochet: undoing the culture of fear in Chile," Pratt describes their /relationship as more than coincidental. "El Padre M?o seems to appropriate the disembodied oratory of the dictatorship and reflect it back in a form that the authorities cannot decipher." His speeches, lacking any teleological aim in themselves, function as mimicry in a text denoted as fiction. With the aid of the complicitous reader who accepts this designated function of otherwise nonsensical language, his speeches succeed in debilitating those of the national father. The speeches acquire their function as testimony of the dictatorship through Eltit's use of citation. For instance, in the introduction, Eltit insists that el padre mio's speeches demand to habitar como testimonio, aunque en rigor su testimonio est? desprovisto de toda informaci?n biogr?fica expl?cita. El mismo lo dice en una de sus partes: "Pero deber?a de servir de testimonio yo. Hospitalario no puedo servir, porque ah? tienen empleada la t?ctica de la complicidad." (17-18) The fact that all of el padre m?o's speeches are out of context enables Elit to justify her own decontextualization. While Pratt's article is useful for contextualizing El padre m?o in a socio literary frame, she stops short of questioning Eltit's treatment of marginality. Pratt discusses the coercion of citizens to abandon whatever did not correspond to their familiar national role in order to maintain a homogeneous and healthy society. In this world in which Pinochet stood in as national father, women were encouraged to stand in their "corresponding" role as mothers and help "defend and transmit spiritual values" of the Western tradition (1). Pratt goes on to say that El padre m?o exemplifies Eltit's commitment to marginality as a critical source of insight. In my mind, commitment does not convey Eltit's complex complicity with theory. Eltit appropriates el padre m?o's lack of situatedness as an icon for her own nomadic consciousness, seemingly the only way of being in a political context that orders all things. While from my position, there is a distance between the artist's position advocating nomadism as an existential consciousness and el padre m?o's experience of it "a la intemperie," such a differentiation does not enter the text's framework. Eltit's testimonial allows no place to foreground such a difference. This neglect of the material conditions of the marginal object of narration, also noted but not evaluated by Tierney-Tello, is sanctioned by Eltit's positioning of herself and others' upholding her as a local intellectual. I am not satisfied with Tierney-Tello's explanation of the effect of unheimlichness (81) provoked in the reader ofElpadre m?o, since it decidedly sets aside important issues regarding complicity between text and reader or witness and reader. Tierney-Tello explains that Eltit's testimonials defy an important premise of the testimonial model, signaled by Doris Sommer, that being a "promise" of "more warmth" for its reader (Tierney-Tello 81). Ultimately, these texts force the reader to encounter an uncomfortable real that not only defies the Utopian desire for an unproblematic representation of the other but also challenges even the recent theoretical and ideological misgivings regarding testimonio and its representational and epistemological possibilities. (81) Tierney-Tello illuminates the limitations of Eltit's project for "transforming hierarchies and the status quo" (93) and the consequent complicity in maintaining the status quo that we, as readers, have. Indeed, as Tierney-Tello mentions, Richard warns against celebrating the difference of the margins ("Cultural Peripheries" 160). However, Tierney-Tello neglects to mention that Richard, a critic and virtual spokesperson for the Chilean avant-garde's "local" tactics, directs that admoni? tion toward the desire of First World literary critics for an a priori category of difference found</page><page sequence="12">Jacqueline Loss 35 in the Third World, useful for postmodern theory, and that Richard would probably exempt Eltit from that categorical warning. While Tierney-Tello's argument is especially astute in its analysis of the relation of these texts to the genre o? testimonio, its emphasis on Eltit's use of the aesthetic for ethical purposes (81), and its discussion of the limits of both her aesthetic/ethical approach to the margins and a more traditional representational program, I remain convinced that it is possible to penetrate the mechanics of complicity, especially in El padre m?o, beyond a recogni? tion of aesthetics' limits. Out of such an examination, emerge some inescapable questions: On what basis does one become Eltit's ideal reader? How can Eltit's representation of her textual and extratextual self, as a participant in a common struggle, be reconciled with her aesthetics of nomadic consciousness and what I refer to here as cosmopolitanism? To what interpretative community must the reader belong in order for El padre m?o to be carried out as a mode of resistance? Tierney-Tello's and Richard's recognition that "Eltit's texts refuse to be fixed and defy an identitarian politics," (Tierney-Tello 81) though generally accurate, evades fundamental issues concerning readership and ethics of narration. It may be, as Alberto Moreiras asserts, that "El padre m?o refuses to be read as an identitarian construction" (218); however, such a refusal is accompanied by Eltit's and Richard's specific strategies for reading the margins that, in order for the avant-garde practices to be effective as resistance, must be heeded. The reader, as Tierney Tello points out, is complicit in terms of accepting the limits of an "unapologetic aestheticization and humanization of previously scorned and dehumanized subjects" (93), but she must also be complicit, on a different level, that is, ready to obliterate the memory of other reading strategies and to adopt the requirements of Eltit's texts, that include a keen familiarity with poststructura lism. Eltit fails to leave the gap between between el padre m?o's loss of all explicit biographical information and his standing in for a powerful poetics of change through language open, going against her own politics of appropriation and thus demonstrating a critical blind spot. With these themes of overly intimate and distant perspectives in mind but lacking the privile? ge of accomplice status (a status whose existence may be accidental and arbitrary), I attempt to take enough space to interpret without closing the gap between self and other. The deficit of biographical information about the witness el padre m?o can be attributed to more than a specific intellectual's nomadic consciousness; it is directly related to formulating strategies of resistance under dictatorship. El padre m?o is composed of ellipsis, a technique suited to the self-censorship Richard describes. Thus el padre's delusional speeches become an adequate mechanism to elude external censorship while criticizing the social system. In an excellent analysis of the relationship between author and object of narration "Esquizo? frenia y literatura: el discurso de padre e hija en El padre m?o de Diamela Eltit," Ivette Malverde Disselkoen explains the significance of the title: ...[D]esde su t?tulo el relato tiene m?ltiples sentidos. "Padre m?o" alude, por una parte, al nombre que en el discurso de la "presentaci?n" Diamela Eltit le otorga al esquizofr?nico, por otra parte, mediante un desplazamiento, ese nombre designa en el discurso del esquizofr?nico a la figura autoritaria en la que convergen los poderes sociales. Mediante la primera denominaci?n puede plantearse que Diamela Eltit se constituye en la figura de una hija que posibilita la emergencia del discur? so del padre que, v?ctima de la sociedad, ha sido marginado e impedido de decir "su verdad"por parte de la figura autoritaria que ha usurpado el poder y ha asumi? do el control social. (70)</page><page sequence="13">36 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism The three tape recordings of the schizophrenic reveal a way of putting meaning together that defies not only the patriarchal logic of the regime. By naming the book El padre m?o, Eltit is enabled to double her existence. As Malverde Disselkoen explains, she is the author as well as the fictional daughter of the schizophrenic. Simply speaking, father engenders daughter, and in the process of daughter enabling father's narrative, daughter achieves her own subjectivity as a marginalized author. In a 1992 interview with Sandra Garabano and Guillermo Garc?a-Corales, Eltit emphasized her rescue of the discourse from the father of min: "me import? rescatar ese discurso del 'padre m?o'" (71). In El padre m?o, el padre, someone who almost achieved autho? rial status, remains an anonymous object of narration. This anonymity is complex?it has both negligent and ethically profound significance. Eltit has inextricably linked interlocutor and subaltern in the title; thus, up until this point in the essay, I have only referred to the witness as el padre m?o. In this link, Eltit foregrounds their relationship?a relationship that determines the ethical imperative of this testimonial. He exists, only in connection to his daughter, a daughter who enables his mad discourse in order to encounter her own transgressive voice. This voice or feminist way of resisting a totalizing masculinist discourse reveals itself in the form of nomadic consciousness. While Eltit briefly comments on his unnamed status with respect to the material conditions of his daily life, this reference is strategic in the creation of an appropriate metaphor for the nation in which both a modernist aesthetic and Eltit, as its practitioner, are central. Unlike in her more obviously fictitious texts such as Por la patria in which the intellectual's own making up process is also emphasized, here all we see is her critique rendering el padre m?o unspecific. "Aterrado en medio de un complot, el poder lo acechaba mort?fero, converti?ndolo en un sujeto que ya se hab?a desprendido de todo, incluso de su nombre propio" (15). In this passage, the interlocutor is likely so aware of her role in the organization of representation and factoring of truth that she does not need to delineate it. While Eltit's disavowal of "identitarian construction" has legitimate goals, it is impossible to ignore the complexity of the object's anonymity. While the interlocutor is concerned with positioning this text in a particular discipline "Desde d?nde recoger esta habla era la pregunta que principalmente me problematizaba" (16), her own introduc? tion establishes herself so firmly within a particular critical discourse of literature that el padre m?o becomes but one more ingredient, however needed. As can be seen from Eltit's introduction, rather than challenging what Richard calls "technical-ethical" discourse and replacing it with a decentered one, substituting scientific discourse for a literary one strengthens what is an unassu? mingly hegemonic intellectual role. Through positioning herself as a local intellectual, Eltit gains credibility to propogate a nomadic consciousness, presenting irreconcilable contradictions. Tactics of transgression, similar to those in El padre m?o, can be found in Por la patria, published three years earlier, also within Chile. As suggested by their titles, Eltit is engaged in interpreting the law of the father in both texts. In Por la patria, Eltit invents a character named Coya/Coa in an effort to explain the history of Chile from the perspective of the marginalized. Coya refers to the wife and older sister of the founding Inca emperor, and Coa to street argot. Like El padre m?o, the author figure travels to the margins of the city, here simultaneously the center of roundups and raids, the barrio Pisagua, to encounter the four female characters, and in particular Coya/Coa who, by virtue, in part, of their marginality, help subvert the patriarchal order. In part one of Por la patria, "La luz, la luz, la luz, la luz del d?a," the characters are primarily in Coya/Coya's family's bar, in a marginalized neighborhood of Santiago; and there they become the victims of several roundups. Coya/Coa's father is disappeared, and her mother departs with a traitor named Juan. Particular dates and places of actual roundups in Chile are</page><page sequence="14">Jacqueline Loss 37 named, such as August 24 and Pisagua. In the second part, "Se funde, se opaca, se yergue la ?pica," Coya/Coa gathers their testimonies and writes their story. The text also suggests circularity since the characters end up, liberated, but back in the bar where it began. An exceptionally literary work,8 consisting of speeches, documents, short plays, and testimo? nies, Por la patria, like Conrad's fiction and Malinowski's diary, lays bare the constructed nature of truths at all levels. Unable to encompass her entire self into either gender ?"No me atrevo a tomar la tercera silla" (15), the narrator/principal character Coya/Coa, incestuous with both parents as her inheritance from Coya may suggest, remains dual and bisexual "..mi hombro fue paterno totalmente masculino cuando porte? la entrada con mi pie femenino, la planta de mi madre me guiaba" (15). Coya/Coa, continually masturbatory as Irigaray has theorized the female sex, is therefore a starting point for a continuous multiplicity of voices that disavows any unified truths. Intercepting a stable, stagnant conception of "identity" with her duality, the result of inheritance and context, "Esa noche de la tragedia, alguien acab? en mi nombre y desde entonces respondo dual y biling?e si me nombran Coa y Coya tambi?n" (22), Coya/Coa represents a cali for a nomadic consciousness that is ethically equipped. Braidotti's appraisal of the term "nomadic consciousness," in which a hybrid female body needs to function as a major determinant in ethical issues, coincides with Eltit's envisioning of Coya/Coa's role. One can trace this trajectory of hybridity, as Franco's commentary suggested, to the interaction between the female subject and neon sign that figures prominently in Lump?rica. While Por la patria does not function linearly, it includes conversions that are momentarily or provisionally linear, allowing for transgressive actions to occur. For instance, after Juan the lover and torturer "sopl?n" declares that he will be her countermemory, disembodied Coya/Coa, "moist and soaking in water," having lost her pubis and flesh (273), delivers a speech regarding memory and forgetting that concludes with "Ser? de vencida en vencedora especie" (275). While there is a sense of progress at the end of the novel, it is disturbed by the reality that these women, though liberated as the result of the speech, all end up back in the bar where the text began. Por la patria acquires its narrative structure, not through traditional techniques, but rather by continuing a pattern utilized in Lump?rica of registering particular spaces in the city in which the psychic reality of characters is examined. A text about writing, Por la patria inserts itself, to the greatest extent, into the genre of testimonial fiction while it subverts it through metatextuality. In "Apuntes sobre la novela Por la patria (1986), de Diamela Eltit" Rodrigo C?novas explains: Estas historias no pretenden ser reales (no son testimonios de personas) sino veros?miles (se simula el g?nero del testimonio, se lo act?a, se transita por ?i)... La categor?a de lo natural aparece sustituida por lo artificioso. La literatura es el espacio de los cuerpos simulados; a nivel discursivo, las historias se retocan, se maquillan. (149). 8In addition to my own evaluation of this work, Eltit in her interview with Fernando Burgos and M. J. Fenwick characterizes the novel in this manner. "Es una novela bastante literaria. Est? engranada m?s que en la vida real en una literatura que hay que hacer. Enfrent? el problema de la madre a trav?s de una representaci?n muy compleja y estereotipada. Es una madre literaria, sin alma. Yo le quit? muchas cosas a esa figura. En el fondo se trataba de la madre que yo necesitaba. Por lo dem?s, quer?a contar m?s que su actividad, quer?a un rol dado por la cultura. Una cultura que dicta una madre que tiene algunas rebeliones" (348).</page><page sequence="15">38 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism However, unlike the situation in El padre m?o where Eltit creates another nonsensical world as hermetically sealed as the one in which the citizens of Chile were forced to live, enclosing a "real" protagonist within, here the artificiality of the text foregrounds the difficulties of bearing witness. By creating another authorial persona Coya/Coa who seeks to "darles voz" (194-95), Eltit can clarify the difficult task of the female intellectual who is compelled to translate the traumatic experience of dictatorship, but is also aware that, in so doing, she may usurp the voices of some of the dictatorship's victims. The complexities of speaking for the marginalized are made apparent throughout the novel. Taking into account the importance of the collective voice for the testimonial project (think of "Mi situaci?n personal engloba toda la realidad de un pueblo" [21], one of the first resolutions in Me llamo Rigoberta Mench? y as? me naci? la conciencia, perhaps the most publicized testi? monio that has recently undergone severe criticism), Por la patria brings to the surface the conflicting voices involved in the construction of that collectivity in the following passage. He inventado un espect?culo de aceptaci?n con la mirada capada. Distante, atacada de una absoluta falta de contacto, temerosa de la oscuridad, escribo: Parlamentos, documentos, manifiestos. Hablo siempre de las cosas nuevas de la infancia, del estilo asombrosamente decadente de la patria. Berta, trabaja infatigable, dejando sobre las hojas la caparaz?n adyacente de su experiencia frustrada, de su ambici?n por el indeleble primer plano. Hubo entre nosotras una discusi?n expl?cita. Cuando se habl? de aquello, mi posici?n categ?rica la inhibi?, le torci? su hege m?nico proceder. ?O te ci?es al plan general o te retiras. As? le dije. ?Las mujeres se van a resistir. ?Las mujeres van a estar felices. Las mujeres ?stas van a delirar de gusto, le rebat?. Va a ser todo una toma colectiva del habla. (199) Here the negotiations in the wielding of power, in general, are made evident by this explicit discussion concerning how to attain so-called collective taking of the speech. The ironic tone of this passage ridicules intellectuals' efforts to project onto others a particular notion of collectivity to which they subscribe, as well as indicates that an affiliation with the masses, regardless of the empathy that it purports, is tenuous, at the least. Eltit's narrative presents a Robbins-like cosmo? politan intersubjective space highlighting not only the selections and omissions endured in crea? ting a collective discourse, but also the need to continue to wield power in the most ethical manner possible in order to enact change. On another level, this simulacrum of a testimonial transgresses the genre of testimony, a genre that for the most part was practiced by exiled men during the years immediately following the 1973 military coup, by embodying the language with female sexuality. Where the issue of collectivity is perhaps most questioned is in the passage in which the narrator/Coya/Coa, desirous and searching for her parents, inscribes on the wall: "Paz y plenitud sobre el antro chileno" (261). Following this figment of liberation, is a disagree? ment regarding meaning. ?Te libraste, supiste hacerlo a tu medida, impresionaste hasta la Rucia que es muy dura. ?Fue algo sincero. Era la ?nica alternativa para nosotras.</page><page sequence="16">Jacqueline Loss 39 ?Para ti querr?s decir. ?Yo soy todas ustedes. ?Mentira, yo soy yo, no m?s. ?Sin m?, hace rato estar?an perdidas. ?Es por ti que nos pasa esto. ?Mujer, est?bamos todas en lo mismo. (262) From this passage emerge the multiple voices forged into the collective voice, and on an extratex tual level, it foregrounds the complicit role of the intellectual, who, in giving voice, will also need to lie or tailor her argument to suit particular purposes. The process by which truths and allegiances are established, on a more general level, empha? sizes an implicit dialogue between intellectual and "lumpen," as well as intellectual and commu? nity of other intellectuals. This interaction opens up Por la patria to readers as a viable text with which to dialogue, a possibility that in El padre m?o is much weaker. However, the reader is required to earn this dialogue. In a conversation with Fernando Burgos and M.J. Fenwick, Eltit has commented on her lack of desire to make this text something that appeals to a public: Creo que Por la patria es mi novela m?s obturada por la recepci?n. Todo lo que yo he escrito tiene una concepci?n restringida, pero dentro de esto, esta novela es la m?s restringida y, sin embargo, es la novela en la que yo m?s escrib?, por decirlo as?, donde m?s despliego un saber literario. (348) While this literariness is apparent, the use of the familiar second-person singular of address, t?, creates a situation in which the audience is never an abstract entity and can enter into a dialogue with the text. Through the combination of this tactic characteristic of testimonials9 and its avant garde metatextuality, Eltit's novel mediates between insiders and outsiders (a division that a valorization of nomadism signals as somewhat arbitrary) to a far greater extent than the her testimonial El padre m?o. These extents of the mediation process cannot be totally ignored. El padre m?o creates a world so hermetically sealed that it deprives the only object that gives the text its existence, el padre, of a biography. Including this ghostwriter in the authorship or some recognition of such a sacrifice would make this outsider more comfortable. However, more importantly than comfort, since I suspect such comfort of interpretation is Eltit's last objective, such inclusions could begin to form a more ethically conscious nomadism. Eltit's lack of self interrogation in the foreword forces the reader into a threateningly singular way of reading, from the author's closeup perspective. Conclusion Both El padre m?o and Por la patria function as extreme acts of transgression during the Pinochet dictatorship. Richard's thought-provoking "Desecho neobarroco: costra y adornos" begins to unravel the structure of the relationship between Eltit, as marginal writer of what Richard considers Eltit's most marginal and unclassifiable text, to the witness in El padre m?o. 9In "Speaking Out Together: Testimonials of Latin American Women" Lynda Mar?n empha? sizes how in testimonies of women "The narrator speaks her story to an actual person, another woman. The audience is never an abstraction. Therefore, Sommer says, the narrative voice sometimes slips into the second person, and as a result each reader becomes the 'you' that addresses the interviewer" (65).</page><page sequence="17">40 Worldly Conjunctions and Disjunctions: On Cosmopolitanism and Nomadism The essay illustrates clearly that the witness's schizophrenia creates a situation in which his statements are beyond truths and falsities, a semantic situation that both Richard's essay and Eltit's text privilege. This notion of being beyond truth and falsities, consequently, places a strain on the text's generic classification, since testimonials, subjective (or intersubjective) as they may be, imply a certain conformation to truth telling of first-hand experience. Richard pinpoints the usefulness ofthat state "beyond" for a critique of humanism, showing how both Eltit and the witness unite to challenge authoritarian control. In this most recent essay, Richard explains the complexities of the "vagabundaje urbano" and "literario." She begins to take a distance from her role as complicit critic in order to demonstrate the complexities of the union of "vagabundaje urbano" and "vagabundaje literario." Rather than focusing on Eltit's lack of self consciousness as an obstacle to conceptualizing the role of the female intellectual, Richard concentrates on the impossibility of redemption or any compensation as a vital point of a text that happens to also have been published at a transition point in Chilean history (by no means am I suggesting that Eltit ought to situate herself or identify herself in a particular manner. However, I do think that, through certain commentaries regarding the process of her trip to the margins, she could have avoided a domination of an intersubjective experience). At such a juncture, the baroque text's residue contrasts with the present-day Chile from which Richard critiques. The following citation from Richard's "Desecho neobarroco," while it refers directly to El padre m?o, captures the most transgressive aspect of both texts. This aspect could be called, as I have done before, a nomadic consciousness, but it also ties in precisely with the "postcultural" cosmopolitan space that Clifford describes. El vagabundaje urbano de El padre m?o deviene as? una met?fora de ciertas formas cr?ticas de "permanecer como residuo que transgreden pasivamente la vocaci?n institucional" (qted from Malverde 158), y el habla delirante de su prota? gonista de los m?rgenes pasa a ser el vector subversivo de una carnavalizaci?n del poder que se consume en el desenfreno verbal. En ambos escenarios contraoficia? les, ?l de la ciudad y ?l de la literatura, hay derroches de fachadas y revestimientos de signos que adornan materias y superficies con su sobrecarga de marcas decora? tivas. Y es este mismo forzamiento est?tico el que convierte el residuo (social) en excedente (literario y cr?tico), es decir, en algo que subvierte la ortodoxia de la racionalidad econ?mica habituada a castigar los desechos por su condici?n de inutilidad e insistencia perversa en "sobras" acumulativas y derivativas... (88) The space that Eltit and the witness cohabit is contaminated. To some degree, I have reexami ned in my analysis of authorship and El padre m?o concerns even more typical testimonials present. As Naomi Lindstrom has signaled in The Social Conscience of Latin American Writing, anonymity and collaboration are typical of testimonials and make them interesting objects of analysis for studies of postmodernism (87-90). Nonetheless, at the same time that El padre m?o lays claim for the notion that anonymity is a postmodern condition to be dealt with, its demands makes for a precise readership. While Por la patria also requires an insiders' perspective, it works through more fully the condition of contamination and the role of the intellectual in speaking for others. After having linked this contamination with the "postcultural" cosmopolitan space discussed in the first section, the essay concludes that a validation of this space, in itself, is insufficient means to attack authoritarian control and still maintain professional integrity. However, it, along with the kind of ironic self-consciousness conveyed in the fictional account Por la patria is effective.</page><page sequence="18">Jacqueline Loss 41 Works Cited Anderson, Amanda.
