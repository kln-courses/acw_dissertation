In the Geometric and early Archaic periods his altars were located on or near mountain summits4 where he was worshipped and special sacrifices were made in the time of drought. A number of l9th century travellers, using Pausanias as a guide to their exploration of the Argolid, men- tioned the existence of such altars on Mt. Arachnaion. They made no attempt to conElrm their existence or to don 1918). The text of the first section of this passage is corrupt. Jones' translation is: "Above Lessa is Mount Arachnaeus, which long ago, in the time of Inachus, was named Sapyselaton. On it are altars to Zeus and Hera. When rain is needed they sacrifice to them here." 3. Merle K. Langdon, "A Sanctuary of Zeus on Mount Hymettos," Hesperia, Supplement XVI (forthcoming) Appendix B. 4. Arthur B.

Arachnaion in the Argeia, Greece David William Rupp Brock University Pausanias {ii.25.10), who traveled extensively in Greece in the Snd century A.C., mentioned the existence of two altars of Zeus and Hera on Mount Arachnaion above the village of Lessa in the Argeia of the Greek Peloponessos. Two travellers in the early 19th century climbed to the saddle between the two peaks of the mountain and saw there a quadrangular enclosure wall of polygonal masonry on a low hill which they assumed to be the site of these altars. Since then this identification has been accepted by most scholars, including J. G. Frazer. Since most altars of Zeus are found on or near the top of the mountains, I climbed the mountain to check this attribution. A section of a crude polygonal retaining wall exists on the hill but no traces of the altars were found. Obsidian bladelets and sherds found on the surface suggest that the wall might mark the location of a farmstead or small settlement dating as early as the Bronze Age. On the summit of the western peak of the mountain two low foundations of rubble masonry and three concentrations of sherds and burnt animal bone fragments in a blackish-brown soil matrix were discovered. One of the foundations must represent the ruins of the chapel of Hagios Elias known once to have stood on the summit. The sherd concentrations, which date from the midith century B.C. through at least the 6th century B.C., must represent remains associated with the altars of Zeus and Hera.</page><page sequence="2">262 The Altars of Zeus and Hera on Mt.

He surmised that this wall was either intended for defense or to serve as the enclosure for the temenos of the altars of Zeus and Hera.6 The latter conclusion was accepted not many years later by E. Curtius who identiEled the wall's con- struction as Cyclopean.7 Ever since then most travellers and scholars interested in this area have accepted this identiElcation without reservation.8 Nevertheless, Pausanias wrote 0x,uoi aE OV FV ab ("on it are altars"), thereby indicating that these altars 5.

Moreover, most of the altars of Zeus of this nature have been found on or near the summit of mountains.9 Therefore, suspicious of the traditional identiElcation, I made two ascents of Mt. Arachnaion. '° General Topography Mt. Arachnaion forms a shallow east-west crescent on the eastern border of the Argeia (FIG. 1). It is divided into two main peaks: the long, lower twin-summitted eastern peak ( 1139 m.) is called either Arna or Mavrovouni, while the higher pointed western peak (1199 m.) is called Hagios Elias (FIG. 2, A). Between the two peaks there is a broad uneven saddle with a small hill near its sw limit (FIG. 2). Immediately below the saddleis southern edge is a cavea-like area (FIGS. 2, B; 3, B) with fertile soil and a spring near its center. Below this area the valley turns into a ravine which runs down to the lower slopes of the mountain. Traces of the an- cient road connecting the northern and southern sides of the mountain via the saddle can still be seen (and used) immediately to the east of the cavea-like area and on the southern edge of the saddle. A modern unim- proved road begins at the top of the cavea, goes over 9. Langdon, op. cit. (in note 3). 10. The Elrst ascent of the Hagios Elias peak was made on November 17, 1973 (a dies mirabilis) in the company of E. Vanderpool and M. Langdon. The second was made on May 25, 1975 in the company of J. and A. Boegehold, J. Camp, F. Stone, and J. MansEleld.</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 3, 1976 263 rlSUlS L. llSldl V1SW U1 611 aSluo ullaw "was ul 1el. lawllllalull from SE. A. Hagios Elias peak; B. "cavea;" C.

Sheer cliffs overlook the cavea from the southern side of the hill. The northern side of the hill rises no more than 2-4 m. above the level of the saddle and it does not form a uniform cliff face. On the northern half of the western side (FIG. 5), the entire northern side, and the northern section of the eastern side, walls made of large and small unhewn and roughly hewn but carefully set stones have been constructed in the gaps in the rock outcropping. The walls now vary in height 1-3 m. and once rose above the level of the top of the hill. The western section of wall is about 40 m. long while the northern section is over 50 m. long, including the section that curves to the east. the saddle, and then down the gently sloping northern valley to the modern village of Arachnaion. The sides of this mountain of hard grey limestone are barren except for patches of holly oak and other hardy shrubs.

Sketch plan of the remains found on the summit of the Hagios Elias peak of Mt. Arachnaion. On the northern side of the hill near the western corner a ramp leads down from an opening in the wall to the saddle floor. Since the walls follow the line of the rock outcropping, they were apparently constructed to strengthen the natural defenses of the site. The top of the hill is level but uneven. The southern half consists of limestone outcroppings and another outcropping is to be found at the NW corner. Behind the sections of wall are accumulations of earth which are used today for small fields of oats. Behind the walls is a light scattering of obsidian bladelets and debitage, and sherds mostly of un- diagnostic plain and coarse ware. Some sherds of Early Helladic (ca. 3200-2000 B.C.), Mycenaean (ca. 1600- 1100 B.C.), Classical (ca. 480-323 B.C.), Roman (ca. 100 B.C.- 500 A.C.) and recent fabrics were also identified. No trace of any type of altar or sacrificial debris was follnd on this site, which must be the one described by de Vaudrimey and Curtius.'2 The location layout, and finds suggest that it is the probable location, from the Bronze Age (ca. 3200-1100 B.C.) onward, of a small village or farming settlement that utilized the fertile soil of the cavea-like area to the south and the grazing lands in the saddle and on the slopes of the mountain. Summit of Hagios Elias Peak On the summit of the peak is a small elongated plateau with a series of level areas at different elevations. A benchmark (BM) marks the highest point of the summit which is almost entirely devoid of earth accumulation and shrubs. A survey of the summit revealed three archaeological and two architectural features (FIG. 6). 12. Puillon-Boblaye, op. cit. (in note 6) and Curtius, op. cit. (in note 7).

The E1rst concentration (FIG. 6) iS about 6 m. to the south of the BM, between the BM and Foun- dation B. Here there is a semicircular area deElned by crude low rubble walls and natural rock outcroppings (FIG. 7). Its southern straight side is formed by a rough terrace wall. This area is ca. 10.50 m. long by ca. 2.50 m. deep. The walls and outcroppings provide a wind- break for the level interior area. Within this area is E1ne dark soil with burnt bone fragments and numerous sherds mainly from open shape vessels: one-handled cups, kylikes, skyphoi, and bowls, dating from the Archaic period (ca. 700-480 B.C.) with an admixture of some Classical (ca. 480-323 B.C.) black-glaze ware. The second concentration (FIG. 6), ca. 20 m. to the SE of the BM and ca. 10 m. to the east of the E1rst concen- tration, is situated on a slight rocky slope and extends almost 4 m. along the slope and ca. 2.5 m. up the slope. Numerous Late Argive Geometric (ca. 750-690 B.C.) sherds and some Protocorinthian (ca. 720-640 B.C.) and Early Argive Archaic (690-650 B.C.) sherds were observed with the same predominance of open shapes. The third concentration (FIG. 6) with a diameter of ca. 2 m. lies ca. 10.25 m. to the NE of the BM. These sherds appear to be mostly Archaic but again with some Classical black-glaze sherds. A thin scattering of sherds was observed over the en- tire summit. Coarse and plain ware sherds predominate. While none of these sherds appeared to be diagnostic of any particular period, some were identiE1able as Classical black-glaze sherds and some were possibly Roman. Fragments of curved terracotta pan and cover tiles were found in the general area of the two foun- dations. All of the above mentioned ceramic evidence suggests a continuous period of use of the summit from the second half of the 8th century through at least the 6th century B.C. with sporadic use probably into the Roman era. 13 13. With the exception of what appears to be a Late Helladic trun- cated conical "button" found on the eastern edge of Sherd Concen- tration No. 2 there are no traces of any early use of this lofty peak. Despite this lack of archaeological evidence, J. H. Quincey has suggested, with reference to Aeschylus' Agamemnon, lines 305-311, that the Hagios Elias peak would be the logical last beacon-site for relaying the signal from Mt. Ida to the palace of the Atreidae at Argos that Priam's citadel had at last fallen (JHS 83 [1963] 129-132). This would indeed make an ideal 6anv)y£inxV ovoza ("lookout- place for the city") as Argos can clearly be seen from this summit as well as the mountains of the Corinthia, the Megarid, and Attica on a clear day. Mycenae cannot be seen as Mt. Zara lies in the way. The suggestion of some that this beacon-site would have been on the eastern peak, Mt. Arna (Frazer, op. cit. [in note 8] 233), does not seem logical as it does not have any special advantages over the higher Figure 7. Sherd Concentration No. 1 from NW. Figure 8. Foundation A from NE.

Its walls are of a construction technique similar to those of the other foundation, although they are executed in a more com- petent fashion with worked faces on the interior and ex- terior vertical faces and on some of the upper faces (FIG. lo). The interior face of the foundation is preserved almost in its entirety. Slightly irregular ashlar blocks were used afit the corners (FIG. 11) The interior area of the- foundation, the center of which lies ca. l m. below the level of the surrounding ground surface, is filled with loose stones. Underneath this fill is what appears to be a layer of tannish earth containing numerous curved terracotta roof-tile fragments.'5 In front of the western end of the foundation a small metal shrine dedicated to Hagios Elias has been erected.

Southern side of Foundation B from west; black line in- dicates exterior face. Interpretation The presence of roof-tile fragments around Founda- tion B and inside it below the layer of stones, its orien- tation, and the metal shrine in front of it suggest that 15. I was unable to determine the approximate date of these roof-tile fragments.</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 3, 1976 267 these are the remains of the chapel of Hagios Elias known to have stood on the mountaintop.'6 Although Foundation B lacks the typical apse at its eastern end, a small niche in the now missing eastern wall might have served the function of the apse.'7 The construction style of the foundation with stones with worked horizontal and vertical faces and irregular ashlar blocks at the corners for squaring and strengthening is common in rural chapel construction after the Roman era. That there are two foundations instead of one is explicable in two ways: 1) Foundation A may be for shelter of some kindiX and B for the chapel; or perhaps 2) the foun- dations are the remains of pre-Roman structures and the chapel was built upon one of them (B). On the one hand, if these foundations are of pre- Roman date, their function is unclear. There are two possible explanations. First, that one (B) or both repre- sent the foundations of naiskoi or small temples; sec- ond, that one or both represent the enclosure walls for open air temenoi ("sanctuaries") of Zeus and Hera with their altars located inside them. These altars could have been either simple ash altars, on or around natural rock platforms, or simple built-altars. The walls could have served as windbreaks as well as delimiting the temenoi. The concentrations of sherds, etc. could then represent the sacred refuse piles which would have resulted from the periodic cleaning of the tenwenoi. But why then no indication of entrances into these areas? On the other hand, Pausanias mentions nothing other than two altars on the mountain top. But his report is not based on per- sonal observation, and so he offers no detailed descrip- tion. However, we know that most mountaintop sanc- tuaries of Zeus do not have any formal architectural elements or plan but consist only of an accumulation of burnt animal bones, ashes, fragments of votive pottery, and earth often found around an outcropping of rock. Naiskoi or small temples are very rare in these moun- taintop sanctuaries'9 and Pausanias' informant(s) surely would not have overlooked these structures if they or 16. Goatherders encountered on both ascents informed us that there were the ruins of an old chapel of Hagios Elias on the summit. No traces of any other structures were observed on the summit. While Cook, op. cit. (in note 4) 163-186, considers that Hagios Elias fol- lowed the worship of Zeus in mountaintop sanctuaries, J.C. Lawson, Modern Creek Folklore and Aneient Creek Religion (Cambridge 1910) 75-77, and M. Hamilton, Creek Saints and their Festivals (London 1910) 19-23, argue that he followed the worship of Helios. Paul W. Wallace, "Hesiod and the Valley of the Muses," CRBS 15 no. 1 (1974) 23-24, agrees with the latter viewpoint. 17. The suggestion was made by E. Vanderpool. 1 8. Idem. 19. Cook, op. cit. (in note 4) 117-123. Figure 11. Irregular ashlar block from SE corner of Foundation B. their ruins had existed. Therefore, the concentrations of sherds, ash and burnt animal bones on the mountaintop (Nos. 1-3) would be the best candidates for the location of the two ash altars. If this is true, then the question arises, which of these concentrations represent the altars of Zeus and Hera? Concentration 2 is situated on a distinct slope immediately below the base of a low outcropping of rock. Thus one has some difficulty ap- proaching it. Concentration 3 is located in a level area, but it is not a large deposit and its sherds appear to be later in date than the other two. On the other hand, the size and extent of Concentration 1, the articulation of its irregular semicircular area by the construction of crude rubble walls in the gaps between the outcrop- pings, suggest to me that the two altars might well have been juxtaposed in this area. One has a clear view to the south of the probable site of ancient Lessa at Kasarma2" and the valley to the south of Mt. Arachnaion. How- ever, if this hypothesis is correct, then the function of the other two concentrations remains unclear. An excavation of these remains is desirable to clarify and possibly solve the problems of the date and func- tion of Foundations A and B and Sherd Concentrations 1-3. What is more, despite the remote location, the small size of the sherd and ash concentrations would allow the material excavated from them to be processed by a small-scale, manual water flotation operation. The analysis of the residue could add to our present scant 20. For the identification of Kasarma with Lessa see Frederick E. Winter, Creek Fortifications (Toronto 1971) s. v. Kasarma, and Frazer, op. cit. (in note 8) 232ff. Tomlinson, op. cit. (in note 8) 42 and notes 37 and 38, suggests that either the site of the Archaic temple at Ayios Adrianos or better the hilltop fortress at Katsingri (see Fig. 1) might be the location of Lessa.</page><page sequence="8">268 The Altars of Zeus and Hera on Mt. A rachnaion/Rupp information concerning sacriElcial practices in moun- taintop sanctuaries with ash altars.2' In any case, the presence of Sherd Concentrations Nos. 1-3 and the lack of any similar remains from the saddle site deElnitely indicate that the altars of Zeus and Hera mentioned by Pausanias were located on the sum- mit of the Hagios Elias peak of Mt. Arachnaion, not in the saddle between it and the Arna peak as was previously thought. 21. In particular, the altar of Zeus Lykaios on Mt. Lykaion in Ar- cadia (see K.
