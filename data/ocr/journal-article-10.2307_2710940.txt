<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Conducted by Theodore Hornberger Toward a New Birth of Freedom SCIENCE IS DIFFICULT AND ITS HISTORY COMPLICATED, BUT IT IS SIMPLER TO describe the advancement of science than to account for the identification of western man with science itself. To account for that identification and to give shape to its meanings is the task of responsible scholarship. Scholars whose first concern is the future of man have no more pressing duty, for it is not two cultures that threaten to divide us. Two visions of man already separate us. Nor is the cleavage one in which science is ranked in opposition to other varieties of knowledge. The cleavage is within science and within what Robert Oppenheimer, somewhat ineptly, has labeled the common understanding. Alfred North Whitehead gave these problems classic dimensions in Science and the Modern World., They are historical, moral and metaphysical. The issues have since been deepened by complexity and intensified by misunderstandings of the uncommon man. Whitehead gently chided his colleagues whose sensitive human minds established that they really had none. This suggested a paradox worthy of study. The paradox remains and has sired others. How could knowledge which emancipated man also limit him? Science, it is felt by some, has enslaved mankind. "The logic and tyranny of progress," writes one perceptive student, "gave to the world the progress of total tyranny." 2 The progress here referred to is the progress of science; tyranny, the sway of mechanism and determinism. If science in truth created the image of a purposeless world of automatic responses and revealed man as the creature of its "forces," the direction of recent scholarship, including science, indicates an altered state of mind. By what historical process did laymen become devotees of the alleged methods of science and custodians of its putative values? What was the nature of the events which conspired to implicate man so irrevocably in the results of science? "Layman" distinguished the man of the middle ages from the clergy; it now distinguishes the untrained man from spe- cialists, usually scientific ones. 1J.

Matson is the more detailed since he strives to assess the growth of the physical sciences in relation to the growth of the sciences of man. The rise and fall of the mechanical view of nature in physical and social science con- stitutes his majestic theme. Little from Descartes to Polyani, especially in the encyclopedic references, is permitted to elude the careful reader. Barzun's approach is also historical but with greater stress on art, litera- ture and the creative life of the spirit. Science as such and its history are pivotal to neither, yet the sweep of scientific developments from the seventeenth century, and particularly from 1750, provides the backdrop for analysis. The specifics in either case are less vital than their symbols; the serried stages of evolution less consequential than their crucial transi- tions. Central are the results and the subtle texture of social and intel- lectual mutation. The delicate balance that Whitehead discerned between a "passionate interest in detailed fact" and an "equal devotion to abstract generalization" no longer exists. The time and the balance are out of joint. A certain verity attaches to older apprehensions. John Donne feared that the philosophy new in his day . . . calls all in doubt, The Element of Fire is quite put out; The sun is lost, and th' earth, and no man's wit Can well direct him where to look for it. 'Tis all in peeces, all cohaerance gone; All just supply, and all Relation.6 Galileo and Newton amplified the fears of those who later gave voice to John Donne's lament. Disciples of the new science ignored earlier sources of "cohaerance" and substituted tight links of mechanical causation. Matter and force, energy and motion thereafter established "all Relation." Darwin followed Newton and supposedly shattered what remained of the 3 Jacques Barzun, Science: The Glorious Entertainment. New York, Harper and Row, 1964, $6.00. Floyd W.

Newton and the Enlightenment, in Carl Becker's compelling phrase, "ravished the eighteenth century";7 the scientists of Darwin's age demolished the nineteenth. The goal of science, declared Thomas Henry Huxley, is to extend "the province of what we call matter and causation, and concomitant banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity."8 Huxley's generation did not quite banish spirit or spontaneity from human thought if only for the reason that they could banish neither from their own. They succeeded in banishing feelings, emotions, values and states of mind from the serious consideration of most scientists by the perilous process of ignoring, rejecting or submerging them. They suc- ceeded in separating further the human mind and the human heart from the life and works of man. They substituted a static fragmentary man for a dynamic personality in the process of becoming. They succeeded, in short, in preparing the contemporary world for the climax of the scientific world view. In Michael Polyani's summation it was a world which made "art an emolient of nerves, morality but a convention, tradi- tion but an inertia, God but a psychological necessity. Then man domi- nates a world in which he himself does not exist." 9 In 1954, a volume on the psychology of politics was dedicated to a youth "in the hope that he will grow up in a society more interested in psychology than in politics." 10 The transformation on one level had run its behavioral course. Psychology in this version was "behavioral science"; politics was manipulation. Man, no longer a subject, had become an object. When man, with the machine as model in society as in physics, became "natural," Darwin and the Queen's English were both violated. Man was then stripped of his humanity and deprived of his heritage. If in the age of hidden persuaders-a perversion both of language and of thought-scholars heralded the demise of "the technologically obsolete paraphernalia of traditional democratic processes,"1 they also heralded the demise of self government. Although less blatantly, they heralded the demise of man. There can be no self government without selves. Except in a society of men who are persons democracy is a contradiction. Unless we can conceive of men who do things to and for themselves rather than as mere items for whom and to whom things are done, there can be no free society and no free government. 7 Quoted ibid., p. 28. 8 Quoted ibid., P. 38. 9 Quoted ibid., p. 126. 10 H.

At times they were not entirely clear. At other times they were as certain as the most aggressive scientists. Regardless of their differences, a common conviction united them. Science-neither its methods nor its splendid results-did not constitute the whole of life. They protested that knowledge of the external world alone did not provide the sole key to understanding or the sole source of joy. To that extent the intellectual trend was mistaken in its emphasis, mischievous in its assumptions and destructive of human values. Such assumptions violated the total past of human history and exchanged one set of human drives and one set of social results for the whole range of human thought and feeling. Critics probed these implications from varied grounds; theology, meta- physics, literature, art. Scholars, questing in every branch of learning with or without scientific credentials, exposed unruly particulars as they erupted everywhere and made havoc of clipped generalization. Before the methodologists of science assayed its multiple methods, it was appar- ent that every induction shared the common fate of statistical probability. Charles Saunders Pierce admonished that the more neatly concepts are formulated, the less they reflect the truth. Louis de Broglie later stressed the need to examine "whether all 'idealizations' are not that much less applicable to reality when they become more complete." "Nothing," he said, "is more misleading than a clear and distinct idea." 12 No induc- tions are insulated from events in time whether they are events called ideas or ideas called discoveries of science or whether they are the ideas devised to explain other occurrences in the changing lives of men. Even the lordly Bacon contributed a note of warning: I foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment . . . then indeed through the pre- mature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things, great dangers may be apprehended from philos- ophies of this kind; against which evil we ought even now to prepare.13 To prove Bacon mistaken would be hard; it would be harder, short of repression, to prepare for the contingencies of innovation. And repres- sion brings contingencies of its own. Freedom to explore, to criticize, to re-evaluate alone afford protection against the premature hurry of the understanding, a guarantee, however, less certain if specialism has indeed become "as much a chance for protected irresponsibility as for scientific 12 Louis de Broglie, The Revolution in Physics (New York, 1953).

I. I. Rabi has reminded us that many have gained the public ear on the basis of prestige acquired through a technical accomplishment quite limited in scope. . . . The fear of being guilty of judgment based on partial knowledge of the facts mis- leads many judicious people into accepting judgments by others whose knowledge is often even more partial.15 Democracy, it cannot too often be stressed, requires the service of experts; it can never wholly depend upon them. The values of a technological civilization, moreover, have enabled men-on all the escalators of life including the escalator of scholarship-to manufacture reputations in- stead of making them. The gradual triumph of science since Bacon has become the major premise of a philosophy; the progressive expansion of deterministic mech- anism a catalytic of social research. Chroniclers of the scientific move- ment have organized a large-scale industry among historians who have recorded the outlines in meticulous detail. Following the Enlightenment, the work of Darwin provides the clue to development. The Darwinian debate established the hegemony of science as a vital institution and clothed scientists with the special authority since augmented and retained. Roughly at the same time, events soldered technology and science to- gether. But the electromagnetic discoveries of Clerk-Maxwell in the 1870s weakened the analogy of machine and cosmos. Magnetism and electricity did not yield to machine analogies and the equations by which Maxwell expressed their relations eluded general understanding. Science gradually became more technical and abstract and the machine became the symbol for science in the popular imagination. The Darwinian debate broadened the base of science; it also narrowed the base of philosophy. The debate widened the arc of understanding; it also widened the arc of misunderstanding. "The modern malaise deep- ening to disease," writes Barzun, "cannot be cured until every man has made up his mind about his mind." 16 Critics of Darwin's partisans diag- nosed the malaise in the mid-nineteenth century, and as the future absorbed the past, it became clear that the diagnosis was correct. The debate provoked by the Origin of Species cannot be contained within the cliches of historians. The notion of a conflict between science and reli- 14 Barzun, p. 27. 15 Quoted ibid., pp. 7-8n. 16 Ibid., p. 293.</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 497 gion obscures the more profound clash between two competing views of the world and of man, a clash as old as humanity and as recent as the sciences of behavior. Irrespective of cultural conditions or the terms of controversy, the issue has always been one between concepts of causal necessity and concepts of individual and cultural freedom. Darwin's contribution to hypotheses of causal mechanism was consid- erable, but is seldom described adequately by historians of science. While the pattern of his direct influence has been mistakenly presented, his collateral influences have usually been misinterpreted. Social Darwinism, for instance, is a misnomer reflective of a shoddy logic and a shoddier scholarship. After more than a hundred years, Darwinism is still stereo- typed as all descent and no man, and evolution conceived as all drift and no mastery. Matson's vignettes of the history of ideas and Barzun's incisive com- mentary cannot be abstracted from the context of argument. Scientific techniques and scientific analogies were increasingly applied to man and society. B. F. Skinner, a behavioral psychologist and author of Walden Two,'7 wished to purge the vocabulary of science of intractable words. Words such as meaning, intent and understanding inhibited research, but even if they were rooted out of the consciousness of history, their refer- ents could not be. In addition, he devised a psychology of control to- gether with a theory of government in which he seemed "to bestow upon the rulers all the rationality . . . denied to the rules." 18 The search for control has a latent anti-democratic tendency which emerges in an effort to establish the controls discovered. The zest to unravel the laws of be- havior seemingly carries with it a zest to enforce them. Extremist claims for the rule of Reason conceal an incipient paternalism. Reason demands a constant balancing with the nature of things. Some things are less subject to control than other things; some can survive only without con- trols. Reason, though one of the stoutest of human reeds, never grows in isolation. When the studies of man became behavioral, language was molded into scientific paradigms and behavioral patterns. Lionel Trilling's par- ody of Romeo and Juliet makes an irresistible point: "their libidinal impulses being reciprocal, they activated their individual erotic drives and integrated them within the same frame of reference." 19 If these scientific words are preferable to Shakespeare's anthropomorphic ones, 17 Walden Two (New York, 1948), a volume of scientific fiction or a utopia based on a version of science.

To stretch such language one scintilla beyond the range of its legitimate purpose is to make a mockery of the most important experi- ences in human life. The result of such a science of man, as Barzun re- marks, is that "the observer is caught in the contradiction . . . which denies man's chief characteristic: articulate consciousness." Leibnitz was probably right after all. To the Lockean formula, nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, Leibnitz added, excipe: nisi ipse intellectus. We may safely reject the "subjective, anthropomorphic, hocus-pocus of mentalism" without accepting the "objective, mechanomorphic, hocus- pocus of physicalism." 20 To generalize the regularities of experience into ideal categories is as natural as it is indispensable. But we are almost never forced to choose between the magic of vagrant intuitions and the alchemy of irrefutable inductions. A distressing tinge of naivete clings to certain unexamined premises of behavioral social science. The historic drive for exactitude, for con- trol and for prediction is understandable, albeit exactitude is often nar- row, ideals of control sometimes fanciful and faith in predictability fre- quently unrestrained. Faith in the unlimited scope of prediction is a form of determinism which discounts the future and commits the historic fallacy. Prejudice is the only warrant for a belief that the science of the future must repeat the patterns of the past. The "passion for unity" which, as William James tells us, "is in some minds insatiate" affords a more convincing explanation of scholarly drives. While dissecting the compulsions of scientists, James anticipated the psychological shock of recognition that followed the disclosure of relativity. The stronghold of the deterministic sentiment is the antipathy to the idea of chance. . . . This notion of alternative possibility. . ., is, after all, only a roundabout name for chance: and chance is something the notion of which no sane mind can for an instant tolerate in the world. What is it, they ask, but barefaced crazy unreason, the negation of intelligibility and law? And if the slightest particle of it exist anywhere, what is to prevent the whole fabric from falling . . . ? 21 The scientific monopoly did not go undisputed. Frenzied humanists, however, were prone to concede too much. To make humanist arts and studies-in other words the oldest and largest segment of the history of mankind-"scientific," constitutes a surrender, not to science, but to 20 Quoted in Matson, p. 107. 21 Barzun, p. 287; Matson, p. 310.</page><page sequence="8">Reviews 499 criticism. To make man a means rather than an end, is a reversal of the obvious. Objectivity, either of the nature of things or of attitudes toward them, is not a quality inherent in observers or in the things observed. It is a quality of the observation after it has been critically examined and evaluated. It is in itself a judgment. Practitioners of behavioral science have created their own postulates and a vocabulary appropriate to their use from which, in Santayana's language, they "have not learned to extricate their affections." Despite minority demurrer and the thrust of humanists, science itself provided the source of the "great transformation." "Only experimental research itself . . .," concludes Werner Heisenberg, "provided the basis for a critical analysis . . . and finally resulted in the dissolution of the rigid frame." 22 The rigid frame or the great machine, as Oppenheimer de- scribed it, was "not only causal and determinate; it was objective in the sense that no human act or intervention qualified its behavior." 23 Quantum physics and atomic research broke up "the stable foundations of physics" and rendered "the old foundations of scientific thought . . . unintelligible." What sense is there, Whitehead asks, in "talking about a mechanical explanation when you do not know what you mean by mechanics?" 24 Heisenberg's principle of indeterminacy and Niels Bohr's principle of complementarity revised the substance of hypotheses and the canons of method. Simultaneous knowledge of position and velocity was unattain- able in microphysics. Nature on this level at least could not be studied without altering it. Einstein's findings of 1905 had already indicated that observation is inseparably linked to the observer, and Heisenberg affirms: We can no longer consider 'in themselves' those buildingstones of mat- ter which we originally held to be the last objective reality. This is so because they defy all forms of objective location in space and time, and since basically it is always our knowledge of these particles alone which we can make the object of science. . . . From the very start we are involved in the argument between nature and man in which science plays only a part, so that the common division of the world into subject and object, inner world and outer world, body and soul, is no longer adequate and leads us into difficulties. Thus even in science the object of research is no longer nature itself, but man's investigation of nature. Here, again, man confronts himself alone.25 22 Werner Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (New York, 1958), p. 198.

The decision, as between a causal and a statistical view of the world, has fallen in favour of statistics.26 Percy Bridgman is even more emphatic: It is a commonplace that we can never know anything about anything without getting into some sort of connection with it, either direct or indirect. . . This means that no knowledge of any physical property or even mere existence is possible without interaction.27 Bohr's principle became an "evocative analogy" 28 for the study of human experience. Those who studied man could escape it no more than those who studied nature. The evocative analogy has led to fresh insights, new appraisals and new departures in all branches of learning. Bohr's principle-and Einstein's and Heisenberg's as well-have led students of man back to the "ancestral vision" and forward to revisionary analyses of mind, self and society. Research has rediscovered the personality, the ego and the human identity. Together they promise a new birth of free- dom for man and for scholarship. If man did not have a mind, a con- science and a personality, he would have been forced to invent them.
