<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST FRANK TALMAGE University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada THE increasing interest of recent years in the relationship between mediaeval Judaism and Christianity in general and in Jewish Christian religious polemics in particular prompts this study of one of the best known and one of the most influential of the polemicists, Rabbi David Kimhi (1160?-1235?). His anti-Christian material was easily accessible to readers of Hebrew since it was included in his biblical commentaries which were among the most popular ever written. No better testimony to Kimhi's importance as a polemicist can be found than the frequent refutation of his words by such Chris tian divines as Gerard Genebrard (d. 1597), Johann Hilpert (d. 1680), Jacob Rhenferd (d. 1712), and Johann Schudt (d. 1722).1 His com mentaries were deemed worthy of censorship beginning with the act of the Mantua commission of 1581 which expurgated the commentaries of R. Solomon and Chimi and Rabbi Hiero solymitano to the Old Testament, both the Hebrew and Latin translation of Conrad Pellican and Paul Fugius, heretics; in these works are contained things contrary to our faith, espe cially in regard to the prophets.2 Our author merited special denunciation by Bernard Gui for the fact that in his glosses to the Psalms "much is contained against Christ and Christians and those who hold the faith of Christ."3 Even the heretic Servetus cried : I am unable to restrain myself from tears when I see the replies which are made concerning [the Trinity] by Rabbi Kimhi against the Christians. For I see the absurd reasons with which they combat him and I cannot but choose to weep.4 1 L. I.

Marmorstein has been shown to be spurious.7 The Replies Replies of Rabbi David Kimhi to the Christians (Teshuvoth ha-RaDaQ la-nozrim),la-nozrim), first printed in the Sefer ha-nizahon of Rabbi Yom Tov Lippmann Miillhausen8 is a collection of remarks culled from Kimfii's commentary to the Psalms. It was the very fact that Kimhi expressed his disputational ma terial in the commentaries which secured his reputation as a defender of the Jewish faith. There is very little in this material which is origi nal and which did not appear previously in the writings of his father Joseph Kimfii9 or of David Kimhi's older contemporary Jacob ben Reuben.10 However, the presence of this material in one of the most 5 These include: Isa. 7:14 f., ch. 53 end; Ezek. 44:2, Mic. 5:1, Ps. 2:7 (cf.

Chapter III of the work (63-76) which is concerned with the Book of Psalms con tains a number of arguments similar to those found in Kimhi's Psalms commentary. Several other problems dealt with by Kimhi are found in Jacob ben Reuben: the concern with Christian allegory (25 et seq.), the meaning of the name Ephraim (53), the corruption of the scriptural text (62), and the idolatrous nature of Christianity (100).</page><page sequence="3">[3] R. DAVID KIM HI AS POLEMICIST 215 popular biblical commentaries ever written11 ensured its availability and currency. For while biblical commentaries had long served as vehicles for polemics, especially in the Franco-German school,12 they neither attained the currency of those of Kimfii nor contained as much disputational material. The remarks, so arranged, were a convenient source of material for religious debates (li-teshuvath ha-minim). The Jew, confronted with a christological interpretation of a biblical passage, needed only turn to that passage in his commentary for a refutation. That Kimhi's comments were intended to serve as such a compendium can be seen from such statements as the following: "I have taught you what you must answer them on this psalm. Now add to it from your own knowledge . . ." and "and I dilated upon this for you so that you might find an answer to the Christians."13 Methodology In demonstrating the inapplicability of christological interpretations of particular verses, Kimhi employed five types of arguments in which he attempted to show that: (1) the context of the passage disproves such an interpretation; (2) the biblical text has been cor rupted by the Christians; (3) the interpretation leads to a dilemma; (4) allegorical interpretation is untenable in the particular instance; (5) the doctrine propounded is irrational. (1) The technique of disproving an interpretation by showing that it is ill-suited to the context'4 was applied by Kimhi to Ezekiel 44:2. Christian tradition understood this passage as referring to the Virgin Mary.'5 Commenting on this, our author wrote: 11 L.

I., PL XXV, 430.</page><page sequence="4">216 FRANK TALMAGE [4] As to what they say concerning this verse, it is clear that it speaks of the Temple and its gates and of nothing else. All the verses before it and after it refute them as any intelligent person can see. I need not therefore take up time refuting them. Similarly, the "sign" mentioned in Isaiah 7:14 was understood by Christians to refer to Jesus.16 Kimhi commented: The context refutes their words explicitly for Ahaz was afraid that these two kings (Rezin and Pekah ben Remaliah) might take Jerusalem. [God] therefore gave him a sign so that he might have faith that they would not do so. If this sign was Jesus as they say, what meaning did this have for Ahaz? How could he be en couraged by something which did not happen in his own time and was not to come for another four hundred years?17 (2) The second point of departure was the indication that the Christians had misread or mistranslated the Hebrew text. This charge was an old and familiar one which originated from both sides in the Jewish-Christian controversy.18 He thus pointed out that the word ka-^ari (like a lion) of Psalm 22:17 was interpreted by the Vulgate as a verbal form from the root kry (foderunt) in order to support a christological interpretation, so that the verse reads "they have pierced my hands and my feet." In Psalm 110:1, the masoretic text reads Dadoni (my lord) with a hiriq under the nun. The Vulgate reads the word as if it were written with a patafy (Domino meo), thus rendering "the word of the Lord to my Lord" in support of a plural Godhead. Similarly in the third verse of the same psalm, the Vulgate reads the word camkha (Thy people) with a hiriq (cimkha, Tecum) so as to render "the dominion is with Thee" in supposed allusion to Jesus. Again, at Psalm 2:6, there is a comment discussing how the term malki (my king) may be understood as either an objective genitive meaning "he who is king over me" or as a subjective genitive: "he whom I have made king." The second meaning is that adopted by the Vulgate in support of a christological interpretation19 and consequently Kimhi stressed that the first is correct. A locus classicus of this problem is Isaiah 2:22. St. Jerome accused the Jews of misinterpreting the verse and claimed that while they 1C Cf. B.

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 217 agree with the Christians that it refers to Jesus, they read ba-meh (in(in quo) instead of bamah (reputatus). He bemoaned the fact that the Jews "who understand the prophecy to be of Christ interpret the ambiguous term in the last part so that it appears not to praise Christ but to consider Him as nothing."20 Kimhi did not fail to react to this tradition: There is also an allusion to Christianity in this verse, i. e., that they (the Christians) will abjure their faith and say to each other: 'Desist from this man whom you have worshipped until now for you have served a man and not God as you thought but breath was in his nostrils, so little was he to be considered. As might be expected, our author reacted too to the notorious interpretation of the word calmah (Vulgate: virgo) in Isaiah 7:14 both in his commentary and in the Book of Roots (s. v. clm). (3) A third gambit for Kimhi was the examination of certain biblical passages which were said to have been fulfilled by the advent of Jesus, and the attempt to show that, whether the verse be under stood literally or figuratively, the interpretation does not hold. This method of proving that any position an opponent took was un tenable was rather common in polemical literature of the period.21 For example, in connection with Psalm 21:5, "He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest it him; even length of days for ever and ever," Kimhi wrote : [Scripture] says "He asked life of thee." If it is to be taken to refer to [Jesus'] humanity, he cannot be said to have lived long. If to his divinity, why did Scripture say "Thou gavest it him." It says further (v. 6) "His glory is great through Thy salvation." If so, he is not divine. If it refers to his humanity, [he had no glory] for he was belittled and scorned. "For the king trusteth in the Lord" (v. 8). If it refers to his divinity, he should have no need to trust in another, and he should have no need for the mercy of the Most High that "he shall not be moved" (ibid.). If it refers to his humanity, he was certainly moved in downfall. The entire psalm is to be interpreted similarly. Again, in reference to the verse "My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:2), Kimhi wrote: 20 PL XXIV, 56. "Intelligentes ergo Judaei prophetiam esse de Christo, verbum ambiguum in deteriorem partem interpretati sunt, ut videretur, non laudare Christum, sed nihili pendere." Jerome, with Aquila, read bmh with undagheshed mem,mem, causing the change in vocalization. "" Cf. S. Baron, Social and Religious History of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1965), IX, 115; L. I. Newman, Jewish Influence, 162.</page><page sequence="6">[6] 218 FRANK TALMAGE I ask you then. Did he pray for the salvation of his flesh or of his divinity? If you say his flesh, then his prayer did no good. If his divinity, the Divinity needs no salvation. In Psalm 87:5, Kimhi asked how the phrase "He doth establish her (Jerusalem)" can refer to Jesus. He surely did little in the ter restrial Jerusalem and, since the rest of the psalm has been taken in a literal sense, one cannot speak here of the spiritual Jerusalem. We have indeed seen how Kimhi demands interpretation according to context and consequently he berated the inconsistency (poscim cal shteshte ha-secipim) of the Christian interpreters." (4) Kimhi's attack on the alleged inconstancy of Christian biblical interpretation had particular reference to the allegorical mode of interpretation which had come to be the central characteristic of Christian exegesis in Jewish eyes. From the patristic period on, "the Jewish-Christian scriptural controversy might often appear as the conflict between two methods of exegesis, the allegorical and the literal.literal."23 Thus a passage was judged to have both a literal (gufanith, corporealiter)corporealiter) and a spiritual (ruhanith, spiritualiter) interpretation. True, many Jewish exegetes and thinkers, Kimlji among them,24 dis tinguished in this period at least two levels of interpretation, an exoteric (nigleh) and an esoteric (nistar). There was, however, a basic difference in Jewish and Christian attitudes. The former considered both levels to be equally legitimate. For the latter, the situation was more complex. The Church had to come to grips with the problem of a Law which it recognized as valid in the past but as abrogated " Cf. Isa. 53; Pss. 2, 7, 8, 22:2, 72. « M. Simon, Ver us Israel, 181. Cf. B.

Ibn Ezra referred to "the way of the Christians who say that the whole Torah consists of riddles and parables including everything in Genesis together with the true precepts and statutes." (Int. to Pent. Comm.) R. Joseph Bekor Shor in his commentary to Num. 12:7 remarked that the "Chris tians say that the words of our master Moses are alegoria, i. e., riddle and parable (hidah(hidah u-mashal) and they take it completely out of its literal sense."

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 219 in the letter with the advent of the Messiah.25 The "spiritual" mode of interpretation prepared the way not only for christological inter pretations, but indeed for the rejection of the Pentateuch as a code of law in the face of the new dispensation. One of the favorite proof texts of the Christians to show that the Old Law had been super seded was the "new covenant" passage of Jeremiah 31:31. In response to this, Kimtii affirmed that the "new covenant" there promised is not at all a new dispensation but an affirmation of the old. He thereby took issue with those Christians26 who say that the Torah given at Mount Sinai was valid only until the advent of Jesus for until his time it was [to be taken] liter ally (gufanith) and when he came, he commanded that [it be taken] allegorically (ruhanith). Their words are wind and vanity, for the commandments which they say are allegory and not to be taken literally were specifically commanded by God ... If the commandments were allegorical, [their intent] would be un certain and everyone would be of a different opinion concerning them. Scripture says, "for this commandment which I com mand thee this day, it is not too hard for thee neither is it far off" (Deut. 30:11). If the commandments were hidden and not to be taken literally, they would be too hard and far off.2' Yet, on the other hand, on one issue Kimhi accused Christianity in its turn of literalism, and indeed of gross anthropomorphism, in its speaking of God the Son. Tell them that we can speak of God only metaphorically. Thus such terms as the "mouth of God," the "eyes of God," and the "ears of God" are metaphors. Similarly it is a metaphor when we say "son of God" [or] "sons of God" for whoever per forms His command and mission is called "son," for the son performs the command of his father. Therefore, the stars are called "sons of God" as "and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). Man [is similarly called "son of God"] because of the supernal gift within him. When man performs the com 25 There were many shades of opinion, even within orthodox Christianity, con cerning the status of the Law before the new dispensation. Cf. M.

Thus it is said, "Thou art My son, this day have I begotten thee" (Psalm 2:7), "Israel, is My son, My first born" (Exod. 4:22), etc.28 Similar arguments were to be found not only in Jewish literature but also in that of the Cathari and other Christian dissidents.29 (5) Kimhi felt, as did others of his contemporary coreligionists,30 that the dogmas and tenets of Christianity gave it the character of an irrational religion. With respect to this religion and its doctrines, Kimhi cried openly, "let the blind open their eyes and say 'Our fathers bequeathed to us falsehood, vanity, and of no avail.' "3I Consequently, R. David made some use of strictly rational argu ments concerning Christian dogma after the example of his prede cessors, R. Joseph Kimhi and R. Jacob ben Reuben.32 The very verse which [the Christians] bring as a proof-text and a support for their error is their own stumbling block. This verse is "The Lord said unto me 'Thou art My son.' " (Psalms 2:7) When they tell you that he was the son of God, tell them that it is impossible to say that the horse is the son of Reuben. If so, he to whom God says "Thou art My son" must be of Him and divine like Him. Scripture further says "this day have I begotten thee" (ibid.) and the procreated is of the same species as the procréât or. Tell them that there can be no father and son in the Divinity, for the Divinity is indivisible and is one in every aspect of unity unlike matter which is divisible. Tell them further that a father precedes a son in time and a son is born through the agency of a father. Now even though the terms "father" and "son" imply each other, ... he who is called the father must undoubtedly be prior in time. Therefore, with reference to this God whom you call Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that part which you call Father must be prior to that which you call Son, for if they were always coexistent, they would have to be called twin brothers . . .33 In concluding this discussion of Kimhi's methodology, it would be well to mention that in general there has been a tendency in recent scholarship, and especially in Rashi studies, to exaggerate the in 28 Ps. 2 end.

According to this mode of thinking, a non-messianic interpretation of a passage is necessarily motivated by the desire to reject any possible christological treat ment of that passage.34 More plausible is the thinking of Y. F. Baer and others that such interpretations may have been prompted by other considerations.33 This can be demonstrated with reference to Kimhi by observing that a number of so-called christological passages were taken by him to refer to the Messiah even though this interpretation might have been avoided by other exegetes. For example, one of the "servant" passages in Isaiah (42:1-4) is referred by Kimhi to the Messiah,36 although the others are not, as a result of the fact that this passage follows 41:25 ff. which must refer to the future, for "my father of blessed memory interpreted this section with reference to the Messiah since it says 'I have roused up' and it does not say whom until it says 'behold My servant, whom I uphold' (42:1) and this is correct." Certain passages which Kimhi himself defended against chris tological interpretations were taken by him to refer to the Messiah. Concerning the moshel of Micah 5:1 whom Kimhi understands as the Messiah, he wrote: There is a refutation [of the claim that this refers to Jesus.] He did not govern Israel but they governed him. It is false that the phrase "whose goings forth are from of old, from ancient days" refers to him for [they claim that he is God] and God existed before ancient days since he is eternal without beginning. In these passages then, Kimhi, without denying the messianic reference, showed that any allusion to the Christian Messiah is out of 34 See especially the note of Y. L. Maimon to J. Shor, "Meqor Hayyim" in Y. L. Maimon (ed.), Sefer Rashi (Jerusalem, 1955-6), 457 f., n. 6; J. Rosenthal in S. Federbusch, Rashi (New York, 1957-8), 55. Several interpretations of Kimbi can possibly but not certainly be ascribed to a polemical motive. Cf. the comments to Zech. 10:12 where it is denied that the object of mourning is Messiah ben Joseph; Ps. 7:1 where almost complete unanimity of the commentators with respect to the non-messianic interpretation of the psalm is established; Isa. 7:14 where the "son" is taken to be the son of Ahaz and not of the prophet. See H. Hailprin, Rashi and and the Christian Scholars (Pittsburgh, 1963), 166; B. Netanyahu, Don Isaac AbravanelAbravanel (Philadelphia, 1953), 206. 35 Y. F. Baer in Maimon, Sefer Rashi, 495: "Since he did not intend to explain isolated verses but entire books ... he would reject messianic interpretations in other chapters not always out of particular exegetical and apologetic considéra tions .... but out of his understanding of the structure of the entire book." Cf. Hailprin, Rashi, 33. 36 Rashi referred it to Israel, Ibn Ezra to the prophet.</page><page sequence="10">[10] 222 FRANK TALMAGE the question.37 An even clearer indication is his remarks at the end of Psalm 45 in which he had to defend himself both against Jewish interpreters who rejected a messianic interpretation and Christian exegetes who introduced a christological interpretation.38 VerasVerasVeras Israel Less obvious but perhaps more significant than the formal arguments to be found in the commentaries is the undercurrent of concern about the status of Jew and Gentile in the divine economy. The question of which of the two is the true Israel, i. e., the people of God, loomed large in the Jewish-Christian debate from the time of St. Paul. As Professor M. Simon has remarked: For Christianity, it was not only a question of defining its originality, but indeed of demonstrating its legitimacy and the fall of the rival religion, ft was a matter of ousting Israel from its place and installing itself henceforth as the sole depository of revelation. Conversely, Judaism had to work at refuting the polemical and doctrinal pronouncements of the Church and the latter's interpretation of Scripture by demonstrating the eter nity of the covenant between God and His people and the ex cesses of the Christian innovations. Each religion contested the right of the other to exist. In the eyes of the Jews, Christianity was a usurpation; for Christians, Judaism represented the sur vival of a by-gone era.39 In one aspect of this debate, Christians, in the role of the New Israel, frequently claimed that name or indeed other appellations of the Jewish people as their own. On occasion, certain Christian scholars might deny that such names had ever properly belonged to the Jewish people.40 Christian derashoth of such Hebrew names were used to sup " Cf. Ps. 21:1 and Ps. 45. 38 Kimhi was especially careful in assigning the time to which a particular prophecy refers by examining the conditions which a verse or section fulfills. On Zech. 11:7, he commented: "First I will explain this section (parashah) according to those who interpret it as referring to the past even though I did not find that any of them had a complete interpretation . . . then I shall explain it according to what I find...." Cf. Isa. 2:9, 4:1 f., 24:13, 33:24, 66:17; Zech. 2:14, 8:2, 8:12, 8:198:19 f., 9:4, 10:12; Ps. 137:7. If necessary, he would admit his uncertainty as to the reference (Zeph. 2:19; Zech. 5:2) while he might, on the other hand, give the verse a double reference (Isa. 4:1 f., 43:5 f.). נ» M. Simon, Verus Israel, 165. Cf. Blumenkranz, Juifs et Chrétiens, 272 ff. 4° Augustine claimed that the Jews are the scriptural Edomites, while Eusebius</page><page sequence="11">[11] R. DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 223 port their arguments. Thus we are told in a twelfth century source that "they are called Jews (yehudim) because they recognize (modim) and confess (mithwadim) before the priest..." and that "they are Ephraim since they have multiplied and increased (paru we-ravu)."41 One finds a great concern in Kimlji's commentaries with such names. "Jeshurun," he writes, "is known to be Israel and they are so called because they are upright (yashar) among the nations."42 The kings of Judah are called the kings of Israel since "Judah is in eluded in Israel."43 It is further stressed that the seed of Abraham and the seed of Israel are one and the same.44 Kimlii's frequent rejection of derashot which provide etymologies of biblical names may well be part of a reaction to the Christian usage. He tells us, for example, that "there are many derashot of these names. Were we to expound them all no book could contain them.

"For since He gave [the Land of Israel] to Abraham and his sons, His truth is to maintain that gift. . . for He is a God of truth and His good word will not be turned back."48 Like Rashi in in the remark which opens his Pentateuch commentary, Kimbi stressed that "the earth is the Lord's . . . and He takes from one and gives to the other."49 The Canaanites were only placed there to pre pare the land for Israel.50 That the Jews were destined to possess the land may be seen from the fact that God placed his fear on the in habitants of the Land so that Abraham could freely pass through.51 The Jews will indeed repossess the Land of Israel even though "today it is as if it is closed to them . . . , for they kept the religion of God in the Exile and did not worship idolatry."52 This indeed is the real test by which to determine who is deserv ing of the title Israel. Not only in the present period of the Exile did the Jews serve God but "all the days of Joshua and in the days of the J udges . . . and of Samuel. . . , David and Solomon . . . and the rest of the kings who were good. No other people ever served the Lord together."55 Christians, on the other hand, do not serve the Lord in truth. As did his master Maimonides, Kimlti stated openly and bluntly that "the Christians are to be considered idolators for they bow down to worship the image of Jesus of Nazareth"54 together with "the cross (shethi(shethi wa-zerev) of silver and gold."55 However, where Maimonides tempered his remarks with words favorable to Christianity,56 Kimhi was silent with the exception of an oblique remark to the effect that 88 Mic. 7:20.

As if to refute the Christian claim of their adoption as the New Israel, Kimhi demonstrated that certain promises made to the Jews were not wholly fulfilled in the past and must therefore be reapplied to the future. (Isa. 15:18, Hos. 12:3 f., Ps. 136:19). He takes issue with the author of Targum Jonathan who translated a certain prophecy (Isa. 52:12 —■ not in the standard editions) with reference to the past instead of the future. His widely quoted rule —- "Perfect instead of imperfect and there are many instances of this. It is common in prophecy since even though the prophecy refers to the future, it is as if it were already ful filled" — seems to stress this point. (Hab. 3:13. Cf.

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 225 the sages of the gentiles are too sophisticated to believe that the idols themselves are gods even though the masses believe so.57 Just as the Jew has a purer relationship with the Creator, he is characterized by his upright behavior toward his fellow man. Both Jews and Christians sought proof for the validity of their faiths in their way of life.38 For the Jew, "the visible evidence of the Covenant was to be seen in the way of life of Abraham's descendants. They were to be devoted to the Torah, to the School and Synagogue, to Justice and Law."59 In the spirit of the statements of R. Joseph Kimhi on this topic,60 David Kimhi, in another context, described the ideal life of the Jew as it was manifested in his own community: We are the ones who maintain religion, following without hypocrisy the words of the Rabbis. We attend the House of God at dawn and even, standing in fear and trembling as befitting an Israelite. We are meticulous in the observance of religious law . . . We have inherited the legacy of our father Abraham of which God testified "to the end that He may command His children and His household after Him" (Gen. 18:19). Our houses are open wide to every passer-by and to all who seek rest. We weary ourselves day and night over the Torah and secretly support the poor. We do justice at every opportunity. Among us are those who provide books for the poor who have none and who give stipends for the study of Bible and Talmud.61 More noteworthy is the fact that behavior on a high moral level is obligatory not only towards the Jew but towards the gentile as well. On the verse "that hath no slander upon his tongue, nor doeth evil to his fellow, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor" (Ps. 15:3), Kimfii pointed out that the use of the terms reca, qarov, and camith (fellow, kinsman, neighbor), does not preclude proper con duct towards the gentile (nokhri). In all matters save one, the gentile is to be treated with the same consideration as the Jew. The one exception was of course the taking of interest from the gentile, an old question in Jewish-Christian dis putations.62 The Christians claimed that the Mosaic law permitting " PS. 115:4. 58 Cf.

Kimfb's reply was that refraining from taking in terest is an act of hesed or special kindness incumbent only upon those who reciprocate, and the Jew "is not required to lend him (the gentile) money for nothing for in general they hate Israel. Yet if a gentile acts with goodness and hesed toward the Israelite, then the Jew must certainly act with hesed toward him." In other words, relations with gentiles beyond the minimal amount of uprightness demanded by the Law are determined on a quid pro quo basis. While he suggests that the term "my brethren" (ahai— Psalms 22:23) maY refer to the "Edomites (Christians) among whom we are in exile and likewise the Ishmaelites and the Keturites for they are all the sons of Abraham our father," this is merely a subtle device to deprecate the Christians. This may be seen from the fact that Kimhi begins: "when You save me from the mouth of the lion and from the horns of the wild bull and You bring me out of the exile, then I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee." These "brethren" are none other than the tormentors of Israel who will acknowledge the God of Israel at the time of the redemption.63 Kimbi refused to entertain any notion which would contradict or bring into question the centrality of Israel. Whereas Rashi under stood Amos' utterance, "Have I not brought up Israel out of the Land of Egypt, and the Phillistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?" (9:7), to indicate the ultimate lack of special favor for Israel, Kimhi provided an explanation which contradicts this completely. He claimed rather that the nations mentioned were only manipulated for the sake of Israel and that only Israel would be redeemed from its exile. There is no question that Israel is "a special people among the nations," God's own people.64 While his metaphors are not as profound as those of a Judah Halevi, Kimhi likened Israel to the fruit of the olive tree while the nations are the chaff and the wood.65 In fine, they are the foundation of the world (Hqar binyano shel colam).66 85b.

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 227 The The Nature of Israel's Election Kimlji was well aware that Israel's election and centrality are not revealed in her position in the world. Although God saves them, there are those who rise in every generation to destroy the people Israel.67 Kimhi felt this, the pain of the exile, heavily. . . For if we leave the dominion of the Ishmaelites," he laments, "we come into that of the Christians (carelim). We are not to flee by foot nor are we to fight with our hands."68 Exile is a wandering (tiltul),6' an inescapable snare, the depths of the waters, incessant travail.70 With the psalmist he cries, " '0 Lord, deliver my soul,' [from those] in whose midst we are, for they are false and deceitful."71 "My enemy," who is mentioned in Micah 7:8, is "the wicked one under whom Israel's exile has lasted more than a thousand years and who thinks that the hope of Israel is lost and rejoices at their misfortune." In an unusually sharp statement, Kimhi explains the passage "O Lord, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways" (Isaiah 63:17) with reference to the exile. For if You remove the strain of the exile from us, we will walk in Your ways as Your heart wishes ... If so, You have the power to relieve us from distress. Yet You do not do so but You have left us in exile for years, and it is as if You had made us err from Your ways.72 The anguish and strain of the exile included such things as the special Jewish tallage," the gentile attitude that the Jews are of a non-human species,74 and the persecutions which came in the wake of the Cru sades, especially for Kimhi, the Albigensian crusade which he himself witnessed.75 67 Gen. 15:11. 68 Ps. 22:17. 6» Cf.

Similarly, many</page><page sequence="16">228 FRANK TALMAGE [16] Yet Kimhi's awareness of Israel's sufferings did not deter him from expounding a theory of special providence for Israel. In order to clarify this, it is necessary to consider his theory of providence in general. While our author apparently wrote no formal philosophical treati ses, his views on certain problems may be reconstructed from remarks scattered throughout the commentaries. Kimhi's starting point on a particular problem was frequently the view of Maimonides.76 The latter, in opposition to a number of schools of thought on the sub ject, declared that only man is subject to individual providence in contrast to other creatures who are graced only with providence over the species.77 More precisely, it is only one with a developed intellect that is affected by providence, thus precluding the possibility of providence for animals. While it is clear that the bestowal of provi dence is related to the intellect and is indeed directly proportional to its development,78 Maimonides does not clarify precisely what this providence is. There are apparently three separate interpretations of the nature of providence in the Guide for the Perplexed: (1) the ability and the wisdom to see impending tragedy so that it may be avoided;79 (2) the ability to accept misfortune "philosophically" by realizing that man is utterly insignificant and that his fate is of no consequence in relation to universal existence;80 (3) that God inter venes, by miracle if necessary, to save the sage at the moment of contemplation from impending doom.81 According to the first two interpretations, all men are endowed with providence in potentia at birth for providence is nothing but an appropriate use of the in tellect. According to the third interpretation, providence is indeed a special protection of a supernatural order. For purposes of the present study, it is sufficient to say that KimhiKimhi shares Maimonides' premise that the degree of individual provi dence is directly proportional to one's spiritual attainment, i. e., in tellectual perception. Thus when a man withdraws from rational activity (sikhliyoth) and religious practice (shimciyoth), "he and the ox remarks of Rashi have been taken to refer to the crusade of 1096. Cf. Y. F.

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 229 eat in the same manger."82 This is to say that he is to be considered as an animal with respect to providence.83 With reference to animals, as in the Guide, divine providence extends only to the species.84 God will maintain the species if it is for the most part good, eradicating it entirely only if it is wholly corrupt.85 However, there are one or two passages in which Kimhi appears to be somewhat ambivalent in regard to his attitude toward animal providence. In his commentary to the Psalms,86 Kimhi alludes to four views on the problem. (1) Animals killed by other animals deserve their death as punishment for past iniquities; (2) only human beings and not animals are subject to reward and punishment; (3) animals receive reward or punishment when their actions benefit or harm human beings; and (4) a view which is not worth recording. The first view can be identified with that of the cAshariyya brought in the Guide for the Perplexed (III:17), while the second is that of Maimonides himself. The fourth cannot be identified with certainty although Kimhi might be referring to the Muctazila whose view is ex pressed in the same chapter in the Guide, and which Maimonides rejects outright. The third opinion, however, is that which Kimhi claimed as his own. In certain cases, animals are subject to special providence incidental to their relationship with man. Whatever the motivation of this view, which is rather unusual in Jewish litera ture,87 may be, it is significant that it implies an interpretation of the 82 Phil. Comm. to Ezek., end. 83 As examples of God's providence to those who merit it, Kimlji cites the rise of Jacob, the descent of his children into Egypt, etc. (Gen. 37:13, 39:7, 41:1.) He further mentions God's response to individual prayer and supplication. (Ps. 6:9, 34=16). 84 Ps. 36:6. 83 Gen. 6:5, 11. 86 Ps. 145:17. 87 Similar views in rabbinic literature are cited by A. Aptowitzer in "The Re warding and Punishing of Animals and Inanimate Objects," HUCA III (1926), 117-55. See esp. pp. 131-40 and for a statement approaching Kimhi's view, passage (14), 135. (15) itself is cited by Kimlji. Cf. also S. Abramson in his remarks on this study in Tarbiz, XXXI (1961-2), 43-58. Cf. the statement by Saadia Gaon, Beliefs and and Opinions, III, end (ed. Rosenblatt, 175). Kimlji may have been influenced by Jewish and non-Jewish ideas concerning human human punishment of animals. In Jewish law, an animal who has killed or forni cated with a human being must be executed, because of the fact that it has served as a snare (taqalah) to a human being or for the sake of its own dignity. Indeed such an animal had to make an appearance in court just as a human defendant would. (Mishnah Sanhédrin 1:4, Bab. Talmud Sanhédrin 15a-b, Tosefta Sanhédrin 3:1.3:1. Cf. Bab. Talmud, Bava Qamma 41b, 43a, 43b, 44a-45a.) This had its parallel in court practices of medieval France. Trials of animal felons were commonplace and the records of such trials show that it was a common</page><page sequence="18">230 FRANK TALMAGE [18] concept of providence in consonance with the third view represented in the Guide, namely, a deliberate intervention on the part of God. It is to be noted further that Kimhi departs from or perhaps amplifies Maimonides in another respect. Unlike the latter, Kimhi stresses that it is Israel alone who are under God's control for "no star or angel will have dominion over them as long as they do His will nor shall they fear the portents of heaven ... for God's provi dence is fixed upon them . . . and they shall not be subject to chance (miqreh(miqreh ha-zeman)."w However, the gentiles, like the animals, are subject only to general providence. Like the animals also, God takes special account of the gentiles if they become excessively corrupt and engage in violence (fyamas) "for violence destroys civilization [of which] God is desirous . . . but concerning other transgressions, they are not sufficiently worthy for God to be concerned with them [and He is concerned] with Israel alone."89 Thus God punishes the gentiles for their offenses towards Israel, just as He punishes the animals for their offenses towards man. The distinction between Jew and gentile with respect to provi dence is reminiscent of Judah Halevi. According to the author of the Kuzari,Kuzari, just as only an Israelite could be a true prophet, there exists no connection between God and any other nation, as He pours out His light only on the select people . . . [The gentiles are] left to nature and chance by which their prosperity or misfortune are determined, but not by an influence which proves to be of divine origin alone.90 Yet despite the similarity between Kimhi and Halevi on this problem, the former does not share the premises of the latter. According to assumption that animals were responsible for their crimes against humans and that they should stand trial and be punished. Indeed there are reports which de scribe how the beasts voluntarily obeyed the decree of the court. It is quite possible that these ideas, which were in the air in Kimhi's day, influenced him in his theory of animal providence. Cf. E. R. Baker, "Animal Convicts," Merry England, X (1887), 529 ff.; G. G. Coulton, Life in the Middle Ages (London, 1929), III, 152 f.; Beniat-Saint-Prix, "Rapport et Recherches sur les Procès et Jugemens (!) relatifs aux Animaux," Mémoires de la Société Royale des Antiquaires de France, VIII (1ère série), 403 ff. 88 Cf.

Certain special variations in natural phenomena are used by God as portents (Amos 1:3, 4:10).

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 231 Halevi, the Israelite is the beneficiary of a divine grace which en ables him to receive the gifts of prophecy and providence. Indeed, even the convert cannot attain to the level of one who was born a Jew.'1 Kimhi's view on the matter can be seen in a discussion of the problem of why God was concerned with the gentiles of Nineveh in the time of Jonah. Kimhi remarked: God had pity on Nineveh for the sake of His glory for [all of His] creatures are His glory... not to mention the human species, as it is written, "whom I have created for My glory" (Isa. 43:7). Even though we interpreted this in reference to Israel, it does speak about the human species [in general] as it is written, "I have formed him, yea, I have made him." Yet since Israel recognizes the glory of God more than do the rest of mankind, except for the sages among them, He said the verse with reference to Israel. . .2י The dichotomy then is not primarily that of Israel-gentile but that of sage-ignoramus as in Maimonides. While there are sages among the gentiles,93 Israel is primarily a nation of sages who recognize and know that God created them and created the world and are witnesses for they recognize the glory of God and confess [His existence]. They meditate on the creation of man and how his limbs were formed in wisdom and how his suste nance is provided from the day he was born. This wisdom brings man to recognize God and to praise Him and give thanks to His name, for this is the glory of God. Therefore, He said: "Israel, 'whom I have created for My glory' is he who meditated on My deeds and confessed My unity."94 Regrettably, Kimhi never explained precisely how this providence is manifested. It is obviously not reflected in Israel's actual position in the world, and the notion that providence is in reality merely an יי Kuzari, 1:115. 'נ Jon. 4:10. Cf.

Kimhi could only do that which countless Jewish authors before and after him did, namely, to provide consolation for the tribulations of Israel. Two sources of consolation were available to our author: the first, the notion that the ten tribes are still living in freedom across the Sambation95 and will do so until the Day of Judgment; and the second, the Day of Judgment itself, when the Jews will be restored to the Land, the wicked will be destroyed, and all will wor ship the true God. Foremost in Kimhi's mind was the notion that the gentiles will be punished for their mistreatment of Israel,96 the special object of punishment being Rome.97 In commenting on Isaiah 34, he wrote: This section refers to the Days of the Messiah in the future and is about the destruction of Rome . . . The Kingdom of Rome consists mostly of Edomites who cling to the religion of the Nazarene, and even though other peoples became mingled with them, King Caesar was an Edomite as were all the kings of Rome afterwards . . . Now when the Land of Edom, i. e., Rome, is destroyed, Israel will go forth from the Exile and will be exiled no longer. . . and He spoke [also] concerning all the gentiles for the kingdom of Ishmael will be destroyed at this time, for most of the gentiles are divided between the kingdom of Edom and the kingdom of Ishmael.98 95 The tribes will be reunited with Judah and Benjamin and from their country the redemption will begin. Cf. Isa. 27:12, 41:25, Zech. 5:6 ff. Kimhi had little origi nal to say on this topic. For a review of its history, see A. Neubauer, "Where are the Ten Tribes?," JQR, I (1888) and the source material brought in Qovez 'al yad, IV (1888) by him. Cf. J. Rosenthal, "Medinath yisra'el le-or ha-te'ologiyah ha nozrith," Sura, II (1955). 96 Isa. 2:13, 14:1, 40:6; Amos 9:12; Mic. 7:14; Ps. 29:1. 9' Isa. 26:5, 34:5. 98 Isa. 34:1. Kimhi was greatly concerned with the identification of the gen tile nations mentioned in the Bible with those of his own times in order that he might refer certain prophecies to the latter. On one occasion, he said that Edom refers to the gentiles in general (Obad. 1:1; cf. 1:10), and on another that it refers to Rome (and Egypt to the Arabs) (Joel 4:19). The fact is that ". . . the nations are indistinguishable today except for Israel who are distinguished by their Torah and who did not assimilate. . . . The other nations intermingled and are divided between the religion of the Ishmaelites and that of the Christians [so that] when [Scripture] mentions Edom, Moab, and the Amorites, it means their lands and those who dwell in them . . ." (Cf. Ps. 108:1). In this fashion, Kimhi approaches the modern conception of nationhood. Another solution to the problem is his state ment that certain prominent families among the Romans are known to be descended from Edomite stock so that "Edom" is applied to the whole. (Isa. 25:10) At Obad. 1:20, Kimhi referred to "Alemania, Ascalonia, França which is</page><page sequence="21">[21] R.

Although the Jews were exiled because of their sins, gentiles "transgressed the conventions and laws in their oppression of Israel."100 This extreme maleficence merits ex treme treatment. Thus after the horrors of Gog and Magog, most of the nations will cease to exist and only a few will remain.101 Those who do survive will be saved only through the merit of Israel.102 The gentiles will utterly submit (be-takhlith ha-shifluth) to Israel, that they may acquire a feeling of subservience and humility, after which they will return to their homelands.103 Through the merit of Israel, they will then live in peace with each other,104 although they will not share the joy of Israel.105 While the Jews will not be spared the final holocaust,106 the fire which will burn the sinful gentiles (and the wicked Jews!)107 will serve only to brighten Israel,108 for God will save the righteous of Israel from all harm.109 Further, the national restoration, as repre sented by the return of Jerusalem to its rightful owners, will be achieved. Jerusalem "shall sit in its former place in the place known as Jerusalem today [which] the gentiles intended to destroy com pletely."110 The incessant exchange of the Holy City between the Christians and the Moslems will cease111 and only the righteous will dwell there."2 Zorfath and Spania. Alvania (Albania) is that which was called Canaan even in the prophet's own times." The reference of Isaiah 27:1, "Leviathan, Leviathan, and Tanin" is to Edom, Ishmael, and the Indians to whom Kimhi had recourse when he needed a third companion to the Christians and the Arabs.

Maimonides had declared: "The sages and the prophets did not desire the days of the Messiah so that they might rule over the whole world, nor that they might have dominion over the gentiles. . . ."113 Yet, Kimfii clearly stated not only the future centrality of the Davidic kingdom but also that the prophecy that the elder shall serve the younger shall be fulfilled.114 Coupled with this is the conversion of all the gentiles to mono theism and the cessation of idolatry (including Christianity) so that all the nations will join Israel in sacrificing to God at the Temple.115 "When will God's praise be great?," asks Kimhi. "At the ingathering of the exiles when the whole world will see the wonders that He will accomplish with Israel."116 Conclusion Kimfii's role as an advocate for Judaism is paralleled by his activity in intraconfessional dissension. Our author's defense of Maimonides in the controversies of the early thirteenth century is well known, and his interest in this area is reflected in the use of his commentaries as vehicles for propounding Maimonidean philosophy on a popular level. In a similar manner, Kimhi included anti-Christian disputational material in his exegetical "encyclopedia" for the educated but non specialist reader. The frequency with which Kimfii was singled out for censure by Christian scholars testifies to his importance and influence as a po lemicist for the Jewish faith. Later Jewish disputational works show unmistakable traces of this influence. A treatise such as the Herev pipiyoihpipiyoih (Two-Edged Sword) of Jair ben Shabbetai da Corregio (1519— 1574) never cites Kimfii by name but is replete with his exegesis.117 "3 MT H il. Mel.

Maimonides did speak of the permanence of Israel not shared by the gentiles (Guide 11:29) an(l this thought was echoed by Kimlji (Isa. 65:22). 115 Isa. 18:7. On Zech. 9:1 f., Kimlji remarked that the territories surrounding the Land of Israel will be judaized (be-'emunath yisra'el). Very similar to Kimfii's eschatology was that of Abraham bar Hiyya (Hegyon ha-nefesh, 34a f.). Cf. I Chron. 16:28.

DAVID KIMHI AS POLEMICIST 235 The sophisticated Magen wa-herev (Shield, and Sword) of Leon da Modena (1571-1648) refers to Kimlji in an explanation of the word calmahcalmah and is close to our author on other points.118 More illuminating is the relationship of the Ifizzuq נemunah (Strengthening(Strengthening of the Faith) of the Karaite Isaac ben Abraham of Troki (d. 1594) to Kimhi's writings. This work, which was one of the most widely used Jewish polemical treatises, cites Kimhi by name only once, in a refutation of the latter's identification of Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14). Yet a number of other passages are either paraphrases or expansions of Kimhi's comments. One may cite the exegeses of various biblical passages, including the "servant" passage of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, which are largely drawn from Kimhi. Other statements, such as those concerning a special providence for Israel and the denial of Jesus' messiahship, reflect Kimhi's language.119 The use of this material in the later literature reflects its continued currency and popularity throughout the Renaissance. salem, 1958). Prof. Rosenthal has indicated the similarities to Kimlii in a number of passages in his footnotes. 1,8 Leon da Modena, Magen wa-berev (ed. S. Simonsohn, Jerusalem, i960). Kimhi is cited in IV:9 (p. 58). The discussions of Isa. 6:3 (II :7, p. 32) and the in effectiveness of Jesus (V:9, p. 78) are reminiscent of Kimhi. "י Isaac ben Abraham of Troki, Hizzuq emunah (ed.
