<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXV, Fasc. I MUSLIM FESTIVALS *) I There are many ways of discussing, analyzing or comparing festivals and a great amount of scholarly literature has been devoted to the construction of different kinds of typologies in this field: calendar festivals over against occasional celebrations; seasonal, agricultural and historical celebrations or magical and commemorative rites etc. Some scholars compared festivals according to their forms and contents (pilgrimages, sacrifices etc.). Yet one of the most rewarding types of analysis seems to be that of the specific "style" and character developed by individual religions, especially if we assume that the characteristics of a religion are reflected to a certain extent in its festivals. In Christianity we have for example the interesting contrast between the festival-oriented character of Catholicism and the anti-festival attitudes of most of the Protestant denominations. In Judaism, on the other hand, the cycle of festivals throughout the year conveys a most meaningful picture of Jewish history and thought. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the religious festivals of Islam and to try to answer the special questions they raise, because although Islamic religious culture as a whole is very rich and its rites most variegated, its festival culture is rather meagre. There are few festivals in Islam, and Muslim festivals seem to lack colour or meaning. Islam has only two official festivals ("al-Cidan"), and both are in fact only some kind of appendices to more important observances: c Id al-Fitr concludes the Fast of Ramaddn and CId al-Adh~ the Hadjdi rituals. This is why these observances themselves are sometimes incorrectly described as festivals 1). The meagerness of Muslim festivals is very difficult to explain, *) I am very grateful to my friends and colleagues R. Z. Werblowsky and S. N. Eisenstadt who helped me to see Muslim festivals in a broader context than Islam. The original Hebrew text of this article will appear in Hebrew in the "D. Z.

E. von Grunebaum's - Muhammadan Festivals, New York 1951, in which he deals extensively with the Fast of Ramadn, The Pil- grimage, The Worship of the Prophet and Saints etc., but wherein he mentions only incidentally the two official festivals of Islam.</page><page sequence="2">Muslim Festivals 53 but it may have something to do with the severely monotheistic char- acter of Islam and its constant fight against pagan phenomena and remnants of the pagan past. Muslim - just like Jewish - festivals are a pagan inheritance, and no suitable way may have been found to islamize them as, for example, the Hadidj rituals were islamized. The reason for this may be that to most religious communities festi- vals signify the necessity and permissibility of giving rein to natural impulses by merrymaking, dancing, drinking and the like. But, al- though the Prophet of Islam apparently recognized the need for festivals, these were relegated to the background, at least by theologians and jurists. Understandably enough, the ordinary folk could not put up with this situation and supplied what they missed by observing their own popular festivals and customs. Popular Islam thus adopted alien festivals, such as Nauruz, the Persian New Year, and the ancient Egyptian spring festival, which are observed to this day, and revived pre-Islamic festivals, such as the Night of the Middle of the Month of Shacban. (This trend is still flourishing in Islam. Thus for example the beginning of Muharram, the first month of the Muslim calendar, is assuming nowadays the character of Sylvester or New-Year's Day, a feature completely unkown in Muslim tradition). The most striking expressions of this development are the various "Mawlids", i.e. birth anniversaries and memorial days of prophets and local saints, which have mushroomed throughout the Muslim world, their customs and rejoicings spilling over on the official festivals 2). The most famous of them is the anniversary of the birth and death of the Prophet Muhammad, on the 12th of Rabic al-Awwal, the third month of the Muslim year 3). Despite the opposition of theologians the "Mawlid al-Nabi", probably introduced in the early 13th century, has become a kind of official festival, threatening to deprive the two official festivals of their privileged position. However, we shall deal here only 2) These popular festivals have been described and studied extensively. Cf. f.i. E. W. Lane - Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians, ch. XXIV; J. W. McPherson - The Moulids of Egypt, Cairo 1941; M. Winter - "The Mawalid in Egypt from the eighteenth to the twentieth Century", in: G. Baer (ed): The cUlama and Problems of Religion in the Muslim World, (Hebrew) Jerusalem 1971, pp. 79-1o3. 3) According to Muslim tradition Muhammad (like Moses in the Jewish tradition) was born and died on the same day. He started his "Hidjra" from Mecca to Al-Madina on the same date as well.</page><page sequence="3">54 Hava Lazarus-Yafeh with the latter two, the study of which seems to have been somewhat neglected hitherto. II Let us first investigate the characteristics of the two official Muslim festivals and their position according to religious law. Both are not mentioned in the Qur an. The Hadith and later religious-legal liter- ature usually mention them only at the end of books devoted to lit- urgical precepts (sometimes as appendices to the Ramadin and HIadjdi rituals). Within this framework, there is, of course, no dis- cussion of the festivals as such but only of the festival prayers. It would indeed seem that the public festival prayer and the sermon following it are the essence of Muslim festivals. But even though the festival prayer is certainly a salient feature of both festivals, it is not obligatory! The Muslim festival prayer is regarded as a desirable optional act ("Sunna"), whereas the five daily prayers are regarded as obligatory for every adult person ("Fard CAyn"). Of course, the festival prayer belongs to those optional acts which have become general practice, but it has not even been given the official designation of these ("Sunna Mu3aqqada"). Some jurists think that the festival prayer is an act obligatory on the whole community rather than a "Sunna", namely that those who perform it thereby release those who do not-from the obligation ("Fard Kifaya"), just as, e.g., in the case of a holy war 4). In any case, the festival prayer is not a religious duty in the same sense as the five prayers on weekdays or even as the public prayer on Fridays, which seems to have become obligatory mainly for political reasons. Moreover, its contents are not different from those of everyday prayers because Islam knows neither a daily nor a festival prayerbook (although it has evolved a rich, beautiful literature of optional prayers). Every prayer consists of several prayer units known as "Rakcas" (from the verb rakaca "to kneel") each of which includes several blessings, the recitation of the "FItiha" (the short opening Sara of the Qur~afi which is the principal prayer of Islam), as well as a bow and two prostrations, spells of sitting down and standing up, and traditional gestures. A festival prayer is consti- tuted by adding two of those "Rakcas" to the ordinary weekday ones; 4) This idea prevails especially among the IIanbalite Doctors of Law. Cf, "Al-Fiqh Cala Al-Madhihib Al-Arbaca", Cairo 1928, p. 304 ff.</page><page sequence="4">Muslim Festivals 55 they are joined to the morning prayer (in contrast to the additional Friday "Rakcas", which are joined to the midday prayer) and are performed in public, now mostly at the mosque. As stated, an addition of two "Rakcas" at public prayers is also made on Fridays, but an even closer parallel is the addition of two "Rakcas" at special prayers, such as public prayers at a time of drought, prayers for rain, prayers during an eclipse of the sun or the moon, and the like. The Festival prayer, in contrast to the Friday prayer, has several more things in common with the special prayers. For example, it is not preceded by the call of the "Mucazzin"; there is no repetition (Iqama) 5) of this call at the beginning of the prayer inside the mosque; the sermon is given after the prayer and not before as on Fridays; and the prayer should not take place in the mosque but in the prayer plaza ("Musall-") at the entrance to the town. In the Hadith and in religious-legal literature, the precepts concerning festival prayers usually occur next to those concerning special prayers, and some hold, therefore, that the Festival prayers preserve a very old Muslim prayer tradition reflected also in the special prayers recited at the time of a disaster or the threat thereof. As against this, the Friday prayer represents a more developed and more sophisticated stage of public prayeer, instituted mainly in the cUmayyyad period and perhaps under the influence of the Christian church prayer 6). Later on the Friday prayer in its turn influenced the Festival prayer in various ways so that, f.i, both are held nowadays inside the mosque rather than outside the to-wn. We thus find that the Muslim festival prayer is merely a desirable act, not a duty, and that in both content and form it is not really dif- ferent from other prayers. Moreover, Muslim festivals are not periods of rest, just as the Muslims Friday is not a period of rest except for the actual hours of prayer (see Sura LXII, v. 9 and io). Goldziher surmised Persian influence in this matter, in addition to the fact that to Muslims a day of rest commemorating the Creation was crude 5) Instead of the "Adhdn" there is a shortened call to prayer (Al-Saldt Dinmicatan"). On the "Iqima" cf. E. Mittwoch - "Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Islamischen Gebets und Kultus", Verlag der K6nigl. Akademie der Wissen- schaften, Berlin 1913. 6) See C. H. Becker "Zur Geschichte des Islamischen Kultus", Der Islam III, I912, pp. 374-419.</page><page sequence="5">56 Hava Lazarus-Yafeh Jewish anthropomorphism, which they fought both in the Qur'an and its commentaries, as well as in the Hadith and anti-Jewish polemics. Thus, the Qurlan says that the world was created in six or fewer than six (i.e. two) days and strongly denounced the idea of a seventh day as a day of rest. For example: "We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and no weariness touched us" (Sfira 50, v. 38). The commentators add that this verse "came down upon" the Jews who maintain that the world was created in six days and that "on the seventh day God rested and was refreshed, rose up and sat on His throne" 7). What, then, are the characteristic of those two festivals? At CTd al-Fitr, one is enjoined to make a special charitable gift called "Zakcat al-Fitr". Every person who has a minimum sufficient for his livelihood must, on his own behalf and on that of the members of his household including his servants, make a donation for the feeding of the poor. It should preferably be made already before the festival, but it is undoubtedly a part of the latter and one of the few obligatory acts pertaining to it 8). At cId al-Adhi, a family sacrifice called 'Qurbin' is offered. As a matter of fact Islam does not really know of sacri- ficial rites and the sacrifice is more of a family meal. It is not consid- ered obligatory except in the case of persons who have made a vow or have unintentionally sinned during the Hadjdi. But is a desirable act customarily performed by all Muslims, both pilgrims at the con- clusion of the HIadidj at Mind and the millions throughout the world who have not been vouchsafed to make the Ha4dij. A lamb or a sheep is usually sacrificed for an individual and a camel or an ox for a family group of seven persons. The meat is primarily intended for the poor, although it is deemed desirable that the offerer and his household partake of it as well. In our time, the sacrifice is usually replaced by almsgiving, though no official permission for this substitution has been given by religious scholars. There has even been 7) See f.e. Al-Zamakhshari's exegesis to this vers and cf. I. Goldziher - "Die Sabbatinstitution im Islam", Gedenkbuch David Kaufmann, Breslau Igoo, pp. 86-1o2. Jewish sages also raised the question "Is God liable to weariness? !" in this connection. See Mekhilta on Exodus ch. 20 v. I I. 8) Some Doctors of Law do not regard this "Zakdt" as an obligation. Cf. "Al-Fiqh cal Al-Madhahib Al-ArbaCa", Cairo 1928, p. 599 ff. See also the details about this "Zakdt" donation in H. W. Juynboll, Handbuch des Islamischen Gesetzes, Leiden Ig9o, p. Iog ff,</page><page sequence="6">Muslim Festivals 57 explicit opposition to it even from modern-minded theologians 9), despite the enormous sanitary nuisance created by the sacrifice now- adays, when hundreds of thousands of pilgrims throng little Minfi every year. In sum, the main features of the two Muslim olfficial festivals are prayer and charity, to which are added various popular customs, such as a festive meal, festive dress, visits to cemeteries and pilgrimages to the tombs of saints 10). Yet the festivals lack specific ritual observ- ances and specific associations with the seasons of the year or with historical or religious events, this perhaps owing to the severely monotheistic puritan character of early Islam, as can be seen clearly from the following study of early Muslim traditions about the festivals. III Between the lines of traditional stories about Muhammad and his companions, we glimpse a kind of basic opposition to festivals in Islam. It is connected especially with the personalities of the first two caliphs, Abli Bakr and CUmar ibn al-Khatt.b. cUmar is known in the Hadith as a stern, inflexible monotheist (many have compared him to St. Paul); his surname is "the One with the Whip" because he would whip persons who, he thought, were not good Muslims. Many stories were told of his pure faith and his attempts to prevent remnants of earlier religions from clinging to Islam 11). It is, of course, possible that he became a symbol in this as in other matters and that many utterances attributed to him really belong to a later period. Nevertheless, there may be an historical core to these stories: a group of early Muslims may have been more anxious than even the Prophet to preserve the early puritan character of their religion. The most important story relevant in this context is one attributed to the Prophet's young wife, cAisha, which appears in all the canonical 9) See f.e. Mahmfid Shaltfit (the late Rector of Al-Azhar University) - Fatzdw, Cairo n.d., p. 144 ff. Io) Cf. f.e. E. W. Lane - Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians ch. XXV. II) Cf. for example his attitude towards the sanctity of Jerusalem or towards various rituals of the rituals of the Hadijd_. See my studies - "The Sanctity of Jerusalem in Islam" in Msgr. J. M. Oesterreicher and A. Sinai (eds.), Jerusa- lem, AAAPME, New-York 1974, p. 221, and - The Religious Dialectics of the Hadjdj" (in Hebrew) - The Israel Academy of the Sciences and the Human- ities, Jerusalem, 1976,</page><page sequence="7">58 Hava Lazarus-Yafeh books of Hadith: "One day, two bondwomen sang songs of the Ansdr at my house on the Day of Bucath, when Abfi Bakr entered my house and said: 'Songs like the songs of Satan at the house of the Prophet! And that on a festival day!' (some texts are more specific, reading 'on the day of the Qurbdn Festival'). The Prophet, thereupon, said to Abfi Bakr: 'Lo, every people has its festival, and this is our festival'. "Variants of this story contain further particulars, such as that the bondwomen also played the tambourine or that the Prophet was present at the time of their singing but paid no attention to it, or averted his face, or wrapped himself up in his mantle, or the like, until Abfi Bakr childed them 12). In this and other stories, the Prophet is represented as mild, con- ciliatory and, especially, understanding the minds of women and children. Thus we are told, e.g., that his womenfolk were once chat- tering freely in his presence but that when cUmar came they quickly hid from him. cUmar sternly rebuked them, saying: 'O ye enemies of your own souls, are ye afraid of me and are not afraid of the Apostle of Allah, may Allah's prayer and blessing be upon him for peace?" The women replied that he was rougher and harsher than the Prophet, and the Prophet himself remarked: "By Allah, O cUmar, Satan will not meet thee without going out of thy way and turning another way" 13). The theme of the Prophet's understanding the minds of women occurs also in another reference to festivals, in several varia- tions of a story about black Ethiopian slaves. The latter would cele- brate their festivals with dances in which they wielded spears and leather shields. cAIisha, actually still a little girl at the time, very much wanted to watch these celebrations, and the Prophet would hide her in the folds of his mantle to enable her to do so. cUmar appears in one of the versions chiding the dancers, but the Prophet silences him, saying: "Leave them alone, 0 cUmar !" 14). One fact emerges clearly from these stories: the Prophet realized the need for joy and for festivals inspiring joy, while some of his 12) Cf. Al-Bukhari, Sahi.h ed. Krehl, vol. I, p. 242 or Muslim, Sahih, Cairo 1955, Book VII, p. 607 (Nr. 892). (Ansar - The Muslim inhabitants of Al- Madina; The Day of Bucdth - one of their pre-islamic days of victory). 13) Cf. f.e.

Some scholars, therefore, conclude that the two official festivals were prescribed as substitutes for pre- Islamic celebrations. The following is reported in the name of Anas ibn Malik: "The people of the Djahiliyya (the pre-Islamic period of Religious ignorance) had two days in the year on which they 'played', and when the Prophet, may God's prayer and blessing be upon him for peace, came to Al-Madina, he said: 'Allah has given you something better than these two days: CId al-Fitr and CId al-Adh.a' " 16). Here we come to another motif frequent in Muslim tradition generally and in relation to festivals in particular. It is the motif "We, too, have this - and better" or "We, too, deserve this - and more than others". This motif occurs especially in relation to Judaism and Christianity and their prophets and festivals. Thus, e.g., we are told in the name of cAbdallah ibn cAbbas, the Prophet's cousin, who was considered a great expert on Judaism and on problems of Islamic exegesis and law, that when the Prophet came to Al-Madina he found the local Jews fasting on the Tenth of the First Month (" cAshidra") and their women dressed up in honour of the occasion. When he inquired the reason of the fast and the festival, he was told: "This is the day on which God gave Moses victory over Pharaoh" or in another version: "On it God saved Moses and the children of Israel from the hands of Pharaoh and drowned Pharaoh and his people in the sea, and in memory thereof we fast". The Prophet thereupon said: "We have a better right to Moses than you", and he accordingly com- manded the Muslims to fast on that day 17). Sayings expressing the 15) We know very little about Arab pre-Islamic festivals, as distinguished from pre-Islamic rituals such as the JHadidi, CUmrah, SaCy, Ramy etc. Some descriptions of pre-Islamic festivals are based on retroprojected Muslim notions (See f.e. the descriptions of the' CAshfira' in the .Hadith collections). Others which describe festivals of the early days of mankind may be closer to the actual Dijhilliyya customs. Cf. f.e. Al-KisaCi, QiSa, Al-Anbya, ed. I. Eisenberg, vol. I, Leiden 1922, p. 87. See also Ibn Hisham, Sirat Rasil Allah, ed. Wiisten- feld, I, p. 37. 16) Al-NasaCi, Sunan, vol. III, p. 149 (Kitab Salat Al-cIdayn). 17) This explanation of the fast is unknown in Jewish tradition. It may be a Muslim explanation, but it may as well preserve an ancient Jewish tradition which prevailed among the Jews in Arabia. See also G. Vajda - "Jefine Musul- mane et Jefine Juif" in HUCA 12-13, 1938, p. 374. For the Muslim tradition about' CAshfira', which was the first prescribed fast in Islam, see the canonical</page><page sequence="9">60 Hava Lazarus-Yafeh young Islam's feelings of deprivation as it were and its need for compensation-feature even more strikingly in the IHadith traditions about Friday. Thus, e.g., many versions of the following tradition, transmitted by Abti Hurayra, are ascribed to the Prophet: "We are the last (of the monotheistic religions), but we shall be the first on the Day of Judgment. Every nation received (its holy book) before us, and we received it (scil. ours) after them, but on this (weekly) day, which has been enjoined upon us, Allah has us take the lead, and people follow us in this matter: the Jews on the morrow (the Sabbath), the Christians on the next day (Sunday)" 18). Lastly, we might mention here another group of Hadith traditions about the festivals. They express the notion that the Jews have a keener appreciation of festivals and are therefore worth imitating or, in other versions, that Islam is not inferior to Judaism in festival- mindedness. This group of stories is connected with the famous verse (Sfira V, 5), which reads: "This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have filled up the measure of my favours upon you: and it is my pleasure that Islam be your religion...". A Hadith adduced by many commentators of this verse goes approximately as follows: "A Jew said: If this verse had descended upon us, we certainly would have fixed a festival on that day". To this, Ibn cAbbds or CUmar replied: "Verily, this verse descended upon us on a double festival day, viz. on CArafa Day (the most important day of the Hadijdj, when the congregation stands at the foot of the Mount of Mercy, listening to a sermon), which fell on a Friday..." 19). Of course, it is very doubtful whether these stories permit of any h i s t o r i c a 1 inferences, but they certainly point to an interesting, collections of the Ijadith, usually at the end of the books on the fast of Ramada.n. Some of these traditions try to blur the Jewish origin of the CAshfird and tell about the same fast as part of the Djihiliyya rituals. 18) Cf. Muslim, ibid., "Kitab Al-DiumCa. Other traditions express the same feelings, while describing the order of nations entering Paradise on the Day of Judgment ("We appeared last - but we shall enter first" etc.). The motif certainly evolved later than the earlier concept of Friday, which was perhaps chosen as a day of worship, in order to attract the Jews. Cf. S. D. Goitein - "The Origin and Nature of Muslim Friday Worship" in his "Studies in Islamic History and Institutions", Leiden 1966, pp. 111-125. 19) See f.i. Ibn Kathir's commentary to the verse (Vol. II, p. 12-13). A very important detail in the various explanations to this verse, which should yet be studied thoroughly, is the attempt to put the word 'festival' ('Id') as an equivalent to the written word 'religion' ('Din').</page><page sequence="10">Muslim Festivals 61 essential feature of Islam: Muslim festivals did not grow organically; they do not commemorate events of its history or of the life of Muhammad and his prophetic experiences (as does f.e. the Fast of Ramadain, see Sura II, 185). Adding to this the fact that Muslim festivals have no connection with the seasons of the year or with agriculture, such as sowing, reaping, fruit-picking or asking for rain, we note an emptiness in them which bears no proportion to the religious richness of Islam in general. We ought to point out here that a few and rather late attempts have been made to connect at least one of the two festivals, the Feast of Sacrifice, which concludes the IHadjdi, with features of the Muslim past, viz. with Abraham and the Sacrifice of Isaac. As is well known, opinion in Muslim tradition is divided as to who is the anonymous "Al-Dhabih", mentioned as to be sacrificed by his father in the Qur'an (see Sfira XXXVII, 97-113). Many of the early traditionists think that he is Isaac, but the prevailing view is that he is Ismael 20). However, what concerns us here is not this controversy but the fact that in various sources, e.g., in Qur'an commentaries, especially on the aforesaid Stira, and in the popular Tales of the Prophets, ('Qisas Al-Anbiya'), the Feast of Sacrifice becomes a kind of re-enactment ot Abraham's role in the sacrifice of his son. The names of the three main days of the IHadjdj, are interpreted with reference to the sacri- fice (and not, as customary, to the IIadjdj itself); this is done by using the very frequent method of name-interpretations as in Biblical literature. The first day is said to symbolize Abraham's uncertainty ('tarwiya-tarawi') as to whether the order to sacrifice his son comes from God or from Satan, the second his realization ('arafa') that the order comes from God, the third his decision to carry out the sacrifice ('nahr'); A rock ('Sakhra') at Mina seems to replace the foundation- stone in the Dome of the Rock, the locale of Isaac's sacrifice in Jewish tradition; the throwing of stones at Mina is linked in these inter- pretations, as usual, not only with Satan's enticement of Abraham, but also with Abraham's attempts to catch the ram (from Paradise) in order to sacrifice it instead of his son 21) 20) Cf. A1-KisaCi, Qi4as Al-Anbiya, ed. I. Eisenberg, p. 150-151 and Al-Thac labi, Qiaas Al-Anbiya, Cairo, n.d., p. 80o ff. 21) See. f.i. the commentaries of Ibn Kathir and Al-Baidawi to the story in Sfira 37.</page><page sequence="11">62 Hava Lazarus-Yafeh But all these explanations did not grow organically with the festival, but seem to be merely an extension of the original Islamic connection between Abraham and Ismael, and the Kacaba with the rituals of Hadjdj. Even more so, only in recent sermons and detailed Muslim scholarly discussion of the festivals of Islam as compared to other religions we find explicit statements to the effect that the CId Al- Qurban' was established in memory of Abraham's readiness to sacri- fice of his son 22). IV It should be noted that the Shica, the largest sect that seceded from orthodox Islam, which today makes up about ten per cent of Muslims in the world, mainly in Iran but also in Iraq and Lebanon, has an entirely different festival culture. Thus, e.g., 'CAshfira' Day has as- sumed in the Shicite world a character quite dissimilar from the bleak one it has in Sunnite Islam. In the latter, it has remained an optional fast day since the time the Fast of Ramadan was instituted. In the Shica, it is the day of remembrance of the slaughter of Al-Husayn and his family by the Umayyad army at Karbala (October io, 68o), when the Shicites unsuccessfully tried to restore cAlid rule. This day of mourning is commemorated with splendour and extraordinary intensity in the Shicite world. It is marked by processions, ecstatic gatherings, dramatic re-enactments of Al-H. usayn's sufferings and passion plays called Tacziya (consolation), all manifesting the essential cultural difference between Shi'a and Sunna. In the words of the late U. Heyd: "These processions are extremely different from the ceremonies of Sunnite Islam; they are the expression, not of a mas- culine religion that finds its truth confirmed by the success of its adherents in this world, but of the feelings of a persecuted sect whose experiences center upon the torments of a righteous man, the killing of a saint by the forces of evil" 23). Yet the difference between Shica and Sunna is perhaps much deeper even than that and may be discerned in the rejection by the monotheistic-puritan Sunnite orthodoxy of 22) See f.e. Mugtafa Al-Tayr's articles on the festivals in "Madjallat Al- Azhar", of February 1971 and January 1972. 23) Translated (from the Hebrew) from his article "Observations on the Religious Cultural Situation in Iran" in The New East ('Hamizrah Hehadash'), Quarterly of the Israel Oriental Society, vol. VI, 1954/1955, p. 6.</page><page sequence="12">Muslim Festivals 63 certain, ancient, ceremonies and performances revived by the Shica (as by some Christian groups). The Shicites have also festivals of their own, such as 'cid al-Ghadir', which falls after the Ha.dj , on the 18th Dhfi al-HIididja, the day on which, according to Shi'ite tradition, Muhammad appointed CAll his successor ('Wasi') and they cultivate especially the pilgrimages to the graves of their saints, such as CAli, Husayn and the Imams. At the same time, they accept the official festivals and basic rites of Islam. Yet sometimes there arise difficult problems with regard to these, for example, with the visit to the tomb of the Prophet at Al- Madina, customary for those making the pilgrimage to Mecca. Ac- cording to tradition, the Prophet's companions and heirs, Abfi Bakr and cUmar, are buried near him, but they are obnoxious figures, usurpers, in the eyes of the Shicites, who side with the CAlids. The .tIadidj has thus at times been marred by tension, and even riots, arising from charges that Shicite pilgrims had desecrated the burial chamber of the Prophet and his companions 24). However, the principal disputes between the Shica and the Sunna do not concern matters of ritual, and certainly not the festivals, but articles of faith originating in different attitudes towards the early history of Islam. For hundreds of years, attempts have been made to bring the Shica back into the orthodox fold, and these have concentrated on doctrinal matters rather than on the festival calendar 25). This is in striking contrast to the attitude of Ju- daism for example, which lays particular stress on its festival calendar and has struggled hard to achieve its uniformity 26). It seems that whereas 24) See f.e. R. Burton - Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Mecca, Vol. I, London 1913, p. 321 and p. 431. 25) Cf. my study "Contemporary Religious Thought among the CUlamd of Al-Azhar" in: Asian and African Studies Vol. VII, 1971, pp. 231-232. 26) A famous story about Rabban Gamliel the second, head of the Sanherdin at the end of the first and beginning of the second Century, illustrates this clearly: One of the well known sages of his age, Rabbi Joshua, calculated the beginning of the new Jewish Year in a slightly different way from the head of the Sanhedrin, because he doubted the words of the witnesses who testified to have seen the new moon. Rabban Gamliel commanded him "to come to me with thy stick and thy money on the Day of Atonement, which shall fall in accordance with thy calendar" e.g. to behave on the holiest day of the Jewish Year as on a regular day of work... Rabbi Joshua accepted the command, though reluctantly, because he shared Rabban Gamliel's view and attached also extreme importance to one uniform calendar in Judaism. When he thus arrived at the latter's place he was received with the greatest honour and respect for what he had done.</page><page sequence="13">64 Hava Lazarus-Yafeh in Judaism the festivals and the calendar have almost become the touchstone for determining a dissident sect, Islam treated and still treats the whole subject of the calendar and festivals rather casually - not only in relation to the Shica. To this day, orthodox Islam has no uniform calendar or festival dates; the new moon is determined - much as in Judaism in the days of the Second Temple and for some time after its destruction - according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are brought before the local 'Qadi'. There may, therefore, be differences of one or two days - e.g., as to the beginning and end of the Fast of Ramadan - between one region and another, not even very distant ones. True, the radio is today used as an auxiliary device, and Cairo Radio, e.g., proclaims the beginning of the fast for a wide area. But orthodox Islam is still very far from accepting an astronomical calculation of the calendar and the festival dates, although voices advocating it are becoming more numerous nowadays 27) resuming isolated Sunnite demands, made in this direction in the Middle Ages, (when the Ismacili Shi'a already adopted it). V Let me sum up: Festivals, in general, seem to have inherent pagan, mythological characteristics, and these are usually expressed in dra- maticized rituals. The monotheistic religions tried to change this pattern or, at least, lend it new meanings either through the re-enact- ment of historical events (e.g., the Jewish festivals) or through adding the human, personal aspect as in Christianity. But, the pure severe monotheism of Islam seems to have rejected any compromise in this respect. This may well explain the fact, that Islam did not really cultivate religious festivals. It may as well be the indirect reason for the growth of the popular Mawlids in Islam, cherishing as in Christian- ity and the ShiCa, the factor of human mediation. The lack of any rituals or dramatization at the Muslim festivals may also explain why these festive days are to be considered often as being liable (e.g., through sermons at the mosque) to political or other incitement of the crowds, who search after new contents for their feasts.
