<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 51 THE RELIGIOUS 'PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. I'. IN these days of intellectual unrest, a philosopher who pleads with energy and earnestness for the truth and supreme importance of religion, and who claims to have found in a return to religious faith the secret of human blessedness, demands our most careful attention. No one who reads Eucken's books can have any doubt of his sincerity and intense earnestness. It is not without reason that his admirers describe him as being as much a prophet as a philosopher. The claim to prophetic inspira- tion ought, perhaps, to impress us, but those of us who remember the days of the fame and glory of Thomas Carlyle, when it was a mark of benighted ignorance not to admire and reverence that stern prophet, and who recall how unworthily and ruthlessly the great idol was trampled in the dust, are not so eager as we once were to hail with enthusiasm the coming of a great prophet- philosopher. Nevertheless, we cannot help feeling that Eucken's teaching calls for serious consideration, both because of the positive message which he has to announce and because of the challenge with which he seems to confront some time- honoured beliefs. He presents us with a philosophy-a view of life and of the world-in which belief in an absolute spiritual Supreme Being is the great fundamental principle. He assures us that in the religious recognition of this Being and our relationship with it-or Him-and in such recog- nition alone, we can find peace in our souls, victory over the world, and perfect blessedness. On the other hand, he seems, at least, to demand that, in order to secure this peace, we must abandon as unreal and</page><page sequence="2">52 THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. outworn superstitions many beliefs which old-fashioned conservative Christians have been accustomed to regard as infinitely precious, and as fundamental articles of faith. These views and ideas are not altogether new or singular. Our prophet-like other prophets-is but voicing the best spirit of his age. In the higher circles of the world of thought, we know that a strong current has been flowing in the direction of some form of theistic belief. We know also from innumerable books, pamphlets and magazine articles that there is a widespread feeling that we must have a new theology or a reconstruction of the forms of our faith. The great value of Eucken's work consists in the fact that coming to his task with a goodly equipment of varied learning, he has thought out the whole subject thoroughly, has attempted to define the nature and impli- cations of theism as he understands it, and has stated clearly all that is really implied in the many vague demands for a reconstruction of Christian Theology. In the first place it must be remembered that Eucken's books are not easy reading. Those who cannot grasp the brilliant inductions of Bergson are wont to describe the French philosopher as "nebulous " : they admit that there is light and grace in what he puts forth, but will not believe that there is any substance behind it. No one will describe Eucken as nebulous. In many ways he reminds us of Hegel. There is the same tendency to grub and grope in the depths of thought or things; Hegel perhaps deals more with abstractions and relations, Eucken with "'the vague and confused notion of sub- stance." The effect is much the same, and the dialectic method of Hegel finds a parallel in the noological method of Eucken. In both we come upon rare bits of burning eloquence which carry us away-more often in Eucken than in Hegel. In both we are startled now and again by simple homely illustrations or epigrams, which remind us that, after all, we are dealing with the commonplace facts of the everyday world, but, with these exceptions, an ordi- nary reader finds that, to follow the line of thought one</page><page sequence="3">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 53 must read with close and strained attention. When, there- fore, such a reader attempts to write about what he has learned from Eucken he must do so with a very deep sense of his own fallibility and a modest willingness to receive correction. He will, at the same time, feel that he need not be surprised if many keen thinkers are found to de- clare that Eucken is a mere word-spinner muddling his brain with empty abstractions. This has been said about Hegel by men who were by no means stupid or ignorant. II. To understand Eucken's philosophical system, we must first of all grasp firmly the distinction between the spiritual life and the phenomenal, or " nearest-to-hand," world which stands over against that life and in sharp contrast with it. It is really the old Kantian distinction between the noumenal and the phenomenal; but whereas Kant regarded the noumenal simply as an unknowable postulate, which-as a postulate-could serve no purpose save as a basis for the demands of the Practical Reason, Eucken, on the contrary, holds that the noumenon can be known by or in experience as the reality of all realities, as that which must enter into living connexion with the whole cosmic experience-phenomenal world included-and give the whole world its true meaning as the Kingdom of Freedom and of God. The phenomenal world is not the mere world of matter outside us: it embraces the whole of society, the whole sphere of human history, and man's own psychic life at all events on its lower levels. The entrance of the spiritual life into this world marks the coming of a new stage of reality. What then is this spiritual life--this which is in fact the true noumenon ? It is substance; it is one; it is spiritual; its characteristics are love and holiness, and it embraces and takes up into itself the whole phenomenal world. In a word, it is the Supreme Absolute God. The main object of that intensely interesting work, The</page><page sequence="4">54 THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. Main Currents of Modern Thought, is to show that, apart from the recognition of the spiritual life, our whole life in the world is a hopeless tangle, full of endless difficulties and insoluble problems. Science must be a mere putting of things side by side without meaning or connexion with one another or with the rest of life. History is a confused record of comings and goings without apparent pur- pose or real progress. Morality is either a delusion-as the determinists are logically bound to believe-or, at best, something a little better than the animal instinct for self- preservation. The spiritual life, entering into this world from the sphere of the timeless and eternal, gives new meaning and life to the whole, and affords a noble and satisfying solution of all our problems. If Eucken's conclusion were simply a value judgement based on the necessity of the spiritual life to give meaning and rationality to all our existence, we might yet admit its force and validity. The conviction that life and the world must have an intelligible meaning and purpose is deeply ingrained in our nature. But, although it is not always easy to follow him, it is clear that Eucken does not rely mainly on this indirect method of reasoning, but rather uses it by way of confir- mation of a belief arrived at by a more direct method. What then is Eucken's proof of the Being of God ? The older and more familiar arguments do not appeal to him at all. In part iii., chap. ix., of The Truth of Religion, he subjects those arguments to a ruthless and relentless criticism. He has none of Kant's clinging affection for the argument from Design. Science has revealed to us such a complicated world and such a vast infinity of cases of accommodation of organism to environment, in which there is so much that seems to serve no ultimate purpose, that we can no longer derive any conviction therefrom as to the presence of an Almighty Designer. The world presents much that is irrational and unmeaning, and the arguments for the benevolence of the Creator are so mani- festly " subornations of evidence in favour of the character</page><page sequence="5">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 55 of the great First Cause" that no good purpose can be served by such worthless argument. Nor does it fare any better with the great argument from Conscience or Morality-the decisive argument for Kant and Bishop Butler. Morality may be merely the result of custom, the highest refinement of the animal instinct of self-preservation. Our modem psychology of ethics has traced out the genesis and growth of morality from below, while the variations in the moral standard confirm our belief that morality is a mere natural product of the phenomenal world. Besides this, both these arguments are anthropomorphic, and to all forms of anthropomorphism Eucken is bitterly opposed. We might perhaps say that Eucken's argument is ontological since it depends on a belief in the necessary existence of a substance as the basis and cause of certain phenomena. It would, I think, be more correct to describe his direct argument as intuitional. The fact of the existence of God is given to us in experience. It is not, however, the mere intellectual experience of Descartes. Intellectualism pure and simple is utterly barren and empty. In the whole experience of life-in our struggles and conflicts, in our work and striving, in the full tide of emotion as well as in the stern constraint of the will-we become conscious of this spiritual life in the depth of our being. It belongs to eternity: it unites us with the whole world, and yet it presents this world as something hostile, to be conquered and overcome. Our dissatisfaction with ourselves, our sense of weakness in the presence of high tasks and noble ideals, even our doubts and denials, compel us to recognize the reality of this inmost spiritual self. The phenomenal world itself must have sprung from this spiritual life: for Eucken is no Dualist : but it has been cast out, as it were, to pass a quasi-independent existence, in order that it may be conquered and overcome in a fierce conflict by the higher life for the sake of which it was created.</page><page sequence="6">56 THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. For Hegel, the phenomenal world was the manifestation of the Absolute-as it were its body. For Eucken, this world is but as the material for the garments with which the Absolute is to be finally clothed. Yet we may remem- ber that for Hegel, too, the Absolute was something more than the mere sum of events and phenomena, while for Eucken as for Hegel the Absolute is at least the source and goal of all life and being. It is now easy to under- stand what Eucken means when he describes the spiritual life as "a task rather than a fact," or "as well as a fact." The great fact is given to us in experience-the active experience of life-but it is only given in sundry parts and divers portions, and to enter into its fulness we must grasp it, and hold it fast with all our might in the struggle and conflict of life. What is it that we thus hold fast ? Is it an impersonal substance recognized by the noological, as distinguished from the psychological, method ? or is it a living, loving personal God? It is not altogether easy to answer this question to one's entire satisfaction; but one cannot help feeling that it is likely the followers of Eucken will, like the followers of Hegel, split up into different parties in their efforts to explain and defend the master. The party of the left will probably point out that in the first part of The Truth of Religion, Eucken seems abso- lutely to deny the Personality of God, that in the second part he treats it as a necessary form for characteristic, i.e., positive, religion to assume, but as, nevertheless, a some- what dangerous fiction. Eucken's system will then pass into a somewhat deeper expression of the Religion of Humanity. The only Divinity is to be found in the higher character and common aims of human beings. Religion- the grasping of the spiritual life-will become merely earnest meditation on the characteristics of noble life; and assuredly this metaphysical substance which knows not, which loves not, which can hear no prayers, which can be touched with no feeling of compassion for human weak- ness or human sorrow will cease to be a subject for serious consideration. Eucken's noological method will perish from its utter emptiness and uselessness.</page><page sequence="7">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 57 On the other side, the party of the right will point to the carefully guarded form of Eucken's statement when bidding us not to employ the term Personality as more than a symbol. They will remind us of his rooted dislike to a degrading anthropomorphism: they will show that he considers that the idea of Personality is in some sense necessary as a safeguard against Pantheism. They will then quote the passage in part iv., chapter xiv., which tells us that the communion between the soul and a living God as between an I and a Thou is the very essence of positive religion; that though the idea as a mere theoretical doctrine is inadequate and dangerous, yet "when experienced within the life-process it is entirely obvious and indispensable." They will then argue, and argue with a good show of probability, that if Eucken uses the term Personality of God with some hesitation, it is only because he believes that His personality is something so much greater and fuller than ours that the word is scarcely adequate to express the full meaning. At all events, we may very well accept with gratitude Eucken's powerful argument for the Being of God, and, whether we think such was Eucken's view or not, maintain that, for us, spiritual living being can have no meaning apart from those attributes which we conveniently describe under the term Personality. We are now in a better position to understand Eucken's objection to the popular arguments for the Being of God. It is mainly because those argu- ments are derived from the phenomenal world, and be- cause one cannot prove anything about God from the phenomenal world in itself, that Eucken rejects them as worthless. As a matter of fact, when once he has established the doctrine of the spiritual life to his satisfaction, he returns to these old arguments and presents them with great power. Morality as a natural product of the phenomenal world is meaningless or self-contradictory. The spiritual life solves our difficulty by simply placing freedom and morality on the highest and surest basis.</page><page sequence="8">58 THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. Again, in the chapter on Evolution, in the Main Currents, it is shown that the doctrine of Evolution, whether scientific or philosophical, assumes throughout an aim or end of all upward striving--"A far off Divine event to which the whole creation moves." Apart from teleology, the theory of evolution is as stupid as it is meaningless and brutal. Thus the old argument-which we all really love best of all--is put on a new basis and presented in a new aspect, and in a form which is not likely to be shaken. III. It is the business of philosophy to explain and define the universal form or essential absolute nature of religion. But if religion is to be a practical reality, this universal form must enter into connexion with the phenomenal world, must take on certain characteristic forms in institu- tions, societies, rites, ceremonies, doctrines, etc. A full treatment of the subject of the truth and value of religion, therefore, demands a careful study of the characteristic forms in which religion has manifested itself in the course of the world's history. His investigation of this part of his subjects leads Eucken to a profound belief in the supreme importance of Christianity as the fullest, truest and most perfect expres- sion of the absolute religion-the only religion capable of fully satisfying man's need and giving permanent expression to religious truth. Christianity is a "religion of redemption." In this it is distinguished from Judaism and Mohammedanism, which are "religions of law." Buddhism and Esoteric Hinduism are also religions of redemption, but whereas their aim is to deliver man by taking him away from the world, Christianity seeks to deliver man by giving him the victory over the world, and so bringing the whole cosmos under the sway of the spiritual life. Christianity first clearly revealed the great secret of all religion-the union of the Divine and human natures-</page><page sequence="9">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 59 and made this union a living, working power in the world. Christianity teaches the need for a new creation and a birth from above, and not only teaches this, but makes this new creation a reality. Christianity teaches the perfect law of love, which is the very nature of the Absolute Being. Finally, Christianity will tolerate no compromise with mere worldly views and aims, but sets itself in direct opposition with the mere human culture which is founded in a belief in the sufficiency of the life of the phenomenal world. This seems all true and right, but we naturally ask, How far does Eucken accept Christianity as the historic faith founded on historical facts ? What is his view of the life and work of Jesus Christ? Again and again he dwells on the supreme value of the life of Jesus, and he is quite clear that the personal life of the Founder of Christianity can never cease to be a mighty power for the regeneration of mankind. The absolute spiritual life has been manifested in the Lord Jesus with a fulness and power which, if words have any meaning, can fairly be described as unique: " Religion has in him transformed itself into a human purity with a wonderful energy and inwardness. The Personality of the Founder has become incomparably more to Christianity than the founders of all the other religions have become to their ad- herents. The human Personality who first and foremost brought Eternal Truth to-the plane of time, and through this inaugurated a new epoch, remains permanently present in the picture of the Spiritual World, and is able permanently to exercise a mighty power upon the soul." Again, "The life of Jesus exercises ever- more a tribunal over the world, and the majesty of such an effective bar of judgement supersedes all the development of eternal power." It might be argued that in these and other passages when Eucken speaks of the power of the spiritual life as manifes- ted in Jesus, he means no more than that our blessed Lord was a great and shining example whose life must continue to affect us in the same way, but in a higher degree, than the lives of other great and good men. When, however,</page><page sequence="10">60 THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. we weigh his words carefully and take account of his whole doctrine, we might fairly argue that Eucken means -or is logically bound to mean-much more than this. In face of all this, it is strange to find the metaphysician, Eucken, protesting vigorously against the ontological- metaphysical doctrine of the Incarnation, and denouncing the doctrine of the Atonement and of the sufferings of Christ as a base superstition. If the spiritual life is the life of the Absolute Divine Being; if the whole work of redemption consists in the conquest of the mere psychic man by this spiritual life, is it too much to describe the Being in whom alone this absolute life was perfectly manifested and made a power of new life lor the world as the God-man ? Those who hold to that old form which Eucken denounces will not hesitate to admit that the Logos was manifested in pre-Christian times as a light shining in the darkness; though they must say in a special sense "of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world," This is the Son of God; and they are free to, hold that, logically, Eucken ought to say so too. Again, it seems hard to understand the logic of Eucken's objection to the orthodox view of Christ's sufferings. According to Eucken, all our fiercest conflicts and our bitterest pains result from the opposition of the psychic life of mere man, and of the life of the world, to the dominion and power of the spiritual life. If we regard only our Lord's sinless humanity, there may be no place in Him for such suffering; but if we think of the spiritual life in its purest and most perfect manifestation coming into contact with the whole life of the sinful world, must we not expect that the deepest and most bitter mani- festation of human sorrow would be the natural result ? It is hard to resist the conclusion that in this polemic our prophet-philosopher is unconsciously influenced by an earlier phase of thought which his more mature philosophy has outgrown. His own doctrine is really in essence that ontological-metaphysical doctrine of the Incarnation which he professes to reject; and to the present writer it</page><page sequence="11">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 61 seems that Eucken's whole doctrine of the spiritual life in its conflict with the world has thrown a new and welcome light on the mystery of the Atonement. Will anyone but a blind worshipper of the prophet- philosopher accept his dictum that it makes no matter, and ought to make no matter, whether we believe that the per- sonal Jesus rose from the dead and communicated with His disciples or not ? If it be a fact--and Eucken admits that there is much weight in the evidence for it-it is yet an historical fact, an occurrence in the phenomenal world, and as such can have no bearing on our spiritual life. To those who agree with Eucken as to the unique per- sonality of the Lord Jesus Christ, it may seem com- paratively easy to believe that the survival of that personality and its special manifestation was just what might be expected. We may agree with Harnack that a certain kind of spiritual knowledge of the historical Jesus, and a certain sense of the significance of His life, is a neces- sary condition without which the evidence for our Lord's resurrectidn cannot produce living conviction. But can anyone really believe that it will make no practical difference to any sincere and earnest man whether he believes in the fact of Christ's resurrection or not ? For a serious mind must not this belief affect the whole outlook on life ? What is Eucken's view of the doctrine of personal immortality ? The spiritual life-which be it remem- bered is manifested in us and in our lives-is essentially a timeless, i.e., an eternal life, and its aim is to transform the whole cosmos into the eternal kingdom, of God. But we must not look for a survival of the mere ego with all its limitations. It'is a mean thing to be concerned for the survival of "the dear self." So far then as the present writer understands him, Eucken's view is that a great per- sonal or multi-personal life in which all our earthly selves shall be gathered up, abides, and will abide for ever, but that our individual personality will cease to exist.</page><page sequence="12">62 THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. It is not altogether easy to understand him; but, on the whole, one gathers that in any ordinary sense of the words Eucken does not believe in personal immortality. The idea of a noble life of conflict and suffering lived for the sake of a far-off world of eternal blessedness in which we ourselves shall have no share and which we as "dear selves" shall never see, is alofty, a noble, and even an inspiring ideal. But surely it may be doubted whether Eucken, with all his energy and earnestness, will ever succeed in making it a power for good in this confused phenomenal world, or whether psychic men will not prefer to go on making the most and best of their poor psychic lives, regardless of the call of the far-off Absolute. At all events, this doctrine is not that good news which has proved itself so mighty a power to comfort and con- sole us in our trials and sorrow, which is so admirably suited to the capacities of poor weak psychic mortals, and which seems so characteristic of that God whom Eucken worships, whose nature is love. We who cling to the old historic faith do indeed labour for a far-off Divine and perfect kingdom; and because our interest is in the kingdom and, in the redemption, of all men, we feel that there is no element of mean selfishness in the joy with which we look forward to seeing-as our Master before us saw-of the travail of cur souls and being satisfied. When one has found help, stimulus and much precious guidance in the works of any writer, it is natural that he should take the most favourable view of whatever seems doubtful or untrue. At the same time, it is not surprising or unusual that a great teacher should be right in what he asserts and wrong in what he denies or criticizes. Eucken's alternatives are so peremptory; his assertion, "You must either give up these superstitious accretions, or abandon religion altogether," is so positive, that an ordinary person is almost afraid to question the cogency of his logic or the validity of his inference. Yet those who know anything of the history of philosophy or the</page><page sequence="13">THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF RUDOLF EUCKEN. 63 history of religion will realize that it is not necessary to shrink abashed and confounded before these terrible alternatives. It may appear as time goes on that Eucken has gone somewhat farther and seen a little more fully and clearly than his predecessors; that he has traced out more fully and truly than any who have gone before the foundations of faith and the true nature of religion; but that in his sweeping rejection of much of the Old in favour of his own New he has drawn unwarrantable and baseless inferences. Nay, more, it may come to be seen that a really inexorable logic must lead us from Eucken's pre- mises to a more whole-hearted acceptance of the old verities of the Traditional Faith. W. M. FOLEY.</page></plain_text>
