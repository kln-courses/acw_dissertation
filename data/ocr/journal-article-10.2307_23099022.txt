<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. D. ACKERMAN* Wallace Stevens: Myth, Belief, and Presence Certain aspects of Wallace Stevens' poetry have often been com pared to myth. The term usually has been used to describe particular figures or patterns, or simply to point in a general sense to Stevens' spiritual or metaphysical dimension. Northrop Frye says that poets " see individual and class as metaphorically identical: in other words they work with myths. . . . Such myths . . . play a large role in Stevens' imagery." 1 James Baird notes that for Stevens " the true poet in any age is a maker of a canon for the imagination as its highest levelhe adds that the " arc of [Stevens'] canon is, then, the major projection of a myth. ..." 2 But precisely in what way does Stevens' poetry function on a mythic level? How does his theory of poetry— his theory of life, the subject of his poems—involve the idea of myth? Now at a time when the meaning of myth is increasingly crucial to criticism, Stevens' poetry and thought can be a significant contribution to our understanding of the mythic dimension—and themselves clarified by such an understanding. For just as the idea of myth provides a confluence for the disparate elements of modern literature as a whole so too it can help to explain oppositions in the work of Stevens, such as those between the decreative and the creative, the secular and the spiritual, the formalized and the spontaneous. Central to all these opposing tendencies is the apparent contradiction between Stevens' professed faith in physical experience and the abstract texture of his poetry. He proclaims that the " greatest poverty is not to live / In a physical world...." 3 But his own poetry seldom provides a sense of physical immediacy. Instead it is founded on a vast abstrac * Assistant Professor of English at the University of Arizona, R. D.

These are the measures destined for her soul. (67) Such seeming inconsistency has led to confusion. For instance Helen Hennessy Vendler objects to Joseph Riddel's trust in Stevens' " devo tion to the physical world "—which she thinks " was largely non existent," although she adds that " Stevens' wish to be devoted to the physical world was of course real."4 The truth is that Stevens' abstract poetry is his way toward an immediate and sacred physical world, that is, in Mircea Eliade's words, a " real" world filled with " power " and " saturated with being." 5 Such poetry at its highest reach fulfills a fundamentally mythic role, for, as Philip Wheelwright understands, myth is not a " fiction imposed upon one's already given world, but is a way of apprehending that world." 6 The resolution at the heart of Stevens dualisms is his faith in the potential reciprocity of literature and life. At twenty-six he wrote in his Journal: " I wish that groves still were sacred—or, at least, that something was: that there was still something free from doubt. . . . I grow tired of the want of faith—the instinct of faith" (L, 86). At sixty-three he asked in "The Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet": " At what level of the truth shall [the virile poet] compose his poems? " In essence his answer was: On that level where poetry is the " imagina tion of life " (NA, 62, 65). His instinct of faith had been provided for by his belief in poetry. The dynamics of Stevens' thought and the line of development of his poetry are based on a growing awareness of the mythic properties of literature and provide in turn an illumina tion of the idea of myth. We will see that the meaning of myth cannot be circumscribed by reference to archetypes, patterns, or stories. It is in terms of its junction that the idea of myth can best be related to literature, and the overlapping functions of literature and myth lead finally to the problem of belief.

Ackerman immediacy, " Domination of Black," records a horror of the profane in a dizzying whirl of turning leaves and colors, dark hemlocks and screaming peacocks. It concludes: Out of the window, I saw how the planets gathered Like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind. I saw how the night came, Came striding like the color of the heavy hemlocks. I felt afraid. And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. The once-fixed stars are turning in the wind, and the cry of the peacocks is also the poet's response to a profane, chaotic universe. Minus a form of transcendence (or transparence), the world of im mediate experience pictured in Stevens' early poetry remains as spiritually frustrating as the " fluttering things " of " Le Monocle de Mon Oncle " or the " insoluble lump " of turnip in " The Comedian as the Letter C." However, Stevens early announces his quest for the " origin and course / Of love " (18), and his poetry as a whole testifies to the centrality of this pursuit, which is in fact a search for presence. Wheelwright observes: "To know someone as a presence instead of as a lump of matter or set of processes, is to meet him with an open, listening, responsive attitude; it is to become a Thou in the presence of his /-hood. . . . The sense of presence may be felt toward inanimate objects as well. ... A presence is a mystery that claims our awe." 7 Stevens says that a poet " is intent on what he sees and hears and the sense of the certainty of the presences about him is as nothing to the presences themselves" (OP, 198). The fundamental drive of Stevens' poetry is toward a love relationship with the physical earth. He strives to become a Thou in the presence of its 7-hood. His poetry both exalts man's imagination as divinity and decreates romantic modes of perception that interfere with the imagination's openness to the I of earth. Stevens writes that " we must somehow cleanse the imagina tion of the romantic" (NA, 138); the "world has been painted; most modern activity is getting rid of the paint to get at the world itself " (L, 402). It is in the vacuum left by his decreation of former modes of experience that the mythic elements of Stevens' poetry take root and grow. 7 Metaphor and Reality (Bloomington, Ind., 1962), p. 155.</page><page sequence="4">Wallace Stevens: Myth, Belief, and Presence 269 All the while that his poetry decreates in order to expose the earth in its "essential barrenness" (373), the natural forces of earth enter the poetry as abstract mythic forms, helping to create the grounds of Stevens' own perceptions. J. Hillis Miller claims: "There is [in Stevens' poetry] no rich echo of nuance and meaning from the poetic tradition, as in Eliot or Yeats. God is dead, and with him died the heaven of consecrated symbols coming down through the Christian or Platonic ages." 8 Stevens' poetic abstractions often have more in com mon with primitive art than with the sophisticated traditions of Western man. Ihe interesting parallels between primitive ritual or myth and modern literature have been noted frequently. For example Frye says that primitive art " expresses a directness of imaginative impact which is naive and yet conventionalized, spontaneous and yet precise." 9 Such ritualized spontaneity is a primary characteristic of Stevens' poetry; it is especially evident in the early " Ploughing on Sunday," which begins: The white cock's tail Tosses in the wind. The turkey-cock's tail Glitters in the sun. Water in the fields, The wind pours down. i he leathers fiare And bluster in the wind. There is no attempt in the poem to describe an immediate experience. Stevens does not picture a bent old man walking behind a wooden plow being pulled by a lame horse through the puddles. The " I" of the poem is ploughing North America, and not on a particular day in 1916, say, but on Sunday. The poem's imagery deals in classes of things: white cock's tail, turkey-cock's tail, sun, water, wind, feathers, moon. Although Stevens portrays a physical world, the picture is as formalized as ritual. And it is these abstract forms of nature that loom large in Stevens' poetry. They do not function as conscious, realistic counters but as childlike pictures or primitive Dictopranhs. Even the poetry of Stevens' first volume, Harmonium (1923, 1931), is founded on a primitive-like environment centered in the " Timeless 8 Poets of Reality (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), pp. 230-31. ° The Modern Century (Toronto, 1967), p, 95.</page><page sequence="5">270 r. D. Ackerman mother" (5) earth, who is also "Death . . . the mother of beauty (68), and presided over by the giant tree of procreative life, "To which all birds come sometime in their time" (17). It is an abstract but naturalistic world typified by " swine-like rivers " (78) of change and inhabited by blackbirds as well as doves. The poet enters this atmosphere as a rabbi guided by the " furious star " (14) of love, male consciousness responding to his woman imagination while they live through the changes of the seasons under the influences of sun and moon. Frank Doggett (following Frye's suggestion) makes the case for the resemblance between these pervasive women figures and Jung's idea of the anima.10 Stevens' mythic level can be better appreciated in light of Jung's own description of the anima: " With the archetype of the anima we enter the realm of the gods, or rather, the realm that metaphysics has reserved for itself. Everything the anima touches becomes numinous—unconditional, dangerous, taboo, magical." 11 Associated with this primitive-like environment are Stevens' repre sentations of the poet as magus. " Ploughing on Sunday," for instance, has the beat of a chant, and Uncle Remus in that poem is an early version of the chanting magician. Stevens' shamanistic poet figure, however, appears more clearly in later poems, such as in these lines from " The Man with the Blue Guitar He held the world upon his nose And this-a-way he gave a fling. His robes and symbols, ai-yi-yi— And that-a-way he twirled the thing. Gerald L. Bruns relates this aspect of Stevens' poetry to myth, main taining that " both Heidegger and Stevens attribute to poetry an ancient, originally mythic, function. . . . The power of the poet is once more the power of Orpheus, his ability to call up as from nowhere a world in which man may dwell." 12 But the world that Stevens summons is a symbolic figuration of the mind; it is not a realistic representation of the world man dwells in. That which distinguishes the mythic side of Stevens' poetry from other forms of symbolic activity, though, is the degree to which it 10 Stevens' Poetry of Thought (Baltimore, 1966), Ch. 3. 11C. G.

Ernst Cassirer writes: " In the image myth sees a fragment of substantial reality, a part of the material world itself . . . [while] religion strives toward a progressively purer spiritualization." He goes on to separate these mythical and religious forms of consciousness from aesthetic consciousness, whose images " confess themselves to be illusion as opposed to the empirical reality of things. . . Elsewhere he adds that in " the mythical imagination there is always implied an act of belief." 13 The mythic dimension of Stevens' poetry grows out of a faith in the immediate moment of sensory experience and a belief in the reciprocity of word and thing. Stevens claims that a " poet's words are of things that do not exist without the words" (NA, 32). His special emphasis is neither toward the spiritual pole of religious con sciousness nor simply toward the abstract illusion of the aesthetic; it is rather directly on the mysterious point of contact between the physi cal world and the spiritual imagination. Stevens' sacred moment occurs as actuality disappears into mind. This is his time of origin, the cos mogonic act of the imagination that makes the " sky acutest at its vanishing" (129). Eliade locates such a moment at the center of primitive myth consciousness; it is " the time of origins . . . the time of the cosmogony, the instant that saw the appearance of the most im mense realities, the world." 14 For Stevens the world the imagination lives in is the real world, the sacred, and it must be continually created anew in accord with the demands of both the imagination and the senses. But such an emphasis on these primal forces is not, for Stevens, to forget man's reasoning consciousness. If the " mind / Is the eye " (305), still the imagination is the " sum of our faculties" (AM, 31), and this includes the tradition of civilized thought. For Stevens the central poet (who sets the stage for experience of the sacred) lives "in the very center of consciousness," that " ultimate good sense which we term civilization " (NA, 115-16). Stevens is not primitivistic. Although he urges man to " see the sun again with an ignorant eye " (380), only the centrally conscious man can achieve such ignorance, such naked ness. Only he knows that the " death of one god is the death of all" 18 The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Vol. 2: Mythical Thought, trans.

Ackerman (381), and that mans poem springs from the muddy centre, " myth before the myth began " (383). finally the expression of his own spirit is, for Stevens, a figuration of earth, and the primary figures of his poetry are themselves mythic presences. They are the forms which stand between the light (the capacity and desire for love) of the imagination and the external world. They are the basis for presential experience. In " Poem with Rhythms," The hand between the candle and the wall Grows large on the wall. I he mind between this light or that and space, (1 his man in a room with an image of the world, 1 hat woman waiting for the man she loves,) LtI'Ows large against space. . . . The mythic forms of Stevens' poetry, like the hand, measure the intensity of the light within and frame the experience of space without. In this sense, the poet's children are also his parents; the old man of Stevens' late poems is also a child. He has created the " pure perfec tions of parental space, / The children of a desire that is the will. . . ." The child is the " mind, among the creatures that it makes, / The people, those by which it lives and dies" (436). This mythic level of Stevens' poetry provides an environment for experience of the sacred. It is, in Frye's words, " the concrete, sensa tional, figurative, anthropomorphic basis out of which the informing concepts of discursive thought come." 15 For Stevens, poetry is an "art of perception" (OP, 191). A poem can provide an atmosphere capable of altering man's immediate sense of the physical world. As Stevens says, " Anyone who has read a long poem day after day, as, for example, The Faerie Queene, knows how the poem comes to possess the reader and how it naturalizes him in its own imagination and liberates him there " (NA, 50). The nature of a particular poetic atmosphere is determined largely, according to Stevens, by the meta phors of the imagination: " Poetry is a satisfying of the desire for resemblance " (NA, 77), and " Resemblance in metaphor is an activity of the imagination " (NA, 73). The metaphor fundamental to Stevens' own poetry fuses the human and the divine. " The brilliance of earth is the brilliance of every paradise" (NA, 77). His poetry helps to 15 Fables of Identity, p. 58.</page><page sequence="8">Wallace Stevens: Myth, Belief, and Presence 273 create " the way of thinking by which we project the idea of God into the idea of man" (AM, 150). The mythic aspects of Stevens' poetry, then, provide an atmosphere wherein the imagination of man God opens to allow earth-heaven to declare its presence. And it is especially this dimension which constitutes the primary thrust of the later poetry. In a letter on June 1, 1939, Stevens wrote: "My own way out toward the future involves a confidence in the spiritual role of the poet" (L, 340). The titles of Stevens final three volumes of poetry speak for them selves: Transport to Summer (1947), The Auroras of Autumn (1950), and The Rock (in the Collected Poems, 1954). Basically these volumes accomplish just that: a spiritual transport into the auroras of a fresh sacred space where the central symbol of the rock represents the incarnation of imagination and actuality. Stevens' major prose (written roughly during this same period) also acclaims a fresh faith grounded on the relationship between the imagination and the physical world. In I he Noble Rider and the Sound of Words (1942), Stevens de clares that " the imagination gives to everything it touches a peculiarity, and it seems to me that the peculiarity of the imagination is nobility . . . which is our spiritual height and depth " (AM, 33-34). In fact he endows his idea of nobility with much the same aura of mystery and power that Eliade associates with the primitive's sense of the sacred and Wheelwright relates to the idea of presence. Stevens writes: "Nothing could be more evasive and inaccessible [than nobility]. Nothing distorts itself and seeks disguise more quickly. There is a shame of disclosing it and in its definite presentations a horror of it" (AM, 34). Stevens' response to the mysterious nobility of the imagina tion leads eventually to his affirmation (however qualified) that " God and the imagination are one" (524; OP, 178). Nonetheless, the mind as God is nothing without the content of earth, and the earth barren ness without the mind. The act of perception remains uppermost: the imagination is the " necessary angel of earth . . . [through whose sight] you see the earth again" (496). In "Credences of Summer" (from Transport to Swnrmer), the sun ("the centre that I seek") descends to the "final mountain," the meeting place of man and God, earth and heaven. The imagination and actuality become united in the " rock [which] cannot be broken. . . For Stevens this symbol represents both the ultimate abstraction and the indivisible moment of concrete experience. It is the crux of his myth, hinged both to the imagination and the physical world.</page><page sequence="9">274 k. D. Ackerman In Stevens last major, longer poem, The Rock, the barrenness of the rock of physical being is covered by the " leaves " of man's consciousness, his poem, as if " nothingness contained a metier. . . But Stevens does not stop there. " It is not enough to cover the rock with leaves. / We must be cured of it by a cure of the ground / Or a cure of ourselves. ..." A spiritual cure results when the leaves break into " bud," into " bloom," and bear " fruit," and man then eats of " the incipient colorings / Of their fresh culls. . . Man's poem, man's belief, and man become one. The fiction of the leaves is the icon Of the poem, the figuration of blessedness, And the icon is the man. . . . The " illusion" (that nothingness itself " so desired") becomes the gateway into a spiritual-physical world beyond the barrenness of the rock. Stevens' myth has been founded on the movements of the physi cal universe entering a mind creating " out of its own self, not out of some surrounding myth" (NA, 53). Stevens' leaves are of the sun itself: . . . The pearled chaplet of spring, The magnum wreath of summer, time's autumn snood, Its copy of the sun, these cover the rock. [The leaves] bud the whitest eye, the pallidest sprout, New senses in the engenderings of sense, The desire to be at the end of distances, The body quickened and the mind in root. They bloom as a man loves, as he lives in love. They bear their fruit so that the year is known. . . . Therefore: " They are more than leaves that cover the barren rock. . . Their colorings cure our perceptions of the physical world and make possible the experience through love of earth's presence: The rock's "barrenness becomes a thousand things [individual pres ences] / and so exists no more. . . But despite the feeling of finality of "The Rock" it would be wrong to imagine Stevens' living myth as ever final. If the point of meeting between mind and matter is the sacramental center of Stevens' poetry, it also represents the convergence of inner and outer mystery.</page><page sequence="10">Wallace Stevens: Myth, Belief, and Presence 275 The icon of man s poem is the evidence of a mating and a marriage (OP, 212) between imagination and actuality, but these ecstatic meet ings are fleeting and ambiguous. The imagination " can never effec tively touch the same thing twice in the same way." The experiential world is alive with mystery; it is " that reality of which we never lose sight but never see solely as it is" (OP, 215, 214). In the late " The World as Meditation," Penelope awaits Ulysses, and the sun rises: But was it Ulysses? Or was it only the warmth of the sun Un her pillow? I he thought kept beating in her like her heart. I he two kept beating together. It was only day. Lt was Ulysses and it was not. . . . Desiring Ulysses' sacred presence, Penelope experiences the " savage presence " of the sun. The marriage exists only in the fleeting moments when Ulysses and the sun are one in the pulses of her own mind. Records of such marriages in Stevens' own experience are rare in his poems. But especially in the very late, short poems there are glimpses of an individualized physical world no longer carrying its abstract, mythic weight. The fluctuations between mind and actuality of course do not cease; the two realms must be kept separate as the very basis for presential union. But there is an increased sense of particularization and personal immediacy in such poems as " The Hermitage at the Center," " The River of Rivers in Connecticut," and " Reality is an Activity of the Most August Imagination." At this stage Stevens and his " Interior Paramour " have composed, momen tarily, " a dwelling in the evening air " (524). His imagination and his sense of the physical world having been bound together in a mythic figuration, Stevens' immediate experience can then become the direct cause of his poem's celebration. (Jompare " Domination of Black" to the final poem of the Col lected Poems, " Not Ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself At the earliest ending of winter, In March, a scrawny cry from outside Seemed like a sound in his mind. He knew that he heard it, A bird's cry, at daylight or before, in the early March wind. The sun was rising at six,</page><page sequence="11">276 R. D. Ackerman No longer a battered panache above snow . . . It would have been outside. It was not from the vast ventriloquism Of sleep's faded papier-mache . . . The sun was coming from outside. That scrawny cry—it was A chorister whose c preceded the choir. It was part of the colossal sun, Surrounded by its choral rings, Still far away. It was like A new knowledge of reality. The peacock's scream against the chaos has become a chorister's cry, part of the sun. Here there is the sense of an awakening to a real and sacred world where "as and is are one" (476). The bird's cry " Seemed like a sound in his mind." But " He knew that he heard it. . . ." The wind of change, which causes vertigo and fear in the early poem, has become a March wind heralding spring. Stevens' poetry as a whole has functioned as a living dialectic, sus tained by and aimed at experience of both inwardness and otherness. By allowing his imagination's spiritual desire only the satisfaction of the elemental forces remaining after his own decreations, Stevens was able to open a way for the declarations of the presences of earth. These presences, encouraged by the poet's primitive-like faith in the immediate sensory moment, came to constitute a personal myth, a window opening outward toward the thing and inward toward the source of love. Many of the late poems, especially, testify to Stevens' clear aware ness of the mythic nature of a poetry that had become for him a way of sight linking together (while keeping separate) mind and earth. In " The Planet on the Table " Ariel knows that His self and the sun were one And his poems, although makings of his self, Were no less makings of the sun. Stevens knew he had written "The Poem That Took the Place of a Mountain," and that He breathed its oxygen, Even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table.</page></plain_text>
