<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROPHET OF AMUN IUPUT AND HIS DISTINGUISHED ANCESTORS By AIDAN DODSON The publication of two fragments in a private collection, deriving from the cartonnage mummy- case of the Prophet of Amun Iuput (B), a descendent of Osorkon I through his eldest son, the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq. The paper also publishes a coffin lid bearing the name of Iuput's father, Osorkon D, and now in Stockholm (NME 838), and discusses various issues surrounding the family. Amongst other points, it is concluded that the High Priest Shoshenq should not be equated with any King Shoshenq, and that his mother, Maatkare B, died prior to the accession of Osorkon I. The Prophet of Amun Iuput B In a private collection in the North-West of England are two pieces of a polychrome cartonnage mummy-case (fig. 1 and pl. I).1 One (29 x 15 cm) bears the image of a vulture, wings outstretched before it and with the insignia of Nephthys on its head. The other fragment (31X15 cm) carries the image of an anthropomorphic goddess, also with wings spread in front of her; unfortunately, the area of the insignia above her head has been broken away. Behind and below her are bands of text in blue paint, the latter apparently marking the ankles of the casing. The fragment also preserves some elements of decoration beyond the vertical band of text, including what appears to be the knees and feet of a squatting figure, together with the left-hand half of a column of text; the right-hand portion is broken away, making the first signs difficult to interpret, but the remainder should clearly be read J^l^^n^^- The reverse of each piece shows evidence of the mud and straw form that was used in the manufacture of such casings.2 The greater incrustation of mud on the second fragment is consistent with it coming from near the foot, where the removal of manufacturing debris will have been less easy. Although there is no proof that they derive from the same case, their style, colouring, and manufacturing technique are so alike to make this all but certain. The fragments clearly come from the front and side of the lower-left leg-area of a whole-body mummy-case of the broad type current from the reign of Shoshenq I down to the end of the Twenty-second Dynasty.3 1 I am most grateful to the pieces' owner for bringing them to my attention, and for permission to publish.

However, both reverse the relative positioning of the bird- and human-forms seen on our fragments, and lack its ankle-band of text. Berlin 7325 is datable by mummy-braces to the reign of Osorkon I, and it appears that the 'classic' Design 1 continues down to the middle of the Twenty-second Dynasty, later pieces of the type belonging to a rather different 'tripartite' design.7 The owner of TR 21/11/16/5 has been equated with the like- named mother of one Meresamenet,8 who was herself a granddaughter of a King Takelot. The question of Shaamenimes' dating will be considered further below. As already noted, the lower fragment of our two preserves part of a vertical column of text that ran along the edge of the cartonnage, and a horizontal band that ran at right angles below it (fig. 3).

The height of the missing text then would essentially correspond to that of the missing insignia from the top of the goddess's head - probably only one or two groups. This would indicate that the owner of the cartonnage was almost certainly the son of the Prophet of Amun Osorkon, rather than a grandson or more remote descendant. The missing name of the deceased is provided in the horizontal band. While obscured by hardened unguents, which make the last half of the preserved text impossible to discern, the visible elements may be read in part as follows: isir [hm- ntr] n imn iwpt si hm-ntr n i[m]n[...]. Unfortunately, the traces of the following name are wholly unclear, and it impossible to be certain whether or not it is that of the Osorkon who is recorded at the top of the preserved part of the text-column. Thus, a further generation (or more) could theoretically be concealed under the unguents. However, the evidence for the length of the side-text would suggest that Osorkon's name and titles did indeed follow those of Iuput, as his father (see fig. 4). In any case, we certainly have a hitherto-unknown individual, to be dubbed Iuput B, following on from Iuput A, the son of Shoshenq I.10 The Prophet of Amun Osorkon D Iuput's father Osorkon (D) is attested by a number of items from his tomb, which appears to have been discovered at Thebes during the years of Napoleon Bonaparte's expedition. Somewhere during 1 799/1 800, a Book of the Dead and a Book of Amduat belonging to Osorkon were acquired by Antoine-Romain Hamelin (1770- 1855), ll but were then passed to Vivant Denon12 for publication in facsimile (figs 5 and 6 here).13 They were soon afterwards sold to an agent of the Emperor of Russia and are now in the National Library of Russia, St Petersburg.14 In his Book of the Dead, Osorkon is called the isir hm-ntr n imn wisirkn si hm-ntr tpy n imn ssnk, with his mother named as one nst-ti-wdit-iht. On the Amduat his genealogy is taken back a further generation by the addition of ... si nsw nb-tiwy wisikn, and his title is expanded to ... n imn-rr nsw-ntrw. These papyri are interesting in that they are the latest known examples of the tradition originating in the middle of the Twenty-first Dynasty of providing a burial with this combination of a hieratic Book of the Dead and a papyrus containing extracts 9 Most cases having a multi-coloured, but particularly red, band. 10 Using the scheme for distinguishing homonyms initiated in K.

Its dimensions and overall proportions make it clear that it is an outer case of typical Twenty-second/third/fifth Dynasty Theban intermediary/outer type,19 with its fairly modest dimensions suggesting that it once contained a close-fitting mummy-cartonnage of the earlier end of that timescale, rather than a bulkier bivalve coffin of the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Intermediary/outer coffins of this era tend to be rather austere in appearance, with little decoration other than vertical columns of text down the front and a winged goddess or sun-disk on the breast. The exceptions rather follow contemporary inner cases, with extensive vignettes and/or texts from the Book of the Dead. However, the green, yellow, red, and white striping that is now to be seen on the margins of Osorkon's lid does not fit in with any known decorative scheme of the period (or any other, for that matter). Further, the winged sun-disk on the chest is wholly un-Egyptian, being in a heavily-debased form seen in Egyptianising work of the first half of the nineteenth century ad (cf. fig. 8).2° Indeed, almost all visible pigment on the lid seems to be of nineteenth century date, with only a few points where ancient paint might still exist.21 There are no traces of an original pectoral winged motif, and in fact is seems that the lower edge of the extant wings may actually follow what had once been the bottom margin of the broad collar that had formerly been depicted. Not only this, but the two broad columns of text that occupy the front of the coffin do not accord at all well with the textual arrangements normal on such coffins.22 They also display in many cases a lack of understanding of forms and, indeed, the shape adopted for the (j-sign closely mirrors the curious 'hooked' version, (j , found in some transcriptions in the Description de l'Egypte.23 Together with the form of the pectoral sun-disk, all the stylistic evidence points to the coffin lid having been repainted in the first part of the nineteenth century, possibly in France. A close examination of the surface of the front of the lid revealed no surviving trace of any original text.24 However, a strip down the centre of the lid displays a surface texture that differs noticeably from that elsewhere, and it seems most likely that a du style, dans lequel notre monument a été peint et décoré' (Piehl, 'Quelques textes égyptiens empruntés à les monuments, conserves au Musée de Stockholm', in Actes du huitième Congrès International des Orientalistes, tenu en 188c à Stockholm et à Christiania 4/3 (Leiden, 1892), 51 (§5)); he was quite right about the oddity of the style but, as we shall see, not for the reasons he suggests! A photograph was later published in V. Schmidt, Levende og dode i det gamie JEgypten: Album til Ordnung af Sarkofager, Mumiekister, Mumiehylstre o. lign (Copenhagen, 1919), 193 (fig. 1086), and its texts once again in B. J.

Not understanding the hieroglyphs, nor their decorum, the copyist slotted what was actually the end of the god's label-text in front of the first part. Fig. 8.

Intriguingly, the 1826 catalogue of Denon's own collection included as its number 243 the following:25 Couvercle d'un grand cercueil en bois ...: son visage est rouge, sa coiffure et son col- lier sont également peints; un longue colonne d'hiéroglyphes occupe la moitié de son vêtement. This description is clearly of a standard later Third Intermediate Period outer coffin, with a single column of text. Its height is given as '6 pieds' (194 cm),26 which compares fairly well with the 208 cm height of the Stockholm lid,27 and given the aforementioned traces of a former central text column on the latter, it is certainly not impossible that they could be one and the same. If so, the 'pDenon' texts could only have been added following the preparation of the catalogue after Denon's death in 1825, most probably after his collection's sale in January 1827. Now, as we have seen, Osorkon's Book of the Dead had passed out of Denon's hands a quarter of a century earlier, and the question would then arise as to whether the association between coffin and papyrus had been maintained all that time, ultimately suggesting that the former should then be 'restored' with reference to that papyrus - a copy of which was of course easily accessible via Denon's 1802 publication. On the other hand, if the coffin-lid and papyri had indeed been found together, Denon would presumably have been aware of this, and one might even imagine that copies of the plates from his book could have been kept with the lid and passed to its new owner, providing a basis for his 'restoration' of the piece. Another alternative would be that the 'restoration' was made much earlier, while the coffin and papyrus were still associated, at the very beginning of the century. However, given the tumultuous nature of the times, this would seem less likely, and raises a question as to who was responsible for the 'restoration' and into whose collection it might have then passed, since as it now would have borne two columns of text it could no longer be Denon 243. The other option, as already noted, is that the use of the text from Osorkon's Book of the Dead was purely fortuitous, and that the 'restorer' was simply looking for hieroglyphs to adorn a coffin-lid of unknown origin. However, there must have been plenty of coffins to use as a model, and using a six-column label-text from a papyrus to produce a two-column text for a coffin does not seem an obvious approach. Thus, the most attractive option would seem to be that the use of texts taken from Osorkon D's Book of the Dead for the restoration was based on the lid being regarded as associated with the papyrus, which was thus a legitimate source for texts to replace what one can only assume was a poorly preserved original text on the lid. As to whether Denon 243 and Stockholm NME 838 are really one and the same, the catalogue of the Denon collection notes that the former 'appartenait originairement à 25 L. J. J. Dubois, Description des objets d'arts qui composent le cabinet de feu M. le baron V. Denon (Paris, 1826), 54. 2 A pied in pre-metric France measured 32.48 cm, as against 30.48 cm for the Anglo-American foot. 27 The round figure used for 243 s measurement suggests that a ~±io cm variation is permissible, not to mention the difficulty of accurately measuring such pieces unless the underside is fully accessible.</page><page sequence="10">6o AIDAN DODSON JEA 95 la caisse extérieur qui renfermait ensemble la momie et le cercueil précédents'.28 This piece numbered 242 is described as follows:29 Son couvercle représente une femme dont le teint est très claire, et qui porte à ses oreilles des boutons de couleur noire ; sa coiffure, ornée en avant par les ailes d'un vau- tour, présente sur le sommet de la tête un scarabée qui tient une petite boule, et dont les côtés sont occupés par deux hiéroglyphes. Depuis le dessous son collier jusqu'au bout des pieds, le vêtement qui la couvre est chargé de tableaux représentant des scènes religieuses ou des divinités isolées; trente- huit inscription hiéroglyphiques achèvent de remplir le fond, qui est coloré d'un jaune agréable et peu foncé. Derrière la caisse à laquelle appartient ce couvercle, est peint un grand nilomètre mitré, image de Phtah-Stabiliteur ■, ainsi quiqui divers signes hiéroglyphiques. Whether the attribution of the coffin to a woman is correct is a moot point. However, more significant is the fact that this seems to describe Denon 242 as a 'bivalve' coffin of the late Third Intermediate Period type,30 rather than the earlier kind of cartonnage casing that, as has already been noted, one would have expected if 243 had indeed been owned by Osorkon. Thus for 243 to have been Osorkon's outer coffin one would have to assume that the original cartonnage had been lost and that the outer case had then become associated with a later inner coffin.31 That Osorkon's cartonnage may have been destroyed when his papyri were recovered is not unlikely, given that they presumably had been placed on his mummy,32 and that the extraction of a mummy from such a cartonnage (especially in late eighteenth century 'field' conditions) is very difficult. However, at this distance it is very difficult to go much further with this matter. All one can do is admit that the Denon links make the equation of the isolated lid 243 with what is now NME 838 very tempting, but also confessing that there are a number of issues that might militate against this conclusion. In the present state of knowledge it is unlikely that one will ever be able to go beyond the verdict of 'not proven'. The High Priest of Amun Shoshenq Q Osorkon D's father, the High Priest Shoshenq, is well-attested as a Theban pontiff from various monuments, including featuring in Fragment 34 of the Karnak Priestly Annals, where he inducts one Nespapawtytawy into some office or other.33 The most significant memorial is probably a statue of the Inundation (British Museum EA8: figs 10a, 11), upon which its dedicator is depicted in relief, has his name enclosed in a cartouche, and is provided with a pedigree (fig. 12). This indicates that his parents were a King Osorkon and Maatkare, daughter of King Horpasebakhanut; Maatkare 28 Dubois, Description, 54. 29 Ibid., 53-4. 30 Cf. Taylor, in Strudwick and Taylor (eds), Theban Necropolis, 1 13-16. 31 Which at '5 pieds 3 pouces et demi' (172 cm) high would certainly have fitted within 242. 32 Cf.

Maatkare also lacks the any titles other than the naming of her father. On the other hand, on statue CG 42194 (fig. 10b)35 usurped from a late Eighteenth Dynasty owner for Shoshenq - without a cartouche - Maatkare is given the titles of 'Prophetess of Hathor-Lady-of-On and God's Mother of Horus- Uniter-of-the-Two-Lands' and 'King's Daughter of [...]' - but once again not 'King's Wife'. This piece nevertheless also records Shoshenq's filiation from King Osorkon, which is also recorded on a further (original) statue, CG 42193 (fig. 10c);36 the latter does not, however, mention Shoshenq's mother. The lack of a 'King's Wife' title for Maatkare in all these sources would suggest that she died before King Osorkon's accession to the throne. V'g. 10.

Filiation of High Priest Shoshenq on FA8 That this Osorkon - also named as Shoshenq's father in a Luxor Temple graffito37 - was Sekhemkheperre Osorkon I is nowhere explicitly stated. However, the filiation of Maatkare from 'King Horpasebkhanut' makes it clear that she was the daughter of Tyetkheperure (Hor)Pasebkhanut,38 thus ruling out the Twenty-first Dynasty Osorkon the Elder; Osorkon II is in any case far too late in time. A final monument of Shoshenq is a statue of Bes, the lower part of which is in the Oriental Museum, Durham (N.313).39 This was jointly dedicated by Shoshenq and a son, the Prophet of Amun Harsiese, borne to him by a lady named Nesitanebetashru (B) : Shoshenq must therefore have had at least two wives, the respective mothers of Osorkon D (Nesettawajatakhet) and this Harsiese (A). Additionally, CG 42193 names a certain Iyia as Shoshenq's spouse. Harsiese has in the past been regarded a man who rose to be High Priest under Osorkon II, and then king at Thebes. However, Karl Jansen- Winkeln has argued that as Harsiese is a simple Prophet of Amun on N.3 13, it cannot be used as evidence that he ever rose to the pontificate.40 He also argues that the other alleged attestation 37 The Epigraphic Survey, Reliefs and Inscriptions at Luxor Temple, II: The Facade, Portals, Upper Register Scenes, Columns, Marginalia, and Statuary in the Colonnade Hall (OIP 1 16; Chicago, 1998), 54, pl. 202; PM IP, 313 erroneously states this graffito to have been destroyed. 38 Cf.

Although Durham N. 3 13 and the cartonnage fragments of Iuput B all name him simply as a High Priest, it has been widely surmised that he ended his days as a king. Most propose to identify him with Heqakheperre Shoshenq, reburied in the antechamber of tomb NRT III at Tanis,43 although he has also been identified the 'Maatkheperre' Shoshenq, who appears to be named on Cairo statue CG42192.44 However, while the High Priest Shoshenq is indeed an attractive candidate for being the man who became one of the obscure Shoshenq-kings who can be localised in the earlier Twenty-second Dynasty and are now designated Shoshenq Ila-c,45 the fact remains that none of his descendants proclaim their descent from 'King Shoshenq'; rather, Iuput B finds his royal roots in the person of Shoshenq's father, Osorkon I. While one can resort to special pleading to argue that the apparent brevity/ non-independence/both of the reign of King ex-High Priest Shoshenq (whichever prenomen is applied to him) meant that to his descendants he was High Priest par excellence, rather than an ephemeral king,46 this seems unlikely.47 Further, in the later Third Intermediate Period, statues from the Karnak cachette and coffins of Theban dignitaries include long genealogies that in many cases are clearly intended to show a worthy's royal blood, no matter how watered down it might now be. In such a circumstance, one can hardly imagine Iuput B failing to identify Shoshenq as a king if he had ever been one, no matter how briefly. One might possibly argue that in this context his putative short-lived regality was overlooked in favour of going back to the far better known Osorkon I,48 but given the status-consciousness of the ancient Egyptians, one might at least in this case have expected Shoshenq to have been given a courtesy cartouche, especially as he had used one during his lifetime on statue EA8. 41 PM IP, 148. 42 For King Harsiese as a son of the High Priest Nesibanebdjed III, cf. Jansen-Winkeln, 'The Chronology of the Third Intermediate Period', in R. Krauss, E. Hornung, and D. Warburton (eds), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (HdO I/83; Leiden, 2006), 241 n. 64; my thanks go to aJEA referee for this reference. 43 Cf. TIP3, 1 17-19, and more recently G. P. F. Broekman, 'Shoshenq Maäkheperre and Shoshenq Heqakheperre: Contemplations on the Question of Which of Them (If One of the Two) was Identical with the High Priest of Amun, Shoshenq Son of king Osorkon I', GM 176 (2000), 39-46 (cf. id. 'On the Identity of King Shoshenq Buried in the Vestibule of the Tomb of Psusennes I in Tanis (NRT III). Part II', GM 211 (2006), 11-20; 212 (2007), 9-28). 44 Jansen-Winkeln, JE A 81, 145-8. However, a more common view is that the 'Maatkheperre' is simply an error for 'Hedjkheperre', i.e. Shoshenq I. Cf. Dodson in Broekman, Demarée, and Kaper (eds), The Libyan Period in Egypt, no, 112. 45 Using the respective designations for Heqakheperre, Tutkheperre, and Maatkheperre agreed on 27 October 2007 in the final session of the international conference 'The Libyan Period in Egypt' at Leiden University: see G. P. F. Broekman, R. J. Demarée, and O. E. Kaper, 'The Numbering of the Kings called Shoshenq', GM 216 (2008), 9. 46 Cf. Kitchen, TIP3, 119-20, 545. 47 Kitchen's suggestion (TIP3, 119) that the High Priestly link was more important to Harsiese in view of his own claim to that office seems rather forced, and in any case falls down with the recognition that Harsiese A may never ever have been a High Priest at all. 4 As suggested by a JE A referee.</page><page sequence="14">64 AIDAN DODSON JEA 95 Thus although leaving the antecedents of any of Kings Shoshenq Ila- e unillu- minated,49 it seems most appropriate to take the view that the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq died as a mere pontiff, and was buried as such. Such a conclusion raises the issue of what he should be referred to in short form: unlike his homonyms, the High Priest Shoshenq was never allocated a distinctive letter in the now-standard scheme,50 the High Priest's equation with Heqakheperre being tacitly assumed in his sharing with him the ordinal 'IF. Since one does not wish to disturb the now- 'canonical' sequence of non-regal Shoshenqs,51 nor place him simply at the end of the current sequence as 'H', implying a late chronological placement, the best solu- tion would seem to make him 'Shoshenq Q', using a mid-alphabetic assignment to indicate out-of-sequence usage.52 Dating issues: the Shaamenimes problem We now return to the matter of the dating of Iuput B himself. On a crude 25 -year generation-count, he is likely to have been born around 875 (as the son rather than the grandson of Osorkon D), placing his death probably late in the ninth century, or early in the eighth. This would accord with his cartonnage being one of the latest examples of the 'classic' Design 1. Turning now to Cairo TR 21/1 1/16/5, there seems no basis for Porter and Moss's confident assertion that Shaamenimes's father is to be equated with Takelot II: given the likelihood that the latter served as High Priest of Amun (as Takelot F) before his accession, his title here would push his putative daughter's death back to the earliest years of his career; given that the mummy (on size) seems to be that of an adult, this could create problems with relative ages. Porter and Moss also propose to equate the owner of TR 21/11/16/5 with the Shaamenimes, mother of Meresamenet, who is named on the latter's wooden sarcophagus (CG 41035)53 as the wife of a Prophet of Amun-Re-King-of-the-Gods Osorkon, a son (or possibly grandson) of a King Takelot: cases have been made for the latter being both the second and third of the name.54 If the latter, this Osorkon 49 On Tutkheperre ('Shoshenq lib') as a potential initial prenomen of Shoshenq I, see Dodson, in Broekman, Demarée, and Kaper (eds), The Libyan Period in Egypt, 107-10. 50 Cf. n. 10, above. 51 Cf. the confusion that accompanied the short-lived attempt in the early 1980s to renumber the Kings Osorkon following the identification of Akheperre Osorkon (now 'the Elder') in J. Yoyotte, '"Osorkon fils de Mehytouskhé", un pharaon oublié?', BSFE 77-78 (1 976/1 977), 39-54. 52 We thus would have the following non-royal Shoshenq scheme to supplement the newly-agreed royal one (see n. 46 above): A: Great Chief of the Ma, grandfather of Shoshenq I. B: Great Chief of the Ma, later Shoshenq I. C: High Priest of Ptah, son of Shedsunefertum A. D: High Priest of Ptah, son of Osorkon II. E: Chieftain of Busiris, temp. Piye. F: Chieftain of Busiris, late Twenty-fifth Dynasty. G: High Priest of Amun (at Tanis?), son of Pamiu i (scarab JE 26378: LdR III, 373 n.i). Q: High Priest of Amun at Thebes, son of Osorkon I. 56 A.

On the other hand, in spite of lacking the title of High Priest, Osorkon has also been equated with Takelot IPs son Osorkon B,56 which would place the death of his wife Shaamenimes into the late ninth or early eighth century. The latter of course would make her a contemporary of Iuput B, and account nicely for the close similarity between his cartonnage and TR 21/11/16/5, if the latter's owner were indeed the same Shaamenimes. However, it would have the further effect of placing CG41035 into the middle of the eighth century, rather than the end of the century, where it would fit much more comfortably typologically.57 If, on the other hand, one were to make Shaamenimes the daughter-in-law of Takelot III, her daughter and her sarcophagus would shift into a more appropriate date - but would also pull TR 21/1 1/16/5 to the late eighth century as one of the very latest known cartonnages. However, as we have seen, its design is one that seems to have gone out of use getting on for a century earlier, and shows no sign of sharing any features with the bivalve coffins that were already coming into use by then.58 However, other than the similarity of names, there is in fact no reason to link the Shaamenimes of TR 21/11/16/5 with the mother of Meresamenet of CG 41035: TR 21/11/16/5's texts say nothing about her husband or any offspring. A far more likely candidate for Meresamenet's mother is in any case the owner of a fragmentary sarcophagus and coffin found in the Northern Chapel of Amun on the Upper Terrace of the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari - close to where CG 41035 had been found in 1858.59 One would thus separately identify Shaamenimes A, owner of TR 21/11/16/5 and a contemporary of Iuput B, around the turn of the ninth/eighth centuries; Shaamenimes B, mother of the Meresamenet of CG 41035 and owner of the Deir el-Bahari fragments; and also a Shaamenimes C, owner of a coffin in Rio de Janeiro,60 both of the late eighth century. As for the father of Shaamenimes A, one candidate is thus Takelot C, son of Shoshenq III, who flourished in the late ninth century. However, this Takelot is not as yet attested as a Chief of the Meshwesh,61 and one may thus wish to provisionally 55 Osorkon G is known from (lost) coffin fragments from tomb 27, north-west of the Ramesseum: R.
