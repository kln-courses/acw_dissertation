Zvanya Federal Aviation Administration ABSTRACT A 10-foot-long fuselage section from a Boeing 737-100 airplane was dropped from a height of 14 feet generating a final impact velocity of 30 feet per second. The fuselage section was configured to simulate the load density at the maximum takeoff weight condition. The final weight of 8870 pounds included cabin seats, dummy occupants, overhead stowage bins with contents, and cargo compartment luggage. The fuselage section was instrumented with strain gages, accelerometers, and high-speed cameras. The fuselage sustained severe deformation of the cargo compartment. The luggage influenced the manner in which the fuselage crushed, affecting the gravitational (g) forces experienced by the test section. The seat tracks experienced 15 g's vertical deceleration. Although numerous fuselage structural members fractured during the test, a habitable environment was maintained for the occupants, and the impact was considered survivable. The overhead stowage bins maintained their structural integrity and remained attached to the fuselage. The bins sustained 14 g's vertical deceleration. Distribution of the loads, among the bin supports, was different in the dynamic versus static case. INTRODUCTION On November 29, 2000, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted a vertical impact test of a narrow-body transport airplane fuselage section, which included two different types of in-service overhead stowage bins. The test was conducted at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey. The objective of the test was to evaluate the response behavior of overhead stowage bin installations when subjected to a severe, but survivable, impact condition. Of particular interest is a comparison of the pretest static, steady-state forces that the bins were subjected to during their calibration versus the dynamic forces generated during the impact test. A 10-foot-long fuselage section from a Boeing 737-100 was dropped from a height of 14 feet above a drop test platform, thereby generating a final velocity at impact of 30 feet per second. This is consistent with the vertical velocity change found in the Seat Dynamic Performance Standard in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 25.562(b)(1) [1]. The fuselage section was configured to simulate the load density at the maximum takeoff weight condition. The final weight of 8870 pounds included cabin seats, dummy occupants, overhead stowage bins with contents, and cargo compartment luggage. The fuselage section was instrumented with strain gages, accelerometers, and high-speed cameras. This vertical drop test [2] is one of a series of unique transport fuselage section tests [3 to 6] conducted in support of the FAA's Crash Dynamics and Engineering Development Program [7] regarding the retention of cabin mass items. FUSELAGE TEST SECTION The fuselage test section was a 1 0-foot long section cut from fuselage station (FS) 380 to FS 500 of a Boeing 737-100 transport airplane (figure 1). FIGURE 1. FUSELAGE TEST SECTION (Boeing 737-100 Airplane) 609</page><page sequence="2">The fuselage section included a below-floor cargo compartment with an access door located on the right (copilot) side. The outer floor beams at each of end of the test section were reinforced to minimize the open- end effects, i.e., to simulate the reaction that would be seen if an entire aircraft fuselage was tested. Nonstructural interior liners and insulation were removed from the fuselage test section. The section was equipped with typical cabin seats, overhead stowage bins, and luggage (figure 2). FIGURE 2. TEST SECTION The cabin section was configured with six triple cabin seats placed in three rows. A 36-inch pitch was used on both sides. All the seats were 9-g static-rated seats and contained a mannequin or an anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD). The ATDs are of the Hybrid II type (14 CFR 25.572), representing the 50th percentile male adult passenger. The seats, dummies, and mannequins were used to achieve the desired test section weight (8870 lbs) and provide comparative data to other tests; they were not of primary interest in this test. Two different 60-inch overhead stowage bins were installed in the cabin. A HITCO bin was mounted on the left side between FS 409 and FS 469 and a Heath Tecna bin was mounted on the right side between FS 415 and FS 475. Both bins were loaded with plywood ballast to achieve their placarded maximum weight and centers of gravity (CG). Two Personal Service Units (PSUs - control panels for light, air, etc.) were attached under each bin. The loaded weight of the Hitco and Heath Tecna bins were 257 and 176 lbs, respectively. The bin doors were latched and strapped shut to ensure the bin contents remained inside the bins during the impact. The bins were instrumented with accelerometers and the support attachments were instrumented with strain gage bridges. The cargo area contained 98 bags of luggage (3229 lbs), which were evenly distributed by weight, luggage was held in place by cargo nets that secured in the forward/aft sections of the fuselage. The luggage was held down by cargo straps, which were mounted to the cargo floor, thus preventing any movement during free fall. Figure 3 shows the dynamic drop test facility and fuselage section just prior to the drop test. FIGURE 3. DYNAMIC DROP TEST FACILITY AND FUSELAGE SECTION FUSELAGE SECTION ORIENTATION The fuselage section and the drop test platform were centered below the release hook. The coordinate system for the fuselage section was referenced while standing in and looking toward the front of the fuselage section. The fuselage coordinate system is per manufacturer's specifications. Locations correspond to the distance (inches) from the reference. Thus, FS 420 is 420 inches from the reference point (near the nose of the aircraft) along the longitudinal (x-axis) direction. Distances measured in the lateral direction (y-axis) are referenced from the longitudinal centerline (left -y and right +y). Distances in the vertical direction (z-axis) are referenced from the surface of the cabin floor (above floor +z, below -z). INSTRUMENTATION The total of 127 sensors were used to characterize the reaction of the fuselage and the drop test platform. FUSELAGE The fuselage instrumentation for this test included 32 accelerometers and three contact switches. Accelerometers in the cabin area were located on the sidewall frame sections. They were mounted at two 610</page><page sequence="3">locations, the lower level at 12 inches above the floor and the upper level at either 64 or 70 inches above the floor. The upper accelerometers were located near the overhead stowage bin mounting brackets. Accelerometers were also mounted to the seat tracks at various locations throughout the cabin. Contact switches were used to determine the elapsed time between hook release and the impact of the fuselage onto the drop test platform. One contact switch was mounted to the release hook and the other two were mounted to the bottom of the fuselage. OVERHEAD STOWAGE BINS Instrumented bin supports were used to measure and characterize the reaction of the bins. Critical bin supports were instrumented with strain gages configured and calibrated as load cells. Two types of calibrations were performed: a bin support calibration and a static bin calibration. The bin support calibration was conducted on each bin support to determine the sensitivity of each strain gage bridge. A static calibration of the bin was conducted to provide data for a force balance analysis in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions. The static bin calibration was also conducted to determine the static influence coefficient of each bin support. The static influence coefficient is the relative load of the support in response to an applied static load in the vertical direction. A series of three static load tests were conducted on each bin [2], The empty bins were loaded, unloaded, and support loads recorded. The resulting influence coefficients provided the basis for the comparison of the bin support reactions under static versus dynamic loadings. Five accelerometers were mounted on each bin to measure accelerations and characterize the dynamic response of the bins. One accelerometer was attached to each end of the bin to measure acceleration in the vertical direction. Three accelerometers were mounted to the bottom of the bin in a triaxial configuration. Bin loading in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal directions was determined by summing the vector components of each instrumented bin support. The bin- mounted accelerometers were used to determine the inertial loading in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal directions. The inertial loads were then used to verify the measured loads of the instrumented bin supports. HITCO BIN The Hitco bin was secured to the fuselage by 11 instrumented support links (figure 4). Two tie rods (H1 and H2) and four support links (H3, H5, H7, and H9) were oriented primarily in the vertical direction. The four support links (H4, H6, H8, and H 10) were oriented primarily in the lateral direction. The strut link (H1 1) was oriented primarily to direction. Figure 5 shows an end view of the bin. FIGURE 4. HITCO BIN SCHEMATIC FIGURE 5. HITCO BIN HEATH TECNA BIN The Heath Tecna bin was secured to the fuselage by 1 1 instrumented supports (figure 6). Two vertically mounted struts (HT1 and HT3) and mating supports (HT2 and HT4) were paired and connected in series. These supports were oriented primarily in the vertical direction. The struts were attached to the ends of the bin, and their mating supports were indirectly attached to the fuselage. Figure 7 shows an end view of the bin. FIGURE 6. HEATH TECNA BIN SCHEMATIC 611</page><page sequence="4">FIGURE 7. HEATH TECNA BIN Supports HT5 to HT9 provide for vertical and lateral loading. These supports were mounted to the fuselage frame sections and to a support rail, which was attached to the bin. The bin was attached to the rail at two locations, one adjacent to HT6, and the other between HT8 and HT9. Supports HT10 and HT11 were attached to the rail and to a flange that straddled two frame sections. The primary function of these supports was to react the longitudinal loading of the bin. ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DUMMIES There were six 50th percentile Hybrid II ATDs onboard. All ATDs were instrumented with load cells to measure spinal column axial loading in the lumbar area and accelerometers to measure g forces in the pelvic region. The ATDs were located in the center seats (B and E) of each triple bench at FS 406, 442, and 478. The data obtained was outside the scope of this paper, however it is available in [2], DROP TEST PLATFORM The wooden portion of the platform consisted of 205 wooden planks (15 feet long, 2 inches thick, and 10 inches high). The planks were placed side by side forming a 15 foot wide, 10 inch high, and 36 foot long platform. The planks were bolted together using connected steel rods running the length of the platform. The wooden platform rested on a framework of 12-inch steel I-beams that rested on 12 load cells. Details are available in [2]. The platform load cells were used to measure the impact loads and determine their distribution. Twelve accelerometers were mounted to the bottom of the platform to characterize the platform response to the impact. Platform response was measured because the potential influence it may have on fuselage accelerometer readings. No influence was observed. Thirteen string potentiometers were attached to the bottom of the platform to measure platform displacement. Platform data obtained was outside the scope of this paper, however it is available in [2], VISUAL IMAGING Eleven high-speed (H/S) film cameras (500 frames per second) were used to record the test. Four of the cameras were onboard the fuselage section to record the reaction of the bin supports. The remaining seven cameras were located around the exterior of the fuselage section and provided overall coverage of the fuselage section and areas of interest. All the cameras recorded date and time, which was supplied by a satellite-based time code receiver. This allowed for the precision time stamping of each frame of film and provided a means to synchronize the time among all cameras as well as the recorded data. Seven standard video cameras (30 frames per second) were also located around the exterior of the fuselage section to provide overall coverage of the test. DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS Two data acquisition systems were used to collect test data. A pulse generated by a satellite-based time code receiver was used to synchronize the two systems to the high-speed film. The systems simultaneously sampled data at 10,000 samples per second per channel. All data channels were prefiltered at a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz. DATA REDUCTION For the purposes of this test, Time Zero (T0) was defined as the moment of impact as observed on the high-speed film and confirmed via the recorded data. An SAE J211 class 600 (1000 Hz) digital filter [8] was used to filter the ATD load cell data. An SAE J21 1 class 60 (100 Hz) digital filter was used to filter all the other sensor data. However, the use of this filter did not provide adequate filtering to determine the fundamental accelerometer pulse shape. Posttest analysis of the fuselage and bin acceleration data indicated that the data exhibited large swings in value. These swings greatly influenced the pulse shape and amplitude, yet had a minimum affect on the fuselage and bin structural response. A 20-Hz digital filter was designed using SAE J211 guidelines to remove unwanted signals and provide the needed pulse definition. The use of a 20-Hz filter was justified because the integrated filtered pulse yielded the same velocity value as the unfiltered data and 100-Hz filtered data [9]. Twenty-Hz filtered 612</page><page sequence="5">accelerometer data was used for the sidewall, seat tracks, and bin accelerations unless otherwise noted. DATA ANALYSIS TIME TO IMPACT The calculated impact velocity using the elapsed time data provided from the contact switches (935 and 936 msec) was 30 fps. The times of the two contact switches indicate that the test section was relatively level, prior to impact with the test platform. These values matched the theoretical values of a free-falling body traveling 14 feet (30 fps, 933 msec). FUSELAGE ACCELERATION Fuselage acceleration data are presented in two groups: sidewall vertical accelerations and seat track vertical accelerations. Typical sidewall and seat track accelerations and velocity changes are shown in figures 8 through 10. Fuselage data is given in terms of four parameters: pulse duration (At), maximum acceleration (Gmax), peak acceleration (G^J, and time of peak acceleration (t^J. The Gmax values were computed based on an idealized triangular pulse assumption Gma, = 2^ (1) Where At is the difference between the start and stop times of the integration interval, and AV is the velocity change determined by integrating the acceleration data during At. All accelerations are in the vertical direction unless otherwise noted. The fundamental impact pulse (20-Hz data) represents the overall impact response. The primary impact pulse represents the most significant pulse within the fundamental impact response. FIGURE 8. TYPICAL SIDEWALL VERTICAL ACCEL. FIGURE 9. TYPICAL SEAT TRACK VERTICAL ACCEL.

TYPICAL SEAT TRACK AND SIDEWALL VERTICAL VELOCITY CHANGE SIDEWALL VERTICAL ACCELERATIONS The sidewall accelerations are presented in four groups: left upper accelerations, left lower accelerations, right upper accelerations, and right lower accelerations. The graphs of each group are shown in figures 1 1 to 14. FIGURE 1 1 . LEFT UPPER SIDEWALL VERTICAL ACCEL. (20 Hz) 613</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 12 . LEFT LOWER SIDEWALL VERTICAL ACCEL.

(20 Hz) The left sidewall fuselage acceleration data shows two small peaks preceding the major peak, which occurred at approximately 109 milliseconds after impact. The right sidewall fuselage acceleration data shows only a single small peak preceding the major peak, which occurred at approximately 77 milliseconds after impact. This could indicate that the cargo door located on the right-hand side affected the fuselage accelerations. The sidewall acceleration results, fundamental impact pulse, and primary/major impact pulse, are shown in table 1 . TABLE 1.

SEAT TRACK VERTICAL ACCELERATIONS The seat track accelerations are also presented in four groups: left inner seat track, left outer seat track, right inner seat track, and right outer seat track accelerations. The graphs of each group are shown in figures 15 to 18. FIGURE 15. LEFT INNER SEAT TRACK VERTICAL ACCEL. (20 Hz) FIGURE 1 6.

However, the multiple peaks on the left seat track accelerations are not as obvious as shown in the sidewall data. The vertical seat track acceleration results are given in table 2. TABLE 2.

Also, the rigidity and stiffness of the frame surrounding the cargo door resulted in a higher for the seat track accelerations on the right side. The seat track acceleration data indicate that they experienced an impact pulse of approximately 15 g's (GmJ of approximately 135 milliseconds duration. BIN ANALYSIS The bin data consists of the measured load values, represented in pounds, and acceleration data, represented in g's. Measured loads are strain gage bridge data that refer to the reacted loads of the bin supports and their corresponding vector components. All load data was filtered with a 1 00 Hz filter. Calculated loads (CALJ for each support are based on strain gage bridge data and is defined by CaL = (ZFJIJ (2) where XF is the sum of the vertical (z direction) vector component loads of the bin and /, is the corresponding static influence coefficient for the designated support determined from vertical static calibration load tests. Inertial loads (lnbin) for each bin are based on 20 Hz accelerometer data and is defined by the kinematic equation ( = - (a) (3) V9J where w/g is the mass of the bin and its contents, and a is the directional acceleration. When calculating the inertial load in the vertical direction, "a" is the average value of the three vertical oriented bin accelerometers. Calculated loads (Calg) for each support are based on measured accelerometer data and is defined by Cal, = (lnbjn)(ls) (4) During the test the dynamic influence coefficient (/„) at any given time, for any support in the z direction, was calculated by dividing the vertical vector load (FJ of each link by the total vertical vector load (XF,) of the bin, using the equation 615</page><page sequence="8">ef2 HITCO BIN The bin was attached to the fuselage by 11 links. The bin and all mounting links remained intact during and after the test. A posttest inspection of the bin and the links showed no damage. The measured peak load during the test for each of the 1 1 links is shown in table 3. TABLE 3.

Links H1 and H2 are identical and carry the primary loads in the vertical direction. These links were identified as having the greatest probability of failure during the test. The failure load of these links was determined by testing to be 4500 lbs. However, as shown in table 3, the maximum load experienced by either link was 1237 lbs. This was well below the failure limit. The measured link loads were reduced into their vector component loads along the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal axes of the fuselage section. Table 4 shows the vector component link loads at maximum bin loading during the test. TABLE 4.

Figure 22 shows two significant pulses occurring at 27 and 102 msec after T0. These are attributable to the unique crushing of the fuselage on the right side. FIGURE 22.

The cabin floor beams and seat tracks showed no damage after impact. However, the fuselage experienced damage in cabin sidewall, crown, and cargo areas. Due to the weights of the bins, cameras, and camera mounts, all the frames from FS 380 through FS 500 were fractured at locations (y,z) = (-59", 54") and (y,z) = (59", 54") (figure 25). The frame at FS 380 also showed two additional fractures at locations (y,z) = (-28", 86") and (y,z) = (-45", 75"). Two other fractures occurred on the FS 400 frame at the locations where the camera mount legs were attached. High-speed photography showed that during the event the fuselage area located just under the left camera mount deflected approximately 6 inches into the cabin area. 618</page><page sequence="11">FIGURE 25. POSTTEST TEST SECTION The cargo area experienced severe permanent deformation due to impact with the platform. This resulted in multiple fractures of the cargo frames as shown in figure 25. The left side experienced 23 inches of static crush in the front and 27.5 inches aft. The right side experienced 15.8 inches of static crush in the front and 18.4 inches aft. This difference was due to the support provided by the rigid and stiff reinforced cargo door frame on the right side. This is further reinforced by a review of the high-speed film that showed the fuselage section impacted the platform at a level attitude. After which the crush on the right side eventually stopped, while the crush on the left side continued for some time. This resulted in the buckling of the fuselage on the left side. The static and dynamic deformation of the cargo area is shown in table 9. The luggage in the cargo area provided a load path that influenced the g forces experienced by the test section and the manner in which the fuselage crushed. TABLE 9.

OVERHEAD STOWAGE BINS The bins, their supports and fuselage attachment points showed no signs of damage. Reviews of the recorded data showed no signs of any abnormalities and were considered representative of the test. Using the integrated bin accelerometer data, the calculated impact velocity was 30 ft/sec for both bins. This was equal to the fuselage impact velocity. Using load data, the Hitco bin and the Heath Tecna bin sustained 13 and 14 g's in the vertical direction respectively (maximum measured total vertical vector load divided by the loaded bin weight (equation 3)). Using accelerometer data filtered at 20 Hz, the Hitco and Heath Tecna bins sustained approximately 10 and 11 g's, respectively, in the vertical direction. Using accelerometer data filtered at 100 Hz, they sustained 12 and 17 g's, respectively, in the vertical direction. A comparison between the total measured vertical load and the vertical inertial load for both bins (figures 19 and 22) shows generally good agreement. Therefore, the measured vertical vector loads were deemed valid and used for static versus dynamic comparisons of bin loading. The Hitco bin accelerometers and the fuselage sidewall- mounted links mimicked the fuselage accelerometer response on the left side with three major pulses. However, the two primary links H1 and H2 only experienced two major pulses not three. The localized deformation of the fuselage's upper left side may have influenced the loading. On the right side, the response of the Heath Tecna bin accelerometers and supports showed the same two major pulses as seen by the fuselage accelerometers. During the static load calibration of the overhead bins, the fuselage and bins behaved as a rigid body, resulting in minimum structural deformation. However, during the crash test, the fuselage section may be considered a nonrigid body as evidenced by the severe structural deformation of the fuselage. This deformation (flexing, bending, asymmetrical crushing of the fuselage, etc.), as well as the introduction of a lateral load component, resulted in differences between static and dynamic loading of the bins and their supports as shown in tables 10 and 11 for the Hitco and Heath Tecna bin, respectively.

Table 10 shows the static and dynamic vertical influence coefficients just prior to impact (preimpact, -1 g), at 5-g static equivalent bin loading and at max g bin loading. LOAD CAPABILTY The data show that this bin was able to support, without failure, dynamic loads in excess of twice the static load certification requirement. Maximum dynamic loading of critical supports H1 and H2 was at approximately 30% of failure load. HEATH TECNA BIN COMPARISON OF DYNAMIC VS STATIC LOADING A comparison of static and dynamic vertical loading for each link using Ca/m, Calg, and measured loads show good overall agreement [2]. Support HT1 is shown in figure 27. FIGURE 27. HEATH TECNA BIN HT1 - VERTICAL COMPONENT LOAD However, the corresponding static and dynamic influence coefficients at selected conditions are different. Table 11 shows the static and dynamic vertical influence coefficients just prior to impact (preimpact, -1 g), at 5-g static equivalent bin loading and at max g bin loading. LOAD CAPABILTY The data show that this bin was able to support without failure, dynamic loads in excess of twice the static load certification requirement. Maximum dynamic loading of critical supports HT2 and HT4 was at approximately 70% of failure load. CONCLUSION A narrow-body transport fuselage section with overhead stowage bins was dropped from a height of 14 feet resulting in a vertical impact velocity of 30 fps. This resulted in what was considered a severe, but survivable, impact condition. 620</page><page sequence="13">FUSELAGE The 1 0-foot-long fuselage test section sustained severe nonsymmetrical damage. The left side crushed approximately 2 feet; the right side, which included a cargo door and its associated reinforced doorframe, crushed 1.5 feet. Luggage, which was located in the cargo compartment, influenced the manner in which the fuselage crushed, affecting the g forces experienced by the test section. The cargo compartment also sustained a series of frame fractures, two in the middle of the fuselage, one on the bottom right side, and two on the left. All the frames in the upper cabin area were fractured due to the deflection of the upper fuselage caused by the weight of the bins, cameras, and camera mounts. However, a habitable environment was maintained for the occupants. The seat tracks experienced a vertical impact pulse of approximately 15 g's and a pulse duration of approximately 135 msec. HITCO OVERHEAD STOWAGE BIN The Hitco bin and its support links maintained their structural integrity and remained attached to the fuselage. The Hitco bin sustained a 13-g vertical load factor during the test. A comparison between the total measured vertical load and the vertical inertial bin load generally showed good agreement. The load distribution among the Hitco bin links was different in the dynamic case versus the static case. The results are influenced by the difference in static and dynamic deformation as well as a lateral load component experienced by the bins and fuselage during the test. The Hitco bin was able to support dynamic loads in excess of twice the static load certification requirement. Maximum dynamic loading of critical supports H1 and H2 was at approximately 30% of failure load. HEATH TECNA OVERHEAD STOWAGE BIN The Heath Tecna bin and its supports maintained their structural integrity and remained attached to the fuselage. The Heath Tecna bin sustained a 14-g vertical load factor during the test. A comparison between the total measured vertical load and the vertical inertial bin load generally showed good agreement. The load distribution among the Heath Tecna bin supports was different in the dynamic case versus the static case. The results are influenced by the difference in static and dynamic deformation as well as a lateral load component experienced by the bins and fuselage during the test. The Heath Tecna bin was able to support dynamic loads in excess of twice the static load certification requirement. Maximum dynamic loading of critical supports HT2 and HT4 was at approximately 70% of failure load.
