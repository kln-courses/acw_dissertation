A paper read at the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. Controversy is always most acute where facts are fewest. In recent years our knowledge bear- ing on the evolution of man has accumulated in great quantities, but it is as yet inadequate to secure agreement on matters of detail. Hence the evolutionary history of man still remains a [1]</page><page sequence="2">No. 2] MAN [January, 1935. controversial problem. Nevertheless, it is convenienit, and, indeed, necessary, to review from time to time the evidence relatinig to this problem with the object of ascertaining how far we have advanced towards its ultimate solition and to what extent we are in agreement in the interpretation of the relevant facts of which we are now in possession. That man is one of the evolutionarv products of a particular group of placental mammals called Primates is accepted by all biologists. The progress of knowledge has long passed the stage at which the evidence for this conception requires to be stated at an anthropological congress. It is reasonably certain that placental mammals came into existence in the middle of the mesozoic period, and it is probable (as Dr. G. G. Simpson has shown) that they were derived from a group of Jurassic mammals known as the Pantotheria. It is also probable that in the Cretaceous period the ancestral or basal Primate stock became segregated from the generalized mammalian group which also gave rise to the other placental orders, and that from that time it entered upon an independent evolutionary history. The evidence suggests that one of the sub-orders of the Primates, the Lemuroidea, represented to-day by the lemurs, lorises, galagoes and pottos, branched off from the basal Primate stock at an extremely early stage, at least at the very- beginning of the tertiary period. This group followed rather specialized trends of evolution which mark them off sharply from the other Primates. It is unlikely, indeed, that the Lemuroidea could have provided a basis for the evolutionary origin of the higher Primates, although some authorities believe this was the case. The remarkable thing is that in the later stages of their evolution some of the Lemuroidea became astonishingly monkey-like in many of their skeletal and dental characters. But these anthropoid features were superimposed on elharacteristically lemuroid specializations which were avoided in the true monkeys and, moreover, true monkeys are known to have come into existence at an earlier geological time. It is important, however, to note this manifes- tation of parallelism in the evolutionary history of the lemurs and monkeys, partly because it indicates that these two groups were derived from a common ancestral stock which endowed them with very similar evolutionary tendencies, the basal Primate stock, and partly because it illustrates a pheno- menon which is now known to have been very common in organic evolution. Within the limits of the Lemuroidea, parallelism is instanced in a very striking fashion between the lemuriformes and lorisi- formes and between the fossil Adapinae and Notharctinme. From the basal Primate stock there also arose another sub-order of the Primates, the Tarsioidea, represented to-day by one genus only, Tarsius. The evolutionary tendencies of this group approxi- mated much more closely to those of the higher Primates, and it is not improbable that the latter arose from fossil tarsioids in Eocene times, perhaps from a group known as the Microchoeridae, in which certain features of the skull and dentition became remarkably pithecoid. Nevertheless, the Tar- sioidea as a whole were early characterized by peculiar specializations of their own, such as the enlarge- ment of the orbits and the modification of the hind limbs for jumping. These specializations must certainly have led them off the main stem of evolution of the higher Primates, and the latter presum- ably took their origin from the earliest and most primitive members of the group. Again, we may note that at least some of the resemblances which the tarsioids show to the monkeys owe their origin to parallel evolution. This is probably the case with some of the features of the brain and skull, for instance. The third sub-order of the Primates, the Anthropoidea, is represented by the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine monkeys, the Anthropomorphous Apes, and Man. The evidence at hand suggests that the monkeys diverged from the main stem of evolution which led to higher types very soon after the tarsioid phase had been passed. It has been reasonably argued that the Old and New World monkeys may even have been derived independently from separate tarsioid ancestors. It is at least certain, on morphological and physiological grounds, that these two pithecoid groups have undergone a prolonged period of independent evolution, and the supposition is that they diverged at a time when the common ancestor was at least as primitive as the small marmosets. Yet in their skeletal, visceral and cerebral anatomy, the larger Platyrrhines and Catarrhines are astonishingly similar-the result, evidently, of parallel evolution. Of all the Primates, the anthropomorphous apes stand nearest to Man structurally. There is no room for argument on this point. The accumulation of evidence in recent years has served to emphasize [ 2 ]</page><page sequence="3">January, 1935.] MAN [No. 2 the fact that in the sum of his anatomical characters, Man is closely approached only by the anthropoid apes. This leads to an a priori assumption that Man and the anthropoid apes have been derived, whether relatively late in geological time or relatively early, from a common ancestral stock. It is necessary to examine this assumption closely in order to test its validity. It may be argued, indeed it has been argued, that the resemblances between Man and the anthropoid apes are largely fortuitous, the result of parallel evolution. We have already noted that parallelism in the phylogenesis of the Primates is a common phenomenon, and it requires to be excluded before conclusions regarding sys- tematic affinity can certainly be drawn. Granting that structurally Man is very closely akin to the anthropoid apes, is there any serious discrepancy or divergence in any of their anatomical characters which necessarily presupposes a polyphyletic origin from a common ancestor so distant and generalized that it would not come into the category of the Anthropomorpha ? From the evidence at present available, there is no reason to believe that this was the case. A searching analysis of human mor- phology leads to the inevitable conclusion that in the structure and form of the brain, the skull, the dentition and other systems, the human stem must have passed through a phase of evolution in which it so closely resembled the known anthropoid apes that it is necessary to postulate an anthropomorph ancestry for modern Man. This is not to say, of course, that in the line of human descent there was ever a form which showed the characteristic specializations of the modern anthropoid apes such as the great elongation of the arms and the degeneration of the thumbs. It is certain that the earlier anthropomorphs were relatively generalized creatures in which the primitive proportions of the limbs were still retained, and yet, at the same time, they would have shown a grade of development of brain, skull, dentition, etc., which, without imposing any strain on commonly accepted definitions, would entitle them to be called 'anthropoid apes.' There is every reason to suppose that Man was initially derived from such a type. It is not possible here to enter into the detailed evidence for this statement. We may, however, refer to the evidence of foot structure, because some authorities have found it difficult to accept the thesis that the human foot has been derived from the kind of foot which is essentially typical of the Anthropomorpha. This question has been definitely settled, I think, by the studies of Dr. Morton in America. This author has shown that the great development of the inner border of the human foot, accompanied by hypertrophy of the big toe, can only be satisfactorily explained by supposing that at some phase in human phylogenesis the functional axis became trans- ferred from its primitive position along the middle of the foot to its medial border. Such a displace- ment of the functional axis is characteristic of the anthropoid ape type of foot and is directly associated with an arboreal grasping function. Further, structural features of the foot of modern Man, such as the torsion of the shaft of the first metatarsal bone, the shape of its proximal articular facet, and the persistence of all the necessary musculature, provide convincing corroborative evidence of its derivation from a foot which was at one time used for grasping purposes. The next question is-at what stage in the evolutionary differentiation of the Anthropomorpha did the human stem become segregated from that which led to the modern anthropoid apes? Let us consider first the evidence bearing on the origin of the Anthropomorpha. The mandible and lower dentition of the fossil Parapithecus of lower Oligocene age are regarded by most authorities as represent- ing a small and very generalized member of the Anthropomorpha which may possibly have formed the basis for the evolutionary development of all the later types. In its general appearance this fragment recalls some of the features of the Tarsioidea. It therefore raises the possibility that the Anthropo- morpha were derived directly from a tarsioid ancestry at the beginning of tertiary times. If this is so, the phylogenetic position of the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine monkeys requires consideration. These monkeys manifest a number of aberrant specializations which were avoided by the Anthropomorpha, and presumably separated from the main stem of the latter at an early stage. It may be deemed appropriate to extend the term Anthropomorpha to those forms which, originating directly from a tarsioid stock, preserved a relatively generalized structure which enabled them to progress towards the higher types represented by the anthropoid apes and Man. In this case, the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine monkeys are perhaps to be regarded as precocious and somewhat specialized offshoots of the anthropomorphous stock. Even so, the early Anthropomorpha must have passed through phases of evolution in which they exhibited a developmental status equivalent to that of the modern New [ 3 ]</page><page sequence="4">No 2] MAN [January, 1935. and Old World monkeys though avoiding their specializations. In this sense, it can be said that they passed through 'Platyrrhine' and 'Catarrhine' stages of phylogenesis. Of the same geological age as Parapithecus is the fossil jaw of an anthropoid ape, Propliopithecus. So closely do the mandible and teeth of this animal resemble those of the modern gibbon that it is included in the same family, the Hylobatide. Thus we have evidence that, at this early time, the anthropoid apes were already undergoing rapid differentiation. In Miocene times, large anthropoid apes were widespread, being represented by a number of genera of which the most important is the generalized form Dryopithecus. This genus is known from the remains of several species. Some of these, in their dentition, show a significant approach to the Hominide and, as the extensive researches of Professor Gregory have proved, the human dentition was almost certainly derived from the Dryo- pithecus type. It is, in fact, generally conceived that Man arose in Miocene times from a Dryopithecus stock which also gave rise to the modern African anthropoid apes. This interpretation harmonizes satisfactorily with the general scheme of evolution suggested by Pleistocene forms of Man, such as Pitheccanthropus and Sinanthropus, which in many ways provide a structural link between Homo and the anthropoid apes, and also by the close morphological resemblances between modern Man and the gorilia and chimpanzee. But there are other facts which indicate a rather different conception. The recent discoveries of Dr. Leakey suggest that modern types of Man were already in existence while Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus were still living in the Far East. Again, Dr. Hopwood has described the remains of a fossil chimpanzee from the lower Miocene of East Africa which so closely resembled the modern chimpanzee that some authorities have doubted whether it can be distinguished generically. If chimpanzees were already differentiated in lower Miocene times, they could hardly have taken their origin in common with the human stem from a Dryopithecus group of Miocene age. This evidence suggests strongly that the human stem diverged from the line of evolution which led to the A:frican apes at a much earlier time. There is some valuable anatomical evidence which bears directly on this question. I refer again to the studies of Dr. Morton on the foot structure, which seem to me to be of paramount importance. It is a matter of observation that in the large anthropoid apes the develop- ment of the powerful shoulders and long upper extremities and the weakening of the hind limbs lead to a shifting forwards of the centre of gravity of the body, so that when these animals attempt to adopt a terrestrial gait and balance themselves upon their hind limbs the weight of the body is transmitted forwards mainly to the fore part of the foot. This leads to a characteristic distortion of the anterior tarsal elements, and, in consequence, the foot becomes quite incapable of adaptation for true bipedal progression. The distortion of the tarsal bones has been avoided in Man, in whom their proportions approach much more the generalized condition shown in the small gibbon. The larger an arboreal anthropoid ape becomes, the more impossible is it for the animal to adopt an erect postlure on the ground because of the forward displacement of its centre of gravity, and the more impossible, therefore, is it for such a form to provide a basis for the evolution of Man. Morton has pointed out that the terrestrial posture in the modern large apes is a " semi-erect quadrupedalism, and not a semi-erect bipedalism." The inference follows that the progenitors of Man must have left the trees for a terrestrial habitat when they were still relatively small and agile creatures-hardly larger than the modern gibbon, that is to say, before sheer weight of body on an arboreal grasping type of foot had produced a distortion of its skeletal elements. There is corroborative evidence which suggests that the ancestors of Man forsook an arboreal habitat qnite early. Prolonged arboreal existence in the case of the anthropoid apes has led to aberrant specializations, such as the extreme lengthening of the fore lmbs, an atrophy of the thumb, and a shrinkage of the hind limbs. This is more than a mere change in the proportions of the limb segments. We may note, for instance, that one of the most important muscles of the thumb, the flexor longus pollicis, is greatly reduced or absent in most gorillas and orang-utans, and in a large percentage of chimpanzees. Such divergent modifications have been avoided by the human stock which, in this regard, preserves a more generalized and primitive condition. If these modifications are a necessary concomitant of brachiating habits-that is to say, using the arms for swinging from bough to bough-it is unlikely that the direct ancestors of Man practised brachiation to any great degree. It is probable, indeed, that the distinguishing human characters of the limbs are of much [ 4]</page><page sequence="5">January, 1935.1 MAN [No. 2 more ancient origin than is generally thought to be the case. In the first place, this conclusion is in harmony with the palaeontological evidence that the characteristic features of the limbs of the main groups of the Primates were acquired very early. The limbs of the Eocene lemurs were already remark- ably similar to those of modern lemurs, even though the skull, dentition and brain of the former were still very primitive, while the tarsioids evidently began to acquire the peculiar modifications of their hind limbs in the early part of the Eocene. In the second place, it is very noteworthy that in the early types of Man represented by Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus, in which the skull and brain were astonishingly ape-like in their general features, the few fragmentary remains available show that their limb structure was closely comparable or even identical with that of Homo sapiens. This is evidenced by the femur in the case of Pithecanthropus, and by the clavicle, radius, and semi-lunar bone in the Pekin fossil. These observations suggest strongly that in the evolution of Man the limbs attained to human proportions in advance 6f other parts of the body. Now, if the human stem diverged from that leading to the great anthropoid apes at a stage when the common ancestor was still a comparatively small animal, it follows that many of the strikingly human characters of the large African apes which are directly related to their size, such as the details of the brain and skeleton, must owe their origin to parallel evolution. There is no reason why this should not be the case. It is recognized by some authorities that, in spite of their remarkable structural similarities, the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine monkeys may have had a diphyletic origin from separate tarsioid ancestors, or at least they have undergone a very long period of phylogenetic independence. Equivalent degrees of structural similarities between Man and the African apes need not therefore preclude the probability of their diphyletic origin from a stage of evolution represented approximately by the gibbon. The supposition that the human stem may have become segregated from that leading to the gorilla and chimpanzee at a hylobatid rather than at a giant anthropoid level of phylogenesis demands serious attention. It harmonizes with the fact that the gibbon is the only animal which shows an erect bipedalism immediately comparable with that of Man, and this, after all, is one of the most distinctive attributes of the Hominidae. It is perhaps not without significance, also, that the general cranial form of ancient types of Man, such as Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus, recalls that of the gibbon rather than the large apes. Indeed, as is well known, it has even been suggested that Pithecan- thropus was not a man at all, but a huge gibbon, and that it should be renamed Hylobates giganticus. Actually, the hominid status of this fossil is sufficiently attested by the characters of the brain and femur. Turning now to the evidence of the fossil remains of Man, we may note that the most archaic types (structurally speaking) of the Hominidae are represented by Pithecanthropus, Sinanthropus and Eoanthropus. In view of the discovery that a modern type of Man apparently existed in Africa very early in Pleistocene times, however, it may be doubted whether these other fossils bear any close relation to the evolutionary development of Homo. There is no doubt that Neanderthal Man has been rather misleading to students of human phylogeny. At first the ape-like characters of the skeleton of this extinct race suggested very strongly that it might represent somewhat of a transitional stage between Homo sapiens and an anthropomorph ancestor. It is now realized that it existed too late in geological time to fulfil this role and, moreover, in several features, such as the dentition and the development of the supraorbital torus, it is too specialized. In fact, the more recently acquired evidence indicates that the Neanderthal race arose comparatively late in Pleistocene times as a secondary retrogression from a stock much more akin to Homo sapiens. The Ehringsdorf skull, found in 1925, was associated with a culture which has been regarded as pre-Mousterian or Levalloisian. The Galilee skull is believed to be of approximately the same age. Hence, both these types are much older than, for instance, the well-known La Chapelle skull. Yet in some of their cranial characters, and especially the contour of the cranial vault, they are less distinctively ' Neanderthaloid ' and approximate more nearly to Homo sapiens. If modern types of Man came into existence so early as the beginning of the Pleistocene age, whence were they derived ? It seems extremely probable that the direct ancestors of Man are to be found among the Miocene forms of Dryopithecus. If this is so, however, it is almost certain, for the reasons [ 5 ]</page><page sequence="6">Nos. 2-3] MAN [January, 1935. advanced above, that the Dryopithecine line of evolution leading to Man had already at a considerably earlier time become distinct from the line leading to the modern large anthropoid apes. The remains of Dryopithecu8 are almost entirely limited to jaws and teeth, and it has been surmised that the skull of this genus was probably not unlike that of the African apes. Future discoveries may show, however, that in skull form and limb structure Dryopithecus manifested progressive characters foreshadowing to a much greater degree those of the Hominidae. In this regard, we may take a warning from Eoanthropus. If the jaw only of this fossil had been found, it would certainly have been endowed in a reconstruction with a cranium closely resembling that of a chimpanzee. The only fragment of the lower extremity which has been ascribed to Dryopithecus is a femur from the lower Pliocene of Eppelsheim. Originally referred to Dryopithecus rhenanus, this bone has been shown to be very similar to the gibbon type of femur, and in order to accommodate it a new genus has been created, Paidopithex or Pliohylo- bates. Karl Pearson has proved, however, that the owner of this thigh bone must have stood between the orang and chimpanzee in point of size. No gibbon of such a stature has ever been discovered. It seems reasonable to accept Schlosser's opinion that the Eppelsheim femur really belongs to Dryo- pithecIus, especially as this authority showed that in its general contour it harmonizes so well with the humerus of Dryopithecus fontani described by Lartet. If this interpretation is correct, it indicates that Dryopithecus was much more adept in erect bipedalism than any of the large anthropoid apes of to-day. It lends further support, therefore, to the conception that the precursors of the gorilla and chimpanzee had set off on their own evolutionary adventures some considerable time before the Dryo- pithecine precursors of Man had come on to the scene.
