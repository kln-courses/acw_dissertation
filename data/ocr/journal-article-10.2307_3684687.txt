<plain_text><page sequence="1">210 Reviews Silverman, Hugh. Inscriptions: Between Phenomenology and Structuralism. New York &amp; London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1987. Pp. 390. In both of the disciplines with which this book and its author are prin- cipally concerned-philosophy and literary criticism-"methodological" com- mitments are always haunted by the decisionism or performativity it is their purpose to disavow and/or to legitimate. Despite the counter-factual rationalism to which we all-some more, some less critically-adhere, these commitments are never the final result of an unbiased and complete considera- tion of what the history of 20th-century thought has actually given us to think. Given this situation, Silverman's project of establishing some sort of mediation between phenomenology and structuralism constitutes a doubly haunted, doubly haunting, and to this extent salutary intervention, if not exactly a solution to the dilemmas of the phenomenological and structuralist decisions. It reminds those of us-like myself-whose allegiances lie with (post)struc- turalism, that it is not possible to evaluate the claims of the (post)structuralist displacement in continental philosophy without a thorough knowledge of the phenomenological and existentialist traditions that have been the background and the object of that displacement. In this, moreover, Silverman's project is in line with certain contemporary tendencies in France toward a return to the phenomenological "sources." Conversely, it reminds others that phenomenol- ogy, hermeneutics, and existentialism can today be read responsibly only through their (post)structuralist interruption. Thus it gives us pause to recall what either a precipitous attraction to or a precipitous rejection of (post)struc- turalism in the name of phenomenology-hermeneutics-existentialism may have caused us to forget. While it does not speak directly to the concerns of new historicism, feminism, or neo-pragmatism, Silverman's book might also remind those who favor these directions that hermeneutics has its own answer of sorts to what they often seem to find the arbitrarily and excessively paralyz- ing or disenfranchising results of (post)structuralism, especially in its deconstructionist variant. The positive proposal which specifies Silverman's reminder is that of "a theory of incorporated self-decentering, an interpretive topology, or a her- meneutic semiology, in short,. . . a theory of textuality" (9). The reader is guided toward insight into the necessity of such a "hermeneutic semiology" by means of a series of essays on Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, Piaget, Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida. Needless to say, this is an ambitious trajectory. It is therefore not surprising that Silverman's erudition is not always matched, in his comparative and evaluatory recapitulations of these thinkers' positions, by an equally satisfying rigor. (One might instructively compare this book with the work of Manfred Frank or Jochen H risch, both of whom have, in recent years, reread hermeneutics through semiology and its post-semi- ological avatars.) Indeed, one frequently has the distressing impression, while</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 211 reading Silverman's book, that he is not quite equal--but who would be?-to the difficulty of the problems he, and also his profession, have made it his task to solve, or to the extraordinary breadth of the textual and conceptual surface over which his attention is dispersed. This impression imposes itself first of all by means of a certain diffuseness and inelegance on the level of style: dangling modifiers proliferate, surprising metaphors are suddenly introduced and then fail to be developed, and the text implicitly addresses itself-alternately and through abrupt transitions-on the one hand, to a beginner to whom the most elementary points must be made explicit and, on the other, to an advanced reader of philosophy capable of following sudden unmediated leaps and violent interpretive moves. But more importantly (if somewhat less irritating- ly), Silverman's difficulties present themselves not only on the level of style, but also on the level of argumentation. Before concentrating on the "hermeneutic semiology" he ultimately proposes, let me indicate several passages in which these difficulties manifest themselves through a certain vague wavering in Silverman's stance. In the second chapter, by means of which he begins to pass from a summary of Husserl's notion of "self" to a summary of Merleau-Ponty's notion of "am- biguity," Silverman provides Heidegger's explication of the relations between Dasein, Verstehen, and Zeitlichkeit (being-there, understanding, and tem- porality) with "the name" of "existential ambiguity" (29), on the basis of the argument that human being is for Heidegger "both subject and object" (35). One is initially somewhat baffled by the extreme rapidity with which Silverman brushes aside (31) Heidegger's own account of Zweideutigkeit, or ambiguity, in order to accomodate his own notion of ambiguity, especially since the thrust of Sein und Zeit would seem to be that Dasein is neither a subject nor an object-not that it is ambiguously both. As one reads chapters five through nine on Merleau- Ponty, however, one begins to realize that the notion of ambiguity has been transferred back from Merleau-Ponty onto Heidegger. If this realization does not quite justify the transfer, it at least perhaps explains what Silverman has in mind. The reading into Heidegger of Merleau-Ponty becomes particularly ex- plicit in chapter seven where Silverman juxtaposes Merleau-Ponty's lectures on "Philosophy and Non-Philosophy since Hegel"- of which Silverman is the English translator--with Heidegger's essay on "Hegels Begriff der Erfahrung," an essay with which Merleau-Ponty was working as he wrote his lectures. Silverman's conclusion in this chapter--"The truth of the ontological dif- ference is the experience of visibility" (122)-although doubtless worthy of serious consideration, seems less than persuasively justified by his arguments, which, incidentally, ignore the incomparably precise essay by Andrzej War- minski on Heidegger's Hegel-essay first published as: "Reading Parentheses: Hegel by Heidegger," (Genre, Winter 1983: 389-403). Merleau-Ponty not only dominates Silverman's reading of Heidegger but is finally far more important for Silverman's attempt to mediate between SubStance N0 62/63, 1990</page><page sequence="3">212 Reviews phenomenology and structuralism than either Husserl, Heidegger, or Sartre. Concerning the "blossoming of Jacques Derrida in 1967," Silverman makes the surprising and original claim: "Writing corresponds to the visibility that Mer- leau-Ponty appealed to in the speaking spoken and the spoken speech which appears in a painting, in an event, or in the expression of thought" (149). One wonders what exactly "corresponds" means here and why Silverman has not simply written a tighter, more narrowly focused book on Merleau-Ponty and deconstruction, since it gradually seems to be his principal intention to assimi- late the latter to the former, a project which this book broaches but does not, in my opinion, persuasively carry out. In the absence of such a book, it would seem that this assimilation can only occur at a rather high price. Indeed-to pass over Silverman's chapters on (post)structuralism-it is quite striking how thoroughly Silverman must suppress or forget certain deconstructive motifs in order to argue, in the name of Merleau-Ponty's am- biguity, for the "hermeneutic semiology" of which he feels the need. The task of a hermeneutic semiology of the self... will be to establish a direct correlation between the self as interpreter and the system of signs produced in the interpretation. If the hermeneutic project is the formation of meaning through interpretation, it will explore the status of the "how" (personal knowledge and philosophical style) in contradistinction to the semiological "what" (identifiable body and language) that can be read by any self (338). Having thus rather bizarrely established that hermeneutics is concerned with form ("how") while semiology is concerned with content ("what"), Sil- verman goes on to say that the poles of form and content are to be situated at the center of their opposition, where they meet: "The middle is the system of interpreted signs. ... The locus of the self obtains neither at the archd nor at the telos but rather in the spanning of the two" (339). Signs are signs of the self, and the self is the self of signs. Understanding is inseparable from the signs which are its (non)object: "This ambiguity is the perplexity of western philosophy... . A hermeneutic semiology of the self will show that the separation is artifice" (342). Thus, invoking Merleau-Ponty's "ambiguity," Silverman would mediate between the form and content whose opposition is merely "artifice." This return to nature, to the immediacy of achieved mediation-which Silverman undertakes in the name not only of Merleau-Ponty but also, as it were in the same "breath," of post-structuralism, and which he entitles Inscriptions!-re- quires--for example - the effacement of the arguments of Paul de Man con- cerning the irresolvable undecidability, as opposed to the ambiguity, of the relation between form and content (which De Man retranslates as grammar and rhetoric in the first chapter of Allegories of Reading). Silverman thinks he can understand - and thus I would say fails to read- Merleau-Ponty's chias- mus as a return to nature, an escape from artifice. In stark contrast, deconstruc- tion reads-and thus knows that it must fail to understand--chiasmus as one figure among others, one "artifice" among others, even if a traditionally</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 213 privileged figure, perhaps the traditionally privileged figure of the effacement of figurality -- "artificiality" - and of the violent power of the latter. Given the effacement of figurality, by means of which Silverman reduces the legible to the perceivable, writing to visibility, chiasmus to nature, it is not surprising that he concludes with the pathos of anthropomorphism, attribut- ing to the act of interpretation a humanity, a desire, a yearning for itself which turns its interruption or disruption into the substance of an absence that is present, of a past of which the reminder could constitute an appropriative internalization: The self, dispersed in multiplicity, can be only in its reifications. Its vitality is gone, because its hermeneutic has been forgotten in favor of its signs. The lesson is that the signs are signs of an interpretive act... The interpretive act is the presence and actualization of the self's sign system and it yearns to be recovered--through interpretation itself (345). What Silverman is apparently forgetting is that the reminder--here, the recovery of the interpretive act-always leaves a remainder of non-mind, of that which pays no mind and has no yearnings but is not indifferent. The reminder here as always goes astray into a forgetfulness. The main thing of which Silverman's forgetfulness here reminds us, then, is just that: the always remaining, re-maiming, re-miming main thing (in French and English: "main"). For plausibly maintaining, in his way, the memory of this haunting and haunted thing, the thing that "is" always writing and waving, "is" always behind or beneath the vague, or the ambiguous, we must thus hand it to him: we must give him here the reminder, the help and the interrupted applause of a singularly repetitive hand.
