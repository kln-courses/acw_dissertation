<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction. From mid-October until the Elrst of December preliminary excavations were conducted at the site of Balakot, Las Bela District. The work was a joint effort of the University of California, Berkeley, and the Pakistan Department of Archaeology. The project was supported by a grant from the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (Grant No. FR 4-60092). Additional research funds were made available through the Depart- ment of Near Eastern Studies, Berkeley.l 1. I wish to express gratitude for the interest and cooperation of the Director of Archaeology in Pakistan Mhd. Ishtiaque Khan and his staff; the Minister of Education, Abdul Hafeez Pirzada; the District Commissioners of Las Bela District; the offWlcials of the Department of Public Works and Roads who allowed us to reside comfortably in the Naka Kharai Inspection Bungalow; and the offWlcers of the American Embassy in Islamabad and the American Consulate in Karachi who provided many of the basic goods and services. I especially want to thank Mr. Sidney Sober, American Charge d'Affaires, and Mr. Gor- don Tiger, American Consul-General, without whose help and en- couragement the project could not have succeeded. A special expres- sion of gratitude goes to Mohammed Siddique, the Representative of the Department of Archaeology whose constant help and cooparation guided us through an amicable and successful season. For help in the preparation of this report I extend thanks to Mark Kenoyer for mak- Background. The Indus or Harappan-civilization of Pakistan and western India is the earliest known example of an urbanized society in South Asia.2 Geographically it was centered in the Greater Indus Valley, encompassing a triangular area almost 1,000 miles on each side from the foothills of the Himalayas to the shores of the Arabian Sea. Knowledge of this remarkably extensive culture is as yet very limited. Its very existence was not recognized until the 1920s when excavations were conducted at the ing the drawings of the lithics and the bone and ceramic implements; to Bennet Bronson of the Field Museum of Natural History, for ob- taining identifWlcation of an enigmatic type of skeletal material; to Barry Roth of the Department of Geology, California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, for identifying some of the marine shells; and to Dr. Rainer Berger of U.C.L.A., Los Angeles, for testing the radiocarbon samples. Finally, I want to thank my wife, Barbara, for help with the ceramic drawings and the preparation of the manuscript. 2.

Excavations at Balakot, Pakistan, 1973 George F. Dales University of California, Berkeley During the winter of 1973-74 preliminary excavations were conducted at the ancient coastal site o+Balakot in Sanmiani Bay, Pakistan. Two periods are represented at the site. Period B, capping the mound, represents the Mature Indus (Harappan) period, the earliest urban period of South Asia. Balakot is one of Sive known coastal sites of the Indus Civilization. It is hoped that evidence will be dis- covered in subsequent seasons bearing on the question of the assumed sea trade contacts between the Indus and the Persian GulSand Mesopotamia in the cen- turies just beSore and aSter 2000 B. C. Period A at Balakot is designated as Early Indus. The more than 6 m. of oc- cupational debris resting on sterile soil represent the developmental stages leading directly into the earliest civilization of South Asia. The Early Indus sequence at Balakot contains ceramic elements related to many of the so-called "painted pottery cultures" o+Baluchistan and the southern Indus Valley. The proposed series of extensive excavations at the site should provide a sound chronological and culturalSramework within which any of these presently isolated cultural traditions can be studied. This report describes the location and potential importance of the site. The most signif cant f ndings oSthe f rst season's work are presented.</page><page sequence="2">4 Excavations at Balakot, Pakistan, 1973/Dales large urban settlements of Moenjo Daro and Harappa There are now well over 200 sites of this period known but only a few have received serious archaeological attention. The ancient Indus script, found mainly on steatite stamp seals, still remains unconvincingly deciphered in spite of the plethora of published claims. What little data we do have points to a range of ca. 2500-1900 B.C. for the mature, fully urbanized phase of the civilization. This places it coeval with the Sumerian, Akkadian, and Old Babylonian periods of Meso- potamia. Among the multitude of questions begging for answers are two which have provided the incentive for my earlier archaeological work in Pakistan and now the project at Balakot. First is the question of the degree to which the suggested contacts between the Indus region and the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia were vital to the cultural development in the Indus Valley. In other words, were the two regions in close commercial and cultural contact as many of the Mesopotamian cunei- form documents seem to suggest? Do one or all of the geographical names Magan, Meluhha and Dilmun that feature so importantly in Mesopotamian documents refer to the Indus region? Second is the question of the origin and early develop- ment of the Indus civilization. When the Indus culture was first revealed 50 years ago, the tendency was to regard it as merely an offshoot of the better known, sup- posedly more advanced civilization of Mesopotamia. But over the years, and especially during the past decade, internal evidence in Pakistan and India has ac- cumulated which makes it virtually certain that the development toward urbanism in South Asia was fun- damentally an indigenous process. This is not to rule out the possibility of some degree of stimulus diffusion from the Near East and quite probably adoption of certain Figure 1.

Most recently, through the researches of Pakistani archaeologists,3 it has become possible to use the terminology "Early Indus" in place of "Pre-Indus" for many of the cultural entities that are found stratigraphically beneath the "Mature Indus" remains. But the processes involved in the transition to the mature stage are still largely unknown. Very few sites of these earlier phases have been excavated extensively Vitally needed is information on settlement patterns and sizes, statistical analyses of total artifact assemblages, palaeo-ecological evidence, and other types of data that can only be obtained through extensive excavations at sites of Early Indus date. This leads directly to Balakot and why it is regarded as a key site for obtaining some of the data so seriously lacking from previous excavations. It is one of Elve known coastal sites of the Mature Indus period. Four of these-Sutkagen Dor, Sotkha Koh, Pir Shah Jurio, and Balakot are in Pakistan and Lothal is in India. Site distributions, trade routes and references in Meso- potamian commercial and literary documents, point to the conclusion that contacts during the Indus period with the Near East were conducted by means of coastal seafaring activities. The author's interest in investigating these coastal sites goes back to 1960 when he directed a survey of the Makran coast of Pakistan that included test excavations at the westernmost port-site of Sutkagen Dor.4 Ideally, Sutkagen Dor would be the site to search for more certain evidence of Near East-Indus contacts but its geographical isolation makes it logistically unfeasible. Balakot, being near to Karachi, presents no such problems and is the most suitable site for conducting investigations into the problems cited above. Also, the preliminary excavations in 1973 re- vealed that most of the cultural deposition at Balakot belongs to the Early Indus period. This provides us with an excellent opportunity to investigate the little known developmental stages leading to the urban period. It is planned that excavations will continue there for at least three or four more seasons. The Site. Balakot is located on an ancient course of the Windar River approximately 12 km. inland from Sonmiani Bay 3.

The Windar now flows approximately 5 km. east and south of the site. It was first mentioned as an archaeological site in the Baluchistan District Gazetteer of 1903. The hydrologist- cum-archaeologist Robert L. Raikes visited the site in 1960 and was the Elrst to identify it as a probable seaport of the ancient Indus period.5 Subsequently, Mhd Ra- Elque Mughal of the Pakistan Department of Archae- ology visited the site and had a topographic plan made of it in 1962. Abdur Rauf Khan of the Department of Geography, Karachi University, has visited the site several times and is conducting research into the geological and geo- graphical setting of the region.6 Rodman Snead, now of the Department of Geography, University of New Mexico, has also made studies of the geological and geo- graphical environment of the area as well as of the pre- sent floral cover.' These studies will be basic to our own researches in the coming years. The site, measuring approximately 160.0 m. x 180.0 m. in area and rising to a maximum of 9.7 m. above the present level of the plain, is situated in the center of an intensively farmed area that depends largely on irriga- tion water pumped up from deep wells. The ground water level is approximately 12.2 m. below plain level and thus, fortunately provides no difficulties for the excavations. Preliminary Excavations: Trench A. The purpose of the trial excavation was to investigate the depositional history of the site, the nature of the oc- cupational materials comprising the mound, and the total depth of the site so that excavation strategies for subsequent seasons could be better formulated.

These phases are divided into two principal "periods." Period A (Phases I-XI) includes the material that can be classified as Early Indus. Period B (Phases XIV-XVIII) represents the Mature Indus period that covers the top of the mound. Phases XII-XIII represent the transitional-mixed stage between the two periods. Further excavation should clarify the nature of this transition. These Phase designations and the descriptions given below must be regarded as tentative until horizontal excavations expose them more fully. Depositional History. The lower levels of Period A are frequently interspers- ed with horizontal bands of fine sand and silt, probably indicative of periodic floodings of the Windar River, which was next to the site at the time of its establish- ment. Heavy deposits of ash, charcoal, and animal bones characterize the Period A strata. The later levels of Period A tend to slant increasingly upward from the center of the mound, as can be seen in the trench sec- tions. This may indicate that the physical center of the settlement mound of Period A lies beyond the northern limit of the mound as it appears today. In other words, it is possible that the Mature Indus period settlers extend- ed their town to the south and west of the earlier Period A settlement. This will be clariEled as excavations are conducted in the center and along the southern edges of the site. Most of the recognizable occupation floors of Period A are fairly well preserved. Large amounts of pottery were found in situ on, or buried into, the floor levels. The impression is given that the deposition of the Period A levels was a rapid process. The reasons for this remain to be discovered but certainly the 6-7 m. of deposits con- tain archaeological materials of unexpected homogene- ity i.e. in terms of brick sizes, building techniques, stone tool technology, ceramic types and artistic styles. As for Period B, almost no in situ material was un- covered within the limits of Trench A. The mud brick Walls A and B at the extreme top of the trench represent the northern limits of structures of the Indus period. The Indus material found outside these walls was associated with thick strata of debris on the uppermost edge of the mound and with a large well-preserved furnace and smaller ovens (tandfirs). These extra-mural remains suggest an industrial area devoted to the production of materials that employed kilns and ovens, as, for exam- ple, animal figurines and pottery. l  25 27 458 N.LAT. 66 42' 30 E .Long.

No complete building plans were recovered in the limited area of Trench A but corners of structures and various walls were exposed. The direction of all walls in Period A is such that the corners of the structures are aligned approximately to the cardinal points of the com- pass. In Period B the walls themselves, not the corners, are aligned to the cardinal points, as is normally the situation at Mature Indus sites. Mud brick was the basic building material throughout Period A. In only two in- stances is there an indication of stone foundations. The earliest certain examples of mud bricks are in level 40, Phase II. Their thickness is approximately 10.0 cm. but it was impossible to determine their length and width. Similar bricks were found in the northernmost corner of level 38, Phase III. A stone alignment ran diagonally across the floor of level 35, Phase IV and may have been the foundation of a mud brick wall. UndeE1ned clumps of hard mud associated with this stratum may represent the crumbled brick wall. In level 30, Phase VI, a mud brick wall ran diagonally across the trench in the same direction as the stone alignment of stratum 35. Only one or two courses of brick in level 30 survived above floor level. The bricks are 10.0 cm. thick, 20.0 cm. wide and approximately 40.0 cm. long but this Elnal dimension is not certain. Level 26, Phase VIII, consisted of a habitation floor with large storage vessels in situ surrounded by several broken, and presumably discarded grinding stones. A mud brick wall cut diagonally across the northern cor- ner of the trench. Level 24, Phase IX, was particularly interesting. In the northwestern quarter of the trench was an architectural complex consisting of 19 broken, worn-out grinding stones bordering what appeared to be a floor or plat- form made of mud bricks bonded together with a fine bright yellow sandy mortar. The bricks are 10.0 cm. thick, 15.0 cm. wide, and of undetermined length. Level 20, Phase X was even better preserved and promises to be of major importance for the study of the cultural situation just prior to the advent of the Mature Indus Period. The corner of a mud brick structure was uncovered in the northeastern corner of the trench. It is represented as Wall C on the east section (FIG. 6). The well-preserved bricks measure 10.0 cm. x 20.0 cm. x 40.0 cm. The occupation level outside this structure consisted of a hard pebbly surface with storage jars in situ, a small hearth, and several stone alignments of undetermined . * slgnlilcance. Period B. The remains of Period B consist of four phases, two of which have architectural remains. Phase XV contains the mud brick Wall B and the large furnace. Wall B is preserved to a height of 13 courses in the east section of the trench, but as it cuts diagonally across the trench it shows evidence of having been severely cut into and only Figure 6. Trench A. East section.</page><page sequence="8">10 Excavations at Balakot, Pakistan, 1973/Dales a trace of it can be seen going stratigraphically under the later Wall A. The bricks measure 8.0 to 9.0 cm. thick 17.0 to 18.0 cm. wide and 35.0 cm. long. Thus they re- tain the approximate ratio 1:2:4 that characterizes the Period A bricks. The furnace, or oven (FIG. 7), was found in excellent Wall A of Phase XVI is stratigraphically later than Wall B and the ovens. It represents the northeastern cor- ner of a substantial building that crowns this part of the site. Eleven courses of mud brick are preserved, each brick measuring 8.0 to 9.0 cm. thick by 16.0 cm. wide and varying from 28.0 cm. to 33.0 cm. long. Unfor- tunately, the surface contour of the mound at this point suggests that very little of the plan of this structure has survived. This will be investigated further during the se- cond season. Pottery. Period B. So little of Period B was revealed during this preliminary season that it is premature to discuss the pottery of the Indus Period at Balakot. Those examples which were collected are identical to the pottery of Moenjo Daro, but most probably regional variations will be found when a fuller corpus of material is excavated during the subsequent seasons. Period A. It is the ceramic material from the Early Indus levels, Period A, that deserves immediate attention. More than 6 m. of habitational remains starting on sterile soil, belong to the Early Indus period. This in itself was total- ly unexpected but then to see the virtually homogeneous nature of the ceramics throughout this entire period added an even more exciting aspect to the potentials of this already important site. I must stress the inadvisability of drawing far- reaching conclusions from the ceramic evidence of a single trench at an otherwise unknown site. Never- theless, the ceramic sequence from Trench A largely confirms the most recently published chronology re- constructions,8 but there are some notable variations and overlaps that can only be explained through con- tinued work at the site. It is possible here to make only several generalizations concerning chronological rela- tionships with other sites in Baluchistan and the Indus Valley and to present some illustrative material to demonstrate the richness of the painted ceramic tradi- tion at Balakot during the Early Indus period.

It is one of the few such structures found in- tact at Indus Period sites. We cut a section across the southern part of the structure to reveal its internal con- struction. Otherwise, it has been kept as found and preservation efforts have been made by laboratory per- sonnel of the National Museum in Karachi. The original function of the furnace or oven has not yet been deter- mined but it is hoped that a more careful examination of the debris and ash associated with the structure may allow some suggestions. Within a radius of 3 m. from this large furnace were several smaller ovens. To judge from the evidence of bull figurines within and near these smaller ovens, it seems probable that this area was used for the manufacturing of small ceramic objects.</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. I, 1974 11 sterile soil, we are dealing with a basically wheelmade pottery industry. With the notable exceptions of heavy, crudely formed utility and storage vessels, the pottery is all wheelmade and reflects some of the fully developed painted pottery traditions known at other sites in Baluchistan. The single most prevalent type of pottery of Period A, from Phase I through IX, is what is gener- ally described as Nal Cemetery Ware, or Nal Poly- chrome.9 In broad terms, our Period A can be described as belonging to the basic Nal tradition of southeastern Baluchistan with infusions of other south-central Baluchistan traditions such as are best known from the Anjira sequence of Kalat.10 For example, the distinctive Anjira painted motif said to represent a highly stylized animal head, designated ;;Togau-C," is a common feature on plates and shallow bowls of Balakot Phases I- V. With Phases X-XI we see a virtual disappearance of the classic Nal polychrome vessels and the increased presence of another distinctive ceramic style known best from the site of Amri in the southern Indus valley.1l This closely patterned painted style belongs to Period I, Phases C and D at Amri. But it is the basic continuity of the ceramics that is im- pressive in Balakot Period A. I have already noted the long presence of the polychrome painted ware known originally from Nal. These vessels can probably be con- sidered in the general category of luxury wares. But there is an even more persistent homogeneity through time in some of the basic utility types of vessels name- ly, storage jars. Figure 8 shows typical examples of two of these types. Globular jars such as Figure 8: 1-3, are found in every phase from I through XII, thus spanning the entire Ear- ly Indus period and the transitional phases leading to the Mature Indus period. There are variations in details but overall they represent a consistent tradition. Con- sidering the large size of the vessels (averaging 30.0 cm. to 40.0 cm. in body diameter with some as large as 63.0 cm.) the thickness of the body walls is unrealistically thin. At the point of maximum body diameter the wall thickness can be as little as 0.5 cm. The jars are wheelmade and to judge from the exterior surfaces of the lower parts of the vessels, they must have been sup- ported on the wheel in a sand coated mold (FIG. 8: 1). This technique was commonly used later for the manu- facture of large storage jars at Moenjo Daro. The rims 9. H.

Jean-Marie Casal, Fouilles d'Amri (Paris 1964). on the majority of the jars are simple short rims standing either vertical or being slightly inturned (FIG. 8: 2). A creamy white slip is found on most of the vessels upon which dark brown to black decorations are painted. The basic decoration consists of solid color on the rim, and a solid band around the maximum diameter of the body. A single vertical solid band sometimes connects the rim and body band (FIG. 8: 3) and often additional horizontal bands and wavy bands are painted on the shoulder of the vessels (FIG. 8: 1 &amp; 2).12 On the largest examples of such globular jars, the rims tend more to a thick, heavier section and are often out-turned. Also we see the horizontal and wavy bands on the shoulder of the larger jars executed in raised relief and then painted. The second type of storage jar is the long cylindrical variety typified by Figure 8: 4. The illustrated example has a diameter of 36.0 cm. and a length of approximate- ly 70.0 cm. The vessel was found badly smashed on the floor of level 18 and its reconstructed length is based on measurements taken before it was removed from the floor. The creamy white slip and the painted raised relief bands relate it stylistically to the globular jars. These cylindrical vessels, occurring in Phases I through XII, are further characterized by their thick channel rims. A jar intermediate between the globular and the cylin- drical types is seen in Figure 8: 5. It is pear shaped, has a thick channel rim, white slip with painted bands, and has the molded base seen on many of the globular jars. An interesting technical detail is seen in the join made between the base and the body of the vessel. Its large size (diameter 54.0 cm., height 69.0 cm.) and thin walls ap- parently made it necessary to construct it in two parts, which were then rather crudely joined before filring. The Period A ceramics of Balakot also include a rich tradition of painted motifs. Most striking are the motifs that represent floral shapes and animal horns. Figures 9 and 10 tabulate these motifs in chronological order so as to demonstrate the basic continuity of the styles that persist from Phases III through X. I refrain from attempting to cite all the numerous parallels at other sites that can be found for specific motifs. Most of the parallels are with sites known only from surface collec- tions or from trial trenches. Parallels will be cited here that demonstrate the geographical rather than the tem- poral range of distinctive motifs. Our earliest example, Figure 9: 1, seems to depict a potted plant. The reddish buff paste sherd has a thin cream slip. The pot and the plant are of solid black and the flowers or fruit are very dark red. An exact parallel is known at the Early Indus site of Pandi Wahi, north of 12. B. DeCardi, op.cit. (in note 10). Pl.

One example, Figure 9: 2, is painted on a buff fine paste vessel having a thick cream slip. The plant is outlined in dark brown to black paint and Ellled in with red. The second example, No. 3, is painted in black on a heavy coarse paste vessel, probably a storage jar, having a creamy grey slip. Phase V yielded three examples. The Elrst, Figure 9: 4, is the rim sherd of a buff Elne paste vessel. On a cream slip is painted a thin red rim band below which are two black bands and a hatched leaf outlined in black. The second example, No. 6, is a buff fine paste vessel coated with a light yellowish cream slip. The plant, very similar to No. 2 of the preceding phase, is outlined in black and infilled with olive green paint. The third example from Phase V shows the earliest example of the downward curving animal horns that become so striking in Phases VIII-X. The crude animal head, Figure 9: 5, is painted in solid black on the interior surface of a small buff Elne paste cup. The exterior of the cup has black horizontal bands and what may be stylized leaf designs. Phase VIII is particularly rich in these plant-animal horn motifs. It is here that we see the ultimate stylization of artistic motifs representing the intimate, intertwined relationship between the plant and animal worlds. This is best seen on the fragment of a Elne orange-red paste plate, Figure 9: 11 on which, painted in black, is a purely floral motif entwined with the almost identically shaped horn of an animal-perhaps a water buffalo.14 Example No. 8 of Phase VIII is almost identical to Nos. 2 and 6 from preceding phases. The buff paste vessel is covered with a cream slip. The horizontal bands and the plant outlines are in black. The stem of the plant and the wide band beneath the rim are Ellled in with dark red paint. A similarly shaped vessel and painted decora- tion is seen on No. 10. A different type of hatched leaf is seen on No. 9. It is painted in black on the shoulder of a rather crude, thick walled jar. No slip is apparent. Number 7 introduces a new motif at Balakot that relates stylistically to other Balakot floral motifs but has parallels of various dates at other sites. The octopus-like motif continues into Phase X at Balakot, but at Amri it 13. N.G. Majumdar, Explorations in Sind ("NIemoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India," vol. 48 [Calcutta 1934]) pl.

Figure 10: Nos. 1 and 2 displays the octopus-like motif, painted on the insides of shallow bowls. Number 3 con- tinues very closely the style of Nos. 8 and 10, Figure 9 of Phase VIII. The fine buff vessel has a cream slip and the horizontal bands and plant designs are in solid black. Dark red fills the wide band beneath the rim. Vessel No. 4 is similar but has no traces of red. The large sweeping motif of No. 5 is painted over a dark reddish brown slip on the inside of an orange shallow bowl. It is drawn here as it looks from the vantage point of the center of the bowl. However, it may more correctly be viewed in in- verted position as seen from a position exterior to the bowl. This is clearly the situation with the design on dish No. 11, Figure 9 of Phase VIII and a grey dish of Phase IX depicting water buffalo head. By inverting the draw- ing, the motif fits much closer with the other plant and horn motifs that characterize Phases IX and X. Phase X has the most provocative painted motif found this season. The tall goblet, No. 10, Figure 10 is of a very fine painted orange-red. A thick, cream slip covers the exterior of the vessel. The decorations are painted in black. The surface of the vessel is in extremely fragile condition because of the poor adhesion between the slip and the body. Similar motifs are painted on op- posite sides of the goblet separated by another motif that has parallels in Phases VIII and X (see FIG. 11). At first glance it is easy to assume that the main motif is nothing but a peculiar combination of several of the common plant and horn motifs of the previous Phases. The sweeping down-curving elements are characteristic of both the plants and horns. The spiny projections recall the octopus-like designs of Phases VIII and IX. But it is the combination of these elements plus the addi- tion of a "head" that imparts the peculiarly suggestive aspect to this motif. If one is not convinced that the representation of a head was intended by the painter, compare the motifs on sherds Nos. 7 and 8 from this same phase. The overall effect is basically anthropomorphic. If one can accept this assumption then it is not a difficult leap to see here a possible prototype for the famous so-called proto-Siva figures depicted on several of the Indus seals from Moenjo Daro.l7 The positions of the arms and legs of the seated 15.

This in no way helps in explaining the significance of this enigmatic figure but it does add a possible temporal aspect to the problem. It is of further interest that a painted sherd from the recently excavated site of Gumla near Dera Ismail Khan in northern Baluchistan preserves the identical head and arms of our Balakot figures.l8 Belonging to Gumla Period IV, it is dated by the excavator as coeval with the Mature Indus period. However, Period IV contains many ceramic types that are very close to our Balakot Early Indus examples suggesting a peaceful mixing of Mature Indus elements with earlier and continuing regional types at home in the Baluchistan hills. I have presented merely a selection of some of the most characteristic ceramics and painted styles of Period A. There are many more, but they will be of con- siderably more interest and significance as the excavations are expanded beyond the initial trial trench stage. In addition to the basic decorative patterns on the painted pottery, the Early Indus ceramics often display enigmatic symbols either painted or scratched into the vessels that may have served, at least in part, as potter's marks (FIG. 11). Numbers 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1 1, 12, 13, 27 were scratched, deeply and usually rather crudely, into the surface of vessels after firing. Several actually deface the original painted designs on the vessels. The best example of this is No. 12 from Phase I, where the symbol was scratched into the decorated surface of a Togau style dish. The painted symbols, on the other hand, were applied before the vessels were fired and appear to have been an intentional part of the decorative composition. The only exceptions to this are No. 1, which was painted on the underside of the base of a bowl, and No. 28, which was painted on the underside actually the inside of the trumpet-shaped base of a dish-on-stand. The comb-like symbol of Nos. 4 and 9 is of considerable interest because of its wide geographic and temporal distribu- tion. It is seen commonly on pottery of the Kulli culture of southern Baluchistan and on ceramics of various prehistoric contexts throughout Baluchistan and across southern Iran to Mesopotamia. It also appears, in modified form, in the Indus script. Example No. 4 shows two of these symbols painted on the inside of a 18. A.H. Dani, "Excavations in the Gomal Valley," Ancient Pakistan 5 (1970-71) pl. 84, 8. shallow bowl. The vessel is fragmentary but presumably there were three or four of the symbols in a circle in the bottom of the bowl. Symbols Nos. 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25 are painted with black paint on a cream slip whereas 19, 21, 22 and 26 were painted directly on the ware of the vessels. Most of these appear on the outer sides of cups and bowls. Symbol 26 is different in that it is painted on the inside wall of a vertical sided bowl. Symbols 17, 23 and the scratched symbol 3 are of similar interest to the so-called comb symbol. Variations of this triangular symbol with projections out one side are also found throughout Baluchistan and across southern Iran in prehistoric contexts. The snake-like symbols 18, 24, 25 must have had some extra special significance. Number 25 separates the two possibly anthropomorphic figures on the elegant vessel No. 10, Figure 10 of Phase X. Other Artifacts. Period B. A detailed description of the few Mature Indus Period finds from Trench A would offer nothing new to our knowledge of the period. Most of the artifacts have a typical Mature Indus look to them. The few lithic im-. plements (FIG. 13: NOS. 1 &amp; 2) are typical Indus period tools. Beads are also of standard types, namely flat washer and tubular types of white paste, crude biconical beads of fired clay, and pierced shells. Ceramic wheels, carts, and balls were also found. Baked clay figurines of humped bulls only were found. The few examples have a cruder appearance than the fine examples from Moenjo Daro. Bone points were apparently still used in the Indus period (FIG. 14, A: NOS. 5 &amp; 6). Several examples like No. 5 were found. They appear to have been made from bird bones. Implements were made from pottery sherds throughout most of the sequence at Balakot. A sharp edged implement of the Indus period (FIG. 14, B: 4) was made by grinding the edge of red slipped sherd. Scoops were also made from sherds (FIG. 14, C: 2). The straight side of this example was ground to a sharp edge. The hole was possibly for a suspension string. Period A. Artifacts from the Early Indus levels at Balakot con- sist mostly of lithic tools. Fifty-eight examples were found from Phases II through IX (FIGS. 12 &amp; 13). The industry appears to have specialized in parallel sided chert blades. Most of the examples display a con- siderable amount of retouching. The unusually long blades of Phase IX (FIG. 13: 4-6) were retouched to the point where they probably had to be discarded.</page><page sequence="16"> lV 0 | | =. 0 A g a | l 1 ' tA 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 .0--j 31 ,(r 21 22 23 24 25 f_g jj__t 12 26 °  18 Excavations at Balakot, Pakistan, 1973/Dales phase Vl 1 2 3 4 5 8 9 10 ll  13 Figure 12.

A meaningful description of them must await the results of more extensive excavations. Points were made of bone and small antlers (FIG. 14, A: 1, 2, 4). Chisel-like implements were made of {lat bone (FIG. 14, A: 3) and from pottery sherds (FIG. 14, B: 1-3). Those made from painted sherds came from Phases VI and VIII while the unpainted example was from Phase v A. A ceramic scoop came from Phase V (FIG. 14, C: 1). It differs from the examples from Period B in not being pierced, not having the long edge sharpened, and more importantly, being intentionally made rather than being a reworked pottery sherd. The interesting feature of this early example is the symbol that was inscribed in the concave surface before the clay was fired. A variation of this symbol is found several times inscribed into the in- side surface of bowls at the recently excavated Early In- dus site of Jalilpur, south of Harappa.lg Only three examples of clay bull figurines were found in Period A. The earliest, from Phase V, is fragmentary. Only the head and part of the hump are preserved. Its original length must have been more than 20.0 cm. to es- timate from the size of the head. Two small holes of un- known function pierce the neck of the figure horizontal- ly. The second fragmentary figurine came from Phase VII. It consists of only the body and hump of a bull. The object is very soft and fragile because it was unfired. The third bull figurine was from Phase X. It is a crudely formed figure with an unnaturally wide rump. The male sex is indicated. The head and front legs are missing. Mention was made earlier of a single bull figurine of the Kulli type found in Phase XII. It has brown stripes painted vertically on its body. The male sex is plastically depicted in unusual detail. Unfortunately the head and forequarters are missing. Only three beads were found in Period A. The earliest, from Phase 111, is a small pierced snail shell. One tubular paste bead came from each Phase IV and IX. The only evidence of metal from the entire trench came from Phase Vl in the form of an almost totally oxidized lump of copper approximately 1.5 cm. across. Floral and faunal materials. Flora. Abundant quantities of plant macro-fossils were evi- dent in Trench A but because of the preliminary nature 19.

A trained palynologist will accom- pany the expedition for the second season to collect pollen and macro-fossil samples. Fauna. Shells and animal bones and teeth were extremely abundant throughout the entire Trench A sequence. No statistical studies were made of occurrences but the overwhelming majority of the shells, and some fish bones, was associated with the debris layers of Period B. The Early Indus levels were especially rich in animal bones and teeth. The animal bone material was collected and will be studied along with the new material collected during the second season by a mammologist accom- panying the expedition. At least 14 types of shells were collected. Five of these have so far been identified scientifically. Gastropods 1. Turbinella pyrum (Linnaeus, 1758) 2. Tibia insulaechorab (R6ding, 1798) 3. Terebraliapalustris(Linnaeus, 1767) Bivalves 1. Meretrix casta (Gmelin, 1791) 2. Andara (Scapharca) species All of these appear to be species native to the northern Arabian Sea. In addition there are cowries (genus Cypraea), oysters, snails and other gastropods and bivalves. A more detailed study of these food sources will be made during the second season. Common among the bones collected from Period B are peculiar symmetrical objects about 8.0 cm. in length having a shiny dark brown exterior and a fine spongy appearing interior. Numerous holes and channels per- forate these objects. When shown to local fishermen in Pakistan the identification was unanimously given as the skull of a Sua fish. They described this as a large (10-14 Ibs.) golden colored fish with a large mouth, which is excellent for eating. However, when samples were shown to the curatorial staffs of various museums and experts in University Departments in Pakistan and the United States, there was no consistency in the iden- tifications made. Finally, experts at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago were able to come up with a positive identification literally in a matter of minutes. They just happen to have in their collections similar specimens which were not available in other collections. We are indeed dealing with just what the local fishermen said we had a grouper or snapper which is a popular game fish in estuaries. Our sample belongs probably to the genus Pomadasys perhaps</page><page sequence="20">22 Excavations at Balakot, Pakistan, 1973/Dales Pomadasys operculari (Playfair). The reason for the dif- ficulty in identifying our specimens out of context, so to speak, is that they represent a skeletal element that is quite rare and is peculiar to this particular species of fish. The specimens are not actual skull bones as we were originally led to believe, but rather a separate head bone that is located within the skull. The large number of these peculiar bones within the limited conElnes of our trench suggest that this species of Elsh constituted a major part of the diet of the Period B community. Further investigations into present day catching and use of these fish will be pursued in the second season. Correlations and Relative Dating.20 As stated earlier in this report, it is unwise to attempt to draw wide ranging conclusions from the findings in a single trench at an otherwise unknown site. The ceramic sequence of Trench A agrees in general with the latest published chronological reconstructions (see Note 7). Where it does not, the question arises as to which to consider the more reliable. I prefer at this early stage in the Balakot project to leave the chronological frame- work as open as possible until more extensive excavations are conducted in the Early Indus levels. The ceramic evidence from Trench A shows that the people of the earliest settlement at least at this loca- tion on the mound-were already using the potter's wheel. With Phase I we see solid ceramic parallels with the Nal polychrome tradition; Anjira Period III, phase ii (Togau-C ware) of central Baluchistan; and Period I of Amri in the southern Indus Valley. The persistence of Nal polychrome ceramics through- out Phase IX on the one hand presents a stabile element upon which to reconstruct the chronological history of the site. But, on the other hand, the apparently long life of this ceramic tradition at Balakot runs counter to the chronological position of the Nal polychrome presented in most of the recently published chronologies of Early Indus period Baluchistan. With Phase X, although the general ceramic catalogue continues, we encounter the predominance of Amri bichrome ceramics over the Nal polychrome ceramic tradition. This lasts into the transitional Phase XII where we see the appearance of another characteristic ceramic element from the Quetta region of central Baluchistan. The terminal phase of the Early Indus 20. Eight samples of charcoal were collected from Trench A, four from Period B, four from A. Of these, the most immediately important are those from the Early Indus period from which so few reliable dates are available. These four samples are presently being tested at the Radiocarbon Laboratoryt UCLA, Los Angeles, California. Two are from Phase X, one from IX,, and one from V. period at Quetta is designated Damb Sadaat III.21 Characteristic of these ceramics is a painted motif described either as "brackets" or double horns. The motif appears in its expected chronological position in Phase Xll at Balakot. Finallys we were surprised at not Elnding more evidence for the important Baluchistan cultural entity called Kulli. The Kulli culture, so far as it is known, seems to have spanned the transitional phase in Baluchistan between the Early and Mature Indus periods. The Kulli people may also have played an im- portant role in the trade connections between the Indus region and the Persian Gulf. Sherds of the Kulli style have been found on the surface of the site but only a very few were unearthed in Trench A. They were all found in Period B contexts. If the recent upward adjustments for radiocarbon dates are accepted, Phase I at Balakot may date as early as 3500 s.c.22 This presents us with the dilemma of a basically homogeneous Early Indus period lasting for as long as 800 or more years. New carbon dates and more stratified materials from Balakot should provide some enlightenment concerning this important pre-urban period. The plan for the second season's work is twofold. New excavations will concentrate on the Period B levels so as to delineate the extent of the Mature Indus settle- ment. It is hoped that its outer limits can be traced and planned and that the general layout of the settlement can be ascertained. The Period A levels will not be excavated this second season. This will allow our palynologist to collect pollen and macro-fossil plant remains from the sections of Trench A. He will also make corings near the site and at crucial locations in the surrounding Somniani Bay region. This will be a start toward providing one of the first palaeo-ecological studies at an archaeological site in Pakistan. George F.
