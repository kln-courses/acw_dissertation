Lustick Naval Aerospace Medical Research Lab Detachment, LA THE EXTENSIVE ENGINEERING EFFORT directed toward preventing serious occupant injury during a vehicular accident requires the knowledge of the bioengineering characteristics of man. In particu- lar, the knowledge of the human dynamic response and associated injury mechanisms resulting from impact forces is the bioengineering data required in design efforts to prevent injury. Therefore, a large part of bioengineering research is directed toward improving the state of knowledge of both human dynamic response and injuries associated with the dynamic response. A major obstacle to this research is that injurious acceleration experi- ments cannot be conducted on humans, therefore a surrogate such as an anthropomorphic dummy, a cadaver, or an animal must be used at levels likely to cause injury or structural damage. The use of data from experiments on surrogates de- pends on the ability to validate the results obtained with human data. There is a further limitation. No volunteer experiment should be conducted unless valid and valuable data can be gained from the ex- periment, even if the experiment is safe. A careful balance must be established to devise safe human experiments that provide vital information to sup- port protective engineering design. The measure- ment of human dynamic response within tolerable levels constitutes a class of experiments that re- quires instrumentation of volunteers and careful experimental procedures. The experimental design challenge is to obtain valid and valuable measure- ments of volunteer response while limiting the hazard and discomfort of the experiment. Since 1967, human volunteers have been ex- posed to impact acceleration experiments in care- fully graded increments, in which kinematic re- sponse of the head and the first thoracic vertebral body (T^) have been measured (1,2,3,4,5,6).* This method has been extended to the measurement of the kinematic response of the pelvis. The cru- cial purpose is to measure the human dynamic response of sufficient anatomical segments so that valid models and anthropomorphic dummies can *Numbers in parentheses designate References at the end of paper. ABSTRACT The systematic measurement of the inertial response of human subjects to impact acceleration has been underway for several years. The response of the head and first thoracic vertebra (T^) has been reported for a variety of sled acceleration profiles. In order to better describe the inertial response of man, it is necessary to measure the pelvic response in addition to the response of the head and T^. A pelvic anatomical mount has been constructed and used on one volunteer undergoing successively higher levels of -Gx impact acceleration. The de- scription of the use of the mount is given. The data for four runs in a maximum rate of onset and maxi- mum duration configuration from 2 - 7 G peak acceleration, using the 12-in HyGe® accelerator are reported. Data from this subject for -Gx impact acceleration experiments have been pre- viously reported and are compared to data from the experiments with the pelvic mount. The propo- gation of the acceleration profile from pelvis to T^ to the head will be described. The use of these data for description of the complete dynamic re- sponse of man will be discussed. 3205 0096-736X/78/8604-3205$02.50 Copyright © 1978 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3206 C.

This paper will describe the pelvic, Tļ and head data from four experiments on one volunteer. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD Measurement of the dynamic response of the head and neck to -Gx impact acceleration, which describes the effects of head initial position, peak sled acceleration, rate of onset and duration using the twelve-inch HyGe® accelerator has been pre- viously reported (5,6). The inertial, photographic instrumentation and data handling techniques used in these studies have been described previously (7,8). The technique of x-ray anthropometry for relating inertial and photographic instrumentation coordinate systems to the anatomical head and first thoracic vertebral body (T^) coordinate systems has been defined and described previously (9,10,11,12). These same techniques were em- ployed with the head and T^ in the four runs with pelvic mount and its associated instrumentation. All the runs reported in this paper are from ex- periments using subject 32, who was the only sub- ject run with a pelvic mount. Head and T^ response data from subject 32 has been previously reported (5,6). The subject-mounted inertial instrumentation consists of a "T" shaped plate on which a six accelerometer and photographic target array are mounted. One plate is attached to an individually molded stainless steel mount at the mouth, another to an individually molded fiberglass mount at T^ and a third to an individually fabricated pelvic mount. The measured variables are the accelera- tions from each of the six accelerometers at each of the three anatomical locations, the sled accel- eration and the displacement relative to the sled of the photographic targets on the three plates. A two axis rate gyroscope mounted on the head and one mounted at T^ yielded redundant measurements of two components of angular velocity at the anatomical locations. In addition to the sensors themselves, which are permanently fixed in the three plates, the exact three dimensional location of each sensor relative to the head and T^ ana- tomical coordinate systems was determined by three dimensional x-ray anthropometry on a one- time basis for the subject. The measurements are three dimensional with the exception that only one on-sled camera was available to record the motion of the targets on the pelvic mounted "T" plate. This is not a major limitation for -Gx impact acceleration experiments using volunteers since the head and T^ response has been shown to be limited primarily to a mid-sagittal plane of the anatomy (3), and therefore it was expected that the pelvic response would be similarly limited to the mid-sagittal plane of the anatomy. The pelvic mount was designed to satisfy the following requirements: (a) to be non invasive; (b) in as far as possible, to be constrained to move with the bony pelvic structure; (c) to be a rigid platform for attachment of inertial instrumentation and photographic targets; (d) to be an integral and safe part of the restraint system; (e) to have ease of reliable repeated use on the same volunteer; (f) to have a constant relationship to the bony pelvic anatomy from run to run; and (g) to be amenable to three dimensional x-ray anthropometry to measure the pelvic instrumenta- tion coordinate system in relation to the pelvic anatomical coordinate system. The human pelvis has only a few anatomical areas where the bony pelvis is relatively close to the skin. Those areas of importance for the con- struction of an anatomical mount are: (a) the anterior superior iliac spine; (b) the iliac crest; (c) the symphysis pubis; and (d) the posterior surface of the sacrum. There were several possible approaches for using these bony features as a basis for an anatomi- cal mount. The one selected was designed to load the pelvis in compression around the entire iliac crest forming a mount that would surround the entire upper bony pelvis. A plaster impression was taken of the upper pelvis from the symphysis pubis to about 4 cm above the level of the iliac crests. The impression was taken by successively wrapping the pelvis with 15.2 cm (6 in) wide plaster- of-paris -impregnated wraps. After drying, the circumferential band was removed by cutting the band into two sections. A fiberglass model of the volunteers pelvis was constructed from the im- pression. Various prototypes of the pelvic mount were constructed from the pelvic model. The pelvic mount is constructed of fiberglass with a 3. 2 cm x 0. 32 cm (1-1/4 in x 1/8 in) circum- ferential steel band imbedded in the center of the fiberglass, Fig. 1. The mount separates into a front and a back section. The sections are fastened together on each side by a 7. 6 cm x 3. 2 cm (3 in x 1-1/4 in) bridging plate secured by four bolts to the imbedded steel band. The shoulder straps attach anteriorly to two bolts about 8. 9 cm (3-1/2 in) apart, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. The lap belts are at- tached to two fittings bolted through the fiberglass</page><page sequence="3">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 3207 Fig. 1 - Front view of pelvic mount without restraint straps Fig. 2 - Front view of pelvic mount with shoulder harness attached to the steel band, as shown in Fig. 3. The bolt points are about 3. 8 cm (1-1/2 in) posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine impressions. An inverted MVM strap from sled to pelvic mount to sled is secured through the metal loop attached to the anterior center point of the mount and shown in Fig. 4. The T^ mount is secured by two straps to the posterior portion of the pelvic mount and two straps to an anterior portion of the mount where the shoulder straps are bolted. In effect, the pelvic mount is an integrated instrumentation mount- restraint system. Proof testing of the mount was done by replacing the "pelvic" region of an Alderson 95th Percentile, 220 lb dummy (Model #CG-98) with the volunteer's pelvic model. The dummy was restrained to the sled chair using the pelvic mount and the human experimentation restraint system, and accelerated to a peak of 167 m/s2 (17. 0 G) without failure of any component parts. The mount system is considered safe for</page><page sequence="4">3208 C. L. EWING, ET AL.

EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS The experimental variables measured allow for three dimensional resolution of the kinematic variables of angular and linear acceleration, velocity and displacement of the head, T^ and</page><page sequence="5">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 3209 Fig. 5 - Pelvic mount attached to volunteer, close-up pelvis. The accelerations and displacements at each anatomical site are measured by the accel- erometer array and the photographic system, respectively. Velocities are derived from either the acceleration or photographic data. For these runs there are two important limitations to the measurement system: (a) photographic data from the pelvis was acquired from one camera and therefore it was required to constrain the solution to two dimen- sions. It has been demonstrated that in -X direc- tion experiments, there is very little motion out of the mid-sagittal plane; therefore a two dimen- sional approximation is acceptable. (b) no x-ray anthropometry of the pelvis was attempted at this time because the steel imbedded in the mount precluded visualization of the under- lying bony anatomy. Since the pelvic mount was tied extremely tightly to the chair resulting in little rotation, pelvic x-ray anthropometry was not crucial. The maximum angular rotation of the pelvic mount in the mid-sagittal plane was 0. 1 rad. as shown in Fig. 7. However, it is essential to modify future mounts to permit x-ray anthropometry in order to cover adequately the range of human experiments required to charac- terize the human response to impact acceleration. From the large array of possible kinematic variables, a limited set of variables is presented which best characterizes the response. The names and definitions of these variables are: DPOSOP - The resultant displacement of the pelvic instrumentation origin relative to the sled as determined from photographic data. The motion as determined from photographic data was con- strained to the laboratory X, Z plane. ACXXOS - The acceleration of the sled along the laboratory X direction. The Y and Z compo- nents of acceleration are negligible for these -Gx impact runs. APXXOS - The linear acceleration of the pelvic instrumentation origin along the laboratory X direc- tion. The Y and Z components of acceleration are negligible for these -Gx impact runs. ANXXOS - The linear acceleration of the T^ anatomical origin along the laboratory X direction as determined from accelerometer data. AAOXOS - The resultant linear acceleration at the head anatomical origin as determined from accelerometer data. QHBOXS - The angular acceleration of the head along the head anatomical Y axis as deter- mined from accelerometer data. The other angular acceleration components are negligible for these -Gx impact runs. RHBOXS - The angular velocity of the head along the head anatomical Y axis as determined from accelerometer data. The other angular velocity components are negligible for these -Gx impact runs. PP202P - The angle of the orientation of the pelvic instrumentation axis relative to the laboratory axis as determined from photographic data. With the constraint that the motion is restricted to a plane parallel to the XZ laboratory plane, this</page><page sequence="6">3210 C. L. EWING, ET AL. Fig. 6 - Front view of pelvic mount attached to volunteer rotation about the laboratory Y axis is the only angle required to establish orientation. DPTZ - For purposes of data processing, times are measured relative to DPTZ which is defined as the time 40 ms prior to first motion of the sled. First motion of the sled is determined by the best straight line fit to the rising portion of the sled acceleration profile between 20 and 50% of peak sled acceleration. The extrapolation of this line to its intercept with the time axis estab- lishes the time of first motion. The sled profile is characterized by the peak sled acceleration, the rate of onset and the dura- tion. The peak sled acceleration is the maximum absolute value of the sled acceleration profile. Rate of onset is the magnitude of the slope determined from the best line fitted to the data in the rising portion of the acceleration profile between 20 and 50% of the peak sled acceleration.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN One volunteer, for whom there is a large data base from previous -Gx impact acceleration ex- periments, was selected. He was run at succes- sively higher peak sled accelerations to a maximum of 76 m/s2 (7. 8 G). To the greatest extent possible, restraint and sled acceleration profiles were kept the same as in previous runs without a pelvic mount. This was done in order to evaluate the mount under circumstances completely familiar to the subject and to compare the T^ and head response with prior runs, and to make certain that major changes to the human response were not occurring as a result of the pelvic mount. Four runs were fully instrumented and are presented. The limitation to 76 m/s2 (7. 8 G) was arbitrary and does not constitute a limit of the pelvic mount or the man.</page><page sequence="7">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 32 1 1 RESULTS The acceleration components of the sled (ACXXOS), the pelvis (APXXOS) and T± (ANXXOS) are compared in order of increasing peak sled acceleration from 19.2 to 76. 0 m/s^ (2. 0 - 7. 8 G) in Figs. 8-11. There are two prominent and con- sistent results over the range studied. As to be expected, the peak sled acceleration occurs first, followed successively by the first peak of the pelvic acceleration and the T^ acceleration. The pelvic and T^ acceleration peaks are always larger than the sled acceleration peak. Despite a steel rein- forced fiberglass, individually molded pelvic mount incorporated into the restraint system, there is a time delay between time of peak sled acceleration and time of peak pelvic mount acceleration, as well as an increase of peak pelvic acceleration over sled acceleration, due to the non rigid re- straint attached to the mount. The response at T^ is similar, but with a further delay due to ana- tomical structures between T^ and pelvis and the dynamics of the torso-pelvis harness. The limited extent of pelvic motion is evident from the pelvic mount displacement (DPOSOP) as shown in Fig. 12 (less than 0. 9 cm in all cases from initial position to minimum value).

Fig. 11 - Chair, pelvis, and acceleration along the X axis of laboratory simultaneously plotted for 7. 8 G Fig. 12 - Plot òf PPOSOP illustrating the linear displacement of the pelvic mount relative to the sled in the X-Z plane of the laboratory The angular acceleration (QHBOXS) and angular velocity (RHBOXS) of the head about the Y anatomi- cal axis of the head is presented in Figs. 13 and 14. The characteristic shape of head angular accelera- tion and velocity as a function of time is the same as previously reported (3,4,5,6). The resultant linear acceleration at the head anatomical coor- dinate system for the four experiments is presented in Fig. 15. The characteristic double peak for the high rate of onset, long duration (HOLD) condition, evident from average traces in previously reported 2 experiments (6), appears in the 76.0 m/s (7. 8 G) run #1380, but not in lower level runs. However, / 2 runs below 60 m/s / were not analyzed in prior reports. Selected photographic frames of the motion of the pelvic mount and target in run #1380 are presented in Fig. 16. The time of day of center of shutter opening is registered at the right hand side of the frame in hours, minutes and seconds with a resolution of 100 ys. The first frame de- picts the initial position of the pelvis at the time of first motion of the sled. The second frame corresponds to the time of maximum pelvic linear acceleration. The third frame corresponds to the time of maximum linear displacement of the pelvis. There is very little difference in angular or linear motion of the pelvic mount at any of these times. This illustrates the close coupling of the pelvis to the chair and accounts for similarity of pelvic horizontal acceleration to sled acceleration. Selected photographic frames from the lateral camera viewing the head and neck response are shown in Fig. 17. The first, second and fourth frames correspond most, closely to the time and events shown in photographs of pelvic response. The third frame is the time at which peak head angular acceleration occurs. The fifth frame occurs at the time of maximum head angular dis- placement. In order to evaluate whether there were sub- stantial changes to the head and neck response as a result of the pelvic mount which is integrated into the restraint, a detailed comparison of peak values is presented in Table 1. The results of run No. 479 previously reported (6) are compared with run No. 1324 in which the pelvic mount was used. The agreement of each of the head and neck para- meters is excellent. The average of all prior 6 G experiments in the HOLD condition are also given in Table 1. There are no significant differences in the head and T ^ response despite the rate of onset of sled acceleration being significantly higher for experiment No. 1324. A further comparison of peak values for the three higher runs No. 1297, No. 1324, No. 1380 was made with the values pre- dicted from the regression model (6) on sled para-</page><page sequence="9">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 3213 Fig. 13 - Angular acceleration of the head about the + Y axis of the head for all runs Fig. 14 - Angular velocity of the head about the + Y axis of the head for all runs meters and is shown in Table 2. All differences are within one standard deviation except the peak head angular acceleration and velocity for run No. 1380, and even those less favorable comparisons are not significant. Therefore the pelvic mount Fig. 15 - Linear acceleration of the head about the + Y axis of the head for all runs has been demonstrated to be usable as an integrated instrumentation mount restraint system without resulting in significant change to the dynamic response of the volunteer. DISCUSSION A major obstacle to an optimum engineering approach to injury prevention for occupants in vehicular accidents is the lack of knowledge of the biodynamic response of the human being. The tissue forces developed during the biodynamic response cause the injury. The kinematic response of volunteers is the most direct experimental mea- surement method available for determining the response. The experimental technique is con- strained by the anatomy since inertial instrumenta- tion requires a safe and stable mounting location. The head, T^ and pelvis have been selected as the major anatomical locations to be used for instru- mentation locations to pursue this experimental approach. These anatomical locations are suffi- ciently large, sufficiently rigid and have been precisely defined (9,10, 11) in terms of three dimensional anatomical coordinate systems to serve as an experimental basis for describing human whole body impact acceleration response. The head and T^ response have been reported previously (5,6). This report presents the data from the pelvis under impact acceleration condi-</page><page sequence="10">3214 C. L. EWING, ET AL.

The progression of acceleration with the delays of the peak from chair to pelvis to T^ to head is displayed. The head to T^ response is a characteristic of the anatomy since there is no contrived head and neck restraint. There is no significant modification of the response of the head and T^ when the pelvic mount is employed with subject 32. The relation- ship between T^ and pelvic response is due to both anatomical and restraint factors because the upper torso restraint and harness T^ mount are attached by straps to the pelvic mount. In order to develop this relationship it would be necessary to conduct additional experiments without upper torso re- straint. The application of the pelvic mount in this study was limited in order to most safely proceed with volunteers and to evaluate the pelvic data under conditions almost identical to prior runs without pelvic mount or instrumentation. These limitations are self imposed. Future experi- ments with the pelvic mount using several subjects are required for: (a) experiments without torso restraint; (b) experiments with extensive pelvic rotation in which pelvic x-ray anthropometry is necessary; and (c) experiments with extensive whole body restraint in which the effects of the restraint on pelvic, head and T^ response must be directly determined. The ability to safety instrument three major anatomical segments of volunteers makes possible the determination of an experimental data base for evaluating the validity of human surrogate experi- ments and test devices. CONCLUSION Three dimensional measurement of the head, T^ and pelvic response of volunteers to impact acceleration has been accomplished. It has been demonstrated that a reliable pelvic mount and in- strument package can be safely used to measure dynamic response of the pelvis. The use of the pelvic mount as an integrated portion of the re- straint system does not significantly change the</page><page sequence="15">-Gx IMPACT ACCELERATION 3219 response at and consequently the head. The response of the restrained pelvis and shows a delay of the peak acceleration from chair to pelvis to Tļ which seems to increase with increasing acceleration. The pelvic acceleration approximates the chair acceleration with some dynamically in- duced differences as expected since the restraint straps permit some small motion. T ^ acceleration differs from the chair and pelvic acceleratioņ to a larger degree. These major dynamic differences, as expected, are due to relatively larger motion of T^ permitted by the restraint system and chest deformation. The unrestrained head responds primarily by rotation of the head and neck system and is markedly different from T^ or pelvis.
