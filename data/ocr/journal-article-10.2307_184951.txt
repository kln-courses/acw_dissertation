<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO APPROACHES TO MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS* G. SCHLESINGER The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia It is commonly the case that a problem concerning a mathematical or physical system can be solved in two quite different ways-by an internal or an external approach. For example, the area of a triangle can be found by integration or by showing it to be half that of a certain rectangle. In general, the first approach is, to analyse the given system into component parts, and the second approach is to deal with the system as a whole. It seems that even in cases where solutions to physical problems obtained according to these two approaches are equally valid, and are equally good as explanations, scientists prefer the solution obtained by the internal approach. The reasons for this preference are examined. And it is suggested that whatever the reasons, this preference may have been partly responsible for the 19th century prefer- ence for the Kinetic Theory rather than Thermodynamics. 1. Towards the end of the 19th century differences of opinion existed between scientist-philosophers about the relative merits of the Kinetic Theory of Matter and of Thermodynamics. If one wished to sum up briefly the commonly accepted interpretation of this controversy, one might say that the adherents of the mechanistic philosophy of nature preferred the Kinetic Theory, as it explained thermal phenomena in terms of the mechanical properties of the molecules, thus reducing the science of heat to the science of mechanics. They believed that ultimately all physical science should be reduced to mechanics. Their opponents on the other hand did not attribute any superior or special status to mechanics which to them was in no way more fundamental than any other domain of science. Besides this they had a positive reason for wishing to deal with macroscopic properties of material systems and not the microscopic ones. They were phenomenalists, unwilling to include in their systems atoms, molecules or any other entities that cannot be directly perceived by the senses. Since then the standpoints of both parties to the arguments have had to undergo such fundamental revisions in the light of modern findings, that nowadays the whole dispute seems to have lost its point. For at the beginning of the 20th century strong and fairly direct evidence in favour of the atomic structure of matter began to accumulate. Consequently the opposition to the atomistic view had gradually faded and eventually vanished completely. On the other hand, with the rise of quantum mechanics, the mechanistic inter- pretation of the world became untenable and was with the passage of time abandoned. Thus 20th century physics has demolished the foundations of both schools of thought. This is why today the above controversy is looked * Received November 1958. 240</page><page sequence="2">TWO APPROACHES TO MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 241 upon as an interesting episode in the annals of science, being of hardly more than historical significance. I would, however, like to bring into focus a different aspect of this contro- versy, one which will reveal the broader implications of the differing opinions and their relevance to attitudes of our present day. I shall try to show that the disputants represent in general two different approaches to problem solving in physics and mathematics. These two approaches are of universal application and we find that they have been employed in all periods of the history of science. Furthermore I shall try to show that a certain misunder- standing as to the nature of these two approaches, a misunderstanding that is partly responsible also for the controversy referred to, still exists today and needs correction. To put first things first, I propose to devote the next section to a detailed consideration of a matter affecting general scientific methodology and concerning alternative approaches to problem solving. 2. It often happens that a problem can be solved in two or even more different ways. It is clear that when the same answer is deduced validly by alternative methods from different but equally true premises, that the two solutions are of equal validity. Sometimes alternative valid solutions to the same problem show a special kind of contrast to one another. As an illustration of this, consider two proofs of the binomial theorem for the case in which the index is a positive integer. It is required to prove that if n is a positive integer, (a+ X)n -an + na-lx + 2n(n!- an-2x2 . xn There are two methods of proving the above identity: Method I: Consider a particular case of the general theorem, namely that when n 1. We see that (a + x)l = a + x. This is in accordance with the theorem. We could go on and show by expanding (a + x)2, (a + X)3 etc. that for any other particular value of n the theorem is true. If now we can show that the binomial theorem holds for any value of n from n - I to n = oo, then of course we have proved the theorem. In order to achieve this we employ a device known as "Mathematical Induction". It is easily shown that if the binomial theorem is true for n m then it is also true for n rn + 1, whatever the value of m. But we have already seen that the theorem holds for m 1. Hence it is true for m - 2 and if it is true for m 2 it is true for m _ 3, and so on for every value which m can assume.</page><page sequence="3">242 G. SCHLESINGER lMfethod II: We can approach the whole problem from a different direction. Instead of considering any particular case of the binomial theorem we look upon it as being only a particular case of a much wider theorem, namely Maclaurin's theorem. According to this if f(x) is any function of x (with certain restriction which are of no interest to us here) then x2 f(x) - f(o) + xf '() + - f "(o) + ... etc. Taking as a particular case f(x) (a + x)"1 then f(o) = an xf(o) - nan-lx etc. and we obtain at once the binomial theorem. Clearly both solutions are valid. Both employ sound deductive reasoning. (In spite of its name, Mathematical Induction is strictly deductive). But there is a distinct contrast between their ways of approach. Their trains of reasoning take off from different starting points and proceed in different directions. Whereas in Method I one works from the particular to the general, in Method II the procedure is the reverse. In Method I we resolve a general thesis into its component particular instances and through them we build up our more comprehensive theorem, but in Method II we treat the whole theorem as being a part of a more inclusive one, and show that it is already included in this wider theorem. This particular kind of contrast among valid alternative solutions is of frequent occurrence in mathematics. It is often the case that when faced with a mathematical system (in this case a functional identity) that we can deal with it either through its constituent elements (in this case particular algebraic identities obtained by giving n special values in the functional identity) or we can deal with it as an entity not to be separated into such components. In what follows, I shall try to show that similar alternative approaches have often been made to all sorts of systems. By "system" I mean a complex whole-anything composed of parts. In general, when a problem concerning the nature of a system is to be solved, two methods of approach may be available. I shall call the first method, which analyses the system into its constituent elements, or which obtains the solution in terms of the component parts of the system-an "internal" method. The other method which treats the system is an entity not to be separated into parts-an "external" method. As a second illustration of internal and external approaches to systems let us now consider an example from Geometry. This will bring us a step nearer to our final aim, the physical sciences. How do we calculate the area of a geometrical figure ? Usually the area is thought of as being made up of elements of area, and the calculation of area is a matter of summing these elements. When we think of the area of a rectangle, for instance, we may consider it as being composed of ele-</page><page sequence="4">TWO APPROACHES TO MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 243 mentary squares and calculate the total area by adding the areas of these squares. This is what we do when we multiply length by height. From earliest times, however, there has also existed a different approach to the concept of area. Consider for a moment the way the area of a triangle is calculated. Instead of breaking up the triangle into its component parts it is viewed as a part-or more accurately-as a half of a parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram itself is obtained not by resolution into elementary areas but by showing its equivalence to the area of a rectangle. Pursuing the same line of thought as before, we call the first approach which constructs an area out of its constituent elements an internal approach. And the second approach, which treats the area as a whole, we may call an external approach. It is of interest to note that before the rise of the integral calculus all the methods used to compute the areas of curvilinear figures employed the external approach. Once it was realised that it was impossible to find the area of a curvilinear figure in terms of elementary squares, all efforts were directed towards finding rectilinear figures of area equivalent to that of the curvi- linear figure in question. The first striking success was achieved as early as the 5th century B.C. when Hippocrates of Chios calculated the area of certain lunes (figures bounded by arcs of circles of different radii) by showing that these were equal to the area of certain triangles. Eventually, however, the integral calculus provided a universal method for calculating the area of geometrical figures. The method of integration is of course an "internal" method as it is a summation of the infinitesimal areas of which the particular figure is made up. Now let us turn to an example from physics. Consider the following two methods of finding the path described by a particle projected into a vacuum near the surface of the earth. One way of approaching this problem is to consider the force-components acting on the particle at each stage of its flight. From this we can derive the acceleration-component at any instant, hence the corresponding velocities and finally the path-elements. When added together these elements give the resultant path. A solution of this nature was first given by Galileo. He found that the path was parabolic. The other approach proceeds from a principle which asserts something general about the nature of paths described by particles subject to any combination of forces (and also, with some modification, about the paths of light rays subject to successive refraction and reflection). This general principle was named the "Principle of Least Action" by its originator Mau- pertuis and was developed and perfected by Euler and Lagrange. According to this principle the path described under any circumstances will be such that dfvds 0= . By the methods of the Calculus of Variations we can then show that in our case the resulting path is a parabola. Thus we have the same contrast here between the two approaches as before. In one case we find the path elements first, and through them construct</page><page sequence="5">244 G. SCHLESINGER the whole path. This is an "internal" approach. In the second case, an "external" approach is adopted; the nature of the path is discovered first without any resolution into path elements. 3. In the previous section examples of mathematical and geometrical systems were considered. But the last example was of a physical system-the path of a projectile, the elements of which are things one can observe. Attention was drawn to the fact that when studying a system, one sometimes has the alternative of either considering or not considering its components. It is now proposed to consider some material systems (i.e. systems which may be regarded as made up of material objects. The path of a projectile and the elements of this path, although observable, are not material objects.) Such systems can also be treated by the methods under discussion. It will be seen that the two approaches have been made to various material systems in different periods of science. Let us first consider the following example: A uniform chain MN is placed across the horizontal edge C of a s o triangular prism ABC. Let the angles M gZ N at CAB and CBA be a and ,B, and let AB be horizontal. Assuming the sides of the prism to be perfectly smooth it is required to show that A B in equilibrium the two ends of FIG. 1 the chain will lie on a horizontal line. The first approach is to consider the particles comprising the chain and the forces acting on them. Each particle is acted upon equally by the force of gravity in the vertical direction. But we are interested in the component of this force along the side of the prism, for that component which is per- pendicular to the sides is counteracted and cancelled by the prism. The component force along the side CA, acting on every particle lying to the left of C is proportional to sin oz. If the length of the chain lying to the left of C is m then the total force acting on that portion along CA is proportional to m sin oz. In the same manner we find that if the rest of the chain is of length n, then the C force acting on CB will be proportional to n sin ,B. But for these two forces to be in equilibrium we must have m sin a n sin ,B, which, of course, is also the condition that MN is a M N horizontal line. The second approach completely circumvents the need to consider the particles that make up the chain or the forces that act on them. It starts by FIG. 2</page><page sequence="6">TWO APPROACHES TO MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 245 considering a different system of which this given system is only a part, namely an endless chain lying over the edges of a horizontal triangular prism. Such a system must necessarily be in equilibrium or else the chain, being uniform, would go on moving for ever. But the hanging portion of the chain is symmetrical if MN is horizontal, and it may therefore be removed without affecting the equilibrium. Thus the remaining portion MCN will be in equilibrium, when the ends MN lie on a horizontal line. This second way of solving the problem is, with only slight modification, the celebrated solution given by Stevin to a similar problem (4). Stevin could not have solved his problem in the other way suggested here, for the simple reason that he did not have any previous knowledge of the principle of the composition and resolution of forces; on the contrary, it is only after he has arrived at a general solution of problems of equilibrium on inclined planes that he derives from it the principle of the composition and resolution of forces. Thus his ingenuity consisted in his avoidance of having to deal with a material system in terms of its constituent particles, and in his ability to fall back on a more general principle-the principle of the impossibility of perpetual motion. Many more examples, mainly from 17th century science, could be cited to illustrate how frequently, when dealing with the mechanical properties of material aggregates, one or the other of the above approaches were in turn employed by different physicists. Before turning to other properties of material systems I shall briefly refer to an example from the branch of physics most closely related to Statics, namely Hydrostatics. Pascal, in his treatise on Hydrostatics (5) enunciates a law for the hydrostatic "Machine for Multiplying Forces" (hydraulic press). According to this law forces exerted on the two pistons of the machine that are in the same ratio as the area of the respective pistons, will balance each other. Pascal puts forward two proofs. In his first proof he employs the "internal" approach. He commences by establishing the magnitude of pressure at any point inside the liquid, and from this he obtains the pressure in the liquid in contact with the pistons. Thus he derives the total thrust on each of the pistons and shows it to be proportional to the area-hence confirming the law. The other proof is based on the assumption that a body never moves by its own weight without lowering its centre of gravity. He finds the centre of gravity of the whole system and shows geometrically that when the weights acting on the pistons are proportional to their areas, the centre of gravity of the machine will remain fixed if the pistons move. Hence the pistons will not move, or in other words the weights are in equilibrium. This is of course an "'external" approach, as it only concentrates on the centre of gravity of the system as a whole and is based on the general principle that unless the centre of gravity is lowered, no system will move. It should be noted that Pascal's principle is equivalent to Stevin's principle of the impossibility of perpetual motion. The principle of the impossibility</page><page sequence="7">246 G. SCHLESINGER of perpetual motion, as we know, developed later into the principle of the conservation of energy. Thus if we look upon the different approaches to the treatment of material systems in the 17th century, in the way outlined, we can recognise in them the methodological rudiments of the two branches of physics developed in the 19th century-Kinetic Theory and Thermodynamics. For from the point of view of scientific methodology the significant difference between these two disciplines is not that one is in harmony with a mechanistic outlook on the world or that the other is more to the liking of Phenomenalists. The relevant difference lies in their embodying two different approaches-the approaches we are discussing here. The Kinetic Theory represents the "internal" approach to the study of the properties of material aggregates. It is an attempt to view the behaviour of material systems as a resultant of the behaviour of its molecular components. It interprets thermal phenomena in terms of the properties and interactions of the constituents of material assemblies. Thermodynamics on the other hand keeps aloof from definite assumptions as to the ultimate constitution of matter. It starts directly from a few very general empirical laws, mainly the two fundamental principles of Thermo- dynamics, and refrains from inquiring into the nature or "mechanism" of heat. 4. In physical science, the internal approach is generally preferred to the external. I think that there is no good reason for such a preference. There is no denying that a strong feeling in favour of the "internal" approach exists. One may admire the ingenuity of some of the "external" methods of approach but not escape the feeling that these do not provide a true picture of nature. Most of us will agree with E. Fermi who says: ". . . thermodynamical results are generally highly accurate. On the other hand it is sometimes rather unsatisfactory to obtain results without being able to see in detail how things really work" (2). The results of thermodynamics may be highly accurate and arrived at by correct reasoning from the basic premises, yet we are left with a sense of disstatisfaction that we were not given insight into "how things really work". Similar sentiments have been expressed by P. W. Bridgman, who says: "There can be no doubt, I think, that the average physicist is made a little un- comfortable by thermodynamics ... He feels rightly or wrongly that by the methods of Statistical Mechanics and Kinetic Theoly he has achieved more insight" (1). It is hardly necessary to state that neither of these contemporary scientists have been moved in their considerations by any sort of mechanistic philosophy. They are not worried about the absence of mechanical models and explanations in thermodynamics.</page><page sequence="8">TWO APPROACHES TO MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 247 What then is behind this feeling of uneasiness towards Thermodynamics ? After all the "explanatory power" of Thermodynamics is not inferior to that of the Kinetic Theory if "explanation" consists in the relating of the particular to the general, in subsuming a regularity under another more comprehensive regularity, or in rendering a particular phenomenon predictable on the basis of a universal law. For both the Kinetic Theory and Thermodynamics succeed in explaining the behavior of objects in terms of general laws. The Kinetic Theory achieves this by exhibiting the connections between the large scale behavior of individual systems and their internal constitutents, thus relating the behavior of these systems to the basic laws of mechanics. Thermo- dynamics on the other hand exhibits relevant connections between these same systems and the fundamental laws of Thermodynamics. These laws are as general as the laws of mechanics. Is it then that the laws of Thermodynamics are not as firmly established as those of mechanics ? No, nobody claims that. The basic laws of thermo- dynamics are just as well established as those of xnechanics. Neither is it the comparative rigor and validity of the logic employed in the two sciences. Perhaps the true reason is that it seems to us that when we explain the behaviour of an aggregate of particles as resulting from the individual pro- perties of the constituent particles we are providing a legitimate physical explanation. When, however, we reverse the process of explanation, we may feel that we have admitted final causes in our schemes. In similar fashion, an explanation of the path of a particle based on the summing of the elementary paths which make up the whole, appears to be in accordance with what we view as a proper causal explanation. But when we start from the other end and make the form of the elements of the path depend on some general condition imposed on the total path, we may again feel that we have admitted final causes. This feeling has been very adequately expressed by Poincare who says: "This molecule seems to know the point to which we want to take it, to foresee the time that will take it to reach it by such a path and then to know how to choose the most convenient path. The enunciation of the principle presents it to us, so to speak, as a leaving and free entity. It is clear that it would be better to replace it by a less ob- jectionable enunciation, one in which, as philosophers would say, final effects do not seem to be substituted for acting causes" (3). It may appear then, that if the behaviour of a part of a system is determined by laws governing the system as a whole, then the different parts must so to speak be aware of each other's state and in a planned and concerted effort act in a manner to satisfy the laws imposed by nature on the aggregate. Consequently, the attitude is adopted that while we may show that a particular property of a portion of a system follows from general laws appertaining to the whole system, it does not mean that we have discovered that it is determined or caused by those. This means that, in spite of all warnings and exhortations, we do at times unconsciously associate with the concept of cause the notion of "compulsion", and are not prepared to view it as a mere functional relation-</page><page sequence="9">248 G. SCHLESINGER ship between events. Th-erefore in order to "achieve insight" into the mechan- ism of the situation and be able to see "how things really work" we feel that we must break up the system under consideration into its smaller elements, the properties of which give rise to the collective properties of the whole. It will be illuminating to return briefly to Mathematics. It seems that with regard to our problem, clarity is much more readily obtained in Mathematics than elsewhere. Mathematics is a department of science where allegations that laws or arguments contain teleological or anthropomorphic implications have never been made. The past records of numbers, letters, and signs of algebra are irreproachable in this respect, they have never been found posing as "living and free" entities. Consequently any suspicion about an accepted mathematical theorem that it admitted final causes would at once be dismissed as absurd. It would, for instance, not occur to anyone to inquire whether the expression (x + a)", mentioned above, knew about Maclaurin's Theorem and expanded in the appropriate manner so as to satisfy it. Nor would such questions be raised when mathematics is applied to physical objects. Suppose we are asked to set up four poles to form the corners of a rectangle and stretch a wire of given length around them in such a way that the wire encloses the maximum area. The well known procedure is to differentiate the expression for the area and equate the result to zero. Now it is at once evident that it is absurd to ask: how does the wire know that in this particular position of the poles and not in any other it has to enclose the maximum area? No one is tempted to say that the wire must have per- formed the differentiation. It is perfectly obvious to anyone that the situation does not imply any conscious act on the part of the wire or the poles. The wire encloses the area it happens to enclose not as a result of a voluntary act. It is only we who know that for a certain arrangement the maximum area will be enclosed. And it is we who obtained this information by differentiating the area with respect to one side of the rectangle and equating the result to zero. It is just the same with Poincare's moving particle which describes the shortest path between two points. The particle is not aware of the form of its own motion and makes no decision whether to move one way or the other. It is only we who know that the path described will be an extrenum and from this information, together with some other information about the forces and constraints along the path, we can derive the exact shape of the path. Neither does it make sense to ask: but, why is the length of the path described always as an extrenum? For if you do admit the possibility of such queries, you might as well ask why two particles always attract each other according to the formula F G 2? r2 We, who in the past have observed many particles and the way they interact have come to the conclusion that there exists a regularity in their behaviour,</page><page sequence="10">TWO APPROACHES TO MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 249 a regularity which can be represented by the above formula. We, who know this formula now, predict that the next two particles will also interact according to that formula. But it is perfectly clear that when the particles act upon each other in the way they do it is not in order to conform with Newton's law of universal gravitation-they just conform. It ought to be clear then, that the predictions based on the Principle of Least Action or the Laws of Thermodynamics, do not entail awareness, consciousness, living forces, goal directed behaviour, and the like, on the part of inanimate matter. Particles are not aware of the Principle of Least Action. They do go along a particular route, but not by choice and they do move in a particular fashion but not in order to get to their destination within the shortest possible time. They just do arrive there in minimum time. Neither do the components of a thermodynamic system behave as they do in order to prevent the system as a whole from violating the laws of Thermodynamics, but we predict the behaviour of these components by knowing that the system will obey the laws of Thermodynamics. It is understandable that after the centuries-long battle against anthropo- morphism in science there should exist a strong aversion to anything that gives rise to the slightest suspicion of imputing living forces or consciousness to inanimate matter. But we have seen that in reality there is no such implica- tion in the sciences adopting the "external" approach any more than in those adopting the "internal" one. In both cases we start from empirical generalisa- tions and derive by logical steps certain results. And the reason why we get the impression of being confronted with a teleological explanation when the "external" method is employed, is strangely enough itself a lapse into anthropomorphism. For in human affairs it is usually the case that to comply with external conditions requires conscious goal-directed behaviour. If the total expenses of a family are not to exceed a certain fixed budget, then each member must be aware of this condition and act in co-operation with other members to comply with it. Or when we aim to arrive at a certain place by the shortest possible route, this aim has to be kept in mind all the time and each step to be taken in accordance with it. 5. To sum up, there are in general two methods available when dealing with systems, two ways of approach: an "internal" approach in terms of the constituent elements of the system, an "external" approach treating the system as a whole. The methodological difference between the Kinetic Theory and Thermodynamics may be viewed in this light and then they are both found to be continuous with earlier successful attempts to deal with the properties of aggregates. The preference for the K,inetic Theory over Thermo- dynamics is not necessarily an outcome of a mechanistic interpretation of nature. It may also result from the assumption that the "internal" approach provides more "insight" into the workings of nature. This, however, is an 6</page><page sequence="11">250 G. SCHLESINGER illusion. With regard to scientific theories the questions we have to think about are questions of their generality, truth, validity and usefulness. As long as the premises of a particular explanation are no more true than that of another, the logic employed no more rigorous, the predictions based on it no more numerous, there is no good reason to prefer it to any other type of explanation.
