<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOETHE ON NATURE AND ON SCIENCE. Second Edi- tion. The Philip Maurice Deneke Lecture Delivered at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, on the 4th March 1942. By Sir Charles Sherrington. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, London, and New York. 2s. 6d. 54 pp. 1949. This delightful hour with Goethe and Sherrington is the Philip Maurice Deneke Lecture delivered at Oxford on March 4, 1942, and first published in that eventful year. For the present edition the author has "worked over the whole lecture again." It is a careful and well documented study, and full of the flavor of the irresist- ible but often impossible Goethe. Although Goethe was an ardent student of Nature and the Sciences, and gave to the study of the shapes assumed by life the name by which it is now universally known, morphology, nevertheless Sherrington concludes: "Were it not for Goethe's poetry, surely it is true to say we should no longer trouble about his science. Such as it was, it is as science not important .... His enthusiasm as an observer of nature was great. But a new fact he met with was apt to send him on a flight of imagination into the unknown. Creative genius in literature, in science his genius longed to create. It could not always abide the waiting for further experi- ments and more knowledge .... Goethe, though de- voted to science, had not at root the scientific tem- perament. He had not, for instance, along with the urge to discovery, the sublime detachment of the sci- entific thinkers." In Goethe's time there had arisen a desire to cata- logue and arrange in order all the kinds of plants that are, the assumption of the time being that the kinds around us are still as at the creation of the world. Goethe, however, had noticed such differences between specimens of the same species that he thought specific form might be in a state of flux. The continual change which he suspected was going on in plant form Goethe attributed to the influence of environmental conditions, such as type of soil, light, warmth, moisture, etc. Thus both Goethe and Lamarck dissented from the Linnean "frozen" view of species, although the latter was the orthodox view. One recalls that the isotopic evidence of the continuous interchange of protein amino nitrogen with the environment did not then intrigue observers of biological continuity, and altogether there has been many a mutation since Goethe sang of change and flux. However, many of Goethe's ideas were less fortunate. For example, "Goethe never reconciled himself to the Newtonian notion of light, although it became the standby on the subject for the scientific world .... In following Goe- the's science, we are helped by his having laid down principles which in his view should govern scientific observations. One of them is that the conditions for observations should be kept as simple as possible, and for that reason should eschew apparatus. Prominent in his objections to the prism experiment was that the prism introduced heaven-knows-what complications. Essential for scientific observation was Anschaulichkeit 'obviousness' or 'naked clarity.' This clarity could dis- pense with mathematics,... which had brought ca- lamity to optics. He did not see that the use of ap- paratus is to simplify conditions. Nor, again, that mathematics can be a main means toward obtaining Anschaulichkeit. "As regards science, Goethe lay becalmed, so to say, in a small quasi-scientific backwater of no great ac- count. But Boyle had been starting modern chemis- try, and Lavoisier, Cavendish and Dalton had estab- lished it. Lagrange and Laplace had annexed the nearer heavens for Newton. [This while Goethe was dealing with material forces by notions ad hoc out of his own fancy.] Further, Goethe's pronouncements were shot through with anthropomorphism, which, unless used purely as metaphor, is the occult. In Goethe it is the occult. Polaritat, morphogenesis, and so on, have 'yearn- ings,' 'likes,' 'will,' etc. We are back in the medi- aevum and early renaissance." Goethe's isolation from the main stream of the science of his time finds an interesting parallel in a sort of po- litical becalm, a lack of insight into the significance of the French Revolution and a failure to appreciate its positive aspects. Although he does not stress the paral- lel, Sherrington finds that "the sans culottes of the revolution were to him a hopeless problem as well as a repellant mob. Thompson's poem on 'Liberty' failed because 'there was no poetry in the theme "Liberty."' The cry egalite was hateful to him, even in its context of that great assertion of the rights of man, that doing away with feudal privilege.

Goethe is our friend, "but the truth is even more our friend." EVELYN HOWARD</page></plain_text>
