<plain_text><page sequence="1">1104 Notes and Communications Durkheim and Veblen on the Social Nature of Individualism A large literature interprets the lives and work of Frenchman Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) and American Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929), but no systematic compari- son of their thought exists.1 Despite their importance to the history of economics and social theory, social scientists and historians pay little heed to the structural similarities as well as the important divergences in their work. Of particular interest to evolutionary economists is their explanation of the social genesis and nature of individualism, on which I shall focus. However, a caveat is necessary. Durkheim's views on the social induction of indi- vidualism are more complex than indicated here.2 My intent is simply to show how they supplement and complement Veblen in order to strengthen the latter's critique of the individualism of neoclassical economics. Specifically, the revival of radical individual- ism by libertarians and Austrians and its use as an ideological and political tool is glar- ingly apparent in their attacks on the more authentic individualism and egalitarian collectivism espoused by institutionalists among others. This makes articulation of Durkheim's theoretical position relevant to a better understanding of Veblen as well as a fulcrum in undermining laissez-faire economics. Veblen and Durkheim had difficulty separating organico-psychic and tropismatic-instinctual factors, that is, pre-social features of the individual organism, given at birth and independent of social influences, from behavior induced by the social environment.3 Admittedly, this problem still frustrates social scientists, so it is not sur- prising that neither man could resolve it. But the American, in particular, struggled with it for decades, unable to deal with it altogether satisfactorily, even in what he considered his best work, The Instinct of Workmanship (1914). Interestingly, Durkheim wrote, in terms convergent with Veblen, that- To say that innate characteristics are for the most part very general, is to say that they are very malleable, very flexible, since they can assume very different forms. Between the vague potentialities which constitute man at the moment of his birth and the well-defined character that he must become in order to play a use- ful role in society, the distance is, then considerable. It is this distance that edu- cation has to make the child travel.4 The plasticity and malleability of the species in Durkheim's view of human nature is thus in evidence. Veblen's knowledge of social psychology and, especially, of cultural anthro- pology led him to similar conclusions. As sociologists of knowledge, Durkheim and Veblen had at least this in common-they drew upon both the a priori and the empirical traditions, meaning that they believed that humans have both an innate capacity to rea- son regarding such categories as time, space, motion, and causation and an ability to absorb data from the external world, that is, the world of observable phenomena.</page><page sequence="2">Notes and Communications 1105 Both men were strongly critical of the abstract, autonomous individual; indeed, the radically intransigent individualism of the myth of the self-made person mostly fomented mockery and satire in the writings of Veblen. To both men, neoclassical eco- nomics, in particular, is largely an expression of the cult of modern individualism. Durkheim's holism is evident in his statement that society is not a mere sum of individu- als; rather the system formed by their association represents a specific social reality which has its own characteristics. It is in the nature of this social reality, not in that of its component units, that one must seek the immediate and determining causes of the facts appearing there. Durkheim saw that autonomy of individuals is itself socially generated and correlative with the development of the individual personality, social differentia- tion, and the morality of individualism as well as the absurd cult of the individual. But, as with Veblen, his strong social determinism urges us to believe that the individual's personal, spontaneous, private, egoistic desires and activities are themselves socially gen- erated rather than simply rooted in the organism. Even the norms that appear to be the individual's "sensual appetites" are in part socially induced. In short, the values which become an integral and constitutive part of the individual personality are socially gener- ated. Society lives and acts within us and, in Veblen's analysis, that which casually appears to be personal and distinctive is more likely to be impersonal and uniform because it is largely a social product. States of consciousness are common to the mem- bers of the same society. Veblen's essay on "The Intellectual Pre-Eminence of Jews in Modern Europe" sheds light on the intellectual iconoclasm of Jews and hence their "individualism."5 Veblen's argument is that Jewish intellectuals are marginalized, that is, they are no lon- ger at home among their own people because they are skeptical of its dogma and mores. But they are not at home among the gentiles either since they do not share their beliefs and outlook. Their detachment, indeed, isolation from both groups, breeds an intellec- tual iconoclasm which bodes well for the development of scientific curiosity and schol- arly acumen. But these are qualities with a difference, for the "individualism" thus fostered by marginalization produces novelty and innovation; in short, the creativity which keeps them separate them from Jew and gentile and from many of their fellow sci- entists and scholars. For Veblen and Durkheim it was possible without contradiction to be an individualist even though the individual is a product of society rather than its cause. Veblen's explanation of the genesis of "individualism" is expressed in various places in his writing but, perhaps, most prominently in Imperial Germany and the Indus- trial Revolution in 1915 (1964). Where individualism is lacking, or at least deficient, in its development as in Imperial Germany, the discipline of workday life through these centuries has on the whole been of that personal character that throws immaterial qualities and relations into the foreground of habitual attention and leads to valuations of differential authen-</page><page sequence="3">1106 Notes and Communications ticity, dignity, caste, class, precedent and precedence; it has in an exceptional degree been the discipline of court, camp, bureaucracy and police.6 He contrasted the causes of the lack of individualism in the German national character with the individualism of the English which is due to the "town meeting, the open mar- ket and the open road.",7 And, to this, he added the impact of the machine process; thus the contrast between the German and the English may also be explained by proximity to the bias and the conditioning of machine technology. As Veblen put it in explanation of the German proclivity for social and political subordination, it has not- taken its bias from the machine shop and the large industry. The intellectual bent and the principles of systematic thinking induced by such discipline do not lie parallel with the mechanistic conception, but rather fall in with that higher range of habits of thought that are spoken of as idealistic, spiritual, tran- scendental; that lead into generalization and subsumptions under immaterial and ulterior categories,-transcendental in the sense of seeking precision and finality by recourse to conceptions that transcend the actualities of sense per- 8 ception. The social genesis and social nature of individualism is a fundamental theme or axiom underlying Durkheim's sociology and one of his most revealing comments was this: [S]ocial action does not confine itself to demanding sacrifices, privations, and efforts from us. For the collective force is not entirely outside of us; it does not act upon us wholly from without; but, rather, since society cannot exist except in and through individual consciousnesses, this force must also penetrate us and organize itself within us; it thus becomes an integral part of our being and by that very fact this is elevated and magnified.9 It was preceded by this attack on volitional individualism: Nothing we know authorizes us to believe in the possibility of such spontaneous generation.... With autonomous individualities, as are imagined, nothing can emerge save what is individual, and consequently, co-operation itself, which is a social fact, submissive to social rules, cannot arise. Thus, the psychologist who starts by restricting himself to the ego cannot emerge to find the non-ego.10 It was not individuality and individualism per se that Veblen and Durkheim tried to eliminate from consideration by social scientists. Instead, it was the artificial, abstracted conception of individualism that flourished in neoclassical economics and in political philosophy going back to Hobbes. Neither intended either to eradicate the individual or deify society, nor believed it possible to derive either society or what is social in the individual personality from the individual as such, or from exchange or contractual relations rooted in the aggregation of discrete individuals. In short, what- ever differences existed between Veblen and Durkheim must be "set against a very large</page><page sequence="4">Notes and Communications 1107 common background of premises regarding the nature of society and its priority in the development of individual mind, self, and consciousness.""1 The radical individualism that neoclassical economists claimed lay at the base of homo economicus is thus shown by Veblen and Durkheim to be social psychologically inadequate and anthropologically unsustainable as well. To illustrate the nature of the false image of humanity portrayed by the radical indi- vidualism of neoclassical economics, consider the view of the genesis of private property held by both Veblen and Durkheim. Property in the beginning had no existence save as an undifferentiated element of the social structure. Both men asked, under what cir- cumstances did some individuals attain such identity and force of personality that prop- erty could be transferred from the collectivity to the single individual? Part of their answer is that this occurs through the promulgation of the myth of the metaphysical prepotency of individuals and the promotion and acceptance of the myth of individual- ism by both self-serving individuals and the underlying population. The rest of the answer lies in Durkheim's theory of the religious origins of private property and in Veblen's view that it began in primitive tribes with the seizure of women, an interpreta- tion that Durkheim believed Veblen could not substantiate. They thus disagreed over the origins of private property, Durkheim attributing it to the religious convictions of primitive tribes and Veblen blaming coercive gender exploitation. While Veblen's theory of status emulation forms the basis of his social theory, Durkheim saw a conflict between two consciences, both of which are equally basic to the motivation of the whole process of individual and social development: There are in each of us ... two consciences: one which is common to our group in its entirety which, consequently, is not ourself, but society living and acting within us; the other, on the contrary, represents that in us which is personal and distinct, that which makes us an individual . . . There are, here, two con- trary forces, one centripetal, the other centrifugal, which cannot flourish at the same time. We cannot, at one and the same time, develop ourselves in two opposite senses. If we have a lively desire to think and act for ourselves, we can- not be strongly inclined to think and act as others do. If our ideal is to present a singular and personal appearance, we do not want to resemble everybody else. 12 Veblen never denied that internal motivation could appear personal and distinct, that is, individual to both claimants of individualism and their observers. He simply argued that in reality most individuals were primarily emulatory in terms of the motivation and thrust of their behavior.13 But Durkheim saw both centripetal and centrifugal forces at work and concluded that they establish a tension in most individuals between what is unique to the individual and what is imitative. Veblen and Durkheim held a critical view of both David Hume's empiricism and Immanuel Kant's apriorism. Both doubted that the categories of the mind could ade- quately be explained by aggregate individual experience or apriorism. But how were the mental categories to be explained? They felt that certain neuropsychological capacities</page><page sequence="5">1108 Notes and Communications existed which made language and thought possible yet their emergent forms were largely a matter of cultural and social ecological instruction. Veblen and Durkheim thus con- verged on a social structural explanation of the primary and constitutive aspects of human thought. Those who attribute to Durkheim or Veblen a purely passive view of the individual in relation to society have not read them carefully. In fact, both view humanity as able to select salient ideas and act upon them. What they undercut was the utilitarian view of humanity that narrowly emphasized it as an autonomous, self-starting, self-sufficing, dis- crete, and self-stabilizing agent. As Veblen once put it, The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated, definitive human datum, in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another. Self-imposed in elemental space, he spins symmetrically about his own spiritual axis until the parallelogram of forces bears down upon him, where upon he follows the line of the resultant. When the force of the impact is spent, he comes to rest, a self-contained globule of desire as before. Spiritually, the hedonistic man is not a prime mover. He is not the seat of a process of living, except in the sense that he is subject to a series of permutations enforced upon him by circumstances external and alien to him. 14 For Veblen and Durkheim, society is not simply a collection of newly and spontane- ously emergent individuals but an entity which has existed antecedent to those who now compose it and which will live on after they die. It influences them more than they influ- ence it. They both reject the conception of the individual given primacy by the neoclassi- cal economists in which the hypothetical isolated individual functioning in the exchange mechanism of the market is happier and freer than when bonded to society. To treat the broader social outlook and values of the community as possessing proper- ties different from those of the individual does not suggest anything "metaphysical" in the perspective of either man. Thus, to both Veblen and Durkheim "individualism" itself is a product of social development; far from individualism being the elemental condition and society a derivative of it, individualism only gradually and recently emerged within the social order. Although Durkheim and Veblen were highly critical of individualism, they did not look to the restoration of traditional forms of social hierarchy and order for the resolu- tion of the problems that individualism brought in its wake. The social, moral, and political isolation of self-interested individuals had led to a social crisis to be sure, but its resolution did not lie in an obsolete authoritarianism. Rather, its resolution required new forms of social control and solidarity. In Veblen's egalitarian system, this presup- posed an "industrial republic," a commonwealth of masterless men; in Durkheim's, a</page><page sequence="6">Notes and Communications 1109 polity which would reintegrate malintegrated individuals into a more harmonious social order. Probably also, in the ideal schemes of both men, the role of science would be effective in integrating individuals into the fabric of society, although Veblen's aspi- rations were more radical than Durkheim's in terms of producing a flattened or leveled social order.15 The dependence of human thought upon social structure is, of course, evident in Durkheim's corpus and the same could be said of Veblen, but like Durkheim he had dif- ficulty distinguishing between social ecological factors and those bred into the genetic structure of the mind. The capacity for classification and for conceptual thought and abstract thinking is, of course, a result of the processes of neural evolution, a view that the two men shared. In Durkheim, one thus finds a theory of human nature not too dif- ferent in its essentials from that of Veblen. Although both Durkheim and Veblen acknowledged the significance of radical individualism as a highly influential mode of thought and behavior since early modern times, they also viewed it as a form of social misrepresentation. Their explication of indi- vidualism puts in evidence (1) their critique of the proponents of radical individualism such as Herbert Spencer, Adam Smith, and Carl Menger, whose views rest on similar social theoretical assumptions; (2) the individualist social type drawn from early modern and modern history which claims to be self-sufficient but nevertheless relies on ahistorical, acultural, anthropomorphic images of itself to validate its claims; and (3) their claim that individualism in all its forms is socially induced, not spontaneous or self-willed. This confirms Veblen's and Durkheim's view that "individualism" is an ideo- logically loaded doctrine that often serves as a form of political legitimation and false consciousness and functions to maintain the status quo or, worse yet, a reversion to the archaic social atomization of radical libertarianism and Austrian economics.

Stjepan G. Mestrovic situates Veblen's and Durkheim's ideas in fin de siecle Western intellectual history. Mestrovic is inter-</page><page sequence="7">1110 Notes and Communications ested in the similarities in their social theories and criticism and makes no real effort to explain their differences; he stresses the commonality in their outlook for his own purposes, which focus on larger trends in late nineteenth century thought and the usefulness of these trends in understanding the "barbarian temperament" in contemporary America life and cul- ture. To illustrate, Thus, Durkheim's concept of anomie is generally understood by contemporary sociolo- gists as the overly rational normlessness, when, in fact, Durkheim referred to it as a state of infinite desires which afflicts the core of society, not its deviant subcultures. He used this concept in its full range of fin de sicle meanings to denote a strange and paradoxical condition of progress as well as Nietzschean degeneration which results in pessimism, disenchantment and sorrow in society. His usage is commensurate with similar concerns by his fin de si&amp;le colleagues, including Veblen's use of the term "conspicuous consumption."
