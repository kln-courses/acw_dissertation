<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY In the Festschrift Ernst Windisch, which appeared at Leipzig in September, 1914, I published a contribution with the above title. As this contribution would not be accessible in this country during the period of the Waj and the subject was one likely to interest a good many members of the Royal Asiatic Society, I read at the Society's meeting on February 9, 1915, a paper based on that article. For the benefit of those who were not present on that occasion I here give the gist of the paper in the hope that if any of the views put forward are unsound, they may in the interests of scientific truth be corrected by criticism. In the earliest product of Indian literature, the Rigveda, the gods, being largely personifications of natural phe nomena, were only vaguely anthropomorphic. To the imagination of the poets of the hymns the gods were outwardly differentiated mainly by the weapons they wielded or the animals that drew their cars. They were not as yet iconographically represented. Literary evidence indicates that regular images of gods were not made till the latest Vedic period. They were known in the middle of the second century B.C. to the grammarian Patanjali and most probably also to Panini nearly two centuries earlier. While in tlie Rigveda the outward shape of the gods is still shadowy, we find them in an archaic episode of the Mahabharata, the story of Nala, appearing with definitely normal human figures. But in other parts of the Mahabharata, in the Ramayana, the Puranas, and classical Sanskrit literature, the most important deities</page><page sequence="2">126 THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY HINDU I CON OG It A PHY are described as having four arms and one of thein as having four heads also. None of these works, in their present form at least, can be regarded as dating from earlier than the beginning of our era. The same monstrosity appears in the oldest sculptures of Hinduism from the fifth century A.C. onwards, and has remained a characteristic of that religion ever since. This new feature is most conspicuous in Brahma, Visnu, and Siva, both in literature and sculpture. All three have four arms which hold the symbols distinctive of each. But Brahma has four heads as well. In literature he is called catur-mukha, "four-faced," and in sculpture he is regularly represented with four heads as well as four arms. Visnu is characteristically called catur-bhuja, " four armed," while his images regularly have four arms, but never more than one head; and the cakra which he holds is his most distinctive symbol. Siva never appears either in literature or sculpture with more than one head; and the symbol by which he may always be identified is the trident (trisula). The evidence of numismatics takes us back to the end of the first century A.c. Siva is still found represented as two-armed on coins of Kadphises II after the middle of the first century A.c. But in the reigns of his successors Kaniska, Huviska, and Vasudeva four-armed figures of Siva begin to be common beside two-armed figures of the same deity. In course of time the number of arms and heads came to be increased in Hindu iconography. From the eighth century onwards Visnu appears with eight arms, Siva with eight, later with sixteen arms. Skanda or Karttikej'a, god of War, who is already characterized as sad-dnana, " six-faced," in the Epic, appears in later sculpture with six heads and twelve arms seated on his vdhana, the peacock. The demon Ravana, described as ten-headed in the epics, is represented in the Kailasa</page><page sequence="3">THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 127 temple at Ellora with a large number of heads and ten arms. Several Hindu deities are, however, never icono graphically represented in early times with more than one head and two arms, their identity being sufficiently indicated by the animals with which they are associated. Thus Indra is recognized by his elephant, Surya by the seven steeds of his car, Ganga and Yamuna by the crocodile and the tortoise on which they respectively stand, and Laksmi by the two elephants between which she is seated on a lotus. The period at which the innovation of many arms and heads was introduced into Indian iconography can be fixed with some definiteness. Literary evidence shows that images of the gods were familiar in the middle of the second century B.C., and the sculptural evidence of the Sanchi gateways indicates that about the same time the figure of the goddess Laksmi with normal human shape had already attained the well-established type which it has preserved ever since all over India. Numismatic evidence shows that while Siva was still represented as two-armed about the middle of the first century A.a, four-armed figures of that deity began to be common not long after that time. The second half of the first century A.c. may therefore be regarded as the period when the Hindu gods began to be represented with four arms. How is this innovation to be accounted for ? The individuality of the Vedic gods, being vaguely conceived, was differentiated either by the species of animal drawing their cars or by the distinctive weapons held in their hands. When the ancient Hindu artists began to repre sent the Vedic deities in stone and metal they were faced with the necessity of individualizing their undifferentiated forms. They could do so in two ways. They could make the god recognizable by representing him with his vdhana</page><page sequence="4">128 THE DEVELOPMENT OF EAHLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY (which is a Vedic conception) as a distinguishing mark, while giving the god himself a normal human shape with one head and two arms. An example of this method is Indra with his elephant. Similarly, on early Indian coins Siva represented in ordinary human form may be identified by his bull Nandi. On the other hand, a single very distinctive weapon or symbol might suffice to identify a god. Thus on early coins the two-armed Siva may be recognized by the trident he holds in one hand. But if a particular deity had to be distinguished when both his hands were engaged in action, some other device became necessary for purposes of identification. Such a device was the addition of two extra arms to hold the characteristic symbols of the god. That such was the original intention is indicated by the fact that when all four hands do not hold the distinctive symbols, the natural hands are always employed for action or gesture, while the additional pair hold symbols. It is impossible to suppose that the artists were inspired by a mere taste for fantastic abnormities ; for why in that case did they never represent any deity with more than two legs ? They departed, however, from the direct statements of the Rigveda regarding the heads and arms of the gods. For an examination of that Veda shows that the shadowy forms of the gods were imagined to resemble those of men in having one head and two arms. Nevertheless the conception of a plurality of heads and arms is traceable to the Rigveda itself in the form of figurative expressions, which later lent themselves to a concrete interpretation. Thus the god Agni is spoken of as three-headed, because the sacrificial fire burns on three altars; he is also said to be seven-handed, because the conventional number of his flames is seven; and the Creator Visvakarman (an earlier form of Brahma) is described as having arms on all sides (viSvato-bdhu), and as facing in every direction (visvato-mukha) to indicate</page><page sequence="5">THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 129 his universal activity and his all-seeing nature. Such expressions naturally suggested the representation of Brahma with the four heads and four arms which remained characteristic of this god in Indian icono graphy. As the Rigveda contained no suggestion of many heads iu the case of the other two leading gods, Visnu and Siva, neither of them was represented with more than one head. But the practical need of four arms being here the same, two additional arms were given in their cases also, each hand holding one of the four respective symbols that had come to be regarded as characteristic of these deities. Owing to the frequency of the images of the great gods, and the extension of this new feature to several others, the possession of many arms, and to a less extent of many heads, came to be considered a "characteristic of divine beings. Hence the intrusion of this abnormity of Hindu iconography into the art of Mahaydna Buddhism during the last centuries of its existence in India. Thus an image of the Bodhi sattva Avalokitesvara found in Orissa appears with four arms, and another at Kanheri (near Bombay) with eleven heads. It has been suggested that these monstrosities were derived from some form of popular religion. But this assumption is unsupported by evidence, whereas the notion of many arms and heads can be shown to have its source in the oldest Veda. There are, moreover, many indications that the religious art of ancient India was strongly influenced by the literature of the Brahmins. Thus scenes from the Sanskrit epics are often found represented in early Indian sculpture ; and there are several technical works in Sanskrit which give minute rules for the construction of divine images. Even in the early Buddhist .religious art of India the sculpture shows a distinct literary basis. Thus at Bharhut several Jataka stories were represented and actually named ; and the JRAS. 1910. 9</page><page sequence="6">130 THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE KAUTILIYA carvings on the great Boro-Budur temple in Java largely represent scenes from the Jataka book. It has further been suggested that the introduction of many arms and heads into Hindu iconography is due to Semitic influence. But such influence at so late a period as that in which the innovation arose seems quite out of the question, while on the other hand it is easily explained from purely Indian antecedents. It has also been assumed that the new conception of the gods possessing many arms was simply intended to symbolize the superhuman strength of the divine powers. But here it must be remembered that the abnormal number of arms was at first only four and not many, the latter only appearing as a later development. On the other hand, the addition of two more arms can be much more definitely explained from the practical needs of the Indian artist, as indicated above. The main conclusions here arrived at are these : (1) The representation of gods with four arms began in the period 50-100 A.c. (2) The notion of the gods having several arms and heads was indigenous to India, having been suggested by figurative expressions occurring in the oldest Veda. (3) The purpose of the innovation was the practical one of supplying a means of displaj'ing the symbols without which the gods could not be adequately identified when represented by themselves apart from the adjunct of a vdhana. _ A.
