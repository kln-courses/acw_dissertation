ADAMSON THE natural processes of birth and death were always considered with a considerable degree of awe and fear by most peoples in antiquity; both processes were under the influence of powerful deities who might cause harm to members of the society. It is not surprising therefore that the birth of an infant had to be accompanied by ritual and cult practices, designed to ensure good health for mother and child. The goddess Ninharsag was the supreme Sumerian goddess of childbirth in ancient Mesopotamia. Among the deposits found in the early 'Eye Temples' at Tell Brak, near the Habur river which now lies within the state of Syria, was an 'eye idol' engraved with a stag, the symbol of the goddess; it is dated c. 3000 B.C. or slightly earlier. Amulets of the same period (the Jemdet Nasr) in the shape of frogs were also recovered from the same site. It is probable that frogs were considered to be symbols of fertility or of childbirth.' Numerous clay discs, considered to represent birth stools, dated c. 4000 B.C., were found at Chagar Bazar which was also in the Habur area. Modelled female figurines squatting in the position of giving birth were discovered there.2 Later in time, literayv references mention the use of birth-bricks or birth-stones, both of which were usually used inside a house of birth (bit im-ti), but such records are only to be found from the early part of the second millenium B.C. onwards.3 It is known that Ninharsag had a chapel in the temple of Ninazu at E'nunna which was especially connected with childbirth.4 Both deities and humans used the birth-bricks, the special birth house and similar rituals associated with parturition in ancient Mesopotamia. In ancient Egypt too, childbirth required specific ceremonies, for the assistance of birth goddesses during and after parturition was essential for a normal birth. Numerous deities were associated with the act of parturition, but the chief ones were Hath6r, Isis and Neith, all of whom may have been assimilated to one another. Meskhenet was a goddess associated with the birth chamber and was also considered to be the goddess of the birth-brick itself. The pregnant woman was delivered in a special house of birth which was attached to the temples of goddesses. She squatted on two bricks when giving birth to her baby, being supported in the act by nursing midwives and by attendant goddesses of birth.5 The birth-bricks soon developed into a low birth-stool, the earliest representation of such a stool being sculpted in a birth house at Luxor, where the pharaoh Ammenophis III was born in 1450 B.C,6'The ancient Egyptians thus employed very similar rituals for parturition as the Mesopotamians, both for deities and for humans. The ancient Hebrews also used a birth-stool, but the pregnant woman may have actually sat on the knee of an assistant while giving birth to her baby.7 This latter method appears to have been the earlier of the two. It is now generally accepted that there were trade and cultural relationships between Egypt and Mesopotamia as far back as the early predynastic times in Egypt, but the importance of these influences, both tenuous and intermittent, is still in doubt.8 It is significant, however, that foreign influences in predynastic and early dynastic periods were mainly of a religious or military nature, the former predominating. These influences were initially centred on Upper Egypt, and the strong possibility was that</page><page sequence="2">SOME PARTURITION RITUALS 177 merchants from Sumer had sailed to Egyptian ports on the coast of the Red Sea in order to trade with the inhabitants of Thebes, rather than being forced to make the long, overland journey to Upper Egypt via the Fertile Crescent of Asia Minor. Further evidence that this was the preferred route may be adduced from the foreign (Mesopotamian) type of boats depicted on the predynastic Gebel el-Arak knife handle and in representations of boats in Upper Egyptian rock paintings.9 It is assumed that these influences permeated Upper Egypt entirely under peaceful conditions of trade, but it is possible that in part, at least, they were disseminated by military conquest.'" When merchants (or a conquering dynastic race) from Mesopotamia arrived in predynastic Egypt, they may indeed have imported their religious beliefs either with their trade goods or in the wake of their military conquests. Sumerian deities were almost invariably anthropomorphic, although demons and the Zii bird were notable exceptions. On the other hand, the primitive deities of Egypt were frequently theriomorphic, or represented in human shape with the head of an animal or a bird. It is at least arguable that theriomorphs were more primitive and earlier representations of deities, and that anthropomorphic deities were examples from a more advanced culture."11 At this period of Egyptian history, before unification had occurred, there is little doubt that Sumerian civilisation was much more advanced than in Egypt. Religious influences may not be readily identifiable. Nevertheless we can definitely state that Sumerian influences were important factors in Egyptian religious development. Lapis lazuli, a blue stone closely associated with religious ritual, was imported into northern Mesopotamia, being found among burials and also being used to make amulets, at least as early as c. 3300 B.C.'2 This stone was also found in predynastic burials in Egypt.13 The stone could only have come from the same source as that found in Mesopotamia, most probably being imported by sea into Egypt. The frog may have been a symbol of fertility or childbirth in Mesopotamia, but the frog- headed Heket certainly was a lesser birth-goddess of Upper Egypt.14 The supreme goddess of healing in the Sumerian pantheon was Gula, whose emblem was a hound. She was called 'Mistress of Heaven and the Underworld,"' being originally a goddess of death.16 In Egypt, the god Anubis was a god of the dead who assisted at the very important ceremony of 'weighing the soul of the dead.' In archaic times he was represented as a seated dog or as a man with the head of a dog. 17 It may be observed that the Mesopotamian deity may often be changed from female to male on arrival in Upper Egypt. From the archaeological and historical evidence, it appears that the use of the birth- brick and the birth house, both of which were closely associated with rituals necessary for divine and human births, originated in ancient Mesopotamia. That similar birth rituals were to be found in predynastic Egypt at a somewhat later date strongly suggests that these religious influences were derived from Mesopotamian sources, either by means of peaceful trade or following actual military invasion. Upper Egypt and Nubia were the sites which were influenced initially, but with the unification of the whole country under the rulers of the first dynasty, similar birth rituals were to be found in Lower Egypt and in the region of the Nile Delta. The birth-brick soon developed into the low birth-stool in Egypt, which provided no support for the back of the woman using it during parturition. The expectant mother was attended by midwives and nurses,18 whose duty was to support the woman and prevent the newborn child from being hurt by falling to the ground. It was significant, moreover, that the use of the birth-stool by the Hebrews was only mentioned in the Old Testament after they had come in contact with the Egyptians.19 This adds weight</page><page sequence="3">178 P. B. ADAMSON to the probability that their birth rituals were derived from Egypt directly and not by overland routes from Mesopotamia. The birth-brick however continued to be used by the common people in Egypt,20 and continued in use until Ptolemaic times or even later, although the birth house associated with temples may have fallen into disuse.21 Because the phenomenon of birth was recognised as an important religious event in the life of ancient society, it necessitated strict ritual and purification rites for mother and child after the birth, in order to ensure the well-being of mother and child, and also to preserve the rest of the society from the untoward effects of demons and evil spirits who may gain power at this time. But in addition to the religious aspect of the birth, it should be emphasised that the use of birth-bricks or birth-stool actually provided the optimum position for a woman in labour. The squatting positionor being made to sit very close to the ground, was found empirically by the ancient midwives to be the most satisfactory position for a woman in labour. The expectant mother was properly supported by nurses from behind, while the midwife in front of the woman could receive the newborn infant before it could fall to the ground. The birth-stool was very popular in antiquity and widely used by many differing communities, and traces of its use can still be found at the present time.22 This conservative approach to the delivery of children continued until the late seventeenth century in Europe, when the development of practical obstetrics and the intervention of qualified medical practitioners tended to encourage the pregnant mother to lie down on a bed. Only in the latter half of the present century has the position of the expectant mother during parturition been re-considered, and the ancient method of squatting or sitting once more been advocated by physicians.23 The important rituals associated with childbirth that have already been mentioned, were based on fear of a blood-tabu contamination, fear of unknown but potentially harmful spirits, and a desire to preserve the health of the child. Blood was held in great fear and respect in antiquity, particularly that which was associated with menstruation or with childbirth. It was vitally necessary therefore to perform a ritual cleansing of mother and child after parturition. Traces of such rituals are mentioned in the Atrahasis epic from Mesopotamia24 and in records from Egypt.25 Similar ceremonies were obligatory among the ancient Hebrews, for ritual uncleanness had to be properly removed by a priest.26 Although the Greeks and Romans also performed ritual cleansings following childbirth, Christians tended to follow the Jewish customs. The Church of England, for example, provides a short, official service conducted by a priest for women who have been delivered of a child (the 'churching of women'). This service is very similar to that of the service provided by the Jews (the 'prayer of thanksgiving for women after recovery from childbirth').27 The important rituals which were considered to be necessary to preserve the newborn child from all the dangers associated with its birth, were instituted soon after its delivery. The infant was given a ritual cleansing or bath, and then was carefully swaddled in cloths. When this was done correctly, the whole of the child was wrapped tightly in a cloth so that all the limbs were immobilised, leaving only the head exposed and capable of movement. The symbol of Ninharsag was rather similar to a capital Greek omega (2), and is representative of the swaddling-bands of newly-born infants, but it is only represented in art from early in the second millenium B.C.29 The ancient Egyptians, considerably earlier in time, used swaddling clothes (nwdt,w3b,t3m) for deities and humans.29 The Hebrews also swaddled their children,30 but apparently this custom only originated after their Exodus from Egypt. Swaddling was widely practised throughout the ancient world, and is still being practised in a few countries at the</page><page sequence="4">SOME PARTURITION RITUALS 179 present time.31 Its primary purpose was to protect the infant from malevolent spirits, but it had secondary results as well. The swaddled child certainly was more easily transported by the mother, especially if it had not been too tightly swathed in its swaddling clothes. But the child who had been born in Sumer or in Upper Egypt hardly needed to be kept warm by being so closely wrapped in tight clothing, because the climate is nearly always very hot in these areas. Indeed, tightly wrapped clothing would seriously interfere with sweating and with the mechanism of heat control of the child's body. It is probable therefore that ritual swaddling in Egypt was meant to represent the wrappings of a mummy, thereby acting as an effective disguise to fool the evil spirits which were lurking in the neighbourhood after delivery of the mother. It may be very significant that the ancient god Ptah, chief deity of Memphis in Upper Egypt, is represented as a male who is entirely covered in funeral wrappings, leaving only the head and hands free. Thus the appearance of this 'mummified' old man is quite similar to that of a swaddled baby. Ptah was a protector against evils, a helper of mankind and an important god of healing. As swaddling clothes were found much earlier in Upper Egypt than in Sumer, it is likely that the early representatives of funeral wrappings were later 'borrowed' by Ninharsag as ordinary wrappings for newborn infants. The swaddling of infants by the Hebrews, like the use of birth-stools, may have been a custom which was inherited from the Egyptians, since the inhabitants of Palestine were more exposed to Egyptian influences than to the more distant ones of Mesopotamia; its orginal association with funeral wrappings had been forgotten by Hebrews and by Mesopotamians. Swaddling was not usually maintained for a long time, often ceasing when the mother had been ritually cleansed by the priest. While the baby was being prepared after birth, and before swaddling bands were wrapped around it, there was an opportunity for inspection of the whole body for blemishes, and to straighten the limbs if minor deformities were found to be present.32 Swaddling of infants was also practised by the Greeks and Romans,33 who were apparently directly influenced by the ancient Egyptians and not by the Hebrews or Mesopotamians. They also believed that moonlight was actually harmful to the child and that swaddling protected it from the moon's rays.34 This was an unusual opinion to hold about the moon, for most Semites considered the moon to be a friendly deity, while both Greeks and Romans were of the same opinion. At the present time, swaddling of infants is considered to be unhealthy and potentially harmful to the child; the practice has been discarded in many westernised countries, although it is still practised in Russia, the Middle East, Japan, Yugoslavia, Mexico and Lappland.35 Also closely associated with the ancient rituals dealing with childbirth was the religious rite of male circumcision. Ritual mutilation of the female external genitalia was also widely practised in antiquity, as it is still being practised today, but in the predominantly male-orientated societies of the ancient Near East the operation on the male became paramount in social and religious importance. Although circumcision is a well-recognised phenomenon throughout the world, historical and literary references originate in those countries of the Middle East that border on the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Stone reliefs from the sixth dynasty of Egypt (23rd century B.C.) show the operation being performed on young males about the time of puberty.36 These are the earliest records so far discovered for this operation being performed in Egypt, and antedate the ceremony performed by the ancient Israelites by many centuries.37 Originally, however, circumcision appears to have been some form of initiation ceremony, possibly for young male Egyptians at puberty and certainly before they</page><page sequence="5">180 P. B. ADAMSON were married,38 and this too may have been its original significance among the ancient Israelites.39 Nevertheless, it is definitely stated in the Old Testament that the rite should be carried out on the eighth day after birth,40 thus clearly associating circumcision with the actual birth of the child. In Mosaic law, the rite of male circumcision came to be integrated with the Passover, which was a religious feast celebrated by the Hebrews to commemorate their escape from physical bondage and their commencement of a new life in the Promised Land.41 In a spiritual sense, therefore, circumcision may be considered to represent a relatively minor sacrifice of part of the body to God for the future life of the child.42 Circumcision was also practised by various other Semitic tribes, but not by all of them, and the custom seems to have originated in Egypt and then spread to these various tribes.43 In Mesopotamia, circumcision was not practised, although a stone model at Tepe Gowra bore witness that the operation was known in the northern part of that country.44 As the other subjects that have been discussed in this article show a flux between Egypt, Mesopotamia and Palestine, it may be significant that male circumcision clearly had no influence at all in Mesopotamia. As the rite was already known in Egypt from early in the third millenium B.C., it suggests that religious influences from Mesopotamia may have faded by the time of the sixth dynasty, and that Egyptian religious ceremonies were already beginning to be formulated on their own account without influence from any external sources. The Hebrew post-exilic rite of circumcision certainly can be directly associated with the other rituals connected with childbirth. The sacrifice of part of the body (the foreskin, or part thereof) would ensure the health and possible rebirth of the child.45 Such partial sacrifices to ensure the health and well-being of the rest of the body are recognised among various groups of people throughout the world.46 But the post-exilic rite of circumcision still fulfils the earlier, Abrahamic consecration of the Hebrews, wherein their god specifically makes a covenant with Abraham and his seed for ever.47 In this sense, therefore, Jewish circumcision continues to be an important rite which is obligatory on all Jews to perform after the birth of a son, unless he is medically unfit at that time. However, an uncircumcised child remains a Jew, though not within the covenant of Abraham. Strict adherence to the ancient form of ritual is no longer necessary, for the use of a flint knife for the operation is not obligatory. The attitude of modern Christians towards circumcision is variable. Coptic Christians usually circumcise their sons when they are 7-8 years old, but this age may vary; it is not considered to be a religious rite. The Church in the West does not insist on circumcision, and consequently the operation is now more usually performed for therapeutic than prophylactic reasons. The operation is not a religious ceremony and does not have to be done on the eighth day after birth; failure to perform the operation as a ritual is based on the arguments of St. Paul.48 However, if circumcision is to be done on the child, it is usually performed within the first few weeks of life. Islamic law insists that all Moslem males must be circumcised. The operation was done when the child was aged about 5-6 years, but among peasants it might be postponed until the child was 12-14 years old.49 The operation was considered to be a religious rite, but considering the age of the child at operation, complications could be severe and relatively frequent.51 Under the law of Islam, circumcision was no longer a rite which was closely associated with rituals related to the actual birth of a child. 6 Crag Lane, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, HG5 8EE.</page><page sequence="6">SOME PARTURITION RITUALS 181 NOTES 1.
