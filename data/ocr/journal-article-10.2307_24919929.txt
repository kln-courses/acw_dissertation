But  a European dream (in many ways parallel to the american dream) has raised  hopes and offered opportunities for democratic and peaceful development. As  F.J. Turner emphasized the importance of the frontier in shaping American char- acter, we can also see the importance of the  frontier in shaping the European  mindset. In terms of topological mapping, a frontier is often also a war -front.  Outside Europe as well, borders such as the Great Wall of China have defined  territory as a defended area. However, boundaries have seen not only war. Many  cross -border regions have in fact seen dialogue, communication, commerce,  change, travel, and mutual inspiration. European identity was strengthened and  defined through ancient reasoning concerning frontiers. According to Braudel,  the Mediterranean cannot be understood independently from what is exterior to  it. The first European identity was strengthened and defined on the frontier and  the values of Europe are best perceived along its borders. The light shines strong- est in the point of its source, but it is more appreciated to the point of its limit,  where darkness and brightness compete for space – and even for life. European  peripheries may be seen as a problem, yet they are the bastions of Europe and  today, like yesterday, they have frequently prevented the institutional collapse of  the center of Europe. Sometimes, an institutional breakdown begins at the pe- ripheries and then, like an avalanche, sweeps the center away.

A EUROPEAN UNION PROJECT Here I present the results of a 2008 project, “EU and Turkey: Connecting Identities,  Bridging Cultures”, supported by the EU, focusing on the values of EU membership  and, in particular, on issues regarding Turkey joining the EU. The project had what may  be defined as an educational objective: providing information and guidance to students  and academics on the concept of “being” an EU citizen today. The project explored the  Copenhagen criteria together with the “classic” elements of civil consciousness, par- ticipation and commitment. All those engaged in the project, from educators to em- ployees, embraced their European identity and committed themselves to explaining  and promoting their pro -EU viewpoints. When the project was launched we can say  that a European Dream, parallel to and able to compete with the American Dream was  shining. The initial idea for the project evolved from a research prospective, since we  discovered that a vast number of European citizens do not possess a clear sense of Euro- pean identity. We reached the conclusion that the “true” European citizen is a patriot  who is aware of their “ideal” heritage: in terms of specific aspects of European history  (while some periods are perceived as shameful). The burden of centuries of European  history makes it difficult to educate and motivate citizens to become European patri- ots – in fact, Europe’s past and present difficulties require citizens to understand, select  and reject a wide variety of facts and ideas. Consciousness is therefore a consequence of  education and the “European frontier” therefore lies in our minds and within our souls. University professors from Heidelberg and Ludwigsburg, from the University of  L’Aquila in Italy and from several universities in Turkey, with Canakkale taking the  lead, participated in the project. Thanks to the project, we visited nine Turkish univer- sities; we reached the borders of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Greece, Russia, and Bulgaria. Several  meetings were held in Germany and Italy and many hundreds of people have been in- volved in the project and its organization. Before, during and at the end of this project,  we carried out surveys, interviews, meetings with thousands of students in Germany,  Italy, Turkey and in the most historical and meaningful places in the world, from Ven- ice to Istanbul. After three years of hard work, we prepared a final report on the project, but it  seemed incomplete: we realized that a further clarification and elaboration was nec- essary. Above all, in the course of our project, we have seen the difficulties in terms of  dialogue with young Europeans. For a relationship with the classics, some recommend  a narrative style of “academic aristocracy”, others recommend “academic populism”1 in- stead. We tried to explain it in the simplest way, but we came up against many difficul- ties. From the beginning of the project, the data questionnaire was a big problem: in Eu- rope and in Turkey a small number of students were able to understand the basics of EU  1 V.D. Hanson, J.

Few had a clear idea as to the meaning of Europe and of Euro- pean identity (which was confusing for Italian, German, and Turkish citizens as well). In an age of question- raising, students are not satisfied with simple answers. For this  project, it was our job to provide answers for people and we discovered that sometimes  people had no idea about the subject. Generally speaking, we were asked strange ques- tions, because the issues raised were unfamiliar. Regarding Europe, many people do not  know the simplest aspects of what is at stake, let alone knowing how to answer ques- tions correctly. Even worse, with some crucial questions, we discovered that our answers  (provided by the most institutional of books) were not satisfactory: they were some- times contradictory and sometimes rather obscure. The initial educational project was transformed into a true research study.2 We thus  initiated a second phase from 2010 to 2012, in which a detailed analysis was of pri- mary importance, through a comparison with the results achieved in parallel interna- tional experiences. The final part of this second phase of our research work took place  in 2012, in England, Greece, Morocco, Italy, Poland, Serbia: precisely in Thessaloniki,  Fez, Catania, Warsaw, Belgrade, Manchester. We focused on the European borders. For  our purposes, the richest areas of Europe, in the Netherlands, northern Italy, Belgium,  Germany, France, were less important than European frontier areas. in Westphalian Eu- rope, conflicts were primarily about borders and jurisdiction over them, while EU politics  now has empowered neighbors rather than colonizing them.3 We periodically checked our analysis; for example, in 2010 the main points of this  volume were presented and discussed at the meeting of the International Sociological  Association, which was held in Gothenburg in September 2010. The last focus group  concerning the research was held in Manchester, September 2012. 2. FROM THE EuropEan DrEam TO THE EuropEan nightmarE By signing the Treaty of Rome in 1957, a process began in Europe which has influ- enced a political renewal in many directions: Spain and Greece were both helped in  the transition to democracy, Portugal and Poland were both helped in the transition  to a fully developed market economy. There is no doubt that Europe, a European  dream (in many ways parallel to the american dream) has raised hopes and offered  opportunities of democratic and peaceful development: to the south of the Mediter- ranean, from Morocco to Turkey; on the eastern border of Europe, in Serbia and Al- bania; in the far north, from Gdansk to Kiev (obviously, in different ways and for dif- ferent reasons). 2 F.

In Thes- saloniki, in 2011, the economic crisis was already tragic; in Fes, in 2011, our analysis  took place simultaneously with the effervescence of the tumultuous Arab spring. Once  more in 2011, from Romania to Hungary, from Bulgaria to Ukraine, afterthoughts  and suspicions emerged even in former communist Europe. While politicians and tech- nocrats were highly involved in attempts to find remedies and solutions, intellectuals  were the most pessimistic ones. Our research was characterized by interviews and focus  groups; in Manchester we found a gloomier description about the stalemate the Euro- zone found itself trapped in. During the years in which our research was being carried out, the Euro and the  EU itself appeared under a new light.5 The countries of the Eurozone appeared to be  tangled and interconnected in a web of banks, debt, overproduction and cross -border  lending. Thus, in the event of major insolvencies, mutually assured destruction seemed  plausible. While not every major problem is destined to end in disaster, large -scale bank  failure inside and outside Europe could lead to a chain of defaults. For some merciless  observers a crash was necessary in order to restore Europe’s soul, borders, duties and  rights. The idea of a European nightmare has frequently been advanced and can be ex- plained through two erroneous claims which have however gained support. On the  one hand, Germany and its allies have been accused of forcing countries located in the  Eurozone periphery to bear the full -cost of the debt crisis, causing economic recession  and social misery which threatened to destroy the very essence of the European Dream  (by not applying burden -sharing principles to allow such countries to recover from the  crisis). On the other hand, the EU has been accused of leaving Eurozone peripheries in  a state of economic stagnation causing mass unemployment of youth and political tur- moil. Clearly such claims depict nightmare scenarios for the EU. Generating turmoil, in July 26, 2012, the former Editor in Chief of The Economist,  Bill Emmott, claimed in an article that Europe was threatening the world.6 He wrote  that the global economy between 2002 and 2007 had the fastest five years of growth  that it had enjoyed in more than 40 years. Even though a war had started in Afghani- stan in 2001 and another war had started in Iraq in 2003, the attitudes of financial mar- kets and corporate managements were optimistic. In 2012, on the contrary, attitudes  4 L. van Middelaar, Le passage à l’Europe. Histoire d’un commencement, trans. by D. Cunin, O. Vanwersch- -Cot, Paris 2012 (Bibliothèque des idées); J.

From the Arab Uprising to the civil war underway in Syria, from the tension over  Iran’s nuclear program to that over the price of energy, many factors were widening the  range of fear and unpredictability. But, Bill Emmott wrote, the biggest source of worry  is much closer to home. it is Europe. The problem is not simply the fact that government  debts are huge, that growth is non -existent and that there is a basic disagreement between  the debtor and creditor countries about how the euro should be run. Those things are im- portant, of course. But the real problem is that the range of possible outcomes looks so wide. In order to explain these dire concerns, he quoted the possibility of Greek with- drawal from the euro and Italian elections, the chance that some countries might leave  the euro, defaulting on its debts, or that the currency might collapse. He quoted the  possibility of the Eurozone splitting into two, with different currencies for northern  and southern Europe. These possibilities, in his view, were non -existent and virtually  inconceivable, but they were real for corporate boards, financial institutions, and or- dinary people. So the prophecy was becoming self -fulfilling. It’s not only a European  Nightmare, but Europe threatening the world. 3. THE FRONTIERS IN CLASSICAL EUROPE In our research, we understood the idea that the first European identity was strength- ened and defined on the frontier. The best perception of the values of Europe is in its  periphery and along its borders. The light shines strongest in the point of its source, but  it is more appreciated to the point of its limit, where darkness and brightness compete  for space – and even for life. We referred to lines which are in the famous paper read  by F.J. Turner at the meeting of the American Historical Association in Chicago, July  12, 1893: What the Mediterranean sea was to the Greeks, breaking the bond of custom,  offering new experiences, calling out new institutions and activities, that, and more, the  ever retreating frontier has been to the united states directly, and to the nations of Europe  more remotely.9 The European Union was born to avoid a reiteration of huge massacres that cost the  life of millions of human beings.10 Two world wars left an apocalyptic toll of millions  7 J.

Robert Schuman, Alcide De Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer, Jean  Monnet had humility and a sense of shame. From many point of views, the Founding  fathers of the EU were at the fringes of the old Europe. In the post -World War II years,  they reached the peak levels of the European power, but previously they were periph- eral, marginal, borderline. They had nothing to do with the old European history, char- acterized by militarism and colonialism. The Founding Fathers of the EU are linked  to another European heritage. They were immigrants in the New World of a European  dream. It was a dream11 come true after everything they went through. Forced to summarize a very complicated and controversial history, in our research  we told the students that what people mean as classical civilization was born along the  frontiers of the Mediterranean, in a multitude of shores and islands. In that classical  Europe, the discoverers (for the first time in history) of freedom and self -government  were immigrants, comparable to those of the Mayflower. Coming from the primordial  boiling pot of the Bronze Age, they flew from the autocratic regimes located in a pre- -historical Balkans and irrupted on to the stage of human life. As free immigrants in  almost uninhabited Mediterranean domains, rich in land and poor in population, they  invented rules for conducting a new associative existence, unchained from the over- whelming dominance of an archaic noble birthright. Without the slavery demanded  by kings and landlords, in the Mediterranean colonies they constructed the first com- plete human alphabet; they discovered the meaning and the rules of an open society.  The so -called miracle was born in remote regions of the Ionian and Aegean, in distant  sides of Anatolia and Southern Italy, in the shady line where Asia, Africa, Europe are  now so different and they used to be so alike. Those primordial travelers, fugitives,  renegades, migrants, returned to mainland Greece, where they re -proposed the insti- tutional organization experienced in the colonies. Watching them closely, Babylonian  mathematicians and Egyptian theologians, Sumerian ideograms and Phoenician con- sonants, came to be immersed in the same melting pot. The iliad and the odyssey were  written in the Ionian language and Ionian were the first political, mathematical, medi- cal, sculptural, architectural, and philosophical Mediterranean discoveries. From the  frontiers, civilization shifted to the West. The contribution of Presocratics is a case in point. The so -called “Presocratics” were  6th and 5th century BCE thinkers who lived in the Mediterranean colonies at the eastern  or western fringes of the ancient world. The first volume in which we find the expres- sion “pre -Socratic age” is the allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie, written by the Ger- man scholar Johann Augustus Eberhard in 1788. In the twentieth century, the expres- sion was popularized by Hermann Diels in die Fragmente der vorsokratiker, 1903, and  was meant to mark a chronological and ideal difference: the Presocratics were thought  to be inferior to Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. They were interesting only in terms of be- ing predecessors. The suggestion of archaism implied the idea of a Canon and of a Clas- sical Period (represented by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). On the contrary, from Marx  11 R. Kagan, The Return of History and the End of dreams, New York 2008. </page> <page sequence="7"> Politeja 5(37)/2015 The European Dream... 61 to Nietzsche, all the Western unquiet outsiders were more interested in people living  on the fringes of classical and canonical ages. However, only Karl Popper gave the great- est importance on their relevance. His observations are in the context of his own episte- mological theory: science originate in some kind of imaginative explanatory narrative.  What distinguishes science is the regulative idea of truth, that is the correspondence to  the facts. Hypothesis, not episteme, was at the center of the primordial Mediterranean  approach; wonder, not dogma, was at the center of the pre -Socratic approach in the  shores and islands, towns and villages of ancient Mediterranean settlements. Popper says: The history from Thales to Plato is a splendid story. it is almost too good  to be true. This was the main theme in his Presidential address, delivered to the Aristo- telian Society in October 1958: “Back to the Presocratics”. The conference was firstly  included in an anthological book.12 At that time, Popper was known as a defender of  democratic systems of government and author of two books: The open society and its  Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism. Later, a unique book collected, for the first  time, Karl Popper’s engagement with Presocratic thinking.13 In these pages, Popper de- scribed himself as an amateur student of the Presocratics completely out of my depth  when an expert begins to argue which words or phrases Heraclitus might, and which he  could not possibly, have used.14 In this famous conference, Popper makes a bid for a spe- cific theory of knowledge, which is always an attempt to understand the world we live  in. Knowledge proceeds by way of conjectures and refutations. The critical approach  exerts something like an evolutionary selection pressure upon the theories and so encourages  their evolution towards greater truthlikeness.15 According to Popper, the only method of expanding knowledge is through an end- less feedback process of criticism. In his view, the great achievement of the ancient  Mediterranean thought was critical discussion, which is the only way to expand our  knowledge. The supreme appreciation of critical discussion changed the standard defi- nition as to the function of a school: the exposition of definite doctrines. A new tradi- tion arose in Ionia and was rediscovered in the Renaissance, especially by Galileo (who  understood the meaning of rational knowledge). The Ionian school is incorporated in  modern science. According to Popper, tradition of criticism had its main source in Io- nia, marking a crucial innovation in human history. Xenophanes is the author of the oldest fragments in this field. The Presocratics  rejected the previous Mediterranean account of a world (as in Homer and Hesiod),  which is god -saturated, where the gods intervene from above in all aspects of life, telling  humans what to do, frequently without explanation and understanding. For the Preso- cratics, the world is a kosmos, an ordered physical environment, rational and intelligible,  with no supra -natural supervision. In the well -known fragments B14 -16, Xenophanes  comments on the general tendency to conceive of divine beings in human form: 12 K. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations.

Ethiopians say that their gods are snub -nosed and black; Thracians that theirs are blue -eyed and red -haired. In presocratic and Mediterranean cultures, we cannot find a clearer expression of the Io- nian “intellectual revolution”. The passage from anthropomorphism to anthropocentrism  is extraordinary. In the Ionian tradition, we had the famous Protagoras saying: The Human  being is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not,  that they are not. Having deprived the skies of human forms, Xenophanes proceeds to strip  natural phenomena of mysterious significance. In the striking fragment 21B32, he says: and she whom they call iris, this too is by nature a cloud. Purple, red, and greenish -yellow to behold. In his de- mythologized account of human phenomena, there is, as a logical conse- quence, his thoroughly de -mythologized account of the physical realm. In Xenophanes’s  words, there is no Iris, the time -honored messenger of the gods. In Xenophanes’s words,  the rainbow is not a supra- natural sign from the gods on Olympus: the rainbow is only  colorful cloud. In the presocratic refusal of the traditional account, there is the begin- ning of European science: an approach to the world that employs direct observation  and prefers logical awareness of intelligible causes. From Aristophanes’ Clouds to Des- mond Tutu’s Rainbow Nation, Xenophanes heritage has been great. The cloud analogy  was used to represent the Internet as early as 1994.16 4. EUROCENTRISM AND FRONTIERS Right from his first pages Turner says that the american frontier is sharply distinguished  from the European frontier – a fortified boundary line running through dense populations.  As F.J. Turner emphasized the importance of the frontier in shaping american charac- ter, we can say that the importance of the frontier shaped the European mindset. Un- deniably, the frontier has been a recurring landmark of American exceptionalism, from  the heyday of Kennedy’s New Frontier to the electronic frontier of the Wikipedia edi- tors, which have been explicitly compared to the pioneers of Turner’s American fron- tier for their boldness and rejection of limitations.17 But while frontiersmen in the Wild  16 D.

It has  been said that in some way Europe was as an immense Far West,18 but the carnage over  boundaries was a commonplace in Europe, because it was well -known that it was on the  borders that the possibility of depriving others of their own border19 occurred first. In an  overpopulated Europe, terms like Hackordnung or Lebensraum were familiar to zoolo- gists and politicians. In terms of topological mapping, a frontier is often also a front. Not only in Europe,  historic borders such as the Great Wall of China have defined territory as a defended  area. However, boundaries have seen not only war: many cross -border regions have seen  dialogue, communication, commerce, change, travel, and mutual inspiration. Herodotus’ description is unequalled by a peculiar sensibility to borders and fron- tiers. Born in Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum in Turkey), Herodotus was at the bor- der of the Greek speaking world. He was the first great traveler who left us his diaries.  Moved by doubts and curiosity, open- minded and respectful of human diversities, he  is the archetypical reporter, according to Ryszard Kapuściński and to his wonderful  Podróże z Herodotem.20 Herodotus was not a fanatical sponsor of Greek superiority; for  that motivation he was severely disapproved of (for instance, by Plutarch). Toward the  people of Asian borders, in Persia, Egypt, and Lydia, Herodotus showed empathy: he  intended a common Menschlichkeit in the barbarian “otherness”.21 For many reasons, Herodotus’ vision of borders, in the Persian wars, is the classic  must -read. Xerxes and Darius thought that independent Greek cities were the only ob- stacle to the conquest of the known world. In the spring of 480 BCE, Xerxes crossed  the narrow Hellespont straits, just to wipe out the frontiers of his power, already im- mense. By defeating the Greeks, and reducing Athens to slavery, he would arrive to  absolute power: once let us subdue this people, and those neighbors of theirs who hold  the land of Pelops the Phrygian, and we shall extend the Persian territory as far as God’s  heaven reaches. The sun will then shine on no land beyond our borders; for i will pass from  one end to the other, and with your aid make of all the land which it contains one country  (The Histories, 7, 282). With these quotes, we stress one qualifying point for us: European identity was  strengthened and defined in ancient reasoning concerning frontiers. In order to provide  answers for the people involved in the project supported by the EU, we have been helped  a great deal by the publication of a book,22 which in its title states that the first identity of  Europe was born in a border place, at a periphery and at a frontier, at the margins of the  18 L.

Regarding Troy, in Homer, we found seminal definitions and  insights regarding the European heritage. Moreover, on a formal and organizational lev- el, the project sponsored by the EU was proposed and headed in Çanakkale, whose terri- tory coincides with ancient Troy, located 30 km south -west of the city. The case seemed  a sign of academic destiny. Çanakkale is the city that governs the territory of the legend- ary Troy, where, according to one interpretation, the first identity of Europe was born,  with Homer and Virgil, which then became canonical in Shakespeare and Milton.23 Finally, in the research we understood that not only was the first identity of Europe  born on a border and in Troy, but in an area which is now outside European borders!  Although located beyond the frontiers of the institutional EU, culturally Troy is a Eu- ropean tabernacle location, so much so that (as it can be easily seen among archaeologi- cal ruins), for sponsoring the new excavations at the site of Troy, which began in 1988,  Daimler- Benz was rewarded by UNESCO, precisely because they have worked in fa- vor of a “European cultural heritage”. The exclusion of Troy from Europe goes hand in  hand with the exclusion of Turkey from the EU. In our research we arrived at the con- clusion that the exclusion of Turkey is a disgrace, motivated by ignorance towards the  extraordinary vitality of its democracy and by an underestimation of the essential geo- political importance of Turkey.24 Ignorance about the greatness of the Ottoman Em- pire and of its heritage of tolerance and integration is part of an old Eurocentrism, an- tiquated and no longer appropriate. The peripheries of Europe can be seen as a problem, but they are the bastions of  Europe. Today, just like yesterday, they have prevented the institutional collapse of the  center of Europe. Frequently, institutional breakdown begins at the peripheries and  then, like in an avalanche, sweeps the center away. In our idea of Europe, borders count  a great deal. Often scholars talk about liberty and democracy, referring to the fascist or communist  experiences, which allow us to grasp the merits of freedom. It’s all water under the bridge.  It is history which does not return, while cases such as Turkey and Morocco, Tunisia and  Jordan, Albania and Hungary, Kosovo and Serbia, although very different, are opening up  a completely new dossier: very controversial, very instructive, and very urgent. 5. THE HEROES OF EUROPE Contemporary Europe is very different from the Europe which produced the killing of  over 60 million people in World War II.25 Current Europe is characterized by the con- vergence of science and the rule of law, more than by external conquest and by internal  23 R.

European society has always been a society of knowledge, where the legal system  has worked as an essential integrative mechanism, contributing order and co -ordination  to everyday routine. Consequently, in the ranking of professions, scientists and judges  are the two top positions. Even if some countries are in notorious difficulty, hones- ty and integrity require the same public care that any institutionalized religion does.  There are sinners, but they are uncivilized exceptions. Lord Bolingbroke said that history is philosophy teaching by examples. Heroes are ex- amples, symbols of a civil religion which could be accepted as a fulfillment of the best  human hopes. The central theme of every religion is not a form of national self -worship,  but subordination of territorial identity to ethical beliefs. True Europeans have rejected  the principle “My country, right or wrong” and its substitute “My party, right or wrong”.  As in the finest traditional churches, there are European civil heroes and they have the  normal cosmopolitan religious dimension, based on duties and dignity. From King Casimir to Napoleon, from Danzig to Vilnius, in its history many times  Poland was forced to struggle to define national borders. In same period it was shrunk  drastically or ceased to exist. After 1989, the rebirth of Poland is a symbol of the rebirth  of classical Europe. It is in many ways a miraculous rebirth (in T.G. Ash words: „it is  remarkable to see how the frontiers of long -dead empires re -emerge on the election maps of  post- communist democracies, including Poland’s most recent one. But neither geography  nor economy nor culture make inevitable fate. [...] Good politics, good constitutions and  good courts can, given time and luck, change the course of rivers26). About the Polish mira- cle, many heroes have been mentioned, from Karol Wojtyla to Lech Wałęsa. In memory  of the European heroes, we programmed the closure of our research in Warsaw, where,  on November 8, 2012, an international event celebrated Judge Giovanni Falcone, on  the twentieth anniversary of his killing by the mafia in Sicily. Judge Giovanni Falcone created the police operation known as Pizza Connection:  the most successful anti -mafia investigation in the postwar period, made possible by the  deep collaboration between loyal Italians and Americans. The old world of the Sicil- ian Mafia, made famous by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, in Sicily and in the  United States, is today over. This was said, in New York, 2011, by the Attorney Gen- eral Eric Holder (first African American to assume that role), commenting a final blow  against the New York Sicilian mafia. The engagement continues, but in other ways. Piz- za Connection was an impressive and enduring victory for freedom, for democracy, for  the republican spirit. It was also a majestic figure of the power of international collabo- ration. In Italy, judge Falcone was a lonely hero, but he was not alone in the USA, where  he was at home and where he is remembered in the most solemn way, as an American  hero. See the testimony of his sister, beginning precisely with the mention of the special  relationship between Giovanni Falcone and the USA.27 26 T.G. Ash, ‘As Poland Shines, Ukraine Sinks.

Many times Poland has been home  to a duel to the death between old and new: today it is a trench, like Italy, for the affir- mation of a cosmopolitan legality. A meeting was held under the auspices of the Italian  Embassy in Warsaw and with the participation of the highest authorities in the fight  against the mafia, such as the chief national prosecutor Pietro Grasso. Above all, of sig- nificance was the participation by the most prestigious American people who worked  with judge Falcone on Pizza Connection: US investigators such as Dick Martin and  Rudolph Giuliani. The achievement of Pizza Connection was huge: immediately after, Rudolph Gi- uliani began the hunt for Wall Street speculators, gaining further successes (mayor of  New York during September 11); Louis J. Freeh became and remained a very prestig- ious FBI Director for years. In L.J. Freeh’s book,28 Giovanni Falcone is the second most  quoted name, after President Clinton. In Warsaw, during the celebration of judge Falcone, we spoke a lot with students  following the meeting; they taught us an important lesson. Among Polish heroes,  an extraordinary figure is Maria Skłodowska Curie. She is the only woman to have  won two Nobel Prizes, and in two different disciplines. She is the only woman in the  French Panthéon, where she was buried (in 1995) with the greatest possible solemnity,  accompanied by the music of Berlioz’s Temple universel. Considering that the Pan- théon contains, in its frieze, the writing aux grands hommes, la patrie reconnaissante  (to the great men, the grateful homeland), her figure is an exceptional exemplification  of the concept of inclusion. In fact, she included herself in the history of civilization,  as a scientist, as a woman, as a mother, as a spouse, and, at same time, she was included  at a supreme Nobel level. Finally, she was included in the top – the biggest temple of  male chauvinism. In French culture the panthéonisation is the secular equivalent of canonization in  religious mores. Therefore, it is not far -fetched to talk of sanctity, a heroism in sci- ence, knowledge and culture. Women like Maria Skłodowska -Curie and men like  Judge Giovanni Falcone contain, in their lives, heroic in different ways, however rare  and immense, a light that illuminates Europe from the periphery to the center. Eu- ropeans like Giovanni Falcone and Maria Curie -Skłodowska are classical European  heroes. If we look at them, we have a confirmation that, in Europe, an indispensable  perception of human value is at the periphery and along its borders. What would  Europe be without people like Maria Curie -Skłodowska or Giovanni Falcone? Can  there may be a Europe of knowledge without a Europe conscious of its democratic  and republican security?29 28 L.J. Freeh, My FBi.

CLASSICAL EUROPE AND SELF ‐COUNSCIOUSNESS Our research has shown vitality, but, at the same time, uncertainty, in the values  of  peace, social consensus, international cooperation, certainly not absent across the At- lantic and in many other national histories and cultures, but which have been themed,  discussed, deepened in Europe in a special way. The financial crisis has produced a high level of insecurity both social and in terms  of ideals, but the values  of Europe may continue to be the basis of a compact between  rights and growth, capitalism and democracy. A common currency, a common history, a common culture, a common foreign pol- icy, a common social model, despite contradictions and afterthoughts, have, in the past,  been a hope of civil development and cannot today be obstructed by the euro crisis, but  relaunched, as a concrete proposal of coexistence.30 This target is reachable through institutional intervention which should be aware  of the great specific European legacy, and condensed into a European patriotism which  could be much more assertive than it is today. A widespread self -consciousness as to the  significance of the European legacy is necessary for Europeans, and for those who look  to Europe while ignoring the shadows that surround an experience that is sparkling in  other ways. In Europe, prejudice, chauvinism, and intolerance are not only addressed to Mus- lims or immigrants. A very well -known sentence summarizes the relations between  Germans and Italians: the Germans love Italians, but do not respect them; the Italians  respect Germans, but do not love them. We could continue listing similar prejudices  and stereotypes. In our perspective,31 educational intervention is an approach that seeks to implant  mutual understanding and to remove routine stereotypes.32 General assumptions of ed- ucational intervention are: humanity is the result of construction and education. So- ciety unintentionally creates the background for scapegoats and illiberal ideologies by  unintentional institutional arrangements. Law- abiding people can be drawn into illib- eral ideologies if they regularly meet easy opportunities for those ideologies. Removing  stereotypes and promoting dialogue is a permanent aim of a democratic country. The  promotion and maintenance of civil society requires educational intervention as a per- manent background for republican virtues. Educational intervention is an attempt to  make sense of the deep social transformation which is going on.33 30 J.

In spite of connections and inspir- ing exchanges with Islam, many polls show that mutual perceptions between Muslims  and Westerners are based on mistrust and fear. Moreover, there is a wide ignorance  about the Islamic civilization. In our search, we have found an exaggeratedly pessimis- tic perception of Europe and an exaggeratedly pessimistic perception of Islam. There  is a common pseudo -knowledge, characterised by massive ignorance about many sub- stantial factors. Finally, we decided to indicate that existing perceptions as McCulture,  borrowing the term in analogy with the very famous metaphors of McWorld and Mc- Mafia. McDonaldization of culture gives McUniversities and McStudents, in a fast- -track pick -and- mix fashion, constantly repackaging and reinventing the same basic  product.34 Above McCulture, we have educational aristocracy, and, below McCulture,  we have a mix of hunger and anger, where McMafia flourishes.35 In our EU project, the aim of symposiums, seminars, and workshops was to im- prove dialogues among the countries. Above all, our sociological intervention gave  us an unforeseen insight about the current educational system, both in Europe and  in Western Asia. The best weapon against intolerance remains education, which can  create solid foundations for an open society, respectful of pluralism and diversity.  Promoting republican and democratic values is particularly important during the  crucial formative years, when children are in primary school. But in our project we  discovered that even future educators are able only to speak generically about free- dom, tolerance, multiculturalism. The meaning of the best European identity is ig- nored. Our research has shown how poor the common knowledge of Europe is within the  school system, especially concerning the themes of citizenship. We found that in Euro- pean schools there is still a strong dimension of Islamo -phobic prejudice. There is also  a nationalistic rhetoric, still alive, mistakenly supposed as dissolved in the civilization of  the well- intentioned global village. The old nationalism was often racist, xenophobic,  chauvinist. Many believed that it had disappeared, but the reality is quite contrary – it  is strong, even if disguised. It seems less strong than it used to be, because it is expressed  in a different manner than in the past. Who stole the European dream?36 In promoting democratic identity (in the di- rection of the Copenhagen criteria), Europe’s educational systems are not very suc- an Journal of social science Research, Vol. 22, No. 2 (2009), pp. 189 -199, at &lt;http://dx.doi. org/10.1080/13511610903075837&gt;; idem, ‘Public Sociology Wars’ in V.

Some reports show that clearly; our research gave us new insights. Here, we  are speaking about an international problem, known and discussed in many ways.  Perhaps Daniel Bell’s book (listed by the Times Literary supplement as among the  100 most important books in the second half of the twentieth century), was the first  in a long series of highly controversial books defending the idea that universities and  academic culture are failing to serve the needs of contemporary citizens.37 From that  perspective, the current state of higher education in American universities was very  bleak. In his first big speech on education, President Obama (a clear beneficiary of an  aristocratic education) made clear that changes were desperately needed in the USA.  Part of the problem, he said, is that American schools have been engaged in “a race  to the bottom”, consisting in the adoption of low standards, in order to permit sur- vival in the school system of underprivileged students, even if they are performing  poorly in objective terms. Education statistics indicated some 5.1 million students in  the United States as English language learners, a 60 per cent increase from 1995 to  2005. As old concerns vanish, new concerns arise: many quote the waves of immigra- tion. Some observers note that a nation which once prided itself of being a melting  pot, now is searching an arrangement of the means to teach immigrant students. In  recent years, students learning English have flooded into small towns and suburban  districts, leaving teachers and the population under pressure. It is hard to assimilate  the newcomers and their children. In a souring economy, school’s financing challeng- es have intensified resentment over foreigners and immigrants, promoting proposals  which question about whether those people should be educated at all. Kids gravitate  toward unhealthy food items such as cookies or chips even when more nutritious  items are available. In a parallel way, the same concern is compelling in many European classrooms and  in many European minds. There is always a kind of European dream in the classrooms.  All the pupils are immigrants in the New World of the educational system. Within  classrooms of primary schools, alien immigrants and native born immigrants have not  in the right measure the kind of intense educational training they deserve.38 In our data  and discussions on education, it was easy to detect latent and uncivilized fixtures in  a sort of McCulture, even if apparently good to taste, ready and cheap for everyone.39  Tell me what you eat, said the French gastronomist Anthelme Brillat -Savarin, and i will  tell you what you are. Many European citizens do not have a clear idea about European identity. Above  all, they love their own country; this love is not a constitutional patriotism and they  do not have a cosmopolitan outlook.40 McCulture gives a sweet pick -and -mix offer of  37 D.

It is hard to be a good citizen; it is hard to raise  good citizens.41 Our classical Europe is insufficiently appreciated even by the people  who must teach the best of it. In Europe and America, in the Middle East and in the  world, in the schools and in the media, in universities and at home, for the young and  the old, for women and men, dissatisfied people have a right to be properly informed  about their roots and their dreams.42 BIBLIOGRAPHY Alesina A., Giavazzi F., Goodbye Europa.
