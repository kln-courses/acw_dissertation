<plain_text><page sequence="1">293 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Penelope and Odysseus in bed together at the centre of the oikos, and, on the other, the narrative of desire frustrated (myth), summed up in the strange foretelling of Teiresias that projects Odysseus' journeying far beyond the formal closure of the narrative. Thus, the Odyssey is seen to sustain 'a narrative threatened with fracture by the conflict of its ideological components, myth and Mdrchen' (though this argument is not related by P. to the ideology of e.g. patriarchy and the oikos which might also be thought differently to structure the teleology of the epic). This play of narrative voices prompts a consideration of the relation between an audience and narrative, a relation dramatized strikingly and repeatedly in the Odyssey. In particular, P. considers both the Phaeacians' reaction to Odysseus, to 'the kind of person he represents himself as being in comparison with what the name "Odysseus" refers to in the tales Demodocus has told', and also Penelope's reaction to ' a man who names himself Odysseus, who looks like the husband she has not seen for twenty years'. Thus P., unlike so many critics informed by narratology, turns to explore central categories of the narrative contract - the name, the subject - with a suspicion suitable to Odysseus polumetis; and the final three chapters of the book are concerned with Odysseus' name and namings. First, P. considers what the well-known Odyssean concern with concealed and etymologically significant names might indicate for an idea of character, character in narrative. Second, P. explores the manifold implications and ambiguities of the name of Odysseus and the process of his naming both for the epic and for its idea of the subject. Third, under the fine title 'The Noman-clature of the Self', P. traces the paradoxes that Odysseus' self-concealments raise for the logic of kleos, and, more generally, for the notion of a stable identity marked by a proper name on which so many discussions of kleos (and character) rest. It is here in the elegant moves between general argument and close reading that the thrust of the opening chapters is borne out. P. well shows just how general a question it is to ask ' to what does the name of Odysseus refer?', and just how important it is to understand the way in which critical questions imply a critical position. Several aspects of this short book could certainly be extended-the role of recognition in the Odyssey and its reading is underplayed; modern work is often sketched rather then investigated; the connections between ideology and narratology invite further analysis - but this is a stimulating, intelligent, and apposite book which will provoke further discussion in the best tradition of the essay form. P. offers his opening position 'as bait to those who relish such questions and as irritant to those who do not'. His book, I suspect, will admirably fulfil both of these expectations.

Pp. vi +-160. Stuttgart: Teubner, 1990. DM 38. The similes in the Homeric poems have always attracted attention. Lonsdale limits his focus to similes concerned with lions, cattle, and, (more unexpectedly), dogs, with some venturesome treatments of the motif of the dog as scavenger. His method is to consider the similes from five points of view: their position in the narrative, their ?

In general, this programmatic announcement is well carried through, though L. makes occasional slips; remarking, for instance, (39), that 'We will see that all lion similes are basically modelled on a single type (the marauding lion), involving the confrontation of men and dogs with a wild beast,' but on page 59 more accurately remarking of the long simile at //. 2.101ff. that 'the simile is not the marauding type, but rather a variation describing a lion invading the lair of a doe'. That is really not 'a variation' but something quite different. L. is good on the interplay between the animals, described in language with a marked anthropomorphic tendency and in terms of a psychology closely resembling that of men, and the men, who are seen as resembling beasts in their energy, movement, and mortality: 'The animal simile was a part of the poet's repertoire for explaining the meaning of death' (126). The cattle-raiding of lions is akin to the cattle- raiding of men, a heroic activity and a cause of wars; the lions who raid the cattle steadings resemble the Achaeans who raid the citadel of Troy, to kill the herdsmen (' shepherds of men') and prey on the defenceless creatures within. The similes help us to understand all that, and to see that all living creatures are at one in the pattern of their lives and deaths. The appeal of the animal images, to a society in constant touch with flocks and herds, predators and sacrificial victims, 'lies in the ready identification possible for the audience and the heroicized stature these pastoral activities attain when juxtaposed with the exploits of heroes whose KA4a the bard immortalizes in song' (20). Certain criticisms can be made. L. sometimes seems to me to go too far in finding or imposing patterns on the text. Thus he says of//. 22.317-36, the terrible passage where Achilles swoops on Hector, his spear-point gleaming like the Evening Star, gives him his fatal wound, and exults over him: 'There are several details in this passage which suggest the latent presence of the scavenger' (99). That is to say: 'The Hesperos simile, here a paradoxically tranquil comparison, looks back to the earlier comparison between Achilles and the deadly dog-star'-that is, to 22.29, where Achilles is compared to the bright star 'which men call Orion's Dog', that is Sirius. Sirius means the dog days,' and that encourages an identification with the rabid dog' (95). The connection, as three hundred lines intervene, seems thin to vanishing point. And: 'like a scavenger, Achilles with his spear lunges for the flesh which he had greedily eyed.' That does not, to me, suggest the action of a scavenger at all; especially as on the previous page (98) L. had compared the stabbing of Hector to something else, an act of rape. All this, that is to say, seems to me fantasy rather than something really present. Some details are worrying. Achilles stabs Hector iva ~vbxiS &amp;K~aTo~ 6AeOpos; that is not well translated as 'where death of the soul comes quickly' (98). In English the death of the soul is something quite different. Achilles does not tie the hands of his Trojan victims 'with a'rpEXTT'o;at XLT'cat' (90), a ludicrous image, but with the eVrln'ro,atV ljitdat ToVS aOvTol (fop?aKOV 7Trl aTpeTr7o?la xcTrcJl (11. 21.30-1). It is not right to say ' the lion appears only incidentally in hunting similes, and never actually as the quarry of the hunter in the forest' (22), cf. II. 20.396ff. 'Individual farm animals are not the object of special affection' (24), but remember the Cyclops' ram. The idea that when a struck shield 'bellows' at II. 20.260, 'the animal by-product that has gone into making the shield is re- animated, as if to suggest that in the chaos of war the animal on the shield sympathetically feels</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 295 the blow' (33) must face the fact that not only do doors bellow (Od. 21.48), but also wooden chariot axles can groan loudly under extra weight (I1. 5.838). The name Autolycus hardly means 'Self-Wolf', nor Demoleon 'Common Lion', in contrast with the sovereign lion Achilles (23 n.15); they mean 'Very Wolf' and 'Lion of the people', compare Demosthenes. It would have been more cautious not to say that the name Hypeiron, at In. 5.144, 'coincides with the frequent epithet and synonym of Helios' (53 n.5). Not every reader will accept that the comparison of Odysseus to a wind-blown, rain-soaked, hungry lion, at Od. 6.130, has 'erotic overtones' (17), or that when the poet says this lion is 'urged on by his belly', we are to understand that 'Odysseus' sexual appetite is expressed in terms of the lion's physical appetite (K\?TElr ~d s yaar'jp)' (35). The hero is indeed advancing to meet Nausicaa, but his sexual appetite is, at this point, the least of his concerns. For Odysseus, of all people, the yaarTp means food: cf. Od. 7.216ff., 15.344, 17.462. The comparison of the hunter taking the cubs of the lioness (II. 18.318ff.), is explained as: 'the simile insists upon the theme of illegal ownership' (87), in order to produce a thematic link; but no reader takes that to be the point. Priam imagines the terrible fate of his daughters and himself at the fall of Troy: it is surely over-interpretation, and of a chilling sort, when L. tells us that' Rape [is] here a metaphor for vulnerability' (98), and - with a brutal bathos - that 'The last detail of Priam's feverish vision describes the dogs defiling his grey head and beard and ripping apart his genitals - a symbolic quenching of his power' (97). Nor does Priam, actually, say quite that, speaking rather of dogs 'fouling the grey head and beard and the genitals of an old man slain' (II. 22.74-5). Readers of this book will need to be alert as well as responsive. Balliol College, Oxford J A S P E R G R I F F I N PINDAR AND FESTIVE PERFORMANCE EVELINE KRUMMEN: Pyrsos Hymnon: festliche Gegenwart und mythisch-rituelle Tradition als Voraussetzung einer Pindarinterpreta- tion (Isthmie 4, Pythie 5, Olympie 1 und 3). (Untersuchungen zur antiken Literatur und Geschichte, 35.) Pp. x + 291; 3 maps. Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 1990. DM 158. The book under review is a slightly revised dissertation completed in 1987 under the supervision of Walter Burkert. As the sub-title suggests, K.'s primary concern is to demonstrate that our understanding and appreciation of four odes are enhanced when proper attention is paid to the festive occasion of their performance, to 'die institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen und die mythisch-rituellen Voraussetzungen ("Erwartung") des Publikums'. The first part might seem to be a return to the historical approach now so loudly decried, but it should be obvious that Pindar would have been aware of the circumstances of an ode's performance before he began to compose and that it would be surprising if those circumstances had no effect on his choice of language. This is especially significant when an ode was intended for performance at a state festival, since the more detailed our knowledge of the festival itself, including the topography and architecture involved, the better our under- standing of the ode. K.'s second aim, to uncover 'die mythische oder rituelle Grundstruktur einer Erzahlung' and to evaluate ' ihren Bekanntheitsgrad' in the fifth century, is equally important, although in my opinion the amount and nature of the evidence at our disposal result in a greater degree of subjectivity and hypothesizing. Justification for the general approach she has taken and criticism of other approaches are given in a 30-page introduction where she admits that she is most in sympathy with the views expressed by Italian scholars, especially those associated with Urbino. The first ode she treats is I. 4 and she begins with a detailed examination of the last ? Oxford University Press 1991</page></plain_text>
