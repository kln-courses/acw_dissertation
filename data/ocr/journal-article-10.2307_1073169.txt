<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTARY ON "ON THE NATURE OF BANKRUPTCY": BANKRUPTCY, PRIORITY, AND ECONOMICS Mark J. Roe* L AW and economics bankruptcy scholars might once have thought that deviations in bankruptcy from absolute priority are anticontractarian results that are inefficient in terms of aggregate wealth-maximization. These deviations could be seen only as distributional rules or mistakes. Dean Jack- son and Professor Scott's "On the Nature of Bankruptcy: An Essay on Bankruptcy Sharing and the Creditors' Bargain" will change that view. Jackson and Scott argue that some enterprise risks are "common disas- ter," exogenous risks that creditors, managers, and shareholders cannot pre- vent or mitigate. In contrast, endogenous risks are under the control of a party to the firm or are risks for which one of the parties can best reduce the consequential losses. If common disaster, exogenous risks could be specified ex ante, they would be shared among the parties to reduce the cost of later strategic action. But ex ante contracts cannot readily specify the exogenous risks that should be shared, and even if specification were possible, creditors cannot coordinate their sharing. So mandated bankruptcy sharing is justi- fied as the sharing contract to which the parties would have agreed were agreement not so costly to coordinate. They conclude with examples reflec- tive of the model and with the admonition that because ex post sorting is often too complex to make the common disaster scenario operational, some instances of current bankruptcy sharing should be reversed. I shall argue here that even if financial parties could effectively choose to share common disaster risks, there is good reason to believe that exogenous risks would not be shared. Finance theory suggests that informational asym- metries and signaling considerations would lead insiders to bear a dispropor- tionate level of the exogenous risks. Because we can imagine how explicit contracts could, in fact, be used to share common disaster risks, those pro- posing mandated sharing ought to show convincingly why contract fails and why the costs of mandated risk sharing justify that rule. Jackson and Scott offer existing examples of bankruptcy sharing as consis- tent with the common disaster heuristic. But the examples they cite do not reveal the exogenous/endogenous distinction that is crucial to their central model. The sharing in those cases results not from common disaster, exoge- *Visiting Professor, Columbia Law School. 219</page><page sequence="2">220 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 nous risks, but from creditor misfeasance, which is an endogenous action. Other examples of sharing also seem at odds with the contractarian frame- work that Jackson and Scott posit. Although these examples can be modi- fied into contractarian terms, alteration renders them inconsistent with the basic common disaster model. The authors point out that their model is difficult to implement. For this reason, they might ask whether rules differ- ent from those now prevailing would better resolve the conflicts that they correctly identify. I. EXOGENOUS RISKS VS. ENDOGENOUS RISKS: THE ONLY RELEVANT DISTINCTION? Dean Jackson and Professor Scott provide us with a vivid image: the cap- tain of an imperiled ship must decide whether to jettison cargo, to cut off the mast, or to jettison the ship's supplies. If losses fall where incurred and are not shared, the captain would be expected to foster his own interest instead of maximizing the savings of the group. Admiralty's rule of general average reduces the captain's perverse incentive to jettison another participant's cargo when it is cheaper in the aggregate to jettison the ship's supplies. Bankruptcy's priority system recreates the imperiled ship scenario. Devi- ations from the priority system for exogenous risks are analogous to admi- ralty's rule of general average. The parties could do nothing to avoid the calamity or to mitigate its effects. The costs of bargaining to the value-maxi- mizing solution are high due to priority. Accordingly, the theoretical justifi- cation for respecting priority in a bankruptcy caused by exogenous factors evaporates. 1 Strategic creditor action, they argue, justifies bankruptcy's sharing rules. Another justification is available-debtor moral hazard: if the owner of a closely held firm fears that his equity interest will be reduced to zero, he has an incentive to abandon the enterprise or to take unwarranted risks to create some possibility of a payback. In other words, an insolvent debtor wants to expand the same probability distribution that a secured creditor wants to collapse. By giving the entrepreneurial debtor an interest in the ongoing I The parallel between admiralty and bankruptcy has to be drawn out. A captain is presumably in full control of his ship's operations; a secured creditor of a foundering financial entity normally has substantial influence. The conflict between secured creditors and others creates the prospect of bargaining costs and unfortunate operational results. For example, a secured creditor will prefer to collapse probability distributions and assure its own return, even if the expected value of the firm would diminish. In a world without transaction costs, presumably secured creditors and other parties would rebargain to an efficient result. See Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J.L. &amp; Econ. 1, 15 (1960). But Jackson and Scott assert that, in the real world, imperiled firms cannot effectuate these Coasian rebargains well.</page><page sequence="3">1989] Commentary 221 enterprise, sharing rules mute his incentive to gamble with, or to abandon, the enterprise. A "common risk" is defined as any contingency whose probabilities or effects cannot be influenced by the actions of individual parties. This defini- tion leads to a dichotomy: risks that can be controlled by parties are borne by them; risks that cannot be individually controlled can be and often are shared. But this definition gives too wide an influence to bankruptcy sharing rules. It excludes a large middle involving disagreement, mistrust, and lack of information. These explanatory variables-asymmetric information and belief-are fundamental in financial economics literature. Creditors may not want to share risks because their assessment of the firm's investments differs from that of its stockholders or, more importantly, because the costs of ascertain- ing the full range and probability of potential outcomes is too high.2 This can be illustrated: imagine a manufacturer seeking financing when it has found a good prospect. If he seeks equity financing, the endogenous risks are low, we assume, because the entrepreneur can run the factory. But, uncer- tain of the expected value of or variance in demand for the product, the prospective financier would like to investigate before deciding whether to invest through stock (full sharing), a hybrid convertible or debt with options (partial sharing), or straight debt (no sharing). In addition, the financier may not completely trust the veracity of an operator who seeks sharing; an operator with a really good prospect would borrow the necessary funds and would not let the financier in as his partner. Sharing would sometimes require more investigation, and sometimes more subsequent monitoring, than straight priority debt. When investigation is expensive, priority debt facilitates efficient deals. When the lenders ask what can be given as hostage, the insiders offer full priority in the event of failure.3 In effect, the entrepreneur is saying, "If the 2 See Campbell &amp; Krakaw, Information Production, Market Signalling and the Theory of Financial Intermediation, 35 J.

Econ. 277, 277-80 (1978). 3 In today's bankruptcy system, the fullest priority of the creditor over the entrepreneur is obtained through security interests. But it need not be-if the rules governing unsecured debt gave unsecured creditors priority without any sharing with the entrepreneur. Although the idea that security facilitates signaling or screening financial transactions has been criticized, the signaling or informational nature of debt itself (as a signal from the entrepreneur to the financier) has not been persuasively disproved. See Schwartz, Security</page><page sequence="4">222 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 project is not worth enough to pay you in full, I'll give you the machinery, inventory, and factory." Jackson and Scott's sharing paradigm could destroy this worthwhile bar- gain: in order to facilitate other relational benefits, the bargain cannot take place in full in the sharing model. The insiders are prohibited from effec- tively promising the creditors everything in the event of a bankruptcy. Thus, the signaling and informational advantages of debt are undermined by the sharing rule, and the hostage taking essential to some of these deals is incomplete.4 Notwithstanding Jackson and Scott's interesting model, the financier and the entrepreneur may not wish to share exogenous risks if sharing requires the creditor to investigate more carefully the sensitivity of the enterprise to those risks. In some instances, worthwhile deals might collapse if a sharing rule is anticipated.' But these are deals contractarians should want to go through. II. WHY NOT SHARING BY CONTRACT? The common disaster story is consistent with bankruptcy sharing. But, as the authors would surely agree, before bankruptcy sharing is imposed, one ought to have more than a plausible story of why debtors and creditors might want to share risks. Why did the parties fail to share by contract? The authors reject the ability to share by contract, but we should press on beyond that ipse dixit.6 Interests and Bankruptcy Priorities: A Review of Current Theories, 10 J. Legal Stud. 1 (1981); Scott, A Relational Theory of Secured Financing, 86 Colum. L. Rev. 901, 906-08 &amp; nn.21-23 (1986). 4 Obviously, signaling is sometimes not essential, and the only effect of bankruptcy sharing, if the sharing is really significant and anticipated, will be a change in the price of the loan. Furthermore, when a signal is useful, its utility is in the information it conveys from the entrepreneur or other insiders to prospective creditors outside the firm. When the priority is of one creditor over another (e.g., a secured creditor over an unsecured creditor), signaling is less important because those losing their position are not usually inside the firm. To reflect this difference, sharing rules should be bifurcated: sharing between the entrepreneur and his creditors and sharing among creditors. 5 The cost of forgone deals due to this informational effect undermines Jackson and Scott's conclusion that "if default or insolvency could be causally linked to a common disaster, a pro rata sharing rule would be the optimal arrangement." Even if linked to a common disaster, there are strong arguments for bankruptcy rules respecting priority. 6 The consideration and rejection of the possibility of sharing through explicit ex ante contract occurs in a handful of sentences in the Jackson and Scott article: "While contract terms such as adjustable interest rates can compensate secured creditors ex post for some of these risks, the rates are likely to be adjusted too little, too late"; "Risk-sharing agreements, however, are costly to negotiate ex ante because the parties must settle vexing distributional questions." Although Jackson and Scott expressly consider why creditors might adopt the</page><page sequence="5">1989] Commentary 223 This inquiry divides into three parts: (1) the problem of specification; (2) the problem of creditor and debtor coordination; and (3) the comparative advantages of various bankruptcy rules in resolving problems of specification and coordination. A closely parallel division is this: (1) If there was one creditor, could the exogenous risks be specified and shared between debtor and creditor by contract? (2) Could several creditors coordinate their actions if they wanted to share risks among themselves? And, (3) even if they could not coordinate, is there a better default rule than that of the cur- rent regime? A. Specification Could exogenous risks be specified ex ante in the contract? True, many exogenous risks are unforeseeable or too difficult to delineate; they are risks, as Jackson and Scott state, of "business failure owing to complex and inter- active contingencies (such as the effects of the stock market collapse on sup- ply and demand conditions in a particular industry)."7 But many of these risks, although difficult to specify in advance, will manifest themselves as declines in industry price or increases in industry cost. These exogenous risks could plausibly be specified by contract; if they arise the parties would share.8 The mechanism for sharing under a background rule of full priority is easy enough to imagine: the contract could provide for no interest in the event of a reorganization. Or the creditor of a public firm would take equity characteristics by taking convertible bonds or bonds with warrants attached. Or the contract could require that under specified circumstances the creditor would be compensated in the debtor's stock. To tie the sharing to exogenous risks, the contract could trigger the shar- ing (no interest, payment in stock, or forced conversion to equity) if demand in the industry falls to this level of production or price. Oil company credi- tors, for example, could tie shared-risk compensation to changes in the price of oil, aggregate domestic demand, or the level of United States imports.9 sharing rule ex ante, they ought to tell us in convincing detail why creditors cannot accomplish this objective themselves, without an imposed bankruptcy sharing rule. 7 In addition, they say the "creditors' bargain ... involves long-term relationships in which many of the contingencies that influence business prospects are uncertain and highly interactive." 8 Coordination by ex ante contract is a different problem. See infra notes 10-13 and accompanying text. 9 Other contractual mechanisms might be used that do not specify the measure for the exogenous risk. For example, contracts often relieve a party of its obligation if there is an intervening "act of God." If in the sharing model courts can make the common disaster/ endogenous risk distinction, then presumably the parties could delineate common disaster risks generally by contract (e.g., by stating: "no interest will be due if an act of God</page><page sequence="6">224 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 B. Collective Action 1. Large Public Firms and Financial Creditors Collective action problems impede the use of a sharing clause. The credi- tor agreeing to such a clause will often want to be sure that the firm's other creditors do the same but may not be able to force that agreement. This is a rationale for collectivization by legal rule. But before we force collectiviza- tion we should question why the collective result is not even attempted by contract. If it is never attempted, maybe that is because it is not wanted. Let me give an example. Many public firms do not use security in their credit instruments because they think it is just an expensive shifting of risk. 10 But a financial creditor that does not want security for itself also wants to be sure that no one else comes ahead of him in bankruptcy. Accordingly, the creditor insists that the debtor not secure its assets to anyone else without equally and ratably securing the creditor seeking protection. Some debtors have this type of negative pledge clause in all of their principal debt agreements. Similarly, one could imagine contractual sharing rules stating that a credi- tor is obliged to forgo interest if industry-wide prices dip below a specified level, but the obligation would depend on a minimum percentage of the debtor's other creditors also agreeing. True, contractual specification will not be as transactionally efficient as a mandated rule, if that is what the parties really want. But at least some firms ought to be able to negotiate to this rule if they really want it. If no one ever negotiates to this contractual provision, then we have two inconsistent explanatory hypotheses. A tran- sactionally costly negotiation is one hypothesis, but this hypothesis is weak- ened by the existence of very similar arrangements pursuant to widespread use of negative pledge clauses. A spurned sharing of risks because the result is itself undesirable (perhaps because of the signaling considerations dis- cussed earlier) is the competing hypothesis. If creditors are not sharing by contract when they can, then a creditor- indifference or creditor-hostility hypothesis arises to compete with the costly-coordination hypothesis: sharing might be unimportant or costly. I Which hypothesis-costly-contracting or creditor-indifference-can bear more weight is not deductively apparent. intervenes"). Outside of bankruptcy an arbitrator expert in the facts of the industry could settle disputes as to whether the risk was truly an act of God; inside bankruptcy the judge might displace the arbitrator. 10 See Modigliani &amp; Miller, The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment, 48 Am. Econ. Rev. 261 (1958); Schwartz, supra note 3, at 4-9; Scott, Bankruptcy, Secured Debt, and Optimal Capital Structure, 32 J. Fin. 1 (1977). 11 That is, costly other than in the transactional sense.</page><page sequence="7">1989] Commentary 225 Moreover, as is discussed below,'2 coordination costs among financial creditors are not a big issue in the common disaster heuristic because that model posits a single dominant secured creditor that effectively runs the financial credit side of the debtor's business. Coordination costs are accord- ingly simpler for the model's prototypical firms. 2. Small Firms and Trade Creditors I believe that although coordination is plausible among the financial credi- tors of a large public firm-because the costs of contract arrangement and policing are small in relation to the size of the loans-the cost of coordina- tion among the nonfinancial creditors of smaller firms is larger. For the small firm, coordination costs could justify Jackson and Scott's mandated sharing story. The sharing thesis takes on special strength in the context of creditors who do not bargain-tort claimants-or those for whom bargaining is very costly-small trade creditors. These creditors, the argument would run, cannot require secured creditors to take characteristics of an equity holder. The plausibility of contract solving the sharing problem-as the negative pledge does in analogous circumstances for the large firm-diminishes. Secured or priority creditors want to collapse probability distributions in a way that could damage these nonbargain creditors. But let me offer two critiques in the next two Sections, one weak and one strong. The first is that Jackson and Scott's prototypical capital structure would actuallyfacilitate sharing exogenous risks between financial creditors and trade creditors by contract (compared to other types of capital struc- tures). The second is that if the risks cannot be coordinated by contract, the current set of bankruptcy rules is a relatively poor way to impose the sharing. 3. A Single Dominant Creditor Facilitates the Sharing Bargain The Jackson and Scott model firm has a dominant secured creditor that provides most of the firm's financial capital. The general collective action problems for that kind of firm may be in some ways easier to resolve than those of larger firms that nevertheless sometimes succeed through negative pledge clauses. When the population of financial creditors is small (as it is for their model firm), coordination is relatively easier. True, trade creditors typically do not have the financial sophistication to bargain, and if they do have sophistication, they lack the time to do so for relatively small shipments. For these reasons, though the efficient rule might 12 See infra note 13 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="8">226 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 be for the secured creditor to share exogenous risks with the trade creditors, they cannot get the contract that they would obtain in a frictionless world."3 But there are intermediaries. In some industries, trade creditors make crude credit decisions based on the evaluation of a credit-rating agency. The credit-rating agency gives the supplier the bottom line: credit is recom- mended, recommended up to a specified limit, or not recommended. Pre- sumably, if the sharing rule were really important, the debtor would attach the sharing clause to the financial statements it forwards to credit agencies. These superior sharing terms would then find their way into superior credit recommendations. Since the sharing model is designed to deal with the overreaching of a dominant secured lender that provides most or all of the nontrade credit to the firm, communication of crucial terms should be fairly easy. I do not argue that the contractual frictions noted above would neces- sarily be easy to overcome. I do argue that they are at least worthy of investigation. C. More Efficient Default Rules A more serious difficulty faces the assertion that the trade (and similar tort, consumer, and nonbargain) creditors cannot coordinate and bargain. How much have we shown if we demonstrate that a sharing rule is consis- tent with efficiency? We used to think that priority was consistent with effi- ciency-maybe it still is. Jackson and Scott's sharing theory now shows us that sharing is consistent with efficiency. The importance of that showing should not be underestimated. Are we now to think, as we must, that prior- ity, sharing, and all hybrids are consistent with efficiency? Isn't the next task, the tougher task, to go beyond the existence theorem and to show how one set of rules is superior to another set of rules? 13 Actually, the trade creditors might want the dominant secured creditor to share endogenous risks of managerial mistake or theft as well as exogenous, common disaster risks. A current academically popular explanation for secured debt is that it facilitates monitoring and relational advantages. See, e.g., Jackson &amp; Kronman, Secured Financing and Priorities Among Creditors, 88 Yale L.J. 1143, 1152-53 (arguing that the existence of collateral reduces monitoring costs); Levmore, Monitors and Freeriders in Commercial and Corporate Settings, 92 Yale L.J. 49 (1982) (offering monitoring explanations for secured debt); Scott, supra note 3, at 903-04 (describing the relational advantages of secured debt). But see Schwartz, The Continuing Puzzle of Secured Debt, 37 Vand. L. Rev. 1051, 1055-59 (1984) (arguing that monitoring explanations for secured debt are incomplete). If the secured creditor fails to monitor or if the relationship fails to produce a profitable firm, then perhaps the contractual result in a frictionless world would have been that the dominant, relational, monitoring creditor would not come first; that is, that the secured creditor would share the loss created by these endogenous risks. This potential result presents a problem for the sharing model's exogenous/endogenous distinction, but I will not pursue it here.</page><page sequence="9">1989] Commentary 227 Could the relational explanation be buttressed by explaining why alterna- tive legal rules are not better? Why wouldn't priority in reorganization for trade creditors or tort claimants be better than the hybrid results we now have?"4 A rule of priority for nonbargain creditors seems efficient. True, trade creditor priority might be worse (from the nondistributional perspec- tive of maximizing firm value) in that the secured party would then have an incentive to expand probability distributions by avoiding or prolonging the bankruptcy in hope of an upturn in the firm's fortunes."5 Or why not have a rule that prohibits secured creditors from seizing secur- ity to the ratable disadvantage of nonbargain creditors, such as trade credi- tors with credits of less than a specified amount, products liability tort claimants, and consumer claimants? Under this rule, the secured creditor would "share" with these nonbargain creditors, but would retain priority over the other financial and bargain creditors. This result parallels that of typical subordination arrangements in public firms."6 It also is consistent with efficiency. Although this rule may have some defects, it does seem to be a plausible first response to the problem of strategic action by the dominant secured creditor. Such a rule might be superior to the current sharing hybrids for another reason. The current rules have a ratchet-like effect. Once imposed, the par- ties cannot reverse them even if they can overcome the bargaining and coordi- nation costs. For example, interest does not accrue on many claims in bankruptcy, even if the parties want it to accrue. The advantage of a base- line sharing rule with an opt-out, assuming that the strategic action problem is important and cannot be defeated other than by sharing, is that it allows a dominant secured creditor and trade creditors to get full priority if they want it and if they are able to overcome the transaction cost barriers. 17 14 See Schwartz, supra note 3, at 34. 15 Perhaps this conflict between secured parties and trade creditors could be controlled, if really important, by contract. Would the two interests be collapsed into a single creditor, who in effect would buy up the trade creditor's debt by financing it when the trade creditor ships to the firm? When the trade debt is inferior in right at the time of a bankruptcy, the incentive to combine the two claims is weak. But if the trade creditor were the senior creditor, the incentives might be different. 16 Public firms tend not to use secured debt. See McDaniel, Are Negative Pledge Clauses in Public Debt Issues Obsolete?, 38 Bus. Law. 867 (1983). The subordination arrangements have trade and nonfinancial creditors "outside" of the intercreditor priority rearrangement. The outsiders "share" with the financial creditors, who reallocate priorities among themselves. See American Bar Foundation, Commentaries on Model Debenture Indenture Provisions 560-61 (1971) [hereinafter ABF Commentaries]. 17 Such a result does not seem impossible. Trade creditors could be given a subordination form on the debtor's order for the goods. They would check off their agreement to the dominant creditor's priority. Assuming adequate cognition on the part of trade creditors, the sharing rule could be appropriately reversed contractually. (To be sure, if the secured creditor</page><page sequence="10">228 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 The point of this discussion is that sharing by contract is possible under current rules and even more plausible under alternative rules. Those attempting to justify mandated sharing ought to show why contract mecha- nisms or other baseline rules are inadequate to the task. It would be helpful to the sharing theory to show some substantial contractual efforts (even if incomplete) that were motivated by sharing and strategic concerns. The negative pledge clause might be a start. Identifying a possible contractual breakdown in the current legal framework is insufficient in itself to justify jumping to a mandatory rule; one has to know why contract fails and why an alternative baseline, nonmandatory rule could not do better. If creditors are not contractually making the common disaster/endoge- nous risk distinction that Jackson and Scott posit to be important, there are several competing explanatory hypotheses to consider: (1) the distinction is unimportant; (2) the distinction, although important, is overshadowed by more important considerations like informational signaling; or (3) the rele- vant parties cannot get together to make the distinction by contract. Because it is not yet obvious that the first two hypotheses must be excluded, the common disaster/endogenous risk distinction may have more of an uphill climb to overcome than we first might think. And if the answer turns out to be that coordination costs are too high, another set of baseline rules may well be better than mandated sharing. lends thinking it has priority, it would want to police the forms to assure itself of priority. If policing is expensive compared to its advantages, then priority opt-out becomes mythical.) Recently, Professor Scott offered an important relational theory of secured credit. He argued that, due to freeriding considerations, the financial creditors of small businesses would underprovide financial and business advice, unless a single secured creditor dominated the financial structure. See Scott, supra note 3, at 916-18. Presumably, a relational creditor would insist on enhanced nonbankruptcy compensation if it risks diminishment of its priority in bankruptcy. But an important part of the relational framework is that (1) the financial creditor be able to exclude from the firm a subsequentfinancial creditor, unless the subsequent one is willing to take over the entire loan, and (2) the dominant financial creditor be able to shut down the enterprise in response to debtor mistake or misbehavior: Security as now constituted in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Bankruptcy Code provides these two functions; but it also does more, often of a distributional nature. Security excludes from the secured assets (1) trade and other nonbargain creditors as well as (2) subsequent financial creditors unless they take over the whole debt. Mechanisms that serve the relational function (excluding type (2) creditors) without also implementing the distributional result (excluding type (1) creditors) are imaginable.</page><page sequence="11">1989] Commentary 229 III. Do EXISTING EXAMPLES OF SHARING REFLECT THE EXOGENOUS/ ENDOGENOUS RISK DISTINCTION? Dean Jackson and Professor Scott next argue that many of the existing sharing rules in bankruptcy are consistent with their exogenous/endogenous risk-sharing framework. Let us question that assertion. A. Feeding the Lien and the Trustee's Strong Arm Power Feeding the lien is the first example they give of self-interested inefficient behavior that a sharing rule will deter. Feeding the lien problems arise when a dominant secured creditor forces the firm to be run so that a greater por- tion of the firm's assets are turned into security; for example, a creditor with a security interest in the firm's accounts receivable forces. the firm to sell inventory, which is turned into a secured account, even though another action would be better for the firm as a whole. But feeding the lien problems can (and I am sure do) arise irrespective of the source of the risks. A dominant secured creditor will have an equal incentive to feed the lien whether the firm's inadequacies are caused by man- ager error (endogenous risk) or an by unexpected, freak fire that destroys the factory (exogenous risk). Similarly, the strong arm power does not seem precisely responsive to the exogenous/endogenous risk distinction. The strong arm power allows the bankruptcy trustee to set aside some security interests, allowing all creditors to share in the asset."8 But misfeasance by the creditor, not exogenous risk, creates the sharing implemented by the strong arm power.19 Lien-feeding and the strong arm power might better be seen as a legal response to the self-interested or sloppy behavior of the secured creditor, not to exogenous declines in product demand. They are problems that cannot yet be analyzed within Jackson and Scott's exogenous/endogenous relational framework.20 18 See 11 U.S.C. ? 544 (1982 &amp; Supp. IV 1986). 19 As Jackson and Scott note, ? 544(a) puts the unperfected secured creditor on the same level as the unsecured creditor. Thus, when a secured creditor does not file a financing statement, it forfeits its right to a premium return in bankruptcy because it has failed to "disclose key information important to the collective interests of all creditors." Again, whether sharing is justified or not is not at issue. The question is whether the sharing is justified by an endogenous, common disaster risk. And here the strong arm power seems responsive to something other than common disaster risks. 20 Adjustment of the model, however, might bring these examples within its ambit.</page><page sequence="12">230 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 B. Reorganization Under Chapter 11 Reorganization under Chapter 11 is characterized by a broad-based shar- ing of risks. How well does it comport with the contractarian framework? 1. Idiosyncratic Value and the Common Disaster Is risk sharing the central reason for value shifts during small firm reor- ganization or is the idiosyncratic value invested in the enterprise by its indi- vidual owners the primary justification? The two concepts are different. Exogenous risk sharing is justified as a means of reducing perverse incentives to collapse or expand probability distributions or to engage in self-interested maneuvers. But idiosyncratic value justifies disregard for full priority because the owner-manager of a closely held firm frequently has a utility function that the market cannot compensate. "Idiosyncratic value" is an economist's term for distributional considerations. It does not fit well with the distinction between exogenous and endogenous risks that is central to Jackson and Scott's thesis.21 2. Moral Hazard and Implied Contract Moreover, I am unconvinced that the moral hazard explanation for the failure of contract that Jackson and Scott first proposed in the paper presented at the conference justifies intervention into the contractual frame- work of debtor-creditor relations. Because Jackson and Scott are working from within the contractarian paradigm, they must face the question of why the entrepreneur with idiosyncratic value does not get his creditors to share some of the risk ex ante. For example, the entrepreneur can obtain their agreement to forgo interest in some foreseeable circumstances. They argue, for example, that idiosyncratic value should lead the entrepreneur to seek third-party insurance against a decline in value of the firm. Such insurance, however, would lead to the risk that the insured will be sloppy with her property once someone else bears the financial burden of its loss. Presuma- bly, this moral hazard is so great that the insured cannot pay for the insur- ance out of expected idiosyncratic losses. In other words, contract fails.22 21 Indeed, at the conference at which Jackson and Scott discussed their article, one of the authors referred to idiosyncratic value as an additional basis for risk sharing. If so viewed, the distinction I make in this textual paragraph is irrelevant. Nevertheless, when viewed as an additional basis for sharing, the idiosyncratic value argument might be inconsistent with the common disaster heuristic. See infra notes 23-29 and accompanying text. 22 Since moral hazard risks are under the control of the debtor, the moral hazard scenario is different from the common disaster scenario that is central to Jackson and Scott's thesis. That is, sharing that is mandated by moral hazard is sharing of endogenous risks, whereas sharing due to admiralty's common disaster heuristic is sharing of exogenous risks. If the parties could specify a common disaster risk, the debtor is not faced with a moral hazard problem because,</page><page sequence="13">1989] Commentary 231 There is room for bankruptcy to imply and create the failed contract. If these moral hazard costs are embedded in third-party insurance, then they must be embedded in the two-party insurance that Jackson and Scott propose as well. The moral hazard does not disappear simply because the morally hazardous term is written into the contract by bankruptcy law rather than through contract negotiation. The debtor would be subject to the same moral hazard, the same propensity to be sloppy in the management of the business, whatever the source of the insurance. Thus, the parties would not want to preserve idiosyncratic value even if, as Jackson and Scott argued, moral hazard keeps the entrepreneur from insuring her idiosyncratic value. Moral hazard destroys the ex ante sharing contract and suggests that contractarians such as Jackson and Scott consequently ought not to want to imply sharing into reorganization. 3. Adverse Selection I do think that the distributional considerations that underlie idiosyn- cratic value in closely held firms might theoretically justify, as an existence theorem, a risk-sharing redistributional result on contractarian terms.23 The owner with her name on the door gets special value from running her own firm. She makes specific investment of human capital, is precluded from alternative actions if the business goes bad (because after years in the business she cannot do anything else as skillfully), and often cannot readily diversify the financial, idiosyncratic, and human capital she has invested in the firm. Thus, she would want financial creditors (who can diversify their investments and who lack idiosyncratic risks) to accept some of the enter- prise risks.24 Again the contractarian question arises: Why can she not con- by definition, the debtor cannot affect outcomes caused by exogenous risks. The authors have added a new justification for risk-sharing, as one of the authors suggested at the conference. Idiosyncratic value is lost when the closely held firm fails, irrespective of whether the failure is due to endogenous mistake or exogenous common disaster. Presumably moral hazard explains why the entrepreneur cannot insure against endogenous risks. But why can't she insure against exogenous risks? The answer might be that the authors believe, as I do, that endogenous risks are difficult in practice to sort out from exogenous risks. Even the model for the common disaster heuristic- a storm that endangers a ship-is properly classified as an endogenous risk if the ship's peril is due to the captain's failure to examine carefully the appropriate weather reports or to maintain the ship well enough to endure stormy seas. 23 Because creditors can anticipate the potential for redistribution and can calculate this cost into the terms of their loans (or can refuse to make some of the borderline loans), the distributional effects of mandated sharing on a portfolio-wide basis would be muted in a world without transaction costs. 24 Actually the owner would want her financial creditors to absorb losses due to mismanagement as well as those caused by exogenous risks. Presumably, moral hazard</page><page sequence="14">232 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 tract for insurance with her creditors, specifying, for example, that upon declines in cash flow or industry price levels of a specified amount interest will be reduced or forgiven? Perhaps one deductive contractarian justification for mandated risk shar- ing due to idiosyncratic value is not moral hazard, which will exist no matter who writes the insurance, but is embedded in the signaling information con- tained in debt.25 In other words, the problem might be one of adverse selec- tion. Beginning there, Jackson and Scott could argue, again as an existence theorem, that adverse selection would be cured by a mandated result. If, at the time of loan, the owner has the best estimate (or if prospective creditors fear she may have the best estimate) of the firm's value, creditors may hesitate as soon as she asks for the insurance. Although she is willing to pay for the insurance, the very request for the insurance changes the cred- itors' estimate of the value of the loan.26 For her to get the loan at all (or to get it with actuarially fair insurance terms), she must be prohibited from signaling the quality of the project by her acceptance of contingent destruc- tion of her position. With the signal prohibited, the argument runs, she can obtain insurance because the creditor will not be able to use full priority as a signal of creditor quality.27 considerations dictate that such a contract could rarely be made and should not be implied into the bankruptcy system. The entrepreneur may not know that she will regret her earlier decision to give her firm to its creditors (if allowed to make such a contract) when the firm later fails. Accordingly she might not buy insurance. Sen, Rational Fools: A Critique of the Behavioral Foundations of Economic Theory, 6 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 317, 322 n.9 (1977). She may also be overly optimistic in assessing the firm's chances of success. I would not be surprised to learn that, as a group, small business entrepreneurs are systematically overly optimistic. Regret, cognitive error, and similar psychological and economic considerations seem fruitful bases for inquiry as justifications for a mandated muting of priority in Chapter 11 for small businesses in a manner similar to the normative justifications for the nonwaivability of an individual's right to discharge in bankruptcy. These have been discussed by others, including an astute and comprehensive article by Dean Jackson. Jackson, The Fresh Start Policy in Bankruptcy Law, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1393, 1405-07 (1985); see also Kronman, Paternalism and the Law of Contracts, 92 Yale L.J. 763, 785-86 (1983) (discussing similar contract abrogation problems). These justifications, however, are irrelevant to the current discussion because Jackson and Scott are reconciling sharing rules not with fresh start cognitive theory but with a contract framework: "We put aside financial 'fresh start' notions that often are preeminently relevant for individuals... This policy ... has no relevance (except sometimes rhetorically) for corporate debtors." 25 See supra 3-4 and accompanying text. 26 See Akerlof, The Market for "Lemons": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism, 84 Q.J. Econ. 488 (1970); Stiglitz &amp; Weiss, supra note 2. 27 This argument is similar to that made in favor of mandated medical insurance for certain risky groups. See Akerlof, supra note 26, at 493 n. 1; Arrow, Higher Education as a Filter, 2 J.</page><page sequence="15">1989] Commentary 233 Whether this adverse selection story really justifies mandated sharing is another question. The parties must be able to turn to a substitute form of signaling (an oil engineer's report, for example) that does not have severe idiosyncratic value costs. If the substitute is almost as good a signal, even though it would not be used if priority to the firm could be offered as a better and cheaper signal, mandated sharing would be wealth-maximizing and con- sistent with a contractarian framework. Of course, if the substitutes are poor, requiring risk sharing would be wealth-decreasing and violative of the implicit contract framework. But at least adverse selection allows us to tell a contractarian story about risk sharing due to idiosyncratic value. In addition, there are many firms whose owners do not need to share risks, but who would be forced to do so under a mandated sharing rule unless a screening device were constructed. This forced risk sharing will in turn pro- duce the moral hazard costs discussed above.28 In sum, the contract story is as follows: if most firms are subject to the adverse selection problem, if their owners have significant idiosyncratic investment or are risk averse, and if the next-best selection mechanism is almost as good as priority, then forced risk sharing at some level would be justified by implicit contract. But to tell this adverse selection story would contradict the common dis- aster heuristic. Once we admit adverse selection into the model (to justify sharing of idiosyncratic risks), we must of course recognize that some firms may actually have no idiosyncratic value problems and may need to give full priority in order to signal the value of their projects and the insensitivity of their expected cash flow to exogenous risks. Thus, when adverse selection is fully considered, the common disaster model involves a much more compli- cated tradeoff between the loss of idiosyncratic value and the desire for effec- tive signals.29 Pub. Econ. 193, 199 (1973); Arrow, Uncertainty and Medical Care, 53 Am. Econ. Rev. 941 (1963). 28 Professor Cooter pointed out at the conference that the contractarian story might be told without reference to idiosyncratic value if we assume that entrepreneurs have private information that leads to financiers being reluctant to share risks with them. But the risk- averse entrepreneur with this information would still want to share risks. Forced sharing eliminates the adverse selection problem, but at a cost to the signaling function of debt. 29 One might view Chapter 11 as an indecisive oscillation between priority to support financing and sharing to give vent to idiosyncratic value in the event of bankruptcy. If our purpose here is to find, as existence theorems, implicit contracts that might justify sharing rules, then here is one: the firm's suppliers, customers, and employees could be seen as quasi- creditors. The suppliers, customers, and employees make investments of capital (human and otherwise) that are specific to the ongoing relationship with the bankrupt firm. See 0. Williamson, The Economic Institutions of Capitalism: Firms, Markets, Relational Contracting 248 (1985); Goetz &amp; Scott, Principles of Relational Contracts, 67 Va. L. Rev. 1089 (1981).

Interest Accruals: Noise and Filigree Interest does not always accrue in bankruptcy. Secured creditors usually obtain interest only if they are oversecured; unsecured creditors do not ordi- narily obtain interest at all.30 Those with an economics background might at first criticize the nonac- crual rule. Given the time value of money, if interest does not accrue assets might not be deployed effectively because the equity holder or a junior credi- tor will have an incentive to delay the proceedings.3' In a Coasian world without transaction costs this would have no ex ante distributional effect. Anticipating nonaccrual, as at least institutional creditors must, the creditor would not lose anything on a portfolio-wide basis. Interest rates would rise for the firms at risk. Nor would the assets in bankruptcy be deployed improperly when interest did not accrue; the parties would bargain swiftly and effectively to the efficient result.32 But there are allocational costs in real-world bankruptcy cases. Uncer- tainty as to the distributional effect of the nonaccrual rule, due to uncer- tainty as to how long the bankruptcy will last and differing internal time values for the delay that cannot be communicated convincingly, increases the time needed for settlement. Law and economics analysis prior to Jackson and Scott's entry doubted the wisdom of nonaccrual rules. The law might not have been consistent with the rules suggested by economic analysis, but the economic prescription seemed clear.33 Jackson and Scott may just be suggesting that efficient risk sharing is the best justification for these bankruptcy anomalies. Could happenstance, insti- tutional lags, misconception, and mistake be better historical explanations of the rules than relational efficiency? Jackson and Scott have not claimed that risk sharing was the original reason for adopting these rules, saying only that risk sharing is the best normative justification for their existence. As such they might not at all disagree that to get a richer understanding of the bank- ruptcy process we may have to examine noncontractarian paradigms. An efficiency explanation alone puts too fine a filigree on phenomena too crude to hold the detail. firm, sharing rules give these quasi-creditors a higher return on their implicit contracts with the bankrupt firm. 30 11 U.S.C. ?? 502(b)(2), 506 (1982 &amp; Supp. IV 1986). 31 Baird &amp; Jackson, Corporate Reorganizations and the Treatment of Diverse Ownership Interests: A Comment on Adequate Protection of Secured Creditors in Bankruptcy, 51 U. Chi. L. Rev. 97 (1984). 32 In a Coasian world the cost would lie in those loans that do not occur because the full priority contract is not permitted. 33 See Baird &amp; Jackson, supra note 31.</page><page sequence="17">1989] Commentary 235 Other analysts have explained the nonaccrual rules differently from Jack- son and Scott. Some contend that they developed because, in a world of small business bankruptcies, judges thought it more trouble than it was worth to determine the various interest accruals. But because there was so little to distribute, and because most of the accruals would mean only slight adjustments in each creditor's return, courts did not bother with these calcu- lations.34 In today's world of instant adjustments on Lotus spreadsheets and personal computers, it is hard to believe that such a task once seemed too difficult to bother, but so it once was. Thereafter, the nonaccrual rules became disembodied from their adminis- trative justification and took on a life of their own.35 Like painters in a hurry, these judges might just have missed a spot.36 If our goal is to explain the nonaccrual rules historically as opposed to finding a mental construct that is consistent with its results, then we may have to consider nonrational explanations as well. Religious precepts once militated against interest.37 Like persistent medieval rules against usury that had a religious or quasi-religious origin, the interest accrual rules may have persisted into modem times even though they might not have arisen in a modern commercial economy were they not already there. Secular analogues to this religious view exist. A persistent strain in Amer- ican culture favors the underdog, hesitates to kick someone when he is down (even when he "has it coming to him"), and worships the comeback. Or perhaps the nonaccrual rules can be seen as coming from the same cultural sentiments that lead us to put a dark sack on the head of the execu- tioner, or to give. one soldier in the firing squad a blank bullet so as to allow each of the squad's members an opportunity to believe he did not kill the prisoner. Not to give interest might indeed violate contract, express and implied, but the social structure may be unwilling to enforce the obligation 34 Fortgang &amp; King, The 1978 Code: Some Wrong Policy Decisions, 56 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1148, 1149 (1981). 35 See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. ? 502(b)(2) (Supp. IV 1986). 36 A bankruptcy scholar told me this story about present value. While teaching a simulation in a reorganization seminar, one of the participants came in with a renegotiation that skirted all the significant bankruptcy issues but that "won" the renegotiation for his client. He succeeded in getting all the other parties to agree to substantial stretch-outs (without interest) of the amounts due. The winner had convinced the creditors that they would be repaid everything they were owed, but with some delay. The professor told me that thereafter he would conduct the simulation only after teaching the students about present value. Is it possible that some of the bankruptcy judges who originally came up with the nonaccrual rules decades ago never had that lesson? 37 E.g., Leviticus 25:35-38 ("And if thy brother grow poor, and his means fail ... though he be a stranger . . . [t]ake thou no usury of him, or increase[] Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy foodstuffs for increase.") (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="18">236 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 and execute the debtor.38 Moreover, once the rules were in place they may have persisted because the ideology continued to have some adherents, because they served admin- istrative needs, or because at least until recently, they did not really matter in economic terms. Many legal rules are analogous to noise: random motion that does little economic damage and little economic good.39 They happen and persist because, like people, institutions are subject to Herbert Simon's bounded rationality.' We cannot focus on enough, so rules persist if they do not significantly harm the economy or those with influence. A closer examination of the nonaccrual rule serves to illustrate this point. If untutored in the ways of bankruptcy, one might think the rule straightfor- ward-either the creditor gets interest or he does not. Jackson and Scott suggest that, to the extent he does not, relational, captain-of-the-ship, gen- eral average sharing could be the reason. But the rules are very intricate- taken together they defy classification and economic explanation. They have all the precision of a Jackson Pollack randomized splashing of paint. They are oscillations, I suspect, between contrary tendencies. First, interest accrues in liquidation against the debtor. But it does not accrue among unsecured creditors until all receive payment of their princi- pal.4" And then it accrues at the "legal rate," a term whose meaning has been subject to some controversy-is it the contract rate, judgment rate, or market rate?42 Second, for secured creditors, interest accrues only if there is excess secur- ity.43 If there is no excess, it does not accrue.44 Third, as a general rule, interest does not accrue to unsecured creditors in 38 Indeed the remarkable survival of the Ahlers' farm in the Alhers family-until the case reached the Supreme Court-is consistent with this reluctant executioner image. See Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 108 S. Ct. 963 (1988). 39 I am speaking of aggregate wealth-maximization now, not counting the dispersed utility of letting someone off the hook so that we can be nice fellows, assuming that such a dispersed utility can be said to exist. 40 See J. March &amp; H. Simon, Organizations (1958); H. Simon, Models of Man: Social and Rational (1957); cf. R. Nelson &amp; S.

The Bankruptcy Code provides that they should get no less than what they would receive in a liquidation, which as we have already noted provides that creditors should get interest before stockholders are paid.46 Fourth, the rules for interpreting an agreement that subordinates a bond's principal to the senior creditor's interest payment need to be parsed.47 This is financially important: these are the clauses that are in the junk bonds that will be the subject of the next round of bankruptcies. If the agreement were interpreted literally, the senior creditor would get interest out of the bond's principal payments (if any) in the bankruptcy. Nevertheless, some courts say that a subordination provision is enforceable only if the agreement speci- fies postpetition interest.48 Finally, what about reinstatement? Under the Bankruptcy Code, a debt may be reinstated according to its terms.49 If the debt is reinstated the inter- est payments missed during the reorganization proceeding must be paid.50 But what if the interest payments are offered at the end of the proceeding, without payment for the delay (i.e., without interest on interest)? If the case is in the Southern District of New York, there is some question whether the interest on the delayed payment is due. New York law prohibits the pay- ment of interest on interest; this prohibition was incorporated-perhaps incorrectly-into the Bankruptcy Code's reinstatement provisions.5' Are these distinctions sensible? Do they comport with the relational the- ory? Indeed, do they comport with any theory? Jackson and Scott were originally quite explicit that their goal was to make the "incoherent cohere"; they are striving to make sense of an apparently incoherent system. That is a worthy task, but perhaps the incoherent is at base just that-incoherent and internally inconsistent. I suspect that interest accrual rules, as they now exist, cannot readily be brought within a grand theory based on a single explanatory rationale. 45 11 U.S.C. ? 502(b) (Supp. IV 1986). 46 See 11 U.S.C. ? 1129(a)(7) (1982 &amp; Supp. IV 1986). 47 See ABF Commentaries, supra note 16, at 561. 48 In re King Resources, Inc., 528 F.2d 789 (10th Cir. 1976); In re Kingsboro Mortgage Corp., 514 F.2d 400 (2d Cir. 1975); In re Times Sales Fin.

The Common Disaster Analogy The analogy to admiralty's law of general average for the common disas- ter, upon which Jackson and Scott rely heavily, is vivid. But is it always apt? The rule is of ancient origin, according to the authoritative commentary on admiralty.52 Whether it really has any import on how ships are managed when facing a common disaster in today's commercial world is much harder to envision than examination of the rule in itself might suggest. Neither shipowner, captain, nor cargo-owners bear the immediate ex post cost of any common peril: "virtually all marine insurance policies . . . insure in full against general average losses, so that a general average adjustment in the end is almost invariably [except for a few cargo owners acting as self-insur- ers] a distributing of loss among insurance companies."53 Perhaps for these reasons, the law of general average is intermittently viewed as anachronistic, useless, and costly. Some critics have suggested abolishing the rule.54 But even if the common disaster scenario of loss sharing at sea is not real today, its value as a heuristic is undiminished. B. Another Heuristic: The Regulators and the Bankers When reading their article a metaphor occurred to me about the muting of priority in bankruptcy. One can see bankruptcy's muting the priority rules as a game between the bankruptcy authorities on the one hand and debtors and creditors on the other. The game is similar to the rules that Charles Kindleberger discussed and recommended to govern the relationship between financial regulatory officials and the regulated." The regulatory officials must tell the regulated that the regulators will never intervene to save failing financial institutions, even if exogenous risks threaten the financial fabric, and especially if managerial mishap threatens a particular institution. But when the disaster strikes, the institutions must be saved, because failure threatens to rip the financial fabric. But then when saved, rational expectations will change in the future. So financial regulators warrant that there was something special about this intervention, that it will never happen again. (But when it does happen again, they intervene.) Could business bankruptcy results be seen similarly? Could the regula- tory paradigm sketch a more active, anthropomorphic role to the state in the bankruptcy contest than does the Jackson and Scott's passive contractarian 52 G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, The Law of Admiralty 244 (1975). 53 Id. at 250. 54 Id. at 270-71. ss See C. Kindleberger, Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (1980).</page><page sequence="21">1989] Commentary 239 paradigm? Priority is necessary to support a business credit system. It is crucial to sorting out good credits from bad. But when bankruptcy strikes the recapitalization costs are great and those costs would be diminished by muting priority. So priority is muted ex post. To dampen rational expecta- tions in the next round outside of bankruptcy, the rules are made sufficiently complex that nonexperts do not fully grasp them and mistakenly believe that priority means priority. I do not for one moment think that the system was consciously so designed or that it survived in its present form because it had such beneficial features. But it is a nice story. And I suspect the view that bankruptcy inconsistencies reflect an oscillation between contrary tendencies has some weight to it. CONCLUSION The heuristic suggested by Dean Jackson and Professor Scott works. They have set out to show an existence theorem, and they have shown it. Parties might want to share common disaster risks, and contract might fail to allocate these risks. To complete their argument Jackson and Scott might want to press on to ask: Why does contract fail to do the same crude job that judicially-man- dated sharing rules provide? Why do not many of the exogenous risks reduce themselves into declines in industry demand or increases in cost? If they can be so reduced, exogenous risks could sometimes be specified in terms of benchmark prices of industry output or input. Furthermore, if sharing rules based on such benchmarks do not appear, why don't they? Adverse selection cost is one alternative hypothesis to Jackson and Scott's coordination-cost explanation. Unimportance of sharing is another. And if coordination costs are the answer, as Jackson and Scott suggest, then we might ask whether alternative judicial rules-such as a default baseline rule of priority or equality for nonbargain creditors that could be modified by contract-would accomplish the sharing norm more effectively. It is not necessarily so that exogenous risks would be shared even if they could be specified and even if the creditors could overcome the problems of creditor coordination. The parties might decline to share exogenous risks because of the investigation and signaling costs sharing would entail. If that is so, mandated sharing cannot be readily reconciled with a contractarian framework. Mandated sharing operates like a ratchet that the parties cannot reverse if they prefer not to share risks. Again, an alternative suggests itself for investigation: a baseline rule of equality of trade and tort claimants with secured parties (on the assumption that equality would be the norm if the parties could contract costlessly) that could be altered by contract to a full priority rule.</page><page sequence="22">240 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 75:219 The bankruptcy institutions offered as examples of bankruptcy sharing of exogenous risks are less convincing than they first seem. Lien-feeding problems and the strong-arm example are responsive to perceived creditor misfeasance, not to common risk problems. Similarly, idiosyncratic value in small business reorganization can justify sharing, but the justification is not based on the relational exogenous/endog- enous risk distinction suggested by Jackson and Scott. Nor can sharing readily be justified as an implicit contract that would arise were it not for the "defect" of moral hazard. Moral hazard defeats the implicit contract as eas- ily as it defeats the explicit contract. Next, if our task is to explain why bankruptcy's sharing rules have devel- oped, should we rest upon the conclusion that the distinctions Jackson and Scott draw are the most normatively satisfying or should we press on to find the real reasons for adoption of these rules? It may be that administrative justifications, deep-seated moral aversions to interest, or sentiments that favor giving losers another chance were the real reasons for the original adoption of these sharing rules. It is also possible that society wants a collec- tive proceeding for bankruptcy but that the polity cannot ascribe the charac- ter of executioner to the bankruptcy system. The death of the enterprise must-if possible-take place off-stage. The bankruptcy system can do most of the credit collection work, but the coup de grace must be administered by the economy as the business is absorbed (or closes) after the proceeding. Some sharing rules that soften the blow to the debtor may be just what they seem to be: a contest between judicial forgiveness for those who have lost financially and the desire of critics to see a more efficient, wealth-maxi- mizing system. Sometimes forgiveness wins. The contest between forgive- ness and contractarian efficiency cannot be resolved without one view dominating the other in a specific case; precedent and accident have forgive- ness winning in some cases and claims enforcement winning in others. The results may well be inconsistent and irresolvable.</page></plain_text>
