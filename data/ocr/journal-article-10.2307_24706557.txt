<plain_text><page sequence="1"></page><page sequence="2">3°3 Rubens Meets Brouwer Confrontations with Low-Life Genre Painting Karolien De Clippel Arnold Houbraken narrates in his Groote Schouburgh (1718) how Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) visited the imprisoned Duke of Arenberg in the Antwerp Castle and, at the same time, had an encounter with Adriaen Brouwer (1605/06-1638). He added that shortly before, Brouwer had fin ished a painting figuring card playing Spanish soldiers, made at the Duke's request as proof of his capacity. Upon seeing it he [Rubens, who never saw Brouwer before] said at once, stunned with amazement: Upon my soul [...], it is by BROUWER, and immediately offered the Duke 600 guilders for it, but he wanted to keep this picture for his own enjoyment, and in remembrance of this event. RUBBENS, who could not tolerate that such an outstanding painter was being treated so badly, first went to the Governor, whom he informed that an artful painter, come from Holland, had been detained by soldiers and imprisoned simply under the suspicion that he was a spy; that they had seized him under wrongful suspicion, that his Highness could rest assured that he had not come to Antwerp with this intention: but only to practise his Art, and because of this could be given his freedom, which the Governor granted on RUBBENS' word. So he was let out of the prison, and was happy about his liberation. RUBBENS took him along to his House, had a suit of clothes made for him right away, and brought him along amongst virtuous company, of temperate lifestyle, showing thereby that he had great respect for him.1 Allegedly, Rubens was filled with such an enthusiasm that he was not only prepared to pay a handsome 600 guilders on the spot for the picture, but also obtained Brouwers freedom and even provided him with lodging. However punctuated with anecdotal frills, literary topoi and contaminated facts, this extract contains an underlying statement that deserves a closer look. The point of Houbraken's anecdote lies in illustrating Brouwers bril liant gift for painting, which not only enabled him to extricate himself from a difficult situation,2 but also earned him instant recognition from the chief connoisseurs and artists of the day, such as Rubens. This fascination dis played by an aristocratic artist who was the most distinguished practitioner of the genus grave (history painting) with a so-called wandering, debt-laden</page><page sequence="3">3°4 Karolien De Clippel rake who depicted rude low-life scenes, might at first seem surprising. This contribution then wishes to ascertain the degree of truthfulness and signifi cance of Houbraken's words and to gauge to which extent Rubens was con cerned with Brouwer. What are possible points of attraction between two artists seemingly so different? And does Rubens' oeuvre reveal influences of his fellow genre painter? Rubens and Brouwer: the Facts Even though it was never as popular as it was in the Dutch Republic, genre painting in the Southern Netherlands could boast a well-established tradi tion in Rubens' time. Most importantly, the Flemings could be proud of counting the father of the genre as one of their natives. Indeed, it was Pieter Bruegel the Elder (ca. 1525-1569) who raised peasant imagery into a subject worthy of being painted, and as such laid the foundations for a well-defined artistic specialism. Furthermore, during the 1620s, it was once again an artist of Flemish origin who tackled the genre with such originality that he revolutionized the Bruegelian tradition and, in doing so, played a seminal role in the development of the peasant genre during the seventeenth cen tury. His name is Adriaen Brouwer. Although Brouwers favorite protagonist remained invariably the uncivilized boer (peasant),3 his work stands out through his invention and incorporation of new subjects such as the latest fashion of smoking. Fully appreciating Brouwers art also means recognizing his virtuoso painting technique. His superiority is achieved through his well-prepared panels, the thin, watercolor-like preparatory sketching of the composition, the translucency of his loosely applied paint layers, the rich nuances of his palette and the confident handling of light and shade.4 And last but not least, Brouwer was particularly innovative in redefining the Bruegelian iconography. The former's moralizing didacticism was tran scended, and his interpretation of "peasant" imagery reached a more univer sal level, thanks to an unprecedented and lively imitation of nature.5 His inventions evoked, just as Bruegel's, an enormous response. He made school in the north with painters such as Cornells Saftleven (1607-1681) and Adri aen Van Ostade (1610-1685), as well as in the south, with David II Teniers (1610-1690), Joos van Craesbeeck (1605/06-ca. 1660) and David III Ryckaert (1612-1661). Even more, his influence surpassed the boundaries of genre painting and he managed to appeal to the leading artist of the time, Peter Paul Rubens. Crucial and most tangible evidence in this respect is to be found in the archives and consists mainly of two records. A stay of Brouwer at Rubens' house or a fortuitous meeting of both artists in the Antwerp citadel may not be documented; nevertheless, there is evidence that the two met each other face to face at least once. On March 4, 1632, almost immediately after his arrival in Antwerp, Brouwer is asked by Daniel Deegbroot, captain of the civil guard and member of the Violieren chamber of rhetoric, to testify about the authenticity of a painting representing a Peasant Dance (fig. 1) in Rubens' collection (appendix i).6 This notarial deed not only provides docu mentary evidence about an encounter between both artists, but at the same time reveals Rubens' involvement with Brouwer. On this occasion, Rubens</page><page sequence="4">Rubens meets Brouwer 305 declared that the painting came into his possession about a year before, which implies that in all probability, he acquired it before knowing Brouwer personally and when the latter was still in Holland.7 Most likely, his supplier was the above-mentioned Daniel Deegbroot, who, now that Brouwer had arrived in Antwerp, wanted him to confirm in the presence of Rubens that he himself had invented the subject of the painting and had executed it only once. In light of the references found to Brouwer in Erik Duverger's pub lished Antwerp inventories and in the commercial correspondence pub lished by Jean Denucé,8 this fact underscores the assumption that Rubens was one of the first and few lucky owners of a Brouwer painting in Antwerp, together with Jacomo de Cachiopin for whom Brouwer submitted the same day a statement of authenticity.9 Moreover, Rubens valued Brouwers work highly, since he made him sketch the outline of the painting on the overleaf as proof that he was the owner of an autographic and unique work.10 Besides, he would never part from this painting, which in all probability forms the first of a whole series of Brouwer pictures that Rubens would col lect during the 1630s.11 Indeed, Rubens' admiration for the recently arrived artist further materialized in his acquisition of autograph paintings, as determined on the basis of the Specification - the list made in 1640 to advertise the sale of works of art from Rubens' estate, now known only from an eighteenth-century French paraphrase of the lost Dutch original.12 This document shows that at the end of his life, Rubens possessed an astonishing ensemble of genre paint ings. Pieter Bruegel the Elder was exceptionally well represented with twelve original pictures. But ultimately it was his living heir Brouwer who beat the lot with a presence of no less than seventeen original paintings (appendix 2).15 No other painter in the collection, not even Titian, came close to such a huge representation. About half of the seventeen paintings have been linked to existing pic I Matthijs van den Bergh alter Adriaen Brouwer, Peasant Dance, 1659, drawing, 211 χ 215 mm, Berlin, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett.</page><page sequence="5">306 Karolien De Clippel 2, Adriaen Brouwer, Two Boors Fighting by a Barrel, c. 1633, oil on panel, 15,5 χ 14 cm, Munich, Bayerische Staatsgemalde sammlungen, Alte Pinakothek. tures.14 First of all, there is the earlier mentioned Peasant Dance in a Land scape (app. 2, no. 283), which Brouwer made at the very beginning of his Antwerp period or even earlier. The painting is not known, but the compo sition is possibly recorded in the drawing by Matthijs van den Bergh (1615 1687) dated 1659 and inscribed 'Adriaen Brauwer Harlemiensis', and today in the Berlin Kupferstichkabinett (fig. i).IS Rather exceptional by its outdoor setting, with a very Bruegelian composition and theme, this picture is still in keeping with Brouwer s Dutch work such as the Fight over Cards (Maurits huis, The Hague). Secondly, the 'combat d'yvrognes, 0111'un tire l'autre par les cheueux' (app. 2, no. 272) was identified with the Two Boors Fighting by a Barrel (fig. 2) and the 'combat de trois, oil vn frappe auec le pot' (app. 2) with the Two Boors Fighting over Dice (fig. 13).16 Not identified, but undoubtedly in the same vein is the 'combat 011 vn est prins par la gorge' (app. 2, no. 277). All of them feature an aggressive fight caused by an over dose of stimulants whether or not stirred up by the heat of the gambling game. Most other scenes show people enjoying leisure time, mainly while drinking and smoking in taverns such as the 'paysan auec vn verre de vin &amp; un pot',17 'vne tauerne oü l'on est assis aupres du feu' (app. 2, no. 273) and 'quelques vns qui prennent du tabac' (app. 2, no. 285). Another important</page><page sequence="6">Rubens meets Brouwer 307 contemporary form of recreation often depicted by Brouwer is music mak ing, and more in particular the performance by the lowlifes of vulgar songs associated with disorder, immorality and alcohol abuse.18 Rubens' collection counts three examples of it: 'vne musique des paysans' (app. 2, no. 275), Vne musique des paysans aupres du feu' (app. 2, no. 281), perhaps corresponding to the Peasant Quartet in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich (fig. 3),19 and finally 'vn joëur de luth' (app. 2, no. 282), maybe identical to the Lute Player now in the Victoria and Albert Museum (fig. 4).20 To this category of figural paintings can be added another two, namely the 'paysan jaloux' (app. 2, no. 276), probably one of those virtuous, very expressive half-length representa tions personifying Envy comparable to the Youth Making a Face (National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Bitter Draught (Stadelsches Kunstinsti tut, Frankfurt am Main),11 and finally the paysans qui regardent par la fenestre' (app. 2, no. 287) of which we can surmise nothing. Another pictorial category practiced by Brouwer, and one in which Rubens seemed particularly interested, is landscape. Four paintings were in his possession in which, judging from the description, the landscape-ele ment dominated (app. 2, nos. 274, 278, 286, 288) and at least one where it 3 Adriaen Brouwer, Peasant Quartet, c. 1636, oil on panel, 43 χ 57,5 cm, Munich, Bayerische Staatsgemalde sammlungen, Alte Pinakothek.</page><page sequence="7">3o8 Karolien De Clippel 4 Adriaen Brouwer, Lute Player, c. 1635-37, oil on panel, 37 χ 29,2 cm, London, Victoria and Albert Museum took an important part of the image surface (app. 2, no. 283). Only the 'paysage a la lune' (app. 2, no. 288) has been linked to an existing picture, the very atmospheric Dune Landscape by Moonlight in Berlin (fig. 5)." Finally, rather isolated in its sort is the 'Tentation de S. Anthoine' (app. 2, no. 280), the kind of Boschian diablerie of which one can get an idea through a paint ing from Brouwers circle in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (fig. 6).23 Difficult as it remains to identify with certainty the individual pic tures, the descriptions by themselves are enough to conclude that virtually all themes covering Brouwers oeuvre from his Antwerp period were repre sented: taverns or lowly hovels with drinkers, fighters and smokers,24 peas ants dancing and making music,25 expressive 'tronies'26, landscapes,27 and spooky devilries or bizarreries.28 Since only about sixty-five autographic works by Brouwer have come down to us, it is clear that Rubens was one of the largest contemporary consumers of his art. What motivated Rubens to surround himself with such a huge number of small-scale Brouwer paint</page><page sequence="8">Rubens meets Brouwer 309 ings? Archival documents indicate that Brouwer was beset by debts at least during the first years he spent in Antwerp, and that he used paintings as col lateral to obtain loans. Hans Vlieghe was probably right in suggesting that he possibly made a similar arrangement with Rubens, which would explain the comparatively large number of seventeen works in the latter s estate.29 By consequence, it is very plausible that Rubens purchased those paintings directly from Brouwer and therefore, we may presume that they all date from Brouwers Antwerp period, between ca. 1632 and 1638, with the excep tion of the Peasant Dance in a Landscape (fig. 1). Magnanimity and philan thropy can certainly have been stimulating forces, but, in my view, do not suffice to explain the impressive number of Brouwer paintings owned by Rubens. On various occasions, Jeffrey Muller has convincingly argued that Rubens' collection was an emanation of his humanist views on art. Priority was given to art that either appears to prefigure Rubens' own ideas or s Circle of Adriaen Brouwer, Temptation of St Anthony, oil on panel, 27.2 χ 21 cm, Berlin, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie.</page><page sequence="9">3IO Karolien De Clippel 6 Adriaen Brouwer, Dune Landscape by Moonlight, c. 1633-37, oil on panel, 25 χ 34 cm, Berlin, Staatliche Museen, Gemaldegalerie. belonged to a corpus of great inspirational models from the past.3° Central in Rubens' art theory is the idea that the purpose of painting is the imitation of nature." Accordingly, it is conceivable that an artist who was considered to contribute to this purpose and thus marked the advancement of painting, was welcomed in his collection. Nowadays Brouwers seminal role in the development of genre painting is taken for granted, but his significance within the broader painterly panorama might be less obvious for us than it was for Rubens and his contemporaries. Capturing the Soul of Nature Landscape may take a modest place in Rubens' oeuvre, yet he kept close track of its developments, and his particular interest in this pictorial cate gory is reflected in the composition of his collection.32 In this context, it is significant that almost one third of the Brouwer pictures described in the Specification feature landscape elements (app. 2). The only identified one, the Dune Landscape by Moonlight in Berlin (fig. 6), was probably one of the first moonlit scenes in the Southern Netherlands. It is a thinly painted, but very strong image of a dune landscape ending in the sea and semi-lit by the reflection of the full moon above it. Its strength is the mood, which is</page><page sequence="10">Rubens meets Brouwer 311 mainly obtained through the virtuoso light effects on the water surface and the ridges. The mysterious atmosphere typical of twilight is, moreover, heightened by the presence of the crouching, sinister-looking man in the middle foreground and the trio to the left of him who have put their heads together conspiratorially. At first sight, it might seem somewhat odd that Rubens' selection from the oeuvre of a low-life genre painter contains so many landscapes, since peasant imagery - it is assumed - constitutes the very core of genre painting. But in fact, it isn't. According to sixteenth- and seventeenth-cen tury artistic creeds, low-life genre painting as initiated by Pieter Bruegel the Elder owes its substance to its distinctive combination of form and content. Undeniably, the peasant subject forms the principal part of the thematic repertory, but, apart from profane themes, religious, antique, and mytho logical subjects are important constituents of it as well.33 A crucial dimen sion of this pictorial category was the working 'nae't leven' or the imitation of nature, a feature which was chiefly achieved through, on the one hand, the successful rendering of character and emotions and, on the other hand, of landscape.34 In this aspect Bruegel excelled and, as a result he was labeled 'the most perfect painter of his century' by his friend Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598).35 At the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was still this 7 Peter Paul Rubens, Landscape with Moon and Stars, c. 1637-38, oil on panel, 64 χ 90 cm, London, Courtauid Institute Galleries, Princess Gate Collection.</page><page sequence="11">312 Karolien De Clippel quality that won him the highest praise. Karel van Mander proclaimed him in his Den Grondt der edel vry schilderconst (1604) the epitome of natural painting, expert at Boschian 'spoockerijen' (phantasms) and 'drollen' (drol leries) and as the consummate Netherlandish landscapist and, for those rea sons, a model worthy of being imitated by every painter.36 Therefore it doesn't come as a surprise that Bruegel's works, style and motives were end lessly multiplied, emulated, and collected far into the seventeenth century, also by Rubens.37 Probably half of the paintings attributed to Bruegel in his possession represent a landscape.38 Interesting in this context is Bruegel's 'paysage auec feu', a fire scene that should have been appreciated by Rubens for similar reasons as Brouwers earlier mentioned Dune Landscape by Moonlight (fig. 6) and his 'paysage auec vn esclair', also in Rubens' collec tion.39 Concretely, these paintings are all conspicuous for their 'tenebroso' effects and the way in which natural phenomena and mood are evoked through light.40 In fact, Brouwer not only emulated Bruegel but went even further in developing the latter's realizations towards greater naturalism. Brouwer intensified the atmosphere by showing landscape as a unique snapshot, as part of a nature in permanent movement where light and darkness, rain and sunshine, heat and cold alternate and where the staffage figures perfectly reflect the suggested atmosphere in their pose, gestures, and facial expres sion. His depictions of the land possess an atmospheric and impressionistic naturalism that endow them with a profoundly modern appearance absent from portrayals of the subject by his predecessors. No wonder that Rubens, who not only kept up with the latest trends in landscape painting, but, moreover, produced the majority of his own landscapes in the 1630s, turned his keen eye towards the innovative landscapes of Bruegel's successor, Brouwer. Illustrative is his own Landscape with Moon and Stars (fig. 7), of which the resemblance with Brouwers Dune Landscape by Moonlight (fig. 6) has often been pointed out in the past.41 Motives and themes might be dif ferent, but in spirit and technique the late landscapes produced by both Rubens and Brouwer are very similar indeed. Furthermore, I have the impression that the similarity between Brouwers technique in his late landscapes and that of Rubens' preparatory sketches or so-called studies for his late landscapes is even stronger than in his finished paintings. I think here more in particular of The Landscape with a wagon at sunset (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam), The Landscape after a Storm (Courtauld Institute of Art, London) and, not by chance, the tiny Willows (fig. 8),42 a picture which measures 18,5 χ 33,3 cm and therefore, fits in perfectly with Brouwers common format. This sparkling sketch is painted thinly and, in analogy to Brouwers usual tech nique, the brown priming of the panel can be seen through the paint layer. Brouwers paintings and Rubens' sketches show the same loose, dotty brush work, similar blending of colours, and the same alternation of thin and bold passages due to the combination of sketchy colour application and accuracy in details. Rubens as well as Brouwer found in nature their most important muse, whose depths they probed with a sensitive glance. Both regarded landscape as a player with human qualities, as animated substance with a</page><page sequence="12">Rubens meets Brouwer 313 great emotional power of expression.43 To translate its vital character and physiological phenomena into rocks, trees, water, air, light, and color was their main purpose. Being both figure painters, they were very skilled in achieving this goal and, in doing so, found each other. Capturing the Soul of Men Indeed, in heart and soul Rubens and Brouwer remained figure painters. Brouwers focus as reflected in the works by his hand collected by Rubens is undeniably on the peasant as the churlish man, an unpleasant figure who might just as well live in the city. The recurrent theme is human misbehav ior as defined by the spiritual and worldly authorities and illustrated by, on the one hand, almost universally recognized sins and, on the other, more fleeting phenomena such as contemporary leisure activities functioning as trenchant illustrations of uncivilized conduct. But the uniqueness of this entire group of works lies not so much in its iconography as in its combina tion of technical mastery with an astonishing attention to true to life expres sion. This is what we can derive from a description of a fighting scene by Brouwer in Arnould Houbraken's Groote Schouburg. He [Brouwer] painted a fight between Farmers and Soldiers, arising (so it seems) out of a card game, of which the cards were strewn every where on the ground. Here one strikes the other on the head with a beer tankard, there another lies felled to the ground, with the pallor of death already set in, but who still seems to want to avenge himself with his foil, which he tries to remove from its sheath during the struggle. 8 Peter Paul Rubens, Willowsy c. 1636, oil on panel, 18,5 χ 33,3 cm, private collection.</page><page sequence="13">314 Karolien De Clippel 9 Philips Galle after Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Death of the Virgin, 1574, engraving, 306 χ 418 mm, Mr. and Mrs. Julian I. Edison. On the other side I see one rising from his chair in total range, with his knife in his fist, as if he would force his way among the champions. In the distance one sees someone descending the stairs in all haste with a pair of tongs in his hand, etc. Everything was depicted so naturally according to the kind of passions in the facial features, and painted so wonderfully confident and free that it could serve as an example of his Art.44 What is interesting about this passage is not only that it describes one of Brouwer s favorite themes, but also that Houbraken is particularly moved by the brilliant representation of human affects conveying brutality and aggres siveness. If Rubens selected Brouwers genre paintings for his collection and not those of his Flemish colleagues or followers such as David II Teniers, David III Ryckaert and Joos van Craesbeeck, then this has everything to do with this remarkable quality. As no other Flemish contemporary besides Rubens, Brouwer succeeded in disclosing the human condition and pas sions by means of actions, gestures, and facial expressions.45 His great predilection for coarse fighting scenes even makes it likely that he applied himself to find subjects which allowed him to indulge in the artistic depic tion of emotionally extreme physiognomies and gesticulating bodies.46 Brouwers interest in human nature and emotions did not appear out of the blue, but found its origin in the idiosyncrasy of the genre he practices and continues the accomplishments of its founding father and his great example Pieter Bruegel the Elder.47 Illustrative of this is the Death of the Vir gin, the famous grisaille commissioned by Ortelius in 1564-1565, which he asked Philips Galle (1537-1612) to copy in copper in 1574, the same year he wrote his eulogy on Breugel that was distributed to his friends (fig. 9).48 After Ortelius' death, the grisaille went to Isabella Brant and eventually ended up in Rubens' collection. It is noteworthy that Rubens also retouched a drawn copy after the painting.49 What deserves our attention is the</page><page sequence="14">Rubens meets Brouwer 315 inscription on the engraving, almost certainly by Ortelius himself, praising the artist for his depiction of mixed sorrow and joy on the faces of the Apos tles.50 The same artistic qualities of the grisaille were admired by the human ist writer and engraver Dirck Volckertsz. Coornhert (i 522-1590) in a letter to Ortelius dated July 15, 1578s'. Moreover, in the sixth chapter of the Grondt der edel vry schilderconst devoted to the depiction of the affects, Karel van Mander praises Bruegel together with the classical painter Aristides of Thebes.52 To illustrate Bruegels mastery in this respect he refers to his Mas sacre of the Innocents, in which 'is to be seen a mother, the color of death, oppressed by weakness, as well as a grieving family, pleading with the herald for the life of a child; in whom [i.e. the herald] can be sufficiently discerned sympathy for the villagers but also the painful resolution to proclaim the royal decree that allows charity to no one'.53 Through the depiction of mixed emotions (severity and compassion), he surpasses an Italian example invoked by Van Mander, Charon in Michelangelo's Last Judgement, whose eyes are expressive of only one affect (rage). In doing so, Van Mander under lined that Netherlandish artists surpassed the Italians in their mastery of human affects.54 I am inclined to believe that this frequently eulogized and apt render ing of changing emotional states as well as permanent characteristics such as social status was what Rubens admired most in this painting, in Bruegels art, and in genre painting in general. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that five of the twelve Bruegel paintings in Rubens' collection were 'tronies' or 'heads and busts of mostly anonymous, fictive and literary fig ures' (fig. 10).55 In addition, early in his career he made a partial copy of Bruegels Massacre, representing exactly the scene of the interaction between the herald and the distressed family (fig. 11).56 It is very likely that it is the ΙΟ Lucas Vorsterman? after Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Man Yauming., ca. 1621, engraving, 209 χ 207 mm, Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kupferstichkabinett.

This was Bruegel's last painting, left unfinished at his death, and to which Rubens had probably access before 1625 when it was in the possession of Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625). Of the many versions of this composition, some have been associated with Rubens such as the engraving by Lucas Vorsterman (fig. 12), though none has been con vincingly identified as a copy by him.57 The painting stands out for its expressive frenzy of movement in the bodies and faces. Rubens being an outstanding painter of violence in the making,'8 Bruegel's scene might have appealed to him for more or less the same reasons as the later fighting scenes by Brouwer (see infra), as a model for his depiction of violent conflict and the concomitant emotions on the faces of the fighters.59 Brouwers fighting scenes should be seen in line with Bruegel's, but when comparing them, Brouwers rendering of coarse action seems more pronounced through unseen expressive gestures and theatrical mimicry. Moreover, he appears to be more successful in creating a unity of action by, on the one hand, reducing the number of figures and attributes and, on the other, gearing their respective movements and facial expressions unambigu ously to one principal affect, in this case anger. In the method of choosing one principal passion as guideline, Brouwer is in keeping with Paolo Lomazzo's art theory.60 Compared to Rubens,61 it's probably too far-fetched to think that Brouwer consciously dealt with physiognomic and expression theories. But it seems plausible that his exceptional works result from his outstanding powers of observation and a talent for painting naturally, com bined with a rising interest in the affects and their representation. In his Conversations (1677) the art theorist Roger de Piles reported that Rubens compiled in his quasi entirely lost Pocketboek a rich stock of draw</page><page sequence="16">Rubens meets Brouwer 317 ings representing separate motifs grouped by emotional content.61 It is pos sible that he regarded the works of Bruegel and Brouwer - 'physiognomists' and affect painters par excellence - as similar illustrations of chief affects, from which he borrowed extensively. A comparison between Brouwer s Two Boors fighting over Dice (fig. 13) and Rubens' Hercules crushing Discord (fig. 14), a ceiling painting for the Whitehall Banqueting House finished in 1635, corroborates this hypothe sis.63 Though completely different in choice of theme and motifs, both paintings show a violent scene. In both cases anger or wrath is the principal emotion and, the marked similarity in the representation of the physical effects is striking. This is first of all noticeable in the gestures: the assailant raises his armed hand and threatens the fear-stricken and recoiling victim. But even more obvious is the likeness in the faces. The victim shows eye brows raised in the middle, the nose and nostrils drawn up and making a fold in the cheeks; the eyes wide open and the pupil drawn to the under lid; the mouth wide open with the corners pulled back, the hair standing straight up and a rather pale complexion. The angry man from his side has a threatening facial expression, enflamed eyes, the eyebrows contracted against each other, the forehead deeply furrowed, forming wrinkles between the eyes, the nostrils open and enlarged, grinding teeth; the face pale in some places and enflamed in others, the forehead, temples and neck swollen and the hair standing upright. Moreover, this depiction of anger in the works of both artists corresponds with the powerful descriptions of anger given by Van Mander in his Grondt der edel vry schilderconst and by Seneca (5BC-65AD) in his philosophical treatise De ira (About Anger), entirely devoted to the worst of all passions.64 This classical book had great signifi cance for Rubens and the humanist circle around Justus Lipsius (1547-1606), who published it at the very beginning of his Antwerp Seneca-edition of 1615.65 In fact, Seneca's doctrine was widespread in the Southern Nether lands. It is quite conceivable that Brouwer was also familiar with it, poten tially via Rubens, and such awareness may explain Brouwers high interest in aggressive scenes.66 Brouwers skilful depiction of human conditions and passions is not only visible in his fighting scenes. It became the underlying theme and justi fication of all his late paintings made in Antwerp. Illustrative is his newly created theme of tobacco smoking illustrating joy; operation scenes visualiz ing pain; tavern scenes with drinking and music-making people expressing joy, desire and lust; individual 'tronies' depicting envy or horror. Since these scenes are not particularly flattering and even vile, one might suppose that precisely their persuasiveness made Brouwer win over his most discerning viewers, not in the least Rubens. Brouwers excellence in the rendering of nature, human conditions, and emotions, might constitute his main accomplishments, yet the mimetic strength of his images still went further. Brouwer was the perfect low-life genre painter who carried the bond between form and content of his pic tures to the extreme. And in this respect, he was unsurpassed. One of his strongest accomplishments consisted in using form metaphorically so that format, color, size, and technique became meaningful. The 'stilus humilis' of low-life genre was reflected in the format of his panels, which were</page><page sequence="17">3l8 Karolien De Clippel 13 Adriaen Brouwer, Two Boors Fighting over Dice, c. 1634-36, oil on panel, 22,5 χ ij cm, Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Gemaldegalerie Alte Meister. 14 Christopher Jegher, Hercules Crushing Discord, after July 1633, woodcut, 603 χ 358 mm.

Brouwer projected the vile nature of the scenes in the dirty coloring of his panels. The gray coloring is in perfect conformity with the grayness of things represented.68 Knowing Rubens as a great master in the use of color, even translating his ideas about this topic in a theoretical essay, his appreciation therefore is very likely.6' Furthermore, it's worth pointing out that Brouwers remarkably loose brush technique can be explained as a 'simile', reflecting the looseness of his char acters. The above-mentioned qualities in combination with Brouwers bril liant rendering of nature and 'passiones', by means of which uncivilized peo ple were characterized by unambiguous facial expressions, gestures, and clothing, should suffice to understand why Rubens eagerly collected Brouwers work and, furthermore, how Brouwer determined his views on genre and his personal artistic interventions in the field as well.</page><page sequence="18">Rubens meets Brouwer 3*9</page><page sequence="19">320 Karolien De Clippel Finger Exercises a la 'Fa^on de Brouwer' Significant for the understanding of Rubens' ideas on art and the icono graphic tradition was not only his personal art collection and his selection of models to be copied, but also his interventions in the work of predecessors. Very early in his career, Rubens started to retouch drawings and paintings by others, often by artists from previous generations. This habit has been dealt with extensively by Jeremy Wood who explained it as on the one hand, a form of 'aemulatio' resulting from Rubens' humanistic vision on art, and on the other as a practical working exercise.70 Rubens mainly reworked six teenth-century Italian works,7' but on a modest scale also touched up Flem ish peasant genre scenes. The models were not by the greatest artists, but by secondary masters working in the style of Bruegel. To the small group of retouched paintings happen to belong three genre scenes, two of which have recently come to light and been treated in more detail by Jeremy Wood and Hans Vlieghe.72 The three panels repre senting popular Netherlandish festivals - the Feast of St Martin, Twelfth Night and the Procession of the Lame men on 'Copper Monday' (the so-called Lame Bishop) - are all examples of that vivid Antwerp copying practice after crowded Bruegelian compositions in the first half of the seventeenth cen tury. Specifically, they are copies after Marten van Cleve, one of the first fol lowers of the Elder Bruegel. Those didactic manifestations of human folly are represented as panoramic, kaleidoscopic scenes of large groups of slightly silly looking stock characters with little personality and without eye expres sion, situated in an anecdotal setting full of symbolic accessories. Rubens' reworking of both the Feast of St Martin (fig. 15 cf. fig. 16) and the Twelfth Night (fig. 17 cf. fig. 18) is visible across the entire panels and as usual con sists of animating the composition. To understand fully the meaning of the retouchings, I will compare the Rubens panels with other versions of the compositions (fig. 15,17 cf. fig. 16,18). It is striking that Rubens' most fundamental changes in the Feast of St Martin (fig. 15-16) are related to the violent scene on the second plan illus trating the negative consequences of the festivities. Among other things, he lowered the hats of several figures by concealing the hair that originally cov ered their head, for example of the boy on his hand and knees and of the youngster snatching away the cap of the man in red both situated in the right part of the picture. Such deeply pulled hats are, remarkably enough, very characteristic of Brouwers imagery. Therefore, I consider it to be quite plausible that for his correction Rubens fell back on this portrayer par excel lence of the debauched (fig. 19).73 At the same time, Rubens intensified the expression of their eyes and mouth to give them the rude appearance dic tated by their negative feelings. This certainly applies to the man in red in the earlier mentioned group on the right, who is characterized as a Brouwer ian lecher by undoing his breeches (figs. 2, 20).74 Similar to the lowered hats, this distinctive feature seems to have appealed particularly to Rubens as he repeated it elsewhere. One finds the same added piquancy in another genre picture retouched by Rubens, in the drawing of drunken peasants from Vinckboons' environment (fig. 21). Equally fascinating are Rubens' changes in the face of the mother with her bawling child on the left, whose right eye</page><page sequence="20">Rubens meets Brouwer $21 was enlarged and whose pupils made moving in opposite directions to give her the appearance of a mad, unreasonable, and immoderate shrew, thus making her the perfect illustration of the negative image of women accentu ated by contemporary writers.75 While the unmannered masses are made more explicitly unmannered through gestures, facial expression, and cloth ing, the civilized city dwellers, on the contrary, are made unambiguously civilized. Illustrative therefore are the changes made to the woman with child next to the bonfire, whose original apron is substituted by a mauve silk skirt and whose cape is decorated with gold threads.76 IS Copy after Marten van Cleve, retouched by Rubens, The Feast of St Martin, 1630s, oil on panel, 76 χ io6 cm, Belgium, private collection. 16 Marten van Cleve, The Feast of St Martin, third quarter of i6'h century, oil on panel, 76,5 χ io8 cm, Dunkirk, Musée des Beaux-Arts.</page><page sequence="21">322 Karolien De Clippel 17 Copy after Marten van Cleve, retouched by Rubens, Twelfth Nighty 1630s, oil on panel, 73 χ 104 cm, private collection. ι8 Marten van Cleve, Twelfth Nighty third quarter of the 16th century, oil on panel, 79 χ 106,5 cm&gt; whereabouts unknown. Most of Rubens' corrections are dealing with the appearance of the represented characters and bring about a shift in emphasis. If the original prototype shows a rather unorganized accumulation of picturesque details and impersonal figures, the accent in the retouched version is much more on the protagonists and their body language. They have become flesh-and blood people who are characterized unambiguously as rude peasants and fine burghers, respectively. The changes in the second of three panels by the follower of Marten van Cleve, The King Drinks (fig. 17-18), are very similar and consist of individualizing the merrymakers and in underlining their</page><page sequence="22">Rubens meets Brouwer 3^3 boisterous en inhibited behavior. Here, Rubens intervened most conspicu ously in the center of the scene, giving more corpulence to the revelers, thus typifying them as excessive eaters and drinkers. Illustrative is the 'king' with his lowered cap and increased fatness, achieved through the addition of some well-chosen dark highlights on his shirt, face and neck. With his changed appearance, he can be compared to Brouwers lazy and fat drunk ards of the Dozed off Innkeeper and the Wine-tasting Innkeeper and his Wife, both in Munich.77 Most interesting is Rubens' transformation of the cen trally-placed mother with baby, where he substituted the brown jacket with a fluorescent white blouse, which he unbuttoned to reveal her breast. In doing so, he characterized her pointedly as a bad housewife who spends her time partying instead of taking up her responsibilities for her family, and who nurses her child on such bad conduct.78 Was Rubens guided in this case once again by Brouwer, who in his Peasant Quartet (fig. 3), a painting possi bly belonging to Rubens' collection, also places a brightly illuminated nurs ing woman amidst a crew of exuberantly singing men? It is generally accepted that Rubens retouched those paintings in the 19 Adriaen Brouwer, Fighting Peasants, c. 1635-37, oil on panel, 30,8 χ 25,8 cm, Munich, Staatsgemaldesammlungen, Alte Pinakothek.</page><page sequence="23">324 Karolien De Clippel</page><page sequence="24">Rubens tneets Brouwer 325 1630s,79 precisely at the moment he discovered Adriaen Brouwer. As explained before, Brouwer distinguished himself from Bruegel through making the colorful, anecdotal, and symbolic accessories subservient to the human conditions and 'affetti'. His outstanding pictorial skills permitted him to typify his characters, which are incarnations of morally condemnable traits, as extremely coarse. It is very tempting to assume that the retouched Bruegelian pictures with their sharpened boorish vitality are exercises in the Brouwerian mode and decorum. Rubens Emulating Brouwer In my view, Rubens' retouched paintings show him penetrating the style and working method of Adriaen Brouwer. They prove how thoroughly he under stood Brouwer, even better than any of his specialized followers such as Teniers. Rubens had the intelligence and technical skills to achieve such emu lation. He illustrated his mastery in the field even more concretely by making his own low-life genre painting: the Flemish Kermis in the Louvre (fig. 22). Obviously, this painting of a peasant festival draws on the achievements of 'Pier den Drol' on an iconographic level .8o In all probability, Bruegel's Peas ant Dance in Vienna served as a model for the composition. Similarly, the picture is divided into two parts, with on the left side a country house and a compact group of drinking, kissing and music-making peasants, and a sec ond group of elated dancers before a view in the distance to the right. The individual figures, however, display a vulgarity and wildness not to be found in Bruegel that reveal Rubens' familiarity with Brouwers pictorial subtleties. Among the group of drinkers sitting on the bundles of straw in the left fore ground are two nursing mothers, a motif I mentioned earlier as typically Brouwerian. In fact, they highlight the role of the parental example as the ori gin of decadent behavior, which here, moreover, is underscored by the old shrew giving a huge tankard to a child. Other motifs potentially borrowed from Brouwer are the vomiting peasant in the left hand corner just in front of the inn, conspicuously situated in the foreground of Matthijs van den Bergh's drawing after Brouwers Peasant Dance probably owned by Rubens (fig. 1), and the peasant fallen in a drunken sleep on the table, closely resembling one of the protagonists in Brouwers Smokers in the Louvre (fig. 23). It has been noted that the Kermis has a very sketchy appearance. Rubens was, of course, accustomed to working on a small-figure format in oil sketches. But those sketches served as preparatory designs for his paint ings and did not have the monumental size of the Kermis, nor were intended as finished products like it. I assume that by applying such a loose brush work and transparent layers, Rubens experimented with the decorum of Brouwer, who instilled the meaning of his pictures and more in particular, the looseness of the protagonists, with similar technical qualities. This is supported by the monumental format onto which Rubens transposed the peasant imagery. By doing so, he symbolically elevated the low subject to his own allegorical level, where the celebrating peasants become incarnations of human nature tout court and maybe,81 as happened in other scenes of rural life, idyllic characters to be associated with literary antecedents in Horace's Odes and Virgil's Georgics;'1 20 Adriaen Brouwer, Tavern Scene, c. 1635-37, oil on panel, 48 χ y6 cm, London, National Gallery. 21 Anonymous Netherlandish artist, retouched by Rubens, Drunken Peasants, 1630s, black chalk, retouched with pen and brown wash, heightened with cream bodycolour, 201 χ 336 mm, private collection.</page><page sequence="25">326 Karolien De Clippel 22 Peter Paul Rubens, Flemish Kermisy c. 1638, oil on panel, 149 χ ι6ι cm, Paris, Musée du Louvre. 23 Adriaen Brouwer, Smokers, c. 1635-37, oil on panel, 22 χ 29 cm, Paris, Musée du Louvre. In sum, from the outset of his artistic career Rubens showed a particular concern with low-life genre painting, and especially with Pieter Breugel and Adriaen Brouwer. What attracted Rubens in those genre painters was not so much the subject matter as their virtuosity in imitating nature expressed in their life-like landscapes and true-to-life representation of human nature and</page><page sequence="26">Rubens meets Brouwer 327 emotions. Until the first decades of the seventeenth century Bruegel was the most influential artist in this respect. But from the 1630s onwards, Brouwer became the leading low-life genre painter and redefined the discipline by rais ing the mimetic content of the genre to new heights and by giving his pictures an unseen vivacity. This is precisely why Rubens at the beginning of the 1630s turned his gaze towards this enigmatic and innovative painter, in part prompted by Brouwers physical presence in the city of Antwerp. Rubens' artistic practice bears out his concern with Brouwer, not so much on an immediately visible level in the choice of themes and composi tions, but rather in less obvious aspects of his art such as his retouching of existing genre pictures and his painterly technique. In my view, Rubens' purchase of Bruegel's Yawning Man and Brouwers fighting scenes and his retouching of Marten van Cleve's Twelfth Night cannot have been inspired by a presumably patriotic interest in the peasant subject only, but must have been guided by genre-specific features such as the realistic representation of life crystallized in trenchant facial expressions and movements, atmospheric renderings of nature, significant loose brushwork, and meaningful coloring. In other words, it was in his search for the perfect representational mode that Rubens met Brouwer. Appendix 1 March 4,1632 - On request of Daniel Deegbroot Adriaen Brouwer testifies that the painting repre senting a Peasant Dance is an original work that he made only once and that is now property of Peter Paul Rubens.

Jan Muylle was kind enough to share his unpublished insights with me for which I am very grateful. 3 The word 'boer', peasant, was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries used not only in the meaning of'farmer', but also in reference to people showing uncultivated behavior and being uncouth in appearance and/or speech. It's in the latter meaning that peasants are discussed in this context. Concerning the etymology and the meaning of'boeren', see Paul Vandenbroeck, Over wilden en narren, boeren en bedelaars. Beeld van de andere, vertoog over het zelf, cat. exh. (Antwerp, Royal Museum of Fine Arts) Lier, 1987, 63. Mariët Westermann has suggested to me that one of Brouwer's contributions consisted precisely in a play with the identity of his protagonists: 'peasants' in sensu stricto or not. In contrast with the sixteenth century Bruegelian pictures, the setting in Brouwer's paintings is some times not unambiguously rural and the same is true for the figures, who, in some cases seem to be rather discourteously behaving citizens. Illustrative is Brouwer's picture of the Smokers (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), where the artist shows himself between fellow painters. For the identity of the protagonists in this picture, see also K. De Clippel, 'Adriaen Brouwer, portrait painter: new identifications and an iconographic novelty', Simiolus 30 (2004), 196-216. 4 For Brouwers painting technique, see H. von Sonnenburg, 'Bemerkungen zu Brouwers Maltechnik', 103-112. 5 The most succinct insights into Brouwer's individual technique and his specific iconology are provided in K.

Two of them are probably painted in oils, the 'Flight into Egypt' now in the Courtauld Institute (no. 191) and the 'Hill of St Gotthard' (no. 192) which</page><page sequence="30">Rubens meets Brouwer 331 are possibly seen in a picture by Joos de Momper (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, inv. no. 644). Except from this, it is possible that another four paintings in Rubens' collectionwere selected for their representation of nature. The four items by Bruegel last classified in the Specification, 'The Temptation of Christ' (no. 210), A Painting of small ships' (no. 211), Ά Battle of Turks and Christians' (n°2i2) and Ά Landscape with a fire' (no. 213), are all described as being painted in watercolors. Rubens' choice of paintings in tempera on linen, a relatively inexpensive medium used for export and of which only two undisputed examples survive, both from the end of Bruegel's career (The Adoration of the Magi (Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Brussels and The Misanthrope (Museo Nazionale, Naples), might be explained, as suggested recently by Kristin Belkin, by the scarcity of available Bruegel paintings on the art market but also by Rubens' interest in the not so Flemish medium (tempera) and support (linen), in the handling of which Bruegel was said to be outstanding. See Belkin and Healy, op. cit. (n. 12), 159; Van Mander, op. cit. (n. 36), fol. 233 r, stanza 28, stanza 39-40. The descriptions of the painting depicting ships (no. 211) and the one with fire (no. 213) can be connected to surviving Bruegelian pictures and it is acceptable to classify them as landscape as well. The fire scene can be related to the incendiary effects in Bruegel's Dulle Griet (Museum Mayer van den Bergh, Antwerp) and his Triumph of the Death (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Seascapes with sailing vessels are numerous in Bruegel's oeuvre, as well as in paint (e.g. Storm at sea. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), in drawing (Riverscape near Baasrode. Staatliche Museen, Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin; View of the River Scheldt near Antwerp, Courtauld Institute Galleries, Seilern Collection, London) as in print (Frans Huys after Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Naval Battle in the Strait of Messina·, Idem, The Sailing Vessels). With his portrayals of vessels, Bruegel initiated a flourishing tradition in the Netherlandish art that survived until the nineteenth century. Since Bruegel was a pioneer in this field, it's not surprising that Rubens acquired an example of this. The biblical scene (no° 210) might be related to a painting with the same subject mentioned by Van Mander and described as 'a Temptation of Christ in which, as in the Alps, one looks down from above onto towns and countries with clouds swirling above them, through which one sees in some places'. See H. Miedema (ed.), Karel van Mander. The Lives of the Illustrious Netherlandish and German Painters, from the First Edition of the Schilder-boeck (1603 1604), II, Doornspijk 1994,193. Finally, the appearance of the battle scene is hard to determine: landscape might be dominant or not. See also Muller, op. cit. (n. 11), passim; Jaffé, op. cit. (n. 37). 39 Muller, op. cit. (n. 11), 132, no. 213 and 140, no. 274. 40 Those are in fact original contributions to a burgeoning specialty, which was most exploited in the work of the Caravaggisti. It seems that Rubens was particularly concerned with special light effects at two moments of his career: firstly, after his return from Italy, inspired by Adam Elsheimer (1578-1610) and Caravaggio (1573-1610) and also at the time when he probably acquired Breugel's work and secondly, in the 1630s when he not only purchased Brouwer's work but also returned to Elsheimer making a free rendering of his II Contento (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh) and painted his own Moonlit landscape. See Vlieghe, op. cit. (n. 27), 31-32,53-59; for this effects in landscape painting in particular, see Brown, op. cit. (n. 32), 30-32, 76. 41 Adler, op. cit.

In a commentary on the London exhibition of 1996, Christopher Brown reassessed his earlier view about Rubens' rather conventional attitude towards landscape painting by stressing the novelty of these late atmospheric landscapes and sketches by Rubens, without, however, referring to Brouwer. See Ch. Brown, 'The Construction and Development of Rubens' Landscapes: Reflections on the London Exhibition', in: H. Vlieghe, A. Balis and C. Van de Velde (eds.), Concept, Design &amp; Execution in Flemish Painting (1550-1700), Turnhout 2000, 267-277,esp. 274-277. 43 For this anthropomorphic approach of Rubens' landscapes, see H.-J. Raupp, 'Rubens und das Pathos der Landschaft', in: U Heinen and A. Thielemann, Rubens Passioni: Kultur der Leidenschafi im Barock, Göttingen 2001,159-179. 44 Houbraken, op. cit.

Jennifer Montagu even argues that sometimes painters choose subjects with the only purpose to display their skill in the rendering of affetti. See J. Montagu, The Expression of the Passions: the Origin and Influence of Charles Le Brun s Conférence sur I 'expression générale et particuliere, New Haven/London 1994, 62 63. 47 Bruegel's interest in this respect was probably stimulated by the Italian renaissance art and theory, of among others Leon Battista Alberti and Leonardo Da Vinci, who started to pay a lot of attention to expression. See Montagu, op. cit. (n. 46), 64-65. 48 Whether the grisaille belonging to the National Trust at Upton House, Banbury is autograph or not, is still a topic under discussion. For a recent status quaestionis, see Ν. M. Orenstein, Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Drawings and Prints, cat. exh.

It might be that he retouched the drawing early in his career and specifically before his marriage with Isabella Brant in 1609, the moment when the Bruegel painting came into his possession. 50 'Virgin, when you sought the secure realms of your son, what great joys filled your breast! What would have been sweeter for you than to migrate from the prison of the earth to the lofty temples of the longed-for heavens! And when you left the sacred group [of followers of Christ] whose mentor you had been, what sadness sprang up in you. How sad as well as how joyful was that pious gathering of you and your son as they watched you go. What was a greater joy for them than for you to reign [in heaven], what greater sadness than to miss your appearances? This picture, created by a skillful hand, shows the happy bearing of sadness on the faces of the just'. Translation of original Latin inscription quoted from: Orenstein, 27, int.

Gibson, '[Review] Jan de Jong et al., Pieter Bruegel (Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek/ Netherlandish Yearbook for Art History, 47) i997'j Simiolus 26 (1998), 120-129, esp. 123-124. 52 Aristides of Thebe was described in Pliny's Historia naturalis as the first classical artist painting the soul, who gave expression to the emotions of man . See also Montagu, op. cit. (n. 46), 60. 53 K. van Mander, Den grondt der edel vry schilder-const, Haarlem 1604, fol. 27, stanza 54; English translation borrowed from Melion, op. cit. (n. 36), 67. 54 According to Walter Melion Van Mander suggests throughout his treatise that the depiction of the human passions ('affecten') was one of the three aspects articulating the image production of Netherlandish art, together with 'netticheydt' ('meticulousness' or 'fastidiousness') and 'reflexy-const' ('the art of reflection'). See Melion, op. cit. (n. 36), 60-77, esP· 66-69. It is likely, that we even can go further and assume that it is typical of Netherlandish genre painters in particular. 55 Since the Renaissance with its interest in human physiognomy, those character heads had gained in popularity, also in de Netherlands. They alternately express transitory emotions as joy and sorrow or enduring characteristics as optimism and malignancy. In fact, towards the seventeenth century, such tronies were considered a type of work characteristic of genre painters in general and of Pieter Bruegel the Elder in particular. Bruegel not only painted heads, but was in all probability also responsible for the designs of a whole series of paired off tronies featuring peasants, moors and wild men, engraved around 1564-65 by Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum. Those prints were very popular during the seventeenth century, certainly as study material among artists. The composition of juxtaposed heads in pairs, which probably applies to the 'deux petits visages en rondeaux, du vieux Bruegel' in Rubens' inventory (nos. 195-196) as well, is based on physiognomy and the way she reveals herself among others in the work of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) and in illustrated handbooks in the style of Giovanni della Porta's De humanaphysiognomia (1586). Rubens shared this interest in physiognomy since the beginning of his career. He painted not only a large quantity of heads as models for his paintings, but moreover, paired different physiognomic types and personalities. See J. Miiller-Hofstede, 'Die Kopfstudie im Werk des Rubens', Wallraf-Richartz-Jahrbuch 30 (1968), 223-252; E. McGrath, '"Not even a fly": Rubens and the Mad Emperors', The Burlington Magazine 123 (1991), 699-703. That Rubens effectively appreciated Bruegel's 'tronies' because of their physiognomic qualities is underscored by their place in de Specification. The fact is that they are grouped together and, what is more, immediately followed by 'vn pourtrait d'vn homme auec un grand nez, de Hemsen' (a portrait of a man with a big nose, by Jan van Hemessen), a work that is not identified but most likely shows one of the for Van Hemessen typical Leonardesque, almost caricatural figures which are to be related to the same working category as Bruegel's tronies. I do not share Kristin Belkin's view who is surprised by the high quantity of heads by Bruegel in Rubens' inventory as not being 'Bruegel's most characteristic works' and 'not the type of work that had the greatest impact on Rubens'. See Belkin, Healy, op. cit. (n. 12), 158-159. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century biographers emphatically praised genre painters for the natural rendering of human nature and character, emotions and passions. There existed a kind of silent consensus that recognized genre painters as physiognomists. See J. Muylle, 'Tronies toegeschreven aan Pieter Bruegel. Fysionomie en expressie (1)', De zeventiende eeuw 17 (2001), 174-204, esp. 194; see also note 54 of this article. 56 Rubens' drawing after Bruegel, together with the Peasant scenes in Chatsworth, were sometimes attributed to Van Dyck, but have rather recently been given to Rubens. See M. Jaffé, 'Rubens as a Collector of Drawings, Part three', Master Drawings 4 (1966), 134, pi. 9a; J. Held, Rubens: Selected Drawings, 2n ed., New York 1986, 64-65, no. 4. 57 The nature and problems in the realization of Rubens' copy described in his Specification as 'Vn combat des paysans faict apres vn dessein du vieux Breugel' have been extensively discussed by Kristin Belkin. See Van Bruegel tot Rubens. De Antwerpse schilderschool 1550-1650, cat. exh. Antwerp (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten), Ghent 1992-1993, 170-171. 58 About the genesis and effects of Rubens' aggressive scenes, see A. W. Vetter, '"Gegen rasende Wut, was vermag da Schönheit". Inszenierungen von Schrecken und Gewalt im Werk des Peter Paul Rubens', in: N. Biittner and U. Heinen (eds.), Peter Paul Rubens: Barocke Leidenschafien, cat. exh. Braunschweig (Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum), Munich 2004,58-68. 59 Rubens himself painted in the course of his career a lot of aggressive battle scenes, for the origin of which one has often referred to his copies after Italian examples such as Michelangelo's Battle ofLapiths and Centaurs, Titian's Battle ofCadore, Raphael's Battle of Constantine and Leonardo da Vinci's Battle ofAnghiari. Each composition contributed in a different way to Rubens' personal formulation of fighting scenes. Titian's Battle ofCadore for example excelled through its composition and suggestion of dynamics. See amongst others M. Jaffé, Rubens and Italy, Oxford 1977,17, 20, 30, 34, 71, figs. 14,16, 51-54; J. Wood, Rubens Drawing on Italy, cat. exh.

In this respect, one should also refer to Brouwer's representations of the subject. At a later date, they probably molded Rubens' expression of vehement emotions. 60 G.P. Lomazzo, Trattato dell Arte de la Pittura, Milan 1584, II, 9-20; VI, 65. 61 Heinen, Thielemann, op. cit. (n. 43); Biittner, Heinen, op. cit.

I have chosen to reproduce here the print instead of the painting, because it illustrates more</page><page sequence="32">Rubens meets Brouwer 333 clearly Hercules' expression. For Rubens' painting and Christoffel Jegher's reproduction of Hercules crushing Discord, see G. Martin, Rubens: The Whitehall Ceiling (Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard, XV), in print. 64 In his description Van Mander focuses mainly on the expression of the eyes, while for Seneca the impact of the emotion spreads all over the body, skin and hair. Both Brouwer and Rubens transpose more or less literally Seneca's description to the painting surface. See Van Mander, op. cit. (n. 54), fol. 27, stanzas 59-60; J. Lipsius (ed.), L. Annaei Senecae Philosophi opera, quae existantomnia·, 2nd ed., Antwerp, 1615, 2V. 65 U. Heinen, 'Haut und Knochen - Fleisch und Blut. Rubens' Affektmalerei', in: Heinen and Thielemann, op. cit.

(n. 4), 43 and corresponding footnotes. 67 Since Pliny, this terminology referred in a figurative sense to the low status of genre paintings versus the serious history paintings which were in'tgroot. At the same time, it could simply allude to the small size of the panels, as was the case in Cornells De Bie's Gulden Cabinet {1662). He used the expression equally in reference to history, genre and to landscape paintings. See for example C. De Bie, Gulden Cabinet vande Edele Vry Schilderconst (Antwerpen, 1662), ed. G. Lemmens, Soest 1971,38,50,58,112, 148,152,163,168, 237, 251, 314, 320, 373. For the norm related value of small sizes, see Muylle, op. cit. (n. 28), 203-208. 68 Adriaen Van de Venne (1589-1662) would continue Brouwer's method of making grisaille paintings where color is perfectly methaphoric and in conformity with the outcasts represented. See M. Westermann, 'Fray en Leelijck. Adriaen Van de Venne's Invention of the Ironic Grisaille', in: Art for the Market, op. cit. (n. 28), 221-257. 69 It was precisely in the years of his intensive interaction with Brouwer's work during the 1630s, that Rubens seems to have developed his color theory. In a letter to his friend Peiresc dated March 16,1636, he states: 'I hope you will already have received my essay on the subject of colors'. SeeR.S. Magurn, The Letters of Peter Paul Rubens, Cambridge, Mass. 1955,404 70 J.

(n. 70). 73 More in particular, I am thinking about the man behind the two main figures on the foreground. 74 The unfastened pants are to be seen on several paintings by Brouwer from his Antwerp period. For example on the Two Boors Fighting by a Barrel (fig. 2), probably owned by Rubens and, more strikingly, in his Tavern scene in the London National Gallery (fig. 20). 75 See H.

Furthermore, the nurse feeding the children had to be in good physical condition and, as assumed by Adriaen Poirters, 'not contaminated with defects of the soul, and bat habits: because there is no doubt that young children take it in with the milk'.

Healy, 'Das Unerwartete wahrnehmen, das zu Erwartende interpretieren: Die Liebe sehen wie Rubens sie make', in: Biittner and Heinen, op. cit. (n. 43), 39-48. 8z I think here more in particular of the Peasant Dance (Museo del Prado, Madrid) and the Pastoral Landscape with a Rainbow (Hermitage, St Petersburg), where Rubens combined contemporary and antique elements and, thus, created a totally new picture.
