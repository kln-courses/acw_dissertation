<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VIEW FROM THE LINEN HALL Unnatural selection. In his 1989 essay, "The Hero as Demolition Man," the German poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger describes an anti-heroic paradigm for the future of liberal democracy in the aftermath of the twentieth century's totalitarian dictatorships. Recalling Clausewitz's dictum that retreat under fire is the most difficult of all manoeuvres in war, he continues: It is the same in politics. The ultimate act in the art of the possible is being able to surrender an untenable position. If the greatness of a hero is measured by the difficulty of the task he faces, we must not only revise our notion of heroism, but reverse it. Any cretin can throw a bomb. It is a thousand times more difficult to disarm one. The new breed of political "hero" - if the term can still be used - will be a protagonist of the art of retreat who represents "not victory, conquest, or triumph, but resignation, withdrawal, and devolution". This is the politician of renunciation, the demolition expert who understands that progress is retreat wherever the instruments of a system have got the better of our humanity. Among Enzensberger's examples are Khrushchev after Stalin; Suarez after Franco; and, above all, Gorbachev as the driving force that dismantled the Soviet empire. Thus the hero of retreat, by undermining the system supporting him, is typically cast aside, defeated by his own success. For Enzensberger, this new breed of political protagonist is already mustering inside our own all-conquering - if ecologically commensal - polity. The West too, even in its Cold War triumph, must face up sooner or later to the task of demolition: A German philosopher once said that by the end of this century we will want not to have improved the world but to have saved it. This applies not only to those dictatorships that have been scrapped, peacefully or not, before our eyes, but also those Western democracies that face an impending and unprecedented disarmament. Military disengagement is only one of the forms of retreat to consider. Other untenable positions have to be abandoned in our economic war against the Third World, and the most difficult of all our retreats will take place in the war we have been waging against our biosphere since the Industrial Revolution. 7</page><page sequence="2">IRISH PAGES Long before 1989, the tenor of that final observation was more commonsense than prophetic insight. Century's end has come, and it does seem we are contemplating not only Lilliputian contexts of improvement-as-usual, but a race to avert a still-more grotesque, baroque and (in the worst scientific scenarios) metaphorically apocalyptic plateau in the degradation of the biosphere, in which man's ecological footprint first outpaces, then overwhelms, the natural phenomena that govern our world. In the coming century, what Casey Walker calls, in this issue, a "world-historical debate" (p.137) between globalists and localists will hinge on this challenge of ecological retreat. If there is to be a withdrawal from elements of our technosphere, leaving a rubble of obsolete ideas and discarded forms, then the localists will need many protagonists of demolition - and fast. Inveterate beachcombers in Ireland (like this writer) will be aware that there is not a strand on the island free of the escalating flotsam and jetsam of industrial products. Indeed, remote beaches, in furthest Donegal or Mayo, are often the worse, notwithstanding their spectacular setting of cliff, cove and sea-stack. Left to its own devices, a crescent of remote shingle can accumulate on its tidemark a harlequin of plastics dating back decades. All of these have come into existence in living memory, since the fifties - the decade, tellingly, when "environmentalism" went global with the writings of Rachel Carson - even though some of these petrochemical derivatives can last, undisturbed, for 50,000 years. In retrospect, the intersection of Carson's early warnings and the postwar surge in the petrochemical economy seems to mark the moment when the balance between the biosphere and the technosphere tipped precipitously towards the latter. It cannot be gainsaid: the world is being filled up with human things and influences, and at an astonishingly rapid rate in historical and geophysical terms. There are too many of us by half and our technohive is packing the finite planetary space with unsustainable surfeits of created stuff. A kind of Malthusian mathematics now characterizes our production of artefacts, structures, emissions, effluents, impacts of every stripe. In New York City alone, for instance, five billion beverage containers must be "disposed of" every year. Peter Matthiessen, the great chronicler of the natural world, who grew up on the other end of Long Island, describes how the waters of its Sound have morphed from pristine clarity to clouded degradation in a single lifetime. Whatever the counter-currents of good news, and there are some, that is an apt metaphor for the overall direction of the globe's ecology over the past century. So too is the human debris on the world's coasts, whereupon last century's 8</page><page sequence="3">IRISH PAGES explosion of technosphere into biosphere can be read in vivid microcosm. The global tidemark is a vast palimpsest of our monumental ecological impact on the largest and most immemorial wilderness, the sea. What lies out of sight and mind in terrestrial dumps, landfills and fly-tips arrives as an open book on the ebb and flow of the intertidal zone. Three decades ago, I could still be surprised by a moonlit Andalusian shore littered with the debris of rapid industrialization, or a beer can in a pristine cove in circumpolar Labrador. Not long ago, in a national park on a remote Mediterranean island, along the utterly isolated shoreline of a saltwater lake, I studied a tidal scum of oil-globs and small bits of plastic. Nowhere, it seemed, was beyond the anabasis of our exponential waste. To the technosphere's Brobdingnagian scale and extension must added the escalating durability of its components. In turn-of-the-century London, then the world's largest megapolis, about 85% of waste was cinders and charcoal, easily returned to the soil cycle, and much of the rest was biodegradable, like wood, paper and compost. Now the contemporary economy produces a juggernaut of plastics and other synthetic products that are not subject to the natural timescales of decay, fragmentation or metallic disintegration. Take, for instance, the proverbial wine bottle. For centuries, the rich ecology of the Iberian cork groves has served wine-makers well. In recent years, however, a variant plastic stopper has begun to make its appearance in the bottles of certain brands. Which means, probably, tens of millions of new non-biodegradable objects of indeterminate persistence being poured onto the globe each year. No doubt the flipchart marketeers will yammer on about their innovative reasons, but this sort of artefact cries out for direct banning - pre-emptive, without concession - as a salutary instance of ecological retreat in miniature. It gets worse on a myriad of fronts. The ownership of automobiles, with their evolving kaleidoscope of materials, is expected to rise from 900 million to 1.5 billion on the next three decades. Computers were billed as the immaterial end of "the paper office" (forlorn hope!), but, in a blink of ecological time, the IT revolution has actually created a huge waste-mountain of plastics, precious metals, wires, disks, chips and assorted infrastructures that is proving highly difficult to recycle economically. Much of the outdated technology is gathering dust in backrooms and attics, uncertain of its destination, and has yet to reach the dump (in the US) or the recycling depot Sin Europe, as of this year). In an unregulated and supremely toxic trade, discarded CDs are being exported to impoverished villages in China, to be 'melted for trace elements of precious metals, before ending in Dali-esque 9</page><page sequence="4">IRISH PAGES slag-heaps: one small piece in the jigsaw of national ecological calamity unleashed by the surging Chinese amalgam of economy and repression. In the military sphere especially, new generations of quasi-indestructible fabrics and materiel are being devised for widespread application. Like all these examples, no one seems to know, or care, what will happen to these things when they come to be "thrown away". They must languish somewhere, unable to decay, impossible to re-use, difficult to burn, improbable for re- cycling: a quintessential piece of short-termism mandated by the cult of "growth" per se. Clearly, if the scale and nature of the technosphere continues in this unbridled fashion, the globe will be swamped everywhere by the geophysical impact of humanity. All this constitutes what might be called "the waste-space crisis". Our global bind is not, however, merely a complex second-order issue of waste collection, management and elimination, essential as these are. No doubt the ecological way forward here will be "closed-loop systems" (such as those pioneered in a number of German Ldnder) in which all recyclables are extracted; the waste residue used for fuel in power stations and construction; and nothing returned to landfill. In this way, one can imagine the waste stream gradually becoming its own closed and homeostatic system contained increasingly within the production cycles of the technosphere, rather than being flushed back, as is the default norm, into the beleaguered biosphere. If this kind of self-fuelling sustainability could be combined with a general cessation in the war on the biosphere, one might even permit oneself the Chekhovian hope that the future may yet be "unspeakably, amazingly lovely". No, in the present dire ecological circumstances, the Waste-Space Crisis is an altogether more profound geophysical-cum-anthropological axiom: the visible precipitate of our ravening consumption of the biosphere. "Waste" is our slug's trail through the natural world;"space," the smothering quilt of all our trails. In a "waste" sense, the emblematic impact is climate change; in a "space" sense, the trinity of habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity and mass extinction. For humanity in its own right has now become a colossal geophysical force. In a speech after his dismissal as Environment Minister, Michael Meacher memorably distilled years of Whitehall briefings: Our biological carbon activity is now exceeded only by the krill in the oceans. Our civil engineering works shift more soil each year than all the world's rivers bring to the seas. Our industrial emissions eclipse the total emissions from all the world's volcanoes. We are 10</page><page sequence="5">IRISH PAGES bringing about species loss on a scale of some of the massive natural extinctions of palaeohistory. We are altering the nitrogen cycle ... Some 420 million people live in countries that no longer have enough crop land to grow their own food. Half a billion people live in regions prone to chronic drought. By 2025 that number is likely to have increased fivefold. Marine ecoystems are at risk, including salt- water marshes, mangroves, coastal wetlands and coral reefs. In 1998, the hottest year on record, large areas of forest burned down after prolonged drought. By 2050 it is projected that the Amazon will have died back. On top of this, alterations in the shimmering disequilibrium of our biosphere will unlock changes that must interact with the original shifts and may grossly magnify their effects. And chaos theory suggests that, for the same methodological reason we cannot exactly predict the weather more than two weeks in advance (i.e., the knock-on effects of the impossibility of perfect measurement), we will never be able to anticipate fully the unfolding of our own geophysical influences. Politically, one of the more revolutionary pieces of science in recent years must be the concept of "the ecological footprint" trail-blazed by the distinguished biologist E. O. Wilson. Unlike his understanding of humanity's feeling for other life ("biophilia") or of the convergence between science and the arts ("consilience"), this formulation is underpinned by hard empirical numbers. It expresses the average appropriation of productive land and shallow sea by each person in bits and pieces from around the world for food, water, housing, energy, transportation, commerce and waste absorption. The ecological footprint ranges from one hectare (2.5 acres) in the developing world to 9.6 hectares (24 acres) in the US, with the global average for the total human population at 2.1 hectares (5.2 acres). For every person now in the world to reach present American levels of consumption would require four more planet Earths. With the current global population predicted by the UN to rise and possibly peak at nine-to-ten billion by 2050 (i.e., an addition of 200,000 people per week for the next half century), two further Earths would be needed. A recent study exploring this concept calculates that the human population outstripped the Earth's sustainable capacity in the late seventies. In the decade after the 1992 Summit on the Environment, world GNP has increased by half, even as the global pattern of wealth's ancient dichotomy has deepened. 11</page><page sequence="6">IRISH PAGES This eco-equation - comprising the three variables, economy, democracy, environment - has deep political ramifications. Firstly, it makes plain that global growth alone, without massive North-South redistribution, will not lead in the overall direction of social justice, even if the five billion people of the developing world never aspire to levels of American and Western European profligacy. Secondly, and consequently, the spread of real democracy across the less developed nations, echoing Europe's own history, would perforce come to challenge the powers and privileges husbanded by the developed world's ecological footprint. Lastly, there is a close practical and ethical connection between the population bottleneck, genuine democracy and the necessary stewardship of the natural world on behalf of the common good. Consider, for example, ancient forests, 80% of which have now been consumed or degraded. The staggering rapidity of their destruction - largely for and by the developed world in league with authoritarian local elites - represents a one-off realization of an ancient ecological asset mainly for the benefit of the wealthy footprint. Tribal forest people universally oppose such rapaciousness, understanding well the link between long-term stewardship and self-interest. At the heart of the issues of social justice and ecological defence, then, is the same imperium of economy waging war against the global poor annhhe biosphere. Thus, the common good and the wild commons are naturally democratic allies. A kind of global political triangulation is emerging, whose three points are the variables listed above. It is, however, an inverted pyramid, with the vertex of environment sustaining the other two. If the balance of this triangulation is not shifted from the current unbridled sovereignty of economy, the gross inequities of the North-South divide will come into intractable contradiction with the spread of global democracy; indeed, in this not- improbable scenario, the power of economy and technoscience will become more and more inimical to the claims of real democracy and a sustainable environment. Already the relations between the three points are literally "ruled" in the interests of a brutalist economy by the defacto global government known as the World Trade Organization. "The race is now on between the technoscientific forces that are destroying the living environment and those that can be harnessed to save it," writes Wilson in The Future of Life (2001). "We are inside a bottleneck of overpopulation and wasteful consumption. If the race is won, humanity can emerge in far better condition than when it entered, and with most of the diversity of life still intact." Throughout the twentieth century, the various ideological struggles and systems were united in their prodigal war on the biosphere. Crusoe-like, 12</page><page sequence="7">IRISH PAGES humanity built up its stockade of creature comforts with, in the main, blithe disregard for the gathering ecological perils. There were intimations and warnings and even eco-battles, but the overall anthropological momentum has not been trammelled, only slowed and questioned, with little sign of the necessary retreats. Now the ecological footprint is Man Friday's warning that the splendid isolation of our hubris is gone forever. The contemporary technosphere, then, is no less than an evolutionary threat to the biosphere. Our cultural evolution is a far twig on a branch of a branch of a branch of the great beech of evolution, but one that is hacking away madly at the whole tree. We risk making our own small berth a monstrous outgrowth compared to the radically deformed rest. Mass disasters, social as well as natural, might then, like storms, devastate parts of our branch's ecological exposure. With many of our creations, such as mega-dams and agricultural monocultures, technological occupation of the globe is increasingly the long- term problem per se; though to say this is still treated as major heresy in much of the political and media worlds. Our technosphere, ramped up by the Industrial Revolution, has become a mobile machine in itself, expanding unstoppably until, perhaps, something judders it to slowdown, or even retreat. Some scientists suggest that our elimination of biodiversity and ecosystems that do not serve our immediate requirements could provoke a total system collapse in the biosphere. What is certain - as the debate over climate change already illustrates - is that the ecological worldview will move from the margins to the centre of historical consciousness in the coming century. On some level, of course, every technology is destructive geophysically: this is part of the meaning of culture. Nor, of course, is there anything new about our clearing of primeval forests or annihilation of large mammals, both which have been in train, respectively, since Neolithic and Paleolithic times. In one of W.G. Sebald's omnium gatherum novels there is a darkly vivid page describing the clearing of forests from pre-historic Europe through to contemporary Brazil and Borneo, a brief history of civilization as combustion: Our spread over the earth was fuelled by reducing the higher species of vegetation to charcoal, by incessantly burning whatever would burn ... Combustion is the hidden principle behind every artefact ... Like our bodies and our desires, the machines we have devised are possessed of a heart that is slowly reduced to embers. From earliest times, human civilization has been no more than a strange 13</page><page sequence="8">IRISH PAGES luminescence growing more intense by the hour, of which no one can say when it will begin to wane and when it will fade away. For the time being, our cities still shine through the night, and our fires still spread. (The Rings of Saturn, 1998) Millennia of fearful and exploitative struggle with the natural world: this is the deep-time backdrop to the contemporary consumption of the biosphere. Yet, against this archaic human pattern, the ecological perspective institutes the equivalent of a Copernican revolution, in which the dependency of economy and social progress on the fixed constraints of the biosphere assumes its centrality. As with the death of the Ptolemaic theory, it is the very antiquity of the worldview overturned that vouchsafes the conceptual power of the insurgent paradigm. Ideas like the ecological footprint are not so much "environmentalism" as a real-world intrusion into the still-ascendant "cornucopian" worldview, our contemporary equivalent of flat-earthers, astrolabes and alchemical quest. In this delirium of anthropomorphism, Earth's horn is (or can be made) perpetually fruitful; growth is, therefore, boundless; and human ingenuity allied to technology can ultimately solve whatever problems the detritus of progress throws up. Integral to much environmental thinking over recent decades is the implicit aspiration for a restoration. If the war against the biosphere could be decisively limited, if the essentially "chemical" nature of pollution and waste could be rectified, if ecosystems could be spared and/or allowed to regenerate - and so on - nature's own healing powers would be given a powerful breathing space. The momentum of the contemporary technosphere, sustained by what Andrew Kimbrell aptly calls "the technological imagination" (p. 195), might be checked and, by implication, reversed in favour of the new paradigm of Earth's human stewardship. For many of us touched by the environmentalism of the sixties and seventies, this aspiration was undoubtedly influenced by the perception, or actual experience, of a world more commodious than now to the wild spaces of pristine biota. Call it the Born Free effect. No doubt, like that filmic kitsch, this feature of the zeitgeist partook of old urban traditions of romanticized nature; no doubt, too, the situation was more dire even then than imagined. But the feeling in the historical air of a globe not wholly spoilt, and the aspiration to defend that, if necessary by self-imposed limits and hard retreat, was and is a truth worth cherishing. It may also be, as one scholar of wilderness has ruefully contemplated, an older passing consciousness at the moment when 14</page><page sequence="9">IRISH PAGES the full-spectrum global dominance of the technosphere came into sight. Looming over the future of ecological thinking and the biosphere generally is the possibility that most people in a still-more crowded and technologized future will not share, or be able to share, or even care about, this firsthand feeling of a globe still partly unspoilt, and the concomitant desire to protect it. If so, something incomparably rare and precious will have vanished from the common geography of human life. Alas, worldviews die hard. Though challenged, there is little sign of the technological imagination relinquishing its firm grip on the psychic sceptre. On the contrar)y, far from being chastised by the waste-space crisis et al, one of the salient features of our technosphere over the last two decades is the emergence of a wholly new order of assault on the biosphere. This is the overarching theme of the suite of essays and interviews that follows under the rubric "The Genetic Nightmare". Having spent millennia bending the biosphere to its will, humanity is now poised to begin re-designing it through the agency of bio- and nano-technology in what is, essentially, a new evolutionary process of "unnatural selection". With biotechnology, life itself will be increasingly engineered and thus technologized, and the wild thoroughly endangered; with nano-technology, matter will be refabricated on sub-atomic and molecular levels, often involving the insertion of micro-computers. To our mass chemical pollution since the Industrial Revolution, we have begun to add two qualitatively different types of contamination: the biological and the genetic (pp. 192-193), both of which are irreversible. In this new outcrop of the cornucopian universe, nothing has been learnt from our war on the biosphere. Problems with the sustainability of the biosphere? Let us redesign it in the interests of the technosphere, with no chance of a restoration of the natural status quo ante. The biosphere must not merely bend, but conform, to the technosphere and its empire of patents and endless commodification. Billions of years of natural selection must be turned to the topical ends of unnatural selection. It is the supreme hubris of the technological imagination. As the four scientific critics here make plain (p. 155), there is a strongly totalitarian flavour to the "inevitabilities" of the biotech enterprise. This was first borne home to me in a 2000 passage by Wendell Berry about the tyranny of technological and genetic monocultures: "Monsanto's aptly named 'Terminator Gene' - which, implanted in seed sold by Monsanto, would cause the next generation of seed to be sterile - is as grave an indicator of totalitarian 15</page><page sequence="10">IRISH PAGES purpose as a concentration camp." Armed with genetic irreversibility, the new totalitarians of the technosphere mean to impose their unnatural selection in a unilateral override both of the fabric of evolution (the non-anthropomorphic angle) and of centuries of democratic practice (the anthropomorphic angle). They are, in a real sense, our era's infidels (from the Latin infidehs: unfaithful), in their radical and cumulatively reckless assault on the given world of evolutionary time. Unnatural selection's non-compatibility in principle with the whole Darwinian biosphere will be the long-term circle that cannot be squared. If the pollen of GM maize devastates the reproduction of the Monarch butterfly - one of the glories of the North American continent - so be it: the organic and wild must be suborned to the cornucopian, the given biosphere to the fallibly human imprint. The technology is totalitarian because it is a kind of permanent biological legislation in favour of its own premises, ending forever what the opposition defends. Between organic pollen and GM pollen, between the butterfly and its non-existence, there really is no half-way house, no compromise, no long-term coexistence (flowing, in this case, from inevitable cross-fertilization). Life increasingly technologized, or life increasingly preserved: the anthropomorphic reordering of the biosphere, or the preservation of its immemorial and sustaining integrity: this is the long-term ecological, and philosophical, conflict that simply cannot be dodged. Should any of this surprise us? For a long time the developed world's forte has been an extreme devotion to the technological imagination, its handmaiden technoscience, rampant commodification, and the power of the modern corporation. It is hardly an historical coincidence that the totalitarian impulse has now surfaced obliquely in their biotech interaction. Not long after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Vaclav Havel remarked that the now-ascendant West might not be immune to the totalitarian siren-call. Things change: the contemporary balance between an older liberal democracy and late capitalism globalized is not immutable. All power without serious self-restraint or opposition is a formula for the authoritarian turn. It is interesting that the proponent of "the end of history" thesis, in the sense of the end of real ideological struggle, Francis Fukuyama, has turned his apologist's attentions to the future of biotechnology. He has correctly apprehended that it is not ideology, but technology, that will be this century's battlefield of futures. The epicentre of these totalitarian enchantments is twofold: the corporate or university lab, and the patent office. The biotech lab has become an 16</page><page sequence="11">IRISH PAGES unacknowledged legislator of immense social power: largely unregulated in spirit, highly secretive vis-a-vis premises and ends, and quite a-democratic. For those familiar with its often bizarre research culture, it is apparent that this vast alliance of academic ego, "lab fever"(i.e., overstatement of results), money, the corporation and the state is continually attempting to create as much fait accompli as can be possibly sneaked under the ethical radar of wider society. The locus of the lab is instigating a dizzying array of ethical issues with which civil society cannot keep up. What happens if GM techniques go DIY for the general population? Given chaos theory applied to the totality of Earth's ecology, can we be sure how even one genetic modification may impact or evolve in the long-term? Will widespread genetic modification interact unpredictably with climate change? Can whole ecosystems, such as the soil (and this is already being worked on), now be modified and patented? Will it become impossible over time for evolutionary biologists to correctly interpret natural selection due to widespread genetic modification infilitrating the whole biosphere? Not to mention the Brave New World of designer babies, cloning, and the truly explosive possibilities of germline (human stem cell) genetic engineering, "the single most portentous technological threshold in history" (pp. 178-188). Darwin, who surely would have been aghast by much of this, remarks in Origin of Species: "No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us." That is hardly less true today. Nothing is inevitable. Biotechnology might be compared to the medieval system of indulgences, by which the Church commodified souls. Likewise, for sceptics and opponents, some collective ecological equivalent of Luther's 95 Theses needs to set its face against the biotech simonry. The symbolic first of these should be a fundamental moral opposition to the ownership and release of the stuff of life by dint of its genetic modification, however many patents and principalities may claim this right. History shows over and again that disempowered ideas, meeting with changed circumstances, can seize the Chorus of social values. The symbolic last of these should concern the utter defence of the line whose crossing would constitute a full-scale ecological declaration of war: the design of lifeforms from scratch, which must now be judged a real possibility in the foreseeable future. If the art of ecological retreat is to take hold, a sea-change in the law's understanding and treatment of nature is required: a migration of legal sensibility not unlike that in antiquity described by Seamus Heaney in "A 17</page><page sequence="12">IRISH PAGES Veteran Awareness" (p.101). The right to patent genetically-modified life stems, in the first instance, from a single decision of the Supreme Court in 1980. That is an illustration of both the power and the fragility of legal precedent. In this light, probably the single most important step that could be taken would be the establishment of a World Environment Court, a framework of international law that would place the operation of free trade and competition within parameters safeguarding the biosphere. It would need to be based on a global environment charter; have the power to enforce the many multilateral environmental agreements that already exist between states; and operate on a legal par with the World Trade Organization. The right to bring cases could be extended to NGOs and other public bodies, and the Court might have specialist staffs to investigate environmental damage, inflicted or threatened. Serious thought should also be given to endowing parts of the natural world with legal "personhood" of the sort now enjoyed by corporations. A mountain gorilla is certainly closer to a "person" than the blue oval of the Ford Motor Company. In time the very existence of the threat of collective and individual responsibility would act as a major brake on our war with the biosphere. Without a legal spur to retreat, one can imagine the ominous direction biotech, in particular, might take. After centuries of modifying and patenting the biosphere, (so reminiscent of seventeenth-century enclosures in England), would not the organic and wild themselves come to be seen as unwelcome "competition"? After all, if you own all the patents to engineered wheat or GM forests (both already widely planted in the US), it might be in your interest to see the social and natural demise of the last "independent" varieties of these species. It would be time to become "terminator" to one part of the old organic order. Yet great powers have their Achilles heel. With gene and nano, this is the patent system itself, allied to the extreme sensitivity of markets and a consequent need for full political control. The inevitable calamities - a virus escaped, a GM organism running amok like rhododendron, a nano-chip wreaking havoc on its host - will prove a field day for salutary pursuit. For the patent not only confers ownership, but attributes responsibility. Call it the Thermopylae effect. If the terrain is well-chosen, even a small band of localists can hold the pass against the ambitions of a Xerxes. Chris Agee 18</page></plain_text>
