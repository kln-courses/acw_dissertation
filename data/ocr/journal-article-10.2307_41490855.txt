<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation: Dream, Fantasy, Illusion, and Álayavijñana* Haoming Liu In his controversial book on modern European lyric poetry Hugo Friedrich considers the sharp contrast between fantasy and reality to be a main feature of modern lyric poetry (1979: 24/). According to Friedrich, fantasy in modern lyric poetry, as it is exemplified in Charles Baudelaire's Les fleurs du mal, is not an effusion of subjective feelings, which used to be regarded as an essential characteristic of lyric poetry, but an intellectually guided operation (37). In Baudelaire, fantasy and dream are often identical (53); they are two key means by which the poet transforms and de-realizes re- ality - and reality has to be transformed or destroyed if it is to have any poetic validity or achieve a poetic effect. In lieu of reality or any tradition- ally accepted transcendental religion such as Christianity, Friedrich sees an empty ideality in modern lyric poetry. "Baudelaire," argues Friedrich, "of- ten speaks of the supernatural and the mysterious. What he means can be understood only if the reader, like the poet himself, gives up the attempt to fill these words with a content other than an absolute mysteriousness itself. The empty ideality, the undefined 'Other,' which in Rimbaud is still more undefined and in Mallarmé turns into nothingness, is what is behind the self-enclosing mystic quality of modern lyric poetry" (1979: 49; italics added). With depersonalization, de-realization, and empty ideality, what is left in modern lyric poetry is the unfailing presence of the consciousness Ť I would like to thank Mr. Feng Sichun for lending me unpublished manuscripts of his late father.

Paraphrasing Friedrich, Jonathan Culler writes, "this structure gives us a depersonalized subjectivity transforming reality by acts of consciousness" (1988: 296). Friedrichů criticism of modern European lyric poetry has caused some controversy.1 Critics such as Paul de Man fault his generalization for a lack of theoretical penetration. But his characterization of some of the essen- tial features of modern European lyric poetry does help one grasp its dis- tinct qualities, and for this purpose it remains by and large valid. In com- parison to such a characterization, there lacks a basic consensus over the essential features of modern Chinese lyric poetry. Indeed, much is to be desired in the study of modern Chinese lyric poetry in comparison not only to that of its European counterpart but also to that of other genres in modern Chinese literature. In view of this less than satisfactory state of scholarship in the field, Friedrichů observations on Baudelaire and mod- ern European lyric poetry can be invoked to serve as a frame of reference in an examination of modern lyric poetry in China. They are pertinent and useful especially because Baudelaire and French Symbolist poetry were a major source of inspiration for many modern Chinese poets.2 More than any so-called Chinese Symbolist poets,3 Fei Ming (1901-1967) in particular, even though he didn't know French, was deeply indebted to Baudelaire - a fact ignored by all literary historians. Fei Ming's Baudelairean heritage has been ignored perhaps because, as is demonstrated later, it was re- flected more in spirit than in letter. More than any other modern Chinese poet, Fei Ming was able to grasp some of the most essential aspects of poetic modernity, which, as Friedrich has illustrated, had become manifest for the first time in Baudelaire. In the following investigation of Fei Ming's fascinating ideas about modern Chinese poetry and of his own poetic prac- tice, we keep Friedrich's points just outlined in the backdrop. We see to what extent Friedrich's conclusions about consciousness, empty ideality, and de-realization can be applied to Fei Ming; what was uniquely Chinese and Eastern in his response to the challenges in creating a modern poetry 1 For responses to Friedrich, see de Man 1983: 166-186; Culler 1988: 287- 290; Engel 1986: 1-8. 2 The most thorough study to date on the French influence is done by Jin Siyan (1997).

Eventually we move beyond Friedrich's rudimentary characterizations to assess the theoretical signifi- cance and implications of Fei Ming's aesthetic more or less in its own right. In so doing, I hope to deepen our understanding of some of the theoreti- cal issues regarding poetic representation and lyric modernity in the his- tory of modern Chinese poetry. Baihua Poetics from 1917 through the 1920s: A Background Modern Chinese poetry had a false start in the May Fourth movement and has never fully recovered. Poets of the May Fourth generation, Hu Shi in particular, launched the so-called Literary Revolution by advocating a po- etry understandable to all and by attempting to eliminate any distinction between poetry and prose (1998 d: 133-150). The famous "eight don'ts" in Hu's 1917 manifesto on baihua poetry focus on abolishing traditional po- etic diction and the discrepancy between poetic language and colloquial language (Hu 1998a# 1998b). For Hu Shi, as Michel Hockx (1994: 8) has pointed out, poetic form has the capacity to determine the nature of po- etic content. In other words, as long as a poem is written in baihua it is always better than one written in archaic language, and the poetic quality of a poem is proportionate to its proximity to the contemporary colloquial language. Hu Shi's own poetical practice as well as his remarks on tradi- tional poetry reveal that he finds little fault with the kind of poetic con- tent common especially in traditional ci poetry, whose language is closer to the colloquial. Indeed, he even included some of his own ci poems in his influential poetical collection, Experiments (Changshi ji). As an evolution- ist literary historian (Hu 1998c: 90-97), Hu Shi considered "new poetry" an inevitable next step in the evolution of literature after the flourishing of ci and qu poetry from the Song dynasty onward. In other words, for Hu Shi, poetic modernity was almost exclusively defined by genres based upon linguistic contemporariness, and a modern poetry was above all a poetry in the contemporary colloquial language. Poetic content meant little to 32 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="4">him. Whatever one writes in verse using baihua is intrinsically more poetic thanf say, Li Shangyin's (812-858) richly allusive poetry. As a poetics, Hu Shi's view of poetical history does not appear that revolutionary when we recall the historicist view on the development of traditional poetry ex- pounded by Ye Xie (1627-1703) in Tracing the Origin of Poetry (Yuan shi), which was very influential on Qing discussions of poetics.4 But this is of course not to say that its impact was not far-reaching. By insisting on mak- ing poetic language colloquial, Hu Shi reached beyond poetics proper and sought to remodel the Chinese language on the example of European phonetic languages. Hu's linguistically subversive and, one must say, po- etically naïve poetics succeeded in fatally undermining poetry in traditional form as a viable form of poetic expression. At the same time, it failed to provide an original solution to the problem of poetic modernity in the Chinese language. In many ways, Hu Shi's poetics may be regarded as part of the then predominant practice of attacking established institutions. As is more evident in social and political areas, the consequence of this radi- cal iconoclasm was more disruptive than constructive. But in an age when social Darwinism was held as the guiding principle of history, it is hardly surprising that Hu's evolutionist view of literary history and his phonocentrism caught the popular imagination. Hu Shi's vernacular poetics, however, was soon abandoned by some of its advocates, such as Zhou Zuoren (1927: 65-69), Yu Pingbo (1997), and Liu Bannong (1 935: 1 : 264), and was ridiculed and attacked by poets of the next generation, such as Mu Mutian and Wang Duqing (1926) in the mid- and late 1920s.5 Yet, although few after the May Fourth still subscribed to Hu Shi's poetics without reserve, his influence was more profound and tenacious than many realized. In a close parallel to political iconoclasm and its consequences, poets after Hu Shi scrambled to fill the institutional vacuum left by his baihua poetics. Most of them were preoccupied with the search for a modern genre, the poetic equivalent of political institu- tions. The use of baihua was indeed no longer regarded as the sole crite- 4 Ye Xie's disciple Shen Deqian, the editor of a series of very popular poetry anthologies arranged by dynasties. An Alternate Selection from Poetry in the Tang Dynasty (Tang shi biecai ji), An Alternate Selection from Poetry in the Song Dynasty (Song shi biecai ji), etc., was instrumental in disseminating Ye's views on poetics. For Ye's view of literary history, see the "Neipian shang" (The inner chapters, first part) of Yuan shi. 5 Mu Mutian once called Hu Shi the greatest evildoer in the New Poetry movement. See "On Poetry: A Letter to Guo Moruo" (Mu 1926: 86). Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 33</page><page sequence="5">rion for poetic modernity, but the belief in the capacity of poetic form to determine the nature of poetic content - a belief not intrinsically modern itself - became deeply rooted even in those who fiercely opposed Hu Shi's poetics. On the one hand, already in the mid-1 920s there were many dis- cussions over technical aspects of new poetry such as rhythm, rhyme, and other prosodie features (Guo 1926: 8-14; Wang Duqing 1926: 89-98) - a clear indication of the influence of Hu Shi's linguistic agenda - but little attention was paid to the question of what makes poetry modern and poetic other than these formal features. On the other hand, the recycling of clichéd imagery from traditional Chinese poetry and awkward use of exotic imagery, such as evening prayers ( wandao ) (Liang Zongdai 1925: 49-50), gothic castles (gu chengbao) (Feng 1 926: 74-75), and ark ( fangzhou ) (Mu 1987: 12-13), were on the rise. To many poets at that time, the latter practice alone seemed capable of evoking modernity, whereas the former was thought to instill poetic quality. But in fact, apart from these incon- gruous and self-defeating formal or ornamental features, there was little suggesting that many poets at the time came to embrace any kind of dis- tinctly modern poetics. For example, "In Scarlet Grayness" (Xinghong de hui'an li; 1926) by Mu Mutian, a harsh critic of Hu Shi and himself knowl- edgeable of contemporary French literature, can provide us with a speci- men of the kind of poetry prevalent in the second half of the 1920s as well as illustrate the poetics underlying it: In Scarlet Grayness Cannot suck up the wine glass of dry tears in scarlet color Cannot distinguish by taste in grayness the mute sadness 34 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="6">Ah, desolate tombs one by one in full view derelict - paper ashes Don't ask - passersby fallen flowers flowing water Look - Endless withered grass Seductive water margin Ah cannot drink up permanent toasting glass Ah scarlet - paper ashes - (Mu 1987: 60-61) The images in the poem are platitudinous when placed in the ci tradition. The poem reads like a pastiche of several extremely popular ci or qu po- ems of old: one thinks of Ma Zhiyuan's irregular song (sanqu) or some of the ci poems attributed to the Last Emperor of the Southern Tang (the phrase "fallen flowers / flowing water" [luohua / liushui] is a quotation from one of the most popular poems attributed to him). In addition, the nearly feminine rhyme in a diphthong /ei/ - the poet even reversed the normal sequence of the two characters in a common word bei'ai into ai'bei in order to rhyme and made up an adjective chenmei to create an asso- nance with the noun it modifies, shuimei - reinforces the sense of cliché. There is no irony in the use of these well-known lines and images from classical poetry; rather, Mu Mutian has produced kitsch without knowing it, and in the lack of irony showed an uncritical faith in the authenticity of reproducing such tired classical images in a modern context.6 6 The poem was written in Japan, but the scene in the poem is unmistakably Chinese. This makes the platitude of the images all the more problematic. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 35</page><page sequence="7">7 Sun Yushi (1999: 60) calls his theory of poetic unity "mystifying" (xuanxu). 8 See Liang Qichao 1959: 30. The greatest figure in the Poetic Revolution was Huang Zunxian (1848-1905). Hu Shi's advocacy of baihua as the sole criterion for new poetry may be regarded as a radical implementation of Huang Zunxian's famous slogan "my hand writes [what comes from] my mouth" (ivo shou xie wo kou ) (Huang 1979: 42). Intent on giving poetry a new look, Huang, along with Xia Zengyou, the originator of the Poetic Revolution, used many modern and Western loan words to write on contemporary subjects. However, his work was noted for its formal conservatism (Schmidt 1994: 49-53) and was faulted for its superficial understanding of Western ideas, for the ornamental use of Western terms, and for its lack of modern spirit (Qian 1984: 23-24). I have not chosen a particularly bad poem by a bad poet. The poem, a mere specimen of its kind, illustrates how emphasis on formal features such as musicality and suggestiveness of images covers up the poverty of poetic content and the lack of originality or modernity in much of the poetry at the time. The poem appears still more problematic if we remem- ber that it was Mu Mutian (1926) who first raised the issue of poetic unity in an open letter to Guo Moruo. But while maintaining that "poetry that has unity is a true sign of the inner life," the "unity" of his own poetic work written at the same time was often as problematic as the target of his criticism: it was based merely upon a mood that was neither developed nor ingeniously presented. Other than this platitudinous, often unbear- ably sentimental "mood," there is no other "inner" - to use Mu's word - unity. This poem lacks even syntactic unity because there are unjustified broken sentences. It is no wonder that in his discursive writings, Mu's no- tion of poetic unity, as one critic has pointed out, remains vague.7 Critics and literary historians are fond of talking about the innovativeness of Mu Mutian and his kindred spirits in advocating suggestiveness ( anshi ) and mistiness ( menglong ) as an antidote to Hu Shi's abolishment of the dis- tinction between poetic language and colloquial language, but as the pre- ceding poem shows, suggestiveness and mistiness are neither intrinsically poetic nor modern in the context of the Chinese poetical tradition. When Hu Shi undertook to revolutionize Chinese poetry, he was spurred by a sense of crisis: Chinese poetry, with its strict traditional forms and worn poetic diction (not to mention the rigid adherence to an archaic pronunciation system), was stagnant and moribund. This sense of crisis grew out of a profound dissatisfaction with traditional poetry that pre- dated Hu and had become apparent at least since what Liang Qichao hy- perbolically called the Poetic Revolution (shijie geming) in the last decades of the Qing.8 Up until the mid- and late 1920s, the sense of crisis Hu Shi had felt remained acute. Yet neither Hu nor the so-called Symbolists, of whom Mu Mutian is thought to be a major figure, provided any original 36 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="8">solution to the problems facing poetry in the Chinese language. It is against this historical background that I measure Fei Ming's poetic theory and practice. Fei Ming's Criticism of New Poetry In his lecture series on New Poetry delivered in the mid-1 930sf9 Fei Ming argued that the development of baihua poetry since the May Fourth was running into a dead end. Instead of trying to create and perfect a poetic diction in baihua and to invent a new metrical system, Fei Ming demanded a "poetic content" (shi de neirong) from baihua poetry: One day I wrote a poem in baihua, and was greatly enlightened. I discovered a borderline: if one must write new poetry, its con- tent must be poetic, whereas its diction must be that of prose. Poetry of old, regardless of whether it was shi or ci, all had the content of prose, whereas its diction was poetic. As long as we have this poetic content, we can write our new poetry free of all constraints. (1998: 21-22) This observation was made in the context of an examination of May Fourth poetry. Fei Ming's call for poetic content in fact pointed to the core of the problem in modern Chinese poetry: namely, what does modern poetry in Chinese mean other than the use of baihua ? If the definition of "new poetry" ( xinshi ) is that it is written in vernacular Chinese, how does it dis- tinguish itself as poetry? Hu Shi's argument, as summarized here, was that as long as a poem was plain enough and colloquial enough, it was modern and poetic. Fei Ming's call for a "poetic content" sought a poetic moder- nity more fundamental than poetry's most superficial formal aspects, such as the use of the vernacular or, as some later poets were wont to do, the adoption of some metrical system from European languages.10 What Fei Ming exactly meant by "poetic content," however, has not been adequately understood. Clues to the meaning of "poetic content" may be found in the lecture series, but a full understanding requires a 9 Fei Ming's first series of lectures on post-May Fourth poetry was delivered at Peking University in the mid-1 930s. Shen Qiwu, a fellow disciple of Zhou Zuoren, published them under the title Talks on New Poetry (Tan xinshi) in 1944 in Beijing without Fei Ming's knowledge. After the war. Fei Ming resumed the lectures at the University. The edition of the lectures used (Fei Ming 1998) includes both the 1930s and 1940s lectures. 10 For instance, Feng Zhi tried to emulate Rainer Maria Rilke's Die Sonette an Orpheus by writing "fourteen-lined" poems ( shisi hang shi). Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 37</page><page sequence="9">11 Wen Tingyun's year of birth is according to a recent study by Chen Shangjun (1997: 345-351). more circumstantial examination of Fei Ming's aesthetic ideas in his dis- cursive as well as creative writings. Within the lecture series itself, Fei Ming, well versed in classical poetry and ready to recognize the uninterruptible continuity of China's rich poetic tradition, discusses some of his favorite poets to illustrate his concept of poetic content. In a discussion of Wen Tingyun (801-870), 11 Fei Ming attributes the poetic quality of Wen's ci po- ems to "fantasy" ( huanxiang ): "Wen Tingyun's ci does not employ literary allusions ( diangu ); it gives a free rein to the poet's fantasy" (1998: 30). The poetic quality of Li Shangyin, another of his favorite late Tang poets, also derives from fantasy, although literary allusions are, in Li's case, a main poetic device. For Fei Ming, therefore, poetic quality has little to do with plainness of language and the directness of poetic expression, because Li Shangyin's poetry is notoriously difficult thanks to the extensive use of often esoteric allusions and recondite poetic conceits. Instead of formal features such as the use of allusions and vernacular language, Fei Ming emphasizes the "integral" (wanquan de), or complete, quality of poetic fantasy or imagination as that which makes a poem poetic. In his words: Wen Tingyun's ci cannot be said to have been written in the man- ner in which sentiments give rise to words and words to senti- ments ( qing sheng wen, wen sheng qing). His poetry is from an integral (wanquan de) imagination. In general all free represen- tation represents something integral. It is like the production of a sculpture. Before the sculptor starts, the artistic life of his work is already integral or complete. The creation of this life is a mysteri- ous beginning or, in other words, freedom. It is not a preparatory contemplation (yunniang ), it is a beginning. As soon as it is be- gun, it follows a necessity. This is different from floating clouds or flowing water, for floating clouds or flowing water get entangled wherever they are; whereas [poetic imagination] does not have this leisure (, ziyou ). Its lack of leisure is in fact due to the fact that it is a growth, which is free (ziyou). (1998: 25-26) To let one's sentiments give rise to words and words to sentiments is tan- 38 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="10">tamount to automatic writing, by which I mean a recording of unproc- essed sensory impressions or an emotional state as dictated, so to speak, by the unconscious. In fact, many early baihua poems look like automatic writing, although they were not written intentionally as such. Many poets at the time - not excepting Hu Shi, but Guo Moruo was indisputably the most representative - either took for granted or believed in such imme- diacy of subjective feelings as a hallmark of modern lyric poetry.12 In oppo- sition to the doctrine and the practice of spontaneity, Fei Ming through his reading of Wen Tingyun asserts the role of an active imagination. This active and operative imagination, according to him, is almost ipso facto integral. And being integral means - to borrow the term Coleridge coined from Greek and from the German word for "imagination" ( Einbildung ) - esemplastic, i.e., molding into one (1983: 168-170). It will not allow, for instance, the collage of withered grass and the season of late spring in one short poem (as Mu Mutian did in the poem previously cited) solely based on some mood. The concept of integrity or completeness of fantasy is indeed crucial to understanding Fei Ming's argument for poetic content. He expounded at length on this idea in the lecture series and used it as a major criterion for his criticism of modern poetry. It is a core idea sustained throughout the various phases in the development of his aesthetic. Although its par- ticular formulation as "integral" came about in the middle of his literary career, insofar as an approach to his entire aesthetic is concerned, it is in fact a kind of medias res that can evoke past developments and anticipate the future. For this reason, it serves as a good starting point for our examination. Fantasy and Dream: Fei Ming's Lay Conceptions of Imagination What Fei Ming says about the integrity of imagination or fantasy can be paraphrased as follows: a poem should not simply follow a descriptive or narrative sequence that is defined by real time, much less meander incon- 12 The Chinese word used as the equivalent to the European term "lyric" (Lyrik, poésie lyrique), shuqing, literarily to let flow feelings or emotions, is perhaps responsible to some extent for the narrow conception of modern lyric poetry among baihua poets. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 39</page><page sequence="11">gruously and aimlessly as dictated solely by some vaguely felt mood. To have a poem led by mood or the temporal sequence of things indicates a lack of poetic content. A poem thus written would either be a rather me- chanical description of sense experience or an indiscriminate effusion of subjective feelings, both of which were prevalent at the time. For Fei Ming, even descriptive passages in a poem have to be organized by the inner necessity of fantasy, not the natural temporal and spatial order of things. The integrity of fantasy means that the poem is not fragmentary, made of disconnected elements. Although a poem does not have to make explicit every part of the fantasy world, the fantasy to which the poem is but a métonymie reference should be an integral world in itself. In other words, the fantasy need not, and indeed cannot, be presented entirely in a poem, but its entirety should be latent behind the chosen images in the poem. A representation of this self-sufficient world cannot by definition be occa- sional, depending solely on the movement of the poeťs senses and the temporality it entails or on the mood swings of the poet. It must be deter- mined by the self-contained world and by its inner necessity. In the lecture series, Fei Ming describes Wen Tingyun's ci as being written "horizontally," not "vertically" (1998: 29). The point of the metaphor is precisely to char- acterize the spatial and the temporal totality of the poet's imagination. Fei Ming also uses the metaphor of growth for the same idea and con- trasts it with the movement of floating clouds or flowing water, which are aimless and accidental. Together with the notion of the horizontal, the metaphor of growth implies that a representation of the poeťs fantasy world is at the same time an exposition. As an exposition, the representa- tion of the fantasy world is determined by its internal logic just as the growth of a plant is determined by its encoded genetic plan; it does not have to follow empirical time, nor does it have to be determined by real spatial relations; and it observes an inner necessity, whose validity rests solely with the fantasy world. As such, it is "horizontal" because the fan- tasy world (or parts of it) can be revealed to us simultaneously. 40 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="12">More than the words "integral," "growth," and "horizontal," Fei Ming consistently uses the metaphor of dream for the world of poetic fantasy. For Fei Ming, if a poem is to have poetic content, it has to belong to the dream world. The notion of dream as an aesthetic concept underwent several stages in Fei Ming's literary and intellectual development. The term "dream as imagination" was first linked to Fei Ming by Zhou Zuoren in the latter's preface to Fei Ming's first collection of short stories, A Tale from a Bamboo Grove (Zhulin de gushi; 1925). In the preface, Zhou, who in his characteristically unobtrusive manner mentored Fei Ming throughout the 1920s, maintained that literature was not transcription of reality; instead, it was a dream (Zhou 1927: 56). Later in his own "Telling of Dreams" (Shuo meng) (Fei 2000b), an important essay that documented the early stage in the development of his dream theory, Fei Ming described the relation be- tween dream and the creative process as follows: "The act of writing should be a process of regurgitation. Only thus can it become a dream. Because it is a dream, it is separated from the original reality by a blurring border. Here is also where art succeeds" (55). When writing these words, Fei Ming was predominantly under the influence of European authors such as Baudelaire, Shakespeare, Georg Brandes, the well-known literary historian, as well as, though to a lesser extent, Japanese and Chinese interpreters of European authors and ideas. But the agenda presented in the article was Fei Ming's own. In particular, the emphasis on the process of "regurgitation" was directed at the rather naïve view on the relation between art and life and art and reality preva- lent at the time. Fei Ming felt the urgency to justify his own aesthetic pursuit against the predominant views that tended to abolish the distinc- tion between art and reality. The same views also demanded an imme- diacy of subjective feelings especially in lyric poetry and have resulted in some of the worst poetic excesses. Against this background, Fei Ming's notion of artistic imagination as dream is itself a pointed statement. It makes manifest that poetry is no mere transcription of either subjective or Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 41</page><page sequence="13">13 Baudelaire considers great works of art, such as those of Delacroix, to be transcription of dreams ("Si une exécution très nette est nécessaire, c'est pour que le langage du rêve soit très nettement traduit"). See Curiosités esthétiques (Baudelaire 1954:777). 14 The phrase first appeared in Lu Xun's "Taose de y un xu" (Preface to Eroshenko's Peach-colored Cloud) (Lu Xun 1973: 12: 520). In the mid-1930s. He Qifang borrowed the phrase "painting dreams" for his collection of prose poems Huamenglu (Painting dreams; 1936). He Qifang's debt to Fei Ming in terms of style and aesthetic has been pointed out by Li Jianwu in a review of He's collection (Li 1936: 189-205). objective reality; rather, it is, as Baudelaire has suggested,13 transcription of dreams. In "Telling of Dreams," dream possessed a higher truth than reality, but what dream meant remained vague. The next stage in the develop- ment of Fei Ming's aesthetic of dream saw an increasing attention to the inner mechanism of dream as imagination, thus offering greater clarity about the meaning of dream. Written three years after "Telling of Dreams," "Writing on Miscellaneous Topics" (Sui bi; 1930) is more revealing with regard to the meaning of the concept of dream: To raise it one level higher: distance must be maintained during writing, that is to say there is some Consciousness [English in origi- nal]. ... I admire a kind of fiction that "often follows nature and therefore does not promote things ahead of their due course" - what I have called Consciousness can perhaps be interpreted in this sense. Great talents are found in all ages, but such a one [i.e. one with such Consciousness] seems very rare. Those talents are all poets, they dream their dreams all their lives and show them to us. Yet this is not painting dreams ( hua meng), for to paint one's dream is to dream consciously. (2000b: 106-107) This passage contains several interesting points that later reappear, with some modification, in his lecture series on modern poetry. Most remark- ably, the phrase huameng, to paint one's dreams, which Fei Ming took over from Lu Xun and was to have considerable influence on a small circle of poets of the next generation,14 is a meaningful trope. In particular, when placed in comparison with the ideas suggested in "Telling of Dreams," the notion of huameng marks an important step forward: it led to the theory of fantasy and fantasy world as poetic content, which was formulated in the lecture series, and together with the notion of "consciousness" antici- pated his later recasting of the dream theory in the Buddhist terminology of the storehouse-consciousness. The trope of painting dreams provides us with the key to a better 42 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="14">understanding of the concepts proposed in the lecture series, such as "writ- ing poetry horizontally/' the "complete" or "integral" imagination, and work of art as "growth," for although in "Writing on Miscellaneous Top- ics" Fei Ming mainly uses Shakespeare to exemplify the working of imagi- nation, the rationale is one and the same. To illustrate his argument, the trope of painting dream for the creative process may be paraphrased as follows: both Shakespeare and Wen Tingyun can be said to be painters of their dreams because both represented their fantasy world "horizontally." In painting, time and space are configured on a flat surface and, insofar as it represents its subject simultaneously on a limited flat surface, it may be called horizontal. It presents a space evenly and simultaneously, thereby maximally reducing the temporal duration entailed in any spatial move- ment. In Wen Tingyun and Shakespeare alike, according to Fei Ming, dream has an extension and an imagined space very much like that found in paint- ing. The simultaneity and the spatiality of painting is the best equivalent to what Fei Ming would later call the integrity or completeness of fantasy. Shakespeare and Wen Tingyun can also be called painters of their dreams because they executed their painting consciously and conscientiously. They are not merely, to borrow Keats's lines, "a dreaming thing; / A fever of thyself," with the reader as an unintended onlooker; they deserve the title "painters of dreams" because they revealed their dreams with a con- scious, masterful control. Fei Ming's conception of poetry as painting of dreams touches on some fundamental issues related to modern poetry anywhere: time and space, descriptive and expressive, subjective and objective dimensions. With the trope of dream painting, Fei Ming has proposed an interesting solution to problems related to these issues in modern lyric poetry. Western classical theory on the relationship between plastic art and poetry, such as that expounded in G. E. Lessing's Laökoon, anchors on the different configura- tions of time and space in plastic art and in poetry. For Lessing, temporal sequence belongs to the field of the poet, and space to the field of painter Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 43</page><page sequence="15">15 Ogawa Toshiyasu (1998: 54-78) argues that Kuriyagawa Hakuson was the source of influence for Fei Ming's view of poetry as dream. Fei Ming certainly read the Chinese translation of Kuriyagawa's book - most probably the translation by Lu Xun (1973: 13: 17-149) - but his understanding of dream as imagination is markedly different from the psychoanalytical view found in Kuriyagawa. 16 "For the poet, a serene and observant sensibility is required, . . . he must not be attached to one object to any passion" (Novalis 1968: 412). (1974: 103). In a move contrary to Lessing, Fei Ming demanded that poetry should be as holistic in terms of time and space as plastic art. What makes this possible is "consciousness," the active agency of an integral or, after Coleridge, esemplastic imagination. It is incumbent upon the poet as much as upon the reader to exercise this consciousness in order to realize a poem as a work of art. For the creator and the reader alike, a poem is a dream as a product of the active agency of consciousness. In comparison to the implications of the trope of painting in space and temporality, Fei Ming's notion of consciousness as the agency of dream qua imagination is still more significant because it is the core concept of his poetic content and has the most to do with poetic modernity. In view of his further development, it also anticipates the Buddhist theory of store- house-consciousness (ãlayavijfíãna) that he later expounded. However, it should be pointed out here that Fei Ming's notion of consciousness has little in common with the psychoanalytical concept of the subconscious or the unconscious, which was introduced to China in the 1920s through Kuriyagawa Hakuson's influential book The Symbols of Anguish (Kumon no shõchõ).15 In fact, it is rather the very opposite because it emphasizes conscious control and a cool operation of poetic fantasy or dream. Histori- cally speaking, Fei Ming's idea of an active consciousness has more to do with Novalis's notion of cool maneuver ( kühle Besonnenheit or kühles Operieren) required for poetic imagination, which Hugo Friedrich (1979: 28-29) considers to be a Romantic theoretical precursor of the modern European poetics evinced in Baudelaire et al. For Novalis, the poetic cool maneuver is, on the one hand, compa- rable to magic and, on the other hand, as precise as mathematics.16 Ac- cording to Friedrich, it is this methodic operation of fantasy that charac- terizes modern European lyric poetry. It is true that Fei Ming apparently knew little about Novalis's poetics, but he owed a great deal of his poetics, above all the notion of dream, to Baudelaire, who was a kindred spirit of Novalis insofar as some of the essential principles of poetics are concerned.17 44 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="16">Because of the close link between Fei Ming's theory of dream and Baudelaire's, some paraphrase of the latter's notion of dream can help us understand Fei Ming's conception of the relationship between dream and consciousness. In this regard, the observations made by A. G. Lehmann on Baudelaire's notion of le rêve are as concise as they are pertinent to our discussion: "le rêve," equivalent to the significant experience in the crucible of the poet's art, is not the simple opposite of reality; it is the world in which the criteria of truth and falsehood are abolished; in which the poet is not bound by the rules of realistic composi- tion; in infusing it into art the poet produces an experience in which the work of art and the artist are fused into one (into one activity); in which the artist or spectator undergo experiences of heightened lucidity and sometimes terrifying exhilaration - which he ascribes to the beneficent effects of communion with a mysti- cal universe, a "puissance supérieure," or at least to une véritable grâce; in which are to be found all the most mysteriously power- ful turns of language and imagery, the profoundest plunges of "awareness." (Lehmann 1968: 85) For Baudelaire, dream is an intellectual and voluntary power. It is not an expression of the heart's desire, nor an effusion of emotions. It does not have the surrealist or psychoanalytical connotations behind automatic writing. "For dreaming (rêve) in Baudelaire," says Lehmann, "is not going to sleep and waiting to see what visions will favour us: it is staying awake and working hard: composing poetry. In his case a typical and favourite activity is the search for metaphor - not simply in words but in images. This is a matter - for him - of long practice; ... in his case the practice reaches the point where he can hardly leave off, where composition, play- ing with 'dreams,' becomes an obsession" (1968: 86). Like Novalis's cool maneuver, Baudelaire's notion of dream as artistic creation is about hard work and cool judgment. It aims at something as clear and precise as crys- tal, and it has a mathematic beauty. Although Fei Ming's own poetic world 17 Fei Ming owed his acquaintance with Baudelaire's work and aesthetic to Zhou Zuoren, who in the early 1920s translated several prose poems from Baudelaire's Le spleen de Paris and wrote a few articles introducing Baudelaire's aesthetic, emphasizing especially its opposition to realism. For translations from Le spleen de Paris, see Zhou Zuoren 1921. For an article on Baudelaire, see "Commemoration of Three Literary Figures" (Sange wenxuejia de jinian) (Zhou 1927: 23-26). Fei Ming chose one of Baudelaire's prose poems introduced to China by Zhou Zuoren, "Les fenêtres," as the epigraph to his first collection of short stories (Fei Ming 1925). Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 45</page><page sequence="17">18 Li Jianwu, a contemporary critic of Fei Ming, declared that Fei Ming was "inaccessible to a broader reading public" (Li 1936: 193). In his preface to Fei Ming's Life of Mr. Probable (Moxuyou xiansheng zhuan), Zhou Zuoren mentioned that a survey conducted among college students in Beijing around 1930 indicated that Fei Ming was the most recondite author in post-May Fourth literature (Zhou 1932: 120). 19 "Bref, un poème nous dit une chose et en signifie une autre" (Riffaterre 1983: 11); Riffaterre uses the term "obliquité" to characterize the poetic use of words vis-à-vis their conventional, semantic meanings (12 fñ. 20 Xu Dishan (1893-1941), the other major Buddhist writer after the May Fourth, was of course also an exception to the mainstream. In comparison to Fei Ming, who was more theoretically informed and interested, Xu concentrated more on the existential and experiential side of the religion in his work. is a far cry from Baudelaire's ghostly Paris as depicted in "Rêve parisien," his notion of consciousness qua dream as a formative, intellectual, and voluntary force closely resembles Baudelaire's concept of le rêve. Fei Ming's style also testifies to the similarity between the two in this regard. If for Baudelaire, as Lehmann has pointed out, the practical implication of le rêve is hard work and an obsessive search for the right words and images, Fei Ming, too, is a perfectionist when it comes to style. Fei Ming's obses- sion with words and images has made his work so difficult for average readers that he had the reputation of being the most recondite author in modern Chinese literature.18 The two main stylistic features of Fei Ming's work may be termed, after Michael Riffaterre, "oblique signification"19 and, after William Empson (1947: 45), "dramatic irony." Both require a very high level of the kind of consciousness Fei Ming attributed to Shakespeare and to Wen Tingyun. Thanks to the active agency of con- sciousness that is the poet's integral and esemplastic imagination, Fei Ming's lyric work, whether written in verse or in prose, has the obscurity and suggestiveness that Mu Mutian and many poets after him could only envy. Âlayavijhãnaã. A Buddhist View of Imagination and the Universe The notion of consciousness, when considered as a synonym of dreaming, is seminal to the development of Fei Ming's aesthetic toward a theory of immanence and transcendence in the 1930s. The immanent or transcen- dental dimension distinguishes Fei Ming from most other modern Chinese authors. In a move against the intellectual mainstream, Fei Ming sought and found the immanent and the transcendental dimension in a religion - Buddhism.20 Fei Ming came into contact with Buddhism around 1930. In the first half of the ensuing decade, his aesthetic became more and more imbued with concepts and images derived from Buddhist literature. Among them, the concepts of dream and consciousness remained central. During this period, some new tropes for poetry, such as the looking glass and flowers, deepened and enriched his poetics, yet essentially they are ampli- 46 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="18">fications of the central notions of dream and consciousness. Of Fei Ming's Buddhist notion of dream, as distinguished from his previous lay notion of dream, the following dictum uttered through the mouth of Cheng Xiaoling, the protagonist in Bridge (Qiao; 1932), Fei Ming's first novel, is a good summary: "I often observe my own thinking. It can be said to be very much like geometry, which brooks no vagueness and imprecision. I don't feel life to be as real as dreams, but I do feel the reality and the beauty of dream" (1932: 355). This aphoristic statement on dream and reality is a precise and concise summary of Fei Ming's Buddhist notion of dream. But a longer passage may help us see better what Fei Ming meant by these words. The same idea was rephrased in more detail more than ten years later in another novel, After Mr. Probable Rode an Airplane (Muoxuyou xiansheng zuo feiji yihou; 1947/1948), in which the hero equates life with dream on the same basis: He often says, to say "life is like a dream" is not to say life is as false as dream; rather, it is to say life is as real as dream. ... Be- cause the common notion of life is a physical one, when the physi- cal or the body has extinguished, it does not follow that the mind or the spirit is also no more; the existence of the mind or spirit is the same as the existence of dream: only dream does not have a body. Knowing the existence of the mind or spirit is to know the identity of life and death, and this identity is the mind. It follows that the rationale for life is the same as for death. But life as a fact differs from death as a fact, just as dream as a fact differs from being awake, but dream is still a fact. (1997b: 196-197) From these two passages, this much is clear: since the trope of painting dreams, Fei Ming has taken a more radical step in the development of his aesthetic of dream by equating dream with reality and even prizing dream over physical reality. Clearly, such a radical step has transcended aesthetics proper and has entered the realm of philosophy and religion. An under- standing of Fei Ming's notion of dream in this stage therefore requires Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 47</page><page sequence="19">21 It must be pointed out that for reasons elaborated here, the kind of Buddhism Fei Ming embraced was not Chan Buddhism. Luo Chengyan is wrong to attribute it to Fei Ming's work in a recent study (Luo 1992: 70- 81). Sun Yushi (1999: 260) also mistakenly assumes that Fei Ming's Buddhism was of the Chan School. 22 The work was written while Fei Ming was a war refugee in his country home in Hubei. It was accepted for publication after the war by the Chinese Association of Philosophy in 1947. But for various reasons - the change of the regime among others - the manuscripts were shelved. The work was finally published last year. 23 Vasubandhu (1998: 72): "Used in the sense of a specific entity, manas is an object-of-consciousness, within the store-consciousness [ãlayavijnãna], a consciousness always connected with confusion of self, the view of a self, pride of a self, love of self, etc." some doctrinal and philosophical background in the kind of Buddhism to which Fei Ming eventually converted.21 In the early 1940s, Fei Ming wrote an exposition of certain key con- cepts in Mahãyãna Buddhist philosophy, which was entitled On Álayavijñána (Alaiyeshi lun).22 As its title indicates, the exposition centers on the concept of ãlayavijhãna, or storehouse-consciousness, which origi- nally was an essential doctrine of the Idealistic School (Skt. Vijñánavádiir, Ch. Weishi zong) in Indian Buddhism. The school founded and represented by the brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu (perhaps 4th century a.d.) views the world and the self as a mental synthesis or "all ideation," with no ontological basis responsible for our perceptions of them (Ch'en 1 968: 77- 80; Schmehausen 1987: 1.1). According to traditional Buddhist philosophy prior to the Idealistic School, there are six faculties of mind called vijñánas, or consciousnesses, viz. five senses and a nonsensory faculty called manovijfíãna, the consciousness responsible for psychological activities such as wishes. The Yogãcãra School later added to the existing six another vijñána called manas, or the consciousness of self.23 Because the Vijñanavadin School claims the nonexistence of the external world needed to account for our perceptions or the first seven vijñánas, it is compelled to invent another agency to account for the ideas and impressions that exist in the mind itself. It does this by tracing, according to Kenneth K. S. Ch'en's paraphrase, the activity of the mind to a beginningless past, to the existence of an eternal repository from which can be drawn every possible idea or image. This repository is called the alayavijñána or the storehouse-consciousness, which is the storehouse of all the ideas and impressions experienced by mankind since the beginning of time. Everything in the universe may be found within it. It is com- mon to all individuals, it is the ocean of consciousness out of which all ideas arise and to which all ideas return. During his waking moments the individual is conscious of but a small fragment of this repository but by meditation he becomes aware of its pro- 48 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="20">fundity and depth. Every thought or deed performed by mankind since the beginning leaves behind a kind of spiritual energy or seed which is deposited in the storehouse. (1968: 78) The notion of the storehouse-consciousness is closely linked to the doctrine of seed (Skt. BTja ; Chin, zhongzi). The doctrine of seed arises from the need to account for intersubjectivity that might otherwise undermine an extreme idealism. Again in Kenneth K. S. Ch'en's words, One of the most vexing problems which the Vijñánavadins have to face is to explain why such external phenomena as mountains, lakes, rivers, and so forth appear alike to everyone who sees them. To explain such a phenomenon, the school admits the existence of universal seeds that reside in the repository of all beings. Out of these universal seeds evolve the ideas of the mountains, lakes, and so forth, and since they are universal and common to all be- ings, the resulting appearance of mountains and lakes are alike in all beings. Out of this immediately arises another question, what about the differences in the bodies and sense organs of each indi- vidual? The school explains that these differences are evolved out of non-universal seeds, or private seeds which exist in the store- house of that particular individual. Though the totality of phe- nomenal existence is one, still the facts of existence are mani- fested in limited individuals or streams of consciousness, who dif- fer in karma and degrees of ignorance, thus giving rise to non- universal or individual seeds. (1968: 78-79) The Mahäyäna Buddhist notion of seed is essentially a conception of mi- crocosm in which everything that grows out of it is already present in it in miniature. It is in this sense that álayavijñüna is meant as a storehouse- consciousness. The storehouse-consciousness is immanent in all the phe- nomena (dharmas) of the world. It resembles seeds just as the phenom- ena, being its realization, resemble fruits ( guo ). That álayavijñána is a store- house-consciousness does not mean that its only function is to store memory.24 Rather, it is a comprehensive storehouse that contains all that 24 Ch'en's suggestion that the seed may be likened to memory "in the widest sense" could be misleading (1968: 78). Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 49</page><page sequence="21">25 Cf. Schmithausen 1987: 1.3.4: "[Seed] is involved not only in the phenomena of memory and recollection but also in the preceding issues of karman and its fruition and of the reappearance of consciousness after periods of interruption, and it is involved even in the issue of the substratum of samsara and liberation, if samsara is understood as rebirth due to karman and to Defilements (klesa) liable to re-emerge even after periods of latency." 26 Schmithausen suggests that the theory of álayavijñana at least in its initial stage implies materialism and is distinct from the doctrine of vijfíaptimãtratã (All Ideation, or weishi). Schmithausen also believes that the doctrine of ãlayavijfíãna in Yogöcärabhümi (Chin, title, Yujiashi dilun, Tripitaka no. 1579, 30: 279-882, a work with which Fei Ming was very familiar) does not have significant relation to Mahäyäna. (1987: 2.13.7) The exact historical circumstances do not concern us here insofar as Fei Ming's reception of both the doctrine of ãlayavijfíãna and the doctrine of vijfíaptimã tra tã is concerned. 27 In fact, bian originally was a translation of several Sanskrit words. Besides nirmäna, bian was also used to translate parinãma, vikãra, vikrti, and so on. 28 Cf. Yuan Ce (613-696), Jie Shenmijing shu ( Exegesis to Samdhinirmocanasutra, chap. 5 on "san ming" (Skt. 7 Isro vidyãh). will come into being.25 Because of its comprehensiveness, ãlayavijfíãna is the basis for all the other vijfíãnas and indeed, the basis for every exist- ence. Because the world is nothing but our consciousness (i.e., all ideation), being a storehouse-consciousness implies that ãlayavijfíãna is the carrier of the seeds of all existent facts or events.26 In the previously quoted passage from Añer Mr. Probable Rode an Airplane, life as actualized ãlayavijfíãna is contrasted with dream, which is in fact a vision of ãlayavijfíãna. Both life and dream can be regarded as realizations of ãlayavijfíãna because both are its transformations. In Bud- dhism, the process of the appearance (phenomenon) of reality out of ãlayavijfíãna as the seed thereof is called transformation (Skt. nirmãna; Ch. bian27). In accordance with the different functions of the eight consciousnesses, this transformation can be divided into two kinds: (1) shengbian or zhuanbian, i.e., generative transformation, which refers to the fruition of the storehouse-consciousness (ãlayavijfíãna) as seeds into the phenomenal world; and (2 )yuanbian or bianxian, i.e., dependent trans- formation, which refers to the cognition of phenomena as object by the first seven consciousnesses. This classification reflects the dual nature of transformation as both an epistemologica! and an ontological process. To the extent that the awareness of this truth (Skt. tathãtã; Chin, zhenru) can affect an individual's existence, this duality entails two aspects crucial to the entire doctrine of Mahäyäna Buddhism. First, during his waking mo- ments, the individual is conscious of but a small fragment of the store- house-consciousness that is responsible for his very existence as well as for that of the world at large: ãlayavijfíãna is subliminal ( asamvidita ).28 Sec- ond, to the extent that one may become aware of the profundity and depth of the storehouse-consciousness, in other words, that one may at- tain the truth of one's own existence as well as that of the world, ãlayavijfíãna may become supraliminal instantly, namely, in the moment (Skt. ksana, Chin, cha'na) of epiphany. The dual states contained in the notion of ãlayavijfíãna are mutable. They can become exchanged when 50 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="22">certain conditions are met. In particular, the change or transformation from potentiality to actuality can take place instantly in a moment of epiphany, and the two states, namely life and dream as vision of ãlayavijfíãna, can thereby be bridged. When we apply this Buddhist notion of álayavijñána and its transfor- mation to that of dream versus reality in the passage from After Mr. Prob- able Rode an Airplane, it becomes clear that for Fei Ming, life is the out- come of the generative transformation of the storehouse-consciousness whereas dream is that of the conditional transformation. Inasmuch as both life and dream are outcomes of transformation, they are identical. Hence, Fei Ming's theory of dream, which originates in his reception of Baudelaire and Shakespeare, culminates in the Mahãyãna Buddhist doctrine of trans- formation (nirmãna).29 The Mirror and Painting an Empty Flower: The Dialectics of Representational lllusoriness and Reality That both the phenomenal world and dream are representational gives rise to the notion of emptiness or vacuity ( kong ). Because all is ideation without any reality in the conventional sense of the word, all is empty (kong). Originally, the term kong meant the inanimateness and ^substan- tiality of representational images as opposed to the animated and sub- stantial ones in the real world.30 Dream images can be said to be empty on account of their lack of substantiality. But because for Fei Ming the world is considered representational of theálayavijñána in the same way as dream is of "reality," phenomena in the world can also be called empty. The view of representation as being empty in turn gives rise to the notion huan, illusion or phantasma. If the world as we perceive it is empty or insubstan- tial, it is an illusion (huan). And if the world is an illusion or phantasma, it follows that an artistic representation of the world is an illusion of illu- sions or a phantasma of phantasmata. Aesthetically speaking, it is this notion of illusion of illusions or multiple representations that underlies Fei 29 Fei Ming's view of artistic representation and the world at large as transformation coincides with the Tang concept of bian as in the bianwen (transformation texts) found in the caves of Dunhuang. The concept of bian in bianwen, of course, also derives from Indian Buddhism (for the Tang concepts of bian and bianwen, see Mair 1989: 43-72). But there is no evidence for a possible influence from the Tang transformation texts on Fei Ming. 30 This original meaning is not foreign to the Western tradition. In The Aeneid, Vergil used the word "inane" in the same sense to describe the frescos depicting the fall of Troy as against Aeneas's personal experience of it: "animum pictura pascit inani" ( Aeneid 1.464). Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 51</page><page sequence="23">31 Fei Ming's poetic conceit of multiple reflections influenced later poets, most notably Bian Zhilin, who became a friend in the 1930s and 1940s. In Bian Zhilin's well-known "Duan zhang" (A fragment) and in his "Jiu Yuanye xiasi" (Thoughts in the night of the fifteenth of the first month in old calendar). Fei Ming's influence in this regard is evident. 32 The fate of Fei Ming's poetry is complicated. Until very recently, his only poetry known to the general public and scholars alike was a very limited number of short poems published sporadically over half a century, including ballads he wrote in the 1950s and early 1960s praising the Communist Party and Mao Zedong. Most of his pre-1949 poems are dated either 1930/1931 (e.g., "Jing" [Mirror], "Zhuangtai" [A dressing table]) or between 1935 and 1937 (e.g., "Yuzhou de yishang" [The mantle of the universe]; "Xiyue shi mei" [Joy is beauty]). Their content indicates a great coherence, suggesting a cyclelike series. In 1943, Sheng Qiwu, a friend of Fei Ming and a fellow disciple of Zhou Zuoren who later disowned him under complicated circumstances, published a small essay written by Fei Ming more than Ming's works of the early 1930s.31 Seminal traces of the idea of multiple representations can be found in his works before 1930. For example, Fei Ming wrote in 1927 that reading Shakespeare was like dreaming dreams (meng meng) (2000 Ь: 56). In Book One of Bridge, written in the late 1920s, we see emblematic imagery sug- gesting this multiple mediating process in the episode in which Cheng Xiaolin looks at the pupil in Qinzi's eye (1932: 40-41). But Fei Ming be- came obsessed with the idea of multiple representations only after 1930. For example, the emblematic images suggesting multiple representations increase in number and importance in Book Two of the novel (1932: 231, 371). Indeed, the 1932 edition of Bridge ends with such a multiplication of representational media: Cheng Xiaolin has a dream in which he, his fiancée, Qinzi, and her cousin Xizhu are floating in a boat on a lake; in the dream, he contemplates the image of Xizhu alone on the boat "as if in the middle of the water." The lake functions as a kind of looking glass in which he believes he sees Xizhu more clearly than he would in person. The images of multiple reflections derive from well-established meta- phors in Buddhist scriptures employed to describe the unreality of the world. Of the eight conventional metaphors mentioned in Asanga's Mahãyãnasangraha (Tripitaka 31: 102, 120, 140) and Dhamapala's Vijfíãptimãtratasiddhi (31: 46), i.e., illusions, flames, dreams, images in the mirror, shadows, echoes in the valley, the moon reflected in water, and metamorphosis, at least three - illusions, dreams, and images in the mir- ror - appear frequently in Fei Ming's work written after he began to be interested in Buddhism. If the dream metaphor was more prominent in his works before 1 930 (though they were not yet explicitly Buddhist), the most remarkable metaphor that appeared in his works after 1930 was the mir- ror. In fact, a recently discovered collection of poetry is so entitled: The Mirror (Jing).32 In this still unpublished collection, the images of multiple reflections and representations, such as lakes, creeks, the sea, the mirror, painting or drawing, and dream, abound. The title poem, "The Mirror," 52 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="24">contains some of these motifs. The second half of the poem reads as fol- lows: Since I found a good looking-glass in my dream, I know now that I have a fearless spirit, I smile for not being able to present it to the maiden, And often behold her purity in it. (Mss.; Fei Ming 1985: 294) The stanza demonstrates two essential aspects of the entire work as well as of the poeťs Buddhist aesthetic in the early 1930s. On the one hand, the mirror found in a dream is clearly an instance of the multiple reflec- tions employed as a metaphor for the unreality of the world. On the other hand, the stanza also reveals a thematic obsession that underlies not only The Mirror but also Fei Ming's overall aesthetic in the 1930s: a girl who dies young. It is the leitmotif of The Mirror as well as of Bridge and Life of Mr. Probable. But this obsession also reaches beyond these three works. From "Little Sister" (A mei), written in 1924 and published in his first col- lection of short stories, to the acclaimed "The Peach Orchard" (Taoyuan), written in 1927, death of the maiden as a theme occupies a prominent place. What has changed over time is the trope with which the theme was conceived and presented. As already demonstrated, Fei Ming's aesthetic before 1930 can be characterized as a lay aesthetic of dream, whereas his aesthetic after 1930 can be emblematically summarized in the Buddhist image of the mirror, which eventually developed into the Mahãyãna Bud- dhist notion of ãlayavijhãna. The transition of Fei Ming's aesthetic from dream to the mirror as a symbol for the Buddhist notion of ãlayavijhãna in fact reflects his search for an aesthetic justification for representing the experience of the death of the maiden. From the scanty information concerning his life that is available, we know that there might be some biographical basis for Fei Ming's obses- sion with the theme: he, like the first-person protagonist in "Little Sister," also lost a little sister when he was a child. But the greater significance of ten years earlier. The essay was written apparently as a preface to a poetry collection by Fei Ming (2000b: 223-224). In this essay, written in 1931, Fei Ming says that he completed The Celestial Steed (Tianma), a poetry collection comprising more than eighty poems, in March and then in May wrote another forty poems, which he collected under the title The Mirror. In the essay, he also indicates that he combined the two collections into one for publication. Shen Qiwu, who published the essay in a journal, Feng yu tan (Talks in the wind and rain), in 1943, says in an attached note that Fei Ming wrote a total of 120 poems in 1931. It is not clear whether Shen had more information for this statement than what Fei had given in the essay. In any case, the two poetry collections. The Celestial Steed and The Mirror, which were never published as planned, disappeared and until very recently, few had even heard of their existence. Three years ago, The Mirror was unexpectedly found in Zhou Zuoren's estate. Unfortunately, there is still no trace of The Celestial Steed, the first collection of some eighty poems finished in March, 1931. The Mirror consists of forty poems, a number consistent with that mentioned in the 1931 essay. The first poem was composed on April 15, 1931 and the last was finished on May 18. On the cover page of the manuscript found in Zhou Zuoren's estate is a dedication to Zhou Zuoren, dated May 20, 1931, as well as a subtitle that says this is the second collection by the poet. There is no preface or afterward attached to the work. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 53</page><page sequence="25">33 The two stories are Suzuki Miekochi's "Kingyo" (Goldfish) and Kato Takeo's "Kyushu" (Home- sickness), the latter of which is the story about the death of a child (Zhou 1923). the theme lies beyond biography. In "Telling of Dreams," Fei Ming (2000b: 52) acknowledges Japanese influences in his early years, particularly the short stories introduced to China by Zhou Zuoren. One of the two Japa- nese stories he mentioned in the 1 927 article is about the death of a child, and it shows clear influences, via Japan, of the European decadents at the turn of the century.33 "Little Sister," his first piece on the theme and the most realistic, testifies to the naturalistic and decadent influences from Europe via Japan. "The Peach Orchard," his second work on the theme and arguably his best short story, owes a great deal to Sologub (pen name of Fyodor Kuzmich Teternikov; 1863-1927), the Russian Symbolist. Far from being a mere imitation of the Russian work, "The Peach Orchard" has so succeeded in rendering the death of a maiden "beautiful" that it may be regarded as a decadent masterpiece by any standard. By 1930, however, Fei Ming had outgrown his decadent phase and found a new aesthetic for the theme of the death of the maiden. Gone was the obsession with death in "Little Sister" and "The Peach Orchard;" what came in its stead was a search for a transcendence of death. Fei Ming's thematic as well as aes- thetic agenda around 1930 was to restore to life through artistic represen- tation what had been undone by death. In essence, for the poet Fei Ming after 1930, artistic representation - ultimately symbolized by the mirror - is a substitute for the originary presence of the dead maiden. The figure of the maiden therefore may be viewed figuratively. It transcends bio- graphical truth and becomes a symbol for what is lost to time and indeed for temporality itself. In Fei Ming's work after 1930, the theme of the lost maiden is accen- tuated especially in the image of "empty flower" (kong hua). The image dominates The Mirror and Life of Mr. Probable. Like the mirror, the image of "empty flower" is also derived from Buddhist scriptures. In Dhamapäla's Vijfíãptimãtratasiddhi, a well-known compendium of Vijfíãnavãdin phi- losophy, the metaphor of empty flowers is used to describe the unreal nature of the world within temporality: "The past and the future worlds 54 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="26">are neither present nor constant, they should resemble empty flowers which have no reality" ( You qu lai shi fei xian fei chang, ying si konghua fei you shixing) (Tripitaka 31: 6). In Vijñáptimátratasiddhi, the empty flower is a metaphor for all phenomena in the world; whereas in Fei Ming's use of the image, "flower" is concretized in the maiden who is no more and must be re-presented. What is particularly interesting with regard to aes- thetic theory in his use of the image is that he combines it with his earlier trope of painting dreams and develops a new trope of painting an empty flower. In Life of Mr. Probable, published in the same year as The Mirror was written, there are passages that best illustrate this new trope. Upon hearing of the death of the niece of his landlady, Mr. Probable contem- plates the event as follows: Today, today, she, she, she, the beautiful girl; as if I had painted a picture; it is my favorite work; it makes me ecstatic, makes me lonely, makes me learn about myself, makes me contemplate the universe. There is nothing in this universe, it is only aggregation and arrangement of pigments (yanliao ). The corruption of time is a matter of course, yet it is no more than variations of the pig- ments, everything, everything. If you do not see the reality in these words, it is that you cannot see really and keenly, it is because your life is superficial! Ha, ha, from now on I shall paint an empty flower (konghua), and my life will be meaningful. Of hundreds and thousands of flowers only this one is truly meaningful. (1997a: 125) The empty flower the hero vows to paint is a representational substitute for the originary presence of the girl. Such a representational substitute, like the specular images found in Bridge and The Mirror, is the verbal trace she left behind thanks to Mr. Probable, who is a writer. In the same chap- ter, Mr. Probable further elaborates on the trope of the empty flower: having visited the banks of life and death to and fro in a full cycle, she left nothing behind, then she had to use words as her traces. She? She? She? I had one chance meeting with her and Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 55</page><page sequence="27">34 The poem is also entitled "Dian deng" (Lighting a lamp). See Fei Ming 1985: 296. then she was lost? How to formulate this sentence? For though I at any rate cannot see how the Creator will create a flower of tomorrow out of it, I am truly unable to write a complete life, a beautiful girl, out of bright eyes of yesterday. (125) In comparison to the trope of painting dreams discussed earlier, the paint- ing of the empty flower accentuates even more the insubstantiality of representation. But instead of admitting the impotence (Vergil's inanis) of representation vis-à-vis the originary presence, Fei Ming, adverting to the doctrine of ãíayavijhãna, maintains that the world at large is nothing but a painting with its phenomena being aggregates and combinations of dif- ferent pigments. The world is likened to painting because both are specu- lar representations. In "The Wall" (Bi) from The Mirror, the poet says that he "hangs up a mirror as if hanging up a painting."34 The representational nature of both the world at large and painting makes Mr. Probable an- nounce toward the end of the novel: "There is nothing in this universe, it is only aggregation and arrangement of pigments (yanliao). The corrup- tion of time is a matter of course, yet it is no more than variations of the pigments, everything, everything" (1 25). This is a thoroughly idealistic state- ment about dream painting as well as about the world at large as repre- sentation. But despite its cosmological dimension, it is still primarily a state- ment on aesthetics, indeed a summation of Fei Ming's aesthetic pursuit over the past decade. The next decade saw Fei Ming's incremental immersion in Buddhist philosophy and a gradual diversion of interest from aesthetics proper. Around 1940, Fei Ming finally graduated, so to speak, from his study of Buddhist scriptures and reformulated his idealistic view in OnÃlayavijfíãna by openly invoking the doctrine of ãlayavijfíãna. The following statement from the booklet is primarily about cosmology and its aesthetic implica- tions, although still perceivable, become secondary: 56 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="28">In brief, the world is an art of illusion (huanshu); the artist is intel- lect ( Uzhi ). There is nothing and there is everything. This is what is meant by the words "phenomena (se) are empty, empty are phe- nomena, so are all the sensations, thoughts, actions, and cogni- tion." I cherish most the following words in the sutras: "like illu- sionist who creates all kinds of delusions!" (54) Still, a close correspondence can be established between this statement and the one made nearly a decade earlier in Life of Mr. Probable : the world is a thaumaturge's work of art just as painting is an artist's. That the phenomenal world is likened to a painting made of pigments is indicated also through a hidden pun. The word se, a translation of the Sanskrit word rüpä meaning "phenomena," means color or pigment in a non-Buddhist context. In the passage from Life of Mr. Probable, the term yanliao, or pigments, in Mr. Probable's contemplation that the universe is nothing but "aggregation and arrangement of pigments," refers implicitly to the word se as a pun on color and rüpä. To say that the universe is made of "aggregation and arrangement of pigments" is therefore to say that the world is an illusion (huan), i.e., mere appearances - se or rüpä. Hence, to say that the world is merely "an aggregation and arrangement of pig- ments" is to say that the world is phenomenal or representational in the sense of being the generative transformation ( nirmãna ) of the álayavijñána. A poet, then, is a painter who uses the illusory phenomena in the world as pigments to paint his dreams. And the dreams, if they are to be integral, have to be visions of the primal consciousness (álayavijñüna) that is responsible for the coming into being of the universe. Artistic creation is an analogue of the ontological process that is the transformation ( nirmãna ) or representation of álayavijñána. In the small poem "Autumnal Water" (Qiu shui) from The Mirror, the intricate relationship between poetry as painting and the analogous ontological process are presented in a nut- shell: Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 57</page><page sequence="29">I see that red dot, And think of the pigment. It paints a life from I know not where? I think of that autumnal water, too, I question how it can brighten the shadow of her hair? (Mss.) The lost life (of a girl) can be reconstructed out of pigments, which are as real as the reflection of her figure ("her hair") in the autumnal water. Poetry brings back the lost originary presence just as the creator of the world brings forth its creation as part of metempsychosis, or samsãra. Yet re-presentation in both cases is essentially illusory and empty. To Fei Ming, however, the truth in representation must needs lie in its illusoriness and emptiness. It is a dialectics of representation, and dialectics as a mode of thinking, conceit, and argument characterizes Fei Ming's philosophic as well as creative and aesthetic writings after 1930. It marks the acme of his theoretical career. A poem written in 1937, "Joy Is Beauty" (Xiyue shi mei), summarizes this dialectics most succinctly: Light in a dream I know to be false, For it is not good. I struggle to open my eyes And see the sunbeam. I am glad this is real Because I know it is false, Joy is beauty. (1985: 309) It is through this dialectics of truth and falsehood in representation that temporality is overcome. The Theoretical Significance of Fei Ming's Aesthetic of Representation: A Conclusion Jacques Derrida, paraphrasing Hegel, calls representation "differentiation." And differentiation, according to Derrida, leads to a chain of imprints 58 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="30">(i chaîne graphique) - visual or tactile (i.e., spatial) - that eventually adapts itself in a linear manner into a phonetic chain, which is temporal (Derrida 1967: 96). Fei Ming's aesthetic is dominated by the issue of representation. Influenced by Buddhism, he later expanded the poetics of painting dreams into an ontological and cosmological scheme. But either as poetics or as ontology, representation for him is the modus operandi. The view of the world as representation, as was the case with Schopenhauer ("die Welt," says he, "ist eine Vorstellung") who was much indebted to Indian philoso- phy and with Wang Guowei who was a faithful of the German philoso- pher,35 is pessimistic, and Fei Ming himself was ready to admit and to de- fend it as such (2000 b: 190-191). There is, therefore, a pathos in his poetics and ontology. It comes from a desire for the recovery of that which is lost. The figure of the maiden, which appears in various guises in most of Fei Ming's works, is, regardless of its biographical origin, an allegory for what Derrida would call passé absolu. For Fei Ming, as for many before him, such as Cao Xueqin or Proust, the only way to resolve this pathos is through representation. But contrary to Derrida's analysis of phonocentric systems that concludes in an impossibility of reanimating the occurrence of an originary presence and consequently concludes in the irretrievability of the passé absolu (Derrida 1967: 97), Fei Ming's Eastern notion of specular reflection argues for the possibility of a sublation of temporality through representation. His argument relies on two premises. First, he conceives poetry primarily in terms of painting and other pictorial arts, not, as in Derrida's tradition, in terms of phonetic utterances. The atom of his poetic universe is not Saussure's phonème but the painter's pigment. Second, for Fei not only are painting and writing representational, so is the world at large. Hence, not do only painted images and written words result from the differentiation from the originary presence, the world too derives from an origin that exists a priori. The equation of the world and artistic repre- sentation on the basis of their common derivative nature already under- mines the assumption that artistic representation is eternally a posteriori 35 Though he never acknowledged it. Fei Ming's Buddhism as well as some of his ideas concerning poetics seem to have been influenced by Wang Guowei, the great conservative thinker and philosophical pessimist in modern Chinese intellectual history. For example. Fei Ming's discussion of "ge" (separated by a veil) as a definitive quality for sanwen as against poetry, which should not be veiled С bu ge) (2000b: 149-159), obviously derived from Wang Guowei's first use of the term in Renjian cihua (Talks on ci in the human world) (Wang Guowei 1982: 210-211). For an interpretation of Wang Guowei's notion of bu ge, see Rickett 1977: 28-31). This connection is most likely also because it was Yu Pingbo who acted as an editor for Renjian cihua when it was first published as a book in 1926 and because Yu was Fei Ming's close literary friend in the 1920s and 30s. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 59</page><page sequence="31">because of its being the trace of the originary presence. Fei Ming's concep- tion of the mode of representation further weakens the temporal differ- entiation between the two. For his conception of the mode of representa- tion is not mimetic, which would have to entail a linear temporality, a chain of differentiation from the origin. In his fascination with the use of allusions as a major device for oblique signification (he was particularly fond of Yu Xin and Li Shangyin for this reason), Fei Ming demonstrates a penchant for metonymy as the central means of poetic representation. His notion of the completeness of imagination is predicated on metonymy. His later conversion to Buddhism only elevated this idea to a cosmic level. For him, the relationship between the world as representation and its ori- gin, ãlayavijfíãna, is also métonymie. With Fei Ming, therefore, represen- tation is not, as Derrida observes in the Western context, structured in the fashion of a chain of differentiation (enchaînement de différence); rather, it is through a métonymie and thaumaturgie conjuration. A work of art, like the world itself, is a magic show conjured up by a thaumaturge. The thaumaturge's show comes in no time. As Fei Ming depicts it in Bridge (1932: 301), the epiphanic moment, called cha'na in Chinese after the San- skrit word ksana, sublates temporality by bringing together past, present, and future in a single moment. For Fei Ming, the world as métonymie and thaumaturgie realization of ãlayavijhãna - and by implication, a work of art as a métonymie refer- ence to the integral imagination or dream - is ahistorical. It unfolds itself not linearly but cyclically (or horizontally insofar as a work of art is con- cerned). Indeed, Fei Ming was adamant in his opposition to evolution- ism - the quintessential^ modern doctrine of linear temporality as a pat- tern for history. On Álayavijñána was written as a polemic against the evolutionism he found in Xiong Shili's ambitious book A New Exposition on All Ideation (Xin weishi lun) (Fei Ming 1997b: 358-362). Instead of a linear temporality and a teleological history epitomized in the evolution- ist gospel of progress, Fei Ming professed a belief in samsãra or 60 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="32">metempsychosis (2000a: 41). In the scheme of metempsychosis, time is relativized. There would be no passé absolu because what was may be# through representation, once or many times again. Fei Ming's poetic agenda and cosmology were highly unique in the literary and intellectual history of modern China. In many ways, he was an aberration from rather than a specimen of that history. In his stubborn opposition to the dominant notions of modernity in poetry and beyond, he offered an alternative that needs to be taken seriously. Through his criticism of the prevalent preoccupation with poetic form and in his con- ception of poetic representation in terms of pictorial art, he in fact de- fended the grammocentrism of the ideographic East against the encroach- ment of the phonocentrism of the alphabetic West. In doing so he demon- strated a sharp artistic insight and a high caliber of intellectual power. His criticism of prevalent concepts of poetic modernity, such as his oppositions to the creation of a baihua poetic diction and a new prosody, to mimesis and unmediated effusion of subjective feelings as the mode of represen- tation in fiction and in lyric poetry, and to literary engagement, his attack on evolutionism, and so on, like, say, Nietzsche's or Thomas Mann's in their own historical and intellectual contexts, sheds more light on the problems inherent in those concepts than their uncritical advocates ever admitted to. His exploration of the immanent and transcendental experience chal- lenges some of the most fundamental assumptions about modern Chinese literature and modern Chinese intellectual history. Through the issue of representation, he demonstrated a theoretical sophistication rarely equaled in the history of modern Chinese literature. To be sure, his Buddhist aes- thetic to a great extent coincides with that which is implied in the medi- eval Chinese - mostly Tang - Buddhist notion of bian. But he, unaware of the Tang precedent, not only revived the notion quite single-handedly after centuries of oblivion and incomprehension, but also added to it greater theoretical sophistication and a definitively modern relevance. His position and arguments on the issue of representation, with their back- Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 61</page><page sequence="33">ground in Buddhism and classical Chinese poetry, can enrich our under- standing of some fundamental aesthetic and poetic issues from a perspec- tive distinctly Chinese. His criticism of post-May Fourth poetry brought us great insights into problems of poetic modernity that still confuse and plague poets in China today. Finally, for all that has been said about his Baudelairean heritage, his reexamination of classical Chinese poetry, and his immersion in a transcendentalism in the form of Buddhism that is char- acterized not with anthropomorphic theism but with an empty ideality, it should be evident that Fei Ming's ideas on poetics agree well with Hugo Friedrich's characterization of modern European lyric poetry. This is in all likelihood more than just a coincidence, and it by no means contradicts his conservative and reactionary stance in matters related to history, ideol- ogy, and philosophy as seen in many of his writings. The social and politi- cal implications of his aesthetic and philosophy may indeed be very con- servative, or even reactionary, yet as in the cases of the most prominent Western modernist poets such as Rilke, Yeats, Pound, T. S. Eliot, and many others, it does not prevent his poetics and poetry from being distinctly modern. In fact, it may be the very foundation for such a modern poetry and poetics. A careful examination of the complex issues surrounding the poetics of this long ignored and little understood figure, which this paper has probed, can only contribute to the ongoing reexamination of the most fundamental premises in the discussion of the problem of modernity in modern Chinese literary and intellectual history. 62 • Fei Ming's Poetics of Representation</page><page sequence="34">Poems in Chinese: Mu Mutian ШШФ тъ&amp;т ышш про! min ìiSIS/Ж - Ш.Ы *яга - Í7À ШЁ /ттК Ш - штмтш шшя m ШШ7 ИЙЯ - ШК - (Mu 1987: 60-1) Fei Ming îl (excerpt) Й^ЙЛИЯЙЯИ^-МЛШЙ«».
