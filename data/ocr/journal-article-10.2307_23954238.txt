<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND STUDIES THE BRANCH TO THE NOSE Amongst the many strange cults mentioned in the Old Testament, not the least puzzling is that referred to in Ezekiel's phrase (viii. 17) 'they put the branch (zemora) to their nose'. The ancient versions1 show no sign of having understood the full cultic significance of the phrase but indicate that the sense of the Hebrew underlying these translations did not differ significantly from the sense of the present massoretic text. This has not deterred some scholars from disposing of the difficulty by emendation. R. Gordis, in a discussion of this passage,2 lists, and rejects, a number of such emendations. He does not, however, accept the existing mas soretic text as original, and points out that there is a widespread rabbinic tradition that the Massoretes actually altered the text of the passage : he argues that, in view of the general opposition to change, this tradition should be accepted and the original text taken as 'appt. He then trans lates the supposed original phrase as 'they send the branch into My nose', interpreting this as a metaphor meaning 'they harass and irritate Me'. The original text was, according to Gordis, changed because the crude anthropomorphism with reference to God was found offensive by the Massoretes. To many, Gordis's solution, involving the invention of an idiom which would be a hapax legomenon in Hebrew, is likely to commend itself as little as the emendations he rightly rejects. Furthermore, Gordis's interpretation does not do justice to the fact that the early versions, despite their widely different interpretations, are unanimous in the implication that 'nose' belongs to the subject of the preceding verb and not to God speaking in the first person. There is the further difficulty that the supposed anthropomorphism with reference to God would be grosser than anything even in the J source and unparalleled in its crudity in a prophetic work of the sixth century. Gordis's strong case for accepting rabbinic tradition of a change in the consonantal text must be accepted. His argument proves, however, not that the original reading was 'appi 'my nose', but that it was a word which could be read as the offensive form 1BN 'my nose'. Other instances show that forms corresponding to ,DX, consonantally identical with but morphologically distinct from a noun with I s.c. pronominal suffix, 1 For a summary of the sense of the ancient versions see G. A. Cooke, Ezekiel (I.C.C.), p. 103. 2 J-T.S. xxxvii (1936), pp. 284-8.

In Hebrew, as in many other languages, pronominal possession is frequently not denoted in words for parts of the body, if such a word is the direct or indirect object of a verb of which the subject is the person to whom the part of the body belongs. Thus, assuming with Gordis an original ,BS, it is still possible to translate the phrase as 'they put the branch to the(ir) nostrils (or face)'. If this be accepted, it becomes clear that the con sonantal change attested in rabbinic tradition did not affect the tradi tional sense of the passage but was made to avoid the danger of ""SK being, at a time when Hebrew had almost ceased to exist as a living tongue, misread as "'Dit 'my nose', with reference to God. In support of his interpretation Gordis argues that 'the position of the clause makes it impossible to interpret it as a reference to a specific rite in any cult. ... In its actual position ... it must bear a general meaning or the context is utterly destroyed.'2 An examination of the structure of the passage viii. 6-17 appears to invalidate this contention, since a definite pattern, of which verse 17 is a part, seems to underlie these verses. The passage may be divided into four sections and analysed as follows : 6-1ι 12-14 15-16 iy 6a 12a 15a 17a Question by God: 'Do you see . . .?' 6b 126-13 *56 τ7^ Comment by God about abomina tions. 7-9 14a 16a — Positioning of Ezekiel. 10-11 146 16c 17c 'Behold!'and fresh spectacle. Except for two points, verse 17 has the same pattern as the three other passages. The two points are, the absence of any reference to a re stationing of Ezekiel, and the use of 01Π instead of ΓΠΠ. Neither point, nor the two together, seems to be sufficient to divorce verse 17 from verses 6-16: a very simple explanation of these two slight differences could be that Ezekiel was not restationed and that the suffix of DID there fore related to the particular idolators last referred to. Such an explana tion would imply—as has generally been assumed—that the 'branch' rite was a part of the cult of the men who 'worshipped the sun towards the east'. Amongst those who have accepted the massoretic text as both original and meaningful two main lines of explanation have been followed, with 1 Gesenius-Kautzsch-Cowley, Hebrew Grammar, § 87/; G. R. Driver, Pro-, blems of the Hebrew Verbal System, p. 101. 2 Op. cit., pp. 284 f.</page><page sequence="3">320 NOTES AND STUDIES numerous variations in detail. On the one hand, there have been those who see the practice as an unexplained part of a Babylonian or Sumerian cult,1 and, on the other, those who relate it to the later Zoroastrian barsom,2· which, it may be noted, has not itself been adequately explained. The passage not only raises problems of comparative religion but also im pinges upon Higher Criticism, for if it could be shown that the worship described was an imitation in Jerusalem of a Zoroastrian rite, the date of the passage could no longer be accepted as the early sixth century B.c.3 There are two distinct aspects of the rite referred to in Ezek. viii. 17, (i) the use of the branch, and (ii) the holding of something to the nose. Fertility cults are widely attested in Sumerian, and to a lesser extent in Babylonian, religion, and it has been amply demonstrated that fertility deities are often represented as carrying, or their worshippers as bearing, foliage, ears of corn, and vegetation in other forms.4 There is thus no difficulty in providing from Sumero-Akkadian religion textual references to, or representations in art of, vegetation in connexion with fertility deities, not as direct parallels to the 'branch' of Ezek. viii. 17 but as illustrative material. Whilst this aspect of the matter has been well covered, less attention has been paid to the precise nature of the ritual gesture apart from the 'branch'. Sumero-Akkadian religion does, how ever, throw light upon this, for both in the art (particularly glyptic art)5 and in the texts there occur many instances of the ritual gesture in which the worshipper, in confronting the deity, usually in a standing position, placed his hand before his mouth or nose. So usual was this attitude of approach or adoration that in Akkadian the ideogram sub, compounded of su ('hand') written over ka ('mouth') was commonly employed to denote karabu 'to pray, to bless' and ikribu 'prayer',6 whilst in Sumerian the compound ka su-gâl, literally 'to place the hand upon the mouth (or nose)' was the usual term for 'to show reverence (to the deity)' ;7 the Akkadian equivalent ofka su - gal was laban appi, literally 'wiping of 1 G.

The argument for a relationship between Ezek. viii. 17 and Sumero Akkadian religion need not, however, rest upon unrelated occurrences in the latter of the two postulated elements of the 'branch to the nose' rite, namely the laban appi and the ritual use of vegetation. Instances can be adduced of a ritual act which appears to correspond exactly with the rite in Ezek. viii. 17. Representations in art of the holding of an object to the nose, though much rarer than the plain 'hand to face' gesture, do occur. The most striking instance is the bronze relief AO 20185 in the Louvre.2 This depicts a male and female worshipper, identified as Esarhaddon and his mother Naqi'a, both standing facing the same direction and holding in the right hand, pressed up against the nose, an object apparently cylindrical in shape and represented as being about six inches in length and an inch in diameter. One may conclude almost certainly that the worshippers were originally depicted as approaching a deity or deities or divine symbols, for the inscription, though mutilated, has been shown to concern the purification and animation ceremonies which accom panied the installation of a divine statue.3 Similar or apparently related representations are found elsewhere in the New Assyrian period. On seal-impressions4 on documents found at Nimrud, Sennacherib is depicted standing facing a god identified as Assur: in his right hand the king holds before his nose something re sembling a small rod, of about the same apparent dimensions as those held by Esarhaddon and Naqi'a in AO 20185. Sennacherib, standing before the god and holding a similar object in the same position, is again represented on certain rock reliefs at Bavian,5 whilst an unidenti fied Assyrian king is depicted in the same ritual act on a relief at Maltai.6 Reliefs from Til-Barsip7 provide further examples of Esarhaddon holding 1 T.

The assimilation is not justified, for in these latter cases the object has a shape quite distinct from that of the object held in stelae A and B, and is not held before the face.</page><page sequence="5">322 NOTES AND STUDIES an object of the type described before his nose. The same object and gesture are seen on the sculptured stele BM 90837,1 which may be of Neo-Babylonian date. Slightly earlier (late eighth century B.c.) an ortho stat from Zinjirli bearing a building inscription of King Bar-rakeb shows the king with his left hand holding a stalked flower about a foot in front of his beard, and his right hand clenched about six inches in front of his mouth.2 At Tell Halaf a relief shows a man seated before the winged solar disk supported by two bull-men, with his left hand raised and holding a lotus-like flower to his nose.3 Also from Tell Halaf is a relief depicting a winged genie with the right hand raised to the height of the nose4 and apparently holding some small object.5 These Tell Halaf reliefs may be dated to between the twelfth and ninth cen turies B.C.6 There appears to be no certain representation of a scene showing a human worshipper holding an object to the nose in the art of earlier periods, though the possibility of such representations having existed is not to be excluded.7 A representation which, though of a goddess and not of a human, may be relevant occurs on a stone plaque from Mari. M. André Parrot's description of the figure reads: 'Les deux mains sont levées, côte à côte, mais il ne s'agit pas du geste classique de l'adoration car entre la main gauche et le nez, un petit morceau de fritte représente certainement une fleur que la déesse respire et qu'elle tient par la tige.'8 ! Amongst the many representations of adoration or presentation scenes in glyptic art there are a number, from the Early Dynastic period onwards, where it is possible that the hand raised before the mouth did bear some small object,9 but none amongst representations of human 1 Anatolian Studies, viii, pi. iii (a). 1 Kônigliche Museen zu Berlin, Mittheilungen aus den orientalischen Sammlun gen, Heft xiv [= Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli, iv] (1911), Taf. lxvii. 3 Max Freiherr von Oppenheim, TellHalaf, 3.

It is a figure in the round, dedicated to the god Amurru for the life of Hammurabi, and representing a genuflecting figure with the right hand raised to the level of the face, three fingers folded down, and the thumb and index finger held up together about two inches in front of the nose : the position of the hand could be taken to suggest that some thing may have been held, or intended to be held, between the thumb and index finger, though it is possible that the gesture was simply a variation of the plain laban appt. 8 Syria, xviii, p. 78. 9 Amongst examples which merit consideration are the following. H. Frank</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND STUDIES 323 worshippers where it is certain. One certain instance, and others more doubtful, can be adduced in which the minor deity introducing the worshipper before the great god holds a small object in front of his face :1 the scenes depicted are generally accepted as being cult-scenes rather than incidents from mythology, and since in the actual cult the intro ducing minor deity would need to be impersonated by a human priest, this may indicate that the divine statue was in some ceremonies ap proached by men (officiants in this case rather than worshippers) hold ing an object to the nose. An apparent literary parallel to Ezek. viii. 17 comes from a Sumerian text published by S. N. Kramer2 and discussed by J. J. A. Van Dijk.3 Gilgamesh, bearing an offering, is about to address the sun-god Utu when it is said of the former: su-ni pa-kù ka-na ba-da-gal literally 'his hand there was put with it a pure branch4 at his mouth', that is, as Van Dijk translates, 'dans sa main un brin pur à sa bouche était tenu'. The close verbal parallel between this and the biblical phrase does not require elaboration, and it is suggested that both passages refer to similar rites.5 It therefore appears that the 'branch to the nose' rite in Ezekiel could have been a form of, or imitation of, a compound ritual gesture of which both elements occurred in Sumerian religion from the earliest times, and of which the compound form may have been known and referred to in the Sumerian or immediate post-Sumerian period and was certainly well attested in later Assyrian religion, particularly in the reigns of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon. The latter was, however, the very period fort, Stratified Cylinder Seals from the Diyala Region, pi. 40, no. 423 (Akkadian period): the raised hand of the front worshipper could be taken to represent fingers bent inwards at an angle to the palm, or alternatively could denote an object held in the hand : since no other hand on this seal is represented as articu lated, the latter interpretation is preferred. Ur Excavations, x, pi. 32, no. 522: this seal, from which emblems of the gods are absent, shows two bare-headed worshippers : unless the hands are drawn badly out of proportion, both figures appear to hold an object in the hand raised before the face. 1 The certain instance is Ur Excavations, x, pi. 32, no. 516. 2 J.C.S. i, p. 8. 3 Bi.

Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p. 48) translates 'staff' : pa can also denote 'sceptre', but it has been shown (E. D. Van Buren, 'The Sceptre, its Origin and Significance', in R.A. 1, pp. 101-3) that the sceptre itself was originally a piece of wood cut from a living tree.

The identification of the branch in the Ezekiel rite and the question of whether there was an actual identity between this and the object depicted before the nose of the king in the Assyrian seal and reliefs remain to be considered. The noun zemora 'branch', or a form of it, occurs elsewhere in the Old Testament in the following passages: Num. xiii. 23 : 'and they cut from thence a z'mora and one bunch of grapes.' Ezek. xv. 2: 'Son of Man, what is the vine out of all trees, the zetnora which was among the trees of the forest.' (This passage goes on to say that the z'mora is not used for any work but is totally burnt, and a corresponding fate is threatened for the people of Jerusalem. The question arises whether the vine-stick (as the zemora evidently was here) is mentioned as the example only because vine wood is one of the woods which is too soft for use as timber or whether perhaps a z'mora was, in some cult known to the prophet, finally de stroyed completely by fire: the end of the next passage adduced suggests the latter.) Isa. xvii. 10-11 : 'therefore you plant slips of Na'amanz and you sow it (with) the z'mora of a strange (god). In the day of your planting you hedge it in, and in the morning you make your seed to blossom ; but the branches are consumed by fire in the day of destruction.'3 Nah. ii. 3 : 'for the emptiers have emptied them out4 and marred their vine branches (zemorehem).'s 2 י Kings xxi. 2-6. 2 On this as a term for Adonis see most recently Vet. Test, vii, pp. 201-2. 3 For the translation of נד and נחלה see I. Eitan, H.U.C.A. xii/xiii, p. 6s, and G. R. Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, p. 157, n. 17. In the clause following the passage quoted, 'desperate pain', accepted by Eitan, op. cit., for כאב אנוש, does not seem appropriate. To take כאב as preposition plus noun אב 'green ness' would give a sense 'and like a green shoot it is withered'. However, unless the נעמנים and the זמורה were treated differently, one being burnt and the other left to wither in the sun, this suggestion would appear to produce more difficul ties than it solves. 4 בוקק also has the meaning 'luxuriant (vine)' (Hos. x. 1). This suggests for Nah. ii. 3 (with the emendation or elimination of the single letter D) the meaning 'for they have made void the boqeqs and spoiled their z'moras', which would represent not only a paronomasia but also an excellent parallelism. The argu ment for the meaning of zemora is independent of this point. 5 A. Haldar, Studies in the Book of Ν ahum, pp. 121-4, sees this passage—as he does the greater part of the Book of Nahum—as an allusion to the Tammuz cult</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND STUDIES 325 From the Old Testament occurrences one may thus deduce that the zemora was a piece of wood from a living vine, employed in some cult upon which the prophets frowned, associated with the worship of Na'aman ( = Adonis). That it was, at least as employed in the cult, leafless, is indicated by Isa. xvii. io-n, where what horticulturalists know as a 'cutting' is in question.1 Nah. ii. 3 could be taken to suggest that the cult was thought of by the prophet as being particularly asso ciated with Assyria. The zemora, the vine as the tree of life, and fertility cults in association therewith have given rise to an extensive literature, the relevance of some of which to Ezek. viii. 17 may well be doubted. In what follows discussion is confined to some of the usages of "lût ('to prune') and its cognates which may throw light on the purpose in the cult of the zemora.2 The root zmr ('to prune') is well attested in the Old Testament,3 and the same root, or its cognates, is found with the same meaning in extra biblical Hebrew and other Semitic languages.4 Certain usages, however, introduce wider conceptions which may help to throw light on the cult referred to in Ezek. viii. 17. The earliest of these is the Ugaritic passage yzbrnn zbrm gpn,s where the cognate words occur in the ritual which brought about the birth of the gods shr and Mm. J. Gray6 regards this as 'the spring counterpart of the autumn fertility ritual', a conclusion which others have accepted.7 Also of interest in this connexion is the 1 In Ε. Hyams (ed.), Vineyards in England (1953), p. 60, it is stated: 'Although vines, like most other plants, can be rooted from soft wood, carrying leaves, this necessitates proper shaded propagating frames, and is seldom adopted.' Hyams points out (Grapes under Cloches (1952), p. 57) that 'the buds of vine cuttings open, the leaves expand, and the stems begin to grow before any roots at all are formed'. The specific suggestion is therefore that the 'zemora of a strange (god)' in Isa. xvii. 10 was a vine cutting which by watering was made to come rapidly into leaf (which it would do in a few days in a warm climate), after which it was either burnt or allowed to wither in the sun. 2 There seems to be no good reason for assigning ΓΠ1ί3Ι (as Koehler and Baumgartner, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, p. 259) to a distinct root related to Arabic jbj[ 'it bristled up (hair)'. 3 Koehler and Baumgartner, op. cit., pp. 259—60; F.

For com pleteness, though without shedding any further light on the problem, it may be added that the term zamru, denoting some concrete object (unless E. Ebeling is correct in taking it as a kind of wine2), occurs in Assyrian ritual texts in association with other cult objects and materials.3 zmr and its cognates appear also to have semantic connexions in another direction. In post-biblical Hebrew HTiat is used for 'phallus'. Gordis noted this fact but suggested that a careful study of the relevant passages in the Talmudic literature shows that 'the Rabbis did not know the meaning of zemora in Ezekiel and were interpreting it homiletically'.4 This cannot be accepted as disposing of the meaning 'phallus' for z'mora. Whilst there is every reason to agree with Gordis in his view that the Rabbis did not fully understand Ezek. viii. 17, the particular meaning for this word in post-biblical Hebrew does not depend only upon Talmudic (and Targumic5) exegesis of this passage, and in any case the meaning 'rod', without sexual connotation, was known to the • A · Rabbis.6 A parallel to zemora in its sense of 'phallus' is the Arabic yj or βjij, which is still a common word in Syria for 'penis'.7 The evidence outlined above provides grounds for the hypothesis that the z'mora was a cutting of wood pruned from the vine,8 used in a fertility9 cult which had Assyrian associations,10 and possibly taken, from its dimensions and its fertility associations, as representing a phallus. If it was normally leafless (as argued above) it might well have had the appearance of the objects held by the worshippers in the New Assyrian seal and reliefs, which could easily be taken as representing a phallus, spring, there can have been no direct connexion between the zemora of the Ezekiel rite and a spring ritual at Ugarit. It may be noted that some scholars re late the Shachar and Shalim text to a ritual of early summer; see G. R. Driver, op. cit., p. 23. 1 T. J.

The question of the identity of the god or gods worshipped demands consideration. Those who argue for Sumero-Akkadian associations of Ezek. viii. 17 have generally referred the rite to a Tammuz cult (which would indeed agree well with the conclusions reached above), and the specific mention of Tammuz in viii. 14 might appear to support this. The text does not, however, require this conclusion. As demonstrated above, the slight differences between the form of viii. 17 and the verses (6-16) describing three rites which at least spatially were distinct indicate that verse 17 was directly associated with verses 15-16, so that the primary association of 'the branch to the nose' must be with the worship of the rising sun. There can only be a direct connexion of 'the branch to the nose' with Tammuz if it can be shown either that the whole of verses 6-17 relates to the same cult, or (a possibility which could be subsumed in the former) that the rising sun was specifically associated with Tammuz. The former has been assumed, the rite of verses 6-11 being considered as referring to the sacred marriage in the gigunu,1 but the truth of this theory has not been established. Tabulated in the order in which they have been adduced above, the postulated parallel instances of a 'branch to the nose' rite in the extra biblical Semitic world are seen to have been related to the worship of particular deities or symbols as follows : Example of ritual gesture Object of worship Bronze relief AO 20185 the Stars of Night, Ea, Samas, Asalluhi (= Marduk), and three other deities.2 Seal-impressions from Nimrud Assur.3 Rock reliefs at Bavian Assur.4 Rock reliefs at Maltai Assur, Samas, Adad, and four other deities.5 Esarhaddon stele A (Til-Barsip) five gods of whom only Samas is definitely identifiable.6 Esarhaddon stele Β (Til-Barsip) none represented.7 Stele BM 90837 moon crescent, winged solar disk, and star symbol. 8 1 Th.

Goddess from Mari none represented. Cylinder seals uncertain. Sumerian literary text the Sumerian sun-god Utu. From an examination of this list, a tentative conclusion may be drawn. It is seen that out of all these postulated examples of the 'branch to the nose' in a Mesopotamian milieu, wherever the deity or deities to whom the adoration was directed can be positively identified, there is no case in which it did not include either the sun-god, the winged solar disk, or Assur. It is also relevant to note here that in the case of the orthostat from Zinjirli the excavators argued, purely on archaeological considera tions, that the relief originally stood on the exterior of the east side of the building:3 a consequence of such a position would be that the king depicted in the act of making the 'branch to the nose' gesture would be facing the rising sun. Stele Β of Esarhaddon at Til-Barsip, which lacks any representation of the object of adoration, may likewise have been facing east,4 but this is less certain. Save for the stubborn fact of the presence of Assur without Samas in some instances, there would be no difficulty in concluding from these examples that the 'branch to the nose' rite was specifically associated with the sun-god. There is no proof, unless the evidence of the eastward facing position of one or two of the reliefs be accepted as such, that the sun-god in these cases was the rising sun, but certainly the sun-god was, from the Akkadian period (c. 2300 B.c.) at least, worshipped at his rising by both humans and other deities.5 The occurrence of Assur alone as the object of worship does not necessarily provide an insuperable objection 1 Kônigliche Museen zu Berlin, Mittheilungen aus den orientalischen Samm lungen, Heft xiv [ = Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli, iv], p. 378.

The French scholars add 'Il est probable que la stèle faisait face à l'Ouest', but the only argument offered for this, concerned with the supposed visibility of the monument to people entering by the east gate near which it stood, would seem to the present writer to support rather the view that it must have faced east. 5 E. D. Van Buren, 'The Sun-god Rising' (R.A. xlix, pp. 1-14).</page><page sequence="12">NOTES AND STUDIES 329 to the theory that the primary association of the 'branch to the nose' rite was with the sun-god: the principal symbol of Assur himself was the winged solar disk,1 whilst as head of the Assyrian pantheon he ulti mately came, certainly by the time of the examples in question, to com prehend the characteristics of various other deities, notably Marduk,2 himself originally a sun-god with a fertility aspect. The 'branch to the nose' rite of Ezek. viii. 17 may therefore be con sidered to be paralleled in the Mesopotamian milieu in two main respects, namely in the form and matter of the gesture, and in the sun-god as the primary object of worship. The evidence adduced is against the sup position that the deity worshipped in Ezek. viii. 17 was specifically and directly Tammuz.3 It is, however, relevant to note that certain authori ties, notably A. Moortgat,4 have argued that there was actual syncretism between the Tammuz and Samas cults: discussion of this point would lead far beyond the proposed limits of the present study, but it may be remarked that though the extreme view of Moortgat has not found general acceptance,5 it is commonly agreed that the sun-god in Mesopo tamia, in particular the beneficent sun of early morning, had a fertility aspect.6 H.
