HE two years that have passed since the publication of my last report will rank among the most fruitful in the study of Celtic antiquity, thanks chiefly to the labours of Mr. Whitley Stokes and of Professor Heinrich Zimmer. So much new material has been made accessible to students, so far reaching have been the theories advanced and are the conclusions that inevitably force themselves upon the Celtologist, that I despair of being able within the space at my command to adequately express the scope and import of what has been achieved and attempted.' Following my usual practice in these reports, I deal first with investigations devoted to early continental Celtdom; then with Ireland, the records of which must ever remain our chief source of knowledge of Celtic antiquity and the Celtic genius; lastly, with the Brythonic Celts of Britain and Brittany, whose chief importance in so far as these reports are concerned lies in the fact that the Arthurian romance originated among and was mainly elaborated by them. Prof. Rhys's Rhind Lectures may conveniently be con- sidered under the first heading, although they are chiefly concerned with the Celtic inhabitants of these islands. Undoubtedly, however, the most suggestive of the many suggestive speculations contained in these lectures are those which attempt to determine the early habitat of the Celtic-speaking peoples, the order in which the hypothetical ancestors of the present Gaels and Brythons spread over the Continent and throughout the British Isles, and their relation to the populations which they conquered or dis- possessed. Prof. Rhys's investigations hardly allow of being summarised, and he would be the first to admit that he has I I need hardly say that I make no attempt at detailed criticism. My object is to bring clearly before those who are not specialists the salient results and main lines of investigation. 388</page><page sequence="3">Celtic Myth and Saga. reached no definitely settled results. His work is essentially pioneer work, and it would be unfortunate if the rather large class of persons whose interest in Celtic matters is not controlled by critical instinct were to regard the num- berless brilliant hypotheses scattered throughout these lectures as other than tentative. The principle, however, which underlies most of Prof. Rhys's theories deserves to be brought into prominence-it is that the Celtic-speak- ing tribes were numerically insignificant compared with the populations they subdued, and that their own speech, institutions, and beliefs were profoundly modified by those of these peoples. This principle, of which Prof. Rhys has given examples in these pages (cf. ante, iii, 260), is accepted by other scholars. A striking instance is furnished by M. S. Reinach's note on Druidism (Revue Celt., I892, April). He claims that it represents the pre-Celtic (probably pre-Aryan) worship of the race which erected the megalithic monuments, that its spirit was in striking contrast, not to say marked hostility, to the anthropomorphic conception of religion found among the Aryan tribes of Greece, Italy, and Asia, and that it shared this particularity with the Pythagorean doctrine. Indeed, whilst M. Reinach very properly lays no stress upon the theory of certain ancients that Pythagoras was a pupil of the Druids, he evidently considers that it has a legitimate justification in the affinity of the two systems of belief. It is not easy to exaggerate the importance of this expression of opinion from a scholar fully equipped with all the appliances of modern research and animated by the strictest critical method. M. Reinach deliberately countenances a traditional theory, discarded for a while as unscientific, whilst at the same time he indicates how that theory must be modified to make it accord with existing knowledge. I shall have frequent occasion in the follow- ing pages to instance other cases in which the traditional view has been vindicated or rehabilitated in its essence, if not in all its details. 389</page><page sequence="4">Celtic My/h and Saga. M. D'Arbois de Jubainville's works, cited at the head of this article under Nos. 2 and 3, lie outside the scope of these reports, but must be mentioned as indispensable to any serious student of Celtic antiquity. Turning to Ireland, we find that great activity has been shown in that first requisite of scholarly progress-the publication and translation of texts. Mr. Whitley Stokes has issued, in the Transactions of the Philological Society (for I891-92), the Bodleian fragment of Cormac's Glossary, Irish text and English version. Although a modern tran- script (1440 A.D.), it was made, as the editor points out, from an older text than that represented by any other MS. save the I th century fragment in the Book of Leinster. According to Mr. Whitley Stokes, the Glossary in its oldest form was written (the italics are mine) not much before the i th century, i.e., at the end, instead of at the beginning, of the Ioth century, the traditional date. It is noteworthy that all the articles (" imbas forosna", " lethec/l", " mugh-eme", "Manannan mac lir", " nescoit", "orc", "prrul") which make Cormac's Glossary so invalu- able to the student of Celtic myth and saga are to be found in this fragment. Mr. Whitley Stokes has also published in the Revue Cel- tique the most important text of the so-called mythological cycle (cf. Folk-Lore Journal, ii, 175), the "Second Battle of Moytura". In this story we see what are presumably the personages of the ancient Irish pantheon masquerading in the guise of prehistoric kings and chiefs, yet retaining the magic attributes and capacities which distinguish the actors in the god- and hero-tales of nearly every race that has produced such tales. The MS. tradition of the tale as a whole is late, and it is open to the sceptic to urge that these magic supernatural traits do not come down from a primitive pre-Christian stage, but are simply part of a story- telling machinery common throughout the Middle Ages, and mainly derived from blurred reminiscences of classic fable. This is a theory that must be re-faced in respect of 390</page><page sequence="5">Celtic Myth and Saga. each separate tale or cycle of tales, that cannot be re- jected or accepted on a priori grounds, but must in each case be judged mainly by the internal evidence furnished by the tale itself. If we examine the Moytura story we find, apart from the fact that a portion of it occurs in Cormac's Glossary, strong evidence of its archaic character in the almost entire absence of any Christian colouring, in the comic nature of certain of the supernatural personages (the rdle of the Dagda, the assumed head of the Irish pantheon, recalls that of Herakles in Aristophanes, or, with less dignity, that of Thor in some of the Norse legends), and in the lack of either incident or characterisa- tion that seems referable to classic sources. Our present text, which is obviously late and much interpolated, presents an interesting literary problem in the parallelism of the final passage with certain portions of the Voluspa. The impression of genuine and archaic origin which this text produces, when read by itself, is much strengthened by comparison with another important tale translated by Mr. Whitley Stokes, the story of the Boroma tribute exacted from Leinster by Tuathal Techtmar, High King of Ireland in the second century, and levied for a space of 500 years, until Saint Molling procured its remission by a piece of verbal trickery. The two stories may well have assumed substantially their present shape at about the same period, viz., from the 9th to the Ith century, and probably owe that shape to the same class of men, the monkish scholars and transcribers who have preserved for us the legends elaborated by the Ollam/s. Yet the character of the two tales is entirely different-the one obviously mythic, the other professedly historic, non-historic accretions being of a legendary or romantic but not of a mythic nature; the one free from any traces of Christianity save the most superficial and such as betray at once their late and inter- polated origin, the other, in consonance with its historical framework, relying wholly upon Christianity for its super- natural element. If, as some would claim, the originating 39I</page><page sequence="6">Celtic MIy/h and Saga. cause of both story-cycles is to be found in an alien and purely literary culture, is such consistent adaptation of treatment to subject-matter conceivable for one moment? Must not rather the unprejudiced observer recognise that the mediaeval story-teller is relating something much older than himself; something derived, substantially, from that stage of culture to which it professes to belong ? To judge otherwise were to look upon these tales as historical novels. This genre was not entirely unknown in the Middle Ages, but we know by a famous example, Geoffrey of Mon- mouth's pseudo-history of Britain, how it was conceived and elaborated. Nothing more alien in spirit and execu- tion to the Irish tales we are considering can be imagined. We further owe to Mr. Whitley Stokes text and trans- lation of the oldest version of Cormac's Adventure in the Land of Promisel (a modern recension of which had been published by Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady in vol. iii of the Ossianic Society's Transactions), one of the most interesting early Irish descriptions of the Otherworld, and remarkable in its present, relatively late form, from having received some slight Christian touches, which can, however, be easily separated from the main body of the tale. The same volume of the frische Texte contains the text and German version by Professor Windisch of perhaps the most curious and, to folk-lorists, most interesting of the remscda, or introductory stories prefixed to the Tain b6 Cuailgne. The greatest of Irish epics is traced back to the quarrel of two swineherds who war against each other for years in different shapes, both human and animal, and finally reincarnate themselves in two bulls, the rivalry between which it is that leads to the invasion of Ulster by the allied forces of the remainder of Ireland. As I pointed out in my paper on Heroic Legend, read before the Second International Folk-lore Congress, this is practically the oldest known example of the Transformation fight-incident, which, as is well known, occurs, though in different form, 1 Irische Texte, vol. iii, I. 392</page><page sequence="7">Celtic Myth and Saga. 393 in the I6th century Welsh tale of Taliesin, and has been boldly claimed as a late loan from the East. Its presence in an Irish tale, which can hardly be younger than the seventh century, and which is probably centuries older, shows how baseless this claim is. The number of Irish texts which have been translated is considerable, but they are either scattered through the pages of specialist periodicals, or, as a rule, unaccom- panied by such critical comment as enables the layman to judge of their place in Celtic literature. It is the merit of M. D'Arbois de Jubainville's Epopee celtique to make the general reader free of a domain hitherto reserved for the specialist, or only thrown open to the public at large without the necessary sign-posts. A selection is given of the more important texts, the MS. sources are enumerated, the authenticity and development of the versions are discussed, the scientific value of the ancient Irish sagas is set forth briefly but clearly. I think too well of this book not to hope that a second edition may soon be called for, and in anticipation thereof would point out what I cannot but consider serious defects, defects that may, however, be easily remedied. A large amount of space is wasted upon French versions of Mac- pherson's Ossian. Whatever Macpherson's merits as a writer may be, he throws absolutely no light upon the origin and early form of the Gaelic heroic epos. Again, the volume, due to the collaboration of M. D'Arbois and his pupils, has not been brought up to date. Thus the trans- lation and comment upon the Voyage of Mael Duin, due to M. Ferd. Lot, date from before Prof. Zimmer's masterly account of the immran literature (cf. ante, i, p. 237). M. Lot cannot be blamed for not having anticipated Prof. Zim- mer's results, but the public is justly entitled to complain that he has not revised his study in accordance with the latest and best information. I pass from the disagreeable task of fault-finding to the consideration of some views advanced by the editor which,</page><page sequence="8">Celtic Mllyth and Saga. if correct, have an important bearing upon the study of ancient Celtic literature. M. D'Arbois cites the institution of marriage as exemplifying that archaic side of early Irish civilisation upon which he rightly lays so much stress. The household chief, he says, with perhaps unnecessary realism, held his women in little more estimation than he did the females of his flocks and herds, and was as indif- ferent to the paternity of the offspring in the one as in the other case. M. D'Arbois is better acquainted with Irish law than any man living, and I doubt not his having good ground for such an extreme assertion. But I must point out that it is not warranted by the testimony of the very sagas which he prints. True, the droit du seigneur is prominent in the oldest tales, and seems to have been as widely spread an institution in ancient Ireland as it still is. in certain parts of Africa. But the Tochmarc Emer (Arch. Review, vol. i) turns in part upon Cuchulainn's reluctance to submit to this custom. A similar reluctance is shown by one of the personages in the Boroma tribute story (Rev. Celt., xiii, p. 59). The story of Curoi mac Daire's death is partly a sermon against female fickleness; the stories of Mesgegra's death, and of the Sons of Uisnech, are partly examples of woman's faithfulness. These instances might easily be multiplied, but they suffice to prove either that M. D'Arbois, generalising too widely, has drawn an over- black picture of the marriage relation in ancient Ireland, or else that the romantic sagas are the outcome of a much later stage of national development than that testified to by the customals. If this is so, one can hardly doubt that the active principle in this development must have been Christianity. On the other hand, if Christianity affected the spirit of these stories in so vital a particular, would its influence have stopped there ? But on the whole M. D'Ar- bois' opinion of the marriage-tie in early Ireland would seem, if justified, to prove the relative lateness of the heroic tales. Now one of these tales, the Tochmnarc Emer, contains the incident of the father and son combat, found 394</page><page sequence="9">Celtic jMyth and Saga. 395 also in Teutonic saga not later than the eighth century (Hildebrand and tHadubrand), and in Iranian saga not later than the tenth century (Rustem and Sohrab). Com- menting upon these facts (Waifs and Strays, Iv) I claimed the Irish tale of Cuchulainn and Conlaoch as the Celtic variant of a pan-Aryan incident. But M. D'Arbois goes much further than this. According to him the German version is dependent upon the Irish one, and is a result of that Teutonic and Celtic contact in central Europe which lasted throughout the fourth and third centuries B.C. Again, he maintains that the Iranian version, which, although only known to us in Firdusi's poem, is certainly ages older than Christianity, represents a younger and less perfect form of the story than does the Irish one. Sohrab, he points out, has to fight against an Amazon queen. On the part of the son this combat is meaningless, and the incident in Firdusi can only be a distorted reminiscence of thefather's overcoming the Amazon who is to be the mother of the son, never to be seen again by him until the last fatal encounter. This is the form of the story in the Toclhmarc Enter. If M. D'Arbois is correct the Irish tale is thrown back into prehistoric times, must indeed date as far back as any known portion of Hellenic saga. But the con- stancy of Emer (she refuses the chief of Munster's heir for Cuchulainn's sake) is an essential element of the story. The men and women of early Ireland were, then, on a somewhat higher level in love matters than the beasts of the field ? M. D'Arbois accords little space to the Finn or Ossianic cycle. As is well known, this has formed the subject of a revolutionary series of investigations by Prof. Zimmer. I have summarised these for English readers in The Aca- demny of February 1891 (reprinted Waifs and Strays, IV, with additions and modifications), and can only deal briefly with the subject here. Traditional Irish history makes Finn a third-century warrior. Modern scholars have ac- cepted this date. Some have considered the Finn saga to</page><page sequence="10">Celtic Myth and Saga. be mainly historical, with later romantic accretions; others, like myself, have held it to be mainly ancient myth re- crystallised around a third-century name. According to Professor Zimmer, Finn was an early ninth-century half- Viking, half-Irishman, an opponent of the Dublin Danes, by whom he was slain. Let us first see what this theory postulates respecting the Irish records that have come down to us: (a) That the genuine history of the ninth century, in so far as this hypothetical struggle of Finn against the Danes is concerned, was practically left un- recorded in its chronological place save for the chance entry of the defeat and death of Caitill Find; (b) that the main elements of this history were used as the basis of an historical romance the date of which was thrown back five hundred years; (c) that the statements of this romance reacted upon the genuine historical record of the third- tenth centuries. No reason is assigned for this process, and the only explanation of it vouchsafed is that the genuine history of the early ninth, was strikingly like the genuine history of the third century, so that confusion was made possible. It is difficult to find in English history an analogy to the process postulated. If, however, we can imagine the stories about Alfred's resistance to the Danes being carried back to the fifth century, and thus originating the story of Arthur's resistance to the Saxons, we can form some idea of what Professor Zimmer assumes to have taken place in Ireland. The analogy, of course, halts in this, that the men who sang of Alfred were of other race than those who told of Arthur; but it will serve the purpose. That the Irish could create pseudo-history on a large scale we know, but we also know why they did it. The annalists of the eighth and succeeding centuries were Chris- tian monks, and they could only conceive mythic tradition as pseudo-history. It was inevitable that they should euhemerise the national mythology. They obeyed exactly the same impulse as Nennius or Saxo Grammaticus. But 396</page><page sequence="11">Celtic Myth and Saga. what motive could possibly account for such wholesale reconstruction of ex /hpothesi genuine history as is re- quired by Prof. Zimmer's theory? A priori objections such as this cannot, however, stand against facts. Unfortunately, however, for Prof. Zimmer, his facts, in so far as they belong to the domain of philology, are contested by philologists of at least equal standing with himself. Disclaiming all competence in the question, I can merely note that the balance of authority is decidedly against Prof. Zimmer. In so far as the facts belong to the domain of history, I can appreciate the force of the arguments against him. Thus it is a requisite of his theory that the words "fiann", " feni", and their allied forms date from after 850 A.D. But M. D'Arbois de Jubainville cites several examples of the word "feni" (in the sense of Irishmen or men in general) from what are apparently the most archaic portions of the Irish customals, thus cutting the ground entirely from under Prof. Zimmer's feet. Pending fresh evidence, one can only state that Prof. Zimmer's attack upon the traditional account of the Finn heroic cycle has failed. That this is so is partly that scholar's own fault, or rather has its explanation in certain peculiarities of his temperament. Prof. Zimmer has a wonderful capacity for detail investigation, a passion for elaborating equally every portion of the hypotheses he is fond of constructing. He is thus led to lay as much stress upon what may be secondary as upon what are vital elements of his theory. He fortifies an unimportant out- post in such wise that its capture seems equivalent to that of the central donjon. This tendency of his makes his studies most instructive, reading. Nowhere else does one find such an enormous mass of detail brought together. But in addition to laying him open unnecessarily to damaging onslaught, this tendency has the further dis- advantage of leading astray persons who are unable to discriminate, and are inclined to accept or reject theories en bloc. Prof. Zimmer is right in many things, say these 397</page><page sequence="12">Celtic Myth anzd Saga. persons, therefore he must be right in all, and they forth- with choose his most questionable theory upon which to build further hypotheses. This is the explanation of an article by M. Pflugk- Hartung in the Revue Celtique. The writer's object is praiseworthy. Struck by the difficulty of dating the earliest Irish stories by purely literary tests, he turned to archaeo- logy for more trustworthy evidence. The material life pictured in these stories seemed to him inconsistent with the testimony of the peat-moss and the chambered barrow. In this perplexity, Prof. Zimmer's contention for the marked influence exercised upon Irish heroic literature by Viking creed and fancy was a ray of light. As is the way of disciples, he went one better, and for him the great mass of Irish sagas are post-Viking compositions of the tenth century, the material and moral civilisation of which (and not that of pre-Christian Ireland) it is they reflect. This is a bold contention, and it is worth a moment's inquiry whether archaeological evidence alone is capable of proving it. That archaeology can throw valuable light upon the origin and nature of a text is certain, but the light is apt to be very dim unless we have a previously formed idea of how the text came into being. Now with regard to the older stratum of Irish heroic legend (that of which Cuchulainn is the chief hero), the doctrine which holds the field, and which is based chiefly upon Prof. Zimmer's admirable researches into the composition of the texts contained in the Leabhar na ' Uidhre, is briefly this. Reduced to writing for the first time in the seventh century, when Christianity had at once introduced a new culture, established new ideals, and forced the older world it dispossessed to manifest itself in permanent form on forfeit of disappearing altogether, the after history of these tales belongs to written literature rather than to oral tradition. But they were not slavishly transcribed; each age modern- ised and revised them, put new words in the place of obsolete ones, glossed archaisms, transformed or eliminated 398</page><page sequence="13">Celtic liytIh and Saga. intelligibilities. Nay more-variant versions were welded together, harmonising additions were made, the loose chronology of the saga was brought into accord with pseudo-history, scraps of new learning were plentifully introduced. Moreover, so Prof. Zimmer thinks, changes were actually made in the framework of the stories under the influence of Norse legend. But with this exception he looks upon the tales as still seventh century in sub- stance; i.e., the changes made between the hypothetical original written form and the eleventh-century texts we possess are, he holds, secondary and not primary. What follows ? Obviously, that little reliance can be placed upon any archaeological argument a silentio: we cannot con- demn the texts as post-Christian because they do not contain traits which we know to be pre-Christian; these may, are likely indeed, to have often dropped out. Nor can we lay much stress upon the archaeological evidence in unimportant details where nothing stood in the way of the transcriber's or reviser's substituting a familiar for an unfamiliar or wholly forgotten word or idea. On the other hand, every archaic trait, however slight, must date back to the original form. The monkish editors and transcribers simply could not, even had the thought suggested itself to them, have invented details of manners and customs long passed away in order to give their versions an old-fashioned look. Unless, indeed-for there is an unless-certain traits held their ground by virtue of their belonging to an arsenal of epic cliches. But an epic convention implies a long and vigorous epic production, and M. Pflugk-Hartung is debarred from using this latter argument, as he maintains that the Irish sagas were new compositions of the tenth century. Let us then test his argument by the canons we have just laid down. Iron is frequently mentioned in these tales. But, says M. Pflugk-Hartung, iron was unknown in pre-Christian Ireland, ergo every tale in which iron appears must have been composed long after Christianity. On the other hand, the tales which profess and approve themselves 399</page><page sequence="14">Celtic Myth and Saga. to be the oldest, invariably picture the warrior as fighting from his war-chariot in the very guise set forth in the pages of Caesar. We do not know exactly when this custom ceased in Ireland, but it is safe to say hundreds of years before the tenth century. Now this, says M. Pflugk- Hartung, is a matter of no importance. Who does not see that the very contrary is the truth? That even if we knew-which we do not-the exact date of the introduction of iron into Ireland, its mention in a story only gives a clue to the date of the redaction, not of the story itself? that the change from the obsolete metal to the one in use when the scribe wrote is a most natural one, whereas the retention of an entirely obsolete mode of fighting is inexplicable, unless we admit the substantially archaic character of the text in which it is found ? Curiously enough, M. Pflugk-Hartung separates himself from Prof. Zimmer on the question of the late date of the Finn cycle. It is easy to see why. Whatever opinion may be held concerning the origin of this cycle, it is certain that the great bulk of the stories composing it belong to a much later stage of composition than do those of the Ultonian cycle. Many, it is quite possible, were first reduced to writing in the tenth and eleventh centuries; many, again, are even later. Now the difference in the presentment of material life is most marked, and M. Pflugk- Hartung may well have felt embarrassed at finding tales probably composed at the very time to which he ascribes the Ultonian cycle, and which yet picture a material life so different and in many respects more advanced. The extraordinary conclusion at which he arrives is, that the Ultonian or Cuchulainn cycle, as we have it, is posterior to that of Finn. I may here note the interesting Ossianic tales published by M. L. C. Stern in the January number of the Revue Celtique. One of these is important as being a prose amplification of an episode told in verse in the Book of Leinster, the others as being hitherto quite unknown. 400</page><page sequence="15">Cellzc Myth and Saga. In one, Finn is found predicting the coming of Christianity. This trait, a commonplace of the cycle, is easy to explain if, pre-Christian at first, these stories were finally adapted by Christian scribes. On Prof. Zimmer's theory it is well- nigh inexplicable. I have dwelt at some length on M. Pflugk-Hartung's article, little as its conclusions deserve notice, because it is characteristic of a current tendency to strain archaeological evidence beyond its due limits. That much may be hoped, however, from a searching investigation of Irish prehistoric art in all its phases I firmly believe, and I trust that the younger generation of Irish scholars will not suffer the work of Todd and Petrie and Wilde to remain uncom- pleted. Comparatively little has been done in regard to the collection and study of modern Gaelic folk-lore. Colonel Wood-Martin, in the third and concluding volume of his great work upon the Antiquities and History of Sligo, devotes chapters to manners and customs, and to legends and superstitions, both of which may be consulted with profit, particularly with regard to well-worship. Mr. Moore's Folk-lore of the Isle of M4ian is a useful and careful summary of what is known Volumes iii and iv of Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition contain valuable and authentic material for the study of Gaelic folk-fancy. The interest of the late Rev. A. Cameron's Reliquice Celtica (to which I have already drawn attention ante, p. 280) is mainly philological. It is earnestly to be hoped that all Highlanders will welcome this worthy memorial of Scot- land's greatest Gaelic scholar. I may be permitted to place on record the claims I have advanced in these pages (ante, March I892) on behalf of the Gaelic mrirchen, Gold Tree and Silver Tree, that it is the most faithful representative of the story-root whence have sprung the German mdrchen of Schneewittchen and the twelfth-century Breton lai of Eliduc. One point of no small importance has been partly VOL. III.. D D 401</page><page sequence="16">Celic Myth and Saga. cleared up during the last few months. Readers of FOLK- LORE may recollect that one of the sins which Prof. Zimmer laid to my charge was that I used the Gaelic story of the Great Fool as evidence of the Celtic origin of the incident, similar to it, found in the Conte du Graal and in the Welsh tale of Peredur. I promised to investigate this charge.1 The Gaelic story has hitherto been known in two portions, one the lay proper, in verse, the other a prose introduction to the lay, printed by Campbell from oral tradition (Popular Tales, vol. iii). It was from this prose introduction that I chiefly drew my parallels between the Gaelic and French stories. But the Irish text of I716, to which Prof. Zimmer drew my attention afresh, turns out, as my friend Dr. Hyde reports, to be a prose version, comprising both Campbell's introduction and the lay, and to be obviously dependent, in the first portion at least, upon some Arthurian romance akin to the English Sir Perceval. Until the whole is translated it would be unsafe to say if this prose text represents the original of the lay of the Great Fool, or if it be not rather a welding together of the lay and an Arthurian romance. In any case, Campbell's oral version is closely akin to the Irish text of 1716, and as this may possibly be a mere transla- tion from the English or French, it cannot be accepted, for the present at least, as an independent variant of the Perceval story. Any arguments which I have based upon the Campbell fragment, whether in my "Aryan Expul- sion and Return Formula among the Celts" (Folk-lore Record, iv) or in my " Legend of the Grail", must there- fore be considered invalid, whilst arguments based upon the lay (of which I still doubt the Arthurian origin) should for the present be left out of account. In Romania for January I892, M. F. Lot, discussing the swan-children incident in the "Children of Lir", and the parallel between Diarmaid's combat in the "Pursuit Cf. my article, FOLK-LORE, June 1891. 402</page><page sequence="17">Celtic Myth and Saga. of the Gilla Dacker",l and Owain's combat with the knight of the fountain,2 expressed himself sceptical as to the possibility of any French Arthurian influence upon Irish story-telling. In view of the facts adduced above this scepticism is not justified. It is, however, impossible to dogmatise as to the extent of this influence before all the Irish Arthurian texts have been edited, translated, and critically examined. Before leaving Irish soil I would fain linger for a moment over the fascinating volume in which Miss Stokes follows up the tracks of the wandering Irish monks who founded churches and monasteries in the Lombardy and Tuscany of the sixth and seventh centuries. No account of the development of the Irish race but must give its due weight to the fact that within a relatively short period after the introduction of Christianity into Ireland Irish missionaries were at work, respected and revered, through- out Western Europe. We should have to assume for pre-Christian Ireland, even if tradition did not assert its existence, a stage of advanced barbarism (practically the stage revealed to us by the oldest epic narratives) as a background to the achievements of Columba and his fellows. With a stage of savagery, such as some writers contend for, immediately preceding the introduction of Christianity, the missionary process is inexplicable. Thus, in Gaelic philology, accumulation of fresh material rather than new and generally accepted critical theory has been the mark of the last two years. In Brythonic philology, on the other hand, criticism has been far more important than publication of texts. Before I proceed to discuss the great series of investigations by which Professor Zimmer has thrown so much light upon the origin and development of the Arthurian cycle, I may be allowed, in spite of my close connection with the work, to point out the significance 1 Cf. Joyce's Celtic Romances for the story. 2 "The Lady of the Fountain," in Lady Guest's Mabinogion. DD2 403</page><page sequence="18">Celtic Myth and Saga. of Dr. Sommer's researches into the sources of Malory's Morte Darthur.l Malory is the latest in date of the mediaeval writers who worked up the Arthurian stories into a cyclic whole. The compilers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had welded the enormous mass of episodic incident that lay to their hand into four or five well-defined branches or sub-cycles, and had connected these in a more or less artificial way. This process was continued by Malory, who practically gives us an abridg- ment of the whole story cycle in one continuous narrative. What was the relation of this fifteenth-century compilation to the older compilations of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ? In how far could it be used for the purpose of recovering the earliest forms of the stories? Questions these not seriously attempted, save in the case of the Lancelot story by M. Gaston Paris, until Dr. Sommer took them in hand and now finally answered. Henceforth Malory can be used by the student, or rather must be used by the student in conjunction with Dr. Sommer's Commentary, if he wishes to obtain in the quickest and pleasantest mode possible a general knowledge of the Arthurian romance. Whilst this storehouse of legend, which is also one of the noblest monuments of our literature, has been edited with a special view to the requirements of the scholar, the foundations of early Welsh history have been laid afresh by Mr. Egerton Phillimore in his edition of the Annales Cambriaw and Old Welsh Genealogies, from Harl. MS. 3859 (Y Cymmrodor, ix, 141), in the notes which he has added to the articles by Mr. J. E. Lloyd and Mr. William Edwards (Y Cymmrodor, xi, pp. I5-IOI), and in the masterly article on the publication of Welsh Historical Records (Y Cymzrodor, xi, pp. 133-175). Research into the origins of the Arthurian romance must always be based in part upon the early Welsh historical documents, 1 These form the third volume of Dr. Sommer's edition of the 3Morte Darthur. 404</page><page sequence="19">Celtic Myth and Saga. and it is indispensable to know what is their oldest and most authentic form, and what changes the state- ments contained in them have undergone. This know- ledge is conveyed to us with a precision and accuracy beyond all praise in Mr. Phillimore's articles. The publication of Old-Welsh texts which is being con- tinued by Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans and Prof. Rhys concerns at present the student of language rather than the student of fable. It is, however, upon their text of the Red Book version of the Mabinogion that M. Loth has based his French version. Experts are generally agreed that this translation represents the Welsh original more fully and more closely than does the English one by Lady Guest. It is, moreover, provided with a translation of the Triads arranged according to the sources, of the Annals and Genealogies printed by Mr. Phillimore in the Cymmnrodor, and of various other documents which throw light upon the mediaeval Welsh tales. M. Loth is well read in Welsh literature, and his commentary derived from this source is at once fuller and more precise than that of Lady Guest's edition. When to these merits the advantages of cheap- ness and accessibility are added, it may easily be under- stood that M. Loth's translation has rapidly become the vulgate to which all scholars refer as they do to Mr. Evans and Prof. Rhys' edition of the original. It has, however, defects to which attention should be called. The com- mentary is sadly to seek in all that concerns the study of comparative literary history; here M. Loth has practically ignored all recent research and contented himself with reproducing Lady Guest's notes. But my chief complaint is with the version itself. M. Loth has striven to reproduce the Welsh text as closely as possible. This is well, but a translation should be something more than a crib, it should aim at conveying the tone and spirit as well as the letter of the original. My Welsh friends tell me that the Mabin- ogion are, in their native dress, a work of rare and exqui- site literary beauty. This beauty, which has passed entire 405</page><page sequence="20">Celtz'c Myt and Saga. into Lady Guest's version, one of the chief masterpieces of prose romantic narrative in the language, has disappeared utterly in M. Loth's French translation. We might set this down to the marked inferiority of modern French for pur- poses of romantic narrative but for the fact that M. de la Villemarque has produced a most graceful and charming version of some of these tales. It will be said, I know, that he contented himself with putting Lady Guest's English into French. Perhaps he did. But compare his version of Geraint and Enid with that of M. Loth. Nine-tenths of the differences are simply stylistic; they in nowise affect our appreciation of the subject-matter, but they do make M. Loth's French bald and tedious to an intolerable degree. I most willingly admit the value of many of M. Loth's changes, I gladly concede that his version is indispensable to the non-Welsh student of the Mabinogion, but surely the positive mistakes made by Lady Guest might have been corrected; surely, where her freedom misrepresents the original, closeness might have been obtained without sacri- ficing every trait of the beauty which those who know the original declare it possesses. I trust M. Loth will pardon the vivacity of my censure, but to me the Mabinogion are one of the most precious heritages of beauty which the past has bequeathed to us, and I cannot bear to see this heritage sacrificed to a pedantic and, as I believe, mistaken idea of the translator's art. I now come to Prof. Zimmer's studies, a list of and brief reference to which will be found in my apologia, printed in the Revue Celtique, and reprinted FOLK-LORE, vol. ii. It is characteristic that the motive-power of these masterly investigations should be opposition to what the author evidently regards as a false and pestilent heresy, namely M. Gaston Paris's hypothesis as to the origin of the French Arthurian literature. This the great French scholar regarded as the outcome of contact between the Anglo- Norman poets and Celtic romance consequent upon the 1 April 1891. 406</page><page sequence="21">Celtic Myth and Saga. Norman conquest of England and settlement in Southern Wales. He assumed that the French verse and prose romances of the late twelfth century had been preceded by shorter Anglo-Normanic narrative poems, akin some- what to the lais of Marie de France.l The thesis which, in opposition to M. Gaston Paris, Prof. Zimmer set himself to prove is no new one; it is that the French minstrels drew their knowledge of Arthur and his warriors not from Wales and Cornwall, but from Brittany. But what is new is the convincing way in which it is worked out, and the consequences drawn from it. Firstly, the formative period of the romance, which was to be elaborated later by the French poets, is defined as that during which the Bretons were in close political and social contact with the Normans (ninth-eleventh centuries), resulting in a bilingual zone, to the wandering minstrels of which the stories in their present form may often be traced. Secondly, the French Arthurian romance is due to the slow elabora- tion of tales and lyrics brought with them to Armorica by the British emigrants of the sixth-seventh centuries, which gradually put off their original quasi-historic char- acter, and were profoundly modified by later vicissitudes in the national life of the Bretons. Thirdly, after the Norman Conquest this specific Breton form of the Arthur hero-tales was brought to England and Wales by the Breton allies of the Conqueror, and influenced the more historic form of these tales which had been preserved by the Welsh. Fourthly, the features in which the Breton form differs from the Welsh ones must be ascribed to the widening of the Breton horizon which followed the emi- gration to the Continent and to the contact with Gallo- Frankish civilisation; such features must be used with great caution, if at all, as evidence for Celtic belief and fancy. I do not think that this brief summary either mis- 1 The last chapter of Prof. Rhys's Arthurian Studies deals with the views of Prof. Zimmer and of M. Gaston Paris. 407</page><page sequence="22">Celtic Myth and Saga. represents the results which arise out of rather than are definitely stated in Prof. Zimmer's pages, or that it fails to mark their importance and interest. Should I not have done justice to Prof. Zimmer in these respects it is from lack of skill and not of will. Nor should I fail to note that the value of his investigations depends only slightly upon the correctness of his results. He has cross-examined the documents far more searchingly than any previous scholar; he has been indefatigable in ransacking the records of the sixth-eleventh centuries with a view to providing an historical basis for this or that episode of the romances; he is always ingenious in detail, most ingenious perhaps when he is substantially contra- dicting himself. It will be understood that merits such as these cannot be adequately exhibited in the few pages at my disposal. Let me then note that much of the evidence is philological; thus, the forms of names in many French Arthurian romances are shown to be Breton and not Welsh, as is also the case, partly, with Geoffrey of Mon- mouth and William of Malmesbury. Prof. Zimmer is a believer in the Northern locale of the original Arthur-tales, and makes ingenious use of the fact that this locale may readily be distinguished in the French romances-the Bretons, whose historical connection with Britain ceased with the seventh century, preserved it better than the Welsh, the centre of whose political history was shifted from Northern to South-Western Britain, and who gradually came to look upon Arthur as a South-Welsh chieftain. Welsh literature, even of the oldest class, is shown to be comparatively modern in its present form; for instance, the tale of Kulhwch and Olwen, and the Triads of the Horses in the Black Book, are shown to allude to post-Conquest personages. When the reader frees himself from the avalanche of detail under which Prof. Zimmer overwhelms him, he is apt, however, to ask himself if the result of the German scholar's labours is quite what the latter thinks it to be. 408</page><page sequence="23">Cellt' Mly1, and Saga. Does his theory entirely exclude that of M. Gaston Paris ? Does it bear all the conclusions drawn from it, implicitly rather than explicitly, it should be noted ? The French verse and prose narratives of the twelfth century may go back exclusively to Breton lais-does this prove that the Arthur saga was originally historic in its essence, and that the later romantic developments are exclusively Breton. In the course of centuries the Breton forms may, indeed must have grown differently from the Welsh ones-does that prove that every specific Breton feature is, if not non- Celtic, at least foreign to the original form of the legend ? Thus Prof. Zimmer regards the passing of Arthur to Avalon as specifically Breton, as foreign to the historical spirit of the original Arthur tales. Yet who more than Prof. Zimmer in his studies on the Brendan legend has thrown clearer light upon that Celtic presentment of the Otherworld and of the hero's journey thither of which the whole Avalon episode is such an unmistakable variant? Again, Erec and Lancelot are held to be purely Breton. Granted for argument's sake that they do not appear in the Welsh record, does that prove that they cannot be elabora- tions of old Celtic heroes, that Erec must be derived from the sixth-century Visigoth chief of Aquitaine, Euric, or Lancelot from the ninth-century Carolingian warrior, Lant- bert ? I should be sorry indeed if Prof. Zimmer had denied himself these latter hypotheses; in working them out he forces his readers into by-paths of history which the majority would otherwise never tread. But what single shred of positive evidence is brought forward in support of the equation Lancelot=Lantbert? Not one. In what respect does the equation explain the story we find in the twelfth-century French poets ? In no single one. Accept every assertion of Prof. Zimmer's, and we are as far as ever from realising the nature of the Lancelot episode. For that we must turn to the scholar of whom Prof. Zim- 409</page><page sequence="24">Celtic Myth and Saga. mer speaks with an arrogance it is charitable to treat humorously, to M. Gaston Paris.' Nowhere does Prof. Zimmer explicitly state that Brit- tany, open to every wind of influence, was closed to even a breath from the older Celtdom of the British Isles. But this is implied in numberless turns of argument, which, without this implication, lose all point. Yet he himself has furnished the strongest argument against this view. In his progress through the Arthurian Walhalla he encoun- ters Tristan. The traditional view of this hero is known to all-nephew of the fifth-sixth century Cornish kinglet, Mark, rescuer of his land from the tribute laid upon it by the Irish, wooer of the Irish princess Iseult for his uncle, and, as her lover, the most famous exemplar of over- mastering passion in all literature. But Prof. Zimmer points out that the name of Tristan himself and of his father (Talhwch in the Welsh tradition) are Pictish, and that whilst we know of no Picts in fifth- sixth century Cornwall, we do know of several historical Drests and Drestans and Talorcs in eighth-ninth cen- tury Pictland, i.e., roughly speaking, North-East Scotland; moreover, the names of Iseult and of her kinsmen are Teutonic, and whilst there can have been no Teutonic dwellers in fifth-century Ireland, Ireland in the ninth and tenth centuries was largely occupied by Norse and Danish Vikings. History again, silent respecting any fifth-century wars between Ireland and Cornwall, has preserved a full record of several raids into Pictland made by the Danish Vikings and of the tribute they levied. Prof. Zimmer reasons that the historical basis of the Tristan story is furnished by the exploits of a ninth-century Pictish hero who signalised himself in the wars against the Dublin Vikings. He conjectures that the story first became known in South Britain after the Conqueror's expedition against Malcolm in I072, was disseminated through South Wales in the expeditions of 1072 and Io8i, passed into 1 Romania, vol. x. 410</page><page sequence="25">Celtic Myth and Saga. Brittany, where it was profoundly modified, Tristan being provided with a Breton parentage and home, and where in all probability it was worked into the Arthur saga. Such is a very bare summary of this brilliant and fasci- nating hypothesis. I must leave the criticism of it to those who are more familiar than I am with the oldest French forms of the Tristan story. I would merely note that evidence, which Prof. Zimmer himself quotes, shows that the saga must have been current in Wales before Io8I, and probably before 1072. Moreover, that no light is thrown upon the curious Welsh traditions concerning Tristan, traditions which cannot either be explained from the French romances. But let us accept his results and see what bearing they have upon his general theory of the Arthurian romance. Here is a story, originating in these islands, unknown in Brittany before the close of the eleventh century, and yet the oldest French forms are Breton in locale and characterisation of the personages. What reliance then can be placed upon Breton traits in other branches of the romances as evidence of their spe- cific Breton and non-insular origin ? What has happened once may have happened more than once-the early spe- cific Breton lais to which Prof. Zimmer traces back the French romances may be, as he himself claims that the Tristan lais are, mere Bretonised variants of insular originals. Thus whilst admitting in a very large measure the validity of Prof. Zimmer's claims on behalf of the Breton element in the formation of the Arthurian romance, I cannot but think that he has often misinterpreted the nature of that element, that he has exaggerated the con- sequences to be drawn from the facts he has stated, and that he has unduly depreciated the influence of the insular element. Be this, however, as it may, the services he has rendered to the study of the cycle are of extreme value, and for years to come his investigations must form the basis of further research. 4II</page><page sequence="26">Celtic Myth and Saga. It is interesting to pass from Prof. Zimmer to Prof. Rhys. No two scholars could be well more unlike in certain respects; both are equally penetrating and suggestive, in both, not infrequently, their very ingenuity makes them bad guides for the layman. The German, as he himself says, has a horror of the mazy whirlings of comparative myth- ology; no one threads these mazes with greater boldness or delight than the Welshman. The German is anxious to place every text, and every line of every text, and every word of every line, in its precise historical environment; it is often impossible to glean from the Welshman any opinion concerning the origin and date of composition of the text upon which he relies. It cannot be denied that by the historical method alone can we ultimately hope to gain a clear and orderly view of Celtic mythic literature as a whole, but when we have reached that view it will be found, I believe, that Prof. Rhys has often penetrated to the heart of the subject by a process that looks like guess- work, chiefly because the results only, and not the steps, are exhibited to us. In the Oxford professor's Arthurian Studies the defects of his method are more apparent than in any other of his works. In his Hibbert Lectures he relied largely upon the early Irish sagas and upon the non- Arthurian Mabinogion, which bring their archaic credentials, so to say, with them; in the present volume he uses the Arthurian Welsh tales, the sixth-thirteenth century Welsh poetry, and the Welsh triadic literature. Discussion is still rife respecting the origin and nature of these three groups of texts; the least, it would seem, we had a right to expect from perhaps the only man who can give a sound guess at what much of the early Welsh poetry means, is that he should state a working theory respecting this and the other literature upon which he bases his arguments. As if to complete the reader's dissatisfaction, he is told in the preface that "many things would have been handled differently had Prof. Zimmer's studies appeared earlier". What things? Possibly some of the points 412</page><page sequence="27">Celtic Myth and Saga. upon which the author has lavished most ingenuity and trouble. It is natural that this candour on Prof. Rhys's part should have greatly disconcerted his critics, and that practically his work should have been put on one side. Yet I am convinced that never have a larger number of pregnant suggestions with regard to the Arthurian romance been brought together than in these pages. But it requires a trained and critical spirit to turn them to account. As it is impossible to criticise any of Prof. Rhys's theories without going into those questions of date and origin of documents which he passes over almost entirely, I propose to show how others have dealt with these questions, and then to note the relation of Prof. Rhys's views to their theories. Prof. Zimmer, we have seen, is concerned with the immediate rather than with the ultimate origin of the French Arthurian literature; as regards the Welsh Arthu- rian texts he is content to show that many of them cannot have been written, as we possess them, before the twelfth century. In respect of the old Welsh poetry nothing has been done by way of criticism, nothing, outside Prof. Rhys's studies, by way of exegesis. In respect of the A/Iabinogion proper nothing fresh has been done in so far as they interest the folk-lorist. It is in respect of the Arthurian Welsh tales that criticism has been active, especially in respect of the three which are undoubtedly connected in some way with the poems of Crestien de Troies. In my last report I noted Herr Othmer's attempt to prove that the tale of Geraint and Enid is a mere abridged translation of the Frenchman's Erec. Since then M. Gaston Paris has gone over the same ground (Romania, Oct. I891), and has shown most convincingly that Herr Othmer is wrong, and that the Welsh tale frequently represents a more archaic stage of the story than the French poem. Herr Golther has endeavoured to traverse M. Paris's conclusions, but has merely succeeded in showing 4I3</page><page sequence="28">Celtic Mythk and Saga. how difficult it is for some scholars to retreat from a posi- tion they have once taken up. An unexpected contribution has been made to the Peredur question by a young German scholar, Dr. Paul Hagen, writing in Germania. Readers of my Grail legend may recollect that I claimed this Welsh tale as representing, in part, a purer version of one of the motifs worked into the Conte del Graal of Crestien de Troies, but contaminated with incidents and passages derived from that poem. For this I was taken to task by Dr. Golther, who asserted the entire dependence of the Welsh tale upon the French poem. I may fairly claim to have disproved this assertion,1 which is indeed absolutely untenable. Dr. Hagen brings forward fresh arguments in disproof of Dr. Golther's theory, and is indeed quite at one with me respecting the anteriority of the Welsh tale. But according to him it is the homogeneous adaptation of a pre-Crestien French work based upon Breton lais and prose tales, which also served as the main source both of Crestien and of the lost French original of Wolfram von Eschenbach. The difficulty lies, it will be seen, in the fact that Welsh and French texts have features in common which point to a definite literary connection. I explain these features as due to the influence of the French poem upon an already existing Welsh tale; Dr. Hagen, as due to derivation from a common original. I fully see the difficulties of my ex- planation, and I grant that Dr. Hagen has criticised it acutely and vigorously. But destructive criticism is no- where easier than in dealing with this inextricably tangled literature. The difficulty is to construct a theory that will fairly fit the facts. Has Dr. Hagen fully reasoned out his theory ? I doubt it. We both agree that the Welsh tale must belong to an earlier stage than the French poem, because it gives in orderly and coherent sequence incidents of which a shadowy jumble is all that exists in French. 1 In the already cited article, Revue Celtique, April 891 ; FOLK- LORE, June I891. 414</page><page sequence="29">Celt/c Myt/ and Saga. From this jumble, as we find it in Crestien and his con- tinuators, we can pick out a story akin to, but not identical writh that in the Welsh work. But if Crestien had the hypothetical original of Peredur before him, how comes his own narrative to be so confused and unintelligible; how is it in especial that his continuators go off on half-a-dozen different tracks ? Did they know nothing of this original ? If not, how comes it that portions of it are to be recovered from them alone, there being nothing in Crestien's portion of the Conte del Graal that could give rise to them ? More- over, the Welsh tale contains incidents (to one of which the only known parallel is in the eighth-ninth century Irish Voyage of Mael Duin) which are absolutely unknown to any existing French romance. Would this be the case if it represented the original of such a famous work as the Conte del Graal? I sincerely welcome Dr. Hagen as a fellow-worker in this obscure field of literary history, but I cannot admit that he has convinced me as yet, and I still hold to my explanation of the Peredur problem, namely, that the Welsh tale is in the main the oldest extant form of the Perceval story, but that, as it has come down to us, it is comparatively late (say 1230-50), and has been in- fluenced by the writings of the leading European poet of the twelfth century. Now how does Prof. Rhys stand with regard to these questions? He analyses the stories of Owain and Peredur minutely (chapters iv, v), and resolves them into variant versions of a nature-myth, an Irish analogue to which he finds in the dealings of Cuchulainn with the Morrigu. But to do this he is obliged to have recourse to considerable modification of the stories in their present form, and he justifies such modification on the ground that the Welsh versions have been influenced by the French ones. In so far he countenances those who contend for the secondary nature of these two Welsh tales. But it will be admitted, I think, that it is perilous in the extreme to postulate modification save when it is vouched for by positive and 4I5</page><page sequence="30">Cellic Myth and Saga. unmistakable facts, and to rely upon any mythological theory that does not arise naturally and unforcedly out of the documents. In this case too, the myth, as reconstructed by Prof. Rhys, is open to grave objection from the side of the orthodox nature-mythologists. Prof. Rhys has further embarrassed himself by what I cannot but regard as a wholly chimerical attempt to equate the Lancelot story, as we find it in Crestien, with his hypothetical Peredur- Owain story. I would further urge that the endeavour to find, not a Celtic basis, but a basis in the existing scanty remains of Celtic literature for all the leading situations and motifs in the gigantic mass of French Arthurian literature must necessarily result in strained interpretation. It can hardly be doubted that we do not possess even one tithe of the Brythonic story-hoard. It would be an amazing coincidence if all that is Celtic in the French Arthurian romances went back precisely to that tithe. Yet I for one cannot regret that Prof. Rhys should have apparently acted upon this coincidence theory; it has led him to strain every nerve to identify stories which I believe to have little in common, but in so doing he has accumulated such a number of interesting and indubitable minor parallels between the person- and place-names of genuine Welsh tradition and those of French Arthurian romance as to place the Brythonic origin of the latter beyond all possibility of doubt. Prof. Rhys is largely concerned with the Grail. Here he is supplemented by Prof. Heinzel of Vienna, whose work, quoted at the head of this article, is by far the most searching, minute, and erudite examination of the French Grail romances that has yet appeared. Prof. Heinzel displays in this work all that penetration, that sanity, and that rigorously scientific method that have won him so much credit in the field of Teutonic mythology and saga. Those who are familiar with his previous researches will know that any opinion of his is entitled to the most respectful consideration. 416</page><page sequence="31">Celtic Myth and Saga. 417 Now Prof Heinzel's work is revolutionary. To make this plain I must hark back a little. In common with all previous investigators I recognised two main sections of the Grail story, one dealing with its early history in the East and with its passage to Britain, the other with its Quest. Of the Quest I distinguished two forms, one having Perceval, the other Galahad for its hero. I urged that the Quest section is the older of the two, and of the Quest section the Perceval form. For me Crestien's portion of the Conte del Graal was not only the oldest existing text of the whole cycle, but the oldest French version of any part of it. For me the Galahad forms of the Quest were not only younger than, but arose directly out of the Perceval ones. Such criticism as I received-e.g., from M. MuretinJMe Isine-was for having attached so much import- ance as I did to the Galahad forms, or, e.g., from Dr. Golther, for not having more clearly recognised that Crestien was thefons et origo of all the other Quest forms. What says Prof. Heinzel? That the Early History is really the oldest part of the legend which was originally one of the conversion of Britain, that the Quest is an afterthought, that Galahad was the first hero of the Quest, that Crestien's version presupposes a narrative akin to that found in the Queste del St. Graal and in Robert de Borron's Joseph, and that the contamination of the original purely Christian legend with Celtic fairy-tale incidents was probably begun in Crestien's source, and was further carried on by the great French poet. Having, in common with all other investigators, recog- nised the Perceval story as the kernel of the Grail legend, I had little difficulty in proving its essentially Celtic nature. Prof. Heinzel does not challenge my proof; he merely contends that I deal, not with the real Grail legend, but with late and comparatively speaking unimportant accre- tions to it. Results such as these, which conflict with those of all previous investigators, may fairly be described as revolu- VOL. III. E E</page><page sequence="32">4I8 Celtic yyth and Saga. tionary. They presuppose that in a vast body of literature the oldest existing text really belongs to almost the latest stage of development; that the later texts, although un- noticed anywhere, must really have existed in some form long previously; and that in the twelfth century a purely Christian subject was almost entirely de-Christianised, precisely in the actual oldest but hypothetically youngest text, whilst the later ones, hitherto regarded as later in origin as well as in date of composition, show a steadily increasing Christian element. I cannot criticise these views in detail. An indispensable preliminary is a methodical re-examination of the entire Grail literature, and the testing of every point urged by Prof. Heinzel.' Until I have been able to do this I prefer simply to direct the attention of all students to his work. I may, however, note one or two points. Prof. Heinzel confines himself to the French romances; neither the Peredur, nor the English Sir Perceval, nor Wolfram's version is examined with any thoroughness. Yet it is precisely from these outside versions that light is, I believe, to be obtained respecting the early form of the legend. Prof. Heinzel confirms indirectly, but in the strongest way, my contention that the Early History of the Grail, being as it is a conversion of Britain legend, is essentially a British product. Though we only possess it in a French dress, it must have originated and been developed in Britain. Turn we now to Prof. Rhys's Grail studies. I had busied myself exclusively with establishing the Celtic nature of the Perceval portion of the legend, deeming, as I did, the Galahad portion to be derived and secondary. 1 Prof. Heinzel's method of presenting his results is stimulating but arduous. He examines each version by itself, so that one has to consider some twenty pieces of independent investigation, to determine for oneself their relation to each other, and then to recheck the whole by the texts. I may add that one has to make one's own index and analytical summary.</page><page sequence="33">Celtic Myth and Saga. But it is from the Galahad portion that Prof. Rhys chiefly draws his parallels to Welsh tradition. The importance of this for the Celtic origin of the legend is, in view of Prof. Heinzel's conclusions, obvious. Even if the latter is right, and if the most Christianised and apparently latest portion of the legend is in reality the oldest, there are still Prof. Rhys's parallels to be reckoned with. I may say that renewed familiarity with Malory, due to a careful study of Dr. Sommer's third volume, had pre- viously convinced me that I had unduly neglected the Galahad portion of the legend. From this, however, to accepting the position definitely stated by Prof. Heinzel, and practically taken up (in complete independence of Prof. Heinzel's researches) by Prof. Rhys, is a wide step, and one which I doubt I shall ever take. But, for reasons already given, I defer any definite statement of my views for the present. As regards Prof. Rhys in particular, I must confess my scepticism respecting the myth he has wrung out of the romances. The point is worth detailed examination, both as exemplifying the methods of Professors Heinzel and Rhys, and the fascinating obscurity of the Grail problem. Great stress is laid in nearly all versions of the legend upon the effect produced upon a particular country (some- times England, sometimes an undetermined district) either by the success of the Grail Quester, or by his failure at first. The effect is either, definitely, the restoration of the land to fertility, or, indefinitely, the removal of enchant- ments that lay upon it. In some versions the waste con- dition of the land is apparently only due to the first failure of the Grail Quester to achieve success, in the majority it is the result of previous conflict between personages who are in general related to the Grail Quester. This second form is commonly known as the "Dolorous Stroke", and a variant version of the incident is found in Arthurian romance in the story of Balin and Balan, entirely discon- nected with the Grail legend. Prof. Rhys equates the EE2 4I9</page><page sequence="34">Celtic Myth and Sag-a. whole with incidents detailed in the Mabinogion of Pwyll and of Manawyddan. We have here a conflict between Pwyll, Pryderi, and Manawyddan on the one hand, and Gwawl son of Clud and Llwyd son of Kil-coed on the other. Pwyll had played upon Gwawl the trick of the badger in the bag; this is avenged by Llwyd, who brings desolation upon the land of Pryderi, Pwyll's son, but Llwyd is finally baffled by Manawyddan, who undoes all his spells. Prof. Rhys is compelled to assume that his Brythonic mythologists took the wrong side, mythologically speaking. For his Gwawl and Llwyd are divinities of light, his Pwyll and Manawyddan dark divinities. To cite his own sum- ming up of the myth, "this sequence carries with it the reversal of the true meaning of the action of the respective parties in the struggle. For the appearance of the realm as a wilderness is its true aspect, with its hideousness exposed in the light of Llwyd's triumphing countenance. The removal of the Enchantment, so as to make the landscape seem to teem again with life and abundance, is more truly to put the Enchantment on it. It is, in a word, to bring on the glamour and illusion which are essential to the magnificence in which the King of the Otherworld reigns." I can understand such a simple myth as that which pic- tures the sun-hero dispelling the glamour of night, and I believe that in the visit of the Grail Quester to the Magic Castle we have a late and romanticised version of such a myth. But I am not prepared to go further. How does Prof. Heinzel deal with this element in the romance ? The legend has its origin, for him, in an account of the conversion of Britain by certain personages of the Apostolic age bringing with them relics of Christ. These are kept by the first Grail possessor for his future successor, son or grandson, who is to make himself known by putting certain questions. But this was too simple for the romance writers, who started the idea of making the Grail Quester 420</page><page sequence="35">Cel/ic Myth and Saga. omit the questions at first. Meanwhile the original Grail possessor had become known as the Fisher King, an epithet due entirely to Christian symbolism. But the name being misunderstood, it was assumed that he fished because he was ill. Hence arose the idea of the first Grail possessor, to be cured by the questions put by the last Grail possessor, the hero of the Grail Quest. The idea of illness was further intensified by that of great age, due to the interpolation of a long row of kings between the first and last Grail possessors. To account for the illness the Grail king was supposed to have been wounded. So far the development need not presuppose any foreign element. But Prof. Heinzel admits that at this stage such a foreign element was brought into the legend in the shape of a story telling how the murder of a hero's kinsman brought desolation upon his land, desolation which could only be removed when the hero had wrought vengeance upon his kinsman's slayer. This unnamed hero was identified with the Grail Quester, the wounded kinsman with the Grail king, and the narrative assumed such shape as we find in the present romances. It is sufficient to note that Prof. Heinzel, who maintains so strongly the essential Christian nature of the Grail legend, is constrained to recognise that an important and obviously archaic incident owes nothing to Christian sources. It seems to me that differ between themselves as do Professors Rhys and Heinzel, and differ as both do from my printed conclusions, yet there is at bottom con- siderable agreement between us, testifying to the essentially Celtic nature of the most archaic portions of the Grail cycle. I must briefly notice Prof. Heinzel's explanation of the name of Bron, the first Grail keeper in Robert de Borron. Among the companions of Joseph was the Veronica, the owner of the portrait of Christ. Early Christian legend made of her a Phcenician Mary, in French, Marie la Venissienne, a corrupt form of which, M. l'Anjuzcienne, originated the name Enygeus, Eniseus, 421</page><page sequence="36">Celtic Myth and Saga. given to Joseph's sister and Bron's wife. Her other appellation, mulier Veronica, was taken as "femme d'Ebron", whence by misinterpretation "femme de Bron", and she was thus provided with a husband named Bron (or, in some texts, Hebron). This Bron probably represents Nicodemus, who is connected with the evangelisation of Britain, though indirectly, by the early knowledge in this country of the apocryphal gospel devoted to him, and who plays a part in the oldest texts of the Early History section of the Grail legend. Prof. Heinzel is at some pains to demonstrate that this discovery ruins my theory of the relation between Bron and Bran the Blessed of Welsh tradition. But I submit that all depends upon the date of the process he assumes. This must be much older than Robert de Borron (end of twelfth century), seeing that Robert mentions Enygeus, the Veronica, and Mary the Egyptian as three distinct personages, clear proof that the corruption which Prof. Heinzel thinks he has detected was then of old standing. Moreover, Prof. Heinzel conjectures that the epithet "blessed" assigned to the Welsh Bran may be due to the Bron story. If this is so it is another proof that Bron must be much older than Robert de Borron. For Robert's version of the Grail legend is entirely unknown in Wales, and the two French Grail romances translated into Welsh (the Queste, and the prose Perlesvans) know nothing of Bron and of his companions. Moreover, the mere simi- larity of name between Bron and Bran can hardly be deemed sufficient ground for the Welsh story-tellers to have decorated their old god (for such Bran is-his legend, save for this possible epithet, is absolutely untouched by Christianity) with a standing epithet derived from the Christian missionary. There must have been some simi- larity of attribute or condition, more than which I have never postulated. Indeed, I think that the epithet (pre- Christian in Bran's case) is the first and only link between the two personages. In any case Prof. Heinzel's theory 422</page><page sequence="37">Celtic Myth and Saga. throws back Bron considerably, and enhances his import- ance in the conversion of Britain legend, thus, to my mind, confirming rather than invalidating my hypothesis of an early confusion between Bron and Bran as one of the chief factors in the genesis of the Grail legend. One point is well brought out in Prof. Rhys's studies, the close connection between Brythonic and Gaelic romance. Many of his most suggestive parallels involve Irish or North-Scotch influence upon the Arthurian romances. This is a theory I have always steadily advocated in these pages, and I am glad to find that such a cautious scholar as Mons. Gaidoz gives it the full weight of his support in a recent number of Jfelusine. At the back of all the questions connected with the assumed mythological texts of the Welsh and Bretons lies that of the condition of Britain during and immedi- ately after the Roman occupation. M. Loth has striven to elucidate this by an examination of the words which the Brythonic languages have borrowed from Latin. His con- clusions are most interesting. He maintains that outside a line drawn between Caerleon on Usk and York, passing by Chester, Roman influence was but little felt, that the Welsh laws of the tenth century in which the social organisation is still tribal, in which legal theory is still based upon composition, represent an unbroken tradition reaching back to pre-Roman times. Only in respect of the class of villeins (taeog) do Roman ideas make them- selves felt; taeog organisation is obviously based upon that applied to the Roman colonus. Considering the totality of Latin loan-words, M. Loth shows that material life among the pre-Roman Britains was rudimentary, all terms relating to building and domestic industry being borrowed; family life was probably communistic, as the words for "husband" and "wife" are borrowed; the medium of exchange was cattle, the Breton term for which is a loan from the Latin soldus; terms relating to reading and writing are borrowed, but those 423</page><page sequence="38">Celtic My/t and Saga. relating to poetry and music are purely Celtic; little has been borrowed in the domain of political organisation, Welsh legal terminology in particular, which is singularly rich and precise, being almost untouched by Latin influence. If I mistake not, nothing in M. Loth's results stands in the way of our believing that the Brythons, whether in England or Brittany, retained many fragments of their pre-Christian beliefs, which fragments have been preserved to us partly by purely Welsh tales and poems, partly by French adaptations of Brythonic stories, derived mostly, though probably not entirely, from Brittany. The mythology which we can reconstruct from these fragments stands in as close relation to that of the Irish Gaels as do the Welsh and Irish laws. Critical questions have occupied the larger part of this report. But this is a sign that the study of Celtic antiquity has definitely entered a new and fruitful stage. Publi- cation has advanced sufficiently to give scholars a fair basis to build upon, but the perfect building cannot be expected just yet. One thing is certain. Some respect- able traditional views may have to vanish. But free criticism will enhance and not diminish the value of what remains to us of Celtic thought and fancy. Nor will it, I believe, do other than confirm the theory that the beliefs and practices and sayings of pre-Christian Celtdom are largely represented both in pre-mediaeval and mediaeval Celtic literature, and in the folk-lore of the living Celtic- speaking peoples.
