<plain_text><page sequence="1">ITALIA ^ETERNA Unlike a woman, a country must be known if we are to love her, her past as well as her present, what we do not see as well as what we see. It is, to be sure, a delight to come upon the wonder unexpectedly, staring with a wild surmise. But that is a melodramatic sensation ; and such effects the Master of the Show wherein we play a part must, without pausing in his continuous performance to consider, surely disdain after all his triumphs. For these there were preparations, and we foresaw (though but darkly) what we saw. The highest love, the sages have said, is half a memory; but love for a country is an abstracter process, and to it the past is still more than the pres ent, and memory and dreaming than vision. Even our own coun try, and no inconsiderable number of beings in it, must not seem to us merely what they are. Truth, it has been said, is sad. America and Australia, for that matter, Shasta and Popo catapetl, are older than Rome or Babylon (if indeed any one thing be older than another); but the eye swims and loses itself as it gazes into the heavens or over prairie or sea, and ap proaches a perception of the boundless only as it follows the flight of a bird or a sail, or wanders down an avenue or a colon nade. It craves a foreground, a nearer and a middle distance. So we have more of a feeling for a vast stretch of time when we view the famous ruin, or look upon the waters, still flowing, of Tiber or Bandusia? flumina nota Et fonds sacros. The Mississippi and the Niagara have rolled or tumbled down, as it were, in the void, unknown, unsung; and a million years are scarcely more to us than a thousand, save as we discern some familiar figure?Caesar, Alexander, even Nebuchadnez zar?along their course. So Como is older and lovelier to us because of Virgil, who praised it; and the Lake of Garda, because of a poet who not only praised it but dwelt there, grieving for his brother. For only what is human or mortal can touch us, and only what touches us can prompt us to peer beyond.</page><page sequence="2">268 The Sewanee Review Here, however, we need not depend on memory quite so much: that is part of the charm of Italy as compared with Palestine. Imagination craves a visible and tangible point d'appui: meditation, a point of departure. Bridges and aque ducts?the water that has passed under or through them ! Walls and columns, arches and arcades?the shadows that they have cast and lost ! And the roads laid by Romans and Carthaginians, Sabines and Volscians, victors and captives, the famous as well as the nameless, and trodden by them?all down into the gulf! What toil?our bones ache at the thought of it?though their days, no doubt, it made not long enough ! Towns are perched? in the Middle Ages and Roman times for safety's sake?on the top of mountains, whither and whence everything has, afoot or on muleback, to be carried; and as the archaeologists have dis covered, they often stand on remains of an earlier town, and these?oh, our lives' sweetness !?on those of towns earlier still. Layer upon layer, as the human spirit aspires and earth's crust thickens! Even in his time, without our knowledge, Virgil thought of this?and all the more, therefore, we think of it now ?as he sang of "the noble cities, the achievement of man's toil, all the towns his handiwork has piled up on steepy crags, and the streams that glide beneath those ancient walls"? Adde tot egregias urbes operumque laborem, Tot congesta manu praeruptis oppida saxis Fluminaque antiquos subterlabentia muros. An old wall or tower by a river,?what is more beautiful, or more directly tells the story of man's toil and transitoriness and the long silent lapse of time! Below me a bridge, built, they say, by Hannibal, rears its back, humped high to escape the torrent, over a road, the river having, in mute millennial irony, left it in the lurch. And the terraces, climbing up the hills and mountains like a cyclops' staircase, are faced with stones worn and wasted, themselves turning at last, like (long ago) the hands that cut and laid them, into mould and soil. A bit of the story of time we can make shift to tell for ourselves when the latter end of it has been faltered out by a shattered survivor.</page><page sequence="3">Italia ?Eterna 269 But to Nature what are our centuries and cycles, our fortunes and vicissitudes,?though this may not be easy to believe? The story is still murmuring in our ears, and we see things that are not. And this is the Mincius, still flowing, Vesuvius, still smoking! And these are the Seven Hills?as if to make sure we count them?though with no figures in toga or armor pass ing up or down! And there to the north is Soracte, snowy as when Horace pointed it out to Thaliarchus! The sun and the moon are no older, the stars have not grown dim. Was it, then, yesterday? Are two thousand years, the glory and the gran deur, and myriads upon myriads of bitter-sweet pilgrimages such as ours,?though each of these was the world and all to the man as he made it?are they but a watch in the night, a tale that is told ? What has happened ? What will be forever, What was from of old. Night has followed day and day night, winter has followed sum mer and summer winter; clouds and shadows have come and gone; the earth has stretched far as the eye could reach and the sky has bent above it. For what are we or the Romans, what are ten thousand years? Time is an illusion, not a current but an eddy, not a river but an abyss. Le temps s'en va, le temps s'en va, ma dame, Las! le temps non, mais nous, nous en allons. Here the mountains and grottoes, the streams and fountains, every rock and every nook and the very winds of heaven bear names, and like the cypress and the poplar, the ilex and the tamarisk, the olive and the almond, the ivy, the laurel, the myrtle, were sacred to some deity or other once, as they are to memory and to poetry now. Here they are, and we could well believe it in the twilight. Man himself and his handiwork continue, as of Nature a part. Statues are still in the gardens? Und Marmorbilder stehn und sehn mich an? and chapels or shrines (though now not to nymph or Faunus) there or by the wayside. The oxen, with huge horns turned amicably backward or upward, are those we see in ancient</page><page sequence="4">270 The Sewanee Review reliefs and paintings; the sails on Lago Maggiore are those of the Roman triremes; the great terra cotta jars on the ter race or by the cottage were not dug up out of the earth. The very child in the street asserting itself, cries "I tell you" ? "dico"?exactly like Cicero or Caesar, a long age ago, as we must still think it, in the Capitol. Nothing changes. Totter and clay endure'?and even the form and fashion of pots. Customs have had time to change and to spare, were they not rooted in the climate and environment, and deeper than that? As in ancient days, people live in the open?in the sun (if they can) in winter, in the shade (as they may) in summer. At noon they still take the siesta, in the cool of the evening still walk the street. It is the street which everybody walks, moreover, not the byways, and when in the house they are at the window (even if about their toilet), as in a Benozzo or a Carpac cio, or peering and beckoning behind the shutter, as in a novella or romance. The tailor and his seamstresses sew by the open door, or, like the shopkeepers at Pompeii, behind a counter even with the pavement. Something to see, by Bacchus!? and they have kept even the oath! They themselves would be seen, as well, "ut videant et videantur", as Ovid said of people's going to the theatre. Often, as the stranger in the street raises his eyes, he thinks himself in one?gallery above gallery?or in the lists. He is the actor, he is the wandering knight. People live in flats, in big houses of many storeys, as at the time of Juvenal; and, as then, and for similar reasons, one must needs walk needfully below. Look might meet look, a rose fall or a handkerchief flutter, and there are direr perils. Of these last my landlord in Rome once warned me, as the Roman of old, in his third satire, does his reader. Ever since such things had been falling?through the Dark and Middle Ages, through the Renaissance?as surely, though not so incessantly, as Tiber flows. Even in the country people are for the most part huddled into villages with only steep and almost sunless alleys in between. It was for safety and company then, it is for company and be cause of old custom now. They must get together under the</page><page sequence="5">Italia Alterna 271 portico or arcade on the piazza to talk, or by the tavern to play at bowls, skittles, or morra. Their agriculture or other handiwork is changed as little, not only because of the character of the people and the climate, but because of the small scale of the culture and the roughness of the ground. To stones and terraces and a poor couple of acres modern machinery or mass-production cannot adapt itself. The old implements and methods are still in use: the two-toothed mattock (bidens), the spade, plough, and scythe, are exactly like those in the reliefs and wall-paintings. And the basins or wells of water on the mountain slopes in Italy and Provence, which feed the worn stone rills and runnels for irrigation, are as old as the terraces themselves. The frogs that I hear sing ing out of them these April nights melancholy Virgil heard. "Shut off the rills", cries Palaemon at the end of the third Eclogue:? Gaudite iam rivos : sat prata biberunjt. Like these, men's ways generally are the old ways, fit for poetry and linked to it. Their wine and oil are of the hillside; and like Horace, they eat olives and endives and mallows light, garlic too (though without the delicate poet's repenings), as well as artichokes and fennels, and cheese made from the milk of sheep and goats. The diet is of the age of gold, and the life, though not so idle, is as simple. The sower sows by hand and not with a patent drill; the fisherman in the morning spreads his white or vermilion sails like the wings of a bird above the green waters of the bay, but returns to roost at sun down; both wine-press and threshing-floor are literally trodden; and all this work, hard to do though pretty to look at, or at least to write of, is lightened by a song. The husband man still lops boughs or leaves from trees or hedges, in a land where fodder or fuel may not be wasted, keeping a good heart as in Virgil's time? Hinc alta sub rupe canet frondator ad auras : and still the shepherd or goatherd sings or pipes as he carries his crook. Even the carter fairly chants as he whoops and curses at his mules or oxen, for, like the ancient Latin, Italian speech</page><page sequence="6">272 The Sewanee Review is from song at no time far removed. The women, too, sing and chatter as they wash, like Nausica?, and her maidens, by the brook or river, or spin, knit, or make lace by the cottage door. Or bare foot and barelegged, they carry jars on their heads as in antique friezes, yet are neither proud of their limbs or gait, as they well might be, nor ashamed, as in a weak world (until quite of late) they are expected to be. Their world is older, and untroubled. So, not long since, sat a dark-skinned girl of seventeen, on a stone wall under an ilex, though without roses or vine leaves in her hair. Amaryllis herself, back from Elysium in a frock! It was her look, her voice and speech, and the very place for her too. What above all makes their life so poetical is the fact that it is rooted in the soil. Our wealth and cheap and rapid trans portation have divorced us from it; we were not born where w7e dwell to-day or shall dwell to-morrow: and our dwellings and cattle, food and garments, manners and speech, have little local character. The Italians for the most part are?despite the migrations demanded by modern industrialism?even as the poplars in Lombardy or the stone pines round about Naples. The very houses, when not stuccoed, look as if they grew out of the rock. The Tuscan drinks his own wine and eats his own bread, and builds his houses in his own way and of the stone at hand, quite differently from Neapolitan or Roman. He has great white oxen while the Roman drives stocky grey ones. The sails in the bay of Genoa are not like those off Venice. But what New York does to-day San Francisco will do to-morrow, and herds of Jerseys or Holsteins are scattered from Maine to Texas. Indiana limestone faces buildings in Philadelphia, and Philadelphia brick, buildings in Indianapolis. Even in Italy the cheapness of readymade clothing has pretty nearly effaced time-honored local differences; yet the peasants still keep sashes, earrings, and footgear, and ways of doing their hair and wearing their whiskers, that the tyranny of fashion or the crav ing for standardization cannot touch. In the towns and cities, to be sure, life is not so idyllic and na?ve; industry, if not manners, has been modernized. But in places apparently untouched by the spirit of William Morris, I have seen a joiner making a wardrobe with his own hand, and</page><page sequence="7">Italia ALterna 273 a smith fashioning a fine iron railing for a balcony. Since the war it is the rich that have changed rather than the poor. One of the glories of Rome used to be the palaces of the princely families (which date back, not to ancient times, indeed, though to the early mediaeval); but most of these are now banks or hotels, and the colonnaded and fountained courtyard, where the eye in passing loved to wander and linger, is fenced in and covered, the fountain perhaps made to play (like the orchestra) for a restaurant, and the porter, who reared himself before the entrance with mace, cocked hat, and livery, flung (like so much else, alas!) to the democratic and economic bowwows. A man with letters on his cap takes his place; men with figures in their heads take his master's. The one or the other, for the matter of that, is taking the places of us all. Other customs and manners, more personal, are as ancient. Curls and perfumes for men are in France and Italy no degenerate innovation, for by Horace and his followers they are frequently spoken of with complacence. Curls, of various length, abound on the heads of Greek and Roman statues?curls and odors, were they not for the very gods ? In themselves both are sweet to the senses, the latter more grateful in lands where (now as then) cleanliness is not next to godliness, and attractiveness and beauty are. At sixteen, even male Englishmen and Ameri cans cultivate flowing locks, and at any age, however ugly their fingers, unblushingly wear rings; but he is true Italian, the hero of Stendhal's Chartreuse de Parme, who, wounded in a duel, rushes to the mirror to see if his manly countenance has been marred. Unlike the Egyptian and the Scandinavian gods, the Greek and Roman were not only brave but beautiful. The perfumer and hair-dresser, the photographer and the jeweller, thrive in the most poverty-stricken village; and the young men take eagerly to the recent fashion of going about bareheaded. The Piazza of San Marco, by night or by day, is more like a bigballroom than ever, though now thefeminine locks are geomet rical, only the masculine flamboyant. Earrings are worn, not only by every female, big or little, rich or poor, but by fisher men and shepherds, as by the later Caesars, Shakespeare, Sid ney, and Raleigh, and the Valois and the Stuart kings. And 18</page><page sequence="8">274 The Sezvanee Review the cosmetic arts affected by Italian, French, and Spanish women, and so by women everywhere, are Roman too. Those nearest the state of nature and most blessed? with her favors are not fondest of her unamended: their gardens the Italians arrange in alleys and terraces, their strawberries they soak in sherry, and even as they tint their roses they do their ladies? cheek and chin, lips and eyelids, nails and hair. Divine dis content?nothing is more beautiful than either, neither can be beautiful enough. Old, too, and time-honored must be the Italian inn-keeper's way of mingling with the company in the dining-room and bid ding each one welcome, and perhaps clinking glasses with him; for so did hosts in Renaissance England, not only in inns but in palaces, if we are to judge by Henry VIII in fact, and by Macbeth (at the banquet) and Perdita (at the shearers' feast) in fiction. From Rome all roads lead as well as to it. "Good wine needs no bush" is a proverb, not only in England but in Italy?"il buon vino non vuol frasca"; but above many an Italian tavern door it is still needed, as it was in the Middle Ages and probably long before. Men's wearing their hats indoors and at table?lifting them as they enter or leave the dining-room?which is a custom still to be found among the lower classes, is not Roman, of course, but almost. It was done everywhere in the Middle Ages and long after, especially in winter, at a time when houses were not adequately warmed. So it is in Italian, French, and Flemish paintings of the six teenth and seventeenth centuries, on the Elizabethan stage, and in classic drama at the Com?die Fran?aise even to-day. Church and synagogue, bench and bar, senate and consistory? all the most conservative orders or professions still cling mediae vally to their headgear when at their functions or mysteries, as do the Italian bourgeois and peasant when at their ease. The Pope on his throne and the Cardinal in the chancel; honorable members in the Commons; judges, barristers, and professors, when in their gowns ;?these proudly wear their hats (or the wigs which replace them) like the humblest Dago at his board. The chief guardian of old Roman customs, however, is the church ; for while the law is essentially Roman it presents little to</page><page sequence="9">Italia ?Eterna 275 the eye. Often the pagan faith is contrasted with the Christian as a natural religion, but the Christian is in many ways only a con tinuation or development of the pagan. It is natural, too; as of old, religious festivals are celebrated as simply and univer sally as the national. Protestants are shy of the subject of reli gion, but Catholics, like pagans, speak of it freely, and though morality among them maybe separated from religion, life is not. They speak of it even merrily and lightly, like Plautus and Homer, as a Protestant with a good conscience never can. They are at ease in Zion, as are Homer and the gods themselves upon Olympus. Indeed this spirit follows the faith into distant lands?in partes infidelium,?and I know of a pious priest in America who on giving a parishioner at his earnest wish (for he was motoring) a medal of St. Christopher, patron of travellers, added that it was not good for over sixty miles an hour. This continuity is most noticeable, however, in outward form and circumstance. Relics and certain spots on the earth, into or out of which has passed virtue, as wells, tombs, and birth places, are still reverenced and kept holy, and temples or chap els are specially built for both. Flowers, incense, and candles are the chief offerings, laid before the very image or picture of the deity. Song and prayer, gesture and genuflection, procession and sacrifice, lustration and fumigation, benediction, malediction, exorcism, and these whether in church, street, or field, are the rites of worship?pagan as Brahmanism, ancient as man's uttermost hopes and fears. The very forms in the breviary for blessing the flocks and crops, and driving away pests?mice, locusts, and the like?are traditional through and through. And in most of these ceremonies the uneven numbers, three and seven, are particularly favored as those wherein the god delights?"numero deus impare gaudet". The whole conception of the service, among the common people at least, is still that of glorifying or placating the god rather than of edifying the worshippers; and prayer in distress is often with a promise attached. Vota?voti, nowadays?are an institution quite unchanged. The suppliant vows a church or chapel, so many candles or masses, or objects of gold or silver, marble or fine needle-work, to the saint, as did the</page><page sequence="10">276 The Sezvanee Review Roman temples, treasures, or victims to the god; and if need be he bids up a bit. "J'augmente", a charming daughter of Provence once said to me when I asked what she did when her prayer was not heard. And the grateful soul may do better than that, and in recognition of an answer offer the appropriate gift even if it be not vowed. As every traveller knows, the walls of pilgrimage shrines in Italy and Catholic Europe gen erally are loaded with pictures by the village artist, of dire mischances and miraculous rescues?fires, shipwrecks, runa ways, burglaries?or with silver images of the defective or wounded member cured?eye, foot, or hand, but the heart above all,?or with the crutches joyfully discarded. So the poet of Tibur, having escaped the peril of the siren Pyrrha, will, like a rescued mariner, hang up in Neptune's temple his garments and a picture? Me tabula sacer Votiva paries indicat uvida Suspendisse potenti Vestimenta maris deo. For like all amorous poets, Horace employs profanely the sacred forms. The religious custom Juvenal mentions in his twelfth satire; and Tibullus, as he prays to Isis, cries "Now aid me, goddess,?that thou canst heal saith a crowd of painted panels in thy temples". Prisoners when freed hung up their chains in the temple of Saturn; warriors, their own swords or those of the vanquished; sea-captains, the tiller or anchor of a wreck. So Lamartine's Genevi?ve, when she breaks her engage ment, "vows" all her betrothal finery upon the altar of the Virgin. Indeed, for the Italian people their religion is not only thus material and anthropomorphic, but polytheistic: by the wise the saints are supposed merely to intercede but for the multi tude they intervene. In time of need it is they who are prayed to and vowed to, not God or the Saviour. Relations with them are more intimate. Every country or town has a patron, every trade or profession, every soul. So Pallas was the guardian of Athens, and Venus of Rome; Mercury, like St. Nicholas, the patron of merchants and travellers; Diana, like St. Hubert, of</page><page sequence="11">Italia Alterna 277 hunters; Saturn, of gladiators. And readers of Homer and Virgil need not be reminded that Hera and Athena, Artemis and Apollo, had among individual mortals their special pref erences or aversions. The saint nearest in time and place is, moreover, the one most frequented and regarded. Officially St. Peter is the patron of Rome; but practically it is St. Philip Neri, a Roman, not a Hebrew, a modern, not an ancient, and one who has left relatives behind. Even the old-time practice has come down uninterrupted of giving the deity surnames and epithets, which practically results in further multiplication in the Pantheon. Prayers are uttered, and vows registered, and churches and chapels even elsewhere erected, to Our Lady of Loretto, or Santa Maria delle Grazie?dei Miracoli?of the Capitol, as if the saint were not everywhere one and the same. In ancient times it was to Jupiter Stator; Venus Erycina, Paphia, or Pandemos ; or Diana of the Ephesians. This god or saint it was that had proved efficacious, not his duplicate or counterpart elsewhere; and the imagination of the people, as of the poet, bestows a local habitation and a name. And at this place, still "at Jerusalem or on this mountain", prayer is of greater potency than at another. There, as in heaven, the god dwells and heeds. A French author of prominence, who re cently made the pilgrimage afoot, says that all the common people he talked with on the way begged him to pray for them in Rome. What is the calendar but pagan, every saint having not only his city, shrine or temple, and special individual devotees, but his day and feast, and all the events and miracles of the passion being annually repeated in mimicry like the magical rites of nature-worship? From the Saturnalia, happy festival of a god come to earth, which occurred in the latter part of December descended the custom of offering presents and good wishes? bona Saturnalia\?at Christmas or Twelfth Night; and also the masking and torch-bearing, the merrymaking in disregard of all class distinctions and many of the proprieties, which, through the ages, the Latin peoples continue to revive at Carnival. Lent seems to find its source in the Quinquatrus. And from the Lemuria, the festival in honor of the dead, came those of</page><page sequence="12">278 The Sewanee Review All Saints and All Souls, the former of which was originally placed on May 13th, the selfsame day. The culto dei morti ("worship of the dead") is too strong an expression, with flowers and lights, as for the gods or saints, is certainly of ancient origin; and the marbles and cypresses of an Italian cemetery are a tender, eerie spectacle through the night. The glow of devotion, the glimmer of memory, visibly lingers on. All in all, a St. Paul or St. Peter planted, with cross and halo, upon a Roman triumphal column, or the consecrated fabric of a church which incorporates Roman capitals or images, is not so incongruous as it seems. Like much else that we have been considering in Italy, the outward is but the inward made manifest, and there, as everywhere, the course of Nature is continuous?non facit saltum. Italy embraced Christianity as Christianity, becoming pagan, embraced Italy; and Italy rejected the Reformation because the Reformation rejected what was pagan, Italy and her works. Not so much pagan and natural as heathen some of these cus toms and practices may seem, thoroughly superstitious. But superstition is not the greatest shortcoming, and a religion truly popular and national cannot well be without it. Without the material or anthropomorphic, the local or particular, and a rite or ceremony as the avenue of approach, it is abstract, nega tive, undefined, and therefore for the simple soul hardly a religion at all. But this religion, with a comparatively recent in fusion of a deeper emotion, finer ethics, and a more definite doctrine of future happiness or unhappiness, has lasted, not two millenniums, but many. The positive, passionate elements are what is important; and, for all its materialism and superstition, this religion has supported the lives not only of the unnumbered humble and forgotten, but of Cicero and Virgil, of Dante and Giotto, as well as of St. Francis. Even Michelangelo carved crucifixes and painted altar-pieces; and as in his prolonged later years he faced death, he raised and rounded the dome of St. Peter's church without payment, for the repose of his soul. It washethat was paying : his god was not inhuman, unapproachable. Also many of the sadder and more sombre aspects of the Christian faith and practice were developments from the pagan.</page><page sequence="13">Italia Alterna 279 What are nuns but vestal virgins? And for unfaithfulness to their vows they were in the Middle Ages similarly punished, walled up as the vestals were buried alive. Penance was not an invention of the Christian sense of sin. The dies nefasti generally were days of purification. In his sixth satire Juve nal satirizes the priest of Bellona much as if he were one of Boccaccio's or Chaucer's friars playing upon the superstitious and expiatory instincts of his flock. "He bids the lady beware of September Siroccos if she do not purify herself with a hun dred eggs and present him with some old mulberry-colored, garments, in order that any great unforeseen calamity may pass into the clothes and make expiation for the entire year. In winter she will go down to the river of a morning, break the ice, and plunge three times into the Tiber, dipping her trembling head into its swirling waters; and crawling out thence naked and shivering, she will creep [Luther we remember on the Sacred Stair] with bleeding knees right across the field of Tar qu?n the proud. If the white Io shall so order, she will journey to the confines of Egypt;"?a pilgrimage, not the first or the last (witness this anno santo V) and in days when life itself was not as yet considered one. The ascetic and gloomy, however, was not from of old the main bent of the Italian spirit, nor, after two thousand years of Christianity, is it now. They shun gloom and flee to the light. Holy days are for them mostly holidays; and Carnival precedes Lent, and the frank merriment and feasting of Easter and Eas ter Monday follow the fasting and lamentations of Good Friday. To them of old time death was hideous and horrible; the bare mountains, the forest, and the sea, were not only wild but for bidding; melancholy to them was not tender and sweet, and even now the Italians are little affected by either the "meta physical" or the Romantic spirit. With a purpose ahead they may in affairs be wily and artful, but by inclination they are impulsive and communicative, and in their imaginations open and unclouded as the day. The cypress, straight and tapering as a spire amid the tilting pines and gnarled and twisted figs and olives, cool and dark against the blossoms of peach or almond or by the marble staircase, is for us northerners a rare and par</page><page sequence="14">28o The Sezvanee Review ticular delight; but to the ordinary Proven?al or Italian it is hateful and ghastly, as it was to Flaccus and his friends:? All the year long at the villa, nothing to see though you linger, Except yon cypress that points like death's lean lifted forefinger. For us, too, it means death, though not the cemetery; but even so, for our subdued and devious spirits (and for those of some cultivated Italians no doubt as well) it adds a charm of contrast, not only in line and color, but in meaning. We look before and after, and admit the shadow into the picture. This frankness and directness of the Italian spirit and temper appears (as indeed we have seen already) on every hand. The outward is the sign of the inward, and the inward, hidden in the north, here comes to light. Expression is as necessary to these people as breathing; and as Donne said of his lady, their bodies think, their thoughts are embodied. Their speech is a cry or a song, their attitudes are pictures. Shame is not their prime virtue (nor in Roman times was it), as the Goths and Scythians of to-day indignantly notice in the streets. Silence, quiescence, continence they know not. They have a word, a gesture, a look, and sometimes all three together, for moments when the Anglo Saxon (he thanks God) has nothing at all. They smile and laugh, sing and go half-naked, stare and com ment, and {chose terrible^ point, like the children that they are. If a secret is to be kept it will not be, at any rate, by their holding their tongues; and if love be the secret, who can keep it here? In the north, woman, however talkative, is at the supreme moment well-nigh mute, "her whitest arms in silence clinging": the Italian or Proven?al maiden, I dare say, twitters and carols like a bird on the bough,? Verbosa gaudet Venus loquella? or "laughs with insatiable lips". Of love and laughter together Venus was the goddess. Song and dance then, as in a play or opera, are her natural expression. Unlike Jessica (who was English, little Jewish, and Venetian not at all) she is ever merry when she hears sweet music; and she makes it, too, not only the expressive but the imitative instincts within her being strong. Publicity she would not shun. Bridal pairs in Italy</page><page sequence="15">Italia Alterna 281 and France open-heartedly court it, and drive to the Mayor's office and the sanctuary, andthen to the photographer's, either in a white carriage?like a child's hearse?or with white rib bons festooned about the coach-man's whip, that they may receive sympathy and homage ail the way. In the villages the procession goes afoot, with fiddlers on before. The English or American bride, on the other hand,?until of late?was pale and blushing, sometimes fainted, did not appear in public after the wedding announcement until the moment of the ceremony, and then at once fled away amid strangers, who did not know, and to the bosom of Nature, who neither grins nor winks. It was in Italy, as we all know, that the Renaissance came about, the discovery again of beauty in the human body?in this mortal world?and the birth of a new courage, not of con victions, but of instincts. Not from afar had it to come: and a natural religion, close to earth and to us who are (bewil deredly, but everlastingly) tethered on it, has its advantages, not in art only but in life. The Vestal Virgins having by the young men been corrupted, the Senate, knowing not what coun sel to take, consulted the Sibylline books, and found themselves there bidden to raise a temple to Venus Verticordia, that she might turn the hearts of the youth to virtue. Rather it should have been Diana, many moderns would think, goddess of chastity, or Minerva, dread virgin goddess of wisdom. But not so would think a wise parish priest and confessor even to-day, for all his celibacy, or Cicero, who praised the life secundum Naturam. She with success cannot be contradicted, with safety cannot be withstood. Love conquers all, sang the greatest and purest of Latin poets, let us too yield to love,? Omnia vincit amor : et nos cedamus amori. Weakness it may seem, but in such weakness is strength, though it be not thought such ; only love weans and leads youth away from fleshliness, only the appropriate higher passion from any vice. Will-power represses, inhibits, but not for long, particularly in the South;?there they yield to love, joyfully embrace the life from which is no escaping, and paint pictures and mould statues that are both naked and noble;?and only the</page><page sequence="16">282 The Sewanee Reviezv higher passion can envelop and absorb the brute instinct, and thus effectually control it. According to the sweet wisdom of the elder world, in Iraly still followed and perhaps remembered, not abstinence but temperance is virtue; and like running water, nature purifies herself. Is it not so, indeed, that through all the animal excesses of the past they as a people have kept their soul?and shared it, to their own and the world's delight? This, or the like of it, Italians may know or remember, not Italy. It is better so; for a people conscious is still more unpleasant than a person. Yet one thing Italy does remember (here we quit our dreaming and see her as she is), and that is the Empire.* It is in the newspapers, the proclamations and manifestoes of authorities and parties, the anniversary celebra tions, the private talk and public speeches of the leaders. And in none of the allied countries is so much still said of Victory, though in looking, not backward, but ahead. Loaded with taxes, and faced by debts for which she has not yet been taxed, she dreams as the lira crumbles, of power and expansion. Her mission, her place in the sun, her true and sacred confines?all the late dreams of Germany spring and blossom in her bosom afresh, and the lean kine of Machiavelli's counsels devour (if really they ever show their heads) all the fat ones of Bentham and Mr. Norman Angel?. With the passion that will have it both ways, Italy, like Germany thinking of the past, calls herself ancient, and like Germany thinking of the future, calls herself new and youthful,?if we may call it thinking. She is, like Germany, fast becoming a cult, being both worshipper and worshipped. A people with a mission?from both it and them, O Lord, we beseech thee to save us! At break of day the fascisti pull on their shirts and raise the chant and ensign. The generalissimo of the Italians bears about with him the title Duke of Victory, their admiral is Duke of the Sea. Re Vittorioso (with an exultant pun upon his name) is everywhere the legend under the king's picture. In nis fantastic temple of victory, on *The present article, as the reader will of himself have observed was writ ten nearly two years ago. Since then Italy has given still other signs of this aspiring, not to say menacing, spirit.</page><page sequence="17">Italia Alte7'?ia 283 the Lago di Garda, their poet, who for a moment held Fiume against the world, has, with acolytes and satellites, stationed himself to guard the trophies or votive offerings of the war, to feed and fan the sacred fire. But the "altar of the country", as it is called, is the high-piled tomb of Victor Emmanuel II, in the heart of the Eternal City; and the French pilgrim men tioned above, witnessed in the young Italians bowed rounda bout it the authentic tokens of patriotic passion and consecrated fervor. It is the tomb of a Saint?like that of Napoleon and of Lenin, Saints not in Heaven. And only the other day, on the occasion of the present king's jubilee, Signor Mussolini (who should know) solemnly declared that "the Italy of to-day, our Italy, the Italy of our generation, is athirst for glory and power." Glory, that word which some people have happily now almost forgotten, still in Italian newspapers, and party manifestoes, and political speeches, abounds. It is not all Ital ian effervescence and romantic fervor, not all idle word and ges ture: "peacefully", the leaders say, "if it may be, if not, by force." Whom the gods would destroy they exalt?from their mission, we beseech Thee, save them! History is not for a people itself, it would seem, German or Italian; the great days, if Italy only knew it, were not those of the Empire; and to gain the whole world (if it can) what shall it profit even a people? What of old did it profit this? Elmer Edgar Stoll. University of Minnesota.</page></plain_text>
