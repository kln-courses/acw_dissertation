Thom Motorcycle Accident Research University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA ABSTRACT Debilitating leg injuries are a common outcome of motorcycle accidents, yet debate over the potential benefits and hazards of providing "leg protec- tion space" on motorcycles continues. Detailed reconstruction of motorcycle accidents reveals actual collision per- formance of contemporary crashbars and motorcyclist leg injury mechanisms. Nine hundred motorcycle accident in- depth investigation cases were reviewed and a detailed analysis of the crashbar equipped motorcycles was performed. Crashbar design, collision performance and the relation to leg injuries were determined. Results are used to evaluate actual collision performance of contem- porary crashbars and examine counter- measures for motorcyclist leg injuries. INJURIES TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES are the most common outcome of motor- cycle accidents, outnumbering injuries to any other body region [1-4]*. The majority of leg injuries are minor or moderate in severity (AIS1,2). Even leaving aside the minor and moderate level injuries, serious leg injuries are more frequent than serious injuries to the rest of the body. Because so many of these injured motorcyclists are young, not well educated and uninsured, the cost of serious leg injuries to society as well as the motorcyclist is high. Obviously, reducing this toll would be desirable, and considerable research effort has * Numbers in brackets designate references at end of paper. been directed toward this end. The simplest and principal means tested to date for reducing leg injuries has been to attach some kind of rigid structure to the motorcycle that surrounds the legs to prevent or reduce blows in a collision. The earliest such structure was the crashbar patented by Harley in 1934 [5]. Contemporary crashbars are essentially similar to those patented by Harley in the 1930fs. Contemporary crashbars are typically made of tubular steel about 1 to 1 1/4 inches O.D. and about 1/10 inch thick. They are generally about 28 inches wide at the widest point and project varying distances beyond the lateral aspect of the engine. Front crashbars are mounted just forward of the engine, while rear crashbars are mounted slightly behind the motor- cyclist's legs. Figure 1 shows typical front and rear crashbar structures. Early crash test studies by Both- well and his associates [6,7] showed that contemporary crashbars were in- effective and possibly even hazardous. In frontal impacts the anthropomorphic dummy struck its legs against the crash- bars, and in other impacts the crashbars simply collapsed when impacted by an automobile or barrier, allowing the leg to be crushed. Subsequent crash test studies by a variety of researchers [8-14] have gone on from this initial finding, pro- ceeding with two critical assumptions. The first assumption is that con- temporary crashbars simply are not strong enough to preserve the leg space in most accidents. Therefore, the crashbar collapses, the leg space is violated by some intruding object and leg is struck and injured. The solution proposed has been to make the leg pro- tection devices sturdier and less likely 2.829 0096-736X/88/9602-0829$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">to collapse when impacted, and thereby prevent leg injury. The second assumption is that the legs remain inside the protection zone, at least during the critical phases of the collision. This assumption has been questioned since many laboratory crash test films show the legs coming out of the protection zone at some point in the collision sequence. Comprehensive accident investigation data [2] show that about 90% of riders separated from the motorcycle at some point in the collision sequence. These assumptions raise a number of questions : 1) What are the mechanisms of serious leg injuries? 2) Do most serious leg injuries occur when the crashbar collapses under impact loading? 3) Do serious leg injuries occur even when the crashbar holds up well? 4) How is crashbar strength re- lated to leg space preser- vation, and how is that related to leg injuries? 5) Do the legs remain within the protection region or do they flail out and impact other hazards? 6) How often does entrapment and crushing occur? 7) What accident characteristics affect crashbar effectiveness? Considerable research effort has been devoted to the development and testing of more rigid structures attached to the motorcycle to reduce leg injuries. Yet it seems that little attention has been devoted to deter- mining first just how leg injuries actually occur in motorcycle accidents or how they are related to contemporary crashbar structures. The purpose of this paper is to provide a closer exam- ination of the mechanisms of leg injury in motorcycle accidents as they actually occur in traffic and their relationship to contemporary crashbar structures. ANALYSIS The accident data were collected by means of on-scene in-depth investigation of 900 motorcycle accidents in the City of Los Angeles. Details of the data collection and analysis have been de- scribed elsewhere [2,15] and are sum- marized here. Accident notification was provided by local police and fire department rescue service agencies or the coroner's office. Investigative teams responded to the accident scene immediately (n=617) or within 24 hours (n=283). Virtually all of the at-scene investigations were completed because the necessary physical evidence was still available at the accident scene. Figure 1 . Typical contemporary front and rear crashbar, showing rearward deflection from collision. Those investigated by follow-up exam- ination of the accident scene and vehicles within 24 hours were acquired if sufficient evidence (e.g., motor- cyclist, automobile, motorcycle etc.) could be located and examined to com- plete the investigation. Therefore accident cases were acquired based solely on availability of the pertinent evidence and without a priori selection for any particular characteristic. In this way, the data presented here are considered to be representative of the parent population. When all data had been collected, the accident was recon- structed to determine speeds, angle of impact, injury mechanisms, helmet per- formance, etc. and the data coded for digital storage and retrieval. The original computerized data collection form used in investigating these accidents [2] simply specified whether or not a crashbar was present on the motorcycle and included no further detail regarding dimensions, mounting, configuration, etc. Thus, the ability to extract detailed information about the crashbar, its performance in the accident and leg injuries was limited. For this reason a new computerized data form was developed specifically to address such questions. The new data form specifies such factors as crashbar size, configuration, mounting, damage location and extent, accident con- figuration, rider posture and ejection direction, entrapment of the leg, and injury for each portion of the lower extremity . 2.830</page><page sequence="3">870603 Injury information was obtained from the motorcyclist, the treating physician or hospital, or the coroner's office. The location and nature of injuries was coded for computerized storage and retrieval using a slightly modified version of the Occupant Injury Classification [16]. Injury severities were scaled in accordance with the 1980 revision of the Abbreviated Injury Scale [173. Examples of the codings are given in the Appendix at the end of this paper . Photographs of the accident in- volved motorcycles were examined and restrictive criteria used to verify the presence of a genuine crashbar. Front crashbars were defined as being a metal tube loop mounted to the frame at upper and lower mounts just forward of the engine and extending laterally more than enough to simply surround some motor- cycle component. Rear crashbars similarly were defined as a tubular metal loop mounted to the frame behind the motorcyclist's legs; however, they often were only wide enough to surround a pair of saddlebags. Figure 1 shows a motorcycle with contemporary front and rear crashbars. Figure 2 shows a motor- cycle with an insubstantial crashbar- like structure that simply surrounds a radiator. This motorcycle was pre- viously defined as being crashbar equipped [2,18] but does not meet the more restrictive definition of a crash- bar used here. Figure 2. Metal tube frame (arrow) surrounding the radiator resembles, "but is not a genuine crashbar. Photographs of the accident in- volved motorcycle, other vehicles (if any) and accident scene, as well as injury data were reviewed to reconstruct the accidents involving crashbar equipped motorcycles and fill out the new data form on each case. After the data form was filled out, each case was checked independently by a second coder and any discrepancies resolved by con- sultation . Data elements which were "unknown" or "not applicable" are not reported here, so totals may vary from one table to another. In some of the analyses that follow, the data are normalized and presented in terms of "injuries per accident". This is especially useful in comparing groups with greatly differing numbers of subjects. The injuries per accident is determined by dividing the number of injuries in a certain category by the number of motorcycles in that category . In many of the tables that follow, injury information is presented only for serious (AIS&gt;2) leg injuries because prolonged disablement rarely results from the lower levels of leg injury severity . RESULTS CHARACTERISTICS OF CRASHBAR EQUIPPED MOTORCYCLES - Among the 131 crashbar equipped motorcycles, 103 (78.6%) had double front down tube frames; the remainder had single down tube frames. Three types of engine con- figurations predominated: transverse in- line four cylinders such as the Honda CB750 (47.3%), vertical two cylinders such as Kawasaki KZ400 (23-7%) and longitudinal V-twins such as the Harley- Davidson (16.0%). Front crashbars were most often 26" to 28" wide (80%) and 1" to 1.25" in diameter (98%). Front bars were most often attached to the frame at the upper mount by U-bolts (71.9%) or a bolted flange (25.8%) and at the lower mount by a bolted flange (92.2%). Rear crash bars (n=35) were most often rec- tangular in shape, projected 7" to 10" beyond the side of the motorcycle (91.4%) and were 1" in diameter (80%). All were mounted at the top and bottom by a bolted flange. CRASH SPEED, INJURY SEVERITY AND CRASHBAR USE - It is often thought that the problem with contemporary crashbars is that they lack sufficient strength to maintain the leg space. If this is so, then crashbars might show a favorable comparison at least at lower speeds where less kinetic energy is available for damage. Table 1a shows a cross- tabulation of crashbar use by collision speed. Each cell shows the number of injuries per accident for serious (AIS3,4) leg injuries only. Collision speeds are grouped in various size categories. The median speeds for 2.831</page><page sequence="4">crashbar equipped and nonequipped motor- cycles are 19.7 and 21.9 mph respec- tively. Generally crash speeds are lower for crashbar equipped motorcycles, as shown by a cumulative frequency distribution in Figure 3a. A.

Cumulative frequency dis- tribution of crash speeds of motorcycles with or without crashbars. The data in Table 1 provide little support to the hypothesis that serious injury rates might be lower at low speeds for crashbar equipped motor- cycles. The frequency of serious leg in-jury is higher for crashbar equipped motorcycles at low speeds and in most individual speed groups. Examining the injury rate cumulatively across speeds also suggests little support for this hypothesis, as shown in the lower por- tion of Table 1b. (The parentheses show the actual number of serious leg injuries to accidents for each category . ) The serious leg injury rate for non-equipped motorcycles was lower at 0- 20 mph (.080) and higher, although near- ly flat, above 20 mph (.204 average). In comparison, the rate of serious leg injury for crashbar equipped motorcycles was also low at 0-20 mph (.118) but appears to increase as speeds increase above 20 mph (the small sample sizes at the higher speeds limit the certainty of this generalization). In summary, there was not a favorable comparison for crashbars, even at low crash speeds. Table 1a. Serious leg injuries per accident as a function of motorcycle crash speed and crashbar use.

The small number of crashbar cases in the 26-30 mph range make it difficult to say whether such favorable comparison obtains at that level. Otherwise, the comparison is unfavorable for crashbars, with the serious leg injury frequency higher at most speed levels above 5 mph. For non-equipped motorcycles, the serious injury rate is generally lower when other vehicle crash speeds are 25 mph or less (averaging .158) and higher above that (.205 average). For crashbar equipped motorcycles, the serious leg injury rate averages .205 below 20 mph, and higher on average (.526) above that, although serious injury frequency varies erratically from one speed range to the next because of the small number of cases in most cells. The favorable comparison for the crashbar when the other vehicle crash speed is 5 mph or less lends some support to the idea that crashbars might be effective at reducing serious leg injury when crash speeds are low and less energy presumably is available for damaging the leg protection structure. Data presented in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that higher crash speeds are associated with more frequent serious leg injuries. The median crash speeds for all accidents and for those invol- ving serious leg injuries are shown in Table 3. ANGLE OF IMPACT - Hight et al. [19] make the curious comparison of motor- cycle impact with a jet landing on an aircraft carrier, suggesting that the approach rates are comparable and the energy could therefore be managed in a collision as they are in landing. They go on to diagram a typical car left turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle to show that the "approach angle" in motor- cycle collisions (the angle between the motorcycle velocity vector and the car's velocity component perpendicular to the motorcycle's vector) is typically less than 20 degrees. The argument is surely specious, since collisions will differ significantly even for the same approach angle depending on what part of the car is struck and whether the motor- cycle is yawing, leaning or down sliding on impact. Secondly, the "approach angle" will become smaller (and presum- ably more benign) as the motorcycle speed increases (assuming a constant velocity vector for the car): an apparent contradiction . Furthermore , there is almost no comparison between an aircraft that lands upright only on flat surfaces and a motorcycle that can collide with an immense variety of surfaces in almost any orientation. The angle of impact was determined by detailed accident reconstruction in previous research [2]. The angle of impact was considered to be the acute angle between the motorcycle longitud- inal axis and the struck surface. The struck surface was usually a vehicle, but nonvehicular vertical surfaces such as walls, center dividers etc. could be included. Accidents involving a fall and slide on the roadway, impact with nonplanar surfaces such as trees, chains, bus benches, etc., and noncolli- sion accidents (e.g., passenger falling from motorcycle) were not evaluated for angle of impact. A judgement of impact angle thus is available for 707 of 900 accidents, and the data are presented in Table 4. Table 3. Median crash speeds (mph) for motorcycles and the striking vehicle.

These large angles of impact surely provide less opportunity for contemporary crashbars to provide protection, at least within the con- ventional notions of how crashbars work. Of course, angle of impact by itself is unlikely to be the critical determinant of leg injury severity. Rather, it is only one of a group of factors including vehicle speeds, impacted surface, collision configuration, and motorcycle yaw and roll attitude that may affect leg injury outcome in motorcycle accidents . MOTORCYCLE YAW AND ROLL ATTITUDE - The great majority of motorcycle crash tests in the past have had the motor- cycle upright when it collided with a vehicle. On those few occasions when the motorcycle has been in a non-upright roll orientation, the experiment usually has been considered to be flawed. Tech- nical difficulties make it extremely difficult to have the motorcycle yawing at the moment of impact with an auto- mobile in a laboratory crash test. Previous research [2] showed that many of the accident involved motorcycles were yawing or leaning or down sliding at the time of collision. Table 5 shows a crosstabulation of the yaw attitude by roll attitude for the crashbar equipped motorcycles. This shows that only 46. 5% were upright going straight upon collision. Table 6 shows a crosstabulation of yaw-roll orientation versus single and multiple vehicle accident involvement for crashbar equipped motorcycles. Those motorcycles that were upright and not yawing are listed as "upright"; those that were either yawing, leaning or down sliding are listed as "non- upright" . Table 6 shows that in 43% of the multiple vehicle accidents the motor- cycle entered the collision leaning or yawing, (often as a result of rider evasive action.) Thus nearly half of multiple vehicle motorcycle crashes occurred in situations never tested in laboratory crash test situations. Table 6. Motorcycle yaw-roll orientation in single and multiple vehicle collisions Single Multiple Total Upright 2 58 60 Non-upright 22 44 7 1 Total 29 102 131 CRASHBAR COLLISION PERFORMANCE - In order to evaluate crashbar performance, it was necessary to determine how much the crashbar had been deformed in the accident. In almost all cases any deformation was rearwards. The motor- cycle photographs were reviewed and an evaluation of the extent of residual crashbar deformation was made. The deformation could range from none to 100% loss of the leg space (i.e., the crashbar was crushed flat against the side of the engine). Deformation was rated in increments of one-sixths of the leg space. Although the following tables show the one-sixth increments in terms of percentage deformation, the reader should be aware that these per- cent values do not represent precision measurements to the nearest percentage point, but rather a judgement of incremental leg space loss. It is typically thought that the crashbar will have little strength if it is attached by a U-bolt to a single down tube (1T) frame, which could allow the crashbar to simply rotate at the attachment when impacted. This arrange- ment is perceived as allowing the leg space to collapse under minimal impact load. A more rigid configuration is the Table 5.

In order to determine whether this in fact is the case, the type of frame was crosstabulated with the amount of front crashbar deformation, and the results are shown in Table 7. Assume that 0%, 17% and 33% defor- mation represent minimal levels of leg space collapse, and that 67%, 83% and 100% represent serious compromise of the leg space. Note first that in spite of the common notion that contemporary crashbars lack adequate strength, 97 (75.2%) showed this minimum level of deformation, while only 26 (20.1%) showed severe loss of leg space. Minimal deformation was just as likely with the 2T frame attachment as the 1T (75.7% vs. 73.1%, respectively). Severe deformation was slightly more likely on the 1T frame attachment (26.9% vs. 18.4%). This analysis shows that leg space preservation in accidents was not significantly affected by the con- figuration of motorcycle frame to which the crashbar was attached. Surfaces Struck hx Crashbars - The crashbars struck 27 different surfaces (although 13 crashbars were not con- tacted at all in the accident.) For simplification these surfaces were summarized into the following groups: pavement, vehicle front bumper, vehicle front corner, vehicle side, and "other". The front bumper and front corner of a vehicle are the most aggressive surfaces since they are quite hard and unyielding and cause the greatest threat of impact to the crashbar. Pavement and the side of the vehicle can be considered as much less aggressive surfaces - pavement because vertical impact speeds with it are typically low, and the vehicle side because much of the sheet metal deforms readily. A crosstabulation of these contact surface groupings with the extent of crashbar deformation is shown below in Table 8. These data appear to support the idea that more aggressive surfaces are associated with more extensive crashbar deformation. For example, half the contacts with the front bumper and front corner were associated with severe crashbar deformation, compared to 1.8% for pavement and 26.1% for vehicle side. In contrast, 94.5% of pavement contacts and 65.2% of vehicle side contacts resulted in minimal deformation, com- pared to 42.3% for the front bumper and corner. Impact with less aggressive surfaces (pavement and vehicle side) accounted for 68.2% of all contacts, which helps explain why minimal crashbar deformation was so common. INJURY ASSOCIATION - If the strategy of protecting the legs by building a structure around them is basically correct, then it would seem that by building more structure, more protection would be provided. Certainly both a front and rear crashbar represents more structure around the Table 8.

Of the 131 crashbar equipped motor- cycles, 96 had a front crashbar only and 35 had both front and rear crashbars. In the data of Table 9, each motorcyclist is counted four times: once each for the protectable regions of thigh, knee, lower leg and ankle-foot. In this way, the sum of injured and noninjured regions on a per-accident basis is 4.000. Table 9 presents the number of injuries per accident for motorcycles equipped with front-only or front and rear crashbars at each level of leg injury severity. The data in Table 9 partly confirm the hypothesis above: the comparison is favorable for front and rear crashbars when there is no leg injury and when injury is minor or moderate. However, a complete reversal occurs with the serious (AIS3) injuries, which were nearly twice as frequent when both front Table 10. Crashbar type and frequency of serious leg injury. Leg protection Serious injuries pęracęident No crashbar .145 Front crashbar only .167 Front &amp; rear crashbars .314 It is not immediately obvious why the increase in serious injury occurs when rear crashbars are present. Speed does not appear to account for this difference. Closer analysis of the data shows that the median motorcycle and other vehicle crash speeds for motor- cycles equipped with both front and rear crashbars are 22 and 16 mph, respective- ly. These are slightly higher but still comparable to crash speeds for the other groups. Median crash speeds for serious leg injuries are also comparable: 32 and 12.5 mph for motorcycle and other vehicle respectively. Table 9.

Case by case analysis of the data for motor- cycles equipped with both front and rear crashbars shows that two accidents accounted for five of the eleven serious leg injuries. It is not common for a motorcyclist to .sustain two serious leg injuries in an accident, but three is highly unusual. It is felt that this unusual situation in a sample as small as 35 cases has skewed the results. Perhaps 8-10 serious leg injuries in such a group is more probable (for a serious injury rate of .229 to .286). These data suggest a relationship between the amount of leg protection structures and the frequency of serious leg injury that is contrary to the hypo- thesis above. That is, as the struc- tures increase, the frequency of serious leg injury increases rather than decreases. Drawing data from Tables 1 &amp; 8 yields the following data shown in Table 10. The data in Table 10 contradict the conventional expectation that any crash- bar provides more leg protection than having no crashbar at all, as some have suggested . Crashbar Deformation M Lsg. Injury Severity - If the conventional hypo- thesis - that contemporary crashbars fail to prevent leg injury because they are too weak to preserve the leg space - is correct, then there should be a consis- tent relationship between the extent of front crashbar deformation and leg injury severity. This relationship is defined in Table 11. Again, each leg region is counted once; each motor- cyclist (and accident) is thus counted four times, once for each leg region. Table 11 shows that over half of the serious leg injuries occurred with minimal compromise of the leg space. The greatest part of minor and moderate injuries are also associated with minimal crashbar damage. Also, at all levels of front crashbar deformation, the majority of entries are "no injury". It can be seen in Table 11 that the percentage of serious injury differs at the various levels of front crashbar deformation. This is shown in the following summary . Assuming some consistent relation- ship between front crashbar deformation and leg injury severity, one might 2.836</page><page sequence="9">870603 Table 11.

The data above suggest such an increase, but it is neither linear nor monotonie. These numbers could be interpreted to mean that most of the serious leg injuries at the higher levels of crash- bar collapse are due to the loss of leg protection space. However, such a con- clusion is premature because confounding factors such as velocity change, collision configuration, crashbar strength or the type of surface impacted may also account for this finding. These data define a correlational, but not a causal relationship. Also note that in over half the cases of severe crashbar deformation, serious leg injury did NOT occur. Consider now the proportion of l*eg regions with "no injury" at each level of crashbar deformation as shown below: % Deformation % No Injury 0 69 17 68 33 50 50 64 67 50 83 63 100 59 Overall 65 "No injury" occurred somewhat more often when front crashbar deformation was absent or 17%, but the summary above otherwise shows little relationship bet- ween further crashbar deformation and the absence of leg injury. Leg In iurv Prevention - Is the absence of leg injury equivalent to injury prevention by the crashbar? To answer this question it is useful to determine the rate of "no injury" for the leg regions of riders of non- equipped motorcycles. Recall that Table 11 counts each leg region once. Thus, there are 516 leg regions for 129 riders, of which 182 (35.3 %) were injured and 334 (64.7%) not injured. An estimate of the "no injury" frequency among riders of non-equipped motorcycles can be made. There were 766 non- equipped motorcycles. With four leg regions for each motorcyclist, 3064 leg regions would be counted. There were 1114 leg injuries, implying that there were 1950 leg regions not injured (63.6%). This value falls into the range seen for various levels of crash- bar deformation and is nearly identical to the overall rate of "no injury" for crashbar-equipped motorcycles. However, the probability of any leg region escaping injury was highest (68.6%) when there was little or no crashbar deformation, lower (63.6%) when there was no crashbar at all, and lowest (56.9%) when the crashbar showed moderate to severe (&gt;17%) deformation. This might be interpreted to mean that complete preservation of the leg space could prevent about 5-10% of leg injuries. Alternatively, it could mean that if collision forces are low enough to do little or no damage to the crash- bar, then the chances of any leg region 2.837</page><page sequence="10">to avoid lęg injury are slightly better . Leg Space Integrity - The integrity of the leg space was evaluated by recon- structing the accident to determine if the leg space on the motorcycle had in fact been violated (and, if so, by what), or if it had been preserved or partially preserved by the crashbar or by some other structure. The deter- mination of leg space integrity depended on leg space violation itself, regard- less of rider leg injury or crashbar deformation (since the leg space can be violated without deforming the crash- bar. ) Table 12a shows a crosstabulation of leg space integrity and injury severity. As in the previous table, each of the four leg regions is counted once, so that there are four times as many leg regions as motorcyclists (and accidents) . In 21 of the accidents (i.e., 84/4=21) there was neither threat nor violation of leg space integrity; in another 27 it was violated by another vehicle . But in 79 cases the leg space was preserved, partly or completely, by the contemporary crashbar. Not sur- prisingly, serious injury (AIS3) was the most common and most likely when the leg space was violated by another vehicle, and was very rare when there was no threat to the leg space. However, nearly half of the severe leg injuries occurred when the leg space was not threatened or partially or completely preserved by the crashbar. The rate of serious leg injury and the percentage of leg regions escaping injury is summarized in Table 12b below. This summary suggests that severe leg injury is most likely when the leg space is violated by another vehicle, less likely when the leg space is preserved, and the better the leg space preser- vation the less likely severe leg injury. Nonetheless, serious leg injury did NOT occur in about half the instances of leg space violation by a striking vehicle. These data again raise the possibility that preservation of the leg space can prevent serious leg injuries, and again, such a conclusion is pre- mature. As with the interpretation of Table 11, it must be noted that a variety of confounding factors may be present that preclude such simple inter- pretation . Entrapment - It is often thought that the mechanism of severe leg injury in motorcycle accidents is that the leg is trapped and crushed between the side of the motorcycle and some external surface such as an automobile fender or bumper. Mackay [20,21] has suggested Table 12a.

The collision kinematics for the 131 accidents involving crashbar equipped motorcycles were reconstructed to determine whether entrapment of the leg had occurred and, if so, what struc- tures were involved as trapping sur- faces. Table 13 shows a crosstabulation of the mechanism of entrapment by the leg injury severity. (Entrapment between the motorcycle and environment refers to entrapment against non- vehicular surfaces such as pavement, poles, curbs, etc.) As before, each leg region is counted once, so that each motorcyclist is counted four times. Leg entrapment by anv mechanism was not common on these crashbar equipped motorcycles, occurring 23 times in 129 accidents (17.8%). The majority (61.5%) of serious leg injuries occurred without entrapment. Four of the serious leg injuries (15.4%) occurred by the mech- anism commonly thought to be most frequent, crushing between the side of the motorcycle and another vehicle. An equal number of serious leg injuries occurred when the crashbar was collapsed completely, trapping the motorcyclist's leg. In most of these instances some other surface also was involved as a mechanism causing crashbar collapse, making total of eight cases involving the classic trapping/crushing mechanism. Iniurv CpntSQt Syarfaoes - The mechanism of serious leg injury was determined by reconstruction of the collision kinematics from photographs and injury data. The injury contact surfaces are listed in Table 14 below. Most injuries are associated with two contact surfaces. However, the actual mechanism of injury could be any one of three possibilities: a) either one of two possible surfaces, b) both of the surfaces, or c) crushing between both simultaneously. Following each pair of contact surfaces is a letter represen- ting the leg region(s) seriously injured by those surfaces. Contacts with other vehicle parts represent the great majority of severe leg injury mechanisms (21/27 = 77.8%)4 This is consistent with the data of Table 6 showing that 77.9% of these accidents were multiple vehicle. How- ever, the other vehicle front bumper and front corner accounted for 20.1% of crashbar contacts but 31% of serious leg injuries. Motorcycle components were involved often (22/27; 81.5%), which is no surprise since the rider is usually (but not always) on the motorcycle when the collision occurs. Five serious injuries were due to motorcycle com- ponents onlv (18.5%), and crashbar con- tact was involved in another five serious injuries. CONCLUSIONS It is usually thought that serious leg injuries occur because the motor- cyclist's legs are trapped and crushed against the side of the motorcycle. Contemporary crashbars are assumed to be too weak to preserve the leg space in most accidents. The crashbar therefore collapses, allowing serious leg injury. The findings presented here allow evaluation of these hypotheses. First, note the results for preser- vation of leg space by contemporary crashbars. In three fourths of the crashbar cases, there was little or no deformation; severe collapse occurred only about 20% of the time, usually in collision with the front end of the other vehicle. Thus, contemporary crashbars were sufficient to preserve the leg space in the majority of accidents, although they appear to be too weak for many collisions with other vehicles, especially on the front end. 2.839</page><page sequence="12">Leg space preservation was hardly affected by the type of motorcycle frame: double down tube frames (which do not permit fore-aft rotation of the crashbar at the upper mount) were little different than single down tube frames which could allow such pivoting. The limited data available here suggest that leg space preservation may be more strongly influenced by the object that is struck than the the collapsability of the crashbar structure. A more complicated question is how leg space preservation is related to leg injuries. The evidence suggests that overall, contemporary crashbars did not prevent leg injuries: the proportion of leg regions with "no injury" was nearly identical for motorcycles with and with- out crashbars. Serious leg injury was most likely when there was extensive collapse of the leg space, or when the leg space was violated by another vehicle. Neither were common occurrences (about 20% of accident cases each) although they account for about half of the serious leg injuries - certainly more than their fair share. However, it is still unclear whether the relationship between violation/crashbar collapse and serious leg injury is a causal or correlational relation . A surprising relationship was demonstrated between the amount of leg protection structures and the frequency of serious leg injury. As more crashbar structures were added to the motorcycle, serious leg injuries increased rather than decreased. It is unknown whether the crashbars themselves or confounding factors account for this finding. When extensive collapse or violation of the leg space took place, serious leg injury did NOT occur about half the time. This, of course, suggests that in those cases the leg was not in the leg space when violation or collapse occurred. Conversely, about half the serious leg injuries occurred when the leg space was well preserved by a contemporary crashbar. Thus, at least half the serious leg injuries were unrelated to leg space preservation. This last finding suggests that the motorcyclists leg simply came out of the protection zone during the collision. That is, the leg and the leg protection region travelled separate trajectories for much of the collision sequence. This should be no surprise since the motorcyclist is connected to his machine by little more than his grip on the handlebars. Critical impacts (to either the leg or the leg protection space) apparently occurred when the leg was not in the leg space provided by the crashbar. Imagine the tragic results if prevention of motorcyclist head injuries followed a similar strategy by rigidly attaching the head protection device to the motorcycle. It is often assumed that serious leg injuries occur when the motor- cyclist's leg is trapped and crushed between the other vehicle and the side of the upright, non-yawing motorcycle [e.g., 4,7-14,20-22]. The great majority of laboratory crash testing to date has examined only the upright collision Table 14. Iniurv contact surfaces for serious leg injuries.

Such leg injury mechanism did occur in these data, but accounted for less than a third of serious leg in- juries. Crashbar equipped motorcycles were yawing or leaning or down sliding in 43% of multiple vehicle accidents. It is not yet known how this "disorien- tation" affects the occurrence of serious leg injuries, nor is there much laboratory crash testing to illuminate this collision situation. Previous crash test studies [6,7 i 9f 10 , 13 * 1 4] have often utilized a stationary car struck by the moving motorcycle (or vice versa). Tables 2 and 1 show that 104 of 683 accidents (15.2%) involved a stationary vehicle, and only 1.9% a stationary motorcycle. Since motorcycle collision motions are significantly affected by motion of the other vehicle (e.g, compare [22] and [23]) and the orientation of the motor- cycle, the utility of stationary vehicle vs. upright motorcycle impacts for predicting leg protection is limited. Any future crash test studies will need to examine a wide variety of more realistic collision situations to properly evaluate proposed leg protec- tion systems. Also, many changes have been made in motorcycle design in the past ten years. For example, fuel tank contours, handlebar construction, frame designs and rear suspension config- urations (i.e., "monoshock" designs) have changed greatly. These changes should be evaluated by accident research . The data analysis presented here support the hypothesis that leg space preservation is not strongly related to the occurrence of serious leg injuries in motorcycle accidents, primarily because the leg often does not remain in the leg space during the collision events. Some of the serious leg injuries do indeed occur by the classical trapping/ crushing mechanism , but these occurrences are a minority. Thus it is likely that any benefits of a more rigid leg protection system mounted on the motorcycle will be limited by the failure of the motorcyclist's legs to remain within the protection space and the potential of leg impact upon the more rigid structure. The overall effect of contemporary crashbars is an association with more frequent serious injuries to the "protectable" leg regions of the motor- cyclist. Conventional expectations of crashbar performance and leg injury mechanisms simply are not supported by the in-depth analysis of actual accident events .

The injury is defined in terms of "Region - Side Aspect - Lesion Type - System/Organ Severity" In Figure 4 the motor- cyclist's left lower leg is shown sustaining a displaced tibia-fibula fracture as the result of impact with a car rear bumper. This would be coded as: " CBO 1 - 0000 - LLSFS3" This is interpreted as follows: (first impact surface) "CB01": automobile rear bumper, (second impact surface) "0000": None. The injury codes read in order as: "region - side - aspect - lesion system/organ - severity" would be, re- spectively: "Lower leg - Left - Superior - Fracture - Skeleton - Serious". The Abbreviated Injury Scale [17] assigns number scores to various levels of injury severity as follows: 0 - No injury 1 - Minor 2 - Moderate 3 - Serious 4 - Severe 5 - Critical 6 - Fatal, maximum injury, virtually unsurvivable AIS-80 Lower extremity scores are limited to 0 to 4. Some representative leg injuries and their AIS scores are listed below: Figure 4. Mechanics of a serious leg injury.
