      <p>Phillips, a student of Rhees—himself a student of Wittgenstein as well as of John Anderson, Alfred Kastil, and G. E. Moore—gives us twenty‐six items, mostly from notes and personal letters, which without being at all autobiographical (save one) provide an appealing portrait of this serious but never solemn thinker who, despairing of moral theory, nevertheless attempts in a ruminative Wittgensteinian mode to say something about what a decent life might be like, a life which avoids muddle and evasion and the many forms of moral and intellectual laziness epitomized, for him, by “Sunday paper rhetoric” (p. 126). The earliest item dates from the late forties, with the largest number from the early sixties, and the last, an extraordinary record of mourning for Rhees’s Rottweiler Danny, consists of a set of letters and diary entries running from November 1974 through February 1977. This piece is one of four on the lives of animals and humans and how we might come to understand their lives—particularly the lives of domestic animals—in relation to ourselves. Rhees does not think animals are much like humans, is neither guilty of sentimentality nor anthropomorphism; he does not emphasize à la Singer the characteristics of animals, sentience for example, which might give them rights and ourselves obligations assigned by some general moral theory such as utilitarianism. It is more a matter of the recalibration of our feelings, opening up the possibility of an enlargement of sympathy. J. M. Coetzee, in <italic>Disgrace</italic> and <italic>The Lives of Animals</italic>, comes to mind as a current author with rather the same perspective. What we have and animals lack is language. “Does language make a difference on this score? I do not think so. If one wants to speak of ‘individuality’, all right. It means little more than ‘something that can be loved’, I think” (p. 196). Busybodies, armed with theories, or more accurately prejudices dressed up as pseudo‐theories, whether they are journalists or psychologists or philosophers, will tell us we should not love a dog as we might love a child and not be crushed, as clearly Rhees was, by the death of a “mere” dog, but Rhees has done a lot of antitheoretical work to reveal this approach as philistine impertinence. Let me turn to this antitheoretical work.</p>
      <p>The great thing about starting, in a Wittgenstein‐inspired way, with descriptions of our actual lives is that they show, by the obvious modal principle, what is possible. Commenting on the—disliked—phrase “responsibility to society,” Rhees remarks: “Nor can it be said that ‘society could not go on’ if people insisted on pressing sectional interests. That is how society does go on” (p. 44). The same anti‐utopian animus is reflected in a comment on where we are morally: “The differences which are so common in matters of morality seem to belong to the way the garden grows. In other words, I do not believe there will ever be anything else; and I think it is idle to look for some method or principle by which we might effect something else—by which we might ‘get rid of’ this state of affairs in which so many people contradict one another about what is right and wrong or about what is admirable or despicable” (p. 83). But what considerations does Rhees advance for giving up on method or principle or theory generally? (It should be said that we are seldom concerned in this book with passages of explicit argumentation.) The basic idea is that real moral perplexity—that is, perplexity experienced by people with problems rather than thinkers at one remove—is perplexity about what to do and this requires coming to a decision. A moral problem is a practical problem and cannot be assimilated to problems of other sorts: “If you search for some solution which is ‘there’, this is not a practical problem” (p. 68). Deciding, though not arbitrary, is not discovering: “Whereas in many—perhaps most—questions of morals the decision has to come from me (from the man who faces it; and <italic>whatever the role of reasons, etc., may be they are never conclusive in the way the steps of a mathematical proof are</italic>, nor in the way in which material evidence of guilt in connection with a crime may be” (p. 49). It’s not only trivially true that my decisions must be made by me: I will in deciding draw upon and reflect (and refine or, in the worst case, coarsen) the kind of person I am and live up to, compromise, or flaunt the standards I have adopted.</p>
      <p>Our social world, I think Rhees believed, would be a tolerably, if not a very, nice place if people lived up to <italic>their</italic> standards; the mistake is to think they must live up to <italic>our</italic> standards. “Suppose—this is from `Wittgenstein’s View of Ethics' published in the <italic>Philosophical Review</italic>, 1965—I say that Christian ethics is the right one. Then I am making a judgement of value. It amounts to <italic>adopting</italic> Christian ethics. It is not like saying that one of these physical theories must be the right one. The way in which some reality corresponds—or conflicts—with a physical theory has no counterpart here” (p. 39). Christians have a decision procedure that, at least given all their beliefs, it is reasonable for them to employ. The mistake is to suppose that if it is reasonable (or acceptable) to employ something, it is unreasonable (or unacceptable) not to employ it. Phillips, in his useful introduction, puts the point this way: “What we actually see in ethical theories is one system being sublimed, metaphysically, as the essence of morality, at the expense of others” (p. x). Thinkers look for something very solid, something transcendental or metaphysically necessary, that they might use as a club because “most people who have talked about ethics have been interested in telling people what to do” (p. 6). The real flavor of the Rhees view comes out in the comment occasioned by the unwed and pregnant teenage girl in the “clutches” (his word) of the Moral Welfare Council of the Church of England: “I think the activities of those moral enthusiasts are foul and filthy” (p. 52). This is not to deny, nor has Rhees any interest in denying, that there is much to discuss about the desirability of pregnancy in various circumstances nor even to deny that the girl in question may have made a mistake that might be called a “moral mistake.” But the mistake cannot be deduced from a theory nor the judgment that a mistake has been made delivered as a summary or peremptory condemnation. Circumstances have to be looked at and discussion from which the concrete detail does not disappear has to be undertaken. The discussion may be long and may even be inconclusive. Like Wittgenstein, Rhees believed that reasons come to an end somewhere and that persuasion works and can only work with the beliefs people have, not with the beliefs they ought to have. Philosophers often act as if you could have a moral argument that discharges all its premises and so persuades anyone. (It’s no good at all if it can’t persuade a Muslim fundamentalist to support the ERA.) Rhees offers a useful corrective to this vain ambition that is apt to lead, in its frustration, to cynicism or some variety of “anything‐goes” relativism. How much is possible in the way of intelligent discussion, after the abandonment of high theoretical ambition, is shown in remarks, in this volume, on the topics of euthanasia, suicide, abortion, and sexuality including—rather unfashionably—a discussion of chastity. Although in many ways a champion of good sense and an enemy of what he calls “humbug,” Rhees is not exactly a philosopher of common sense which is apt, in the form we have it, to be reductive. It is not common sense to say, “if I were asked what I understood by chastity, I might refer to Schubert’s song‐cycle, ‘Die Schöne Müllerin’” (p. 160). Again: “I am thinking of chastity—as Simone Weil thought of it, for instance, or as St. Francis did—as something continuous with other forms of desire for purity: as contrasted with and opposed to adulteration, mediocrity, debasement, degradation” (p. 161). All of this is very far from the world of advertisers and psychologists, abusively coupled in Rhees’s view, who think, unclearly, of needs and their satisfaction on the model of “a hungry man’s getting food” (p. 142). One needn’t be religious, or agree with him, to find these unglib, and perhaps old‐fashioned, thoughts curiously interesting. Rhees has, overall, a kind of profundity never arrived at by the merely clever.</p>
