Environmental Values is an excellent book, easy to read and relatively short. Although its title is Environmental Values rather than Environmental Ethics , I plan to use it as one of my required texts the next time I teach our Philosophy Department course called Ethics and Ecology. The authors avoided the word "ethics" in their title, I assume, because they spend a good part of the book finding objections to standard ethical theories. The aim of the book is to criticize the criteria that environmental policy-making institutions use as well as the "undemocratic" power that they wield. A more "deliberative"-based set of institutions would not only allow more input from more sources, the authors argue, but would allow more reasoned deliberation and a fairer distribution of decision-making power. The problem is how to bring this sort of democracy about. The book is detailed and closely argued, and I will not be able to explain all of the argument. I will instead try to highlight what might be of greatest interest to readers of Ecological Restoration. Since the use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is the main tool that environmental policy making institutions cur- rently use, the authors devote the first part of the book to an examination of the ethical foundations of CBA. They find this dominant calculative (as opposed to delibera- tive) tool wanting. For anyone desiring a clear and easy to read introduction to current ethical theorizing, the first three chapters are excellent. Chapter One is dedicated to explaining and critiquing utilitarianism and other conse- quentialist theories (those that evaluate an action or policy solely on the bases of consequences). Chapters Two and Three cover critiques provided by deontological theories and virtue theory. The authors dedicate Chapter Five to a critique of value monism and value commensurability and a preliminary argument for value pluralism and value incommensurability. Value monism is the "assumption that only one kind of thing is of value," and value commensurability is the "assumption that there is a single measure of value through which we can arrive at policy choices" (page 7). The authors present their thesis that we value aspects of our "envi- ronment" differently and these environmental values are often in conflict. There is no way of calculating the right choice; all we can do is deliberate about our best choices under the circumstance. This deliberation is not a form of calculation but a fair weighing of claims and the reasons that support them. Philosophers commonly make the distinction between subjective and objective theories or conceptions of welfare (by which I mean well-being, quality of life, or happiness). Subjective theories argue that the criterion for determining the good life depends on what the subject values. According to subjective theories of well-being, our social and ethical policies should not try to tell people what they should value. We can judge between competing valued items not in terms of the actual worth of the item, the argument goes, but based on the fact that it is valued. CBA does this is terms of weighing how much something is valued against how much we disvalue what we have to pay for getting it. CBA aims to give as many people as possible what they value, whatever that is. It is a value monism because there is only one characteristic of a valuable item that accounts for it having value. That is the fact that it is valued. In contrast, so called objective theories of welfare claim that things are valuable because of certain objective prop- erties and that a person is well off to the extent that they have these things (whether or not they do value them). A value pluralist would hold that there are a number of things that humans ought to value because they do in fact make a person better off. Environmental values are things about our environment (built and "natural") that we ought to value, not because they have intrinsic value but because of the contribution they make to human well-being. The authors emphasize the distinction between the source of value and the object of value. In the second part of the book, Chapters Six through Eight, the authors critique efforts to develop an alternative non-anthropocentric environmen- tal ethics, arguing that this sort of new foundation is not needed if we keep in mind the distinction between source and object of value. "Nature" can be an object of value, but the source of value is human beings. Living "natural things" can be said to be in a state of well-being or flourishing. We might value this flourishing because it is constitutive of our own flourishing. Humans have the capacity to care about the well-being of natural things; exercising this capacity in caring is part of our own flourishing. The authors write, "It can be argued that for at least a large number of individual living things and bio- logical collectives, we should recognize and promote their flourishing as an end in itself. Such care for the natural world is constitutive of a flourishing human life.

They continue: We live from them - they are the means of our existence. We live in them - they are our homes and familiar places in which everyday life takes place and draws its meaning, and in which personal and social histories are embodied, We live with them - our lives take place against a natural world that existed before us and will continue to exist beyond the life of the last human, a world that we enter and to which awe and wonder are appropriate responses. It is from our place within these various relations to the world that reflection needs to begin, (pages 123-124) In the final chapter of Part II (Chapter Eight), the authors look at the efforts some have made to find a sense of "nature" and "the natural" that does justice to our con- cerns for the natural. Readers of Ecological Restoration will probably find this section especially interesting because it discusses both the paradoxes of restoration and its various types and goals. Restoration in the sense of returning a place to its original condition to make up for its destruc- tion (restitutive restoration) has its value in some cases but "ecological restoration projects need not be justified in terms of returning a place to some arbitrary natural start- ing point. They can play a variety of roles in the ongoing relationships that humans bear to the environments in which humans find themselves" (page 148). In this last part of the book the authors develop some of the implications of their view that "many environmental goods we value are valued as spatio-temporal particulars. What matters are particular beings and places constituted by their particular histories" (page 1 53). This, by the way, is also true of the cultural, and the natural and cultural often come into conflict in making ethical and policy decisions. Hence, the inevitability of value conflicts. The title of Chapter Ten is "Biodiversity: biology as biography." The broad range of concerns about biodiversity loss suggest that different conceptions of biodiversity are being appealed to in public debates, so the authors attempt to bring some clarification to the concept. To do this, the authors distinguish between two approaches: what they call the itemization approach and the narrative approach. The itemizing approach is an example of a form of conse- quentialism discussed earlier in the book and used to assess which action or policy is best in a given context solely by its consequences. After clarifying the different senses that biodiversity can have, the authors argue that the item- izing approach appeals to consequentialism, which leads to the commodification of environmental goods and risks tradeoffs that fail to capture the significance of environmen- tal loss. Can a destroyed woodland be replaced by another one just like it? Even if it could, the authors point out, its replacement ignores the fact that "instances of biodiversity, such as particular habitats, are valued precisely because they embody a certain history and certain processes" (page 175). It is what they embody that is of value to those who have special relationships to these places. The value of "a specific location is often a consequence of the way that the life of a community is embodied within it" (page 176). The authors conclude this chapter by expressing concern over the approach used by Katz and Oechsli (1993), who argue that the dangers of the loss of rain forests can only be captured by appeal to non-anthropomorphic values. But such an approach, which the authors criticize earlier in Chapter Six, fails to capture the importance of human scales of value in motivating the most effective resistance to development of the Amazon. It was efforts to protect their resource base essential to their survival, the authors insist, that has motivated the most effective resistors. In the final chapter the authors note some of the prob- lems with the way in which a non-anthropocentric nature ethic has been formulated. Especially with its equation of nature and wilderness, the authors complain, such an approach divorces reflection about why environments matter to people: [I] t loses touch both with why it is reasonable to care about the environment and what is at stake in many environmental disputes. Where it does have an influence, it is not always a benign one, issuing, for example, in an overemphasis on the value of wilderness conceived in a particular way. This has been employed in the unjustified exclusion of marginal communities from the places they have inhabited.1 It has also tended to employ an abstract and thin meta-ethical vocabulary which is blind to the role of place and history in the evaluation of both cultural and natural worlds, (page 8) They argue in contrast "for the need to begin ethical reflection from the human scale of values evident in our everyday encounters with human and nonhuman beings and environments with and in which we live." Environ- ments matter to us for social, aesthetic, and cultural rea- sons. "Particular places matter to both individuals and communities in virtue of their embodying their history and cultural identities" (page 3). 2 This theme is repeated in Chapter Eleven, titled "Sustainability and human well- being," which is an analysis of the various senses that "sustainability" has come to have in public discussions of its meaning and value. The basic question is, "sustain- ability for what and for whom?" The authors raise the issue of substitutability in the context of discussions about the relationship between human and natural capital, and substituting one form of natural capital for another. Their main point is that in discussions of natural capital what is ignored is the role of narrative in accounting for the meaning of an environment to its occupants. In making this important point, the authors once again take up the distinction between subjective and objective accounts of human well-being. A preference theory of wellbeing fails to distinguish between instrumental and non-instrumental 82 ^ March 2008 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 26:1</page><page sequence="3">needs. They write, "Non-instrumental needs are those conditions that are necessary for a flourishing life, the absence of which would be said to harm a person" (page 193). "It is not simply that natural' and 'human capital are not substitutable for each other or are in some sense complementary goods," they continue. "It is rather that environmental goods are not substitutable for other goods because they answer to quite distinct dimensions of human wellbeing" (page 195). Finally, "part of what makes for a flourishing human life is the narrative structure that gives it coherence" (page 197). This structure includes a sense of the cultural and natural history of the places in which this life takes place. "Something that has a life has a his- tory and potentiality to develop. To sustain the life of a community or land is not to preserve it, or to freeze it but to allow it to change and develop from a particular past into a future. Sustainability in this sense would be . . . about preserving the future as a realization of the potential of the past . . . about negotiating the transition from a past to a future in such a way as to secure the transfer of . . . significance" (page 201). In conclusion, I found myself agreeing with most of the authors arguments. If their position has a weak point, it is their subscription to an objective3 theory of human well- being and the role of cultural and natural place in enabling humans to flourish. This flourishing-capabilities approach has been developed by Sen (1993) and by Nussbaum (1988, 1995, 2004), and it is not without its critics (see, for example, Sumner 1996, Chapter 3). The authors argue for the objectivity of their account in Chapter Two and again in Chapter Eleven. It is not at all clear to me how their inclusion of human autonomy (see page 25) makes their objective theory any different from Sumner's account (see his Chapter 6) and Sumner describes his theory as a subjective one. Notes 1 . For an excellent account of this in relation to U.S. Forest Service policy and native New Mexicans, see Kosek (2006). 2 . This point is also made by Norton in his 2005 book Sustainability , which the authors cite several times. For several reviews of this book and a response by the author, see the Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics , 2007, 20:335-405. Holly, in her review raises the question about identities and their relation to place of the new suburbanites who seem highly mobile (pages 342-343). 3. As Sumner (1996) points out, the notion of valuing plays an ambiguous role in determining whether a theory is subjective or objective. The authors of our book do start off saying that there are no such things as values (page 1). There is only the fact that various things matter to us. But if they matter to us because they enable us to flourish, and we value flourishing, then is flourishing the ultimate value that gives things their value? If so, is this not a form of value monism? To avoid this reduction, the authors seem to rely on some ideological account of the nature of valuers that is objective. See Sumner (1996, 69-80) for an account and criticism of such an account.
