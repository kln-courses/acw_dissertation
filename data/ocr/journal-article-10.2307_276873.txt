<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Clay Figurines of the American Southwest. NOEL MORSS. Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archae- ology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Vol. 49, No. 1, Cambridge, 1954. x+115 pp., 31 figs. $3.50. The main purpose of Morss's report is to describe in detail a series of 11 elaborate unfired clay figurines found in 1950 by a local rancher cached in a recess of an occupational cave near Price in northeastern Utah. The pieces are believed to date from the 11th century. In attempting to appraise the chronological position and cultural significance of the cache series the author reviewed all of the data on archaeological occurrences and ethnographic functions of such items, and in bringing together these varied data he has per- formed a task for which everyone interested in the subject will thank him. The figurines, each approximately 6 inches tall, are elaborately decorated with fillets of clay representing hairdress details, ornaments, and clothing. All are painted, particularly with stripes on the face. It is pre- sumed that one figurine has strayed or been lost, since 10 are matched as male and female pairs, leaving one unattached female. The distributional survey of figurines takes up first the "northern tradition" (Basketmaker II, III, and the Utah-western Colorado areas) with the conclusion that the 11 in question are outstandingly elaborate examples of the Northern Periphery figurine complex and can be dated as of the 11th century. Next the "southern tradi- tion" (Mogollon, Hohokam, and peripheral western Arizona and northern Mexico) figurines are cited in detail with the conclusion that the early Anasazi figur- ines (Basketmaker II, III) were perhaps derived by "stimulus diffusion" from the earlier southern complex. Attention is paid to areas outside the Southwest, and Morss inclines to view the Central California figurines as historically connected with the "northern tradition" figurines of the Southwest. Western Texas, the Lower Mississippi, and Plains are surveyed, and Mexico as a source of Southwestern figurines is discussed with little result. The babe-in-cradle figurines are widespread and are suggested as evidence of an ancient and widespread increase cult, and the main conclusion of the study is that "the gynecomorphic figurines of the Southwest . . . are related to a human increase cult involving concepts basically unchanged since Paleolithic times, and not to an agricultural increase cult or to concepts of a Corn Mother or Corn Maidens." Morss sensibly suggests that the joint appearance of pottery and agriculture in early horizons may have offered a means for the production of imperishable figurines, and that there is no necessary functional linkage of figurines and farming through agricultural fertility rites. Altogether this monograph goes a long way toward synthesizing the scattered data and trying to fathom the purposes for which figurines were made. Newer data, accumulating ever more rapidly (EDITOR'S NOTE: see FACTS AND COMMENTS, this issue), and differences of interpretation of the cultural significance of miniature anthropomorphic figures will make the subject a contin- ually live one, but Morss must be given credit for hav- ing written the first major American contribution on the subject.

University of New Mexico Press and School of American Research, Albuquerque, 1953. 174 pp., 84 figs., 15 pls. $4.50. In 1938 the University of New Mexico Press published in its So Live the Works of Men series the original edition of this compilation of Hewett's reconnaissance and excavation on the Pajarito Plateau, west of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the early years of this century. This volume had been out of print for several years prior to this revision. Dutton, The School of American Research, and the University of New Mexico Press deserve credit for making this work once again generally available. It is unfortunate that other, perhaps more im- portant, anthropological studies, such as Bandelier's Final Report, can not be reprinted. From a technical viewpoint, the Press has continued its high standard of competence. Two minor criticisms, however, should here be noted. A foreword by the revisor, stating her intentions, revisions, additions, and deletions from the original should have been included. There is, of course, always the question of whether the revisor should incorporate his or her remarks in the general body of the text, thus leaving the reader in doubt as to the original author's exact remarks, or relegate them to footnotes or parenthetical statements. Secondly, the illustrations of pottery vessels could have been more precisely identified as to type; and the list of illustrations in the original edition should not have been omitted from the revision. The new edition follows generally the same outline as the original and Hewett's easy style has been very little altered. In the Preface and Part 1 the author set down some of his "archaeological philosophy." While the writings of some early Southwesterners are not now considered in the best scientific style, many of them, such as those of Hewett, emphasized points of modern concern such as the inseparableness of archaeology and ethnology. In Part 2 Hewett describes the physiography and the major ruins of the Pajarito Plateau, and in a third sec- tion relates, in a not too detailed manner, his excava- tions there. It is in these 2 portions that Dutton has made most of her contribution. While little actually has been revised here, a number of worthwhile addi- tions to the original text have been made. Prefacing the site descriptions, Dutton briefly discusses the ce- ramic taxonomy for the region, and following each description she lists the principal pottery types of the site, with their approximate dates.
