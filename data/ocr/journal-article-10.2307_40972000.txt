<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lorraine Daston Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief INTRODUCTION: KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF FOR THE MODERN SCIENCES, THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN WHAT COUNTS as established and reliable knowledge and what is viewed as hypoth- esis, conjecture, and tentative belief shifts constantly, according to the dynamic of research and debate. Today's reigning theory may be toppled by tomorrow's finding; within the span of a single scientific career the received wisdom of a discipline may be fundamentally revised not once but several times. What was once judged to be audacious speculation may be confirmed by ingenious empirical tests; conversely, the very axioms of mathematics may be confronted with alternatives. On the basis of the latest research, knowledge is demoted to the status of mere belief, and belief promoted to that of knowledge; hence the instabil- ity of the boundary between them - and the dynamism of the modern sciences. The price of scientific progress is the obsolescence of scien- tific knowledge. The problem of knowledge and belief was born with the modern sciences themselves in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During this period, a whole range of explanatory systems and empirical claims that had been accepted as eternal truths for centuries was overturned. The cross-fertilization of natural history, natural philosophy, craft knowledge, and mathematics created new forms of inquiry, test, and proof- a whole "new science." The origins of modern philosophy - one might argue the origins of modern Western thought tout court - lie in a seventeenth-century diagnosis of pathological belief. The beliefs in ques- Copyright Â© 2005 Lorraine Daston. social research Vol 72 : No 1 : Spring 2005 1</page><page sequence="2">tion ranged from the theological and the astronomical to the geograph- ical, from the anatomical to the natural philosophical: the voyages of discovery, the Reformation, the triumph of Copernican astronomy and Newtonian natural philosophy, William Harvey's demonstration of the circulation of the blood - all confronted early modern thinkers with dramatic and disturbing examples of errors that had persisted for centuries on the authority of the very best minds. It is difficult to capture the enormity of this revelation of perva- sive and enduring error for those who had been educated largely in the old systems of thought - the sickening realization that so many respected authorities could have been so wrong for so long. Some of the most famous projects of the Enlightenment, such the Encyclopedic of Denis Diderot and Jean d'Alembert, germinated in this overwhelming awareness of having only recently emerged from over a millennium of collective intellectual error. One of the avowed aims of the Encyclopedic was to serve as a kind of time capsule to preserve the new discoveries should war and pestilence plunge Europe once again into darkness: "a sanctuary, where the knowledge of man is protected from time and from revolutions" (d'Alembert, 1976: 121). The search for an explanation of and thereby an antidote to future intellectual disasters centered on the problem of excessive belief. This was regarded as an emotional, ethical, and even medical, as well as intel- lectual malady, and one with potentially devastating consequences. Much blood as well as ink had been spilled in early modern religious contro- versies, and throughout the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries "enthusiasm" and "superstition," both diagnosed as pathologies of reli- gious belief, were reviled as sources of ecclesiastical and civil unrest. Excessive belief stemmed from psychological and corporeal causes, both of which had to be strictly managed in the susceptible: too great an appe- tite for the wondrous (asserted to afflict the vulgar and unlettered), a too soft and therefore impressionable brain (as allegedly found in women and children), or too much black bile (the temperament of melancholies) might all cause credulity. The fact that excessive belief was understood at least partly in medical terms by no means exonerated sufferers from 2 social research</page><page sequence="3">the moral responsibility of restraint; spiritual and bodily regimens must be rigorously followed to rein in such dangerous inclinations. Cambridge philosopher Henry More acknowledged that false enthusiasts - people who sincerely but mistakenly believed they were directly inspired by God - were often melancholic and that in such people "the enormous strength and vigour of the Imagination" was affected by the weather, wine, and certain potions. But he blamed the enthusiasts for a lack of temperance, humility, and reason in succumbing to errant fancy. Had they only abstained "from all hot and heightning meats and drinks," repressed desires to stand out in a crowd, and rationally resisted "every high flown and forward Fancy that endeavours to cany away the assent before deliberate examination," they would never have become so mad as to claim that they were prophets or even the messiah (More, 1712: 5, 37-38; Heyd, 1995: 44-108, 191-210). Among philosophers, the responsibility was intellectual as well as ethical - for example, Descartes' instructions in the Meditaiones (1641) to take inventory of all one's stock of beliefs and discard those with the least blemish of uncertainty, to "guard myself no less carefully from believing them than I should from believing what is manifestly false" (Decartes, 1979b: Meditation I, 79), or Locke's insistence in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) that belief be apportioned to evidence (Locke, 1959, IV.xvi.2, vol. 2: 369-370). These religious, phil- osophical, and theological programs for disciplining belief not only raised the threshold of the credible; they also changed the nature of belief itself. Whereas belief had previously been conceived as an invol- untary state and, in religious contexts, as a divine gift, by the late seven- teenth century it had become a matter of voluntary assent: the "will to believe" - or to disbelieve - had become possible. The shock of the seventeenth-century encounter with past error left a lasting mark on philosophy, and, in different ways, on science. Until the mid-seventeenth-century, intellectuals in Latin Europe had generally worried about incredulity rather than credulity, about believing too little rather than too much. The avalanche of novelties- from the discovery of the New World to the invention of the telescope and microscope - Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 3</page><page sequence="4">that deluged early modern Europeans had initially worked to reinforce the prejudice against incredulity; it was a mark of provincialism and little learning to doubt reports of armadillos, Chinese paper money, or microscopic animals in a drop of water. The seventeenth-century theo- logian Meric Casaubon ridiculed those who balked at reports of lobsters dragging men out of the sea or flying cats as country bumpkins, "who were never out of their own country. Nor ever had the curiosity to read the travels of others" and who hence were ignorant of the variety of the world revealed by the latest discoveries, geographic and scientific (Casaubon, 1672: 27). But by the early eighteenth century the pendulum had swung to the opposite extreme - to the point that scientific acad- emies refused to credit reports of meteor showers as smacking of the prodigious (Westrum, 1978: 461-493) - and stayed there. The insistence that belief be "warranted" became and remains a philosophical dogma; according to the doctrine of warranted belief, the fact that a belief is true is by itself insufficient grounds for holding it without further explicit, reasoned justification. The emphasis upon warranted belief led to the spectacular rise of epistemology and the equally spectacular decline of metaphysics since the late seventeenth century. Epistemology is the study of the justification of belief, the vigilant monitoring of the match between belief and evidence and the relentless rejection of beliefs that exceed their empirical and logical warrant - as Hume rejected the idea of necessary connection and Kant rejected any knowledge of the noumena. Epistemology ceases to be an exclusively philosophical worry and enters the practice of the sciences with the diagnosis of error: What kinds of error are most likely and most danger- ous to the growth of scientific knowledge, and what precautions must be taken to avoid them? EPISTEMOLOGY AND ITS DISCONTENTS All epistemology is born in fear: fear of the several sorts of errors that can corrupt, undermine, or impede knowledge. Epistemology is the diagnosis and therapy for intellectual error, reason's physick. Truth may be one, but the sources of error are many, and each kind 4 social research</page><page sequence="5">requires its own remedy. Depending on which errors are most feared, epistemology takes on different forms; intrepid inquirers untroubled by such fears may dispense with almost all epistemology. Philosophy, including natural philosophy, has on some occasions been supported for centuries by only the most lightweight epistemological apparatus. Aristotle's treatises pertaining to animals, the soul, motion and change, and the phenomena above and below the orbit of the moon are rich in metaphysics (and empirical observations) but scant in epistemology; a famously optimistic passage in the Posterior Analytics suggests that human cognition is happily so constituted as to be able to forge valid universals from the particulars of experience, "as in a battle when a rout occurs, if one man makes a stand another does and then another, until a position of strength is reached . . . perception too instills the universal in this way" (Aristotle, 1984, 11.19, 100al2-100b2, vol. 1: 166). To extend Aristotle's military metaphor to cover his own example, ambitious research programs in natural knowledge need not don heavy epistemological armor to make headway. Yet since the early seventeenth century, scientific inquiry has been inseparable from reflections on scientific error, some abstract and philosophical, others concrete and tightly meshed with specific scien- tific practices. The early modern revival of academic skepticism as well as the invention of new instruments such as the telescope and micro- scope certainly challenged insouciant Aristotelian accounts of how we know what we know. A general skeptical distrust of the senses was forti- fied by more specific doubts about chromatic distortion in refracting telescopes or the resolving power of microscope lenses (Popkin, 1979; van Helden, 1977; Wilson, 1995). (Nor were such concerns restricted to the sciences of nature: during the same period historians, philolo- gists, and antiquarians developed critical methods for evaluating the authenticity and credibility of their sources [see for example Grafton, 1991, 1997: 190-235]). But analyses of the sources of scientific error cut deeper and lasted far longer than these seventeenth-century episodes of uncertainty. Worries about the possibility and reliability of scientific knowledge not only inspired the philosophical tradition in epistemol- Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 5</page><page sequence="6">ogy from Descartes to Kant to Husserl and beyond; science itself also became infused with epistemology. Prophylactic deliberations about the errors most to be feared and how to counteract them, as well as about the limits of knowledge, became part and parcel of doing science. The fact that the philosophical and scientific traditions overlap to a strik- ing degree in their lineages of key figures (Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, but also Helmholtz, Poincare, Planck, Einstein, Schrodinger, Bohr) is no accident. A preoccupation with error is a - perhaps the - hallmark of modern accounts of what knowledge is and can be. This acute awareness of error was central to the original defini- tion of what it meant to be modern in seventeenth-century Europe and thereafter. To take the modern side in the quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns was to inventory the errors of antiquity as well as the inventions and discoveries of recent times. In addition to the cascade of novelties that deluged early modern Europeans- new inventions, new lands, new religions, new stars seen with new instruments, new flora and fauna, new philosophies - the recognition of old errors heightened the self-conscious sense of living in a "new time" (aetas nova). One might without exaggeration speak of a collective and prolonged epistemologi- cal shock that still reverberates in philosophical and scientific attempts to determine the ideal relationship between knowledge and belief. Hence epistemology since the seventeenth century has consisted largely in an elaborate nosology of errors: what their species and variet- ies are, and how they may best be avoided or cured. Which errors are singled out as the most dangerous vary considerably and consequen- tially, according to historical context, as do the recommended coun- termeasures. In all cases, error since the seventeenth century has been understood as a case of pathological belief, of credit extended reck- lessly or lazily or slavishly. The knowledge thereby attained eventually reveals itself to be an imposter, an illusion falsely taken for real. Thus on this scheme, the analysis of error is integral to demarcating genuine knowledge from mere belief and, among beliefs, the justified from the unjustified. Vigilance on this score is conceived to be moral as well as intellectual: the will as well as reason must be mobilized in order to 6 social research</page><page sequence="7">grant assent only to those claims that, after thorough epistemological vetting, deserve to be credited. Just what kind of error is at stake has weighty implications for the ethos of belief; just as each of the vari- ous cardinal sins requires its own inner defense, so different kinds of scientific error call forth different precautions - and thereby redraw the boundaries between knowledge and belief. From the seventeenth century on, at least three models of scientific error have been articulated, here presented in ideal-type form: idolatry, seduction, and projection. Each model first emerges in distinctive histori- cal circumstances - idolatry in the early seventeenth, seduction in the mid- eighteenth, and projection in the mid-nineteenth centuries - but they do not replace one another in a sequence. Rather, they accrete, slowly consti- tuting a repertoire of epistemological diagnoses still more or less avail- able to scientists, depending on the specificities of their discipline and circumstances. These models do not, however, always harmonize or even peacefully coexist with one another; conflicts can and do arise among the diverse ways of identifying and eradicating error. These conflicts have also riven our understanding of scientific knowledge and belief. IDOLATRY When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, "Up, make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him." And Aaron said to them, "Take off the rings of gold which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me." So all the people took off the rings of gold which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. And he received the gold at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" - Exodus 32: 1-4. Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 7</page><page sequence="8">The idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as they may be against their assaults. - Francis Bacon, Novum organum (1620), Lxxxviii. Bacon's critique of the idols of the tribe, cave, marketplace, and theater in his blueprint for a reformed natural philosophy, the Novum organum (1620), is one of the most celebrated accounts of scientific error ever written, one so evocative that it is still cited in the context of the latest scientific felony or misdemeanor. Yet it was framed in catego- ries tailored to the circumstances of early-seventeenth-century natural knowledge, and even to Bacon's own. Raised by a Puritan mother who abhorred papist images and ceremonies as reverence paid to the golden calf, Bacon did not choose the metaphor of idolatry lightly (Jardine and Stewart, 1998: 31-32). The "idols" are not synonyms for scientific error in general, but for a quite specific and particularly pernicious sort of error. It is one thing not to know the true god, but quite another to worship false gods; to be ignorant of true knowledge about nature is a wholly different matter than to be in the grip of false theories. Scientific error conceived on the analogy of idolatry implies that it is better to be tabula rasa than to embrace falsehoods, better to have no beliefs than to have the wrong ones. To worship idols is not only to make a mistake; idols usurp the place of the truth and block its way. By providing a substitute for the real article, idols induce their worship- ers to cease their quest for enlightenment, be it religious or scientific. Whatever yearning may have goaded the seekers into further inquiry is quelled by the counterfeit. Idolatry is the error that cuts off the means of correcting error. This is why Bacon (rather exceptionally among his anti-scholastic contemporaries) judged Aristotle, whom he condemned for bending experience to foregone conclusions, as "more guilty than 8 social research</page><page sequence="9">his modern followers, the schoolmen, who have abandoned experience altogether" (Bacon, 1975 [1620], I.lxiii: 61). Some of Bacon's idols were fashioned by the mind itself; others were imposed from the outside. The Idols of the Tribe were those common to all human intellects (for example, a tendency to find "more order and regularity in the world" than actually exists (Lxlv: 50)); the Idols of the Cave arose from "the peculiar constitution, of each individ- ual; and also in education, habit, and accident" (I.liii: 54). These inter- nal idols join forces with external ones, the Idols of the Marketplace (errors spawned by the mismatch between words and things) and Theater (philosophical systems, such as the Sophistical, Empirical, and Rational schools of the ancients). Again, some idols creep into the mind "secretly," as in the case of the Idols of the Tribe and Cave, but also those of the Marketplace; others are explicitly taught, as are the "playbooks" of the Idols of the Theater. None of the distinctions that would matter crucially to later epistemologists - whether the errors stem from nature or from nurture, from sources internal or external to the mind, from unconscious tendencies or conscious tenets - counted as fundamental to Bacon. Each of the idols had its own specific remedy, and all "must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination, and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed; the entrance into the kingdom of man, founded on the sciences, being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven, whereinto none may enter except as a little child" (I.lxviii: 66) The notion of an evacuation, a purgation, even a mortification of the mind is a recurring motif of seventeenth-century epistemology, even among authors of otherwise opposed viewpoints on the origins and obstacles to knowledge. From this perspective, Descartes' radical doubt and Locke's mental blank slate can be seen as kindred fantasies about an entirely fresh start for knowledge. Descartes explained in the Discours de la meihode (1637) that he had lived in a "world of books" since childhood, but discovered after completing his studies that he had been thereby "saddled with so many doubts and errors that I seemed to have gained nothing in trying to educate myself unless it was to discover Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 9</page><page sequence="10">more and more fully how ignorant I was" (Descartes, 1979a [1637], I: 5). Although he considered it prudent to follow accepted laws and customs rather than tearing them down to be later rebuilt, he nonethe- less permitted himself to reject all the opinions he had been taught "completely for once in my lifetime, and to resume them afterwards, or perhaps accept better ones in their place, when I had determined how they fitted into a rational scheme" (II: 12). Bacon was a sworn enemy of the acatalepsia of the skeptics (Bacon, 1975, 1.lxxv: 73), and Descartes adopted none of Bacon's Puritan talk of idolatry. But for both (and for many other seventeenth-century reformers of natural knowledge) the principal obstacle was not ignorance but false learning, and the first corrective "a well-purged mind" (Bacon, 1975, Lxcvii: 94). The metaphors of cleansing, purification, and purgation corre- spond to a more literal view of the body as supercharged with humors within and besieged by miasmas from without - the one necessitating bleeding and purging to stave off corruption; the other, protections such as ointments, pomanders, and as few baths as possible, lest the pores be opened to baleful effluvia (Classen, Howes, and Synnott, 1994: 65-81). Bacon himself not only practiced and recommended regimens based on the regular purgation of the body and the therapeutics of smell (for example, breathing freshly dug up clods of earth to concen- trate the vital spirits); he further evolved an elaborate ontology of subtle effluvia responsible for everything from magnetism and the plague to the material powers of the imagination (Walker, 1972: 121-130; Rees, 1977: 110-111, 1984: 265-282; Fattori, 1984: 324-383). The imagined self, both body and soul (with vital and animal spirits bridging the two), was permeable, dependent on a hydraulic economy of fluids, both subtle and coarse, to maintain health and equilibrium. Perception was conceived as a process of impression and transmission of sensations upon the animal spirits, as a seal imprints wax; the highly impression- able might even be susceptible to the emanations of another person's imagination, at least at short distances. In such cases, permeability verged on vulnerability: Bacon warned that just as the stench of prisons had been known to make judges sicken and die, so might emanations 10 social research</page><page sequence="11">from many envious eyes cause "persons in glory, triumph, and joy" to be "ill-disposed for some days following" (Bacon, 1825-34: 506). It is this image of corporeal and spiritual vulnerability, combined with the realization that received learning was riddled with errors, that informs Bacon's curious choice of verbs to describe the action of the idols on the mind, which they not only occupy but invade. Since it is ordinarily thought to be of the very nature of idols to lack the agency of genuine divinities, to be inert forgeries of the real thing, it is odd to envi- sion them laying siege to their worshipers: did the golden calf "assault" the Israelites? But for Bacon and other seventeenth-century critics of the false learning of the schools, some of the most insidious idols were indeed imposed from without, through upbringing and education. Writers of the most diverse philosophical leanings - Baconian, Cartesian, Spinozist, Lockean - in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries indicted not only the content of traditional learning but also its authoritarian transmission, impressed upon the (literally) tender minds of the young. Custom, Locke contended, forged artificial asso- ciations between objects not naturally related, especially if instilled in early childhood, "the time most susceptible of lasting impressions." Just as children may be raised to loathe honey or to dread the dark, so they may also be indoctrinated with bizarre philosophical and religious beliefs that habit further entrenches. "That which thus captives their reasons, and leads men of sincerity blindfold from common sense, will, when examined, be found to be what we are speaking of: some inde- pendent ideas, of no alliance to one another, are, by education, custom, and the constant din of their party, so coupled in their minds, that they always appear there together; and they can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they were but one idea, and they operate as if they were so" (Locke, 1959, II.xxxiii.18: 534). This mechanism operated in science as well as in religion. The French mathematician and philos- ophe Condorcet observed that new ideas, however well confirmed, often made very little headway among "even the best minds, accustomed to certain abstract ideas acquired in their youth." Hence a genius (homme de genie) who advanced bold new truths found a hearing only among Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 11</page><page sequence="12">"his peers, and a few young people raised far from the prejudices of the public schools" (Condorcet, 1773: 52). Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, acqui- sition of false natural knowledge was regularly linked to the acquisi- tion of false religion: both were instances of how false beliefs could be embraced at the expense of true, of substituting idols for the true god. Only the most drastic measures could uproot beliefs planted so early in young minds: Bacon's "true and legitimate humiliation of the human spirit," Descartes' radical doubt, Locke's relentless review of the evidence for and against each and every belief he held. The seventeenth- century movement for the reform of natural knowledge branched into divergent programs of research, which tracked different objects of inquiry by contrasting methods. Given these differences of means and ends, the consensus concerning which errors were most dangerous and why is all the more striking. Neither ignorance nor the labyrinthine complexity of nature nor the infirmity of the senses but rather idols - and idols in most cases pressed upon the knower in the form of custom, language, and school learning - were the chief enemy. SEDUCTION It [the imagination] is a coquette, who, solely concerned with the desire to please, consults more its caprice than reason. Always agreeable, she offers herself to our taste, our passions, our frailties. . . . The imagination has a view especially to the pleasant, but she is not opposed to the truth. All of her fictions are good when they are in analogy to nature, but when she deviates from it, she gives birth only to monstrous and extravagant ideas." - Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, Essai sur Vorigine des connais- sanceshumaines (1947-51 [1746]: 32) Idols, especially the idols of the theater, continued to exercise Enlightenment epistemologists who worried about the pernicious 12 social research</page><page sequence="13">effects of systems in natural philosophy. But by the middle decades of the eighteenth century, anxiety had shifted from errors imbibed in early youth and at school to those fabricated by the mind itself, more specifically by the faculty of the imagination. Imagination was the good-time girl of the mind (even in languages without grammatical gender, Enlightenment personifications of the imagination were invari- ably feminine), not necessarily corrupt in herself, but always willing to sacrifice principles to pleasure. The mind given over to the delights of the imagination was alarmingly sealed off, impervious to reason, indif- ferent to sensation, and incommunicado to society. So strong were the attractions of fantasy that the world it invented could, in extreme cases, supplant the real world of nature and society. For savants, the dangers of the imagination were threefold, moral, medical, and intellectual: social isolation and consequent neglect of familial and civic duties; nervous and digestive maladies brought on by long hours of solitary contempla- tion; and belief in glittering castles in the air, with no foundation in reality. This sketch concentrates on the last, but Enlightenment epis- temological critiques of the imagination were tightly intertwined with moral admonitions and medical warnings.1 Idolatry and seduction both foment errors by substituting false beliefs for true, but do not operate by the same mechanisms. Idolatry means to worship the wrong gods in the wrong way, and in its earli- est expressions in the Hebrew bible seems to have been associated, at least metaphorically, with betrayal and marital infidelity (Habertal and Margalit, 1992: 9-36). However, the early modern associations of idola- try were more with benighted superstition than with lusting after the wife or gods of one's neighbors. And although the Israelites may well have enjoyed worshiping the golden calf more than the rather dour god of Moses, their motives seems to have been first and foremost prag- matic, to find a new protector: "Up, make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him." Idolatry (and super- stition) were understood to feed upon fear - whether of supernatural caprice or human coercion. In contrast, seduction worked by the prom- Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 13</page><page sequence="14">ise of pleasure. In the context of Enlightenment natural philosophy, tidy, symmetric, harmonious systems beckoned savants to desert the straight and narrow path of slow, stumble-blunder, piecemeal empiri- cism. Facts were notoriously stubborn and unaccommodating, but imag- inary systems indulged every taste and temperament: the philosopher who is pleased by "causes interlocked to infinity" chooses a universe arranged according to the principles of "order and wisdom"; another, more melancholic and misanthropic, prefers "destiny, fatality, chance, necessity; there is his system" (Condillac, 1991 [1749]: 15-16). The self of the Enlightenment was at once a pastiche and a conglomerate: a pastiche of sensations and the traces they left in memory, combined by the principles of association and held together by the continuous thread of consciousness; a conglomerate of facul- ties, the chief of which were reason, memory, and imagination, which operated upon raw sensations to produce complex ideas. This was a self constantly menaced by fragmentation, so much so that some eigh- teenth-century philosophers, most notably David Hume in his Treatise on Human Nature (1739), wondered whether the sense of having a coher- ent self might not be illusory, and reduced personal identity to "noth- ing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement" (Hume, 1975 [1739], I.iv.6: 252). On the one hand, gaps in memory or interruptions of consciousness could fission the self into separate selves. Locke and his eighteenth-century readers toyed with the idea that not only amnesia, but also drunkenness and even sleep might split the self. On the other, the inferior faculties, most particularly the imagination, might revolt against the rule of the superior faculty of reason, causing "alienation" of the self from itself and, in extreme cases, madness (Locke, 1959, II.xxvii.20: 460-461).2 It was axiomatic among eighteenth-century alienists that a deranged imagination lay at the root of the mental ailments of melancholy and hypochondria, both far more severe psychic and somatic disorders than the milder modern meanings of the words might suggest (Mohr, 1990: 22-26; Jobe, 1976: 7-31; Fischer-Homberger, 1972: 391-401). 14 social research</page><page sequence="15">From the standpoint of scientific virtues and vices, the Enlightenment self was susceptible to several kinds of temptation. Insufficient experience, compounded by inattention, impatience, and inexactitude, could spoil observations. Just as moral responsibility for one's past actions depended on remembering them, on connecting past and present selves, so scientific responsibility for one's observa- tions depended on recording and synthesizing them. A different sort of temptation waylaid the savant from within, replacing real impressions derived from memory and sensation with fanciful but alluring systems. Within the mind, reason might succumb to the blandishments of the imagination, that "coquette" who aimed primarily at pleasure rather than at truth. Vanity as well as beauty seduced natural philosophers into abandoning reality for the systems wrought by their own imagi- nations. Goethe warned against the temptation to connect isolated experiments into "theories and systems, that honor the perspicacity of their author," but ultimately impede intellectual progress (Goethe, 1981 [1792]: 16). The healthy imagination was regarded as essential to an inte- grated self, for it was the faculty responsible for fusing sensations from the various sense organs into a unified sense impression, for present- ing past sensations to memory and thereby assuring the continuity of consciousness, and for combining and recombining ideas to create novelty in the arts and sciences. Yet unless due precautions were taken, the imagination might usurp the prerogatives of reason and judg- ment, confusing genuine sensations with hallucinations and fabricat- ing chimerical combinations. Because the self was conceived as a polity of faculties, a "bundle" rather than an organic whole, one or another faculty might rebel against monarchial reason, creating a kind of civil war in the mind and body. The imagination was considered to be partic- ularly prone to insurrection, as much a force of mental disintegration as integration.3 Given this delicate balance between the healthy and pathologi- cal imagination, it is not surprising that Enlightenment (and later) accounts of the imagination abounded with distinctions between Dr. Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 15</page><page sequence="16">Jekyl and Mr. Hyde versions of this ambiguous faculty.4 Hume elevated the imagination to a position of unprecedented importance among the faculties, but nonetheless felt obliged to condemn the illusions of over- wrought fancy: "Nothing is more dangerous to reason than flights of the imagination, and nothing has been the occasion of more mistakes among philosophers" (Hume, 1975 [1739], I. iv.4; I.iv.7: 225, 267). Voltaire drew a line between the imagination passive, which retains impressions of sensations in the mind, and the imagination active, which combines these impressions in myriad ways. Both were subject to pathologies. The passive imagination, common to humans and animals, spawned the superstitions of the vulgar and the deformations imprinted on the fetus by the pregnant mother's agitated brain; the active imagination, cultivated only by superior minds, could degenerate into religious enthusiasm and artistic grotesquerie if not corrected by sound judg- ment ([Voltaire], n.d.: 560-563). Not only poets but also savants were at risk from maladies of the imagination. The image of castles in the air, shimmering but insubstan- tial, recurs in scientific censures of deluded systematists. The natural- ist Georges Cuvier criticized his predecessor Georges Leclerc Buffon: impelled by "efforts of the imagination, without demonstration or analysis," Buffon had produced a work of elegant form but filled with "vague hypotheses" and "fantastic systems" (Cuvier, 1819-27: 297). The antidote to an overweening imagination in science was to culti- vate habits of patient and exact observation, thereby reconnecting the mind to the world, and to strengthen the rule of reason over the other mental faculties, thereby restoring hierarchical order within the mind. The seductive pleasures of the imagination were admittedly of a rather special kind: the completeness, coherence, and certainty of systems, as opposed to the fragments, contradictions, and surprises of observation and experiment. No Enlightenment savant ever seems to have been tempted by an imaginary fact, only by the rounded wholes of systems. In addition to the glory of devising a Grand Theory of Everything, imaginary systems offered a refuge from the hard work of empiricism. Late-eighteenth-century descriptions of scientific observation empha- 16 social research</page><page sequence="17">sized its arduous, painstaking, and even risky character - it was not unknown for virtuoso observers, like the naturalists Jan Swammerdam and Charles Bonnet, to go blind. Retreat into the crenellated castles of the imagination was also a retreat from the seemingly endless and futile labor of collecting facts, which often added up to no conclusion or even contradicted one another. To succumb to the seductions of the imagi- nation was the intellectual equivalent of quietism, a withdrawal into the tranquil solitude of the mind, where one was neither distracted by company nor frustrated by facts. Savants who surrendered to the error of seduction had forged (in every sense of the word) a counterworld; they created not false gods but a false creation. PROJECTION Yes, no doubt, the experimenter must force nature to unveil herself, in attacking her and posing questions to her from all directions; but he must never answer for her nor listen incompletely to her answers, taking from the experi- ment only that part of the results that favor or confirm the hypothesis. - Claude Bernard, Introduction a Vetude de la medicine experi- mentale (1966 [1865]: 53) And hasn't an illusion crept into the highest interpretation of the word "objectivity"?. . . Or are things by their own agency supposed to draw, portray, photograph themselves on a pure passivity? - Friedrich Nietzsche, "Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie fur das Leben," (1992 [1874]: 111) An object throws itself against us; a projection throws us against the object. Put less etymologically, projection casts some aspect of the subjective self- its hopes, fears, preconceptions, conjectures - onto the objective world. In its most extreme form, projection becomes Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 17</page><page sequence="18">the curse of Narcissus, doomed to see nothing but his own reflection and to mistake it for another person. As a category of error, projection began to frighten scientists in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Its putative victims were not acolytes of false learning or dwell- ers in castles of the imagination, but laboratory and field researchers who conducted investigations on an unprecedented scale, mimicking the machinery and division of labor of factories. No one ever accused French physiologist Claude Bernard, practitioner and publicist of dramatic vivisections on animals, of shirking empiricism or kowtowing to conventional wisdom. In his Introduction a Vetude de la medicine experi- mentale (1865), Bernard's metaphors of experimental inquiry were auda- cious, invasive, even violent. Yet after having "unveiled" and "attacked" nature with his probing questions, he fretted over the possibility that he might put words in her mouth when he ought to have been silently taking dictation. The active experimenter must abruptly become the passive listener, ideally the receptive, objective photographic plate of a scientist mocked by Nietzsche. So alarmed was Bernard by the risk of projection, that he split the persona of the scientist in two: an experi- menter who plans research in light of theories and hypotheses to test; and an observer (preferably an uneducated assistant) who registers the results with "passive senses" (Bernard, 1966 [1865]: 54-55). This is a divi- sion of labor that would have deeply shocked Enlightenment savants, who regarded observation as the supreme act of the informed, active, scientific intelligence. Although Bernard admitted that the splitting of the scientist into active experimenter and passive observer was usually impracticable, the notion that the scientist must divide the self to control the urge to proj- ect preconceived ideas onto nature was echoed by many of his contem- poraries. Only a heroic act of self-discipline and self-denial can rein in these projections. The British physicist Michael Faraday gave voice to this ethos of iron will and clenched teeth: "The world little knows how many of the thoughts and theories which have passed through the mind of a scientific investigator have been crushed in silence and secrecy by his own severe criticism and adverse examination."5 18 social research</page><page sequence="19">Techniques such as photography and self-registering instruments were touted as further mechanical precautions against projection of pet hypotheses on the data. Even if a blurred, black-and-white photo- graph was less accurate than a carefully executed color drawing, at least it was free of all traces of subjectivity (Daston and Galison, 1992: 81-128). The German bacteriologist Robert Koch admitted in an 1884 article that photographs of microorganisms had several scientific disad- vantages, including less vivid stains and an enforced two-dimensional cross-section of the object (which could produce visual artifacts). But he insisted that the price must be paid in order to eliminate "numerous subjectively colored views [Anschauungen] and the still more [numerous] resulting differences of opinion " (Koch, 1884: 10). Wishful thinking, anthropomorphism, the pathetic fallacy, and other ways of humanizing the nonhuman world are no doubt as old as time. What is historically specific about the scientific error of projec- tion was first, the timing- of all the possible errors a scientist might commit, why thrust this ancient human foible onto center stage in the mid-nineteenth century? - and second, the mechanisms - why choose the metaphor of the projection of an image onto a blank screen to describe the workings of this sort of intellectual error? The answers to both questions are bound up with a new vision, first articulated by Kant and subsequently reworked by a generation of philosophers in light of early-nineteenth-century political, economic, and intellectual transformations, of self and the world divided along the lines of the objective and subjective.6 Whereas the Enlightenment self was constructed by reason out of the raw materials of sensation and memory impressions, the subjective self was made out of will and repre- sentations. The will was one faculty among several in Enlightenment theories of the impressionable self, and of minor cognitive conse- quence: it was charged with controlling the passions, but not sensation and imagination, which were properly subordinated to reason and judg- ment. In contrast, the will dominated all aspects of the subjective self, including those related to the acquisition and evaluation of knowledge. Scientific objectivity was a response to the subjective self, conceived as Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 19</page><page sequence="20">constituted by and tightly organized around an autonomous will. It was a unity, not a bundle of more or less coordinated faculties. The excesses of this kind of self were those of the unbridled will, which assumed an epistemological dimension. The unbridled will could impose itself upon nature, distorting, fabricating, and perfecting the facts. The peculiar form this imposition took was projection, a proce- dure well known since the sixteenth century in the context of the camera obscura and magic lantern. In the context of the permeable and impressionable selves of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century psychology, it would have made little sense to talk about the mind's projections onto the world; the arrows of action pointed in the other direction, from the world onto the mind. On this account, the only way for the mind to shelter itself from the world was a pathological with- drawal into the interior chambers of the imagination; the healthy mind was open to and therefore molded by experience as conveyed by the "impressions" of sense and memory. Only in the context of an over- weening will that reached outward to impose itself upon the world did the metaphor of projection onto a receptive screen make sense, revers- ing the tabula rasa metaphor of sensationalist psychology.7 However dynamic and outreaching the will-centered self was conceived to be, it is still surprising that its scientific manifestation was thought to be so powerful as to overwhelm objective reality. Why must the will be enlisted to contain the will by means of resolute acts of self-restraint of the sort praised by Faraday? It seems paradoxical that the more nineteenth-century scientists insisted on the obduracy of hard facts, the more they feared the power of subjectivity to melt those facts. The key to the paradox lies in another fear that began to haunt scientists in the mid-nineteenth century: the fear of vertiginous, open- ended progress. In the eighteenth century, the sciences had seemed destined for smooth, steady, expansive progress; between 1750 and 1840, histories of science documented the existence and extent of prog- ress in various disciplines. But the progress envisioned in these histories was of change without transformation. Once the foundations of the new 20 social research</page><page sequence="21">science had been laid in the seventeenth century, so went the story, the edifice could be expanded but need never be remodeled. Starting in the 1830s, this cumulative view of progress received a rude shock, as vener- able scientific theories (for example, Newton's corpuscular theory of light) were summarily dethroned. Was scientific progress so inexorable, so durable after all? The response of the scientists was to take refuge in a description of facts in order to salvage a stable core of knowledge from the ever-accelerating succession of theories. Both the first and second waves of positivism in the 1830s and 1880s, respectively, were explicit about this motivation. Never before had science bustled and flourished as it did in the latter half of the nineteenth century, but science not only grew, it also changed, and at a breakneck pace that reduced the lifetime of theories from centuries to mere months (Daston, 2001: 201- 221). Only facts seemed to hold out the hope of permanence in science; hence the fervor of scientists to sever the objective from the subjective, and to safeguard data from projections. CONCLUSION: THE ETHOS OF BELIEF Idolatry, seduction, and projection are all errors of substitution: false beliefs usurp the place of true knowledge. Although it is possible to entertain true as well as false beliefs, the category of belief as a whole is in contradistinction, if not opposition, to that of knowledge. It is possible that some beliefs may graduate to the status of knowledge, having withstood rigorous evidentiary tests. But epistemology since the seventeenth century has been overwhelmingly concerned with false beliefs - idols of fallacious learning, seductions of imaginary systems, projections of subjective expectations - that compete with knowledge, just as heresies once vied with the one true faith. And just as heretics were deemed to be damnably complicit in their errors, so inquirers who surrender to cognitive errors have been judged morally respon- sible. They are culprits in as well as victims of deception. The moralization of belief is surprisingly constant across all three models of error. Even the medicalized accounts of the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries, which attributed the excesses of religious and philosophi- Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 21</page><page sequence="22">cal enthusiasm to a melancholic temperament caused by an excess of black bile, or susceptibility to the wiles of the imagination to soft brain fibers and irritable nerves, did not thereby exonerate sufferers. Seventeenth-century moralists tartly admonished melancholies to watch their diets and be bled regularly; their eighteenth-century successors advised savants suffering from maladies of the imagination to take regular exercise and go out in society. These were the counsels of an Aristotelian ethics of habit and regi- men, rather than of a Kantian ethics of will, but they were none the less moralized for that Once epistemology was construed as a matter of the will reining in the will, as in the case of nineteenth-century scientific exhorta- tions to suppress subjectivity, the high moral tone becomes more audible to modern ears. But for all three models, there is no such thing as a purely innocent error. It is a matter of rectitude as well as prudence to withhold credence from suspect propositions. This state of withheld or suspended belief is known as skepticism, and it comes in varying strengths, from mild demur to radical doubt. It is so reflexive an intellectual stance for moderns that some effort is required to appreciate its strangeness. Perform the following analogical thought experiment: imagine a person who, on principle, withheld trust from others until their reliability had been proved, rather than the other way around. The local shopkeepers would be assumed to be swindlers, friends warily eyed for the slightest signs of disloyalty, family members suspected of calculating legacies and life insurance premiums. We have met such people in plays by Moliere; they are called misanthropes and are to be chastised or pitied, but not admired. Yet they are the moral equiv- alent of skeptics, who refuse to trust - their senses, received wisdom, testimony, scientific hypotheses - until shown the evidence, bushels of it. Even if the prototype of the skeptic is taken to be not Descartes, with his unsettling fantasies about malevolent demons, but rather the debonair and self-ironic Hume, there is more than a whiff of paranoia in the mental exercises of suspending belief about everything, includ- ing whether the sun will rise tomorrow. As philosopher Stanley Cavell remarks apropos of romanticism as a promise of self-recovery: "But in all philosophical seriousness, a recovery from what? Philosophy cannot say 22 social research</page><page sequence="23">sin. Let us speak of a recovery from skepticism. This means, as said, from a drive to the inhuman" (Cavell, 1994: 26). But if there is something inhuman about the skeptical withhold- ing of belief, lest an error be committed, it is an inhumanity bred of fear. The fear is historical, memorialized in the very way European history is divided up: Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Early Modern, Modern, terms freighted with a telos that is awaited, anticipated, and finally achieved. The first expression of modernity was to recognize that all that preceded it had been a huge mistake; to realize the magni- tude of the mistake was to fear ever erring again and to vow vigilance, constant and even inhuman. Skepticism is the continuing aftershock of that earthquake. Yet fear alone cannot explain the profoundly moral- ized character of withheld belief: fear can breed extreme caution and circumspection, but not a sense of duty. Why is it a duty, not just a maxim, to withhold belief? The template of all belief is religious, and the close analogies between how epistemology analyzes error and theology analyzes heresy reveal that this template has not been wholly discarded. In religion, belief granted lightly can indeed be culpable. But belief withheld can be still more so. Moreover, religious faith, as an internal state, differs crucially from intellectual belief, as William James pointed out in The Varieties of Religions Experience (1902): "The faith- state may hold a very minimum of intellectual content It may be a mere vague enthusiasm, half spiritual, half vital, a courage, and a feel- ing that great and wondrous things are in the air" (James, 1985 [1902]: 505). Hence it would be overhasty to conclude that the moralized char- acter of scientific belief is just so much displaced religion. The ethos of belief preached by epistemology may occasionally borrow the vocabulary and timbre of religion, but it springs from funda- mentally different impulses. To grant belief to claims, theories, and prop- ositions does not resemble a state of religious conviction, even though both may command the full investment of the self. The one seeks at all costs to avoid credulity, the other incredulity, but even this opposi- tion does not fully capture the distinction. Epistemological belief- and still more principled disbelief- is willed and cultivated; on this account, Scientific Error and the Ethos of Belief 23</page><page sequence="24">assent is freely granted by an autonomous cognitive agent who bears responsibility for this decision. In contrast, religious faith is a gift, freely endowed but not willed. Even Pascal's advice to "allez en avant, la fin vous viendra" assumed that faith would follow from voluntary observance, not that observance alone would suffice. It is quite conceivable that the modus of epistemological belief might be turned to the ends of religious faith, as in the case of rational sects like deism, but then religion derives its moral aura from epistemology, not vice versa. The moral aura that surrounds epistemological belief is itself grounded on an ur-belief: that it is both possible and desirable to believe only what one wills to believe, and that the will to believe can be compelled by reason. It should, however, be noted that scientific attitudes toward epis- temology do resemble those of the allegedly devout toward religion in that, in both cases, precepts are generally honored only in the breach. Indeed, it could be argued that the entire enterprise of science would grind to a halt were epistemological scruples to be rigorously enforced, just as ordinary life would were religion to rule with an iron hand and an all-seeing eye. Successful science, in contrast to minatory epistemol- ogy, has historically been risk-seeking with respect to belief. There is something reckless about remarkable scientific advances. As the other essays in this issue of Social Research amply testify, the road to scientific heaven is strewn with fertile errors. Despite several centuries' worth of well-meant epistemological advice (much of it from scientists them- selves) about meting out belief with a stinting hand, science contin- ues to be permeated with interpretation and even metaphysics - and permeated at the level of daily scientific practices, where the work of understanding and manipulating the world gets done. Forced to choose between two kinds of error, successful science has historically erred on the side of maximizing knowledge, rather than on that of minimizing error - even at the cost of believing too much.
