Pp. xxiii + 455. Paper $49.95. This volume's eighteen essays represent ten years of study of formative mystical and apocalyptic texts by the SBL Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism Group. In the intro- ductory essay, "What Is Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism?" (pp. 1-24), April D. DeConick states, "Since Judaism and Christianity are companion expressions of Second Temple Judaism ... the mystical tradition preserved in their literature is rightly character- ized as manifestations of Jewish and Christian religiosity in the late Hellenistic and Roman periods" (p. 2). Their mysticisms represent a "bilateral tradition" (pp. 2-5), with the com- mon understanding that "God or his manifestation can be experienced immediately" (p. 5). Part 1 , "Hermeneutics and Experience," consists of three articles: Alan F. Segal, "Reli- gious Experience and the Construction of the Transcendent Self' (pp. 27-40); Christopher Rowland, "Visionary Experience in Ancient Judaism and Christianity" (pp. 41-56); and Seth L. Sanders, "Performative Exegesis" (pp. 57-79). The authors note that exegetical reflection does not negate the reality of mystical experience. As Segal demonstrates, "human beings do not look at unmediated experience. Culture intervenes" (p. 37). Noting the impor- tance of cultural influence on visionary experience, Rowland shows how mystical experi- ence moves beyond normal perception, likely originating in an exegetical process that "may involve the interpreter as a participant in the text" (p. 55). One form of this participation appears in the astronomical/astrological texts of Qumran, explored by Sanders. From an analysis of the Damascus Document and Calendrical Documents A and B (4Q320, 4Q32 1 ), he observes that "the inextricable intertwining of interpretation and performance generates a new religious possibility" (p. 79). Part 2, "Communal Identities," addresses the life of the mystical communities. The essays are Rachel Elior, "The Emergence of the Mystical Traditions of the Merkabah " (pp. 83-103); James R. Davila, "The Ancient Jewish Apocalypses and the Hekhalot Liter- ature" (pp. 105-25); and Ra'anan S. Boustan, "Rabbi Ishmael's Priestly Genealogy in Hekhalot Literature" (pp. 127-41). Whereas Merkabah mysticism describes visions of the divine throne chariot, Hekhalot literature of the Middle Ages concerns ascent or descent into heavenly places (Davila, p. 105). "Both traditions are profoundly interested in mysti- cal descriptions of holy space in heaven . . . and in the sacred ritual performed by angelic watches in the celestial realm in eternal cycles" (Elior, p. 85). Thus, seers related visions of an uncorrupted heavenly realm that contrasted sharply with earthly experience. Part 3, "Cosmology" - which means a revelation of divine glory - includes Christo- pher R. A. Morray-Jones, "The Temple Within" (pp. 145-78); Andrei A. Orlov, "God's Face in the Enochic Tradition" (pp. 179-93); Cameron C. Afzal, "Wheels of Time in the Apoca- lypse of Jesus Christ" (pp. 195-209); and Kevin Sullivan, "Sexuality and Gender of Angels" (pp. 211-28). According to Orlov, "Exod. 33:18-23, Ps 17:15 and 2 En. 39:3-6 represent a single tradition in which the divine face serves as the terminus technicus of the Lord's anthropomorphic extent" (p. 1 85). Sullivan also observes that to commune with God, "mys- tics sought to understand the nature of heavenly existence" (p. 227). Biblical tradition locates angels in God's presence, and from sources such as the Enochic material, mystics under- stood that some humans became angels (pp. 227-28). Thus, such groups as the Essenes, the</page><page sequence="2">932 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 Therepeutae, and the community of the Gospel of Thomas all promoted maleness and asex- uality as means of entering the heavenly realm (p. 228). Part 4, "Apocalypticism," contains the following essays: Frances Flanner-Dailey, "Lessons on Early Jewish Apocalypticism and Mysticism from Dream Literature" (pp. 231- 47); Kelly Coblentz Bautch, "Situating the Afterlife" (pp. 249-64); and Rebecca Lesses, "Eschatological Sorrow, Divine Weeping, and God's Right Arm" (pp. 265-83). Lesses offers a particularly interesting tracing of the theme of divine weakness and weeping in Sefer Hekhalot , Lamentations Rabbah, and Rabbi Kalonymus Shapiro's homilies delivered in Poland before the Second World War and then in the Warsaw ghetto. In human suffering, a bond is established with God, who also suffers on account of human evil (pp. 282-83). Part 5, "Practices," contains Celia Deutsch, "The Therapeutae, Text Work, Ritual, and Mystical Experience" (pp. 287-3 11); Andrea Lieber, "Jewish and Christian Heavenly Meal Traditions" (pp. 313-39); Charles A. Gieschen, "Baptismal Practice and Mystical Experi- ence in the Book of Revelation" (pp. 341-54); and Daphna Arbel, "Divine Secrets and Div- ination" (pp. 355-79). Mystical texts often spiritualize liturgical practices. Lieber notes how Second Temple Jewish texts transform the image of the divine banquet. In Philo 's exegesis of Exod 24: 1 1 , Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu ascend not only Mount Sinai, but also into the heavenly realm, where they eat only spiritual food through the divine vision (pp. 316- 17). Early Christian tradition likewise spiritualized the tradition of the divine banquet, cul- minating in John 6:35-40 (p. 323). Gieschen points out that in Rev 1:5; 3:14; and 17:6 the "priesthood of the baptized ... is lived out in mystically gathering around the heavenly throne to sing the unceasing liturgy with the angels and saints" (p. 351). The collection helpfully introduces a small part of the great diversity of thought and praxis in Jewish and Christian mystical traditions. At the same time, the emphasis on the importance of community among mystics and apocalyptists, especially in parts 1, 2, and 5, reminds readers that these authors were not isolated individuals but people who lived in a social setting that influenced them, and which they sought to influence through reflection on their mystical experiences.
