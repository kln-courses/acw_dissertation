<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHAMANISM: THE KEY TO RELIGION DAVID RICHES University of StAndrews The article lays out in schematic fashion a composite of socio-intellectual processes, arguably evident in respect of all cosmologies, which might appropriately be labelled 'religious'. It does so by applying deductive reasoning to shamanism, the prevalent religion in societies whose social structures are simple and in whose cosmologies religious process is conspicuous; here the Canadian Inuit (Eskimo) provide the ethnographic focus. The article assumes that religious process finds its basis in fundamental contradictions con- cerning the conditions ofsocial eNistence, namely in the antithesis between social structure and communitas. Cosmology is generated as this contradiction is contemplated by, respectively, laypeople and specialists, both with their own interests in view. The argu- ment also considers such central cultural and analytical issues as the existence ofdistinctive notions of the human person, and the pertinence for the study of religion of, variously, 'secondary elaborations', systems of classification, and religious edicts; and it joins with Barth in emphasizing the salience of the specialist in 'cosmology-making'. Introduction 'Religion' may be a problematic analytical category, yet few would deny that it is meant to refer to something fundamental in human social life. Defini- tional matters apart, in common sense it evokes two functions: the ideological (i.e. rendering support to the social, especially the institutional); and the cosmological (i.e. permitting contemplation of eschatological and related questions posed by the inquiring individual). A major difficulty for anthropology is the relationship between these two functions, with theories of religion typically giving primacy to just one of them (cf Geertz 1965: 42). This article offers an account of religion which cuts across the two functions. I shall argue that the term 'religion' might reasonably be used to describe certain socio-intellectual processes by which human beings contemplate the social.1 The task is to expose these processes, and to delineate the 'social' in terms of something distinctive and fundamental in human interaction. In principle, 'religious' processes must be approached by construing them as the continuing work of individuals, both lay and specialist (hence the term socio-intellectual processes). Furthermore, these processes must be pre- sumed to be evident, at some level, in all cosmologies (for example, including the cosmology embodied by modem science), though in the bulk Man (N.S.) 29, 381-405</page><page sequence="2">382 DAVID RICHES of the article I am content to articulate them ethnographically through an examination of Canadian Inuit (Eskimo) shamanism.2 The article is organized around solutions to two major methodological problems. First, the 'fundamental in the social' will be shown to refer to a universal and deep phenomenon, relating to communitas and social struc- ture, for which an ethnographic counterpart is required. It is argued that this ethnographic counterpart is provided by human societies with 'simple' social structures - societies whose prevalent religion is shamanism.3 This is why the exemplar society in this discussion is the traditional (i.e. pre-colonial) Canadian Inuit, about whom information is available in numerous texts of highest quality (especially Rasmussen 1929; 1930; 1931; 1932).4 The second problem is that 'shamanism', like 'supernatural' or 'sacred', is an analyst's category This has obvious advantages for a comparative project. Yet what is to be included in (or excluded from) the notion of shamanism? And when should one begin the analysis? Should it be with the ecstatic trance, or with the capricious spirit world, or with the contact with that spirit world which the shaman uniquely achieves? I suggest that a deductive method can avoid these problems. Instead of taking some (arbitrary?) aspect of this 'religious' system as a point of departure, one can begin with some theoretical first principles and out of these generate a body of knowledge. Supposing this knowledge corresponds roughly with what we are happy in common sense to label 'shamanism', then we may be content. It is by means of such a deductive procedure that, with reference to Inuit shamanism, the various aspects of 'religious process' will be exposed. In the conclusion, deductive reasoning is confronted with the assumptions of interpretive reasoning, and the various intellectual processes of 'religion' are laid out. It will be shown how cosmologies emanate from the contempla- tive work of laypersons and specialists as each pursue their rather different interests. Laypersons' interests, which relate to the very constitution of the social, are revealed to be the more fundamental: an intrinsic part of religious process is the fact that laypersons' interests license the specialist to practise. Yet it is specialists' interests, to do with the maintenance of their own power, which constrain how cosmologies are elaborated and represented; Barth's work (1987) on divergences within a New Guinea cosmology provides a vital point of comparison here, both theoretically and ethnographically The socio-intellectual processes elucidated in what follows may be read from an evolutionary standpoint. Shamanism has, of course, been elaborated elsewhere in an evolutionary vein (e.g., La Barre 1970), but distinctive about this article is how shamanism is shown to be linked to a fundamental social 'moment' - in a manner similar, in principle, to Durkheim's discussion of totemism (Durkheim 1964). By articulating this moment in a special way, this article suggests how religion emerges at the instant of social structure, and so hand-in-hand with any substantive social organization.</page><page sequence="3">DAVID RICHES 383 Shamanism and the contemplation of the social Discussions in the anthropological literature frequently comment on the prevalence of shamanism in societies with 'simple' social structures, that is, in societies with decentralized polities, marked by egalitarianism, by social values which celebrate the autonomy of the individual person, and by social organizations where descent sodalities are absent or not strongly emphasized (e.g. Lewis 1971: 34-5; Knauft 1985: 319).5 Thus the cosmologies of no- madic hunting and gathering societies are predominantly shamanistic (an exception is the Australian Aborigines - but then, no one would claim that their social structures are simple!), as also are those of northern Old World reindeer pastoralists, and of such diverse hunter-horticultural societies as the Piaroa of Venezuela, the Gebusi and the Baktaman of New Guinea and the Chewong of Malaysia.6 Yet there has been little exploration of a connexion between this type of social structure and this type of religion. For example, Ioan Lewis, in Ecstatic religion, approaches such a link in only a negative sense. The unpredictable religious ecstasy which is shamanism's hallmark would not be tolerated in more markedly institution-bound societies, Lewis main- tains, alluding to Weber on the routinization of charisma (1971: 174; cf Douglas 1973: 104). There is force in this, yet it is a pity that Lewis's expla- nation of shamanism invokes pressures external to the society. Thus, inspired by its 'classical arctic' manifestation, Lewis interprets this 'ecstatic' cosmology as the vehicle by which humans, under domination from a hostile environment or from societal encapsulation, assert that they are masters of their own fate (1971: 176). By contrast, in the present article it is in terms of distinctively internal (social) circumstances that shamanism is explained. But I go further. If shamanism is the religion of societies with simple social structures then, supposing a relationship can be generally established as between religion and social organization, it may be through shamanism that it will be exposed. As to how this relationship may be effected, one will have to relate the phe- nomenon, religion, to something extremely fundamental in the human social condition (more fundamental than the constellation of traits which 'simple social structure' describes). What this fundamental aspect is going to be depends, in turn, on how one chooses to theorize this social condition. The theoretical discussion of something 'fundamental in the social' to which I shall attend is Victor Turner's exposition of 'communitas' (e.g. 1969; 1974). Communitas essentially refers to a primordial sociality which functions to embrace all individuals as equal and whole beings; as such it connotes a kind of social soup, whose homogeneity (which potentially ex- tends to the limits of the human species) reflects the existence of 'generalized' (i.e. undifferentiated) social ties. Turner also expounds on the properties of social structure. Characterized by institutionalized differentia- tion and hierarchy, these properties are entirely opposite to those of communitas. Yet communitas, being an 'essential and generic bond' (1969: 83), serves as a template for the social structural: the possibility of institu- tionalized differentiation and hierarchy presupposes that there eNists a social</page><page sequence="4">384 DAVID RICHES communion amongst the individuals who will be incorporated in the struc- tural scheme. In this regard, communitas clearly alludes to something fundamental in the social, since it exactly captures the transcendence of the individual which makes human social life distinctive.7 'Whilst Turner dwells on ethnographic circumstances, specifically circumstances of liminality (in rites of passage, in pilgrimage), where communitas might actually be glimpsed, the concept's worth for me is more abstract: via communitas the crucial underpinnings of social structure are being theorized. This lays the basis for understanding religion.8 It is an anthropological truism that religion has its roots in contradictions (whether in the intellectual or social domains). An appreciation of religion might therefore explore the possibilities of contradiction in connexion with communitas. I argue that the relevant contradiction here lies exactly in the relationship between communitas and structure, specifically that, on the one hand, communitas is formally antithetical to structure, whereas, on the other hand, communitas makes structure possible. Such a contradiction may be expected to permeate social existence. I suggest that religion, construed as a composite of fundamental processes of knowledge, emanates as people con- template this contradiction, in so doing confronting a root moral dilemma. It is proposed that many nomadic hunter-gatherer and certain other societies, with their simple, egalitarian structures, come ethnographically closest to such theorized circumstances and reveal such a root moral dilemma in sub- stantive terms. Egalitarianism does not equate exactly with communitas; as Sallnow (1981: 176) points out, processes other than conjunction, such as competition and reciprocity, are associated with egalitarianism. Yet if one is to speak of a primordial social communion, an ethos in which people uphold the value of minimal social differences in power and wealth plainly echoes it. Similarly, on the matter of contradiction: the developing inequalities, which in real human societies continually compromise egalitarianism, mimic the way structure theoretically compromises communitas. It follows that sha- manism is the ideal vehicle for isolating the nature of religious process. As an ethnographic preamble, a rough account of shamanism may be helpful. In this description the Canadian Inuit, a nomadic hunter-gatherer society, is firmly in mind, drawing on Rasmussen's outstanding texts. The Inuit shaman is more often a man, for in this society, as in many others where shamanism prevails, egalitarianism fails to extend fully to relations between men and women. The hallmark of a shamanistic cosmology must lie in the personage of the shaman. The notion of shaman marks a distinctive social role whose incumbent, through learned skills and supernatural bless- ing (normally spirit possession), is able to intercede with a spirit world that, by virtue of its control over undomesticated nature which it animates, has dispatched misfortune on humanity. The misfortune is explained as the work of angry spirits, incensed at people for failing to observe religious edicts. Pertinent here is the notion that the shaman, like all humans, has a soul: during trance the shaman's soul journeys to the spirit world, there to cajole</page><page sequence="5">DAVID RICHES 385 its residents once again to look kindly on the only-too-fallible humans and grant them good health, good weather and, above all, bounteous supplies of food which humans can secure only through interaction with the wild; the soul promises that the people will in future attend more assiduously to their religious duties. Emerging from the trance, the shaman announces that the plea has been heard and the request granted. Supposing people rectify their shortcomings, better times may be expected (for basic references, see foot- note 6). There are, of course, variations on this skeletal picture; for example, when witchcraft and sorcery prevail as supplementary themes, or where the spirit world is contacted without a soul joumey. Moreover, in pastoral and horti- cultural shamanistic societies, sacrifice frequently also occurs, evidently relating to the nurturing of plants and animals which an economy based on domesticated resources involves (e.g. Ingold 1986: 243-76). In such societies, shamanic endeavours conceming economic life are chiefly connected with 'external' factors which unpredictably impinge on the nurturing process from the outside, such as disease, ecological disaster, and so on. As to Canadian Inuit social organization, egalitarian values are incorpo- rated politically with regard to leadership and economically with regard to kinship sharing (cf Riches 1982). Thus no hunter, however able, may stand as structurally superior to others: no hunter has the right to be followed by others; everyone is entitled to exercise choice and decision without restric- tion - everyone's opinion has an equivalent right to be heard. Correspondingly, no social rules oblige specific individuals to reside in spe- cific communities with specific others; social groups, albeit articulated through ties of kinship, are accordingly amorphous in composition and fluid in membership. As to the economic sphere, kinship relations underpin a sharing of food throughout the community. A notable feature of Canadian Inuit egalitarianism, in common with many other hunter-gatherer societies, is the 'levelling-down' procedure (Lee 1988: 262-6) in which, by such meth- ods as 'rough good humour, put downs, teasing and sexual joking', those of superior ability are denied the chance of capitalizing on their skill. Yet, for all this there are social tendencies where such egalitarianism is countervailed. Thus hunters whose catches rank consistently above average and whose de- cisions about moving camp prove to be the most effective will come to exercise influence and be designated in the wider community as 'thinkers' (isumataaq). The analytical notion of prestige (Riches 1984) captures the quality of the relationship between such individuals and others. Inuit shamanism: a deductive analysis In this section I attempt, by deductive reasoning, to reveal some key ele- ments in the production of one particular body of cosmological knowledge. The deductive account is occasionally interrupted to square off the knowl- edge generated so far with the rough ethnographic facts as they are known.</page><page sequence="6">386 DAVID RICHES Limitations of space mean that the argument is rather schematic, though the following section explores one aspect of the ethnography in more detail. The contradiction underpinning religious process can be exposed, in the Inuit context, by attending to a central aspect of cosmology - the notion that animals, having souls and being subject to the control of spirits, willingly deliver themselves to the waiting hunter. What such cosmology suggests is that when hunting is successful, it is because animals consciously approach the hunters, rather than vice versa. This is counter-intuitive, for it implies that to ensure a full larder the hunter should concentrate more on religious observance than on skills with harpoon, bow or lance; yet, there is no ques- tion, Inuits deploy these latter skills assiduously. The contradiction in Inuit social experience is thus highlighted. It revolves around the circumstances of the economically successful in the community. These people are subject at the same time to both non-recognition (thanks to political and economic levelling) and recognition (as isumataaq). In other words, via egalitarianism, their standing is continually reduced, yet as their following increases their standing continually rises.9 Other studies have attended to the predicament of better hunters in an egalitarian social context. It has been argued that social mechanisms, such as prestige, function to prevent them leaving the community, even as they stand to lose out economically through having to share their spoils (e.g. Dowling 1968; Ingold 1986: 210). Yet if prestige is thus something special afforded the best hunters, this surely only accentuates dilemmas over egalitarian values (c? Riches 1984). The contradiction in Inuit social experience cannot be resolved through practical action; it may only be addressed via intellectual contemplation. The moral dilemma is obvious: how may actual superior (hunting) performance, inevitably delivered by some, be reconciled with the formal equality expected among all? Alternatively, since it is individuals who contemplate, the question might be rephrased: how may the superior hunter present a superior performance in an acceptable moral light? In response, embarking on the sequence of deductive reasoning, an initial element of Inuit cosmological knowledge is implicated: the idea that it is not the hunter, but some other non-human agent who is responsible for these successes.10 From this, the full cosmology of shamanism logically follows. Pursuing the logic, we have the following: with regard to hunting, feeling comfortable morally is associated with imputing to some non-human agent the capacity to exercise control over human fortune; the crux of hunting is the capture of the animal, so the imputation will be that the hand of the non-human agent, rather than the hand of the hunter, lies behind this cap- ture. To make it absolutely plain that the hunter's hand plays no part, it is through the animal that the non-human agent will be said to operate: the animal is required to deliver itself up - of its own volition. At this juncture, further knowledge has to be elaborated. This is in order to deal with situations when the hunting fails. The very notion of animals delivering themselves up to humans emanates from the Inuits' here-and-now</page><page sequence="7">DAVID RICHES 387 concern with moral upstandingness, so, when the failure of hunting is con- templated, this must be associated with an idea of moral impropriety. What of the content of such impropriety? It is some non-human agent which 'delivers' the animals to humans who need the flesh for food, so, by parsimony, it must be the same agent who is desisting when the animals fail to come, or when some comparable trauma occurs. The human impropriety behind this must therefore be affecting the non-human agent. The effect is evidently an adverse one, and so, because we are speaking about the opposi- tion between proper and improper behaviour, the supposition must be that the non-human agent refuses to deliver because certain human behaviour has given offence. The relevant impropriety thus comprises any behaviour which the non-human agent finds unacceptable. From this, two central ideas are necessarily entailed. The first is that the non-human agents have anthropomorphic qualities. Entities that take offence at human behaviour are likely to have human-like cognitive attributes and therefore physical and social characteristics similar to those of humans.11 Thus the non-human agents will be considered to have their own place(s) of residence (albeit in a non-human realm) and to be incorporated as elements in an uncentralized social system which, though different from the Inuit social system, must be imaginable by them. Above all, the non-humans must have decision-making capacities. Logically implied is a non-human world consisting of a plethora of entities, each with its autonomous domain of interest, and each liable to reciprocate human (mis)behaviour by withdrawing whatever resources, valuable to humans, it commands. And all this, which has thus been deduced logically, finds a counterpart in the 'reality' of Canadian Inuit cosmology. We describe Inuit cosmology as including a number of spirits (in some places generally known as tonrait), each exercising control over different aspects of the physical and organic world, some (the chief ones) living in distinct parts of the non- human world (sky, bottom of the sea), others implicitly incorporated in, for example, the animal itself (as the animal's volitional soul), and all quick to react when the human being (inuk) strays from what is, in spiritual terms, vitally important, each delivering such a reaction by withdrawing from human access good fortune in general and animals in particular. Rasmussen (1929: 58-81, 126-7) provides the classic reference which retails these ele- ments, including the origin myths in terms of which they find their legitimation (see also Rasmussen 1930: 232). At this point it is useful to comment on the existence of distinctive notions of the human person, which prevail in all societies, in order to clarify the relationship between spirits and animal souls in Inuit cosmology. The need for this discussion stems from the fact that the conceptualization of the human person requires a benchmark, some (non-human) 'other', with whom the human is contrasted: this 'other' is surely the animal prey. Thus the Inuit notion of animals as having souls has to be explicated further, specifically in relation to the spirit world which controls the animals' physical</page><page sequence="8">388 DAVID RICHES movement (dispatching them to, or withholding them from, the human hunter). The suggestion here is that this notion is generated from an evident intellectual contradiction concerning the reproduction of animals (cf Ingold 1986: 250): what the spirits, in their power, control, humans physically de- stroy. Such a tension between humans and spirits can be resolved through the idea that there is a non-physical side to animals, the soul, which is not destroyed, but is returned, via a brief rite of passage performed by the hunter, to the spirit domain, there to incarnate the next batch of animals destined for the human larder. For its part, the notion of the human person is qualita- tively different, as several commentators have observed in general terms (e.g. Ingold 1986; Bloch 1992: 38). With Inuit humans, as well as an immortal soul which, upon death, departs for ever to the spirits' domain, there is a 'name essence' which is incorporated in a newly-born infant named for the deceased (Weyer 1932: 274, 289; Guemple 1988: 134-7). The logic of this distinctive, double mystical feature of the Inuit human person (which even now is a simplification) is that, equivalently with animals, the human being must at some juncture participate in the spirit domain (thus the immortal soul); whilst, modelled on animals, there will be ideas to do with reproduction which specify some sort of recycling of spiritual essence in connexion with physical death and subsequent rebirth (thus the name essence). Note that Inuit conceptions of disease as resulting from soul-loss (to the spirits) cele- brate the relative autonomy of the mystical and the corporeal in the human being. The second idea logically entailed from the notion that non-human agents (whom we now dub variously as spirits and animal souls) may take offence at human misdemeanour is that of some means of intercession between humans and non-humans on behalf of the human interest. Implied here is a human initiative, not simply to see to it that the spirit's retaliation is brought to a close with all dispatch, but, first of all, to discover precisely what sort of behaviour counts as misdemeanour; as we shall see, the facility of soul loss is central here. The broad form this intercession can take will be constrained along two dimensions. First, the fundamental cosmological ideas, elaborated above, voicing the fact that control over human destiny ultimately rests with the spirits, cannot be contradicted. Second, given that the intercession crucially involves human social action, fundamental human social values may not be compromised. Ideas expressing these constraints will be centrally built into Inuit knowledge. On the first count there will be notions which state that, even as humans take the initiative in addressing the spirits, the spirits none- theless facilitate this initiative. Logically, one supposes that this facilitation will be achieved through human beings being imbued, by favour of the spirit world, with powers similar in kind to, though less potent than, the powers of autonomous spirits. On the second count, Inuit egalitarian principles mean that the human skills required to intercede with the spirits could be devel- oped in anyone (though more often in men than in women, as mentioned</page><page sequence="9">DAVID RICHES 389 earlier). To be sure, the activity is highly skilled, and so invites the presence in the community of a specialist. But it will be from the ranks of the whole community (not, for example, from some secret society, or from some par- ticular descent group) that such a specialist will be drawn. To emphasize that this is so, the transmission of the relevant skills should be effected through direct contact between novice and practised exponent in a straightforward apprenticeship (that is to say, unmediated through membership in particular, exclusive groups). Thus, supposing it is to a family member that the prac- tised exponent is to transmit skills, this will be through instruction and not through inheritance. The counterpart to this, in the 'reality' of Canadian Inuit cosmology, is the personage of the Inuit shaman (angatkuq), the com- munity's religious specialist who, uniquely possessed by special 'helping spirits' and supremely learned thanks to a long-term relationship with an older and more experienced exponent, represents the community in times of misfortune; in the context of an ecstatic, public trance his soul contacts the spirits by journeying to their lairs, there to extract concessions in response to the promise, offered by the people, of exemplary conduct in the future. Shamans are ambivalent people in Inuit society. Sometimes poor hunters, they charge for their services, demanding recompense for their skills (which they may also make available to neighbouring communities) even as this strictly violates egalitarian values (Brunton 1989: 679). Rasmussen (1929: 37-8, 133-41; 1930: 51-61) andJenness (1922: 200) provide classic references which retail these elements and which give details both of the (secret) magi- cal language by which the shaman claims an exclusive right to perform and, at the other extreme, of how shamans may indeed be deemed to have seri- ously transgressed key values when exacting payment, and in consequence may even be killed (see also Spencer 1959: 299-303, for comparable North Alaskan material). However, one element of shamanic power which cannot be gainsaid is that, by virtue of the exclusive visit to the spirit world, the shaman is placed perfectly to interpret the human misdemeanour which gives the spirits such offence; the nature of this 'interpretation' will be considered in the next section. How to be a successful shaman Like most systems of 'religious' representations, the Inuit 'cosmology', logi- cally existing out of the quest to resolve moral dilemmas, simultaneously offers an account of why misfortunes occur, and how they can be rectified. Moreover, it is evidently largely through the competence of the shaman that the truth of this cosmology is sustained: after all, it is the shaman's soul which visits the spirit world, and reports back. These facts together implicate the shaman in certain activities, a consideration of which throws fresh light on the salience of 'secondary elaborations', religious rules and systems of classification.</page><page sequence="10">390 DAVID RICHES We may start with the supposition that, in order to uphold their position, shamans may be expected to capitalize on the fact that an explication of misfortune is being given in the knowledge which cosmology enshrines. Manipulating the cosmology, they will set about dealing with misfortune: identifying the relevant human miscreancy and then subsequently promising an end to misfortune are things which the shaman, as a practical operator, must do as much and as successfully as possible. The problem for the sha- man is that, first, it can be difficult to identify who offended the spirits, and second, once the shaman's soul has returned from the spirit world heralding better times (supposing the person who gave offence has been persuaded to repent), things can actually take a turn for the worse. These sorts of predica- ments, especially the second, have often been described in respect of other cosmological systems (e.g., Evans-Pritchard 1937; cf Horton 1974: 162-3), with the standard comment that as long as continuing misfortune does not compromise the system's intellectual appeal, the integrity of the system is not jeopardized. And in Inuit cosmology, this seems to be achieved by means of so-called secondary elaborations wherein, among other notions, contin- ued misfortune comes to be attributed either to the shaman's own technical incompetence or, by extension, to the malevolence of a more powerful sha- man operating from a neighbouring community. When, in spite of the shaman's pleas, the spirits fail to respond, and the animals are still not to be seen, well, a better shaman would have had more success (for an Inuit reference, see Rasmussen 1929: 41, 132). Such secondary elaborations patently prevail in cosmological systems, yet I believe their function has been overplayed, in part because the cosmologies have been treated independently of the human beings through whose pur- poses they are sustained. Certainly, the idea that cosmologies exist in order to offer a high degree of intellectual comprehension of the experienced world comes to be enhanced through the existence of secondary elaborations: this notion lends the system an additional degree of coherency and consistency. However, this article suggests that it is moral concerns (to do with contradic- tions in the social), rather than an intellectual struggle to make sense of the experienced universe, which sustain a cosmology. And if moral concerns underpin a cosmology's existence, then, since such a system cannot be ex- pected to satisfy two functions with equal efficiency (c? Orans 1975), gaps in the intellectual comprehension of the world, from the analyst's point of view, can be expected, and from the believer's point of view might be found not to be too troubling (even when they are noticed). The work of Morris (1976) and Brunton (1980), highlighting the relative lack of order in different cos- mological systems, squares with such a presumption.12 Accordingly, the functional salience of secondary elaborations is lessened. A second dampener on the significance of secondary elaborations relates to matters of shamanic competence. It is illogical to claim that, thanks to secondary elaborations, the system of belief need not be undermined by the shaman's failures and weak- nesses; as I have proposed it, what intellectual strength the system possesses</page><page sequence="11">DAVID RICHES 391 stems, at least partly, from the shaman's practical successes - we might want to say that because the shaman alleviates misfortune people can subscribe to the system. If practical successes underpin the system, then it must be allowed that practical failures will, to some degree, undermine it - irrespective of any secondary elaborations. Thus attention is directed to the practical techniques through which the shaman endeavours to minimize such failures. There is a third, and related, point. It arises from the fact that a cosmology is sustained very significantly through the efforts of specialist practitioners who both enunciate it and elaborate on it more frequently (perhaps very much more frequently) than other members of the society. Given a social context where the assumption of social positions of influence rests solely on achievement (cf Riches 1982: 134-45), practitioners can be expected to seek their role only in so far as they may be confident of deriving some personal benefit from it. The very existence of practitioners, and hence the existence of the cosmological system in the precise form it takes, therefore depends on those who would fill the role being confident about their practical success. In respect of possible practical failures, we should focus less on the 'secondary elaborations' through which these failures are 'explained away', than on the shaman's techniques for minimizing these failures in the first place and thus enhancing their power. At this point, we have to plunge back into Inuit cosmology and pluck out the element which, until now, has been glossed over - the 'religious' edicts, or rules, which the people should obey lest the spirits take offence. There is a plethora of such rules. In content they do not refer to the basic rights and duties implied by the egalitarian, kin-based social structure. They are edicts in which the spirits, their interests by definition different from those of hu- mans, would particularly find appeal. In short, these rules will not be intrinsic to the basic Inuit social organization, but they may be expected to be remarkable and to refer to something highly significant in human social experience. Thus many are subsumed in life-cycle events; they amount to specifications of what should or should not be done in relation to such events. Some may reasonably be dubbed taboos (this follows the convention in the texts). Among the several Inuit areal groups (eg., Netsilik, Iglulik, Copper, Caribou) there is wide variation, as well as common themes, in the content of the rules. For example (all instances are from Rasmussen): at childbirth the woman must be secluded in her own lying-in house (1929. 172); menstruating women should not come close to hunted animals (1930: 98); a young man must never eat the flesh of the first animal of any species he kills (1929: 179); if anyone lies sick in the house, drops from the roof must not be wiped off (lest the soul of the sick person is thrown out with the dirt) (1929: 196); upon death, the family of the deceased may not work for five days (by which time the soul will have left the body) (1929: 263). Further rules are subsumed in the act of hunting. They are incorporated by the fact that with the death of the animal a soul - the soul of an animal - is rendered up.</page><page sequence="12">392 DAVID RICHES The careful hunter will always drip a piece of snow into the waterpail and let the water drip down into the seal's mouth. It is said that seals are always thirsty, and they often let themselves be killed just to get a drink of water (1931: 166) Other rules are more puzzling and reek of paradox. Most prohibit certain juxtapositions of things, activities and places. For example, 'fresh caribou meat must never lie on the side platform together with seal meat and salmon trout' (1932: 38). Many such taboos have to do with the sewing of clothing. Using Netsilik and Iglulik Inuit ethnography, I shall examine one such taboo in detail, in order to demonstrate a relationship between the content of such rules and successful shamanic practice; this is the rule, valid in late autumn following the close of caribou hunting, that when the women in the camp are preparing garments from the caribou skins, seal hunting at the nearby water's edge is prohibited (1929: 192; 1931: 24). I call this rule the sewing taboo, and the location by the shore where people have collected to sew winter garments, the sewing place. As to explanation, one approach enquires into whether there is an ecologi- cal basis to the taboo: is such a taboo necessary if an ecological balance is to be struck between human population and natural environment? Would the very stability of the human population in its ecological context be jeopard- ized if the taboo did not exist? It sounds unlikely that this should be so, yet there is a school of thought which holds that the key to any social custom lies in a 'cultural' drive for an ecological equilibrium - a drive of which members of the society are deemed to be oblivious (Harris 1984; cf Riches 1991: 290-2). Actually, this cultural materialist approach is quite suggestive as regards the sewing taboo. An argument may be made that the autumn sewing taboo sustains demo- graphic levels in the Inuit population by encouraging co-operation between able and less able hunters throughout the ensuing, economically precarious winter hunting season, when the hunter famously stands guard over the breathing holes in the ice that seals keep open to reach air (Balikci 1970: 56-80). Without the sewirng taboo, one could propose, there would be a risk that abler hunters would attempt to go it alone through winter, jeopardizing the survival chances of less able hunters - and thus, in the longer term, the survival chances of the entire population. The reasoning here rests on the fact that, during the two or three weeks when caribou skin clothes are being prepared, all hunting effectively stops, for seals are the only reliably available quarry at this time of year. Therefore families have to rely for food on stores built up from summer hunting. This means that the summer stores become depleted and shared around among the members of the camp, and so everyone commences winter hunting on a level (and levelled down) footing - and so everyone's subsequent mutual co-operation is stimulated. Although it is superficially plausible, we must dismiss this ecological ex- planation of the sewing taboo. It cannot be proven (cf Orans 1975). Granted, we can show that ecological benefits flow from the custom's exist- ence. But how may we tell whether these benefits are truly significant or</page><page sequence="13">DAVID RICHES 393 not? The ecological approach invites us to assume that they are truly signifi- cant, for it postulates that the custom fulfils a fundamental ecological need: it implies that societies which failed to introduce this custom were unable to survive in the harsh arctic conditions. Yet we are unable to demonstrate that this is so, since we cannot perform an experiment to see what happens when a society without this custom, but othervvise identical to the Inuit, is placed in the same environment. We are left to conclude that the sewing taboo, probably in common with most other Inuit customs, has but a trivial contri- bution to make to the cause of ecological balance. In any case, even with ample stores behind them, one surmises that less able and more able hunters alike would appreciate the need for mutual co-operation through the winter (the more able can themselves very easily experience bad luck). We should search for another reason for the custom. The anthropology of symbolic classification supplies a quite different interpretation. This upholds a human propensity to order the external world by apprehending it through culturally and historically deep-rooted (i.e. un- conscious) systems of classification or categories - systems which, in turn (many anthropologists argue), relate to fundamental aspects of the respective social structure (e.g. Douglas 1970). It produces the idea, relevant here, that objects or events which threaten the integrity of such a system of classifica- tion are liable to be conceived of as powerful or dangerous - and so likely to be hedged in by religious edicts or prohibitions. In this regard, Mauss and Beuchat, writing in 1904-5, proposed, on behalf of the Inuit, that the con- ceptual apprehension of the annual round as constituting summer and winter phases was the fundamental classificatory division: distinct summer and winter social organizations and distinct summer and winter ritual life are mediated by this division (Mauss &amp; Beuchat 1979). An alternative opinion was offered by Jenness (1922: 181-4) who maintained that the fundamental classification reflected a conceptual division between land and sea. On the face of it, the sewing taboo may be interpreted in terms of either thesis. Preventing seal hunting whilst making caribou skin garments at the sewing place amounts to upholding a separation between summer/land products (represented through caribou) and winter/sea products (represented through seals). The many other taboos implying the miNing of seal and caribou products could be handled in a similar manner. However, upon closer inspection, both such perspectives look dubious. Specifically, during spring, when one may suppose that the basic summer/winter and land/sea distinctions remain valid as constructed realities, these sorts of taboos are attended to far less assiduously (Rasmussen 1929: 191). Accordingly, we might pursue another suggestion, still within cognitive anthropology. This is that humans reduce via a system of classificatory categories even the passage of time (e.g. Leach 1961). Thus events and activities appropriate for marking off chunks of time tend to be given special symbolic credence. Among the traditional Inuit, it is especially in autumn that such a temporal divide occurs (people give up land</page><page sequence="14">394 DAVID RICHES hunting and come down to the coast); accordingly, during this season, the separation of land and sea products can carry a symbolic load relating to the enunciation of this divide. Hence, it is at this time of year that the taboos prohibiting the simultaneous utilization of land and sea products are deci- sively invoked. In contrast, in spring, travel inland becomes possible again, while conditions for seal hunting remain good. There being no abrupt change from sea back to land, this time of year offers little scope for symboli- cally marking the passage of time. Such 'cognitive' explanations of Inuit taboos, in which the religious rules are seen as contingent on the existence of systems of classifications are sug- gestive, yet in my view are mistaken, not least in supposing that such systems of classification (land/sea, etc.) constitute deep cultural and historical givens presumably necessary for human social existence. I favour an alternative position, which is that cultural forms - taboos, systems of classification, or whatever - are sustained through the strategic work of individuals (cf Riches 1985). Received wisdom concerning the relationship between taboos and systems of classification may accordingly be upturned. The argument would be that individuals, desiring to promote a body of taboos, construct a system of classification in order that those taboos may find a rationale. Of course, such a construction presupposes a knowledge of the possibilities both of classifica- tion and (in the case of some taboos) anomaly and paradox in respect of such classification. The latter are relatively unproblematic: anomalies are an inher- ently intriguing element in any intellectual exercise in which classificatory schemes are actively constructed. As to 'knowledge of the possibilities of classification', one hypothesizes that a single, primordial classification event functions paradigmatically in this regard. In the case of the Inuit, such a primordial classification event might well be the initial differentiation be- tween human and non-human agents, which underpins the entire cosmological system (within which the role of the shaman is subsumed). Such an argument clearly implies that systems of classification are less sig- nificant in human cognition than some writers claim. Helpful in this regard is the position adopted, from a somewhat different standpoint, by Bloch (1985). For Bloch, people's apprehension of the envi- ronment is much more fundamentally informed by (at least in part) precultural, and probably universal, human mental propensities (for which, as a matter of fact, he believes the term 'cognition' should be reserved). One might also note that some cultures, such as the Hill Pandaram, barely incor- porate classificatory categories at all (Morris 1976). It follows from this that - if we may return to the subject of Inuit taboos - we should be asking in whose interests these particular edicts exist. The answer, surely, is the shaman. 7The shaman as cosmology maker In this section I address a problem with which shamans must contend if they are to sustain their power, privileges and position. It is that the shaman's</page><page sequence="15">DAVID RICHES 395 identification, from knowledge provided by the spirits, of specific individuals whose transgressions have given the spirits offence must be a plausible one (Balikci 1963). The shaman will be expected to exercise a certain social competence, where possible laying charges of miscreancy on someone who is thought generally to be anti-social - this observation is now a common- place of anthropology. But plausibility may be improved by manipulating the edicts themselves. As much is intimated by Rasmussen who says, of Iglulik shamans: 'But should the shaman have nothing definite to go on, he will keep to matters of ordinary everyday life in which he can be sure that all the women offend the taboo' (1929: 132). The point is, the greater the number of edicts, and the greater the extent to which they are linked to ordinary everyday activity, the more likely it is that those who stand accused will accept the accusation. This being so, we may look again at the whole gamut of edicts prevailing in Inuit cosmology, where we find these suppositions confirmed. First, there are those associated with key life-cycle occurrences such as birth, coming-of-age and death (not to mention the death of animals in hunting). With regard to these recurring occasions, it may be proposed that they incorporate taboos less because some human social need exists for them to be marked symbolically, as because religious specialists, desiring to proliferate taboos, need to 'put' them somewhere. As to the taboos of the 'paradoxical' type, these are clearly associated with activities in which people regularly engage (Balikci 1970: 219-24) - such activities as cooking, eating and sewing, which will function as 'daily reminders' (Fortes 1967: 17) of the taboos' import. It is suggested that the latter taboos are distinguished from everyday activity (as plainly they must be, since taboos cannot be imposed in blanket fashion on the ordinary run of affairs) by their very paradoxical nature. In the first place, such paradoxicality means that the activities which are liable to be tabooed are, in probability, not likely to occur very often, although it is not impossible for them to occur. Secondly, this paradoxicality renders the activities interesting, noteworthy and so, above all, potentially memorable. Finally, the paradoxicality may be cited as the very justification for their being made taboo: the activities may be picked out for their intrigu- ing oddness and so readily proposed as not quite proper. In sum, the creation and sustaining of such taboos is an intrinsic part of shamanic strategy: these taboos exist because shamans need them and so 'make' them. Both theory and ethnography may be invoked to support this case. On the matter of theory I refer to discussion about the performance of the specialist in the construction of cosmological systems, and specifically to the work of Barth (1987), who has examined diverse cosmological developments in neighbouring sub-traditions among the Mountain Ok of New Guinea. Barth argues that, within the social and cultural context which prevails among the Mountain Ok, religious specialists are instrumental in initiating this diversity, their creativity involving such processes as effecting incremental shifts in the connotation of particular symbols and elaborating the scope of particular logical schemata, the overt symbolic content in any instance being inspired in</page><page sequence="16">396 DAVID RICHES part by deep-seated personal symbolizations. In this article the aim is to demonstrate something ultimately rather different. It is to grasp the nature of a universal 'religious process'. Since, as has been noted, the role of the relig- ious specialist is, in part, a product of this process, a focus on the specialist's activities cannot be a means to understand this process in its totality. In fact, it has been intimated that certain crucial elements in this process arise from the contemplation of particular social exigencies by laypeople. On the specific ethnographic matter of Inuit taboos, the process Barth identifies appears to be generally apt. In the first place, the various neigh- bouring Inuit areal groups, which correspond roughly to the several Ok sub-traditions (cf Riches 1982), exemplify substantial differences where the details of taboos are concerned, as Rasmussen, the ethnographer of the main four 'central' groups, notes (e.g., 1932: 38). In the second place, the sheer number of taboos acknowledged by each 500-member group is quite stag- gering (e.g. Rasmussen 1929: 169-203) - a striking testimony to human creativity. Thirdly, the interest in both the veracity and power of taboos seems to lie strongly on the shaman's side. Rasmussen's dramatic account of an Iglulik seance, in which a shaman interrogates a patient as to the taboos she has broken, exemplifies this (1929: 133-41). The patient willingly con- fesses to each past transgression, but the shaman refuses to rest content, invoking more, and yet more, breaches of taboo (in the end, around thirty taboos in all are proclaimed). The audience's attitude is in striking contrast. Even as the shaman invokes his authority on behalf of the import of the rules (and hence the seriousness of the transgressions), the audience, to the point almost of insurrection, cry out: 'We will not take any notice of that [breach]'; 'It is such a slight offence'; 'Oh, is that all?'; 'Oh, such a trifling thing'. Occasionally, the audience remarks 'That is very wrong.. .a great and serious offence', but this is quickly followed by 'But let her be released nonetheless!' Between the Canadian Inuit areal groups there is some, though not much, social contact (the groups are highly endogamous). Yet there are similar broad cultural themes where the taboos are concerned, notwithstanding the many differences in detail. And within each group, with respect to the huge number of taboos, there is a substantial cognitive integration (many such taboos fall in the land/sea classification, many others in the 'polluting woman' category, etc.). The model of the shaman as proliferator of taboos shows shamans imitating one another both within and between areal groups, even as they uphold their individual identities by sustaining idiosyncrasies within their own particular repertoires. Religious process in the whole cosmological system The task in this section is to describe religious processes in schematic terms, in a manner which stands independently of any particular society. In previous sections insights into these processes have been secured through concentrat- ing, with reference to a single representative society (Inuit), on the cosmology (shamanism) prevalent in egalitarian social settings. There is no</page><page sequence="17">DAVID RICHES 397 reason, in principle, why similar insights might not have been established by attending to other types of cosmology in non-egalitarian settings. This is despite the fact that the greater the empirical departure such settings are from communitas, the more difficult it will be to discern religious process: in non-egalitarian settings 'local' moral agendas may be expected to overlay the root moral dilemma13 - the negation of communitas by social structure - which, it is proposed, underpins this process. The description of 'religious process' in societies without egalitarian organization - and, in contrast to the Inuit, in circumstances where the negation of communitas is not under- pinned by material factors - is something for further research, as is the consideration of other religious elements that, in many societies (especially societies other than the Inuit), stand side by side with shamanism. Note, however, that religious process is clearly apparent, at some level, in ostensibly secular bodies of knowledge. For example, the attribution of responsibility for social success (and, by implication, personal disaster) to non-human agents is clearly evident in science and monetarism and Marxism. We speak of molecular 'behaviour' (likewise the behaviour of electrons, viruses, etc.) which, given 'respect', can render enormous human benefit (failing to offer such respect amounts to taking immense risks). We speak of having to con- cede to the 'hidden hand' of economic functioning (one bucks market forces at one's peril). And (sometimes these days), we talk of being liable to the inexorable force of class 'exploitation'.14 The problem in displaying religious process schematically is that the in- vestigation so far, via the perusal of Inuit shamanism, is coloured by the anthropologist's reasoning: it is well-known that an explicitly deductive ap- proach can be vulnerable to the manipulations of the analyst. For some theoretical approaches in anthropology this hazard is treated as a small price to pay. But other approaches, specifically those which prefer to delineate religious process in terms of people's meanings, would find it incomplete: to assume a homology between analyst's and actors' reasonings is unwarranted. Yet, in my view, it will be supremely difficult to produce a satisfactory inter- pretive account where the raw ethnographic material is something as complex as an entire cosmology, in terms both of deciding on the element of this cosmology with which to begin, and of grasping the way this element is anchored in further, encompassing meanings. The worth of the deductive account is that it both proposes 'where to begin' and, suitably rearranged (in fact, virtually reversed), offers a suggestive account of the respective encom- passing meanings; further research is thereby stimulated. I now sketch an interpretive account of cosmology, which begins at the point deduction ended - with the fact of specialists (shamans) upholding special rules (taboos, authorized by the spirits) as appropriate for human (Inuit) behaviour. (A relationship of power is evident here, which is promis- ing.) How such action is embedded in ever-subsuming meaning is then elucidated, according to methodological principles grounded in the assump- tion that in human society both actions and notions exist by virtue of the</page><page sequence="18">398 DAVID RICHES advantage that flows to individuals who consciously perform/invoke them (Riches 1984; 1991; cf Holy &amp; Stuchlik 1983).15 Couched in a manner which respects the crucial significance of social context with regard to all individual activity, these principles are: (i) discovery of 'intention': for each action performed or notion upheld, the goals (purposes) this attains must be established; (ii) discovery of 'rationality': for each action performed/notion upheld, the basis for it having been chosen must be revealed; (iii) discovery of 'legitimacy': the manner in which the action/notion, having been intro- duced into the social arena by only some people, is presented as being worthy of respect in a wider constituency, must be specified. On this basis I shall elucidate religious process, with accompanying comment. Note that distinct meanings corresponding to two categories of individual - specialist and lay - will be discerned, the latter subsuming the former. This means that the activities carried on by the former are given licence in terms of notions held by the latter. The initial focus in the interpretive analysis of cosmology, then, is the specialist who, on everyone's behalf, upholds the notion of certain rules as authorized by particular entities interrelated in some system.16 Religious process comprises the items of knowledge which successively encompass this notion (and which therefore may be said to have generated it). Such process, I have intimated, may be delineated in terms of the purposes, rationality and legitimacy of the activities of specifically implicated actors, as follows (key elements are capitalized or italicized; notes of commentary are bracketed off): with reference to the SPECIALIST (who upholds a notion of rules authorised by entities in some system), PURPOSE. This relates to the rewards (payments, privileges) which accrue. Such concrete benefits make deploying such 'professional' skills worthwhile. RATIONALITY This relates to the system of interrelated entities to which the special- ist has unique access. The specialist elects to secure reward specifically through uphold- ing an idea of rules authorized in such a system, because by being able uniquely to interpret the system, and hence the rules, the specialist secures power which is un- available to everyone else. [Note that the 'interpretation of the system' will include such activities as promoting secondary elaborations, schemes of classificatory catego- ries, and so on.] LEGITIMACY. The above notion, of a system (authorizing rules) to which unique access is granted a specialist who in return for his trouble secures rewards, is upheld by the layperson as of value. [Comment: The layperson's purposes, rationality and legitimacy in upholding the worth of such a notion clearly constitute crucial meanings in religious process.] Therefore: with reference to the LAYPERSON ( who upholds a notion of a system to which unique access is privileged to a specialist). PURPOSE. This relates to the advantages to the person's well-being which, via the spe- cialist, flow from the 'system'. Such concrete benefits make acceptance of a system, specialist, etc., worthwhile.</page><page sequence="19">DAVID RICHES 399 RATIONALITY. This relates to the fact that the entities which, interrelated, make up the system are different in kindfrom people. People elect to uphold the worth of the specialist as the means for interaction with the 'system', because the entities making up the system cannot directly be 'reached' through normal human competences. [Note: considerations of notions of the human person arise precisely from the fact that the 'entities' are different in kind from 'people'.] LEGITIMACY. The above notion, that the system brings well-being, is upheld through invoking a notion that the system affects all people in all their lives. The point here is that it is individuals who invoke the above notions on behalf of the well-be- ing of their personal selves and of people close to them. Other people's acquiescence in their so doing has therefore to be secured, and this is achieved by reminding them that they, too, are liable to the 'system's' powers. Legitimacy is, in short, delivered through the notion that the system is omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. THIS AMOUNTS TO A REPRESENTATION: such a notion eectively states that re- sponsibility for what people do or say does not lie in their hands. IN TURN, since social action is, by definition, a means to personal advantage (see above), the notion effectively denies that people are responsible when advantage nonetheless accrues. [Comment: the notion upholds the supreme value of communitas.] YET, the presumption, by this writer, is that people's social actions are goal directed in some conscious manner: that their actions are strategically to secure advantage is something of which people are aware. [Comment: the contradiction between communitas and social structure - captured in the simultaneous denial and acceptance of advantage - is at the root of religious process.] Three final observations are in order. First, this composite of knowledge- process, present wherever there is cosmology, should be named. It seems to me that to label it 'religious' does not unduly violate commonsense meanings of the term. Second, the approach to 'religion' provided here steers a novel course between orthodox sociological, cultural and intellectual views of cos- mology. It respects the foundational significance of the social in any such inquiry (Durkheim 1964; cE Morris 1987); yet it insists that the connexion between the social and cosmology is mediated via the contemporaneous activities of specific types of human actor. It validates the salience of cosmol- ogy as a complex of cultural notions, including notions of classification and of extra-human authorization of activities and events; yet it insists that, rather than treating cosmology thus construed as some deep-rooted determi- nant of action (in this manner begging the question of its origins), the task is to demonstrate how such notions emerge at the moment of social structure.17 It recognizes that cosmologies tell an intellectual story about the universe; yet it insists that this is a function in which specialists, much more than laypeople, invest: in relation to laypeople, such a function is as much an unintended consequence of cosmology as its raison d'etre. Finally, we return to another commonplace of anthropology, the fact that elements of cosmology (spirits, ancestors, myth, etc.) become implicated in order that secular social rules might receive support: they function, vis-a-vis the institutional in social</page><page sequence="20">400 DAVID RICHES life, as charters, obscurers of societal contradictions, celebrators of morality, and so on. I would point to a conundrum here. There appears to be no inherent reason why the institutional actually needs such religious support: the distribution of secular power in society ought to be meeting this function satisfactorily18 Yet religious notions patently are invoked for secular ends. There may be many resolutions of this conundrum, and the reasoning in this article suggests one. It is that invoking religious support on behalf of secular rules and actions is modelled, by people, on the way specialists construct 'religious' rules to sustain a position of power. Shamans effectively bolster themselves via religious rules; might not laypersons enhance the righteous- ness of their activities in similar fashion? NOTES Earlier versions of this article were presented at the conference, 'Cosmologies of Po- lar Peoples', organized by the Traditional Cosmology Society (Edinburgh), and at a so- cial anthropology department seminar at the University of St Andrews. My thanks are due to the participants on those occasions for their helpful comments, and likewise to the editor of Man and one of my anonymous referees. 1 Limitations of space mean that I can only allude, in passing, to other theories of religion. However, I should explicitly note that I avoid providing a definition of the 'phenomenon'. The weakness of anthropological discourse about religion is that too much time has been taken up by a search for a definition. The problem with defini- tion-led inquiry is that it too readily leads the investigator (i) to assume what has to be proved, (ii) to be misled by western concepts, in terms of which 'religion' typically connotes 'something extra' (belief? emotionality?) not prevailing in the context of 'secular relationship'(cf. Horton 1960: 211-2), (iii) to be diverted into functionalist ex- planations, focusing as these do on a (defined) phenomenon's consequences rather than on what generates it. In this article I elucidate the generation of certain human socio-intellectual processes in relation to certain theorized societal first principles. These processes must be called something, but my argument clearly does not stand or fall on whether or not 'religion' is the appropriate term (cf. Spiro 1965: 91). Although the aim of the article is to elucidate 'religion' as an analytical category connoting cer- tain distinctive socio-intellectual processes, I still sometimes use 'religion' as an odd- job word (e.g. connoting the supernatural), especially in early parts of the discussion; this should be plain from the context. 2 As the context should clearly indicate, I am distinguishing 'cosmology' from 'cos- mological function'. The former term simply has a descriptive task - to label a body of knowledge which makes a statement about 'the universe'. Cosmological function labels a particular theoretical view about the salience of cosmology in human affairs. 3 Just as 'small is beautiful', simple is subtle. 'Simple' is not construed here pejora- tively and, in common with other writers (e.g. Knauft 1987), I use the phrase 'simple structure' because it aptly conveys the character of a particular, challenging type of so- cial structure. 4 There is excellent material on Alaskan Inuit cosmology, not least in first-rate con- temporary studies such as that of Fienup-Riordan (1983). Yet the Alaskan Inuit have quite complex social structures which, on a religious plane, their large communal</page><page sequence="21">DAVID RICHES 401 ceremonies no doubt reflect. For my purposes, to dwell on the Alaskan Inuit would only complicate matters. 5 Two points deserve notice here. First, the notion of egalitarianism is being used here quite loosely, simply to capture the nature of the social values which predominate in 'simple-structured societies'. I am not referring to the much narrower category of societies which Woodburn (1982) has named 'egalitarian societies'. Secondly, there is the whole question of the existential status of some such simple-structured societies, a matter debated with particular vigour with reference to the San (Bushman) (e.g. Schrire 1984). Are such societies but historical products of an experience with coloni- alism or with surrounding, politically more powerful societies? The crucial issue here is not in fact history, but whether or not these societies may be deemed, in the pre- sent, to be sustaining themselves relatively independently of their neighbours. If they may be so deemed, it seems to me that, because they are simple-structured, even if they do not exemplify historical continuity with the 'stone age', they present an inter- esting insight into what stone age society might have been: they are, therefore, of evo- lutionary significance. Here I note that Woodburn (1988), in a meticulous empirical demonstration, has argued that many such societies do exist in present times in relative independence. 6 Hunter-gatherer shamanism is excellently described, for example, by Rasmussen (1929; 1930; 1931; 1932) for the Inuit, by Tanner (1979) for the northern Canadian Indians, by Endicott (1979) for the Batek Negritos, and by Morris (1980) for the Hill Pandaram, among others. Bourguignon (1977) remarks on the ubiquitous persistence of shamanism among aboriginal hunting people in the New World (see also, Morris 1980: 214). Shirokogoroff (1935) is the classic work on the shamanism of northern North Asian pastoralists. Documentation on the Piaroa is from Overing Kaplan (1975) and Overing (1990), the Gebusi from Knauft (1985), the Baktaman from Barth (1975) and the Chewong from Howell (1984). Among some of the non-hunter-gatherers here, descent groups prevail, but they are weakly incorporated and their function is not always clear (e.g. Ingold 1979; cf Humphrey 1980). In addition, shamanism prevails in yet other societies if one defines the category a little more broadly. For example, on such grounds Bushman religion is shamanistic. According to Katz (1976), some 50 per cent. of men and 33 per cent. of women are 'masters of the ghosts', but some of these people are quite evidently renowned as be- ing much more powerful than others, it being said of them that they received their capabilities directly from the gods (1976: 295-6; Marshall 1969). More complexly, the same categorization can be given to Iban religion (ensen 1974). The (analytical) no- tion of shaman seems to cover a composite of four distinct Iban social roles: the tuai rumah who guards the moral code, the tuai burung who is possessed by spirits, the le- mambang who journeys to the spirit world, and the manang who heals the spiritually afflicted. Stretching the categorization further, 'spirit mediumship' might be incorpo- rated into the notion of shamanism without violating the latter term as an analytical concept. 7 Carrithers (1990) is clearly grasping similar ideas through the notion of 'sociality, and is placing them in an explicitly evolutionary context. For anthropologists working within, or close to, the paradigm of methodological individualism, such as myself, such notions are crucial in order to lay to rest the spectre of the 'non-social individual'. As I show later, a context of more encompassing meanings, in part serving legitimating</page><page sequence="22">402 DAVID RICHES functions, is always pertinent to an individual's activities. In the last analysis some such notion as communitas serves as the ultimate encompassing meaning. 8 I have tried to lay out here, as a basis for understanding religion, a constitution of society. Via communitas and social structure I intend to capture something founda- tional about human social life, which underwrites the processes of individuals and groups. Moreover, notwithstanding the way these concepts are defined, they do not amount to a dichotomy: the one (structure) presupposes the other (communitas). Turner's 'existential communitas' is obviously the closest empirical counterpart to the theorized communitas with which I am concerned. 9 The presumption here is that moral questions relating to the violation of egalitari- anism pertain entirely to the activities of the successful, rather than to the circum- stances of those, the 'impoverished', who have fallen through the net. It seems not unreasonable to suppose that it is the potentially politically strong who are overwhelm- ingly the more likely to jeopardize the fortunes of an ideal of equality. 10 Brunton has offered a similar argument (1989: 679). Where there is egalitarian- ism, the ethos may be appropriately upheld if people's evaluative and inventive activity is deemed to come not from 'their own cognitive and creative processes, but by com- municating with the gods, ancestors or spirits.' 11 Guthrie (1980) has proposed that anthropomorphism is the distinctive feature of religious discourse. For him, humans will inevitably model the external world through symbols which evoke human-like faculties. The perspective in this article is, of course, entirely different. For me anthropomorphic notions arise through attempts to grasp the nature of distinctively social existence. Such notions, if anything, then produce the very existence of an external universe. But (evolutionarily speaking) this all occurs at the very instant of the emergence of society as such - at the moment of the social 'big bang. So humans in society are never without cosmological conceptualizations. 12 Speaking of the 'relatively egalitarian' Melanesian societies, Brunton maintains that, 'we are probably not justified in assuming there is a basic human need to develop comprehensive and consistent responses to what we might see as fundamental existen- tial questions' (1980: 123). 13 In consequence, the 'manipulative' relation, between humans and spirits, a crucial element in 'religious process' may, as Horton (1960: 212) intimates, come partially to be overlain by a relation of 'communion'. 14 That such abstract entities as molecules, monetary flow and class relations in some manner or other 'behave' surely bespeaks of anthropomorphism; therefore, in Guthrie's terms (1980); science and the rest embody religious process. The latter is directly suggested in Overing's study (1990), which explicitly evokes the shaman (and the scientist) as 'makers of the world'. 15 We do not need to be unduly exercised by the notion of 'conscious' here. By 'consciously' one means 'with deliberation'. But deliberation may, when activities are repeated time and again, become automatic or stereotyped: one does not any more 'think about' the activity as one does it. However, in such situations the conscious rea- son for the activity can always be restated by the actor should, for example, a challenge occur. See the discussion in Stuchlik (1977: 9). 16 'System' is used here as a shorthand to denote the interrelationships among the 'entities' (by which I obviously have in mind, in the case of shamanism, spirits, souls and the like). The term does not necessarily connote a total coherency, or integrated- ness, in these interrelationships, or anything approaching it.</page><page sequence="23">DAVID RICHES 403 17 Bird-David (1990), speaking of precisely the sorts of hunter-gatherer societies in which I am interested, evokes a cultural perspective on hunter-gatherer activities relat- ing to the economy, which is certainly reminiscent of this study. According to her, cognizing the environment as inherently benevolent (as a 'giving environment', thanks to the spirits which animate it) disposes hunter-gatherers to share food in the manner for which they are well-known. The present study, with its different orientation, ex- plains why it is that hunter-gatherers construe their environment in this way. 18 Horton (1968: 626) recognizes the issue in a similar way, in commenting on the prevalence of religious elements in political manipulation: he asks, why do not people couch their political arguments more directly?

Le chamanisme : la cle pour comprendre le phenomene religieux R6sumtW Cet article ordonne d'une maniere schMmatique un nombre composite de processus sociaux et intellectuels qu'on retrouve dans toute cosmologie, et qui peuvent, en toute justification, etre qualifi&amp;s de religieux. Cette etude du chamanisme, la religion qui pr&amp;vaut dans les soci&amp;t&amp;s aux structures sociales simples, et aux cosmologies qui laissent entrevoir le processus religieux, suit une forme de raisonnement dMductif. Les Inuit du Canada (Eskimo) servent d'exemple ethnographique. L'auteur part du principe que le processus religieux prend racine dans les conditions memes de l'existence sociale, et les contradic- tions fondamentales qui la constituent, ou, en d'autres termes, dans l'antithese qui oppose les structures sociales 'communitas'. C'est en mMditant sur ces contradictions que les gens ordinaires, tout comme les sp&amp;cialistes (chaque groupe &amp;tant animE par leurs int&amp;rets particuliers), engendrent la pens&amp;e cosmologique. L'auteur aborde Egalement des ques- tions d'analyse culturelle centrales comme l'existence de concepts distincts d6finissant la personne humaine, ou la pertinence des '6laborations secondaires', des systemes de classification ou des edits religieux pour l'&amp;tude des religions. Finalement, l'auteur se joint a Barth qui, lui aussi, insiste sur la pro6minence du sp&amp;cialiste religieux dans le processus de cr6ation cosmologique.
