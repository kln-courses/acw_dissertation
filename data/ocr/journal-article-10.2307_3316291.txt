Interpretation of the Maior Evidence Summary</page><page sequence="2">INTRODUCTION THE purpose of the present paper is to review, as objectively as possible, the main lines of empirical evidence pro and con bearing upon the problem of evolution as regards the human body and the human mind. The paper is written primarily for the non- professional reader. The first part of the paper, on human bodily evolution, covers evidence thoroughly familiar to the professional anthropologist. He is therefore advised to save his time by skip- ping it, and to pass at once to the second part, on mental evolution, covering evidence less frequently brought into the anthropological court. The theological and philosophical implications of the evidence and of inferences therefrom will not be touched upon.1 The empirical or factual sciences render their best service to the cause of knowledge by confining their attention to those phases of a given problem that come within their competence,-in other words, by minding their own business. They render their best service to the theologian and philosopher by gathering, organizing and in- terpreting the facts at their command, and by then turning over to theology and philosophy the empirical data and such immediate inferences therefrom as appear warranted. The rest of the job is up to the theologian and philosopher. Our review will therefore be exclusively from the anthropological standpoint, with such data added from kindred sciences, particularly psychology, as are needed to fill out the picture. On the question of the evolution of the human mind psychology has to be drawn upon heavily. The question is, in fact, primarily within the psychological field although cultural and linguistic anthropology has a good deal to contribute toward the solution. In the relatively short space at-our disposal, only the high points can be dealt with, and not all of these. We shall take up only the more characteristic or more significant evidence, and this largely by way of illustration or representative sampling. Of the evidence bearing upon the evolution of the human body, there is readily available a great number of satisfactory compilations and interpre- 1Readers interested in relations of Catholic theology to evolution will find references in bibliography, section I, at end of present paper PRIMITIVE MAN 2</page><page sequence="3">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION tations from Catholic as well as non-Catholic pens. So this seg- ment of our problem will be handled briefly. Of, however, the evidence bearing upon the evolution of the human mind, the avail- able compilations and interpretations, Catholic and non-Catholic, are, or appear to the present writer, strangely meager and inade- quate He has searched in vain for a couple of decades to find a thorough review and discussion of the evidence, such a review and discussion as would take into account the more recent data that have been accumulating from the fields of anthropology, compara- tive psychology, and human psychology. We shall deal with this half of our problem a little more in detail, but, even so, such treat- ment, within our limits of space and also within the limitations of the writer, will have to be somewhat sketchy. All we can hope is to make a start and to open up the subject, or perhaps to set up a target to be shot at. In dealing with the problem of the evolution of the human mind, there will be no question of the evolution of the soul as such. By the soul we understand the ultimate internal principle by which we think, feel, and will, and by which our bodies are animated, and which is endowed not only with rational powers but with free will and immortality. The problem of immortality is outside the scope of the empirical sciences. The question of the evolution of free will is under only exceptional or incidental discussion by them. We shall therefore discuss solely the evolution of the human mind, and more specifically of conceptual or rational thinking. A. THE HUMAN BODY The theory that man's body is the result, through mutation or through other evolutionary process, of evolution is accepted by scientists today with practical unanimity. Some consider the theory conclusively demonstrated, or at least "established "; others con- sider it probable or highly probable; others consider it the most satisfying hypothesis to account for the facts that we have. As for Catholic scientists, so far as the present writer can judge from their writings as well from correspondence and oral discussion with a considerable number of them, their attitude as a group toward human bodily evolution is in the main sympathetic. But our problem is not one of counting noses. It is one of evaluating 3</page><page sequence="4">evidence. Fifty thousand scientists, like fifty thousand men in the street, can be wrong. They can, however, also be right. It all depends on the evidence. I. THE EVIDENCE FOR THE CHASM The chief line of evidence adduced against the theory of human bodily evolution is the deep chasm that yawns between the body of man and the body of even those mammals that are nearest physically to man, namely, the anthropoid apes. These are the gorilla and chimpanzee of Equatorial Africa, the orang-utan of Borneo and Sumatra, and, according to the more common classi- fication, the two groups of gibbons of southeastern Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and Hainan. The following are some of the more obvious and salient differences constituting the bodily chasm between the anthropoid apes and man.2 The anthropoid ape's skull may be roughly described as a relatively small brain case attached to a great facial skeleton that projects out in a muzzle or snout,-a small brain case contrasting with large jaws. The human skull may be roughly described as a relatively small facial skeleton, lacking a muzzle, attached to an enormous brain case,-a large brain case contrasting with small jaws. In general proportions between brain case and facial skeleton, modern man and the contemporary anthropoid ape radi- cally contrast one with the other. The cranial capacity of the modern European ranges on the average, depending on the technical method of measurement used, from I300 to 1380 cc. for female adults and from 1450 to I550 cc. for males. In some other human races or sub-races or tribes, these averages may go down to around I200 cc. or even closer to IIOO cc., especially for females. The average cranial capacity of male orang-utans and chimpanzees, with their body weights closer to that of man, is around 400 cc.; that of the gorilla, with a body weight often much greater than that of man, around 500 cc.3 In other words, the human cranial capacity is from two to three times that of the nearest anthropoids. 2 References on physical differences between man and ape are given in bibliography, section 2, at end of present paper 3 R. Martin, Lehrbuch der Anthropologie, 2d ed., 3 vols., Jena, 1928, ii, 745-46. 755; E. A. Hooton, Up from the ape, N. Y., 1932, 40-41 PRIMITIVE MAN 4</page><page sequence="5">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION The modern human forehead is relatively high; the adult anthro- poid forehead is low and sloping. The apes have no true chin, whereas modern man has. In the anthropoids, the canines project appreciably beyond the level of the other teeth and interlock; in modern man they do not. In the anthropoids the dental arch is U-shaped; in modern man its form is more parabolic or horseshoe- shaped. Man stands and walks erect. The orang-utan and chimpanzee are essentially quadrupedal; the gorilla and gibbon slouch as they walk, with knees bent. The chimpanzee can stand and walk more or less erect, but not so well as the gorilla. Man's spine shows four distinctive curves, two concave and two convex. Man's lower limbs are, in proportion to his trunk, very long as compared with the anthropoid's proportionately short posterior limbs. The great toe in man branches from the sole just at the base of the second toe, whereas in the adult ape it branches off at a point more or less removed proximally from the base of the second toe. A comparable differential branching obtains as regards the thumb. In the adult white, the collarbones, when at rest, are almost or quite horizontally posed; those of the anthropoid ape incline at a sharp angle upward and outward. In man the hair is sparse on the body; the ape's body has a thick coating of hair. Here, in the contrasts we have just listed, are certainly marked and obvious differences between man and the ape. A great many other bodily contrasts could be added to the list. But the examples given illustrate sufficiently the main fact that between man and the highest sub-human primates a wide bodily chasm gapes. II. THE EVIDENCE BRIDGING THE CHASM Can this chasm be bridged? The advocates of human bodily evolution hold that it can, at least reasonably well. We shall first present some of the factual data they offer as evidence of such bridging. After that we shall be in position to discuss in how far the data justify or do not justify the inference that an actual evolutionary bridging has taken place. The factual data are drawn from the fields of paleontology, comparative anatomy, and embryology. 5</page><page sequence="6">a. The Evidence from Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy While the average cranial capacity of the male gorilla is around 500 cc., the exceptional individual may run up to well over 600 cc., the largest on record being 655 cc. The exceptional chimpanzee and orang-utan capacity may go close to 500 cc.4 Pithecanthropus erectus stands, as regards cranial capacity, just about midway between the average for the three larger anthropoids and the average for some human sub-races or tribes. Of the Hottentots, 51 per cent, and of the aboriginal Australians, 45 per cent, have cranial capacities under I200 cc.5 Pithecanthropus or Java man had a cranial capacity of about 850 or more probably 900 cc., and if, as Hrdlicka surmises, Java "man " was a " lady ", then the capacity of the male of the Java race must have been around Io00 cc. In Hrdlicka's collection of skeletal material in the United States National Museum, there are no less than 32 skulls of small- statured but normal American Indians with cranial capacities rang- ing from 90o cc. to I,020 cc.6 Individual normal human skulls of equally low capacity have been found among other races,--an Andamanese and a Korumbar of 950 and 970 cc. respectively, a Tyrolese of 900 cc., a Vedda of 960 cc., an Australian of I020 cc., another Andamanese of I025 cc.7 At the other end of the scale, exceptional human skulls, of normal individuals, may and do range sometimes up to about 2,000 cc.8 4 A.

If, an evolutionist may reason, the human range is so wide, from 900 cc. to 2,000 cc., a range within which racial or individual variation can and does play, the relatively shorter gap between the lowest established human capacity, 90o or g9o cc., and the highest established contemporary anthropoid capacity, 655 cc., in the case of the largest recorded gorilla cranial capacity, would seem to be quite within the possibilities of evolutionary bridging. This bridg- ing appears all the more possible or probable in view of the fact that among the anthropoids and man very great variability in cranial capacity obtains. In the gibbons, the cranial capacity may go as low as 80 cc. and as high as I40 cc., the range of 60 cc. repre- senting over 6o per cent of the mean size; in the gorillas, from 370 cc. to 650 or 655 cc., the range of 280 or 285 cc. representing almost 60 per cent of the mean size; in man, from goo or 950 cc. to I,950 or 2,000 cc., the range of I,ooo to I,Ioo cc. representing over 70 per cent of the mean size. Given this great instability in both human and anthropoid cranial capacities, the anthropoid brain may be presumed to be capable of very considerable evolutionary increase.9 Moreover there is at least an even chance, or perhaps more than an even chance, that Pithecanthropus was anthropoid rather than human, although a good deal of more recent opinion, particularly since the discovery of the Peking remains, appears to be veering toward the conclusion that this puzzling being was in some sense human or " humanoid ". If Pithecanthropus was anthropoid, then we have an anthropoid with a cranial capacity equal to occasional human capacities. If Pithecanthropus was a female and an average one, then the cranial capacity of the male of the species would have been well above the cranial capacity of many individual humans. Or again, if the Java remains represent an average in- dividual of the Java race or species, the range of the Java race or species, from analogy with the range of variability in other anthro- poids and in man, would have been from about 710 cc. to about Io60 cc. Finally, McGregor estimates the cranial capacity of 9 Keith, New discoveries, 69-7o 7</page><page sequence="8">Pithecanthropus at 940 cc.; Weinert, at ,o000 cc.'0 These last two estimates, especially the latter of them, have not been uni- versally accepted, but there is a fair chance that either of them may be correct. In slope of forehead the gap between man and the anthropoids is very largely filled in by Pithecanthropus, by Peking man, and by a number of specimens of the Neanderthal race. All of these have foreheads that are very low and retreating, more or less midway between modern man and the anthropoids. The Rhodesian skull, notwithstanding its high cranial capacity and its human teeth, has a forehead slope quite as low as that of some of the anthropoids.11 Modern man has a chin and so contrasts with the anthropoid apes. But the chasm seems filled by a number of early pre- historic lower jaws. The Piltdown and Mauer jawbones lack a chin. Peking man has no chin, or at most only traces of a chin eminence. A considerable number of the mandibles of the Nean- derthal race are either entirely chinless or else show only faint suggestions of a chin eminence or only the beginnings of a chin. One of the recently discovered Wady al-Mughara (Palestinian Neanderthal) lower jaws is also chinless. The Piltdown mandible may perhaps not be human, but all the probabilities are in favor of the others mentioned having been human. But even if these latter were not human, there would still remain the seeming paradox of beings with the dentition of men and the chinlessness of apes.'2 10 Keith, Antiquity of man, ii, 433; New discoveries, 300 11 Cf. also comparative cranial heights: Keith, New discoveries, 283; H.

But in a number of pre- historic mandibles, such as those of the two Ehringsdorff in- dividuals, the Gibraltar child, three of the Krapina, the Chapelle- aux-Saints, Ferrassie number one, Rhodesian, and Talgai, the dental arch is definitely or approximately U-shaped. The Mauer jawbone, with its human teeth, has an arch about midway between that of the anthropoids and that of modern man.l3 Modern man walks erect. There are, however, definite approaches to erect walking in the gibbon, the chimpanzee, and the gorilla,-the last being nearest to man in this respect as also in the corresponding respect of position of the great toe. The Java creature and the Neanderthals may have walked with knees some- what bent, but the point should not be stressed too much, as the evidence is not definitive. b. The Evidence from Embryology A number of the contrasts between man and ape that are not bridged by the evidence from palaeontology and comparative anatomy are in a sense bridged, the evolutionist holds, by the evidence from embryology. Much of Haeckel's work has passed into history and his biogenetic law has suffered considerably at the hands of both evolutionist and anti-evolutionist critics, but this does not mean that the embryological evidence as such has been scrapped or discredited. Schultz' embryological studies of the last decade and a half have brought to light a mass of facts which to the evolutionist appear, if interpreted cautiously, to have con- siderable significance.14 This significance may perhaps be clearer if, before giving the embryological data upon the anthropoids and man, we recall some analogous data from other sections of the zoological field. 13 Hrdlicka, loc. cit., 128, I77, 215-17, 234, 236, 259, 271; Keith, Antiquity of man, i, I93, 331, ii, 451-52 4 The embryological data cited in following pages may all be found in A. H. Schultz, " Embryological evidence of the evolution of man ", Jour. W4ashington Acad. sciences, I925, I5: 247-63. For references to Schultz' longer and more technical publications on same subject see bihliography, section 4, at end of present paper 9</page><page sequence="10">The young of the American robin and bluebird have spotted breasts, whereas the adult birds have not. The American robin and the bluebird belong to the thrush family. All the American thrushes, except the robin and bluebird, have spotted breasts in their adult plumage. No two warblers differ more in adult male plumage than do our Bay-breasted and Black-poll warblers. Even at a distance in the woods they cannot be mistaken one for the other. The former has a strikingly colored chestnut crown and rufous-chestnut throat, upper breast, and sides; the latter is of a dominantly grey color, with a black crown and whitish black-streaked sides. Yet the immature of these two closely related warblers are of almost identical marking and color.15 The toothed whales, constituting the greater proportion of the the whales, have functional teeth. The baleen, whalebone, or toothless whales have not. Yet in the latter as many as forty or more minute teeth may be found hidden in the gum on the maxillary of the fetus. These fetal teeth are soon resorbed and never function as teeth.16 Facts such as these, and there are great numbers of them, become intelligible on an evolutionary assumption, as due in some manner to development from common ancestry. Such evolutionary develop- ment would have left its traces in embryonic and immature stages of the individual's development. These facts are matched, the evolutionist holds, by the comparable ones from primate embry- ology, especially by such facts as Schultz has given us. We shall now review some of them. The adult human being's lower limbs are, as recalled above, very long proportionately to his trunk as compared with the anthro- poid's proportionately short posterior limbs. But the lower limbs of man at birth are proportionately slightly shorter even than those of the orang-utan and chimpanzee at birth. In connection with this fact and its evolutionary interpretation, Schultz calls attention to the parall 1 fact, reasonably explainable as due to evolution, that the posterior limbs of the adult jumping mouse are proportionately 15 F. M. Chapman, Handbook of birds of eastern North America, rev. ed., N. Y., 19I6, 88, 453-54, 498-99 16 R. Kellogg, The history of whales ", Qly rev. biol., I928, 3: I93 PRIMITIVE MAN IO</page><page sequence="11">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION II as lengthened as man's, although in the newborn jumping mouse the posterior limbs are, as in adults of other species of mice, no longer than the anterior ones. Embryology thus helps to bridge over the gap between man and anthropoid as regards lower or posterior limb length. It does the same as regards other physical differences. While adult man's great toe branches from the sole of the foot just at the base of the second toe, thus contrasting with the anthro- poids, in the early stages of individual growth the great toe branches off at the base of the second toe in the other primates as well as in man. Only as growth proceeds does the great toe gradually shift its position proximally in the apes. Much the same early identical branching and later shift toward the wrist occur in the case of the thumb. Incidentally too the thumb which in the adult human being is proportionately to the hand length much longer than in other primates is in the earlier stages of growth of about the same proportionate length in all primates, including man and the anthropoids. The adult human being's collarbones are quite or nearly hori- zontal, whereas those of the anthropoid apes incline at a steep angle. In the human fetus, however, the clavicles incline sharply upward. In hirsuteness of body, man and anthropoid strongly contrast. But there are marked differences in degree of hirsuteness among human races and individuals that often bring man appreciably nearer to the anthropoid in this respect. Then, too, from the sixth to eighth months of fetal life the human embryo is covered with a fine hairy down, the lanugo. Most of this disappears before birth. Among some of the African pygmies this lanugo persists through life.17 These and similar facts seem to the evolutionist to bridge in a manner at least the gaps the creationist stresses. The evolutionist also calls attention to the phenomena known as atavisms. Here are three by way of illustration. In the human embryo there appears a true external tail which reaches far down over the anal level. Later this recedes far above 17 W. Schmidt, Die Stellung der Pygmienvolker in der Entwicklungs- geschichte des Menschen, Stuttgart, 1910, 17</page><page sequence="12">the same level in the adult. In the human embryo the seven to nine vertebral rudiments are, as growth proceeds, gradually reduced to the four or five coccygeal vertebrae in the adult. In the orang, which like the other anthropoids has no external tail in adulthood (contrasting with the monkeys, most of whom have well developed tails), these vertebral rudiments become reduced in the adult to three or sometimes two coccygeal vertebrae. At the tip of the tail in all human embryos is a small caudal fila- ment without vertebral rudiments, the "soft tail ". Occasionally this persist in human adults as an external soft tail, one of record length having been nine inches long. This same caudal filament appears in fetuses of many species of primates, and occasionally persists as an external soft tail in an adult orang-utan or chimpanzee. Many mammals, mostly arboreal species, have a carpal hillock, that is, a small round elevation or hillock on the inner side of the forearm near the wrist, with hairs implanted in it. It is connected with the ulnar nerve and is regarded as an organ of touch. This same hillock is found in adult prosimiae and one of the South American marmosets, in the fetus of at least one Old World monkey, and in a small percentage of human fetuses. In the human fetus the carpal hillock disappears before birth. Apropos of the factual evidence we have just been reviewing, one further point calls for a few words of explanation. The question is sometimes raised as to whether the prehistoric skeletal remains which we have been describing might have been patho- logical. It is possible, if the recent view of one specialist is to be accepted, that the juvenile skull from the Peking collection of remains may be so, in some respects, particularly as to size. But there is no good evidence that the other skeletal material with which we have been dealing is in any true sense pathological. The overwhelming mass of the evidence, in fact, points in the other direction. Some decades ago the Neanderthal skull cap was regarded by some as pathological. The later discovery of many similarly-shaped Neanderthal crania has proven quite clearly that this view was incorrect. Our prehistoric skeletal material, with perhaps insignificant exceptions, is from normal, not pathological, individuals. PRIMITIVE MAN 12</page><page sequence="13">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 13 Before concluding this rather sketchy, but we believe repre- sentative, sampling of most of the chief types of evidence adduced by both creationist and evolutionist, two considerations may be set down, one a generalization upon the facts and the other an immediate rigidly logical inference from them. Both considera- tions have an intimate bearing upon the interpretation of the facts. Broadly speaking, where our geological evidence is clear the farther we go back in time and the older the geological lay of the prehistoric human and human-like skeletal remains, the more anthropoid in significant features do these remains appear. Where the Piltdown remains fit into the chronological series and what they represent is not so clear; where Rhodesian man fits in, still less so. But the general temporal sequence of Pithecanthropus, then Mauer and probably Peking, next Neanderthal, and lastly Cromagnon and other "modern" types seems to rest today on solid ground; and through this major sequence, without making any assumptions as to the genetic relationships of these remains and races to one another, we perceive a gradually increasing divergence from the anthropoid apes and a gradually increasing convergence toward the type of modern man. In the great majority of respects, for instance, in which the Neanderthal race differs from modern man, it resembles the anthropoid type.18 It looked for a while as if Leakey's announced discovery in 1932 of modern-like human types in the East African Middle Pleistocene (the Lower Pleistocene of other classifications) had dealt a death blow to the above generalization, but Boswell's recent field check- up of the geology of the problem seems to have shown Leakev's Middle Pleistocene placement to have been too hasty and to lack geological proof. 9 The inference we referred to above is this: At some time or times in the past, either certain anthropoids were clearly much more man-like in important respects than are any living anthropoid apes today, or else certain human beings or races were clearly more ape-like in important respects than are living human beings or races 18 Keith, Antiquity of man, i, 200-23, esp. 207 19 L. S. B. Leakey, Adam's ancestors, 2d ed., London, I934, 202-21; same, The stone age races of Kenya, London, 1935; P. G. H. Boswell, quoted in full from Nature, 1935, I35: 371, in Anwr. jour. phys. anthrop., 1935, 20: 110-12</page><page sequence="14">today. In other words, at some time or times in the past, human beings and anthropoids resembled each other much more than they do today; human beings and anthropoids had more in common; the chasm between them was much narrower. We have already given the evidence on which this inference is based. Take, for instance, the Mauer jawbone, in which are found in the same specimen the dentition of a human being, the chin- lessness of an ape, and a dental arch about midway in curvature between the typical human and the typical anthropoid; or the Rhodesian skull, in which are found the dentition and skull capacity of a man combined with a low forehead very like an ape's in slope and with brow ridges much like those of the gorilla and orang- utan. And these are only samples chosen more or less at random from an abundance of evidence from which the inference follows with strictly rigid logic, regardless of whether we hold Mauer, Rhodesian, or Pithecanthropus to be anthropoid or human. What the inference itself means is, of course, another question, but it does, the evolutionist would urge, at least help bridge the chasm, and one would find it very hard to pick any flaw in his reasoning up to this point. III. INTERPRETATION OF THE EVIDENCE So much for the factual evidence pro and con. The sampling has had to be sketchy and fragmentary. We have tried however to make it at least representative. We have also tried to set it down as objectively and as dispassionately as possible. The sub- ject is one that calls for light rather than heat. We come now to the interpretation of the evidence. In view of the evidence, is the bodily chasm that, as both sides agree, exists between modern man and the contemporary anthropoid apes a bridgeable one or not, bridgeable in the sense of both man and ape having evolved in body through the operation of natural forces from some distant common ancestry? No scientist of standing holds today that modern man is descended from any of the living apes. The evolutionist holds that man, as regards his body, is not the great- great-grandchild of any living ape, but instead a very distant cousin, not a second or third cousin, but an n-thousandth one.20 20 Keith estimates that about 8,ooo generations account for the dif- ferentiation of modern living black, brown, yellow, and white races from a PRIMITIVE MAN 14</page><page sequence="15">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 15 a. Agreements in Interpretation Before dealing with the points of interpretation upon which evolutionists and creationists differ, it may help clear the ground if we touch upon two important points upon which they are seemingly in substantial agreement. The first is the following. Evolutionists maintain that the theory of human bodily evolution rests on evidence of the same kind and of about equal cogency as the evidence upon which the theory of sub-human evolution in general rests. If, they say, you accept the latter theory, you must in all consistency accept the former too. One of the most strenuous among recent antagonists of human bodily evolution, Dr. Barry O'Toole, has expressed him- self to the same effect and perhaps even more forcefully. He " cannot fathom the mentality " of those who accept evolution in plant and sub-human animal organisms and stop short of accepting human bodily evolution. If " structures so strikingly similar as the skeletons of a man and an ape" are not to be interpreted as having originated from a common ancestral stock, there can be no consistent ground for inferring common evolutionary descent from structural resemblances in plants and sub-human animals.21 Probably no one, whether sympathetic or unsympathetic to human bodily evolution, who has even a distant acquaintance with the factual evidence pro and con will quarrel with this view. Judged solely on the scientific evidence we have today, human bodily evolution and sub-human evolution stand or fall together. On the second point of interpretation, agreement on both sides would be widespread, if not universal. Professor Arthur Thomson, writing of organic evolution in general some years ago, stated: '... none of the so-called evidence is in itself demonstrative in common ancestral stock (Antiquity of man, ii, 716). On this estimate the white man is 8,oooth cousin to the Negro. Gregory estimates that about 800,ooo generations intervened between the time that interbreeding between proto-human and anthropoid stocks stopped and the time that Piltdown man lived ("How near is the relationship of man to the chimpanzee-gorilla stock?", Qly rev. biol., 1927, 2: 560). Piltdown man would thus be 8oo,oooth cousin to the great apes, and modern man a still more distant cousin 21 G. B. O'Toole, The case against evolution, N. Y., 1926, 268-69; cf. B. C. A. Windle, The evolutionary problem as it is today, N. Y., 1927, 60</page><page sequence="16">the strict sense. All that is shown is that the formula fits a wide and representative series of facts, and enables us to think of them in a clear and rapid way ".22 As regards the facts bearing upon human bodily evolution, the evolutionary formula appears quite clearly to do at least this much. b. The Parting of the Ways It is, however, one thing for a formula to fit the facts; quite another for the facts to demonstrate the truth of the formula. The real question is: Is this the only formula that fits the facts? And this brings us to the parting of the ways between creationist and evolutionist. We shall have time and space to discuss in detail just one or two typical bits of the evidence presented in previous pages. The spotted breast of the immature robin and bluebird do not, as should be obvious, strictly demonstrate thrush descent, nor do the fetal teeth of the baleen whales demonstrate with rigid logic evolutionary descent of the toothless whales from a whale or whale-like ancestry with functioning teeth. But these facts viewed in the light of the numerous, specific, detailed other resemblances between robin, bluebird and the thrushes, or between toothless and toothed whales, certainly seem to suggest evolutionary descent. Things that resemble each other are not necessarily related gen- etically, but where the resemblances are so numerous, so specific, so striking, and so complex, it is very hard to avoid concluding to genetic relationship, especially as we have abundant evidence,- within even the circle of the human race itself,-that evolutionary changes do occur up to a certain degree. In fact, it is upon just such numerous, specific, and complex resemblances that the scientific case for the unity of the human race itself chiefly rests. The evidence for human unity drawn from the facts of interfertility is of secondary and corroborative moment only. Those who on grounds of strict logic challenge the major proposition that resemblances of this special kind justify the inference of common evolutionary origin have relatively little scientific evidence left for holding the common unitary origin of the contemporary human sub-races. The chief and by far the 22 J. A. Thomson, Darwinism and human life, N. Y., I909, 26 I6 PRIMIITIVE MAN</page><page sequence="17">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 17 most important scientific evidence for human racial unity is that of the numerous, specific and complex resemblances (in spite of certain recognized differences) which exist between all living human peoples. The phenomena of spotted breasts in immature robins and of non-functional teeth in baleen whale fetuses, viewed in connection with the numerous, detailed and complex resemblances between robins and other thrushes and between whalebone whales and toothed whales, become in a measure understandable as survivals if we assume an evolutionary explanation. Otherwise they and the resemblances stand as baffling clusters and swarms of un- explained coincidences. The fact that we know definitely that evolution occurs to a certain degree (as, for instance, the evolu- tion through natural forces of the several sub-divisions of the white race from a common stock) should incline one all the more to accept an evolutionary explanation of such phenomena as we are discussing. And if the evolutionary explanation seems accept- able for phenomena in the sub-human field, it should be acceptable on a pari grounds, the evolutionist reasons, in the human field or in the general primate field including man. What has been said of the thrushes and whales may, mutatis mutandis, be said of such phenomena as the elongated posterior limbs of the jumping mouse, which so contrast with its short limbs at birth and with the short posterior limbs in adulthood of other species of mice. And the same inference should on a pari grounds be drawn, the evolutionist holds, for the elongated human lower limbs, contrasting with human beings' short limbs at birth and with the short posterior limbs in adulthood of other species of primates, particularly of the great anthropoid apes. The same a pari reasoning would hold, he maintains, as regards the caudal fila- ment and the other embryological phenomena we have brought up. The conclusion does not follow with rigid necessity from the premises. On grounds of formal logic flaws can be picked in the reasoning. The reasoning however cannot be called illogical. It is reasoning upon accumulative, complicated, and convergent evidence. The evidence is convergent, that is, it is drawn from independent sources, -paleontology, comparative anatomy, and embryology. It is accumulative or at least complicated. The lock</page><page sequence="18">i8 PRIMITIVE MAN is, so to speak, a very complex one. The evolutionary key seems to fit it, so the evolutionist holds, and to fit it very well. The creationist, rejecting the evolutionary key, offers another in its stead. The facts, he holds, while admittedly complex in their resemblances and drawn from convergent independent sources, can be explained by assuming that all life is organized on a single divine plan, and hence uniformity underlying specific and generic differences is just about what we should expect. Most or many of the facts insisted upon by the evolutionist he would explain as due to convergence or parallelism, to lacunae in our evidence, to "chance " coincidences, and to other causes. Convergence certainly occurs, convergence that may or may not have genetic significance, and occurs rather frequently in the view of many scientists.23 Much too is lacking in our knowledge. No one for a moment questions all this. But, even so, can an evo- lutionary explanation of the facts be discarded? Or, in other words, which of the two keys better fits the complicated lock? There is and can be no question, on either side, of inexorable logic, of conclusive demonstration. In the broader and more complicated problems of any science we do not ordinarily look for or expect conclusive demonstration. The question is one of dis- passionate, balanced weighing of alternative probabilities. The very nature of the objective evidence makes possible the drawing of conclusions that, falling short of demonstration proper, must have only a greater or lesser degree of probability. As regards the problem of evolution in general, and especially of human bodily evolution, two very significant subjective factors tend to sheer inference, judgment and evaluation to the right or to the left. The first subjective element is that of initial bias either toward and away from the theory. The bias may be emotional. We have always known that we are part animal anyhow, but many react emotionally against the idea of being descended in our animal nature from animals. The bias may be of another order. The man who denies the existence of a personal God or who believes, 23 Cf., e. g., W. E. LeG. Clark, Early forerunners of man, Baltimore, I934, 6-8, 286-88, and passim; T. Dwight, Thoughts of a Catholic anatomist, N. Y., 1911, ch. ix-x; Keith, Antiquity of man, ii, 725-28; same, New discoveries, 28 I8 PRIMITIVE MAN</page><page sequence="19">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 19 not as a matter of science but necessarily as a matter of his philosophy, that there is and can be no such thing as divine interposition in the affairs of the universe around us, approaches the problem of human bodily evolution, as he approaches the problem of the origin of life, of consciousness, and of rational thought, with an initial bias in favor of the evolutionary explana- tion. The man of strong fundamentalist leanings who hence in- clines to give a strictly literal interpretation to the "dust" from which man was made, considering that this must have been in- organic "dust" and could not have been organic "dust" approaches the problem of human bodily evolution with an initial bias against an evolutionary explanation. The Catholic scientist, we may add parenthetically, who knows his religion need and should have bias in neither direction. The second subjective element is that of scientific temperament, if we may call it such. Some minds are more cautious; other minds, more incautious. Some leap far and fast. Other feel their way and tread slowly. Any impartial objectively-minded scientist, however sympathetic he be to human bodily evolution, will readily admit that the evidence bearing upon the question is complex, often falling short of the desired degree of clarity, often patient of alternative explanations. In view of the nature of the objective evidence itself and in view of the disturbing influence of the two subjective factors we have mentioned, there is little wonder that different people draw such widely differing inferences from the same evidence, and that the degree of probability or improbability ascribed to the theory of human bodily evolution differs so much from group to group, from man to man, and even at times from year to year in the same student. From out of the welter and turmoil, however, certain things are clear. It appears that human bodily evolution is not strictly demon- strated by the evidence. It is equally clear that from the scientific evidence it cannot be demonstrated that bodily evolution did not occur. It is also clear that the theory is something more than a guess, something more than pure speculation, something not bereft of all probability. Nor does there appear to any scientific evidence cogently making for the strong improbability of the theory. It is</page><page sequence="20">finally clear that, unless and until we get much more decisive evidence pointing one way or another, we are unlikely to get any- thing like unanimity among students upon the degree of prob- ability,-low, medium, high, or very high--which should be assigned to the theory. So far as the Catholic student or scientist is concerned, the drawing of final conclusions upon the strength or weakness of the evidence can perhaps be facilitated a little by borrowing a principle from Catholic philosophy. The principle referred to is: Primary divine causation should not be invoked to explain a phenomenon if the phenomenon in question can be brought about through natural secondary causation. If, in the light of the scientific evidence, you should conclude that human bodily evolution does not appear possible, there the matter would end for your own inferring. If however it appears possible, even though the actual fact has not been proven, the philosophic principle would come into play. Two minor aspects of the problem or of the evidence bearing thereupon may be touched upon in conclusion, before we pass to the question of human mental evolution. First, attention is often called to the fact that the skeletal remains of prehistoric man are relatively meager,-too meager, some critics consider, for drawing confident conclusions. That they are meager is true. But they are far from being as meager as is often supposed. Pithecanthropus, Heidelberg or Mauer, Piltdown, and Rhodesian remains do stand alone, in the sense of representing practically single specimens, and even here not whole skeletons. But Neanderthal and Neanderthaloid types are repre- sented today by remains from over sixty individuals, or if we in- clude the Peking remains among the Neanderthalers, from over eighty.24 The number and variety have been growing apace since the discovery of the Gibraltar and Neanderthal specimens in 1848 and I856 respectively. They hark moreover from areas as widely apart as eastern China and the East Indies, South Africa, the Mediterranean district, and the British Isles. The remains are not so plentiful as science would wish. But science is never satis- 24 Hrdlicka, loc. cit., I45-47; S. Richarz, " Our present knowledge of early man". Eccles. rev., 1933, 88: 489; Anthropologie, I935, 45: 706-7 PRIMITIVE MAN 20</page><page sequence="21">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 21 fled, when there is question of facts and factual evidence. At any rate, the facts which science has in the way of skeletal remains are very definite and significant facts, and, with apologies for the almost unavoidable pun, very hard ones, being fossilized. Evidence is weighed, not like cattle on the hoof by the pull of gravity, but in other scales; it is evaluated, not like building sand by the space it occupies, but by less gross criteria of value. And, it may be added, by no means all of the evidence bearing on human bodily evolution is drawn from our relatively meager prehistoric skeletal remains. It is largely drawn from the abundant material furnished by comparative anatomy and embryology. Secondly, the point is sometimes raised that since we have so little knowledge of the factors that could have brought about human bodily evolution and such a lack of definite clues as to the missing links in the chain, we should not speak of the theory itself. The point has not, however, validity. We have very little knowl- edge, for instance, of the intermediate missing links between Proto- Algonquian and its forerunners, or between Proto-Algonquian and the numerous languages of the great modern Algonquian linguistic stock, nor have we even this little knowledge of the factors that have brought about such linguistic evolution. Yet the fact of Algonquian linguistic evolution is demonstrably clear. Again, within the human race there has certainly been bodily evolution; else we should have to ascribe such sub-races as the Caucasoid, the Mongoloid, and the Negroid to three distinct origins, whether by separate creation or by independent evolution from distinct sub- human stocks. For we know practically nothing about the missing links that connect up the three sub-races with the earliest human stock, or about the factors that have led by natural evolutionary processes to such physical racial differentiation as exists todav. In other words, the implied major in the reasoning advanced, if it were valid, would constitute a deadly ad hominem to fling at any- one accepting as true the unity of the human race. Enough, and perhaps too much, on the badly threadbare topic of human bodily evolution. We turn now to the problem of human mental evolution, a topic that for some reason or other has been given rather stepmotherly treatment by science. It has not been attacked head-on and with a real attempt at thoroughness since the</page><page sequence="22">days of the famous controversy between Romanes and Mivart a half-century ago.25 On human bodily evolution we have whole libraries; on human mental evolution as such, hardly a five-foot shelf, altlhough a great amount of empirical evidence bearing there- upon is found scattered in ethnological, anthropological, psycho- logical, and philosophical sources. We may merely repeat in passing what we have previously emphasized, namely, that there is no question here of the evolution of the human soul as such. Science does not discuss the origin and evolution of the human soul. The question does not come within the competence of empirical science. It belongs to the fields of philosophy and theology. In the following pages we shall be concerned only with the problem of the evolution of human rational or conceptual thought, and with this problem purely from the standpoint of the empirical evidence. B. THE HUMAN MIND Most scientists who touch upon the question at all appear to take for granted that the human mind, including the power of con- ceptual or rational thought, is the result of an evolution from sub- human intelligence. Probably the overwhelming majority do. But again, as in the matter of bodily evolution, drawing conclusions by counting noses is not an approved scientific procedure. The only question to be considered seriously is: What are the established facts and what clear inferences may be drawn from them ? The evidence bearing upon the problem is drawn chiefly from three disciplines: cultural and linguistic anthropology, comparative psychology, and human psychology. All the studies of the total problem of human mental evolution that the present writer has seen scamp much or most of the pertinent factual evidence, and many of these studies fumble with the evidence they do discuss. Most writers who make passing reference to the problem, while at home perhaps in the biological sciences, seem to have only a distant acquaintance with the pertinent experimental and other data from all these three disciplines. The present attempt to put the evidence together, in at least its main lines and with use of the newer factual data, must of necessity be a very tentative one. 25 G. J. Romanes, Mental evolution in man, N. Y., I889; St. G. Mivart, The origin of humana reason, London, I889 PRIMITIVE MAN 22</page><page sequence="23">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 23 I. EVIDENCE OF MINOR MOMENT Our chief attention will be given to the major pertinent lines of evidence from the three sciences above mentioned. Before, how- ever, tackling the main evidence, it may help to clear up the situ- ation a little if we get out of the way some of the marginal or collateral evidence, most of it, the writer believes, of no particular validity in favor of or against the theory of human mental evolu- tion. We shall deal with this collateral evidence very briefly. a. Against Htuman Mental Evolution Three contentions sometimes advanced by the opponents of human mental evolution are: first, sub-human animals do not make progress; secondly, they do not use or at least make tools; thirdly, the whole problem is one for philosophy, not for empirical science, to decide. Against the first contention, it can be said, from the standpoint of the facts, that sub-human animals do in a certain sense make progress and that certain human groups may and do remain relatively stagnant over enormous periods of time, and, from the standpoint of logic, that the reasoning does not appear very cogent. Individual brute animals certainly make progressive adaptations in the course of their lives. Species make the same; for instance, the bobolink has in recent decades changed its migra- tion route. The European starling, since its introduction into the United States in I89o, has, much to our disgust, blazed for itself new migration trails. Two of our American swallows, the Barn Swallow and the Cliff Swallow, have largely changed their nesting site from caves and cliffs to barns, and this in quite recent decades, and another, the Tree Swallow, is making a somewhat similar change at present.26 Within the dog family there has obviously been progress of a kind, the progressive development of mental traits, such as pointing, as among the pointers, or skill at fishing, as among some spaniels. Taking into account the whole broad sweep of the sub-human animal world and assuming even very limited evolution therein, we find evidence on all sides of adaptive acquisi- tion that can legitimately be called progressive. On the other hand, human groups can and sometimes do remain relatively stagnant 26 Chapman, loc. cit., 418</page><page sequence="24">over enormous periods of time, as is evidenced, for example, among the living lower marginal peoples by ethnology and among the early paleolithic peoples by prehistoric archeology. Progress and humanity are by no means synonymous. From the standpoint of logic, just how shall we formulate the implied major in the contention with which we are here dealing. Should it be: Beings that make progress are of a mentality essentially differing in kind from the mentality of beings that do not? Or what should it be? And in any case on what factual evidence shall we be able to establish the validity of this implied major, and how shall we explain away the evidence that is in seeming conflict with it ? And what, after all, do we mean by progress'? Against the second contention, it can be said that animals do use implements to attain their ends.27 To give just one illustra- tion, Kohler's chimpanzee, Sultan, after fitting one length of bamboo into another, used the longer stick to draw food to him. And after all, is there really any psychological difference between tool-making as such,-that is, apart from the rational purpose in much human tool-making,-and the building of a beaver dam or the weaving of the oriole's intricate and ingenious hanging nest? Or does the ability to use or make tools necessarily presuppose a type of mentality essentially different from and superior to, in kind as well as in degree, types of mentality lacking such ability? Against the third contention, it can be said that human mental evolution is a problem in which philosophy has, it is true, an im- portant role when the final verdict is to be reached; but the problem is very largely one for empirical science, just as the problem of vitalism and mechanism is. There is no philosophical short-cut to the solution of either problem, no simple combination of obvious major and minor that will produce an inevitable ergo. The philo- sophic inference in the case must be drawn from a host of empirical facts and only after the most minute analysis of these facts. The crux of the problem, or of both problems of mental evolution and of vitalism, is, as all who approach these problems technically know well: Are the differences between human and 27 Cf., e. g., W. Kohler, The tmetality of apes, tr., N. Y., 1925, ch. ii-v, 25-178; V. T. Heron, " Complex learning processes " in F. A. Moss, Com- parative psychology, N. Y., I934, 344-45 PRIMITIVE MAN 24</page><page sequence="25">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 25 sub-human mentality, as the differences between living and non- living things, of such a nature that the one could not possibly have developed out of the other? There is no ready-made formula for answering these questions. An answer can be given only in the light of all the available observational and experimental facts, and of a close analysis and cautious interpretation of these facts. And even after all this sweating job is gone through, the answer has to be one resting on the summation of probabilities, unless other light be thrown on the question than is thrown by science and philosophy. b. For Human Mental Evolution Three contentions rather commonly advanced by advocates of human mental evolution are drawn from the fields of comparative anatomy, racial psychology and child psychology respectively. The first contention is taken from comparative anatomy. As we go up the biological scale, there appears a progressive development of the central nervous system, particularly in the size and structure of the brain. This progressive physical evolution is more or less paralleled by a growth in brain power or intelligence, with the primates ranking highest next to man on both physical and mental scores. This parallel development suggests that, as the physical development has been the product of evolution, the mental develop- ment must have been likewise a product of evolution. Certainly there seems to be a suggestive talking point here, but it is hardly more than that. For, in the first place, while we do know something of the exact nature of the dependence of mental functions upon brain structure and size, there is so much that is at present hopelessly obscure. The obscurity is particularly marked as regards the relationship of the higher mental activities to and their dependence upon the brain, and this is the crux of the problem. Secondly, the parallel progression is fully consistent with the hypothesis which is put forward by the theist who accepts bodily evolution and denies human mental evolution. Under this hypothesis God would have left to the operation of purely natural evolutionary forces the physical development of a nervous system and brain up through the biological scale until such brain develop- ment in some higher sub-human primate would have been sufficiently advanced to have functioned as the physical correlate of rational thought. To sum up: first, the implication of the facts</page><page sequence="26">is at best very uncertain; secondly, the facts, such as they are, fit in equally well with a non-evolutionary hypothesis. The second contention is taken from racial psychology. Races, it is alleged, differ in levels of intelligence,--some contemporary races being much nearer to the apes in mentality, and some of the prehistoric races being the same. Thus the gap between modern civilized peoples and the anthropoid apes is partly bridged. All we can say is that in the present state of our evidence there is no shred of scientific proof of racial superiority or inferiority that can stand ten minutes' close analysis and criticism and still have any cogency left in it. We just do not know anything definite about comparative average racial intelligence.28 We know still less about the higher mental powers of prehistoric man as com- pared with those of modern man. Early man's culture was un- doubtedly very simple as is the culture of many living preliterate peoples, but culture level is no reliable index to the intelligence level of the people who share the culture. A third contention relies upon the data of child psychology. The human being during the transition from earliest infancy to maturity grows or evolves from a pre-rational level of mental activity to a rational one, and this by almost imperceptible gradations, without any sign anywhere of a sharp break. So too must human men- talitv have evolved by slow gradual stages from pre-rational mentality.29 This comes close to begging the question. We know that the human infant has the potentiality of rational thought. That, due seemingly to insufficient brain development, this potentiality is not 2S Cf., e. g., O. Klineberg, Race differences, N. Y., 1935; T. R. Garth, Race psychology, N. Y., I93I; B. Blackwood, A study of mental testing in relation to anthropology, Mental measurement monographs, serial no. 4, Baltimore, 1927; J. M. Cooper, "Racial mentality", Primitive man, 1929, 2: 3-16, with bibl. I6-I8 29 The point was stressed by Romanes, loc. cit., ch. xi, and answered by Mivart, loc. cit., ch. v. Comparative studies and testing of infants or chil- dren and anthropoids,-as represented, e. g., by Wr. N. and L. A. Kellogg, The ape alnd the child, N. Y., 1933, or by A. Alpert, The solving of problem- situations by preschool children, Teachers coll., Col. univ., Contrib. to educ., N. Y., I928,-while very interesting and illuminating in themselves, do not, for the reasons given in the following paragraph, throw light upon the problem of human mental evolution 26 PRIMITIVE MAN</page><page sequence="27">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 27 actualized in earliest infancy is no more an argument for mental evolution than would be one taken from the phenomena of drunken coma or anesthesia. The very point at issue is: Has the sub- human primate this same potentiality of rational thought, in the sense that such mental powers as he possesses can evolve through purely natural forces into rational thought? If he has, as we know is the case with the young infant, then of course the whole issue is settled. But, has he? Or are the mental powers he has of an essentially different and lower psychic order? To answer this question, we cannot appeal to any simple fact in children's mental growth. We have to appeal to other and more significant evidence, that provided by anthropology, comparative psychology, and human psychology, and it is this evidence, the major evidence bearing on our problem, to which we now turn. II. EVIDENCE OF MAJOR MOMENT a. The Evidence from Cultural Anthropology and Primitive Linguistics Cultural and linguistic anthropology's contribution to the solu- tion of the problem, while very important, can be very briefly and simply stated. All living peoples, however lowly and rude their culture, have fully developed powers of conceptual and rational thought. The evidence for the statement jumps at us from every ethnological fence corner. In addition, all living peoples have true languages, languages built up in orderly and logical fashion, being on the average just as orderly and logical as our own Indo- European tongues and just as capable of expressing abstract ideas. For this statement, too, the evidence is overwhelming.30 The two major statements just made are, the writer feels can be said without hesitation, demonstrated in the strict sense of this term by the evidence we have. He further believes that no com- petent living ethnologist or student of primitive linguistics would take exception to either statement. Levy-Bruhl, with his theory 30 Cf. summaries and discussions of the evidence in, e. g., A. L. Kroeber, Anthropology, N. Y., rev. ed., 1933, ch. iv-v; F. Boas, The mind of primitive man, N. Y., 1922 (19II); E. Sapir, "The history 'and varieties of human speech", Smithson. inst., Annual rpt for I912, Washington, 1913, 573-95. Cf. also references under footnote no. 28</page><page sequence="28">of pre-logical and mystical primitive mentality, might take excep- tion. But he is not a competent student in either ethnology or primitive linguistics; he has had no personal contact with living primitive peoples; his works written to establish his pet thesis are honeycombed with errors of fact, let alone errors of inference, errors that are demonstrably such. b. The Evidence from Comparative Psychology The evidence from comparative psychology and human psy- chology is, unfortunately for the patient reader, not so simply and briefly summarized. Let us begin with comparative psychology, the study of the mentality of sub-human animals. Comparative psychology has its historic roots in very early primitive culture. The simplest marginal nomad peoples living today know much of animal ways and mentality. As a science, however, comparatively psychology emerged with Darwin and his followers and opponents. Since its birth, its history may be divided into two periods, the anecdotal period, culminating, and in a sense crashing with the work of Romanes in the eighties of the last century, and the experimental period beginning with the studies of Lubbock, Verworn, Loeb and especially Lloyd Morgan in the eighties and nineties, and continuing uninterruptedly since then. The experimental work has progressed particularly, although by no means exclusively, in the United States.31 The anecdotal movement and method have now passed into history and need not detain us long. The method has many weaknesses. The observer is apt to be untrained and to read into what he observes many things that may or may not be there. He may see the clever trick without knowing how it was learned. IIe tends to confine attention to highly selected behavior. Often he cannot easily check up the truth of the ancedotes he relies upon. He is liable to interpret behavior in the light of previous bias re- specting the stupidity or intelligence of animals. As a result partly of faulty method, partly of polemical bias, the anecdotal school tended to interpret animal behavior anthropomorphically, the animal being given credit for mental processes, intelligence and reasoning powers quite like man's. 31 References on history of comparative psychology movement at end of present paper in bibliography, section 6, a 28 PRIMITIVE MAN</page><page sequence="29">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 29 The experimental movement may, so far as our present problem is concerned, be divided into two overlapping periods or sub-move- ments, characterized by the methods used and by the conclusions arrived at. The one, exemplified by much of the work, for instance, of Thorndike, has made use in the main of such methods as the maze and problem box. In general the animal learns, only after a greater or lesser number of more or less random trials, to reach the objective. Unsuccessful movements are gradually eliminated; the successful one is gradually reinforced. Learning is a slow gradual broken hit-or-miss process, one of trial-and-error, marked by varying degrees of intelligence or stupidity. Such methods have been criticized by men like K6hler as being so to speak, unfair to the animal, as not giving the animal a chance to react to the whole situation. Thus, they would say, the trial- and-error process of learning was the only possible one in such types of experimentation. Kohler, therefore, and others who think with him have used what he calls the " roundabout " method or procedure, in which the animal is given a chance to survey the whole situation, and to react to or solve it as a whole. The pro- cedure will be clearer from the examples we shall give infra. The maze and problem-box techniques emphasize trial-and-error learning. The roundabout techniques emphasize learning by in- sight. Instead of the slow random solutions of problems under the former procedures, there appear evidences of a more abrupt sudden solving that K6hler considers to be proof of what he calls insight. Broadly speaking, the anecdotal school undoubtedly tended to rate the sub-human animal too high in the scale of intelligence; the trial-and-error school, it would seem, tended to rate the animal too low; the roundabout school, with its emphasis on insight, holds more of a middle position. (i) The Experimental Facts Let us look a little more closely at some typical observational and experimental facts assumed to involve insight. We shall take our examples from some of the more significant of Kohler's data on his chimpanzees studied, chiefly during the first six months of I914, at the Anthropoid Station at Teneriffe in the Canary</page><page sequence="30">Islands.32 We may add in passing that the more important studies with use of the roundabout procedure have been made on the anthropoid apes, although a certain amount of experimental work of the kind has been carried out on monkeys and other mammals. Kohler's experiments were with chimpanzees exclusively, the apes that with the gorillas are ranked by Yerkes as probably closest in cognitive resemblance to man. We shall give just four of the experiments and their results, these four constituting four among the most marked evidences of insight. In the background of the experiment room was placed a bush whose branches could be easily broken off. Beyond some bars, out of arm reach, lay the objective, food. Sultan, one of the chimpanzees, was let in to the experiment room. At first he did not notice the objective. But when his attention was drawn to it, he approached the bars, glanced outside, and the next moment turned around, went straight for the bush, broke off a branch, ran back to the bars, and with the branch drew the objective to him. As K6hler remarks, such a solution of the problem may seem self-evident to us with our mechanized habits and back- ground, but for the chimpanzee it was an achievement. As a matter of fact, Grande, another of the chimpanzees, was submitted to the identical test the same day, but, although she already under- stood the use of sticks to reach objects out of arm reach and although when she was admitted to the experiment room she reached out with her arm to try to get the objective and then squatted close to the bush and chewed its branches, she did not break off a branch as Sultan had done. After a long wait, with no solution by Grande of the problem of attaining the objective, the test was abandoned. Four months later, on repetition of the same experiment with Grande, she broke off a branch and used it as Sultan had done. The objective was hung high, far out of standing or jumping reach. About four meters distant from the objective and not very far from each other were placed two boxes. All other means 32 W. K6hler, loc. cit., I07-IO, 139-44, 71-74, I30-35, on experiments and observations described in following pages of present paper. For references to other experimental data along same line, see bibliography at end of present paper, section, 6, b PRIMITIVE MAN 30</page><page sequence="31">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 31 of reaching the objective were removed. Sultan dragged the larger of the two boxes to a spot just underneath the objective, got up on the box, looked upward but did not jump. He then got down, seized the other box and pulled it behind him around the room. He did not seize the second box to put it on the first, but merely to give vent to his temper. All of a sudden he stopped, pulled the second box right up to the first, and stood the second on the first, and then mounted the shaky construction. At another test about a month later, he stacked three boxes to reach the objective. Another of the chimpanzees, Grande, learned to stack four. Naturally, as Kohler remarks, there is no question of in- stinct here, as there would be in the construction of a web by a spider. The chimpanzees solved the problem, solved it as a whole, and solved it more or less suddenly, not by the fumbling trial-and- error process. Without waxing poetic over this feat, we are vaguely reminded of Keats' lines in his Eve of St. Agnes: Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart Made purple riot: then doth he propose A stratagem .... Sultan, and later Rana, another of the chimpanzees, learned to jump with a pole or long plank. They would put a long pole or board upright or nearly so on the ground, clamber up it rapidly, then fall with it or swing themselves off it as it fell. At first this was just play, it seems. Some time after this play trick was discovered, an objective (fruit) was hung up out of leaping reach. Sultan jumped from the ground several times to grab the fruit, but without success. Then he seized a pole, stuck it in the ground and clambered up it, but without attaining the fruit. On the repetition of the test eleven days later, using a plank instead of the pole, he clambered up three times unsuccessfully, and on the fourth trial succeeded in tearing down the fruit. Afterwards four other of the chimpanzees learned the same trick. A final example, from the experimental career of Sultan. He was already quite expert in using a stick to draw something to him that was out of arm reach. In the following test, two bamboo rods, one smaller than the other and capable of being fitted into</page><page sequence="32">the other, were put in the room with Sultan. Beyond the bars, just far enough away to be out of reach of either one of the rods, was placed the objective, fruit. For over an hour, Sultan's various attempts with single rods and other means failed to secure the objective for him. Then he squatted indifferently on a box in the room. Next he got up, picked up the two sticks and played care- lessly with them. While doing this he happened to push the thinner rod into the opening at the end of the thicker one, and at once jumped up, ran to the bars, and began drawing the banana toward him with the double rod. A few days later he succeeded in fitting three rods together and used this triple rod to draw the objective to him. In experiments such as the foregoing four, there is no question of a long learning process through trial and error, the process familiar in maze and problem-box experiments, in which only after a greater or lesser number of unsuccessful attempts is the success- ful association established. Instead, there is a sudden solution of the difficulty, a sudden hurdling, so to speak, of the obstacle. To the mental process represented in this type of problem solving K6hler has given the name of " insight ". (2) Discussion of the Facts The experiment facts are clear enough. The term itself seems to be well enough chosen. But here the real problem begins. What precisely does such "insight" mean and signify? What does insight signify as compared with rational reasoning and thought? Kohler is rather positive: " The chimpanzees manifest intelligent behavior of the general kind familiar in human beings ". Yerkes, if I interpret the two men correctly, is more cautious: "Behavior which the psychobiologist describes in terms of constructive imagi- nation undoubtedly is intimately related to, and perhaps in a measure identical with, that which involves processes of abstrac- tion, generalization, and practical judgment ". He inserts a double qualification, "perhaps " and "in a measure ". Elsewhere, with similar reserve and caution, Yerkes expresses his view that experi- ments with the three great apes are "indicative of an order of intelligence which certainly suggests the human, if it does not PRIMITIVE MAN 32</page><page sequence="33">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 33 closely approach it".33 " Constructive imagination" or "idea- tional behavior " appears in Yerkes' usage to be about equivalent to "insight" as used by K6hler and others. Does this constitute " reasoning" ? If from the definitions of reasoning,-almost as numerous and differing as those of that other R, religion,-we select, for instance, Maier's, it pretty clearly does. "The term reasoning implies ", in Maier's use of it, "that something new has been brought about, and that in some way, past experiences have been manipulated. It therefore seems that behavior patterns made up of two isolated experiences characterize what is meant by behavior which is the product of reasoning". This is however one of the minimum definitions or descriptions. At the other end of the definitional scale we have Dunn's summary statement in her experimental study of legal and geometrical reasoning in human beings: "The formal essential character of reasoning may be regarded as the insight into the necessary truth of the conclusion as dependent on the premises. This insight is an intellectual non-sensory experience ".34 Does the insight shown by anthropoid apes, K6hler's chimpanzees, fall within this latter description of "reasoning" ? Is it legitimate to infer from the observed behavior that it is the result of a type of insight which is insight into " the necessary truth of the conclusion as dependent on the premises " ? On the experimental data alone, the question is more easily asked than answered, as regards the animal mental processes. Where we are dealing with the human mind, we can, with due respect to the differing opinion of the extreme left-wing behaviorists, count scientifically on introspection to help us out. Where we are dealing with the animal mind, no matter how carefully devised and con- trolled our experiments may be, we cannot count on such aid. We can observe what the animal does. But what is going on in its mind at the same time is a matter of inference, at least or 33 K6hler, loc. cit., 275; R. M. and A. W. Yerkes, The great apes, New Haven, 1929, 372; R. M. Yerkes, Almost human, N. Y., 1925, 86. Quoted by permission of Harcourt, Brace and Company, Yale University Press, and D. Appleton-Century Company, respectively 34 N. R. F.

Dunn, The psychology of reasoning, an experimental study, repr. from Studies in psychol. and psychiatry, I926, I: 33</page><page sequence="34">especially in the experiments that are adapted to test higher cognitive processes. Assuming, however, in spite of these difficulties, that the experi- mental data on anthropoid mentality justify the inference that the ape's behavior often manifests insight, the further and really crucial question still remains unanswered: Is this insight or "reasoning" imaginal, perceptual, or is it rational, conceptual? Between the two types of insight there is a world of difference. A couple of illustrations may help to clarify the difference. Illustrations are chosen in which the element of suddenness of solution occurs, although neither type of insight need necessarily and always show marked suddenness of solution, and although, too, it may be added, suddenness of solution is not necessarily an evidence of conceptual, rather than perceptual or imaginal, insight. One steaming hot day last summer, during summer school in Washington, I was working in my office with my coat and collar off. When rushing to get attired, just about three minutes before I was due to begin a lecture in a neighboring building, I found myself sans collar button. Here was an obstacle to hurdle, a problem to solve, and a problem with which I do not recall ever having been faced before. For a good quarter of a minute I was in a quandary, completely non-plussed. Suddenly, like Sultan with his two boxes, I " reacted to the situation as a whole ". A paper clip was called into service, the collar was attached therewith, and the lecture began on time. Was this reasoning? In Maier's sense, yes. In Dunn's sense, I do not think so. There were no premises, no conceptual thought, no "necessary" conclusion. There was insight, constructive imagination, ideational behavior, in Kohler's and Yerkes' sense of the terms. But hardly more,-no such conceptual and rational elements as would necessarily be called into play were I to attempt to give an ethically valid answer to such a question as, " Is lying to save a friend serious embarass- ment in accordance with the demands of altruistic ethics? ", or an economically and politically valid answer to the question, " In how far should our United States federal government be entrusted with authority to regulate intra-state as well as interstate commerce?" While mulling several years ago over the widespread pauperism that has overtaken the northern Canadian trapping Indians in PRIMITIVE MAN 34</page><page sequence="35">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 35 recent decades, suddenly the broad facts and the seeming solution ranged themselves in order in my mind: the pauperism is immedi- ately traceable to the paucity of game and fur animals, this paucity in turn to the considerable breakdown of the traditional native conservation systems, this breakdown to the corresponding break- down of the system of individual rights of land exploitation, and consequently, in order to cure the pauperism, some kind of return to the original system of individual exploitation is called for. I am not discussing here the validity of the above reasoning, but offering it merely as an example of a type of reasoning or in- sight,-valid or invalid,-that clearly involves the use of concepts proper, the use of which was not called for at all in the collar- button incident. The reasoning happened to show a certain suddenness of solution, but this element of suddenness is not necessarily demanded in conceptual reasoning, or at least need not be markedly outstanding in it. The outstanding and specific characteristic of conceptual reasoning is neither its suddenness nor its gradualness, neither its validity nor its invalidity, but, as its name implies, its use of true concepts, or abstract ideas, and of judgments made up of such abstract ideas. In this respect it differs specifically from imaginal or perceptual "reasoning" or insight. There are abundant data from human psychology of a stripe with the concrete illustrations we have just given. From these data we seem amply justified in drawing, and in fact obliged to draw, the significant distinction between what we are calling imaginal or perceptual insight or reasoning and rational or con- ceptual insight or reasoning. In the former true concepts do not play a part; in the latter they do. Do the experimental and observational data of anthropoid psychology justify us in inferring that the insight or reasoning which the anthropoids manifest is conceptual as well as imaginal insight? If they do, then the difference between the highest type of human reasoning and the highest type of anthropoid reasoning is one only of degree. If they do not, then the difference is one of kind. Inferring anything at all in the matter is extremely difficult an'd to a certain extent hazardous. Comparative psycholo- gists are becoming more and more chary of inferring from animal</page><page sequence="36">behavior what exactly goes on in the animal's mind, even those comparative psychologists who refuse to go the whole way with the left-wing behaviorists. But at least we can draw certain tentative inferences, inferences that have in their favor a reason- able probability. In drawing such tentative inferences we can count for some help upon Lloyd Morgan's canon and upon the linguistic data. We shall take up these two in turn. Lloyd Morgan's canon runs as follows: " In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale ".85 The canon is not of course a final or absolute guiding principle. It is rather a pragmatic one, suggested partly by the more general canon of scientific caution and parsimony, partly by the historical exaggerations of the anecdotal school of comparative psychology. The canon probably goes too far, as the Gestalt school seems to hold. But on the other hand we can easily go too far in the other direction. Sober and balanced interpretation of the experimental and observational data would seem to call for something like a middle course, one perhaps not as rigidly parsimonious as the canon demands, but nevertheless reasonably parsimonious, if we would avoid lapsing into anthropomorphism as unscientific, even though less crude and more subtle, as that which characterized so much of the interpretation of the anecdotal period. Certainly, taking the experimental and observational data as they stand, we seem abundantly justified or at least sufficiently justified in inferring that they give evidence of nothing that cannot be accounted for as due to imaginal insight. There is no clear or even reasonably clear evidence therein of conceptual insight or reasoning. There is perhaps something present over and above what is evidenced, for instance, in the behavior of Jennings' uni- cellular organisms. But there appears no compelling ground for assuming anything beyond or above imaginal insight and " reason- ing." To go beyond this would seem at best a highly hazardous and reckless venture in inference. That the insight manifested is "perhaps " and " in a measure" identical with higher human con- 35 C. L. Morgan, An introduction to comparative psychology, 2d rev. ed., N. Y., I909, 53 36 PRIMITIVE AMAN</page><page sequence="37">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 37 ceptual insight and reasoning in the sense that both types of in- sight have certain elements in common is a scientifically safe and sound inference from the behavioral facts. But to go the length of Kohler and others with him and to infer, if my understanding of his and their position be correct, that such anthropoid insight is identical in kind with human conceptual reasoning as such,-- "intelligent behaviour of the general kind familiar in human beings ", -seems to the present writer going very appreciably beyond the sober limits imposed upon us all by scientific standards. Ockam's razor may have become a little dulled from long use-or a little rusty from disuse-but it is still a pretty serviceable or even indispensable scientific instrument. We do not, however, have to rely entirely upon Morgan or Ockam. If we did, we should have much more hesitation in our inferences than we have. More and better light comes from the linguistic data. If the anthropoid apes or other mammals have powers of conceptual as well as of imaginal insight and reasoning, we should except them to have true language or speech. The seeming absence of true language among them gives us fairly safe ground for concluding that conceptual insight and reasoning is absent. To this last point we shall return later. To sum up. To the question,-seldom asked in these words any more,-" Do animals reason?" a blank yes-or-no answer cannot be given. All depends on what kind of "reasoning" is referred to, imaginal or conceptual. That the anthropoid apes give evidence of imaginal insight or reasoning, seems reasonably clear, although it is far from clear that insight learning differs in kind or in toto from trial-and-error learning.36 That they give evidence of con- ceptual reasoning seems an inference neither justified by the facts nor justifiable in view of the demands of scientific parsimony, but rather in conflict with the data regarding language. Are we justified, on the other hand, in inferring finally, confidently, and conclusively from the facts that they lack conceptual reasoning? To do so, in the present state of the evidence, would seem to the 36 E. C. Tolman, Purposive behavior in animals and ticn, N. Y., 1932, 389; J. F. Dashiell, "A survey and synthesis of learning theories ", Psychol. bull., 1935, 32: 261-75; W. S. Hunter, "Learning: IV. Experimental studies of learning", in C. Murchison, ed., A handbook of general experimental psy- chology, Worcester, Mass., 1934, 509-514</page><page sequence="38">present writer to be going too far. The negative inference seems to be the more probable, the more reasonable, in the light of all the facts we have considered, perhaps very much the more probable or more reasonable, but that is about as far as we seem justified in going. Comparative psychology is still in its infancy, as is, for that matter, experimental work on the higher human cognitive processes. So far we have been endeavoring to tackle head-on the problem of imaginal versus conceptual reasoning in sub-human animals, confining ourselves almost entirely to the evidence from compara- tive psychology. A more fundamental approach is however possible, if we draw upon the evidence from human psychology as well. Back of the difference between imaginal and conceptual reasoning lies the problem of the relation of mental image to con- cept. It is to this problem we now turn. c. 7'he Evidence from Human1 Psychology Curiously enough, in most discussions of human mental evolu- tion the crucial importance and relevancy of the relationship be- tween mental image and concept seem not to be realized. At any rate, image and concept do not appear on the scene, or at least do not play leading roles, and have not since the days of the tilt on human mental evolution between Romanes and Mivart. How to explain the omission of the Prince from the play is beyond either the imaginal or the conceptual powers of the present writer. Maybe we can best assume that the consistent scamping of this main element has been due to the still widely persisting dominance of the old sensist school, dominant since the days of Hobbes nearly three centuries ago, with its practical identification, in kind at least, of concept and mental image. This procedure has made it easy to derive concept from image by evolutionary processes. The solution along this line is easy, but unfortunately is in the light of our evidence un pen simpliste. (I) Image, Meaning, and Concept As a first approach to our question of the relation of image to concept, a simple experiment may be suggested. Re-read the foregoing paragraph with a view of answering after you have finished reading it the following two questions: first, Did you 38 PRIMI TIVE 1IAN</page><page sequence="39">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 39 grasp its meaning, regardless of whether you agree with it or not?, and secondly, What mental images, visual or other, were present in your consciousness as you read it? I have just tried out the experiment on myself, with the follow- ing results. I hope I grasped its meaning, after having written it! The following visual images appeared, all of them very vague: at the words in the first sentence, "human mental evolu- tion ", image of gorilla; at the word "problem " in same sentence, blurred fragments of mathematical or geometrical problem worked on a sheet of paper; at the word " scene " in next sentence, a stage of a theatre; at the word " tilt ", image of knighthood tournament; no further image from then on until the word "dominance" in the middle of the fourth sentence, when a faint photo of Hitler popped up; no other image until last words of last sentence, " un peu simplistc," at which I saw the weak outline of a printed page, seemingly suggested by the French periodical in which I first met the expression a quarter of a century ago. All of these visual images were vague, fleeting, blurred; they were sporadic, discon- tinuous. Perhaps there were present also other images,-auditory, kinaesthetic, or others,-but I was not aware of them; if present they must have been extremely weak. Are these images the same psychic phenomenon as my realiza- tion of the meaning of the paragraph? It seems obvious that they are not. Gorilla, geometrical problem, stage of theater, knight- hood tournament, Hitler, printed page of periodical,-here is a disconnected series of images, a mixtum-gatherum, a hodgepodge, contrasting radically with the steady connected flow of meaning itself. Could anyone possibly reconstruct the skeletal meaning of the paragraph from these disjecta membra, if they can be called membra at all? Again, the meaning is sharply outlined; the images are vague, blurred, almost shapeless. There are all sorts of elements in the meaning that are in no possible sense present in the imagery. After an appreciable interval, I re-tried the experiment of read- ing the same paragraph. Some very fleeting revivals of some of the previous imagery were vaguely present more or less on the margin of consciousness, but in the main a very different series of images turned up: at "discussion ", a college debate; at "crucial ",</page><page sequence="40">the faint line of a cross; at "Romanes " and " Prince ", shadowy figures of men; at "sensist ", the verbal visual image " Hobbes ". The imagery differed almost totally. The meaning remained the same as on previous reading. I should be reasonably certain that if you have in the meantime tried out the experiment on yourself, your own imagery has been quite different from either of these series. Yet the meaning you got and the meaning I got were quite or very nearly the same. If image and meaning are the same thing or any thing like the same thing, there certainly should be more identity between the two than appears in the foregoing very rough tests. Such tests are too loose perhaps to be dignified with the name of experiments. Then, too, it might be objected: At any rate you had the visual perception of the printed page. Let us however look at the problem somewhat more methodically and in the light of the more elaborate controlled experiments that have been made in the field. If image and conceptual meaning are identical, then first they should be simultaneous and inseparable, and secondly they should have the same characteristics. The experimental evidence seems to show with compelling force, that at a given moment we can have imagery without conceptual meaning and conceptual meaning with- out imagery, and that the characteristics of the two mental phenomena are widely differing. In Moore's experiments on the temporal relations of visual image and meaning, out of I6I reactions, all, except one, of the reaction-times to visual imagery were longer than the median of the reaction-time to meaning. As regards kinaesthetic imagery, with all subjects tested the mean for reaction-time to kinaesthetic imagery was longer than that to the concept of purpose. In his series of reaction-times for the naming of pictures flashed before the subject and for the perception of their meaning, the means for reaction to the word were with all four subjects longer than those for meaning. In other words, in all three series of experiments reaction to meaning was shorter than reaction to image or word, and meaning was present in the majority of cases in significantly shorter time than was image or word. Conceptual meaning is therefore, we may conclude, something distinct from and in a real sense independent of image or word; it is a mental phenomenon of another order than that of imaging and naming. PRIMITIVE MAN 4o</page><page sequence="41">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 41 It may be added that in all these experiments by Moore, the words and pictures used designated familiar objects, such as anchor, rat, snail, ladder,-objects capable of being easily visual- ized. Abstract words, prepositions, and such were not used, although their use would certainly have been justified. In the reaction tests to visual and kinaesthetic imagery, the words desig- nating the objects were printed on cards and exposed to the subject, who registered his reaction to meaning or image by a Hipp chronoscope; in the tests of naming, drawings instead of words were used. The subjects, ten in all, who took part in the tests were experienced psychologists, including men like Kiilpe in the tests carried out at Munich and Pace in the tests carried out on this side of the Atlantic.37 That image and meaning are phenomena of different psychic orders is further evidenced by the widely different characteristics of the two. Images always have a sensory quality, similar to the corresponding sensation,-visual image to visual sensation, kin- aesthetic image to kinaesthetic sensation, and so forth. No mean- ing has sensory quality similar to or identical with sensation; meaning has no color, sound, smell. taste, muscular tension, or other sensory characteristic. Meaning has a certain character of generality by its own right. It is not something that is used in a general sense; it is the general sense. It is a mental structure that is essentially general in character. But "no image is general in the sense that it is applicable in an univocal sense to all the individuals of a class. Certain images approach a kind of general condition in as much as they become so vague and indefinite that they would be appli- cable to a variety of objects. Thus, when one of my subjects attempted to visualize a cow, and saw a patch of brown, such a patch might be taken for any brown cow, or, if the subject willed, for anything else that was brown ". In such instances, "we find vagueness, indistinctness and obscurity which allows of a varied application of a very imperfect image. This is quite a different 37 T. V. Moore, Image and meaning in memory and perception, Psychol. monogr., Princeton, N. J., I919, 27: 128-30, I37-38, i6o, 175. For references to other experimental data and discussions thereof see bibliography at end of present paper, section 7</page><page sequence="42">thing from the clear, distinct awareness of a meaning which, while it has no sensory quality whatsoever-either visual, auditory, or anything else-is still applicable in a perfectly univocal sense to all the members of a class; e.g., the awareness of the meaning of 'ship' as 'a means of transport by water' ".38 Imagery may cluster about or arise concomitantly with meaning, and commonly does, but, if the experimental results we have briefly reviewed be taken into account it seems abundantly clear that mental image and conceptual meaning are facts quite different in themselves and of different psychic orders. They can occur at a given moment one without the other, and their dominant characteristics differ. In passing, merely a few words may be said regarding the extreme nominalist view,-if indeed any nominalist ever really held it in its extreme form,-that thought and language are the same thing, that thoughts are words and words are thoughts. If they were, " why is it that we do not understand a new word as soon as we hear it or speak it? Why can we not learn to under- stand a foreign language simply by learning to pronounce it? Why is it that sometimes we know what we want to say but cannot find words to express the thoughts that are in our minds ?" 39 It is a matter of almost everyday experience with us, when reading litera- ture in a foreign tongue or even in our own to come across a word that is quite familiar to us, one we clearly recognize as having seen before, but whose meaning quite escapes us, if we ever knew it. Common experience speaks clearly enough on this point, although it also happens that experimental evidence is at hand. As stated above, some of Moore's subjects reacted to meaning in appreciably shorter time than they could name the object drawn on the exposed card. Of course, words and language may often help to clarify thought and to facilitate conceptual thinking, but this is obviously a quite different thing from constituting thought or thinking. 38 T. V.

Moore, loc. cit., 225 PRIMITIVE MAN 42</page><page sequence="43">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 43 Thought or concept as the bearer of conceptual meaning is certainly common to humanity as such. The evidence from linguistics and from racial psychology is unmistakable on this point. Is conceptual thought or conceptual meaning found in the sub- human animal world ? The experimental and observational facts can pretty clearly be accounted for without assuming anything beyond sensory, perceptual or imaginal ideation and "meaning". Scientific caution would therefore suggest as wise, though it would not compel as rigorously peremptory, the application here of Morgan's canon or Ockam's razor. There are however pertinent facts of a much more positive evidential significance, particularly those regarding sub-human, and especially anthropoid, vocal powers and powers of expression. (2) Language and Conceptual Thought From the data of comparative psychology two broader pertinent facts stand out, " facts" at least so far as comparative psychology can speak in the present state of the evidence. First, speech or language in the human sense is seemingly absent among the apes. Second, a sound-producing apparatus that should be capable of functioning as an organ of expression is present. Before reviewing the evidence bearing upon these two state- ments, a word should be said regarding the distinction between vocalization, language, and speech. Apes, like other animals, can emit vocal sounds. They have the power of vocalization. Like other animals, they can express, vocally and otherwise, emotional states. Such expression of subjective states can be understood by their fellows. In this sense at least, they can "communicate" with one another. If by language,-vocal language or speech, or other form of language,-we mean such vocalization and com- munication, then apes have the power of language. But the phenomenon we call language in human beings implies something more than vocalization and communication. It implies something more than vocalization. It implies con- ceptual thought. If my dentist in drilling my tooth strikes a nerve, and I emit a groan, I vocalize; if I remark to him, " That hurt me ", I speak. My statement, even though it concerns a</page><page sequence="44">subjective affective state, constitutes a conceptual judgment and. simple though it is, involves the affirmation of relationships between concepts. True language, vocal or other, is of its nature conceptual, expressing concepts (and relations between them) that denote objective things or subjective states. This is the very essence of language proper. Incidentally, too, language is acquired. cultural, conventional, not "natural", or common to the human species as such. A Kamchatkan would understand the meaning of my groan were he standing near the dentist's chair when I emit it; he would not understand my remark, my language, my speech. Language or speech does not necessarily imply an intention to communicate with other living beings. My groan need not have involved any such intention, although it could have done so. Nor need my remark have necessarily involved such an intention. I could have just been talking to myself. I can, and most of us do, speak at times without any intention of communicating with others. Actual communication or the intention to communicate with others is.not of the essence of vocal or other language. Thus, whether or not, or in how far, apes or other animals are able to communi- cate with one another, vocally or other wise, is not of essential significance to the question of whether or not they have the power of true language or speech. The real point at issue is: Do their vocal or other expressions denote concepts? We may now turn to the evidence bearing upon our two statements given above. Boutan, as a result of his five years' study of gibbon vocaliza- tion, concluded that all vocalizations of the gibbon " n'expriment . . .que des etats de l'animal et ne s'appliquent pas A des objets precis ". " I y a pseudo-langage, lorsque les sons emis sont spon- tanes et instinctifs. II y a langage, lorsque les sons emis sont conventionnels et representent des mots". The gibbon has "pseudo-language", in the above sense, not "language" as Boutan defines it. He defines language, as is evident, in a sense slightly different from the one we are using.40 Yerkes sums up his discussion of the evidence upon the vocaliza- tions of the apes in the following tentative formulation. " Everv- 40 L. Boutan, "Le pseudo-langage, observations effectuees sur un anthro- poide: le gibbon (Hylobates Leucogenys-Ogilby) ", Actes dc la Societe lilnn&amp;ltnne de Bordeaux, 1913, 67: 53, 42, 76 PRIMITIVE MAN 44</page><page sequence="45">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 45 thing seems to indicate that their vocalizations do not constitute true language in the sense in which Boutan uses the term. Apparently the sounds are primarily innate emotional expressions. This is surprising in view of the evidence that they have ideas, and may on occasion act with insight. We may not safely assume that they have nothing but feelings to express, or even that their word-like sounds always lack ideational meaning ". Again, speak- ing of the chimpanzee in particular: " Vocal reactions are frequent and varied in the young chimpanzee, but speech in the human sense is absent. Although the animals have a sound producing apparatus which presumably is capable of functioning much as does that of man, there is slight, if any, tendency to imitate sounds ". " All of the primates have a rather elaborate vocal mechanism with which they can produce varied sounds. In the apes the vocal organs are similar to the human, and they are capable of producing sounds varying widely in pitch, quality, and volume." 41 Kohler,-as usual, we might add,-is somewhat more emphatic and less cautious: "It may be taken as positively proved that their [chimpanzees'] gamut of phonetics is entirely 'subjective', and can only express emotions, never designate or describe objects. But they have so many phonetic elements which are also common to human languages, that their lack of articulate speech cannot be ascribed to secondary (glosso-labial) limitations. Their gestures too, of face and body like their expression in sound, never designate or ' describe ' objects (Biihler)".42 Warden, Jenkins and Warner, writing of the primates in general, summarize the experimental and observational results to date as follows: " The following situations appear to induce con- sistently more or less specific sounds: hunger, eating, fighting, minor annoyances, apprehensions, fear, pain, and friendly greet- ing. Perhaps as varied a repertory could be arranged for the dog. The sounds produced by the primates appear to be characteristic 41 Yerkes, Almost human, 179-80; R. M. Yerkes and B. W.

More- over, all these sounds that have been reported so far may very properly be classed as emotional cries .43 These results are not final, it is true. New data may throw further light on the question. Modifications of the inferences drawn by those who have had most intimate experience with the anthropoids under conditions making for cautious and controlled inference may perhaps have to be made in the light of future developments in the field. But the two major inferences seem to be pretty solidly based; at any rate they seem to sum up the results of our best technical experimentation and observation to date. What do these data and inferences signify? Why does the sub- human animal, including the groups nearest physically and it seems mentally to man, appear to lack true language, while man, of even the rudest and simplest culture, possesses it? The lack is pretty clearly not due to lack of adequate apparatus for vocalization. And even were such suitable vocal apparatus lacking, there would be other mediums of expression, as through gesture. We seem to be driven to the conclusion, in want of any satisfactory alternative explanation, that the ape's lack of language is due to lack of conceptual thinking, the lack of true concepts. As Yerkes has tentatively expressed it: " Presumably if capable of processes of abstraction and generalization to any considerable degree, it [the ape] would have developed a system of symbols analogous with human language ".4 The presumptive inference is not conclusive demonstration. It cannot be conclusively proven by specific experimental or observational evidence. Nevertheless, it does appear decidedly reasonable, or perhaps we may say, fairly compelling. The grounds upon which the presumptive conclusion we are making is based are the following. On the one hand, all groups who are known to have conceptual thought have developed 43 C. J. Warden, T. N. Jenkins, and L. H. Warner, Introduction to com- parative psychology, N. Y., 1934, 555,--quoted by permission of the Ronald Press Company. Garner's interpretation of anthropoid vocalizations is not accepted by comparative psychologists: cf. ibid., 555, or Yerkes and Yerkes, Great apes, I64 44 Yerkes and Yerkes, Great apes, 372,-quoted by permission of Yale University Press 46 PRIMITIVE MAN</page><page sequence="47">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 47 language. We refer here of course to human groups. Why, then, if the apes have conceptual thought have they not developed language? Or, look at the matter from the other angle. If a given group of beings has something to say, namely concepts, has the means of saying it, and has the need for or stimulus to saying it, they should certainly develop language. The apes have the means, vocal and other. They have the social need and stimulus. If they lack language, as they appear to do, we seem compelled to infer that the reason therefor is their lack of conceptual thought.45 This inference seems to be substantially corroborated by the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, the vocalizations of the apes express only subjective states. If the apes had conceptual powers, it would certainly seem strange that their vocalizations should denote only subjective states, never objective things or relations. If the concept is absent from the sub-human psyche, then we are in a position, it seems to the present writer, to give a more definite answer to the question of animal reasoning which we tried above to answer by the direct experimental evidence. The con- cept being apparently absent, conceptual reasoning, human reason- ing in its full sense, is absent too. Imaginal insight or imaginal " reasoning " appears as well established, but conceptual thinking proper, including the power of forming abstract concepts, of 45 This line of reasoning is developed at greater length in H. Gruender, Experimental psychology, Milwaukee, 1932, 272-76. Cf. Biihler, loc. cit., 12: "He [the chimpanzee] is as yet probably without concepts and the function of judgment"; "it seems to me that they [the apes] have not as yet proved to us that they judge or can grasp connections in reasoning". The available data upon "wild" children reared apart from human com- panionship do not appear to throw much light upon our question. Some of these children were feebleminded, others dumb, others deaf and dumb; in all or nearly all cases there was lacking the social stimulus to speech; in all or nearly all cases, the children, when later brought under educative influences, developed speech by word or gesture.

It is peculiar to man. III. INTERPRETATION OF THE MAJOR EVIDENCE If this be the case,-and it is in this direction certainly that our accumulating factual evidence from cultural and linguistic anthro- pology, from comparative psychology and from human psychology is more and more converging,-then between the human mind and the animal mind there is a chasm, and one not merely of degree but of kind. Nor is it a secondary or minor chasm; for conceptual thinking is the power that lies at the bottom of those things that are specifically or at least characteristically human. It is due chiefly to conceptual thinking that man is cognitively what he is. A psychic fact of a new and higher order emerges in man. Could conceptual thinking have evolved out of some other psychic fact or activity of a lower psychic order? If it did, then our first task is to find, if we can, just what it could have evolved from. The most likely candidate for the honors of parentage is mental imagery. Given the distinction of imagery from concep- tion and the radicallly different characteristics of the two mental structures, it is certainly very difficult to conceive just how the evolution could have occurred. Galton's and Huxley's famous analogy drawn from the art of photography is more interesting than significant. The concept, in their ingenious theory, was merely a sort of composite photograph of images. They presented no evidence for their theory. It was spun entirely out of their inner consciousness, and reminds an anthropologist very much of the numerous unilinear theories of cultural origins that sprang up so luxuriantly about the time this psychical theory sprang up,-with one difference, namely, that for the unilinear theories a certain amount of factual evidence could be marshaled, whereas for the composite-photograph theory no factual evidence of any value was marshaled. Our more recent experimental data seem to show that even composite imagery is decidedly rare. Moore in all his ex- periments was able to obtain only two cases of something remotely like composite imagery in the sense of Galton and Huxley.46 46 T. V. Moore, The process of abstraction, an experimental study, Univ. of Calif. publ. in psychol., 19Io, I: 76-78, I96-97; same, Image and meaning, 242-43 48 PRIMITIVE MA.N</page><page sequence="49">SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE UPON HUMAN EVOLUTION 49 Nor does the generic image, the "common phantasm" of the schoolmen, present a more valid claim to evolutionary parentage of the concept. As we have noted above, when reviewing the experimental evidence on image and meaning, the generic image, like any other image, is something radically distinct and different from concept or conceptual meaning. No matter how "generic" or "generalized" the image is, it is still an image, with all the characteristics of an image, not a concept, nor sharing the essential characteristics of a concept. It is a fact of another psychic order.47 On the empirical evidence we at present possess, we cannot, it seems to the present writer, say that evolution of the concept from the image is demonstrably impossible. But it does not look probable. The positing of such a theory,-unless the tentative explanation be put forward merely as a working hypothesis or a heuristic assumption,-would constitute a recklessness in inference that should justify severe criticism from the standpoint of careful scientific method. Could the concept have evolved from anything else in the sub- human psyche than the mental image? The present writer has come across no reasonable suggestion as to what this may or could have been, and he cannot think of anything else himself. Conse- quently he is in no position to discuss the matter further along this line. The attempt to derive concept from image represents in the main the application of sensist psychology to the problem of human mental evolution. The attempt seems to have broken down, as has the outright sensist psychology itself. Two other theories put forward to account for human mental evolution draw their support from the linguistic and somatological data respectively. They are seldom formulated or defended with clearness or thoroughness. They usually occur in the literature as obiter dicta. A critique, favorable or unfavorable, is consequently difficult. In fact it is rather hard to learn just what the proponents do actually hold. One's greatest anxiety in venturing any critique is that one will misrepresent the mind of the defenders. 47 See references supra under footnote no. 38</page><page sequence="50">The linguistic theory,48 if the present writer interprets it correctly, holds, in one form or another, that man acquired the power of conceptual thought by acquiring the power of true language or speech. The defenders of the theory do not seem to defend outright nominalism, although there does appear to be in their theory a generous touch thereof. It looks rather as if they assume thought to follow and emerge as it were from language. That thought is in very large measure dependent on language, no one of course questions. But, as the experimental and other evidence shows with all reasonable clearness, concept and con- ceptual thought can exist apart from language. The linguistic theory pretty clearly puts the cart before the horse. Conceptual language,-and language or speech proper is of its nature con- ceptual, - presupposes concepts and conceptual thinking. The linguistic theory thus fails to answer the very question at issue: Where did conceptual thought itself come from? It brings us back to our starting point and leaves us there. It does not carry us nearer to our destination. The somatological theory holds,49- again, if the present writer interprets it correctly,-that in some way or other the distinctly human type of intelligence has evolved as a result of the expansion, growth and specialization of certain parts of the human brain. Just precisely how brain growth could have given rise to con- ceptual thought is not stated. At best, the assumption is very hardy, not to say reckless. It is interesting speculation, not science. At the worst, it looks not unlike a begging of the question. Let us sum up our conclusions on the problem of human mental evolution. Animals appear to lack language, therefore they pre- sumably lack conceptual thought, and with it, conceptual reasoning. The chasm between the animal and the human mind seems in the present state of our evidence unbridged, and the chasm is an enormous one. Conceptual thinking and reasoning is a fact of its 48 Cf., e. g., Boutan, loc. cit., 75-77; G. A. de Laguna, Speech, its function and development, New Haven, g927, 55-56, 241 49 Cf., e. g., A.

Therefore there appears to be no specific evidence at hand on which it can be safely concluded that the chasm which now exists between the human and the sub-human mind was in the past bridged. On the other hand, while the evidence we have points away from human mental evolution, such evidence is not conclusively demonstrative. To help clear up the point, the present writer believes that a, and perhaps the, most important single point of attack for intensive study and experimentation is the relationship between concept and language. I do not for a moment wish to represent Yerkes as being an opponent of mental evolution in man, for I am quite sure he is not, but the following quotation from him does make clear that he is one of those who realize the enormous and baffling difficulties with which the problem fairly bristles,-would that the many who write so unrestrainedly and so confidently on the subject had some- thing of the same realization!,-and who are well aware of the greater or lesser insufficiency of the evidence for mental evolution as such evidence now stands. The quotation is from near the end of his review of some of the significant experimental work of Mrs. Ladygin-Kohts with her chimpanzee, Ioni. " This anthropoid ape in many respects stands next to man. Apparently the last word has by no means been said; it must be left to future investigators and more particularly to specialists in the psychology of animals and the psychology of children. United advance in these branches of inquiry will ultimately decide whether the important differ- ences, which are not to be denied between the minds of the highest animals and the most primitive man, appear as a temporary gap in our knowledge or as a far-yawning chasm which can never be bridged ".50 Boutan writes in somewhat similar vein, although he is seemingly more confident of the bridgeableness of the chasm and has him- self suggested a linguistic bridge across it: "I1 y a 1I [in the possession of language], actuellement, entre l'homme et les ani- maux un large fosse. II n'entre certainement pas dans ma pensee 50 R. M. Yerkes and A. Petrunkevitch, "Studies of chimpanzee vision by Ladygin-Kohts ", Jour. comlpar. psycho!., I925, 5: I07</page><page sequence="52">ni dans celle du savant [Yves Delage], que je viens de citer, de pretendre que ce fosse est infranchissable pour les animaux. Je constate simplement que, dans l'etat actuel de nos connaissances, on n'a pas trouve de pont solide, permettant de franchir le fosse." 51 SUMMARY This brings our paper to a close. Our purpose has been the sole one of passing in review some of the more significant and representative evidence bearing on these two vast questions, the evolution of the human body and the evolution of the human mind, and of venturing tentative evaluations of the strictly empirical evidence pro and con. So far as the human body is concerned, the evidence in favor of the theory, while still far from demonstrative in the strict sense of this term, has increased very much since the days of Darwin, and no important new data have come to light that would positively militate against the theory. So far as the human mind is concerned, the evidence since the same days has, the present writer feels, quite perceptibly weakened, clearly with the progress of cultural and linguistic anthropology and seemingly with the progress of comparative psychology and of the experimental psychology of the higher human mental processes. We cannot, the present writer believes, demonstrate from the available scien- tific evidence that human mental evolution was impossible. But it looks improbable. The evidence commonly adduced in favor of it breaks down badly nearly all along the line when submitted to close analysis and criticism. The chasm between the brute mind and the human mind is at present unspanned, and we can see no way in which it could have been spanned in the past. Resort to magic words like mutation and emergent evolution will not help us much. We need new facts, not new words. Until or unless such new facts themselves emerge and until or unless there occurs a mutation in our evidence, it seems premature to speak of human mental evolution as a scientific conclusion. Less concluding and more fact-digging should be the order of the day, and to judge from the present outlook we have ahead of us a long day's work. 51 Boutan, Joc. cit., 10, cf. 75-77 PRIMITIVE MAN 52</page></plain_text>
