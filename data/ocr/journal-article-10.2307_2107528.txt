Von einer "eigentlicher Bedeutung," die nur in speziellen Fallen fibertragen wfirde, kann gar nicht die Rede sein. - Nietzsche, Rhetorik' The true and the literal seem to be as intimately related to one another as children of the same family, direct descendants of a long Western philosophical tradition. They may bicker and feud with one another, but their disputes are carried out under a single roof. When metaphor appears on the scene, it is eventually accepted into the house as an adopted child, never quite at home despite sustained attempts to gloss over its parentage and establish new - even if initially rather strained-affinities with the rest of the family. Establishing a genuine relationship between metaphor and truth has, indeed, proven to be one of the most difficult of tasks, for they seem initially to have little in common, at least in this traditional setting. Yet one wonders what it would have been like if the setting had been different, if truth and liter- alness had been raised in the natural home of metaphor. What if meta- phor and truth are the natural siblings and their relationship to the lit- eral is an adoptive one? In the following remarks, I wish to pursue this set of questions. Many contemporary discussions of metaphor and truth have taken for granted the primacy of literal language and confined truth claims to the I Friedrich Nietzsche, Vorlesungen: 1872-76, in Gesammelte Werke, Musarionausgabe (Munich: Musarion Verlag, 19zz), Vol. V, p. 300.

Given these two presuppositions about the primacy of the literal and about truth as some type of correspondence, contemporary thinkers have faced a severe challenge in accounting for the possibility of metaphori- cal truth. Some have abandoned the notion completely, while most of the others have been forced to conclude that metaphorical truth is, as it were, a second-rate kind of truth whose genuine worth only emerges through a translation into more literal types of knowledge claims. In contrast to those who either deny the possibility of metaphorical truth or else reduce it to its literal counterpart, Nietzsche is interesting because he rejects both of these approaches to the problem of meta- phorical truth and the two presuppositions upon which they rest. Lan- guage in Nietzsche's eyes is not primarily literal; rather, it is fundamen- tally metaphorical. What we call the literal seems to be subsequent to, and parasitic upon, the metaphorical use of language. My concern is to determine the basis of Nietzsche's view of the metaphorical nature of language, explore the adequacy of such a position independently of its specifically Nietzschean formulation, and investigate whether this view of language provides a sufficient epistemological foundation upon which to base truth claims. Part One. Nietzsche on Metaphor and Truth Before beginning an investigation of Nietzsche's views on metaphor and truth, a prefatory note is in order. Nietzsche does not present us with a fully-developed theory of metaphor; rather, his remarks on this topic are scattered throughout published works, completed essays which Nietzsche himself did not publish, manuscripts of his university lectures in philology, and numerous entries in his notebooks of varying length and depth. If we were to liken the task of interpretation to that of reconstructing a pioneer's journey through a wilderness, we could look at these various passages as clues. Working with a rough and presum- ably inaccurate map of this wilderness territory, we could then mark each of these clues on our preliminary chart of the area. Given these points of reference and an initial idea of the terrain, we could then reconstruct on our map the route our explorer probably took. Yet such a reconstruction will always remain tentative: there may be other clues to which we had no access, the explorer's route may have been much less direct, our own ideas about the terrain may be mistaken, or we may even be wrong about the goal our explorer had in mind. Indeed, the ter- rain may even have changed since that initial exploration. In this section I wish to map out one possible path Nietzsche might have taken in his i 80 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="3">thinking about metaphor and truth. It has textual support, but I am far from convinced that it is the only way to reconstruct the path of Nietz- sche's thinking during this period. As with any such reconstruction, it is underdetermined by the available texts but not indifferent to them. Once this initial reconstruction has been mapped out, I shall then turn to the philosophically more intriguing question: are we - given a con- temporary awareness of the dangers involved in claims about meaning, reference, and truth - able to journey along the path Nietzsche has marked out without sinking into unavoidable skeptical bogs or being forced over the edge into chasms of logical self-contradictoriness? Are we, in other words, actually able to make the journey indicated on our reconstructed Nietzschean map or will the terrain prove to be impass- able? Before answering this question, let us reconstruct the map from the material available to us.' Nietzsche's discussion of metaphor is limited almost exclusively to the following three sources, which taken together span a period of approximately one year. (a) The completed but only posthumously published essay, "Uber Wah- rheit und Lfige in aussermoralischen Sinne" [hereafter: UWL], in Nietz- sche, Nachgelassene Schriften, in Werke, Kritische Gesamtausgabe [hereafter: KGW], edited by Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari (Ber- lin: Walter de Gruyter Verlag, 1973), Section III, Volume z, pp. 367-84. Part of this essay has been translated as "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense" by Walter Kaufmann in The Portable Nietzsche [hereafter: PN] (New York: The Viking Press, 1954), 4z-47. Nietzsche finished this essay in summer, i873. (b) A notebook with numerous references to metaphor [hereafter: N], pub- lished in Nachgelassene Fragmente: Sommer I872-Ende 1874, in KRW (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter Verlag, 1978), 111/4, pp. 3-io8. This note- book dates from summer, i872 until the beginning of i873. Citations include the notebook number, i9, followed in parentheses by the num- ber of the entry in the notebook, and then the page number in KGW. (c) "Rhetorik" [hereafter: R], a lecture course given before two students at the University of Basel. The opening sections of this series of lectures are published in the Gesammelte Werke, Musarionausgabe [hereafter: MusA], Vol. V, pp. 285-3i9. The full version has yet to appear in KGW. The Mus-A incorrectly lists the course as having been given in i874, whereas in fact it was given in winter, i872-73. On the correct dating of this course, see Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-La- barthe's introduction to their translation of some of Nietzsche's early writings on language, "Rhetorique et langage," Poetique, Vol. V (1971), p.

NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH i8i</page><page sequence="4">Most attempts to define the metaphorical take for granted a fixed domain of literal meaning which then serves as a stable point of refer- ence in contrast to which the metaphorical can be determined. There may, of course, be fundamental disagreements about what should be included in the domain of the literal. Some, for example, may limit the domain of the literal to the stock of everyday meanings established by conventional usage. They would unhesitatingly accept an assertion such as, "the chair is made of solid wood," as a paradigm case of the literal use of language. Others might claim that the boundaries of literal lan- guage are more accurately staked out by the natural sciences; everyday language about chairs gives way to scientific language about atomic structure, etc. Indeed, more positivistically-minded advocates of this position might restrict the literal language of the natural sciences to the observation sentences which comprise the data base for scientific theo- ries. In striking contrast to those who would grant the natural sciences specific property rights in the domain of the literal, religious fundamen- talists might well take the Bible or other religious texts as literally true; for them, science becomes "just a theory," i.e., not literally true. What- ever the merits of these various positions may be, we can note a com- mon element: they all attempt to establish some privileged point at which language and the world come, as it were, into direct contact, i.e., a point at which nothing is being "carried over" from another level or domain of meaning. It may be helpful in this context to recall Quine's view of science. . .. total science is like a field of force whose boundary conditions are experience. A conflict with experience at the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field. Truth values have to be redistributed over some of our statements. . . . But the total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions, experience, that there is much latitude of choice as to what statements to re-evaluate in the light of any single con- trasting experience. No particular experiences are linked with any particular statements in the interior of the field, except indirectly through considerations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole.3 To put Quine's simile to our own use, we could say that the closer lan- guage is to the periphery, the more literal it is; the farther we move away from that periphery, the less literal our language becomes, for it begins to "carry over" meaning from one place to another. The literal - whether this be defined in terms of common sense, natural science, religion, or in some other way - is that point at which language and world are most intimately in contact with one another and least con- I Willard van Orman Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism," in From a Logical Point of View, second edition, revised (New York: Harper and Row, i963), pp. 42-43. I8z LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="5">taminated by anything which does not directly touch upon their shared boundary.4 Nietzsche's defense of the fundamentally metaphorical character of language begins with an attack upon this notion of the literal. Going back to the Greek REatCEpEpELV to uncover the root meaning of the word "metaphor," Nietzsche tends to view any "carrying over" (Ubertragung) as an instance of metaphor.5 Thus, in contrast to most writers on metaphor, Nietzsche defines the realm of the metaphorical first, and the literal comes to be seen in a privative fashion as the non- metaphorical. A word is used in a purely literal sense, then, when there is no carrying over of any meaning. Indeed, Nietzsche implies that in an instance of completely literal meaning, there would be a complete coin- cidence of word and referent, for he clearly thinks that we begin to enter the domain of the metaphorical when we "leave out" elements of the original experience as well as when we carry over meaning from another experience.' Thus the paradigm case for the purely literal use of language would be the one in which a word expresses completely (i.e., without leaving out anything) the meaning of a given experience and which expresses only (i.e., without carrying over anything) that experience. It is far from clear whether anything could meet these extremely demanding standards; but if it could, it would seem to be something like a combination of a proper name and an exhaustive definite description. If we grant Nietzsche these rather strict standards for literal meaning, then he needs only one crucial premise in order to support his claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical: the proposition that no two experiences are completely the same. Given this, whenever a word is used to refer to anything except the "singularly occurring and thoroughly individualized primal experience to which it owes its origin,"7 it becomes metaphorical. Such a view of the literal is implicit, for example, in Mary McCloskey's claim that "Literal meaning and metaphorical meaning are related to each other in the way in which a photograph and an artistically distorted picture are related to each other," and her suggestion that "Both in groping for a literal description, and in groping for a metaphorical description, one is making a choice of words; but in the case of the literal description it is like wanting to fill a space with tiles and having oblong or square tiles to choose between, whereas groping for the metaphorical description is like taking an oblong tile and cutting it diagonally to do the job." Cf. Mary A. McCloskey, "Metaphors," Mind, LXXIII, 290 (April, i964), 230, zi9. Other examples of this view of the literal will be given below. 5 R, MusA, V,5p. 3i6. 6 Cf.

NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH I 8 3</page><page sequence="6">It is understandable, I think, if we initially view Nietzsche's argument with the same suspicious glance many reserve for Peter Unger's skepti- cal arguments. Indeed, just as the skeptic often seems to argue his case by establishing such impossibly high standards for our knowledge claims that nothing can pass the test, so Nietzsche seems to have such a stringent conception of the literal that he almost defines the literal out of existence. Indeed, one is tempted to say that Nietzsche just takes the notion of the literal too literally. However, in large measure this seems to be precisely Nietzsche's point: when we look more closely at the notion of the literal which we take for granted as self-evident, and when we begin to work out the full consequences of this notion, we discover that it is a much less coherent notion than we originally thought. Let us examine the way in which Nietzsche maps out those consequences and the way in which they lead him to the conclusion that truth is a "mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms - in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pic- tures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."8 The metaphorical process begins, Nietzsche argues, with the act of perception itself. We can only designate "the relations of things to man, and to express them one calls on the boldest metaphors. A nerve stimu- lus, first transposed into an image - first metaphor. The image, in turn, imitated by a sound - second metaphor."9 In each of these instances, Nietzsche continues, there is a "complete jumping from one sphere right into the middle of a completely new and different one." The first stage of this process, which Nietzsche refers to as a "perceptual meta- phor" ("Anschauungsmetapher"), is metaphorical in Nietzsche's eyes for two reasons. Insofar as metaphor is seen as a "carrying over" from one sphere to another, the transition from a nerve stimulus to an image involves a carrying over of what was given within the sphere of physio- logical stimuli into the domain of the imagination. What Nietzsche wants to stress here is that these are indeed two quite different spheres and that no literal translation from the one to the other is possible. Just as in the case of the literary metaphors with which we are more famil- iar, so also in this process of perceptual metaphors we carry over things from one domain to another. Yet there is another reason why this is a 8 Ibid., pp. 374-75 = pp. 46-47- 9 Ibid., p. 373 = pp. 45-46. i84 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="7">metaphorical process. "Each perceptual metaphor," Nietzsche argues, "is individual and not equal to any other."'0 Now, if we grant Nietz- sche his claim that "Metaphor means to treat something as identical which has been recognized as similar in one point,"" then we can see his second reason for viewing the perceptual process as a metaphorical one. "Our sense perceptions rest on tropes," Nietzsche writes in his notebooks, "not unconscious conclusions. The primal process is to identify the similar with the similar, to search out any similarity at all in one thing and then in another."' Here Nietzsche is emphasizing a sec- ond aspect of metaphor. Whereas in the preceding argument he had stressed the way in which metaphor involved a transition from one sphere to another, in this second argument he draws attention to the way in which metaphor involves treating similar things as though they were equal. Given this definition, and given Nietzsche's claim that no two sense impressions are the same, then insofar as perception involves any kind of ordering of perceptions according to a principle of same- ness, it is a metaphorical process. Once we begin to raise the question of "ordering" our perceptions uses the word "Rubrizieren,"'3 which refers to the process of entering items into columns under proper headings and which today we might call "pigeonholing" - we move into the realm of what Nietzsche calls "knowledge metaphors" ("Erkenntnissmetaphern"). ' Before looking more closely at the specific knowledge metaphors which we employ, it will be helpful to see the way in which they fit into the entire process of understanding. There are, in effect, three metaphorical transitions in the process. The first, from a nerve stimulus to an image, we have already discussed as the transition from sensation to imagination. It is meta- phorical in a two-fold sense: it carries meaning over from one sphere to another, and it treats as identical things which are only similar. The second transition is from the image to a sound or word. Again, Nietz- sche stresses the way in which this involves a carrying over from one sphere to another, and it is this which is the basis of his claim that we are again dealing with a metaphorical process.'5 The third metaphori- cal process occurs in the transition from word to concept, and it is at 'Ibid., p. 376 (not translated in PN). I KGW, 111/4, 19(2v49), p. 86. IZ Ibid., 19(217), p. 75. I3 E.g., ibid., i9(66), p. z8. I4 Cf. ibid., 19(210), p. 72. 's There is, however, an additional problem here, for Nietzsche has much to say else- where about the relation of images and sounds. See especially his essay, "Uber Wort und Musik," KGW, 111/3, pp. 375-87. NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH i85</page><page sequence="8">this point that knowledge metaphors serve to treat experiences as the same which in actuality are only similar. Thus we arrive at the follow- ing type of model: nerve stimulus - image - word as sound - concept In none of these transitions, Nietzsche argues, is there a question of a "literal" or "proper" relationship to the preceding sphere. Indeed, to talk about a "correct perception" would mean "the adequate expres- sion of an object in the subject - a contradictory absurdity, for between two absolutely different spheres such as subject and object there is no causality, no correctness, no expression, but at most an aesthetic comportment, a stuttering post factum translation into a com- pletely different language."' Thus in Nietzsche's eyes at each of these three crucial junctures there is a transition from one sphere to a com- pletely different one, and it is meaningless to talk about a literal corre- spondence between the two spheres, for there are no determining fac- tors intrinsic to one sphere which necessitate a particular translation or expression in another sphere. Given this outline of the entire metaphorical process of knowing, we can now direct our attention to the third and final stage, that of the knowledge metaphors. These fall under three main headings. "Time, space, and causality," Nietzsche writes in discussing the first of these three groups, "are only knowledge metaphors with which we interpret things for ourselves. "57 The most fundamental of these seems to be causality, and here Nietzsche sees our causal judgments as involving a metaphorical "carrying over" in two senses. The more obvious meta- phorical aspect of our causal judgments arises from carrying over our own experience of willing and performing an action into the realm of physical objects. "The only causality we are conscious of," according to Nietzsche, "is between willing and doing - this we carry over onto all things and interpret for ourselves the relationship between two changes which always occur together."' Even in the case of our own willing, we do not understand such-causality, but we do have a direct experience of it in such instances and it is this experience which is carried over into the world of physical objects. If we examine this experience more closely, however, we can see the second and less obvious metaphorical dimension of our causal judgments. In interpreting action, we usually describe and explain it as being the result of some characteristic of the person who performs it. We infer the existence of the characteristic i6 UWL, KGW, III/Z, p. 378. I7 KGW, III/4, 19(IO), p. 72. i8 Ibid., p. 71. i86 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="9">from the visible behavior, and even this - Nietzsche seems to suggest - is a metaphorical process, since it involves a carrying over from one domain to another, and one which provides the basic experience of cau- sality which we then transfer to the realm of physical objects. Thus the claim "that one thing is the cause of another is a metaphor, borrowed from the WILL and deed."'9 It is less clear how time and space are metaphors in Nietzsche's eyes, but he seems to think they emerge from the experience of causality as necessary aspects of the process of order- ing our experiences causally." Presumably the metaphorical dimen- sion of this process is to be found in the way in which we carry over an internal spatio-temporal ordering process and impute this to external objects in themselves, thereby carrying over a structure from one sphere into a quite different one. In all three of these knowledge metaphors which constitute the first of the three groups of such metaphors, we are dealing with ineliminable metaphors which we "produce in ourselves and out of ourselves with the same necessity with which a spider spins its web . . The second group of knowledge metaphors are the concepts we use to classify natural objects in the physical world, and these appear to be less fixed than the first group of these metaphors. In the following pas- sage, Nietzsche provides us with a sharp picture of the process whereby such metaphors are formed. Let us still give special consideration to the formation of concepts. Every word imme- diately becomes a concept, inasmuch as it is not intended to serve as a reminder of the unique and wholly individualized original experience to which it owes its birth, but must at the same time fit innumerable, more or less similar cases - which means, strictly speaking, never equal-in other words, a lot of unequal cases. Every concept originates through our equating what is unequal. No leaf ever wholly equals another, and the con- cept "leaf" is formed through an arbitrary abstraction from these individual differences, through forgetting the distinctions . . Thus concept formation arises, in Nietzsche's eyes, through a process which can be described in either of two ways. On the one hand, it can be seen as the omission of dissimilarities between two things in order to group them under the same word, which is thus elevated to the status of a concept; on the other hand, it can be described as treating similar things as though they were equal or the same by a selective emphasis on the points which they have in common. Under either description, what we find is that a word which was uniquely tied down to a single item is '9 Ibid.; see also 19(210), p. 72. 2? KGW, 111/4, 19(210), p. 72. 2` UWL, 111/, p- 379. 22 Ibid., pp. 373-74 = PN, p. 46. NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH i87</page><page sequence="10">carried over and used to refer univocally to other items which are not identical with the original one. It is this "carrying over" (and its correla- tive "leaving out") which is constitutive of the metaphorical process. But, one might well want to object, isn't Nietzsche conflating the dis- tinction between two quite different kinds of processes? While there may well be instances in which we obviously carry over a concept and apply it to something to which it is not literally applicable (e.g., my mother's car is a real dog), there are equally obviously other instances in which such carrying over is quite legitimate (e.g., Lassie is a dog). In other words, are not concepts which refer to natural kinds legitimate or justified ways of classifying things - and thus nonmetaphorical? Nietz- sche's answer to such an objection is a three-fold one, and a reconstruc- tion of it will complete our consideration of this second group of knowledge metaphors. "Nature," Nietzsche writes in developing his first counterargument, "knows no forms or concepts, and thus no spe- cies, but rather only an indefinable 'X' which is completely inaccessible to us. For even our opposition between individual and species is anthropomorphic and does not stem from the essence of things . . ."' There is nothing we can know about the essence of things themselves, in other words, that could provide an adequate justification for carrying over some characteristics and leaving others out in ordering our experiences of physical objects. The distinction between a legitimate (and thus literal) and an illegitimate (and thus metaphorical) process of carrying over characteristics from one thing to another has no foundation in the things themselves. Second, the anthropomorphic character of our classificatory language provides a clue to another figurative dimension in this process. Anthropomor- phisms are presumably metaphorical because they involve the carrying over of an order which applies to man into a quite different sphere, the realm of natural objects; yet they are figurative in another sense as well, for they can be seen as instances of metonymy, which Nietzsche at one point defines as the "substitution of cause for effect.""4 Concepts, Nietzsche suggests, organize things according to the ways in which they are related to us. In the more obvious sense of anthropomorphism, this implies that we organize the world of natural objects in terms of explic- itly human forms of organization (e.g., social, political, etc.); in the less obvious sense of anthropomorphism, we organize things according to the ways in which they stimulate our nervous system, i.e., as they are related to us through sensation. In both senses, it is relations which we 23 Ibid., p. 374; cf. 111/4, 19(Z36), p. 8i. 24 R, p. 299; cf. 111/4, 19(Z04), p. 69. i 8 8 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="11">fasten upon, not the things themselves; yet "relations can never be the entity, but only the consequences of the entity. The synthetic judgment describes a thing according to its consequences, i.e., entity and conse- quences are identified, i.e., a metonymy.""5 Indeed, Nietzsche contin- ues, "metonymy lies in the essence of the synthetic judgment." Insofar as our classificatory language attributes to things in themselves a system of organization which stems only from the effects of such things upon us, it is fundamentally metonymical. Nietzsche's third and final coun- terargument here is directed against the apparent plausibility of this objection to his position. We are certainly accustomed to treating some applications of concepts as literal and others as only metaphorical, but this is only a matter of convention. What is called 'true' is only "the cus- tomary metaphor - thus only an illusion which we get used to through frequent usage and no longer experience as an illusion: a forgotten met- aphor, i.e., a metaphor whose metaphorical character has been forgot- ten.556 Such metaphors become embedded in our language - recall the earlier description of them as "coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins" - and structure our experience in innumerable ways which usually escape our notice. The literal is just an instance of a dead metaphor, i.e., one whose metaphori- cal character has been forgotten. Yet when we lose sight of the meta- phorical foundation of apparently literal language, we do not simply forget something about the external world - we forget something important about ourselves as well. Nietzsche describes this eloquently. Only by forgetting that primitive world of metaphors, only by making that mass of images which originally flows forth in violent fluidity from that primal power of human phantasy into something hard and fixed, only by indominably believing that this sun, this window, this table is a truth in itself - in short, man lives with some measure of quiet, security, and consistency only by forgetting that he is a subject, and indeed an artistically creative subject."7 Thus the apparent plausibility of our everyday distinction between the literal and the metaphorical is grounded, not in the structure of things themselves, but in a language and social organization which conceals our creative power from our own gaze. The third type of knowledge metaphors can now be presented rather easily. In addition to those fundamental metaphorical ordering princi- ples of experience such as causality, space, and time and to those classificatory metaphors which we call concepts, there are metaphors to 25 111/4, 19(z4z), p. 83; cf. III/z, UWL, p. 377. z6 111/4, i9(229), p. 8o; cf. 111/4, i9(zz8), p. 78. 27 UWL, III/z, p. 377. NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH i89</page><page sequence="12">which we attribute some kind of independent existence: abstractions. "Abstractions are metonymies, i.e., interchanging of cause and effect," Nietzsche writes emphatically.z" They are "very powerful in language: abstract substantives are qualities in us and outside of us which are torn away from their bearers and presented as an independent entity."Z9 Nietzsche likens this to personification, and then continues by specify- ing the metonymical character of this process. "Those concepts, which owe their origin only to our experience, are presupposed as the inner essence of things: we attribute to appearances as ground what is only a consequence. The abstractions create the false impression that they are the entity which causes the qualities, whereas they only receive a figurative existence from us as a result of those qualities." We tend, in other words, to treat abstract substantives as the causes of perceptible qualities, whereas in actuality the causal relationship is reversed: those qualities create the abstraction itself, albeit only in and through our imaginations. Nietzsche describes the process in the following way. We call a person "honest." Why did he act so honestly today? we ask. Our answer usually sounds like this: because of his honesty. Honesty! That is to say again: the leaf is the cause of the leaves. After all, we know nothing of an essence-like quality named "honesty"; we know only numerous individualized, and thus unequal actions, which we equate by omit- ting the unequal and by then calling them honest actions. In the end we distill from them a qualitas occult with the name "honesty."30 Yet there is a final irony in this process which Nietzsche recognizes. Our abstractions are indeed metonymies, but this is not the end of the story, for at least in some instances - i.e., in cases in which we come to believe in the reality of our own tropes - we give them a causal efficacy which they originally did not possess. Indeed, Nietzsche suggests that this is what sets us apart from animals: we are able to place our behav- ior under "the mastery of abstractions . . . to volatilize perceptual metaphors into a schema."3' This not only allows a much greater degree of organization of our perceptual metaphors than would other- wise have been possible, but also promotes the eventual development of a world of concepts juxtaposed to immediately given sensations. It is a "firmer, more general, better known, more human" world and is thus seen as "regulative and imperative," even though it is only composed of concepts which are "residues of metaphors."32 Thus we forget the 28 111/4, 194(04), p. 69. 29 R, p. 319; cf.- 111/4, 19(415), p. 74 and 19(236), pp. 8i-8z. 30 UWL, III/z, p. 374 = PN, p. 46. 3' Ibid., p. 375. 32 Ibid., pp. 375-76. I90 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="13">metaphorical origins of our own concepts, imbue them with an inde- pendence and causal efficacy which they did not originally possess, order them in accordance with schemata which are themselves of meta- phorical origins, and then place ourselves under the domination of that world which was originally of our own construction. Our metaphors thereby acquire an independence and power insofar as they are no longer taken as metaphors but rather as the measure of reality itself; in becoming dead metaphors, they come to rule us. "A language," as one recent writer on metaphor has suggested, "is nothing but a necropolis for dead metaphors."33 Thus we see the full scope of Nietzsche's claim that language is fun- damentally metaphorical and that truth is but a "mobile army of meta- phors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." If we think of metaphor as a "carrying over" from one sphere to another, we see metaphor per- meating the process of knowing. Starting from the immediate data of sensation (the nerve stimulus, according to Nietzsche), there is a "carrying over" in two directions. On the one hand, a metonymical car- rying over from those data to an imagined external cause of them, a "thing-in-itself" which is the imputed cause of our sensations of it; on the other hand, a metaphorical carrying over of those nerve stimuli into images. The process continues in both directions. As we then make another metaphorical transition from images to words, so we organize the external world into particular kinds of objects which are put into pigeonholes fashioned by our own vocabulary. Finally, as we move from words to concepts, we see these individual external objects as manifestations of a world of essences. In treating each of these tran- sitions as metaphorical, Nietzsche wants to underscore the fact that these involve movements between radically different spheres of reality and that it is meaningless to talk about a "literal" translation from one level to another. Yet there is a second sense in which this entire process involves a "carrying over." Insofar as we carry over some aspects of an experience (and omit others) and thereby come to treat similar experi- ences as though they were equal, we order our experiences metaphori- cally; in other words, the categories and concepts in terms of which we order experience have no more epistemic justification than other meta- phors, except for the fact that we have forgotten their metaphorical ori- gins and let them harden into normative measures of reality itself. 33 "'As,' or The Limits of Metaphor," New Literary History, VI, i (Autumn, 1974), p. 84. NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH I9I</page><page sequence="14">This, then, is the theory of metaphor we find, sketched out in Nietz- sche's own writings. Let us now assess its merits. Part Two. Truth, Reference, and Metaphor Any position which maintains that language is fundamentally meta- phorical in character seems to be immediately open to two closely related objections. First, it fails to provide a coherent theory of truth. Not only does such a position seem to be unable to avoid logical difficulties about self-referentiality if one asserts the theory to be liter- ally true, but many would also claim that it is obvious that metaphors simply cannot be true or false. They may be appropriate, interesting, enlightening, etc., but not true or false, since they are not to be taken lit- erally. Second, such a position seems to provide an unsatisfactory account of reference, for it does not explain the way in which we appar- ently succeed quite often' in referring in a quite literal and straightfor- ward fashion. Common to both of these objections is the presupposi- tion that both truth and reference are properly rooted in the literal use of language. Metaphors, if meaningful at all, are parasitic upon literal meaning. These two objections are, I think, central, and any adequate theory of metaphor must be able to reply to them. Consider, first of all, some of the difficulties which surround any attempt to talk about metaphors as being either true or false. Many would maintain, for example, that one of the distinguishing characteris- tics of a metaphor is that it is obviously false, perhaps even logically self-contradictory, and that it is precisely this which provides us with the clue that we are dealing with a metaphor and not a literal state- ment.34 Yet this objection seems to miss the mark on two counts. First, as recent discussions have shown, not all metaphorical statements are false if taken literally." I may call someone a bastard and intend this in its metaphorical sense, but this does not preclude the possibility that it may also be literally true. Moreover, the negation of many metaphori- cal statements may be both metaphorical and true. If I deny the meta- phorical claim that man is a wolf, I am claiming that man is not a wolf, which may be both metaphorical and true. Thus not all metaphorical statements are necessarily false when interpreted literally. The second way in which this objection misses the mark is, however, more serious. 34 See, for example, Monroe Beardsley, "The Metaphorical Twist," Philosophy and Phe- nomenological Research, XXII, 3 (March, i962), pp. 293-307. " Cf. Ted Cohen, "Notes on Metaphor," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 34 (I976), pp. 249-59; Max Black, "More about Metaphor," Metaphor and Thought, edited by Andrew Ortony (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), pp. 19-45. I92 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="15">The objection presupposes that the literal meaning of a metaphorical statement is the real meaning. Many metaphors are indeed false if inter- preted literally, but it is precisely this which is at issue. If the metaphori- cal meaning of a claim is primary, then it may well be the case that metaphorical statements have just as great a chance of being true as other, apparently nonmetaphorical claims. If I say that man is a wolf to other men, and if the metaphorical meaning is primary, then presum- ably I mean that men usually exhibit in their behavior toward one another certain characteristics of aggressiveness, ferocity in groups, etc., ordinarily found in wolves; I would not mean that men are four-legged, have tails, howl at the moon, etc. If metaphorical meaning is primary as some have argued,"6 then the question of the literal truth or falsity of a metaphorical statement is of only secondary interest in determining the truth value of the metaphorical claim. The preceding reply removes one of the barriers to the possibility of metaphorical truth, but other, apparently more formidable, ones remain. In what sense, one might well ask, could a metaphorical state- ment be said to be true? It would hardly seem to meet the standards of a correspondence theory of truth, for these appear to be appropriate only to literal statements. Yet once again, I think, we are begging the ques- tion, for we are implicitly presupposing the primacy of the literal and then criticizing the metaphorical because it does not meet this standard. Indeed, the correspondence theory of truth and the primacy of the lit- eral often go hand in hand, for the suggestion is that literal language provides a picture of the external world in much the same way as a pho- tograph does; metaphor, on the other hand, is closer to a painting which provides a distorted, although nonetheless interesting, represen- tation of an independently existing external reality.37 Yet in rejecting the primacy of the literal, Nietzsche was simultaneously rejecting a view of truth as correspondence. His claim would not simply be that meta- phors do not pass the correspondence test, but that allegedly literal statements fail this test as well, and that the test would be an appropri- ate one only if there existed that kind of literal relation between word and object which has been criticized in the preceding section of this paper. 36 Cf. George Yoos, "A Phenomenological Look at Metaphor," Philosophy and Phe- nomenological Research, XXXII, i (September, 1971), pp. 78-88. 3 For an example of this position, see Mary A. McCloskey, "Metaphor," Mind, LXXIII, z9o (April, i964), pp. 2-15-33. NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH I93</page><page sequence="16">If truth is not to be seen in terms of correspondence, in what sense can we say that metaphors are true in Nietzsche's eyes? Although he hardly addresses himself explicitly to this question, it seems that we could construct a three-part answer to it which would, I think, have been acceptable to Nietzsche. The first, and most obvious, is that meta- phors are true insofar as they become fixed, sedimented in our lan- guage, taken as being justified by the way things are in themselves rather than dependent upon some creative transposition of meaning from one domain to another."8 True metaphors are, ironically, those dead metaphors which have come to dominate us. Such a claim, although startling at first, has been echoed in both contemporary Anglo-American as well as continental philosophy. In the Wittgenstein- ian tradition, for example, strong emphasis is placed on forms of life and the ways in which these establish a bedrock of usually unquestion- able meanings in terms of which experience is then interpreted.39 It is hardly surprising that Wittgenstein's claim is itself advanced in many instances as an examination of old metaphors and a suggestion of new ones.40 In the phenomenological tradition, we find that Husserl, despite his obvious commitment to the transcendental foundations of phenomenology, talks about sedimented structures of meaning and about the possibility of recalling or reactivating the original intuition on which they were based.4' Insofar as phenomenology relinquishes its transcendental aspirations and turns toward hermeneutics as in the phi- losophy of, for example, Hans-Georg Gadamer, we find that these sed- imented structures of meaning acquire a more fully developed historical dimension and become, like Wittgensteinian forms of life, the yardstick against which the truth and meaningfulness of all other particular claims are to be measured.4Z Both of these traditions are exploring in 38 This is evident, for example, in Nietzsche's claim that truth is an illusion which has become firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people. 3 For some criticisms of this position, see my "Can a Form of Life be Wrong?", Philoso- phy (forthcoming). 40 This is most evident in his work On Certainty; for an examination of Wittgenstein's treatment of some of these metaphors, see Jerry H. Gill, "Wittgenstein and Meta- phor," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, XL, z (December, 1979), pp. 27z-84. 4I See, for example, Husserl's essay, "The Origin of Geometry," in his The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, translated by David Carr (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970), pp. 353-78; see also the comments on this throughout Jacques Derrida, Edmund Husserl's "Origin of Geometry": An Introduction, translated by John P. Leavey (Stony Brook, N.Y.: Nicholas Hays, Ltd., 1978). 42 For a discussion of some of the problems in Gadamer's position on this point, see my I94 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="17">some detail what we find given in Nietzsche's work as only a sugges- tion: the claim that our experience is often structured in terms of certain root metaphors which, precisely because they are such a powerful force in organizing our experience, are taken as binding in such a way that they are often not even recognized as metaphors. Two examples of such metaphors in philosophy may help to clarify this point. Consider, first of all, that group of ocular metaphors which lies at the foundation of - and is perhaps responsible for the creation of - modern epistemology. The mind is seen as a mirror of nature, understanding is interpreted in visual terms such as insight, truth is depicted as something akin to a photographic representation, etc. In analyzing these and other similar metaphors, Rorty has argued that it "is pictures rather than propositions, metaphors rather than statements, which determine most of our philosophical convictions."43 The meta- phor is so basic that it often establishes the frame of reference within which it is questioned, and it is precisely this which accounts for its true dominance. Consider, as a second example, what Michael Reddy has called the "conduit metaphor," a basic metaphor that suggests that ideas or meanings are objects, that linguistic expressions are containers in which such ideas or meanings are conveyed, and that communication is the sending of such objects in such containers.44 This metaphor, present in philosophy as well as permeating much of our everyday talk about communication, has become so basic that it is hardly recognized as a metaphor, but often simply tacitly accepted as an accurate picture of the way things really are. It is precisely examples such as these which I think support Nietzsche's claims about truth as metaphors "which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people." This, I would suggest, is the first sense in which metaphors may be true for Nietzsche. Although it is intrinsically initially implausible since it neces- sarily questions metaphors so fundamental that they constitute the grounds of plausibility, it certainly need not be rejected for this reason. Indeed, upon closer examination, both independent philosophical justification and rather important examples can be advanced in support of Nietzsche's claim. "Quid facti or quid juris? The Fundamental Ambiguity of Gadamer's Understanding of Hermeneutics," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, XL, 4 (June i980), pp. 512-35. 43 Richard Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1979), p. Iz. 44 See Michael J. Reddy, "The Conduit Metaphor," Metaphor and Thought, pp. 284-3z4; see also the discussion of this metaphor in George Lakoff and Mark John- son, Metaphors We Live By (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, i980). NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH I95</page><page sequence="18">The second way in which metaphors might be true, in Nietzsche's eyes, would be in terms of his doctrine of the will to power as interpre- tation. In his later writings, Nietzsche no longer refers to metaphor, but his earlier descriptions of the metaphorical process of the creation of meaning are subsumed under the broader heading of the will to power.45 Since my primary concern here is to adduce independent sup- port for Nietzsche's position, and since a consideration of this line of argumentation will take us back into the labyrinths of Nietzsche's thought rather than along roads which intersect with contemporary paths of thought, I shall leave this aspect of Nietzsche's position unex- plored here and simply note that with his doctrine of the will to power Nietzsche is presenting us with a new metaphor which includes, but is not restricted to, domains previously structured in terms of traditional concepts of truth. The third and final way in which metaphors could be true for Nietz- sche is based on his claim that there is between subject and object at most an aesthetic relation.46 Metaphors can be true, I would suggest, in the same way in which art can be true. The difficulty, of course, is in specifying the sense in which art can be true, and in doing this I would like to depart somewhat from Nietzsche's own account. In his early work in which he views existence primarily as an aesthetic phenom- enon, he draws a distinction between Dionysian and Apollonian art forms and suggests that, while Apollonian art provides us with a world of beautiful illusions with which we can then endure the pain of exis- tence, Dionysian art seems to have a greater claim to truth insofar as it brings us more closely in contact with the primal nature of existence, which seems to be a pure undifferentiated flux.47 Insofar as he identifies this Dionysian domain as possessing some type of ontological priority, Nietzsche seems to be continuing - albeit in a somewhat unusual manner - the Kantian tradition of the Ding an sicb with all of its attendant problems. If we set aside this fundamentally metaphysical presupposition, the door is open to explore more fully another meta- phor which Nietzsche links closely with art: the metaphor of Spiel, play or game.48 The metaphor of aesthetic play offers us not only a way of conceiving of artistic truth, but also of dealing with one of the most vex- 45 See, for example, Nietzsche's remarks on this topic gathered together in The Will to Power, translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale (New York: Random House, i967), 508-617, pp. z76-331. 46 UWL, III/z, p. 378. 47 See, for example, Nietzsche's treatment of the Dionysian in The Birth of Tragedy. 48 I initially dealt with Nietzsche's remarks on this topic in "Nietzsche's Philosophy of Play," Philosophy Today, i8, 2/4 (Summer, 1974), pp. i06-24. I96 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="19">ing problems in an account of meaning which stresses the primacy of the metaphorical, the problem of reference. Imagine the relation between words and objects in terms of a board game such as chess. The particular pieces of wood which serve as the chess pieces gain meaning only within the context of the game. It would make little sense to ask of a particular piece, "Is this really in itself a rook?" The piece is what it is only within the context of the game. (One could imagine, in a pinch, using the same pieces to play checkers - the meaning of the pieces would then be dependent upon the new game.) There is, moreover, nothing about the piece which makes it intrinsically a rook rather than anything else; indeed, should we be missing a rook, we might take almost any object of suitable size and allow it to stand for the missing rook. An aesthetic model of reference would, I think, follow along these same lines. Words would refer, and do so in a rule- governed way, but it would simply not make sense to ask whether they succeeded in dividing things up according to the way in which they are in themselves; rather, in a process akin to that of the "dubbing" or "baptizing" described in contemporary causal theories of reference, objects are taken up, identified as such and categorized within the con- text of particular language games. There are, if this model is correct, only different language games within which referring occurs; there is neither a privileged, unmediated access to "the things themselves" nor a game which can claim ontological superiority to all other games, but only a network of partially overlapping games whose rules may include correlation roles to allow players to move from one game to another. The play metaphor provides us, moreover, with a framework within which we can better understand the status of our truth claims, whether literal or metaphorical. Can we say that the root metaphors in terms of which our experience is structured in a most fundamental way are true or false? Is, for example, the ocular metaphor which is so influential in epistemology true or false? The difficulties surrounding such a question are obvious. The metaphor itself includes a theory of truth, and thus provides the standard in terms of which it itself is to be judged; yet one of the things which is being questioned is the adequacy of this very standard. Any answer to our question must either presuppose the meta- phor under examination or else presuppose some other root metaphor which would itself be open to similar scrutiny. In other words, there is no privileged vantage point from which we can determine whether root metaphors are true or false; they can, at best, be scrutinized either from within, thus taking for granted that root metaphor, or from without, thereby taking for granted the validity of some other root metaphor. If NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH I97</page><page sequence="20">we accept the play or game metaphor presented here, we see why such an assessment of root metaphors is beyond our reach. If we accept this metaphor, there is no ontologically privileged game which provides the measure of all other games nor is there an ontologically privileged real- ity "in itself" to which such games must correspond; rather, there is a multiplicity of different games, partially overlapping, with different rules of translation to allow movement from one game to another. Given the impossiblity of asserting the truth of any one root meta- phor in terms of which a game is structured, we still see that there is room for a wide variety of types of truth claims within different kinds of games. What we generally consider to be literal and empirically verifiable claims would in Nietzsche's eyes be admissible, perhaps even quite important, in some games. He would, however, emphasize two points in this regard. First, games such as those we find in the natural sciences which take some version of verificationism as the criterion of meaningfulness are no more revelatory of the true nature of things in themselves than, for example, the names of chess pieces in a chess game. This is not to deny that the truth value of empirically verifiable state- ments is not in some sense dependent upon what could be called an independently existing external reality; rather, it is to claim that the nature of that dependence is such that it does not justify a claim to hav- ing described the way things are in themselves. The second point fol- lows as a corollary of this. Nietzsche would, I think, point out that there are a number of other types of games, including some that we group under the heading of art, which permit the possibility of quite different kinds of truth claims. We may well want to say, for example, that a play such as Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannos is true, not in the sense that it is an accurate portrayal of events which befell an actual individual, but rather in the sense that it reveals something universal about the human situation.49 Yet other senses of truth are explored in games of the type Kierkegaard mapped out in his discussions of the claim that truth is sub- jectivity.5? Still another idea of truth is revealed in contemporary dis- cussions of what counts as a true interpretation in psychoanalysis.5' Although there are a number of other such examples which could be cited here, the point is already sufficiently obvious: what counts as truth depends upon the game we are playing. Again, it should be stressed that 49 Aristotle, Poetics, 145 Ib6. 50 See especially Kierkegaard's Concluding Unscientific Postscript. 5' See, for example, Jiirgen Habermas, "Der Universalitdtsanspruch der Hermeneutik," in Hermeneutik und Ideologiekritik (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1975), pp. 1Z0-59, for a treatment of this that breaks away from the positivist's approach. I98 LAWRENCE M. HINMAN</page><page sequence="21">such a claim is not equivalent to saying that truth is arbitrary or that there is no possibility of criticizing truth claims made within one game from the vantage point of some other game; rather, it is stating that such claims are never fully justifiable on the basis of an appeal to some independently existing reality and that such claims are never subject to evaluation from the standpoint of some criterion of truth which itself stands above all individual games. Truth is only revealed within the context of particular games, and no specific game has a claim to onto- logical priority. Conclusion The claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical and that literal meaning is parasitical upon metaphor seemed at first to be obviously false, for it seems that the literal is necessary in order to have that stabil- ity of meaning upon which metaphorical language can then build and which it must necessarily take for granted. Using Nietzsche's early work on metaphor as a guide, we have mapped out an account of meaning, metaphor, and truth which departs radically from this standard view. If Nietzsche is right, the very process of perceiving and knowing is per- meated in several senses by metaphors: not only is the process itself fundamentally a metaphorical one in the sense that it involves a carry- ing over from one domain to another, and not only is it a metaphorical process in the sense that we treat similar things as though they were the same, but it is also metaphorical in the sense that the structures of knowing are themselves metaphors, what Nietzsche calls knowledge metaphors. In asserting the primacy of the metaphorical in these Nietz- schean senses, we are in effect claiming that there is no privileged, literal link between language and reality nor any privileged structure to our ideas such that all other structures must be taken as secondary and figurative. In defending Nietzsche's view, I have tried to show that such a posi- tion need not forfeit the possibility of either a referential dimension to language or of truth claims within a particular language game. The primacy of metaphorical meaning does not exclude the possibility of referring or of truth, but rather simply grounds their possibility within the context of specific games. What remains to be done, especially in light of the way in which we have in large measure been dominated by the notion of truth found in the language games of natural science, is to explore in some detail the way in which truth is revealed in other games in terms of which we structure our experience. That, however, is beyond the scope of this paper. NIETZSCHE, METAPHOR, AND TRUTH I99</page></plain_text>
