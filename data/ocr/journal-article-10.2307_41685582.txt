DAY The north archaeological coast otherwise consists barren of area nine of river the valleys Peruvian The that north coast consists of nine river valleys that cross an otherwise barren desert region. The Moche Valley occupies a central position in this desert strip, which stretches for some 350 kilo- meters along the coast. Owing to the rainless cli- mate, human occupation has of necessity been concentrated in these coastal valleys, where rivers, carrying junoff frpm the western slopes of the Andes Mountains provide the only source of water. Lack of rain has also made large-scale agriculture dependent Upon the development of irrigation systems. Thus, the Peruvian coast pro- vides an excellent opportunity for the study of the interrelationship between environmental ex- ploitation and social organization. During the Late Intermediate period, which dates from about a.d. 900 to 1463, the Chimú Kingdom, with its capital at the urban center of Chan Chan in the Moche Valley, dominated the entire north coast of Peru. This Kingdom was a great urban state with cities, fortresses, road sys- tems and vast irrigation works. The recent field- work of Harvard's Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project has enabled the authors to construct a tentative model of the socio-economic structure of the Moche Valley during Chimú occupation. Our model is based upon the integration of data 228</page><page sequence="2">Aerial view of central Chan phan and the surrounding cul- tivated zone.

Plan of the civic center of Chan Chan, showing the major architectural features. on the architecture, settlement pattern, ecology and ethnohistory of the area. Systematic interre- lationships and feedback existed between the com- ponents that fostered the growth and mainte- nance of this system - environmental conditions, urbanism, social stratification and the accumula- tion and distribution of goods. The archaeological evidence dating to the Chimú occupation of the Moche Valley exhibits precisely those elements or attributes which are indicative of a highly or- ganized, centralized socio-economic system. In- cluded among these elements or attributes are mass-labor constructions, specialized buildings, architectural evidence of social differentiation, storage complexes and auxiliary administrative facilities in agriculturally productive areas. A prehistoric city with a total area of 24.5 kilometers, Chan Chan surpasses in size all other archaeological sites in the Moche Valley. Its civic center alone covered approximately six kilometers. The urban area of Chan Chan can be generally characterized with reference to three different types of architecture - slums, interme- diate buildings and monumental structures. The zone occupied by slums extends out from the western edge of the central area or urban core of Chan Chan and consists of crowded, agglu- tinated dwellings which exhibit no formal plan- ning. A large part of this particular architectural zone has been destroyed by modern-day farming, making an accurate estimate of its original extent impossible. Extensive tracts of planned houses, courts, passageways and platforms are devoted to the intermediate architecture. For the most part concentrated in the central section of the city, these structures are more formally arranged than the slum buildings but less complex than the monumental architecture with which they are usually associated. Ten large rectilinear enclo- sures constitute the monumental architecture at the site. With exterior abode brick walls meas- uring from 200 to 650 meters on a side and rising to a height of nine meters, these enclosures ex- hibit the best-preserved and most sophisticated architectural planning at Chan Chan. The eight more formally arranged of these enclosures are referred to as cindadelas and the remaining two simply as compounds. Because of their impressive size, and internal complexity the ciudadelas are considered to have been the residences of an elite group or groups. 229</page><page sequence="3">Plan of Ciudadela Rivero. In general, ciudadelas are oriented north-south with a single entrance at their northern end. In- ternally, ciudadelas are consistently divided into three basic sectors by transverse walls. Each ciudadela has a north sector with an entrance at the north end, a central sector across the middle and a canchone across the south end. As at Ci- udadela Rivero, for example, in each north sec- tor there is a narrow, elaborate entrance (lined at its base with niches, each of which held a carved wooden figure) in addition to courts, Carved wooden figure in situ in the niched wall on the east side of the entrance in the north section of the Ciudadela Rivero. The figure measures about 90 cm. high. colonnades, corridors, a kitchen, usually with a large open walk-in well, courtyards lined with flat-roofed or gable-roofed storerooms, and U- shaped structures called audiencias , in each of whose interior wall faces there is a pair of niches. The central sectors nearly duplicate the north sectors in plan and architectural content except that there are fewer audiencias and more store- rooms and in each such sector there is a massive burial platform. In contrast to the other parts of the ciudadela, the isolation of the central sec- tor, the large number of storerooms in relation to the number of audiencias, the presence of a kitchen and a burial platform suggest that this area was set apart as the royal sanctuary. The rear sectors or canchones are free of extensive standing structures and frequently contain a walk-in well. Remains in the form of irregular wall stubs and organic debris provide evidence that the canchone was the site of considerable domestic activity. However, the interrelationship of the structures within the north and central sectors and the circulation pattern through courts and corridors provide the clues to the interpre- tation of the functions of the ciudadelas. 230</page><page sequence="4">Part of a mud-plaster frieze decorating the side of a ramp in Ciudadela Velarde. This elaborate frieze depicts crustaceans, fish, birds and anthropomorphic figures. First discovered in the early 1900's and its whereabouts forgotten, this frieze was recently rediscovered by Samuel H. Burr, a member of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project, and is now known as the "Burr Frieze." Because looters or vandals would have destroyed the frieze had it been left exposed, it was reburied after being drawn and photo- graphed. Photograph, courtesy of Betty Keatinge.

A hypothetical reconstruction of an audiencia in the north sector of the Ciudadela Rivero. The drawing is by Carlos Felipe. In both the north and the central sectors, access to the storerooms is controlled by the U- shaped audiencias. The approach to an audiencia is always a tortuous system of narrow corridors. In fact, access to an audiencia is never direct, and corridor traffic may well have been one-way and single file. The standard audiencia contains six niches, two set in each wall. Derivatives of this basic plan are defined by changes in overall audiencia size and the occurrence of modified or additional niches, troughs, bins, or decorative friezes. Beyond the audiencias are storage courts with rows of contiguous adobe structures. Each build- ing has a single entrance 60 centimeters wide and a threshold nearly one meter high. Although no 231</page><page sequence="5">Partially restored audiencia decorated with lattice- work and bird friezes exe- cuted in mud plaster. Photograph, courtesy of M. E. Moseley.

Moseley. conclusive evidence of their contents was found in the excavation of some 75 of these structures, they are deemed storerooms on the basis of their contiguous arrangement, high-silled single en- trances and complete lack of domestic debris or equipment. While no goods were found in the test excavations, we consider it fairly safe to assume that originally they contained foodstuffs, fibers, metal objects, textiles, featherwork, per- haps agricultural implements, weapons and so forth. Even if positive identification of what was kept in the storerooms is unclear, it seems ob- vious that control over the goods they held was exercised by the individuals ensconced in the audiencias. Thus, the relationship of the audien- cias to storeroom complexes through an inte- grated system of corridors can be interpreted as the architectural expression of Chimú adminis- trative control over the storage and distribution of goods. The ciudadelas, no doubt, served as residences of high-status individuals who directed the accumulation, access to and distribution of goods. In the larger perspective of environmental conditions it is clear that the exploitation of land provided a basic source of food and fiber on a large scale. Since these essential products were probably among those placed in storerooms, it is apparent that administrative control over not only storage but also production was centralized at the audiencia/storage complexes located in the ciudadelas at Chan Chan. This pattern of a cen- trally controlled economic administration was ex- tended to the agriculturally productive areas of the valley where auxiliary administrative units were charged with the management and exploi- tation of productive resources. The settlement pattern of the sustaining area which supported the Chimú socio-economic or- ganization was very definitely affected by the concentration of population at Chan Chan. Al- though the total population of the valley con- tinued to increase, the population in the rural areas was largely concentrated in a few villages. This is shown by the fact that only four villages contemporary with Chan Chan have been lo- 232</page><page sequence="6">Plan of the main structure at Quebrada del Oso. This building, located in the middle of prehistoric field systems and adjacent to the intervalley canal, is one of several Chimú rural administrative centers whose officials were responsible for the maintenance of state control over land and water resources. The structure illus- trated is characterized by entrance courts, tortuous passageways and symmetrical placement of rooms; most im- portantfy, it has a niched audiencia as its focal point.

Note the U-shaped audiencias, niched walls, entrance courts and ramps, features which are also found in the ciudadelas at Chan Chan. The niches and many of the smaller rooms in the structure were roofed, but the larger rooms and entrance courts were probably open to the sky.

Though scattered houses and other ruins dating to the same time also exist, these four villages represent the only major aggregates of population outside the capital city. It is apparent that the rural, agriculturally productive areas of the valley were organized, maintained and owned as state enter- prises. Several studies of the canals and field systems located north and west of Chan Chan have de- scribed these features as planned, state-run undertakings. The highest canals of the valley, especially the intravalley Moro Canal and the intervalley La Cumbre or Chicama-Moche Canal, are huge and attest the ability of the Chimú state to amass and direct large labor forces for the construction of public works in rural areas as well as at Chan Chan. Chimú state management of agriculturally pro- ductive regions was maintained through admin- istrative units located in nonmetropolitan areas of the valley. These "rural administrative centers" served as focal points of state economic control headquartered in Chan Chan ciudadelas. An an- alysis of architectural and ecological factors ex- hibited at three such sites suggests that these centers represented state authority in rural areas of the valley and had as their primary function the maintenance of state control over land, water and labor resources. The three sites, El Milagro de San José, Que- brada del Oso and Quebrada Katuay, consist of large, isolated structures, which are surrounded by extensive field systems and which are situated near a major irrigation canal. The main struc- ture at each site is a rectilinear compound with thick stone walls which, we estimate, once reached a height of 2 to 2.5 meters. Like the 233</page><page sequence="7">One of the five audiencias excavated in the main structure at El Milagro de San José. The basic difference between these rural audiencias and their counterparts at Chan Chan is that the rural examples are built in stone while those at Chan Chan are constructed in adobe brick.

Drawing by Carlos Filipe. ciudadelas at Chan Chan, all these structures are oriented in a northerly direction, each with a single entrance at its northern end. Again, like the much larger ciudadelas at Chan Chan, the interiors of these rural enclosures are character- ized by entrance courts, pilastered doorways, tortuous passageways and a symmetrical arrange- ment of rooms. At El Milagro de San José the main structure contains a kitchen located off the first entrance court in relatively the same position as the kitchens in the ciudadelas at Chan Chan. Most importantly, at each of the three sites the main structure has or probably had one or more audiencias as its focal point. The only other architectural features at the sites are the struc- tures which occur at El Milagro de San José and Quebrada del Oso, but not at Quebrada Katuay. The repetitive architectural arrangements of these three sites and their obvious affiliations with the ciudadelas at Chan Chan suggest that the administrators of these communities were re- sponsible for organizing and maintaining state control over rural agricultural and irrigation re- sources. The occurrence of audiencias in these rural areas serves to substantiate further the im- portance of the sites in the Chimú socio-eco- nomic system. Audiencias in the ciudadelas at Chan Chan are most often associated with the control of access to storerooms or other restricted areas. It is therefore assumed that the presence of this particular architectural feature in a rural context symbolizes the extension to outlying re- gions and the economic unity of the state control and authority centered at the Chimú capital. Furthermore, the overall planning evident in both the structures and the field systems strongly suggests that the Chimú state not only developed but also owned the land surrounding these com- plexes. Since all three sites are isolated with no trace within the immediate vicinity of a nearby population concentration dating to the Late Intermediate period, it must be assumed that some form of tribute or corvée labor, such as the miťa system of the Inca, was employed in build- ing and maintaining the structures, fields and nearby irrigation canals. Such labor crews could have been drawn from the few villages located in areas outside Chan Chan or, very probably, from the masses of laborers who must have been available in Chan Chan's slums. .^Architectural distinctions at the site of Chan Chan in conjunction with data suggesting cen- tralized control over rural land and canal man- agement point to the existence of the hierarchical social structure described in the Spanish chron- icles. If our interpretations of the archaeological evidence are correct, then it is apparent that the elite of the Chimú state exercised considerable power over production, storage and redistribution of goods. By their ability to marshall large num- bers of workers for field and canal construction this elite effectively maintained its control over the two most important elements in the Chimú economy - land and water. Clearly, the efficient management of land and water resources could produce agrarian wealth. The existence of a hierarchical social organiza- tion based upon the successful exploitation of these natural resources and maintained by dif- ferentiated access to labor and production is ex- emplified both in the pattern of community settlement at Chan Chan and the rural settle- ment pattern of the valley. Large-scale agricul- 234</page><page sequence="8">turai production in the dry desert environment could not be undertaken without the construc- tion of irrigation networks. By their ability to plan huge canal networks and organize the labor crews to build them, the Chimú elite were able to bring into production large expanses of land. The wealth accruing to the state through the ownership of these lands could then be redistrib- uted among the landless lower classes from which the labor forces were drawn. The construction of canals and the management of rural produc- tion were organized through a number of rural administrative centers, while overall responsi- bility for the functioning of the economy, includ- ing storage and redistribution of goods, was cen- tralized in the ciudadelas at Chan Chan. Thus, the capital city can be seen as the focus of ad- ministrative authority in the valley where agri- cultural production was organized and managed through auxiliary administrative centers.
