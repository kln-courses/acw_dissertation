<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIXTEENTH ORDINARY MEETING Wednesday, March içth, 1941 PETER LE NEVE FOSTER LECTURE His Excellency the Greek Minister (M. Ch. Simopoulos) in the Chair [Owing to illness, Professor Murray was unable to deliver his lecture in person, but it was read in his absence by Sir John Forsdyke, K.C.B. , Director of the British Museum.] HELLENISM AND OUR PRESENT CAUSE By Professor Gilbert Murray, O.M. The old classical tradition, with all its weaknesses, has deep roots in England. Two members of the House of Commons were once discussing why it was that Mr. Gladstone, when compared with such highly able and industrious colleagues as Joseph Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke, seemed to tower above them by a sort of " greatness " of mind and character. " One thing is/' said one of them, " that Mr. Gladstone spends his spare time reading Homer and Plato and Dante and the Bible, whereas Dilke and Chamberlain mostly read bluebooks." Bluebooks, of course, seemed far more businesslike ; bluebooks taught them the facts and statistics which they wanted to know, and in the end bluebooks tended to make the furniture of their minds. Mr. Gladstone could get up the facts and statistics when they were wanted, but for a permanent possession he preferred to carry about with him the greatest thoughts of poets, saints and philosophers. And when he spoke, that possession coloured his language ; when he faced a political problem, those ideas formed his background. There is something peculiarly English or at least British in this attitude of mind. I am sure neither Bethmann-Hollweg nor Stresemann, not to speak of the present usurpers of power in Germany, would ever have spent their leisure</page><page sequence="2">334 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April l8, 1941 in reading Homer and Plato and the New Testament. They might have listened to music ; they would probably have drunk beer ; but read Greek - the very idea would have seemed ridiculous. University professors were paid to do that. In France it would be different. There would be quite as much literature, but not so much classics. M. Herriot, an omnivorous reader, might be caught with Dante or Vergil, and Marshal Pétain with the Imitatio Christi ; but Laval, Briand, and the majority of ex-Prime Ministers - I think not. Among English statesmen of the older tradition, a weakness for great literature, and in particular for Greek literature, has been almost endemic. Charles James Fox is a striking instance. It is always difficult for us moderns to understand the enormous affection and admiration which Fox inspired. To us he seems a courageous and eloquent but singularly unsuccessful statesman. But listen to the opinion of a contemporary, not actually a member of Fox's party ; to Sir Francis Burdett he was " the man who is universally acknowledged to be the greatest character in this country, whose virtues and abilities are so transcendent as to hold him out to the whole world as an object of esteem and admiration.' ' Was not his secret the same as Mr. Gladstone's ? He was not very diligent about bluebooks ; Pitt easily beat him there. He read great literature and his mind was full of the kind of thoughts that inspired the greatest writers of the past. He was quite an authority on Euripides. He seems to have been at home in great literature everywhere. Once at Rogers' breakfast table he was suddenly asked what was the greatest work of imagination produced in Italy in the eighteenth century. Most of us, I think, would have felt rather at a loss or at least have asked for notice of that question. But Fox was not taken aback ; he suggested at once " Metastasio's Death of Adam ." Burke, Gladstone, Peel, Lord Derby, Asquith, Bryce, Baldwin - and may we add General Wavell ? - all carried on the tradition, not merely a tradition of classical scholarship, but something far deeper - a conviction, held as an obvious and indisputable truth, that however pressing a particular crisis, and however important the immediate financial or electoral interests involved, there are always other considerations more permanent, considerations of wisdom or honour or magnanimity or may be of eternal right and wrong. Burke summed up this point of view in a memorable sentence : " Small minds and a great empire go ill together." I fear some of our political business men will be impatient of this habit of mind. I know many foreign statesmen and diplomats will consider the habit deplorably amateurish. What business has a hard-working Foreign Minister to sit reading Plato like Lord Halifax, or even Wordsworth like Sir Edward Grey ? Above all what right has he to mix up his policy with con- siderations of morality ? Policy is one technique practised by statesmen ; morality is another, practised, or at least expounded and recommended, by clergymen. To confuse them is simply a trick of the well-known and detestable English hypocrisy ! It is quite possible to argue that a more professional and less amateurish - or</page><page sequence="3">April l8, I94I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 335 shall we say less " gentlemanly " ? - attitude towards politics would be more effective in serving the interests of the country. "You will always be fools and we shall never be gentlemen " is the saying attributed to a German diplomat. It may be argued that statesmen are the solicitors of the nation ; and solicitors are engaged to look after their clients' interests, not to indulge in unselfishness on their behalf or to secure them a reward in heaven. But hitherto, wisely or unwisely, the British people has not inclined to that way of looking at things. It wants a leader whom it can admire, who can appeal to its higher nature, its courage, its sense of honour, its magnanimity, its great traditions. It likes statesmen who have drunk at the eternal springs. Even short of that, I believe the English public - especially that Backbone of England represented by " the Noncomformist Conscience " - greatly prefers its political leaders to be not entirely absorbed in their politics, to have other interests, to be sportsmen like Lord Rosebery, cricketers like the Lytteltons, bird-lovers like Sir Edward Grey, or even philosophers like Mr. Balfour. To be nothing but a politician, they think, somehow turns a man stale or sour. I remember that when Mr. Neville Chamberlain was Chancellor of the Exchequer, M. Flandin, the French Minister of Finance, came over to consult with him. On his arrival Flandin opened The Times and saw that it contained a letter from Mr. Chamberlain. He eagerly turned to it and found to his bewilderment that it had nothing to do with finance. It was to say that the Chancellor had found on his lawn the previous day a particular kind of water- wagtail, that this was unusually early for that species, but that he was sure he was not mistaken. A French Finance Minister who wrote such a letter to the press, said M. Flandin, would immediately be visited by two alienists. Is this British quality or weakness at all particularly Greek ? I think it is. None of the great Greeks of the fifth century were specialists ; they were о-офос, skilled, and their о-оф[ a, skill, fed itself on the whole of /хошч/aj. " Music," or the realm of the Muses. They were фьХоо-офос, фьХбкоуоь, фсХокаХос, lovers of wisdom, lovers of words, lovers of beauty ; all the names they use seem to denote the lover, the amateur, the man who does a thing because he likes it rather than the hard-faced efficient professional. A few years ago an amiable and incredibly learned Austrian came to deliver some lectures in Oxford. He addressed our learned societies and overpowered them with the extent and minuteness of his erudition. Then he was good enough to accept an invitation to an undergraduate Classical Club, where a student was reading a paper on the poets of the Greek anthology. It was a lively meeting, and a hot argument took place, backed by quotations, between various young students about the merits of their favourite Greek poets. Our learned visitor was staggered. He said afterwards that he did not believe such a scene was possible in any other university in Europe. Our men were not at all erudite; they were only фьХбо-офос, they liked scholarship. They were фбЛо'каЛск, they cared for beauty. They happened to love Greek poetry and</page><page sequence="4">336 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April 1 8, I941 carried it about in their minds and their pockets. To a German professional scholar they would be mere amateurs, unmethodisch , almost unwissenschaftlich ; that is how we seem to like them. The anecdote illustrates the curious way in which Greek culture has soaked unconsciously into the English tradition, at least into that small but influential part of it which finds its centre in the old universities. Like the Greeks, we combine " music " with " gymnastic." We all play games as a matter of course ; a comparatively small number shoot and hunt, but everybody plays cricket, tennis, football or something similar. And we play as amateurs, for the fun of the game, not with the grim determination of one who regards the game as his life work or his means of livelihood. We play games as the Greeks played them. We are islanders and seamen, traffickers of distant seas, a nation of shopkeepers, if you like, but very adventurous shopkeepers, just as the Greeks were. We have a way of seeking our fortunes abroad and settling down on strange coasts just as the Greeks had. Perhaps some of these qualities are superficial, but there are others that go deep. Freedom, free speech, toleration, and that willing acceptance of the law which is the usual corollary to freedom, are qualities as characteristic of Britain among the nations of Europe as they were of Greece among the nations of antiquity. The causes which led to this freedom were, I think, different in the two cases ; of Greek freedom I will speak later, but our English freedom is, I believe, almost entirely the result of our long insular security, that precious possession which has been ours for centuries and which the generation now living has lost, and perhaps lost irretrievably. The great powers of Europe have lived always in danger ; they are militarist because they have armed enemies just across that imaginary line that is called a frontier ; they are despotic because they have to be militarist ; they are suspicious and * repressive towards their own people because under a despotism people are apt to be discontented and because despotisms have often for strategic reasons annexed territories inhabited by alien and hostile races. We, surrounded by our blessed barrier of sea, have been almost free from these ugly necessities. Our public life has been comparatively free from fear. Happrjo-ía , ¿Xevdepía, lo-ovopí a, Free Speech, Liberty, Equality before the Law, all the familiar Greek watchwords are our watchwords also. The International Federation of League of Nations Societies once held its annual meeting in Wales. The discussions were friendly and vigorous. And at the end the audience suddenly broke out enthusiastically into song, into Welsh song. A distinguished German statesman, now dead, who was present, clutched at the arm of a friend of mine. He suspected an outburst of Welsh nationalist sedition. " What are they singing ?" he asked. " Only ' God Save the King ' in Welsh/' was the answer. The incident perhaps illustrates in some degree the wisdom of British statesmanship, but far more it illustrates the extraordinarily happy results of prolonged insular security. We tolerate</page><page sequence="5">April 1 8, I94I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY ÙF ARTS 337 all kinds of vagaries which in Continental countries would be suppressed, not because of any special overdose of natural virtue, but because with us such things are not dangerous ; in other countries they are. Anyone who likes may mount upon a chair in Hyde Park and advocate the abolition of the monarchy or the adoption of polygamy or any other cause he likes ; anyone may listen or interrupt. A policeman in the neighbourhood will see that nobody is hurt. Some years ago a friend showed me a Russian handbook for the use of Russian exiles in England ; one of its cautions was a warning not, when in England, to kill a policeman, even if you found one alone. The populace would be against you if you did. In this odd country the police were protectors, not enemies I When Russian revolutionaries wished to be free from the dictatorship of the Czar, all they could do was to substitute the 4 4 dictatorship of the proletariat.' * In Germany, after years of struggle against the dictatorship of the Kaiser, there emerged at last the dictatorship of a political clique. An Englishman says instinctively, " Why dictatorship ? Why not freedom and law ? " and echoes of ancient Greece come back to one's mind. " There are only two ways of governing a city," says Plato, " either compulsion pr persuasion. You need a little of both, but the more persuasion and the less compulsion the better." It might be an English county councillor speaking. " Who is the Master of this land ? " asks the foreign herald in a play of Euripides. " Seek no Master here," answers the Athenian elder. " The people itself is its own master^ obedient to the law." 4 4 How can your Greeks stand up to me in battle ? " asked Xerxes, " when they are all free with no Master to compel them ? " 44 Free as they are," answered the Spartan, " they have one Master over them called the Law, whom they fear more than thy servants fear thee. And he commands them never to turn tail in battle." If European civilisation as a whole is a child of the Graeco- Roman tradition &gt; it is roughly true that at home England is Greek, in the Empire she is Roman. In the balance between compulsion and persuasion, order and freedom, the safe course and the ideally best course, the first alternative counts for most in the administration of the Empire, where there are dangers, and the second at home where things are safe. I must not be led aside into a discussion of the Roman side, the imperial side, of British civilisation. The rule of one race or nation over another is always a fearful problem. When the ruling nation is a democracy the difficulties are greater. I often remember the angry cry of Cleon in Thucydides : " It has been proved again and again that a democracy cannot govern an empire." But I am inclined to think that if under a democracy the difficulties are greater, the hopes of a successful issue are greater too. I think we may even claim that democratic Britain is the only empire known to history which has deliberately pursued the policy of training her dependencies to become independent. At home we are idealists, perhaps rather muddle-headed, rather sentimental, but still idealists. They call us hypocritical. Of course we are hypocritical ; that is a characteristic not of English human nature but of human</page><page sequence="6">338 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April l8, I94I nature itself. The human heart may not be quite what the psalmist says of it, " deceitful above all things and desperately wicked," but certainly it is terribly prone to indulge in wishful beliefs, convenient blindnesses, and self-flattering explanations. And many a man who would be sharply on his guard against the illusions of mere personal selfishness accepts almost with open arms the illusions of patriotism. We must fully admit that in Pericles' eulogy of Athenian freedom, as in Lord Baldwin's rhapsodies about England, there are a good many bubbles which might be pricked. Yet it is worth remembering that one of the first acts of the British people, when it got into power after the Reform Bill, was to tax itself £20,000,000 - a very large sum in those days - in order to set free all slaves in the British Empire. As for the alleged English " muddle-headedness,,, it seems a singularly un- Greek quality ; but does it not only mean that we are slow to make up our minds, we shrink from being positive, and like the Greeks, are extraordinarily tolerant of different opinions ? In France politicians of opposite views seldom speak to one another, but compensate for that reserve by constantly making the most lurid statements about one another. In Germany, Russia, Spain, those in power condemn those not in power to absolute silence, under pain of torture or death. In England, as in the ancient Athenian ecclesia, ó ßovXopevos аш'сгтатси, whoever wishes stands up, and people are expected to listen to their opponent's argument. In Athens, our ancient authorities tell us, the desire to hear both sides of every question amounted to a positive taste, a taste which showed itself in the high development of drama, and the invention of the philosophic dialogue. There are no mere villains in Greek tragedy - such as abound on the Elizabethan stage ; every character has his case to state, his intelligible point of view to defend. And similarly in the philosophic dialogues, no point of view is merely silly ; none so certainly wrong as not to deserve a hearing. Plato, the most characteristic of Greek philosophers, never likes to assert his own doctrine without first trying to understand the view which he thinks false. A spirit of the same kind seems to show itself in public affairs. When we observe how often in England political opponents are united by personal friend- ship, how they dine together and argue, we are reminded of that famous dinner in ancient Athens where Aristophanes, the comic poet, sat with Socrates at a friend's table till early morning discussing the nature of love - Aristophanes, who was reckoned, in public matters, to be Socrates' most dangerous enemy. Yes, at home and in peace time we Britishers, in spite of enormous external differences, are very Greek in our ways. In time of war we come even closer to the Greeks. That is inevitable. War flattens out the differences between persons and nations ; when people in thousands and millions are trying to kill you, all other interests yield to the one uniform effort not to be killed. That effort unites the civilised man and the savage. Still, even amid the general flattening out, the Greeks in many ways seem closer to us than other warring nations. The war of Athens against</page><page sequence="7">April l8, 194I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 339 Philip of Macedón is rather grim reading for us to-day. The Philippics of Demosthenes, delivered in vain to a sluggish and wishful-thinking Assembly, remind one constantly of Mr. Churchill 's " Arms and the League " speeches which so long failed to stir the Baldwin and Chamberlain Governments. The Athenian Assembly evidently hated the thought of plunging into war, just as our Parliament did, and they allowed that laudable aversion to blind them to important facts and make them forget awkward responsibilities. Also, whether by corruption or flattery or pure deceit or otherwise, Philip had provided himself with a valuable group of partisans in Athens - many of them probably honest, and therefore the more influential. The majority of the Assembly argued that there was no necessity to plunge the country into war ; Philip's proceedings and principles might not be what most Athenians approved, but he had not made war on Athens. He had not attacked any direct Athenian interest. He had got possession of one state after another, true ; but he had generally done it by threats and diplomacy, not by war. In all such states there were parties which favoured him. No doubt he had upset democracies and put in their place dictatorships dependent on Macedón. He had divided Thessaly " according to race," and so broken its power. But none of this amounted to war. He had sent troops into some states ; was that not war ? No, he always explained that he had sent them in kindness to protect the country against possible enemies. And, after all, how could Athens interfere ? In most of the countries the leaders of the anti-Philip party had been imprisoned or " beaten up," and sometimes killed. Such countries would not welcome Athenian interference. It was much fairer and wiser to try to understand Philip and appease him ; there was even the chance of persuading him to involve himself in a war against his very large neighbour to the East, the Persian Empire. " Every Sjate," cried Demosthenes, " congratulates itself on being safe while Philip destroys its neighbour. They never see that they must unite for the common security, that their only chance of security is by union, and that meantime he is growing stronger and stronger till he will be irresistible." When accused of warmongering, Philip has said : "I am at peace with all who listen to me." Was Athens to accept that claim - that peace was only to be had by obedience ? " Not all Hellas nor all the rest of the world will satisfy that man's ambition," cries Demosthenes. " He has proclaimed his contempt for religion and for justice between nations. Whatever the rest of Hellas may do," he concludes, " we at least will fight for freedom." And so at last, when it was too late, Athens girded herself to war and was beaten. There was no American arsenal then to redress the balance in support of democracy. Then there was the earlier war in the fifth century between Athens and Sparta, each with her respective allies, about which we have such abundant first-hand evidence from Thucydides and Aristophanes. Just as in 19 14 or 1939, a rich democratic sea power with a naval empire, full of interest in all forms of social, artistic and intellectual life, was pitted against a reactionary</page><page sequence="8">340 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April l8, 1941 militarist land power, which had sacrificed most of its earlier culture to stark efficiency in war. The broad similarity is obvious, and it leads to similarities in detail which are at times almost fantastic. At one time, for example, the Spartans, their blockade baffled by the Athenian command of the sea, decided to sink at sight every ship they found afloat, of whatever nationality. Admiral Tirpitz's " unrestricted submarine campaign " was evidently not entirely his own invention. The Peloponnesian War, as it is called, exhibited many of the horrors and almost all the inconveniences which are usual in war time, but what makes it seem specially familiar to us is the accident that we hear it spoken of in no less than eleven contemporary comedies. Aristophanes lived right through it and shows us how the Athenians took it : with abundant humour, apparently, with much cheerful grumbling, and almost without hatred - very like Londoners, in fact. Aristophanes himself was anti-war from the beginning ; he hates war- mongers wherever they come from, but naturallly attacks the Athenian war- mongers most. There are constant jokes about various hardships of war, about the scarcity of food, about the trade prohibitions which closed every market. The hero of one play contrives, by divine help, to establish peace and free trade for himself and his family while the rest of the world is at war. He receives a trader from Boeotia, that fat and happy land which has not been invaded, or blockaded, a man who comes laden with every kind of game " ducks, choughs, francolins, coots, wrens, divers, geese, hares, moles, hedgehogs, weasels, brocks, martins, otters and - incredible luxury - Copaic eels." Not very appetising food for the most part, but when there is nothing else to eat no doubt foxes and otters are fairly tasty. And the list ends with a real luxury - eels from Lake Copais. The sight of that beloved eel produces a burst of lyrical enthusiasm. How can Athens pay for such treasures ? She has no farm product which is not far more abundant in Boeotia ; but there is one manufactured article which will be a rarity in Boeotia while in Athens it is as common as mud - a paid informer ! Shall we call him an officer of " M.I. 5," or imagine some parallel to an oppressive Air Warden looking for lights ? They catch one informer, small but guaranteed full of vice, and post him away to Boeotia, labelled " WITH CARE," upside down. In another play an opponent of Cleon, in order to interrupt a debate in the Assembly, announces that a shoal of sardines has arrived off the cost of the Piraeus. In a half-starved city that is more exciting news than any reports from the front. The whole assembly rushes to the harbour and the Minister of War is left addressing empty benches. Even hunger can be a joke ; yet it is a joke through which there sometimes shows a gleam of tragedy. A boy in one play is to have a prize. His father promises him a nice set of knuckle-bones to play with. But he does not so much want to play ; he wants to eat. Could he have some figs ? " Nonsense," says his father, " how can I buy figs ? I have only my pay to buy bread and firewood</page><page sequence="9">April l8, 194I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 34I for the three of us." And the boy cries. But the famine had grimmer depths than that. Megara was really starved, and starved by the deliberate policy of Athens. Aristophanes gives us a scene where a Megarian farmer tries to sell his two daughters in a sack, pretending that they are pigs ; sheer farce of course, but farce with tears of pity in its eyes. The scene ends in giving them all a good feed, the sort of feed that everyone could have if it were not for this stupid war ! Fuel, too, was a constant difficulty. Oil was precious, every drop of it. It was hard to buy wood. A man who sees a whole sack of charcoal rushes to embrace it like a lover. Then debts and reluctance to pay them and what we should call overdrafts, were a universal joke ; and almost more universal, as was suggested above, the nuisance of the informers. Though they had no motor cars and no blackouts, there seem to have been innumerable ways of breaking small regulations and getting yourself fined. And of course there was the evacuation of exposed places and the fearful overcrowding of the town of Athens, with refugees camped on every bit of open ground and sleeping in every cave or hut or sentry-box or cellar. The authorities expected it would lead to an epidemic ; and sure enough it did. It led to the great plague. And I confess that on that one subject I find no jokes in comedy. Aristophanes was a bold and determined opponent of the war. It is astonishing that he should have dared to speak so freely against it, and still more astonishing that, except for one violent brush with Cleon, he was allowed to do so. The normal man has, I think, mixed feelings about war. He hates war, but he admires the soldier. It is senseless and brutal for men to spend all their powers in killing and hurting one another ; yet it is a splendid thing to face wounds and death for one's country. The Greeks certainly had both feelings. They were without doubt very fine soldiers. Not without reason has " Marathon become a magic word," and Thermopylae, the lost battle, a word of even greater magic. Later on the Greeks were the crack professional mercenaries of the Mediterranean. They fought as their descendants are now fighting, with the same skill as well as the same heroism. Yet here again the Athenians have a likeness to our modern Western democracies. Savage peoples often fight well, Maoris and Zulus and of course Nazis, who purposely make themselves savage. But savages like war and live for it, as the Spartans did. The Greeks as a whole honoured the soldier but certainly they hated war. They loved beauty and freedom and human learning and the eternal effort to build " a good life for man," and war is the negation of all these things. Even in Homer the War-god, Ares, is hated and despised by the rest of the Olympians. He is the only god who is a bit of a coward and a bully. The earliest of the tragedians, Aeschylus, who fought at Marathon, had himself seen some savage conquests. He prays, " May I never be a Sacker of Cities," - using the particular title of honour тгтоХстгорвоъ which was reserved for military glory at its highest and cruelest,- " nor yet be the captive in a conqueror's hands." Euripides, the latest of them, has left us in his Trojan Women , a drama which is perhaps the most tragic denunciation</page><page sequence="10">342 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April l8, I94I of war in European literature, war when the fighting is over and nothing remains but to wait and think. As we of the British Commonwealth fight our great battle to-day, we might well take as one of our mottoes the word of Aristotle : "We make war that we may live in peace," and add to it a war cry used by the present Greek armies, " For the victory of all men ! " War was fierce in ancient times because life itself was hard. Close outside the civilised area of ancient Greece there were vast tracks of barbarism ; and close behind it lay the memory of a heroic age or Time of Troubles in which the old Minoan civilisation, centred in Crete, was broken down by invading nomads and pirates. What a tale is told by the existence of an old proverb like, " A fool is he who kills the father and spares the sons." It speaks of a time when the blood feud was the only law. Even in the height of Athenian civilisation the long strain of the Peloponnesian War led to savage reprisals and atrocities disguised as precautions. We should remember that our record is probably misleading - the facts true but the proportion wrong. History, as Gibbon warns us, is mostly a record of " the crimes, disasters and follies of mankind." When there is no crime, disaster or folly to write about, the Muse is mostly uninterested. Like a modern newspaper, history records what is exceptional, the breach of custom, the thing that shocks, and thereby gives things in false ratio. It is not the occasional outbreak that is characteristic of Greece ; it is the Law, the N o/xoç, the Moderation, the 2 мфросгшг 7, against which such outbreaks are offences. For example, after the capture of Plataea the Spartans put their prisoners of war to death, apparently on the ground that in taking the side of Athens against Thebes they had committed high treason against their native Boeotia. But all Greece was shocked. The Plataeans' claim is plain : " We surrendered, and it is the universal Greek law that those who surrender must not be put to death." The incident is treated by Thucydides as one of the special horrors on which he comments in iii 82ÎÏ. In Euripides' Heraclidœ 86off, the deeply wronged Alcmena proposes to kill the cruel enemy of her children, Eurystheus, but is at once forbidden. It is against the law of Athens. " What, do they not kill their enemies ?" " Not any whom they have taken alive in battle." When the raging old queen insists, the answer is firm. " No man living shall kill this prisoner." A passage in Diodorus xiii, 28, is interesting. The Syracusan Nicolaus pleads the cause of the Athenian prisoners. He states the law of Hellas, and continues : " But, you will say, certain of the Greeks have, as a matter of fact, on certain occasions killed their prisoners. What then ? If they are praised for it, good ; let us imitate them. But if you yourselves are the first to condemn them, you cannot do the same." No less strongly forbidden was any mishandling of a dead body, or any offering of insult to a fallen foe. The famous line of Odysseus in the Odyssêy , * Unholy is the voice of loud thanksgiving over slaughtered men," marked his refusal to exult over enemies who had done him unforgettable wrongs. And</page><page sequence="11">April 1 8, I94I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 343 it represents the dominant feeling of classical Greece. One may think of the tone of Aeschylus' Persae towards a brave conquered enemy - intense relief and thankfulness, but not a word of insult. Or again one may think of the strange scene in Euripides' Electra 900ÎÏ., where the dead body of Aegisthus is brought on, and that morbid heroine, embittered by long years of suffering, longs to do the forbidden thing, veKpovs vßpifav, to insult the dead. There is none to prevent her ; she tries to utter the insults and finds that she cannot. One cannot but contrast with this attitude of mind the practice of the Roman triumph, in which, amid every possible sign of glory and exultation, the captives were dragged in bonds behind the conqueror's chariot up to the Capitoline Hill, whence the leaders were taken down to the Mamertine prison and strangled. Still fiercer was the Hebrew custom. Saul was actually rejected from the Kingship because he had not killed the captive Agag ; Samuel in cold blood remedied the omission (1 Sam. xv). David, after taking Moab, killed two out of every three prisoners ; after conquering Ammon he put " all the children of Ammon under saws, axes of iron, harrows of iron and made them pass through the brick-kiln " (2 Sam. viii. 2). As for the Assyrian practice with their prisoners of war, one need merely glance at the long rows of reliefs in the British Museum and their descriptions in the Guide Book. " Troops of prisoners, piles of heads, tortures, etc.", is one entry; another, "Military operations connected with a siege, the impaling of prisoners, etc." " The slaughterers of the prisoners offering decapitated heads to the musicians and bowmen." " Asshur-bani-pal receiving the Armenian ambassadors ; officers pointing out to them the tortures inflicted on the Elamite prisoners." The Egyptian records are less ferocious, but come nowhere near the humanity of the Greek. Even more significant of a moral feeling far above the average of antiquity or the Middle Ages was the Greek custom of marking the site of a victory by a trophy and nothing more. A trophy was a plain wooden cross with a suit of captured armour on it. And by Greek law it must be made of wood only, not of stone or metal ; it must never be repaired by the conqueror nor yet pulled down by the conquered. It must simply be allowed to fall to pieces and disappear as the memory of the old strife disappeared. The reason is given in several passages. "It is the law," says Nicolaus in Diodorus, " to set up trophies not of stone but of ordinary pieces of wood. It is well to prese rve for ever the good will we feel towards our friends, but to let our hatred of our opponents die " (Diod. xiii, 24). Plutarch discusses the reason why trophies alone of all offerings to the gods are never repaired. " It would be invidious and malignant that we men should ourselves repair and renew the monuments of hatred towards our enemies: when time is making them dim " ( Aet . Rom. 37). Cicero has a story that the Thebans after the victory of Leuctra set up a bronze trophy over the Spartans, and were accused before the Amphictyonic Council of breaking the law and erecting " acternum inimicitiarum monumentum."</page><page sequence="12">344 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April l8, I94I (De Invent. XXIII.) The trial is probably fictitious but it shows that the law was recognised. This essential humanity or moral sensitiveness in Hellenic civilisation is shown by another crucial test. When gladiatorial games, already the chief delight of the Roman mob, began to spread through the cities of the empire, they found resistance only in Greece. Despised by Cicero, reprobated by Seneca as a sign of " morum perver sitas " this hideous form of entertainment spread like wildfire among the dregs of the subject populations and magistrates who wished to imitate Rome. Antiochus Epiphanes, for instance, introduced the games, Muñera , as they were called, in Syria but found that his people hated the bloodshed. He contrived, however, gradually to lead them to a more masculine and Roman attitude by first stopping the battles at the first shedding of blood, and later letting them go on to the death. At Corinth they did get a footing. At Athens a proposal was made to introduce them, but Demonax the Cynic moved an amendment that before admitting gladiators they should " tear down the altar of Pity in the market place." That settled it ! • The references to the Muñera not merely in philosophers, but in writers like Plutarch and Lucian, are all in the same tone. The whole thing is OrjpmSes ка! Setvm o-naíov , " bestial and horribly perverse." The magistrates who provide such shows Srjfxayuiyovo-L fiâXXov 8* fio к оттого- 1, " are demagogues or rather deceivers of the people " ; " such things are like the tricks of a prostitute to inveigle the mob." " Drive them out of the city," cries Plutarch, " or, if that is impossible, shun them and fight against the mob which demands them." It is a grim indication of the tastes that develop like ill weeds in unregenerate human nature to see how spectacles of mere blood and torture - fights, executions, tortures of heretics, autos da fé - almost always have attracted crowds of spectators, almost always, but not in classical Greece. Humanity, or as they called it, то &lt;¡&gt;i'áv6ptúTrov, love of humanity, remains a central characteristic of Hellenism. If one looks for the cause of this humanity, it is worth observing that the Greeks themselves connected it with the freedom of their institutions. Cruel punishments, beheadings, mutilations, tortures, are things that belong to barbarian countries, especially to the despot-ridden East. In the Eumenides of ^schylus Apollo drives the Furies away from his temple into barbaric lands : This floor shall be no harbour to your feet. Are there not realms where Law upon her seat Smites living head from trunk ? Where prisoners bleed From gougéd eyes ? Children with manhood's seed Blasted are there ; maimed foot and severed hand ; And stonings ; and a moan through all the land Of men impaled to die. And it seems true that there is a definite connection between despotism and cruelty, as between freedom and regard for the human person. One of the most</page><page sequence="13">April l8, 1941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 345 obvious differences between Hellenic civilisation and the other great civilisations of antiquity is that in Greece there was no divine Great King, such as there was in the Babylonian and Egyptian and even the Roman Empires. For one thing, Greek city states were all on a small scale and surrounded by neighbours of more or less equal importance. For another, Greek potentates are always sharply - and to our minds almost monotonously - warned that they are not gods and will only get into trouble if they imagine they are. They must not put up megalomaniac inscriptions to their own glory. They must not expect people to kiss the earth on entering their presence or to walk backwards on leaving it. They must not expect to have concubines and attendants sacrificed on their tombs. They must not amuse themselves by tormenting their subjects. The law is always above them. The gods are jealous when mortals become too proud ; and Hubris brings its sure punishment. It is significant that even in the somewhat debased Hellenism which spread through Asia under the Seleucid Empire a sharp difference was made between the towns, which had Greek law, and the countryside, which lived in the oriental tradition. If an offence against the King was committed in the country, the offender was apt to be drowned or burnt or sown up in a sack, and his wife and children with him, without further waste of time ; if in a city, the King had to plead in court and obtain a conviction before the offender could be sentenced, and the penalty even there was in accordance with Greek law, admitting no tortures or fantastic forms of death. Just as there was no divine king, there was also no authoritative and over- mastering system of religion. Religious fanaticism was quite unknown ; and that, next to despotism, is perhaps the most dangerous source of man's in- humanity to man. There was no orthodoxy, no uniform body of taboos and rules of behaviour, such as we find for instance in the Book of Leviticus or the Laws of Hammurabi, and such as are normally found in almost all primitive tribes. As Greece became more of a conscious unity, there grew up a certain fairly uniform undogmatic piety, which might be directed towards the major Olympians or to some local deity or to some particular Healer or Saviour which the individual chose, or merely to God or The Divine, unnamed and undefined. Every small community inherited its own gods ; if you travelled into strange countries it was well to pay some attention to the gods of the place and observe the peculiarities of their worship. Otherwise choice was fairly free. There was no persecution until the classical Greek atmosphere had long passed away. Individuals were even free to reject the canonical legends, like Hecataeus who began his history, " 1 write as seems to me true, for the legends of the Greeks are contradictory and absurd (7 roAAot ка1 yeAoîot), like Xenophanes, the philosophic rhapsode, who rejected all the anthropomorphic gods and their too human adventures, remarking that if cattle or lions had gods, they would probably have the shape of cattle or lions. The spirit of discovery, the search for truth, was a stronger feeling and a more effective force than either</page><page sequence="14">346 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April l8, 194I the fear that dreads the supposed effects of unorthodoxy or the narrowness that cannot bear contradiction. I have spoken to you for nearly an hour, mentioning point after point that seemed to me interesting or characteristic in that small shining island of human achievement which we call Hellenism. Yet I seem to have said nothing of the qualities and doings that have chiefly made the fame of ancient Greece and left the deepest mark upon the world. To many students ancient Greece really means Greek art. They think of the builders of the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, of the reliefs at Olympia, of those priceless marbles brought by Lord Elgin to the British Museum, and now waiting hidden under piles of sandbags while the bombers come and pass. Most of my fellow scholars at Oxford think chiefly of Greek philosophy, of Plato and Aristotle, those still unexhausted treasure houses of luminous thought, of Epictetus and Marcus and Epicurus, still helpful as guides to life. For my own part, Greece to me means chiefly Greek poetry in all its wide variety, Homer, Euripides, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Sappho, and all that great company long since departed whose words have still the magic secret of beauty. I remember, twenty or thirty years ago, poring in the Laurentian library at Florence over a MS. that was blurred and hard to read and troublesome, until suddenly I caught the opening words of a lovely lyric that I had long known : Avpa ttovtlcls avpa, " Wind, wind of the deep sea . . when the walls of the library seemed to disappear and that poet, dead for two thousand years, spoke straight and unhindered to my heart. I have said nothing, or almost nothing, of all these sides of Greek culture, the sides that are most living and that stir the imagination most. I have dwelt by preference upon aspects that are less widely known. My purpose, of course, was not to give a complete description of ancient Athenian life - a task far beyond my powers - but to call attention to some similarities between the ancient Greek and the modern English attitude to life, similarities due partly to our traditional study of Greek letters, partly to geographical and historical facts. The differences no doubt are greater than the similarities, and in any case it is rash to interpret confidently the fragmentary evidence about ancient Greece, or even Athens, that has come down to us. The picture one makes of it is very incomplete. An impression comes to us of external conditions, rude and almost primitive, of pervading beauty, of amazing intellectual power and unexampled spiritual energy, but the impression is surrounded by great silences and void spaces, which a man fills up out of his own imagination by conjecture and historical analogy. In my own mental picture I do not doubt that there may be an element of illusion, the sort of illusion that is inseparable from love and sometimes reveals a truth that only love can see. The Chairman said : In expressing our thanks to Sir John Forsdyke, who has been kind enough to read Professor Gilbert Murray's lecture, I would propose that a</page><page sequence="15">April l8, I941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 347 message of sympathy be sent to Professor Murray with our thanks and also our best wishes. It is a good thing for civilisation that Greek letters and culture found under the hospitable roof of the English universities the fertile soil favourable to their fruition, inspired teachers able and ready to rear the youth, and pupils worthy of their masters. These all helped to revive Hellenic civilisation, and to-day the British can pride themselves with justice, as did the Athenians of old, on living under a Constitution such as in no way causes them to envy the laws of their neighbours, for they are themselves an example to others rather than mere imitators. We also, the Greeks of to-day, look with pride to the British Empire, which gives us a living picture of the classical age of Greece. If to-day the Greeks, small nation though we are, have embarked upon a struggle which is on behalf of all as well as in defence of our independence and freedom, this is a vindication of our old traditions, and it is only logical and natural that in such a struggle we should find ourselves in the same camp with you, fighting for the same ideals. Professor Gilbert Murray, who throughout his life has by his works done his best to promote and propagate the ideals of Hellenic civilisation, has by this lucid lecture given the measure of the greatness of ancient Greece, but in so doing he has at the same time paid a fair tribute to his own country with which we are fighting to-day. Sir Edward Crowe, K.C.M.G., in seconding the vote of thanks, said : It has been particularly fascinating to have new light thrown on many of the points which showT similarities between ancient Greek days and the present situation. Professor Murray has shown us that there is nothing new under the sun, and that many of the events which are featured in to-day's papers used to arouse the interest of the inhabitants of Ancient Greece. The vote was put to the meeting and passed with acclamation. Sir Atul Chatterjee, G.C.I.E., K. C.S.I. (Chairman of the Council), proposed a vote of thanks to His Excellency the Greek Minister, which, having been passed with enthusiasm, the meeting terminated.</page></plain_text>
