Yet Veblen's version of social rationality has never been adequately examined using the conceptual and taxonomic apparatus of contemporary European theory, although he dealt with it not only in The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) but in more detail in The 7heory of Business Enterprise (1904).1 However, Veblen did not actually use the term "social rationality," and he never wrote a formal treatise as such on either sociology or economics.2 For that rea- son, Weber and Mannheim, who did both, are used to interpret and deepen understand- ing of Veblen.3 All three focus on the genesis and development of social rationality and the kinds of rationality engendered or suppressed by different social forms and the cultures within which these forms are embedded. Veblen and Weber, to be sure, wrote on the role of rationality in primitive societies and ancient dynastic empires. Our focus, however, is on social rationality as it has evolved in the past and might evolve in the future in indus- trial societies within economies that have passed beyond the stage of primitive accumu- lation-in short, social orders that have at least the rudiments of modern transport, communication and exchange, and the corresponding scientific and technological base of an industrial economy.

Obviously, rational procedures emanate from rational psychological processes. If society embraces rational techniques and the findings resulting from ratio- nal processes of inquiry, knowledge, and control produce consequences that are more predictable than otherwise, overall "social rationality" may be said to have increased. Both individuals and social aggregates display it when systematic, explicit reasoning occurs, for example, as when rationality is linked with symbolic transformation. The log- ical structure of the mind, as a functional entity, is thus organizable into a coherent sys- tem in which (1) beliefs or sets of beliefs are logical or consistent because they rely on valid inferences, that is, they are based on sufficient evidence meaning relevant consid- erations which in principle are falsifiable, (2) goal-directed action exists in which an action is said to be maximally rational if what is in fact the adaptation of the most effi- cient means is used to achieve a given end, and (3) the agents' ends are the ends they ought to have in the sense that each individual seeks what is in his or her interest accord- ing to some specified set of values. "Rationality" thus means believing what is empiri- cally or demonstrably true, means-ends congruency and understanding one's own best interests given certain value premises. Given these definitions of rationality, "irrational- ity" would signify the flip side of the coin, that is, (1) beliefs that do not rest on valid inferences or sufficient evidence, (2) action which is not maximally rational because the means relied on are not congruent with the ends sought, and (3) the ends the agent seeks not in his or her own best interest as defined by particular normative assumptions. The fact that Mannheim, and especially Weber, have a more complex and elusive para- digm for rationality does not preclude using a simpler and less opaque taxonomy for explicating the meaning of social rationality in Veblen. In any case, probably any typology of rationality useful in social science inquiry would have to encapsulate at least these three usages of "rationality" and "irrationality."4 European critics, the Frankfurt School in particular, attack Veblen's claims regard- ing machine-induced rationality in industrial society.5 Their attacks stem in part from the fact that Veblen did not use the concepts or jargon familiar to the leading Continen- tal thinkers. This article thus attempts to (a) demonstrate through textual exegesis the meaning of social rationality in the corpus of Veblen's writing, (b) show how European sociology can be used to illuminate and critique Veblen's theory; parts of the taxonomy of rationality employed by Mannheim and Weber, respectively, are used to explicate its meaning and significance, and (c) utilize the insights of the two Europeans, as well as Veblen's own thought, to clarify the meaning of the progress or decline of social rationality in his Darwinian view of the future. One caveat at the outset: This article is not about either Mannheim or Weber except insofar as some of their ideas about rationality are helpful in explicating, clarify- ing, and critiquing Veblen's on the same subject. It is the problem of social rationality in Veblen that is its focus and the two Europeans are used only when their ideas are ger- mane to a better understanding of him. Clearly, Weber in particular had a more elabo-</page><page sequence="3">Mannheim, Weber, and the Problem of Social Rationality in Veblen 157 rate and complex conceptualization of rationality than can be used effectively here. To illustrate, the author focuses on two types of rational social action in Weber's work but will use only sparingly his broader typology of rationality. The same will be the case with Mannheim, whose ideas about rationality changed over time as in Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction (1940), where he used concepts other than functional and substan- tial rationality such as "self-rationalization" and "self-observation." In short, only con- cepts developed by Weber and Mannheim which are of direct and immediate use in understanding and criticizing Veblen's machine- and science-induced rationality are sys- tematically used here. But it is essential to understand what he argued was occurring and how he qualified his argument before considering the European analysis of his claims about the relationship between the machine process and social rationality. Veblen on Social Rationality as Induced by the Machine Process The most explicit source of Veblen's analysis of rationality is chapter 9, "The Cul- tural Incidence of the Machine Process," in The Theory of Business Enterprise. Textual exe- gesis of it shows illuminating points of comparison with regard to European sociology. Without specifically mentioning them as such, Veblen conflated, discarded, and added substantive meaning and value to the ideas of rationality held by European sociologists. First is Veblen's view of the impact of the "machine process" on the worker's psyche: Mechanically speaking, the machine is not his to do with as his fancy may sug- gest. His place is to take thought of the machine and its work in terms given him by the process that is going forward. His thinking in the premises is reduced to standard units of gauge and grade. If he fails of the precise measure, by more or less, the exigencies of the process check the aberration and drive home the abso- lute need of conformity.... The machine process is a severe and insistent disci- plinarian in point of intelligence. It requires close and unremitting thought, but it is thought which runs in standard terms of quantitative precision.6 Veblen, then, carefully qualified his thesis in these terms: Of course, in no case and with no class does the discipline of the machine pro- cess mould the habits of life and of thought fully in its own image. There is pres- ent in the human nature of all classes too large a residue of the propensities and aptitudes carried over from the past and working to a different result. The machine's regime has been of too short duration, strict as its discipline may be, and the body of inherited traits and traditions is too comprehensive and consis- tent to admit of anything more than a remote approach to such a consumma- tion.7 It is important to keep these qualifications in mind because Veblen's critics often over- looked his focus on cultural and institutional impediments to machine-induced rational-</page><page sequence="4">158 Rick Tilman ity and mistakenly portrayed him as a technological reductionist whose work had a monocausal thrust.8 Veblen also advanced another important and influential thesis on the effects of the machine process on the human psyche-especially that of the industrial worker. He argued that the machine process provides no illumination into issues of morality, law, or politics except in terms of material causation. Machine technology is best understood in terms of pressure, temperature, velocity, and tensile strength; therefore metaphysics, manners, breeding, and ancient custom are irrelevant to a grasp of its functioning.9 The impact of machine technology produces a worker whose psychology is icono- clastic in attitudinal response toward property, hierarchy, authority, religious belief, and conventional morality.10 The changes in values and attitude induced by the machine process among industrial workers foster a new kind of critical intelligence (social ratio- nality) among them. In fact, Veblen argued that the labor force is becoming increasingly skeptical regarding the rights of large property owners as to power and ownership; indeed, the more radical elements among the wage earners questioned whether corpo- rate property rights should be honored at all.1" Yet Veblen again carefully qualified his argument and cautioned that [i]n the light of this consideration, then, it is to be noted: (1) that the domi- nance of the machine process in modern industry is not so potent a factor for the inculcation of socialistic notions-it does not so irresistibly shape men's habit of mind in the socialistic sense-as the first survey of the facts would sug- gest; and (2) that the differentiation of occupations involved in modern indus- trial methods selectively bunches the socialistic elements together, and so heightens their sense of class solidarity and acts to accentuate their bias, gives consistency to their ideals, and induces that boldness of conviction and action which is to be had only in a compact body of men.12 One outcome of all this, however, is that class conflict ensues between the new industrial working class under pressure from the machine process which is reworking its psyche and changing its substantive values, on one hand, and classes with a strong pecu- niary tradition, on the other.13 As Veblen put it, the clash is between those whose "thinking on all topics is more consistently held to tests of authenticity as contrasted with tests of sense perception."14 It is clear too, that "the metaphysics of materialistic sci- ence," as he liked to call it, is more likely fostered among industrial workers and men of science than among the business and professional classes. As he put it: But that work of research which effectually extends the borders of scientific knowledge is nearly all done under the guidance of highly impersonal, mechan- ical, morally and aesthetically colorless conceptions of causal sequence. And this scientific work is carried out only in those communities which are in due contact with the modern mechanically organized industrial system,-only under the shadow of the machine technology. 15</page><page sequence="5">Mannheim, Weber, and the Problem of Social Rationality in Veblen 159 Finally, he defined still further the nature of this perspective when he wrote that they are of the "metaphysical assumptions of modern material science"-the law of cause and effect, cumulative causation, conservation of energy, persistence of quan- tity, or whatever phrase be chosen to cover the concept. The men occupied with the modern material sciences are, accordingly, for the purpose in hand, in somewhat the same case as the higher ranks of those employed in mechanical industry. . . . The characteristically modern science does not inquire about prime causes, design in nature, desirability of effects, ultimate results, or escha- tological consequences.16 Veblen also wrote, perhaps tongue in cheek, that [flor something more than a hundred years past this change in the habits of thought of the workman has been commonly spoken of as a deterioration or numbing of his intelligence. But that seems too sweeping a characterization of the exchange brought on by habituation to machine work. It is safe to say that such habituation brings a change in the workman's habits of thought,-in the direction, method, and content of his thinking,-heightening his intelligence for some purposes and lowering it for certain others.17 He claimed once more that certain traits of mind are bred out of the labor force, and oth- ers bred in, by the machine process. This signifies that the days of the following ideational proclivities are numbered: animism, anthropomorphism, teleology, natural law, and related aspects of religious dogma and belief; belief in inherited property and social status; inequalities of wealth and power not linked with the functional imperatives of modern industry; and so forth. It is evident, then, that Veblen's "industrial republic," if and when it emerges, will be characterized by certain kinds of social rationality and these include a secular, matter-of-fact state of mind increasingly empirical in its focus and skeptical about the received wisdom and social convention that buttresses the existing system. Veblen never closely defined his "industrial republic," which suggests that it had vaguely utopian structures; nevertheless, his occasional references to the desirability of "an ungraded commonwealth of masterless men" lead to the conclusion that even though the Darwinian evolutionary process can arrive at no predesignated end, this is what Veblen would enact if he were sovereign. In Veblen's view such ends are inextrica- bly bound up with the mass fostering or, at least, enhancement by machine technology of "idle curiosity" (critical intelligence), the "parental bent" (altruism), and the "instinct of workmanship" (proficiency and pride in craftsmanship). What may lie ahead in his sce- nario of an industrial republic is the large-scale realization of the values and ethos of sci- ence, community, and craftsmanship.18 It is an analysis of the values and ethos of science and their relationship to machine-induced rationality in Veblen's theory that follows.</page><page sequence="6">160 Rick Tilman Veblen on Social Rationality as Induced by Science The classic text for analyzing Veblen's interpretation of the nature and function of science is "The Place of Science in Modern Civilization," first published in 1906. In it he lays out his most detailed interpretation starting with a simple yet penetrating defini- tion of it as "impersonal, dispassionate insight into the material facts with which man- kind has to deal."19 It is this which gives Western industrial societies an advantage over the less developed countries. As he put it, "a civilization which is dominated by this mat- ter-of-fact insight must prevail against any cultural scheme that lacks this element."20 However, Veblen did not accept the exaggerated claims made for science by scientistic cults, for his own claims for science were more modest. Indeed, he differenti- ated between the use of science on one hand and more "pragmatic" forms of inquiry on the other hand. In the modern scheme of knowledge it holds true... that training in divinity, in law, and in the related branches of diplomacy, business tactics, military affairs, and political theory, is alien to the skeptical scientific spirit and subversive of it.21 Indeed, Veblen's skepticism regarding these branches of learning as they existed in his own day was, perhaps, more extreme than his rejection of the received economic theoret- ical wisdom of his time for they were at best merely a form of pragmatic knowledge, not a kind of scientific inquiry. Veblen's objections to several branches of learning of his day including jurisprudence, economics, and political science are as follows: Either they are infected with Hegelianism with its emphasis on the fulfillment of reason in history, or they are contaminated with the crudely pragmatic and utilitarian aims of vested interests. Or they contain heavy residues of natural law with its focus on final cause guiding the development of both individuals and groups toward their appointed telos, or end. All these, in Veblen's view, are manifestations of the nonscientific status, that is, pre-Darwin- ian state of development of these disciplines. All but the most arbitrary reading of his essay on the place of science in modern civilization indicates his belief that until the study of these branches of learning becomes genuinely scientific, they will have little predictive or explanatory power. The spread of science and the advance of scientific method in the scientific commu- nity are interpreted by Veblen to be convergent with diffusion of the machine-induced rationality generally found among blue-collar workers and, more selectively, among white-collar workers. It is important to note, however, that he is careful to qualify his claims about the advance of science even in the professoriate by pointing to the likeli- hood of institutional resistance to its dissemination as well as its contamination by exist- ing atavistic or obsolescent ideological trends. Science-induced and machine-induced rationality thus closely paralleled each other qualitatively,22 but the spread of these simi- lar forms of social rationality was impeded by anachronistic structural obstacles such as</page><page sequence="7">Mannheim, Weber, and the Problem of Social Rationality in Veblen 161 emulatory consumption, absentee ownership, hyper-patriotism, and religious superstition. Enter Max Weber Max Weber had complementary insights which help illuminate Veblen's views on the genesis and nature of social rationality. Before turning to them, however, a few cau- tionary words are in order. Unlike Weber, Veblen did not believe that capitalism epito- mizes rationality; indeed, his dislike for business irrationality caused him to articulate one of his most flamboyant oxymorons, to describe the "astute mismanagement" of industry by business.23 His insistence on the irrationality of modern business should not, however, be disregarded as mere satire or mockery for his position nevertheless complements Weber's influential theory of the motivation of capitalists set forth in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Weber's claim that the "spirit of capitalism" reflects the Calvinist idea of a predes- tined "calling" for the elect leads to his view that modern business is characterized by its rationalization. This is to say that Weber contrasted pre-modern business as "irrational" work, "directed to acquisition by force, above all the acquisition of booty," with the pen- chant of modern business for rational "calculation of capital in terms of money.... Everything is done in terms of balances."24 Veblen's argument regarding the irrational- ity of modern business does not simply contradict Weber's view, for what Weber meant by "rationality" has more to do with what Veblen called "pecuniary accountancy," or the flattening of all evaluation to numbers, than with irrationality itself. Veblen also sug- gested that what Weber perceives as the rational calculation of interest actually cloaks a profound irrationalism; this is because in Veblen's view, other standards, such as ser- viceability, productivity, and usefulness to the larger community, offer better ways to measure value than does the pecuniary calculus. In short, Veblen suggested that the allegedly rational reduction of value to numerical values is in fact "businesslike imbecil- ity."25 His characterization of modern business as destructive and predatory is thus the reverse of Weber's claim regarding the peaceful, rational nature of modern business. In Weber's sociology there are four types of social action; however, two of these contribute most directly to clarification of Veblen's ideas regarding social rationality. To Weber, zweckrational was basically expedient rationality that indicated a system of action whereby the actor weighed the alternative ends and means open to them in terms of his or her goals and chose the course of action most appropriate for him or her. A system of particular ends existed for the actor, but before action was taken to achieve them, the likely costs and consequences must be taken into consideration. In Weber's analysis, wertrational was distinguishable from zweckrational because the incorporation of an "absolute value" eliminated the possibility of the actor's choosing alternative ends, and ultimately, therefore, also barred the possible choice of certain means. The only impor-</page><page sequence="8">162 Rick Tilman tant consideration of the actor was the realization of the cherished value be it ethical, aesthetic, religious, or otherwise.26 Weber Continued: 'Transfer Effects" or Not? Altogether, Weber used four types of rationality that enhance the meaning of Veblen's machine-induced rationality. First, his "practical rationality" accepts the reali- ties of everyday existence and calculates the most expedient means of coping with the difficulties it offers. It thus suggests a purely adaptive subordination of individuals to cir- cumstances and a tendency to avoid behavior that transcends daily routine. Clearly, the imperatives of the industrial economy and its corollary, machine-induced rationality, rests on such rationality if the system is to function effectively. Second, Weber's "theo- retical rationality" is also relevant to understanding the impact of the machine process on the psyche of the worker. Here Weber's focus is on such cognitive processes as logical deduction and induction, the attribution of causality, and the genesis of symbolic mean- ings. Third, his "formal rationality" (zweckrational) indicates means-ends rational calcu- lation with reference back to applied rules, laws, or regulations. Its meaning in Veblen's time in a partly or largely bureaucratized work setting is too obvious to need further elaboration. Weber's fourth category of "substantive rationality" (wertrational) directly orders action into patterns, but it does so on the basis of some value postulate. These value pos- tulates are not simply a single value but signify entire clusters of values. Veblen's machine-conditioned proletarian is clearly an exemplar of one such cluster-for he was undevout, matter of fact, increasingly unpatriotic, inclined toward collectivist-egalitar- ian values, and oriented toward the practice of workmanship, or so Veblen claimed; yet he also detected strong countervailing tendencies. It should be noted, however, that these values and their behavioral correlates are time-specific and have a particular cul- tural locus, whereas for Weber the exercise of substantive rationality may extrude values and value clusters that are enormously varied and culturally transcendent. Nevertheless, Veblen's machine-conditioned worker does exemplify a certain form of substantive rationality in the Weberian sense. In summation and synthesis, Weber's typology of rationality subsumes five impor- tant aspects of rationality which include (1) inductive inference, (2) causal attribution, (3) symbolic abstraction, (4) systematization of belief, and (5) rules of conduct, all of which play a significant role in Veblen's machine-induced rationality. In fact, the machine process cannot function effectively without inculcating the cognitive skills so essential to these aspects of rationality, or so he claims. Weber's five aspects play a key role here in clarification of the meaning of Veblen's machine-conditioned rationality in that the latter presupposes it will incorporate at least a modicum of each. To illustrate, in his analysis industrial workers interacting with machines use induction to grasp the interactive role of the machine, that is, the worker</page><page sequence="9">Mannheim, Weber, and the Problem of Social Rationality in Veblen 163 learns to both generalize and then particularize about the nature of machinery through protracted experience with industrial technology. Inductive logic thus becomes reflex- ively embedded in the worker's psyche and this can be traced to the machine process. But it does not follow that there is any direct or immediate transfer effect outside the realm of industry, a fact that Veblen failed to adequately stress.27 Causal attribution also resulted from the worker's observance of both the perfor- mance of individual machines and their concatenation with other machines both singly and in the aggregate. At the very least, the operative comes to understand the role of the boilers, pistons, and flywheels in animating heavy machines, as well as the functional relationship between the individual machines. Still, causal attributive abilities devel- oped in the mechanical sphere may not carry over directly into the realm of social causa- tion, or so his critics claimed. They also argued that it was more doubtful yet that machines induced the ability to manipulate abstract symbols except insofar as these symbolized aspects of the machine process or closely related facets of industrial experience. Still, as Veblen pointed out in The Theory of Business Enterprise, the socially valuable skills of accounting and inventory- ing also required symbolic understanding and manipulation for their practice and it was difficult to imagine an industrial process without them. It is questionable whether the machine process helped workers systematize their belief systems about anything except industrial machinery, its immediate environment, and the work habits essential to their maintenance. In short, it was difficult to see why Veblen believed that important transfer effects to other cultural and institutional realms would occur in terms of aiding workers in formulating and systematizing their belief systems. In his defense, however, he argued that both the scientist and the worker would be transformed into "finikin skeptics"; that is, agnostic, secular materialists would be the byproducts of the scientific laboratories and the machine shops. Finally, the formation and application of rules of conduct, insofar as these involve the imperatives of industrial work, have some likelihood of transfer effects. It is difficult to deny that the rules also have some impact on the need for punctuality, efficiency, and harmonious interaction in other walks of life. Schools, churches, and places of con- sumption; service outlets; and transportation facilities all required formally or infor- mally defined rules of conduct if they were to function effectively, and these rules converge with those of the industrial plant. While critics were skeptical about Veblen's views regarding the transferability to other cultural realms of (1) inductive inference and (2) causal attribution, they were even less sanguine regarding the impact of the machine process on the development of proletarian abilities to engage in (3) symbolic abstraction, (4) systemization of belief, and (5) formulation and manipulation of rules of conduct. The transfer effects of industrial technology alleged by Veblen to have a transformative impact on the worker's psyche were said by his critics to have a cultural and ideational genesis instead. Probably Weber, who is the inspiration and genesis for most of this analysis, would agree with them.</page><page sequence="10">164 Rick Tilman Veblen clearly failed with regard to transfer effects to move from hypothesizing about authenticity to demonstrations of matter-of-fact and empirical testing. Enter Karl Mannheim Karl Mannheim offered further explanation of how European social theory can be used to enhance the meaning of Veblen's ideas regarding social rationality. Mannheim distinguished between "functional" and "substantial" rationality, respectively. He wrote that "rational" in the functional or instrumental sense is so according to these two criteria: (a) Functional organization with reference to a definite goal; and (b) a conse- quent calculability when viewed from the standpoint of an observer or a third person seeking to adjust himself to it.... [Elach act is functionally rational [ifl (a) it is organized with reference to a definite goal, and (b) [ifl one can adjust oneself to it in calculating one's own actions.28 He also defined "substantial" rationality in a way that was helpful to social scientists attempting to better understand Veblen's point of view: "We understand as substan- tially rational an act of thought which reveals intelligent insight into the interrelations of events in a given situation."29 Substantial rationality thus referred to the perceptions individuals obtain of a situation, which may permit them to control it in keeping with their conscious purposes. Mannheim thus distinguished between the ability to adjust means to ends when the ends are given, or fixed, which he called "functional" rational- ity, on one hand, and designating certain ends as superior to or worse than alternative ends which, on the other hand, he called "substantial rationality." He has contrasted "functional rationality" with "substantial rationality" to the detriment of the former with what he asserts is the latter's superior development of human insight on matters of value. However, Mannheim was more given to conceptualization and analysis than he was to prescription; indeed, although hopeful that an intellectual "floating strata" might obtain privileged epistemological access to superior forms of social rationality, he was uncertain of this eventuality.30 Like Weber, he did not think social scientists qua social scientists should engage in political advocacy without explicit acknowledgment of their own political and moral orientation. Veblen, too, recognized the degree to which any kind of social science is value laden and reflective of the social position and professional aspirations of its practitioners. Even his tongue-in-cheek claims to the effect that he is dispassionately and objectively analyzing social values, institutions, and actors cannot disguise the satirical mockery in which he so often engaged. Nevertheless, by extrapolating from Mannheim, it is possible to interpret "rational- ity" in three ways relevant to its meaning in Veblen. The first, functional or instrumen- tal rationality, can be interpreted as means-ends congruence; the second, substantive</page><page sequence="11">Mannheim, Weber, and the Problem of Social Rationality in Veblen 165 rationality, signifies understanding of the relationship between alternative ends; and the third involves the substance of ends themselves as understood by Veblen. It is these ends to which I now turn. Mannheim, Veblen, and the Generic Ends of Life Veblen claimed that the human community had "generic ends of life," or as he also put it, "fullness of life" to pursue. Do these contain institutionally adaptable value con- stants? Or are they of transcultural moral and social significance for the human species throughout history and prehistory? If Veblen is properly understood, "idle curiosity," "workmanship," and the "parental bent" are not passing fancies but values embedded in the social matrix of a properly developing (meaning generically human) community. The exercise of "social rationality" properly construed must focus on the revalidation of these values as well as their implementation. Social scientists, no doubt, will continue to debate whether these values and the social processes linked to them are superior to oth- ers but still find an effective explication of them in Veblen's work. In this vein, Warren Samuels wrote that one can read The Leisure Class as a satire of the practices of conspicuous con- sumption and status emulation by the socio-economic elite, as Veblen's deni- gration of those practices for what they are, namely, situation dependent practices having no independent existence or value, despite how much they mean to certain practitioners.31 Veblen's way of valuing, then, may draw on various sources, but there were, never- theless, limits to its diversity. This was because the utilization of certain values would obstruct his method of valuation itself. One prime value of The Theory of the Leisure Class was that it was highly suggestive of the limits which must be placed on social values and evaluative processes if they were to remain conducive to "fullness of life." However adequate his formulation of ends may be judged to be, he articulated value constants, though relative to time and circumstances, which provided enduring standards by which to judge existing social values and processes. Whether these were congruent with European conceptualizations of substantive rationality or not, he was clearly more explicit than Mannheim and Weber regarding the nature and significance of values and the reasons for sanctioning certain of them. However, it is with the explication of what Veblen called the "generic ends of life, impersonally considered," that I am concerned because this is the most explicit articula- tion of value constants in his work. As indicated, these value constants included "idle curiosity," which in industrial society signified critical inquiry; the "parental bent," which meant altruism; and the "instinct of workmanship," which denoted taking pride in and obtaining gratification from the craftsmanlike performance of work. Veblen was</page><page sequence="12">166 Rick Tilman thus using transcultural standards of judgment which found their locus in his abbrevi- ated discussions of the "fuller unfolding" of the life process.32 An important statement regarding the theoretical relationship between Mannheim and Veblen which leads to a clearer understanding of the latter's views on social ratio- nality is provided by Mannheim's comments to this effect: If in analyzing the changes of recent years, people had kept in mind the distinc- tion between various types of rationality, they would have seen clearly that industrial rationalization served to increase functional rationality but that it offered far less scope for the development of substantial rationality in the sense of the capacity for independent judgement. Moreover, if the distinction between the two types of rationality which emerges from this explanation has been thought out, people would have been forced to the conclusion that func- tional rationalization is, in its very nature, bound to deprive the average individ- ual of thought, insight, and responsibility and to transfer these capacities to the individuals who direct the process of rationalization.32 And, in a footnote, Mannheim concluded: Cf. Veblen, Th. B., The Vested Interests and the Common Man ... for an exposition of a divergent interpretation of the influence of industrialization on the possibili- ties of substantial rationality (author's emphasis).34 Although Mannheim did not agree with Veblen's treatment of the relationship between functional and substantial rationality, which was to conflate them, his com- ments were helpful in understanding why. The contrast between the two was amplified by his claims that disparities of power and limited access to information are likely to strip the industrial labor force of the opportunity to develop substantial rationality, a prospect which he felt Veblen overlooked. Although Veblen did not actually use the terms "functional" or "substantive" rationality, it was evident that what the Europeans call "substantive rationality" was, in his analysis, largely machine induced; at the very least it was powerfully influenced by the machine process and could not be understood apart from the "generic ends of life" as he called them. "Substantive rationality" was thus synonymous or at least closely linked with these particular ends. In his eyes, it was not simply as Mannheim wrote "an act of thought which reveals intelligent insight into the interrelations of events in a given situation," as important as this may be for liberal intellectuals like Mannheim, whose focus was on cognitive processes. Rather, for Veblen it was a transcultural value orientation embedded in a social existence which eschewed emulatory consumption, waste, and exemption from useful labor. This exis- tence prescribed a system of social arrangements and material provisioning which enhanced the life process, and this life process was characterized by an abundance of critical intelligence, altruism, and proficiency of workmanship.</page><page sequence="13">Mannheim, Weber, and the Problem of Social Rationality in Veblen 167 Conclusion Given the complexities of meaning and usage of the term "social rationality," the reader may be willing to substitute the term "social intelligence" for it, in which case lit- tle would be lost. In any case, there were undertones of pessimism in the work of our three key figures regarding the future of social rationality in industrial society. Neverthe- less, they did not abandon hope that the industrial order might come to encapsulate both science and means-ends congruence as well as authentically humanistic values. Veblen recognized that the development of his own social value principle was part of an evolutionary process whose incompleteness would always be part of human exis- tence. However strongly he articulated and defended what he took to be the generic ends of life, he knew, staunch Darwinian that he was, that the impermanency of life con- demned to obsolescence claims of institutional immutability. If idle curiosity, altruism, and the sense of workmanship were of transcultural significance and transhistorical rel- evance, it was primarily because of their role in helping humanity avoid extinction; in short, they had adaptive and selective value greater than their opposites, Veblen's bete noire, force and fraud. Indeed, the growth and development of social rationality itself was viewed by Veblen as an integral part of the evolutionary process. Its impact on modern culture was largely the result of the expansion of science and the maturation of the machine process. While Mannheim and Weber were both interested in the genesis of social rationality, they more often found it embedded in social institutions and cultural processes other than machine-induced cognition. In fact, Veblen's conflation of functional and sub- stantive rationality and his linkage of both with overt behavior resulted in the fusion of two different forms of social rationality which, for analytical and conceptual purposes, the Europeans kept separate. Mannheim believed that the more a society is industrialized and the more progress has been made in the division of labor and the organization of a society, the greater the number of areas of human endeavor that are organized functionally-rationally. This functional rationality constrains and inhibits substantial-rational insight, which might otherwise provide critical illumination of conventional categories of thought and domi- nant sociopolitical structures. Clearly this view differs from Veblen's where machine-induced rationality encompasses both functional and substantial rationality, which he tends to fuse. Mannheim's and Weber's texts are useful for the extraction of meaning from the heterodox American economist's writing, explication which makes Veblen's ideas more intelligible to both Continental sociologists and U.S. social scientists, many of whom still find him too dense to read and too satirical to take seriously. Like many other West- ern intellectuals of his time, including Mannheim and Weber, Veblen is uncertain of what the future holds for humankind. The potential "social rationality" in store for industrial civilization thus fluctuates in his analysis depending on world events and the ability or failure of Western institutions to overcome the inertia of cultural lag and</page><page sequence="14">168 Rick Tilman opposition of the vested interests. However, Veblen does not have people "choose" the ends of life on the basis of rational selection. Although he did not deny the existence of volition or agency for individuals, the ends of life for social aggregates are a matter of an unintentional evolutionary process based on habituation. Perhaps there is in Veblen's mind's eye the acting out of a "universal notion of rationality: a self unencumbered by transient, egoistic, private and unreflective wants and desires."34 Yet he drew back from predicting such human transformation because he knew too many intervening institutional and cultural variables existed to warrant such a view for even a science and machine-induced future. Although Veblen did not sink irretrievably into the ranks of the cultural futilitarians and political pessimists a la Oswald Spengler, there was a vein of despair, even cynicism, in his last book, Absentee Ownership (1923), which was less evident in his other books.35 At this time, European social theory could, perhaps, have provided impetus for the clarification, refinement, and testing of his ideas on machine-induced rationality. Instead, its insights were largely ignored as he apparently succumbed to the view that Western, particularly American, civilization was trapped by "imbecile institutions." Considered in this light, the Veblen who emerges from this portrayal is neither a mere historical figure nor a theoretical anachronism but a thinker whose potent social theory is strengthened by an injection of European sociology 'a la Mannheim and Weber. Notes 1. Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1975) and The Theory of Business Enterprise (Clifton, N.J.: Augustus M. Kelley, 1975). Perhaps as many as four different issues in Veblen with regard to "social rationality" must be distinguished from each other. These are (1) the issue of individual rationality versus norm-guided behavior, that is, the pursuit of individual self-interest as it conflicts with other-regarding motives and action; (2) the question of the nature of the scientific point of view which is the issue of the extent to which science is "objective" versus the degree to which it is socially conditioned; (3) the issue of the linkage between the scientific viewpoint and social rationality more broadly construed; and (4) the question of whether the scientific perspective involves a change in the nature of rationality and norm-guided behavior as compared with their role in previous social forms. Although this article focuses on all four of these issues, it deals primarily with (3) and (4). 2. The most recent book-length interpretations of Veblen as a social theorist are Rick Tilman, Thorstein Veblen and His Critics, 1891-1963 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992) and The Intellectual Legacy of Thorstein Veblen: Unresolved Issues (Westport, Conn.: Green- wood Press, 1996). Also see Stephen Edgell, Veblen in Perspective: His Life and Thought (Armonk, N.Y.: M. E. Sharpe, 2001). Weber and Mannheim occasionally quoted Veblen or cited him in their published work; Veblen never reciprocated, although given his knowledge of German, it is difficult to believe he was not familiar with Weber's work. The publication of Mannheim's Ideology and Utopia in German in 1929 came too late for Veblen to have acknowledged it even in his last writing. 3. Weber's analyses of rationality are scattered and fragmented in his writings, but see Hans Gerth and C.

"Instrumental" or "functional" rationality is, of course, open to the charge that it can be used to shore up any kind of political regime. As Eduard Heimann said in a let- ter to Mannheim, "Your rationalism is not opposed to fascism, but rather, because of its reduction to the social-technical, politically neutral ... therefore supportive of the prevailing power."

Warren Samuels, "The Self.Referentiability of Veblen's Theory," Journal of Economic Issues 24 (September 1990): 714-15. Assuming that Veblen was often an advocate and a practitioner of instrumental valuation in the American pragmatic tradition, his generic ends of life are not and cannot be ends-in-themselves. Instead, although more value specific than John Dewey's ends-in-view, they must also take their place in the continuum of means-ends. Ends, however important they may be, are also means to other ends whose existence may not as yet even be recognized. As Veblen once put it: So closely in touch and so concurrent are the parental bent and the sense of work- manship in this quest of efficiency that it is commonly difficult to guess which of the two proclivities is to be credited with the larger or the leading part in any given line of conduct; although taken by and large the two are after all fairly distinct in respect of their functional content. This thorough and far-going concurrence of the two may perhaps be taken to mean that the instinct of workmanship is in the main a propensity to work out the ends which the parental bent makes worth while.

See Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, chapt. 13. Veblen often used language and concepts that are undeniably value laden. Indeed, The Theory of the Leisure Class is strewn with phrases such as conformity "to the generically human canon of efficiency for some serviceable objec- tive end" (259), "actions and conduct as conduce to the fullness of human life" (31 1), implied endorsement of "reversion to a more generic type of human character" (361), "in order to be at peace with himself the common man must be able to see in any and all human effort and human enjoyment an enhancement of life and well-being on the whole. In order to meet with unqualified approval, any economic fact must approve itself under the test of impersonal use- fulness-usefulness as seen from the point of view of the generically human" (98); the ques- tion that must be asked regarding all expenditure is "whether it serves directly to enhance human life on the whole-whether it furthers the life process taken impersonally" (99), and, finally, "this collective interest is best served by honesty, diligence, peacefulness, goodwill, and absence of self-seeking, and an habitual recognition and apprehension of causal sequence, without admixture of animistic belief and without a sense of dependence on any preternatu- ral intervention in the course of events" (227).

Veblen's The Instinct of Workmanship, chaps. 1-2, and Michael Sheehan and Rick Tilman, "A Clarification of the Concept of 'In- strumental Valuation' in Neoinstitutional Economics," Joumal of Economic Issues 26 (March 1992): 731-744. 33.
