<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pseudo-Omero e Giacomo Leopardi. Batracomiomachia e Paralipomeni. Ed. Pierpaolo Fornaro. Alessandria: Edizioni dell'Orso, 1999. The bicentennial of Leopardi's birth was the occasion for many scholars to celebrate the poet's life and work, producing an extensive bibliography of critical studies. Many have examined Leopardi in the context of European Romanticism, while others consider his oeuvre from an interdisciplinary point of view. That scholars have turned their attention to his less widely read works is yet another windfall. Such is the case for the poet's satirical poem, the Paralipomeni della Batracomiomachia, a dense and difficult work. Like all satire, Leopardi's epic fable about the war between mice and frogs targets contemporary society and, hence, references many historical figures and events. A full understanding of this poem, therefore, really does require the assistance of a guide, and Pierpaolo Fornaro has done an excellent job of elucidating the text. His substantial essay about fables, philosophy, and the history of Leopardi's interest in the pseudo-Homeric Batracomiomachia provides essential background for interpreting the Paralipomeni. Without his expertise, readers would surely underestimate the importance of the poem for Leopardi and its relationship to other works from the same period. For this reader, Fornaro offers a coherent and dis- tinctive history of the development of Leopardi's art and thought through the analysis of the fable genre. From the introduction, "Topi come noi," we learn that the Paralipomeni della Batra- comiomachia is a life's work, similar in this regard to the canti and to the Zibaldone. Leopardi first translated the Batracomiomachia as a youth in 1815, accompanied by the Discorso sopra la Batracomiomachia, in which he dispels the attribution to Homer on linguistic and philological grounds. His translation was published again in 1822 and in 1826 during the years in which he composed the Operette morali. The connections are quite evident between these works, in which Leopardi represents and analyzes the absurdities and paradoxes of the human condition, often using the fable as his preferred genre of expression. Besides evoking the timeless quality of ancient myths and their multifarious meanings, the fable, with its anthropomorphic characters, who are at once human and animalistic, demystifies the fictions and illusions we create to justify our existence. While readers will immediately note the similarities between the texts published by Fornaro, there are major differences. For one, the pseudo-Homeric poem and Leopardi's translation are much shorter in length than the Paralipomeni, begun in 1831 and pub- lished posthumously in Paris in 1842. "Paralipomeni" is a term used to refer to the his- torical books of the Sacred Scriptures, but it can also mean an erudite interpretation and reworking of another text. And, indeed, Leopardi's poem reprises the argument of the ancient version, in an even more satirical and caustic voice. Leopardi, for example, inveighs against the mice who represent contemporary Europe's ambitions of achieving</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 255 social progress. Although reminiscent of his complaint in La ginestra against "le magni- fiche sorti e progressive," Leopardi's tone is even more acerbic in the Paralipomeni. Fomaro explains the source of his bitterness: "L'uomo 6 indotto a pensare che storia e societh lo sospingano necessariamente a quella meta che sarebbe lo scopo unico dell'universo. Qui 6 il malinteso assoluto che rende tragica ogni esistenza umana; e da quel malinteso ripete, scientemente o no, qualche fondamento teorico ogni prassi politica" (58). Leopardi's polemic against Italy's own corrupt customs, but also against those of its foreign critics, is personified by the blind ambition of rodent warriors and chieftans, like Leccafondi and Rubatocchi. Modernity is quite literally, as Leopardi presaged, one big "rat race." The Paralipomeni confirms the poet's deeply pessimistic view of history and does not appear to stray far from his usual themes. So what is distinctive and particularly important about this poem? First and foremost, as Fornaro rightfully claims (115), it is Leopardi's mature autobiography, told "a sprazzi e barlumi" weaving together the different strands of works composed during the previous twenty years, and it is the "sarcastica trascrizione d'un Erlebnis che spingeva Leopardi in direzione inversa a tutta la cultura del tempo suo, rimanipolatrice degli acquisti illuministici in senso spiritualista" (115). But there is more, and it has to do with the aims of satire. The critic reminds us that in the Zibaldone (4173, 2 Aprile 1826) Leopardi writes: "A voler che uno possa esser buon comico o buon satirico, e di tutta necessith che questo tale sia, o sia stato degno di satira e di commedia, e ci6 per non poco tempo, e in queste cose medesime che egli ha da porre in riso." For Fomaro, "Nei Paralipomeni, ponendo il poeta in riso il suo lungo itinerario lirico ed intellettivo, la rimembranza si disacerbava, almeno un poco" (116). Leopardi does not exonerate himself in taking aim at others. This auto-da-fd suggest the poet's willingness to strip away all illusions, including the ones he may still harbor. Nowhere, however, do we sense in the Paralipomeni, or in his later lyric, a turn toward cynicism. Rather, what is evident is the role he gives to literature as a powerful source of consolation for humankind. We should be grateful to Pierpaolo Fornaro, not only for his insights, but also for having published the pseudo-Homeric poem, Leopardi's translation and his Discorso, and the Paralipomeni in one tome. It is a handy and erudite compendium that enables us to re-read Leopardi's poem with greater understanding and for appreciation. DARIO DEL PUPPO Trinity CollegelHartford</page></plain_text>
