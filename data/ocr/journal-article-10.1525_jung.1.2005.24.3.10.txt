Rather than scouting im- mediately for the subjects of my cityscapes, I looked at the boats  first. I did it unintentionally, without any clear idea why. For a long time I had been unaware of the boats, that is, small  wooden boats. Then, on one occasion while sketching a boat on the  beach in Fuengirola, Spain, I awoke to the subject and realized its  intrinsic value and artistic potential. In this moment the boat be- came, to me, more than just an object to render. In time, I fell un- der the spell of the boats—their organic, living quality. I came to be- lieve, as many boat lovers did and still do, that small wooden boats  possess personalities and souls. I was attracted to boats intuitively, but I wanted to know why. It  was not the fancy yachts with varnished mahogany decks and brass  fittings that piqued my interest, but the down–to–earth, wood- en workboats: rowing skiffs, dories, fishing launches, utility boats.  These are the classics of the boat family—built in the traditional  manner, usually in local beach yards or by individuals for purpos- es of fishing, hauling, and recreation—rugged and functional, with  no frills. They are still plentiful, scattered on the beaches of Spain,  the Greek Islands, and other Mediterranean countries, and, for that  matter, on all the beaches of the world. THE BOAT AS ARCHETYPE From time immemorial, boats of this kind have been indispensable  </page> <page sequence="3"> for practical use in the lives of many; they are an irrevocable part  of humanity. The list of pilots who have ferried them through myth  and history is also long and illustrious: gods and goddesses, Isis  from Egypt, Tara and Kali from India, Nahalenia from Rome, Mary  Mother of God  from Catholic countries, countless “Heroes with a  Thousand Faces,”2 Christ with his Apostles, and even dark Charon,  the ferryman to the Underworld. The basic configuration of wooden boats has not altered  for several millennia: from the early, primitive precursors of wa- ter transport—dugouts from Mesopotamia, boats made of inflat- ed or stretched hides over a wooden frame, to the reed and papy- rus Egyptian boats, to plank and frame constructions practiced in  Egypt first and passed on to the Mediterranean countries, to mod- ern boats with steam-bent ribs fitted in frames held together with  iron nails; the principles of design and construction have remained  essential, and essentially the same. Joseph Gribbons, in his beautiful  book, Wooden Boats, sets a common denominator for them: Wooden boats, are similar in many places around the world  because they have to do the same things: to slice the water, they  are pointed in front; to bear a load and be stable, they are full  and wide in the middle; and to float, they must be reasonably  watertight ... [they] represent a kernel of ancient, made–by– hand, designed–by–eye, loved–like–an–heirloom truth.3  This basic honesty of form in relation to function became a  guideline in my search for subjects to paint. I was not looking for  specialty boats, passenger carriers, or ships of war, and I chose to  exclude fiberglass and aluminum boats from my list. The simpler,  the better, I thought, and I was partial in selecting those boats that  appealed to me in their aesthetic order and in the primacy of the  oval, feminine shape. There was mystery to that shape. I used mixed media for the paintings: acrylic on handmade  Arches watercolor paper, also on rag museum board. Some pieces  were painted on gesso-prepared canvases with casein underpaint- ings. In many of these works I tried to capture the breath, or rather  the breath-holding quality of the boat as it lay, seemingly suspended  in time. In numerous paintings the boat and its reflection are inte- grated; I saw them as a single reality. The reflection of the boat be- came a psychological analogy to the hidden, “shadow” side of the  human personality. That analogy led to further questions—where  </page> <page sequence="4"> did the implicit, mythical meanings—the symbolism of the boat— come from and how had they become associated with its image? C. G. Jung pointed out that “symbols are not signs or allego- ries for something known; they seek rather to express something  that is little known or completely unknown.”4 Consequently, a probe  into such an “unknown”(as the symbolism of the boat was for me)  necessitated an inquiry into the history of the earliest formed cul- tures—civilizations such as Old Europe, Mesopotamia, and Ancient  Egypt. OLD EUROPE Very soon into my study it became obvious that the symbolism  of the boat/ship5 emanates “from the primordial era when the un- conscious was predominant and the conscious weak,”6 when myth  and lore were taken for factual reality and gods and goddesses for  granted as projections of the immutable, incomprehensible forces  of nature. In old Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Steppes of the  Ukraine, the worship of the Great Mother Goddess was practiced  for almost four thousand years. Anthropologist and author Marija  Gimbutas, in her book The Language of the Goddess, comments  on the fact that “the main theme of Goddess symbolism [was] the mastery of birth and death  and renewal of life, not only  huma  n, but all life on earth  and indeed in the whole cos- mos.”7 Professor Gimbutas has  assembled in her book some  two thousand symbolic ar- tifacts from Neolithic and  Paleolithic sites in Europe dat- ing from 7000 to 3500 BCE.  In this comprehensive glossa- ry of the period, in its imag- es and commentary, we find  numerous examples of boat/ Figure 1. Ships of Renewal 8  ship depictions from widely  dispersed locations, ranging from the Greek Islands to Northern  Europe. There are engravings of ceremonial ships on the megalithic </page> <page sequence="5"> tombs in Brittany and Ireland, Cycladic tombs dating from the third  millennium BCE on Malta, and rock carvings of  ships from the  Bronze Age in Denmark and Scandinavia, called “Ships of Renewal”  (Fig. 1). Gimbutas shows tracings of several anthropomorphic platters  dated around the third millennium BCE from the region of Syros,  near the Aegean Sea. In these artifacts the human element—the  vulva—is integrated with the image of the boat/ship into the total  design of the platter (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. Cycladic Platter, containing symbolic images of vulva with  the boat and the fish with bird’s feet on its prow.9 Why were the vulva and ship combined into one cult object?  Such a seemingly strange conflation of symbolic images, Gimbutas  explains, comes from the fact that images of female genitalia at that  time early in the ascent of man’s consciousness, were not merely “fe- male signs” ... [and] simple expression of physiology—but instead symbolize  the vulva and womb of the Goddess ... the cosmic womb of the  Goddess, the source of the waters of life ... Long before the  advent of agriculture, people were reproducing the vulva in art.  </page> <page sequence="6"> The earliest representations of female divinity were vulvas as  pars pro toto engraved on rocks during the Aurignacian period  some 30,000 years B.C.10 In another example of the linkage between boat and Goddess  cited by Marija Gimbutas on the Cycladic platters, the Goddess is  shown “in the guise of the bird of prey or fish pull[ing] the boat across  the waters”11 (Fig. 3). This could be interpreted as the Goddess act- ing as the source of movement, and becoming, consequently, the  pilot of the boat. Figure 3. Fish towing the ship.12  In the pre-patriarchic societies of Paleolithic and Neolithic  Europe, the epiphany of the Great Mother Goddess predominated  and was expressed in a system of multiple, interchangeable sym- bols. Gimbutas calls this system “aquatic symbolism” since the wa- ter represents the maternal depth and place of rebirth. Vulva, womb,  uterus, fish, bird, triangle, and V shapes belong to this category, as  does the image of the boat. The boat, like its masculine counterpart  the serpent, also stood for regeneration. Renewal and regeneration  were the credos of the Great Mother’s cult, and thus the boat imag- es inscribed on the artifacts, megalithic tombs, and burial grounds  of that period were metaphors for the transcendent energy of re- newal and eternal life. IN MESOPOTAMIA The headline for a Discovery magazine article, January 2003,  reads: “Dig Exposes Oldest Boat.” The story pertains to the rem- nants of an ancient boat unearthed in the sands of Kuwait by ar- cheologist Robert Carter and his team from University College,  </page> <page sequence="7"> London. Carter posits that the boat dates back to 7000 BCE when  present-day Kuwait and Iraq formed the region of Mesopotamia— the “land between two rivers,” the Tigris and the Euphrates. In describing his find, Carter conjectured that the boat had  been made out of bundles of reeds, waterproofed with an asphalt- like substance called bitumen, based on the evidence of impressions  left by reeds on the bitumen found on one side of the boat. Similar  reed boats from that region—flat-bottomed, crescent-shaped boats,  with an inward curving prow and stern—are pictured on cylinder  seals from the Sumerian period, circa 2112–2004 BCE.13 Figure 4. Pen and ink schematic rendering based on a photo-image  of the Mesopotamian crescent-shaped boat with a round, netlike  canopy in the center for passengers or cargo. (Medvedev-Mead14) At a later date, circa 1800 BCE, on coins and cuneiform tab- lets, the Babylonian god Sinn is depicted enthroned on a crescent  boat sailing across the night sky.15 The crescent shape of the boat  was most likely the result of the process of lashing bundles of reeds  together in the most functional way to ensure the boat’s buoyan- cy and mobility. The boat’s crescent-moon shape, deliberately or by  serendipity, also has symbolic significance. The early religion of that  region was based on lunar mythology, and the moon, in its various  phases, appears on many Mesopotamian artifacts.  The moon, associated with the darkness of the night, with  moisture and with feminine characteristics of yin, was believed to  hold fertilizing, life-giving power. Likewise, the moon could act as  a destroyer. She exerted total control over nature, determined the  course of floods and the calamities caused thereby, but she also  </page> <page sequence="8"> ensured the blessings of harvests and growth. Both disaster and  blessings were functions of her moisture-giving proclivities.  In an ancient myth of the moon, “It is repeatedly recorded,”  states Esther Harding, Jungian analyst and author of The Women’s  Mysteries, “that when the moon sent the deluge upon the earth she  also provided a means of salvation, a boat which carried the cho- sen ones of her children to a new world where they could live re- deemed lives. The boat that she provided was an ark, a crescent  moon boat.”16 Later, in the myth of Genesis,17 Jehovah gives Noah (a later ver- sion of the Babylonian moon good Nuah) specific instructions on  how to build the ark. But what does it really mean beyond the myth  and allegory? If the psychological meaning of the flood stands for  being engulfed by the irrational energy of the unconscious, then the  boat provided by the moon or built by Noah represents a rational act  and is a statement of progress out of stasis and regression. “Energy  left to itself,” contends Esther Harding, “produces only non-human  effects. Human intervention is needed to convert energy into work  through which something of value can be achieved.”18 Consequently, the boat, as a man-made object, is an example  of a conscious effort made by focused intelligence, and therefore  represents “human intervention” in the midst of nature’s chaos. The  story of the Flood and the symbolic ark appears as a recurring theme  in many early myths dealing with man’s struggle to confront unreal- ized, instinctual forces. With repetition and time, mere worship of  natural phenomena evolves into symbolic meanings that reflect the  inner life of man. In this drama, on this level, the boat–ship–ark– barqua–argha is a manifestation of consciousness that indicates the  way to human redemption. Several firsts occurred in Mesopotamia pertinent to the above- mentioned development and symbolism of the boat. In the first  chronicled myth, The Descent of Inanna, the boat as a metaphor  appears repeatedly. This myth, which is in part a love story, pre- dates the Bible by two thousand years. It is recorded in cuneiform  script (an early, if not the first, system of writing) on clay tablets  from the land of Sumer (present day Iraq) circa 3000 BCE.19 Inanna,  “Goddess of the first Civilization,” called Ishtar by the Semites, was  the Sumerians’ most enduring and popular Fertility Goddess. In  time, she became a syncretic prototype for antiquity’s long line of  moon goddesses who succeeded the earlier moon gods. </page> <page sequence="9"> Inanna was a goddess of love and fecundity. Passionate and  earthy, she ruled Sumeria and married her consort Dumuzi, a shep- herd king from Uruk. In a sensual description of their lovemaking, she  poetically refers to her genitalia (possibly the first written description  of such) as “the black boat ... my wondrous vulva.”20 The boat is also  called in the text, the “Boat of Heaven,” in its capacity as the carrier  of Inanna’s “me”—all the attributes of her personality, her royal sta- tus, and as a symbolic representative of civilization. Inanna gathered all the ‘me’ The ‘me’ was placed in the Boat of Heaven. The Boat of Heaven with the holy ‘me’ Was pushed off from the quay.21  A boat is also the vehicle to the underworld used by Inanna’s  father Enki, the god of wisdom, when he takes on humanity’s quest  to confront the unknown. He set sail; the Father set sail; Enki, the God of Wisdom, Set sail for the Underworld ... the waters of the sea Devoured the bow of his boat like wolves. The waters of the Sea struck the stern of his boat like lions.22 Perhaps the ancient Sumerians pictured Enki in a reed boat,  similar to the ancient boat found by Robert Carter in Kuwait. IN EGYPT In Egypt, the boat maintained symbolic dominance through  millennia of changing cultural paradigms. Even as religious focus  shifted from a lunar to a solar pantheon, the boat remained the ce- lestial vehicle of the gods. According to Abt and Hornung: The ship has been a popular burial feature in tombs since  predynastic times. It is a man-made construction and allows the  sun god to move safely over the water of the dark night world.  Psychologically, the ship can be understood as a symbol for a  solid mental concept based on the knowledge and experience of  the ancestors. Such a concept enables the light of consciousness  to regenerate, go through a process of renewal, in the dark and  dangerous realm of the beyond, which is today referred to as the  unconscious.23 The distinctly Egyptian form of culture begins to appear in  Naqada, a prehistoric Egyptian civilization that sprang up in Nubia  around the third millennium BCE. The Naqada period, epochs I,  </page> <page sequence="10"> II, and III, can be traced without a break to the founding of the  Egyptian state. The most remarkable artwork of the Naqada II pe- riod is the mural in the so-called “Painted Tomb” in the cemetery of  the ancient city Hierakonpolis. The mural, in the shape of a frieze, is  almost five meters long. It depicts a hunting scene, circa 3300 BCE.  The composition of the painting employs over a dozen figures and  intersperses many animals among the row of six large boats that  runs the length of the frieze. Five of these boats are sickle-shaped,  with reed cabins made of woven matting in the center. One boat is  black, with a long protruding hull. It is postulated that the significance of these boats, and their  identical portrayal on Naqada II Period ceramics of that time, were  of  “symbolic dominance” in the culture:  The most prominent pictorial subjects, however, are ships:  large, sickle-shaped boats ... emblematic standards reminiscent  of the divine standards of later times repeatedly appear, planted  upright in the boats ... The cultural atmosphere of the Naqada  II Period itself was marked by expansive dynamism, trade and  wide-ranging contacts. As an emblem of mobility, the ships  suggest this momentum ...24 The prominence of boats in the mural, which pre-dates Egypt’s  pharaonic era, foreshadows the key position the boat will hold lat- er in the rituals, funerary rites, and, in fact, the entire mythos of  Dynastic Egypt. Figure 5. Schematic pen and ink rendering of Hierakonpolis mural showing  clearly the silhouettes of the six boats. (Medevedev-Mead25) Egyptian civilization, like that of Mesopotamia, had its origin  in matriarchal mythology and moon worship, both of which pre- ceded the patriarchal, solar, Pharaonic theology. The most lasting  and important gods at that nascent period in Egyptian history were  originally moon deities: Osiris, god of the Underworld and ruler of  the dead, who carried the souls of the deceased in his moon boat  </page> <page sequence="11"> to the Isle of the Blest and immortality; Isis, his spouse and sister,  also a moon goddess; and their son Horus, who represented the ev- erborn new moon. The first mention of the cult of Horus occurs in  religious writings from Hierakonpolis, circa 3300 BCE, while “the  worship of Ra, the sun god, was not established until late in the  Twelfth Dynasty, probably around 1800 BCE.”26   With the worship of the sun, a shift in ideology occurred. The  lunar religion of Isis and Osiris, steeped in the principles of eros and  identified with the fecund and chaotic forces of nature, gave way to  the masculine logos of the sun gods, who advocated order and con- trol. Re, or Ra, the sun god and mirror image of Osiris, emerged as  a dominant symbol. This union of the seemingly opposite but com- plementary principles of feminine eros encompassed by the Osirian  lunar qualities, and logos, belonging to solar theology, co-existed  and eventually merged into the state religion. The sun was believed  to be the source of divine power, personified by the gods Re (Ra),  Atum, and Amen. The kings and pharaohs of Egypt who ruled in  their names acquired the status of living gods and were expected to  sustain the world order and keep ungovernable nature at bay.  The events of the crossing of the waters of the unconscious in  the netherworld by the sun god Re and the moon god Osiris have  been envisioned and put in writing in the first illustrated text in his- tory. The Amduat (What is in the Netherworld) chronicles the night  sea journey undertaken by the god Re, as he crosses through the  underworld in a boat.27 Reassuringly, the god Re, in our terms the  “higher ego or the self,” would, after crossing through the under- world in his night barque, emerge in his morning barque from the  east, proclaiming the constantly evolving reality of a new day. The  story in the Amduat represents  ... the guiding function of the inner Sungod or of the “inner  great human.” The Amduat, written 3500 years ago, contains  in a nutshell the knowledge necessary to reunite the individual  soul with this inner guiding light. The entire Amduat could be  called the first “scientific publication” of humankind describing  or mapping the dangers, but also the regenerative capabilities  of the night-world, providing the answers to basic human  questions.28 In the Amduat, the schematic panel “always starts with the  boat of the sun, followed by the main subject of the hour ... each  hour is introduced by the solar barque.”29 The twelve hours of the  </page> <page sequence="12"> sun god’s journey through the underworld are mapped on the walls  of the tomb of Amenhotep II in the Valley of Kings in Luxor. In the Amduat, the god Re does not man his solar barque  alone; he stands surrounded by a large crew of deities and is guid- ed by the goddess Hathor, a boat-woman called “the Lady of the  Barque.” Hathor represents the eros principle, intuition, feeling, and  foresight. Re will meet twelve incarnations of Hathor, one for ev- ery hour of the night sea journey, and in each aspect Hathor pro- vides guidance and protection along the way.30 According to Abt  and Hornung, “What we learn from the Amduat is that the sun god  travels through the night in a barque, i.e., a vessel is needed to carry  the light of consciousness.”31  This text and others found in Egyptian burial chambers, such  as The Book of the Gates and the Book of the Dead, demonstrate  clearly that in both strands of the lunar and solar theologies, the  Egyptians envisioned the symbol of the gods’ transport as a boat.   Egyptians held countless celebratory festivals, conducted rit- uals and performed ceremonies to promote the cycle of renewal.  These ceremonies served the dual function of reinforcing the phar- aonic divine status and perpetuating the cult of the gods. The boat  played a vital role in most of these functions; it was significant in a  practical sense because it transported multitudes of the participants  up and down the Nile, and it acted as a partaker in a metaphysical  sense, as well, serving as a concrete symbol of Egyptian mythos. Every temple ceremony culminated in the “Procession of the  Gods” in which a small statue of the god was placed inside scaled- down models of boats, which were then carried through the villag- es, or ferried on the Nile to cult sites in these special, so-called di- vine barques. In another depiction, a well-preserved image of the divine  barque is the subject of a relief in sandstone from the court at Edfu,  circa 70 BCE, showing a graceful, crescent-shaped barque, decorat- ed at the bow and stern with the falcon heads of the god Horus (Fig.  6). In the center of the barque, on an upright altar under a baldachin  (canopy), an exact replica of the boat itself in miniature has been  placed, with the same statue of the divinity inside it. In this case, at  least visually, the boat itself is treated as an icon.32  Ample depictions and descriptions of these festivals can be  found in the murals and sandstone steles on the walls of Egyptian  tombs. The boat appears as an integral part of the subject depicted,  </page> <page sequence="13"> and also as a symbol in the descriptive text. Half a dozen such boats  are pictured on several wall panels in the temple of Horus at Edfu.  A hieroglyphic text next to a commentary describes their plank on  frame construction, employing the metaphors of the gods to Figure 6. Schematic rendering of a boat within a boat, based on the divine barque  in the Temple of Horus at Edfu. (Medvedev-Mead, pen and ink drawing33) describe how it should be built. In this way we can see how meta- phors of divinity, of state, and of ship-building intertwine to give an  accurate picture of Egyptian culture of the period: ... for the perfect rudder moves in its place like [the god]  Horus on the lap of his mother Isis. The tillers sit fast in their  mountings, like the vizier in his residence. The mast stands firm  on the foot, like Horus having taken possession on this land.  This perfect sail is of radiant color like the goddess [of the sky,  Nut] the great, pregnant with the gods ... straps beat on its [the  boat’s] sides like warriors when they begin to fight with cudgels.  The planks are close friends, not one of them moving before the  others. ...34 The function of the boats for the kings and pharaohs was of  paramount symbolic importance, conveying their sacred status.  Replicas of their divine barques, executed from precious materials,  were stored in special barque sanctuaries in most of the Egyptian  temples, e.g. the barque sanctuary in the temple of Ramses II, circa  1270 BCE, in Abydos.35 The traditional Egyptian boats made of papyrus reeds were  also widely used and are closely associated with Egyptian mortuary  culture. The post-mortem departure to the necropolis—the world  of the dead—in the far West, where Osiris sat in judgment over the  </page> <page sequence="14"> arriving souls, was envisioned as a river journey, made, most likely,  in a papyrus boat. The construction and rituals associated with the papyrus boat  were the essential elements in the mortuary rites of the commoners.  The mythical location of the afterworld was often pictured as the  Nile delta, where the Goddess Isis gave birth to Horus in a swampy  papyrus thicket. Consequently, the papyrus thicket acquired a sa- cred significance. It became a visual and semantic symbol for re- birth and victory over death. The whole community viewed going  into a papyrus thicket and building a boat, whether alone or with  one’s family as a ritual act. It is so pictured in the murals in the tomb  of the vizier Ptahhotep of the Fifth Dynasty, circa 2350 BCE. These  murals show the construction of the boat by a family as indicated by  the accompanying text.36 Figure 7. Construction of a papyrus boat. Here a father and his sons lash bundles  of reeds together in the traditional crescent shape. (Medvedev-Mead37) Egyptians believed that by placing painted images of papyrus  thickets on the walls and entrances of burial tombs the revitaliz- ing power of the thicket would be transferred to the tomb’s interi- or. Thus the tomb would be analogous to the actual papyrus grove  and would become a place of rebirth for the citizenry. Notions of  the afterlife, and of the means by which one arrived there, differed  between the royal and common people. For the commoners, a boat  was the mode of travel to the “Beautiful West” where Osiris resid- ed—in contrast to the East, abode of the rising sun and of the god  Re. Royalty, it was assumed, joined the gods in heaven by more  </page> <page sequence="15"> divine means—ascending there on the wings of birds, arriving by a  heavenly ladder, or wafting up on the fumes of incense.38 On one hand, kings and ordinary citizens followed the solar  theology which offered the security of perpetually renewed  afterlife; on the other hand, the transformation into Osiris’s  [domain] guaranteed physical eternity ... Huge ships were buried next to the pyramids, which can be  linked to either the solar or Osirisian circle. Re rides on the  celestial Nile in his boat and Osiris crosses the earthly Nile in  his.39 The boat, ship, barque—all occupied a vital role in Egyptian  culture as the dominant mythic symbol. Its symbolic meaning was  constantly present, reiterated in art, ritual, and religion. It remained  a living symbol in the consciousness of the people for over four  thousand years.  IN CONCLUSION These insights into the myth and symbolism of the boat in  Early Europe, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, limited as they are, never- theless make it clear that there were a vast array of meanings asso- ciated with the boat. To sum them up: § Boat as a metaphor for transcendental energy and eternal    life § Celestial vehicles of the divinities § Soul boat, traditional means of transport for the souls of    the deceased over water § Paleolithic period, Europe: boat as a symbol of the     goddess, the Great Mother  In ancient Sumer: § The black boat or the boat of love, poetic metaphor for    Queen Inanna’s vulva (3000 BCE) § Boat of heaven, carrier of civilization, god Enki, Inanna In ancient Egypt:  § Emblem of mobility (3000 BCE) § Sign of symbolic dominance (Naqada period, 3000 BCE) § An integral part of the solar Pharaonic theology (3000    BCE) § The god Re’s morning barque and evening barque  § Divine barques of the pharaohs § Ferry of the god Osiris </page> <page sequence="16"> In Ancient Syros, Cyclades:  § Vulva and boat combined on anthropomorphic platters    (circa third millennium BCE) In Ancient Babylon: § Moon boat reflecting the lunar mythology of     Mesopotamia, symbol of the Babylonian god Sinn, circa    1800 BCE § The ark, associated with the Babylonian god Nuah, later    the Hebrew patriarch Noah In Northern Europe:  § For cremation and burial by the Vikings For several millennia the boat encompassed a dual symbolic  meaning pertaining to life and death. In its practical application, it  rode the waves on life’s “day sea” journey and manifested a triumph  of life over death. In its mortuary function, it ferried the souls of  the dead on a “nocturnal passage” to the underworld. This spiritual  function was known as the “night sea journey.” In both functions it  remained an enduring symbol of transcendence and renewal. As an emblem of the “day sea journey” and as a concrete ob- ject, the boat played a crucial role in the expansion of conscious- ness, knowledge, and changing weltanschauung (worldview), being  instrumental in trade and commerce. Jung compares the psychological meaning of the “day sea jour- ney” to the sun’s daily passage across the sky, which parallels meta- phorically the progress of the hero’s ego across the sea of conscious- ness. Jung sees the “night sea journey” as a “downward way, the yin  way [to] the earth, the darkness of humanity.”40 In this role the boat  assumes the properties of the vessel in its most primal sense—as a  symbol of the Feminine, a container, a womb, an urn, a cave, a mag- ic cauldron, or the belly—as in the belly of the whale in the story of  Jonah. It is in this vessel that things transform, are reanimated and  discharged back out into life, in unison with the cosmic patterns of  life’s rhythmic interplay with death, rebirth, and renewal.  The vessel, the cosmic cauldron, has its counterpart in the  sixth hour of the Amduat, midnight, when the forces of life and  death, of lunar and solar, dissolve into one another. It is at this sixth  hour that Osiris turns into Re and takes the souls of the dead in his  barque back to the East, to the land of the sun and rebirth. It is at  this depth that Jonah lights the fire in the sea monster’s belly and  </page> <page sequence="17"> cuts himself free. “The meaning of this cycle of myth,” Jung explains,  “is clear enough: it is the longing to attain rebirth through a return  to the womb, and to become immortal like the sun.”41 And Norman  Brown confirms by saying, “the wanderings of the soul after death  are prenatal adventures; a journey by water, in a ship which is itself  a Goddess, to the gates of rebirth.”42 And that is the ultimate acco- lade to the boat symbol, since the Goddess expresses unity of all life  in her omnipotent and omnipresent manifestations. Thus the metaphor of the boat embraced both polarities of the  night and day sea journeys. The boat served as a cradle and a coffin  in the soul’s transition away from its birth mother and in its return  to Mother Earth.  Today most of the mythic heroes of the past are hardly known  and their heroic deeds are even less remembered. However, myth,  as a parable reflecting a state of the human psyche at a given time  in a specific place and circumstance, does not entirely disappear.  The ancient myths of the West have been superseded by the Age of  Reason, and the scientific worldview has generated new myths based  on science and science fiction. The modern hero took the helm of  the ship away from the Goddess, the feminine principle, and headed  toward logos and the rational principle of the masculine. This change in ideology heralded the end of the intrinsic, sym- bolic meaning of the boat that has been held for so many millen- nia. The small wooden boat is no longer the sacred vehicle of gods  and goddesses and mythic heroes; it is no longer used for funerary  rites and religious ceremonies. The boat, and the nature of wood  itself—the original material of boats—lost its metaphysical, numi- nous quality. The boat now exists as a utilitarian object, admired  for its craftsmanship at best, for the beauty of its shape and for its  function.  And yet, from out of the dimming legends and myths of the  past, the “archaic residue” of the boat’s image and meaning remains  in our collective memory. The boat has been an iconic object for too  long for its significance to fade utterly: it still retains, if only sublimi- nally, its psychic legacy. This is perhaps why wooden boats still hold  such appeal for so many, and assume among boat lovers the name,  character, and special relationship of the beloved.

The symbolism of the boat/ship emanates from what  Jung calls “the primordial era when the unconscious was predominant and the  </page> <page sequence="19"> conscious weak,” when myth and lore were taken for factual reality and gods and  goddesses for granted as projections of the immutable, incomprehensible forces  of nature. Long connected in various world religions with magic, death, and re- birth, the boat as archetype has a powerful significance. This article is a study of the  boat’s history in the human imagination, from the prehistoric “ships of renewal” in  Mesopotamia, to the funerary boats of Northern Europe. It traces the history of  the ship in its role as regenerator, savioress, and divine symbol. The article begins  with a brief discussion of the author’s fascination with wooden boats, and outlines  the boat’s connection to the Great Mother goddess cult in its many permutations,  significantly the Mesopotamian cult of Inanna, in which the ship is a symbol for  the vulva, the womb, and the grave. Finally, the article defines the boat in its role as  a vessel of death and rebirth, connected to the moon barque used by the Egyptian  gods (both solar and lunar), and its place as an important archetype in Jung’s con- cept of the night sea journey. KEY WORDS  Aquatic symbolism, archetype, boats, day-sea journey, death, feminist, Egyptian  mythology, Inanna, lunar, Mesopotamian prehistoric cultures, mother goddess  cult, night sea journey, rebirth, ship, Ships of Renewal, vulva, womb.  </page> </plain_text>
