<plain_text><page sequence="1">THRENE AND THEME IN VWATT SIDNEY WARHAFT A little Descartes is a dangerous thing, Sink deep in tasting of the Cartesian spring. -Variation on a Joycean variation In Samuel Beckett's Watt the hero, having rolled himself into a ditch to recover from a weakness which may or may not have been caused by a blow from a stone cast by a cryptic Lady McCann, hears a quartet, "voices, indifferent in quality, of a mixed choir," chanting somewhere in the distance.' Although at least one critic has faltered over this puzzling incident, and another has merely explained it away in a brief careless rapture, for those who care and also have the time some steps toward an explanation olf it seem possible and even significant.2 In fact, carefully examined, the threne can be found to have a strong synecdochic relevance, a meaning central to the whole obscure but uncommonly challenging novel. The first stanza sung by the invisible choir goes as follows (this is the soprano part, to which the other three parts add little more than suggestively abusive counterpoint): Fifty-two point two eight five seven ,one four two eight five seven one four two greatgran ma Ma grew how do you do blooming thanks and you drooping thanks and you withered thanks and you forgotten thanks and you thanks forgotten too greatgran ma Ma grew and the same to you The crux here is the peculiar figure at the beginning with the overwhelming decimal; yet it is in a sense the simplest of the 1 Samuel Beckett, Watt (New York, 1959), p. 33. 2 See William York Tindall, "Beckett's Bums," Critique, II (Spring- Summer 1958), 6-7; and Hugh Kenner, Samuel Beckett: A Critical Study (New York, 1961), p. 104. Both studies, however, are excellent, Kenner's in particular irradiating many obscurities in the Beckett canon. Threne and Theme 261</page><page sequence="2">problems raised by the passage. For the figure, lacking any other recognizable possibilities, seems to refer to the exact num- ber of weeks is 366 days (i.e. 366/7 - 52 2/7), the dicemal being repeated twice and a bit. The reference is probably not so much to a leap year (although an exacerbated ingenuity mnight easily justify such a finding) as to a year and a day - the traditional, legendary, and legal description of a full or com- plete term, the time required for the completion of a sentence, a trial, or a quest. It is simultaneously an obscure but precise, if popular, and rather ludicrous indication of time, a nice mix- ture of the nearly unintelligible but burdensomely accurate with the strange and the laughable. It is also a given point in time, a point without reference, floating in nothingness, from which, however obscurely and arbitrarily, duration might be measured. The second stanza confirms these suspicions. It begins: 51.1428- 571428571 - a figure which can only mean, in the terms al- ready established, a passage of eight days (a French week?) from the first given point (i..e., [366-8]/7 358/7 = 51 1/7 or of seven days, this being the eighth (Christmas?). The content of both stanzas ("verses" Watt calls them) forms a kind of fragmented summary of, and commentary upon, the human condition moving through the full term of life in a cold and meaningless universe. In the first stanza there is some sort of development (birth?) in the past ("greatgran ma Ma grew") punctuated by the inanities ("how do you do") and colored by the basic emotional states (blooming, drooping, with- ered) which, in contrapuntal fashion, make up man's life. Both questioner and answerer are "forgotten" in this passage of time, a passage from which none can escape or at least for which all of mankind seems destined ("and the same to you"). The second stanza not only repeats these themes with variations, but also follows up some of their implications. Living is now indicated by food, uninteresting, nauseating food - "a big fat yellow bun"' - which everybody, Mr Man, Mrs Man, Master Man, and Miss Man, spends his (life)time over. And while humanity ekes out its involvement with the universal common- places of communication and survival, time moves by quickly, until eventually man and the moment come together for a brief instant before or at the end. The "one" of "everyone" is also the "one" of the last day: a big fat bun for everyone four two eight five seven one four two eight five seven one. Thus the weeks and days have passed, filled with conflicting and at best flat if not unpleasant images and conditions, until 262 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="3">finally man and time, having moved for so long in parallel lines, meet in the infinity of forgetfulness. For at the end, when the full period of a year and a day has drawn to a close, nothing re- mains of human existence, not even memory, not even a mem- ory: till all the buns are done and everyone is gone home to oblivion. If this much in general be conceded, the centrality of the interlude to the whole novel becomes demonstrable. Although the threne apparently fails to enlighten Watt, it must be read as a kind of dim revelation of the whole of the seedy hero's quest. Set to find and serve Mr Knott, Watt stumbles through time toward he knows not what, away from one knows not what (all puns intended), and comes to gain nothing from his effort but the oblivion of madness which is only a prelude to a meaning- less death. As he sits in the ditch he is still able, or thinks that his discursive reason, his painstaking logic, and his careful lan- guage are still able to explain the world around him, or at least to cope with its reality. Thus armed, then, he is launched (the passive seems more nearly right here, although the verb may be a trifle too forceful) on the ontological and epistemological trial that will inevitably find him wanting. Confronted with the irra- tional in being as well as in knowledge, he must fail, both be- cause his means of knowing are inadequate and because the ob- ject of his search, if it exists, is not knowable anyway. Let us consider the second first (and, to elaborate a la Watt, so, the first second). The basic fact is that Mr Knott is not to be known by rational means. For this peculiarly ineffectual country squire, this bachelor master running his household upon strict, if idiosyncratic lines, is most enigmatical. Like the later mysterious Godot (who does not even appear but sends a boy in his stead), he is something of a deity figure,3 with all the ob- scurity and ambiguity that the title suggests to the modern mind. To Mr Knott, we are told (135), "and with Mr Knott, and from Mr Knott, were a coming and a being and a going exempt from languor, exempt from fever, for Mr Knott was harbour, Mr. Knott was haven. . ." He is seen (147), "as it were in a glass," darkly, and to discuss him or to think of him in terms of human desires and needs is an anthropomorphic insolence (202) of however short a duration. Everything about Mr Knott is con- stantly shifting and changing. The pieces of furniture in his room are never still. His physical appearance, his voice, smell, 3 See Ruby Cohn, Samuel Beckett: The Comic Gamut (New Bruns- wick, N. J., 1962), p. 69. Threne and Theme 263</page><page sequence="4">hair, undergo daily alteration; even "the belch was never the same, two days running, to go no further than the belch" (211). The most significant consequence of this uncertainty of being is that Mr Knott needs to be witnessed, a fact emphasized more than once in the novel. That the witnessing must these days be performed by ludicrous decaying creatures cannot be helped, if it matters. "For though it is rumored," Watt's predecessor Arsene informs him (58-59), "that Knott would prefer to have no one at all about him, to look after him, yet since he is obliged to have someone at all about him, to look after him, being quite incapable of looking after himself, then the suggestion is that what he likes best is the minimum number of small fat shabby seedy juicy bandylegged potbellied potbottomed men about him, to look after him, or, failing this, the fewest possible big bony seedy shabby haggard knockkneed rottentoothed rednosed men about him, to take care of him. . . [and so on for another 125 words or so]." As befits deity, the witnessing is to be fulfilled according to biblical dictate: the "minimum number," the "few- est possible," "in tireless assiduity turning" about Mr Knott is (61) "two men and so far as we know never more and never fewer have always been to be found." The reason finally given for Mr Knott's need of a witness is that he "of himself knew nothing" (203). Not only does this suggest a thorough negation of one of the most important char- acteristics of God according to long-standing definition ("the integral knowledge [this infinite reality] has of itself")4 but it also implies that the traditional order of Christian contingence is reversed, in that his identity as well as being depend on what used to be called his creatures. No longer is man made in the image of God: God is now made in the image of man. Without man, he would cease to be; with man, he is continually created anew.5 It follows, then, that if Erskine, Arsene, Walter, Vin- cent, and all the other servants of Mr Knott had managed to tell something of their master, "Then we would have had Er- skine's Mr Knott, and Arsene's Mr Knott, and Walter's Mr Knott, and Vincent's Mr Knott, to compare with Watt's Mr 4 Etienne Gilson, The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy, tr. A.H.C. Downes (London, 1936), p. 224. In further contradistinction to Mr Knott, the orthodox God is also absolute self-existence (see Gilson, God and Philosophy [New Haven, 19411, p. 68). 5 In a panoramic survey of Beckett's ideas, Huguette Delye (Samuel Beckett ou la philosophie de l'absurde [Aix-en-Provence, 1962]), sums up (p. 50): "L'homme cr6e Dieu A son image, l'affublant de d6froques hu- maines diverses." Cf. Frederick J. Hoffman, Samuel Beckett: The Language of Self (Carbondale, Ill., 1962), p. 115: "The substance of Knott is nothing if not contained in Watt's mind." 264 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="5">Knott. That would have been a very interesting exercise" (126). But of course it would only have remained an exercise, an aca- demic excursion into abstract semantics. For Mr Knott, much like Zeus in Sartre's Les Mouches (who, although he is known not to exist, nonetheless takes Orestes on a kind of Cook's tour of Thebes), seems more naught than not. Hence to act in his service, to talk about him, to try to define his nature is indeed an anthropomorphic insolence in more ways than one. Unhappi- ly, there is no alternative. "For the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time, and as the only way one can speak of man, even our an- thropologists have realized that, is to speak of him as though he were a termite" (77). From nothing to God to man the ter- mite witness - the perspective shifts damagingly back and forth between the two extremes, reducing in both directions every aspect of being to emptiness or to absurdity. One has only to consider the ingloriousness of the series, shabby, potbellied, rottentoothed, and stinking, who come to vouch for Mr Knott to understand why he thoroughly despises them. What other reaction is open to any self-respecting divini- ty? Understandably, the only one of his gestures that can be called characteristic is the one which reveals the greatest con- tempt for everything about him. It is at the same time a dis- gusted rejection of and (parodying the three oriental monkeys who refused to perceive evil) a derisive retirement from a world grown absurd. This gesture "consisted in the simultan- eous obturation of the facial cavities, the thumbs in the mouth, the forefingers in the ears, the little fingers in the nostrils, the third fingers in the eyes, and the second fingers, free in a crisis to promote intellection, laid along the temples" (212). As an impotent god, he is not surprisingly quite alienated from the creation that once was his. When he moves through his gar- den, for example, he does so (203) as one unacquainted with its beauties and surprised by its contents. Nor are his feelings for mankind any warmer. In fact, he not only cares nothing for man, but he also rejects all of his accomplishments. Hence his addic- tion (209) to "solitary dactylic ejaculations of extraordinary vigour, accompanied by spasms of the members. The chief of these were: Exelmans! Cavendish! Habbakuk! Ecchymose!" As Ruby Cohn has pointed out, in grouping a French general, a British scientist, and a Hebrew prophet before a term of pathology meaning "bloody blotch," Mr Knott is sneering at all human effort and achievement.6 From all of this it appears 6 Cohn, Beckett, pp. 81-82. Threne and Theme 265</page><page sequence="6">that Mr Knott is completely unwilling, or, if not unwilling, powerless to guide or enlighten his followers in any way. An inimical and ineffectual leader of humanity, he is quite unable to help Watt to the truth about himself or his existence. Nor does there seem to be much hope in the future that he will re- gain his ancient powers and charity; a second coming, a rebirth, even if it were to occur, would be fruitless: for "between Mr Knott risen and Mr Knott retired there was so, to speak nothing to choose" (86). Everything we learn about Mr Knott we get of course through Watt (or through Sam the narrator, although the point of view is rarely fully ascertainable), and Watt is undeniably a most imperfect witness (203). Even if he had somehow had direct dealings with Mr Knott, which he did not (67), his pow- ers of apprehension would have proved inadequate to the task. As critics have already noted, Watt's is the Cartesian pre- dicament. In Kenner's fine words, "he bears the Cartesian cross, the discursive intellect, with its irremediable itch to think ex- plicable worlds into existence, stumbling through corridors of exquisite absurdity toward some talismanic formula with which it can be temporarily at rest."' This "exquisite absurdity" is the price that man has had to pay in the last two centuries for The Discourse of Method: for, however precise his method has turned out to be, in a universe from which the guarantees of certainty by an absolute deity have disappeared, the assur- ance of value or direction or meaning which his rational tools of number, logic, and experience strive for can never be complete. It is true of course that Descartes himself insisted upon, even proved to his own satisfaction, the existence of a divine guaran- tor of the validity of his ,Cogito. Once he had assured himself of the reality of the idea of God, H*ffding reminds us, Descartes assumed without further question that he had also won a cer- tain foundation for the reality of our knowledge.8 But for the less faithful generations that came in the Cartesian wake, such certitude has no longer seemed allowable or even sensible: for them the 'Cogito has had to stand alone; the discursive intellect 7 Kenner, pp. 59-60. See also: Cohn, Beckett, pp. 13, 69; Jacqueline Hoefer, "Watt," Perspective, XI (Autumn 1959), 166-182; and Hoffman, p. 114. 8 Harald H6ffding, A History of Modern Philosophy, trans. H. B. Meyer (New York, 1955), Vol. I, p. 221. Cf. Gilson, God and Philosophy "Because the Cartesian God was metaphysically true, he provided sci- ence with the principles of true physics. . . . The essence of the Car- tesian God was largely determined by his philosophical function, which was to create and to preserve the mechanical world of science as Descartes himself conceived it" (pp. 84, 87). 266 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="7">has had to fend for itself. In this context, the very first incident in Watt, Mr Hackett's failure to convince a policeman of the calorific exertions of a couple usurping his favorite public seat (9), reveals explicitly the difficult circumstances under which Watt will make his quest. "Officer, he [Hackett] cried, as God is my witness, he had his hand upon it." And the officer answers, "God is a witness that cannot be sworn." This is the prime con- dition of Watt's very being.9 Officially, legally, in the name of the law, he will be left entirely to his own resources in learning the truth of his own existence. Deprived of divine guidance and authority, divested of appeal to or refuge in an absolute im- primatur, he is entirely without external support in his dealings with the world. He is not only an imperfect witness; he is also a needy witness (203). Mr Knott is as important to him as he is to Mr Knott (to pursue the argument of this variant form of medieval insolubilia becomes bewildering), but he is no more witnessed than he witnesses. As a latter-day Cartesian, he has only his own powers to depend on, his own senses and his own clear and distinct ideas, to interpret the validity no less than the reality of his experiences. What these powers can do before the mystery of divinity becomes the question. The whole Hackett matter deserves close inspection, in- deed demands it as an entry into the novel. For there is good reason (if one may use the phrase in the presence of Watt) to believe that the Hackett-Watt relationship is a kind of ob- scure allegory objectifying the whole theologico-philosophical predicament of modern man described above. What Beckett seems to have done here is to have turned the Cartesian break- down of a medieval system, notably that of Duns Scotus, into a vast and subtle, if not over-subtle, metaphor. Fantastic as it may appear in even this fantastic work, Hackett should probably be understood as the haecceitas (thisness) and Watt as the quidditas (whatness) in the Scotic concept of differentiation of being. For Scotus the rather obscure idea of haecceitas was the specific determination distinguishing the individual: it was his famous principle of individuation, expressing "that by which a quiddity, or general essence becomes an individual, particular nature, or being."' B. A. G. Fuller sums up the pertinent issues as follows: Since the Universal has no priority over the individuals that embody it but is created along with them, the uni- 9 Ruby Cohn says that this uncertainty of witness is a basic theme in Watt: "Watt in the Light of The Castle," Comparative Literature, XIII (Spring 1961), 157. 10 Dagobert Runes (ed.), The Dictionary of Philosophy (New York, 1942), p. 121. Threne and Theme 267</page><page sequence="8">verse comes into being as a system of Forms already enacted in their particular instances. In other words, it is of the very nature of the Form itself to be particu- larized. Tom, Dick, and Harry, then, are not due to an individuation by Matter or by a Form of man whose na- ture it is to be simply and purely a Universal. Nor are they the embodiments of Ideas of individuals existing in addition to the Form of man. They are due to the fact that it is inherent in human nature to be not only man- kind but men. ... To possess the human form implies possessing a human Form, the Form of Tom or Dick or Harry. Individuation, in short, is necessary to the com- plete expression of Form.... ... Tom, Dick, and Harry do not differ from one another in the same way as they differ from a litter of kittens. Nor do they differ from one another as dif- ferent concepts the mind forms of Tom and Dick dif- fer .... Tom, for example, possesses not only whatness (quidditas) which makes him human, but thisness (haecceitas) which makes him Tom. Only part of the multitudinous riches opened up here can be pursued. The main value of Fuller's summation is that it helps to clarify the peculiar kinship between Watt and Hackett. Since together, in terms of the tenor iof the metaphor of which they are the vehicle, they would make up a man, it is not surprising that Hackett should upon sight of his undifferentiated self be visited by an overwhelming feeling of intrigue (17): "Mr Hackett did not know when he had been more intrigued, nay, he did not know when had been so intrigued. He did not know either what it was that so intrigued him." Nor is it quite so puzzling now that there should be a strong resemblance between Hackett and Watt: in any well-run universe this would be indistinguish- able from that, since they would in actuality be one. "The curi- ous thing is, my dear fellow," a Mr Nixon (who himself seems to have known Watt all his life) observes to Hackett (19), "I tell you quite frankly, that when I see him, or think of him, I think of you, and that when I see you, or think of you, I think of him. I have no idea why this is so." But Watt does not happen to find himself in a well-run universe, and both Hackett's in- trigue and Nixon's curiosity must remain unsatisfied. And, since Hackett does not know Watt, the latter, reciprocally un- ware of his own human Form, must embark on his life's adven- ture without him. An undifferentiated and so a fragmentary being, not quite a particular man, Watt is shabby mankind in general, modern man 11 A History of Pholisophy (New York, 1948), Book I, pp. 411-412. 268 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="9">separated from the dynamic principle of individuation which might give direction and meaning, definition and location, to his existence. For Scotus this principle ultimately derives from God - Hackett's witness if nobody else's - and so could now hardly be hoped for from that anthropomorphic nonentity thought into existence by mere human intellect. Once again Watt is caught in a vicious circle of paradoxes from whose terror there seems no escape. He has lost his species (85) once granted to him by an external power now moribund; and neither today appears recoverable. Having been deprived of his thisvess, he has be- come simply part of a series, whether tall or fat, without much claim either to individual identity or to traditional res- pect. How more appropriately could such a figure be portrayed than as a weird nose-picking tramp with scant red hair, un- matched shoes, and a running sore of traumatic origin? Like Arsene and all those others of whose series he is a part (so, fittingly, does the Cartesian mind indicate the universal), he has been subject to "the reversed metamorphosis," to "exis- tence off the ladder" (44). This last phrase, most ably shown by Jacqueline Hoefer to be an allusion to Wittgenstein2" - who pushed the Cartesian hypothesis to one of its logical extremes, or extremities - seems here to mean (pace Miss Hoefer) exis- tence without witness, without ultimate sanction or warranty. What was for Wittgenstein a statement about the difficulty of seeing the world rightly through the ordinary language of logic or logic of language is for Arsene and Watt a denial of everything that makes them man. For Watt too something basic has slipped, just as it had for Arsene, just as it does for all men (45) : "For in truth the same things happen to us all ["and the same to you"], especially to men in our situation, whatever that is, if only we chose to know it." No longer availa- ble to the Watts of this world is the comfort of entering Mr Knott's establishment and settling into it "with the old words, the old credentials" (85). Although Mr Knott in another dis- pensation might be haven, Watt never finds comfort in him but 12 Hoefer, pp. 180-181. See also Kenner, p. 58. In the light of Wittgen- stein's view (Runes, p. 377) that a statement is able to assert a certain state of affairs by virtue of having the same structure as that which it represents, the following observations (which I must admit I do not fully understand) by Vivian Mercier ("The Mathematical Limit," Nation, [Feb. 14, 19591, p. 144) take on another dimension: "Watt's career might be represented graphically as the curve of a function which diminishes until it approaches zero and then gradually increases again. Watt's very name (What?) suggests that he is the variable (or unknown quantity) x of which his career is the function. Neither x nor f(x) is ever equal to zero, just as Watt never quite identifies himself with Knott." Threwe and Theme 269</page><page sequence="10">remains haunted by the likelihood that even in Mr Knott's bosom mankind will lack individuation. Thus he wonders endlessly about the particularity of Mr Knott's servants (134-136) : "But why Tom Tom? And Dick Dick? And Harry Harry? Because Dick Dick and Harry Harry? Because Harry Harry and Tom Tom? Because Tom Tom and Dick Dick? . . ." From this hope- less labyrinth of analysis and speculation one returns (if at all) sure of only one thing: Watt's desperate need and inevitable failure to identify individual men - himself along with the rest - in a given space and at a given time. As Watt leaves Hackett and makes for the train, he bumps into a porter (24). "The devil raise a hump on you, said the porter," thereby identifying him more closely than ever with the humpbacked Hackett. And then, Can't you look where you're going? he said, Watt did not cry out on this extravagant suggestion, let fall, it is only fair to say in the heat of anger. An extravagant suggestion indeed, for it presupposes every- thing about Watt that he has yet to prove: the validity of his powers of perception and the reality, including direction and fixi- ty, of that which he perceives or thinks he perceives outside of himself. Although Descartes held the existence of God to be obvious (known by an innate idea), he was not so sure of an extramental, bodily world (known by adventitious ideas). If then the first, as guarantor, disappears, becomes "naught," the second must manifestly run into trouble. Without the "old credentials," man must go his way under the continual suspicion that existence external to him is not really there and that, like the God he seeks out in his need, he creates it anew at every glance. This solipsistic harvest inherent in the Cogito Watt of course reaps abundantly. Thus the first footnote in the novel, casting its sour irony over all that follows, declares (8) : "Much valuable space has been saved, in this work, that would other- wise have been lost, by avoidance of the plethoric reflexive pro- noun after say." In the final analysis, everyb!ody in the world of the book ends up having spoken only to himself, cut off from the rest of mankind and from the outside world itself by the prison of his own being. Whatever the grammatical distinctions he makes that might lead him to believe otherwise, however much be might torture logic and refine his measurements, he can never be sure that he is witnessing something outside of his own mind, "whatever that might mean" (77). Another insight into the nature of this quandary is afforded through Watt's en- counter (27ff.) on the train to Mr Knott with a certain Mr Spiro, a professional "neo-John-Thomist" whose friends call him Dum 270 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="11">because he is so bright and cheerful. "D-U-M. Anagram of mud." Thus quickly reduced to absurdity, this expert on spiritual af- fairs comments brightly, albeit disingenuously, on difficult ques- tions of Catholic dogma (themselves also reduced to absurdity) with complete assurance. Certain of his position, by-passing Descartes, backed both by faith ("We know what we know") And by the authorities he quotes in quantity, Mr Spiro is in open contrast to Watt.13 And Watt, as is his wont, gets nothing from the communications of his companion as he sits in the train listening to unexplained four "other voices" examined in Cartesian fashion in their fourteen possible combinations. It may now be somewhat more comprehensible why most of Watt's experience in the ditch seems to be interior rather than exterior. True, to some extent time and humanity appear to exist independently of Watt: the dirge-like voices, for example, come to him (33) "with great distinctness, from afar, from without, yes, really it seemed from without. . . ." But it is obvious that he is himself not absolutely sure about this and that his con- tact here as elsewhere with extramental reality and the crea- tures filling it is neither intimate nor intense. The only world that has reality and significance, Beckett has argued elsewhere, is the world of our own latent consciousness.4 Moreover, the very fact that it is music that Watt hears suggests still further that his experience is mainly subjective. For to Beckett all appre- hension of music (other matters aside) is subjective. In his es- say on Proust Beckett sides with Schopenhauer in separating music from the other arts, because these, he explains, can only produce the Idea with its concomitant phenomena, "whereas music is the Idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena, ex- isting ideally outside the universe, apprehended not in Space but in Time only, and consequently untouched by the teleological hy- pothesis. This essential quality of music is distorted by the listener who, being an impure subject, insists on giving a figure to that which is ideal and indivisible, on incarnating the Idea in what he conceives to be an appropriate paradigm."'5 Thus Watt, a fortiori an impure subject, inevitably "incarnating" in terms of his own unsubstantial, fragmentary, and ludicrous self, gives to the music he hears a vague and risible "figure" or "Idea." It is not exactly poetry he spins out of himself - poetry pre- 13 Mr Spiro's concern with the problems of what happens to a rat which eats of a consecrated wafer (p. 28) should be considered in the light of the fact that Descartes preferred to think of animals as ma- chines because he was disinclined to concede immortality to an oyster or a fungus (see H6ffding, p. 234). 14 Proust (New York, n.d.), p. 3. See also Cohn, Beckett, p. 67. 15 Ibid., p. 70. Threne and Theme 271</page><page sequence="12">supposes more conscious definition and structure - but an an- cient chant, a threne or lament for his dimly realized entangle- ment with uncertain reality. It is in a sense the soul singing for tatters in its mortal dress: it is not much of a song, but it is not much of a soul either. Fractured, alone, and disoriented, he can only educe from his grotesque shapelessness a vapid vision which does nothing to enlighten him or to clarify his goal but merely confirms his comic confusion and aimlessness. How far removed is this lukewarm epiphany from those illuminated moments of Proust's narrator (to say nothing of the over- whelming experiences of religious mystics) when involuntary memory annihilates time for him. For Watt the moment is not quite illuminated; nor is time quite annihilated. Time seems in fact to have dictated the matter of the threne, which the dis- cursive reason of Watt then automatically identifies as part of the world of phenomena and quickly gives an appropriate para- digm. Put in another way, it is Watt who listens to his own motet babbling tunelessly about his own enmeshment in time. The vision is doubly illusory. Because he has no fixed point to refer to outside of himself, no spiritual location or direction, the voices he spins out of himself to explain his state to himself can hardly help to cast any light upon that state. Like Dante's Belacqua he is in Antepurgatory, a dim haunted region where his soul's attention, as Strauss has brilliantly put it in general, is "distracted by idle entertainments, . . . dissipated by idle waiting."'6 Unlike Belacqua, however, he is destined not for ultimate beatitude but for an oblivion without buns. And, al- though his vision is inevitably "touched by the teleological hy- pothesis" ("everyone is gone/ home"), the vague purposiveness seems hardly challenging or encouraging, for home is after all oblivion. He does not however appear at this point to be completely lost and helpless. Of the two stanzas, we are told (35), "Watt thought he preferred the former. Bun is such a sad word, is it not? And man is not much better, is it?" Simply to exist, in however a withered, drooping, blooming, and forgotten way, seems preferable to disappearing altogether. Unlike Beckett's later heroes, who seem to take up where Watt leaves off, he is not absolutely immobilized by his involvement in duration. Confused and uncertain though he may be, he can nevertheless walk (after his fashion), and here, after his bleak revelation, he manages finally through his own volition and power to crawl out of the ditch and to resume his journey, "with less difficulty than he had feared, at the point where it had been interrupted, 16 Walter A. Strauss, "Dante's Belacqua and Beckett's Tramps," Comn- parative Literature, XI (Summer 1959), 250. 272 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="13">by the feeling of weakness." The music too suggests something more or at least other than complete despair and paralysis. In a note at the end of the book (just preceding the last rather ironic and perhaps truthful admonishment of "no symbols where none intended"), Beckett provides the music which the soprano sang. The chant, properly dirge-like, is in the key of B minor, but it tends upward and ends on part of a dominant chord. If not exactly Browning's C major of this life, the note nonethe- less hints at something faintly positive. Time, Beckett has said, is a "doubleheaded monster of damnation and salvation."17 The damnation of Watt in and by time is relatively clear: he must exist in its meaningless concatenation of a multitude of inter- vals. His salvation by time, however, is not so evident, but the point seems to be that he must exist. That is, the human pre- dicament is as much human as it is a predicament - and it is ultimately toward tenuous humanity and human needs that Watt, together with other of Beckett's protagonists, stumbling- ly turns. Granted that his way hardly leads to felicity - to that one cannot aspire, as Arsene warns - but it is still in a sense an affirmation. Absurd and eventually devastating though it gets to be, the quest for man and the God he needs is more worth undertaking than not. For (44) "it is useless not to seek, not to want, for when you cease to seek you start to find, and when you cease to want, then life begins to ram her fish and chips down your gullet until you puke, and then the puke down your gullet until you puke the puke, and the puked puke until you begin to like it." This much hero Watt seems to sense him- self in the ditch; at any rate, the music over, the feeling of weakness which had overcome him he "left, together with his evening meal of goat's milk and insufficiently cooked cod, in the ditch, and it was with confidence that he now advanced, in the middle of the road. ... ." No confidence was ever more misplaced. For his subsequent experience takes him, in Eliot's phrase, In and out, in an endless drift Of shrieking forms in a circular desert. Almost as soon as he arrives at Mr Knott's place (entering this Chapel Perilous he never knows how),l" Watt is forced for the first time in his life to examine seemingly ordinary events, "the simple games that time plays with space," with great and in- creasing care. He who had not seen a symbol nor executed an interpretation since the age of fourteen (73), now must begin 17 Proust, p. 1. 18 The parallel has already been noted more than once: see, for exam- ple, Cohn, Beckett, p. 80. Threne and Theme 273</page><page sequence="14">to concern himself with things as they are in reality. He was obliged, we learn (75), "because of his peculiar character, to enquire into what they meant, oh not into what they really meant, his character was not so peculiar as all that, but into what they might be induced to mean, with the help of a little patience, a little ingenuity." But the house of Knott has many pitfalls. Since events there are not of the surface and Watt has no way of looking below the surface, not all his ingenuity nor all his patience can unravel the mysteries of the place or resolve its swirl of "vain entelechies" (220). Simple keys, as he himself once observes (124), can never open obscure locks. Rashly or courageously, he ignores Arsene's warning (62) that he is faced with "what has so happily been called the unutterable or inef- fable, so that any attempt to utter or eff it is doomed to fail, doomed, doomed to fail." It is a lesson, apparently, that every man has to learn for himself. Some, it seems, have abdicated from the struggle, have grown to like the puked puke, and in the process have become simply good-natured men, men of good will eating big fat yellow buns. But Watt - it is the measure of his heroism - persists to the bitter end. From the first unsettl- ing visit of the Galls to the disposal of Mr Knott's slops (four solutions and fourteen objections) to pots to dogs to bells to keys, Watt tries rationally, logically, methodically, to get be- neath the surface significance of Mr Knott's ambience, to find out what it might be induced to mean; but the reasons for events there are offered only to the understanding (68), which is ill- equipped to grasp their essence. It is like a two-dimensional plane trying to crash through into a three-dimensional solid; he can never really penetrate that strange other world. Lacking the depth of selfhood and faith, confronted with a being with which he can in no way communicate, of whose nature he remains ever "in particular ignorance" (199), Watt is doomed ultimately to find everything at Mr Knott's place inexplicable. He cuts the Cartesian Knott by going mad, by trying to con- front one order of irrationality with another. But the real night- mare of his solution is that, far from being a real madness afford- ing him escape or insight, it is rather only a flight further into his discursive reason, a frenzied application of his old ration- ality, a frantic ruse ("ruse a by") which involves him more deep- ly than ever in his predicament. Since to explain had always been for him to exorcize (78), now in his need for semantic succor (83) he tries desperately to build for himself a pillow of words (117). No reason or explanation for what occurs around him, no variation or combination of reasons or explanations, no objection to any of these does he leave uninvestigated in his desperation. By Cartesian definition a thing that thinks, he 274 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="15">thinks endlessly about the things about him, seeking through clear and distinct ideas to find (in Joyce's turn) "the rite words in rote order" that will give meaning to them. He even goes through eight stages of inverting syntax and spelling in order to describe and perhaps explain his experience with Mr Knott. The seventh sums up as well as anything the yearning misery of his dilemma (168): Dis yb dis, nem owt. Yad la, tin fo trap. Skin, skin, skin. Od su did ned taw? On. Taw ot klat tonk? On. Tonk ot klat taw? On. Taw ta kool tonk? Nilb, mun, mud. Tin fo trap, yad la. Nem owt, dis yb dis. Sid by sid, two men. Al day, part of nit. Dum num, blin. That is his tragedy, appropriately delivered in tortured frag- ments: unable because of his nature ever to comprehend that Mr Knott might be more than man, living side by side with him with- out ever knowing him, he ends up dumb, numb, and blind. And the bitter irony of his ordeal is that the more precise and lucid he tries to be in his measurements and logic (he was a university man), the less meaningful these become. Time is not made any the more significant, its emptiness is no more nearly filled, by being measured to the thirteenth decimal place. Movement in space, the heterogeneous phenomena of life and nature do not reveal any secrets by being meticulously analyzed, defined, and catalogued. Clearly the obligation he has accepted carries him far into absurdity as well as into horror, but he "will not/ abate one jot" (249) from his undertaking. At the end, so ludicrous are his plight and his attempts to correct it, and yet so fearful is his suffering (he is variously identified with Christ) - a bum crucified on a cross of Cartesian coordinates - that his final baptism in a bucket of slime seems bitterly fitting.'9 The development of Watt toward his fate may be said to par- allel the historical development of man toward his modern con- dition - and, not so incidentally, to find dark revelation in the threne in the ditch. The movement of this obscure parable is generally as follows. First, what the God of Duns Scotus had joined together ("blooming") Descartes' Cogito has put asunder - but leaving man ("drooping") at least with his logic and his deity, in that order. Then follows exploration of the Car- tesian system, with a brief excursus into one of its more ex- travagant manifestations, Occasionalism, as reflected mainly in the description of the way Watt walks - Descartes' human ma- 19 David H. Hesla, "The Shape of Chaos: A Reading of Beckett's Watt," Critique, VI (Spring 1963), 85-106, even finds, among other in- teresting things, that Watt's progress to Knott's house parallels the fourteen Stations of the Cross. Threne and Theme 275</page><page sequence="16">chine in motion guaranteed by the God of Geulincx, so to speak.20 Soon, however, the Occasional Mediator is dismissed, leaving man ("withered") with only his logic to fall back upon. Finally, with the advent of Wittgenstein and Logical Positivism even his rational underpinning has been wiped away. The result of all of this: free fall. Deprived of both human and divine aids, unsup- ported either in fact or in theory, in matter or in spirit, but still prey to the old, old needs, man undergoes a loss of species. So doing, he slips quickly back through Cartesian clarity and dis- tinctness, through Scotic faith, selfhood, identity, and dignity, to rejoin ("forgotten") the beasts whence he sprang.21 Still retaining the outward signs of his humanity, his battered bowl- er, knock knees, and rotten teeth, he has nevertheless lost his rank or rung in the universe, and he has become its laughing- stock in the process. Watt has kept the external form, it is true, but it is now no longer, in Fuller's words above, of the very nature of the Form to be particularized. The definition of Watt must now be phrased in much the same terms as are those puzzling incidents at Mr Knott's house (74), "of great formal brilliance and indeterminable purport." This is what it means to undergo (44) "the reversed metamorphosis. The Laurel into Daphne. The old thing where it always was, back again." This cosmic game, this huge practical joke played by the universe on the beings that people it, is obscurely reenacted in the tragi-comic terms of the threne. From generation to gen- eration, the voices seem to say, man slips through life in a kind of r.music-hall routine, an excitingly tedious drama reminiscent of much that happens (or fails to happen) in "Waiting for Godot." What Watt hears is the patter of vaudeville: how do you do blooming thanks and you drooping thanks and you withered thanks and you. To the accompaniment of seemingly inane exchanges, humanity dwindles away through division and inanition into tedium and forgottenness. From greatgran ma Ma raised to the third power - "Ma" seems to be simultaneously the cube of the root as well as the cute of the roob (187)22 - through the bloom and prom- 20 See Kenner, pp. 87ff. and 96ff. 21 I strongly suspect that the repeated "forgotten" in the threne is a reference to the loss of man in quantum theory (another step in human alienation), but neither space nor competence permits exploration of this suspicion. 22 The reference here invokes the entire diversion of the academic ex- amination of a vaguely obscene Mr Nackybal who can apparently arrive instinctively at the cube of any root. The vignette is the Watt story 276 Wisconsin Studies</page><page sequence="17">ise of Christmas (perhaps), man withers and fades until, in the true seriocomic routine of the music-hall, he bows out elaborate- ly at the end. With the wretched drollery of "thanks and you," his reason still racing, he shuffles off the ill-lit stage into obliv- ion. But oblivion is naught, the home of Knott, the home for Watt, and his end is only another beginning. In a year all is said (132) and in Watt's place comes Micks (the sons of man) to retrace over and over again the not quite circular whirligig of Watt's misery.23 It happens to all men free to undertake the quest: ontogeny repeats philogeny, as the psychologists like to say, the history of the individual repeats the history of the race. Those who are not free to follow the Cartesian gleam, the Mr Spiros and Lady McCanns of this world, almost instinctively abominate such a representative of contemporary atavism as Watt. Mr Spiro's names, recalling as they do the old comfortable tag or motto Dum spiro, spero, imply a certain confidence about existence denied to those under the mandate of the Cogito, and Lady McCann is a "catholic and military" (31) being who can serenely remain in bed on Sundays (240), "receiving there the mass, and other meals and visitors." Assured of certain cer- tainties by faith and traditions, they resent and reject the implications of his identity, and, after the first fails to modify Watt's views or state, the second casts the first stone.24 But stones and blows can no more affect his destiny than they can change the meaning of past history. And so, courage- ously going on to serve out his full sentence to life (52.28571428- 57142 - theoretically it never ends), Watt-man finishes up dum, num, blin: the human condition par excellence. "11 pleure, donc ii vit," says Hamm in "Fin de Partie," and both this proposition and its converse seem to apply equally well to Watt. He lives only to suffer a grotesque fate, so grotesque that only by his weeping may he be said to live. The last sight the narrator has of him (which is not quite the reader's last sight of him) shows him floundering backwards through brambles, falling, unmur- in small (Watt is even at one point - p. 132 - identified with Nacky- bal), for Nackybal is a fraud: he can arrive at no truths at all through his mathematical intuitions as a Visicelt and so is doomed to fail to enlighten the Cartesian sons (Mac. . . , Mc. .., Fitz. . . , de, O'. .. and... shon) who examine him. 23 I have neglected the not irrelevant symbolism of the broken circle in Watt. But see Cohn, Beckett, pp. 79, 93; Hoffman, p. 119; and Kenner, pp. 104-114. 24 In this paragraph I am much indebted to my colleagues Professors Geoffrey Durrant and Jack Woodbury, to the first for informing me of the existence and probable relevance of the Latin tag, and to the second for helping me to understand better certain aspects of the movement and effect of the threne.

We never see this suffering hobo of the spirit arrive at his destination, but we may be sure that along the way tears are falling steadily over his clown's face. His is truly, comically, heroically, "the dark mind stumbling through barren lands" (250). But he is at least stumbling. By the time his metamorphosis reverses him into the Unnamable, he will have been completely immobilized in his ashcan. 278 Wisconsin Studies</page></plain_text>
