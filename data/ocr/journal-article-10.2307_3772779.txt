<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marriage and Malevolence: The Uses of Sexual Opposition in a Hindu Pantheon1 Lawrence A. Babb Amherst College This study is concerned with the role of goddess-worship in a regional vari- ant of popular Hinduism. The setting is the Chhattisgarh region of eastern Madhya Pradesh. One of the most striking aspects of Chhattisgarhi religious belief and practice is a high degree of concern with specifically feminine deities. Many of the major temple complexes of Raipur, the premier city of the region, are goddess temples, and in Chhattisgarhi villages the largest and most central shrine is usually devoted to a goddess of local signiflcance. One season of the year?the hot season?is dominated by goddess-worship, and, in fact, goddesses play an important role in religious ceremonial through much of the Chhattisgarhi sacred year. From these facts alone it is clear that the role of the goddess must be a crucial consideration in any analy? sis of Chhattisgarhi religion. In this paper I would like to suggest that in Chhattisgarhi belief the concept of the goddess provides a key element in a cosmological pattern which is basic to Chhattisgarhi religion at all levels. More specifically, the distinction between masculine and feminine divinity underlies an ordering principle which integrates a very broad range of Chhattisgarhi supernatur- alism, from notions of witchcraft to complexes of belief and practice center- ing on the highest deities of the pantheon. Of central concern here is the notion of divinity and the modes of its trans- formation. The key to the various forms and qualities which divinity ac- quires in Chhattisgarhi belief is the manner in which it is differentiated. There is, of course, a level in Hindu belief in which divinity appears in un- differentiated form. Sophisticated Chhattisgarhi informants speak of paramd- tma, the all-pervasive, undifferentiated world-soul of philosophical Hin? duism. But paramdtma is a notion which rarely intrudes into popular be? lief and practice; it is seen, by those who understand it, as inert, an object of contemplation, not of worship. Paramdtma, divinity in the most abstract sense, becomes active in the affairs of the universe and men only when it is differentiated into particular and concrete supernatural beings. With this differentiation we move down from a highly intellectualized philosophical level in Hinduism to traditions of everyday religiosity. It is the mode of this differentiation within the pantheon which provides 137</page><page sequence="2">138 Ethnology the substance of this analysis. Basically, there seem to be two different qualities or transmutations of divinity operating in the world of Chhat- tisgarhi Hindus. One is essentially protective and benevolent, the other the very embodiment of malevolence when unrestrained or unappeased. At the most abstract level these doubtless represent two aspects of the same thing, a notion of potential "force" or "power" intrinsic to the very concept of the sacred. But in myth and ritual there is a bifurcation into what appears to be a sex-linked opposition, an opposition which emerges in the distinction be? tween devta and devi, "god" and "goddess." The Goddess of the Text Broadly speaking, there are two levels on which Chhattisgarhi religion may be analyzed. First, there is a level of belief and ritual in Chhattisgarh which, following established precedent, I term "Sanskritic." At this level Sanskrit texts and the Brahman priesthood are central, and ritual patterns are involved which are subcontinental in distribution. Second, one may speak of a major category of religious belief and practice in Chhattisgarh which is essentially "non-Sanskritic." It is found primarily, though not exclusively, in rural areas, and it centers on a non-Brahman priesthood and regional lore and usage. I shall discuss the role of the goddess first at the Sanskritic level, and then move on to a consideration of her non-Sanskritic counterpart. While it is possible to speak of a Sanskritic level in Chhattisgarhi religion, a complex of beliefs and ritual modes sanctioned in scripture and focusing on the Brahman priest, it is also possible to separate this level into constituent units, or sub-complexes. Each of these sub-complexes has as its focus a par? ticular deity, or array of deities, and the body of texts in which these deities are revealed and their characteristics defined. Each sub-complex often has a physical locus as well in regional temple centers. Often, too, there are par? ticular rituals or festivals which serve as primary expressions of a given sub- complex. There is, for example, such a sub-complex which centers on Rama and his ancillary deities: Sita, Lakshman, and Hanuman. Its basic text is the Ramdyana, and in Chhattisgarh its primary physical focus is the Dudha- dhari Math in Raipur, a major regional temple center and monastery. It has certain central rituals as well, those of rdmnavmi and dassehrd. Similarly, at the Sanskritic level there is such a sub-complex, or "cult" if you will, focusing on a series of goddesses, each considered to be a separate manifestation of Devi, "the goddess." Like the Rama sub-com? plex, the cult of the goddess has a principal body of scripture, a set of physical loci in certain major temple centers, and a set of typical rituals, the most important ceremonials being those of the navrdtra or "nine-nights" periods in the lunar months of chaitra (March-April) and hunvar (Septem- ber-October). Although the goddess is represented in other cults as well, it is within her own that she emerges with the finest degree of definition. At this textual level the most important context for the goddess is to be found in her principal (in Chhattisgarh) body of scripture. This is the Shrl Durga Saptashati, a sacred text of 700 Sanskrit mantras devoted to the</page><page sequence="3">Sexual Opposition in a Hindu Pantheon 139 goddess in a number of manifestations. The text is chanted in the temples of the goddess and in private homes, particularly during the navrdtra periods. It is, in fact, an essential item in goddess-oriented ritual and belief at the Sanskritic level. It is important to realize that the Saptashati, like all Hindu texts, has really two levels of signiflcance. It has, first of all, a kind of intrinsic magical potency: the chanting of the mantras of which it is composed is a way of tapping the supernatural power represented by the goddess. But the man? tras have real meaning as well, as together they constitute one of the prin? cipal scriptural delineations of the nature of the goddess. The text is to be understood as well as chanted, and consequently in the editions available in the Raipur bazaar the Sanskrit mantras are given together with their Hindi translation. The text explains the nature of the goddess?provides a context for her in the belief system as a whole?and when I asked the pujari (caretaker-priest) of the principal goddess temple of Raipur city for "the story of the goddess" it was this text which he recommended. Apart from a leavening of pious excess, the text is a straightforward ac? count of how and under what circumstances the goddess came into the world. We learn that the goddess came at a time of great crisis in the affairs of the gods. At a time remote in the past, the supremacy of the gods was threatened by the rise of a powerful race of demons, the asuras. Many battles were fought, the issue going this way and that, until it finally became clear that the gods were the weaker of the two contending groups and faced im- minent defeat. Thus, to preserve the world order it was necessary for the gods to awaken a kind of terrible force with which to confront the demons. This force emerged in a succession of goddesses, the first of which was formed from the tangible anger of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva?anger which ap- peared as a blinding light emanating from their faces. The battle between the gods and the asuras was a protracted one and lasted, intermittently, for many ages. On successive occasions when the gods were upon the point of being overcome by the asuras, the goddess manifested herself and came to their aid. Though various, her manifestations all em- bodied an irresistible power. The most terrible of her forms was Kall: "Bearing the strange skull-topped staff, decorated with a garland of skulls, clad in a tiger's skin, very appalling owing to her emaciated flesh, with gap- ing mouth, fearful with her tongue lolling out, having deep-sunk reddish eyes and filling the regions of the sky with her roars . . ." (Shri Durgd Saptashati, ch. vii, lines 7-9, from Jagadisvarananda 1953:95). The notion that the essence of the goddess is a kind of force is explicitly expressed in one of her commonest names, shahti, which means literally "energy" or "force." The idea has its most elaborate development, and exaggeration, in the doctrines of the shdkta philosophers who contrast the feminine shatyi with purusha, "the male principle" (see Woodroffe 1951). To this school of philosophy, whose principal concern is the explication of the mysteries surrounding the goddess, the male principle is essentially passive, while shakti is the activating force, these being the basic constitu- ents of the phenomenal world.</page><page sequence="4">140 Ethnology Quite apart from philosophical elaboration, it seems clear that in the rel? evant texts a distinction is made between the qualities of masculine and feminine divinity. While the gods of scripture could hardly be called passive, they seem almost benign in the shadow of the goddess of the Saptashati. The goddess represents a terrible and almost sinister force, all the more sinister by comparison with the gods. While the gods are very powerful beings themselves, they seem at the same time to be essentially magnifications of human beings?human beings who make mistakes, who can be defeated, and who are often motivated by very human emotions, often to anger, but often to mercy and benevolence as well. As she is represented in the Sap? tashati, the only discernible emotion of the goddess is anger?black, im- placable, and bloodthirsty. She is something of which the gods are made, emerging as she did from the highest gods as the very essence of their anger, but once unleashed this sha\ti seems more powerful, certainly more ter? rible, than her creators. Yet we must carefully note that if the goddess emerges in differentiation from the gods, then in the end she is of the gods, an idea which suggests a sense of potential restraint and control, It is to the circumstances of control that we now turn. To begin with, if approached in the correct fashion the goddess, even in her most terrible manifestations, will serve the ends of men, and the Sap? tashati includes many hymns designed to flatter her into co-operation with her devotees. But beyond this, there appear to be circumstances under which the sha\ti which the goddess embodies is restrained or redirected into some? thing really different. The Saptashati {Shri Durga Saptashati, ch. xii, lines 39-40, from Jagadisvarananda 1953:159-160) describes the goddess in all her manifestations as follows: She indeed takes the form of the great destroyer at the [proper] time/ She, the unborn, indeed becomes this creation . . . she herself, the eternal Being, sustains the beings at [another] time/ In times of prosperity she indeed is Lakshmi, who bestows prosperity in the homes of men; and in times of misfortune, she herself becomes the goddess of misfortune, and brings about ruin. This, perhaps, is the central mystery of Devi: that the goddess is at once Kali, the destroyer, and Lakshmi, the bestower of wealth and happiness. What, we must now ask, is the context in which the goddess truly becomes Lakshmi ? There is a widely known story which seems to indicate in what direction the answer might lie. It is said that, after her defeat of the asuras, Kali went on a bloody rampage, a mindless spree of killing that threatened both gods and men alike. She could not be stopped until Shiva lay in her path. She was on the point of killing him when she recoiled in horror, suddenly realizing that she had almost killed her husband. This brings us to a critical feature of the relationship between god and goddess, that of marriage, and to critical pairing in the Hindu pantheon, that of Shiva and Parvatl. The Hindu pantheon is an extremely fluid array of supernatural beings, and tends to alter in form as one context is replaced by another. In some con- texts particular deities are seen as discrete entities, and under other circum? stances deities merge with one another and their characteristics blend. At the</page><page sequence="5">Sexual Opposition in a Hindu Pantheon 141 most abstract level differentiation disappears altogether, resulting in the frequently heard Hindu truism that "all gods are one." It is thus possible to say that the goddess, in the most abstract sense, is both married and not married. That she is married follows from the premise that all goddesses are one, as indeed all gods are one, and the fact that in some of her manifestations she is quite explicitly married. Kall, informants say, represents a form of Parvati, who is Shiva's wife, and who, in turn, is all the goddesses, whether explicitly married or not. Yet it is clear that there is a sense in which we may speak of the goddess as having both married and unmarried, or at least not explicitly married, forms. The criterion is the ritual and iconographic context in which various mani? festations of the goddess appear. The goddess as Parvati or Sita appears in popular iconography in a matrimonial context, standing beside and subordinate to her husband. While Lakshml usually appears alone, she is explicitly understood to be Vishnu's wife. But the goddess as Durga, Ma- hamaya, Kall, etc.?the bloodthirsty goddess of the Saptashati?never ap? pears in a matrimonial context, but rather alone, and surrounded by the paraphernalia of killing. Further, we shall see shortly that the goddess in these forms is identified closely with the local goddesses of Chhattisgarh, who are never thought of as married. It is in these "unmarried" manifesta? tions that the goddess may, in Chhattisgarh and presumably elsewhere, receive blood sacrifice, quite in keeping with her combative and bloodthirsty nature. But as the consort of any of the gods the goddess seems to undergo a kind of transformation into what is almost the antithesis of the Devi of the Saptashati. As Parvati, Lakshml, Sita, or Savitri she becomes a benevolent goddess, a giver of wealth and progeny, and an exemplar of passive devo- tion to her husband. In Chhattisgarh, the goddess in these manifestations never receives blood sacrifice. Involved in the transformation between the sinister and the domesticated goddess is an intriguing reversal of the male-female pairing. The substance of this reversal finds particularly clear expression in certain aspects of temple architecture. In a Rama temple, Sita is always standing beside her husband in the attitude of the dutiful wife. Shiva and Parvati are not worshiped in anthropomorphic form in Shiva temples, but when they are pictured to? gether in lithographs, Parvati, again, is standing beside her consort in a sub- missive attitude. But when the goddess stands in her terrible aspect in a temple there is no god by her side. Rather, in the Mahamaya Mandir, Rai? pur 's largest and most important goddess-temple, the two deities associated with the goddess are Lal Bhairo and Kal Bhairo (Red and Black Bhairo). These are two rather sinister-looking images standing outside and to either side of the door leading into the goddess's inner shrine. Bhairo, the pujari of the temple says, is none other than Shiva in a \rodh rup, a "terrible form." Here Shiva is subordinate to the goddess. He is no longer portrayed as her husband, but, in the pujarYs words, as "her bodyguard." No longer ascendant, Shiva becomes the instrument of the goddess, and his character? istics become submerged in hers. In this form he takes blood sacrifice. As Shiva he never does.</page><page sequence="6">142 Ethnology At the "Sanskritic" level, then, we can see two pairings of god and goddess, the union of Shiva and Parvati being in some sense the critical medium of tranformation between them. In one pairing god and goddess appear un- ambiguously as husband and wife. In this pairing the god is represented as dominant, the goddess as dutifully subordinate, and the goddess?indeed, the pairing as a unit?is benign. The Rama-Sita pairing is, to be sure, very powerful, but power here has a rather different quality from that exempli- fied by Kali or Mahamaya. These are, to begin with, vegetarian deities; they never received blood sacrifice, insisting instead on "pure" offerings of flowers or vegetarian foods. But perhaps more important, there are powerful ethical qualities attaching to deities of this kind. Rama, for example, exemplifies benevolent kingship; Sita is held to be the very model of wifely virtues. In the other pairing the goddess is ascendant. If the god appears at all, it is not in the role of husband but of henchman and servant, and the pairing as a unit takes on the awesome attributes of the goddess herself. The goddess in this form is conceived not primarily as an exemplar of societal virtues, but as an embodiment of an impersonal force, a force which can be used, but which may be dangerous to the user. She may be flattered into co-operation with her devotees, but a dominant theme in her worship is appeasement of her bloodthirst. "The Devi likes blood," informants say, and even in vege^ tarian houses when the goddess is worshipped in this form she is given red flowers in recognition of her appetites. Most important, there is an ex- plicit identification of the goddess in this form with supernatural agencies of disease causation, which is not true of the Rama-Sita pairing. I shall re? turn to this point shortly. Interestingly, then, we seem to be at a point of juncture between religious symbolism and social structure.2 Within the pantheon a very dangerous force is symbolized, but this is a force which seems to undergo a basic trans- formation into something almost anti-sinister, the loving wife, the source of wealth and offspring, when placed within the context of an appropri- ately restraining social relationship, that of marriage. An appetite for con? flict and destruction is thus transformed into the most fundamental of social virtues. Underlying this transformation is a dual notion of divinity, a dual- ity which in turn is linked to the opposition between male and female. When the feminine dominates the masculine the pair is sinister; when male dom- inates female the pair is benign. The Goddess of Experience The goddess also plays an important, in some ways central, role at the non- Sanskritic level in Chhattisgarhi religion. At the outset it should be made clear that there is a basic and entirely overt identification between the non- Sanskritic goddess and her great-traditional counterpart; indeed the goddess represents the most important point of intersection between great and little traditions in Chhattisgarhi religion. Informants are quite explicit about the identification between the local goddesses and the goddesses of textual tra- dition. I have been told time and again that the Mata (the mother, the non-</page><page sequence="7">Sexual Opposition in a Hindu Pantheon 143 Sanskritic goddess by one of her commonest names) is really the same as Kall or Mahamaya. Moreover, the non-Sanskritic goddess shares certain symbols with the goddess of scripture. A Shitla (smallpox goddess) temple in Raipur is decorated with representations of lions, the lion being Durga's vehicle and ally in battle. The trishul (Shiva's trident) is almost always rep- resented in goddess-shrines in the villages, suggesting an identification with Parvati. Finally, and most important, there are shared ritual contexts. The local goddesses of Chhattisgarh are key figures in a great variety of ceremonials, but their most important rites occur twice each year during the navrdtra periods of chaitra and \unvar. These, as I have indicated, are also ceremonial periods of major importance to the great-traditional goddess. The navrdtra rites of the Chhattisgarhi villages are known as javdra. Essentially, javdra consists of the ritual planting and tending of wheat on special platforms pre? pared for the occasion both in individual houses and in the shrines of the local goddesses. The seedlings are allowed to grow for nine days, and at the conclusion of navrdtra they are taken in procession to bodies of water where they are "cooled" (thanda \arna) by immersion. Conspicuous fea? tures of the rites include the sacrifice of goats, possession, and the ritualized exchange of the "cooled" seedlings between men as a sign of special amity at the end of the sequence. The only point to be stressed here is that pre- cisely the same sequence of rites takes place in the temples of the Sanskritic goddesses in Raipur during navrdtra, despite the fact that the rites of javdra do not, to my knowledge, have any scriptural sanction. It is clear, then, that there is a very close identification indeed between the local, non-Sanskritic goddesses and the goddesses of textual tradition. The local goddesses in Chhattisgarh are known by a wide variety of names, some of which are peculiar to individual villages. The local goddess is sometimes known as Shitla, "the cool one," an ironic designation because, as we shall see shortly, the goddess in this form is strongly associated with heat. She is also known as Mata, "the mother," and she is sometimes referred to as "the seven sisters" or "the twenty-one sisters." Whatever their names, all the local goddesses seem to have certain crucial features in common. Perhaps the most important shared characteristic is a close association with one of the darkest areas of human experience. Specifi? cally, the goddess is herself regarded as the active agent in one of the most virulent of human diseases, smallpox, and is closely associated with other malevolent supernatural forces as well. The goddess is sometimes said to be responsible for fever and cholera, but smallpox, of all human afflictions, is most unambiguously within her jurisdiction. The disease, in fact, is quite literally equated with the goddess, in the sense that a case of smallpox is treated as an instance of possession by the goddess. In Chhattisgarh, smallpox is primarily a hot season disease, and conceptions of the disease are also strongly tied to themes of heat and heat- ing.3 Shitla, as I have said, means "the cool one," but in fact she is "the one who must be cooled." One of her principal manifestations is the fever of the patient, and when she is present in the house various restrictions involving</page><page sequence="8">144 Ethnology heat or heating must be observed. Oil, for example, must not be heated in her vicinity lest she become even more malignant. In general, smallpox is treated by placating the goddess who is believed to be within the patient. Treatment consists of a complex of activities known as mata sevd, or "the service of the mother." The goddess may be worshiped by washing the patient's feet in milk. Often the goddess speaks through the mouth of the patient, requesting particular types of food. All such requests must be honored. Since the goddess, not the patient, is speaking, these ut- terances are often thought to be oracular in nature. One hears numerous ac- counts of smallpox patients who are able to describe events taking place elsewhere. Certain things may enrage the goddess and make the patient worse. She hates the sight of a pregnant woman, and such women must be kept away from the patient. She is also said to dislike the sight of a mar? ried couple, so husband and wife must enter the room separately. A major part of the treatment of the patient consists in making the goddess "cool." The patient himself is cooled, and in cooling him the goddess who is in- side him is made cool also. This may be done by fanning, but it is usually done by applying water. Whether the patient is fanned or washed, the leaves of the nim tree, itself considered to be intrinsically cold, must play some part in the treatment. They can be fashioned into a fan, or may be used to apply water to the patient. Smallpox, then, represents a direct intrusion of the goddess into the lives of her worshipers. She is involved in other hazards of life as well, though here, perhaps, her involvement is less direct. Witchcraft and malignant ghosts are conceived to constitute a substantial danger to humankind, and these phe- nomena, too, appear to be linked to conceptions of feminine divinity. Witchcraft and ghosts are part of an entire complex of belief and practice concerned with diagnostics and therapeutics which is in the hands of a type of non-Brahman priest known as the baigd. In Chhattisgarh it is the baigd who is conventionally the priest, though in a very informal sense, of the vil? lage deities. When the occasion arises, the baigd handles the mechanics of the pujd of these deities on behalf of the village, and their shrines are regarded as his special province. But perhaps the most important role of the baigd is that of diagnostician and curer. As the familiar of the village deities, it is often he to whom they come to warn of disease or other misfortune coming to the village. He also has a knowledge of special mantras (magical utter- ances) which he employs in the curing of illnesses. Some of these illnesses are understood to have "natural" causes, and others are conceived to be sup- ernatural in origin. Of the variety of supernaturally caused illnesses, we have already ex- amined one, smallpox, in some detail. There seem to be other instances of sickness which are similarly attributed to possession by malignant fem? inine supernaturals. Apparently any of an assortment of diseases which in- volve red eruptions on the skin may be attributed to a goddess, and illness in young children is frequently said to be due to the influence of a demoness known as churalin (thought to originate as the ghost of a woman who died in childbirth). But there is a sizable residue of illness which is believed to be</page><page sequence="9">Sexual Opposition in a Hindu Pantheon 145 caused by witchcraft or possession by ghosts, and these, specifically, are instances which fall under the jurisdiction of the baigd. The techniques of diagnosis are variable in the extreme. Madness seems invariably to be ascribed to witchcraft, to ghosts, or to some combination of both. Otherwise, long illnesses that are resistant to other forms of treat? ment are often ultimately assigned to this category. According to the baigd who acted as my principal informant in these matters, it is difficult to point to any particular symptom. The patient often has a kind of sadness in his demeanor which he, the baigd, is able to see. Beyond this, there are certain tests which may be applied to the patient, of which the following is an example. A string is tied around the toe of the patient and the other end is tied around his head in such a way that it is drawn tight when the leg is at a right angle to the torso. The string is then measured seven times. If the pa? tient is under attack by a witch, the string will appear to measure shorter each time. The complex of belief surrounding the witch is unambiguously feminine in its associations. Every concrete instance of witchcraft which has come to my attention has been attributed to a woman or a girl, never to a man. The word for witch in Hindi and its Chhattisgarhi dialect is tonhi, a feminine noun. The word can be masculinized to tonhd, but one rarely hears the word in this form in any but the hypothetical sense. When asked if men ever had similar powers, informants replied in the affirmative, but said that such a man would be a guniya, a priest-sorcerer who uses his powers in the service of victims of witchcraft. It is said that by day a witch is a perfectly ordinary woman, indistinguish- able from other women in her appearance and manner. She may, however, give herself away by staring at people in a peculiar fashion. By night the witch appears to take on the attributes of a supernatural being, having supernatural powers of perception, movement, and attack. Witches may at? tack their victims in various ways. They may send ghosts to possess their victims, they may put poisons in their victims' foods, they may bring an epidemic on a community by magically poisoning a water source, and they may attack individual victims by means of the evil eye (nazar lagna). During the night (especially on two nights of the year which are consid? ered witches' Sabbaths) witches are said to congregate at cemeteries or burning grounds where they perform a kind of dance, which informants liken to possession, as a way of worshiping certain malignant deities. It is here that the folklore of witchcraft points to connections, apparent in any event, with feminine divinity. Some informants have told me that the witches dance in worship of the goddess. Interestingly, this image has an al? most exact textual counterpart. The great-traditional goddess, as Kall, is at- tended by the dd\anis, "female imps, eaters of raw flesh" (Danielou 1964: 288). Witches appear to stand in a similar relationship with the goddess, and they too are "eaters of raw flesh" in the sense that witches, informants say, are insatiable drinkers of human blood. An alternative version holds that the witches go to the burning grounds to make a special pact with Bhairo, who, as the reader will recall, is a fierce manifestation of Shiva linked to the</page><page sequence="10">146 Ethnology goddess. The witches dance before Bhairo while nude. Bhairo is pleased by this and asks them what they want. The witches tell the god that they wish to take a specified number of lives. A bargain is then struck; Bhairo allows them to do as they want if, in return, they agree to give some of the blood to him. Malignant ghosts {bhut, as opposed to pitri, the benevolent spirits of an? cestors) are also linked to feminine divinity. They are sometimes conceived to be the servants of the witches. Moreover, there seems to be an identification between malignant ghosts and Bhairo. Bhairo, a baigd told me, is himself a ghost, "the sarddr [chieftain] of ghosts." Thus, the baigd explains, an es- sential step in exorcising ghosts is the worship of Bhairo. Finally, it is not without significance that the most malignant of the ghosts are female. Of all ghosts, the most dangerous is churalin. She is the spirit of a woman who has died in childbirth, and she is thought to be driven by a thirst for the blood of young children. The non-Sanskritic level of Chhattisgarhi religion is not without pro- tective deities as well. Of these, the most important is a godling known as Thakur Dev who is conceived to be the protector of villages. He is of spe? cial interest here because of his relationship with the goddess. This relation? ship is almost contradictory. On one hand, he is regarded as the servant of the goddess. In the village which was the site of my field work in Chhattis? garh, Thakur Dev is represented by a pile of stones lying directly in front of the door leading into the shrine of the village goddess. Thus Thakur Dev stands in a relationship to the village goddess which is precisely analogous to the relationship between Lal and Kal Bhairo and the goddess in the major goddess temple in Raipur. But at the same time, Thakur Dev is said to be the protector of the village. His real locus is thought to be outside the village, from which vantage he can guard the boundaries of the village from sinister intrusions. "Thakur Dev," an informant told me, "is like the peon of the Mata. Just as the Sahib's peon will come to warn us that the Sahib is coming, so will Thakur Dev warn us that the Mata is coming, and that we must worship her." Thakur Dev will protect people from the Mata, the same in? formant went on to say, if he is worshiped himself. But people are forgetful, and remember him only in time of trouble. Thus sickness comes to the vil? lage. The Goddess and Continuity in Hindu Tradition Differences between the Sanskritic and non-Sanskritic levels in Chhattis? garhi religion are superficially obvious. The two levels center on different types of religious specialists and on ostensibly different sets of deities (al? though some deities, of which Hanuman4 is a good example, may figure prominently at both levels). Yet, despite these differences, there seems to be a basic continuity between the two levels. This continuity emerges in a cos- mological pattern common to both. At each level divinity appears to be manifest in two separate aspects, feminine and masculine, goddess and god. In general, masculine divinity seems to act as a restraining factor, while feminine divinity is a potentially</page><page sequence="11">Sexual Opposition in a Hindu Pantheon 147 destructive force which must be restrained. If one takes as a point of ref- erence the Sanskritic level as a whole, then the goddess must be viewed as the subordinate member of the pair, her more terrible aspects apparently subdued by marriage. By contrast, the non-Sanskritic goddess is never rep- resented as married. Here she is ascendant, standing alone in the largest temple of the village, and here, ultimately, she is the master of the protec? tive god. Thakur Dev and the baigd can protect humankind, but this pro? tection is ephemeral, no final submission of the goddess, reflecting, surely, the very uncertainties of life in rural Chhattisgarh. What then, are we to make of the differences between the Sanskritic and the non-Sanskritic levels in Chhattisgarhi religion? They are different, yet in certain fundamental respects the same. Dumont and Pocock (1959:45) have provided a useful formulation in characterizing the differences between the Sanskritic and non-Sanskritic levels as amounting to two different ways "of saying the same things," the Sanskritic idiom being the more prestigious of the two, just as "pure" Hindi carries more prestige than its Chhattis? garhi dialect. Yet, despite the greater prestige of Sanskritic ritual, the non-Sanskritic complex persists in Chhattisgarh, and it seems likely that its persistence is a result of its therapeutic orientation. Seemingly, the system requires the minor supernaturals to explain and to deal with this area of human experi- ence. The Sanskritic deities, on the other hand, are somewhat more remote from this realm of everyday experience. While it is true that the people of Chhattisgarh frequently resort to the Sanskritic deities and Sanskritic rituals for purely material ends, there seems, nevertheless, to be a real sense in which the Sanskritic level in Chhattisgarhi religion is linked to "transcendental" concerns (see Mandelbaum 1966). It is at this level that ethical concerns be? come salient, and it is at this level too that popular belief articulates with the classical Hindu salvation ideologies. It is clear, however, that in these func- tional differences we are dealing with complementation and not radical dis- continuity. Given the key role of renunciation in Hindu salvation doctrines it is surely significant that the concept of the goddess provides an equation in which prosperity (Lakshml) is linked with destruction (Kall), with dis? ease (Shitla and the other minor goddesses), and finally with illusion (Ma- hamaya, meaning literally "the great illusion"). We may speak of Chhat? tisgarhi religion as a single system of belief characterized by functional complementation combined with cosmological economy. The same opposi? tion pervades the system, but a qualitative transformation in the opposition is accomplished by the use of a mediating conception: marriage. With the idea that we are dealing with two different ways "of saying the same thing" we would concur, adding only "for very different purposes." NOTES i. This represents a revised version of a paper presented at the Seminar on Religion and Myth in South Asia held at the State University of New York at Binghamton on April 12, 1968. I am indebted to all the participants for helpful criticisms. I would also like to thank Arnold L. Green for his comments and encouragement. The field work on</page><page sequence="12">148 Ethnology which this study is based was carried out between August, 1966, and November, 1967, in Madhya Pradesh, India. The research was supported by a grant from the Foreign Area Fellowship Program. Final responsibility for all conclusions, of course, rests with me. 2. In an extremely interesting article Edward Harper has suggested that among Havik Brahmans guilt arising from the low status of women accounts for general conceptions of feminine malignancy. Harper (1969:86) notes that ". . . female deities are, in gen? eral, regarded as more dangerous and malicious than are male deities." 3. Brenda Beck (1968) has pointed to associations between the goddess and conceptions of heat in South India. She links the heat associated with the goddess to the classical notion of tapas, or ritual heat, which, significantly, is generated by sexual abstinence. 4. Hanuman is portrayed in the Ramayana as a monkey-chieftain who was Rama's prin? cipal servant and ally in battle. He is a very popular deity in North and Central India, and there are indications that he may be replacing Thakur Dev as the major protec- tive god in rural Chhattisgarh. BIBLIOGRAPHY Beck, B. E.
