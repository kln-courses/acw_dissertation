<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bird study in the mid-south.-Will Hon. 1963. Nashville, Tennessee Game and Fish Commission. Pp. 1-92, 5 color pls., many black-and-white illus. 81/2 X 11 in. Paper. $1.50.-In this elementary introduction to bird study in Tennessee and vicinity, the author has used a "habitat approach" to acquaint the reader not only with the commonest birds of the area but also with the concept that ecological re- quirements determine the type of habitat a species will be found in at any given time of year. Thus the book is organized into units such as "woodland birds in winter" and "the Alleghenian zone in summer," with emphasis on behavior, nesting require- ments, and food habits rather than on plumages and field marks. Interspersed with these habitat-oriented accounts are several short discussions on a variety of related topics: migration, bird-banding, territoriality, etc. Generally the book has a high incidence of typographical, grammatical, and factual errors; the latter are particularly evident in the biological discussions, where the author occasionally displays a lack of understanding of his topic. To mention only a few of the many errors found: it is not true that "all wrens" are "box nesters" (pp. 87-88), nor are bluebirds, as a species, non-migratory (pp. 32 and 55-56); hor- mones are not "special fluids in the body" (p. 54) nor is the function of territorial song to ". . . tell the world about the fine family they are raising" (p. 14). In several attempts at simplification for his amateur audience, the author has ended with a statement that is either too vague to be meaningful or overgeneralized to the point of inaccuracy: for instance, "Bird lice . . . sometimes become a human problem where birds nest in house eaves or attics" (p. 38). Anyone who has handled a re- cently abandoned phoebe nest and been inundated with its mites (not lice) will ap- preciate the author's intention, but his statement, as worded, leaves a false impres-</page><page sequence="2">116 Reviews L Vol.82 sion that bird lice will also feed on man. In view of the intended readership, many of the anthropomorphic phrases may be overlooked but on p. 54 the author valiantly attempts to explain the fallacies of teleology and then finds it necessary to invoke the "planning" of "the Creator" instead. In many other cases he sidesteps both teleological and biological explanations by the use or misuse of the all-encompassing but highly inadequate word "instinct": "The mockingbird is acting through instinct, and he acts differently than a myrtle warbler at the feeding station because the two have very different instincts" (p. 14). The book is liberally illustrated by the author with cartoons, marginal sketches of varying quality, and a few formal plates. Several additional plates, including excellent black-and-white drawings by Charles Schwartz, Ned Smith, and Bob Hines are re- printed from other sources. These illustrations form an unfortunate contrast to the very poor color plates by Jacob Bates Abbott.-MARY A. HEIMERDINGER.</page></plain_text>
