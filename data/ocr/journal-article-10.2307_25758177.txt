In the art market, the word original' is countered by the terms 'fake,"forgery,"copy'or 'imita tion.'The distinction between straightforward originals and forgeries however, is quite clear-cut. I am more interested in exploring nuanced terms often used as synonyms of'imitation by writers attempting to either affirm or debunk the notion that non-metropolitan Indian arts lack originality. Metropolitan art being art that is produced in city and town centres and displayed in cultural institutions, non-metropolitan arts' is an umbrella term for folk, tribal and ritual art. Despite clear distinctions among these three arts, the umbrella term - also called 'traditional arts' in this essay - becomes appropriate because they are collectively deemed inferior to metropolitan arts. The first part of this paper draws on art-historical and critical writing to support my assertion that there exists a clear hierarchy in Indian arts. It also identifies theoretical frameworks within which previous debates have taken place. The second part questions the assumptions that lead to the perceived hierarchy of metropolitan over traditional arts. Two misunderstand ings, I believe, contribute to the notion that traditional arts lack innovativeness. The first is to assume that these arts are invariably repetitive/ their practitioners merely 'imitating' what their predecessors did. The &lt; Balu Vyada.

While the latter tend to learn by imitation experience, the former usually learn through study and theory. As the literature cited in the first part only substantiates the presumption that traditional arts are repetitive, I focus on this misunderstanding in the latter half of this essay. It is by exploring the semantics of contemporary Indian arts discourse that this paper challenges our underlying conceptions of what consti tutes originality or innovativeness in visual art. Although I refer to various Indian arts, I use specific examples from my primary research - a tribal art school in Madhya Pradesh (central India) and the floor drawing tradition of Andhra Pradesh (south India). These illustrations hint at the distinctions among traditional arts. Lastly, in discussing the valuation of Indian arts, I pay particular attention to their socio economic contexts and the art market s pervasive influ ence on this valuation. Dichotomies and hierarchies There is a conspicuous absence of representation of traditional arts in contemporary Indian arts discourse, with the few available discussions being pigeonholed in special issues. Moreover, such theme issues carry art historical debates that remain consistently broad and generalised, featuring no prominent critiques of indi vidual traditional artists. It is of course problematic to presume that any group of people require representation, be they the colonized in colonial administrations, women in chau vinistic societies, adherents to oral traditions in predominantly literate worlds or ephemeral art practi tioners in increasingly consumerist art markets. After all, traditional artists have their own thoughts about encountering metropolitan artists and expressing contemporary experiences. Yet, the issue of representa tion persistently confronts theorists arguing against valorised hierarchies, threatening to reinforce the very myths they are attempting to debunk. I venture to clarify therefore that my wish to engage in this discus sion is not evangelical. It is catalysed by the recognition that if one tackled the prejudices against traditional arts, metropolitan Indian arts would undoubtedly be enriched and perhaps even be liberated from its strong hold of elitism. Theorists like Ananda Coomaraswamy, Jagadish Swaminathan, Jyotindra Jain, Nancy Adajania and Gulammohammad Sheikh have each in their turn highlighted the fact that the prejudice against tribal, folk and ritual arts marginalises Indian traditional artists and craftspeople. In contemporary Indian arts discourse, crafts' and 'traditional arts' are frequently used as synonyms, the pejorative terms applied to one being indiscriminately applied to the other. These terms tend to be used interchangeably because the metropolitan-traditional arts dichotomy has precedents that are comparable. The theorists cited here have discussed binaries that differ subtly, and while these differences will be elaborated on shortly, it may be useful to identify the theoretical frameworks within which their debates have been situated. Coomaraswamy s writing tends to be regarded as motivated by nationalist sentiments against the colonial administration, distorted by an imagined ideal, pre 120</page><page sequence="4">colonial past. His argument of mdrga [highway] from desi [byway] art - which helps to undermine the myth that folk and tribal art is created by racially different peoples or by peoples from a given social stratum - is however often cited as an important contribution to the advocacy of traditional arts. According to him, '[This] is not necessarily a distinction of aristocratic and cultivated from folk and primitive art, but one of sacred and tradi tional from profane and sentimental art'(Coomaras wamy 1956:135-136).1 Although his writing admittedly reflects the nationalism that coloured much writing in the early 1900s, it would be a mistake to disregard his work altogether - as Jain does. I situate his work not just within a colonialist discourse, but more broadly within the arts and crafts binary that has been linked to indus trialisation in the West. I would suggest that his work remains relevant because of his critique of the cult of individualism and its effect on traditional arts, which he regarded as expressing the governing ideology of a collective society. He also felt that the division of modern life into activities of labour and leisure meant that modern art had 'become abstracted from the general activity of making things for human use - whether material or spiritual' (Coomaraswamy 1956: 62-63). While Coomaraswamy advocated traditional arts in general, including the classical arts, Swaminathans work on tribal arts reveals a similarly derogative attitude to be prevalent in the perception of tribal artists. As he recounts, 'at the Centre for Advanced Studies in Simla ... [the speakers concluded that] as all tribal art was based on superstition, to attach any abiding importance to it is to perpetuate superstition (Tully 1992: 271). Swaminathans research was often ethnographic though his arguments aligned with colonialist discourses. Believing that Indian metropolitan artists were crimi nally subservient to the analytic tradition of the West, he avers with trenchant sarcasm, the fact that medieval Indian painting treated painting-space as two-dimensional was interpreted by the ignorant early English as a lack of aesthetic propensity in the Indians.Thus in their misbegotten magnanimity they taught our city-bred artists the glories of English Academic realism. (Swaminathan 1995:22) According to him, even well-meaning efforts to return Indian artists to their traditions were misguided because this was done without an understanding of the spatial concepts working in traditional painting; the superficial allegorical aspect was borrowed with blind chauvinism, and rendered with an anaemic effeminacy' (Swaminathan 1995: 22).2 The solution he offered to the impasse he perceived was to study the folk and tribal arts. However, his efforts to place metropolitan and tribal artists on an equal platform in the Roopankar Museum of Arts were not successful, and eventually Roopankar exclusively housed tribal art while a sepa rate gallery displayed metropolitan work. Writing on tribal art more than a decade after Swaminathan, Jain recalls several modern Indian artists accusing him of subscribing to an Orientalist position of the glorification of ethnicity.'3 The tribal is always [perceived as] ethnic_Perhaps it is for this reason that contemporary folk and tribal artists have regularly been excluded from India's national art shows.... When some of the global art 121</page><page sequence="5">shows, such as Magiciens de la Terre in Paris, ... included works of folk and tribal artists, several Indian moderns opposed the move. (Jain 2001: 23) Notwithstanding accusations of glorifying ethnicity, Jains research on Bengal patua (scroll) artists, kantha women embroiderers and tribal artists is unapologeti cally art-historical. Rather than regarding traditional artists as somehow impervious to mainstream art historical developments, which metropolitan artists experienced during and after colonialism, Jain considers the influence of orientalist and nationalist discourses on these traditional arts, including the influence of academic realism. Despite himself however, he ends up pitting tradition against innova tion, painstakingly pointing out the inventive qualities of the traditional arts he researches. Contrasting them against what he perceives as less innovative arts, he uses phrases such as: [I]n most parts of rural India comparatively closed and repetitive artistic conventions had brought about a certain degree of stagnancy and decadence in pictorial expression. ... [F]olk artists ... are busy mechanically churning out the umpteen [th] version of their past artistic conventions. [U]nlike the embroideries of other regions, [which] remained repetitive and utility-based, ... [the Bengali kantha embroiderers] did not repeat the past in one more hackneyed reproduction but forged a fresh new expression. (Jain 2002: 36-37,41) The fact that Jain, one of the foremost champions of traditional arts, frequently uses the word repetitive' is telling. Writing as recently as 1999, former Art India editor Adajania recalled the late eminent artist Prab hakar Barwe's response when she asked him about the nature of his collaboration with the craftspeople at the Weavers' Service Centre in Mumbai.4 [TJhere is a fundamental difference between the arts and the crafts. On principle, the crafts are concerned with surface. Their basic function is decoration, with a predominant stress on design. When the crafts achieve their maximum skill, they can aspire to the level of art. (Adajania 1999: 34) As Adajania points out, Barwe's opinion may surprise those who question the hierarchy of'high' and 'low' art, but it is a view held by many metropolitan artists ... [who,] privileged by their training and the environ ment in which they operate, customarily believe that the crafts are decorative, dead-end forms. Change is considered the prerogative of the 'contemporary' artist.... Only recently have the two kinds of artists been able to hold a dialogue, however unequal and haphazard it may be; far more often, the possibility of collaboration has withered away in the glare of condescension. (Adajania 1999: 34) As Adajania traces the history of the divide, reiterating that the primacy of metropolitan arts was initially founded on false premises, she briefly touches upon the 1990s debate on the contested notion of contempora neity - 'with the false dichotomy of tradition versus innovation at its core' (Adajania 1999: 37). Adajania's 122</page><page sequence="6">discussion is nonetheless problematic in that she does not define what she means by 'founded'; does she allude to a definitive moment when Indian modernity was born or does she refer to a rupture for which the colo nial administration is generally held culpable?5 The scope of this essay does not allow me to pursue the question. It is sufficient here to say that Adajania believed that Jain's contributions to this debate discred ited the arts and crafts binary, demonstrating 'that tradition and change are not opposites, but intertwined elements in the same process of growth' (Adajania 1999: 37). However, Jain's impassioned - though well researched - arguments are not convincing in this respect, as they frequently contrast words like repeat,' closed,''hackneyed,'stagnancy' and 'decadence' against terms like 'fresh,"innovative' and 'change.' I believe there are several issues at stake here. The first is that although grouping ritual, folk and tribal arts serves the purpose of advocating them more conven iently due to metropolitan arts' perceived primacy over all of them, it would be ultimately more useful to research their distinct histories, developments and purposes. There are at least two precedent dichotomies that one can compare with the metropolitan-traditional arts dichotomy - the arts and crafts binary and the fine and decorative arts binary. At the risk of inserting something here that the scope of this essay will not allow me to develop further, I would suggest that while the arts and crafts divide relates to industrialisation, the fine and decorative arts debate perhaps developed - if indirectly - from the Enlightenment. It is at least evident that the trend of conceptualism challenges the decorative and the sensual. Speaking of the valorisation of arts, Barringer and Flynn refreshingly refer to multiple Indian traditions, not explicitly to an arts and crafts binary. The designations 'fine' and 'decorative' arts, which imply a hierarchy of value, prove particularly inap propriate when applied to the products of cultures where such a distinction is meaningless (such as the multiple artistic traditions of India). (Barringer and Flynn 1998: 3-4) Non-metropolitan Indian arts are inevitably prefixed with qualifying adjectives, while it appears that art' sans prefixes connotes metropolitan arts exclusively, implying their ascendancy. The issue however, is not that distinct adjectives are used to qualify undeniably distinct practices; what is jarring is that arts prefixed by ritual/'folk' and 'tribal' are more often used as synonyms of craft; this usage ignores their significant distinctions. A 'handicraft' emporium in India is often situated as the final stop in coach-conveyor belts, particularly in cities that have proved to be tourist honey-pots. I must clarify that tribal, folk and ritual arts are distinct tradi tions with distinct purposes, idioms and trajectories - bearing little resemblance to the market-driven prod ucts churned out for tourist emporia. There is however one factor that links these three kinds of arts, which explains why metropolitan arts are deemed superior to them. Apart from the trends of conceptualism and new media, which admittedly play a significant role in this divide, the strongest prejudice that links these three arts is the belief that they are repetitive. In addition to this misconception, I believe that debates about the traditional-metropolitan art divide need to factor in the influence of the art market. For many traditional 123</page><page sequence="7">Jangarh Singh Shyam. Untitled, Acrylic on Canvas. Collection: Crafts Museum, Delhi. Photo by Aurogeeta Das. Reproduced courtesy of PRO, Crafts Museum. arts, Coomaraswamy's above-mentioned division of areas of life into activities of leisure and labour has meant a transition fraught with both challenges and possibilities. In his paper on Pardhan-Gond tribal artist Jangarh Singh Shyam, Sheikh comes closest to explaining the complex factors that lead to potential repetitiveness, when traditional artists attempt to operate within the mainstream art market. Since making pictures ... on walls of houses is a community act in most tribal societies, it is conducted largely by non-professionals including the residents themselves. The practice does not involve monetary transactions between the maker and the 'user/ the two often being the same. Rewards, if any, may be in kind or in acknowledgment of individual skills by the clan. How would such works, removed from the site of their genesis, function when put for sale as commodities for anonymous buyers in a city art gallery? In such a set up, it is customary and part of a familiar polemic to pair Yolk' and 'tribal'with craft' while modern and 'contemporary' remain in the category of 'art.' One, viewed as ritualistic and convention-bound is generally regarded as part of a collective tradition prone to repetition, rigid formulas and resistance to change. The other perceived as change-oriented is termed 'free,''dynamic,''individ ualistic,' with an accent on originality: a self-image which is part of a historical consciousness whereas the perception of the other is ahistorical and timeless. (Sheikh 1998:18) Ironically, this dichotomy is paralleled by another equally uneasy one between Indian metropolitan and 124</page><page sequence="8">international artists - a postcolonial legacy that the former take for granted (Mitter 1997:42). Sinha asserts that in the rush to align ourselves with Western modernism, a general area of evasion is Indian aesthetics (Sinha 1999: 80). Dalmia avers, It has often been contended that art in India is both hybrid and imitative. That would be a contradiction in terms, for modernism as it took root in the West had avowed its affiliation to universalism and inter nationalism. Then again when artists like Picasso borrowed from African sculpture or Matisse from Persian miniatures it was to lead to 'high modernism/ In a similar vein, the borrowing of Picasso's inven tions by Ramkinker Baij, or F.N. Souza were consid ered derivative art. (Dalmia 2002: 75) The hierarchies implied in both national and interna tional arts discourses may result partially from a lack of transparency in these arts' socio-political and economic contexts. Others before me have noted the frequent use of terms like repetition/ 'imitation/ 'derivation and 'appropriation in Indian arts discourse, but there remains considerable ambiguity in these discussions because they have only linked these semantics to orien talist, nationalist and postcolonial discourses. To cut through the opacity that befuddles our conception of what constitutes innovativeness in art, I propose to modify and extend previous writers'exercises by linking the semantics of these four terms to the hegemony of the art market. Repetition, imitation, derivation and appropriation Although the meanings connoted by the terms 'repeti tion/ 'imitation/ 'derivation and 'appropriation share some synergies, it is problematic that they are often used synonymously. While the differences between the following definitions and etymologies will soon be clear, their commonality may seem less so. I would suggest that they all relate to our concept of the orig inal/ which means among other things, 'a point from which something develops/ 'first or earliest/ 'new, not copied or based on something else/ 'first version, from which others are copied/ From the Latin, or the French Wepeter^ meaning 'to seek' or 'to aim at/ the verb 'repeat' means 'to do again/ while the adjective 'repetitive' means 'full of repetition.' From the Latin 'imitare' meaning 'to copy' and relating to the word 'image/ the verb 'imitate' means 'to take as a model/ while the noun 'imitation means 'copy of an original.' From the Latin, or the French 'deriver/ from 'rive' meaning a 'brook' or 'stream/ the verb 'derive' means 'to take or develop (from)' while the adjective 'derivative' means 'based on other sources, not original/ and 'derivation can mean 'origination (from river source), or 'deviation into a channel.' From the Latin, 'proprius/ meaning 'own/ the verb 'appropriate' means 'to take for oneself, to put aside for a particular purpose' while the noun 'appropriation means 'the act of putting aside (something) for a particular purpose.' This would suggest in the context of art, an element of taking something for oneself to make it one's own. This further indicates a level of strength or power, in that it suggests being able to turn something to one's advan 125</page><page sequence="9">tage. In art, this would presumably be achieved by choosing elements of an 'original' and assimilating it into a renewed interpretation of the original. To illustrate how the above terms have been misguidedly applied to traditional arts, I have chosen two specific examples - the Jangarh Kalam school of painters in Madhya Pradesh and the muggu floor drawing tradition in Andhra Pradesh. In the 1980s, during his tenure as director of the Roopankar Museum of Tribal Art in Bhopal, Swaminathan - himself an artist - was keen to support Madhya Pradesh's folk and tribal artists, and organised collection drives in a concerted bid to salvage folk and tribal artworks. Jangarh Singh Shyam - a Pardhan-Gond - was discov ered during one of these drives by a team of urban artists.6 Struck by Jangarh's paintings, Swaminathan's recruits invited him to Bhopal. Jangarh's formal style is distinctive for his highly developed sense of colour and the profusion of dots rendering his works iridescent. Moreover, Jangarh departed from Pardhan tradition by drawing flora and fauna and anthropomorphic figures, conceiving the visual form of tribal deities not previously Dot and line muggu drawings by Aurogeeta Das, learnt from muggu practitioners. depicted figuratively by Pardhans. As he settled in the city, Jangarh invited members of his extended family to Bhopal to profit from his relative economic prosperity. Often beginning as his apprentices - mixing acrylics they had not previously used, filling in outlines and placing dots on Jangarh's larger works - many relatives became professional artists, each appropriating recog nisable elements of his style yet developing their own distinctive characteristics. With approximately 30 professional Pardhan artists, Jangarh Kalam has become an art school as identifiable as the Impressionists - remarkable, as this is a tribal tradition founded in a city, at a time when the general Postmodern diffusion means a marked decrease of art schools across the world. While Jangarh Kalam is a nascent tradition, the muggu tradition dates back at least several centuries. Muggus are floor-drawings made by Hindu women in Andhra Pradesh, traditionally at threshold hours - FO 126</page><page sequence="10">pre-dawn and pre-dusk, and in threshold spaces. They also mark sacraments of life and natural transitional times - like waxing and waning lunar cycles - and are most prolifically drawn during Sankranti - the annual harvest festival that includes ancestor worship. Tradi tionally drawn with rice powder and a lime compound, they have three formal categories: 1) complex dot and line drawings that use grids of dots; 2) sacred line drawings that symbolise Hindu deities, or planets and stars; 3) new' drawings that are more figurative and decora tive. Gell (1998) theorises the intricate dot and line drawings as being apotropaic, that is, able to ward off evil; this would be in keeping with folk beliefs in demons and ghosts. The line drawings - recognisably Hindu in character - often propitiate deities hosted at the threshold, protecting the home and family. I would argue that the newer drawings lean towards secularism while still incorporating auspicious, Hindu symbolic motifs. This is evidenced by the new muggus relative lack of associative motifs. The muggus purpose is asso ciated with various cultural traditions including fertility rituals, ancestor worship and the annual harvest. While these associations remain strong, the tradition is transi tioning. Festive occasions like New Year - having no established motifs - provide women an opportunity to draw whatever they associate with fun. New Year s Day being celebrated according to the Roman calendar, the event is associated with the West, so one is more likely to find women drawing more 'Western motifs during New Years Eve. There are also significant changes in the transmission of muggu forms and patterns. While New Year's Eve muggu, Synthetic colours, Pallakollu, 2007. Photo by Aurogeeta Das. previous generations learnt muggu-drzwing as young girls by imitating their female elders, they now often learn them by copying from newspaper articles, chap books or personal notebooks maintained by practi tioners. There is virtually a proliferation of mediated circulation of muggu patterns and forms. As defined above, the terms repetition/ 'imitation/ 'derivation and 'appropriation may all be applied to traditional arts as well as to metropolitan arts. Tradi tional arts can be repetitive; after all, this is a key char acteristic of ritual art - the ritual artist repeats the artistic action every day or every season. 127</page><page sequence="11">Ritual art is a ... way towards spiritual identity,... a state in which we can realise our oneness with the universe.... Traditionally, Indian ritual art... draws the maker or viewer into a relationship. It is an experience, daily repeated, which leads towards integration, and to an expansion of consciousness. ... [Assembling and disposing the various objects of our awareness in a pattern of offering, the object of ritual art is to] entrap and concentrate power for the benefit of celebrant and community. (Mookerjee 1985:9-10) Read in this context, the etymological meanings of repeat' - 'seeking' or aiming at' - have particular rele vance; a ritual act, daily repeated, seeks' integration or fulfilment. An Andhra woman thus draws a daily muggu in a renewed effort to protect her home. Metropolitan arts are also repetitive, albeit differently. When an artist like Vaikuntham paints the same subject - with little variation - over and over again, he is repeating himself. As a gallery owner representing him believes, Vaikuntham churned out dozens of works in hackneyed fashion, despite his desire to experiment, because his purchasing audience expected paintings of swarthy southern women wearing brilliantly coloured garments. It is intriguing that in the face of such obvious repetition by many metropolitans, the belief that all metropolitan artists are collectively more innovative than all tribal or ritual artists persists, and the accusation of repetitive' is not generally levelled against metropolitans. Indeed, versatile metropolitans are singled out for distinction, like KG Subramanyan, who is admired for his willing ness to learn new media or adopt an idiom in his efforts to develop a fresh visual language. If such versatility among metropolitans is thus admired, can one assume that innovativeness cannot indiscriminately be applied to metropolitan artists? Needless to say, artists'signature' plays a significant role in their survival in a competitive market, making them reluctant to risk abandoning an established signature that translates to economic secu rity. Note though, that metropolitan and non-metropol itan artists' causes for repetition differ considerably. While the ritual artist repeats his or her artistic act, he or she also imitates what the community's predeces sors did. This is not lack of innovation, nor is it imita tion as understood in the metropolitans' copyright conscious market; this is a purposeful repetition of motifs in a traditional vernacular. If a woman in Andhra draws a pot overflowing with milk, or sugar cane and wheat sheaves on Bhogi day (part of the three-day annual harvest festival, Sankranti), it is not because she is incapable of conceiving a form she has not previously seen nor because she cannot draw a form she imagines. It is because she draws an overflowing pot as a symbol of abundance - a basic motif symbolising food that has remained constant for centuries, for generations of Andhra women. She may however, and almost certainly does draw a pot in a distinctive style. Indeed, upon close, regular observation, I found that I could easily recognise individual styles and preferences among muggu practitioners. Moreover, if an overflowing pot served as a mark of thankfulness for what the family has been blessed with or as a symbol of hope that they would continue to receive food and sustenance, it is hardly surprising that today, women draw cars in a muggu - a contemporary symbol of prosperity. Under stood thus, an act of repeating what their forerunners have drawn is as much an expression of a cultural as of 128</page><page sequence="12">an artistic tradition. As such, it hardly constitutes an act of mere imitation. It is when the meanings begin to fade from such symbols that it may be interpreted as imitation. This is sometimes - and admittedly, increas ingly - the case, but it must be emphasised that this results from the original context of the artistic practice changing course - put another way, it is 'deviating.' In such cases, the technique and the tradition may remain while the forms may gradually die out, or assume new meaning - as in the case of a labyrinthine motif that Layard (1937) believed was a mortuary drawing, but was identified to me as a hand-fan by women in Palla kollu town in Andhra. Can traditional art forms that persist when their 'original' significance is either lost or altered - be called derivative? In art, both etymological meanings of the word 'derive' have relevance: to 'develop' or 'deviate' from an 'original.' From the three formal categories I have identified in muggus, I surmise that the muggu tradition has changed course a few times already. It is because muggu practitioners have collectively changed course, or - to follow the etymology - formed multiple tributaries, that it survives to this day. To derive or deviate from a course may suggest a weakening, narrowing or lessening but surely the muggu tradition's resilience - notable if one considers it is an ephemeral practice persisting in an increasingly materialistic, consumer-driven society - lies precisely in its ability to Jamini Roy (1887-1992).

These examples - like Picas so's appropriation of African art - are less controversial than Indian artists' appropriation of Picasso's style, because they are individuals appropriating collective traditions. The reverse also applies; just as Bengali patua (scroll) artists appropriated popular imagery from English calendars and postcards, Andhra's women have appropriated Disney figures like Mickey Mouse for New Year's Eve muggus. To repeat, imitate or derive from, is not necessarily a sign of weakness. It can be - and very often is - a foun dation to build upon. By learning skills, techniques, forms and concepts, traditional artists learn a visual art's vocabulary and grammar, building up a vast reser voir that they then have at their disposal to exploit it as they may choose. Some Jangarh Kalam artists are adversely affected by economic worries, like Bhajju Shyam, whose early works were bold and insightful and have now lost much of their humour. But this relates to the economics of their situation. It has little to do with the way they first learnt their art by imitating Jangarh.

More often than not, such an enrichment of the tradition ... becomes the distinctive signature of the whole tribe. (Shah 1996: 20) Muggu practitioners similarly learn symbols, motifs and drawings with seemingly infinite permutations and combinations by imitating community elders but they can and do make up their own muggus. Ironically, traditional artists today are not overly concerned about whether their work is called repetitive, imitative or derivative, except in cases like Jangarh Kalam artists - professional artists whose livelihood suffers from such labels. In general, other non-metropolitan traditions develop - if not immune to the market, certainly resistant to it. In the long run, hierarchic labelling hurts traditional artists less than it does metropolitans, whose evasion of the past limits their historical resources and threatens to compromise their artistic integrity. Lamentably few metropolitans have intelligently exploited the richness of traditional arts, and unlike in Europe, where a history is commonly learnt as a matter of course, in India, the past is almost 'the other/ The high conceptualism of metropolitan arts also ignores discourse about traditional arts among tradi tional artists. Serious studies of traditional arts are often undertaken within an anthropological rather than an aesthetic or art-historical framework. Muggu practitioners for example, may not talk about ephemer ality in the terms we tend to use. They will instead say, 'The old muggu must be washed and a new one drawn every day/ or they may say 'Vishnu must leave on this day.The chariot muggu symbolises Vishnu's departure, so we cannot draw it after this day/ What Geertz states with reference to Western and non-Western arts is equally applicable to the cultural chasm between Indian metropolitan and traditional artists: [The failure to recognise variety in the cultural significance accorded to art in various cultures leads many students of non-western art to comment that] people of such cultures [who produce so-called primitive art'] don t talk, or not very much, about art - they just sculpt, sing, weave, or whatever; silent in their expertise. What is meant is that they don t talk about it the way the observer talks about it - or would like them to - in terms of its formal proper ties, its symbolic content, its affective values, or its stylistic features, except laconically, cryptically ... But, of course, they do talk about it, as they talk about everything else striking, or suggestive, or moving, that passes through their lives ... [but] this tends to be seen not as talk about art, but about something else - everyday life, myths, trade, or whatever. (Geertz 1976:1476) The hierarchies and dichotomies in Indian art have been debated for over a century. By exploring the semantics of some of these discourses and linking them to the art market, I have presented here some of the issues that it may be helpful to consider so our multiple artistic traditions can continue to thrive. As religious rituals, tribal affinities and folk beliefs fade or change, these traditions may struggle to find a collective purpose for their artistic activity. Thus far, their so-called repetitiveness and tendency to 'imitate' has 132</page><page sequence="16">ensured their continued survival beyond periods of change and upheaval. We would do well to observe the current transitions of ritual, folk and tribal arts. While these - as Coomaraswamy suggested - had some governing ideology that propelled them forward collectively - allowing them to change course whenever this was required, their future trajectories will doubtless bring in new challenges as they may choose - or be forced - to participate in a competitive art market that demands Innovation and originality'; indeed this is already happening with a number of traditional arts. The parameters of the definitional terrain of the word art' are determined by art critics and theorists who are themselves products of the art market. I have tried in this essay to indicate the pervasive influence of the market. After all, we are forced to make a divide between arts anthropological and aesthetic values partly because of the markets need for a hierarchy, without which it would be difficult to accord a mone tary value to different arts and artists. Consequently, we fail to accord artistic value to myriad practices that would otherwise enrich metropolitan arts, guiding - or deviating - them towards more exciting directions.

Sentiment is a quality hitherto lacking, according to Shahane, in traditional visual art in India - unlike in the performance arts, which were developed along the lines of the Natyashastra. While the Natyashastra recommends bhava, or feeling, the visual arts treatises concentrate on techni que and form, rather than on any philosophy like the rasas (nine emotions laid down in performance arts canons as neces sary components of all good art) (Shahane 2003: 39). 3 Jyotindra Jain was formerly the director of the Crafts Museum in Delhi, after which he became the first Dean of the Jawahar lal Nehru University's School of Arts and Aesthetics. He has been a vocal advocate of the tribal and folk arts. 4 Art India is the premier contemporary arts journal in India, and arguably the only serious art journal dedicated to contemporary art. Other journals tend to be pan-Asian in scope, or like Art Times, fold up due to lack of supporter/ &amp; Deal and Marg are the only other art journals, with the former having a very limi ted distribution. The Weaver's Service Centre in Mumbai often invited prominent artists to collaborate' with traditional artists. As with J. Swaminathans efforts in the Roopankar Museum in Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal, efforts to start a dialogue between metropolitan and traditional artists have been unsuc cessful thus far. 133</page><page sequence="17">5 The popularly held view lays the blame squarely at the Colo nialists' door. However, Shahane, for example, dates it before then. He contends that the asceticism of High Brahminism and Jainism had already started the divide between decorative and fine arts, which was further entrenched first by Victorian morality, then Imperialism, and lastly by Gandhian and Marx ist philosophies (Shahane 2003: 36-37). 6 The Pardhan-Gonds were traditionally minstrels and genealo gists to their parent tribe, the central Indian Gonds, and as such don't have a strong history in visual art, unlike other tribes like Warlis, Saoras and Pithoras. 7 Synthetic powders and chalk are now used often to make muggusy as are plastic stencil sheets and perforated tubes which are used by women who lack the time or skill to draw traditio nal muggus\ new forms are also constantly added on to the seemingly infinite public repertoire. 8 Also called Neo-Tantrics.
