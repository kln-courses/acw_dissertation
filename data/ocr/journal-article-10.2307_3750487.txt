<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Effectiveness of Causes By Dorothy Emmet London: Macmillan, 1984, viii+136 pp., ?15.00 The present consensus amongst English-speaking philosophers is that Hume conclusively demonstrated that causes cannot, with any philosophical or scientific seriousness, be thought to produce their effects. The objective content of a claim that A caused B can only be that events or states like A are regularly followed by events or states like B (or some more sophisticated variation on this theme). Any thought that there is more to causal connection than regular succession is a matter of projection on our part, which, if not checked, leads to superstition and anthropomorphism. As the title of her book suggests, Dorothy Emmet dissents from this view. She urges us to reconsider the case for regarding causes as effective. ... if we invoke agency causation; it is said not to fit into the mould of event causation; it is assumed that we take the model of event causation as the proper model of causal explanation. This is the assumption that can, indeed, I think must, be questioned (p. 37). Her first seven chapters are thus devoted to an attack on various aspects of event causation. This attack at the same time serves to clarify her conception of what should take its place and why. She is well aware that one cannot merely 279</page><page sequence="2">New Books oppose the technicalities of Hume-inspired analyses of causation, but must also take on the whole of its associated metaphysical outlook. Thus she argues that we need to think in terms of 'effecting' as an operation, as something done, an activity, because ... without some such notion, we are left with a world in which there is no real movement (as distinct from recorded changes in position); no real becoming (as distinct from successive states); no real persistence (as distinct from prediction of properties at later times from earlier ones) (pp. 85-86). Although the central opposition between static and dynamic views emerges clearly enough, these chapters are not entirely successful. They are not presented in sufficiently general terms for positions to emerge clearly, but neither are they sufficiently detailed to count as thorough refutations of those whose specific positions are mentioned. Indeed, if one were not already familiar with the works of Davidson, Mellor, von Wright, Mackie, Quine, Kim et al., the discussion would be almost impossible to follow. The concluding four chapters stand as an illustration of the liberation to be gained by removing the blinkers imposed by the Humean analysis of causa- tion. The plurality of possible forms of causation once more becomes visible. In particular Professor Emmet picks up an Aristotelian distinction which was redrawn by Aquinas as the distinction between the kind of doing which involves acting on something external, and which thus has a product which is separable from the activity (transeunt causation, a making), and that where the activity and its effect remain within the agent (immanent causation). Event- causation focuses solely on transeunt (or efficient) causation. But the notion of immanent causation is shown to be worthy of resurrection. Perhaps the most interesting use to which Professor Emmet puts this notion is in accounting for persistence. Here, as she acknowledges, she is drawing on the generalized notion of 'organism' developed in Whitehead's middle works. The idea is that the 'passage of nature' should be seen as a pattern-forming and pattern-sustaining process. It is to the case of living organisms, dynamic systems, that the notion of immanent causation most immediately applies, for such systems maintain themselves (and hence persist) only through a struc- tured internal activity involving complex feedback mechanisms. But particle physics would have us view all natural objects as dynamic systems, whose stability as systems can only be explained by reference to activity internal to the system: To see persistence as a matter of immanent causation is to say that the activity which is producing a present state is carried forward into the supervening state. Moreover, the supervening stage recapitulates the pat- tern of the subvening stage, unless something happens externally or intern- ally to produce a variation on this (p. 86). Professor Emmet goes on in Chapters 9 and 10 to explore the possibility of seeing the relation between mind and body in terms of immanent causation within the unity of a thinking, living organism. Here she suggests that intelligent activity involves a kind of creative causation which requires belief in 'a basic kind of immanent causation in organisms as active systems' (p. 108). 280</page><page sequence="3">New Books This is then used as a model for considering (in Chapter I1) the nature of divine causation. These chapters take us into deep metaphysical waters and the reviewer was rapidly led out of her depth. Professor Emmet has written a courageously unfashionable book, which has the quality of a philosophical diary or a personal statement of faith, and is valuable as such. It successfully highlights the philosophic centrality and importance of accounts of causation, raising many awkward questions which do indeed need to be faced. However, I fear that she does not resolve them in a way which would carry much conviction for those who are not already sym- pathetic to her position. Mary Tiles 281</page></plain_text>
