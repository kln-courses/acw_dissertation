Murtón Biomechanics Research Center Wayne State University THE OBJECT OF THIS RESEARCH was to define humanlike quasi-static bending response character- istics for the lower torso to provide design criteria for anthropomorphic dummies and response defini- tions for mathematical modeling. BACKGROUND Since no appropriate response criteria have been available, the lumbar and pelvic regions of dummies have not been designed, a priori, to re- flect biomechanical fidelity. Likewise, the lower torso response specifications used in mathematical modeling have been somewhat arbitrary. The Part 572 dummy (1)* currently required in connection with Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (2) must satisfy a specific quasi-static bending response requirement in flexion (forward bending); however, this specification is not based on biomechanical data. Furthermore, the specification deals only with the response of the lumbar region, leaving the charac- teristics of the hip joint region undefined. Since the kinematics of a vehicle occupant during a crash must be expected to depend significantly on the bending response of the lower torso, the pertinence of the study presented herein becomes obvious. In this study, six volunteers were subjected to a total of 72 tests to define response characteristics for sagittal flexion (forward bending) and extension *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. (rearward bending). The effects of muscle tensing and knee bend on the response were evaluated. Each test subject was positioned on his side with legs immobilized and upper torso supported by a dolly free to roll on the floor. Film analysis tar- gets, potted and strapped to the subject, were re- ferenced to the skeletal structure and monitored by an overhead camera during the test. A force applied near the shoulders provided a bending moment at the lower torso, causing lumbar bending and hip joint articulation. The data have been analyzed to provide sixteen loading corridors of moment of applied force about the H-point axis versus thorax-pelvis relative angle and versus pelvis-femur relative angle. TEST SUBJECT CONSIDERATIONS VOLUNTEER SELECTION - The test subjects consisted of six adult male volunteers as indicated in Table 1. They were selected to provide a range in height and weight, and are compared to the adult males in the 1962 HEW survey (3) in Table 1. The HEW sample 50th percentile* values are 74. 5 kg (164 lb weight) and 173. 5 cm (68. 3 in) with standard deviations of 12. 7 kg (28 lb weight) and 7. 3 cm (2. 85 in). * The HEW data closely approximate a normal dis- tribution; therefore, mean values and 50th per- centile values are nominally equivalent. - ABSTRACT This report defines humanlike quasi-static bending response characteristics of the lower torso. Six volunteers were subjected to a total of 72 tests to define response characteristics for sagittal flex- ion and extension bending. The effects of muscle tensing and knee bend on the response are evaluated. Sixteen loading corridors of moment of applied force about the H-point axis versus thorax-pelvis and pelvis-femur angles are suggested, The significant differences between the relaxed and tensed muscles results illustrate the need for a philosophical deci- sion regarding which of these conditions should be adopted to define lower torso bending response for the human surrogate used in automotive safety studies. 3225</page><page sequence="2">3226 G.

The data indicate that the mean of the sample used for this study was a bit taller [2.5 cm (1.0 in)î and less massive [ 1. 8 kg (4 lb weight)] than the HEW 50th percentile. Likewise, the standard deviations of height and mass of the sample used for this study were, respectively, the same [both 7. 3 cm (2. 85 in)] and somewhat smaller [by 4. 8 kg (10. 6 lb weight)] than those of the HEW sample. SUBJECT PREPARATION - Film analysis tar- gets were installed after taking a series of anthro- pometric measurements. Targets were required at the thorax and the pelvis for photographically monitoring the angles during the bending experi- ment. Whereas targets can be attached to the skeletal structure of cadaver subjects efficiently using bone screws, this is obviously not acceptable in volunteer studies. The alternative is to tightly strap form-fitting target assemblies in a manner that minimizes target movement relative to the skeletal elements to be monitored. The target assemblies developed for this program are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 - Thoracic and pelvic target assemblies Each target assembly had a long target bar with contrasting colors to clearly define a straight line. The target bar was coupled through a locking ball and socket adaptor to an aluminum plate which was, in turn, potted to the volunteers skin with plaster of paris. Small screws extended through the aluminum plate into the plaster of paris to pro- vide a mechanical locking function and to enable the removal and subsequent reattachment of the custom-contoured body/target interface. A coat of paste wax on the skin prior to application of the plaster of paris provided a mild adhesive effect to help preclude target motion relative to the skin. Criteria for locating the thoracic target as- sembly were threefold: 1. Center of aluminum plate to be at the palpated location of the 8th thoracic vertebra (T8) spinous process; 2. Plate of aluminum plate to be parallel to a line tangent to the axis of the spine at T8 and to a lateral-medial line; 3. Target bar to be located in the midsagittal plane. Reasonable approximations of conditions 1 and 3 were achieved by eye without difficulty. Condition 2 was approximated by orienting the aluminum plate parallel to midsagittal and lateral- medial skin surface tangent lines at the palpated T8 spinous process. Criteria for locating the pelvic target assembly at the sacrum (the posterior aspect of the pelvis) were also threefold: 1. Aluminum plate to be sufficiently inferior to the lumbar region to preclude target movement relative to the pelvis as a result of lumbar spine articulation; 2. Target bar to be located in the midsagit- tal plane; 3. Plane of aluminum plate to be parallel to a lateral-medial line and target bar to be at a known orientation relative to the pelvic skeletal reference line in the midsagittal plane. Condition 1 was satisfied by mounting the target assembly sufficiently low on the buttocks that the superiormost portion of the aluminum plate was inferior to the posterior, superior iliac spines. Reference to an anatomy chart indicates that this criterion assures that the aluminum plate will not interfere with the 5th lumbar vertebra. Locating the plate in this manner positioned its inferior edge in proximity of the superior margin of the buttocks cleavage. This proved to be advantageous because potting of plaster of paris in this highly-contoured region led to added stability of the target assembly. Condition 2 of the target assembly location cri- teria was approximated by eye without difficulty. Condition 3 was met by locating the aluminum plate, by eye, nominally parallel to the skin surface and establishing the target bar orientation, relative</page><page sequence="3">STATIC BENDING RESPONSE 3227 Fig. 2 - Fully installed target assemblies to a pelvic skeletal reference line, after the target assembly was completely installed. The referenc- ing procedure is described in the next section of the paper. The thoracic and pelvic target assemblies were strapped in place using the four eyebolts in each aluminum plate (Fig. 1). Fabric straps (adjustable length) were attached to the eyebolts via swivel snaps and positioned as illustrated in Fig. 2 (the volunteer donned the disposable coveralls prior to initiation of the target installation procedure). Thoracic target straps extended laterally, around the thorax, from both the upper and lower pairs of eyebolts. In addition, a set of straps from the upper eyebolts passed crisscross over the shoul- ders. The lateral straps were coupled to elastic cords, which traversed the chest. The elastic ac- tion tended to facilitate breathing without loss of strap tension. The straps crossing over the shoul- ders terminated at the upper lateral strap/elastic cord juncture points. A similar arrangement was used to immobilize the pelvic target assembly. The two sets of pelvic lateral straps extended around the lower torso to elastic cords. Both elastic cords were hooked below the anterior, su- perior iliac spines and were under moderate, con- stant tension. A crotch strap extended from each of the lower eyebolts around and up to the upper lateral strap/elastic cord juncture points (the crotch straps did not crisscross left to right). The shoulder straps and crotch straps were not pulled taught but were pulled snug to hinder potential tar- get movement. ¿ A LUMBAR SPINE ( PELVIS ' / Jļ1 (ANTERIOR, SUPERIOR ILIAC SPINE) (/ ) Y &lt;- MIDSAGITTAL PLANE M J ) REFERENCE LINE ) A (PUBIC CREST) nj FEMUR H-POINT (HIP JOINT CENTER OF ROTATION) Fig. 3 - The pelvic triangle THE PELVIC TRIANGLE - Location of an ac- ceptable midsagittal reference line on the pelvis of a volunteer subject poses two problems. First, one must locate suitable landmarks on the pelvis to define the line. Second, the line must be suffi- ciently accessible to enable the establishment of its orientation relative to the axis of the pelvis target bar. X-ray radiography in the pelvic region of the volunteers could not be justified;* therefore, another noninvasive technique was developed. Palpation of the anterior, superior iliac spines and the pubic crest is feasible and enabled estab- lishment of a midsagittal plane reference line as illustrated in Fig. 3. The reference line is defined as the line, tangent to the pubic crest, that bisects the line joining the left and right anterior, superior iliac spines. The point of tangency and the bisec- tion point constitute two specific points of reference for the pelvis. The H-point axis** location was required in the data reduction phase of the study to define the moments of the applied forces. H-point axis location techniques are discussed later. The intersection of the H-point axis and the midsagittal plane provided a third specific reference point for the pelvis. These three reference points are, by definition, the apexes of the pelvic triangle (Fig. 3). * X-ray radiation exposure of the genitalia could be justified only when used for medical diagnosis be- cause of the sterilization hazard. ** The H-point axis is defined to be the straight line cpnnecting the pseudocenters of rotation of the hip jomts.</page><page sequence="4">3228 G. W. NYQUIST AND C. J. MURTON PALPATION FIXTURE - Location of the pelvic reference line relative to the pelvic target assem- bly, utilizing palpation of the pelvic landmarks discussed above, was accomplished with the aid of a palpation fixture (Fig. 4). Whereas palpation is normally accomplished using the fingers, in this case palpation rods with hemispherical ends were utilized. The fixture had sufficient adjustability to enable the volunteer to palpate the left and right anterior, superior iliac spines, and the pubic crest, with the hemispherical ends of the three palpation rods. The palpation rods were locked in place, relative to the fixture, when the volunteer indicated that proper palpation had been achieved. An adjustable outrigger assembly attached to the palpation fixture enabled the position of the pelvic target assembly to be determined relative to the palpation rods. Two reference points on the outrigger assembly were positioned at two reference points on the target after the volunteer had assumed the palpated position. Upon locking the outrigger adjustments, the volunteer was carefully removed from the fixture without disturbing the fixture ge- ometry. The target reference points and the pal- pated points were then located relative to one an- other by measuring their coordinates relative to reference axes. The volunteers were instructed to estimate flesh thicknesses at the palpated points, and the estimates were used to make corrections in the coordinates described above. These data enabled the location of two apexes of the pelvic triangle (points I and P of Fig. 3). Location of the third apex (point H in Fig. 3) is discussed next. H-POINT LOCATION - The H-point axis was first located relative to the pelvic target bar using a graphical analysis of cinematrographic data. The technique enabled construction of the center of a quasi-circular arc generated by a point near the knee as the leg was flexed and extended relative Fig. 4 - Pelvic landmark palpation fixture Fig. 5 - Bending test fixture with volunteer installed to the pelvis. The volunteer reassumed his posi- tion in the palpation fixture for this procedure. The iliac spine palpation rods served to restrain the pel- vis alignment such that the H-point axis remained parallel to, and nominally coaxial with, the optical axis of a 16 mm motion picture camera. The pal- pation fixture was mounted on an elevated bedplate such that the midsagittal plane of the volunteer coincided with the edge of the plate. This enabled the volunteer to stand on his right leg and swing his left leg without foot/plate interference. The leg and pelvis kinematics during full voluntary flexion and extension of the thigh were filmed, docu- menting the motion of a target point, tightly strap- ped just above the knee,* relative to the pelvic target. The film was analyzed to establish the arc, relative to the pelvis target, traced by the knee target. The arc was nearly circular; and on this basis, the center of the best circular approximation was taken to define the H-point axis. The above procedure seemed reasonable but gave questionable results. Palpation of the greater trochanter appeared to give a more reasonable approximation. This procedure was accomplished using the previously described palpation fixture with an additional palpation rod extending from the outrigger assembly to the trochanter. Additional discussion on the H-point location problem is in- cluded under RESULTS and ANALYSIS OF RESULTS. TEST DESCRIPTION BENDING TEST FIXTURE - The experiment was conducted with the volunteer positioned on his side as indicated in Fig. 5. This was convenient because the test data include the moment of the applied force about the H-point axis, and in this * The volunteer was instructed to keep the knee in full extension (leg straight) while swinging the leg. This helped to minimize target motion, relative to the thigh, caused by flesh movement.</page><page sequence="5">STATIC BENDING RESPONSE 3229 configuration (H-point axis vertical) the force of gravity on the upper torso did not influence the moment, regardless of the state of bending of the volunteer. The volunteer was immobilized by clamping the thighs to a rigid, vertical seatpan assembly (Fig. 5). The seatpan assembly included a padded, midsagittal support bracket between the thighs to properly align the subject and to provide some vertical support. The seatpan was sufficiently short to assure that there was no interference with the buttocks, thus enabling uninhibited articulation at the hip joints. A panel hinged to the front edge of the seatpan, in conjunction with two sets of straps, provided lower leg restraint. Adjustments enabled the panel to be fixed coplanar with the seatpan (legs straight configuration) or fixed per- pendicular to the seatpan [ 1. 57 rad (90 deg) knee flexion configuration] . The seatpan assembly included provisions for a lap belt to further re- strain the volunteer. The lap belt, used in some tests, limited the hip joint articulation and thereby assured that significant lumbar bending would be developed, irrespective of the pelvis/thigh stiffness. The upper torso was supported by placing the right shoulder on a dolly that was equipped with precision casters and rolled on tempered Masonite (negligible rolling resistance). A similar, smaller dolly was placed under the pelvis of some volunteers to provide additional lower torso support, thereby affording an acceptable comfort level. The shoul- ders were lashed to a vertical post extending from the base of the larger dolly. This enabled a bending force to be applied to the volunteer as a somewhat distributed load because the force was applied to the dolly assembly rather than directly to the volun- teer. A lever arm assembly was provided for man- ually applying the bending force. The lever was located above the volunteer and had a vertical pivot axis nominally coaxial with the H-point axis. Since the bending force was to be applied to the volunteer in the midsagittal plane, and the lever arm was elevated above this plane, it was necessary to cantilever an outrigger downward from the lever arm. The outrigger was located radially outward from the lever arm pivot axis a distance nominally equal to the volunteer H-point-to-shoulder dimen- sion. The shoulder dolly assembly was coupled to the outrigger through a force transducer located with its axis in the midsagittal plane. Clevis joints at each end of the transducer link assured that no bending moment was transmitted. The arrangement described above resulted in the ap- plication of a bending force nominally perpendicular to the thoracic spine and enabled a quantitative definition of the magnitude of the bending load - the moment of this force about the H-point axis. This moment was equal to the product of the tensile force in the transducer link by the perpendicular distance from the axis of the link to the H-point axis. In flexion (forward bending) tests the force transducer link was coupled to the dolly assembly through a section of chain extending upward from the base of the doHy to a beam cantilevered out from the vertical post to which the shoulders were lashed (Fig. 5). This geometry enabled the force transducer link to be coupled to the dolly assembly, yet remain in the midsagittal plane, without inter- fering with the volunteer. In extension (rearward bending) tests the lever arm and outrigger assembly were behind the volunteer, and the force transducer link was coupled directly to the vertical post to which the shoulders were lashed. A 1 300 N (300 lb) capacity force transducer was used to monitor the bending force. Honeywell Accudata signal conditioning equipment was utilized in conjunction with a Visicorder light beam oscillo- graph to record the force as a function of time. A Fastair 16 mm high-speed camera was mounted overhead to photograph the test event. The camera framing rate was nominally 100 pictures/sec - considerably higher than necessary to document a quasi-static test. The time bases of the film and the oscillograph record were synchronized by means of a light bulb flashing in the field of view of the camera. An oscillograph galvanometer was driven by a photoelectric cell adjacent to the bulb so that a trace deflection occurred simultaneously with the lighting of the bulb. TEST PROTOCOL - The lower torso bending response of each volunteer was evaluated under twelve different test conditions. A test parameter matrix defining the experimental conditions is pre- sented in Table 2. The experiments were designed to provide insights into several aspects of the lower torso bending response. Anatomical considerations lead one to expect that the response in forward bending (flexion) will differ from that in rearward bending (extension); therefore, it is pertinent to evaluate both conditions. Likewise, it is easily demonstrated that one can attain a greater degree of flexion if the legs are bent at the knees than if the legs are straight. Knee angle, therefore, is also a pertinent parameter to investigate. Accord- ingly, the tests were conducted with the legs straight and with the legs bent nominally 1. 57 rad (90 deg) at the knee. One can tense his muscles and resist bending to a significant degree. A quantitative evaluation of this phenomenon was pursued by con- ducting each test with muscles relaxed and with muscles tensed. Each of the flexion experiments was conducted with and without a lap belt. The rationale was that if lower torso bending tended to occur primarily as a result of hip joint articulation, the lumbar region would perhaps never be forced far into flexion unless the pelvis was restrained in</page><page sequence="6">3230 G.

The initial position of the volunteers in all tests was determined by placing the thoracic spine axis approximately perpendicular to the seatpan (there was no effort to maintain close control of this variable). Upon completing a checklist, to insure the instrumentation was in proper order, the volunteer was informed of the test conditions, and the test followed immediately. The oscillo- graph/film synchronization light commenced flash- ing approximately two seconds after the oscillograph paper drive and high speed camera were actuated. The sound of the camera motor was the indicator used by the volunteer to sense that the bending force was to be applied. Bending commenced upon sight of the first light flash, at which time an operator manually began to push the lever arm assembly (described in the previous section of the paper) through its range of travel. In relaxed muscle tests the volunteer was instructed to simply follow passively and let his torso bend, whereas in tensed muscle tests he was instructed to strenuously resist the bending force and attempt to retain his initial configuration. The test proceeded until there was a command from the volunteer that he did not wish to tolerate further bending, which was defined as his utterance of any sound (it was difficult to actually speak while the muscles were tensed). Upon command, further bending stopped and the lever arm was backed-off somewhat to release the load. The test durations were approximately 10 s. The tensed muscle tests proved to be tiring, both for the volunteer and the lever arm operator. How- ever, since relaxed and tensed tests were run alter- nately, and there was a pause between tests to check instrumentation and change test conditions, both parties appeared to have had sufficient time to re- cover. At all times during the test sequence the welfare of the volunteer was the first priority, and he was questioned regularly regarding his condition. The team was prepared to quickly remove the vol- unteer from the fixture and strip-off the tightly- strapped target assemblies if the volunteer showed signs of distress. RESULTS The palpation fixture data and the cinemato- graphic H-point location data were reduced to pro- vide the pelvic triangle information of Fig. 6. The data reduction also defined the location and orienta- tion of the pelvic target bar relative to the pelvic triangle.

This enabled bend- ing angles to be defined as illustrated in Fig. 7. The thoracic target assembly had been installed with its target bar axis nominally parallel to a tan- gent line at T8. X-ray radiograms of a cadaver leg strapped into the test fixture indicated that it is a good assumption to consider the femur link axis to be parallel to the plane of the rigid seatpan assembly (which was well defined in the films of the test events). These conditions enabled analyses of the films, which led to the data points in Figs. 8-23. The loading corridors of these figures are discussed in the ANALYSIS OF RESULTS. At each flash of the film/oscillograph synchro- nization light, the thorax-pelvis and pelvis-femur angles (Fig. 7) and perpendicular distance from the bending force line-of-action to the H-point axis were determined. The moment of the applied force about the H-point axis was defined at each step as the product of this lever arm distance by the force* scaled from the oscillograph record. * The rolling resistance of the shoulder support dolly was sufficiently small to be neglected in this analysis. 395 i .

W. NYQUIST AND C. J. MURTON The thorax-pelvis response data are plotted in Figs. 8-15, and the pelvis-femur data are plotted in Figs. 16-23. In Figs. 8-11 the data sets for experiments A and C, D and F, G and I, and J and L have been paired and plotted - each pair on one figure. * The rationale is that the test conditions within each group were identical, except that one test included a lap belt, and the other did not. The lap belt was included only to insure that significant lumbar bending would occur, regardless of the degree of hip joint articulation. The bending mo- ment distribution in the lumbar region was not af- fected by the presence of the belt; accordingly, the belted and unbelted data may be pooled. Pooling of the pelvis-femur response data in the manner described above is not allowable because the actual moment at the H-point axis does depend on whether or not a lap belt is present. According- ly, only the unbelted test data are used to define pelvis-femur responses in Figs. 16-19. In utilizing the results of this study it is im- portant to realize that the thorax-pelvis angle data are measured using a film target attached at the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra.

PELVIC TRIANGLE DISCUSSION - It was noted earlier, in the H-Point Location discussion, that the cinematographic technique employed to locate the H-point axis gave questionable results. These results are plotted in Fig. 6 as the " con- structed" legs of the pelvic triangles (dashed lines). In contrast, the solid-line triangles repre- sent the results based on palpation of the greater trochanter. Note that the constructed points con- sistently fall below (inferior to) the palpated points. Also, note the skewed shape of the constructed tri- angles as compared with their palpated counterparts, which tend toward an equilateral configuration. Analyses of X-ray radiograms of cadaver pelves, an excised pelvis, and anatomy charts and drawings all indicate that the quasi-equilateral geometry is correct. To be more specific, it appears that a straight line erected through apex H of the triangle, perpendicular to the midsagittal plane reference line IP, must always pass between points I and P on the adult male human pelvis. Accordingly, it is concluded that the palpated data of Fig. 6 are the better of the two approximations. LOADING CORRIDORS - The loading corridors are plotted in Figs. 8-23. The intent of these cor- ridors is not to define an envelope of the family of responses of the six volunteers, but rather to pro- vide biomechanically sound criteria for defining the response of a 50th percentile adult male anthro- pomorphic dummy. The statistics of Table 1 indi- cate that the heights and weights of the volunteers produce HEW percentile numbers ranging from 19 to 98. Accordingly, one must expect a significant spread in the response data. However, the mean height and mean weight of the sample each approxi- mate the HEW 50th percentile data; and on this</page><page sequence="11">STATIC BENDING RESPONSE 3235 basis the mean response may be considered approp- riate for a 50th percentile dummy. The boundaries of the loading corridors "tend toward" a representa- tion of mean response plus and minus one-half a standard deviation. Thus, a dummy providing smooth response curves, hugging the centers of the corridors, would be judged to have optimum performance with respect to the requirements suggested herein. The loading corridors were constructed using straight line segments with the endpoint coordinates labeled, thereby enabling accurate reproduction by future users. The corridors are open-ended at the top. When a subject "bottoms-out" at the ends of the ranges of articulation, the moment will continue to in- crease, but there will be little change in the angle. Accordingly, a proper interpretation of the open- ended corridor is that it extends upward indefinitely. If, in the course of usage of an anthropomorphic dummy, very large moments are applied, the angle should remain within the specified limits. The human, of course, has an injury tolerance moment value which when exceeded would result in injury and further articulation. These tolerances have not been defined. It was noted in the TEST PROTOCOL section that there was no effort to maintain close control over the initial position of the volunteers. That is, among tests, there was some variation in the initial (zero moment) thorax-pelvis and pelvis-femur angles. This variation led to significant scatter in the tensed muscle tests because one can "lock-up" and resist the applied bending force to nominally the same degree, regardless of the initial angles involved. This phenomenon was accounted for in developing the tensed muscle corridors by computing the mean angle at zero moment, for the six volun- teers, and adding a correction factor to the angles so that each volunteers response curve initiated at a common point. The plotted data points do not reflect this correction factor; accordingly, the angular spreads appear quite large compared to the corridor widths in some of Figs. 8-23. Definition of the limits of articulation is impor- tant information for use in dummy development. It was important, therefore, to define the upper, open- ended portions of the loading corridors. The "bottom-out" angles were most apparent in the re- laxed tests and were defined from these data. This portion of the relaxed corridor was then incorpo- rated into the tensed corridor counterpart as well. Since the tensed muscle corridor shapes are a function of the particular initial angle configuration of the volunteers, it may not be appropriate to re- quire a surrogate of the tensed vehicle occupant to conform to these specific requirements. The angles of the seated configuration are likely not equivalent to the zero-moment angles of the corridors. The corridors cannot simply be translated (shifted) along the angle axis because the upper "bottom-out" portion must be assumed invariant. It appears reasonable, instead, to adjust the bottom (zero- moment portion) of the corridors as necessary, and to redefine the intermediate corridor points using linear interpolation to define the angle shifts. Some comments with regard to the criteria used in defining the loading corridors are pertinent. Statistical analyses utilized in evaluating trends in the response data included computer curve fitting programs defining least-squares regressions of moment on angle and of angle on moment. Also, means and standard deviations of moment data in finite angle increments and of angle data in finite moment increments were computed. In addition, some subjective decisions, based on studies of trends indicated by the responses of the individual volunteers, were necessary. Whereas the quanti- tative techniques offer rigorous, well-defined criteria for fitting the data points, they are not discriminating with regard to maintaining the unique features common among the individual volunteers ł responses. This is where the subjective analyses became important. The bottom (zero-moment) por- tion of each corridor was established using linear extrapolation of the data on each volunteer to define angles at zero moment. The corridor width at the bottom is nominally the mean value plus and minus one-half a standard deviation. Although most of the loading corridors are easily recognized to follow the data trends closely, some are not. It was felt, however, that corridors were necessary for each data set to enhance the usefulness of the data and to provide a unified basis for application of the results to dummy design prob- lems, mathematical modeling, and/or further dis- cussion. One may note that at zero-moment the corridor boundaries for relaxed forward and rearward bend- ing, under otherwise identical conditions, are not equivalent. Although the corridors overlap, there is a discontinuity. Since there is no justification for shifting the relaxed corridors, as explained for tensed corridors, it appears that there is a discrep- ancy in the data. It is postulated that the discrep- ancy is a result of shortcomings of the linear extrap- olation procedure utilized in computing the mean angle at zero moment. In actuality, the moment- angle relationship is perhaps highly nonlinear near zero moment. The resolution of the data is insuffi- cient to evaluate this situation with reasonable confidence; therefore, the corridors were not rede- fined to eliminate the zero -moment discontinuity. It is suggested, in using a forward-rearward pair of relaxed corridors in connection with dummy development, that the response be allowed to fall outside either one, but not both, of the two corridors for the first 310 N*m (200 lb in) of moment.</page><page sequence="12">3236 G. W. NYQUIST AND C. J. MURTON It was noted in the RESULTS that the thorax- pelvis data include the articulation of part of the thoracic spine (T8 through T12) in addition to lumbar articulation. Since a practical scheme for isolating only the lumbar articulation on a volunteer is not obvious, there was little choice in the matter. How- ever, since current dummies, and probably the next several generations of dummies, utilize rigid tho- racic spines, it is reasonable to add some of the thoracic articulation range to that of the lumbar region. It appears, therefore, that the thorax- pelvis corridors, without modifications, may be used to define response requirements for the dummy lumbar region. Analyses of the loading corridors indicate that the thorax-pelvis and pelvis-femur articulations are influenced by the degree of knee flexion. One can evaluate the influence by observing midrange angles of the upper, bottomed-out portion of the response corridors of Figs. 8-23. From Figs. 8 and 12 it is evidenced that the thorax-pelvis range of articu- lation with legs straight covers angles from 1. 44 rad (82°) to 3. 53 rad (202°), whereas with the knees flexed 1. 57 rad (90°), Figs. 10 and 14 indicate a range from 1.26 rad (72°) to 3. 76 rad (215°). Thus, flexing the knees from the legs -straight configura- tion to the right-angle configuration increases the full extension-to-full flexion thorax-pelvis range of motion from 2. 09 rad to 2. 50 rad (120° to 143° ) and enables greater degrees of flexion and extension. Similarly, from Figs. 16 and 20 it is evident that the pelvis-femur range of articulation with legs straight covers angles from 2.46 rad (141°) to 3.23 rad (185°), whereas with the knees flexed 1. 57 rad (90°), Figs. 18 and 22 indicate a range from 1. 86 rad (107°) to 3.05 rad (175°). Thus, flexing the knees from the legs -straight configuration to the right-angle configuration increases the full exten- sion-to-full flexion pelvis-femur range of motion from 0. 77 rad to 0. 19 rad (44° to 68° ) and enables a greater degree of flexion and a reduced degree of extension. A scan of individual plotted data points in Figs. 8-23 indicates that the maximum moment of applied force tolerated in flexion was 616 N* m (5450 lb in). The maximum in extension was 240 N-m (2120 lb in). In each case these data refer to Volunteer F JR. The maximum flexion moment occurred in a legs- straight test (Fig. 9), whereas the maximum extension moment occurred in a test with the knees flexed 1.57 rad (90°) (Fig. 15). CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions may be drawn from this study: 1. The relaxed and tensed lower torso bend- ing responses are significantly different from one another. The basic shapes of the loading corridors are not the same. 2. Flexing the knees from the legs-straight configuration to the right-angle configuration in- creases the full extension-to-full flexion thorax- pelvis range of motion from 2. 09 rad to 2. 50 rad (120 deg to 143 deg). The right-angle configuration affords both a greater degree of flexion and a greater degree of extension. * 3. Flexing the knees from the legs-straight configuration to the right-angle configuration in- creases the full extension-to-full flexion pelvis- femur range of motion from 0.77 rad to 1. 19 rad (44 deg to 68 deg). The right-angle configuration affords a greater degree of flexion; however, the degree of extension is reduced. * 4. The maximum moment of applied force tolerated by a volunteer in flexion was 616 N- m (5450 lb in). The maximum extension was 240 N- m (2120 lb in). RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations based on this research program are as follows: 1. The loading corridors suggested herein should be considered preliminary guidelines for 50th percentile adult male anthropomorphic dummy performance for interim use until dynamic response data become available. 2. A decision should be made with regard to dummy design philosophy. Should the dummy respond as a relaxed or as a tensed human, or perhaps in accordance with some intermediate criteria? If an intermediate criterion is adopted, new loading corridors should be constructed using those defined herein as guidelines. 3. Dynamic experiments should be pursued to establish the significance of rate-dependent effects. 4. Static and dynamic experiments should be pursued to define the lower torso bending re- sponses in the lateral direction and in oblique directions. 5. Torso torsion and shear biomechanical response requirements should be developed to complement the bending response definitions. 6. The lower torso bending responses of current dummy structures should be evaluated with respect to the performance requirements suggested herein.
