<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Roman Mansion Found in the City of David* Doron Ben- Ami Y ana T chekhanovets Israel Antiquities Authority ABSTRACT: The large peristyle building of the Late Roman period exposed at the Givati site in the City of David features solid dates marking both its phase of foun- dation and its demise. While its construction is dated to no later than the third century CE, the scores of coins found buried under the collapse point to its actual date of destruction, early in the second half of the fourth century CE. The archaeo- logical evidence suggests that this might be due to the earthquake that occurred in Palestine in 363 CE. The dates of construction and destruction of the Roman peri- style building have far-reaching consequences, for they reflect the spread of the Roman occupation over the southern part of the city in the time of Aelia Capitolina. The discovery of this building testifies that the southern hill witnessed new build- ing and occupation activities during the third century CE. INTRODUCTION At the close of the third century CE a large peristyle building was constructed on the north-western side of the City of David hill, on the eastern slope of the Tyropoeon Valley. As the remains of this building unfolded, it became apparent that they constitute part of an extraordinary architectural complex, extending across a large part of the excavation area (fig. 1). The structure continues further east and north, beyond the boundaries of the excavation. To date, it encompasses an area of c. 1,500 m2, but even a cautious estimate suggests that it originally extended over at least 2,000 m2. THE LATE ROMAN PERISTYLE BUILDING Prior to the construction of the peristyle building, deep foundation trenches were dug, cutting through the early strata. Despite their considerable depth (in places over 5 m), these foundations were not always laid on bedrock, but were found resting directly upon the early remains. The large open courtyard (L.1668), spanning over 250 m2, was the visual focus * The excavations are carried out on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) and financed by the Elad Association.

A stylobate surrounding the courtyard, as well as fragments of column bases and monolithic columns scattered across the courtyard (fig. 2), indi- cate that it was colonnaded, with roofed galleries (L.648, L.1700 and L.1710) around it. To date, eight of the rooms in the west wing, ten in the north wing, seven in the east wing and three in the south wing have been excavated. A second courtyard, located in the eastern side of the building (L.3890), was flanked by rooms, one (L.2567) with its original mosaic floor preserved in situ. The north-western part of the building has not yet been excavated, since a Byzantine building was constructed directly over it (fig. 2). This spacious peristyle building was constructed along the eastern slope of the eastern hill, with its western part dropping into the Tyropoeon Valley. During the excavation it became evident that the builders had had to adjust the structure to</page><page sequence="3">1 66 DORON BEN- AMI AND YANA TCHEKHANOVETS Fig. 2. The north-western part of the building; in foreground: northern row of pillar bases in the peristyle courtyard; in background: the Byzantine building (view to the north-west) accommodate the natural terrain. For this purpose, they built the north and west wings two storeys high and the eastern part of the building - the part close to the summit - only one storey high, on the same level as the upper storey of the north and west wings. The rooms on the ground floor had plainly plastered walls, most with packed earthen floors and a few with thin plaster floors. The external side of the walls, facing the courtyard, had a thick layer of white plaster. The ground floor ceilings were made of wood beams, supported by a central stone arch perched on two opposing pilasters. These pilasters were uncovered in some of the rooms (e.g., L.1693, L.2168 and L.1719); some of the arch stones were found in the building collapse. The many hundreds of tiles uncovered in the building collapse (see below) attest to its tiled roof. Various installations were found in some of the ground floor rooms. A round stone installation (L.1677; 1 m high; c. 1 m in diameter), uncovered in one of the rooms of the north wing (L. 1693), was probably used as a base for mill stones; the upper part was a column base in secondary use. Another installation, made of perpendicular stone slabs (L.2179), was found by the western wall of the same room. An installation made of two elongated stones topped by a stone slab (L.841) was found near the entrance of room L.636; it is shaped as a small cell. An instal- lation plastered in its interior (L.5032) was unearthed in room L.5033. A plastered niche, found in one of this room's walls, suggests that it may have served as a</page><page sequence="4">A ROMAN MANSION FOUND IN THE CITY OF DAVID 1 67 lararium. Since all these installations were found devoid of finds, it is difficult to determine their function conclusively. Many fresco and stucco fragments were uncovered in the collapse of the second storey. Although their fragmentary nature makes it difficult to reconstruct the original fresco compositions and layout, a preliminary analysis suggests that the decoration can be divided into two main groups.1 One group consists of geometric designs typical of the Hellenistic and Roman periods; these include mainly painted slabs of various basic colours: red and purple, or yellow ochre against a white background. Some fragments bear the intersecting curvilinear pattern of intense red medallions of circular bands of triangles, bordered by black lines. These fragments probably belonged to a central register in the decoration. The other group consists of vegetal motifs - acanthus, various leaves, wreathes and branches - as indicated by several fragments. No figurative repre- sentation was uncovered. These fragments differ from those of the former group by the higher artistic skill they exhibit and the free expressive manner in which they were executed. Broad fluent touches of the artist's brush create the illusion of plastic forms. The shapes of the objects are schematic without elaborate detail; they were accentuated by the contrast of shadow and light. The colour of these fragments is more composite, including various shades of green, yellow and red, as well as additional colours. Noteworthy is the use of complementary warm and cold hues in the same composition. One of the preserved fragments bears branches or wreaths executed exclusively in warm hues, with a combination of ochre, white and browii pigments. Vegetal motifs probably decorated the dividing registers of the walls and columns: one of the columns of the second storey was painted with long smooth leaves in cold hues of green, with deep shadows of long green leaves, delineated with black contour lines that create a calm, cooling impression. Fragments of mosaics from the floors of the upper storey were found scattered in the debris. The tesserae (c. 140 per 10 cm2) were produced of local stone in various colours - red, pink, yellow, grey, white and black - and exhibit high- quality workmanship. The surviving fragments were decorated with geometric patterns, such as wave bands, four-strand guilloche, and a pattern composed of squares, triangles and rhombs. Several architectural elements were uncovered in the collapse, some covered by fresco decoration. These include columns, cornice fragments and two pseudo- Ionic capitals, all of local limestone. The original function of the columns and capitals in the second storey is not certain. It appears that they stood in an open 1 The fresco fragments, currently undergoing analysis, will be published by Silvia Rozenberg and Naama Sharabi in a forthcoming volume of the IAA reports, along with the entire Late Roman material in the Givati Excavation Project.</page><page sequence="5">1 68 DORON BEN-AMI AND YANA TCHEKHANOVETS gallery or served in bicolumnar aedicula, somewhat similar to the decorated fa√ßades in the Villa of Sette Bassi (Ward-Perkins 1981: 206-210). Two underground water cisterns were found embedded in the peristyle court- yard. The northern one (L.1339) includes two interconnected rooms (with a volume of 50 m3), while the southern one (L.1689) contains one room (with a volume of 46 m3). The stone cisterns were plastered with hydraulic plaster. A series of stone arches covered by large stone slabs formed their roofs. The cisterns were fed by rain water, led down the broad tiled roof through clay pipes. The lower part of a gutter was found in situ descending from the roof adjacent to one of the courtyard corners and connecting into a pipe that led the rain water under the courtyard floor into the northern cistern. Two distinct phases have been detected in the peristyle courtyard. The original courtyard enclosed a garden. Several short stone pillars, less than 1 m high, were found scattered throughout the courtyard; two of them were found irt situ, partially submerged, in the north-western corner of the courtyard (fig. 1). The tops of these pillars are wide in relation to their average diameter, indicating that they served as a base for some object, not preserved. An additional pillar was found in situ, near a threshold leading to a room in the north wing. The pillar top was formed into a slightly protruding flat circle. Three similar pillars were found scattered around the courtyard. Unlike the massive columns and bases, which served as part of the original peristyle, the short pillars have no constructional value. They probably functioned as stands for objects that adorned the garden, none of which were found. Similar peristyle gardens were discovered in many Pompeian houses, includ- ing the House of Vettii, the House of Sallust and the House of Dioscuri (Jashemski 1979: 34-41). These gardens often contained decorative elements, such as stone and bronze vessels and statues (Farrar 1998: 97-129). Sometime during the fourth century CE, the garden soil of the original phase was sealed by a white plastered floor, which ran to the peristyle and galleries and abutted the walls of the rooms surrounding the peristyle. All other attributes of the courtyard (its size, its peristyle nature, and its decorative elements) were maintained. This magnificent building came to a violent end in the fourth century CE. In the western wing, the floor of the living area collapsed, burying nearly all the remains of the ground floor (fig. 3). The surviving walls of the ground storey, in some cases preserved to a height of over 3 m, were found under massive heaps of stones from the walls of the upper storey. A large crack cuts through the stone slabs covering the underground water systems. These, along with other finds retrieved from the building, testify to the immense catastrophe it underwent. The ceramic assemblages found in the collapse and below it, on the floors of the building, are dated to the Late Roman-Early Byzantine period (third to fourth centuries CE). The dominant types are arched-rim basins and rouletted bowls</page><page sequence="6">A ROMAN MANSION FOUND IN THE CITY OF DAVID 1 69 (some including an appliqu√© anthropomorphic head or rosette decoration), jugs and a variety of oil lamps (mainly of round-discus and Beit Nattif types). The scores of coins found buried under the collapse in various rooms - the latest of which are dated to 361 CE - provide a terminus post quem for the destruction. Consequently, the violent end of the structure could have been the result of the earthquake that occurred in Palestine in 363 CE (Russell 1985: 42; Amiran, Arieh and Turcotte 1994: 265). Indeed, none of the coins retrieved from secure loci inside the building are dated later than 363 CE. DISCUSSION The dates of the construction and demise of the Roman building uncovered in the City of David are well established. While its destruction in the second half of the fourth century was previously established,2 the date of its foundation - during Fig. 3. Collapse in two rooms (view to the north-west) 2 In some preliminary articles the building was dated to the early Byzantine period (fourth century CE; see Ben- Ami and Tchekhanovets 2008: 64-66), on the basis of the material found in the destruction layer and before excavations penetrated below the floors to provide substantial data to determine its founding date.</page><page sequence="7">1 70 DORON BEN-AMI AND YANA TCHEKHANOVETS the Late Roman period - was only established with certainty as the excavation progressed. Noteworthy among the coins uncovered within the building's walls are the provincial Roman coins, the latest of which is a relatively rare coin from the days of Diocletian (Alexandria mint; 285 CE),3 providing a terminus post quem for the building's construction.4 Consequently, the building was in use for a relatively short period from the late third century CE to early in 363 CE. During this period, only minor alterations were carried out within the building, including the elevation of the floors (particularly in the ground storey), with the courtyard displaying two phases. The Roman building featured an abundance of Roman tiles in its collapse. To date, over 100 tiles (one complete), bearing the Tenth Roman Legion's stamp impression, have been found. The Roman nature of the building is clearly attested to by its architectural wealth and its plan, and especially by the finds unearthed within its collapse. Among these, a stone proteome of a boxer (fig. 4), a gold earring set with gems, a few gemmae, a carved bone and an ivory with mythologi- cal scenes and others finds should be singled out. Evidently, the building was part of the Roman city. It is hoped that a full expo- Fig. 4. Stone proteome of a boxer sure of its various units will clarify its nature and function. To the best of our knowledge, close contemporaneous parallels from Israel are absent. The complex uncovered at Ein Yael (Edelstein 1989), the one in the Beth Guvrin area (Abel 1924) and several others (for discussion, see Applebaum 1989; and see references therein) bear the characteristics of countryside villas ( villae rusticate ). Considering the location and overall charac- teristics of the building under discussion, the primary meaning of the term villa seems inadequate here (Percival 1988; Smith 1997), and the term 'peristyle mansion' may apply. Close contemporaneous parallels are found in Syria, where they date from the second to the fourth century CE. The urban mansions of the Antiochian, Apamean and Palmyran elites adopted the Hellenistic house plan, with a peristyle flanked by porticoes. The 3 We would like to thank D.T. Ariel for his valuable advice and numismatic readings. 4 It should be pointed out that this terminus may apply only to the construction of the specific wall in which the coin was found, in which case the building may be earlier.</page><page sequence="8">A ROMAN MANSION FOUND IN THE CITY OF DAVID 1 7 1 Syrian peristyle structures spread over large areas - sometimes over 1 ,000 m2 - and were often decorated with splendid mosaics and frescoes (Baity 1989; Morvillez 2007). The Hellenistic construction style and plan had a significant influence on the Latin architecture of the third-fourth centuries CE. The traditional plan of the Latin house was gradually abandoned in favour of the rich peristyle mansion (Calza and Becatti 1974: 22). 'Hellenisation' is also apparent in the adoption of the multiple-storey concept in private houses. The typical Roman domus was usually built with one main storey, sometimes with a relatively modest upper floor. However, the Hellenistic oriental architecture was familiar for centuries, with two- or three-storey private buildings (Lawrence 1983: 325). Like other Hellenistic influences, such as the peristyle building plan, the concept of multiple storeys in private houses was gradually adopted in the Roman world. This is reflected in the architecture of the cosmopolitan city of Ostia (second-third centu- ries CE), where some of the large peristyle houses (House of Fishes, House of Fortuna Annonaria) were built according to the latest Antioch fashion (Ward- Perkins 1981: 211-212). Since the complete plan of the large peristyle building excavated at the site is as yet unknown, it may have been a complete rectangular peristyle, like the Achilles House' in Palmyra (Stillwell 1 96 1 : 48), or a three-winged peristyle, like the 'Atrium House' in Daphne, near Antioch (Baity 1989: 409-411) and the 'Consoles House' in Apamea (Baity 1989: 412-416). In the Syrian houses the peristyle is surrounded by rooms, usually not symmetrically organised. A similar arrangement appears to characterise the peristyle building under discussion. The dates of the construction and destruction of the Roman peristyle building have far-reaching consequences, providing an opportunity to establish the accu- rate dates of the pottery assemblages of the late third-early fourth centuries CE. The establishment of the large peristyle building in this part of the city in the late third century CE reflects the spread of the Roman occupation over the southern part of the city in the time of Aelia Capitolina, thus providing substantial evidence for the extent of building activity in the Roman city. Prior to this discovery, the archaeological remains dated to the time of Aelia Capitolina in the southern parts of the city were extremely limited (see the recently uncovered remains of the Roman Cardo and other related finds north of the Dung Gate; Weksler-Bdolah et al. 2009). The eastern hill, extending from the Temple Mount to the Siloam Pool, was largely abandoned since the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, as attested by the extensive excavations conducted in this part of the city. Presumably, throughout the second and most of the third century CE, the eastern hill was not within the core area of the Roman settlement. The discovery of a large peristyle mansion provides first-hand archaeological evidence of the expansion of the Roman city southward in the late third century CE, testifying, along with other archaeological</page><page sequence="9">1 72 DORON BEN- AMI AND YANA TCHEKHANOVETS evidence in the eastern hill, to the new building activity in this period.5 The previ- ously accepted view that the eastern hill was beyond the boundaries of Aelia Capitolina (Bahat 1996: 59, 61 ; Tsafrir 1999: 161) and that the hill was quarried to provide raw material for the buildings of that city (Kenyon 1964: 13; 1966: 88) should be reconsidered in light of this new archaeological evidence. 5 This southward expansion is beyond the scope of the present article and will be discussed by the authors elsewhere.
