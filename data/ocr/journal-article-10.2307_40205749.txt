Dedications of tripods by individuals were expressions of prominent social status. Com- munal dedications made in the distinctively Boiotian rite of the tripodephoria were symbolic actualizations of power relations between the dominant center and its periphery. Remains of two suntagmata of tripods at the sanctuary of the hero Ptoios at Kastraki, near Akraiphia, provide evidence for the physi- cal ambience of the sanctuary, the form of the tripods, and the collective rites associated with the dedications. INTRODUCTION The Greek tripod cauldron served as a powerful, panhellenic religious symbol from the Geometric through the Roman period (Fig. I).1 Neverthe- less, it would be problematic to suppose that it was adopted without any differentiation of meaning throughout the Greek world. Rather, I would argue that the symbolism of the tripod can be understood only in terms of its local manifestations, which were as rich and variegated as the cultural landscape of the Greek world throughout antiquity. Perhaps nowhere can the career of this long-lived symbol be better sketched than in Boiotia, l.This article developed from a paper presented at the Ninth Interna- tional Conference on Boiotian Antiq- uities, University of Manitoba, Win- nipeg, Canada in 1998. 1 am grateful to the organizers, Michael B. Cosmopou- los and John M. Fossey, for creating a congenial atmosphere of scholarly ex- change and informal discussion that facilitated the generation and develop- ment of many of the ideas presented here. My work was made possible by generous leaves of absence and financial support from the Department of Art and Art History and the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin. Pierre Guillon's meticulous publication of the sanctuary at Kastraki offers invaluable information on an important site that is no longer well preserved. I am grateful to Penelope Davies and Mark Munn for their suggestions, and especially to Amy Papalexandrou for her criticism and for imparting to me her enthusiasm about Boiotia. I would also like to thank Priscilla Keswani, and the editor and anonymous reviewers of Hesperia, for many constructive comments. Barbara Kierewicz undertook tedious revisions of the digital reconstruction of tripods with patience and good humor.

The tenacity of the tripod in Boiotian culture is attested by both literary sources and archaeological data. Pausanias explicitly notes the presence of dedicated tripods at the sanctuaries of Apollo Ismenios and Herakles at Thebes and at the sanctuary of the Muses on Mt. Helikon as late as the 2nd century a.d.3 There is abundant archaeological evidence for dedications of monumental tripods from Mt. Ptoon near Akraiphia in the Archaic, Early Classical, and Hellenistic periods. Numerous tripod bases attest to the presence of other costly tripods in the civic center of Orchomenos during the Hellenistic period. Thanks to several important studies, there is enough archaeological evidence to reconstruct, in broad outline, the religious biography of the tripod in ancient Boiotia. The material from Ptoon has been thoroughly discussed by Guillon in a two-volume monograph that is, to date, the only diachronic treatment of Boiotian tripods.4 The material from Orchomenos, which is still largely embedded in the masonry of a 9th-century church 2. This conservatism may be inferred from Pausanias's account of Boiotia. Pausanias was very careful in perceiving, recording, and presenting the religious traditions and phenomena of ancient Greece.

I also discuss the tripod monuments in the Akraiphian sanctuary of the hero Ptoios at Kastraki, examining their centrality in ritual events and practices with a distinctively Boiotian character. TRIPODS AS SYMBOLS IN PANHELLENIC AND BOIOTIAN CONTEXTS While there are abundant occurrences of the tripod cauldron in Boiotian contexts, no previous study has attempted to synthesize the evidence and interpret the symbolic meanings of the tripod in the various cultic envi- ronments of ancient Boiotia. How did this intricate object, which figured so prominently among the earliest dedications at the great panhellenic sanctuaries during the Geometric period, come to play an important com- municational role in Archaic Boiotia? Did this dedicatory custom conform to a standard cultural template, or were there significant variations in Boiotian ritual practice? 5. Amandry and Spyropoulos 1974.

Ducat 1971.</page><page sequence="4">254 NASSOS PAPALEXANDROU In approaching these questions, it is important to stress the complexity of any diachronic study of religious dedications. The fragmentary remnants of tripods in the archaeological record can hardly echo the experiences they were intended to generate. It is extremely difficult to reconstruct the chain of decisions and procedural steps that resulted in the setting up of tripods in Boiotian sanctuaries, let alone the nexus of cultic behaviors associated with these monuments in time and space. Moreover, any attempt to trace the career of the tripod as a dedicatory or cultic object in a specific regional context must also take into account the shared values associated with it on a panhellenic level from the Geometric period onward. The cognitive background in which tripods were invested with signifi- cance by their dedicants, viewers, and users was expressed first and foremost in the Iliad, the Odyssey, and a multiplicity of mythical traditions.7 Further- more, during the 8th and 7th centuries B.C., numerous tripods in Olympia, Delphi, and Athens were provided with their own semantic apparatus, namely, iconic images in the form of three-dimensional anthropomorphic attachments in bronze. In the 8th century, these figures were warriors, each with an uplifted, spear-holding right arm. This schema of imagery registered the fame or glory (icAioq) of the individual dedicants. The reciprocal relationship between the bronze attachments and the tripods to which they were attached encoded a wide range of messages. A symbol of wealth, authoritative discourse, and political power, the tripod was celebrated as the most prestigious attribute of the dedicant, whose heroic status was assertively proclaimed by his iconic avatar on the object of his dedicatory gesture. This schema was a rendering in visual terms of the Homeric ideal of leadership: "to be a doer of heroic deeds and a master of speech" (//. 9.443).8 It may be best understood as an ideo- graphic sign of the Homeric notions of 8o\)pikAa)to&lt;; and ocixuTitd. These terms were indispensable in celebrating the kleos of the dedicant and his offering. In the 7th century, the warrior schema continued to be represented on tripods, but it was gradually supplanted by a different iconography. In the new schema, pairs of naked youths, often depicted with long hair and sometimes wearing Corinthian helmets, were combined heraldically to sup- port the round handles of the tripod to which they were attached. This was an abbreviated way of showing that the figures carried the entire tripod on which they stood. Such a synoptic, narrative arrangement marked a radical departure from the iconic rigidity of the warrior schema. Although it is amenable to many interpretations, the occurrence of the handle-holder iconography on monumental tripods of impressive dimensions, weight, and costliness suggests that it was devised to com- municate a novel political statement. In a corporate context, the depiction of collaborating handle-holders emphasized the significance of the tripod as a shared, collective offering by a community to a god. The dedication of a costly and, by tradition, hallowed object made manifest the collective representation of the community in the eyes of the gods and the panhellenic society of humans.9 Thus, in both the Geometric and the Early Archaic periods, tripods played a central role in public rituals that dramatized the messages embedded in their anthropomorphic attachments. 7.

It seems likely that the local elite would have been eager to express themselves in terms of a dedicatory code so widely employed in the otherworldly ambience of the great panhellenic sanctuaries.10 The tripods, laden with material and symbolic value, were intended to establish concrete and intimate links not only between the dedicants and their recipient gods, but also between the dedicants and their aristocratic peers inside and out- side Boiotia. Nevertheless, in no instance to date has Boiotia yielded any tripods of the types that were current in the panhellenic sanctuaries of the Geometric period.11 This situation may be due, of course, to accidents of preservation.12 It is possible that a cultic site with deposits of early tripods, such as the recently excavated sanctuary of Apollo and Artemis at nearby Kalapodi (Phokis),13 still awaits discovery. The scarcity of early prestigious tripods in Boiotian sanctuaries may be the result of other factors, however. Local authorities or dedicants at the sanctuaries of early Olympia, Delphi, and Dodona may have had the power to control or even claim as exclusive the usage of expressive media such as tripods or certain types of figurative works. It is also possible that the local elite resisted the dedication of tri- pods in Boiotian sanctuaries at an early stage. Such resistance would have enhanced their aura as users of tripods away from home, while setting a clear standard as to what type of dedicatory behavior was acceptable in Boiotian sanctuaries.14 If the latter scenario is true, then Hesiod's well-known dedication in honor of the Muses at Mt. Helikon {Op. 654-657) may well have been an untraditional or even revolutionary gesture, motivated by his need to proclaim as unassailable his claims to divinely inspired authority and po- etic prowess. Was Hesiod's usage of the tripod an attempt to invest an old revered symbol with new meanings? Most of the early Boiotian tripods that have been well documented in the archaeological record date from the 6th century B.C., long after the crys- tallization of the two dedicatory modalities - individual and collective - in the great panhellenic sanctuaries. Despite this temporal distance, there is enough evidence to argue that both modalities were operative from the onset of tripod dedications in Boiotian sanctuaries, and that they remained so for a very long time. Tripods in Boiotia were dedicated by individuals as symbolic affirmations of their prestige and social status. They were also dedicated in collective gestures articulating the territorial definition of a 10. Morris (1997, 2000) and Strom (1992) have stressed the emerging character of sanctuaries as otherworldly contexts for the competitive display of elites in the emerging poleis. 11.

The two poros tripods from Plataia in the mu- seum at Thebes have been dated to the 7th century B.C., mainly on the basis of their incised decoration, perhaps an awkward imitation of the elaborate bronze tripods from the panhellenic sanctuaries; see Pharaklas 1970. 12. Numerous representations of tri- pod cauldrons in Boiotian Geometric pottery demonstrate that these objects were well known and valued as a pres- tige symbol in Boiotia as early as the 8th century B.C.

The individual dedications exemplify the survival of an aristocratic practice that originated in the pan- hellenic sanctuaries of the Geometric period, when the tripod functioned primarily as a symbol of authoritative discourse and political power. The collective dedication of tripods indicates a practice structurally opposed to individual dedications, one that expressed the symbolic transference of authority by a community to its patron god or divinity. DEDICATIONS BY INDIVIDUALS Dedications of tripods by individuals in Boiotian sanctuaries are first at- tested in the 7th century B.C. The earliest documented occurrence is the dedication mentioned above, made by Hesiod in honor of the Muses on Mt. Helikon (O/&gt;. 654-657).15 Hesiod claimed that his tripod was a prize in a poetic funeral contest at Chalkis, but the consecration of this highly valued object in a religious context symbolized more than Hesiod s desire to give the Muses their due. On the one hand, it was a material affirmation of the poet's divinely inspired capacity for articulating his political and poetic wisdom in the authoritative medium of the hexameter. On the other hand, it is clear from Hesiod's account that the establishment of a tripod at the site of the Muses' revelation to him was tantamount to the foundation rite of a famous and important sanctuary. Hesiod s tripod became the sanctuary's cornerstone, a sign that was to mark the site forever as a context of and for miraculous happenings. Hesiod's gesture thus expanded the expressive range of a symbol that had previously served as a token of victory and the special status emanating from it. The significance of the tripod as a marker of poetic status is inherent in the tripods Herodotos saw in the sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios at Thebes (Hdt. 5.59-61). These tripods are usually discussed in relationship to the origins of the Greek alphabet because of Herodotos's explicit mention of epigrams inscribed on them in Phoenician characters. Much less atten- tion has been paid to the content of these epigrams, which, forged or not, must have echoed a pragmatic dedicatory ethos.16 They are of particular interest here because they exemplify, in a specific Boiotian context, the 15. On the Muses, their sanctuary, and the cult, see Schachter 1986, pp. 147-179. 1 have argued elsewhere that the bronze dedication of Mantik- los, the well-known figure in the Mu- seum of Fine Arts in Boston (F. Bart- lett Collection 03.997), should be inter- preted as a tripod attachment, fash- ioned in the tradition of the prestigious warrior figures of the Geometric period (see Papalexandrou 1997; 2005, pp. 84- 86). If correctly interpreted, this figure would be the earliest archaeological evi- dence for a tripod dedicated by an indi- vidual in a Boiotian sanctuary. In terms of format, diction, and overall style, the dedicatory epigram on this bronze resembles the epigrams at the Theban Ismenion reported by Herodotos (5.57-61). 16. Scholars such as West (1985, pp. 289-295) and Powell (1991, p. 6) are all too quick to dismiss these tri- pods and their epigrams as forgeries. The epigrams most likely record prev- alent beliefs about the tripod dedicants, whose kleos must have been acknowl- edged before the inscription of the epi- grams. Moreover, the epigrams do not assert that they were written by the alleged authors of the dedications (Amphitryon, Skaios, Laodamas). Rather, they attribute authorship of dedication according to norms current at the moment of the inscription. See the pertinent comments by Raubit- schek (1991, p. 256), who dates the epigrams to the late 7th or early 6th century B.C. and comments that "gaben aber die Inschriften eine Tradition wieder, die in eine fruhere Zeit zuriick- reihte und sich an die hochaltertumli- chen Dreifusse wohl geometricher Zeit ankniipfte."

As Hesiod clearly states in the Theogony, in early Greece usage or mastery of the hexameter, the meter of authoritative discourse, was a form of political capital no less important than outstanding competence in battle or illustrious descent (Theog 79-93).17 Consequently, the messages embedded in these legendary tripods had the value of powerful, indisputable pronouncements not only because of their literal content and the sacred ambience in which they were experienced, but also because of the persuasive resonance of their poetic mode. The first tripod mentioned by Herodotos is a dedication of Amphi- tryon, the mortal parent of Herakles: "Amphitryon dedicated me upon returning from the Teleboae" (Hdt. 5.59). There is no doubt that this tripod was inscribed to substantiate its attribution to a prominent persona of the heroic age of Thebes. Pointing to a dedicatory gesture by one of the famous protagonists of myth and legend, this tripod ranked as a venerable relic and proof of the Ismenions establishment in the heroic age. But how is one to explain the prior association of a tripod dedication with Am- phitryon? Pausanias, who saw the same tripod 600 years after Herodotos, thought that Amphitryon's gesture was meant to celebrate the partici- pation of young Herakles in the Theban rite of the daphnephoria (Paus. 9.10.4).18 The association of the tripod with a specific rite of passage, one that marked the official entrance of Theban youths to citizen status, has interesting implications. In Pausanias s day, it was customary for the young protagonists in the daphnephoria to dedicate a tripod to Apollo Ismenios commemorating their participation in the rite and their tenure as priests of Apollo.19 Pausanias clearly states that the daphnephoroi were members of prominent aristocratic families (nociSa oikoi) xe 8ok{jlio\)). This fact, in conjunction with the structural similarities of the rite with practices current at Delphi, suggests that the daphnephoria was a rite of passage exclusive to the members of the ruling aristocracy.20 Thus, on this occasion, the dedication of a tripod to the patron god of the Theban polis was not only an act of piety, but also an exclusive means of sanctioning a young individuals claim to prominent social status. Walter Burkert has emphasized that the young daphnephoros 17. For discussion, see Papalexan- drou 2005, pp. 47-48. 18. There is no reason to argue for the presence of two tripods of Amphi- tryon at the Ismenion. I believe that Herodotos and Pausanias saw the same tripod, a formidable relic of the heroic age. Pausanias stressed the outstanding character of this venerable object in terms both of its antiquity and the 86£a of the dedicant (Paus. 9.10.4: 'Ercupavnq 8e uataaxa tni xe &amp;pxoci6tt|ti mi xov &amp;va0evxo&lt;; Tfl 56£fl xpinoxx;). Herodotos's tone is not so emphatic, but he also commented on the antiquity of the tripod (Hdt. 5.59: mice Ad'iov xov Aap8dKO\) xov noA,\)8(bpo'o xov Kd5iiau). It is possible that with the passage of time the inscription Hero- dotos saw was no longer legible, and that Amphitryon's tripod was associ- ated with the daphnephoria of Hera- kles. 19. On the daphnephoria at Thebes, see Nilsson [1906] 1995, pp. 164-165; and Schachter 2000. Schachter (2000, pp. 114, 117) points out that Pausa- nias is the only source associating the dedication of a tripod with a rite of passage and considers this practice a "later misunderstanding of an earlier version of the rite" (p. 114), perhaps arising as late as the 1st century a.d. I believe that this particular usage of the tripod need not be so late, espe- cially if one takes into account the much earlier evidence from Delphi concerning the explicit association of the tripod with an initiatory rite.

The wording of the epigram Herodotos saw clearly links Amphitryon s dedication with an event at the land of the Teleboae, however, which raises an interesting question. What event in the land of the legendary Teleboae merited monumentalization in the form of a prestigious tripod in the civic sanctuary of Thebes? According to the pseudo-Hesiodeian^j/w, Amphitryon and his wife were not indigenous Thebans. They were strangers who sought refuge in Thebes after Amphitryon had murdered his father-in-law, an event that resulted in his expulsion from his native country ([Sc] 1-13).22 The same source makes it clear that his naturalization as aTheban could not be ful- filled unless his marriage with Alkmene was consummated. But this could not occur unless he waged war against the enemies of Thebes in order to cleanse himself from the agos of murder ([Sc] 14^19). Amphitryon fought valiantly against theTaphians and the Teleboae and defeated them. He thus became a legitimate member of the Theban polity, as well as an earthly alter ego of Zeus, who impregnated Alkmene with Herakles the same night she conceived Iphiklos with Amphitryon ([Sc.] 26-31). I suggest that Amphitryon's tripod combined the prestigious referen- tiality of the Greek tripod with the authoritative effect of the hexameter, serving as a visual commentary on the subtext of this important episode in the epic past ofThebes, along with the ideology it articulated. Amphitryon's tripod at the Ismenion was perceived as more than a token of piety or a sign of victory by the victorious hero. I would argue that the Thebans saw in this religious gesture a symbolic manifestation of his accession to legitimate civic status and power. His tripod was set up in the sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios, the patron god of the city-state, as a perpetual pointer to Amphitryon's services to his new adoptive homeland, to the accession to political and military power that this entailed, and to his begetting of offspring - a future member of the community. Consequently, there is an implicit correspondence between the epic connotations of Amphitryon's tripod at the Ismenion and the tradition reported by Pausanias that the same object celebrated his son's coming of age. The former celebrated Amphitryon's coming-of-age as a Theban; the latter transposed it to his son Herakles and an important civic rite ofThebes, the daphnephoria. The second tripod Herodotos mentioned (5.61) also featured an au- thoritative statement inscribed in dactylic hexameters: Aoco8dp,a&lt;; xputo8' oc\&gt;t6&lt;; etioKoncp AnoAAcovi jLioDvapxecov dveOriKe xeiv rcepiKaAAeq ayaAjLia. During his rulership, Laodamas himself dedicated the tripod to the far-darter Apollo, a very pleasing gift for you, Apollo. Laodamas, according to Herodotos the son and successor of Eteocles, was here the dedicant of a prestigious gift of a tripod to Apollo Ismenios - an 21.Burkertl985,p.97. 22.

Laodamas s dedicatory gesture clearly associated his political power with a tripod and the poetic affirmation of his sovereignty in hexameter form. The third tripod Herodotos (5.60) described at the Ismenion carried an epigram that is reflective of a different dedicatory practice: Imux; 7COYjia%ecov ue eicr|p6A,cp ArcoMxovi viicriaaq ave9r|Ke xeiv rcepiKaAAeq aya^ua. Skaios, winner in a boxing context, dedicated me to Apollo the far-shooter, a very pleasing gift for you. This epigram is once again replete with heroic overtones. It commemorates in hexameters the kleos of a certain Skaios, who, Herodotos suggests, was the son of Hippokoon, a contemporary of Oidipous. Skaios was an otherwise unattested persona of myth whose fame seems to have survived in Boiotian lore down to the time of Herodotos. Skaios was awarded this tripod in a boxing contest in a manner reminiscent of the wrestling match of Iliad 23. Again, we are confronted with the same pattern noted above: victory, pres- tige, and status were always interdependent in Archaic Greek thought.24 The literary evidence regarding individual dedications of tripods may be supplemented by the material evidence from the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoion. As the thorough study by Jean Ducat has shown, in the Archaic period several tripods were dedicated not only to Apollo Ptoios but also to Athena Pronaia.25 The evidence is extremely fragmentary, but enough has survived for a partial, yet secure, reconstruction of the overall appearance of these monumental dedications. Ducat published 12 poros fragments from tripod dedications, 11 of which originally belonged to the central supports of the bronze cauldrons; another came from a triangular base.26 These items, along with two rectangular blocks that originally served as bases27 and five preserved bronze fragments from tripods,28 constitute all the evidence we have regarding the Archaic tripod dedications at the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoon. Most of the central columns originally bore dedicatory inscriptions in the Boiotian script, but only three among them are legible enough to reveal 23. In ancient traditions Laodamas's fate was unstable during and after the war of the Seven against Thebes. See REXXBIX 1924, col. 697, s.v. Lao- damas (K. Meuli). The tripod at the Ismenion must have functioned as an unquestionable affirmation of Lao- damas's succession to the throne of his father.

The most fully preserved, which is dated late in the first quarter of the 6th century, identifies a single dedicant named Euagon.29 The other two would seem to represent joint dedications by two individuals.30 The example of Euagon resembles the individual dedications at the Ismenion.The practice involving two dedicants is the more usual one at Ptoon, especially during the Late Archaic period, when even monumental kouroi in stone were offered jointly by pairs of dedicants.31 Unfortunately, none of the surviving inscriptions allow us to reconstruct the circumstances associated with the dedication of tripods at the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoon. These occasions may have been comparable, however, to those inferred from the dedicatory inscriptions at the Ismenion. The Ismenion dedications exalted the dedicants' claims to prestige and power in visual form. The physical characteristics of the Late Archaic tripods at Ptoon are similar: they were expensive, monumental constructions in terms of their materials and size, combining poros stone with bronze. These constructions required a considerable expenditure of labor and materials.32 Their introduction around the Temple of Apollo must have entailed a considerable reconfiguration of both the physical and the concep- tual space of the public areas of the sanctuary, along with their hierarchies of emphasis and importance.33 To be sure, these monuments were not always as costly as the large stone kouroi erected in large numbers during the Archaic period at the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoon. Nevertheless, the traditional character of the tripod, already an ancient symbol at the time of the kouroi, must have imparted a particularly venerable aura to these monuments.34 The last well-documented category of individual dedications of Boio- tian tripods consists of a group of choregic monuments from Orchome- nos.35 Twenty-five tripod bases, most of them inscribed with a dedication, were found in or near the city theater. Several of the tripod bases were visibly - and perhaps intentionally - included as spolia in the masonry of the nearby church of the Virgin of Skripou (Fig. 3), an edifice dating to a.d. 873/4 and built entirely from architectural members of dismantled ancient structures on the site.36 The dedicatory inscriptions on these monu- ments, all of which date from the 3rd century B.C., include the names of 29.

Guillon (1943a, p. 59) conjec- tures that the tripods at Perdikovrysi were originally arranged "le long d'une voie d'acces," especially on the inter- mediate terrace where the massive rectangular bases were probably set up "de part et d'autre d'une allee qui, entre les deux groupes d'ediflces de la terrasse aboutissait a Tacces menage dans la terrasse du temple." Moreover, Ducat (1971, pp. 382-383) suggests that the oblong foundation between the east facade of the classical temple and the altar may have supported an alignment of tripods, indicated by the fact that "sur cette fondation se sont alignees, et dans un cas, s'est appuyee, quatre bases de trepied." These form a suntagma that runs parallel to the east facade of the temple. The southernmost base is triangular in shape (see Ducat 1971, plan B). The date of the bases and the long foundation is uncertain. 34. We cannot exclude the possibil- ity that monumental kouroi and tri- pods were erected as combined dedica- tions. Given the present state of the evidence for the original contexts and spacing of these monuments, however, this hypothesis cannot be pursued fur- ther here. The kouros type, in terms of its iconography and content, is akin to the symbolism of the tripod as early as the Late Geometric period. See Papalexandrou 2005, pp. 164-170, 189-204. 35.

It is, therefore, not accidental that the choregoi belonged to prominent Orchomenian families, members of which often held important political positions. For example, the choregos Pedakleis, son of Kephesiades, was the father of an Orchomenian polemarch.38 Similarly, the choregos Eucharidas, son of Damatrichos, was polemarch at Orchomenos around 285 B.C.39 The choregos Euroulochos, son of Dionysios, held the archon- ship the year he won the choregic contest.40 The political significance of these tripod dedications is patent: the polis of Orchomenos set up the expensive tripods as prizes in the musical contests in honor of Dionysos, only to receive them back stamped with the kleos of its victorious citizens. The erection of the choregic tripods in a prominent public place at Orchomenos, within or at least not far from the agora and the burial site of Hesiod,41 provided the city with visual 37.

Pausanias (9.38.3) correlates, albeit vaguely, the location of Hesiod s tomb with the treasury of Minyas. See Wal- lace 1985 for an attempt to resuscitate Schliemann's old hypothesis that He- siod was buried in the tholos of Min- yas.

The choregoi, in turn, conspicuously emphasized their prominent status in Orchomenian society. As in the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoon, however, we have no evidence for the exact placement of these monuments or for their spatial and visual correspondences with one another and with other prominent landmarks of the civic center of Orchomenos. We are left to wonder what physical or perceptual movements they were meant to create and how their arrangement affected the communication of their message. COLLECTIVE DEDICATIONS Sanctuary of Ptoios at Kastraki An important example of collective dedicatory practice comes from the sanctuary of the local hero Ptoios at Kastraki, located 2 km southeast of Akraiphia (modern Akraiphnion) on Mt. Ptoon (Figs. 4, 5).42 Here the bases of at least 29 tripods, ranging in date from the Late Archaic period to the mid-5th century B.C., were discovered mostly in situ (Figs. 6-9). Today, only part of a single tripod base survives at the site (Fig. 10). The tripods were erected in ceremonial alignments framing the road from the sanctuary to the city of Akraiphia and the path from the lower terrace of the sanctuary to the temple on the south terrace.43 Some of the bases recorded by Guillon are of exceptional size: among the examples illustrated in Figures 8 and 9, base 14, consisting of four rectangular slabs, measures 1.87 x 1.79 m; base 15, with its northernmost slab missing, originally measured 1.88 x 1.90 m. The tripods they supported were the largest in the documented sequence of tripods at Kastraki. Guillon emphasizes that it is not accidental that these tripods (especially no. 15) formed the immediate backdrop of the performative space of the lower terrace.44 The bases at Kastraki afford unparalleled evidence for the physical setting of this type of dedication. In striking contrast to the tripods at the sanctuary of Apollo, all of the tripods at Kastraki were collective dedications by the city of Akraiphia. Their nature is attested by numerous dedicatory inscriptions that are still legible on the remnants of the central columnar supports.45 The length of the columnar supports, one of which is preserved intact (see below, Fig. 13), suggests that the tripods often attained monumental dimensions, with heights ranging between 1.50 and 2.50 m (Fig. II).46 The costli- ness of these monuments affirms the prosperity of the city of Akraiphia, 42.

Papalexandrou which is also evident in the wealth of the city's cemeteries and in the qual- ity of certain individual dedications in the nearby sanctuary of Apollo at Perdikovrysi.47 In addition to demonstrating the wealth of the community, these tri- pods may also express the centrality of the indigenous hero Ptoios and his sanctuary within the collective identity of Akraiphia. Guillon interpreted the tripods at Kastraki as signifiers of Akraiphia's local particularism, proposing that the cult at Kastraki emerged in reaction to the presumed deposition of the hero from Perdikovrysi by Thebes in favor of Apollo and Athena Pronaia during the 7th or early 6th century.48 Central to his argu- ment, which presupposes a state of hostility between Thebes and Akraiphia, was the a priori assumption that tripods were exclusive to the cult of the hero, whereas the monumental stone kouroi were associated exclusively with Theban practice. Guillon's theory has been decisively refuted by 47. Cemeteries: Andreiomenou 1996; Vlachoyianni 2002, pp. 339-349; Whitley 2002-2003, pp. 46-47; 2004- 2005, pp. 44-45.

Under what circumstances was the tripod selected to convey messages regarding the relationship between Akraiphia and her local hero? What compelled Akraiphia to display the symbolic expression of her intimate bond with the hero Ptoios in such a conspicuous manner? Guillon stressed the traditional character of the tripod, but this alone cannot explain the institutionalization of the tripod monuments and their unusual arrangement at the sanctuary of the hero.51 In order to understand the votive custom at Akraiphia, a comparison with other instances of collective dedications of tripods in Boiotia may prove useful. The Tripodephoria of the Thebageneis The tripodephoria of the Thebageneis affords one example of the political significance of collective dedications in Boiotia. Our knowledge of this dedicatory rite derives mainly from the ancient scholiasts of the first paian of Pindar.52 The main theme of the paian must have been the mythologi- cal aition for the rite.53 Pindar composed the Tpuio8r|&lt;popiK6v ueA,o&lt;; for 49.

The ancient sources do not contain any indications regarding the date of the annexa- tion of the Thebageneis, but the fact that the theme was treated by Pindar suggests that the tripodephoria was already an established institution in his lifetime, perhaps as early as the 6th century B.C.56 The ceremonial transference of a tripod by the Thebageneis from the annexed territory to Thebes was a clear and public manifestation of their dependent status.57 It celebrated the recurrently renewed ties between the subdued and Apollo, the patron god of Thebes, of whom the tripod was the most appropriate attribute. The communicational efficacy of this rite for both performers and their audiences was based upon a semantically important aspect of the tripod in early Greek thought: its symbolic func- tion as a token of territorial sovereignty.58 This function is latent in the myth of the famous struggle for the Delphic tripod between Apollo and Herakles, which became popular in representational arts from the second quarter of the 6th century onward.59 The tripod also plays a crucial role in numerous ancient traditions in which a well-hidden example guarantees the sovereignty of a group of people over their territory, on the condition that the secret of its location within this territory is closely guarded. Herodotos (4.179) offers a good example in his account of the Argonauts' voyage in Libya, on the occasion when they exchange a tripod for navigational information from Triton, a local daimon. Triton prophesies that "if a descendant of those belonging to the crew of Argo steals the tripod, the foundation of a hundred cities around Lake Tritonis will be unavoidable." Herodotos concludes the story by saying that when the local inhabitants heard the prophecy, they imme- diately hid the tripod to block the migratory movement and ensure their exclusive rights to the land. The territorial significance of the tripod is evident in a similar account by Apollonios of Rhodes in the Argonautica (4.1537-1591). In this case, the tripod was exchanged for a clod of earth, which was later miraculously transformed into an entire island (Arg. 4.1756-1758). The territorial sig- nificance of the tripod was also associated with the foundation myths of certain ancient Greek cities, such as the little town of Tripodiskos near 54.

Vian (1963, p. 197, n. 3) questions the valid- ity of Ephoros's testimony, proposing instead that it was Ephoros s "transcrip- tion historicisee" of the myth of Lykos and Nykteos. In Theban propaganda, the origins and ethnic constitution of the Thebageneis fluctuated in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., reflecting the political interests of Thebes as leader of Boiotia. The same holds true for claims regarding the Theban attitude toward these marginal populations. See Vian 1963, p. 161; Sordi 1966, pp. 18- 21. 57. Schachter (1981, p. 83) con- jectures that the tripodephoria of the Thebageneis "may have been a regular ritual performed in recognition of the hegemony of Thebes." 58.

In view of these examples, it is clear that the tri- podephoria of the Thebageneis to the sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios served to dramatize the political surrender of the Thebageneis to the authority ofThebes. The Tripodephoria to Dodona The tripodephoria from Thebes to the sanctuary of Zeus at Dodona may have been initiated in the context of similar political considerations.60 The aition of this rite is associated with the Theban war against the Pelasgians, who inhabited the area of Panakton at the mountainous borderland be- tween Attica and Boiotia.61 According to this story, the Thebans consulted the Pelasgian sanctuary of Hepeiros for a method that would result in the successful subjugation of the Pelasgians. The oracular response implied that the Thebans would succeed if they committed an impious act. They did so by murdering the priestess at Dodona. Later, it turned out that the unclear oracle meant that the Thebans were to steal a tripod from a Theban sanctuary after dark and transfer it to Dodona. The Thebans per- formed the rite and institutionalized it after successfully subjugating the Pelasgians. The pattern of this story is the inverse of the tripodephoria of the Thebageneis, as the tripod was taken away from Boiotia. Nevertheless, the tradition exemplifies the stealthy removal of a tripod from a Boiotian sanc- tuary, an act performed as a ritualized sacrilege.62 In light of my analysis of the tripodephoria of the Thebageneis, it would seem that in this case Thebes ritually acknowledged its deference to the revered sanctuary of Dodona through the maintenance of material and symbolic ties with it. I would argue that the underlying motivation for the tripodephoria to Dodona is to be found in the Theban claims over the marginal land of the Pelasgians. This land was often a cause of dispute between Thebes and Athens in the Archaic and Classical periods, and several legendary traditions were devised by both contenders to legitimize their claims.63 The transference of a tripod to the Pelasgian Zeus of Dodona (//. 16.233) was intended to establish a special link between Thebes and Dodona and to ground the Theban claims over the land of the Pelasgians in myth and ritual. In other words, at Dodona the Thebans exchanged the material and symbolic value of a tripod for the divinely sanctioned right to expand their dominion over Pelasgian territory. The dedication of a tripod to Dodona by the Thebans was a symbolic actualization of the surrender of Theban authority to the supreme juris- diction of the Pelasgian Zeus of Dodona. Moreover, given the territorial significance of the tripod, we may also see the tripodephoria to Dodona as a ritual that expanded the limits ofThebes all the way to Pelasgian Dodona and vice versa. The notional thread that connected Thebes and Dodona (and, by extension, both of these sites with Panakton) was realized as a pragmatic one in the path of the procession to Dodona. The tripod was removed from Thebes under circumstances (iepocoXia) that rendered it a talisman or a token of the city's territorial unassailability. 60. Schachter 1994a, pp. 154-155. 61.

He based his argument on the fact that both rites were related to events that took place in the borderland between Boiotia and Attica. 62.

I now return to Akraiphia to consider the possibility that the dedication of tripods at the sanctuary of the hero may have resembled other Boiotian dedicatory rites in its symbolic function. Were these tripods intended to affirm, as Guillon has suggested, the sovereignty of the Akraiphian polis over its territory? Guillon stressed the topographical importance of the site of Kastraki, which occupies a visible location near the path leading from Thebes to the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoon. Imposing and firmly anchored in the holy ground of the sanctuary of Ptoios, the tripods must have conveyed a strong, nonverbal message to visitors from Thebes and other locations.64 In view of the significance of the tripodephoria of the Thebageneis and Dodona, the tripods at Kastraki may be regarded as visible tokens of the Akraiphians' concerted efforts to unite themselves under the patronage of the local hero. It might be speculated that the erection of each of the tripods as a component of the spatial symbolism at Kastraki involved the performance of a local tripodephoria. I propose that this ritual event actualized the Akraiphians' consensual surrender to the hero and affirmed the pragmatic and conceptual links between the civic center of Akraiphia and the sanctuary at Kastraki, along with its surrounding landscape. This rite and the monumental commemoration of its performance would have played a crucial role in the formation and consolidation of Akraiphia's collective identity. Public processions, sacrifices, and civic festivals were instrumental in the periodic reaffirmation of the existing social order within the Greek polis.65 In their format, costliness, and spatial arrangement, the tripods at Kastraki would have provided an im- posing backdrop against which these civic rituals were performed. They not only lined the sides of the road from Akraiphia to the sanctuary, but they were similarly arranged within the lower terrace of the sanctuary, where communal rites such as sacrifices, ceremonial meals, and dances are archaeologically attested.66 The proliferation of tripods at Kastraki during the second half of the 6th century coincides with the gestation period of the Boiotian League under the domineering leadership of Thebes.67 It is possible that through the conspicuous display of solidarity around a local hero, the Akraiphians asserted their autonomy to Thebes, along with their ability and determina- tion to avoid the fate of the Thebageneis in the south.68 This was a strategy of nonverbal bragging, effected by emulating the illustrious ambience of Theban sanctuaries laden with venerable relics such as the heroic tripods of Amphitryon, Laodamas, and Skaios. Furthermore, no visitor from Boiotia or elsewhere could ever observe the tripods of Ptoios without recalling the power of Hesiod s tripod, epitomizing the foundation rite of the famous Helikonian sanctuary. The multiple usage of tripods in Boiotian sanctuar- ies and rites constituted a local ecology of sacredness that conditioned the reception of Ptoios s tripods in terms of both Boiotian values and panhel- lenic meanings. 64.

Inscribed cylindrical base of a dedicatory tripod formerly in the courtyard of the church of the Virgin of Skripou in Orchomenos. Photo N. Papalexandrou It was precisely this local ecology that ensured the survival (or revival) of the tripod as an expressive medium in the Hellenistic period. An epigram in hexameters wrought with epic allusions preserves the kleos of the Thespian participants in the expedition of Alexander in Asia.69 Assuming the voice of the entire community of Thespiae, the epigram exalts the distinguished Thespians who celebrated their victory over the barbarians by dedicating an elaborate and costly (8cti8dtaov) tripod to Zeus at Thespiae. In doing so, they acted on behalf of all Thespians, who were thus redeemed for the sufferings of their heroic ancestors during the Persian wars {Anth. Pal. 6.344, line 2: xificopoix; rcpoyovcov). Inscribed on the base of the collective dedication of the Thespians, this epigram was a poetic appendage to the Thespian symbol of victory. During the 3rd century B.C., the tripod was used for the monumental proclamation of the political and spiritual authority claimed by the Boiotian Confederacy. This use is attested by epigraphic evidence for the dedication of 12 tripods by the koinon of Boiotians to various divinities.70 Seven of these dedications came from the sanctuary of Apollo at Ptoon, the official oracle of the Confederacy during this period.71 Three tripods were dedi- cated to Zeus Eleutherios at Plataia, one to the Graces at Orchomenos (Fig. 12), and one to the Muses at Thespiae.72 The dedicatory inscriptions do not mention the specific circumstances that led to the erection of these monuments. They indicate, however, that the dedications were instigated by oracles issued by Apollo Ptoios. Guillon has suggested that these oracles sanctioned the resuscitated agonistic movement in places like Orchomenos, Plataiai, and Thespiae, and placed it under the auspices of the Boiotian Confederacy.73 According to this reasoning, the Confederacy checked the growth of local particularism 69.

Such a strategy would be appropriate in communities like Orchomenos, where the tripod was no less a symbol of personal victory and status than a token of the city's affluence and power. The massive, cylindrical base of the tripod at Orchomenos (Fig. 12) indi- cates that the tripod it supported was a sizable object, one that was intended to convey a powerful message.74 Conspicuously erected in the sanctuary of the Graces, in close proximity to the civic center of Orchomenos, this monument was an eloquent reminder of the power and authority exercised by the Boiotian Confederacy. TRIPODS OF THE SANCTUARY AT KASTRAKI I sketched above two basic patterns of tripod dedication in Boiotia. In some cases, tripods were set up by individuals as markers of prestige and political power. In other cases, tripods were erected by entire communities or collective bodies seeking to affirm their sovereign status in religious contexts. Both practices had a long life in Boiotia, although the reasons for this tenacity are not entirely clear. The panhellenic communicational power of the tripod and the con- servative character of religious practices in ancient Boiotia may have con- tributed equally to the shaping of these dedicatory customs. As a symbol of victory in poetic and other contests, as a symbol of political authority or civic status, as an attribute of Apollo, or as a symbol laden with territorial connotations, the Boiotian tripod could accommodate many messages. These might be appropriate for heroes (Amphitryon, Herakles, Ptoios), Olympian gods (Apollo, Zeus, Athena, Dionysos), and common mortals.75 The traditional, panhellenic referentiality of tripods in epic sources and in the great sanctuaries largely accounted for the multivocality of the Boiotian tripods as well. The particular semantic nuance of an individual tripod was ultimately generated in each tripod s physical or conceptual context. The physical con- text is now lost in most locations from which remnants of tripods have been archaeologically retrieved. Nevertheless, it is likely that the exact placement of each tripod within a sacred space was the result of careful planning and calculation. Religious authorities and dedicants were aware that the format of the tripods was a means of shaping sacredness.The physical presence and position of these symbols must have radiated a wealth of emotions no less intense than those generated today by the sign of the cross for Christians or the menorah for Jews. Moreover, each tripod fulfilled its role as a monu- ment in concert with, or in opposition to, other monuments, buildings, or landmarks - elements of both its immediate context and of more distant locations. Unfortunately, the semantic charge that was generated by these contextual associations and their details is now largely lost. The ceremonial alignments of tripods at Kastraki suggest that the tripods served as markers of performative space, significant backdrops against which a community acted out its proud sense of identity to itself, its patron hero, and others. Similarly, the sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios 74. On cylindrical and triangular bases, see Guillon 1943b, p. 28. 75. There are allusions to the di- vinatory function of tripods in the fragments of the Boiotian poet Co- rinna, preserved in the Berlin papyrus, P. Berol. 284. See Page (1953, fr. 1, col. Ill, lines 25-26) for the mantic role of the male descendants of the river Asopos; also lines 33-34, where Apollo is reported to have given Euo/nymos, a son of the Boiotian river Kephissos, tripods for issuing oracles.</page><page sequence="22">272 NASSOS PAPALEXANDROU was home to several tripods whose very presence there presupposes the collective rite of the tripodephoriay a pompous procession that made the tripod a spectacle to remember and celebrate with song and possibly with dance.76 An equally spectacular tripodephoria forged special ties between Thebes and the sanctuary of Zeus at Dodona. In the context of these Boiotian practices, it is possible that each tripod at Kastraki was meant to signify a local tripodephoria, a public procession performed by the civic body of Akraiphia from the civic center to the sanctuary of Ptoios. This rite would have established a renewable and recurrent contract between the entire community and the local hero. Its performance would have been a unique event that was recorded both in collective memory and in the votive inscriptions on the central columns of the tripods. A good example of an inscription survives in the best-preserved sup- port at Kastraki, a fluted column 1.74 m tall, with a base diameter of 0.35 m (Fig. 13). The text runs from top to bottom along the length of a flute: Siuovi8oc ap%ovxo&lt;; toi Mpoi xoi ITcoioi AKpupieq ocveGeav. The Akraiphians dedicated [the tripod] to the hero Ptoios in the archonship of Simonidas.77 The text of this dedicatory inscription identifies the authors of the dedi- cation and places their votive gesture in historical time. Its format and placement on the shaft of a centrally situated support epitomized the act of the dedication itself. It was as if the column (and by extension the entire monument) verbally incorporated the entire community of AJaraiphians.78 The static monument of a tripod thus became more than a lavish and pres- tigious memorial; it served as the perpetual embodiment of its performers and the reenactment of the original dedicatory rite. Through the calculated, meaningful combination of the base, inscribed central column, and tripod cauldron, the monument became an image of an actual tripodephoria. The significance of the various correspondences would have been meaningful to individuals emotionally and psychologically conditioned for this type of encounter. At the outset, they would note that each tripod monument was firmly anchored in the ground by means of a very low rect- angular base (Figs. 6-8, above).79 This was significant because the closeness to the ground would have visibly evoked the theme of territoriality. In the middle, the columnar support (Fig. 13) physically supported the cauldron Figure 13. Central column of tripod monument at the sanctuary of Ptoios, Kastraki. Guillon 1943a, pl. XV:1 76. Tripods as epicenters of choral events are discussed in Papalexandrou 2005, pp. 189-216. 77. Guillon (1943a, pp. 48-49, no. 7, 54; 1943b, p. 67) dates the text to the middle of the 6th century B.C. Jeffery (1990, p. 93), however, strongly argues for a dating in the last decade of the 6th century B.C. 78. A well-known parallel is the Pla- taian tripod at Delphi. Its support fea- tured a serpentine body inscribed with the names of the Greeks who contrib- uted to the victory against the Persians. See Jacquemin 1999, pp. 176, 336; also Steinhart 1997. 79. The height of the rectangular bases, most of which were carved in local tufa stone, varied from 0.10 to 0.20 m. A considerable portion of each base was set below the surface of the ground, as, for example, in the bases with sides that featured anathyrosis "sur 0.05 a partir du bord superieur"; Guillon 1943a, p. 33, nos. 6-8 (north alignment), and p. 36, no. 13 (south alignment); see also Guillon 1943b, p. 26. Thus, the refined side of the base that was intended to be above ground was emphasized and set apart from the lower, invisible part with a rough sur- face. All tripods at Kastraki seem to have conformed to this principle. This aspect of these monuments would not have escaped the Akraiphians' atten- tion. Connection to the land was an essential dimension of group identity, both in Boiotia, where the Akraiphians had to deal with assertions of an emi- nent Theban past (Vian 1963; Sordi 1966), and elsewhere (see, e.g., Loraux 1993).</page><page sequence="23">BOIOTIAN TRIPODS 273 of the tripod above, but at the same time it stood for the collective spirit of the dedicants. Both literally and metaphorically, (pepei xov Tp{rco8a was the overarching theme that made each tripod the mediatory site between the people and the hero, the people and their land, the hero and their land, and the people and their past.80 Finally, the bronze cauldron on top gave value, form, temporal fixity, and substance to the monument as a whole and to the rite that the monument embodied. These attributes, in conjunction with the panhellenic and regional values of the tripod, would have informed the local significance of this powerful symbol. While the vertical axis of the tripod monuments at Kastraki corre- sponded to a vertical order of significances, the carefully calculated place- ment of each of these tripods along a horizontal sequence shaped their performative space. Two alignments of rectangular or square tripod bases were found in situ at the site (Figs. 4, 6-8, above). It is significant that the tripods supported by these bases framed the sides of the main route from Akraiphia to the lower terrace of the sanctuary.81 The so-called north alignment, comprising the bases for nine tripods, was documented for a distance of 20 m west of the entrance to the lower terrace of the sanctuary (Fig. 6; for reconstruction of eight of the nine tripods, see Figs. 14, 15, and Appendix). The south alignment ran parallel to the north at a distance of 6 m and was documented, with lacunae, for a distance of 125 m. At the southwest corner of the lower terrace of the sanctuary, this alignment turned to the south at a right angle. Here the bases lined the path that led up to the terrace of the temple and were documented for a distance of ca. 10 m (Figs. 8, 9, above).82 The south alignment comprised the bases of another 19 tripods altogether. Given the ruinous state of preservation of these composite monuments (the tripods have disappeared, while most of the columns were displaced 80. Practical, structural, or economic considerations alone (see, e.g., Cha- moux 1970, pp. 323-326) are not suffi- cient to explain the specific articulation of the monuments at Kastraki. By the time of the erection of the columns, the metaphoric association between the column and the human body was an established means for conceptualizing fundamental values of both. Onians (1995, pp. 34-35) emphasizes the Greeks' thinking of the warrior's body in terms of the vigor and strength of the column. Rykwert (1996, pp. 177- 178) discusses Greek architectural ter- minology in terms of its explicit cor- poreal associations. The anthropomor- phic substitutes of columns in monu- ments like the Treasury of the Siph- nians at Delphi or the Temple of Zeus at Akragas are understandable as archi- tectural elements precisely in terms of this metaphoric association. Based on this way of thinking, Pindar refers to Hector as "Troy's invincible steadfast column" (01. 2.81); Troy is thus concep- tualized as an architectural structure. 81. See detailed discussion in Guil- lon 1943a, pp. 28-43; 1943b, pp. 57-62. There is hardly any evidence left in place at the sanctuary, where almost all the bases have disappeared (personal observations, July 13, 2005, and June 22, 2006). I saw only half of the tripod base brought to light by Ducat and Llinas (Ducat and Llinas 1964, pp. 855-856, fig. 7); see Fig. 10, above. The destruction (deliberate or acci- dental) of these valuable monuments must have reached a considerable degree by the time Ducat and Llinas undertook systematic investigations at the sanctuary. See Ducat and Llinas 1964, p. 851, n. 4: "Au cours des ans les constructions de la Terrasse inferieure, autels, 'Heroon,' 'Edifice A' et bases de trepieds ont ete abondament pillees: 1' 'alignement des bases du sud' et une partie des pierres de 1' 'alignement Nord' ont disparu." 82. Guillon's discoveries were cor- roborated by Ducat and Llinas (1964, 1965), who found one more rectangular base of a tripod on the axis of a line of worked blocks running southeast- northwest to the east of the south branch of Guillon's south alignment. This led Ducat and Llinas (1964, p. 856, figs. 4, 7-9) to interpret these stones as belonging to tripod bases as well. If they are correct, the path lead- ing to the terrace of the temple was lined on both sides with tripods, and the awkward orientation of this align- ment might have been dictated by the morphology of the ground. Ducat and Llinas (1964, pp. 856, 858, fig. 11) also discovered the fragment of another tri- pod base 200 m west of the sanctuary and close to the path leading from Akraiphia to Kastraki.</page><page sequence="24">274 NASSOS PAPALEXANDROU Figure 14.

Nevertheless, the linearity of this design must have existed from the begin- ning, and it was apparently respected, maintained, and reinforced with the passage of time.83 The alignment of tripods monumentalized the approach to the sanctuary by emphasizing the pragmatic and notional axis between the sanctuary and the city of Akraiphia (Figs. 14, 15). In making their way to the sanctuary, visitors or participants in processions would have moved along this axis.84 In doing so, they would have encountered each individual tripod in the context of all the other tripods that visually manifested the cultic history of the site and the worshipping community of Akraiphia. In these experiential circumstances, each tripod was perceived as a link in a continuum of ritual practice that was infinitely expandable in space and time. The directional force created by the arrangement of tripods on either side of this "voie des trepieds" must have governed the mood and movement of isolated visitors or participants in formal processions.85 It is possible that each tripod was a station for a pause allowing the enactment of a memorial gesture linked with the reading of the dedicatory inscription.86 Moreover, at the southwest corner of the lower terrace - the spatial focus of the cultic events in honor of the hero - the tripods at the east end of the east-west branch of the south alignment and those that lined the path to the upper terrace (Figs. 8, 9, above) formed a backdrop for an area where there is evidence for the performance of sacrifices, meals, and other ritual events. These dromena were as significant for the cultic life of the Akraiphian community as the tripodephoriai that were perpetually reenacted in the two tripod alignments.87 This congruence of actual and symbolic enactments of rituals must have intensified the sacred ambience of the site.88 Finally, in the midst of their surrounding landscape, the size, material, and architectural impact of the tripods must have rendered them formidable landmarks. The prevailing east-west axis of their arrangement visually punctuated the connection between the sanctuary and the astu of Akraiphia. This effect can only be imagined today but it must have been a striking one, especially if we consider it from the vantage point of a higher altitude, as found at Perdikovrysi or along the paths leading there from Thebes or elsewhere (Fig. 16). If the splendid rock that hangs over the sanctuary of Perdikovrysi was the unmistakable physical attribute of Apollo Ptoios, the tripods of the hero came to form, ca. 530-450 B.C., commensurable cultural attributes of the sanctuary. 83. Guillon 1943b, p. 59. As Jones (2002) has shown (based mostly on representations of tripods in the figura- tive arts), the paratactic arrangement of monumental tripod cauldrons seems to have been practiced as early as the 8th century B.C. 84. On processions and their signifi- cance in the social life of communities and the delimitation of their physical and conceptual surroundings, see Connor 1987; Polignac 1995; Graf 1996. 85. Guillon 1943b, p. 57. 86. Xenophon's recommendations (Eg. Mag. 3.2) for the enactment of processions and dances in Athens during the Dionysia and other festivals allow us to speculate on the nature of staged events that people experienced at the sanctuary at Kastraki. 87. Ducat and Llinas 1964; Ekroth 1998, pp. 122-123, 128. Guillon calculated that the largest tripods of both alignments were nos. 13, 14, and 15, i.e., the easternmost tripods of the south alignment (Figs. 8, 9). Tripod 15, the largest (overall height close to 3 m; Guillon 1943b, p. 54, table III), was set up at the spot where the south align- ment turns south and forms the most prominent and imposing backdrop of the performative space of the lower ter- race.

Photo taken from the modern road leading from Akraiphia to the sanctuary of Apollo at Per- dikovrysi. Photo N. Papalexandrou Unfortunately, it is impossible to reconstruct the spatial arrangement of tripods in other contexts, such as at Orchomenos or Thebes. One wonders whether the many tripods at Orchomenos were set up to create a mean- ingful paratactic sequence, as was the case at Akraiphia. The Street of the Tripods and numerous other monuments in Athens would have served as even grander examples to follow, at least in terms of urban planning and monumental effects.89 Although the ambience of the Theban sanctuaries is now completely lost, we may presume that here, too, each venerable relic was positioned with careful planning and systematic curatorship.90 CONCLUDING COMMENTS The history of Boiotian tripods is only one chapter of a much larger history of religious symbols and practices that varied from one regional culture of Greece to another. Tucked as it was between Attica and Phokis - both regions with older and distinctive uses of tripods - Boiotia invested the panhellenic tripod with meanings deriving from local social and historical circumstances. 89. On the Street of the Tripods, see Choremi-Spetsieri 1994. See also Mat- thaiou 1994, pp. 183-188, for the dis- cussion and reconstruction of a choregic monument that featured a parataxis of three monumental tripods celebrating victories in dithyrambic contests at the City Dionysia. The effect of the arrangement of tripods along the Street of the Tripods is exemplified today by the Lysikrates monument; Camp 2001, pp. 147-148; Alemdar 2000. See also Amandry 1976 and 1977 for the pub- lication of numerous tripod bases from Athens (5th and 4th centuries B.C.). The absence of discussion of their ori- ginal arrangement in spatial context is largely owing to the displacement or reuse of the surviving bases of the tri- pod monuments. The same holds true at Delos; Amandry and Ducat 1973. 90. Guillon (1943b, pp. 57-62) discusses in detail various pieces of evi- dence regarding monumental suntag- mata of tripods in ancient Greece. See in particular his mention of Momm- sen's hypothesis that the tripods at the Hismenion were set up "le long d'une voie unissant l'Herakleion et l'lsme- nion" (Guillon 1943b, p. 58, n. 3).</page><page sequence="27">BOIOTIAN TRIPODS 277 Boiotia is probably the only region in the Greek world that offers an abundance of material, epigraphic, and literary evidence for reconstructing the dedicatory uses and meanings of tripods in their social contexts and physical settings. I have attempted to elucidate the Boiotian life of tripods in diachronic perspective by synthesizing this evidence, emphasizing the significance of individual and collective dedications in public settings. In the distinctly Boiotian rite of the tripodephoriay the ritual usage of the tripods constituted the symbolic actualization of power relations between the dominant center and its periphery. At the Akraiphian sanctuary of Ptoios at Kastraki, it is possible to reconstruct both the physical ambience of the sanctuary and the collective rites associated with the dedications. The corporate nature of the offering community of Akraiphia is reflected in the physical appearance of the tripod dedications at Kastraki. The tripod cauldrons were meant to shape the space around them, functioning as three-dimensional entities, precisely like statuary or architecture. Just as the aural, chromatic, and reflective properties of the sanctuary affected the senses and minds of the worship- pers, the architectural quality of the monumental tripods also influenced the experience of cult practice at Kastraki.</page><page sequence="28">APPENDIX RECONSTRUCTING THE TRIPOD ALIGNMENTS The reconstructions of the tripod alignments shown in Figures 14 and 15 are based on Guillons precisely documented measurements, his careful considerations, and his own reconstruction of an average-sized tripod, re- produced here in Figure II.91 Guillon devised two alternative formulas to estimate the size, proportions, and overall format of the tripods at Kastraki.92 He based his reconstruction of proportions on representations of tripods on vases and other media of the late 6th and early 5th centuries B.C.93 He estimated an approximate proportion of the height of a tripod (tripod base not included) to width (understood as the diameter of the cauldron at the rim): H = 4R. In this equation, H = the height of the tripod cauldron, and R = the radius of the circular cauldron, measured on the base as the distance between the center of the central column and the inner face of the leg. The only direct, physical evidence that Guillon had at his disposal for estimating the height of the tripod cauldrons came from three completely preserved central columns found at Kastraki. These three columns featured a standard ratio of H = 5D (H = height of tripod column, and D = lower diameter of column). Guillon found that his calculations of the height of the tripods on the basis of the 4R ratio were, in almost all cases, incompat- ible with those calculated on the basis of the H = 5D ratio, estimated from the preserved columnar supports. The difficulties of this reconstructive exercise are exemplified by the case of the north alignment, in which the tripod monuments were gener- ally smaller than those of the more grandiose south alignment. Guillon concluded that an estimation of the height of the tripods on the basis of the H = 4R ratio would result in squat monuments with disproportion- ately thick central columns. The application of the H = 5D ratio (with the necessary adjustments), however, resulted in a disproportionately high or attenuated tripod. To solve this problem, Guillon proposed that the ideal congruence of both H = 4R and H = 5D would be possible if the tripod cauldrons of the north alignment had legs that inclined inward. Thus, the cauldron would have been much wider than the estimation made on the basis of the radius measured on the base.94 Following a similar reasoning, he suggested that the tripods of the south alignment, all of which featured slimmer, more 91.

In general, he concluded that all tripods presented an evolutionary tendency toward balanced, light proportions and format, exemplified by the tripod he reconstructed graphically.95 He emphasized, however, that in general the type of tripods attested at Kastraki remained throughout "assez peu varie: la regularite y frappe, plus que la diversite."96 In the graphic reconstructions of the north alignment presented above (Figs. 14, 15), I have not followed Guillon s reconstruction (Fig. 11) in every detail. Contrary to his suggestions, the tripods have straight legs, precisely like the tripods represented on vases of the 6th and 5 th centuries B.C. Moreover, they appear somewhat squatter than those envisaged by Guillon. Given the current state of the evidence, it is impossible to propose an accurate reconstruction of each tripod. I have attempted instead to offer an approximation of what these monuments might have looked like when they stood as an integrated group in the sanctuary of Ptoios. 95.
