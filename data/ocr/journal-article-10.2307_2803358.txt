<plain_text><page sequence="1">TAMING THE ASCETIC: DEVOTIONALISM IN A HINDU MONASTIC ORDER PETER VAN DER VEER University of Utrecht Anthropologists and historians working on Hinduism often assume that devotionalism implies a religious rejection of social inequality as found in the caste system. This assumption arises from an essentialist interpretation of the 'real' theological and sociological meaning of bhakti. This article tries to show that bhakti as a religious experience can only be understood in the context of practices which are conditioned by religious organisation. In the case of the Ramanandis of north India there is a clear difference between ascetic and devotional styles which are related to different types of organisation. The devotional worship of images requires an emphasis on caste distinc- tions, while the peripatetic style of asceticism tends to minimise these distinctions. Historically, there has been an expansion of devotionalism, while 'wild' asceticism has been on the decline. Both processes have led to a greater importance of caste within the Ramanandi order. Introduction The Ramanandis of north India are commonly described as a Vaishnavite devotional (bhakti) sect. They are in their own perception Ram-bhaktas, devotees of the Hindu god Ram whom outsiders regard as an incarnation of Vishnu, but who is in the Ramanandi theology presented as the supreme god in his own right. My experience with the Ramanandis is based on fieldwork in Ayodhya, one of the most important pilgrimage centres of Uttar Pradesh. The Ramanan- dis have settled in Ayodhya increasingly from the beginning of the eighteenth century onwards and form at present the majority of Ayodhya's population.1 Ayodhya is one of the largest Ramanandi centres in north India for the obvious reason that it is the birthplace of Lord Ram. Hindu devotional movements or bhakti sects have been given considerable attention by historians of religion as well as anthropologists (e.g. Singer I966; Lele I980). The common assumption of most anthropologists and historians is that these sects have emerged as a religious rejection of the Brahm'anical value system. Emphasis is given to a structural opposition between the egalitarian values of the bhakti sects and the hierarchical ones of the caste system which is assumed to be underpinned by Brahmanical ideology. Striking also is the theological essentialism in much of the discussion of the social implications of bhakti. The Ramanandis may indeed be Ram-bhaktas, but to describe them as a 'bhakti sect' hinders the correct interpretation of the present nature of this group and its internal divisions, as well of its evolution over time. The case of the Ramanandis demonstrates that bhakti has a variety of meanings in different Man (N.S.) 22, 680-695</page><page sequence="2">PETER VAN DER VEER 68I contexts. Moreover, it shows that there is a relation between religious organis- ation and religious styles which has to be determined before one can even try to answer the question of the social implications of bhakti. Before I turn to that case I will briefly review the main arguments on the social and theological nature of bhakti and its relation to social change. Bhakti sects are often described as religious movements, especially developed and eminently suited for practice by the lower classes, namely Shudras and women: those who are not entitled to read the Vedas or to understand Brahmanical philosophy (Singer I972: 225). Moreover, these sects tend to be seen as signifying the assertion of emotion over intellect-a point of view probably arising from academic opinions about both women and the lower classes. Historically, the break with orthodox rituals and the social restrictions on participation in them, as well as the establishment of image worship and temple ceremonies, are understood to have opened bhakti religion to the lower classes in practice as well as in theory (Hopkins I966: 2I). In their endeavour to understand the social implications of bhakti movements, anthropologists have tended to make a distinction between the egalitarian message of these movements and their acceptance of inequality in secular contexts. According to Ishwaran (I980: 74) they served as a 'safety-valve' and were essentially geared not to eliminating the Hindu Brahmanical system but to making it more workable and acceptable to the discontented masses'. He argues that 'there is a selfcontradiction built in bhakti movements between conscious- ness and existence' (i980: 82). Holmstrom (I970) has developed an argument which is in some respects similar. He argues that one can only understand existing Hindu societies and Hindu history by following the interplay of two radically different kinds of religion, associated with two kinds of morality and of social relations: 'On the one hand, a religion which consecrates the existing social order, values of submission and hierarchy, and a relativist morality of closed groups; on the other, devotional religion, values of choice and equality, and a tendency towards a universalist "open" morality in Bergson's sense' (I970: 28). Holmstrom makes a distinction between traditional and modern bhakti. Traditional bhakti tends to distinguish religious values from social values. It recognises caste values while relegating them to a lower plane in the hierarchy of values. Modern bhakti, which Holmstr6m finds in the industrialising cities of south India, tends to equate religious and moral universalism. In a well-known essay on the devotional Radha-Krishna bhajans in Mylapore (Madras), Singer (I972: I99-245) also relates devotion and modernisation. In his interpretation these devotional groups provide forms of sociability and intimacy that trans- cend kin, caste, sect and region. They reduce the consciousness of these differences and the tensions generated by it. Finally, Pocock (I973: I52) argues in his study of the Patidar, a landowning caste in Gujarat, that Vaishnavite bhakti introduced into north India a doctrine which ran counter to older beliefs underlying the symbiotic relation of pure and impure. His general observation about the Satsang of Swami Narayan is that though this bhakti sect does not oppose caste values, it tends to reduce their importance in the eyes of its followers (I 973: I 53).</page><page sequence="3">682 PETER VAN DER VEER The findings of both historians of religion, working on historical bhakti movements, and anthropologists, working on modern bhakti movements, seem to bear out the same set of interpretations. Hindu devotional groups tend to have egalitarian values and ideas in the religious sphere of action. Their ritual practices are open to all, irrespective of their birth and status. Their influence on society at large, however, is in the traditional situation of the caste system negligible, while in the case of modern bhakti it depends to a great extent on a historical transformation of that society whether the latent potentiality for moral universalism will be realised, as in the case of Holmstr6m's industrial city of south India. It thus seems that bhakti can, in one way or another, very easily be associated with egalitarian values which run counter to the values of the caste system. Literally, the Sanskrit term means 'participation' (in the Godhead, Bhagavan). But in practice it is used in a great variety of contexts with very different meanings from, say, the Bhagavad Gita onwards2. Its meaning and social significance can therefore not be divorced from the contexts in which it is operative (cf. Obeyesekere I98 I: 20). It is quite meaningless to argue in a general way that 'anti-Brahmanism' or 'anti-casteism' forms the sociological essence of a Hindu religious phenomenon which is called bhakti. In some contexts it might have such aspects, but in many others it will not. At least in some historical situations bhakti could rather be seen as an 'invention of the renouncer', as Dumont (I970: 55) puts it. Such an interpretation, however, critically depends on how one understands Hindu renunciation. Burghart (I983: 636) rightly criticises Dumont for looking at the institution of renunciation only from the perspective of the Brahman householder. Both renunciation and Brahmanism are in fact Dumont's ideal-typical constructions and from their dialectical interplay emerges a third ideal type: the bhakti sect. Understanding a bhakti group, historically and sociologically, depends rather on an interpretation of the differences and debates between those primarily involved. We have to find what these 'intersectarian' and 'intrasectarian' differences are and how they have changed over time (cf. Burghart I983). A problem with much of the literature on bhakti, referred to above, is that it is often not very specific about the social groups it empirically pertains to, but remains on a global, theological level. Since the main division in religious organisation is that between specialists and laity, we have to decide whether we want to write about the implications of bhakti for the Ramanandi sadhus or for the Ramanandi laity. For reasons which will become clear in the next section this article will limit itself to the specialists. The discussion of the composition of the Ramanandi order will lead to an important problem in the operative context of Ramanandi religious organis- ation and beliefs: the relation between its two major religious styles, asceticism and devotionalism. In asceticism the indigenous term tapas (heat) seems to be the defining concept, while in devotionalism the term ras (religious sentiment) is central. Moreover, there is a historical problem involved here: devotionalism seems in the Ramanandi case to have eclipsed asceticism in the course of the evolution of the Ramanandi order. Immediately connected with that is clearly the question of the social implications of these styles and the historical process affecting them. In this connexion it is important to emphasise that we are not</page><page sequence="4">PETER VAN DER VEER 683 concerned here with a purely theological question, involving essentialist defi- nitions of what asceticism and devotionalism 'really' are in the Hindu context or with the construction of conceptual universes, as Burghart (I983) has done, but rather with the problem of the relation between religious organisation and religious experience. In this article I want to argue that, contrary to what is generally assumed about the social implications of devotionalism, devotional beliefs and practices in the Ramanandi case emphasise caste distinctions. Moreover, a long process of sedentarisation has resulted in the taming of the wild, free-moving ascetic and the success of the temple-dwelling, law-abiding devotee. I want to describe the composition of the Ramanandi order and the long-term historical process which affected it in broad outline, before returning to the question of the social implications of devotionalism within the order. The composition of the Ramanandi order Bhakti groups are commonly referred to as sects (e.g. Dumont I970: I87). The use of the term 'sect' to describe the Ramanandis, however, raises all kinds of theoretical and terminological problems. In the first place it leads one to look for its opposite, the church (cf. McLeod I978: 288). In the Western Christian tradition 'sect' stands for a heterodox group which attempts to break away from the 'church', the institutionalised dominant orthodoxy. The use of the term 'sect' may easily obscure the fact that there is no Hindu church. It is even difficult to speak of Hindu orthodoxy as against Hindu heterodoxy. It seems to me that the church-sect dichotomy which plays such a central role in the sociological analysis of Christianity has been translated into a caste-sect dichotomy in the sociological analysis of Hinduism. For example in the work of Dumont (I966; I970) a dialectical tension between the caste society under the aegis of the Brahman priest and the sects guided by the renouncers is seen as of major importance for understanding historical transformations in Hindu society. This is, however, clearly problematic, since the so-called bhakti sects of Krishnaite persuasion are usually not guided by renouncers, but by Brahman householders who transmit their leadership hereditarily within families which trace their ancestry to the founder of the 'sect'. Secondly, the use of the term sect tends to obfuscate important differences between specialists and lay-followers. In the case of the Ramanandis-and probably this is true for most of the so-called 'sects'-the laity is highly amorphous, since in north India a layman is prone to see himself as following the teachings of a particular guru, rather than as a Vaishnavite or, for that matter, a Ramanandi. This fact emerges clearly, for example, from nineteenth-century census returns, in which the large majority of Hindus did not identify them- selves as belonging to certain 'sectarian' denominations. Those who have a clear-cut primary Ramanandi identity are the religious specialists, the sadhus, who are organised as monks in a monastic order. Instead of using the term 'sect' I would therefore prefer to speak of an order of Ramanandi sadhus. In this way I follow an accepted usage in research on Buddhism. The Buddhist monastic</page><page sequence="5">684 PETER VAN DER VEER order is, supported by a laity which is in Buddhist countries equated with 'society' at large. This has the advantage of bringing our discussion of the relation between social.organisation and religious experience more into focus. The relationship between guru and disciple is the central organisational principle both within the order and between the order and the laity. The Ramanandi sadhus of Ayodhya are visited by pilgrims who seek their advice and who may become initiated as their lay disciples. Any layman may choose any sadhu as his guru, although this choice is in fact constrained by caste, region and language. It is important that for the lay disciples the individual qualities of the guru tend to be of greater importance than the doctrinal orthodoxy of his message. However, though the relationship with laymen will not impinge on his freedom in matters of religious opinion, the fact that sadhus are dependent for their material support on lay disciples is clearly a major force 'from without' in the process of identity formation within the Ramanandi order. Although a sadhu might 'withdraw to the Himalayas' and be lost to Hindu society-which is of course an important theme in Indian asceticism- renunciation as a social institution is dependent on the support of non-experts who live their secular lives in India's towns and villages and give the sadhus part of their surplus, enabling them to follow their religious calling. The renouncing monk in the Buddhist tradition is thus correctly called bhikkhu, 'one who begs'. A sadhu who wants to sustain his way of life has to be successful in attracting the support of laymen. The more lay support he attracts, the more he will also attract sadhu disciples, since he has the means to feed and support them. This may produce an apparent contradiction. A sadhu may become successful in attracting the support of laymen as well as a following of sadhu disciples when he has endured an extreme form of asceticism. The more liberated he is from the restraining societal and physical bodies thanks to his ascetic feats, the more he will be surrounded socially by ascetic and lay followers. According to Carrithers (I979: 294) the interdependence of monks and laymen in the case of the Buddhist sangha leads to the gradual abandonment of ascetic practices and the adoption of lay values, a tendency which he calls 'domestication'. In the case of the Ramanandis I would, however, argue that it is not the mere interdependence of laity and sadhus which leads to domestication of the sadhus, but a fundamental change in the position of sadhus in society, as a result of a larger political and economic transformation of that society. It seems crucial to understand the way ascetic renouncers experience their asceticism and renunciation, if we want to decide whether the interdependence with laymen 'corrupts' their spirituality or not. The guru-disciple relation, which structures the relation between the order and the laity, is also the only permanent organisational principle within the order. The guru initiates the sadhu into the order during a ritual in which, from the theological point of view, the imparting of the meditation formula (mantra) is the major event. Sociologically, however, the most important aspect of the initiation is the fact that the sadhu loses both his secular name and the name of his patrilineal clan (gotra) which are replaced by a religious name and the clan-name of God (achyut-gotra: 'the clan of the One whose seed does not fall'). In this way a spiritual family (parivar) is formed by the disciples of oneguru and kinship-terms</page><page sequence="6">PETER VAN DER VEER 685 such as guru-bhai (co-disciple or 'brother' of one and the same guru) and guru-cacha ('uncle' or co-disciple of one's guru's guru) are used to address the members of such a spiritual family. At this stage the sadhu has left his natural family and caste. Moreover, a distinction has been created between Ramanandi laymen who remain householders, and Ramanandi sadhus. The crucial element here is the emphasis on celibacy (brahmacarya) as part of what is called 'passionlessness' (vairagya). The Ramanandi sadhus are called vairagis, 'those who practise vairagya', but in principle vairagya can also be practised by householders. It is interesting to note that in my interviews with sedentary sadhus and Brahman householders in Ayodhya the term vairagya is used both for the celibate chastity of the sadhu and for chastity within marriage, though it is admitted that this is very difficult for a married man. The sadhu is in that sense only more chaste than the householder and offers him a not altogether unattainable ideal of life. In terms of religious experience it seems to be the amount of devotion which requires renunciation: surrendering oneself entirely to the service of Lord Ram implies renunciation of 'normal' family-life. Renunciation is therefore not considered to be necessary, but only a possible devotional method. This makes many north Indian devotional groups think that vairagya and especially lifelong celibacy (as distinct from celibacy in the last stage of life) are of relatively minor importance. Such a view might also legiti- mise the prominence of householders as religious leaders in these groups. The Ramanandi sadhus, however, are celibate monks and in this way, as in many others, they resemble more the Shaivite ascetic orders than the other Vaishnavite devotional groups. Celibacy creates a social boundary between laymen and sadhus and is clearly one of the major aspects of the organisation of the Ramanandi order as a whole. After the initiation by the mantra-guru, the Ramanandi sadhu can choose a second guru, by whom he is given a secondary initiation in a specific religious practice or method (sadhana) of reaching god. By choosing a specific set of religious methods one becomes, of course, constrained to follow the traditions pertaining to them. The sadhu who takes a secondary initiation may, after his instruction, return to his 'primary' spiritual family or remain with the family founded by his 'guru of methods' (sadhak-guru) or go round on his own accord. One may argue that while the relation with the supporting laity is a major force 'from without' that encourages sadhus to accept a certain group identity, the guru-disciple relation is a major force 'from within'. This force acts to create what we may call spiritual kin-groups which serve as vehicles for the maintenance of certain religious traditions. Since beliefs are extremely elastic among Ramanandi sadhus, differences between them are either of method, based upon differences in religious methods, or personal, based upon differential success in tapping resources. Often these two types of differences tend to blend, however, since differences in method are used as boundary-maintaining mechanisms in efforts to attract as many followers as possible. The differences between Ramanandi sadhus are often enormous, as we will see later. This can be explained by the fact that the organisation of the order is very loosely structured. There is no central authority which decides upon doctrinal and organisational matters. Every sadhu may go</page><page sequence="7">686 PETER VAN DER VEER and roam throughout India, teaching within certain limits his own religious message; and great value is put on that freedom of the sadhu. Sociologically, this importance of practical and doctrinal freedom makes the order to a considerable extent an 'open social category'. Nevertheless, there is behind this appearance of the sadhu's unlimited freedom and individuality also the reality of a Ramanandi identity which is maintained over a long historical period. Moreover, the differences in religious methods create recognisable divisions within the order. The Ramanandi order is divided into three major groups with their own religious traditions. The first is that of the tyagis who are the real ascetics and whose beliefs and practices centre on a radical type of renunciation (tyag) and on the accumulation of magical heat (tapas). The tyagis tend to lead a peripatetic life. The second is that of the nagas, the fighting ascetics, who are organised in regiments (akhara) and armies (ani). Their beliefs and ritual activities are akin to those of the tyagis, but their life is focused on wrestling and the use of weapons. Their main function is to serve as the military backbone of the Ramanandi order. Finally, the third and last group is that of the rasiks who are the real representa- tives of emotional devotion in the Ramanandi order. In their beliefs and practices Ram's wife Sita is elevated to such an extent that she is equal in status to Ram himself. While tyagis and nagas put great value on radical renunciation and ascetic methods, rasiks rather emphasise devotional surrender and worship. These religious differences should not be interpreted apart from the way these groups are organised and from their historical vicissitudes. A long-term process of sedentarisation and domestication has affected all these groups and has led to settlement in pilgrimage centres such as Ayodhya. Moreover, the devotion of the rasiks has become rather more important than the asceticism of the other groups. Contrary to what one might have expected, these historical tendencies have not resulted in a unification and centralisation of the Ramanandi order. The differences between tyagis and nagas on the one hand and rasiks on the other persist. I will now describe the differences in beliefs and organisation between the three groups of Ramanandi sadhus, before turning to our main problem: the social significance of bhakti in the Ramanandi order. Tyagis and nagas: naked violence Tyag is a Sanskrit word, meaning 'abandoning', somewhat similar to the common word for renunciation, samnyas, which is primarily used in Shaivite circles. It appears to be a rather stronger expression for 'renunciation' than vairagya, the general term used by all Ramanandi sadhus. While, as we have seen, vairagya of sadhus is, theoretically, only a stricter discipline of 'passionlessness' than that followed by lay householders, tyag is of an entirely different order. Tyagis are easily recognisable. They have long matted hair (jata), smeared with ashes (khak) and can be often observed sitting near a fire (dhuni), smoking hashish from clay pipes. A tyagi believes that an ascetic lifestyle, including strict celibacy and an itinerant life, is the best way to realise Ram within himself. Tyagis 'abandon' the comfort of clothing, food, housing and sexual gratification</page><page sequence="8">PETER VAN DER VEER 687 for that ultimate goal. Besides leaving behind.these comforts offered by settled life as a householder, they follow all kinds of ascetic practices which induce certain types of religious experiences and result in the obtaining of magical powers (siddhi). Like the other Ramanandi sadhus, the tyagis are organised in spiritual families, based on the guru-disciple relationship. However, they also have a distinctive organisation of itinerant groups ( jamat and khalsa). The major functions of these groups are to provide mutual protection and support in a hostile environment and to pool resources for giving a feast or building a temple. The differences between these groups are rather unclear. They are often couched in symbolic terms such as 'those who wear only a loincloth of grass or banana' as against 'those who wear a metal or wooden belt'. There is a continuous process of fission and my informants were in general unable to give precise answers to questions about the origin of their group and the reasons for its separation from other groups. To such questions mostly ad-hoc answers were given, such as for example: 'Because they ate rice and we did not'. From my observations, however, it is perfectly clear that when a tyagi is successful in tapping resources, he becomes able to found his own itinerant band and will often do so instead of remaining subservient to the authority of another tyagi. The formation of an itinerant band provides a successful sadhu with a channel for status mobility. Notions of hierarchy and prestige are clearly very important in the life of ascetics. This seems to run counter to what is often assumed to be the goal of asceticism: escape from societal and physical constraints to gain liberation (e. g. Dumont I970: 43). The goal of tyag, however, is rather to gain magical power by accumulating heat (tapas). In one way or another this magical power is also reflected in social power and prestige. Prestige is, however, certainly not only the result of ascetic capacities, but also of more mundane political ones. To become abbot (mahant) or regional overseer (mandaleshvar) one has to be capable of rallying support from other tyagis (cf. Burghart I976). Tyagis do not have a clearly demarcated, coherent system of beliefs. They do have, however, clusters of ascetic practices which define their life-style and which are to some extent theologically underpinned. Theology as such is not highly valued by them, since they do not consider knowledge a desirable asset, but rather have the practical aim of realising Ram through the transformation of body and mind. I will describe the central clusters of ascetic practices to show the way the tyagis proceed to realise Ram. The first cluster is that of fire (dhuni) and ashes (vibhuti, khak). After the primary mantra-initiation to become a Ramanandi, the sadhu has to undergo a secondary intiation, before he can become a tyagi. The guru applies ashes on several parts of the initiate's body and instructs him in the significance of fire and ashes. The fire is the focus of the tyagi's lifestyle. It is simultaneously regarded as the god Fire (Agni) and as the Ultimate Reality (Ram). Every morning a sacred fire is kindled from which ashes are taken. A unity between fire and body is created by smearing ashes over the body. This act is interpreted as symbolising the unity between the individual soul and the ultimate reality. According to my tyagi informants ashes are also symbolic of death: by applying ashes they are constantly reminded of the perishability of the body.</page><page sequence="9">688 PETER VAN DER VEER Tyagis need the sacred fire for most of their ritual activities. It is striking that some of these activities are Brahmanical. Tyagis are famous for staging great quasi-Vedic sacrifices (hawan, yajna), in which Brahman priests often officiate. This makes a ritual and conceptual opposition of Brahmanism and the religion of renouncers, as assumed by Dumont (I970) and Burghart (I983), somewhat problematic. In general, however, one can say that the tyagis make a quite distinctive ritual use of the sacred fire. They kindle fires and sit surrounded by them in the burning sun in order to accumulate tapas which might be best translated by 'magical heat'. Fire creates heat which is full of power and energy. This power (shakti) is dangerous and it takes great ascetic efforts to contain it. In fact, the greater part of the tyagis' ascetic methods is directed towards accumulating and containing heat and therewith magical power. It might be clear that the ascetic practices which focus on the sacred fire and its ashes form an important cluster. The smearing of ashes on the body and the placing of fires to accumulate heat act to create a boundary between tyagis and other Ramanandi sadhus, but on the other hand it obfuscates the differences between them and ascetics who are not Ramanandis. The placing of fires for the accumulation of heat is also a major aspect of the ritualised life of the Shaivite NathJogis, and in general ashes are symbolic of Shiva, the great ascetic god, and not of Vishnu. Ramanandi tyagis readily admit that there is a great resemblance between their life-style and that of the Shaivite ascetics. The difference lies, according to them, primarily in the meditation on the Name of Ram. The meditation formula not only refers to Ram as the ultimate reality, but is in fact Ram himself (cf. Bakker I986: 72). Theologically, they regard Shiva as Ram's greatest devotee, but, as we have already observed, theology is not very important for tyagis. Except for the cult of the Name of Ram, the tyagis seem to be closer to the Shaivite Yogis in terms of rituals and religious experiences than to their Ramanandi brethren of rasik persuasion. A second important cluster of activities is the taking of vows (vrat). There are an almost infinite number of vows or austerities to take, and not only the tyagis, but all Ramanandi sadhus indulge in them. The most important vow is of course that of celibacy. The tyagi gives a special meaning to this vow which is different from the one given above in our discussion of vairagya. As we have already argued tyag is more radical than vairagya and so is the tyagi's celibacy. The tyagi retains his seed not to be able to devote himself entirely to the service of Ram, but to contain his heat, energy and power. Contact with women, especially in the vulnerable years of building up one's power, is considered to be highly dangerous, since it may result in the spilling of semen, even involuntarily. The tyagi wants to kill his desire (kama), following the myth-model of Shiva who killed the god of sensual love, Kama. Sexual desire is sometimes quenched in a very violent way. The tyagis speak of the breaking of the mind (man-tor), so that the illusions of the world are broken and its attractions warded off. A step further on this path of using violence against oneself is by breaking the penis (tang-tor) which three of my informants claimed to have gone through. Other austerities bring out an opposition between nature and culture which is very marked in the lifestyle of tyagis. They often claim to eat only uncooked things from the jungle. In this way they emphasise a distinction between their</page><page sequence="10">PETER VAN DER VEER 689 itinerant 'jungle' life and sedentarised life in villages and towns. In their way of dressing this opposition serves as a boundary within the Ramanandi order between tyagis who wear 'jungle clothes' which may amount to wearing practically nothing, and sedentarised sadhus who wear woven cotton cloth (vastradhari). Performing austerities enhances self-control and quenches desire. From the tyagi's point of view, however, it is a positive method which does not only aim to suppress affects, but also to acquire special religious experiences and magical power. The latter is not always explicitly claimed by tyagis, but certainly always ascribed to them by their lay followers who seek their magical blessings and therapeutical advice. Tyagis are often seen as especially effective in exorcising demons, since they have conquered the world of desire, a clear allusion to the fact that demons arise from that world. Finally, a third cluster of practices important for the tyagis focuses on the worship of Lord Ram. As we have seen, the sacred fire is considered to be a manifestation of Ram. Besides the fire they also worship a black ammonite (shalagram) which represents Ram and stones smeared with red paste, said to represent Hanuman. However, the tyagis also carry small anthropomorphic images, especially of Ram and Hanuman, with them. In general, they regard the worship of images (murti-puja) as relatively irrelevant, but condone the practice as a method to reach the laity who are thought to be unable to worship without images. In their view Ram is essentially 'without qualities' (nirguna) and to worship him as 'having qualities' (saguna) is of minor importance. The sacred fire and the black ammonite were taken to be manifestations of nirguna Ram. They certainly considered themselves as devotees of Ram (Ram bhaktas), but focusing on Nirguna Ram their bhakti did not require image worship. This attitude towards image-worship is of sociological significance. Both tyagi and lay informants were of the opinion that image worship requires caste distinctions, since only priests of high status can attend to the images of Ram and Sita, while the worship of the aniconic manifestations of nirguna Ram does not require these distinctions. There seems thus to be an affinity between the idea that the ultimate reality is without qualities which makes image worship irrelevant, and ritual practices in which this ultimate reality can be worshipped without caste distinctions. So much of religious activities. We may now have a picture of the prototypi- cal tyagi: a wild man with matted hair, smeared with ashes, unconstrained by social conventions, travelling alone or in itinerant groups from village to village through the jungle, being without residence (alamgi) and without family (nihamgi). From a sociological point of view, one of the most important aspects of this way of life is a clear tendency to neglect caste. Tyagi informants of low caste origin always stressed in interviews that while travelling around caste distinctions were not followed, even in cooking. Only after arrival in a village or in a pilgrimage centre was a distinction made between twice-born tyagis and others. To put it bluntly, the tyagi itinerant groups are organised as brother- hoods in which caste distinctions are de-emphasised and which follow a very open recruitment policy. Status depends here on ascetic achievement, while positions of authority, like abbotship, are awarded by majority vote.</page><page sequence="11">690 PETER VAN DER VEER The itinerant groups of sadhus from different ascetic orders have played an important role in Indian history. Even now they not only offer their religious teachings, but also horses, camels, elephants, money and other items of long-distance trade to the villagers and the merchants of the qasba. They were the ascetic trader-soldiers who dominated long-distance trade in northern India, at least during the seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Cohn (I964) points out that Shaivite sadhus were the commercial leaders of the important north Indian commercial town Mirzapur in the eighteenth century. He argues that ascetics had great advantages as traders, since they could pool resources without being forced to divide them among inheritors. Moreover, they could use their pilgrimage cycle which ran from Hardwar in the north through the Gangetic plain to Bengal andJagannath Puri. Bayly (I983: I43) puts it succinctly: Using a combination of military and commercial power, they could link up areas of supply and demand in the stable and productive zones and provide their own protection on the different routes between them. Their corporate savings and investment habits enabled them to form and direct the uses of capital with great efficiency. By the I780's, the ascetic sects seem to have comprised the dominant moneylending and property-owning groups in Allahabad, Benares and Mirzapur. It is indeed not hard to understand that with these great interests at stake the tyagi itinerant groups had to be able to defend themselves or to attack, when necessary. It is, however, difficult to say when ascetic groups started to organise themselves in a military fashion, though it is clear that asceticism and organised violence is a historical combination of long standing in India (cf. Lorenzen I978). With the improvement of communications in the seventeenth century and the connected growth of pilgrimage (Bayly I980) ascetic military organis- ation seems to have become more important. Oral history in the Ramanandi order refers to a great increase of competition between the different ascetic orders in the eighteenth century. This increase in organised violence, especially between the Shaivite Dashanamis and the Ramanandis, is commonly regarded by the militant ascetics, the nagas (lit. 'naked ones'), as the cause of their military organisation. Evidently disparate Ramanandi ascetic groups endeavoured in the early eighteenth century to organise themselves in regiments and armies. In so doing they were copying the military organisation of the Dashanami nagas. Besides protecting their combined pilgrimage and trade routes these Shaivite nagas were already famous as condottieri. In their armies anyone could make a career, based on personal qualities rather than on caste identity. They were hired by the Nawabs of Awadh as well as by Hindu rajas, but could also fight independently (Barnett I980). We know much less about the historical role of Ramanandi nagas in state formation than we know about the Dashanamis. From the available evidence, however, it seems clear that besides copying the Dashanami organisation the Ramanandis also followed the same ascetic policy of open recuitment. I would also like to suggest that there is a continuity in religious style between tyagis and nagas. Ramanandi asceticism is a means of acquiring power. Physical and magical power are not seen to be contradictory. Ascetics use inward</page><page sequence="12">PETER VAN DER VEER 69I violence on their own body and mind to acquire power over the microcosm of their individual existence and the connected macrocosm of nature. They also use outward violence to acquire power in society. The Ramanadi naga is an ascetic warrior, following the myth-model of Hanuman, the great yogi who fights simultaneously with magical and military means. Moreover, we find with the nagas the kind of organisational set-up we also found with the tyagis. A good example is Hanumangarhi in Ayodhya, a temple-fortress with at least 500 naga inhabitants. Hanumangarhi is a panchayati temple, meaning that it is governed by the assembly of naga inhabitants. The abbot of the temple is very restricted. He is even not allowed to leave the temple compound without permission of the assembly. The temple gives ample scope to free enterprise by the individual nagas. A naga may leave the temple to live in one of the many houses in Ayodhya which are owned by the temple and start his own business. In this way at least a hundred nagas pursue a commercial career in money-lending and shopkeeping, without being hindered by institutional constraints. Rasiks: sweet devotion The majority of Ramanandi sadhus in Ayodhya lead a religious life which is in tone and quality almost entirely different from that of tyagis and nagas. They are called rasiks and follow the path of sweet devotion (madhuryopasana). Since their arrival in Ayodhya in the early eighteenth century, protected by their militant brethren, the nagas, they have gradually come to dominate this religious centre. They populate most of Ayodhya's temples, since they are not alamgi (without residence), as the tyagis are, but asthanandharis (temple-dwellers). Rather than deeming image-worship relatively unimportant, as the tyagis do, they empha- sise a kind of religious theatre, in which they act out their emotional attachment to the deities while worshipping the images. They spend much effort in beautifying their temples and the images of the gods, since they hold the belief that the vision of god (jhanki) one receives during these activities is of immense religious value. All one's actions should be devoted to pleasing the gods and in that way one reaches real bliss. Rasiks emphasise theological knowledge rather more than tyagis and nagas do. Their beliefs and ritual activities are very intricate and elaborated in a theory of 'sentiments' or 'moods' (ras), underpinned by theological niceties. In the devotional theatre the worshipper acts out an emotional relationship with the gods. The most common identity taken by the worshipper is that of girl-friend (sakhi) of Sita, although other devotional attitudes may also be chosen. The rasiks are for this reason often called sakhis. As Sita's girl-friend the Ramanandi is able to serve Ram and Sita in their esoteric and erotic play (lila). To make this idea acceptable they have had to develop a theological re-interpretation of the traditional Ram story. Hanuman, for example, who is regarded as a great magician and warrior and as an incarnation of the fierce Bhairava by tyagis and nagas, but also by the laity, is given the female identity of girl-friend of Sita by the rasiks. In an attempt to bring about a radical transformation of their masculinity in the ritual theatre of temple worship, the rasiks dress as females and</page><page sequence="13">692 PETER VAN DER VEER sometimes even go so far as to observe the taboos of the menstruation period. Exactly what kind of relation the rasiks think they have with Ram remains a secret for outsiders. The common line is that the rasiks only act as observers of the maritaljoy of Ram and Sita, the divine couple. Moreover, Ram is considered to be ekpatnivrat, loyal to only his wife, Sita. It will be clear that we have come a long way from the naked violence which characterised the life-style of tyagis and nagas. Those with some basic knowledge of Hinduism will already have recognised some similarities between what the Ramanandi rasiks do and believe and the religious attitudes of the Krishna- devotees in the Braj region. To my mind there can be no doubt that the sweet Krishna devotion which was promulgated by the Krishnaite groups of Braj had a great influence on the worship of Ram, as practised by Ramaite ascetic groups who were gradually to form the Ramanandi order. This influence amounted to a 'Krishnaisation' of the mythology and theology of Ram. We have already seen the transformation of the violent Hanuman in the sweet girl-friend of Sita, but also the life of the virtuous king (dharmaraja) Ram had to be interpreted in terms of the playing, sensuous and mischievous Krishna. Moreover the relationship between Ram and Sita, which emerges from the Ram story as a model of the 'passionless' ideal marriage, had to be eroticised to a love-play (lila). The rasik emphasis on ritual theatre in temples, focused on the images of Ram and Sita 'with attributes' (saguna), has a number of social implications. The rasiks are clearly the most sedentarised of the Ramanandi sadhus. They do not travel in itinerant groups and their temples are theological centres. Most of the abbots of these temples either have been married and have children, having entered the order in the later celibate stage of life, or keep a mistress. They do not see celibacy as having an intrinsic religious value in the way the tyagis do who need to contain their accumulated heat. It is not the fact that these rasiks have sexual relations which has to be explained, but rather that they stick, at least in theory, to the celibacy which is essential to their identity as Ramanandi sadhus. Contrary to the indifference of tyagis to caste distinctions, these are of great importance to rasiks. While it is a general rule that only those belonging to the three highest status-categories (twice-born) are allowed to enter the sanctum, there is a clear tendency in rasik temples to give only Brahmans the positions of authority, such as those of officiating priest and abbot. Of crucial importance is the fact that these temples are not governed by the assembly of sadhus, as we have seen is the case with the naga monastery of Hanumangarhi. They are owned by the abbots and given that one becomes an abbot not by election, but by pupillary succession, one can imagine how powerful these rasik abbots can be. Here again, however, I do not believe that this situation impairs their spiritual authority. On the contrary, the richest rasik abbots in Ayodhya were also the most important gurus in spiritual matters. Conclusion: the taming of the ascetic I have tried to convey an admittedly oversimplified picture of the differences between Ramanandi sadhus I encountered in Ayodhya. What we have seen</page><page sequence="14">PETER VAN DER VEER 693 might be presented as a series of oppositions: itinerant life versus sedentarised life; relative indifference to caste origin in militant and ascetic life versus importance of caste in temple worship; ascetic practices directed at attaining godhead within oneself versus devotional practices directed at the worship of god through external images in temples; celibacy as a method to contain heat and ascetic power versus celibacy as a way of devoting oneself completely to the worship of god. This seems to add up to a structural opposition of asceticism versus devotionalism, but to put it that way would lead us to commit a basic error. In our urge to generalise we would neglect the historical context, in which ascetic and devotional experiences get their meaning and social significance. Of major importance here seems a historical trend of sedentarisation of sadhus which has been favourable to devotional worship and at the same time has amounted to the taming of wild asceticism. Till the nineteenth century asceticism was a most rewarding and promising option. Especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, when ascetic orders dominated major parts of trade and soldiery, they offered great social opportunities and, what is more, an equality in opportunity. Without being hindered by one's caste identity one could opt for the relatively open identity of tyagi or naga and start a more or less individual career. This freedom created, of course, its own inequalities, but they were based upon ascetic entrepreneurship rather than on the ascriptive status of caste. With the Pax Britannica this world of opportunity gradually disappeared. The period came to a characteristic end in the so-called Sannyasi rebellion, a protracted battle between ascetics of different persuasions and the British from I780-I 800 (Ghosh I930). The military organ- isation of the Ramanandi nagas, which had emerged from the loosely structured tyagi groups, gradually lost its military functions. But like the Banjaras, the gypsy-travellers, the itinerant ascetics still kept a role in long-distance trade in camels and horses till well into the twentieth century. The importance of trading in ascetic life, however, lost much of its importance, when the British started to develop railways and other communications in the late nineteenth century. Gradually the Banjaras disappeared from the stage and during my fieldwork the last tyagi abbot in Ayodhya, who had organised trading on a large scale, died. Another long-term development, starting in the late sixteenth century, has been the expansion of a devotional movement among the Ramanandis which got much of its impetus from the Krishnaite sects of Braj. To my mind, the rasik emphasis on the worship of anthropomorphic images of Ram and Sita is sociologically of great importance. Images belong properly to temples and temples belong in villages or towns, and especially in sacred places. The 'finding' of 'lost' or 'hidden' images and sacred places in the establishment of a localised cult, documented by Vaudeville (I976) and Burghart (I978), has been one of the major aspects of the expansion of the bhakti movement in north India. One may argue here for a relation between the devotional worship of images in a localised temple cult and a process of sedentarisation. Moreover, the priestly worship of images should be confined to members of pure castes, and especially Brahmans, if one wants to have the support of lay members of higher castes. Sedentarisation, the devotional worship of images in temples and caste inequality seem to have an affinity in the Weberian sense. Moreover, social and</page><page sequence="15">694 PETER VAN DER VEER religious identities are not merely the result of the free option of individuals. To a great extent the options are constrained by the configurations of power. An important role in making the Ramanandis follow caste regulations has, for example, been played by Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur (I688-I743), in whose state some of the largest Ramanandi monasteries are still to be found. At this stage, however, there was still an ambivalence in Hindu state policy towards ascetics, since on the one hand the kings needed military and commercial support which could be provided by ascetics with an open recruitment policy, while on the other hand they were bound to uphold and enforce the ideology of caste. When in the nineteenth century the commercial and military side of the Ramanandi order became of little consequence, sedentarisation and royal patronage made caste more important for the sadhus. Returning to the problem of the social implications of bhakti with which we started, I would argue that bhakti has no religious or social essence which would enable us to make generalisations. The Ramanandis are devotees (bhaktas) of Lord Ram, but bhakti has a different meaning for tyagis, nagas and rasiks. Bhakti as a religious experience gets its meaning in the context of practices which are conditioned by religious organisation. The way these practices are organised is clearly affected by the simple fact of whether these sadhus lead an itinerant or a sedentary life. When we find that the Ramanandi rasiks practise a 'Krishnaite' model of bhakti which focuses on image worship in temples, we may conclude that at least this type of bhakti requires sedentarisation and forces sadhus to acknowledge caste distinctions in their ritual activities. In that sense there can be no doubt that religious practice has certain social and, for that matter, psycho- logical implications, but quite different from those one would have expected from reading much of the literature on bhakti4. The connected problem of the relation between bhakti and social change leads us to ask how the success of the 'Krishnaite' model of bhakti might be related to the sedentarisation of ascetic groups. Though we may feel a legitimate urge to present the muddle of history in some coherent form, it is in fact unclear how these two processes are linked. Despite a process of sedentarisation the tyagis have not disappeared, but have merely been marginalised. They have adapted to changing circumstances as also the nagas have done. A modest conclusion may be that the rasik style has become in the nineteenth century a more viable option for Ramanandi sadhus than the styles of tyagis and nagas. It is, however, impossible to show any grand design behind these historical tendencies. NOTES The fieldwork for this article was carried out at intervals between I980 and I984 and was supported by the Netherlands Foundation for Tropical Research. Discussions with Chris Fuller, Lisette van den Hoogen, Johnny Parry and Bonno Thoden van Velzen have helped to shape my argument. I should also like to thank the seminar on Equality and Inequality, organised by James Woodburn at the London School of Economics, for useful suggestions. Ayodhya had, in I98I, 30,468 inhabitants. It is, however, extremely difficult to make a correct estimate of its population, which consists in large part of peripatetic sadhus and pilgrims who may stay for a week, a month or even a year. Besides the relatively sedentary population, the Municipal office has also an estimate for the so-called 'floating' population, which was in I983 one million.</page><page sequence="16">PETER VAN DER VEER 695 According to rough estimates there are 4,360 houses and about3,ooo temples in Ayodhya. Ayodhya is not only a Ramanandi centre, but also a pilgrimage place for Brahmanical rituals near the river Sarayu, in which Brahman priests officiate (cf. van der Veer i985). An ethnographic and historical description of Ayodhya and its religious specialists is given in van der Veer, in press. 2 Hardy (i983) argues that there is a difference between 'intellectual' bhakti and 'emotional' bhakti in the context of Krishna worship. I would suggest that the meanings of bhakti proliferate when we consider other than Krishnaite contexts. 3 Some of these wordly activities and their consequences for communal politics are discussed in Van der Veer I987b. 4 For an interpretation of the psychological implications of these practices in the Ramanandi order, see Van der Veer I987a.
