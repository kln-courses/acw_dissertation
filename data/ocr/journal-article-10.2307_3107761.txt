(Patrimoines, Islam.) 336pp. Paris: Editions du CERF, 1997. Fr. 250. The Sunna contains many statements of Muhammad and of some of his Companions describing God in anthropomorphic terms. Such hadiths, just like similar descriptions in the Quran, soon became the subject of major dispute among the religious scholars. While the literalists, especially most Hanbalis, insisted on their acceptance without argument (bila kayf), the rationally inclined theologians attempted to discredit them, either by rejecting them as forgeries or by interpreting their anthropo- morphisms metaphorically, or as not really referring to God. Most famous among the works of the anti-literalist theologians was the Kitdb (Ta'wil) mushkil al-hadith of the Ash'ari theologian Ibn Furak (d. 406/1015). In the present book, Daniel Gimaret gathers these hadiths from the canonical and uncanon- ical Sunni collections, arranging them according to subject matter in chapters dealing with the location and movements of God, His 'body', and His human emotions and behaviour, such as laughing, marvelling, enjoying and being ashamed. He provides a careful, annotated translation of the hadiths, noting variants, identifying their transmitters down to the 'common link', and analyses the efforts to neutralize them by the anti-anthropomorphist theologians, from Ibn al-Thalji and Ibn Qutayba down to al-Suyuti. In his introduction, Gimaret explains that he will not attempt to examine the authenticity of the individual hadiths and expresses his belief that the bulk of them are authentic. He argues that while hadiths concerning predestination, the definition of faith, or the imamate could well be invented because there was an obvious motive and interest to do so, there was no such interest in spreading a belief that God had fingers, a leg and a foot. One would, he suggests, expect the transmitters to have tried to suppress such statements rather than invent them. This view, however, may well be questioned, not only by scholars of the Goldziher-Schacht school, who hold that there are no authentic hadiths going back to Muhammad. Belief in an anthropomorphic God is usually no less grounded in elementary religious sentiment and interest than belief in predestination. To many pious faithful it has ever been a comfort to believe in a personal God with human features and emotions to whom they could readily relate in prayer as it has been a comfort for them to trust that everything that happens in the world is predetermined by God and that they are among the elect. The prominence given to these anthropomorphist hadiths in Hanbali creeds and books like Ibn Khuzayma's Kitab al-Tawhid makes it unlikely that the literalists held on to these merely out of a conservative respect for a tradition which somehow embar- rassed them, and that the famous formula of bila kayf had any agnostic implication. The literalist theologians were quite certain that these anthropomorphic descriptions of God were literally true and that any metaphorical interpretation of them was not only impermiss- ible but false. Ibn Hanbal in fact found the quranic 'nothing is like unto Him' (laysa ka-mithlihi shay'), on which the anti-literalists often relied, more embarrassing than the anthropomorphisms of Quran and Sunna, and declared it to belong to the ambiguous verses (mutashabihat) of the Quran that must not be generalized. The anthropomorphisms in the Sunna are, moreover, much more unambiguous and crude than those in the Quran. Gimaret repeatedly points out the artificiality and arbitrariness of the interpretations of these hadiths by the anti- literalist theologians. If they are indeed authen- tic, the conclusion can hardly be avoided that Muhammad's theological view of God was solidly anthropomorphist. The Quran mostly reflects Muhammad's spontaneous religious experiences rather than theological reflection. The quranic anthropomorphisms are much more amenable to metaphorical interpretation and in some instances distinctly invite it. There is plausible evidence that Muhammad at first interpreted his early vision, described in suras 53 and 81, as a vision of God, but later came to interpret it as a vision of the angel Gabriel. Anti-anthropomorphist verses such as 'Nothing is like unto Him' and 'eyesight does not comprehend Him' (la tudrikuhu 'l-anzar) seem to reflect his later, more reflective view. Haadths asserting that the Prophet told his Companions that he saw his Lord in the most beautiful shape of a beardless youth and that he felt the coolness of His palm between his shoulder blades are difficult to reconcile with the quranic image of God. In the Quran God is both awesome and merciful, but there is hardly a trace of the 'beautiful God' of the Sufis. If Muhammad had really had such an experience of God one would expect to find some reflection of it in the Quran. W. MADELUNG RICHARD C. MARTIN and MARK R. WOODWARD with DWI S.

Scott Appleby's 'Funda- mentalism Project' (Fundamentalism observed, 1991), Bruce Lawrence's Defenders of God- the fundamentalist revolt against the modern age (1989) or Ernest Gellner's Postmodernism, reason and religion (1992). The authors argue first, that the focus of modern scholarship, or neo-Orientalism as they call it, has dispropor- tionally been on Muslim traditionalists and Islamic fundamentalist movements. This con- centration on fundamentalism as the exclusive answer to modernity often led to overlooking more rational attempts, such as Mu'tazilism, rationalism or Islamic modernism to find Islamic answers to current questions. The authors argue instead that the revival of interest in Mu'tazilism and theological rationalism since the second half of the nineteenth century is to be interpreted as a significant modernist counter-move against traditionalism/funda- mentalism. Secondly, the authors challenge the tendency in modem scholarship to identify modernity as the sole explanation for the phenomenon of fundamentalism. In their view, such reductions are unable to provide an adequate explanation of fundamentalism. They attempt to show instead that the conflict between the two trends, rationalism and tradi- tionalism, has been present throughout the entire history of Islam as a theological conflict in Islamic societies-mainly as a conflict between Mu'tazilism on the one hand and Hanbalism on the other hand. Both trends, the authors maintain, continue to exist and to define themselves, in part, in relation to each other. To strengthen their case, the authors offer in part I of the book an outline of the history of the Mu'tazilite movement from its beginnings in the second/eighth century until the fifth/ eleventh century. They focus on the classical period of Mu'tazilism, which was dominated by the school founded by Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i (d. 321/933), the Bahshamiyya. The overview is followed by a detailed account of the life and works of the Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar al-Hamadhanm (d. 415/1025), the head of the Bahshamiyya of his time and the author of one of the most significant kaldm texts of this period, the Kitdb al-Mughnl. As a sample of classical Mu'tazilism they offer an outline of the contents and a translation of a short summary of Mu'tazilite doctrine by 'Abd al-Jabbar, al-Usul al-khamsa. The historical and doctrinal outline provides a very readable introduction to the historical and doctrinal development of Mu'tazilism, although one might have wished for a fuller account of the post-'Abd al-Jabbar developments of Mu'tazilism, in particular with regard to the last school of Mu'tazilism founded by Abu '1-Husayn al-Basri (d. 436/1044). As the authors intend, among other things, 'to identify some of the more pertinent work of modern scholar- ship, especially that which is accessible to Western readers, on particular issues' (p. 87), mention should be made of M. J. McDermott's and W. Madelung's edition of the Kitab al-Mu'tamad ft usul al-din of Ibn al-Malahimi (d. 536/1141) (London, 1991), one of the most important representatives of the teachings of Abu '1-Husayn al-Basr, containing an excellent introduction by the editors outlining the pro- found impact of the school's doctrine on the Zaydiyya and on the Twelver Shia. It might also be of interest that an edition and transla- tion of the Minhdj fi usul al-din by al-Zamakhshari (d. 538/1144), a text to which the authors frequently refer in this section (pp. 39ff.), has meanwhile been published (A Mu'tazilite creed of az-Zamahsarl (d. 538/ 1144) (al-Minhag fi usul ad-dn), ed. and tr. S. Schmidtke, Stuttgart, 1997 [revd. below]). Parts II and III of the book seek to demonstrate the modem relevance of the Mu'tazilite theological school. Part II starts off with an overview of Islamic modernism, which was largely inspired by the spirit of Mu' tazilite rationalism. It investigates how their main representatives applied elements of Mu'tazilite rationalism to modern social and political issues of their time (Muhammad 'Abduh, Sayyid Ahmad Khan). It furthermore points out that even resurgent traditionalism made limited use of rationalism put in the service of revelation (Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab), arguing that the modernity/tradi- tion dichotomy is difficult to maintain as both trends-modernist interpretation of Islam as well as neo-Hanbalism-are relevant for the shaping of the various answers of contemporary Islamic movements to the challenges of modern- ity. Moreover, the significance of rationalism in Indonesian Islamic thought and the various modernist and traditionalist trends in Indonesia prior to Harun Nasution (Muhammadiyah, Nahdatul Ulama, Renewal of Religious Thought Movement) is assessed. The main focus within this chapter is on the modern Indonesian thinker Harun Nasution, who was first attracted to Mu'tazilism during his stay as a student in Egypt and later in Canada (McGill). Nasution holds the revival of Mu'tazilite thought to be essential for the modernization of Islam, and explicitly considers himself a Mu'tazilite. The authors offer a translation of his exposition defending Mu'tazilism, Kaum Mu'tazilah dan pandangan rasionalanya (The Mu'tazila and rational philo- sophy), which was composed in the late 1970s. Part III focuses on a select number of modernist and post-modernist Muslim intellec- tuals (Fazlur Rahman, Mohammad Arkoun, Fatima Mernissi, Hassan Hanafi) who do not consider themselves Mu'tazilites but who none the less find in the rationalism for which the Mu'tazilite theologians are remembered a counterpoise to Islamic traditionalist/funda- mentalist movements. The authors point out that, despite their selective use of particular aspects of Mu' tazilite doctrine and intellectual history, these thinkers share the view that Mu'tazilite rationalism and free thinking is a symbol of the ability of Muslims to encounter change and external challenges in ways that can be construed as Islamic. When the authors defend 'rationalist' Islam as 'the historical impulse of the Mu'tazili mutakallimun in particular (but kalam more generally) to articulate the message of Islam within any given age's contemporary intellec- tual and social trends' and attribute to Mu'tazilism qualifications such as 'dynamic', ' rational', and 'culturally plural' (pp. 14, 216),</page><page sequence="3">anything which is perceivable, which is very different from claiming that he does actually perceive everything. There are frequent interesting passages like this, in which al-Zamakhsharipresents Ash'arite and varying Mu'tazilite interpretations and opinions on particular theological issues. The translation is quite literal and matches the lapidary style of the original text, which is very helpfully included at the end of the book (it is a shame it is not on facing pages with the translation). Schmidtke adds generally helpful notes, although she is sometimes not entirely accurate. For example, when discussing the infliction of pain she presents Abu Hashim's view as that God could bring about a pain in us for some good end, which would match the pain, or that he could compensate for the pain by providing us with an equivalent pleasure at a later date. She suggests that al-Zamakhshari argues that such pain is only permissible if there is no other way to achieve the beneficial end without the pain. If there is a choice between selecting something pleasant or some- thing painful, it would be futile to choose the latter. She is quite right on this point, but Abu Hashim's argument is that it is permissible to cause pain in order to bring about a favourable end if the compensation for it exceeds the pain. Schmidtke thinks that Abu Hashim's suggestion is that subsequent pleasure 'neutralizes' earlier pain, but his point is rather that a greater later pleasure can compensate entirely for an earlier pain. She is confused by al-Zamakhshari's objection to Abu Hashim here, in that al-Zamakhshari argues that it would be wrong to cause pain for no other reason than to provide subsequent compensation. But of course this is a poor objection, since the original suggestion is that the pain is created in order to bring about some beneficial result, and is more than compensated by some pleasure. OLIVER LEAMAN WAEL B. HALLAQ: A history of Islamic legal theories: an introduction to Sunni usul al-fiqh. ix, 294 pp. Cambridge, New York and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1997. ?35. In his latest contribution to the study of Islamic legal theory, Professor Hallaq aims to provide an account of both the history and the major themes of the genre of Muslim legal writing known as usul al-fiqh (legal theory). The book makes interesting reading, utilizing an impress- ive array of sources and it equips the reader with a framework within which the ideas of individual jurists can be positioned. The work is divided into six chapters and a conclusion. The first chapter contains Hallaq's account of the early development of the science of usul, which will be familiar to many. The second and third chapters describe the main themes found in the classical works of the genre. The fourth contains an astute analysis of the manner in which the themes of the genre were structured and organized by different writers. The fifth the reader is somewhat reminded of the percep- tion of Mu' tazilism by European scholars such as Heinrich Steiner in the second half of the nineteenth century, who considered the Mu' tazilites as free-thinkers of Islam. Although this perception is questionable as far as classical Mu'tazilism is concerned, it is, however, certainly valid according to the perception of Muslim modernists who often see in Mu'tazilism a symbol of intellectual freedom and liberty, democracy and humanism, as becomes clear from the examples referred to in this book.

LI, 4.), 83 pp. Stuttgart: Deutsche Morgenlandische Gesellschaft, Kommissionsverlag Franz Steiner, 1997. DM 42. Al-Zamakhshari was writing at a very interes- ting time in the history of Mu'tazilism. He lived in Khwarazm in the sixth/twelfth century, when Mu'tazilism was in free fall in the rest of the Islamic world, yet seemed not only to survive but even to flourish in the east. There even existed two main Mu'tazilite schools in the area, that of Abu '1 Husayn al-Basri, and also the Bahshamiyya school of the two al-Jubba'is, Abu 'All and Abu Hashim. There can be little doubt but that al-Zamakhshari adheres in general to the school of al-Basri, and was obviously heavily influenced by the writings of Ibn al-Malahimi, his teacher. This text is interesting for showing how carefully he skates between the different versions of Mu'tazilism, presenting arguments for al-Basri and against the Bahshamiyya. He is chiefly known as a quranic commentator, and this creed has all the clarity and conciseness of that literary form. The particularly interesting aspects of this creed are the places where the author commits himself to a particular interpretation of Mu'tazilism. For example, the Mu'tazilites took a rather restrictive view of the nature of divine power, agreeing that God has power over our actions, but not in the sense that he dominates those actions. Were he to do so, then it would not be just to punish us for going awry. The Basra school got around this prob- lem by accepting that God has power over classes of human actions, but not over particu- lar actions. A related problem arose in linking divine knowledge and perception. Many of the early Mu' tazilites argued that divine perception is reducible to divine knowledge, so that for God to perceive or hear something means that he knows what we experience through our senses. But according to al-Zamakhshari, God's seeing and hearing is an aspect of his being alive, but this does not mean that he has to see or hear everything which can be seen or heard. What it does mean is that he can perceive 537 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
