<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Great Goddess of Samaria D. FLUSSER Hebrew University, Jerusalem In memory of M. Avi-Yonah In the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem is exhibited an inscription from Samaria (PL 2: A), which reads as follows: The inscription is painted in red on a marble fragment which was found in a cistern in the stadium at Samaria. In the cistern were also found parts of a female statue carrying a torch, ears of wheat and a pomegranate, which may represent Kore (Pl. 2: ).1 The arrangement of the letters shows that the marble fragment was in its present broken condition when the inscription was written. It seems that the inscrip tion was not placed under the statue of Kore but was rather an acclamation on the wall of the stadium. The statue, which is also in the Rockefeller Museum, is dated to the late second or early third century a.d. The inscription, however, is attributed by Crowfoot to the late third or fourth century,2 but this dating is by no means sure. It is possible that the cult of Kore or Persephone was brought to Samaria in the Hellenistic period by Macedonian colonists, although evidence for this cult dates only from the Roman period. Other inscriptions relating to Kore have been found at Samaria ? one dedicated by Kalpurnianos, son of Gaianos the High Priest, to the Lady Kore,3 and another which reads: 'May the learned master Martialis and his friends be remembered by the Kore.'4 According to Sukenik: 'In the Roman period EICQEOC A AECnOTHC E A HANEIKHTOC E e a e e a a e One god, the ruler of all, great Kore, the invincible The inscription ? inventory No. 32.2348; the statue of Kore ? 32.2485.

The Kore . . . was worshipped in the stadium from an early period and it may be that in the third century, when her cult reached its peak ... a second temple was built in her honour on the site of an earlier Isis temple.'5 A dedication from the third century b.c. to Sarapis and Isis was also found at Samaria.6 If a temple of Kore was really built on the site of a temple of Isis in Samaria, the change was probably not very great. Kore (maiden) is the common designation of Persephone and an epithet of Isis, who might be identified with one another.7 As will be seen, the possibility of such an identification is important for the understanding of our inscription. It has also been noted that the marble statue of Kore from Samaria resembles a statue of Isis from Delos which is associated with an inscription of the late second century a.d.8 How should the inscription itself be understood? It is clear that its first three lines ('one god, the ruler of all') designate the 'great Kore, the invincible', rather than proclaiming the oneness of God. Not only are there many parallels;9 the female designation 'one goddess' would also miss the point that Kore is the 'one god, the ruler of all'. In our inscription the goddess Kore is characterized as 'great', an epithet given to many gods in inscriptions.10 A stranger fact is that Kore is named a e ? 'the invincible' ? a designation otherwise known to me only in connection with Helios or Sol invictus. Kore's title of One god' must be near to the notion of 'only god', or her charac terization as the 'ruler of all' would be incomprehensible.11 Thus, the inscription is important evidence of monotheistic trends in that stage of religion which can be called high paganism. In Greek religion, high paganism evolved after the pantheon stage, when the concept of a family of anthropomorphic gods had become an obstacle to further religious development; roots of high paganism can already be found in the period of Greek enlightenment and the great schools of philosophy. It is also seen in 5 J.W. Crowfoot, Kathleen M. Keynon, E.L. Sukenik: Samaria-Sebaste, , The Buildings at Samaria, London, 1942, p. 67; see also pp. 46-48, 62-67, and op. cit. (above, n. 1), pp. 5-8.

He also (p. 251, n. 2) expresses his doubts about the existence of pagan monotheism in late antiquity. I would suggest that both of the above expres sions are nearer to the monotheistic tendencies of high paganism than Peterson accepts, or even that they often reflect directly such tendencies; this is surely the case of our inscription. The question can be solved, if the fact of monotheistic tendencies in high paganism is accepted, and we remember that they are not identical with Jewish, Christian or Moslem monotheism. See also M.P. Nilsson: Geschichte der griechischen Religion, , M?nchen, 1961, pp. 569-578.</page><page sequence="3">GREAT GODDESS OF SAMARIA 15 the Roman period, especially in the second century A.D., when a revival of piety occurred. This type of religion is not restricted to later Greek antiquity, but can be seen in the religions of Egypt and India. It is possible that in other religions high paganism was also preceded by parallel stages, but it is evident that it was always associated with monotheistic tendencies. There were, roughly speaking, two types of monotheistic tendency in later antiquity. In the first, philosophical type, single gods were manifestations, aspects, or forces of the unique and supreme God. The adherents of the second, syncretistic trend tended to identify one god or goddess with many, or sometimes with all, other gods, at the same time elevating this god or goddess to the highest degree: he was the 'one', the One god', the ruler of all, the lord of the universe, kosmokrator. Although the two trends had different points of departure and different solutions, they were not thought of as two separate schools and very often included common ideas. The partisans of the philosophical trend were also prone to the syncretistic tendency, while the representative of the latter trend saw his special god as the highest god, of whom the other gods were different aspects or forms.12 The inner inconsis tencies of all monotheistic patterns in antiquity can be detected when we compare them with the living religion of India. There the single god or goddess is both an object of faith and adoration, a highly personal being, and an aspect of a higher god, identical with the others. The great Kore of Samaria is associated with the syncretistic monotheistic tendency in antiquity. Here it must be stressed that even when the syncretistic ideology is mono theistic to a high degree, explicitly named male gods are identified only with a god and female gods with a goddess. This strange lack of consistency is evidently dictated by psychological inhibitions: even when Apuleius says about his Isis (Metamorphosis, , 5) that she is lord of all the elements, the highest of the gods, their queen and the uniform type of the gods and goddesses,13 he identifies Isis only with goddesses: with the Mother of Gods, Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis, Persephone, Demeter, Hera, Bellona, Hecate and Ramnusia. The question is why Kore-Persephone is addressed in our inscription as 'one god, the ruler of all'. Is the fact that Kore is the central figure of the mysteries of Eleusis sufficient? We have already seen that in Samaria the worship of Kore probably super 12 Two loci classici for this aspect of the 'syncretistic' trend are Apuleius, Metamorphosis, xi, 5 (on Isis) and Macrobius, Saturnalia, i, chapters 17-23 (on Helios). 13 ... deorum dearumque fades uniformis. This was evidently what Apuleius wrote. Instead of deorum, manuscript f (on which all other manuscripts depend) originally had dearum and was only later corrected, as a right conjecture, to deorum. The conjecture was accepted by another manuscript (g); other manuscripts either read dearum or omit the word. (On the probable origin of the correc tions in f see Apul?e in D.S. Robertson (ed.): Les M?tamorphoses, Paris, 1940, p. xliv.) The fact that the archetype has dearum shows that its scribe evidently made the mistake because of his inhi bition against the idea that a goddess can be identified with male gods.</page><page sequence="4">16 D. FLUSSER seded that of Isis and that the marble statue of Kore from Samaria resembles a statue of Isis. We have also noted that Isis was sometimes identified with Perse phone.14 Isis was at that time the syncretistic goddess par excellence, with monotheistic inclinations. Thus, if the author of the inscription accepted the identity between Kore and Isis, it was natural for him to designate Kore as 'one god, the ruler of all'. However, one word of the inscription remains unexplained: the epithet 'invincible', which is characteristic of Helios, the Sol invictus. There is a twin of our inscription, a well-known acclamation from Rome dating from ca. a.D. 200, which both elucidates the meaning of the inscription from Samaria and increases its importance. The stone, found in the Mithraeum near the thermae of Caracalla,15 reads as follows: On the other side of the stone is written: Ad e a a a ] e a e a a . To Zeus Helios, the great Sarapis, the saviour, the giver of richness, listening to prayer, the invincible, Mithra, thank-offering. The similarity between this inscription and the one from Samaria is striking. The designation of Kore as 'great' has its parallel in the 'great Sarapis' on the verso of the stone from Rome.17 Now it becomes clear that the Kore of Samaria is called 'invincible' because the writer of the inscription was influenced by the theology of Sol invictus, and saw in his Kore a parallel to Helios, the lord of the universe. Not only are both Helios and Kore described as 'invincible' at the end of the inscriptions, but both inscriptions EIC ZEVC CAPATIIC HAIOC KOCMOKPA ANEIKHTOC E e a a a a e One, Zeus Sarapis16 Helios, lord of the universe, invincible. 14 See above, . 7. 15 F. Cumont: Les religions orientales dans le monde romain, Paris, 1929, p. 79; Peterson, op. cit. (above, . 9), pp. 238-239. 16 The name 'Sarapis' was changed on the stone into Mithra. See Peterson, op. cit. (above, n. 9), pp. 238-239 and Cumont, op. cit. (above, n. 15), p. 79 and illustration 5. Cumont thinks that this change was probably made after the death of Caracalla. !7 On the designation of gods as 'great' see above, n. 10.</page><page sequence="5">GREAT GODDESS OF SAMARIA 17 begin with the statement that the god is One', the 'one god'. If Kore is the 'ruler of all', Helios is the 'lord of the universe'. The comparison of the two inscriptions em phasizes the syncretistic element of the one from Samaria. From its content it should be deduced that its author, in whose eyes Kore was probably identical with Isis, a typically syncretistic goddess, identified Kore with other gods. In the inscription from Rome Helios is identified with Zeus and Sarapis, and by a later scribe even with Mithra.18 Thus the inscription from Samaria is an outstanding witness to ancient syncretistic monotheism. Can we draw further conclusions from the similarity between the two inscriptions? Two facts should be remembered: our inscription is influenced by the theology of Sol invictus and, as we have already seen, syncretism permits the identification of a god only with other concrete male gods and of a goddess with only specific goddesses.19 We cannot thus suppose that the hierophant from Samaria, though he described his Kore in terms almost identical with those used of Helios and even used his attribute 'invincible', thought of Kore as identical with the male Sol invictus. However, if Helios is the one god, the lord of the universe, how can Kore be the 'one god, the ruler of all'? Is it thus possible that the author of the inscription was speculating that Helios is the male and Kore the female aspect of the one god, the lord of the universe? Although consistency and systematic thought is lacking in ancient pagan monotheistic tendencies, such a concept is not unknown. In a famous passage, Macrobius20 des cribes the monotheistic trend in the theology of Helios: almost all gods were identified with the Sun. The gods he names are male gods, and he then brings arguments for the identification of female goddesses with the Earth.21 It seems that Macrobius incorporated in his 'monotheistic' treatise in honour of Helios another source, which presented pairs of gods and goddesses and identified the male god always with the Sun and the female goddess with the Earth. According to this source the existence of the pair does not mean that power is divided between these two deities, but rather that both are one, twofold deity.22 The first pair in the source is Sarapis and Isis;23 as we have seen, Sarapis was identified with Helios and Isis was sometimes identified is See above, . 16. 19 The only exception to this rule known to me is the philosophical speculation of Porphyrius, quoted by Macrobius, Saturnalia, i, 17, 70. According to him Athena is a dynamis of Helios: 'Por phyrius testatur Minerv?m esse virtutem solis quae humanis mentibus prudentiam subministrat nam ideo haec dea Iovis capite proganta memoratur id est de summa aetheris parte edita, unde origo solis est.' However, here also Helios is identified with Zeus and not directly with Athena. 20 Saturnalia, I, 17-23. 21 Ibid, I, 20, 13; 21, 14; 23, 17-21. 22 This argument is brought when Macrobius {Saturnalia, I, 23, 18) speaks about Adad (Hadad) ? whose name is explained as One one' * ? and Atargatis: 'omnemque potestatem cunctarum rerum his duobus adtribuunt solem terramque intellegentes nec multitudine nominum enuntiantes divisam eorum per omnes species potestatem sed argumentis quibus ornantur significantes multi plicem praestantiam duplicis numinis.' 23 Saturnalia, i, 20, 13-18.</page><page sequence="6">18 d. flusser with Kore. Thus the close parallelism between the dedication of Helios from Rome and the acclamation of Kore from Samaria may mean that the hierophant of Samaria was not only influenced by the theology of the Sol invictus, but also thought that Helios and the great Kore represented two aspects or manifestations of one god, the lord of the universe. It is tempting, in connection with the acclamation of the great Kore from Samaria, to remember a man who lived in the first century a.d. in the same region, the Sa maritan Simon Magus.24 Luke describes the dramatic meeting between Peter, the apostle of Jesus, the Son of God, and Simon, 'the power of God which is called great'.25 Not only do we learn from sources that Simon Magus saw himself as the manifestation of the great power, but he himself also speaks about the great power in the extant fragments of his book.26 In its opening27 the treatise itself is named the declaration (apophasis) of the great power (megale dynamis),2* and this shows the importance of the term.29 The concept of the 'great power' is taken from Judaism,30 where the 'great power' or the 'great glory' meant God or his manifestation. There is therefore no doubt that the word 'great' does not denote a comparison with other powers, but is an epitheton ornans of the power. When Luke speaks in connection with Simon Magus about 'the power' of God31 which is called great, he understands rightly the meaning of the word.32 The 'great power' in Jewish sources and in Simon's 24 On the theology of Simon Magus see H. Jonas: Gnosis und sp?tantiker Geist, , G?ttingen, 1964, pp. 353-358; E.

Leisegang: Die Gnosis, Stuttgart, 1955, pp. 60 104. Quotations from Simon's treatise, Apophasis, are preserved in Hippolytos, Refutatio omnium haeresium. 25 Acts 8:10, 18-24 (R.S.V.). 26 Hippolytos: Refutatio omnium haeresium, ed. P. Wendland, Leipzig, 1916, vi, 9, 4 (cf. , 9, 5); 13 (end); 18, 3. 27 Salles-Dabadie, op. cit. (above, n. 24), p. 13, n. 3. 28 Hippolytos: Refutatio, vi, 9, 4: 'This is the treatise of declaration of the voice and name from the intellectual apprehension (epinoia) of the great power, the indefinable ...' In v, 9, 5, the title is abbreviated as 'the word of declaration of the great power...' The question is if epinoia at the beginning of the secret book simply means 'intellectual apprehension' or ifit is the terminus technicus for the thought which occurs in the book and which was, according to Simon Magus, manifested in his wife Helene. 29 Hippolytos names the book Apophasis (declaration) and only once (vi, 11) does he mistakenly speak about the great declaration. 30 G. Scholem: Jewish Gnosticism, New York, 1960, pp. 67-69. 31 The word 'of God' is an unhappy interpretation by Luke (see Haenchen, below, n. 32). Also in Luke 22:69 he speaks about 'the power of God', while Matthew (22:64) and Mark (14:62) refer only to 'the power'. The phrase 'to God' in 'glory to God in highest heaven' (Luke 2:14) is also Luke's interpretation (see D. Flusser: Sanktus and Gloria, in Abraham unser Vater, Leiden, 1963, p. 149). The original meaning was that the glory dwells in highest heaven ? in Luke 19:38 we read 'peace in heaven, glory in highest heaven'. 32 So rightly E. Haenchen, Die Apostelgeschichte, G?ttingen, 1956, to Acts 8:10.</page><page sequence="7">GREAT GODDESS OF SAMARIA 19 theology can therefore be compared with the epithet 'great' of gods and goddesses33 and with the 'great Kore' of our inscription. A foreign influence on the word 'great' in the Jewish 'great power' or 'great glory' cannot be exluded. But Simon Magus was also fascinated by another sense of the term 'great power', in that he associated the Greek dynamis with the Hebrew gevurah and understood it etymologically as the 'male power'.34 In his system the great power has its partner in the female thought (epinoia). He speaks about two forces, heaven and earth35 and he writes:36 'And that one of these appears from above, and this is the great power, the mind of the whole ruling upon all male and the other is from below the great thought (epinoia megale) female procreating the all. From whence ranged in pairs opposite each other they undergo conjugal union and manifest an intermediate interval namely an incomprehensible air which has neither beginning nor end.' There is an evident similarity between this opinion and that of Macrobius' source on the pairs of male gods and female goddesses.37 In a similar passage 38 Simon Magus speaks about 'six forces', and mentions expressly Heaven and Earth, the Sun and the Moon. We have already seen the theological connection between the accla mation of Kore and the dedication to the Sol invictus from Rome. We have also pointed out the connection between the cult of Isis and Kore in Samaria and found that Isis was sometimes identified with Kore. Isis was, on her part, seen as a moon goddess. So Simon's pair of Sun and Moon fits into the spiritual world of the hiero phant from Simon's native country, Samaria, the author of our inscription. It is known that Simon Magus saw in himself the manifestation of the great power and in his wife Helene that of the cosmic thought;39 she was also identified with Selene, the moon goddess.40 33 See above, . 10. 34 The Hebrew nil in the meaning 'male' is evidently behind the name of the angel Gabriel in Luke and behind his words to the virgin Mary: 'They Holy spirit will come upon you, and the power [misi, dynamis] of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy child to be born will be called "son of God" ' (Luke 1:35). E. Norden: Die Geburt des Kindes, Leipzig, 1924, pp. 87-90, shows that in early Christianity Gabriel was already seen as identical with the Holy Spirit and the annunciation as Mary's conception. 35 Hippolytos: Refutatio, vu, 18, 1. On this and the following quotation see Leisegang, op. cit. (above, n. 24), pp. 92-94, who brings Greek pagan parallels and believes that Simon Magus was influenced by Greek mythical and philosophical cosmogony. 36 Ibid., vi, 18, 3. 37 See above, n. 22. 38 Hippolytos: Refutatio, vi, 13. 39 Ennoia, according to Justinus: Apologia, Wiesbaden, 1969, 26, 3; on him depends Irenaeus: Adversus haereses, Cambridge, 1857, i, 23, 2. Justinus was probably mistaken and meant epinoia, which is attested by Simon's own words. 40 Pseudo-Clemens: Homiliae, Berlin, 1969, , 23, 2-3; Recognitiones, Berlin, 1965, , 8, 1. We have already seen that the pair Sun and Moon occurs in Simon's own treatise. The identification of Helene with Selene was evidently also caused because of the similarity of the two names. The identi fication of Simon's Helene with Helen of Troy was invented not only because both women had the same name, but also because of the problematic character of both.</page><page sequence="8">20 D. FLUSSER As shown above, it is possible that the author of the inscription from Samaria had in mind that Helios and the great Kore are the male and the female manifestations of one god, the ruler of all. Such an idea fits Simon's theological thought, and as he probably had no inhibitions in introducing pagan deities,41 it seems that he would wholeheartedly accept such a suggestion. It is known42 that Simon's disciples adored statues of Simon in the form of Zeus and of Helene in the form of Athena.43 A consideration of Simon Magus' theology contributes to a better understanding of the religious thought of later antiquity, of which our inscription is a witness, and suggests a possible meaning for the inscription from Samaria. The manifest message of the acclamation from Samaria is clear enough ? it is one of the most important documents of the syncretistic monotheistic tendencies of later paganism. 41 See Pseudo-Clemens: Recognitiones, in, 42, 3: 'multos introducereo deos volebas'. See also Salles-Dabadie, op. cit. (above, n. 24), pp. 132-144. 42 See Hippolytos: Refutatio, vi, 20, 1-2; Irenaeus: Adversus haereses, i, 23, 4 and cf. Epiphanius: Panarion, Leipzig, 1915,1, xxi, 3, 5. 43 The first non-pagans to possess holy pictures and statues were the Gnostics. We have already heard about Simon's disciples. The Carpocratiam had pictures and statues of Christ, copies of a supposed portrait made by Pilate (Irenaeus: Adversus haereses, i, 25).</page><page sequence="9">4r4 5H IAL.M SEc.
