Top Secret Report issued to members of the Earth's Astro- nautical Commission: Eddo Broderson extracted from re-entered capsule 1600 hrs. in poly- ethylene bag. Skeleton almost dissolving. Some of his report compre- hensible. NO EVIDENT REACTION TO HIS PHYSICAL CON- DITION. Still alive in No. 22. Indications calcium decomposition occurred in Van Allen Belt. Dr. Jes Brown, the Astronautical Commission's advisor of pre-flight de-conditioning processes, reclined gazing at the tilt-tables, immersion tanks G-accelerators and beyond at the door of his laboratory, to which he would soon obtain sole right of ingress. "Obviously, the human body is less suitable to space-time flight than we had guessed," he thought, "and somewhere out in space it loses all the affect that once manifested the actual identity of the astronaut. Mm. . . perhaps the actual astronaut never left Earth at all. . ." November, 1968: A: '"Mr. Brown'" occupied. He will process himself." B: "They have all been located: 'artists, businessmen, clerics, clerks, criminals, janitors, professors, scientists', etc." March, 1969. Announcement via the mass media of the United States: For the first time since the initiation of our space program, astronautical preparation will be offered to a cross-cut of the male populace of our count- ry. This is an experimental step toward the opportunity of spaceflight for everyone, an event that will be a commonplace in the near future. Thousands will be contacted at random by personal emissaries of the Astronautical Commission. Compliance will be voluntary.</page><page sequence="2">26 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 27 Dr. Jes Brown led Bryson Smith, a young thin professor of linguistic science, past the de-conditioning devices toward a silver door which opened inward as he made a gesture with his hand. "Now, Mr. Smith, if you'll sit in that comfortable chair, I'll leave you alone a little while for historical briefing." As the door shut behind Smith, Brown activated an inflow of mild narco-psychedelic vapor into the hermetically sealed chamber, the properties of which would slow his synaptic impulses, his metabolism, and would induce a corporeal comfort. Bryson Smith found himself in the center of an elliptical room whose transluscent, pearly walls, floor, and ceiling were fraught with reflections as vague as its own, subtly curved contour. He could picture Brown as his calm voice drifted out of the tape recorders which turned smoothly on and off from various points in the room in inadvertent sequences: "Mr. Smith, I am the Flight Director. The disorientation you are about to experience will be the result of an automatic filtering device cancelling those parts of you that cannot travel. That device is my voice." STAGE ONE "I mentioned Eddo Broderson on our way here. The gruesome joke that Eddo has become outlined our multi-billion dollar mistake/" (the voice resumed from another point in the room) "Man has become an exter- nalized machine. He identifies with cars, amusement rides, G-accelerators, and space-ships in the same way he identifies with his own reflection: totally. We de-conditioned Eddo along these lines: we accustomed him to free/fall with all the gadgets you passed on your way in here, and then we sent him up in a rocket. When he returned he was metamorphosed. The fact that he reported his flight without any reflection on his physical condition threw the Commission into a shocked quandary involving considerations of re-vamping gravitational facilities in the capsule and new approaches to psycho-biologic preparations. Suddenly I realized what had happened: his body had changed in form, that was all. Eddo as a man had been only a tentative creature when we first began working with him : his transformation merely served to eliminate his capability to manifest the affect, the personality, which both he and we had mistakenly interpreted as his identity, or self. I proceeded alone to evolve a transcendental de-condi- tioning so alienated from the actual process of contemporary spaceflight that had I disclosed it, I would have been expulsed from the Commission. There were a few subsequent space-derelicts such as he: I knew that whatever had constituted their actual selves was somewhere else, lost to us, or had never existed at all." There was silence. The visual qualities of the room, the import of</page><page sequence="3">BRUCE HOLBROOK 27 Brown's confident, multi-located voice, and the precisely calculated natures of the odorless vapor were overwhelming Bryson Smith in a subtle combination of effects and suggestions. He felt himself drifting around the room despite the sensation of his buttocks pressed on the seat of the anchored, central chair. . . "This is not hypnosis. Mr. Smith. Your present condition is merely the initiation of self-remembrance on your part encouraged by my voice. That voice has always been as independent of me as these tapes are: they speak autonomously. . . Yes, my independent, autonomous voice : the voice of anybody : you - ANY BODY." "How long have I been here," wondered Smith, "I really can't tell. . . ""I have allowed you to move in space and you immediately respond by thinking, with your voice , of time," resumed Brown's voice, "You have lived in a universe of space and/time: space and time are inexorable anthropomorphic concepts, or interpretations, on the part of your three-dimensional, time-crawling body. The nature of your body is likewise a concept, or projection, of a four-dimensional universe. I have moved you spacially: your past has become vague, equivocal: you are out of time. Man and his universe are functions of each other; space and time are functions of each other. Your present condition is a paradox: as a picture-thought, it is elliptical as this room: you are simultaneously fixed in space corporeally, yet moving. . . "Mr. Smith, this is the first stage of the flight." As Smith looked down at it, his body seemed somehow removed from his conscious in time and distance: he raised his hand and dreamed past it toward the wall's mists, and suddenly imagined his body looking at itself with the aspect of an ape inspecting its dank forearm coils for ticks, or the body of metamorphosed Eddo curling in front of itself in mock amoebic narcissism. Bestial, autono- mous, the hand raised before its eyes again, somehow apart from the Smith who watched this. Words flashed into his conscious, hot and urgent a$ though having encountered impedance in the immediate past : "Am I leaving my body? But - as he said - voice: these are the words of my autono- mous voice. God! That's clear: the words are talking about themselves ! 'Am I leaving my body ?' : 'autonomous voice.' Yes, they seem to belong to my body - my body ? - not to. . . me ! Voice : shut up - " The tapes resumed : "Another paradox, Mr. Smith: in your present condition verbal thinking, vocal thinking, is an irrelevant process, redundant, ridiculous. You are leaving your body and its words; yet you allow vocal thinking, extenuating the paradoxical condition. It will become annoying, confusing, perhaps uncomfortable, unless you make a decision. Words bind you in it: I suggest you decide silently. Before you is a panel of colored tabs ; each tab is another place, another planet./ Obviously, you are here to go."</page><page sequence="4">28 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 27 STAGE TWO In a flash of comprehension, Bryson Smith touched a tab and perceived his shrinking body at the point of a long black cone - or was it at the intersection of great dark chrystalline facets, sparkling with galaxies ? - no : that was the planet Earth out there, not his body. He was musing in pictures, silently wondering to himself: what he saw was silently speaking through his visual conscious. Then there was an interruption of tentative mutterings which grew audible, then lingual. Subsequently Smith found himself in a strange yet acceptable landscape. "I forgot something out there," he thought, "and then - " He looked around him, but this vision was im- mediately erased by a high, piercing scream that raged through a tropical forest towering into a pewter sky shimmering at two hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The scream was his. A nameless simian, Bryson Smith incarnate, stared up at his gorilla-like mother, who grunted and shuddered from the birth she had just given - on the planet Venus. Six years older, he was swinging through the upper terraces with his sister. They crouched, and with swift, automatic movements he peeled off the thin resilient skin of a fruit, jerking his head around in response to the odors and sounds lacing the jungle world of mile-high stalks branching to turgid leaves the size of Indian war canoes. His rapidly blinking eyes absorbed only a grey impression of the panorama of rose dusk and rapidly sailing mauve clouds above the trees. Suddenly there came a whirring sound strange to them, and his sister vaulted onto his back mewling with fear as the sky was pierced by a glowing disklike object swiftly descending toward them. The noise became intolerable as he climbed hysterically away through the foliage, swinging and leaping, and dropped onto the middle terrace, skipping on all fours over its tightly interlaced branches into the shadows. The Saucer swooped in pusuit and pounced. Seconds later it deposited the two apes on an alien planet, in the depths of a verdant, tropical zone that would moult eons later to become the Gobi Desert. Bryson Smith, the son of a man and spawn of a Venusian ape, shuddered, chattering into the sweltering nights of planet Earth. "Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith - " he felt an instant of sickening inertia and plunged forward through the base of an almost infinite black cone toward a point light years distant. The point opened to a grey light which expanded to envelope him in the focusing pearly room. His heart sent an initial pulse that drummed its presence and his presence in Bryson Smith's twen- tieth century body with swift effect. "Mr. Smith, let's continue your flight without waiting until you become once more identified in the past that once brought you here for historical briefing. You may utilize a few seconds to realize what has happened, since the form you just left deprives you of</page><page sequence="5">BRUCE HOLBROOK 29 capacities which the form you now occupy requires in order to record according to our purpose - here." Smith's thin body poised like a sculling hawk's wing on the edge of the chair as the implications of the immediately preceding experiences flashed in his mind as image and thought. He felt both a compulsion to stay and evaluate and a compulsion to once again depart. The latter of the two curiosity-motivations was re-enforced by a feeling that he might lose the capacity of the silent flash that had allowed him to select the tab of departure. . . "Let's continue , Mr. Smith. Here is a poem I know that tends to dissolve present conditions: I originally com- posed it in response to a realization of the ridicule of the illusionary existence obtaining on planet Earth; it portrays an interplay between the two parts of Bryson Smith with which we have been working: 'THAT' - your corporeal self, and 'WHICH' - you: I am that which opposes That which opposes I am Opposes I am that which Am that which opposes I Which opposes I am that; That which am opposes I Which am opposes I that Am opposes I that which Opposes I that which am I that which am opposes." Sometime during the last stanza, Bryson Smith knew his body was leaning autonomously forward selecting a tab, and he leaped through a shard of blackness in the depths of which loomed clouds of ethereal light. Subsequently Smith found himself overwhelmed by an intense hum- ming: it was around him and in him, producing thousands of different sensations in a rush of microsecond alternations. Infinitely varied pains and pleasures surged through him in multicolored waves like oil sprayed in sunlight. Soon he was aware of the sensations only as skinned flesh would be aware of a barrage of salt: he was the sensations. Outside him the land was like a drumskin stretched under a white-hot sky. Numerous crystalline growths of an amber hue rose to a height of thirty feet or so, a substance of sand and sunlight, and the rays refracting in their complex interstices created brilliant, interlocking haloes fraught with flickering odors. He was a virus dissimilar in chemical structure to those of twentieth century Earth, patterned like flames which whirled involuted upon them- selves, switching hues in desperate deliberation. Suddenly it locked in a polarized pattern like English tweed, in response to the appraoch of a</page><page sequence="6">30 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 27 brittle wormlike creature unaware of the virus' presence in the corpse of of one of its brethren. Soon it was able to invade the living creature, anchoring its flaming body in its brittle fabric to set about the automatic and inexorable process of self-replication which would perpetuate its existence at the expense of the host. The gleaming, infected creature squirmed with chrystalline logic toward the faintly shadowed shelter of a nearby amber growth, eliminating a topaz stain of agony as hard as diamond. Before it reached its goal in the cooler area it stopped, hooking to touch its extremities, and ceased to live. Its journey of heatlike torment endured five hundred thousand Earth years, by which time the planet had revolved one hundred and eighty degrees. The tiny corpse shimmered in a sudden alien light in the metal-dry total night of the planet Mercury. The virus inside it was itself expiring, since it had annihilated its last source of life on the globe, when the glowing Saucer landed and engulfed it. It pulsed, greying, anchored in a strange pulp under an envelope of fruit skin; the simian mouth that gulped the banana seconds later saved its life. The infant of that primal ape was human: it was practically devoid of hair, and saw and thought in multi-colored pictographs, interpreting its environment with re-qualified perceptions, sensations, and emotions. As centuries passed, tribes of that first mutant's progeny left the apes and migrated separately to other regions. Bryson Smith was among a tribe of darkskinned Mongoloids with deep high brows, stirring the damp soil with prehensile toes. His supple muscles shuddered with pleasure in un- charted winds. The tribe chirped, grunted, wailed, hummed, and whistled, conjuring pictographs in each other's consciouses. "Mr. Smith. . He was paralyzed in a cone of melting ice, watching fading astronomical charts etched in its dissolving periphery. . . then the room materialized as Brown's voice penetrated. Smith felt his Terran hands clutched to his face, and propped them into his lap. This time his recall was more swift than his last: "I have been on three planets during millions of years - I - man. . .is a virus-mutated ape ! - but how could - and where did the Saucers come from?" STAGE THREE The tapes resumed: "Child of Venus and Mercury, it is not necessary to con/fuse yourself. Your motivation for agreeing to come here was curio- sity: you were a form of motivation coming here as curiosity. You have always been a form coming here to go : 'that-which' selected the tabs of departure : you were insured of going where you wanted to since the question, the 'which' behind your curiosity, chose, here, when it was allowed to do so.</page><page sequence="7">BRUCE HOLBROOK 31 Past present and future are symbolic (word) inter-functions on the part of your Terran corporeal identity. You went into the future relative to here, in the room; you went into the past relative to the race of man. Here you are winning the race/and here lam winnowing the race . To depart you had to remember what you are not and never have been. I helped you to real-ize this by confounding the ties that bind you - 'which' : those ties are words, which you must now know are a virus that has itself mutated since its advent on Earth: the ties that bind 'which' to 'that' - the body. In this case your body, and your universe of perception and cognition: the body inherited many times over from a diseased Venusian ape. To return you also had to remember what you are not : words, my voice or any voice speaking incarnating words in your tongue, such as: 'Mr. Smith.' The word-virus made man from ape, distinguishes man from ape : human interp- retation of pains aûd pleasures, the perception of color, image and word-thoughts, the conception of a four-dimensional universe. The body holds you in this uni-verse with its inherent animal interests in the pleasures and sometimes pains that the virus conjures up for it with pictures and words. Hieroglyphs are word-pictures that the first men drew in an attempt to exorcise the painful virus itself. I dissolved the ties by talking to you in contexts and series along the lines of which verbal thoughts cannot organize : you were thereby allowed to free your self from it : your non-verbal 'which' from 'that'./ "I suppose you have understood by now that the tabs you touched are connected to nothing but your non-terran SELF ." "Who are you?!" cried Bryson Smith, "WHAT AM /?" The great, timed reels of the tape recorders, created especially for Bryson Smith as were others for those to follow him, stopped. As Bryson Smith's last question dissolved in sound waves along the walls, his body suddenly relaxed and smiled. Shortly he would be led out of the room by Doctor Brown, classified as "unsuitable to the psycho-biologic stresses of spaceflight." He would continue his Earthly existence until natural death. March, 1969. Communications between the Saucer people: B: "My occupation of 'Dr. Jesu Brown' only endured the period necessary to his material preparations for processing: alterations of certain machines, his laboratory; completion of the tapes, including his; a non- Terran synthesis of certain Terran chemicals. When the last prisoner is freed, he will process himself: 'Dr. Brown' is in a state of 'hypnosis.' We have retained our otherwise useless power of matter-energy conversion in order to free prisoners, such as you, 'Mr. Smith.' Your 'crime' was for. getting our SELF, thereby creating a breach in our existence. Hence the</page><page sequence="8">32 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 27 existence of some of us as men on Earth, our penal colony; and our obliga- tion to remain familiar with present Terran means, as they change in Terran 'time,* catalytic to the release of prisoners. When pain of existence as a 'man' has nearly annihilated the prisoner, we release him. 'Man,' our creation, will soon no longer serve as a prison, since his inexorable approach to matter-energy conversion is directed by his pain to be used for his own conversion into what he calls 'death.' Thus at this epoch we must release all our prisoners presently Terran, since 'man's' conversion via nuclear blasts will affect them so that they will no longer be recoverable : in our penal state, we are vulnerable to this conversion." A: "We will use the 'Saucer' as a guide toward 'home', 'Mr. Smith', until you have completely become your SELF again."
