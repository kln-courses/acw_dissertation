<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIFE AND NATURAL TOTALITY IN NIETZSCHE Michel Haar 'Chaos sive nature'1 Is Nietzsche a modern Stoic? There are numerous indications of an ambivalent attitude towards the Stoics in Nietzsche, an approval and a rejection, both so vigorous that it may be described with the expression, 'Stoicism in reverse'. Indicating approval, we have texts such as: 'Let us remain hard, we the last Stoics'2 and The doctrine of the 'eternal recurrence', that is, of the unconditional and infinitely repeated circular course of all things - this doctrine of Zarathustra might in the end have already been taught by Heraclitus. At least the Stoa has traces of it, and the Stoics inherited almost all of their principal notions from Heraclitus.3 Stoicism, again, is mentioned as an example of ...the essential and invaluable element in every morality, namely, that it is a protracted restraint.4 In spite of their illusory belief in the moral order of the world, the Stoics understood the necessity of self-tyranny inherent in the Will to Power; they understood that 'nature' and the 'natural' consist in the 'tyranny of such arbitrary laws' and 'not in laisser aller I.* And yet, in the same way as Nietzsche occasional, y alludes to the overcoming of Christianity by 'Hyperchristianity', he also affirms the need to become somehow a 'Hyperstoic', i.e. to possess at the same time hardness and softness: For it is nothing to be as hard as a Stoic; by dint of 67</page><page sequence="2">insensibility, one has detached oneself from everything. One must have the opposite in oneself - a tender sensibility and the opposite capacity not to lose one's cool, but of being able with plasticity to 'make the best' of any misfortune.* Everything depends for Nietzsche on the magnitude of the force that carries the approval. In Stoicism, there was such a great force that Seneca, who dared to say 'Deus nudus est' might well have [thereby] shaken off his own moral straight-jacket. For Nietzsche, of course, the rejection of Stoics was absolutely radical. For him the stoic sage is a caricature, a 'barbaric exaggeration',7 one whose mistrust and hatred of pleasure allow us to have serious doubts about his professed love for a life and world with which he wants to fuse. By dint of this repudiation and dismissal of the passions and pleasures, the Stoic sage gains access to total insensibility and to self-petrifaction. And the god he embraces, says Nietzsche, is itself a mere statue! What does it mean to kiss a statue in the winter, since one has then become insensitive to the cold?* The Stoic does not love the world; in his claim of a fatum, he asserts nothing more than a series of abstractions: order, goodness, beauty, reason, providence. He does nothing but indulge his love of himself, and of his own coldness and reasonings The ideal of amor fatl, of universal approval, of individual existence fusing with the totality, can be meaningful according to Nietzsche only if this totality has been stripped of its 'moral', i.e., anthropomorphic, attributes. This does not mean that the world should be reduced to life, and granted the character of living being. On the contrary, the Stoic idea that 68</page><page sequence="3">the world is a great living being, the Great Living [One] must be forcefully rejected. Two reasons are given to support this claim. First, the 'presupposition that everything is organic contradicts the essence of the organic'.* An organism needs an element exterior to itself in order to sustain itself and upon which to feed, for it would be absurd if it grew by feeding upon itself. Where, and in what direction would it grow, if it is already everything? Second, an organic totality would necessarily be guided, as the Stoics require, by a universal logos, a divine reason or soul. Thus a biological representation of nature would supply 'perhaps the ultimate form of the representation of God'-10 Seneca said in one of his Epistlesf Quid allus est natura quam deus? (What else is nature if not God?). But then, what is the world if it is not God either? 'The world is absolutely not an organism, it is Chaos'. The rejection of the organicity of the world, and the affirmation of 'chaos' as defining the very life of the Totality, raise several questions, all of which are metaphysical insofar as they ask after the ultimate being of this totality. Such metaphysical questions include: How can one think a totality without a unity? How can the totality be a living - yet not organic - being? What does the concept of 'necessity' mean, when, for Nietzsche, it is the only one that can be applied without anthropomorphism to chaos, to nature, or to the world (these last two terms not being really distinguished in his lexicon)? Let us quote an essential passage: The total character of the world, however, is in all eternity chaos - in the sense not of a lack of 69</page><page sequence="4">necessity but because of a lack of order, arrangement, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms.11 Is the concept of chaos then merely a preventive concept, one forbidding us from essentialising, eternalising, and deifying nature? 'Chaos sive nature', says Nietzsche. Yet is it not precisely the eternalisation of the world which the experience of the Eternal Return is bound to produce: Haec est vita sempiterna tua? The divinity of the whole seems in no way excluded by the concept of chaos, since it reappears both in the invocation to Dionysus and in the enigmatic formula circulus vitiosus deus. What credence, then, should we lend to Nietzsche's injunctions that, 'One must rehabilitate nature, not deify it', or else 'My task: to dehumanise nature and then naturalise man after he has acquired the pure concept of "nature1"." What can 'pure nature' mean for a philosopher who demonstrates that all our feelings of nature - to say nothing of our concepts - are entirely acquired, entirely 'inherited', i.e., never immediate or spontaneous? What would an idea of nature be that was no longer human? Isn't this idea humanised at the outset from the fact that it is a human thought? Isn't the negation of anthropomorphism still a human operation (une humanisation)? We shall see that Nietzsche attempts to capture the concept of 'pure nature', by operating a relativisation of the living in the face of the inorganic, and by proposing an insistent definition of life as immorality. 70</page><page sequence="5">Yet how will the Nietzschean philosophy of nature avoid restoring theology, albeit it under the double characteristics of a negative theology, with the concept of chaos, and of a theodicy, with the concept of a necessity pertaining to imperfection itself? Beyond this inexorable outcome (the destiny inherent in the internal logic of metaphysics), might there not be in Nietzsche an ontology of nature that is not already a theology? I Life is not the totality, nor the good, nor the evil, but a logic of the impulses, which is the origin of every conscious logic. There is no unconditional exaltation of life to be found in Nietzsche. Life is neither a totality, nor an object of the highest affirmation. True, the Will to Power is thought, along the model of life, as the faculty of self-conservation and expansion, the exercise of the perspectivalism of one's forces. But 'life is only one instance of the Will to Power'. The domain of the latter extends far beyond the realm of living beings. It is Nature as a whole which is Will to Power. Hence, there is a rehabilitation of inorganic nature in the face of life. Every body, every atom extends its force and its action as far as it can. 'Every drive is a kind of lust to rule'.13 Nature as a whole is neutral not only toward Good and Evil, but also toward life and death. In any case, it is not by a necessity of essence that it sides with life. There is in nature no partiality toward what is alive, or against what is dead. If something does not manage to maintain itself in life, no goal is missed as a result! The character of 'finality' is accidental, human...14 Thus life is not the ultimate end of nature; for 'The living is 71</page><page sequence="6">merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type'.15 Nature is indeed dehumanised, but at an exorbitant cost, since the superior unity, of which the living is a mere genus, must be one devoid of life! This view seems therefore to entail the preponderance, even the superiority, of the organic world. This superiority is paradoxical, since it arises from elementary nature itself striving, acting, perceiving, and even 'thinking', i.e., producing shapes: 'Thinking' in primitive conditions (pre-organic) is the crystallization of forms as in the case of crystals.x* Apparently, Nietzsche grants even greater clarity to the action and thought he assigns to inanimate nature than those of life, which is essentially subjected to illusion and 'error'. To be admitted: there are perceptions in the inorganic world, and perceptions of absolute exactness, wherein 'truth' reigns I With the organic world, imprecision and appearance begin.17 The move from the inorganic to the organic realm is a move from what is clear and certain to what is obscure and indefinite. As compared with a chemical substance, a protoplasm, says Nietzsche, 'has only an uncertain and vague perception'1* of the forms exterior to it, precisely because they are legion. It is the uncertainty of life - its need to grope and err - that finally accounts for its power. Life is forced to invent cunning, as it finds itself faced with multiplicity - its own and that of external forces. It must first and foremost create simplifications behind which to hide. 72</page><page sequence="7">It [dissimulation] seems to be lacking in the inorganic world - power against power, quite crudely - cunning begins in the organic world...x* Cunning is spontaneous illusion, and does not result from a prior calculation. A living being can only present itself as different than it is. It is bound to deceive, inasmuch as it deceives itself, i.e., essentially confines itself to its own limited perspective. To live entails for the living the act of extracting from the world what is necessary for its conservation and growth, and of abandoning the rest. To live entails accepting or rejecting, and hence abstracting. Nietzsche conceives interpretation - the faculty to choose unilaterally according to one's point of view - as the essence of life: The organic process constantly presupposes interpretations.20 In conformity with the logic of Platonism, he calls the vital principle itself illusion, error, because it is unable to seek a truth other than perspectivalist. Hence the formula: 'Error, mother of the living.'21 Life plays cunningly with the inorganic, as it plays cunningly also with its environment, and with itself. It can neither entirely dominate nor dissolve the absolute force of the non living. It can only feign giving way to it. Consequently, an always unstable equilibrium of forces comes to pass. The link between the organic realm and nature is a link of reciprocal domination, amounting precisely to the reciprocal domination and infinite intricateness of truth and error! If one accepts the definition of life in terms of error, it seems 73</page><page sequence="8">at first quite surprising that Nietzsche should associate the notion of Immorality with all the definitions he gives of the organic. 'Life rests on immoral presuppositions'. Why such presuppositions? Mhat meaning do they have? With them, Nietzsche aims at a reversal not only of the optimistic naturalism of the Enlightenment, or of the Rousseauean myth of the original goodness of nature, but also of the Stoic idea of the essence - both divine and moral - of nature. He also wants to dismiss finalistic (views), Providence, and whatever theodicy. But doesn't anthropomorphism - even inverted - remain just that? Saying that life is the contrary of the Good in the sense of virtue, and the perfect antithesis to Stoicism, inevitably leads to the same conclusions: it is necessary, it is good, that things be that way! among the negative attributes that predominate in qualifying life, are injustice, lie, exploitation* The inversion concerning the term 'injustice' re-establishes the most transparent affirmation. Absolute justice (unbedingte Gerechtigheit) is what leads to the idea that life is essentially unjust.M 'Injustice' - which affects the very essence of life - cannot be unjust. It is only unjust in the eyes of those who ignore its fundamental perspectivalism. But let us quickly examine one after the other the three negative attributes. They appear in a fragment of The Will to Power: In great men, the specific qualities of life - injustice, falsehood, exploitation - are at their greatest.23 According to what has just been said/ the sense of injustice is apparently more metaphysical than moral. It is possible also to 74</page><page sequence="9">detect in it the inversion of Plato's dikaiosune. Still, the injustice and violence [inherent in] the Nietzschean definitions can hardly be mitigated by - or reduced to - a pure ontology devoid of ethical consequences, as Heidegger seemed inclined to think. Let us quote four texts, which Heidegger himself never quoted: Life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, overpowering of the strange and the weaker, suppression, severity, imposition of one's own forms, incorporation and, at least and mildest, exploitation.. .24 Doesn't living mean evaluating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different?25 Life operates essentially, that is, in its basic functions, through injury, assault, exploitation, destruction, and simply cannot be thought of at all without this character... From the highest biological standpoint, legal conditions can never be other than exceptional conditions.26 One would ruin the source of life if one wanted to abolish whatever was in some respect harmful or destructive.27 The ambiguity of these texts, as well as of all the so-called 'immoralistic' propositions made by Nietzsche, is twofold. On the one hand, they address life simultaneously as an organic process (Nietzsche talks about living cells, metabolism, nutrition, secretions, and excretions), and as the social existence of man (right). On the other hand, they have a meaning that is ontological, descriptive, and practically phenomenological, and also a normative and prescriptive meaning. Thus Nietzsche says that 'the strong and free man acts in the same way as an organism':2" the latter assimilates and rejects by using cunning, praise and blame, 'enslavement to somebody else', i.e., submission. The organic realm becomes a model. 75</page><page sequence="10">This shows that immorality is inverted moralism. Nietzsche does not make a claim for injustice in the absolute sense, but insists that what traditional morality calls injustice is just. Justice, as the 'Supreme representative of life itself, is nothing but the essence of every estimation, of every position of value. Since 'justice' has thus become, as Heidegger stressed, the name for truth, conceived as the correspondence between life and the values it affirms, then rigorously speaking, nothing can be characterised as unjust. Characterising life as unjust would amount to an operation of rhetoric and sophistry. The same discrepancy applies to the negative attributes of lie and exploitation. Life is a lie inasmuch as it is appearance, dissimulation, endless mask-donning. In order to live, one must necessarily believe' in fictions, in surface phenomena (effets de surface). By the expression of a living lie, Nietzsche understands the fiction produced by the artistic will-to-Power, which is itself a power of nature. This ability itself, thanks to which he violates reality by means of lies, this artistic ability of man par excellence, he has in common with everything that is. He himself is after all a piece of reality, truth, nature: how should he not also be a piece of genius In lying?*9 In other words, in order to be part of the truth, one must take part in lying. In sound logic, this means that the lie is an essential attribute of the truth. Hence, when Nietzsche says that 'life is a lie', he means to say that life is, in this way, the truest of truths. On closer inspection, the term exploitation expressly refers to 76</page><page sequence="11">the Will-to-Power: every stronger sphere dominates, assimilates, or shapes a weaker sphere. This applies to nutrition as well as to social relations. 'Exploitation' does not pertain to a corrupt or imperfect or primitive society: it belongs to the essence of living things as a fundamental organic function, a consequence of the will to power...30 Here too, the immoralism postulated and displayed (affiche) dwindles and vanishes, while making room for a levelling and indifference to the essence of the phenomena. Yet is it not nihilism to equate the relations between rulers and ruled to the process of digestion? The inversion of metaphysics that leads to asserting that everything is natural, raises the unpleasant - even despairing - question of the absence of any hierarchy in pure nature. Nietzsche never found the true hierarchy, neither in the herd, nor in the Overman, who by essence is isolated, uncommunicative, and as incommensurable as a 'splendid solar system'. If the negative definition of life is constantly destabilised by the anti-Platonic struggle it entails, may not the true originality of Nietzsche be found in the positive definition of life as creative power, as the capacity of the instincts and impulses to bring about a shape? Here too, unfortunately, the consequences of the inversion, not only of Plato but also of Hegel, constantly weigh upon the phenomenology of the living being. Nietzsche's greatest intuition consists in grasping life as a faculty of incorporation, (Einverleibung). In this sense, the fundamental faculty of the living being is nutrition, so much so that Nietzsche writes: 77</page><page sequence="12">What we call 'life' is a plurality of forces, linked together by the phenomenon of nutrition that is common to them.31 In order to accomplish nutrition, the organic being must be capable of sensibility, appetite, but also of evaluation, choice, assimilation, and elimination; hence, says Nietzsche, it must be capable of thought. 'Every organism thinks', i.e., orders, condenses, establishes a hierarchy in beings: 'Every organic being acts as an artist'.32 The phenomenon of incorporation, whose form is most obvious in nutrition, not only presupposes the presence of interpretation and selection, but also of memory. The organism never forgets anything. It incorporates not only the foreign element, the inorganic, but the [non-foreign], the ownmost, in the sense that it integrates and coordinates its [own] experiences. It incorporates, finally, the totality of organic life that continues to press within it: We must revise our idea of memory. It consists in the mass of all the experiences from the entire organic life, living experiences that order themselves, that shape themselves by reciprocal action (the ones struggling against the others), that simplify, summarise, and transform the facts into numerous units. Necessarily, this entails an internal process analogous to what happens when, from numerous isolated cases, one draws a concept;...the feelings of inclination, repulsion, etc. are symptoms of an already formed inclination; our 'impulses', as they are called, are such formations. Thoughts are what is most superficial.33 It is in texts of this kind that the inversion takes place. Here, the living body with its absolute memory has taken the place of the absolute spirit. For conscious thought is not merely a symptom of life; life is the spirit itself. 'The logical element is the drive itself (Trieb)'34, or elsewhere: 'what is commonly attributed to the spirit, so it seems to me, 78</page><page sequence="13">composes the essence of organic life'.35 'The logic of our conscious thought is nothing but a crude and simplified form of that thought, which our organism, and even more each of its organs, needs.' Distinctions, nuances, the sense of haste, of concurrence, and of progression - intuited by our bodies - are much more refined than, much superior to, a mere category such as causality, which is available to our intellects. The extraordinary refinement of organic thought is capable of apprehending endless fluctuations in a [flux of] becoming, without fixating [the process] under rigid forms and arbitrary identities. Here we may think of examples, such as the descriptions that Nietzsche makes of the manifold relationships obtaining between consciousness and body. Consciousness is a simple organ, a very partial [ - in both senses of the word - ] instrument that is kept separate from the overall processes occurring within the body. Consciousness has the illusion of ruling, of deciding, but it does not govern. It is the instrument that executes choices and decisions that have already been made in our depths. Everything that emerges to consciousness is the reflection of a temporary equilibrium in the interplay of the impulses. What makes the decision concerning this equilibrium? The 'great reason' which is the body, namely, the organic thought that never stops computing the subtle and spontaneous estimates of relations between guanta of force. Life is incarnate logic, which combines the totality of its forces for the best, that is, according to the greatest advantage for its conservation and enhancement. This view is very Leibnizian. Dum 79</page><page sequence="14">vita calculat, fit mundus (While life calculates, the world comes into being), Nietzsche could have said. Such a point justifies the idea that he was the precursor of technology as universal instrumentalisation - where each impulse becomes an organ - and integral computability. Yet, isn't there a flaw in this Nietzschean system of life? For Nietzsche grants to himself - in the way that Schopenhauer and the Romantics did - the intellectual intuition of this organic thought, to which we can, however, gain no direct access, and about which, rigorously speaking, we should know nothing, because everything comes as the result of the deforming and superficial handling of consciousness and language, and is nothing but a falsified, or infinitely diluted, image. 'Great reason', rigorously speaking, is ineffable. Since the elementary and subtle phenomena of life are inaccessible to our crude thinking, isn't the superior thinking attributed to it, if not a perfect fiction, at least a mere hypothesis? From this derives the importance of the concept of chaos. Isn't the chaos some sort of indispensable correction to the hyper rationalism of the Will-to-Power facing it? Isn't it the somewhat regulative idea that preserves the enigma of the world, in the face of the extreme requirements of an inverted - but nonetheless unrestrained - rationalism? 80</page><page sequence="15">II As soon as the chaos of the totality is affirmed absolutely, it becomes divine necessity. The eternal return may be viewed as a new theodicy. But what is chaos? Is it not a name to designate the superabundance of the forces of becoming, that are too rich or too diverse to be limited to life? 'Universal chaos' means that the totality is not subjected to the logic of the living, to 'great reason'. That such a chaotic totality forms nevertheless one single world, 'the world of the Will-to-Power and none other...', is undeniably a radically metaphysical presupposition, one absolutely undemonstrable. Likewise, the [notion of a] finitude of forces, 'whose totality is an invariable quantum', strictly and eternally confined within limits, is another presupposition that admits of no possible proof, but only of the affirmation - actually, the self-affirmation - of the world itself. This view is articulated in an admirable text in which Nietzsche describes this world as the divine, since its name is Dionysus. Let us quote the text, which, at the outset, provides the answer to the question, 'Whence comes the unity of the totality of chaos?' It comes from the affirmation of the eternal return by itself, in which chaos is gathered, contained without being suppressed or surmounted. And do you know what 'the world' is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end; a firm, iron magnitude of force, that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expand itself, but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income; enclosed by 'nothingness' as by a boundary; not something blurry or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that might be 'empty' here or there, but rather as a force throughout, as a play of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time 81</page><page sequence="16">decreasing there; a sea of forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flow of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the silliest, most rigid, coldest forms toward the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness.3* This world, insists Nietzsche, is 'without goal* unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal, without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself'.37 Only the circle of the Eternal Return 'saves' chaos from non-sense, and conversely chaos saves the world from the trap of rational and moral finality. 'The chaos of the whole, as exclusionary of any teleological activity, does not contradict the thought of a circular ring; the latter is indeed an Irrational necessity, flying in the fact of any formal or aesthetic consideration'.3* There is, therefore, a negative concept of chaos and a positive one. Negatively, chaos has the preventive role of holding at bay two possibilities: the ancient representation of a great cosmic living being, and the various optimistic themes of the order, beauty, and finality of the world. Positively, chaos aims at designating all the raw forces of nature, animate or inanimate, taken in themselves, as they lend themselves to the schematizing action of the Will-to-Power. When Nietzsche says: 'The Will-to Power is the schematization of chaos', he implies that the chaos 'survives' this imposition of an order or of forms. Chaos is the zero degree of Being that eternally changes forms, not because 82</page><page sequence="17">of entropy (Nietzsche rejects it) , but so as to be able to engage in a new cycle, by moving through nihilism (chaos would then be the 'natural' name for nihilism). Since this imposition of forms upon forces is not a process that occurs from the outside, but, instead, the imposing of a seif-hierarchy, chaos is in effect the bottom, the base, or the primary material of the Will-to-Power. Since the Will-to-Power is always hyle-morphic, chaos must be its hyletic component. Heidegger devotes many pages to the interpretation of this concept and quite appropriately stresses that for Nietzsche chaos means metaphysically a specific relationship between multiplicity and unity: never will the multiple reach unity, never will becoming reach a stable state, Being: 'Chaos is a multiplicity originarily exclusive of any unity and any form'.3* But he equates (reconduit) chaos, arbitrarily it seems, to the impulsive essence of life in the process of organization, taxing chaos to be the apparently ungovernable vital flux, that always 'aspires to constancy'.40 It is remarkable to observe the extent of Heidegger's efforts to reduce by all means possible the chaotic within the concept of chaos, and to rationalize it. First, at the level of the very essence of the impulse. The latter, says Heidegger, would be diluted and would destroy itself if it did not find within its self the force to stabilize itself. There is in the essence of the impulse the necessity to resist itself, to hold firm against the impulsive rush in order not to tumble and disappear under its own irresistible thrust. The impulse rests upon itself, and, in this fashion, surmounts its chaotic impetus. 83</page><page sequence="18">The three interpretations of chaos that Heidegger gives are all highly positive. First, he associates chaos with a thought of physis and aletheia. Chaos is pure nature in the sense that the latter is pure openness. Etymologically, chaos means the fissure, the crack, and the abyss that widens. The concept of chaos, inasmuch as it refers to an original upsurge and to the spontaneous development of the totality, seems essentially directed against the concept of creation by a personal god, be he Greek or biblical. The great living one of the Timaeus presupposes the demiurge. This termination of the deification (de-divinisation) of nature must not be crudely reduced to materialism, or hylezoism, and to atheism. Heidegger writes: Metaphysical thought anticipates a way along the extreme denial of deity, a way without phoney escape. ..a way that would be the only one - if that were ever possible in the history of humankind - where the gods come to their encounter.41 What is at issue is not exactly a projection upon Nietzsche of the Heideggerian expectation. Think of the famous sentence: 'How many new gods are still possible!'. Such a possibility is undoubtedly connected to the new relation between multiplicity and unity. From there the second interpretation follows. It is located in the extension of this guest for the deity. The thought of chaos conceives that nothing can be said concerning the supreme being, the world, or the totality. This arreton, this unspeakable, constitutes a sort of 'negative theology', essentially because it denies any human attributes to the totality. 84</page><page sequence="19">The third interpretation presents such a distortion or so crude a denial of the incontrovertible Nietzschean doctrine - which states that 'the world is in no way an organism, but chaos42 - that at first the reader is perplexed. For Heidegger identifies world, chaos, and living organism: Chaos is the name of incorporating (corporante) life, of life as a great living body... Chaos is the name of a particular antecedent project, relative to the world in its totality. This project represents the world as a living body extended so to speak to gigantic dimensions. In it the fundamental experience of the world as chaos is rooted. The world as chaos means beings in their totality projected relatively to the image of the body and of incorporating (corporer).43 Such a blunder can be nothing but intentional- It reveals the unease which this concept produced in Heidegger, and the fact that it is difficult for him to renounce the metaphysical notion of order immanent in the totality. Heidegger repeats that one must not conceive of chaos as confusion, disorder in itself, upon which order would be applied from the outside, but as this 'element of impulse, flux, and movement, whose order is hidden, whose law is not immediately known to us'.44 What is this hidden order, this law, if not precisely the order and the law of the Will-to-Power? Heidegger suggests erroneously that the Will-to-Power reveals, or contains, the intrinsic, definitive, and absolute order and law of the world, when in fact it is not a unique essence. (Nietzsche says that there are always several partial Wills-to-Power) and when in fact it only brings out - here and there, and provisionally - a single order, a single law, which stand as islands of meaning bound to disappear later on. 85</page><page sequence="20">The belief that nature follows rules, as would ideal citizens, or civil servants, is anthropomorphic. In no way can it be compared to the secret order of the world! Instead, there are temporary and local orderings, i.e., a hierarchical settling of forces but, overall, chaos returns and dominates. If chaos is a necessary attribute of the natural totality, the reason is precisely to save it from 'universal order in itself. But if nature is this mass of forces without unity, form, and identity (for circular movement is none of these), what could the insistent Nietzschean theme of chaotic nature - in need of being retrieved, 'reestablished', and 'rehabilitated' - possibly mean? Chaotic nature seems unable to offer a model to imitate. However, first of all, [there are the requirements of] the imitation of the cycle: [they urge us] to become cyclical beings, to identify with existence, to be capable of experiencing several contrary points of view, several opposite philosophies, to view health from the perspective of sickness, and vice versa. Next, the absence of a moral order of nature must lead us to rehabilitate 'physiology'. At issue is the possibility of progressing in the acceptance of instincts that are devoid of rationalization, or of sentimental idealization, or of what Nietzsche calls 'naked nature'. 'A period when the old masquerade and moral decking-up of the affects arouses antipathy: naked nature.'4S Nietzsche is far from taking a radical stance against the naturalism of the 19th century. He wants to liberate it from the naive scientific positivism and its oppressive uncouthness (lourdeur animale). There are signs that the European of the nineteenth century is less ashamed of his instincts; he has taken 86</page><page sequence="21">a goodly step toward admitting to himself his unconditional naturalness, without becoming embittered.4* Naked nature - the expression means nature considered without judgment, without goodness or evil. Immorality, here, means in fact morality. Why do we feel at ease in the middle of nature - a forest or a mountain? The reason is not that it presents us with the image of goodness itself as Rousseau believed, or that air is healthier to breathe; the reason is that 'free nature has no opinion about us'.47 'To return man to nature' amounts to exhibiting a 'primitive text', devoid of grotesque interpretations. But what does this 'primitive text' say? What do we learn from 'naked nature' that, for us, is no longer a model of virtue, that is neither innocent nor good,or beautiful, only a little more animal life ('but instead of despising it on that account, we have felt more closely related to it ever since, more at home in it'.4*)? 'Physiology', once more, is what 'naked nature' is. [It entails], for example, that friendship, love, artistic creation depend on physical dispositions. For centuries, the human body was poorly understood, or despised and mistreated. In contrast, our task is now to admire and imitate its wisdom, to let it teach us how to live, i.e., to be instructed in what is appropriate to health. Thus we must deem that taking an interest in climate, in location, in regimen, and in a choice of recreation may not be unworthy of the philosopher. 87</page><page sequence="22">Let him listen to music; let him walk; let him not read too much; let him heed the words from Ecce Homo - 'To read a hook early in the morning at sunrise when one is still fresh, while one's strength is barely arising, this is what I call vice.' Knowing oneself is to be able to implement one's own regimen, to take the right steps in one's own life rhythms: 'All of us die too young, from habits fraught with innumerable errors and ignorance.'4* Understood in this sense, the return to nature or rather the 'progress in naturalness' is nothing metaphysical. Following nature's path becomes for us a prudent prophylaxis that takes into account the insertion of humans in their living environment. He are made up of the same elements as nature and, as Nietzsche points out, of more inorganic than organic ones. The link with the cosmos is asserted here. 'We are the shoots of one single tree.'*0 'Man is absolutely dependent upon cosmic forces, their distribution, and their motions.'51 With such a view, Nietzsche endorses the ancient idea - present in Stoicism and during the Renaissance - of an organic relation between the microcosm and the macrocosm. But does not this idea contradict the affirmation of universal chaos? In order to observe a dietary regimen or seek [the benefits of] one climate as opposed to another mustn't one believe in a universal link? Here again we face the problem of totality. If nothing in the universe can be taken away, and if - as Nietzsche claims in terms quite reminiscent of Leibniz - 'the smallest detail implies the whole', how could we escape the fact that, in spite of the preventive concept of chaos, the Nietzschean philosophy of nature - notwithstanding its attempt at reversing deification (de 88</page><page sequence="23">devinisation) - is led to the rational justification of the totality? In Nietzsche, we find much more than fragments of a theodicy. First, there is the necessity of the whole, then, its supra-moral 'goodness', finally, its divine character. The texts that support this claim are numerous and well known. I shall quote only a few that in addition express the thought of an active and joyful fatalism. In The Twilight of the Idols. concerning the strong man according to Goethe, he writes: A spirit thus emancipated stands in the midst of the universe with a joyful and trusting fatalism, in the faith that only what is separate and individual may be rejected, that in the totality everything is redeemed (erl?st) and affirmed - he no longer denies.*3 The thought of fa turn is the absolute antithesis of any idealism, which Nietzsche views as 'cowardly in the fact of necessity' and as exhilarating for the one who knows he is part of it. ...One is necessary, one is-a piece of fate (man ist ein Stuck Fatum), one belongs to the whole, one is in the whole - there exists nothing which could judge, measure, compare, condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, condemn the whole... But nothing exists apart from the whole.** Quite obviously, this conception contains a sophism. In the absence of a measure appropriate to the evaluation of the whole, and in the impossibility of assessing the value of the totality of the world (in opposition to Schopenhauer), the universal link still is no obstacle to internal distinctions, such as the assertion that certain things, or certain human beings, are not as beautiful, not as good, as others. Furthermore, isn't such a proposition contrary to Nietzsche's philosophy, which requires a hierarchy between beings and the possibility of saying of some individuals that they shouldn'.t exist, because they are nothing but 'ressentiment' against the world? But the totality is to be 89</page><page sequence="24">affirmed as it is, without adding or subtracting one iota. '"Seeking" what should be, but is not', or 'what should have been', is to condemn the total course of things. For in it, nothing is isolated: the smallest detail involves the whole... The smallest criticism raised against a detail is raised against the whole'.*4 How could we not conclude that the world is perfect, down to its minutest detail, or, at the very least, reasonably satisfactory - as in Leibniz - in spite of various dark shadows? Nietzsche does not hesitate to voice this opinion, thereby obviating his own interdiction concerning any judgment of value on the totality: It is certain that, assessed (gemessen) from an economic point of view, the forces of nature are all in all (allesamt gut) good, that is to say, useful, in spite of being the source of the most terrible and irrevocable fatality.5* The idea of a fatal and destructive power leads Nietzsche to observe that, once more, he sees the good in the totality, and evil in the details. He immediately reacts against his own reasoning, and concludes - temporarily - by the call to rid ourselves of the totality! It is in my view important to get rid of the whole, of who knows what absolute: it would be taken for God - inevitably... The Whole would always bring back the same problems: 'How is evil possible?' etc... Hence, there is no whole.3* We are now facing the antinomy of which the Eternal Return must be the solution. Either, there is a whole, and, in this case, one cannot fail to justify it rationally, to attribute to it also 'totalising power', 'a universal sensorium', and therefore to reintroduce God as 'the consciousness of the totality in becoming' - an operation that would be, according to Nietzsche, 90</page><page sequence="25">'the greatest objection to Being'.57 Or else, there is no totality, and thus no joyful fatalism, no supra-individual link, and becoming loses itself in indefiniteness. Every being sinks into dispersion. 'Everything is a fragment, an enigma, a horrible randomness'. Does this mean that the Eternal Return is an idealistic solution? For I am the one who says that there is a whole. Ego Fa tum. The unity of the world is not organic, but depends upon a 'yes'. This 'yes' may, or may not, be uttered. In any case, it must be stated 'that everything recurs is the closest approximation (die extremste Ann?herung) of a world of becoming [the only world] to a world of being [a fictitious world]'.** Claiming that Becoming is Being, Identity, Oneness (in Plato's sense), that it is abundant and perfect, such is the summit of contemplation, i.e., of the highest interpretation - yet it is nothing but an interpretation. To reach this 'Dionysian affirmation of the universe as it is, without possibility of subtraction, exception, and choice',*' such an affirmation needs to rest on necessity. The interpretation needs to be reversed into pure necessity, the affirmation originating in the ego corresponding exclusively to the absolutely self-affirmation of the world. In other words, it is the totality, 'the eternal cycle, the same things, the same logic, or the same absence of logic of events', that wants its own return, and that affirms it through the individual affirming it - in order that his own affirmation be the affirmation of a self-affirmation. We have reached here the ultimate degree of the inversion - the inversion of the highest interpretation into 91</page><page sequence="26">the affirmation of affirmation - as we find it in the 'Song of Inebriation' of the Zarathustra or in the Dithyramb to Dionysus 'Fame and Eternity' Let you be eternalI Let you be necessary I My love, eternally , Is kindled by necessity alone. Symbol of necessity, Sublime constellation of Being, Unreached that you are by no wish, Unsoiled that you are by no denial, The eternal 'Yes' of Being, For ever I shall be that 'Yes'. I can utter the unlimited 'yes' because Being has already granted the 'yes' to itself, has already granted itself an eternal blessing. It has already said to itself that it is good. It loves itself and that's why I love it. Amor fati is nothing but the echo of the love - both jubilant and rational - that Being has for itself. Being is again, incontrovertibly, the Model. ******* It is clear that Nietzsche did remain inextricably entangled within the metaphysical terms and themes he overturned, which, because he failed to think them more originally, he confirmed, and inevitably reestablished. Why is his ambivalence toward the models he borrows particularly intense with respect to the ones dealing with Greece? For his love-hate relationship with Plato is no longer to be found in the relationship with Descartes or with German Idealism. Some Platonic themes - hierarchy and justice - remain unaffected in spite of, and through, the inversion to which they are subjected. 92</page><page sequence="27">Likewise, amor fatl - the affirmation of the totality inspired from Stoicism, once stripped of its moralizing rationalism - keeps its power. To be sure, the reason is that, in Plato himself, continuing into the Stoic decadence, there obscurely survives the [same] ideal of unity and totality which had been that of the Presocratics. The Dionysian ideal of the Greeks, the religious affirmation of life, life whole, to which nothing is not denied, from which nothing is severed.*0 Presocratic Greece, says Nietzsche repeatedly, is a 'model of life'. This concept of life does not have a biological meaning. It is the idea of 'total life', without sundering (sans coupure), without chorismos, between the intelligible and the sensible, good and evil, Being and Becoming, divine and human. The notion of 'total life' is meant to retrieve a sense of being that precedes those divisions. Stoicism, which does not reject the unity of the world and stresses that 'the world is the common house of humans and gods', keeps alive the memory of the indivision obtaining before the Socratic catastrophe. For Nietzsche, Greek culture 'in the tragic age' had been able to achieve a vital equilibrium, based upon the harmonious continuity within even the most frightful 'natural instincts', social practices, works, institutions, acts of worship - all of which took instinctual life upon themselves and managed a cultural outlet for it. The Greeks before Socrates had the strength and courage not to denounce the impulses - even wild and 'immoral' ones - before the court of the Virtues. Natural forces are integrated within culture without being either repressed, 93</page><page sequence="28">extirpated, or tamed from the outside. Thus envy becomes the fine Eris [who stands for] competitiveness set within limits. Let us quote a text, one of the most provocative among several dating from the same period (1874-1876): The pleasure of inebriation, of cunning, of vengeance, of envy, of insulting, of obscenity - all of these the Greeks acknowledged as human, and therefore integrated in the edifice of society and morals. The wisdom of their institutions rests upon the absence of a distinction between good and evil, black and white. Nature, such as it shows itself, is not disavowed, but integrated, assigned to worship on special days... A release appropriate to the forces of nature was sought, not their destruction and denial.*1 Nature, as it shows itself in its disquieting eruption as physis, is greeted and affirmed in toto, without being condemned in advance in some of its aspects. The Greek conception of culture conceived it as: a new and improved physis, without inner and outer, without dissimulation and convention, culture or a unanimity of life, thought, appearance and will.*3 But the secret of this harmony has been lost for ever. Nihilism has destroyed the co-belonging of, or interchangeability (reversibilite) between, culture and life, and man and nature. In spite of the cohesiveness of the Eternal Return, life remains brutally logical and cynical, and the totality - wounded, chaotic, labyrinth-like, disjointed - reaches sacredness, when revealed in the blindness of ecstasy. 94</page><page sequence="29">NOTES 1.
