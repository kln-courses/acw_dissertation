<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVEST FESTIVALS AMONG CZECHS AND SLOVAKS IN AMERICA BY SVATAVA PIRKOVA-JAKOBSON HT HE calendar year lends itself to associations with the human course from birth to death. Agrarian rites, centered around the two equinoxes and the two solstices, to a certain degree belong in each phase to a different generation. Children have primacy in the winter and early spring customs, then successively the adolescents and young adults in the spring and summer, the mature people in the fall, and finally the old men and women at the time of the winter solstice, immediately succeeded by the youngsters again. In my inquiry into the calendar rites of the Czecho- slovak immigrants in America, three facts determined my decision to focus upon the fall ritual: it belongs to the mature people, those who are married and who assume the principal responsibility for the community. It is a ritual in which both men and women are equally involved and in which, besides the main actors, all the genera- tions play some part, since the whole village actually participates in the harvesting work, followed by the festivities. It climaxes the agricultural efforts of the year and, since the welfare of the village depends upon the outcome of the harvest, the ritual merriment has a rational justification for the people. The majority of my native informants in America were of peasant origin. Most of those who are now mature and married experienced the harvest ritual in their childhood or youth at home and, had they not emigrated, would now be playing leading parts in it. Here they are the most vital representatives of their ethnic group and the principal organizers of its social activities. The "Sixteenth Moravian Day" took place in Chicago in I954. This meeting of all the Moravian societies in America and Canada was organized by their Chicago Central Association. "Cultivate your folklore" was the slogan of the festival, and "Lord preserve for us the heritage of our ancestors" was its solemn conclusion. The Americans and Canadians of Moravian origin gathered in the park of the Pilsen Brewing Company, and the lapel cards carrying the names of Moravian villages indi- cated their societies. On the open-air platform, under the title "Our Youth in Game and Dance," the calendar rituals were performed: the Carnival Sword Dance, the Expulsion of Death, the Easter Whipping Ceremony, the Raising of the May Tree, the Ride of the Kings, the Harvest Celebration, and the Feasts which follow in honor of the Patron Saint of the village. They took six hours; despite the July heat, attention mounted steadily and every item was frenetically applauded. The performance and the ritual songs have been learned within each of the actively participating societies or in the local ethnic schools. Both memory and ethnographic books were relied on for that purpose. Traditional costumes as well as the ritual props were made at home. Morena, the Death effigy, was dug out at the last moment before the performance from a cellar in Berwyn, where it had been stored since the last Moravian Day a year 266</page><page sequence="2">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America before. The horses for the Ride of the Kings were rented at considerable expense to the Association. A dance lasted until the late hours. A few years earlier I had visited the harvest celebration of the New York society "Moravan," which took place in Sokol Hall, the cultural and social center of the Czechs in Manhattan. It was announced by a poster on the street as "Harvest Cele- bration." People were already dancing, and as I was looking for some characteristic harvest decoration, the treasurer of the society pointed to a wreath on the ceiling. "It is small, but have you ever tried to get grain ears and field flowers in this country? Our farmers from Canada had to send them to us. In any case, it is not relevant. The important thing is that it is called a 'Harvest Celebration,' because it attracts people. Once here, they dance and forget what it is." The fall ritual at the Chicago meeting was performed in the summer, but its order within the sequence of other calendar rites was preserved. As to the harvest dance of the New York "Moravan," it was organized annually towards harvesting time, but besides the indication on the poster, hardly anything else referred to the ritual. Many other harvest celebrations which I saw performed by the Czechs and Slovaks in America have led me to classify these two as extreme instances and to choose three others which I thought typical both for their intrinsic features illustrating the gradual changing of the ritual and for the social setting of each performing group. The harvest ritual "at home" will serve us as a point of comparison. Among the numerous versions of the harvest ritual which my native informants gave me, as they remembered it from their home country, there were regional variants as well as modifications reflecting urban influence. The essential elements, however, were always the same; and they were in agreement with the ethnographic records made in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia, and with testimonies not only from modern times but also from three or four centuries ago. For our purposes, a short summary will suffice. Peasants help each other to harvest the crop, and in feudal times the whole village used to gather in the master's fields. The reapers call the last handful of standing grain "wolf," "goat," or "hare," and the same names are given to those who cut it. It is said that they ride on the "goat" or "wolf," and if the rider is a girl, ditties are sung about her riding on the "tail." Special reaping and harvesting songs, most of them with a mating motif, are sung during the work. Should the landowner, manager, or any passing stranger come to the fields, the women reapers bind his legs or whole body with straw bands. The last sheaf is called "old woman" or "old man." It is usually dressed in old woman's clothing, but if it is "old man," in the clothing of the land- owner. Also the old woman might be dressed in the sheaf, or she might carry the sheaf on her back. The girls make a big wreath of the ears of all kinds of grain and of the field flowers, and two of them carry it in the procession. The youngest one has a wreath on her head. The men reapers put wreaths on their heads, decorate their scythes and rakes with grain ears or a red handkerchief, and carry special poles and sticks with wreaths and red handkerchiefs on top. The landowner, farmer, or the youngest boy reaper carry the same decorated pole or a simple green twig; but in their case it is called "flag" and the one who carries it is the "flag-bearer." The "old woman" is put on a decorated wagon where women surround it, singing "women reapers are going home, they lead a white goat." The men, their faces often blackened, 267</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore walk by their side. They are awaited at the house of the master, landowner, or farmer, or any man chosen to represent the authorities, be it the mayor or, in our times, the Communist administrative official. There they are welcomed, and the wife of the landowner sprinkles the leading girl with water or liquor "in order that the grain will be clean," and she in turn places her wreath on the landowner's head. The reapers then sing to both of them: "As many pines in the forests, so many cows, / as many trees in the forests, so many oxen, / as many sparrows in the world, so many sons, / as many goose-feathers, so many daughters." They are offered food and drink, they dance around the couple, and the landowner hangs his wreath from the ceiling in the corner of the room, or in the stable. The reapers go on dancing inside the big wreath, around and with the "old woman" whom they eventually mock, push, beat and thrash, drown, or burn. In modern times they put it into the threshing machine. Then they struggle for the remnants of the straw or for its ashes, which, during the winter holidays, they will spread on the floor, on the table, on the fields and around the trees. When asked, my native informants were unable to interpret the meaning of the ritual, in particular of its climax. "We use the oldest grain to make the'old woman'; what else would we do with it?" Indeed, they had not read about the deities of agri- culture, the grain god Osiris and the grain mother Demeter, or about the divine king Dionysos sacrificed in the shape of a goat. They had heard no legends about the vegetation god who must die to renew life, nor did they have any superstition explicitly concerning the vegetation spirit that dwells in the grain. They would meet any effort to make them explain the content with a non-cooperative attitude: "I don't know. I never thought about it. Who knows what it means?" However, what they resisted formulating as spectators, they readily viewed as participants, bringing into relief the reiterative quality of the ritual in terms of tradition, the inertia of collective habit and social code. "We have always done it. This is how it always was. Our ancestors did it, so we do it too. My grandmother did it every year, why shouldn't I?" And they emphasized its ordained character: "It must be so." Eagerly, they would shift attention to the individual episodes, which they would describe with relish, clarity of mind, and in minute detail, referring, however, to their emotional attitudes whenever asked to interpret the symbols. "We do it because it is fun. We always think about the cattle, why shouldn't they get the wreath also, they must have their fun too, the cows, isn't that so?" The final rejoicing at the "killing of the 'old woman"' they would connect with the successful outcome of the harvest: "We do it because we don't worry any more. The people feel that they have enough to eat the whole year, that's why we do it." The decorated poles, sticks, and tools are carried "to show that there is harvest," and the wreaths and bouquets of grain ears and field flowers illus- trate "what there is in the fields." The wreath of the youngest girl is hung in the corner of the room "because it looks pretty there," or "there isn't any other place to put it," and "it has always been so." According to the standard responses of my native informants to the same parts of the ritual, there are, on the one hand, scenes and objects which are "fun," and on the other hand, those which are decorative or serve to illustrate the harvest. This differen- tiation which they make is relevant for the analysis of the ritual. Within the category of "fun" there are a few typical variants whose common 268</page><page sequence="4">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America denominator is a metaphorical device of substitution. When the last sheaf is called "old woman," each of two pairs of opposites merge into one unit: the animate and inanimate, and the masculine (sheaf is masculine in Czech) and feminine. The core of the symbolism is the theme of decay, barrenness, and the proximity of death. Of the two correlative images (the sheaf and the "old woman"), the latter might be embodied only in the name, or also either partly materialized, as when the sheaf is dressed in old woman's clothes, or fully so, if an old woman is put into the sheaf. Finally, both images might be merely juxtaposed-the sheaf is carried by an old woman on her back. When the last sheaf is dressed as an "old woman" and then is called "white goat," a double animistic transfiguration occurs through cumulation of metaphors: one, anthropomorphic, achieved materially; the other, zoomorphic, performed verbally. When the girl reaper touches the last standing grain, called "wolf," she will share this name, so that the common verbal symbol refers to two different entities, emphasizing thus their common attribute-the vitality and fertility of the girl and of the still-standing grain. At the same time, the name "wolf" in this metaphoric use merges the inanimate with the animate, the animal with the human, and not only masculine with feminine but directly male with female. When the girl cuts the last standing grain, the imaginary "wolf" gives place to the synecdochic trope of the girl "riding on the 'tail,'" through which there arises an identification not only of the two objects (grain and tail) but also of an agricultural and an erotic act. The symbolism of such primary images as the last sheaf is patent. It is either expressed verbally or by material confrontation of the two correlatives. These sym- bols are unanimously characterized as "fun" by the native informants: "We dance with the 'old woman,' we thrash her and keep the straw." The more images are inter- mitted at the same time, the greater "thrill" is felt by the performers: the sheaf is the "old woman" and is also the "white goat." Although the participants are unable to extract from the ritual its total meaning- or, rather, just because such an extraction is tabooed-they intuit the spiritual principle of the action without being able to rationalize it, just as a speech community is aware of verbal mechanisms without being able to abstract this knowledge from the con- crete verbal behavior. They discern the crucial points within their enactment, and such scenes as the "cutting of the 'wolf'" or the "killing of the 'old woman'" evoke in them a most hilarious response, an intense emotional catharsis. Theirs is actually the joy over life and fecundity ensuing from the death of the scapegoat and, their merriment shared by all, it is in this communion that the participants find the intrinsic meaning of the ritual. They realize the connection between the "killing" and the new fertility with one significant limitation, namely, that the effect (causa finalis) is interpreted as cause: "Having enough to eat, we kill the 'old woman'" instead of "Killing her, we have enough to eat." Thus in this exegesis the funda- mentally magic sacrifice becomes a Thanksgiving feast. Heightstown is a small community near Trenton, New Jersey, on the route to Washington, D. C. About fifteen years ago, a few Slovaks and Moravians began to settle on farms there, and now there are forty or fifty such families spread about the area. Most of them originally came from remote villages in the Carpathian mountains where, in their early youth, they worked as laborers on other people's 269</page><page sequence="5">Journal of American Folklore property and had little opportunity to go to school or to learn a trade. Unskilled when they came to America, they took any available jobs and became handy-men, cleaners, miners, and factory workers. The girls worked as housemaids in the homes of American families situated on the outskirts of their ethnic clusters, or took jobs in nearby factories until they married. Most of them wanted to return to the soil, how- ever, and as soon as they saved some money, invested it in a farm. The first years they had their hands full farming and did not meet often. But in I945 a Slovak couple celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary, and on that occasion some sixty guests danced and sang in the couple's long trailer garage. There they got the idea that they should organize a club in which the members would meet to discuss farming matters and also hold social gatherings. They went to their minister in Trenton to ask him how to go about it and what name to give the club. "Today, the laws say that we are a Social and Cultural Club of American-Czechoslovak farmers in Heightstown, New Jersey, with the subtitle that we cultivate Czechoslovak customs, songs and dances as well as American literature.... We had to add that." "People didn't go to New York and were hungry for entertainment." At every meeting the garage was overcrowded. There they had picnics, danced, celebrated May Day and Carnival. Soon they got together three thousand dollars and bought a wooded area. "What to do with an empty woods? We will build. But where to get the money? Mr. Porubsky and Mr. Melicharek ran the whole thing; they were older and knew how to persuade people. They canvassed the area in their cars and sold shares. When the clubhouse was being built, people worried; when they saw it com- pleted: 'Gee, that's nice.'" They wondered how to dedicate it and wanted to do something "that would attract and bring many people together. Something new. Mr. Melicharek, who had seen more of the world than anyone else-he used to be a farmhand-drew an idea from his head: a mock-wedding. He must have seen some- thing like that at home, but in this part of the country no one had ever heard about it before. Perhaps in New York." And so they rehearsed it. "No ceremony, no ritual, just a march from the school, as if it were the church, to the club. We had best men and bridesmaids. The bride, a girl who had recently arrived from Slovakia, and the bridegroom, a Slovak from New York, presented a program of solos. When we were marching, dancing, and singing, with the musicians in front, the people in town didn't know what was going on-'Those people must be going crazy.' The club made a thousand dollars from it. The girl who represented the bride and her bride- groom later really did get married. They didn't have a big wedding. No one knew about it." Then they had another idea: "A Harvest Home Dance, as they call it in America." This was the idea of Jozka Nekarda, at that time president of the enter- tainment branch of the club. When I first met Nekarda, at the Slovak Maypole celebration at Staten Island, New York, a second Harvest Home Dance was already in preparation in Heights- town. He invited me to be his guest and to take part in the celebration. I came a day early to help them. As I was painting Harvest posters, the Nekardas told me about their lives. Jozka Nekarda is perhaps the only Moravian and Catholic in a Slovak Lutheran group. His mother died when he was two years old, and his father died eight years later. He was left with two teen-age sisters and four small brothers. The girls and 270</page><page sequence="6">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America boys took care of the farm, and Jozka went to school, took care of the cattle, and cooked for them all. He was too small to take part in the life of the village, but he used to go caroling at Christmas with the other children. Once he saw the older boys raising a May Tree, and during the war they all would go to the cross behind the village to pray. At thirteen he followed his sister to America. She married in Omaha and he was to help on her farm, but she soon sent him away to work as a farmhand. There were many Czechs there and good soil. The work was hard, but the people were nice, and he got enough to eat. There were no trees. Everything was still done in the old way: they used horses and ploughs, sheaves, and even flails. The people had enough time and didn't go to work in a factory if they had a farm. But they didn't have any cele- brations; no Carnival, no caroling, no May Tree, no Harvest. There was a church seventeen miles away from the village where Czech, Slovak, Polish, Ukrainian, and other services were held. People went there on Sundays, with each group waiting its turn. Jozka used to sing to them, "When I was leaving my country, everybody cried," and those who listened to him cried, too. He did not learn any English there. Later, he joined his brothers in New York. They told him that it was easier to make money there, and he worked as a mason and a gardener. They lived together in a cottage on Long Island, economized, and when one of them returned home, he bought a farm and was able to afford schooling for his four children. Once the brothers said they were going to a vintage. He thought they were going to pick grapes in a vineyard, but they went to the Sokol Hall in New York and danced. He hadn't learned much about such customs at home. In the Slovak singing society he met Anna, a subtle, urban-looking girl, and they married in I929. Anna was born in America of Slovak parents. When she was five years old, she was taken to their native village, Vrbovce. Her father had a farm there and substi- tuted for the local school teacher. When his brothers divided the farm among them and nothing was left for him, he had to work hard again. He was never a strong worker and liked to read. He went to Canada and brought his family over when Anna was thirteen. He never made much money, and Anna started to earn her living as a housemaid in New York two years later. She used to read a lot and sang in the Slovak singing society. She wanted to marry "not a white-collar clerk, who is not interesting, but a strong-minded man, a labor man, a real man, a worker, and that is Jozka." She was never a "peasant girl" and always wished to become a school teacher. Today she would rather speak English than Slovak, and would rather sing popular, city songs than folksongs. But she "would never have married Jozka if he hadn't sung so well. No one in the community knows as many folksongs as he, and no one does the caroling around the farms at Christmas as well as he does. The longer he is in America, the more he becomes attached to the old customs. When, in 1939, Czechoslovakia was occupied, he came home, threw himself on his bed and cried." She never knew that he loved his homeland so much. They bought the farm during the war, and Jozka also works at General Electric in Trenton. They didn't have anything, but now they have "machines, an electric refrigerator, a car, a modern stove, and two children. My whole life I used to wander as a vagabond among strangers, and only now I have returned to them," he says, referring to his Slovak farming community in Heightstown. 27I</page><page sequence="7">Journal of American Folklore Plans were being made for the harvest celebration. "There will be two rented trucks. People in costumes will be peasants, and go in the second truck; the others will dress as farmers and go on the first. You know, it is a small town and people are sensitive ... America first. I will dress as a farmer and perhaps take the big hat of an American farmer. The peasants will go behind as if they were only accom- panying the farmers to the dance. The sheaves and wreathes will be bought from a dealer in Trenton-here they cut the grain differently, only the ears, and leave the straw standing in the fields. We will start at the other end of town as if there were fields. We will go slowly through the town as if it were a village, to the club-house, as if it were a farm. There the Porubskys will await us with drinks and food. They will be the landowners; they are the oldest among us and they are here thirty years already. Someone should write about it in the newspapers so that the other people would know what it is. It is not easy to go through the whole town. They might throw tomatoes at us. Or perhaps the Ukrainians and Poles will think that it is something political... ." Anna Nekarda joined in at this point: "No one can harm us. No one can do anything to us. We are supposed to ... we signed to do it ... to cultivate the old customs." Later she told me, "I will not go on the truck. I don't feel like it. It is not sincere. I don't feel like one of them. It is an imitation, do you know what I mean?" The next day we were standing on the outskirts of Heightstown, waiting. In each truck there were about forty people with scythes, rakes, and forks in their hands. There were also sheaves, wreathes, samples of grain, ribbons, green twigs and ac- cordions. The peasants and farmers were discussing what songs to sing when they went through the center of town. Should it be the American "Old MacDonald had a farm, quack, quack, quack? . . . then there should be ducks and pigs on the truck also, but the ducks are not harvested .. ." The hour struck and the procession moved on. I was asked to join the young people in the first car behind the trucks. The young president of the entertainment branch of the club, who was supposed to organize the celebration together with the parents, was driving. As soon as we started, the boys hurriedly pulled down the curtains, huddled together, choked with laughter and embarrassment: "The people in town know us and we don't want them to see us here." "How could my mother ever go on the truck, and so madly dressed?" The young president was pale and tight-lipped. "I didn't want it this way at all . . . it slipped out of my hands," he said to me almost apologetically. The songs grew louder as we neared the town. I opened the window. The ribbons flew, the songs became solemn, and I saw Jozka in front, waving his hat in the air. His voice was leading. However, there was no one in the streets. It was a hot Sunday noon in Indian Summer. The people didn't open their windows to look, nor did the few pedestrians turn or wave. We were already in the Negro quarter and there they looked at us lazily without even a smile. From the town on, we went faster and faster through the fields to the forest. At the club someone took pictures of the "peasants" and the "farmers" with their sheaves, wreaths, and tools. Then we went inside where the "landowners" were waiting. An old ritual song was sung to wish them well, while some were helping me to place my recording machine so that they would all be heard on it. They were delighted. The Porubskys served drinks and a cake, and we danced until morning. Jozka, though he was exuberant with joy, kept repeating to 272</page><page sequence="8">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America me, "We should have announced it in the newspapers . . . we should have an- nounced it." The harvest celebration in Heightstown was intended as an imitation of the corresponding ritual in a Slovak village. The people would frequently refer to its non-authentic character by calling it a mock-performance, and would stress its formal likeness with the original: "the way we always did it." In the reminiscences of the Slovak farmers, however, the ritual was inseparable from its authentic surroundings and bearers. Consequently the outskirts were to be imagined as fields, the town as a village, and the clubhouse as a farm. In order to represent the feudal village society, the people in costumes were "the peasants," and the oldest couple "the landowner and his wife." Those without traditional outfits were conceived as "farmers." In the front, a plain sheaf was placed at Jozka's side. It had lost its customary metaphoric association with the "old woman," and, like the other paraphernalia, assumed a merely metonymic status. The sheaf, the bouquet of the last grain, and the wreaths, as well as the tools and costumes, signified allegiance of the participants to their peasant past. With the elimination of the "old woman," the composition of the mock-perform- ance changed substantially. The "peasants" and the "farmers" merely went on the truck singing a potpourri from the general stock of Slovak folksongs instead of the specific harvesting songs, and the climax of the action shifted from the "killing of the 'old woman'" to the collective partaking of the harvest food and drink at the "landowner's farm." Imitating the model, the Heightstown Slovaks transformed it; and all their unintentional modifications converged towards the same end: the agricultural con- stituents and symbols of the ritual were weakened in favor of the socially communal manifestations. The arrangement of the mock-performance reveals a latent conflict in the peasant tradition of the Heightstown Slovaks, with the victory of this tradi- tion as an emotional outcome of their action: "I felt more at home than ever when singing on the truck," confessed Jozka, and everyone joyfully corroborated his state- ment. The participants experienced a collective identification with the ancestral society, and the celebration planned as a mock-performance ended in giving them an actual belief by enhancing their ethnic cohesion. Those who did not take an active part remained untouched, indifferent, and even ironical. "We present drama, comedies, musicals and operas," says Standa Mizerovsky, the semi-professional stage director of the Czech and Slovak theatrical world on Manhat- tan's East Side. "We don't care much for the operas; they have too much singing. We like something where one talks, sings, and dances, something nice; we are simple people, you know. We like best the comedies. We take an old play and make a suc- cess of it. We cut it in half and insert some old custom, a wedding or a carnival, with songs and dances, in national costumes. Sometimes we make the songs ourselves, Mr. Tuma, the pianist, and I, so it is almost a musical, but we cannot call it that because someone could have seen the play before and would know it is not a musical. The songs are always successful. We try to arrange them for a big chorus so that many people and children can take part. This is the secret of a successful play; those who come to see it want to have someone they know on the stage. The first genera- 273</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Amerzcan Folklore tion has the greatest demand for plays from the village life in the old country. For the second generation it does not matter what the play is about. Today there are many more Slovaks on Manhattan than Czechs, and so there are also three times as many Slovak plays performed each year than Czech ones. The Slovaks have always been better actors than the Czechs anyhow, and they listen and obey when they are told how to play. Also, whenever a Slovak play is given, there is such a crowd that we start at 5:00 instead of at 3:oo P.M., and the street is full of cars from Manhattan, Yonkers, New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania." The plays are organized by the entertainment branches of the Czech and Slovak cultural and benefit societies. One of them is the "Vrbovce Circle" (Vrbovianskj krzuok), whose members come from Vrbovce, a Slovak mountain village on the Moravian border; Sam Cernek is its president. Today there are allegedly over two thousand people from Vrbovce in the Penn- sylvania mines and in New York. They are those who have stayed. There were others, like the married men who came for three years and bought a farm after they returned, or the girls who came to America just to make some money for their dowries. Between the two wars there was someone going to the United States every week. They didn't even stop to see the capital of their country, but went directly to the German harbor and to New York. The VrbovCanskj krurok has been a sort of branch village for them. It used to have its own orchestra with two violins, a clarinet, bass, and cymbals, which played at weddings, carnivals, picnics, national celebrations, and dances. Its dance group performed at the International Exhibition in New York and was asked to dance for television. But many of the members got married outside of New York, and the cymbalist died. The greatest part of the profit from the various activities was sent back home. Until I928 the village had thatched roofs. Now it has tile, six new schools, twenty-five teachers, a new city hall, a fire station and a com- munity barn; the streets are asphalted and the brook has a concrete bed; electricity and a telephone system have been installed, a library organized, and an orphanage supported, all by American money from Vrbovce people. Beneath the tile roofs, the traditional life of the village has not changed. When anyone marries, the men go on horseback dressed in women's clothes, and when people die, a metal coin and bread are put into their coffins. On St. Lucia's Day, masked men in white robes go from window to window to frighten the women; on St. Nicholas' Day, women dress as St. Nicholas, as angels and as devils, and make the rounds of the village. At Christmas, each peasant walks out to his fields and sows poppy seed on the snow; if the weather is too bad, he throws the seed out on his own yard, as if he were sowing it. The women fill a straw basket with all the grain from the year's harvest, with fruit and garlic, and feed the cattle and the poultry. Poppy seed, honey, and cabbage are served on Christmas Eve, and the children and local gypsies go caroling. If, on the next morning, an unknown woman stops at the door, the housewife throws salt on her in order to keep evil away from the family. At Carnival, four young men perform the sword dance with metal skewers on which, as a reward, they collect from house to house bacon and smoked meat. In the evening the old people bury the Carnival at the inn: they put an old bass dressed in rags in a coffin, add some liquor, and pretend to cry in a funeral procession. During the first days of spring, little girls carry a birch tree into the village, turning in the direction 274</page><page sequence="10">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America 275 of the sun; at Easter time, the boys come to visit the girls and whip them with willow whips and sprinkle them with water. The May tree is made out of the tallest tree that can be found on the mountain; a small pine tree and a big cock-feather are attached to its top, while at its foot a bottle containing liquor is placed. At harvest time, a special celebration takes place. A procession of wagons comes from the fields into the village. On the first wagon there are samples of all the grain from the fields, and a sheaf with a boy and a girl standing on either side; on the second there is com- post, on the third, hay. Then follows an allegorical wagon with Serfdom representing the old times, Freedom the Czechoslovak Republic. Behind all this come the harvesters and the agrarian youth on bicycles. After the ceremony at the landowner's house, a political speech is given on the village green, and then all proceed to the forest for a picnic and dancing. When Sam Cernek left for America, the village had almost 4,000 inhabitants, of whom two-thirds were Lutheran. On his mother's side his family were made freemen and given immunity from military service. Having been chosen from among the country boys, he got a fellowship to study at the agronomic school and was to become an organizer and speaker for the Agrarian Party. He had the chance to prove his ora- torical gift and wit in a joke contest at the Vrbovce City Hall, which he won with 327 jokes, drinking and eating in between. He also performed the best man function at weddings, which required memory, improvisatory talent, and social abilities. When he decided to leave, he was twenty-three years old and was working for an insur- ance company. With the company compensation he came to America with more money than he has now, and he meant to stay a short time. He had a trade and "trade means bread in America": he knew how to cook and bake. He learned this skill from his mother, whose fame as a good cook made her indespensable at any wedding in Vrbovce or thereabouts. Later he became the man- ager of a small inn in downtown Greenwich Street, where, at that time, many Slovaks lived. While both he and his wife were working hard in the restaurant, he organized the political and social life of his people. He trained the thirty-six pairs of dancers and took part in all the Slovak weddings as best man. His place in the neighborhood of the Manhattan skyscrapers became a center of Slovak festivities, but when the whole quarter was torn down a few years ago, the inn disappeared and the Slovaks were dispersed. Three years ago at Easter time, Cernek came to visit a Slovak family in Man- hattan, and there I met him for the first time. With a willow whip he was to per- form the traditional whipping of the women and to get painted eggs from them in return. Every year he makes this visit to his numerous friends in New York and vicinity. "There wouldn't be any Easter without it." Later, however, he told me, referring to the ceremonial whipping, "It is nothing. It is in name only. It is to com- memorate that in our country we used to whip the Christ. It is not real. You should have seen our theater. We played the Harvest. It was called The Peasant from the Golden Farm, and there was everything. It was exactly like at home. I was the landowner. God, it was beautiful!" The play was performed again the following fall. The dramatis personae in the production included the landowner, his wife and nephew; a poor peasant and his daughter; the priest, mayor, and innkeeper; the night-watchman and the policeman;</page><page sequence="11">Journal of American Folklore the matchmaker; a maid; first, second, and third neighbors; farm-hands, maidservants, and musicians. The orchestra was to play during and after the performance. The curtain rose, and on the stage there was a Slovak village: a peasant house at the left with a high gable and a red geranium in a small window; a tree was at the right, and in the background were mountains covered with forests and a light blue sky. A cock crowed; it was morning. It was just like home, and beautiful, I thought. The plot developed rapidly, and the second act started with the harvest celebration. The stage was crowded with peasants and their children. The reapers came from the fields with a sheaf and a wreath, with wreaths on their heads and tools in their hands. They sang the ritual song for the landowner and his wife, who stood in front of their house, ate the ritual cake, and drank the liquor which was offered to them. They danced around the sheaf and the landowner couple and sang many harvesting songs. The impression of gaiety was successfully produced and the scene was applauded. The landowner was exuberant; his improvised jokes were especially rewarded with out- bursts of laughter from the audience. The three sets which Jozka Nekarda projected by imagination on the outskirts of Heightstown, on the town and the clubhouse, were realized in the play in one single decor. The peasantry, which he had brought into the mock-performance as impersonal bearers of the ritual, now obtained specific differentiated roles reflecting the social structure of a village and the human relationships within it. They were concrete dramatis personae whose action became self-sufficient, reducing the ritual to the scene at the landowner's house. The sheaf as well as the reapers changed to mere accessories which contributed to the rural picture centered around the role of the landowner. The ancestral society, which in the mock-performance was the domi- nant feature of the participants' spiritual experience, became a subject of the play, as was specifically announced in the subtitle: "An image of village life." The same state of illusion which permits the participants of the harvest ritual to see in the sheaf intermittently both the sheaf and the "old woman" enabled the spectators of the staged harvest celebration to see the actors intermittently as mere imitators and as actual performers of a genuine ritual. Consequently, since the stage ceremony was experienced by the spectators as real collective ritual, it called for an active part in the performance. We observed a conversion of spectators into partici- pants: "It was like at home, and we sang and danced until late at night." The house of the gymnastic society "Sokol" (Falcon) in Detroit was built in the eighties. Since then, the Bohemian and Moravian Czechs have been carried away by the continuous waves of residential mobility which shift the ethnic groups one after the other, according to their economic progress, across the Detroit plain; and today, the black Americans who inhabit what was once the Czech quarter, observe with curiosity the reading and discussing, the athletic training, the celebrating, dancing, and singing Slavs. There is hardly a Czech in the town who does not belong to the "Sokol," and the society itself is a member of the American Sokol Federation, which in turn is a branch of the parent society in the home country. Their slogan "Neither profit nor glory" speaks for its ethos. "A man, perfect physically, spiritually and morally, of a firm and noble character, whose word is irrevocable, like the law," is the formula with which new members are sworn in. Documents stored in the library 276</page><page sequence="12">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America are witness to past activities and endeavors of the members, aiming towards the recon- struction of political freedom in the native country, the welfare of the common peo- ple, liberal and social idealism. The motto of the society's theater defines its function: "To bring before the eyes of our people the glorious heritage of our gallant ancestors, their glory and martyrdom, their perseverance in conviction and their humiliation." The titles of the plays on the yellowing programs show that the task was carried out: "Jan Hus," "Jan Hus a Jeronym," "Jan 2izka," "Psohlavci," "Jan Vyrava," "Karel Havlicek Borovsky," and other names of Czech historical heroes. But dramas and comedies from village life are not missing: ". . about young people, when he is rich and she is poor, and the father does not allow him to marry, or disinherits him. We know these things from our lives there, but it also happens here. You can laugh and cry in it.... About the son who gets rich and does not acknowledge his father any more. That happens more often at home than here." On different festive occasions the society shows pictures borrowed from the Film Library. "People love to come, especially if it is something from the Fatherland and they can see their old country." For twenty-five years they have been making their own films and have recorded all the national Czechoslovak and American celebrations and manifestations in which they have taken part-festivals, weddings, and funerals, life in Czech communities and families, on farms and in Detroit. Martin Kovarik is an outstanding example of a Sokol. Both he and his wife by virtue of their wisdom, life experience, and achievements, as well as by genuine kind- ness, are the recognized spiritual leaders of the group. They came to America as teen- agers from Moravian villages and married here. "We had nothing when we came; first our people wanted to have a wife and a house, but the first thing one had was a car. Now they have big, beautiful farms and I have a house with all the modern equipment and gadgets." Cultural activities within both the American and Czech societies, conscious allegiance to their new country, as well as awareness of civic re- sponsibilities, distinguish them. "Our people began to settle here a century ago. We have a share in the growth of the city. On the 250th Anniversary of Detroit, we marched right behind the American Indians." Both of the Kovariks remember clearly their holidays in the old country. "At carnival time masked men used to go around the village, straw wrapped all over their bodies, boys disguised as women, each taking what he could. There were no theatrical outfitting companies where one could rent a costume as there are here; they blackened their faces, went around on wooden goats, or led a bear; in short, they used anything which was at hand." When the Kovarik's son was getting married not long ago, his wedding was celebrated in the Sokol Hall, "the way it always is whenever at least one of the newlyweds is a Moravian." At midnight the older women take the wreath -one should say veil-from the bride's head and, singing the usual songs of parting with girlhood and parents, they bind her head with a scarf. Then everyone buys a dance with her. Sometimes over three hundred dollars is collected. Then they seat the bride on a chair in the middle of the hall and the boys lead the bridegroom away. In a hurry they put in her place an ugly man, ridiculous and small, and cover him with a white bed sheet. They call the bridegroom and tell him that he cannot get the bride as easily as he thought. "How much do you give?" "I don't have any money." If he understands what is going on, he refuses to pay and makes as many jokes and jests as 277</page><page sequence="13">Journal of American Folklore possible. Eventually, he gives his whole purse and is supposed to embrace the bride. At the last moment they pull away the bed sheet and he kisses the ugly man. If the bridegroom is an American, he gets scared. Afterwards one shaves the groom with a special wooden blade and then puts a horseshoe on the bride's shoe. "You want to know what it means? It simply means that we want to collect some money for the bride." Kovarik was obliging enough to show me moving pictures of their life, among which there was a complete record in color of a harvest celebration of the year before. It was organized by the Western Czech Brethren Unity, to which all of them belonged, at the Ryzner's farm in Owoso, where the Detroit Sokol has its summer camp. Kovarik arranged the program. In his native village, 2eravice, there were two kinds of harvest celebration. One of these was on the Berchtold Estate, where half of the village was employed. The crop was brought home with two sheaves; the first was the "bride," the second was the "old woman." They were carried by the two most popular boys among the reapers, and two girls carried the two wreaths. After the ceremony at the landowner's house, they got a barrel of beer and danced in the yard. The other celebration, for the rest of the community, was given by the mayor. Kovarik got some other ideas from a booklet printed in Prague, "Harvest Celebration, an ancient Moravian custom from the time of serfdom, to be performed at harvest and on other occasions." The char- acters in the program of the Owoso celebration were "the landowner and his wife, the grandfather, old and young maid, two boys, a night-watchman, older people, young laborers and servants, children. All, including the people, in national costume." The procession seemed endless. In front went the band, then two boys with bouquets of grain-ears and field-flowers, two girls with wreaths, children, women, and men. "The nicest thing about it is that all the children were born in America," said Mrs. Kovarik. Some rakes were seen, which had been brought from among the stage properties of the theater, as well as a few scythes, whose blades were covered with paper. "More of them would mean trouble; who would transport them here from the theater? Our farmers have hundreds of acres, they must use machines. We always used to go on wagons with sickles and scythes, but since one of the women fell down and the sickle almost pierced her body, we march. The majority of people you see are our farmers. Look at those from Bannister, how worn out, how bent they are. They settled there because the farms there were in a bad state and cheap. Now they have excellent grounds, a National Hall, and a Czech school, where their children learn how to read and write in Czech." They came in various native costumes, from Detroit and from the farms around the Lakes and in Canada. In the yard there was a platform with a microphone, before which stood the land- owner and his wife. "There were so many people that I had to use it so that everyone could hear well." Behind them sat the grandfather in the old-fashioned outfit of a Czech peasant-Kovarik himself. The two boys and girls step onto the platform, approach the landowner and his wife with bouquets and wreaths, and recite some verses of good will. A night-watchman appears and, running here and there, he blows his horn towards the crowds and complains that he does not get any credit for watch- ing the village every night. A young man and woman replace the landowner couple at the microphone and begin to quarrel, when the grandfather, supporting himself on 278</page><page sequence="14">Harvest Festivals Among Czechs and Slovaks in America his cane, gets up and says, "But children, children, don't argue .. ," and with a few more admonishing words he reconciles them. The young people dance around the landowner and his wife, the crowd applauds and slowly leaves the yard to dance on the meadow. Kovarik turned on the lights in the room. "After our celebration a few years ago, two young Americans came and wanted to know what it was, what our beginnings in this country were and whether there was a book written about it. So we sent an article to the American newspapers with the explanation that it was a harvest festival which means thanks given to God for a good crop. A year later an American society organized a similar harvest festival. They liked the idea, the meaning. You see how easy it is to spread our customs in America? But something should be done with the play. It should be Americanized. Or-you are educated and you know us from here and from the old country-why wouldn't you modernize it? Why wouldn't you write a play for us?" I asked him for suggestions. "Something should be added so that our children would believe it. Talk about the old Czech history, but as if it would be here, not there. They all should know about our past. Here they read about the cowboys and Indians and horseback riding, but that is American history. They don't know anything about the cultivation of the soil, how their ancestors worked there and we here. The modernization of this city has happened during our lifetime. We lived in huts with no water or electricity, many of us together. These were our beginnings, our lives. Tell them how we bought a cottage, a small farm, worked and paid for it. How much easier it is today with tractors and everything. It is pleasure, not work. We came here to provide a better life for our children. They have gadgets, but gadgets will not save them if bad times come. It would be a pity if they forgot their origins." Kovarik introduced new figures into the Harvest celebration. They extend the scene at the landowner's house by repeating its symbolic action on a new level: the bouquet of grain ears and the wreath are to transfer fertility from the grain to the landowner and his wife, while the speech of the grandfather is to convey his wisdom to the young couple. The sheaf is absent, and it is the old man who carries off the climax. Commenting upon the play, Kovarik preserves the attitude of this old man and interprets the scene in terms of a cultural conflict between the two generations of Czechs in Detroit, the old one which immigrated from abroad and the younger one born in America. Protagonist of the moral values inherited from his tradition and contained in his life experience, Kovarik sees an unbridgeable gap between the ma- terial ideals of his sons and himself. Having attained, at the expense of hard work, material security for those who will follow, he feels unable to transmit to the new generation his spiritual legacy. The play is therefore intended by him to make the past an integral part of the present ("speak about the Czech history but as if it were here") and to reveal moral values as the only basis of personal and communal well- being and as the ultimate safeguard for the continuity of life. In trying to create an actually efficient, "modern" play out of the conventional harvest ritual, Kovarik was on the way to making a human drama out of the very core of this ritual, the principle of death and resurrection. Such work was accomplished by Sophocles, when he wrote his Oedipus Rex for the Dionysos Festival in Athens. 279</page><page sequence="15">280 Journal of American Folklore Thus in the harvest festivals of the American Czechs and Slovaks gradual change can be observed from ritual to drama. The irrational substratum and figurative presen- tation give way to a rational attitude and realistic performance; instead of a com- munity of participants, there appear two distinct groups of actors and spectators. The syncretism of the sheaf-"old woman"-in the ritual is replaced by a simple juxtaposi- tion of the sheaf and man in the mock-performance; on the Slovak stage the sheaf recedes into the background, leaving the peasant collective to step into front position. In Kovaiik's attempt, the sheaf disappears completely and the action is carried by the individualized figure of the old man. The human being interlaced with the symbolism of the vegetable and animal world in the ritual becomes gradually the main and, finally, the only medium of the play.
