      <p>In spite of the abundance of evidence in the social science literature suggesting a link between death and consumption (e.g., Baudrillard 1993; Goody 1962; Hertz 1960; Metcalf and Huntington 1991; Turley 1998), references to death in consumer studies are rare. Nevertheless, there is evidence of a recent growing interest in issues around the end of life among consumer researchers (e.g., Gentry et al. 1995; Hirschman 1990; Kates 2001; O’Donohoe and Turley 2000; Price et al. 2000; Schwartz, Jolson, and Lee 1986; Turley 1995). However, all of these studies have been located in the United States or Europe, and none has examined the consumption implications of death rituals specifically. Therefore, we embarked on an inquiry into death‐ritual consumption behavior in an African cultural context in an effort to extend consumer research beyond the dominant Western philosophical boundaries of thought. In this article, we explore some of the sociocultural dynamics that facilitate the construction of meaning and identities in Asante, a society in Ghana, West Africa, and examine how consumers manage various aspects of death through consumption.</p>
      <p>Our primary objective was to examine the robustness of the theoretical position that a person’s identity‐construction project ceases upon death (Giddens 1991; Riley 1983); an observation that has been based primarily on research located in Western cultures. A subordinate objective was to examine the seeming ease of conversion of one form of consumption capital to another, for example, from global to local or from economic to cultural (Bourdieu 1984; Holt 1997, 1998). We locate these objectives in the sociocultural dynamics of class and status in Asante. In pursuit of these objectives, we also consider the adequacy of terror‐management theory (TMT; Becker 1973; Greenberg et al. 1986; Solomon et al. 1998) in explaining death‐ritual consumption in this non‐Western context. Our study follows in the path of others (e.g., Arnould 1989) who show that existing conceptual frameworks can be challenged and extended based on evidence found in differing cultural contexts.</p>

         <title>Death, Identity, and Terror Management</title>
         <p>Death in Western societies is generally perceived as the “material end of the body and the social self” (Seale 1998, p. 34) and denotes “the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness” (Gervais 1986, p. 159). Simply put, death means separation—separation from the realities of the world and loved ones or objects. This separation causes the bereaved to reflect on the meanings and value of life, and what this means for the bereaved's existence. The bereaved also makes conscious effort to make sense of death in the human experience. These reflections often generate a variety of negative emotions such as anger, fear, guilt, and shame and feelings of self‐inadequacy, which may be assuaged by consumption such as the conspicuous mortuary expression of affluence or investment in cryonic suspension (Berger 1967; Brown 1997; Grainger 1998; Parkes 1998). In contemporary Western societies, these efforts may also represent consumers’ pursuit of symbolic immortality (Hirschman 1990). According to TMT, these strategies help people manage their identities in a time of crises, as they seek to avoid or minimize the terror that thoughts of death may cause due to increased salience of one’s own mortality (Aries 1974; Becker 1973; Greenberg et al. 1986).</p>
         <p>In addition to providing emotional relief, death‐ritual consumption choices may facilitate mobility toward consumer identity aspirations as they provide evidence to self and others that the mourner is caring, sentimental, or from an illustrious family. As material possessions have become markers of identity and social status, consumption has become an effective vehicle for refining identities through social symbolic dialogue. Heirlooms and other inheritances provide personal memorials for survivors (e.g., Belk, Wallendorf, and Sherry 1989; Price, Arnould, and Curasi 2000; Unruh 1983), and may be used to create symbolic immortality for the deceased. However, the deceased’s final identity is often defined by their premortem experiences reflected in mementos that are invested with meanings associated with the deceased’s lived experience (Gentry et al. 1995). This is because it is believed that upon death there is little or no opportunity to renegotiate a newer identity for the deceased.</p>
         <p>This viewpoint is supported by the substantive theory of identity negotiations that suggests that death takes away a person’s identity, along with opportunities to renegotiate the deceased’s identity (Levinson 1978; Riley 1983) and so consumers themselves define their postmortem identities prior to their deaths (Hirschman 1990). Exceptions may be observed in the rare instances where family members donate a deceased person’s organs in attempts to posthumously rehabilitate stingy or selfish relatives (Prottas 1983). In addition, occasionally there are artists or authors whose geniuses are discovered posthumously (e.g., Miller 1997). This indicates that the relevant community may redefine the artist’s identity as she or he is presented in a light far better than was recognized or even due in life.</p>
         <p>A major threat to a person’s identity is the death of a loved one, since a part of a person who was critical to self‐definition of the survivor is seen to be irrevocably lost (Lofland 1982). Death alters the survivors’ senses of self radically and undermines their taken‐for‐granted consciousness of the realities of everyday life (Berger 1967, p. 43; Bloch and Parry 1982). In this sense, death is a source of terror that challenges the public and private identities of the living. Terror‐management theory suggests that the bereaved will often seek to minimize or even eliminate this terror. Grounded in the works of Aries (1974), Becker (1973), and others, TMT holds that the unique awareness of death renders human beings prone to terror and that this terror is managed by a dual‐component anxiety buffer consisting of a worldview and self‐esteem (Greenberg et al. 1986; Solomon et al. 1998, p. 39). When a threat occurs, the urgency of maintaining one’s anxiety buffer is significantly enhanced. A wide range of defensive strategies aimed at defusing the threat may be applied, including the pursuit of symbolic immortality through consumption. This view of mortality suggests that social actors would prefer not be so terrorized by the salience of death and, thus they will seek to expunge death from everyday consciousness (Baudrillard 1993).</p>
         <p>Evidence to this effect may be found in attitudes toward death in contemporary Western societies (Aries 1974; Seale 1998). Describing this situation as the “pornography of death,” Gorer (1955) noted the tremendous efforts that are expended to extend life and to expunge the trauma of death from everyday life and vocabulary. Public discussions of death are frowned upon, and related discourses in the public domain are highly regulated by sociocultural norms. The rarity of death‐product advertising and the conspicuous absence of death‐product sales outlets in public areas provide further marketplace evidence to this effect. Aries (1974) attributes this situation to the human disdain for death, which resulted from the observable and perceived physical outcomes of death. By pursuing symbolic immortality for the deceased and keeping a lid on social discussions of death, consumers minimize the terror they would otherwise feel from the salience of death and thoughts of death. Since these conclusions were derived from studies located in Western societies, a key purpose of our study was to examine the dynamics of postmortem identity construction among consumers in a non‐Western society and to understand how they manage death and some of its related consumption phenomena.</p>

         <title>Methodology</title>
         <p>Long open‐ended interviews that emphasized consumer death‐ritual experiences were conducted with 11 informants in Asante, Ghana. Informants were identified through a network of friends and relatives. The first author conducted all interviews personally. Except for one informant (Manu) who was interviewed at her place of work—she runs a retail store for funeral products—all interviews took place at the homes of the informants and were conducted in the local language (Asante Twi). While 11 may appear to be a small number, a review of the audio transcripts of the eleventh interview suggested a recycling of ideas that had been presented by informants in earlier interviews, indicating the potential that no new information would be collected with further interviews. Furthermore, this number is more than the minimum recommended by McCracken (1988), and fewer interviews have been used successfully to interpret consumer experiences (e.g., Fournier 1998; Schouten 1991; Thompson 1996). Informants were purposively sampled to offer a cross‐section of Asante society (see table 1 for informant profiles). Based on their incomes, occupations, living conditions, and other interviewer observations, informants were classified into three social classes based on local living standards. Two of the informants had been bereaved within the six‐month period preceding the interviews. The rest had been bereaved within the past five years and had been actively involved in the production of the relevant death ritual. Each informant was told only that this was a study of Asante death rituals, and none received payment for participating in the study.<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>Following McCracken (1988), interviews begun with “grand tour” questions around the informants’ knowledge of the way funerals are conducted in Asante, their perceptions of changes in funeral products, and their general views about death. After questions about the general nature and conduct of Asante death activities, informants were asked to recount details of their own bereavement experiences and how they and their families arrived at the purchase decisions they made for the ensuing ritual. In the course of data gathering, interview tapes were reviewed regularly in order to guide, but not necessarily restrict, the foci of future interviews (Schouten 1991). This reading improved researcher familiarity with the data, thereby facilitating “meaning discrimination” and the expression of the essence of death‐ritual consumption among the Asante (Giorgi 1997, p. 246).</p>
         <p>Cultural analysis was used in interpreting data. Interview data were examined for common themes across informants that categorized how the Asante make sense of death and take advantage of the occasion of death, especially those aspects bearing on identity negotiations and on the role of ritual artifacts and performances in social communication. This approach was based on the view that informants’ stories express themes by which conceptions about death‐related consumption phenomena are negotiated, through reflections on consumption experiences and choices (Thompson 1997, p. 442). Multiple readings of the complete data transcripts followed data gathering before any analysis began in order to facilitate thematization at a global level within the data (Giorgi 1997). Analysis began with a close reading of the verbatim transcripts in the local language, in an effort to constitute our interpretations in a specific historical and sociocultural context (Dilthey 1977). Secondary information sources on the Asante were used as supplementary material to provide a broader basis for interpretation.</p>
         <p>The Asante language employs various techniques of prose and poetry to enliven spoken and written texts. Thus, “what can be said with imagery is never said in plain tongue; what a proverb can make plain is never stated as fact” (Duodu 1999, n.p.). Informants’ narratives were often laced with proverbs and metaphors that would make sense only to those who had been immersed into the Asante culture and language. In the interests of brevity, we limit our use of such imagery‐laden interview excerpts in this article in order to avoid having to transform informant comments into “plain” text to render them interpretable for the reader. The few proverbs and other local images used are not always translated literally but are instead rendered in a fashion that communicates the essence of the particular text.</p>
         <p>We observed at a general level of interpretation that our interview data support the research assumption that informants had been enculturated into a similar set of social circumstances, share a common set of death‐related consumption experiences and expectations, and have been socialized into yet another common set of cultural beliefs about death and its linkages to Asante social life. Throughout the interviews, informants indicated the elaborate nature of Asante death rituals and suggested that death‐ritual activities are designed as competitive expressions of social status and family identities. The following findings suggest how death‐ritual consumption is situated to support Asante sociocultural dynamics.</p>

         <title>Asante Death‐Ritual Consumption</title>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>Research Site</title>
            <p>The Asante of Ghana inhabit an area about one‐third the size of England and make up 15% of Ghana’s population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                         xlink:href="http://www.ghanaweb.com"
                         xlink:type="simple">http://www.ghanaweb.com</ext-link>). The term “Asante” may be used to refer to the people or their location and culture. The society offers an interesting research site by reason of its openness about death‐related issues and its elaborate display of material wealth during death‐ritual performances (Arhin 1994; Rattray 1927). Bereaved Asante consumers may spend the equivalent of US$2,000 on death rituals, in a country that has consistently ranked among the world’s poorest, with a per capita annual GDP of about US$400 (see World Bank’s World Development Reports for the years 1980–2000). The context, therefore, challenges the oft‐assumed view that poverty leads to frugality and carefully considered consumption choices based on financial resources (e.g., Dholakia, Sharif, and Bhandari 1988). Asante final rites are draped in symbolism, decipherable within judgments and motives constituted in local culture. They are scripted into miniparts such as family gathering on the eighth day after a death, wake, and burial, all culminating in the funeral.</p>
            <p>The funeral is the main “event” in Asante death‐ritual performance. As in any ritualized potlatch (Bell 1997; Codere 1950), the funeral is highly scripted with stipulations for seating arrangements, choice of clothing, music, and the order of activities, among others. The seeming chaotic ambience accompanying the music and dancing that often begins the funeral gives way to a well‐orchestrated performance (Busia 1968; Rattray 1927) after bereaved persons are seated in their designated areas. Prominent people who attend the funeral are given elaborate verbal recognition as their presence is announced over loudspeakers amid accolades. A unique aspect of Asante funerals is the public announcement of the donations that participants make to the bereaved to help them defray the cost of death rituals. Rooted in the communal support of one another in times of difficulty, this ritual order was designed to ensure that the bereaved is left with little or no debt relating to the funeral (Rattray 1927). But it has been transformed into an avenue for conspicuous consumption in which ritual participants compete with one another (Arhin 1994). Drumming, dancing, drinking, and announcement of gifts to the deceased and the bereaved dominate the remainder of the funeral, which lasts anywhere from two to eight hours.</p>

            <title>Intergenerational Exchanges</title>
            <p>Intergenerational exchanges in the consumer behavior literature have often been discussed in the context of the transfer of tangible possessions that may have intangible meanings for the giver and the recipient (e.g., Kates 2001; Price, Arnould, and Curasi 2000). Our data suggest other forms of intergenerational exchanges that have not been considered in the consumer research literature. These exchanges were articulated in narratives that described the necessity for mutual support at various levels of social relationships in Asante.</p>

               <title>All in the Family: The Dead and the Living.</title>
               <p>The literature on attitudes toward death in Western cultures indicates that people in this part of the world fear death and go to extreme lengths to delay its occurrence (Aries 1974; Baudrillard 1993). In contrast, Asante informants expressed little fear of death, recognizing that they have to die in order to become powerful ancestors. Informants noted that families make little or no effort to mobilize the relevant resources to help a struggling or sick relative recover. As soon as the relative dies, however, the family gets together to plan and produce an elaborate funeral.</p>
               <p>
                  <speech>
                     <speaker>Badu: </speaker>
                     <p>[talking about an uncle who had died after a short illness] Of course, I was sad, but that is life, the time had come for him to go. I heard that he couldn’t afford to pay for some of the medicines that he needed. I would have helped but I heard it too late. We were very sad that he had to die that way [long pause]. Bro, if we have to dwell on the causes of death around here, we will be crying all the time. Let’s put it this way: even if we had given him the money, he would have died anyway. We knew it wasn’t our fault that he died. We had to borrow money for his funeral. We did our best to give him a decent burial and funeral.</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>In this narrative, Badu admits to having failed to support an uncle in dire need of support to stay alive. She defends her actions by suggesting, in part, that delaying death was beyond her powers after all, as she and other informants noted, “A hunter does not discriminate among his prey on the basis of illness,” a proverb meaning that when death catches up with you there is no room for him to pass you by. It stands to reason then that exchanges among the living are not as strong as those between the living and the dead in Asante. Informants did not perceive battling sickness or ill fate in life as a significant avenue for meeting social obligations and that it offered little avenue for the willful pursuit of identity aspirations. Thus, people may be willing to delay gratification until such time that consumption promises the most social benefits, as on the occasion of death. Indeed, all informants quoted a proverb “Abusua do efunu” (The family loves the dead) in context to support this stance.</p>
               <p>In addition to the obvious fatalism in Badu’s comments, she also suggests that individuals are fully responsible for themselves and their lives, but the family is responsible to and for the dead. Within the structure of Asante eschatology, this viewpoint reflects the dynamics of the exchange among the living, the dead, and other spiritual beings in Asante cosmology. The Asante believe in the predestination of the living—that a person’s life course is predetermined by <italic>Onyankopon</italic> (Supreme Being) before birth (Gyekye 1995). Not rushing to aid dying relatives may be their way of helping the dying to achieve their destinies. The fulfillment of a happy destiny is not automatic. One has to learn and put into practice the moral requirements of Asante society such as respect for elders and ancestors, otherwise one could fall sick and die. Thus, a sick person may be viewed as receiving punishment from the ancestors for violating some accepted kinship or other social rules (Appiah‐Kubi 1981).</p>
               <p>The postdeath power structure that supports this system puts ancestors next in line to the deities who report directly to the ultimate authorities, <italic>Onyankopon</italic> and his wife, Mother Earth (<italic>Asaase Yaa</italic>) (Gyekye 1995; Rattray 1927). To qualify as an ancestor upon death, one must have led a good life, recognizing all relevant rules of justice and social interactions. By virtue of their position, ancestors are believed to have the power to directly control the affairs of the living. They reward those who exhibit good behavior and adherence to traditional laws of existence and punish those who violate social norms and rules. Rewards include assurance of the living’s health, wealth, fertility, and protection from evil spiritual principalities (Appiah‐Kubi 1981). Confident in the power of ancestors and the belief that “The Great Creator—<italic>Oboadee</italic>—created death only to become a victim of his own creation” (a proverb quoted by all but one informant), informants reinforced the Asante philosophical view that death is an inevitable aspect of life—all life, even that of the creator of death.</p>
               <p>In the following passage, Nana offers a representative viewpoint expressed by all informants on welcoming death and the goal, as he put it, to “make the ancestors happy through funeral celebrations.”</p>

                     <speaker>Nana: </speaker>
                     <p>When someone dies, he is not quite dead. We need them [ancestors] to protect us. They may have lived a difficult life on earth. Death brings an end to all of the pain and suffering, and [creates] the power to help us. We should be happy for the dead. We should help them as best as we can even after they leave us. You know, they, er, what better way to make them happy than to recognize their presence and to pour libation to them every now and then? Talk to them. They are all around us because <italic>Onyankopon Kwame</italic> [God Almighty] has made it so. We have to respect the ancestors so that we can all live together in peace.</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>Nana notes the continual symbiotic exchange relationship between the living and the dead. If both communities live up to their ends of the bargain, the living will depend on the ancestors for children, higher crop yields, good health, and protection from all manner of negative effects in their lives, while the deceased gets respect and continued presence in the community of the living. Given that a person’s worth is measured in terms of personal, social, and ancestral relationships, along with the number of children she or he has and their stations in life (Aborampah 1999; Appiah‐Kubi 1981), it seems that social harmony in Asante derives from the mutual respect extended between the communities of the living and the ever‐present dead.</p>
               <p>Having been socialized into this traditional system, informants signaled a strong cultural obligation for adherence to the general rules of family relationships such as reverence for age, aggrandization of ancestors, and solidarity among family members. With ancestral and other social pressures to conform, some have acted against their individual value systems in order to maintain or enhance their family’s social stature. Informants related how the pressure sometimes causes them to sacrifice their individual preferences in favor of the collective.</p>

                  <speech>
                     <speaker>Boafo: </speaker>
                     <p>Things have changed a lot. … Oh, funerals, today’s funerals are very beautiful [pauses] and very expensive. I think they do not reflect our culture. When I complain, people call me “old timer” [long silence]. If I had the resources, that, well, that is what I would do for each of my dear relatives. After all, it is important that we do that in remembrance of our departed ones. … Of course, I don’t agree with the recent changes but if I don’t support them in public, I will be called names. … Let’s just say it won’t help me to fight the changes.</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>In the broader context of the interview, it became clear that what was important to Boafo was the need to use funerals subtly as competitive expressions of status through material and symbolic consumption choices. He indicated that it was necessary for the bereaved to publicly tout positive images of their dead for social benefit in efforts to maintain their good relationship with the deceased. Indicating a preference for the maintenance of tradition, Boafo noted that the funeral had been commodified excessively toward a focus on the bereaved rather than on the deceased. He had also resigned himself to the fact that he could do nothing about this trend as his efforts to stop the changes could lead to social ostracism, a severe sanction in a society where one’s survival depends on social relationships. Boafo’s comments indicate a vivid sense of obligation, sanction, and social prescription for the bereaved to stage elaborate funerals in honor of the deceased and, by association, in honor of the bereaved.</p>
               <p>Boafo’s comments, along with those of other informants, suggest that death rituals in Asante have not been spared the wave of globalization that supports cultural changes around the world. As Asante emigrants have returned home for their relatives’ funerals, they have carried with them some of the consumption practices in their foreign countries of residence such as imported clothing and hearses. The increasing adoption of these new consumption forms into the death‐ritual code is facilitated by the fact that access to Western material and cultural capital has become an important marker of status (Appiah 1992). Thus, many are pursuing imported funeral goods at the expense of tradition. Boafo recognizes the gradual and subtle change in the ritual code and bemoans the movement away from tradition. Nonetheless, he allowed his need for harmonious social relationships to override his individual objections, suggesting that dissent could lead to family disunity and the wrath of the ancestors.</p>
               <p>In a sense, this observation parallels Warner’s (1959) examination of the exchanges between the living and the dead in 1950s America. The Asante situation, however, differs both in the explicit anthropomorphism of the dead and in that family structure brings together the living and the dead, and feeds the collective identity pursuits of bereaved persons. The preservation of unity is highly promoted in the melded communities of the living and the dead, amid strict behavioral prohibitions such as those proscribing public expression of dissent among family members. Analogous to the macrosocietal structure discussed by Thompson and Haytko (1997, p. 36), Asante family relationships provide an overarching background to “systems of cultural discourses and the idiographic meanings that consumers construct from them.” While negotiations for Western symbolic immortality may be pursued for the benefit of an individual consumer, individuals in Asante may find it difficult to divorce their identities from those of their kinfolk. Strong familial obligations and the fear of ancestral punishment (e.g., infertility, poor crop yield, lack of family prosperity) for social deviance or ritual violations, encourage the bereaved to lay claim to positive social symbolic entitlements on behalf of the deceased through death‐ritual consumption choices. This is similar to the continuing reciprocal relationship with ancestors to whom sacrifices are made in other cultures such as China (Zhao and Belk 2002).</p>

               <title>Remnants of Honey.</title>
               <p>Much like their Western counterparts (Gordon 1984; Parkes 1998), the bereaved in Asante and other African societies may use death and death rituals in pursuit of their own goals (Arhin 1994). While supporting this observation, our informants noted that the emphasis in Asante death rituals is still placed on refining the social image of the deceased. Even so, social benefits (and costs) arising out death‐ritual consumption are not equally shared between the deceased and the bereaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <speech>
                     <speaker>Badu: </speaker>
                     <p>Bro, “A person who draws honey from a hive for another gets to lick whatever is left on his/her fingers” [proverb]. We have to take care of our dead as custom demands but I am sure we will not do things the way we do if we didn’t get something from it. … People will tell you they do this for the deceased, true. But for me, I think we do it also for ourselves too.</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>In this narrative, Badu identified honoring the dead as the primary motive for death rituals, likening such efforts to harvesting honey for someone else. The outcome of this effort is symbolized in the harvester (the bereaved) playing second fiddle to the master (the deceased) when it comes to distribution of benefits. At worst, the bereaved will get the sweet taste of honey residue left on the fingers. Harvesting wild honey in Asante is no easy task. It is replete with tremendous danger, requiring tactical planning and both aggression and tenderness if the harvester is to avoid the poisonous stings of the African bees. By this specific reference, Badu pointed to the necessary risks (e.g., borrowing that could leave a major financial dent in the family) to bring honor to the deceased, and that may leave significant residue of social status for the bereaved. Badu reinforced the symbiotic relationship between the living and the dead, and that the social needs of the deceased should be placed above those of the living. By so doing, the bereaved benefits from the show of how they present their dead publicly.</p>
               <p>Like Badu, our other informants related the need for them to play second fiddle to their dead in any pursuit of their own consumption motives through death rituals and suggested that benefits accruing to the bereaved from Asante death rituals be derived primarily from a strategic presentation of the deceased in public. This indicates a structure for the distribution of benefits to the family, with the deceased being granted first refusal. Even so, there is no clear outline of where the benefits of the deceased end and those for the bereaved begin, thereby allowing the bereaved ample opportunity to subtly manipulate these rituals to their own advantage under the guise of serving the dead. For example, during our 130‐minute interview with Prempeh, he made 12 references to the effect that he hopes his relatives look at the funerals he has been throwing and give him a similar farewell later on his passing. This respondent is obviously expressing his death‐ritual preferences to the living community and hence laying the grounds for his own grand funeral under the auspices of his deceased relatives.</p>
               <p>Various informants noted that they used outward expression of amicable social relationships in the community in pursuit of their own consumption goals synchronously with symbolic dialogue about the identities of their dead. This was most evident in discussions that revolved around parent‐children relationships.</p>

               <p>In Asante where a person’s worth may be measured in part by the number of his or her children and their stations in life (Aborampah 1999), it is important for children to make conspicuous those ritual items that represent their own successes, as they seek social benefits for their deceased parents and themselves through consumption. Custom suggests that children choose certain ritual artifacts such as caskets and, in some cases, clothing for their parents. Orphaned children may make choices that indicate a positive relationship with the parent even if it means assuming significant financial risks. The ritual artifacts that are publicly presented and the perceived expense associated with them may also represent to the community how much social and material investment the parent made in the children. By making their dead father the focus of the good funeral, Manu tells the ritual participants that she and her siblings are respectable members of society by laying claim to the symbolic entitlements represented in the honor they bestowed on their father. For instance, through the American suit they bought for their father, we observe the children’s excellent relationship with their father in life and a mutually beneficial exchange within the community of the living where parents are expected to take good care of their children in exchange for memorable funerals in the future. This subtle pursuit of posthumous social recognition through death rituals encourages people to lead good lives and to maintain strong bonds with their kinfolk. Granted that a poor funeral production is often perceived as a sign of strained family relationships, both the deceased and the bereaved may suffer social reprisals for such production. It is perhaps for this reason that the bereaved throws an elaborate funeral even when the deceased did not merit one.</p>

                     <p>Oh yes. As for me, I say things “plain, plain.” You see, because when one dies, especially a man, it is his children who “lift him off the ground.” If a man dies and his children are not able to mobilize the family for his funeral, it is quite pitiful. The man is dead and gone to his maker. The children will bear the brunt for the dead man. [Reacting to interviewer’s facial expression, she notes] … yes, people will, when they try to offer their views on how things should be done in the village, people will tell them to shut up, because some will say “oh, shut up, we saw what you can do when your mother/father died.”</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>As Akyia notes, a poorly organized funeral may be translated into public disregard for one’s opinion in the community. It results in social stigmatization, and people might insult the family on the basis of how they treat their dead. One may deduce from Akyia’s comment that negative outcome of death rituals are also unequally shared between the bereaved and the deceased, with the bereaved receiving the larger proportion. In this specific context, funeral production tends to define the bereaved on the basis of potential contribution to society and the skills with which they carry out these obligations and contributions. Although our informants provided no logical basis to suggest that one who did a poor job of making the deceased the center of ritual activities lacks social skills and material wealth, this is precisely the sort of negative attribution they all made about an offending family. The poor funeral production then speaks to the perceived poor social skills of the bereaved and the need for those in the community of the living to be careful in their interactions with such a person or family.</p>
               <p>These observations lead us to conclude that the deceased is often the focus of Asante funerals and that social benefits resulting from the ritual are not equally shared between the bereaved and the deceased. On the one hand, positive outcomes from death‐ritual consumption are attributed first to the deceased before trickling down to the bereaved. The bereaved’s benefits derive primarily from how they present their dead to the public. Negative outcomes, on the other hand, affect the bereaved more directly. Where the bereaved makes a conscious effort to outstage the deceased, social reprisals in the form of insults and disregard for the bereaved’s opinions in social discussion results, relegating the bereaved into a second‐class citizen. Toward the end of avoiding a negative dent in the family reputation, the bereaved makes the deceased the center of attraction of death rituals and purposefully consumes ritual products for such effect. Ultimately, this situation forces a harmonious relationship among all relatives and a willingness on the part of the living to share tangible and intangible assets with all in the family—dead or alive—and encourages the bereaved to pursue effective ways of publicly presenting their dead.</p>

            <title>Constructing Postmortem Identities</title>
            <p>One of the main uses of death rituals in Asante is to negotiate social identities of deceased persons through the conspicuous expression of material and symbolic wealth. Unlike Hirschman’s (1990) observation of affluent consumers in America, postmortem identity for the average Asante is not always defined by the consumer prior to his or her own death. It may be achieved when others publicly present the dead consumer in a manner consistent with societal expectations of what constitutes an honorable funeral for colleagues of comparable or higher social status. Informants noted the need for preserving a socially acceptable image for the deceased through death rituals, whether or not the person lived a “good” life. “Good” and “bad” also correspond to the two major categories of funerals in Asante, depending on the perceived material and other investments made in the ritual (Sarpong 1974, p. 29). Through material and symbolic consumption, a deceased person’s identity may be renegotiated in death. The deceased’s status in life may be underplayed or even overlooked in shaping postmortem identity if the funeral has identity‐defining aspects that are consistent with a well‐lived life.</p>

                  <p>Did you hear about the funeral of Kwaku’s mother? [Kwaku is a pseudonym]. It is better for you to have seen it rather than me telling you about it. It’s been quite a while but everybody still talks about it. You could see throughout that “yes,” this is a woman who “lived.” The hearse, the casket, the people, the music, the people, wow. Probably this funeral coming up [referring to the impending funeral of the Asantehene, King of Asante, who had died a few weeks before the interview] will be the only one to surpass Kwaku’s. … When my mother died, we went to a lot of trouble to prepare her extremely well for her “laying [<italic>sic</italic>] in state”—public viewing—far beyond the basic requirements. … The children, those who had come home from abroad, the things they brought with them, the balloons that were used, and how the old lady was presented to the public, people were saying that when her children were coming, they brought an expert mortician from America to take care of the display and viewing.</p>

                  <p>Well, hmm, I, no, but I wasn’t going to try and change that [laughs]. Those who heard liked the idea, and sure, the old lady was being honored far in excess of our expectations [laughs]. So, if you want to know, that is what happened.</p>
               </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Kwaku’s family seems to have presented a funeral production that Diana thinks is commensurate with the type of life that the deceased lady led, even though Diana admitted that she never met the deceased in life. Diana’s frame of reference for coming to her conclusion about the deceased must have been the elaborate nature of her death rituals and the prominence of the bereaved family. She contrasts the funeral of Kwaku’s mother to the impending funeral of the Asantehene. The contrast draws on a system of everyday Asante life that is embodied in hierarchical social reputations and suggests that the woman’s funeral had virtually transformed her into royalty after her death. Although elaborate funerals are often believed to exaggerate the deceased’s social status in conformity with the bereaved’s identity perceptions (Lawuyi 1991), Diana views this one as an authentic representation of the deceased’s lived experience. It is safe then to suggest that where ritual participants do not know the deceased or the reputation of the bereaved family, they will form their opinions about the deceased and their family on the basis of the nature of the funeral that is organized in their honor. Since anyone may attend a funeral without invitation and this is considered a part of being a good member of society, it is likely that many in attendance did not personally know the deceased and would have come to similar conclusions about the deceased’s life and status as Diana did.</p>
            <p>Diana takes advantage of this and the contrast between good and bad funerals to define her mother’s social image by exploiting a false rumor about the American source of expertise employed in the funeral to make the ritual better than “good.” This is facilitated by the fact that economic conditions in Asante preclude many from traveling to the Western world. Thus, having relatives in these parts of the world inflates the social image of the relevant family in the local community. Public demonstration of the bereaved family’s access to Western capital contributes to social attribution of life successes, and hence to enhanced social status for the deceased. The false rumor about having used expertise from America, therefore, identifies the tastes of Diana’s mother as reflected in her family’s ritual choices because the deceased presumably nurtured these tastes.</p>
            <p>Other informants noted how they plan to appropriate the symbolic entitlements presented by access to Western cultural and material capital—however achieved—through death rituals.</p>

                  <p>Today, the name of the game is this new car [a hearse]. They tell me it is used in your country [referring to the U.S.]. … This car is also comfortable for the deceased. It catches a lot of attention. At my age, I do not pay a lot of attention to funerals that do not concern me, but when it has one of those cars, I ask about the funeral. I may even attend to see who it is. Well, that is not the only reason I will attend a funeral [pause] but, that [the hearse] is for big men. You have to be prominent to afford such a thing. When you use that, you become one of the people in your country. … I have told my children and nephews that I will come back and haunt them if they let me go without one of those, I mean the car. They cannot replace it with a flashy casket. I know I will rest peacefully once I have ridden in that car [laughs].</p>
               </speech>
            </p>
            <p>This narrative invokes novel foreign products as sources of ritual code alterations in the dynamics of Asante class and social status. Donko, whose living conditions suggested that he came from a poor background, notes the potential for him to get a “complete” life only after he has ridden in an imported hearse. He has resigned himself to the fact that he cannot achieve social recognition in life. However, he observes the potential to move up in social class upon his death through access to a distinctly Western product—the hearse. He is hopeful that his relatives’ beliefs in ancestral control over the living will convince them to give him such a ride toward this end. Levinson (1978) notes that people maintain stable identities in life while aspiring to identity ideals that die with them. Donko contradicts this viewpoint as he expects his aspirations for higher social status to be achieved not in life but after his death.</p>

               <title>The Blood of the Tortoise.</title>
               <p>Although the Asante people are open to excess in material display of wealth during death rituals, there is the need for restraint in the use of these resources. One informant (Pokuah) captured this implicit reality for modesty when she noted in a proverb that “If you seek a lot of blood in a tortoise, it will have to be diluted with water.” Literally, the tortoise is a very small animal and so can only be expected to have a limited volume of blood. Thus, any one presenting a large volume of blood from a tortoise would have had to introduce foreign elements into the liquid to do so. In its metaphorical context, the proverb suggests that those who display excessive material wealth for the sake of their dead may end up with insults and not the high social repute they sought through such consumption because the community may view such display as an exaggeration. In the context of Pokuah’s comment, the proverb related to the distinction between financial/material wealth and social wealth, in consistency with the contrast that Arnould (1989) found between the concepts of <italic>arzikin mutane</italic> (wealth in people) and <italic>arzikin kud’i</italic> (money wealth) in his study of consumption in Niger. Pokuah alluded to excesses being present in financial/material wealth and that for best negotiation results, bereaved consumers may focus on social wealth—noticeable manifestations of investment in social relationships—that which one can never have too much. Thus, while excesses in the public display of material wealth may dilute the authenticity of the family’s claims during death rituals, social wealth displays add to such authenticity. Presenting a small volume of blood in a tortoise is, therefore, more effective in negotiating postmortem identities.</p>
               <p>Various informants backed up Pokuah on this point, suggesting the use of symbolic emblems of life successes (social wealth), rather than material resources, to negotiate newer identities for their dead and themselves during death rituals.</p>

                     <p>When your loved one dies, you expect that people will attend the funeral. We are not as concerned with the money that is raised, that is the donations that people make. We are more interested in the number of people who attend the funeral. I am not saying that we do not like the money. We do, absolutely. However, the people, people often say “the funeral came” [meaning there were too many people at the funeral]. We all hope that the funeral for the person is like the marketplace at its peak, not enough standing room even.</p>

                     <p>[with reference to a funeral in his hometown]. She was laid in public in a very large bed and they placed a lot of very expensive items of lace and gold on the casket when it was set in the room before the procession to the burial grounds. If you saw how they re‐did the room, the floors, the walls, the decorations, you will be surprised, very surprised. I know they wanted the best for the old lady but people started saying that “their wealth had led the family to madness.”</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>Annoh's and Prempeh’s narratives point to the need for blending material wealth and symbolic nonmaterial dimensions of consumption in balance to get the desired positive effect. Along with Pokuah, these informants suggested that there is no such thing as an excess display of social wealth represented in the people at the funeral, but there can be imbalances between displays of material wealth and social capital, if, for instance, there is an elaborate funeral attended by a few people. Such imbalance can have a significant negative effect on the bereaved family’s death‐ritual consumption goals, as reflected in Annoh’s comment. Annoh and the “people” he refers to didn’t like the imbalance proffered by the bereaved family, and they castigated the bereaved for excessive display of material wealth. It is perhaps the social penchant for indulgence in the subtleties of nonmaterial consumption in death rituals that fueled Prempeh’s clear preference for crowded funerals over economic extravagance. He associates the number of people at a funeral with high social status, because it indicates the deceased’s social, nonmaterial wealth manifested in meeting one’s social obligations in life (Arhin 1994).</p>
               <p>These observations temper the supremacy of materialism as an established cultural value that underlies displays of consumer wealth, identity, and the pursuit of consumer happiness (Scitovsky 1992). Prempeh and other informants noted that having a large number of people attending a funeral is a more visible representation of the deceased’s and their relatives’ stature in the community than the quantity of consumption artifacts displayed. Informants also noted that contrary to expectations, funerals that are well attended often generate very little financial contribution from participants, implying that the public would perceive the bereaved family as bearing the large cost needed to cater to the food and other needs of ritual participants. This may be due to the greater opportunity to be a “free rider” in such circumstances, just as larger groups eating in a restaurant tip less per person. In these subtle ways, symbolic public expressions such as wide community participation at a funeral communicate both financial and social wealth.</p>
               <p>Indeed our two wealthiest informants indicated their preferences for small and memorable funerals, along with a deep‐rooted pursuit of distinction in tastes and choices. One of them, Nana, adopted a unique way to help his deceased relative gain access to the symbolic entitlements in their ritual consumption.</p>

When we came back to welcome sympathizers, we wore whites to indicate our joy for her peaceful death. … This was before everybody started wearing white. … I suggested to the family that we keep it [the funeral] small and simple. They agreed. … People talked about us not using the car, the black and red cloth, etc. You see, I like that. Our old lady was not an ordinary person and so we didn’t want her funeral to be ordinary. … Today, you see a lot of people wearing whites. I am ready to go back to black and red [laughs].</p>
                  </speech>
               </p>
               <p>In addition to consumption trend setting as an identity differentiation strategy (e.g., Bourdieu 1984; Campbell 1987), Nana uses nonconsumption to set his family apart. While he and his family have the resources to buy whatever they may wish for their deceased, Nana notes the benefits of material consumption avoidance to reaffirm his loved one’s community reputation. Part of Nana’s consumption goals was to establish his family as innovative consumers, through easily identifiable changes in the ritual order. He succeeded in this effort and seems to revel in the thought that his family’s changes to the ritual order have come to be recognized as the norm. Nana notes that his relative, being one who was not “ordinary,” required extraordinary consumption choices to assert her place in the social structure. This avoidance of consumption is in line with Wilk’s (1997) observation that consumer decisions of what not to consume contribute immensely to their identity‐negotiation strategies. Nana’s goal in this context, it seems, was to make loud identity statements by not consuming what everyone else viewed as symbolic representations of the good life, although he and his family could afford the expense.</p>
               <p>In sum, the bereaved in Asante use death rituals as avenues for fashioning newer identities for themselves and their dead through a careful balance of material and nonmaterial resources. While there can be no excesses in social wealth, there is a chance for material excesses and associated negative social implications. Asante consumers with high economic and other consumption capital seemingly spend less on funerals, while those lacking such capital attempt to substitute borrowed financial capital to call attention to themselves and their dead.</p>

            <title>Struggle over Capital: Local versus Global</title>
            <p>Constituting death rituals into forms of acceptable consumption capital—cultural, economic, or social (Bourdieu 1984)—manifested itself as part of the consumer struggle within the dynamics of Asante social class and status. Our informants exhibited forms of social structuring in death‐ritual consumption through narratives that outlined the boundaries of movements in meaning for various forms of capital, especially those who pitted what we are calling local capital against global capital. We focus this section on an excerpt from our interview with Akyia. Her narrative about the death ritual for an aunt captures the essence of what other informants reported about local versus global sources of capital (in its various forms) as well. At the time of the interview, Akyia was a 57‐year‐old widowed mother of five, who was the female head of her family. At the customary family gathering to plan Akyia’s deceased aunt’s funeral, the eldest daughter of the deceased told the family that she wanted no collective efforts toward her mother’s death ritual. Akyia continued:<disp-quote>
                  <p>We tried everything possible to change her [the eldest daughter of the deceased’s] mind but she insisted saying that she wanted the biological children to work on their collective functions and the rest of the family [especially those who had married into it] to do their own thing. You see, she was trying to prove to the world that she was much wealthier than the rest of us. … My daughter called me later asking: “mother, are we going to be able to provide all the socially acceptable things? Did you know that Mansa’s grandchild [Mansa is a pseudonym for a wealthy woman, a product of old money] has joined the other faction?” I responded: “ … Mansa, in fact, her money is now bad. These days everything is modern.” … So I went to find, hire, <italic>yaawa</italic>, a very modern <italic>yaawa</italic> [<italic>yaawa</italic> may be translated as “tray”]. I rented three of them. I didn’t want to overdo it, so I rented small ones for the various arrangements—those items needed for bathing the dead—and arranged them nicely. That evening, I took it to the family home. I included about 20 lemons. … [Later the orphaned woman’s] eldest daughter came up to me … [and said,] “is there any way I can borrow your <italic>yaawa</italic>, the one that had the lemons, please?” She didn’t even know that lemons were offered to older people when they died. Look, that was the beauty of it! In my head, I was very happy. I said to myself, “First of all, I am ahead of the race. I am doing better than you and your mother tonight. I will do the same, remain ahead tomorrow morning and in the afternoon and every other time.” … “What someone doesn’t know, someone else teaches” [proverb]. You may have a lot of money, but you do not know what to do with the money at the appropriate time. … Eventually everything was set and we left for the funeral grounds. … As we sat there, [a] friend said, “Akyia, one of the daughters will be presenting a mat and a pillow.” I replied, “Adwoa, be patient, I am not going to include those things, but I will know what to say when I get into the middle of the gathering.” Those who met me on the way to the [funeral] grounds told me no one could compete with me on account of the things I was presenting. … As we entered the place, the <italic>yaawa</italic>, when you look at it, it shines in your eyes: “So, so, so.” The bandsmen started saying over the loudspeaker, “… the one coming is not from this earth. It is very bright, as bright as the sun, fire.” I personally went to address the gathering, and I said, “As for me, I, no, this is not the appropriate place to spread a mat for the old lady, before she was put on her bed, she had to be put on a mat. As a result, as for me, I did not carry a mat and blanket here.” The crowd was charged. You could hear them cheering “yee” [laughs]. At this point, it became apparent to me that whatever the elder daughter was presenting was going to be useless, there was no point. … The people at the funeral shouted “yee.” Well, at this point the woman who insisted on separate activities, her things were coming in like, er, a “chain,” put together haphazardly. The one speaking to the crowd didn’t know how to speak. The one who my daughter was afraid might “beat” us, her things were not even close, as for Mansa’s grandchild, if she were salt, she wouldn’t be tasted at all in the food [laughs].</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Akyia’s story exemplifies the frequent competitive struggle for popularity and patterns of public display that demonstrate what one is through nondeath rituals (Arhin 1994; Lawuyi 1991). The story, along with comments from other informants, shows how consumers employ ritual artifacts as strategic instruments in a broader perceived social competition that pits rich versus poor and local versus global. While she failed to directly acknowledge it, Akyia seemed to have realized the potential threat to her family’s reputation as a result of the challenge posed by the younger woman who asked for individual rather than familial efforts. This woman had more money and better access to Western cultural capital because she once lived in the United States. The woman’s call for a separation of responsibilities for the funeral had the potential to reflect negatively on Akyia and her family, especially because the latter did not have the necessary global economic and cultural capital that the wealthier woman was attempting to convert into local sociocultural capital. But Akyia did not need to make such a conversion because her local cultural and social capital, consisting of knowledge of traditional ritual and skills at speaking to a crowd, were strong. In Akyia’s account her own local capital was more than sufficient to overcome the superior global capital of her rival.</p>
            <p>Akyia’s persistent pursuit of social victory over her rival is consistent with Lawuyi’s (1991) view that death rituals offer opportunities for decisive overpowering and defeat of one’s enemies in public. Her tone of voice and laughter through the storytelling signaled the excitement and joy she derives from a simple recounting of the story. This was in spite of the fact that the incident happened several years earlier. Her metaphorical use of faded salt in reference to Mansa (relegating her to persona non grata status in this matter) seals Akyia’s decisive victory as she recognizes the tremendous hurdle she was up against and her skills at mustering the relevant local resources to win the challenge. The struggle to forcefully incorporate local cultural capital into her ritual production influenced her skillful insertion of novel ideas into the ritual order, as replacements for established expressions of social power and gives a distinctive potency to this form of capital in the reproduction of the modern and traditional within the context of the global.</p>
            <p>The presence but limited availability of imported death products—hearses, caskets, and so on—in Asante would suggest a democratization of desire, if not consumption and identity negotiations. Thus, consumers like Akyia might use all avenues open to them to acquire and use the same goods and services as the wealthy (the orphaned woman in this case) in the context of Asante death rituals (Arhin 1994). Other informants exhibited this behavior as in Manu’s family purchase of an Armani suit from America for her deceased father and in Donko’s expected ride in an imported hearse. While all classes of consumers may use similar goods and services in their death rituals, those with global capital typically attempt to convert economic wealth into local cultural and social capital (Holt 1997, 1998). As Akyia’s story demonstrates, there are limits regarding the use of global capital in Asante social contexts, especially when they are pitted against local capital. For Akyia, such an approach would mean engaging in a symbolic bout with global economic and cultural capital and would have led to her losing this competition.</p>
            <p>Recognizing her inability to compete on the basis of global consumption, Akyia determined that an effective way to stay ahead in this challenge was to subtly manipulate public opinion in her favor by emphasizing the limitations of global capital. Akyia, who had little economic or global cultural capital, was able to compete successfully using local cultural capital (plate of lemons, skillful address of audiences, local cloth) and social capital (her local support network and the numbers who turned out for the funeral). While recognizing the impact of global capital on Asante death‐ritual consumption, Akyia instituted a form of creolization that gave her local inputs an advantage over the global. Families striving for the “good” funeral for their deceased can, therefore, potentially counter the forces of globalization and the power of nonlocal wealth through the effective use of local capital, which often embodies nonfinancial symbolic representations of life successes in Asante. In this respect Akyia’s case may be a contemporary instantiation of differing spheres of exchange involving special monies in other African societies (e.g., Shipton 1989; Weiss 1996).</p>

            <p>Our analysis of Asante death‐ritual behavior, organized into three descriptive motifs of symbolic consumption of the dead—intergenerational exchanges, constructing postmortem identities, and struggle for capital—suggests that death rituals require certain exchange dynamics, the least of which is the purchase of ritual artifacts. Our evidence shows that social exchanges during death rituals are imbued with symbolic representations that allow the living and the dead to vicariously consume relevant products as expressions of their aspirational selves. Death in Asante indicates the deceased’s transformation into a powerful ancestor who supports the living with children, food, and other relevant essentials. Thus, the dead are active participants in various aspects of Asante social life. The on‐going exchanges between the living and the dead are the primary drivers of consumer action in the context of Asante death rituals. Our findings are consistent with those who conceptualize death in non‐Western cultures as a source of life’s regeneration (Bloch and Parry 1982).</p>
            <p>Our observations problematize the conceptual view that a person’s identity‐construction project ceases upon death. The evidence shows that bereaved consumers make conscious efforts to reconstruct a deceased’s identity posthumously, in conformity with their perception of an acceptable level of social status for the deceased. In the Asante context, socioeconomic graces are pursued purposefully and systematically through the creation of newer social status profiles for the deceased or reaffirming their existing image where the deceased was held in high esteem prior to death. Negotiations toward this end occur through the perceived contrast of their loved one’s funeral to others’, based on assessments of tastes, consumption, and attendance. The exaggerated identity profiles of the deceased through death‐ritual consumption underscore the bereaved’s public expression of love and an affirmation of the deceased’s “good” life on earth. That the funeral givers receive status and esteem from the community parallels theories of sacrifice (e.g., Miller 1998)—the portion of the sacrifice to the gods is the smoke of the burnt offering (referring to the funeral expenditure in this case), while the portion that remains is subsequently consumed by those offering the sacrifice (the status gained by the bereaved family).</p>
            <p>In most Western societies, the social value of a person’s life, moderated by the bereaved’s relationship to the deceased, determines the intensity of grief and the extent of expenditure on the person’s funeral (Prior 1989). This is in contrast to the situation in Asante where the social value of a person may be determined posthumously and may be highly contingent on the kind of funeral the person is granted upon death. The Asante funerals’ ritualized performance before an audience of community members helps to reframe the importance of the deceased in life and death. This is facilitated through the strong and continual symbolic relationship between the living and the dead that extends identity negotiations beyond life (cf. Kastenbaum, Peyton, and Kastenbaum 1977). In general, death‐ritual consumption activities in Asante focus on making the dead look good in the eyes of the relevant community. The bereaved benefits by the extent to which they are successful at these negotiations on behalf of the deceased. The benefits derive from a winning combination of material and social wealth to yield a socially acceptable regime of consumption capital.</p>
            <p>We observe the struggle between local and global capital as a reflection of the on‐going symbolic battle among various social classes in Asante society who are vying for dominance over the symbols of social control. While global cultural capital may be converted to economic capital for local consumption (Bourdieu 1984; Hannerz 1990), there are restrictions on the value that is placed on imported capital. A person’s ability to derive the greatest benefit from essential props of social negotiations rests on the person’s high expertise in local cultural capital along with other forms of capital. In the end, death rituals in Asante are indeed the social provinces of the deceased, as efforts are made to enhance the deceased’s identity and to reinforce the reciprocal, continuing relationship between the living and the dead.</p>

            <title>Theoretical Implications</title>
            <sec id="sc4.2.1">
               <title>Identity and Terror Management.</title>
               <p>Terror‐management theory holds that out of necessity, human actors do not make death and thoughts of death salient in everyday life, as such salience would keep many preoccupied with their mortality and render them unfit to lead normal lives (Aries 1974; Becker 1973; Greenberg et al. 1986). The theory would suggest that death‐ritual consumption be a solemn, low‐key affair that supports the symbolic expulsion of death from everyday human consciousness (Baudrillard 1993). Further, if identity pursuits are effective anxiety buffers as they relate to mortality, then enhancing self‐esteem prior to mortality or mortality salience will attenuate the increased accessibility of death thoughts and hence anxiety about death (Solomon et al. 1998). A variation of this view has been expressed in the substantive theory of identity reconstruction that notes that prior to death, people may buffer their fear of death through the conspicuous display of affluence (Hirschman 1990), the careful disposition of material possessions (Price, Arnould, and Curasi 2000; Unruh 1983), or other identity‐management strategies (Giddens 1991; Levinson 1978). Once a person’s immortality is secured through consumption, the person is apt to be less anxious about death and will be able to overcome the otherwise paralyzing effects of thoughts of mortality on their lives.</p>
               <p>In contrast to this viewpoint, our evidence suggests that identity reformation and its associated implications for symbolic immortality need not be pursued by a person prior to death but may be pursued vigorously on one’s behalf after death. Furthermore, our informants indicated virtually no anxiety about death itself. Rather, we observed a high level of expressed concern about how the bereaved and their dead will be remembered by the relevant community. This is important considering that reminiscing about death rituals is one way by which some African consumers maintain memories of their dead (Walter 1996). The data also provided no evidence of an underlying tectonic current supportive of the TMT model regarding its fear of death thesis. The potential for postdeath manipulation of the deceased’s identity by the bereaved and the fact that such manipulations maintain the deceased’s presence in the community of the living facilitates the pursuit of aspirational postmortem identities. This situation allows for the ready embrace of death in Asante, as opposed to the fear of death observed in Western societies.</p>
               <p>Thus, while TMT and other viewpoints located in the Beckerian persuasion may argue that the continuity of life after death exhibited by the Asante point to a cultural worldview that mitigates the social fear of death in that society, we suggest that the Asante approach that melds the communities of the living and the dead speaks more to the competitive expression of postmortem family status and identity in Asante society than it does to the fear of death. Robin Horton and others (Gyekye 1995; Horton and Finnegan 1973) have noted the different modes of thought underlying the operational dynamics of knowledge development in societies. Through their society’s unique processes of thought and knowledge development, consumers may recognize death not as a phenomenon to fear but as part of a broader process of social regeneration and identity negotiations (Bloch and Parry 1982).</p>

               <title>Local versus Global Capital Consumption.</title>
               <p>Bourdieu (1984) identified various forms of capital—cultural, economic, and social—that serve as the primary sources of a consumer’s acceptance and competitive edge in the dynamics of class and status. In death‐ritual consumption, we observe the manipulation of these forms of capital to the advantage of the bereaved consumer, facilitated by globalization of these capitals, for example, through imported suits, hearses, and their broad symbolic cultural experience. Our findings suggest that current notions of globalization and its importance within the operation of social class and status across cultures suffer from the ideology that one form of capital may be substituted for another with ease (Bourdieu 1984; Hannerz 1990; Holt 1997). This ideology is manifested in Western multinational corporations’ marketing efforts to replace local cultural capital in developing countries with their own (Mattelart 1983, p. 38). For instance, in many poor countries where English is not widely spoken, “Coca Cola makes it a practice to advertise in English, despite the small number of English speakers in the country. For the point is not to convey information, but rather to sell Coke as a high status symbol of modernity and Western consumer culture” (Ger and Belk 1996, p. 272). Our findings question the perceived free movement of meanings and appropriations of global cultural capital into local capital in poor countries.</p>
               <p>We found resistance to foreign cultural input into death‐ritual consumption in Asante and that the sort of global capital peddled by Coca‐Cola may not be transformed easily into local cultural capital advantage for the consumer. As Arnould (1989) found in Niger, we observed that global cultural capital impacts on local forms and may lead to hybrid, acceptable forms of status‐oriented capital within the context of poverty. In these dynamics in Asante, however, we see the impact of the local cultural capital as leading to a kind of consumption that rediscovers the past to establish a newer kind of taste within “traditional” consumption, resulting in a correspondingly new form of cultural signification and power relations. Thus, there are conditions under which the foreign may not compete successfully with the local in terms of granting the consumer a higher grade on the social ladder, even if the global modifies the local (Wilk 1995). These boundary conditions shift continually in response to the dynamics of societal cultural swapping (Oswald 1994) and other sources of input. Marketing firms venturing into these poorer environments may be more successful by focusing on blending the local and the foreign (Miller 1995), rather than seeking to supplant local cultural capital and alienating powerful traditional opinion leaders in the process.</p>
               <p>The field of consumption is so classified that there exist different lifestyles organized by class position into what Bourdieu described as “habitus.” We found mixed support for Bourdieu’s notion of “habitus” that leaves members little opportunity to break free from social prescriptions. On one hand, we found evidence of the effectiveness with which the social script on ancestral relationships, for example, creates the necessary pressure on the bereaved in Asante to produce elaborate death rituals beyond their financial means. While bereaved consumer tastes determined the exact nature of each ritual, consumers across social class adhered to this requirement within the confines of their habitus, even if it required nonconsumption toward this end. Thus, the impact of habitus operates here through stipulating the range of acceptable social and cultural capital is present in death‐ritual consumption. On the other hand, our analysis suggests a spilling over as the limited availability of death‐ritual products in poorer societies like Asante encourage a democratization of desire and even consumption. Consumers with similar tastes and in similar social classes consumed products that extended beyond their defined class, as with Nana and Akyia who sought differentiation by breaking away from the norms suggested by their respective habitus. This suggests that habitus may not be as clearly defined in terms of tastes, as Bourdieu’s treatise would indicate.</p>
               <p>In sum, our analysis presents evidence to challenge the established theoretical notion that a person’s identity reconstruction project ceases upon death. We conclude from our evidence that death initiates (rather than ends) a positive transition in a deceased consumer’s identity in some societies like the one studied. The specific dynamics of this process in Asante leads us to agree with those who view death as a primary means of regenerating life. We also note that there can be clashes when foreign cultural capital is introduced into a new culture for use in social symbolic conflicts. In these instances, local cultural capital wins over global cultural capital, suggesting the need for subtle hybridization. Our analysis and challenge to the previously mentioned theoretical positions, lead us to a call for more studies to facilitate the incorporation of unique cross‐cultural perspectives into consumption research.</p>

            <title>Areas for Future Research</title>
            <p>The dearth of consumption research on death‐related phenomena suggests that our study be viewed as a stimulus for more research in the topic area. From a methodological perspective, other approaches may be applied to examine tenets of death‐ritual consumption. In the course of our study, we observed that Asantes take pictures of their death rituals that may be used as data sources in death‐ritual consumption studies. Although visual analysis in consumer research is often restricted to supporting roles (e.g., Rook 1985), the technique may be used to scrutinize cultural occurrences and consumption representations. Such is the case, for instance, in the video analysis by Zhao and Belk (2002) of the role of burning paper money and paper consumer goods in Chinese funerals. Lutz and Collins (1993) and Schroeder (2002) develop a critical sense of photography as artifacts that may be analyzed with reference to their context, unconscious motives, and the viewers’ construction of meaning. Following in this tradition, future studies may examine the consumption motives of those who symbolically consume their dead through preservation on film.</p>
            <p>A further avenue for future death consumption research lies in the examination of the process by which death rituals and related consumption move from being occasion based and restricted to a particular social group into becoming mass consumed. In Western cultures, such movement has been largely explained by the emulative consumption framework established in the literature (Campbell 1987; Veblen 1899), where the poor are all too willing to adopt the consumption patterns of their wealthier counterparts for purposes of identity enhancements. Arnould (1989) observed that the aggressive nature by which such emulation occurs in the West is not readily apparent in certain African societies. Our findings support this assertion and draws attention to the view that the ability of poorer consumers to apply local capital effectively against the global in social negotiations makes emulation of the high‐status consumers less appealing to them. A careful assessment of death‐ritual dynamics should help researchers paint a clearer picture of these consumer cultural development processes in non‐Western societies.</p>
            <p>In this study, we assumed that all manners of death are accorded similar postmortem ritual consumption dynamics. Studies in anthropology and other areas suggest that there can be differences in rituals related to death resulting from suicides, accidents, natural disasters, and so on (Metcalf and Huntington 1991). Future studies may examine the specific ritual structures for specific manners of death and their implications for consumption. In a similar vein, this study has sought to situate death‐ritual consumption experiences in the common system of Asante culture, history, and conceptions of death‐ritual consumption. As Rosenblatt, Walsh, and Jackson (1976) argue, grief is not a universal concept, and thus the dynamics of death and the behavior it engenders are different across cultures. Our focus on Asante, therefore, restricts our ability to make universal claims. Future research may extend into other cultures in efforts to develop a comparative focus on death‐ritual consumption and a more comprehensive outline of consumer action under each unique cultural circumstance.</p>
