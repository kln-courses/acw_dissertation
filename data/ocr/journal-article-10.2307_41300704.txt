<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD HORNBY The Ueber-Marionette Puppets are for children. Like children, they are small, cute, and boisterous. They express strong, primal emotions with little attempt at repression. They are crude, they are vulgar, they are noisy, and they are a little embarrassing. No American adult would go to a puppet show unless accompanied by a child. This has not always been the case. Other cultures, especially in Asia, have traditional puppet shows that are very much for adults. Three hundred years ago, for example, the great Japanese playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon wrote sensitive, poetic tragedies for the bunraku puppet theatre that are still performed today. Serious puppetry can also still be seen in Indonesia, India, and China. Even in the West, our puppet performances were at one time more grown-up than they have become. I once received a phone call from a reporter doing a story on an authentic Punch and Judy show presented at a local school; the violent, earthy material had horrified parents attending with their children. I explained that traditional English Punch and Judy shows, which have their roots in the Italian Renaissance commedia dell'arte, could be outrageously vulgar, and that even as recently as Victorian times could involve horrific violence (a baby ground up in a sausage machine, for example) and every bodily function. For all their straight-laced reputa- tion, the Victorians were less squeamish than we are; it never occurred to them to develop a rating system for performances. Had they done so, however, they would have had to give their Punch and Judy shows an X. Gordon Craig, the great influential stage designer who was part of the Symbolist movement in theatre over a century ago, wrote of puppets: "they are the descendants of a great and noble family of Images, Images which were made in the likeness of God." Larger than life, they once moved fluidly and rhythmically rather than jerkily, had no need for wires to support them, and spoke in beautiful incantation rather than in nasal squeaks. Craig actually wanted the modern actor to model performances on puppetry, to become an iconic "Ueber- Marionette" rather than just a neutral replication of everyday behavior. At a time when insipid realism dominates so much of our stage - and film and television - it is worth remembering that wherever drama first occurred, it was always associated with religion and was always intended to connect its audiences with deep, universal forces. In 2007, the Royal National Theatre presented a show entitled War</page><page sequence="2">RICHARD HORNBY 491 Horse , adapted by Nick Stafford from a children's novel of the same title by Michael Morpurgo. The author felt that "they must be mad" to try to make a play from his book; animals onstage are nothing but trouble, and the story is actually told by a horse! This view underestimated the resourcefulness of Stafford and the RNT. The first-person (first-horse?) device was scrapped, with the story, set in World War I, presented straightforwardly but using puppets along with live actors. The play was a huge success, transferring to the West End in 2009, where even the Queen and Prince Philip went to see it. I didn't. It was on my list, but not high enough; a puppet show about a boy and his horse sounded about right for the royal couple, but not for a sophisticate like me. My attitude was of course just the same old prejudice against puppet- ry that now pervades our culture. What I discovered about War Horse when I finally caught up with it at Lincoln Center in New York, where it transferred in April 2011, is that it is a superbly crafted, powerful repre- sentation of the First World War, a children's play only in the sense that the great debacle slaughtered soldier boys in their teens by the thousands. The action begins at a horse auction in rural Devon in 1912, where a farmer buys a colt for thirty-nine guineas - more than the animal is worth - because the rival bidder is his estranged brother. This meaning- less, costly rivalry sets the stage thematically for the horrific one to come, the Great War between rival-brother nations. The farmer's son Albert takes a liking to the colt, which he names "Joey"; as the animal matures, Joey becomes Albert's personal mount. Albert's father, how- ever, still feuding with his brother, makes a bet that he can turn Joey, although half hunter and half thoroughbred and thus suitable for riding, into a plow horse, thus justifying his high price. Reluctantly, young Albert teaches the horse to pull. When World War I breaks out, however, Joey is immediately bought up by the cavalry and shipped off to France. With shelling, machine gun fire, poison gas, and barbed wire, horses suffer even more than the men. Joey ends up serving in both the British and German armies, enduring hunger, disease, injury, and near death. At one point, only his training in hauling saves him from being slaughtered for food; at another, he is trapped in barbed wire in no man's land, but soldiers from both sides leave their trenches to come out to free him. Meanwhile Albert, who had been too young to enlist when war broke out, finds his way to France to recover Joey and bring him home. War Horse swept the Tony Awards in June, winning for Best Play and most other categories except those in acting. It is not really an actors' play. The large cast of mostly one-dimensional characters serves to focus on Joey and the other horses; only the sibling rivalry in the opening scene promises much in human terms, but it is not developed. The real stars of the show were the puppets, designed, built, and manipulated in performance by the glorious Handspring Puppet Company, founded in South Africa in 1981 and performing since then all over the world.</page><page sequence="3">492 THE HUDSON REVIEW Since there is no Tony Award for Best Puppetry, the Awards Committee wisely presented the troupe with a Special Tony, in view of the fact that leaving it without any recognition would have been the worst blunder in New York theatre history. The horse puppets were big life-size skeletal horses with articulated legs, tails, necks, and heads. Two puppeteers stood inside each puppet, one operating the forelegs and the other the hind. They were fully visible to the audience, so that, oddly, we could see a total of eight legs for each horse, but it did not matter. When puppetry is this skillful, so that the slightest movement is in character (so to speak), the visible handlers not only do not distract, they add a strange magical dimension to the puppets, as if the puppets were alive and the human operators merely following along. This effect was even more apparent with a third puppeteer, who stood beside as if guiding the horse, holding the head. Unlike his counterpart in the Morpurgo novel, Joey did not speak, or in any other way mimic human behavior. Animal puppets usually denote small people; Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog, Oliver J. Dragon, etc., were supposed to be animals but were actually delightful little humans whose animal-like features gave them strong, adorable personalities. In War Horse , however, the horses were horses. One of the most poignant moments in the play occurred when Joey, about to be slaughtered by the Germans for food, caught sight of a horse collar, then bowed his head to take it around his neck, as Albert had trained him to do. It was simply a conditioned reflex; Joey had no idea his life was in danger unless he could be used as a cart horse. The audience of course was aware of the full context of the event, which became heartbreakingly theatrical. In a deeper sense, however, these horses were suggestive of human soldiers. They were involved in battles where they were usually helpless. They were ordered about like soldiers and suffered like them. Some of the horses we saw were young (like Joey as a colt), some were mature; some were healthy, some were sick or starving; some were dead. One thing that the horses were not, however, was British or German, regardless of which army happened to be using them. They were just poor dumb brutes being ground up in a machine, like the soldiers themselves. If the horses were incapable of comprehending the purpose of all the suffering, the soldiers could only comprehend that there was no purpose. Today, nearly a century later, there still seems none. It is hard to believe that armies still had cavalries in the First World War, but they still had their strong devotees, even as horses and men were being pulverized by the new technology. An important moment that summed up the whole war was a confrontation between Joey and a tank. For this the Handspring Company designed a large tank-puppet, skeletal like the horses, and like them having men inside, ostensibly as soldiers but also as puppeteers making the contraption move about. Joey, mute as always and lacking in anthropomorphic features, nonethe- less seemed to recognize the tank as more than just another obstacle</page><page sequence="4">RICHARD HORNBY 493 like the barbed wire, but also as an attack on a whole way of life, the end of the horse-drawn era. This then is the grandeur of puppets, their ability to stand for so much more than themselves. The power of Craig's Ueber-Marionette is not in realism, and certainly not in psychology; the psychological conflict between the farmer and his brother in War Horse could only be represented by realistic human actors, who quickly became insignifi- cant. The big iconic puppets, however, could embody momentous, historic conflicts. This is the reason that Antonin Artaud, the French theatrical visionary (and, like Craig, a Symbolist) called for a theatre that would not be small and psychological, but huge, physical, and mysterious: "Every show will contain physical, objective elements perceptible to all . . . [with] the tangible appearance of new, surprising objects, masks, puppets many feet high, abrupt lighting changes, the physical action of lighting simulating heat and cold, and so on."1 A realistic theatrical treatment of Morpurgo's novel would have come down to boy meets horse, boy loses horse, boy reunited with horse, which is what I originally expected. An Artaudian treatment did not preclude that modest story, but it also set the story within the larger one of the First World War, and beyond that within the greatest story of all, of the human race and the mad way we rush to exterminate one another. Jez Butterworth's Jerusalem takes its name from William Blake's hymn, sung at the beginning of the play, which contrasts England's "dark satanic mills" of the early nineteenth century with its traditional "green and pleasant land." The comedy is set in England today in a village in Wiltshire, but the mills are gone and the greenness has dwindled to scruffy woodland at the edge of town where a local eccentric named Johnny "Rooster" Byron lives in a rusting mobile home surrounded by his long-accumulated rubbish. It is the morning of the local county fair on St. George's Day, which Johnny and his pals are celebrating with noisy abandon. All the riffraff of the village hang out with Johnny - school dropouts, unemployed laborers, local thugs, a dotty old professor, assorted chil- dren - playing loud music, telling tall tales, and consuming alarming amounts of alcohol and other drugs. Johnny himself gargles with vodka, swears like a sailor, and struts and yells like a real rooster, but he is actually a harmless, goodhearted creature constantly at odds with local officials, who are threatening to raze his campground and arrest him for dealing drugs. At the other end of the social spectrum, local ruffians have it in for Johnny too, so that near the end of the play, while dozens of police are advancing on his squalid home, the louts are beating him up and branding him on the face. Johnny shrugs it all off. He has been here forever, has seen everything, knows everything, and will outlast 1 The Theatre and Its Double, trans, by Victor Corti (London, 1970), p. 72.</page><page sequence="5">494 THE HUDSON REVIEW them all. As the play comes to a close, he is beating on his drum, cursing the county council while calling up his ancestors, all the woodland spirits "who walk these green plains still." It is no accident that Johnny's family name is the same as that of a notorious bad-boy English poet, or that the play itself takes its name from a hymn of another well-known English literary maverick. The play manages to combine "in-yer-face" naturalism with remarkable literary sophistication, longing not so much for a lost rural land as for a lost common culture. St. George is the long-established patron saint of England, with a feast day on April 23, which is also the date of both Shakespeare's birth and of his death. There are references in the play to legendary English figures like King Arthur, and when someone bursts into song it is likely to be English folk music rather than modern rock or pop. Traditional St. George's Day festivities are going on all through the play not far from Johnny's encampment, so that when the professor wanders in he is garlanded with flowers, like King Lear when he is mad. One fellow has been Morris Dancing all day, and a teenaged girl with the unlikely name of "Phaedra" is dressed up as a fairy. (She is the one who sings "Jerusalem.") Johnny himself is an example of the "Wild Man," an important figure in English folklore who is customarily wild and hairy, often poetic or prophetic, and also often a seducer of civilized woman. (Johnny has a six-year-old son, illegitimate of course, whose conventional mother disapproves of Johnny's lifestyle.) He does not live outside the reach of civilization but on the edge of it, along with other marginal figures like hunters, herdsmen, religious hermits, and criminals.2 The Wild Man, in other words, is a link between civilization and barbarism, or between Christianity and paganism. The Wild Man is found in medieval English literature and folk drama but exists in the literature of many other cultures and other times. There are also female variants, "Wild Women" like the witches in Macbeth , who live in a forest, speak a jingling poetry, and prophesy. Banquo specifically describes the witches as "wild" and even as having beards when he and Macbeth first encounter them (I.iii.39-47). The witches are of course negative figures, but Johnny, despite his many enemies (and partly because of them) , is exuberantly positive, the personification of the boisterous, messy side of life that is always giving the feral finger to the bureaucrats who try to keep us under control. The main reason for the success of the play in both London and New York is political. Johnny refers to the naysayers from the town council as "puritans," figures of importance in both English and American history who lately have returned in the United States as "Tea Party" Republicans. These joyless individuals dominate our politics today, doing their best to stamp out everything that is artistic, sensual, or otherwise unconventional, but we still have the ancient and venerable Johnny the Wild Man on our side, beating his drum. 2 Dorothy Yamamato, The Boundaries of the Human in Medieval English Literature (Oxford, 2000), pp. 150-51.</page><page sequence="6">RICHARD HORNBY 495 Mark Rylance played Johnny, winning both the Olivier Award (his third) in London and the Tony Award (his second) on Broadway. Rylance is best known to Americans for heading the restored Shake- speare's Globe in London in its first decade (1995-2005). Born in England to English parents, he was raised in the United States, eventually studying acting both in the U.S. and at RADA in London. I found his productions at the restored Globe to be overdone, but his own acting was always gutsy and flawless, and his casting of actors from many countries (including America) was admirable. As Johnny, Rylance was in the role of a lifetime, combining raw American energy with an English sense of elegance and sophistication, a truly international performance both in execution and significance. Stephen Adly Guirgis, a brilliant playwright who has become the American theatre's best-kept secret, finally arrived on Broadway last spring, with his seventh play, The Motherfucker with the Hat. (Even though the first noun is used a billion times a day in the United States, and is spoken frequently and unselfconsciously in the play itself, in the program and publicity the producers squeamishly replaced two letters of it with asterisks.) Its characters are Guirgis' usual low-life New Yorkers who, although barely literate, are nonetheless sensitive, interesting, and morally ambiguous. Take away Hamlet's aristocratic birth and fancy education but keep the intelligence and the angst, then put him on the streets of twenty-first-century Manhattan, and you will have a Guirgis character. Motherf**ker concerns a young parolee named Jackie who stays free of drugs and alcohol under the guidance of his sponsor Ralph, a self-help guru and health food faddist. Jackie has just got a job and is living again with his beloved girlfriend Veronica. All is not what it seems, however. Despite his smarmy style and his promotion of complex fruit beverages, Ralph is secretly a womanizer and a drug dealer, while Veronica is actually a sexually promiscuous cocaine user. Just as Jackie is about to make love to Veronica in the opening scene, he spots a suspicious hat on the table that turns out to belong to none other than Ralph. Jackie runs off to get revenge but ends up shooting only the hat, not Ralph himself; finally the two men are wrestling on the floor with equally futile results. It is all in the typical Guirgis style, indefinite and unresolved yet energetic and darkly funny. What is lacking is the religious dimension that informs Guirgis' best plays, like Jesus Hopped the A Train or Our Lady of 121st Street. Ralph is an entirely secular figure, and the Catholic religion, which usually haunts Guirgis as it did Eugene O'Neill, never intrudes. Nevertheless, the play remains an entertaining, mordant comment on the hypocrisies of our time. Anna D. Shapiro directed Motherf^^ker with skill and grace, proving as she did with Tracy Letts 's August: Osage County that she can lift up lackluster naturalism to a poetic level. Todd Rosenthal's artful settings physicalized the same contrast, with realistic New York apartments</page><page sequence="7">496 THE HUDSON REVIEW topped by fire escapes that seemed to extend infinitely upwards, as in a painting by M. C. Escher. Most of the actors gave strong performances, especially Bobby Cannavale as the desperate Jackie and Annabella Sciorra as Ralph's long-suffering wife Victoria. Chris Rock was a tepid Ralph, however; perhaps too many years of doing stand-up comedy made him forget about such important dramatic qualities as character and situation. He meandered aimlessly through the play, quiet and detached, as if afraid of embarrassing himself - with the result that he did just that. Instead of being a blowhard like Dr. Phil or Judge Judy, he seemed like a participant in reality TV who had wandered onto the wrong set. The cast and production team of Motherflt*ker listed their bios in the program, as is customary in the theatre. It was amusing and telling that Guirgis listed premieres of his earlier plays at the Donmar Warehouse, the Almeida, the Arts, the Hampstead, and the Edinburgh Festival, all major venues in the U.K., where he has also won a number of major playwriting awards. Like Mark Rylance, Guirgis is an American by upbringing who found himself artistically in Great Britain. It was good to see him finally getting his due in the theatre of his native country.</page></plain_text>
