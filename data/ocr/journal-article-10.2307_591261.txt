It focuses on relations between different intellectual, and other, communities, the problematization of 'traditional' disciplinary bound- aries and divisions and, in particular, the significance of such issues for sociology. Drawing on an ethnographic study of the work of computer scientists, it looks both at their communications with increasingly heterogeneous audiences, and at ethnographic relations between researcher and researched. It is argued that pro- cesses of 'simulation' can be discerned: firstly, the simulation of certain forms of order in computer scientists' representations of their own work in communi- cations across boundaries; secondly, the simulation of a separate ethnographic object of study by the social scientist. It is suggested that since certain well estab- lished conceptions of social science inquiry rely implicitly on just such senses of order and separation, their problematization raises questions about the con- ceptualization, status and practice of sociological inquiry in the light of apparent transformations to relations of int:ellectual production and exchange. KEYWORDS: Disciplines; ethnography; intellectual production; representation; . . slmu atlon INTRODUCTION The changing state of knowledge production in contemporary western societies - whether theorized in terms of postmodernity (Lyotard 1984), postmodernization (Crook et al. 1992) or as a transformation from 'mode 1' to 'mode 2' (Gibbons et al. 1994) - is an increasingly recurrent theme in a number of quite diverse literatures. A key component of these claims is the assertion of changing relations between different intellectual and other communities, and the problematization of 'traditional' disciplinary bound- aries and divisions. These apparent processes of transformation form the context for this paper, which attempts to contribute to the understanding of the contemporary relations of knowledge production by drawing and Brit.

It focuses both on the computer scientists' work of communicating with increasingly heterogeneous audiences, and on the relations between ethno- grapher and studied scientists. In so doing it considers the challenges that are posed for empirical social science by developments, substantive and theoretical, within the world that both provides its objects of study and frames its research practice. It is suggested that the separation of ethnographic subject and object is a highly contingent achievement, and one particularly visible in this kind of domain; further, that standard conceptions of social science inquiry, that is conceptions which rely implicitly on notions of disciplinary expertise as a separate, delimitable and essentially meta-level form of discourse, may need to be rethought in the light of transformations to relations of intel- lectual production and exchange. In other words, it considers the possibility that the new organizational and intellectual context of research may not only be a worthwhile topic for sociological study, but may also have far reaching consequences for how we conceptualize, and go about doing, sociological work. The paper is organized as follows. First a very brief review of some influ- ential accounts of changes to the research system and intellectual produc- tion is given, noting some common themes. Then material from an ethnographic study of the impact of organizational change on the work of computer scientists is discussed: I focus initially on ways in which new forms of association and practice have impacted upon their work and their disci- plinary identity, then on the trans-disciplinary relations between ethnogra- pher and researched. I then consider the implications of this discussion, for ethnographic method and, more generally, for sociology and social science.2 THE CHANGING STATE OF KNOWLEDGE Lyotard's (1984) influential treatise maps a transition from the modern to the postmodern in terms of the condition of science and knowledge pro- duction. He suggests that the validation and legitimation of knowledge is increasingly achieved by, or with reference to, quite new kinds of criteria: notably, 'performative', or essentially pragmatic criteria have come to replace the traditional criterion of truth. The postmodern is famously defined as an 'incredulity towards metanarratives', of which 'truth' is a/the prominent example. Lyotard goes on to suggest in his 'report' that the crisis of such metanarratives implies a destabilization and transformation of the traditional forms and institutions of knowledge, such as the discipline and the university. Thus research has become accountable in quite different terms, and organized in quite different ways, for example in multi-disci- plinary teams oriented to particular substantive problems. Crook et al. (1992) attempt to place these kinds of developments within a broader socio-economic context. If Lyotard is arguing that knowledge can</page><page sequence="3"> Geoff Cooper no longer be legitimated in terms of truth, or of its own inherent value, Crook et al. suggest that this is part of a broader process of 'postmodern- ization' in which hitherto separate discourses become inserted and incor- porated within more pervasive economies and discourses (ibid.: 217). What is eroded is the autonomy and the distinctiveness of 'science' and its disci- plinary boundaries; and they note, somewhat allusively, that this develop- ment also implies an erosion of the boundary between the social and the technical.3 Gibbons et al. (1994) formulate a process of transition between 'mode 1' and 'mode 2' knowledge which they see as relevant to science, social science and the humanities. 'Mode 1' research is academic, disciplinary, hom- ogeneous. By contrast, 'mode 2' research is carried out in the context of application, transdisciplinary and heterogeneous; furthermore, it is more socially accountable. These characterizations are intended neither as chronologically discrete nor incompatible categories; rather 'mode 2' is a description of emergent tendencies within the research system. There are difficult questions to be asked here: in particular, about the validity of seeing change in terms of a single radical division between 'tra- ditional' and 'new' forms of research activity and knowledge production, and about the possible tendency to construct idealized representations of the former in support of such claims. I do not attempt to address these ques- tions; my justification for seeing value in these accounts is simply that they appear to connect with the strong sense that prevails, within both computer science and social science, that some form of transition or transformation is taking place.4 They highlight some of the key points of interest for this paper: changing disciplinary identities; the increasing expectation, some- times requirement, that academics should collaborate and communicate across traditional boundaries, with other academics and with non- academics; new forms of accountability, representation and visibility; and the ways that some of these changes impact upon research and constitute fundamental challenges to disciplinary concepts and practices. I will approach these issues via a consideration of some ethnographic materials which are intended to point to some of the changing associations and net- works within which researchers (computer scientists and social scientists) work. CROSS-BOUNDARY RELATIONS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE The ethnographic study reported here focused upon the impact of changes in the funding and organization of research upon the practice and culture of research in a prominent computer science department. For two periods of six months I was given office space in the department and was attached to one research group in particular. Computer science is a highly differen- tiated discipline, not least in relation to some of the concerns about accountability, purity and application which concern us here: in Gibbons</page><page sequence="4">Simulating difference 3 et al.'s terms, the department in question might be described as more characteristic of mode 1 than many, but, as we shall see, feeling the impacts of transition to mode 2. My own research was conceived as operating within a relatively traditional disciplinary framework, that is, as a sociological study of computer scientists. Findings would primarily be of interest to social scientists and policy makers: this can be contrasted with much current work at the intersection of the social and computer sciences, which tends to be of a more collaborative and interdisciplinary nature. Again the mode 1/2 division is too simple, but we can say that with respect to some essentials, the study was mode 1 in character.5 In a sense, the fact that the ethnography took place in this department was testimony to the transitional strains that it was undergoing, since the head of department's willingness to let it be investigated stemmed from his concern about what he saw as the unreasonable demands being placed upon it. He felt that academics were increasingly being expected to behave and work 'like businessmen'. Whilst the department remained highly com- petitive - it was, for example, particularly effective at securing research funding from diverse sources - there was an ambivalence about the new organizational context in which researchers increasingly found themselves operating. For example, some researchers were critical of the composition of SERC (subsequently named the EPSRC) committees and the pro- portional rise in non-academic representation. Another widely, though not unanimously held view was that the move towards large scale projects involv- ing collaboration with academic and industrial partners involved a dispro- portionate amount of administrative effort. To see these changes as simply the context for research would be to miss the significance of organizational change for the very character of the disci- pline. My naive assumption at the outset of the study was that since com- puter science was, in comparison with social science for example, a relatively 'applied' discipline, the impact of organizational changes would be less marked in this domain. For some, this view mistook computer science for IT: the former being concerned with the development of logic, representation and their understanding, and as such a pure form of science. New demands to collaborate with industry could be seen as com- pounding and instantiating this misunderstanding: resistance to change was about, in part, the (re)affirmation of the character of the discipline, or one view of it. For others by contrast, probably a minority, emergent forms of association posed fundamental challenges to computer science to which the discipline should respond in a more radical manner: for example, by reconfiguring itself across a number of domains, academic and industrial, thereby becoming a distributed source of practical computational expertise rather than a traditional unitary discipline. New forms of association, then, may be seen as having implications which go to the heart of disciplinary identity. They also produced tensions, ambivalences and paradoxes within research practice. Of particular inter- est were some phenomena that might be seen as derived from or related to</page><page sequence="5">4 Geoft Cooper a generalized increase in visibility. This heightened visibility could be seen on the one hand, in the way that research was accountable to funders on a more regular and formalized basis, and on the other, in the need for researchers to present their work to new constituencies, including collabo- rators and possible users. It was possible to read a tendency towards 'simu- lation' in some of their work in these areas. Let me briefly explain what I mean by this before giving some concrete examples. I use the term simulation to denote a process in which a kind of visible representation or model of self - where self might be, for example, a par- ticular research group or community- is assembled and used for practical communicative purposes. My suggestion is that simulation is designed to deal with the functional requirements of communicating across bound- aries, or across distance in social space. The term, as it used here, is loosely derived from its use in computer science; in its everyday use, however, it has further connotations, some of which are potentially misleading. I do not, for instance, intend the term to convey, in any simple sense, feigning or faking, and in particular am keen to avoid imputing strategies of conscious deception to participants; nor do I see simulation as a secondary phenom- enon in relation to some prior, more authentic area of practice.6 On the other hand, I do suggest that the relation between constructed represen- tation and other areas of (research) practice may sometimes appear con- tradictory or paradoxical. For example, international collaboration involved, crucially, the achieve- ment of visible collaboration. Discussing the work of co-ordinating research with the project director of a major European project, I was told that the secret of successful collaborative projects was to organize them in such a (modular) form that collaborative work was kept to a minimum. 'Genuine' collaboration was more likely to lead to disagreement and thereby to one's being seen, in the eyes of one's paymasters, as a bad collaborator with all the risks that this entails for future funding: 'simulated' collaboration was therefore viewed as a more promising strategy. This strategy must be seen against the background of a wish to preserve a local research community within wider collaborative networks. Thus, separate email lists were set up for the project as a whole and for the local research group, the latter being a communicative space where critical comment on other collaborators was possible. Collaboration was sometimes described as primarily a process of convincing collaborators of the value of the local group's approach to soft- . . ware englneerlng. The presentation of some of the results of the research at the annual European conference held by the body funding this project, ESPRIT, pro- vides a further instance of this kind of phenomenon. Some instructions to presenters for one session stress the need to make professional presen- tations which are intelligible to non-specialists in one's area, for ESPRIT is very much aimed beyond the traditional academic community. To that end, in addition to providing 'hints' about such matters as the preferred com- position of overhead slides, the instructions suggest that</page><page sequence="6">Simulating difference 5 consideration may be given in advance to typical questions which would help to highlight some key points of the presentation; arrangements could be made to ensure that such questions are raised from the audi- ence in the absence of other questions. Again, this occurs as part of the work of talking across boundaries to more differentiated communities than are characteristic of mode 1 research. Here the simulation of dialogue itself forms part of such exchanges; the presenter is seen to be answering questions from supposed interested parties in order to be intelligible to others (see Cooper and Woolgar 1996). A further example arose in the work of a consortium which was formed for the purpose of securing a research contract from the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) . The consortium was made up of industrialists and an academic representative from the department that I was studying. In the course of drafting a proposal, it was suggested that the consortium should promise a number of internal workshops for the purposes of estab- lishing lines of communication between contributing collaborators and facilitating the development of ideas. This proposed strategy was criti- cized, and subsequently abandoned, on the grounds that they would appear not to be a real, or least coherent consortium if such meetings were necessary. The minimizing of contact (of a certain form) was important for the visible coherence and integration of the consortium's constituent parts. It is of course arguable how far these kinds of practices may be plausibly attributed to the emergence of a distinctively new 'mode' of research organization. Research has perhaps always involved the construction of certain idealized representations of one's work, not least in the drafting of grant proposals (see for example Myers 1990); but the consortium had to operate within parameters which were new to the academic in question in so far as he was unclear what the DTI were expecting. Moreover, the process bore more resemblance to bidding for a consultancy contract than writing an academic proposal, and those more well versed in this area had a clear sense of familiar dilemmas that needed to be avoided: for example, making the proposal/bid convincing without actually doing the work in advance of securing the contract. The central point however is not to assert an unproblematic division between old and new styles of research practice, but to point to a more fundamental issue. Representations of different kinds are assembled within, and related to, sets of social relations: disciplinary, institutional, organis- ational. The emergence of particular styles, modes, and genres of orep- resentation, sometimes quite paradoxical in form, can be understood as responses to, and as part of the emergence of new forms of association, div- ision and accountability. But as has already been noted, the ethnographer also moves within these transformed social relations: what are the impli- cations of this for our understanding of contemporary ethnographic work in these and other domains?</page><page sequence="7">GeoMf Cooper 26 ETHNOGRAPHIC RELATIONS Much recent anthropological work has focused on the ways in which ethnographic texts represent their object, where representation is under- stood in terms of genres and process of construction rather than as some kind of literal depiction (see for example, Clifford and Marcus 1986; Clough 1992; and Fabian 1983). Whilst sharing this general approach, I want to suggest that the problematic of ethnographic representation within this domain can be profitably analysed in relation to the specifici- ties of changing intellectual and social relations. The relation of ethno- graphic subject and object in texts can seen as being organized in the interests of methodological tidiness and purity: but I want to suggest that this work of ordering and purification becomes even more problematic in a context in which disciplinary boundaries and identities are, though not dissolved, increasingly complex. Even though the motivation for my study was in some sense quite tra- ditional - a sociologist studying the work of scientists - reflection upon some aspects of social relations in the field is suggestive of the work that is required to accomplish and maintain this disciplinary coherence and dis- cretion. The interaction between ethnographic subject and those being studied is complex, and thus analytic distance must be contrived for a number of reasons:7 those studied engaged in (their own form of) sociology in their work; they read, discussed and contributed to the ethnographer's interpretations of their work; and they displayed reflexive awareness of many of ethnographer's ascriptions, and of aspects of the ethnographic research process itself. Sociological matters are both explicit concerns within, and an implicit frame for much of this group's work on distributed, and communicating, software systems. To get the flavour of this, consider one discussion of the relevance of their research for Computer Supported Co-operative Work which touched on: the invocation of the need to understand more about the social process of negotiation in order to model and build better negotiation into systems; a counter-charge that this assumed an unwar- ranted anthropomorphic view of computer systems; and the subsequent, well received suggestion that the negotiation process was, rather, being simulated. If the relevance of social process for system design is here top- icalized, elsewhere it is a given feature of their technical work. Not only do they use models of communication within the systems themselves, but they must construe the settings and organizations in which such systems will be deployed. Indeed, it is often very difficult to separate these internal and external dimensions. The disciplinary boundary between researcher and researched in this domain is therefore neither given nor imperme- able.8 This overlap of topical concern meant that the subject-object relation was continually being complicated. I was on some occasions used as a resource for their work, and questioned on such matters as 'what do you</page><page sequence="8">Simulating difference 27 understand by "culture"?' for the purposes of a paper on software development environments. Or again, I found that my essentially con- structionist account of how the problem of defining 'software quality' might be approached resonated with the ideas held by one of the people I was studying.9 And on occasion, due to my former research interest in human-computer interaction, I found myself giving papers at the same events as some of the people I was researching, and communicating and working with researchers who had links with individuals in the depart- ment. It was also the case that the performative aspects of my texts were sig- nificant. The formulation of 'simulation' in parts of this paper derives from discussions with my principal informant about the content of an earlier piece that I had written about the drafting of a proposal, in which I had argued that the presumed linear sequence of research could be seen as an artefact of the work of drafting, which required some attention to the narra- tive requirements and dilemmas involved. My informant saw continuities between this and other themes addressed in the software engineering litera- ture, and suggested that I was, in fact, describing a process of simulation.l° My texts also impacted upon what I was able to observe: on the basis of having read some of my work, my principal informant formed judgments about the kind of things I might be interested in. The model of observation of object by subject is thus given another twist. Furthermore, the subject/object relation can itself becomes a topic for those being studied. My principal informant continually ironicized the anthropological roots of ethnography with remarks such 'don't worry, we're not going to force you to drink millet beer'. On another occasion one of his colleagues inferred that my use of ethnography was premised on 'the tribe' as an appropriate social model for the department, and jokingly sug- gested - with particular reference to the role of research students and con- tract researchers - that it might be better described as feudal. He then said, displaying a highly tuned sensitivity to some of the potential absurdities of ethnography as a method: 'I suppose you're now going to write down that your subjects see the world as feudal!' The reflexive awareness of the ethnographic subject/object relation is perhaps best illustrated by one final incident. On being thanked for intro- ducing me to someone with whom I wished to set up an interview, my infor- mant replied 'that is what an informant's supposed to do isn't it?'. Here, perhaps, ethnographic method can be seen as a co-production: the 'object' of study displays a methodological concern with how to be a studied scien- tist. To summarize, the relationship between ethnographic subject and object is complicated by a number of related phenomena: the problematization of disciplinary boundaries, the emergence of new forms of intellectual association, the diffusion of social scientific concerns and approaches into ostensibly 'technical' domains, and the increasing methodological sophisti- cation of some of those studied with respect to social scientific work.</page><page sequence="9">28 Geoff Cooper TEXTUAL RELATIONS Have you noticed the popularity among scientists of the word 'interface' - which supposes that the junction between two sciences or two concepts is perfectly under control, or seamless, and poses no problems? On the contrary, I believe that these spaces between are more complicated than one thinks [. . .] Between the hard sciences and the so-called human sci- ences the passage resembles a jagged shore, sprinkled with ice, and vari- able. (Serres with Latour 1995: 70) It would be easy, not to say facile, to present one textual representation (a version of what happened in the field) and contrast it with another (the completed ethnographic text) in order to question the adequacy of latter. This is not the intention here, not least because of the theoretically suspect nature of such a procedure.ll It is not being argued that some form of primary empirical 'experience' belies its representation. Rather, the above brief reflections on certain aspects of fieldwork in this domain point towards, or are intended to be suggestive of, changing disciplinary for- mations and relations: and it is suggested that these changing relations have significant implications for social scientific research practice, not least for the writing of ethnographic texts.l2 Further, these changes may pose con- ceptual challenges to certain formulations of ethnography, and more generally social science, since the latter may be premised on increasingly problematic traditional disciplinary structures. Analytic order may always have been a form of accomplishment which is achieved in texts, but I am concerned with some specific problems in fields where conceptual separ- ation between researcher and researched may be in some respects unten- able. Let us consider one methodological recommendation by way of example.l3 Following Garfinkel's (1967) conceptualization of ethno- methodology, Zimmerman and Pollner (]973) suggest that much sociology uses participants' accounts, understandings and practices as unexplicated resources in sociological work; they suggest that, in the service of analytic clarity, such accounts and understandings should rather be made into topics of sociological inquiry. The underlying concern is that social science should make explicit and clarify its relation to everyday knowledge, instead of simply being unwittingly parasitic upon it. For Zimmerman and Pollner, the credibility of a social science depends, in part, on its ability to distin- guish itself from everyday knowledge. This distinction between members and analyst has continued to be both central to ethnomethodology, and the object of some debate.l4 However, its commitment to analytic separation and distance seems particularly problematic in this domain, since the very possibility of specifying and demarcating member and analyst appears to rely upon a quite different and unitary disciplinary formation to the more complex configuration that has been alluded to here. In addition to the general problems that may be raised about the undifferentiated category</page><page sequence="10">Simulating difference 29 of 'member' (Watson 1994), there are specific issues about applying this to work which has topical overlaps with sociology.l5 Moreover, the notion of 'analyst' becomes more complex given the diffusion and fragmentation of knowledge, not least sociological knowledge, across traditional disciplinary boundaries. The need for a certain kind of analytic order, and a particular set of strat- egies for achieving it, thus stand at variance with emergent intellectual relations. In part this is a question of the stance we take towards those that we study. The formulation of topic and resource is but one strategy whereby the object of study, whether ironicized or not, remains deliberately and emphatically separate from the work of its analysis. The deployment of 'the stranger' perspective in which the researcher seeks to avoid uncritically adopting a participant perspective is, for all its many differences, commit- ted to a similar analytic separation.l6 In either case, analysisb taking its warrant from an assumed specific and discrete disciplinary identity, adopts an implicitly 'meta' position: treat anything you are told by those you study as data for further analysis rather than a possible contribution to that analy- sis. 17 The work of achieving analytic separation is not only derived from a sense of unitary disciplinary identity but central to legitimizing that identity. Bau- drillard (1983) tells a story that seems apposite, if predictably melo- dramatic. In 1971, a group of anthropologists managed to persuade the Phillipino government to return some Tasaday Indians to a piece of virgin forest in order to prevent their incorporation, or decomposition, in the wider culture. Anthropologists thus worked to simulate an untouched state of nature prior to anthropology (ibid.:13-18). The key point is anthro- pology's contradictory dependence upon yet need for separation from its object of study. The preservation of the object of study is tied to its distance and difference from the discipline that studies it. The issue can be approached from a different angle. Deleuze and Guat- tari ( 1994) suggest that philosophy does not simply create concepts but con- structs and deploys 'conceptual personae'. Even the most apparently abstract and theoretical philosophical texts are inhabited, if sometimes in a barely discernible manner, by characters - the seeker after truth, the idiot, the expert and so forth. The implications of this for ethnographic texts are suggestive, if complex. It is perhaps easier to identify conceptual personae as figures in the ethnographic text; but the extent to which such figures are taken as referring to the empirical inquirer in the field introduces compli- cations.l8 It might for instance be argued that 'the stranger' perspective is insufficiently precise on the relation of researcher and textual figure. This would require a different and extensive discussion. I suggest however that the conceptual personae that inhabit traditional ethnographic, and more generally social scientific texts may be increasingly inappropriate for the changing nature of the relations of intellectual production that make up 'mode 2' knowledge. If the brief examples of representational work in computer science seem to bear the traces of these changing relations, in</page><page sequence="11">30 Geoff Cooper sometimes apparently contradictory ways, traditional forms of analytic order in social scientific representations may be viewed as increasingly tenuous accomplishments in the context of these emerging relations. CONCLUSION: TRANSFORMATIONS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE? I have attempted to articulate a sense of changing identities and relations within contemporary research, and have made use of the shorthand, 'modes 1 and 2'; however, it must be stressed that what is being proposed is not some form of clean break between one and another, but a much more complex, contradictory and dynamic process of emerging differentiations. Neither, therefore, am I suggesting the need for some kind of radically dis- continuous break with social scientific traditions. If the divisions between, and identities of disciplines seem to be more complex, this does not warrant the possibility of a move beyond disciplines in any simple sense;l9 it does however suggest the need for critical reflection upon the practice of social science in so far as it is derived from a quite different set of intellectual relations to those which appear to be emerging. This paper has focused upon an ethnographic study in which changing intellectual relations and structures form the topic for research; but it can be argued that there is a general need for some critical assessment of the significance of organiz- ational change for social science. Consider for example books on social science method and methodology. How many of them continue to assume a lone researcher who designs, carries out, interprets and writes up his or her own research? How many, by contrast, have begun to engage with the implications of the 'natural science' model which is, for various reasons, becoming the preferred norm and in which, for example, the fieldwork may be carried out by a contract researcher as part of a team?20 The issues are therefore, I argue, of general significance: the particular domain discussed here has the merit of bringing some of them into visible relief. The drift towards a different organizational context for research is one that is clearly apparent to social scientists in all domains. Following on from the government white paper on science, technology and its funding (Office of Science and Technology 1993), ESRC has made the relationship between social science and its 'users and beneficiaries' an explicit focus and priority, thereby placing a new emphasis on the utility and public accountability of social science research and encouraging new modes and channels of com- munication beyond traditional academic boundaries. In fact, the study I have discussed here was in some respects a relatively traditional form of research in this regard. This becomes apparent if we consider trends in the research system as a whole. Preliminary findings from a subsequent project investigating research collaboration between academics and industrialists are suggestive. Firstly, in the course of negotiating access to researchers, it was suggested to me by one of the co-ordinators of an EPSRC research ini- tiative that I think very carefully about what I could say that I had to offer</page><page sequence="12">Simulating difference 31 the people I proposed to interview. Secondly, and closely related, the dis- tinction between two dimensions upon which I have focused in this paper (collaboration and communication across boundaries, and relations between researcher and researched) looks an increasingly precarious one. In manufacturing engineering research for example, the industrial collab- orator may provide resources and access to particular corporate sites in return for a piece of academic research whose 'deliverables' (to use a very 'mode 2' term) would then include usable findings for the company. One can argue that many of the given elements of this emergent research system are not radically new; but it is the overall networks of relationships between them that warrants the assertion that significant organizational change is taking place. As social scientists we may be critical of this new network of relationships, of its associated forms of accountability, of the possible limits of the concept of 'user' that is in place, and of the criteria for assessing the value of research that are becoming increasingly domi- nant. Effective criticism, however, presupposes a proper critical engage- ment with these issues, and should be rooted in current conditions of possibility.2l I suggest that a crucial component of such a critical engage- ment is to take seriously the possible implications and consequences of these transformations for the very character and content of disciplines, not least the social sciences. In this respect, it seems to me that the following are among the impor- tant analytic issues and questions that might profitably be considered.22 First, if the difference of researcher and researched has always been poten- tially problematic, it becomes an increasingly fraught accomplishment in the service of analytic order if that order is based upon a unitary concep- tion of social science disciplines; for sociology is involved in different and more complex relations, whilst sociological knowledge is diffused in differ- ent ways through a wider disciplinary network. Second, the necessity of moving beyond a conception of sociology as, whether implicit or explicitly stated, a meta-level set of concepts and practices, becomes a practical and theoretical priority. In science studies this finds clear expression in Latour's work; a similar, though more complex formulation can be found in Derrida.23 The common thread between them lies in the practice of assemb- ling theories and concepts which are derived in part from the localized domain under study. This kind of strategy, of course, raises difficult ques- tions about the limits and boundaries of sociological expertise. The third and final point follows from these questions. Perhaps the very identity of sociology and sociological knowledge needs to be rethought. If it is more diffuse and differentiated in character perhaps, as one participant sug- gested in relation to computer science, it should become a distributed disci- pline serving different domains in quite different ways. Indeed, it would be easy to make the case that this is already happening, under the impact of theoretical and practical developments which radically problematize its unity: one can see this, for example, in the ways in which social science knowledge gets transformed as it enters new domains. The challenge is to</page><page sequence="13">32 Geoft Cooper find ways of preserving the potential insights of sociological knowledge in a situation in which, on the one hand it has potential relevance for an increasingly large number of areas, whilst on the other that expanding rel- evance may itself erode and fragment the unitary disciplinary base on which it has stood to date. If some of these particular formulations are arguable, I hope that the more general point that underlies this paper may be accepted: that the con- ditions of intellectual production which frame contemporary sociological work should be seen not as (mere) matters of policy which as such are peripheral to an essential disciplinary core but rather as having significant implications for disciplinary identity and practice. It is therefore important for the discipline's understanding of itself that these conditions themselves be theorized and analysed.

This paper discusses material from two projects funded by the ESRC, whose support is gratefully acknowledged: 'A sociological study of changing research culture', grant no R000232385; and 'Indus- trial-academic collaboration: the inter- action of cultural identities', grant no R000221525. Earlier versions of this paper have received constructive criticisms from a number of people: I would like to thank, in particular, two anonymous referees, John Bowers, Robert Cooper, Nigel Fielding, John Law, Mike Lynch, Greg Myers, and Dave Randall. Particular thanks are due to Steve Woolgar for extended discussion of some of the issues touched on here, and to the (anonymous) computer scientists who provided more than just data. 2. This paper makes reference to work within science and technology studies, and particularly to the sociology of scientific knowledge, but attempts, throughout, to draw out points of general significance for sociology. 3. This is a theme of particular signifi- cance in science and technology studies: Latour's (1993) distinctive treatment spells out some of the wider implications for . . socla. . sclence. 4. Notwithstanding their many qualifi- cations, Gibbons et al.'s classification of research in terms of a binary division between two distinct modes may seem to lead by default to an analytically tidy but empirically and conceptually inadequate model for describing the messiness of pro- cesses of transition. I suggest later in the paper that this kind of analytic order should be subjected to critical analysis. Nevertheless, it does serve as a convenient if highly provisional shorthand; its use here is a reflection of its methodic usefulness rather than an endorsement of its truth value (cf. Derrida 1978: 284). 5. Although independently funded by the ESRC, the projectwas in practice partly accountable to the PICT (Programme on Information and Communication Tech- nologies), since it was based at CRICT (Centre for Research into Innovation, Culture and Technology) which was set up as part of the PICT network. PICT placed considerable emphasis on the importance of opening up lines of communication with non-social scientists and non-aca- demics: for a discussion of some of the implications of this organizational frame- work for social science, see Cooper and Woolgar (1996). 6. This is not to say that participants may</page><page sequence="14">Simulating difference 33 not see and describe their behaviour in these terms. 7. It may be argued that ethnography, by its very nature, is committed to avoiding the fallacies of detached observation and distance that might be more easily associ- ated with very different kinds of research; but as I shall argue below, certain concepts and tropes may be seen to serve a not dis- similar function. 8. Nor is the diffusion of social scien- tific concerns to ostensibly technical disci- plines restricted to computer science. A more recent study that I have undertaken of industrial-academic collaboration in manufacturing engineering points to some similarities. On one visit to interview members of a well established research group, all of whom were trained as engi- neers, I was asked if I knew 'any good social scientists' who might be interested in joining them. Another researcher described his work as action research, grounded in social science, and felt the only merit of his engineering qualifi- cations lay in the credibility they afforded when dealing with industrialists. 9. This should not be overstated: the same individual, on my recommendation, read Latour and Woolgar ( 1986) to better understand the rationale for ethnographic studies of science. He did this whilst suffer- ing from flu and claimed that the book's constructionist claims had outraged him to the point of hindering his recovery. 10. In particular, he had in mind a much cited software engineering paper on the 'faking' of scientific method (Parnas and Clements 1986). 11. Deconstruction provides a fertile source of concepts and arguments that are highly relevant here: see for example, Derrida (1978) and Bennington (1994) on the dangers of confusing the conceptual and the empirical. 12. Bourdieu's call for a version of reflexivity which takes account of the struc- ture of both the academic field and the field being studied is pertinent here (Bour- dieu and Wacquant 1992), the more so since in this domain one field, albeit heterogeneous and differentiated, impli- cates both subject and object of study. 13. The choice of example is informed by the influence that this recommendation has had within the sociology of scientific knowledge and related work. This example also constitutes a particularly clear formu- lation of the issue I wish to address. 14. McHoul (1982) raises some general problems with the distinction in relation to reading, whilst Lynch (1993) clarifies the implications of this and a number of related distinctions for science studies. The continuing relevance of the dis- tinction can be seen in discussions of ethnomethodology's respecification of foundational social scientific matters (Button 1991). 15. For example, contra Garfinkel, the reflexivity of accounts and settings is by no means 'essentially uninteresting' to par- ticipants in this domain: the rejection of one proposal was accounted for by point- ing out that given its topic - 'co-operation support in the software process' - the degree of visible integration of different parties within the proposal was probably inadequate. 16. In science studies the specific source which advocates this approach is Latour and Woolgar ( 1986), drawing on a phenomenological tradition: see especially Schutz (1964). 17. Cf. Said (1989) on anthropology and indigenous African knowledge. It must be stressed that if work within ethno- methodology can be criticized for its recourse to a meta-level, it is also the case that this 'tradition' provides indispensable resources for such a critique; see Lynch (1993). 18. In one sense, the discussions of tex- tuality in ethnography could be seen as centering on this relation: see for example Clifford and Marcus (1986). 19. Latour's monograph on the prob- lems of the concept of 'modernity' argues against such radical intellectual disconti- nuities, yet effectively suggests that a better understanding of the world can be achieved through a transcendence of the limitations of disciplinary division (Latour 1993). Derrida's thinking of the 'limit', of the necessity of making use of the resources of an intellectual tradition to criticize it, and thus of the difficulty of simply exiting from such a tradition seem particularly relevant here; see Critchley (1992).</page><page sequence="15">34 Geoft Cooper 20. The notion that ethnographic studies can have a 'principal investigator' who never sets foot in the field has always struck me as particularly absurd. However, this view is, in practice, becoming some- what archaic. As I have discovered, design- ing research projects which do not employ others may well be seen as ill-advised or even selfish. 21. In this respect at least, Hork- heimer's ( 1976) formulation of 'critical theory' remains important. Critical theory both affirms the need for criticism and rejects the adoption of a simple transcen- dental or utopian standpoint. In this it has something in common with deconstruc- tion. The implications of avoiding 'meta- level' positions for the issues discussed here are evident in Derrida's (1983) sug- gestion that the notion of knowledge for its own sake is becoming an increasingly proW lematic resource for the (important) task of critically engaging with the widespread tendency to define knowledge in instru- mental or technological terms. 22. Some of the issues raised by this paper may also be seen as ethical ones. Although there is no space to develop this here, much of my argument about the stance that we take towards those we study implies a particular ethic of inquiry: Rabinow (1996) contains a particularly illuminating discussion of this. 23. See respectively Latour ( 1993), and Bennington (1994); see also Serres with Latour ( 1995) . Latour's rejection of meta- level theorizing also entails a proposal to dispense with pure categories such as social or technical. While this clearly has far reaching consequences for the disci- plines from which these categories emerge, the precise implicatons have not yet, perhaps, been satisfactorily specified (see note 19 above).
