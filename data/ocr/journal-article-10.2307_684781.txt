Freudenburg,2,3 Scott Frickel,4 and Robert Gramling5 Sociological efforts to understand environment-society relationships fall primarily into four conceptual categories. The first three, involving analytical separation, analytical primacy, and balanced dualism, all draw distinctions between biophysical and social aspects of human experience, with subsequent analyses being based on these a priori distinctions. The fourth or constructivist approach questions this naturalized dichotomy, calling attention instead to mutual contingency or conjoint constitution: What we take to be "physical facts" are likely to be strongly shaped by social construction processes, and at the same time, what we take to be "strictly social" will often have been shaped in part by taken-for-granted realities of the physical world. Technology offers important opportunities for tracing these interconnections, being an embodiment of both the physical and the social. The point is illustrated with a long-term historical analysis of a specific physiographic feature-a mountain-that has undergone little overt physical change over the centuries, but has undergone repeated changes in its social meanings and uses. Few of the changes would have been possible in the absence of the mountain's physiographic characteristics; similarly, few would have occurred in the absence of changing sociocultural definitions and possibilities. The challenge for sociology is not just to recognize the importance of both the physical and the social factors, and certainly not to argue over the relative importance of the two, but to recognize the extent to which what we take to be 'physical" and "social" factors can be conjointly constituted. 1The paper's subtitle is intended as a tribute to Aldo Leopold and to one of his most famous essays (1949). 2Department of Rural Sociology, 350 Agriculture Hall, 1450 Linden Drive, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706. 3To whom correspondence should be addressed. 4Department of Sociology, 1180 Observatory Drive, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706. 5Department of Sociology, P.O.

INTRODUCTION As noted by Buttel's Annual Review article (1986), the group who be- came known as "environmental sociologists" during the mid-1970s looked at the time for nothing less than the reorientation of sociology, but the growth of sociological attention to the physical environment has since been quite slow (see also Krogman and Darlington, 1995). To some extent, of course, both the enthusiasm of the early expectations and the limited nature of the subsequent influence can be attributed to the relative youth of the specialty area, and perhaps also to the failure to recognize in advance the sheer magnitude of the challenges involved. This paper will argue, however, that additional difficulties have been created by the ways in which the cen- tral focus of environmental sociology-"the study of interrelationships be- tween society and the environment"-has been conceptualized (Humphrey and Buttel, 1982:4; see also Dunlap and Catton, 1979; Schnaiberg, 1980). The paper is divided into four sections. The first discusses the main logical possibilities for dealing with "interrelationships between society and the environment," noting that the approaches used in most work to date are not the only ones that are possible, and may not be the ones that will ulti- mately prove most fruitful. The second section notes the connections between concepts and methods, and suggests that for studies of society-environment relationships, there is a particular need to have studies that are explicitly com- parative, both across time and across space. The third and longest section responds to this point with a case study that is intended to illustrate the extent to which "physical reality" and the processes of social definition are mutually contingent. For clarity of illustration, the case study focuses on a given physiographic feature, a mountain, that has undergone little more than su- perficial change in terms of its objective physical characteristics, but that scarcely could have changed more dramatically in terms of what its apparently objective characteristics were seen as being. In the fourth and final section, implications for future research and analysis are discussed. LOGICAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENT-SOCIETY RELATIONSHIPS Aside from the insistence that no distinction should be drawn between the physical and the social, there are four main perspectives from which 362 Freudenburg et al.</page><page sequence="3">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide "the interrelationships between society and nature" can be viewed. The three most common approaches share at least to some extent a focus on the de- gree to which the physical and the social are different. The fourth approach, in contrast, focuses on the degree to which the two are mutually contingent. Analytical Separation While sociological analyses of past decades have dealt in many ways with the biophysical environment, perhaps the most common approach- aside from ignoring it, or treating it as "irrelevant to a sociological analysis of action" (Klausner, 1971:2)-has been straightforward analytical separa- tion. Such an analysis was the focus of one of the earliest articles in a mainstream sociological journal to have considered the matter explicitly (Bernard, 1925), and more broadly, in analyses that span the political spec- trum, sociological thinkers have tended to develop typologies that share the characteristic of placing material or environmental influences on the opposite side of a line from social, human, or symbolic influences. Having been so categorized, biophysical influences have often been dropped from subsequent attention, although in many cases significant effort has gone into identifying sociologically relevant differences between the influences that are defined as biophysical and those that are defined as social. At the "critical" end of the spectrum, for example, Marx developed "historical materialism" as a reaction to and as an extension of the Idealist tradition espoused by Comte, Hegel and others; rather than sharing the Idealists' concerns about the struggle of mind and spirit, Marx focused on the differences between the conceptual and the material. This distinction did not mean ignoring the biophysical world; instead, Marx saw "the mode of production of material life" as "condition[ing] the social, political, and intellectual life process in general" (Marx and Engels, 1955:363). At the "functional" end of the spectrum, similarly, Parsons (1960) chose to sepa- rate the physical environment, analytically, from the other components of his "cybernetic hierarchy." In his model, "the behavioral organism" was viewed as the "point of contact with the physical environment. The per- sonality system is, in turn, a system of control over the behavioral organism; the social system, over the personalities of its participating members; and the cultural system, a system of control relative to social systems" (Parsons, 1960:38). In this top-down scheme, the physical environment assumed a basic but largely passive role-one that was effectively separated, analyti- cally, from the behavioral, social and cultural systems that were seen as playing out their more active roles on the physical platform thus provided. 363</page><page sequence="4">Freudenburg et al. While environmental sociologists have often been critical of what Cat- ton and Dunlap (1978:42) call the "fundamental anthropocentrism" under- lying virtually all sociological theories, even the work of environmental sociologists often takes as its starting point the analytical separation of the biophysical from the social. The definition quoted at the start of this paper, to offer a simple example, involves "interrelationships between society and environment," suggesting that a distinction between "society" and "environ- ment" has been presupposed. A similar distinction is also evident in the work of Schnaiberg (1980), who not only emphasizes differences in patterns of pro- duction and accumulation between ecological and human systems, but con- cludes that contemporary environmental problems may be understood as resulting in part from the contradictions between the two. "[I]f the ecosystem changes over time from a simpler, faster-growing one to a more complex, slower-growing entity, almost the reverse is true of human econo- mies. . . . Such a distinction between society and ecosystem growth patterns implies not only contradictory models, but somewhat antagonistic ones. ... It is this contradiction between society and ecosystem surplus utili- zation that leads to a conflict between ecosystem growth and maintenance" (Schnaiberg, 1980:19-21; for a more recent statement, see also Schnaiberg and Gould, 1994). Analytical Primacy One obvious possibility opened by the distinction between the social and the environmental is for one of these two sets of factors to be given much greater emphasis than the other-or conversely, for the argument to be made that the wrong set of factors is being given such attention. The phenomenon of analytical primacy has a similarly long history in sociology, dating back to Comte's argument that sociology was in essence a biological science, at one extreme (for a more detailed discussion, see Dickens, 1992:19-20), or Durkheim's insistence (1893/1933), at the other, that social facts should be explained only in terms of other social facts. Perhaps the best-known example of causal primacy is the "environmental determinism" associated with Huntington (see, e.g., Huntington, 1924), among other authors-and with racism, among other implications. So strong were socio- logical reactions against the determinists that some authors have even gone so far as Stanley (1968:855), arguing that "the main accomplishment and direction of the social sciences to date" should be seen as involving "the progressive substitution of sociocultural explanations for those stressing the determinative influence of physical nature." Even today, among those who give analytical primacy to sociocultural factors, it is possible to level the 364</page><page sequence="5">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide charge of "environmental determinism" toward any analyses that "suggest that biological or environmental factors have any degree of influence upon human affairs" (Dunlap and Catton, 1983:117, emphasis in original). In recent years, however, sociological attention has also begun to be devoted to a second, complementary form of analytical primacy-sociocul- tural determinism, or what Dunlap and Catton (1979:250) call "human ex- emptionalism," in reference to the belief that the exceptional characteristics of homo sapiens can "somehow exempt humans from ecological principles and from environmental influences and constraints." In its pure form, so- ciocultural determinism involves the assertion that "the physical properties of the situation may be ignored" (Choldin, 1978:353). Given the challenges of dealing simultaneously with social and environmental influences, it is also possible to identify a less severe form of analytical primacy that ap- pears to be far more common, involving not so much a decision as an omis- sion. While relatively few of today's sociological analyses are likely to feature an explicit statement that the physical environment can safely be ignored, the unfortunate reality is that the physical environment often is ignored, nevertheless. Not having considered the question explicitly, the analyses often embrace the same assumption implicitly, largely ignoring bio- physical variables even where such variables are clearly relevant (for an illustration and an insightful analysis of the problem, see Guterbock, 1990). Dualistic Balance This third possibility is one that is likely to come as little surprise to anyone who is familiar with the history of intellectual controversies, but that has nevertheless been as slow to emerge in studies of society-environ- ment relationships as in many other such debates. Like other balance-seek- ing approaches, this is one that attempts to acknowledge the importance of both sets of considerations-the social and the biophysical-doing so in a way that is intended to reflect even-handedness or balance. The perspec- tive is perhaps most often associated with Buttel (1986, 1987) or with Hum- phrey and Buttel (1982), who have described humans as being a "dualistic" species. On the one hand, human societies are influenced/constrained by environmental realities; as Cottrell pointed out more than a third of a cen- tury ago, the availability of an environmental resource such as energy "lim- its what [a social entity] can do and influences what [that entity] will do" (Cottrell, 1955:2, emphasis in original). At the same time, however, "human beings . . . are unique among the animal kingdom in their capacity for culture and symbolic communication" (Buttel, 1986:338). As a result, efforts to give analytical primacy to either set of considerations-social or bio- 365</page><page sequence="6">Freudenburg et al. physical-can be ill-advised. While the dualism has led sociologists over the years to attempt "both to embrace and to dissociate themselves from biological knowledge and arguments" (Buttel, 1986:338), this perspective holds that the greater need is not so much to choose between these two sets of influences, but to recognize the importance of both. The emphasis on a balanced or dualistic approach is one that has con- siderable strengths, but it still shares with the other two approaches a natu- ralized or taken-for-granted tendency to view the physical and the social as separate and distinct. What is still needed, we believe, is a greater awareness of the extent to which (what we take to be) the physical is influenced by (what we take to be) the social, and vice versa. In essence, while the first three approaches all share a starting assumption that the physical and the social should be separated analytically, we see a need to take this assumption not as a point of departure, but as a point that needs to be subjected to analysis itself. The basic assumption of the fourth and final approach, ac- cordingly, involves not separation, but mutual contingency. Conjoint Constitution The fourth approach begins by acknowledging that what have commonly been taken to be "physical facts" are likely in many cases to have been shaped strongly by social construction processes, while at the same time, even what appear to be "strictly social" phenomena are likely to have been shaped in important if often overlooked ways by the fact that social behaviors often respond to stimuli and constraints from the biophysical world. This idea draws from but also differs from the accumulating tradition on the construction of scientific knowledge (see, e.g., Bloor, 1991; Knorr-Cet- ina, 1981; Latour and Woolgar, 1986). One of the inferences that can be drawn from the growing body of work in the sociology of science (see, e.g., Pickering, 1993) is that any distinction between "physical facts" and "social definitions" may prove on closer examination to be more problematic than a simple separation would suggest, and that the nature of any such distinction is likely to be deserving of critical inquiry. (For a similar view on what he terms an "indissoluble" interaction between the environmental and the ge- netic, see Lewontin, 1991:30.) Within the sociology of scientific practice, how- ever, this point has led increasingly (see, e.g., Callon and Latour, 1992; Pickering, 1993) to discussions of "material agency," while the direction being taken in this paper is a different and in many ways a simpler one. The distinction begins with the notion of "agency." Within much of sociology today, of course, "agency" has come to take on a very different meaning than it possesses in most other disciplines, where an "agent" is a 366</page><page sequence="7">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide person or institution that acts on behalf of some other person or institu- tion-as in the case of a real estate agent, insurance agent, baseball agent, or virtually any other "agent" outside of our own discipline. In much of the sociological literature, by contrast, the emphasis is on essentially inde- pendent actions, often (but not always) involving independent volition and the decision to act or refrain from acting. Even in a laboratory, of course, some aspect of the biophysical environment can seem to "have a mind of its own," to quote a recent observation by a frustrated physical science col- league. Inside of the laboratory or out, moreover, many of the nonhuman elements of the biophysical world clearly do "act," as shown for example by hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and a broad variety of other phenomena, as well as in the nearly infinite ranges of behaviors of living organisms. In other cases, however-including the case of the mountain that will be dis- cussed later in this paper-a relevant portion of the environment basically just "sits there," doing little if anything, while being acted upon or ignored by humans. Whether the environment is seen as "acting" or as "sitting," however, it is seen as doing so by human beings. In short-lest there be any confusion-we wish to state explicitly that we do not impute any volition or will to the biophysical environment; nei- ther do we see a great deal to be gained, at least for the purposes of the present paper, by entering into the ongoing debates over "material agency" and related issues within the sociology of science. The intent of the present paper, and of our concept of "conjoint constitution," is instead to point out that human beings who have thought about "environment" and "soci- ety" have often been hindered as well as helped by the hidden assumptions that are often built into the ways in which the two concepts have been distinguished in the past.5 5Past readers of this paper have experienced enough difficulty in understanding the difference between our approach and the recent debates within the sociology of science that a relatively extensive explanation would appear to be required. The explanation is being provided in a footnote so that readers who do not have difficulty in assessing our point on its own terms will not be required to deal with a discussion that is necessarily as much a digression as an explanation. Within the sociology of science, potential difficulties discussing "agency" for the nonhuman, material world have recently been handled in three main ways. The first, perhaps best exemplified by Collins and Yearley (1992), is to argue for retaining a focus on human agency, not material agency. The second, perhaps best exemplified by Callon and Latour (1992), has been to draw more heavily on semiotics-not in the classic sense of analyzing the relationships between the symbol and the symbolized, but more loosely, as involving the analysis of texts themselves. In the texts produced by scientists, after all-as in those produced by novelists, as exemplified by Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea (1952)-portions of the physical world can move back and forth relatively smoothly "between being real entities and social constructs" (Pickering, 1993:563) as well as between being actors and "actants." The third and arguably most sophisticated approach involves what Pickering (1993) calls "the dialectic of resistance and accommodation," or more poetically, "the mangle," in which sci entists encounter "resistance" from aspects of the physical world that fail to match expectations, 367</page><page sequence="8">Freudenburg et al. showing "accommodation" to those forms of resistance through subsequent modifications of scientific theory and practice. Even collectively, however, these responses are insufficient to meet the needs of an improved understanding of the interrelationships of society, environment, and technology. We do not quarrel with the potential value of a semiotic approach for those who wish to understand scientific texts, and neither do we argue against the potential value of analyzing "the dialectic of resistance and accommodation" for those whose focus is not so much on understanding society, itself, as on understanding scientific practice in its temporally emergent form. For those of us who do wish to understand society itself, however, and to understand the ways in which what we have traditionally seen as "society" is affected by as well as affecting what we have traditionally seen as "the environment" and "technology," the responses within the sociology of science are insufficient. The problems with attempting to reformulate the present discussion in terms of recent thinking within the sociology of science include matters of simplicity/clarity and of conflicts with the main thrust of our argument. We turn first to the issue of simplicity/clarity. It is of course possible to refer to material "agency" and then to come up with a relatively sophisticated discussion of how and why such a choice is not an act of anthropomorphism, or of imputing human qualities to nonhuman animals and things, as in Pickering's emphasis on "the dialectic of resistance and accommodation," but it is only possible to do so through a relatively circuitous and logically dangerous (if "thrilling") route. For those of us who work within the traditions of environmental sociology, a far simpler option is available in Cottrell's much older but also more elegant formulation, noted above, that the availability of an environmental resource such as energy "limits what [a social entity] can do and influences what [that entity] will do" (Cottrell, 1955:2, emphasis in original; see also Firey, 1960). Like the concept of "possibilism" from geography, moreover, the common expectation in environmental sociology is that environmental resources do not merely "resist"-they can also be said to "encourage." The absence of iron ore makes it highly unlikely that an iron-mining enterprise will achieve a profit, but at the same time, the presence of particularly rich ores can make it possible for iron mining not just to take place-and indeed, the ores can even be said to "attract" attention and to "reward" successful mining companies with high levels of profits. Pickering's discussion of "resistance" (see especially Pickering, 1993:582-583) offers some evidence that he is aware of the possibility for positive as well as negative implications of material agency, but the simpler course of action, and the preferable one for present purposes, is to avoid such detours altogether. The other issue is that an effort to force this paper's analysis to fit within the confines of recent thinking in the sociology of science would run counter to the broader goal of the paper itself. The specific focus of this paper, and the specific case study chosen to illustrate that focus, both have to do with sociological thinking about "the environment." More broadly, the paper's overarching theme is that concepts-and the habits that are often developed through customary modes of thinking with and about those concepts-can offer blinders as well as binoculars, constraining as well as contributing to insights. To reiterate, while we see the concept of "conjoint constitution" as having important links to the constructivist school in the sociology of science-and in sociology more broadly (see especially Berger and Luckman, 1966)-the point we are making here is in principle not just different but in many ways simpler than those being made in recent debates over material agency in the sociology of science literature. We are arguing that the dividing line between the "physical" and "social" should be remembered for what it is-a human construct that can offer a useful analytical convenience under the proper circumstances but that can also prove to be awkward, arbitrary, or an overt impediment to understanding, particularly when that dividing line becomes reified. Rather than taking sides in the ongoing debates within the sociology of science, we attempt in this paper to make and to illustrate our own point-the point that even what have traditionally been taken to be "physical facts" are likely to have been shaped in important if often overlooked ways by social construction processes, and even what have traditionally been seen as "strictly social" phenomena are likely to have been shaped as well by responses to the physical world. 368</page><page sequence="9">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide The notion of conjoint constitution goes well beyond matters of pref- erences or tastes. It is widely accepted that questions of beauty or aesthetic appeal are "in the eye of the beholder," but the point we are making is far broader, encompassing even what are widely taken to be "the" tangible characteristics of the physical environment. In the interest of offering the clearest possible examples, the following discussion will thus largely ignore matters of beauty, aesthetics, preferences, and tastes. The more challenging task is to illustrate the mutual contingency of the physical and the social in terms of tangible use values, focusing not on "mere matters of taste," but on what are commonly called "practical" or "rational" economic ac- tivities. To deal with that challenge, we will focus on what are often referred to as "natural" resources, and on that complex combination of social and physical factors known as "technology." Given the number of assumptions that are often embedded within past approaches to these concepts, it is necessary to examine both a bit more carefully before we turn to their il- lustration. A NOTE ON CONCEPTS AND METHODS Natural resource is a term that is commonly applied to a feature or substance in the biophysical environment that is seen as possessing eco- nomic value. While the term is often seen as referring to physical charac- teristics, however, what are called "natural" resources are in fact social as well as natural; they are products of historically contingent sociocultural definitions just as much as they are products of biogeochemical processes. Much as feminist critiques of science have demonstrated the blind spots created by the ways in which scientists have historically "naturalized" gen- der biases (see, e.g., Keller, 1985, or the various essays in Tuana, 1989), there appears to be a need for attention to what might be called "the natu- ralization of 'nature."' Rather than illustrating the conjoint constitution of the physical and the social, unfortunately, the usual terminology and modes of thinking tend to obscure the connections, affecting not only what is seen and how it is seen, but also influencing what is unseen-effectively being taken for granted and thus subsequently disappearing from view. Indeed these are "resources," at least within the context of a given time and place, and indeed they come from nature. The reasons for defining them as re- sources, however, are social as well as natural. Still, it is possible to place so great an emphasis on the importance of social construction processes as to overlook not just the importance of the resources' physical charac- 369</page><page sequence="10">teristics, but also the extent to which physical characteristics can shape so- cial construction processes. A similar point applies to technology. If one is forced to render a verdict that technology is either physical or social, the likelihood of coming up with a sensible answer may be quite small-if only because of the pre- suppositions that are hidden within the framing of the question. Law and Bijker (1992:290) have already noted that "what we call the social is bound together as much by the technical as by the social," but the point we make here is in some respects the complement of theirs. On the one hand, tech- nology is inherently a social product. It is the result of human ingenuity, manipulation, exertion, creativity, blind spots, and other human strengths and weaknesses, and it is often capable of changing what we understand to be "the" physical limits of a system. On the other hand, technology is also inherently physical, shaped by biophysical factors that are sometimes likely to be taken for granted and at other times to be taken as problematic, but that in practice can rarely be ignored with impunity-as illustrated by everything from "human" flight, to habitable buildings near the north and south poles, to the electronic transfer of documents that physically remain in their initial locations. In the absence of fuel or properly working engines and wings, heavier-than-air transportation devices can and do fall out of the sky; except for traditional dwellings of the Inupiat and other indigenous peoples, habitable buildings in polar regions depend on the importing of energy and insulating materials; and even the electronic transfer of docu- ments can only take place through the physical flows of electronic currents through appropriately designed circuits and across space. Technology, in short, is one of those aspects of human existence that lies at the confluence of the physical and the social; it is inherently and inevitably shaped by both. While it is of course possible to argue whether technology should be seen as predominantly "physical" or "social," or even to get caught up in the excitement of the ensuing debate, that is scarcely the approach that appears most likely to lead to improved levels of understanding. An even- handed or dualistic approach-seeing technology, like natural resources, as being part social and part physical-would represent a significant advance, if only by avoiding the need to invest so much energy in an ultimately dis- tracting debate. An emphasis on mutual contingency or conjoint constitu- tion goes one step further, however, highlighting rather than sidestepping the fact that the attempted allocation into "social" and "physical" catego- ries may have the potential to contribute as much to confusion as to un- derstanding. At an analytical level, of course, it is often possible to identify sources of influence that are more nearly social, vs. those that are more nearly physical, but ultimately, it can prove to be no more possible to effect a clean and unambiguous separation of the physical and the social than to 370 Freudenburg et al.</page><page sequence="11">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide saw apart the north and south poles of a magnet: Even if the magnet is sawed precisely in half, the net result will be two new magnets, each with a north and south pole. This is far from being a claim that the two are identical; clearly they are not. It is an observation, instead, that the two are perhaps best understood not in terms of their distinctions, but their fundamental interconnectedness-of comprehending not the separations but the inseparability. While there is a need for greater clarity in our conceptualization, there is also a need for clear thinking about the implications of our meth- ods. In particular, there is a need for attention to a different form of in- terconnectedness that is also often overlooked-in this case, involving the interconnections between our concepts and our methods. To be more spe- cific, there is a need to recognize the special form of impaired vision that results when studies are insufficiently comparative, both across time and across locations. Even where environmental factors exert profound influ- ences on social life, in other words, those influences can be easy to overlook unless our studies are sufficiently comparative to allow our "variables" to vary (cf. Freudenburg and Gramling, 1994a). If our goal is to understand the importance of physical environmental factors, accordingly, it is important for our studies to consider (at least) a significant range of variation in environmental settings (see, for example, the work of Guterbock, 1990, on the implications of snowfall for urban settlement patterns, or of Freudenburg and Gramling, 1993 and 1994b, on the importance of physical environments for understanding a set of so- ciopolitical conflicts). If we wish to understand more clearly the importance of technology, on the other hand, it can prove more important to emphasize variation in time, allowing for significant historical variation in sociotech- nical systems (cf. Cronon, 1991, 1992; Worster, 1990), although in some cases we may wish to confine the study to a single location in an effort to hold as constant as possible the effects of the actual physical setting itself. It is this latter approach that we will employ in the present paper. The polarization in a number of earlier discussions makes it necessary to underline two points before moving to the illustration that follows. The first is that we are not arguing that the biophysical characteristics of a re- source or a technical system are somehow irrelevant; indeed, they provide a necessary though insufficient underpinning for the use of such resources by any given form of human technology. Second, we are also not arguing that sociocultural processes are irrelevant, or that characteristics of the bio- physical environment, in and of themselves, could be said to "determine" social consequences. With the possible exception of the forms of resource use that do not vary significantly across cultures-e.g., through the act of 371</page><page sequence="12">Freudenburg et al. breathing-sociocultural factors could also be said to provide necessary but insufficient conditions for any given form of resource use. The broader point, however, has to do instead with conjoint constitu- tion: The physical characteristics do matter, but they matter in a way that depends to a large degree on the practices, perspectives, and technologies that are taken for granted in a given time and place. At the same time, the social definitions of the situation can depend-in unrecognized as well as recognized ways-on the physical environment, both in its raw form and as modified by past human activity. The relevant challenge is thus not to explore the extent to which one set of factors or the other can be ignored or forgotten, but instead to understand the extent to which each can be- come a taken-for-granted part of the other-and to realize that it is the taken-for-grantedness itself (cf. Freudenburg and Gramling, 1992, 1994c) that can lead to ill-advised assumptions about what appear to be "natural" physical conditions or "strictly social" factors. The point is one that can be illustrated, moreover, with a physical feature that is literally as solid as a mountain. THE MEANINGS OF A MOUNTAIN Today's road maps show a small city along the Michigan-Wisconsin border known as Iron Mountain, but the name is one that has long be- longed to more than just the city itself. The opening paragraph of Walter Nursey's (1891:87) description of the city makes reference to an "abrupt spur of hills which determine the boundaries of the local Iron Mountain." The range or "abrupt spur of hills" makes up a ridge that runs parallel to what we now know as the Menominee River, with a number of the hills rising hundreds of feet above the surrounding terrain. Over the years, the name of "Iron Mountain" has also been attached to at least one specific peak along this ridge, and to a popular tourist attraction that will be dis- cussed further below; in this paper, however, except where elsewhere speci- fied, we will be using the convention of a number of earlier writers such as Nursey, using the term of "Iron Mountain" to refer to the entire ridge (see Fig. 1). In many ways, of course, Iron Mountain provides testimony that noth- ing in nature is more constant than change. For centuries, the temperatures on the surface have dipped well below freezing each winter, while often becoming quite hot in the intervening summers. Storms have attacked, sometimes with fury; waters have flowed both across the surface and below it; plants, animals, and human beings have gone through countless cycles of change, many of them literally involving matters of life and death. Yet 372</page><page sequence="13">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide 1 0 1 2 3 M'LFS L I i I Fig. 1. Map of Menominee district showing distribution of iron formation. The "South Iron Range" here corresponds to Iron Mountain as we refer to it in the text. The numbered boxes mark areas from which existing reserves have been estimated (Source: Bayley et al., 1966:89). The inset situates Iron Mountain with respect to the Wisconsin-Michigan border and Lake Michigan. in the larger terms of the physiographic feature-the mountain itself- physical changes large enough to be measured in more than a fraction of a single percent of the mountain's mass have taken place only on a geo- logical scale of time, occurring only over hundreds of thousands of years. Geologists have long since made it known that nature has no such thing as "everlasting" hills, but from the perspective of a human span of life, a mountain such as this one may be the nearest reasonable approximation. Indeed, for the period of the last several thousand years, and particularly for the mere centuries that will be the major focus of our discussion, one of the defining characteristics of what we now call Iron Mountain has been a high degree of constancy in the midst of change. As is the case for most mountains, this is one that has long stood in the same place and that, in other physiographic terms as well, has changed only in the tiniest of ways over the several thousand years during which it has been known to humans. While the ridge itself has undergone very little change over the cen- turies, however, changing definitions of natural resources have led to dif- ferences in social outcomes that could scarcely have been more dramatic. In the interest of simplicity, it is useful to discuss the often-gradual changes in terms of phases, although the dividing lines between the phases need to be understood more in heuristic than in literal terms. Five such phases can be readily identified and will be discussed below. 373</page><page sequence="14">Freudenburg et al. Phase I: Hunting Grounds and Living Space The first known phase of human definitions was one that apparently lasted for centuries, up through the era when the region was first visited and then settled by European-American immigrants. In 1634, when the French explorer Jean Nicolet stepped onto the shores of what would be- come the state of Wisconsin, he encountered a people his Huron compan- ions called Menominee, which means "Wild Rice People" (McKenney and Hall, 1933:273, note 1). For the most part, the Menominee were concen- trated along the shores of the head of Green Bay, and along the Fox and Menominee rivers, with their principal village having been located at the mouth of the Menominee River (Quimby, 1960:142). Archaeological re- search has uncovered evidence of a settlement three miles upstream from the present-day city of Iron Mountain (Bath, 1992), but neither the ethno- graphic nor the archaeological record would indicate that the mountain itself, or its ores, were considered to have any greater significance than did the other hills nearby. The significance the mountain did have was pre- dominantly spiritual, rather than economic; the Menominee worldview was predicated upon the existence of a spiritual realm that infused the physical world. Their religion, like that of their Ojibwa neighbors, was an animistic one, emphasizing a direct relationship with all objects of the material world-including what we now call "inanimate" objects and events, such as stars, storms, lakes, and of course hills and mountains (Hickerson, 1970:16). For the Menominee, everything possessed a magical spirit aspect that rendered it both powerful and sacred. From the vantage point of an industrialized culture, the interpenetra- tion of the physical and the social is perhaps easiest to see during this first and longest phase of human contact with the mountain. Like the other indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region, the Menominee lived in im- mediate contact with the physical environment; the Bay and the many rivers and tributaries offered an abundance of fish as well as access into the in- terior of the peninsula, where wild game was hunted and, in early summer, berries gathered. A semisedentary people, the Menominee also engaged in agricultural practices, cultivating maize, squash, beans, and tobacco, and as the Huron name for them suggests, harvesting the wild rice that grew in the muskegs and shallow stream beds (Quimby, 1960:143). They engaged in subsistence manufacturing as well, with products that included baskets, mats, medicine bags, twine, snowshoes, boats, and tanned hides (Hoffman, 1896:258-264; see also Hodge, 1979). With European encroachment into the Great Lakes region, the Menominee culture came under ever-increasing pressures-social, political and economic-particularly from the rapidly expanding fur trade (for a dis- 374</page><page sequence="15">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide cussion, see Wolf, 1982). The earliest known Europeans in the area, French trappers, had a much more economic orientation toward nature, and they also had a technology that, while it generally would not be described today as "industrial," did exploit the natural surroundings more extensively. The trappers, however, shared with the Menominee a continued tendency to define "the" natural resources of the mountain in terms of the resources on the surface. For the Menominee, meanwhile, the focus of activity re- mained largely the same, even though their uses of the physical environ- ment-whether involving pine and birch bark canoes, the rivers they traveled on, or the beaver that lived in the rivers-came increasingly to be conditioned by considerations of profit. Phase 2: Physical Feature and Source of Timber The next distinctive phase in the meaning of the mountain, accord- ingly, might best be seen as dating not to the time of initial European con- tact, but to the arrival of a different set of European-Americans. This second phase could be seen as beginning in the 1830s and 1840s, when the region was first being settled by English-speaking residents of what were soon to become the states of Michigan and Wisconsin, and when the proc- essing of raw materials began to be performed in ways that were more capital-intensive and "industrial." Even so, Iron Mountain and the sur- rounding hills and gullies of the Menominee Range tended to be viewed during this phase not as natural resources, but as natural annoyances. Ironi- cally, this view appears to have been particularly salient among those who were engaged in mining; given that its location offered an inconvenient need for detours between the mineral resources in Calumet and Copper Harbor, on the one hand, and the loading docks along the northern shore of Green Bay, on the other, Iron Mountain and its surrounding terrain were generally seen not so much as a resource as an obstacle, particularly in the eyes of the copper mining companies that were already hard at work to the north. At the same time, physiography apparently did contribute to the mountain's usefulness for the early surveyors of the region; while its height created significant nuisance value for surface transportation, particularly for those who were on foot, it also offered obvious advantages for the efforts to survey and map the region. According to the guides who take today's visitors through a tour of the "Iron Mountain Iron Mine," however, these same surveyors quickly learned that the mountain was significantly less valu- able for mapping purposes than might originally have been intended: The mountain is so full of iron ore, and the ore is so rich, that these surveyors' 375</page><page sequence="16">Freudenburg et al. compasses simply would not work accurately. According to other knowl- edgeable local residents, the main example of this problem actually oc- curred on the Marquette Range, farther north-a point of disagreement that may not need to be resolved today, roughly one and a half centuries later. There are two points, however, on which all relevant observers are in agreement. One is that Iron Mountain was known by the 1840s to contain the physical resource of iron ore; the other is that, even though the Euro- pean-Americans differed significantly from the Native Americans in the level of value that their culture placed on that ore, little was done for the next quarter of a century to mine it. The first clear mention of iron deposits in the Menominee Range- the range that includes Iron Mountain-came in a congressional report of 1844-1845 by George H. Sanders. He and his survey crew were mapping out the Menominee River in the interest of constructing a road from Green Bay, on Lake Michigan, to Copper Harbor, on Lake Superior (Cummings, 1984:3). A report by U.S. geologists six years later supported Sanders's ob- servations, and added more detail: " . . . the bed is exposed . . . at sev- eral points along the west side of a hill which is about one hundred feet, showing nothing but slaty iron ore on its summit for a distance of forty rods. The real extent of this deposit is concealed . . . but it probably ex- tends eastward for a considerable distance" (Foster and Witney, 1851:57). The deposit does indeed extend for quite some distance, as Fig. 1 shows. Despite that fact, however, and despite a number of other such re- ports in the vicinity of the ridge that would soon be known as Iron Moun- tain-all of them helping to illustrate that iron ore was defined at the time as a valuable resource-such was the interdependence of the social and the environmental that the specific iron ore in this mountain was not de- fined at the time as having sufficient value to be worth the effort of digging it out. The ores of Iron Mountain, as a result, remained known but largely untouched for nearly 30 years. When seen through the lenses of the taken-for-granted definitions of the situation that would characterize the next phase, the taken-for-granted definitions of the 1840s would seem hard to believe. As the matter was viewed in the proceedings of the Lake Superior Mining Institute in 1894: "It is incredible that the observations of the two geologists should have remained unverified and forgotten for almost a quarter of a century while the search for iron was feverishly carried on to the north" (Cummings, 1984:3). At the time, however, the prevailing views seemed anything but "incredible"; to the contrary, they appear to have been seen as only natural. To ask whether the reasons were social "or" physical, moreover, would be to miss the degree to which they involved the inseparability of the two. The level of demand at the time for iron and steel-a consideration that 376</page><page sequence="17">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide involves the interpenetration of the physical and the social every bit as much as did the earlier hunting-and-gathering technology of the Menomi- nee-was quite low compared to the demand that would exist a quarter of a century later (see Fig. 2). The inseparability of the physical and the social is also involved in the fact that the iron mines of Missouri and of the Mar- quette Range (further to the west along the Wisconsin-Michigan border) were apparently capable of meeting the sociophysical demand that existed in the middle of the 19th century. The inseparability extends even to the geographic location of Iron Mountain. Given the technology that is taken for granted by social actors near the end of the 20th century, the location of the mine seems today to be "only a few miles" from the shores of Lake Michigan. During the middle of the previous century, however, not only did the mountain seem remote from the concentrations of human settle- ment that then existed, but its location meant that the ore had to be trans- ported "many miles" to Lake Michigan before it could be shipped by water, while the ores of the Marquette Range were easier to transport to Lake Superior. Even Foster and Witney (1851), having verified the existence of extensive ore deposits on Iron Mountain, concluded that, given the tech- 120 12 100 n 10 H- I_ C ?

The value of the ore may also have been affected by another aspect of the mutual shaping of the social and the environmental, although this is a point on which the historical record is less clear-cut-the fact that resi- dents of the time were focused so intently on certain resources of the region as to have been diverted away from others. The resources of primary in- terest in this region in the middle of the 19th century were found not be- neath the surface, but on top of it, in the form of trees. Logging in the Great Lakes region began in northeast Wisconsin, close to Iron Mountain; the region's first sawmill was established in 1832 on the same Menominee River that flows past the base of Iron Mountain, feeding the appetite for lumber from growing settlements of the midwest, such as Milwaukee and Chicago (Connor, 1978:31; see also Cronon, 1991). It was during the next few years that the mountain would experience its closest approximation to physical change, at least for the thin but important veneer of vegetation and associated animal life on its surface; even these changes, however, while intense in ecological terms, were almost literally "no more than skin-deep" in terms of the mountain itself. Still, in logging terms, the attack on the trees of the region was little short of voracious; by 1875, the Menominee region was to report the logging of 700-800 million feet of logs per year-the highest output in the world (Connor, 1978:32). This level of activity, however, had very different consequences for the resources on the surface of the mountain-and on other social actors who might otherwise have been expected to have sought profits from log- ging enterprises of their own-than did the resource-use practices of the Menominee who had been the region's primary human inhabitants until just decades earlier. While the vast timber reserves of the region might once have been "socially defined" as inexhaustible, those social definition processes proved insufficient to guarantee actual inexhaustibility. To the contrary: In an example of the interpenetrating influences of social and physical factors, the social definitions helped fuel a level of "harvesting" of the biophysical resources that the processes of "biological construc- tion" simply could not match. As a result of the specific ways in which the social and the physical factors came together in this case, in other words, a belief in "inexhaustibility" may actually have helped create pre- cisely the opposite outcome (cf. Freudenburg, 1985). Within a few years of having become the logging capital of the world, the region was effec- tively "logged out." 378</page><page sequence="19">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide Phase 3: Source of Iron Ore By the time the highest levels of logging were being realized in the middle of the 1870s, the second set of definitions of Iron Mountain had already come close to being supplanted by a third-definitions that placed less emphasis on the biota of the surface than on the value of the iron ores below. Like the earlier transition from the first to the second phase, however, the transition into this third phase of definitions was more gradual than many might expect. The first mine in the general vicinity of Iron Mountain-the Breen- began operation in 1866. A number of other mines also opened up during the late 1860s and all through the 1870s. In contrast to the booming growth then being experienced in logging operations, however, the early mines achieved only indifferent levels of production and profit. As Fig. 2 suggests, roughly a dozen years more were to pass between the opening of the Breen mine and the time when "the" resource of Iron Mountain began to be iron instead of wood. Clearly, the iron content of the mountain itself had not changed be- tween the 1840s and the 1870s. What had changed, instead, involved again the complex interweaving of the physical and the social, specifically includ- ing but not limited to the changes taking place in technology, and in the ways in which people reckoned the value of a given location and of a given set of "natural" resources. There were three ways, in particular, in which those changes altered the taken-for-granted (and apparently "rational") definitions of the value of the iron ores that, after all, had been present all along. The first of those changes took place because of discoveries within Iron Mountain itself. Throughout the third of a century during which the presence of iron ores had been known, and certainly through the first dozen years of would-be mining, many of the settlers had been looking for the rich ores of Iron Mountain, but they had enjoyed little success. A series of mining companies prospected for ore, and a number of them succeeded in finding at least some iron-bearing rock, but none of them managed to make any significant profits. At one operation, remembered today as the Vulcan mine, six companies tried and failed to hit a profitable deposit, de- spite the fact that they managed to find ores that contained first 17% and, eventually, over 30% iron (Iron Mountain Iron Mine, n.d.: 4). Even at these concentrations, the mountain's ores were defined as subeconomic, and hence not worth the effort that would have been required to mine them. According to tour guides at the Iron Mountain Iron Mine, it was a new combination of social and physical factors that finally led to a radical re- definition, and to the real beginning of the mining phase. A new company, 379</page><page sequence="20">Freudenburg et al. using a new piece of physical equipment-a steam-powered core-drilling rig-managed to drill enough core samples to find ore that was sufficiently rich (over 70% iron) and sufficiently profitable that Iron Mountain was soon to be called "The Payroll City of the North" (Nursey, 1891). The reasons for success also involved the interactive significance of the physical and the social in ways that were not entirely local. Two addi- tional, interrelated technological developments were particularly impor- tant-the invention of the Bessemer steel-making process and the westward expansion of the railroads, specifically including the laying of rails to Iron Mountain. Given the earlier discussion of transportation difficulties, the im- portance of the arrival of the Menominee River Railroad in Iron Mountain should be reasonably obvious: Without such a technology for transporting large quantities of the heavy ore to the nearest open-water port at Es- canaba, Michigan, the ore had been defined as having little value. The ar- rival of the railroad, in 1879, coincided almost to the year with the onset of full-scale development of the iron range. The importance of the Bessemer process may be less obvious. In- vented in England in 1856, patented in the United States in 1866, and sub- sequently improved both in efficiency and in safety, the Bessemer process had a good deal to do with the tremendous growth of the U.S. steel industry after the Panic of 1873. By 1876, eleven Bessemer steelworks had been built, and by 1880, the Bessemer steel process had become the primary source of steel production in the United States (Hogan, 1971:35-38). The process involves "forcing air through molten pig iron so that the oxygen in the air combined with the carbon in the pig iron. In this manner, sufficient heat was generated to burn out the impurities in the metal" (Hogan, 1971:31). The result was a material "eight to fifteen times more durable" than iron (Cummings, 1984:3). The substantial improvement in the durability of steel had obvious implications for the railroad industry, particularly given the "period of tre- mendous railroad expansion" that took place during precisely this era (Hogan, 1971:37), with more than a doubling of the nation's total number of miles of track between 1860 and 1880. Equally important for Iron Moun- tain was that, while most of the rails had been made of iron before the advent of the Bessemer process, roughly 99% of the rails being laid by 1880 were made of steel (American Iron and Steel Institute, 1913; for a more extensive case study of the construction of Bessemer "steel," see Misa, 1992). Two aspects of this process-one economic and one technological, to the extent to which it is useful to draw that distinction-helped change the prevailing definitions of the value of the ores of Iron Mountain. Economi- cally, Bessemer steel production is greatly constrained by economies of 380</page><page sequence="21">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide scale: Production needed to be carried out on a large scale to be profitable (Hogan, 1971:37). This required not only a substantial infrastructure of fur- naces and foundries, but also massive quantities of suitable ore. As boosters of Iron Mountain were fond of pointing out, massive quantities were in fact available at that location; as one of the spokespersons of the time put it, "It is probable that after this mine is opened that the great, great grand- children of the great, great grandchildren of this generation will not see this mine worked out" (Ingalls, 1871/1981:5). Another, using language that was effusive even for this time, had this to say of the extractive potential of the Menominee Range: This [is an] inland sea of metallic mountains. .. Of the millions of tons of ore in sight, they are, it is estimated, but an infinitesimal fraction of the vast body of 66 per cent mineral, which underlies its eroded plane. ... To systematically explore the Menominee Range would occupy an army of experts until the cracks of doom. Hitherto it has been but scratched at, an amount of work comparatively equivalent to that of a year's labor by a lame chicken on a skating rink. (Nursey, 1891:11-12). The technological factor is less well known: The chemical reactions that take place during the Bessemer process prohibit use of iron ore that exceeds a specific level of phosphorus content. Iron Mountain ore easily met that standard: "Because the ore was so much below the Bessemer limit in phosphorus, it could be used to 'doctor' other ore which was too high in phosphorus, thus making this ore eagerly sought after by the new and expanding steel works" (Cummings, 1984:8). The net result was that the needs for Bessemer steel production were met by Iron Mountain ore in a way and at a time that simultaneously profited the mining, steel, and rail- road industries, albeit in historically specific and interactive ways: Mining provided ore for steel production, which provided steel for railroads, which transported the ore from the mines as well as providing a growing market for the ores of Iron Mountain. The changes, however, took place not in the iron ore itself, but in the technologies developed by social actors; these changes, in turn, altered the definition of what iron ores, in what locations, could be considered by (historically specific) "rational" standards to have the greatest economic value. Throughout the next several decades-which, given the extent of the Iron Mountain reserves, must have looked as though they would go on more or less forever-Iron Mountain saw a dizzying rate of iron mining. The Vulcan mine, mentioned above, was the first major deposit discovered, and it was the first mine to transport its ore to the port at Escanaba by rail. Another, the Chapin mine, became the largest mine on the Menomi- nee Range, but only after overcoming a set of environmental difficulties that almost certainly would have seemed to observers from earlier eras-or 381</page><page sequence="22">Freudenburg et al. perhaps even to observers from the period of active mining-to have pre- cluded any "rational" hopes of mining the iron ore at a profit. The "D" shaft of the Chapin mine actually had to be sunk through quicksand, an accomplishment made possible by new refrigeration technology that could literally freeze the ground, from surface to ledgerock, with a system of pipes and coils containing calcium chloride and compressed ammonia (Cum- mings, 1984: 16-17). The Chapin soon became the second greatest produc- ing iron mine in the country, but it was also the wettest; a massive pump, powered by the equally massive "Cornish Pumping Engine," had to be in- stalled to keep the mine from flooding. Overall, dozens of mines went to work removing the ores from the virtual mountain of iron ore that lies beneath Iron Mountain. Throughout the entire mining province known as the Menominee Range, and for the period from roughly 1880 to 1945, a total of 72 mining properties managed to remove more than 250 million tons of iron ore, roughly 200 million tons of which would have come from Iron Mountain itself (Cummings, 1991:362). This level of extraction meant that the Menominee mines pro- duced one-seventh of all the total iron ore in the United States in 1890-as much as the nine southern iron-producing states combined. The states of Michigan and Wisconsin, in combination, produced half of the iron ore in the nation (Nursey, 1891:44; see also Crowell and Murray, Inc., 1930). Phase 4: Iron Ore Bust In retrospect, of course, it is clear that the mining phase was not some- how destined to go on forever, or even through the lifetimes of "the great, great grandchildren of the great, great grandchildren" of the early miners (cf. Ingalls, 1871/1981:5). The reasons for the ending of the mining, however, are found not in the factor that many might suspect-the exhaustion of ores-but in the broader changes taking place both in society and in tech- nology. The quantities of iron ore removed, while huge by almost any stand- ard, nevertheless amounted to no more than a tiny fraction of the total mass of the mountain-a fraction of less than 1%. Even in terms of iron ore alone, what was removed amounted to less than half of the high-grade ore, and a far smaller fraction of all of the iron ore, in the massive mountain of iron ore contained within the mountain itself. Present-day geological esti- mates put the amount of remaining, economically recoverable high-grade ore reserves at Iron Mountain at over 400 million tons (Bayley et al., 1966:89-90), while the total estimated reserves for the three mining districts that cut across the Wisconsin-Michigan state line remain at 2.3 billion tons (Sundeen, 1992). The total amount of iron ore present, both in Iron Moun- 382</page><page sequence="23">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide tain and in the three districts as a whole, would be many times greater still. Despite that fact, however, the mining ended, and the mountain came to be seen as a physical feature having little if any resource value. Given that the shutdowns were not caused by resource exhaustion, the ending of the extraction offers additional opportunities for insight into the mutual dependence of the physical and the social. As most observers know, minerals such as iron ore are finite-in contrast to resources such as trees, which if managed properly, can be replaced by new trees on a sustainable basis. To use the common phraseology, trees are a "renewable resource," while iron ore is a "nonrenewable resource." Yet as often hap- pens when humans attempt to define value in the environment that sur- rounds them, matters prove on closer examination not to be quite so simple. The virtual feeding frenzy for forests in the 19th century, noted above in the context of Phase 2, led to the logging of virtually all of the com- mercial-size trees of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota; once the cutting was done, most of the logging companies left. Even today, the era is re- membered as "The Great Cut-Over" (for further discussion, see Karaman- ski, 1989; Cronon, 1991:200-206; B. Catton, 1976:165-180). While the experience did much to encourage increased attention to what is sometimes called sustained-yield forestry-and to provide an example of the ways in which the physical changes created by changing social definitions can lead in turn to other social changes-it also demonstrated, as noted by W Catton (1980), among others, that "renewability" can be far from automatic. By contrast, while it is clearly true that a mineral deposit will not "grow back" during a human scale of years if the ores are removed, the experience of Iron Mountain helps demonstrate that nonrenewability will not necessarily mean that the mining is likely to continue "until all the ore is gone"-or indeed, even until all the high-grade ore has been removed. Instead, as illustrated not only by the experience at Iron Mountain but also at most of the other major mining operations along the Wisconsin-Michi- gan border, the mining stopped well before the ore gave out. The key factor was not the physical exhaustion of the resource, but sociophysical compe- tition from other locations and developments in steel production that put a premium market value on iron-rich ores with low silica content (Bayley et al., 1966:88). Note that this change could not be seen as a triumph of social construction over physical constraint: No matter how loudly the boosters of Iron Mountain might have sung the praises of their ores, it appears they were incapable of socially constructing a different set of physi- cal characteristics for the ore. Iron Mountain mines also suffered from what Freudenburg (1992) calls the "cost-price squeeze." The costs of operation at a given facility can tend to remain stable or even increase over time-as equipment gets older, 383</page><page sequence="24">Freudenburg et al. wages go higher, and the ore needs to be lifted a greater distance to be brought to the surface-unless the mining company makes what often prove to be large-scale investments in newer, more efficient technologies. As may already be clear, however, the newer technologies may well place a greater premium on ores from other locations, rather than on the ores that are currently being mined. This was particularly so at Iron Mountain, where the rich reserves go deep into the earth-an environmental fact that led to a reduced social value for the local ore, particularly during the transition into the phase of the bust, as technological developments encouraged min- ing companies to place increasing emphasis on the feasibility of strip-mining techniques. The changes in technology, in other words, led to changing defi- nitions of the value of ores that continued to have the same physical char- acteristics-yet at the same time, the physical characteristics themselves exerted an unmistakable influence on the socioeconomic "feasibility" of profitable mining. Given that the rich ores of Iron Mountain went well below the surface, attention shifted toward geological formations that were more attractive for strip mining, as were a number of iron deposits in Min- nesota's iron country. The terminology of a mining "shutdown" tends to conjure the im- pression of an experience that is sharp and definite, but in many ways, the end of "the mining phase" is as indistinct as its beginning. In the minds of some, the end can be traced to 1934, the year that saw the end of op- erations for the Chapin mine-once the largest mine of all, having em- ployed 2400 miners at its peak in 1900. Others trace the end to the shutdown of the Vulcan mine, which had been the second largest of the Iron Mountain mines during the heyday of mining. The Vulcan was the last mine to close, ending its operations in 1945-a date that coincides with the end of World War II, but that ironically also coincides with the start of an unprecedented rise in demand for steel from the nearby automobile factories of Detroit. Figure 2 suggests that an earlier time might mark the beginning of the end; after making up roughly 10% of total U.S. iron ore mining for decades, Iron Mountain production reached its highest total in 1902, at just over 3 million tons, and then began to decline, while U.S. mining totals continued to climb. Even choosing the latest of these dates, the mining of the "inex- haustible" ores went on for just under 70 years-only about twice as long as the length of the preceding phase, when iron was seen as valuable and the ores were known to be present, but Iron Mountain nevertheless expe- rienced little iron mining. Using the earliest of these dates, the heyday of mining lasted only about as long as the "inconceivable" period when no significant iron mining was carried out. 384</page><page sequence="25">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide During the fourth or bust phase, the resource value of the mountain continued to be seen largely in terms of the iron ore within it-but once again, as during the inconceivable Phase 2, that value was not seen as being high enough to justify the effort of removing the ore, even though by the later phase, the locations of the higher grade ore were relatively well known. Whatever date is chosen to mark the end of the mining phase, the defining characteristic is that Iron Mountain's iron ore came to be seen as having a lack of value-a lack of value that became just as "obvious" as its evidently high value in earlier years-despite the fact that the mountain, or even the quantity of iron it contained, had scarcely changed at all. Phase 5: Tourist Attraction The tourist phase began in the late 1950s, more than a dozen years after the last of the mines shut down, and more than 50 years after the decline that marked the beginning of the end of production. Given that this fifth or most recent phase extends to the present, it has by now con- tinued for more than a third of a century-roughly half as long as the phase of active mining, even under the broadest plausible definition of the active mining phase, and significantly longer than the period from 1879 to 1902, before the mining began its long-term decline. The beginning of the tourist phase can be traced to the time in roughly 1958 when a different group of social actors began to define the mountain in terms of a different set of resource characteristics, permitting the extraction of a different kind of metal-coins, from the pockets of tourists. Their enterprise, ironically, was aided by the widespread diffusion of automobiles that were built in nearby Detroit, but that often contained iron that had been extracted from mines much farther away. As this paper is being written, a 40-foot tall representation of a miner, "Big John," greets travelers along U.S. Highway 2, announcing the attrac- tions of the "Iron Mountain Mine Tour." During the summer tourist season, the key resource is underground, where tour guides show some of the re- maining tunnels and ore bodies to hundreds of tourists per day. During the winter, the resource value of Iron Mountain once again has largely to do with its elevation above the surrounding terrain, a fact that helps attract skiers from a broad region of the midwest and sometimes beyond. The mine itself is now largely silent except for the voices of tourists and tour guides, but during the summer, fans near the mine entrance draw out the chilly air from the tunnels to cool the souvenir shop, where tourists can buy historical literature and old pieces of mining paraphernalia such as drill bits. As if to underline the point that the iron ore itself is no longer 385</page><page sequence="26">Freudenburg et al. seen as having any intrinsic economic value, small pieces of ore are free for the taking. A brochure published by the Northland Historical Consor- tium advertises 26 museums and historical societies in the area; one of these, the Cornish Pumping Engine and Mining Museum in the town of Iron Mountain, sits over what was once the "D" shaft of the Chapin Mine, where the Dickinson County Historical Association continues to mine the region's past. DISCUSSION: A MOUNTAIN OF DIFFERENCE Four points about the "natural" resources of Iron Mountain deserve to be reiterated. The first is that Iron Mountain itself has actually changed very little over the centuries for which historical documentation can be found. The second is that the social definitions of Iron Mountain, each depending on the technologies but also on the broader sociocultural views and assumptions of the time, could scarcely have changed more dramati- cally. The third is that both the physical characteristics of Iron Mountain and the ongoing changes in society and technology played significant roles in shaping the human uses that proved possible and/or likely. The fourth and broadest point is that, while it is possible to separate the physical from the social in terms of analytical convenience, it is important to recognize that the social is inherent in what is usually seen as the physical, just as the physical is often integral to what is perceived as the social. During each of the five phases outlined in this paper, the relevant social actors appear to have seen themselves as basing their behaviors on physical and economic "facts." From the perspective of this paper, however, those same social actors can more accurately be seen as operating on the basis of social definitions of "the" facts, and of which facts should be seen as most important. The distinction has pragmatic as well as academic im- portance. During each phase, the actors of the time believed they were basing their economic futures on a set of facts that were as solid and physi- cal as the mountain itself. During each phase, while the uses of the moun- tain's resources seemed to be both "obvious" and "natural," these uses proved in retrospect to have depended on a specific confluence of social and physical factors. During the course of little more than a century, all but the most recent definitions have already been replaced, and many suc- cessive sets of convictions about an apparently solid resource-based future have ultimately proved to have been based on something far more fleeting. It would be entirely possible, of course, to discuss the past two cen- turies of human resource use at Iron Mountain strictly in terms of physical resource characteristics, or for that matter, strictly in terms of social defi- 386</page><page sequence="27">Beyond the Nature/Society Divide nitions of the situation. From a physical perspective, for example, the hunt- ing-and-gathering patterns of the Menominee would not have been possible if resources such as game and wild rice had not been present, just as the 72 mines, or for that matter, the current-day skiing operations, would not have been possible without the physical presence of iron deposits, snow and mountainous terrain. From a social perspective, conversely, it would also be possible to emphasize that successful mining could not have taken place without the development of the human capacity to find the under- ground reserves, or for that matter, to note that the resource uses seen as "natural" today, ranging from mining to skiing, are just as thoroughly con- tingent on sociocultural conventions as were the hunting and gathering of the Menominee. It would even be possible to engage in potentially inter- minable debates over which set of factors ought to be seen as more im- portant-the physical or the social-or conversely, to congratulate ourselves on the ability to recognize the importance of both. Any of the above approaches, however, would render pictures that are necessarily incomplete-and arguably, any of them could do as much to cloud the issue as to clarify it. To emphasize either the social or the physical aspects of resource use in isolation, or even to acknowledge that both have importance, is to run the risk of failing to grasp the inherent interplay of the two. It is an important beginning to recognize that most human uses of the mountain could not have taken place without the pres- ence of the mountain's physical characteristics, as well as to recognize that most would have been equally unlikely to have occurred without the pre- vailing social definitions of the time. The larger point, however, is that what might be taken as the separably social and physical aspects of the situation were in fact at each stage conjointly constituted-connected with one an- other as much as are the opposing poles of a magnet. While all of us are likely to continue the use of the term, if only because it provides a simple shorthand, the fact of the matter is that there may actually be no such thing as a "natural" resource-only a complex mix of social, technological, and biophysical conditions through which a given element of the natural environment, at a particular point in time, comes to be socially defined as valuable. Technology, while sometimes treated as a "black box" (cf. Pinch and Bijker, 1984), also inherently involves the mu- tual influence of the social and the physical. The nature of the mix has changed dramatically over time, both at Iron Mountain and elsewhere, and it is reasonable to expect that such changes will continue into the future. What is unlikely to change, however, is the degree to which our ability to understand socially significant outcomes will ultimately depend not on the separation of the physical and the social, but on our capacity to recognize the extent to which each is a fundamental part of the other. 387</page><page sequence="28">Freudenburg et al. In a number of the earliest writings in environmental sociology (e.g., Catton 1972), considerable skepticism was expressed toward notions of the social construction of reality, based in part on the concern that a focus on social construction could encourage the conclusion that "the physical prop- erties of the situation may be ignored" (Choldin, 1978:353). Based on the current analysis, however, our conclusion would be virtually the opposite- not that attention to social construction will cause physical properties to be ignored, and certainly not that physical properties can be ignored, except at our peril. The point, instead, is that without attention to the nature of the interplay of the social and the physical, there is a significant risk that what in fact are social as well as physical properties will be ignored. Such oversights, in turn, can cause us to develop unrealistically constrained analy- ses of socially significant questions and problems. Given the history of analytical separation summarized at the start of this paper, it would be understandable if many social scientists would con- tinue to focus on the presumed separation between the physical and the social. To do so, however, is to risk overlooking the subtle but powerful ways in which specific historical and cultural blinders can shape not just the perceptions of consequences, but also the consequences of perceptions. When the nature of human interaction with the environment is un- derstood more clearly, it is possible to see that the greater need may be to resist the temptation to separate the social and the environmental, and to realize that the interpenetrating influences are often so extensive that the relevant factors can be considered "socioenvironmental" (cf. Freudenburg and Gramling, 1993). More broadly, the need may extend as well to Perrow's point (1984:9) that "seeing is not necessarily believing; sometimes, we must believe before we can see" (see also Jervis, 1976; Wieck, 1976). It may be necessary, in short, to recognize or to believe in the potential for mutual contigeny, or the conjoint constitution of the physical and the social, before it is possible to see the ways in which the two are interrelated. Without progress in achieving such insights, however, we run the risk of having our vision distorted by the very taken-for-grantedness of our socially agreed- upon definitions-the risk of being prisoners of our own perspectives.
