<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, Vol. 4, No. 1, 1990 Race, Sex, and Servitude: Images of Blacks in American Cinema Stanford M. Lyman INTRODUCTION In the early days of the American film industry, African-Americans were in no position to make or influence movies about Africa, black Americans, or any other subject. However, white European and American movie-makers were not constrained by either their own condition, color, culture, or character?or by their meager knowledge of the realities of African or black American life? from seeking to characterize on film the manners and customs of the Africans and their American descendants. Among the earliest docudramas about Africa made in the United States were those purporting to be films of ex-President Theodore Roosevelt's safaris in East Africa in 1909. Roosevelt's imagery of Africa gave to that continent a Comtean variant of the American pastoral mys? tique and at the same time lent support to the colonialist mission to civilize the continent's benighted savages. In the book upon which the films were based, he sought to depict a trip on "a railroad through the Pleistocene." As such a geological time traveller, Roosevelt claimed that he had witnessed the "great world movement . . . which . . . has brought into sudden, violent, and intimate contact phases of the world's life history which would normally be separated by untold centuries of slow development."1 Like the printing press, the movie camera would also make it possible for modern Americans to travel vicariously, as it were, not merely through space but also through time: Africa would become the setting for a popular-culture application of Auguste Comte's "comparative method," providing a cinematic situs for a universal history. Taking scenarios of contemporary African peoples, the movies, like the anthropological texts of the day, assigned dark-skinned people a low place on the linear chronology of geological and cultural time. The trajectory illustrated a presupposed, perhaps pre-ordained, movement from "savagery" through "barbarism" to "civilization."2 49 ? 1990 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">50 Lyman Roosevelt's version of the African pastoral and its people added a Social Darwinist overlay to the Comtean vision: "In fact," he asserted, the black Africans "were living just as palaeolithic man lived in Europe, ages ago."3 As a prehistoric people living in the historical world, the Africans were, thence, locatable on the great chain of being, connecting all humankind to its earliest origins and showing the forms it would take as it moved toward its ultimate destiny: "Most of the tribes," Roosevelt pointed out, "were of pure savages; but here and there were intrusive races of higher type; and in Uganda, beyond the Victoria Nyanza, and on the headwaters of the Nile proper, lived a people which had advanced to the upper stages of barbarism, which might almost be said to have developed a very primitive kind of semi-civilization."4 As the ear? liest films about Africa would try to document, and such later films as Sanders of the River (1935) and Stanley and Livingstone (1939) would seek to celebrate, peoples whose cultural cultivation stretched only from savagery through bar? barism required a long period of European tutelage. As Roosevelt put the mat? ter, "Over this people?for its good fortune?Great Britain established a protectorate . . .."5 In most films about Africa, its peoples are depicted as inhabitants of fetid, vine-and-snake infested jungles. The early documentaries based on Roosevelt's and other big game hunter's adventures?Tuaregs in Their Country (1909); Theodore Roosevelt in Africa (n.d.); Theodore Roosevelt's Camp in Africa (n.d.); Paul J. Rainey's African Hunt (1912); Capturing Circus Animals in the African Wilds (1913); African Natives (n.d.)?pictured jungle settings as the African norm.6 Within a very short time, their popularity spawned a host of exotic feature films?Missionaries in Darkest Africa (1912); The Terrors of the Jungle (1913); Voodoo Vengeance (1913); The Loyalty of Jumbo (1914); Forbidden Adventure (1915); and A Night in the Jungle (1915)?exploiting such soon to be stand? ardized themes as "darkest" Africa, jungle "juju," African "primitivism," the tragedy of miscegenation, and heroic if unavailing missionary endeavor. Soon, a leitmotiv established by African movies settled on four basic themes: 1) the inherent superiority of Euro-American civilization, the white race, and colonial rule; 2) the sorrow and tragedy of interracial sex and/or marriage; 3) the loyalty and devotion of the African servant; and 4) the altruistic service of white mis? sionaries, doctors, engineers, and wildlife conservationists, who serve as models of civilization and tutors of modernity to grateful African natives. EUROCENTRISM IN BRITISH AND AMERICAN CINEMA Despite the fact that the U.S.A., as the "first new nation," might have served as cinema's eighteenth-century model for the decolonization movement that would sweep away Europe's overseas empires in the twentieth century,7</page><page sequence="3">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 51 American movies from the beginning lent filmic support to European hegemony over African and other dark-skinned peoples. Theodore Roosevelt's African commentaries had set the terms for this theme so strongly? The English rule in Africa has been of incalculable benefit to Africans themselves, and indeed this is true of the rule of most European nations. Mistakes have been made, of course, but they have proceeded at least as often from an unwise effort to accomplish too much in the way of beneficence, as from a desire to exploit the natives.8 ?that the demand for national self-determination which characterized Woodrow Wilson's postwar foreign policy (but was not meant to apply to the colonial empires of the victorious powers) could not undermine them. Although by 1915 the predominant theme of American cinema's African motifs had become "the dull impotence of their blacks,"9 for the next fifty years pseudo-historical action features would continue to emphasize barbaric atrocities committed by black natives against well-meaning white colonists, honest settlers, and benevolent missionaries. Reprising the "fierce" imagery that had been es? tablished in earlier "Zulu" movies, a British film, Rhodes of Africa (1935), "depicted the savagery of the Zulu war using Africans, including an African in the role of a chief."10 Zulus would continue to be prominent in British and American films. One outstanding example is Zulu (1964), re-telling the story of the battle of Rorke's Drift, in which a small company of British soldiers suc? cessfully held off an attack by 4,200 Zulu warriors for twenty-four hours.11 A change in the imagery of African Americans permitted a number of "blaxploitation" films to treat Africa in a slightly different way on American movie screens. Shaft in Africa (1973) had its eponymous black American hero (Richard Roundtree) go to the former "Dark Continent" to prevent an un? scrupulous French entrepreneur from flooding Europe with cheap native labor that would subvert its industrial economy.12 Treating Africans to the same char? ges that had been levelled against Asians in nineteenth-century America, this movie failed to treat the issues affecting Gastarbeiten being imported into France and Germany from Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Morocco; moreover, it depicted nothing of the poignant perspective on marriage and race relations that in the same year Rainer Werner Fassbinder had presented in his brilliant study of Moroccan workers in Germany, Fear Eats the Soul: Ali (1973). For American and British film-makers, the colonial era remained one for reprising tragic white missionarianism, docile black subservience, and ungrateful native resistance to Occidental benevolence. Sex and the Prohibition of Interracial Marriage "Stereotyping," writes social anthropologist I. C. Jarvie, ". . . can be in? terpreted as basically a defense against imagined and real threats."13 In the case</page><page sequence="4">52 Lyman of the movie stereotyping of African and other dark-skinned persons as atavistic ape men, tragic mulattos, or preternatural seducers of white men, Hollywood vicariously and symbolically reinforced white America's statutory and social barricades against mixing the races. As Gunnar Myrdal was to point out in 1944, the chief fear of the ordinary white American male was that the blacks sought "amalgamation" and that Negro men had designs on "his" woman.14 One element of this apprehension had to do with white male fantasies about the alleged sexual superiority of Africans and blacks and the supposed physical attractiveness of black men to white women.15 Although the racialist theme that pervaded American "exotic" movies often depicted black people as "natives" in Latin America, the South Seas, South Asia, and Arabia, it also required them to be beyond the pale of marriage with white persons. The "forbidden fruit" of black Africa and its cinematic surrogates?i.e., people of color?was always presented as a basis for either marital or intergenerational tragedy. Although the "tragic mulatto" theme had preceded the writing of film scenarios, having first been presented in Clotel, or the President's Daughter (1853) by the black American novelist William Wells Brown,16 the thesis proclaiming a mixed-blood's irrevocably threatening claim on a monoracial social order would be adapted and reworked for many Hollywood films. Depicting star-crossed mulatto lovers, The Octoroon (1913), set a filmic standard that would not be broken until Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (released in 1967, the same year that the Supreme Court declared the last of the state laws prohibiting racial intermarriage unconstitutional17) put that issue on cinematic hold. The African and colonial films of the silent era offered opportunities to work numerous plots around the basic miscegenation theme. In Gauntier's Mis? sionaries in Darkest Africa (1912), the remorseful daughter of the white Chris? tians who seek to bring civilization to the dark continent commits suicide rather than face up to her erotic interest in the native who kidnapped her.18 While a black woman might not marry a white man, she might express her love for him by saving his life. In The Voice of Conscience (n.d.) the heroine uses voodoo to force another black to confess to the crime for which the white hero has been arrested.19 The Leopard Woman (1920) permitted the eponymous na? tive heroine to sublimate her love for a white hunter by ordering the execution of an innocent Negro (Noble Johnson, essaying a role he would replay in numerous jungle and exotic films for three decades) in his place.20 Often parodied in later years, Leopard Woman and The Voice of Conscience had set the terms for contrasting white love with black lust. When in 1927 Hollywood's Hays Office banned the cinematic presenta? tion of romances between actors of different races and prohibited altogether any positive image of intermarriage?(thirty-nine states of the United States had at one time or another enacted miscegenation statutes21)?the scene was</page><page sequence="5">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 53 set not only for the eviction of the black feature player from his or her paltry opportunities to play frustrated love objects in stereotyped dramas, but also for numerous variations on racial identity mix-ups as screenplay solutions to for? bidden romance. Thus, to take one film as an exemplar of many that were to follow, Volcano (1926) hints at the idea that an apparently white woman (Bebe Daniels), resident of Martinique, has some "black" blood. The menacing villain of the piece (Wallace Beery) is identified as a "quadroon." In the denouement, the heroine is cleared of the charge of "tainted blood" and is thereby free to marry her white sweetheart (Ricardo Cortez).22 The deep-seated fears about a sexual encounter between an African man and a Caucasian woman were graphically illustrated in Tarzan of the Apes (1918), when Jane Porter (Enid Markey) had to be saved from a menacing African, a "black ape," who kidnaps and attempts to rape her.23 The dynamics of race and gender that would become de rigueur in films about Africans and African Americans are here fully anticipated.24 The lusty African man is in fact the screenplay's replacement of Tarzan-creator Edgar Rice Burrough's "Terkoz," a real ape and Tarzan's short-lived successor as leader of the anthropoids. In the novel, Terkoz, having already been ostracized by his sub? ject-apes, is described as a "horrible man-like beast" who seeks to take Jane, a "hairless white ape," as his mate.25 In the film, however,?exemplifying a thesis that had been debated in religious, literary, and journalistic circles two decades earlier under the heading, "The Negro, a beast?"26?Jane is threatened by "a huge, black, bald-headed, paint-faced, diabolically grinning, African buck,"27 who is pictorially perceived as much more the "ape-man" than her white-skinned muscular saviour-cum-lover, Tarzan (Elmo Lincoln). Jane's horrified reaction to the advances of the lusty black brute/ape? ("One piercing scream escaped her lips .... But Jane did not once lose con? sciousness . . .; her brain was clear, and she comprehended all that transpired."28)?is meant to teach another lesson. Her clear-headed courage was to be contrasted with that of her black, heavy-set, handkerchief-headed main in-uniform, Esmeralda,?("Esmeralda's scream of terror had mingled once with that of Jane, and then, as was Esmeralda 's manner under stress of emergency which required presence of mind, she swooned"29). In the film, Esmeralda per? sonifies the comic-mammy-coon character, or, more accurately, caricature, that had originated in the earlier "Jim Crow" minstrelsy.30 Esmeralda's loyal black maidservant essays the part of a droll, stupid, and superstitious fool, a role that in a later era's movies (e.g., Gone With the Wind [1939]) would be elaborated on by Butterfly McQueen. Although the African American wives lampooned in Coon Town Suffraget? tes (1914)?a blackface travesty on Aristophane's Lysistrata?were permitted to possess some social intelligence, and the formula-enacted domestics played by Louise Beavers, Hattie McDaniel, and Isabell Sanford in numerous movies made</page><page sequence="6">54 Lyman from the 1930s through the 1970s were usually compensated for their fawning buffoonery by having a dose of practical wisdom available for their white employers, their characters lent additional support to a complex ideology of white sexual racism. The "wise" black mammy's opposition to miscegenation plum? meted to its nadir in Stanley Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? (1967), a movie widely touted for its liberal outlook and anti-miscegenationist theme. As Tillie, the housekeeper to Matt and Christina Dayton (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn),?a prosperous white middle class couple whose daughter Joey (Katharine Houghton) has fallen in love with John Prentice (Sydney Poitier), a black American medical doctor who works for the World Health Organiza? tion?Isabell Sanford is made not only to oppose her employer's daughter's mar? riage to what she calls an "uppity nigger," but also to be such a threat to Dr. Prentice's seemingly liberated libido that he grabs a shirt to cover his bare chest when she bursts in upon him while he is changing clothes. The early Tarzan films had established an important theme of the African cinematic motif: "good" white women are and ought to be reserved for white he-men. With only an occasional exception, black and other non-white women were divided into three types?overweight or elderly maidservants and con? fidantes to white families; exotic and sensual temptresses who lure unsuspecting white men to depravity and death; and fair-skinned tragic mulattoes who suf? fered for their parent's transgression of the color line. When compared to white women, black women were always made to appear of less value to either black or white men. In King Kong (1932), for example, the dark-skinned savages on an island somewhere southwest of Sumatra are about to sacrifice a light-skinned female member of their own tribe, preparing the virginal beauty to be the "bride of Kong,"?a giant ape that was Merian Cooper's and Ernest Schoedsack's enormously enlarged variant of Burrough's "Terkoz." When white film-makers and sailors arrive unexpectedly at the ceremony, accompanied by Ann, a lovely blonde ingenue (Fay Wray), the tribal chief (Noble Johnson) offers to trade six of his own dark-skinned women for the blonde beauty. Ann's boss (Robert Armstrong) and her lover (Bruce Cabot) refuse to barter a white woman for any number of blacks, so the chief kidnaps her and ties her to stakes for the delectation of the oversized amorous anthropoid. Movie apes are made to prefer white to black women. Kong takes to the white girl like no other (?in one scene he is shown gently stripping off her clothes and licking his paws?), and her adventures with and eventual rescue from this smitten simian are constantly described as a love affair between "beauty and the beast." As an over-sized man-ape, Kong is moviedom's most graphic characterization of the Occident's apprehensions about the Negro. It is clear that Kong, like Terkoz before him, cannot leave off of his "white ape," and that he would kill other humans, white or black (Rex Ingram has a bit part as one of the sailors attempting to rescue Ann), should they seek to keep</page><page sequence="7">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 55 him from his anthropomorphic affair. (To be fair, it should be noted that Kong rejects and tosses to her death a young white brunette whom he snatches from her apartment high above New York City's streets. Kong seems firmly attracted to blondes). The film makes it abundantly clear that Kong merely lusts after the black girls who are supplied to him periodically by the frightened natives, but he loves the white blonde. The tragedy and impossibility of cross-racial love in the tropics achieved its apotheosis in White Cargo, a screenplay by Leon Gordon based on the wide? ly acclaimed Broadway play of the same name and a novel by Vera Simonton, appropriately entitled Hell's Playground. Hollywood's Hays Office had virtual? ly proscribed the casting of black actors as screen lovers, especially if mis? cegenation was to become a theme.31 White Cargo's setting in the Malayan tropics seemed to offer a way around the prohibition, while reinforcing its basic message. W. E. B. DuBois had seen the stage production and commented: In New York we have two plays: "White Cargo" and "Congo." In "White Cargo" there is a fallen woman. She is black. In "Congo" the fallen woman is white. In "White Cargo" the black woman goes down further and further and in "Congo" the white woman begins with degradation but in the end is one of the angels of the Lord. You know the current magazine story: A young white man goes down to Central America and the most beautiful colored woman there falls in love with him. She crawls across the whole isthmus to get to him. The white man says nobly, "No." He goes back to his white sweetheart in New York.32 By resetting the miscegenation theme outside of Africa and introducing the woman (almost always played by a white actress in brownface) as a racial hybrid, Hollywood found a way to maintain its opposition to intermarriage, cast white actors as black, Oriental, Polynesian, or otherwise dark-skinned char? acters, and oblige the demands of the censors, who opposed even the presen? tation of African Americans in intimate scenes with whites. Nevertheless, White Cargo at first proved to be too much of a challenge for Hollywood's cautious movie-makers. Its female character, Tondelayo, is described as a "half negro" (sic) whose death in the final scene is deserved because she has committed the miscegenationist's cardinal sin?seducing white men to "go black"?to suc? cumb to native life.33 The Hays Office forbade ever making the film. A British production of White Cargo starring Gypsy Rhouma was im? ported into the United States in 1930, but it aroused neither admiration nor attack. When, after much wrangling, an American-made version achieved con? siderable notoriety in 1942, the role of "Tondelayo" was played by Hedy Lamarr, a former leading lady of the Austrian silver screen who had caused a sensation in Europe and America nine years earlier when she appeared nude in the Czech film Extase. Among the men whom she leads to destruction by her exotic, erotic ways in White Cargo is the white planter (Walter Pidgeon) who personifies the sexual and civilizational dangers that are said to accompany the white man's burden.</page><page sequence="8">56 Lyman The attractiveness of interracial sex in foreign climes?such white silent stars as Mary Pickford, Lenore Ulrich, Pauline Frederick, and Lina Cavalieri had played exotic primitives at least once M?would not die. But in films of the first five decades of the twentieth century neither real blacks nor blackfaced white men could be allowed to seduce or even appear erotically attractive to white women. For this reason, it becomes possible to contrast the themes of the 1917 production of The Slaver?in which "a tribal chieftain on the coast of Africa . . . makes a deal with a white sea captain to buy a white girl," but his nefarious scheme is foiled by the lovesick black cabin boy, who "saves her, sacrificing himself in the process"35?with the Franco-Camerouns produc? tion of Chocolat (released in the United States in 1989)?in which the hand? some, muscular black house servant (Isaach de Bankole) secretly anguishes over the fact that his love for his employer's wife must never be seen or acknow? ledged but firmly rebuffs the frustrated French woman's sexual advances. Chocolat presents the interracial sex theme as a by-product of race-conscious colonial domination and allows its African hero not only to be a sensitive, warm, and intelligent man, better educated than his employers, but also to be physically attractive and to have his fine physique and powerful musculature presented in full-frontal nudity. A finely-honed heroic physique like that of Isaach de Bankole has not been displayed in leading roles in American films requiring the presence of African American strong men or "heavies" in interracial settings. When bare chested well-muscled black actors were allowed to appear in movies they were usually cast as background figures, obedient servants or frightened natives, as in White Zombie (1932), a thriller set in Haiti in which Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi) "commands his flock of mindless but physically superb black zombies who obey his every order with frantic haste."36 In general, until the brief rever? sal of the theme that occurred in the short-lived flurry of "Blaxploitation" movies in the 1970s, Hollywood has treated the black male physique "as a reminder of what the body can do, its vitality, its strength, its sensuousness; and yet, simultaneously [it has promoted a] denial of all that bodily energy and delight as creative and productive." Black male sexuality has been made to appear "rather hysterically in images of bad (mixed) blood and rape or else as mere animal capacity incapable of producing civilization."37 When in the 1980s, movies began presenting black males as heroes and protectors of civilization (or, at least, of a beleaguered American urban civil society), they often de-sexed or de-glamorized them. Hence, Danny Glover has complained about the elimination of any sexual interest in the characterization given to his role as "Detective Roger Murtaugh," the sensible, intelligent, black cop-sidekick to a near-psychotic colleague "Martin Riggs" (Mel Gibson) in the two-film series Lethal Weapon I (1987) and II (1989). As Glover sees the issue, a more sensual quality that might be attached to Murtaugh has been "subcon</page><page sequence="9">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 57 sciously" deleted from these pictures, wasting the voluptuous talents of the actress playing Mrs. Murtaugh (Darlene Love) and neutralizing the sexuality that should be part and parcel of Murtaugh's on-screen character: "'You get a sense, in watching these movies, that these two people do everything but sleep together,' Glover said, 'You know, he could at least be seen kissing her. Or holding her.' . . ." And he concludes that his complaint is not an isolated one: "'It's an interesting dilemma. It happens to [a lot of black actors] in films.'"38 Race, Sex, and the Opportunities for Non-white Actors: The Case of Dorothy Dandridge The syndrome of fears encapsulated in African, colonial, and exotic film stereotypy is not exhausted by the sexual-racist fantasies about black male threats to white sexual supremacy. There is also?as the recriminations over White Cargo illustrate so well?the ambivalent lust-fear attached to the exotic black (and also to the equally exotic Oriental, Polynesian, and Amerindian) female. To understand this social and cinematic pathology, it is necessary to reprise its relationship to apprehensions about Occidental civilization's vul? nerabilities. The ways of life in Africa, Pre-Columbian America, and the tropics have long been envisioned as diametrically opposed to those of civilized Europeans.39 The former's geo-temporal, physical, and cultural "otherhood" is said to be the source of a latent, perhaps sub-conscious, attraction (especially for white men) that, if allowed to emerge from its properly repressed place in the recesses of both the individual and the collective psyche, will lead to atavism and, eventually, to the destruction of Occidental civilization itself. Of all the icons of this psychic and socio-cultural mirage, none is so powerful as that of the savage (read black, Asian, Oceanic, or Amerindian) woman. Such an apprehension, so deeply buried in the core culture, is the stuff of both psychopathology and drama. In movies about jungle princesses (The Jungle Woman, 1926), island native girls (Drums of the Jungle, 1935), Caribbean beauties (Island in the Sun, 1957), and "half-breed" daughters of "squaw men" (One-Eighth Apache, 1920) are to be found not only the warnings against break? ing the taboo on interracial sex, but also the admonition that white men take care not to contribute to the subversion of a civilization that has taken so many centuries and so much sexual abstemiousness to forge. Hollywood's restrictions on the cinematic opportunities open to its fair skinned but non-white actors imitated its artful retelling of the tragic mulatto theme. Light-skinned male actors, such as Noble Johnson,40 who were classified as Negroes, were permitted to play blacks, Chinese, Spaniards, Cubans, Tibetans, Polynesians, Mexicans, Lascars, Eskimos, and Indians, but never white Anglos. Fair-skinned females classified as Negroes might play a "ein</page><page sequence="10">58 Lyman namon-colored gal" (e.g., Nina Mae McKinney as "an exotic sex object, half woman, half child . . . the black woman out of control of her emotions, split in two by her loyalties and her own vulnerabilities"41 in King Vidor's Hal? lelujah), but, despite their talents, could never be advanced to stardom playing romantic leads opposite white men. The tragic career of Dorothy Dandridge epitomizes the plight of the mulatto beauty in Hollywood. Regarded as the most promising successor to the ill-fated Nina Mae McKiney,?(who in the 1920s had been billed as "a jungle Lorelai,"42 and "the black Garbo,"43 but who soon faded into Oscar Micheaux's black film studio and a few black musical shorts, emerging "more a road-com? pany 'Bess' than an African queen"44 opposite Paul Robeson in Sanders of the River, and making her last important film appearance "as a razor-totin', high strung, high-yeller girl"45 in Elia Kazan's 1949 melodrama of passing, Pinky)? Dandridge played out the fantasy of the tragic mulatto in real, as well as reel life. Born into a show business family in 1923, Dandridge had written and performed parodies of Josephine Baker46 and toured with her sister as part of the Jimmy Lunceford band while still a teenager. She had had some small film roles?A Day at the Races (1937), Lady From Louisiana (1941), Bahama Pas? sage (1942), Drums of the Congo (1942)47?but then scored a noteworthy tri? umph as a kidnapped African princess in Tarzan's Peril (1951). According to cineast Donald Bogle: "In a crucial episode [of this film], Dandridge . . . was tied to the stakes by a warlike tribal leader. As she lay with legs sprawled apart, heaving and turning to break loose, it was apparent that never before had the black woman been so erotically and obviously used as a sex object. From the way Lex Barker's Tarzan eyed the sumptuous Dandridge, it was ob? vious too, that for once Tarzan's mind was not on Jane or boy or Cheetah!"48 However, it was precisely her appearance as a lovely, talented, sensually pleasing, fair-skinned performer that first enhanced and then doomed Dandridge's career. So long as she appeared as only a mild diversion (her scene in an apron and maid's cap with the bare-chested white actor Sterling Hay den in Bahama Passage hints visually at eroticism49); as a leading lady in all-black films (in Four Shall Die she portrays an heiress pursued by two black suitors50); in popular musicals (singing "Chattanooga Choo Choo" in Sun Valley Serenade [1941]; performing with Count Basie in Hit Parade of 194351); as a chaste and kindly-disposed school-teacher (in Bright Road [1953] Dandridge aids an in? secure black child [Philip Hepburn]52); or as a patient housewife keeping her morally weaker husband from going bad (The Harlem Globetrotters [1951]53), she did not break out of Hollywood's sex-racist casting mold. But, without departing from the genre, Dandridge challenged the caste-ridden place of the fair-skinned female actress when she essayed the title role in Otto Preminger's Carmen Jones (1954).</page><page sequence="11">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 59 In this World War II revision of Bizet's opera, Dandridge portrays a sultry, fair-skinned factory-worker who, true to her divided nature and nurture, seduces a young soldier, "Joe" (Harry Belafonte), entices him into deserting the army, and then deserts him for a black prize fighter, "Husky Miller" (Joe Adams), bringing down on her head the punishment her promiscuous and un? patriotic wickedness so richly deserves.54 After her notoriously sensuous per? formance in Carmen Jones (once again she is tied and spread-eagled and made to appear as an urban black American variant of the captive African jungle princess), Dandridge discovered that she could not be cast in any role but that of an exotic self-destructive mulatto.55 And, thus, Dandridge became the ob? vious choice for the lead in one more Hollywood variation on the tragic mulatto theme, Island In the Sun (1957). As "Margot," a Bahamian woman in love with the apparently white scion (John Justin) of an old colonial family, Dandridge does win her lover in the ambiguous finale; however, "David Boyeur," the light-skinned island radical (Harry Belafonte), must give up his love for the "pure" white "Marvis" (Joan Fontaine) in this hackneyed tale of a colonial family that has kept its black ancestry secret.56 Because Dandridge, a "black" actress, was permitted to hold hands and dance with Justin, a white actor, ("We had to fight to say the word 'love'," Dandridge later reported.57), some theatre owners threatened to refuse to show the picture, and the South Carolina legislature considered but did not pass a law fining theatre owners $5,000 for showing it. For Dandridge, however, the film was the beginning of the end. She appeared as "Bess" opposite Sidney Poitier's "Porgy" in Hollywood's version of the Dubose and Dorothy Heyward folk-opera, poised disconsolately between the "good" colored cripple (Poitier) and the evil, muscular, dark-skinned "Crown" (Brock Peters),58 and made no more pictures in America. Dandridge's subsequent slide into oblivion and death is a real-life story that more than matches her roles as the seductive mulatto who has no secure place in a racist society. Despite her nomination for an Academy Award for Carmen Jones, she could find little work as a leading lady in American films. Her marriage to an older white man ended in divorce and bankruptcy. Rumors that she had had love affairs with Tyrone Power, Peter Lawford, Michael Ren nie, Abby Mann, Otto Preminger, and Arthur Loew, Jr., were coupled with a report that she had become traumatized on a movie set when a dark-skinned actor was about to touch her, and these stories made her virtually unemployable in the United States.59 Her last three films were made abroad, each essaying a variant of the tragic mulatto theme. In The Decks Ran Red (1958), she played a flirtatious fair-skinned beauty who attracts the erotic attention but not the undying love of the white men (James Mason, Stuart Whitman, Broderick Crawford, and Curt J?rgens)60 aboard an ill-fated freighter. In Tamango (1959), Prosper Merimee's tale of the Africa-to-Cuba slave trade, Dandridge portrayed</page><page sequence="12">60 Lyman "Aiche," a black beauty held prisoner on a slave ship and torn between her attraction to its captain (Curt J?rgens) and her loyalty to her own people who are chained in the hold.61 Her final picture, Malaga (1962), released the same year she died a victim of anti-depressant drugs and a deep melancholy, pictures her as "Gianni," involved with two double-crossing jewel thieves (Trevor Howard and Edmund Purdom).62 Fittingly, in light of the cinema's attitude toward mulattoes, the creators of Malaga's heroine could not decide on their character's race or nationality63 and thus could not find her a happy place on this earth. Dandridge was the last important African American actress to be assigned to the role of the tragic mulatto?"the image of the mulatto woman whose white blood makes her beautiful and whose black blood degrades her and who is doomed to die tragically . . ..//64 In light of how often scholars and publicists have spoken out on how the race problem might be solved by a thoroughgoing racial amalgamation,65 Hollywood's treatment of mixed marriages and interracial love is instructive. The Supreme Court's declaration of the unconstitutionality of the last of the state anti-miscegenationist statutes in 196766 did not bring about a rush to in? termarry off or on screen. Hollywood did not vary its outlook on the matter very much. The interracial relationship between white sex-goddess Racquel Welch and black athlete-turned-actor Jim Brown is justified by making her an Indian in 100 Rifles (1968), but even this modest gesture is undercut?she is killed in the film's finale. Black actor Calvin Lockhart's screen love affair with the young white woman played by white actress Genevi?ve Waite leaves her pregnant and him in prison in Joanna (1968). Sidney Poitier's silver screened romances with white women are a study in the limitations of the liberal outlook. His affair with Joanne Shimkus ends with both their deaths in The Lost Man (1969); a sightless white girl (Elizabeth Hartman) loves him in A Patch of Blue (1965), but it comes to nothing when the chaste and kindly black benefactor sends her away to a school for the blind.67 Poitier's successful winning of a white wife in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) is undercut not only by the screenplay's emphasis on his membership in the upper professional echelons of the black bourgeoisie but also by the fact that the couple leaves the country immediately after their wedding. Guess . . . left its audience guessing as to how its interracial marriage would work out. Moreover, three years earlier, One Potato, Two Potato (1964) suggested that the custody of the white child of a woman (Barbara Barrie) whose second marriage is to a good, solid, hard-work? ing and dependable black man (Bernie Hamilton) would still likely be awarded to the white father, a mixed-marriage household being regarded as no place to bring up a Caucasian girl. The many problems attending interracial unions and their offspring await resolution in fact as well as in fiction, a point given poignant notice recently by historian Joel Williamson's plaintive plea that the 21st Century make an</page><page sequence="13">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 61 irrevocable break with America's one person-one race tradition. Imagining a couple, each the progeny of a mixed marriage, coming to adulthood in the year 2000 A.D., Williamson writes: "He and she might well be, in fact, the first fully evolved, smoothly functioning model of a people who have transcended both an exclusive whiteness and an exclusive blackness and moved into a world in which they accept and value themselves for themselves alone?as new and unique, as indeed a new people in the human universe."68 Hollywood has yet to meet the challenge presented by Williamson's sociological imagination. The Loyal Black Servant of Colonialism: The Case of Paul Robeson If black people in films were not permitted to love or marry their white "superiors," they were allowed to serve them loyally, faithfully, and abjectly. The common denominator of all such roles was their popular-culture reinfor? cement of Europe's imperialistic and racial hierarchy. That hierarchy had first positioned whites over blacks wherever they came in contact and then demanded the latter's acquiescence to their supposedly deserved and unmis? takably degraded place. There have been many jungle-, island-, and desert-set movies presenting the African as a loyal servant, but perhaps none so served the colonialist-cum racist cause than those exploiting the talents of Paul Robeson (1898-1976).69 During the course of his multi-faceted and much-troubled life, Robeson, an enor? mous talent, enacted the parts of important characters in eleven films made in the United States and Europe. Six of these?The Emperor Jones (1933), Sanders of the River (1935), Song of Freedom (1937), King Solomons's Mines (1937), Jericho (1937), and Big Fella (1938)?explored aspects of imperialist rule in Africa or the Caribbean and reinforced the ideology of Occidental Supremacy. Although Robeson starred in each of them and hoped each would contribute to a greater respect for black peoples everywhere in the world, none (with the pos? sible exception of The Emperor Jones) succeeded in doing much more than showcasing his talent at the expense of his race's dignity and emancipation. The screen version of Eugene O'Neill's drama, The Emperor Jones, is often regarded as a breakthrough in Hollywood's depiction of the Negro male, giving him classical tragic stature. Robeson reprised his stage performance as "Brutus Jones," a Pullman porter who through a series of remarkable adventures rises from his lowly position to that of Carib King only to suffer the outrage of betrayal, revolt, and eventual death at the hands of his angry and disaffected subjects. In effect this "Brutus" becomes a "Caesar" and then acts as his own "Brutus," having exploited the credulity of his people for his own gain. O'Neill had intended his original theater production to serve as a comment on Anglo</page><page sequence="14">62 Lyman American exploitation of the West Indies and an allegory of the rise of Jean Christophe. But it was not perceived that way by American audiences. As early as 1925 O'Neill had thought of writing what today would be called a "prequel" to the Emperor Jones?telling how the crap-shooting, low down, ghetto Negro had lived before he escaped to the Caribbean island. Such an addition, written by DuBose Hey ward, was inserted into the 1933 film ver? sion. This insert undercut the original drama's theme and aroused considerable criticism from the black community. The Emperor Jones also seemed to ques? tion whether the oppressed blacks' quest for self-determination could ever es? tablish a free, modern, and truly civil society. As Robert Stebbins observed in July, 1935: "The Emperor Jones* maintained unbroken the chain of white chauvinism forged in the carbon-arc lights of the Hollywood studios. Paul Robeson is presented as a vainglorious braggart, a murderer, a tin-foil Napoleon who imposes upon and exploits heartlessly members of his own race. And when finally they rise against him his false front falls away. He is revealed for what he is, and by extension what all Negroes are supposed to be, creatures who stand trembling in a murky land of shadow, peopled with the ghosts that rise up out of the swamps and jungles of the primitive mind.7 Robeson's "Brutus," having seized control of the island by convincing the easily hoodwinked "bush niggers" that he cannot be killed by ordinary bul? lets, seemed to adopt just the kind of ignoble style that European imperialists imputed to their subjects. Dilating on the trappings but not the responsibilities of his newly acquired power, the new-crowned monarch muses "King Brutus!" But then he reconsiders: "Somehow that don't make enough noise." He pauses and then lights up, "The Emperor Jones!" And, by the end of the film, this boastful emperor is reduced to crawling on his belly, howling in fear of the ghosts in the swamp, and dying an all-too-craven Negro?in the words of one critic, "A miserable victim to moral breakdown and superstitious fears."71 In seeking to depict what happens when a member of the servant under? class becomes a king, the makers of the Emperor Jones did not shrink from exploiting and then being reprimanded for their exploitation of the animadver? sions about sex between blacks and whites. The issue of black sensuality and miscegenation affected the making and the advertising of Emperor Jones. Fredi Washington had been cast as "Undine," a love interest of Brutus. The repre? sentatives of the Hay's office demanded to preview the first day's rushes, and when they saw the passionate scenes involving Robeson with Washington, the censors demanded that something be done about the skin tone of the fair skinned African American actress, lest audiences assume she was white. Want? ing to avoid cutting these scenes, "The producers reluctantly applied dark makeup to Miss Washington for the daily shoots."72 Nevertheless, the general? ized fear about picturing sensual blacks still prevailed. Although movie mar? quees gave top billing to Robeson, one critic would later complain, "Think</page><page sequence="15">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 63 back on the advertising campaign that sold Emperor Jones and Sanders of the River. No photograph of Paul Robeson was ever used in the advertising of either of these pictures."73 Such was the apprehension about African American sensuality that not even O'Neill's Emperor Jones could break its hold on the collective American psyche. In the early 1930s Robeson became concerned with the plight of Africans groaning under the yoke of European colonial domination. "A mighty task con? fronts us," he told a Nigerian reporter in 1934. Someone, perhaps he himself, would have "to go to Africa and reveal to the blacks their own historical mis? sion."74 That same year he accepted the Korda Brothers' invitation to portray "Bosambo," an African chief in their film version of Edgar Wallace's novel, Sanders of the River. Although the script seemed to promise that this movie would present the peoples of Africa and their cultures, music, and social life in a new and positive light, in fact, the finished film celebrated the Tightness, even the necessity, of British rule in Africa. Nancy Cunard dismissed Sanders of the River as "pure Nordic bunk."75 Robeson, who had once been referred to as an "Ebony Apollo," appeared bare-chested and in a leopard-skin loincloth, only to be chided, so Flora Robson recalls, by a real prince of the Ashanti, who happened to be attending Oxford at the time, and who told him that African royalty in fact wore tweeds.76 Although the movie scenario depicted Bosambo as happily married to Lilongo (Nina Mae McKinney) and raising a young son according to tribal custom, the ballyhoo put out to lure the audience into the theater screamed, "A million mad savages fighting for one beautiful woman! . . . until three white comrades alone pitched into the fray and quelled the bloody revolt!"77 Sanders of the River argued that white rule was the only basis for law and order among such uncivilized people as the black Africans. Bosambo is ever the loyal lackey of "Lord Sandy" (Leslie Banks), whom he calls "My Lord Sandy . . . the hater of lies . . . the righter of wrongs."78 Robeson's Bosambo is an object lesson in how to be a true colonial subject. When Sanders tells him that the difference between the British monarch and the African chiefs is that the former is loved by his subjects, Bosambo sings one of Mischa Spoliansky's "authentically-based" African hymns to his white master's wis? dom.79 In the absence of Sanders, the natives?whose leaders were played by African students in London at the time, including Jomo Kenyatta, later first president of independent Kenya; H. O. Davies, later a jurisprudent in Nigeria (where Sanders was banned for its offensive portrayal of Africans); and, as a prince to King Molofaba, Orlando Martins, later a Nigerian star in international films about Africa80?become restless, beating out a message on their drums that "Sandy-is-dead" and therefore "There-is-no-law-any-more." Anarchy sets in, a rival group kidnaps Lilongo and her son, the heir-apparent to Bosambo's throne. Sanders returns, puts down the revolt, restores order, and rescues</page><page sequence="16">64 Lyman Bosambo's family. In gratitude, Bosambo sends his son off to government house so that he might learn how to become "a great, great chief like "Lord Sandy."81 Although black American critics exploded at Robeson's cinematic capitulation to colonialism, he did not abandon his mission to celebrate the genius of Africa and to bring Western recognition to that continent's aesthetic through cinema. In Jericho (1937), Robeson portrayed a World War I sailor falsely accused of a crime. He flees to North Africa, marries a princess of the Tuaregs (played by the light-skinned Sudanese actress Princess Kouka, whose skin, like that of Fredi Washington in The Emperor Jones, had to be darkened for the film) and becomes a Tuareg king. Another of the three films that he made abroad in 1937, Song of Freedom, seemed to have a better scenario for representing the African people and their aspirations, but its utterly implausible plot and implicit support for Anglocentric culture evoked little emanicipatory hope for the Empire's dark-skinned subjects. The screenplay took advantage of Robeson's talent as a singer, telling the story of John Zinga (Robeson) an Afro British dockworker whose recall of African songs speaks to the survival of the racial unconscious and ultimately?through a series of highly improbable events?leads him back to the tribe whose long-lost prince he really is. As early as 1794, it should be noted, an English apologist for his country's forays into Africa had written, "Societies may be divided into the civilized and the uncivilized', and the duties of the former to the latter are similar to those of parents to children; for uncivilized nations, like children, are governed by their affections, their understanding being uncultivated."82 Song of Freedom would give a new twist to this late eighteenth-century thesis. Zinga's singing propels him on to the stage, where a white anthropologist not only discerns the precise source of the African chant the black stevedore has sung since childhood, but also deciphers the meaning of the amulet that the singing dock worker wears around his neck. Zinga, it turns out, is not merely an African, he is the long-lost heir to the throne of Casanga. Dressed in pith helmets and the white outfits associated with the cinematic imagery of English missionaries, and accompanied by "a grinning black bearer" 83 (Robert Adams, a Guyanese actor who would do a send up of Robeson's "Bosambo" role in the 1939 parody, Old Bones of the River*4) Zinga and his wife (Elizabeth Welch) trek through the jungle to his ancestral home, overthrow the tribe's witch-doctor despot, and take over the governance of the natives. At movie's end, Zinga proposes a world-wide singing tour to raise money for medicine for his subjects. If Sanders of the River proclaimed the necessity for a Pax Britannica in Africa, while Song of Freedom suggested that overseas descendants of black Africans might still serve the civilizing interests of British imperialism though they retained their jungle temperament, King Solomon's Mines (1937) called upon Robeson to push these cinematic panegyrics to the Tightness of Anglo</page><page sequence="17">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 65 Saxon hegemony one step further. The movie is based on one-time-British colonial-officer-in-South-Africa H. Rider Haggard's novel of the same name. The book was first published in September, 1885, a bare six months after the Berlin Conference had divided the lands and peoples of Africa among the European Powers. As a publishing venture, it was so successful that it went through thirteen United States editions in its first year and had sold more than 650,000 copies by the time of its author's death in 1925. Before Tarzan movies had begun to leave their imprint on the Occident's mental map of Africa, Haggard's fantastic novel had served that popular need.85 In the movie version, it again falls to Robeson to play the part of a long lost African chief, "Umbopa," who is ekeing out a living as the faithful porter to white adventurers (Cedric Hardwicke and Roland Young), unaware that he is in fact the king of the Mashona people.86 According to Daniel J. Leab, "Robeson saw to it that the character was more than just a splendid savage,"87 and James R. Nesteby argues that "Robeson's performance is dignified and it effuses the strong presence always felt in his films."88 Nevertheless, the leit? motif of the film is the African's subservience to his British colonial masters. As one critic put it, "Robeson's ideals were lost in the rough and tumble of the film studio."89 Umbopa is eventually restored to his throne, but before he achieves full cinematic legitimation as the rightful king of the Mashona people he guides his British protectors to what they want, the rich mines. According to Thomas Cripps, Robeson performs "like a deep-bass teddy-bear, [as he] leads the lagging whites over the mountains singing a booming paean to white am? bition: Climbin' up, climbin' up, mighty mountain . . . mighty mountain . . . gonna climb you."90?and it is implied that with the aid of impressed African labor, the white adventurers will exploit the mines to line their own pockets while, of course, serving the interests of the Empire. In 1936, Robeson had recorded a prologue for a documentary originally entitled Africa Looks Up but released as My Song Goes Forth. Part of that narration stated, "Every foot of Africa is now parceled out among the white races. Why has this happened? What has prompted them to go there? If you listen to men like Mussolini, they will tell you it is to civilize?a divine task, entrusted to the enlightened peoples to carry the torch of light and learning, and to benefit the African people ... [In fact, however] Africa was opened up by the white man for the benefit of himself?to obtain the wealth it con? tained."91 In King Solomon's Mines, Robeson, a black American, had essayed the role of a fictional African chief, who not only does not oppose, but in fact aids the whites in their spoliation of Africa's people and resources. In the last of his feature films to touch on colonialist themes, Big Fella ' (1938), Robeson portrayed "Banjo" in a screenplay loosely based on Claude McKay's eponymous 1929 novel. Banjo would soon have enormous influence on such then emerging African poets and political leaders as Leopold Sedar</page><page sequence="18">66 Lyman Senghor, Aime Cesaire, and Leon Damas,92 but, according to McKay's biog? rapher, by "1934, novels such as . . . Banjo, which had celebrated the black man's primitive vitality in an increasingly mechanistic world, seemed dated and irrelevant."93 However, British and American film makers had not caught up to the literary world in the latter's depreciation of African primitivism; Big Fella presented one more variant of that all-too-popular theme. In the screenplay, Robeson essays the title role, portraying "Lincoln Agrippa Daily," "a child of the Cotton Belt," known to his workmates on the Marseilles docks as "Banjo" because that instrument always accompanies him on his vagabonding tramp all over the world.94 The film scenario introduces a homely little story around Banjo befriending a white waif, who follows him all over the drinking, whoring, knife-fighting spots of "The Ditch," the black seamen's name for the Vieux Port area of Marseilles.95 Sympathetic to the boy's plight, Banjo takes him in charge, protects him from the many dangers of the dockside, and eventually situates him with a white family, returning to his former life of ease on the waterfront.96 Virtually nothing is said in the film to indict the discriminatory situation that kept African, Caribbean, and American blacks from rising above their mean station in waterfront life. In fact "nowhere in the film does the Negro appear to suffer because of his colour."97 Robeson sought, unsuccessfully, in some critics' eyes, to inject a measure of bourgeois respectability to Banjo's character and conduct. The scriptwriters, supposedly under pressure from the star, made Banjo into "a steady, trustworthy sort of fellow," provided him with a white buddy, and changed the movie title in order to forestall any audience expectation that its screen hero is "a sort of 'Uncle Sambo' of the cotton plantations."98 Nevertheless, this film failed to achieve its intended aim. As a kind-hearted black man who restores a lost white boy to his family, Robeson's Banjo illustrated little more than cinema's image of the "good" Negro, a dedicated supporter of other people's living according to white, middle class values?even if he himself refuses to abide by them. The critic of Lagos's West African Pilot gave faint praise to the picture, pointing out that Robeson's "assignment is the usual one depicting him as a scum and a renegade," but noting that in spite of this fact, "he portrays the type of virtues which any race on earth would be glad to emulate."99 American and British movie makers explored and exploited the loyal ser? vant theme in movies made about Africa before and after the Robeson films. Such silent movies as The Zulu's Heart (1908) and The Kaffir's Gratitude (1915) had treated the black African as either a faithful bearer or an obsequious domes? tic. In 1931, the unyielding loyalty of the African native was brought almost to high art when, in Trader Horn, the eponymous trader (Harry Carey) and his young companion (Duncan Renaldo) are ably and nobly assisted by their African porter (Mutia Omooloo) as they search for a white woman (Edwina Booth) who has been captured by cannibals.100 Despite the fact that Omooloo's performance</page><page sequence="19">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 67 went far in establishing dramatic distance from the usual stereotypy, Hollywood filmmakers did not change their attitude toward or reconsider their usual treat? ment of Africans, off-screen or on. Mr. Omooloo, brought to America for further shooting, was treated as an anthropological oddity and subjected to numerous indignities.101 Trader Horn in fact reinforced the traditional image of white male supremacy. "Trader Aloysius Horn," write Alfred E. Opubor and Adebayo Ogun bi in their recent critical assessment of Africa-centered films, "like the 'invincible' white man and the 'great explorer,' has the honor of single-handedly encountering a whole tribe of Isorgi people and vanquishing them, along with their wild animals, in a mission to save a white girl from the scourge of 'fero? cious savages' and an inhospitable environment."102 An African Loyal Servant: The Career of Orlando Martins The several variations in the cinematic dichotomization of Africans as either villainous opponents or willing and eager subjects of their European colonial overlords are illustrated in the roles essayed by the Nigerian actor Or? lando Martins during his long European and American screen career. Born on December 8, 1899, to one of the elite black families of British-controlled Lagos, Martins ran away to England when he was 17. Tall, muscular, and good-look? ing, he first appeared in a few silent and early sound films (e.g., If Youth But Knew [1926]; Un-Blimey [1930]; Black Libel [1931]); as a Nubian slave in Diaghilev's London ballet performance of 1920; and in the touring company of the London stage revival of Showboat (1928).103 Slightly larger supporting roles came his way in such films as Tiger Bay (1933) and Java Head (1934)?in each of which he appeared in a vehicle starring Anna May Wong, then at the height of her career as the inevitably tragic but seductive Oriental siren in love with a white man. After appearing in Sanders of the River (1935), Martins acted in two more productions with Robeson?Jericho and Song of Freedom? and then brought his prewar movie career to an end with a bit part in the mystery-thriller Murder in Soho (1939). Martins's postwar movies started with The Man From Morocco, a film that gave great promise for a more realistic portrayal of Africans in European and American films. As "Jeremiah," an African who volunteers for service in the International Brigade that fought against the establishment of Franco's Fas? cist dictatorship in Spain, Martins's character is shown to be courageous, honorable, and capable of forming lasting friendships across the color line. In his scenes with the Czech colonel (Anton Walbrook), Jeremiah is treated as an equal to any of the other members of the multi-national force. Although the "film was inclined to be romantic and novelettish"104 and its politics recall one</page><page sequence="20">68 Lyman of Hollywood's prewar anti-Fascist films, Blockage (1938),105 this British film resisted making any statement other than its visual one about Martins's race: "Nowhere is there any reference to his colour, or any sort of discrimination indicated."106 However, the color-blindness in The Man From Morocco did not lead to an unalloyed sympathy for the anti-colonial movement among Africans in subsequent films made in the English or American studios. The fact that Martins co-starred in the much-acclaimed African theme film, Men of Two Worlds (1946),?a pro-colonial screenplay in which he essays the role of Magole, a villainous Tanganyikan witch doctor who uses his ex? traordinary powers of mind control to oppose the order of the kindly-disposed British Commissioner (Eric Portman) that his tribe move away from their tse-tse fly-infested settlement?indicates that his films of the fifties and sixties did not depart from the traditional mold. Events in East Africa aroused American cinematic sympathy for the area's white settlers and their descendants?then in process of displacement. The Mau-mau revolt that eventually would propel Jomo Kenyatta into the presidency of the newly independent state of Kenya was treated in two of Martins's films. In Simba (1955), he portrayed an African headman in a screenplay that had been designed to emphasize the savage ferocity of the African rebels. One year later Martins appeared in Safari (1956), a remarkably bloody picture in which a noble white man (Victor Mature) is driven to take violent revenge on the men of the Mau-mau who have murdered his wife and son. Another aspect of the noble-white-man-and-loyal-servant-vs.-uncivilized savages theme was presented in the two-film series Ivory Hunters (1952) and West of Zanzibar (1955) in which Martins played a familiar character of the genre. The first picture in the series purported to tell the story of how a white conservationist (Anthony Steel) created Kenya's national park system and con? tinues to manage it with the aid of "Mkwangi," (Martins), the African who oversees the native workers in the reserve.107 In the sequel, Orlando Martins once more portrays "Mkwangi," described by one Hollywood reporter "as a very black gun bearer . . . [who] gets amiably drunk, goes on the make for a dusky playgirl and caps the climax by kicking a native cop . . . ."108 The plot line pits the native Kenyan reserve workers, led by their clear-eyed, courageous white boss against East Indian ivory poachers. The poachers are depicted not only as "foreign" law-breakers, but as evil-doers motivated by the desire to spend their ill-gotten gains on "used European clothes." In this film such a purpose is deemed so heinous that a native chief (Edric Conner) is roused to enlist himself and his people in the white naturalist's fight against the unwar? ranted encroachments on Kenya's wildlife.109 While making these films, Martins witnessed, experienced, and protested against the indignities heaped upon black Africans by white service and movie personnel.110 Barred from Cairo's Norfolk Hotel and Bar, where the white cast</page><page sequence="21">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 69 members were housed and entertained, he was first routed to a local schoolteacher's home and then moved to a roadside inn. At one restaurant he became so incensed over an East Indian bartender's refusal to sell him a drink that he threatened to burn the place down. During the course of shooting Ivory Hunters, Martins refused to come onto the set unless the all-white South African crew discontinued its contemptuous treatment of the colored members of the cast and staff. In accordance with the conventional modes of film advertising then in vogue, the lobby posters made for the Ivory Hunters would not even have listed his or any other black actor's name in the cast; when he protested the practice, his and other African actors' names were printed in letters so small "that one has to strain one's eyes to be able to read them." Back in London, he discovered he was the only actor not invited to the Royal Command Per? formance of the movie. Similar treatment occurred during and after the making of West of Zanzibar. Martins was not invited to the party for the picture's cast and crew given by Zanzibar's Colonial Resident. When he went uninvited, he was insulted by the local Police Commissioner, a snub that he sought to repay in kind at the London showing. Martins discovered that there was little gratitude for the support his roles lent to the colonial mystique. In the last two decades of his film career in Anglo-American productions, Martins's roles did not challenge the well-worn colonial myth of the benevolent white master and his loyal black servant. His much-praised mime portrayal of "Blossom,"?a non-English speaking Basuto soldier who, by his example, helps "Yank" (Ronald Reagan) and the rest of his white fellow-convalescents in a World War II Burmese hospital to empathize with a dying Scotsman (Richard Todd)?elevates the theme of the black man's faithful service to an epiphany (The Hasty Heart [1950]).111 However, despite the sensitivity of Martins's portrayal, its memorability has been spoiled by one film historians's reduction of the actor to anonymity: ". . . [T]he scene in which the black African with no English shows that he likes the Scot provided a comforting message to the postwar world."112 Subsequent roles proved far less fulfilling and offered even less oppor? tunity for making a socially relevant statement. Martins appeared as the African chief Ogonooro in Tarzan and the Lost Safari (1957, with the usual abject subservience before the white lord of the jungle (Gordon Scott);113 as a barman in a British mystery?loosely based on the Notting Hill race riots of 1950? about the search for the murderer of a mulatto woman who had passed for white (Sapphire [1959]);114 as an African native who will benefit from a white engineer's (Robert Taylor) unstinting efforts to build the first railroad in East Africa (Killers of Kilimanjaro [I960];115 as a grinning, much befeathered, leopard-skinned savage in a comedy about a fake Africanist (Bob Hope) pressed into service by the President of the United States to retrieve a strategic missile's nose cone that has been lost in Africa (Call Me Bwana [1963]);116 as "Abu</page><page sequence="22">70 Lyman Lubaba," a Moslem wise man returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the many interesting characters encountered by an orphaned white boy (Fergus McClelland) on his way from Port Said to Durban in search of his aunt (A Boy Ten Feet Tall [1965]);116 and, at the end of his long film career, as a Masai chief (in Mr. Moses, [1965]) who must chose between cooperating with "Joe Moses" (Robert Mitchum), the white expert sent to move his people to a new area because the traditionally occupied tribal land has been scheduled for flooding to make way for a new dam, or joining the resistance, led by the American-educated son of the tribe's witch doctor (Raymond St. Jacques).118 As might be expected, Martins's character sees the light in the form of the Masai's white benefactor. CONCLUSION Like virtually every other institution of American popular culture, movies have been afflicted by what Gunnar Myrdal called the "American Dilemma." As Myrdal, a Swedish economist and sociologist who had been brought to the United States by the Carnegie Corporation in 1937 to study and propose measures that would alleviate the country's race problem, saw the matter: The 'American Dilemma* ... is the ever-raging conflict between, on the one hand, the valuations preserved on the general plane which we shall call the * American Creed,* where the American thinks, talks, and acts under the influence of high national and Christian precepts, and, on the other hand, the valuations on specific planes of individual and group living, where personal and local interests; economic, social, and sexual jealousies; considerations of community prestige and conformity; group prejudice against particular persons or types of people; and all sorts of miscellaneous wants, impulses, and habits dominate his outlook. However, Myrdal failed to see that the "ever-raging conflict," whose resolution in behalf of the "higher values" of the American Creed he sought to encourage, might be resolved on the side of "group prejudice against par? ticular . . . types of people," or, worse, that the values he associated with "high national and Christian precepts" might be made consistent with racist imagery and racially discriminatory acts against African Americans. Myrdal was not unaware of the Negrophobic stereotypy that was ubiq? uitous in America's mass culture and especially pronounced in its moving pic? tures. However, his cautious optimism led him to see "a definite improvement, in the last year or so, in the treatment of Negroes in movies ..." and to voice the assurance that such efforts as that of the National Association For The Advancement of Colored People will, "if continued, . . . have some effect, especially when further pressure comes from war agencies of the federal government."120 In this respect, Myrdal echoed the hopes of all those liberal</page><page sequence="23">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 71 minded critics of Hollywood's treatment of African Americans who peri? odically predicted the imminence of a new and more honorable screen presen? tation of black American "sociotypes" rising to replace filmdom's outworn and demeaning "stereotypes."121 In fact, the announcement of this much desired breakthrough has become a staple of sociologically-informed film criticism. When, in 1915 and the three years thereafter, such eminent opinion leaders as Booker T. Washington, John Collier, Walter Lippmann, and the NAACP jointly and separately savaged the racial prejudices that were inflamed by portraying the Ku Klux Klan as a band of Caucasians fighting "in defense of their Aryan birthright,"122 [D. W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation (a screenplay based on Thomas Dixon's Negrophobic 1905 novel, The Clansman)123, there was some hope that film-makers would become sensitive to the needs and feelings of their black audiences.124 After protests by the Hays Office had forced the makers of Gone With the Wind (1939) to substitute the less than complimentary word "darkie" for the pejorative "nigger" in the screenplay,125 and upon hearing that Hattie McDaniel would become the first black actor to receive an Academy Award for her role essaying the faithful and wise "mammy" to Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara, some followers of Hollywood's treatment of Negro themes and actors supposed that in these respects matters would soon improve greatly.126 As World War II was coming to an end, L. D. Reddick took heart from the facts that, in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), the lone Negro (Leight Whipper) in this screenplay about a lynching is shown to be on the side of "justice, humanity and civilization"; that, in In This Our Life' (1942), the Negro boy (Ernest Anderson) "airs the Negro problem with courage and dignity"; and that, in Bataan (1943), a black soldier (Kenneth Spencer) is "drawn as naturally and sympathetically as are any of his half dozen companions." But Reddick went on to warn that the pattern of change had not yet reached the plane wherein Hollywood's filmic imagination would "have Negro life admitted to the full range of human characterization, . . . [would] eliminate the 'race-linking' of vice and villainies, and . . . [would] have Negro actors on the screen treated 'like everybody else'.127 Twenty-two years later, Charles Boren, the president of the Association of Motion Picture and Television Film Producers publicly thanked the NAACP and its national labor director, Herbert Hill, for doing his organization "a great service in making us aware of the depth of the problems involved" in the employment and characterizations given to black actors, and he went on to express the hope that "if we can do something about this image question we will have done more for race relations than we would by hiring thousands of Negroes, although we know both portrayal and employment issues are vital."128 And yet another twenty-two years later, cineast and historian Donald Bogle, though more than willing to celebrate the accomplishments of black actors past and present, complained that present-day films showcasing the talents of such black</page><page sequence="24">72 Lyman superstars as Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Gregory Hines, Billy Dee Wil? liams, and Danny Glover "[m]uch too often . . . failed to uncover the tensions or conflicts of black men in pursuit of some goal or personal aspiration." Their films, Bogle went on to observe, "were tributes to the theme of interracial male bonding." These pictures continued and updated the theme of the loyal black servant?"the tough, assertive white man learns about emotions and the spirit from his good black friend," but also denied these newly discovered mammy-surrogate males a love life or even a strong sexual identity. "Rarely were [Eddie] Murphy or [Richard] Pryor seen in romantic situations with black women, causing the stars sometimes to look, for all their modernity, like asexual pods of the past."129 Myrdal, like other optimistic critics of America's race relations, under? estimated the depth to which racism and its attendant attitudes, prejudices, and stereotypes had become sedimented within American culture.130 Such race prejudice as exists in America has taken the form of what Herbert Blumer calls "a sense of group position"?a sense, that is, that the members of the other race are below, beyond and have unwarranted designs on the culture and civilization of the self-arrogated superior race. According to the tenets of such a cluster of attitudes, opinions, pseudo-sociologies and con? jectural histories, Africans and Afro-Americans are subjected to a multiform inferiorization process. That process locates both their occupations and char? acter within the structure of a bi-racial caste and class order. As part of the invigoration and reinforcement of that order, the institutions of mass and popular culture, and especially the movies made in Hollywood, contribute the products of a culturally-embedded cinematic imagination?a "dream fac? tory" that perpetuates the character of black men as loyal-servant "toms," lusty "bucks," foolish "coons," foolhardy "superspades," ignorant "sambos," or faithful "sidekicks," while demeaning black women as wise but dependent "mammies," silly and stupid slaveys, exotic sirens, forbidden "brown sugar," or tragic mulattoes. These characterologies, together with the color of their anatomies, are inextricably connected to the cinematic thesis that black Americans are bound to an irremediably savage African past and consigned to an irrevocably demeaning American destiny. For the most part, America's movies have built upon three centuries of stereotypical imagery to depict an Africa and Afro-America that is consistent with the society's deeply engrained cultural misinformation about the origins and future of dark skinned people. In the process, they have elaborated on the myopic vision and embroidered upon a mass psychology of racism and cultural prejudice that shows few signs of being undone.</page><page sequence="25">Images of Blacks in American Cinema 73 REFERENCE NOTES 1.

Despairingly, he an? nounced that the black American's 'present is problematic, his past unknown, and his future uncertain.' In an existential funk, Lyman could only talk vaguely about a 'sociology of the absurd.'" Of course, the entire thrust of my book was to point to the failure of sociologists to ground their prognostications and nostrums in the historical record.
