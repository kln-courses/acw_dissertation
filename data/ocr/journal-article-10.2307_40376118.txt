<plain_text><page sequence="1">Humans, Animals, and Play: Theorizing Interaction When Intersubjectivity is Problematic* Colin Jerolmack New York University Simmel (1949) argues that humans have an "impulse" toward sociability, defined as noninstrumental, playful association that is enjoyed as an end in itself While so- ciability as conceived of by Simmel necessitates a shared definition of the situation, recent studies problematize symbolic interactionist assumptions by documenting the ways humans engage in analogous sociable play with animals. Drawing from eth- nomethodological and pragmatist perspectives, this article offers a way to theorize human-animal encounters and their relationship to interactions among humans. Be- ginning with a conceptualization of play as an interpretive frame (Goffman 1986) that actors can employ to organize situated interactions, this article argues that hu- mans can engage in playful associations with animals even if animals do not share in the play frame. It illustrates how play with animals can preserve some of the forms and satisfactions of interaction with humans, and it clarifies how interaction can be coordinated and understood when we cannot assume that interactants share intersub- jectivity. The article concludes by offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the possibilities of sociable play, based on the degree of potential intersubjectivity and other situational factors. Solitary playfulness will give way to sociable playfulness when a usable other appears, which, in many cases, can be a member of another species. (Erving Goffman, Frame Analysis, 1986) This article compares play among humans to play between humans and animals. It seeks to conceptualize what formal features of play may only be probable through symbolic interaction as well as what features of play may be preserved in encounters in which understandings of the interaction are asymmetrically available. Examining human-animal play helps us understand how interaction can be achieved when it cannot be assumed that interactants share a "definition of the situation" (Thomas 1923). Such situations are common even among humans, such as interactions with infants, the cognitively impaired, and those with whom one does not share language. Rather than drawing a symbolic interactionist line in the sand, this article views interactions along a continuum of greater or lesser potential for intersubjectivity. * Address correspondence to: Colin Jerolmack, Department of Sociology, New York University, 295 Lafayette St., 4th Floor, New York, NY 10012.

Sociological Theory 27:4 December 2009 © American Sociological Association. 1430 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20005</page><page sequence="2">372 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY Play is a qualitatively unique cognitive frame (Bateson 1972; Goffman 1986) and category of experience. It is activity that is autotelic (Irvine 2004), or performed as an end in itself, and marked by a bracketing of instrumental motivations. Goffman (1961b, 1986) writes that, in play encounters, participants construct a "membrane" within which potentially "serious" actions are "keyed" (translated) as "unserious" and performed for the simple pleasure of doing. As a "time out" from purposive activity, play can offer a much-needed escape from our formal roles and instrumentally driven interactions. In a classic essay, Simmel (1949:255) argues that humans have an "impulse" to construct artful, playful interactions out of everyday social encounters. Simmel gives the name sociability to this "play-form of association," in which satisfaction is obtained in "the very fact that one is associated with others and that the solitariness of the individual is resolved into togetherness, a union with others." Most if not all scholars of play in general, and sociability in particular, assume that play requires that interactants share intersubjectivity. x This is the case because for potentially serious matters to be successfully "keyed" as play - such as ritual insults - participants must share the "special attitude" (Simmel 1949:258) and signal to others that they are defining the situation as unserious (Bateson 1972; Goffman 1986; Lee 2009). To the extent that participants do mutually frame strips of action this way, all such activities can be said to be an instantiation of the play form. Thus, Goffman (1986:45) writes: For participants, playing, say at fighting and playing around at checkers feels to be much the same sort of thing - radically more so than when these two activities are performed in earnest . . . Fighting and checker playing would appear to be going on, but really, all along, the participants might say, the only thing really going on is play. The requisites for play, then, correspond to the basic tenets of symbolic interaction (Blumer 1969; Mead 1934:151). But this presents a fundamental dilemma: whereas Mead (1934) argues that only humans can use metacommunicative signals, animal ethologists (Bateson 1972; Bekoff 2006; Fagen 1981; Loizos 1967) demonstrate that all sorts of animals make use of such signals to play. Play among animals necessitates frames in precisely the way that Goffman (1986:11) defines them, as "principles of organization" that govern the interpretation of events. Animals, Bateson (1956, 1972) observes, often make use of fighting behaviors such as biting, growling, or stalking when they play. The play is patterned after fighting, but the animals successfully signal "this is play" to each other so that there is a "transformation ... of a strip of fighting behavior into a strip of play" (Goffman 1986:41). The picture gets more complicated. Goffman (1986:41) recognizes that animal play "is play in a sense similar to what one thinks of as play among humans." In ad- dition, he acknowledges that "play is possible between humans and many species" (1986:41). Sensing the hot button he has pushed - particularly for symbolic interac- tionists following Mead - Goffman adds that this is "a fact not to be dwelt upon 1 "Something is intersubjective if there are ways of reaching agreement about it, even though it may not be independent of the human mind (and hence not objective), e.g., the hypothesis that a certain chemical tastes like pineapple might be intersubjectively testable" (Lacey 1996:163-64). As we will see, there are layers of intersubjectivity - from absolute shared perspective/understanding among two or more actors down to a simple shared awareness of an object in the setting.</page><page sequence="3">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 373 when we sustain our usual congratulatory versions of the difference between us and them" (1984:41). This implies that, while Simmel's notion of sociability requires a shared definition of the situation, perhaps not all forms of association enjoyed for its own sake - what Goffman (1986) refers to as "sociable play" - require such a degree of mutuality. Indeed, in the past decade or so a growing number of studies have ex- amined how it is that humans and animals pull off playing together when symbolic interaction is problematic (Alger and Alger 2003; Arluke and Sanders 1996; Irvine 2004; Sanders 1999; Shapiro 1990). Much of this work on human-animal interaction solves the Meadian dilemma by arguing that dogs and cats can symbolically interact with humans, even with- out language. But there appears to be myriad mundane possibilities of human- animal interaction - and even human-human interaction (e.g., Goode 1994; Hendriks 1998) - in which it cannot be, or simply is not, assumed that the interactants con- struct a shared frame. While symbolic interactionist requisites are useful signposts for making sense out of some human-animal interactions, such an approach still draws a boundary that excludes interactions that we are interested in - including play. While the priority of means over ends holds true for all types of play (Miller 1973), here I am most interested in the subcategory of play where the goal is primarily association with others for its own sake. These play forms of association, which in following Goffman, I conceive of as sociable play,2 are distinct from other activities that may be framed as play such as: role playing, where the actor imagines other selves; or competitive games, where the actor seeks to best her opponent(s); or chance games, where the actor hopes to beat the odds. Below I sketch how sociable play is enacted in encounters between different inter- actants. I touch on examples of how humans can achieve play with their companion dogs, and even with "simpler" animals. Rather than assuming intersubjectivity, I problematize it. Drawing from ethnomethodological (Garfinkel 1967) and pragmatist (James 1907) insights, I argue that humans can still obtain a Simmelian satisfaction- in-association with actors such as animals without demonstrated intersubjectivity. This is possible because shared understandings or intentions are not required for coordinated interaction - even if they enhance interaction. Those with whom we cannot assume mutuality can still be "usable others" (Goffman 1986:43) for play partners. Human-animal encounters can teach us about the form and limits of play. They help us examine the ways in which the framing of an encounter as play may be un- evenly distributed across actors (see Goode 2006). Situations in which it is obviously unlikely that humans and animals share understandings and interests illuminate less obvious cases of the same phenomenon among humans.3 I am specifically interested in the relations between the various human-human and human-animal play possibil- ities, and the ways in which we can understand them as differing in degree - along a continuum of greater and lesser possible intersubjectivity and interactive complex- ity, for example, rather than kind. Thus, I conclude by offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the myriad possibilities of sociable play. 2 In this article, the term play is used as shorthand for "sociable play" if it is obvious that I am referring to playful associations, or if I intentionally seek to relate it to other forms of play. ^Indeed, in making a point about the effect of differing social positions on framing, Goitman (1986:8) notes: "There is a sense in which what is play for the golfer is work for the caddy."</page><page sequence="4">374 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY FRAMING PLAY AMONG HUMANS AND AMONG ANIMALS One of the most famous essays on sociable play is Simmel's (1949) aforementioned essay on sociability, which he refers to as "the play form of association" (1949:255). We engage in sociability when we engage in associations that are enjoyed for their own sake - that is, noninstrumental associations. In such encounters, the form of interaction takes precedence over the substantive content. Furthermore, sociability is "spared [the] frictional relations" of "real life" (1949:255). As such a bracketing, there is a tension in sociability, which requires work and a "special attitude" (1949:258) among all participants in order to maintain its separation from "real life." Simmel argues that, for participants to be able to share enjoyment in the association, socia- bility requires a temporary "democracy of equals" (cf. Riesman 1960:257), which is made possible by bracketing status and instrumental matters - among other things - which would direct attention away from "a feeling of worth of association as such" (cf. Mills 1958:255). While the criteria for sociability may be abstract, most of us would recognize socia- bility in practice. After work, employees of varying statuses may share drinks while exchanging "tales, witticisms, [and] anecdotes" (Simmel 1949:259); inner-city African- American males may construct artful lyrical duels - once referred to as "the dozens" (see Abrahams 1962; Lee 2009) - in which insults are jocularly parried largely as a "mere means to maintain the liveliness . . . [and] the common consciousness of the group" (Simmel 1949:259-60); or old timers may gather at corners and gen- eral stores (see Bauman 1972) and elaborate upon any "conversational resource" (Watson and Potter 1962) that sustains the flow of interaction. These interactions are not oriented toward situations, statuses, or goals outside of the immediate en- counter. The reward is primarily in the "doing" of association with others. Numerous scholars have studied play more generally, and its variety of man- ifestations (Csikszentmihalyi 1975; Herron and Sutton-Smith 1971; Millar 1974). While such studies may attempt to classify the types of play that commonly occur (i.e., chance games, sports, role playing), the primary goal is often to examine the generic form that tends to be shared by activities regarded as play (Caillois 1961; Csikszentmihalyi and Bennett 1971; Goffman 1961b). Perhaps surprisingly, these scholars often compare human play and animal play (Bekoff 2006; Goffman 1986; Miller 1973; Sutton-Smith 1997). In a classic work, Huizinga (1955) summarizes the formal characteristics of play in similar terms as Simmel's sociability: A free [voluntary] activity standing quite consciously outside "ordinary" life as being "not serious," but at the same time absorbing the player intensely ... it is an activity connected to no material interest ... It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner [1955:12] ... At any moment "ordinary life" may reassert its rights either by an impact from without, which interrupts the game, or by an offense against the rules, or else from within, by a collapse of the play spirit, a sobering, a disenchantment. (1955:21). Riezler (1941:511) adds that, in play, we "put in place meanings, demands, and obligations of our own making. In playing, we enjoy being our own masters" (cf. Miller 1973:97; Tuan 1984). There is definitive overlap in the myriad definitions of play, two components of which are most notable: (1) play involves a certain special "attitude" or "spirit" that frames the activity and (2) means take precedence over ends.</page><page sequence="5">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 375 Schwartzman (1978:169) emphasizes that play is "not a distinctive behavioral cat- egory ... it is viewed as an attitude or frame that can be adopted towards anything" (cf. Sutton-Smith 1997:23). The notion of play as a frame comes from Bateson (1972, 1956), who examines the ways that animals communicate to each other the message that "this is play." The paradox of animal play is that actions such as biting or scratching stand as signals of aggression in many contexts, yet in play animals send and receive such signals but attach a different meaning to them. Mead would seem to have trouble explaining this phenomenon. Mead (1934:42-44) describes a dog fight in order to demonstrate that, while there is a "conversation of gestures," it does not involve signs. A growl or aggressive stance acts only as an immediate "stimulus to the other [dog] to adjust itself to those responses" (1934:43), not as a "signif- icant symbol" that stands for a larger meaning. Perhaps Mead would have come to a different conclusion had he taken play-fighting seriously, in which animals rely on fighting moves to signal and commence "unserious" behavior.4 Pulling off this translation seems to involve relying upon distinct, contextual cognitive frames that define what a series of behaviors will mean and that disallow actions that contradict this frame. A frame is "metacommunicative. Any message that either explicitly or implicitly defines a frame, ipso facto gives the receiver instructions or aids in his attempt to understand the messages included within the frame" (Bateson 1972:188). When an animal signals "this is play," such as the dog's famous "play bow" (Bekoff 2006), a frame emerges in which a bite no longer stands for an act of aggres- sion. Other meanings, anchored to other frames, are bracketed (Fagen 1981; Loizos 1967). Bateson's notion of the play frame became the basis for Goffman's concept of the frame as a way to understand the organization of experience in general (1986). In this sense, "strips" of action are defined by actors in a context-specific way. Games, Goffman (1961b: 10) says, "place a 'frame' around a spate of immediate events, determining the type of 'sense' that will be accorded everything within the frame." Quoting Simmel, Goffman notes that individuals will bracket certain atti- tudes, emotions, and outside status components5 that would threaten the prevailing mood that "this is play." Such threatening elements "should be considered irrelevant, out of frame, or not happening" (Goffman 1961b:25). A play encounter is constantly threatened with collapse, such as if players become engrossed in side encounters or misinterpret signals. Goffman (1986:41-42) emphasizes the voluntary, repetitive use of exaggerated and inefficient gestures and the employment of self-handicapping, repair, or role reversal in play. If the special attitude of the play frame is maintained, then the player can become totally engrossed in it. There is an "effortless disassociation from all other events" (Goffman 1961b:38): By this spontaneous involvement in joint activity, the individual becomes an integral part of the situation, lodged in it and exposed to it, infusing himself into the encounter in a manner quite different from the way an ideally rational player commits his side to a position in an ideally abstract game. (1961:38). 4 Mead (1934:150) briefly explains (away) play-fighting in dogs as simply low intensity fighting: "Two dogs playing with each other will attack and defend, in a process which if carried through would amount to an actual fight. There is a combination of responses which checks the depth of the bite." 5 Contra Simmel (1949), Goffman maintains that personal characteristics and status can always remain in play (1961b:21). But, their relevance is reduced or transformed in play (cf. Lee 2009); for example, Whyte (1993:45-49) demonstrates how, in a clique he studied, one's social status mapped to his bowling score.</page><page sequence="6">376 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY However, when play is in conflict with other demands or interests so that it is not spontaneous and engrossing, there may be a feeling of unease or boredom rather then enjoyment (Csikszentmihalyi 1975). The management of this tension is a core component of play. Play can occur, then, whenever players frame an encounter as play. As stated, such an attitude draws the focus of attention to the means, not the ends, of interaction. Miller (1973:89) notes that, in baboon play, motor patterns "involve much flailing, bobbing, exaggeration, and indirect, ineffective action. In short, the appearance of baboon play has a unique 'gallumphing' quality" (cf. Loizos 1967). Also, as Goffman notes for human play, there is unnecessary repetition of actions, role reversal, and self-handicapping. Miller (1973:91) claims that this "galumphing" quality is one of the defining markers of social play in humans too, in which "deliberate complication" of actions {means) is carried out for the simple "pleasure of doing." "The process becomes play when it becomes interesting in itself. . .Within play the act of doing is clearly rewarding in the sense that it incites its own repetition" (1973:91). Miller (1973:92) stresses that, while ends "are not obliterated," they do not "determine the means" in play. In this way, play often builds upon standard routines or structures, but allows for new combinations or inventive variations of these means in order to enjoy the flow of the encounter. Understanding play as a frame instead of an episode (see Riesman and Watson 1964) allows us to see how it can arise out of seemingly "serious" episodes, as well as how it can be absent from supposedly playful episodes. For example, within the "serious" task of closing a business deal actors may find enjoyment in the association itself and seek to enhance it through banter. Conversely, partygoers may be disinterested in the associations they make and seek to minimize their involvement with others. Thus play is a sort of laminate that can be layered over almost any sort of interaction to transform its meaning (Goffman 1986:82). A fact that has been given scant sociological attention is that not all playful en- counters are "equal." If specific patterns of playful behavior are seen as "motifs" (Mitchell and Thompson 1990), then it appears that the number and complexity of motifs available as a resource for playful interaction will vary based on the in- teractants and features of the context. For example, older and younger children playing together may have differential access to behavioral repertoires that they can bring to bear on interaction, and they may have differential cognitive abilities by which to enjoy, assess, and respond to the situation (cf. Goode 1994). In addition, those who share a history together may have developed a "private culture" (Fine 1981) that can serve as a vast resource from which to construct a wider variety of playful interactions than those available to strangers. Play seems more likely to occur in certain settings - such as a park - than others - like an office. It is out of an attempt to organize this variation in play - particularly regarding the problem of intersubjectivity - that the rest of this article examines the possibilities for fram- ing various human-animal encounters as sociable play. As opposed to theories that elevate animals to symbolic interactants in order to explicate coordinated human- animal interaction, below I flesh out an approach that can explain human-animal interactions without the need to assume "minds" or shared meanings. This approach helps us relate human-animal interactions to interactions among humans, and it prevents us from throwing the baby out with the bath water. That is, associations with humans and animals are still possible and enjoyable to humans even if symbolic interaction is impossible. It is useful to consider symbolic interaction as an ideal type by which to compare various interactions along a continuum of intersubjectivity.</page><page sequence="7">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 377 PLAYING WITH DOGS Human guardians play with their companion dogs all the time. Such play can take many forms, such as chase games or fetch. In everyday talk, humans tend to label such activities as play; and they often assume that their pets share in this understand- ing of such interactions. That is, their pets appear to them to instigate and enjoy such interactions, and humans construct play routines based on this assumption. Recently, interactionists have turned their attention to human-dog play, revealing the depth and complexity of this everyday, taken-for-granted phenomenon. Contra Mead (1934), many of these scholars claim that the interactions of guardians and their companion animals meet many of the prerequisites of symbolic interaction, despite the absence of language (Alger and Alger 2003; Arluke and Sanders 1996; Irvine 2004; Sanders 1999). One of the signature features of play, according to Bateson and Goffman, is the initiating move that signals "this is play." Dogs appear to successfully send this signal to humans. Sanders (1999:46), for example, describes how one of his dogs may grab a stick from among many others and then entice him or the other dog to pursue the stick. Once the stick becomes a "play stick," a number of play variations can be elaborated upon to keep a fetch game interesting. Thus, dogs can initiate play by bringing certain "play objects" to their guardian or other animals, or by gravitating to certain locations where playful encounters often occur (Alger and Alger 2003; Irvine 2004). The "play bow" - when a dog pushes its rear end upward while bowing its head downward - is one of the most common signals employed by dogs, with other dogs and humans, to signal that the behaviors that follow are to be understood as play (Bekoff 2006; Mechling 1989). Sanders offers this as evidence that these animals understand what play is in the same way that humans do. Over time, humans and their dogs develop play routines in which they gravitate toward certain games and develop signals to stop, start, and maintain play. They create stereotyped gestures and interpersonal traditions that can lead to "elaborate and complex interactive routines" (Mechling 1989:314). Humans do not simply teach their dogs how to play; they evolve routines together - ones that work for them. Participants only define certain objects and locations as "in play," and instances of self-handicapping recur in order to keep the play going. Within these strips of activity, a "move" in the game, such as a dog's growl or a human chasing the dog, has a different meaning to the other than in another context, where a dog growling at the person or the person chasing the dog could be out of anger (see Irvine 2001, 2004). Indeed, "a dog can very nicely distinguish between being kicked and being tripped over" (Goffman 1986:186). The same goes for the human. In effect, this seems to indicate that both participants frame the strip of activity as something distinct from "ordinary life" (Huizinga 1955). It also appears that, like intimate human relationships, over time a history of play together enables dog and human to develop their own sort of limited "private culture" (Fine 1981; Mechling 1989; Sanders 2003) that serves as a resource for interpreting actions in situ and elaborating upon play structures. One observable component of this is the employment of what appears to be deceit, which increases with familiarity. Scholars have examined how both human and dog "fool" the other, such as when a dog drops a ball close enough to a human for the human to feel that she has a chance to grab it, but then snatches it away (Goode 2006; Mitchell and Thompson 1986; Sanders 1999; Shapiro 1990). In these instances, deceit becomes a way to elaborate on play structures such as stick games and chase, prolonging their</page><page sequence="8">378 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY enjoyment. The "trick" seems to be to maintain the flow of play so that it remains engrossing for participants (Csikszentmihalyi 1975; Irvine 2004). Thus, even if there is an understanding of a "goal" on the part of the human to keep a ball away from the dog, the means of achieving these goals often receive priority in the activity and provide for the human's enjoyment of it. There is another way that human-dog play echoes human sociable play in the ways described by Simmel (1949) and Goffman (1986): in some ways it exhibits a leveling of differences that would distract from mutual participation in play. Mitchell and Thompson (1990) demonstrate how humans and dogs adjust their behavior over time so that they can both be easily attuned to the encounter. For example, if the human succeeds "too well" in keeping the ball away from the dog by teasing the dog with the ball but never offering a possibility for the dog to obtain it, the dog will likely lose interest and the interaction will cease. After analyzing video-taped segments of human-animal play, Mitchell and Thompson (1990:189) conclude that, if players are somehow incompatible in ways that inhibit the easy initiation and sustaining of play, "players are expected to entice each other through self-handicapping, refusal to play... and manipulation" (cf. Shapiro 1990). SHARED UNDERSTANDING OR COMPATIBLE PROJECTS? Regarding human-dog play, Sanders (1999:140) claims: For successful interaction to take place, these actors must possess certain basic abilities and share fundamental understandings. The foundation of this exchange is the mutual definition of the situation in which the interaction is taking place. Central to the situational definition is a mutual understanding of who the actors are in the specific context and the purpose of the exchange - each actor is aware of his or her definition of the situation and goals and, in turn, estimates the understandings and goals of the other. Of key importance is the ability of each actor to take the role of the other . . . These symbolic interactionist tenets - subscribed to by a handful of human-animal interactionists (Alger and Alger 2003; Arluke and Sanders 1996; Irvine 2004) - are precisely those that Mead laid down, though of course he grounds them in language and argues that "the conversation of gestures is not significant below the human level" (1934:81). While there appears to be mutual attunement to the situation and to the other, and while dogs and humans seem to be able to send and receive signals in ways that enable them to pull off the coordinated activity of play, must they share a definition of the situation and take the role of the other to do so? What would it take to verify or falsify such a claim? To be sure, as these scholars point out, even among humans we can never "really" know the answer to these questions - although we can find evidence to support such a stance. Yet "we act as if we can achieve intersubjectivity, and this works, for all practical purposes" (Jerolmack 2005:658, emphasis in original; see also Garfinkel 1967). But, rather than treating the intrinsic problem of intersubjectivity in any interaction as a caution against making symbolic interactionist claims about human-animal relations, human-animal interactionists tend to use this dilemma as a warrant to make such claims (Arluke and Sanders 1996:79; Alger and Alger 2003; Irvine 2004; for an overview of theoretical approaches to this dilemma, see Cerulo 2009).</page><page sequence="9">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 379 In a break from the symbolic interactionist assumption that the play frame must be shared by humans and animals, Mechling (1989:316) argues that "the partici- pants . . . might have dramatically different motives and understandings of the event and still interact 'successfully,' that is, in a way satisfying ... to the participants." Goffman (1986), as Mechling notes, explores the construction of fraudulent frames, in which "con artists" construct a frame for the other(s) that they do not share and that enables the "con" to be successful. The implication of this perhaps obvious example is that we can never know if two or more players share an understanding of the play frame. This echoes the point made by ethnomethodologists (Garfinkel 1967; Goode 1994, 2006). Mechling (1989:319) calls it the "equality fallacy" when- ever it is assumed that participants are equal in power and competence to define and understand an encounter. In this regard, some participants may even be coerced into an encounter that is defined as play by another (see Tuan 1984). Symmetry is not necessary for coordinated interaction to occur. But how is this possible? Mitchell and Thompson (1986, 1990) introduce an alternative way to think through the problem while still recognizing that the "work" of play involves a high level of coordination, sustained tension, and attunement to the other. The authors (1986:193) argue that all actors have intentions, which orient them to organize "projects" de- fined as "the pattern of actions a player uses in attempts to control the other player's actions." In "social play" each member has her own project, which she must coordinate with the other's project to sustain the interaction. This involves mutual adjustment; the tension revolves around each member seeking to engage her own project while enabling opportunities for the other to engage in his project. For ex- ample, a human may have the project of keeping the ball away from the dog, whose project may be to acquire the ball. As mentioned above, if the human succeeds "too well" by never giving the dog an opportunity to fulfill its project, the dog will likely lose interest. Thus, the human will "handicap" her ability to make their projects compatible. The more the projects are compatible, the less adjustment required. Although "players' activities are pursued in common, nothing about these activities requires that the participants share common goals" (Mitchell and Thompson 1986: 194). In an ethnomethodological study of human-dog play, Goode (2006) comes to a similar result, saying that the actors have "asymmetrical availability" to the meanings of the interaction. Yet dogs and humans likely have some ability to "recognize the directionality of each other's projects and actions" (Mitchell and Thompson 1986:202), evidenced in players' ability to regularly anticipate the other's action. As Goode (2006:144) points out, it is not necessarily that "shared understandings do not occur," but rather that "social orderliness is not predicated upon them." Faulkner and Becker (2009) vividly demonstrate this phenomenon among jazz musicians.6 SATISFYING THE IMPULSE FOR PLAYFUL ASSOCIATION- WITH ANIMALS Humans may have warrants for believing that they share the play frame with their dogs. But sociologically, we are just as interested in the consequence of this belief. From a pragmatist perspective, we want to know the "cash value" (James 1907) of acting as if mutuality exists in guiding one's actions. This is not to imply that there need not be evidence to support one's belief of a shared frame. Rather, I mean 6Fuchs (1989:122) also argues that "orderly interaction" needs not "rely on problematic assumptions about factual or 'functionally necessary' consensus to account for [its] possibility."</page><page sequence="10">380 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY to say that if humans' everyday interactions with their animals provide support for such a belief, and if future interactions constructed as if this belief was true are successful, then shared understanding can be said to exist for all practical purposes for the human (though not necessarily for an observer, let alone the dog).7 Thus, a belief in shared understanding becomes true for humans if it stands up to the test of their experience (Dewey 1911). The human witnesses the dog's signals, gestures, eye contact, attunement of behavior to the situation, and infers that the dog defines situations in at least some of the ways that humans do. Many human-animal scholars of a symbolic interactionist bent actually echo the pragmatist perspective on this point,8 but they tend to move from this insight in a different direction than I intend, typified by Irvine's (2004:2) claim that "animals have selves, too." Whether animals have selves or not, what is more relevant to sociologists - and more verifiable - is that humans often act toward animals as if they have selves, and in ways that overlap with how they act toward humans (see Cerulo 2009). Humans seldom, if ever, can remove themselves from an anthropocentric frame. As others have noted, this leads them to inherently anthropomorphize animals, and even objects (Cohen 1989). Yet "the other" is varied in the degree to which it can meet humans on their terms and enable an observable mutuality in interaction. Dogs appear to be capable enough that humans often infer a mutuality in understanding, even if asymmetrical work is involved to reach this state. Dog owners, often unreflex- ively, assume the "least human role" (Arluke and Sanders 1993:383), in which they try to take the perspective of their dog and imagine what would be enjoyable for it in order to enhance the association. They may even adopt animal-like gestures and sounds. Adults often do this with infants, as well as with the cognitively impaired (Goode 1994). When "alter" responds in ways that "ego" would expect given the assumptions ego makes about mutuality, personality, or what have you, this enhances the possibility for ego's realization of a playful encounter - and one in which ego believes that alter frames the encounter similarly. This implies that it is possible for humans to obtain similar goals and satisfactions in interactions with animals. Recalling Goffman's (1986:45) observation that play- fighting and "playing at checkers feels to be much the same sort of thing" because players might say that "the only thing really going on is play," a similar case can be made between human-human play and human-dog play. The substance of the encounters is quite different, but humans may engage in both because these forms quench an impulse toward association with others as an end in itself. Dogs appear to be "usable others" (Goffman 1986:43) for humans to play with. What is critical is that humans can frame and achieve a playful encounter with dogs whether dogs are "really" playing or not.9 Play often involves the projection of human qualities onto the animal, but there is an objective aspect that can be observed: the achievement of coordinated interaction that marks an associative episode. Importantly, while mutuality may also be in doubt among interacting humans as well, by using language humans can literally define the terms on which they interact 7 This point reflects the famous dictum of W. I. Thomas: "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences" (Thomas and Thomas 1928:571). 8 Arluke and Sanders (1996) state that whether dogs actually have "minds" is not central, and they point out that, for dog owners, assuming intersubjectivity "has the practical utility of allowing the construction of effective and mutually rewarding patterns of social interaction" (1996:81). yThe reverse may also be true. Goode (2006) describes a time when he was bored with fetch games but sustained them because his dog was engrossed. It may sometimes be the case that dogs can frame encounters as play, but that dogs enjoy them primarily as games (i.e., fetch) that the human merely enables, whereas the human enjoys the interaction based on the association with her dog.</page><page sequence="11">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 381 and set the stage for more elaborate playful encounters. One cannot ask a dog why it is bored, but one can certainly ask a person. Language can give us greater leverage for assuming mutuality, and enjoyment may be enhanced through greater assurance that one is sharing a definition of a playful situation with another. The (often ad nauseum) repetitiveness and the circumscribed play possibilities between humans and dogs (i.e., fetch games, chase games) stem from the limited ways with which interaction can be coordinated without language. One could say that the animal- other is an impoverished interactant, 10 limiting play possibilities compared to the potentiality of human-human play. But this suggests a variation in degree, not kind, regarding sociable play between humans and animals. With the emphasis by Goode (2006), Mechling (1989), and Mitchell and Thompson (1990) that attunement to the play situation and the other may be asym- metrical, involving uneven amounts of work and comprehension by various actors, it makes sense that "unequal" partners - linguistically, mentally, or otherwise - can co- ordinate interaction. Whether egalitarian play is ever possible even among humans is also at issue (Clough 1979). In human-dog play, even if humans cannot access animal minds, they often think and act as if they can. As shown, this enables or enhances certain play possibilities. However, must humans' ability to frame an encounter as play rely on an assumption of mutuality? What happens when ego interacts with an alter that she cannot or does not assume shares her definition of the situation? Such interactions are actually quite common. In observing the social life of pub- lic parks in Greenwich Village (Manhattan) as part of an ethnographic study on street interactions, I was struck by the variety of spontaneous associations that were produced. Alongside the idle banter of old friends or perfect strangers, or among humans playing with their dogs in dedicated spaces, I saw people feeding pigeons. Humans can actually engage in this mundane and seemingly simple act with vary- ing degrees of intensity. Some people feed pigeons while paying little attention to them, or feed them for short durations, but other people have "focused interac- tions" (Goffman 1963:24) where they become absorbed in the activity and engage in feeding for an extended period of time. In "unfocused" pigeon feeding, such as when a person occasionally tosses crumbs to a pigeon while focusing on something else such as conversations with peers, pigeons - while brought into interaction with humans - are often incorporated into a sociable exchange that is still largely carried out among humans. Significantly, in these instances pigeons may become a resource that can facilitate and/or enhance the association among humans in this space,11 but I am interested here in the ways that humans can, if they choose to, develop more absorbing and elaborate feeding routines. Many parks have their dedicated pigeon feeders, who come nearly every day with bread or seed especially for the birds. While many people who feed pigeons shuttle their attention back and forth between pigeons and other humans, or come to the park and then "discover" the pigeons, regular feeders come with the primary intention of feeding the birds. They engage in focused interactions, sometimes lengthy, with these animals. I frequently observed an elderly white woman named Anna who fed pigeons daily in Father Demo Square. There was a regularity and familiarity l0This term was suggested by one of the anonymous reviewers (see also Sanders 1999). nGoffman (1963:126) claims that dogs are a "classic bridging device" between strangers in public; and Robins et al. (1991), as well as Messent (1983), demonstrate the role of animals as "social facilitators." Conversely, Duneier and Molotch (1999) show how some of the black street vendors they study in Manhattan take advantage of this possibility to "entangle" passing white women in conversation that they seek to avoid.</page><page sequence="12">382 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY in her daily interactions with a flock of feral pigeons that I did not see between the birds and casual feeders. The pigeons displayed an elevated level of "trust" with her brought about by her regular routines of prolonged feeding. They appeared to recognize her, following her into the park, landing on her shoulder, and eating out of her hands. Upon talking to her, Anna claimed that the birds had different personalities. At least regarding distinct habits of actions among the birds, her claims were actually borne out. She was able to predict with accuracy which bird would pick a fight, and which one would try to take feed from her pockets. Regular feeders like Anna see something in the pigeons that most passersby miss. They can tell the pigeons apart so that they know that the same birds are showing up everyday. Yet their interactions with the pigeons go further than this. Based on an established routine, a relationship emerges. Anna's feeding habits have fostered a history with the birds that opens up more interactive possibilities with the pigeons than is possible for more casual feeders; she and the pigeons share mutually con- structed routines (cf. Fine 1981; Mechling 1989; Sanders 2003). Even if she may be partially motivated to feed the pigeons so that they do not starve, this motivation at most serves as a baseline that brings them together. Out of the possibly purposive action of feeding springs engrossing interactions with far more elaborated structures than what which occurs with unfocused feeding. Anna could simply dump the food and leave the park if she did not seek the association as an end in itself. Yet she selects "a crooked line to the end" (Miller 1973:93), "inefficiently" feeding the birds by limiting the amount of food given at one time in order to prolong and expand the parameters of the encounter as an end in itself. Regular pigeon feeders can do more different things with the pigeons than casual feeders, forming associations with greater interactive depth and breadth. Pigeons sometimes emerge as individuals, the pigeons land on shoulders and eat out of hands, and so forth. Humans experiment with different actions to see what they can "get away with" and still keep the pigeons involved in the encounter. The pigeons and humans are both more attuned to the actions of the other(s) based on prior history and prolonged interactions than what occurs in unfocused feeding. One example is that, when Anna lifts her leg, the pigeons do not scurry away the way they do when casual feeders make a similar sudden or unexpected move. The essential element of such focused feeding is that pigeons are the "main involvement" (Goffman 1963: 56) for humans, who become absorbed in these focused interactions. One common feature of focused feeding is that it is most likely to occur when a human is alone. While it is still common with pairs, any number more than two associated people tend to lead to sporadic and relatively unabsorbed involvement with the pigeons. For some people, then, interacting with pigeons fulfills an "impulse" for associ- ation, even if it may be more limited than association with dogs or humans. Even pigeons have the potential to become "usable others" (Goffman 1986:43) for a human seeking playful association. Mitchell and Thompson's (1990) notion of "projects" is a useful gloss for the bundle of orientations or intentions that an actor in a setting uses to guide action. Pigeons - and most animals - appear to have intentionality, even if it is "intentionality-in-action" (Goode 2006:84) and not meditative (Porpora 1980; Taylor 1964). As argued above, as long as actors' lines of action are compatible, so that one's actions toward achieving her project serve as a foundation for the other to achieve his project, interaction is possible and can be interpreted as "successful." Yet students of interaction - even human-animal interaction - generally focus on cases in which, even if shared meaning does not exist, people think it does. The mundane</page><page sequence="13">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 383 example of pigeon feeding draws out the implications for asymmetrical meanings and intentions among actors when one may not assume that another shares her meanings. The behaviors of street pigeons indicate that they have a persistent goal of ob- taining food, and they seek out situations in which they can obtain it. This is how humans find pigeons in the park, invariably lurking, appearing to wait for someone to toss some food on the ground. People in the park could have any number of projects, but some of them encounter the pigeons in this setting and begin feeding them. This may be an example of two purposive projects - pigeons want to eat, and maybe humans want to help nourish these birds. In cases of focused feeding, how- ever, the person centers her attention on the activity. Often, she seeks to elaborate on the interactive possibilities and thus has a more durable encounter. Her project has ceased to be about "just" feeding the birds. Out of this purposive project have risen additional actions aimed at obtaining association and reciprocal interactions with these creatures. Though these encounters follow one basic structure, feeding, humans perform this task with an inefficient, "galumphing" quality (Miller 1973) in which they experiment with varying motifs in order to enjoy the flow of the encounter.12 Interaction takes on an ordered, routinized form. Yet humans can use the feeding routine as a resource on which to elaborate and improvise, reminiscent of how sociable talk "consists of the elaboration of a conversational resource" (Watson and Potter 1962). Because pigeons - like most animals - are capable of action that is independent of direct human manipulation (Owens 2007), their actions can also add an enjoyable spice of uncertainty for humans. To the extent that we think we share intersubjectivity, we become (at least some- what) aware of the mental states of others and are forced to ponder them. Yet we have no clear access to a pigeon's "mind," and few people seem to try or assume that we can, the way that many guardians do with their dogs. In this way, even while we may know that pigeons in the park want to eat when they approach us, we can totally disregard their mental states - even as we rely on them to build reciprocal interactions - and simply have fun in feeding them. However, "successful" pigeon feeding relies on some amount of monitoring of pigeon habits (i.e., if you walk after pigeons while tossing food, they will still run away). Dedicated feeders can obtain enhanced satisfaction in the association itself, and their repeated experiences over time result in an increased mutual attunement between humans and pigeons that allow for more elaborated structures of interaction (i.e., the pigeons are no longer afraid when the feeder comes near, and sometimes they are quick to eat from her hand or stand on her knee; one may distinguish pigeon "personalities"). There is, then, work involved in achieving engrossing interactions with pigeons. Compared to dogs, there are less possible structures of interaction, less elaboration, and less possible motifs. There does not appear to be any clear-cut cases of eye contact or hints of mutuality such as the play signals that dogs can send. However, in form focused pigeon feeding still reflects an achieved playful project by the human. Feeding pigeons has the potential to be experienced as play by humans, regardless of how the interaction is experienced by the pigeons, because the "projects" or intentions of the two species are compatible with each other - at this moment in this setting - even as those projects have entirely different aims. 12 It is likely that some humans also gain some pleasure in the power to direct the behavior of the birds (Myers 1998), yet this sort of benign power may be inextricable from any play context (Tuan 1984), and Goffman (1961b) and Simmel (1949) wind up agreeing that play may never be a purely bracketed form.</page><page sequence="14">384 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY However different its intentions, the pigeon still confronts the person as an active agent, a "thou" (Buber 1970), "a truly subjective other whose immediate presence is compelling" (Myers 1998:64). The pigeon can initiate and reciprocate action in a number of ways that are neither predetermined nor entirely under the control of humans (Owens 2007). Thus we can detect an "ineffable sense of aliveness" when interacting with the pigeon (Myers 1998:82). As in the case of dog play, even if humans project anthropomorphic traits onto the birds, a third observer could objectively witness reciprocal, coordinated interaction. While humans may of course play with objects, human-animal interactions provide opportunities for playful associations in which interaction is real - that is, reciprocal. Humans do not normally phenomenologically experience objects as a "thou." Nor do objects have intentionality in the way that live beings do. While humans may project these qualities onto objects, there would be no objective evidence of reciprocation. It appears that, for strips of activity to be framed as playful association by humans, actors must at least be able to mutually orient to portions of the common life-world in such a way that they can interact for some duration (Schutz 1974). 13 Simmel says that even in the midst of instrumental associations, there is often an "impulse" to enhance them, to create moments of sheer satisfaction by association. Sociable playfulness grows out of the topsoil of purposive action. In the same way, we see that even if one feeds pigeons for the purpose of providing nourishment, from here may grow an "impulse" to elaborate on this here-and-now interaction by introducing interactive structures for no other purpose than to enjoy the association. It is this "impulse" to associate as an end in itself, and the fact that the animal brings something out of the person that enables both of them to accomplish structures of interaction together, that enables the human to frame the encounter as sociable play. SPECIFYING AND CONTEXTUALIZING PLAY In conceptualizing sociable play in the way I have prescribed, we are interested in: (1) how a person enacts and interprets coordinated lines of action as play even without "proof that this understanding is shared with other members in interaction; (2) the limits and variations of play; (3) how levels of intersubjectivity impact the structure and experience of play and its interactive depth; and (4) the role of other contextual features in enabling play. Aside from the species of interactants, other situational aspects affect the observ- able levels of intersubjectivity and interactive depth in play. Here, I sketch some of the most important conditions. I only consider possibilities where a human is one of the actors. (1) Species of the actor; and mental capacity.14 This is the central variable of this article. Human-human play offers the most playful opportunities, but that does not mean that a human always obtains a higher degree of playfulness with humans than with other animals. This depends on the other variables below. Mental capabilities are key - deaf/blind, autistic, and other mentally impaired 13 However, I recognize that increasingly complex technology may make it possible for some objects to be experienced as a subjective other by some humans (Suchman 2006; Turkle 2006). And objects certainly guide and constrain interactions (cf. Latour 1988, 1996). lam only considering the mental fitness of humans here.</page><page sequence="15">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 385 humans may require alternate avenues to play or may not be able to partake in it (Goode 1994; Hendriks 1998). (2) The personal biography of the actor. I use "biography" loosely. By this I mean one's personal history and also demographics, which structure how the actor interprets and responds to others, including animals. For example, those who have had prior positive experiences with animals will be more likely to seek interactions and play with a variety of animals (Irvine 2004:67), while some will never open themselves to play with any animal. Similarly, some animals are more tame or "friendly" than others. (3) Relationship of the actors. Are they strangers or intimates? Are they thrust together out of necessity or do they voluntarily associate? What are the "social" positions, or roles, of the actors? For example, the animals that we eat are generally not the ones that we take as companions; and good friends can develop highly satisfying and elaborate play routines based on their extensive interactional history and comfort level. (4) Space. What is the physical distance between the actors? While, among humans, distance can be partially mitigated by communication technologies, play is heavily reliant on close proximity (usually "face to face"). Thus, zoo animals may feel quite distant, though so close to us, due to the bars that separate (also because of the relationship of the actors and place); intelligent sea animals may be unavailable for play for the same reasons (whether deep underwater or up close but behind glass). (5) Place. Where are the interactions occurring - home, office, on the street? "Third places" (Oldenburg and Brissett 1982; cf. Gieryn 2000) promote so- ciable play while "total institutions" (Goffman 1961a) repress it. Dog runs promote human-dog play more than sidewalks. (6) Time. How long do episodes of play last? Are they interrupted? The most complex cases of sociable play are indicated by highly elaborate and stylized play structures, with numerous possibilities for continually inventing motifs. It is likely that this depth relies on actors' assumption, and evidence, of symbolic interaction. Thus, while some of the specifics of human-dog play are unique, it appears that human-human sociability may potentially enact most of the play structures available in human-dog play as well as a host of new and more complicated structures that are enabled by language. Language allows us to explicitly check with others to ensure that "this is play" (though they may lie), and we may formulate encounters based around gestures and word play such as jokes, puns, and irony. Low levels of sociable play have a very limited number of play structures and motifs that are often repetitive. There may be very little intersubjectivity, but there must be enough for the interacting parties to be able to orient to portions of the common life-world in such a way that they can interact for some duration. Here, variables such as place, space, and biography of the (usually) animal-other take on a more crucial role. Below this level, sociable play has no chance of emerging for the human because "face to face" interaction of any duration is not possible. Medium levels of play likely entail enough assumed intersubjectivity that it may at least appear to ego that both actors have a similar orientation to a setting, objects, and each other. This conceptualization helps organize the variety of human-animal play and demonstrates the relationship between human-human and human-animal play. For example, it may not always be the case that human-human play is more enjoyable or "deeper" than human-animal play, for there may be a case of two strangers trying</page><page sequence="16">386 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY to make a go of mutuality that falls flat while a human-dog dyad that shares an extended play history easily absorbs the human into engrossing play structures. High levels of intersubjectivity, which can facilitate enjoyable association, may be possible but not realized in every encounter. On average, it seems that a greater potential for intersubjectivity leads to greater enjoyment and interactive depth in play. But the fact that this need not always be the case draws attention to other situational factors. We should not assume the level of sociable play without examining how these situational factors combine in any specific interactional context. For example, a primate may be available for high levels of interactive depth if in the company of a human caretaker, with whom it has a shared history, in an environment comfortable for both actors. A primate in a zoo, however, may offer little opportunities for sociable play with zoo visitors who are "strangers" on the other side of the bars. One important thing that increased potential for intersubjectivity might enable is the possibility that the play frame can be more equitably shared by interactants. For example, there is little reason to conclude by their behavior that pigeons are playing when eating the crumbs tossed at them by smiling humans; there is more evidence that dogs are playing when they bring a stick to humans for "fetch," and two friends exchanging quick, witty, and jocular insults appear highly attuned to the definition of the encounter they are constructing. We can speculate about the limits of humans' ability to achieve sociable play with animals by thinking through encounters with animals like a pet goldfish. Goldfish do respond to motion, and it is possible to teach goldfish over time - through condition- ing using food - to follow one's hand movements in front of an aquarium. Though some people may perceive different behavioral traits between different fish, it does not seem to open up any further interactive possibilities - even over time - beyond training goldfish to respond with motion to our own movements. Interactions with the goldfish seem less likely to be engrossing to humans, either difficult to initiate or quickly drifting to boredom. Thus, although goldfish can respond in some ways to movement and food, it does not appear that from this one can build more elaborate interactive structures over time. This seems due to the spatial dimension - the fish are under water, behind glass - and an even lower level of potential intersubjectivity toward objects in the life-world between humans and goldfish. Sociable play seems to be a largely absent possibility for humans in such interactions, even though we may see the seeds of its possibility - realized in interactions with more "complex" animals - through the goldfishes' ability to respond to human motion and in the potential for some people to read varying goldfishes' behavior as some evidence for "personalities." CONCLUSION I have argued that many varieties of human-animal play can be forged by the same Simmelian "impulse," on the part of human actors, to "lose themselves" in these noninstrumental associations. Studies of human-dog play demonstrate that language is not a prerequisite for coordinated playful encounters (Irvine 2001, 2004); and by way of the "con artist," Goffman (1986) shows that what one actor frames as play may be a very serious encounter for another. Furthermore, ethnomethodologists (Garfinkel 1967; Goode 2006) have demonstrated that high levels of intersubjectivity may be neither verifiable nor required for orderly interaction (see also Faulkner and Becker 2009). This article has interrogated the implication of these findings for human-animal sociable play and play among humans. It posits that the complexity</page><page sequence="17">HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND PLAY 387 of sociable encounters and the satisfaction obtained by one or more participants in them vary along a continuum depending on the level of intersubjectivity that is possible between actors, among other situational factors that have been mentioned such as a prior relationship history. Egos can frame an encounter as play with "usable" alters who may have other intentions, and the outcome of this framing for ego is the achievement of playful association. Such asymmetrical interactions can be especially relevant to understanding interactions among humans that may vary greatly by dimensions such as culture or cognitive ability, such as the disabled and children (see Goode 1994). Sociable play - if understood as a frame that organizes an encounter, for actors who adopt it, so that actors are oriented to select actions that promote the enjoy- ment of the association - can be achieved by humans even without the assumption of intersubjectivity. However, it may be enhanced by increased potential for intersub- jectivity or the assumption of intersubjectivity. For example, humans often assume that their companion dogs share the play frame, and this assumption is put to use pragmatically and is reinforced based on the successful mutual construction and elaboration of play structures and one's ability to predict the dog's project through its embodied action. With dogs, in which there is significant evidence of communi- cation and attunement with humans, new sociable worlds are opened up of greater depth and breadth when compared to animals like pigeons. When we can develop an intimate and prolonged shared history, it ensures that familiar expectations and affective ties will strengthen our desire to seek out playful encounters merely for the sake of association. Animals like pigeons appear to have more limited (or inaccessible) projects, and humans are less likely to assume that they are sharing a definition of the situation with them. This further circumscribes the potential depth and breadth of sociable play for humans. Yet the actions undertaken by a human feeding pigeons can follow some variation of playful association, even if pigeons are engaged in more purposive behavior and do not share in the play frame. Even within the limits of an activity like pigeon feeding, there is the possibility to expand relatively extensively on one basic interactive structure and thus find oneself deeply engrossed in an encounter as an end in itself. However, "simpler" animals severely limit the contours of sociable play for humans: there will be less available structures of interaction that may be jointly elaborated upon, which may in turn reduce the duration of the encounter as it drifts to boredom. Sociable play is not symmetrically distributed or equally complex across the spec- trum of interactants, but the key is the interconnectedness of the various embodi- ments of this social form. Seeking company as a timeout from my writing, I may play with my cat; other times, I seek conversation with my neighbor; but I may even go to the park and find myself feeding pigeons. Though different, on a general level each encounter offers opportunities for playful association, allowing me to dissolve my solitariness into "togetherness, a union with others" (Simmel 1949:255), and my seeking of each encounter finds its roots in a common impulse.
