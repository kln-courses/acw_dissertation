<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Partnership:  The Horse-Rider Relationship in Eventing  Audrey Wipper  University of Waterloo  This article examines the dimensions of a partnership in the sport of  eventing. Riders use the term “partnership“ to describe the kind of rela-  tionship they strive for with their horses. Compatibility as well as mutual  respect, trust, confidence, and close communication are all essential  components. Although the focus is on the processes involved in build-  ing partnerships, theit weakening and/or breakdown is, to a lesser  extent, explored since the opposite processes are involved. The devel-  opment of a partnership with one particular horse over a three-year  period is also examined.  The former world champion, Lucinda Green, known as the First Lady of eventing,  sums up what eventing, a comprehensive test of horsemanship, means to her: “If it  was all about winning then probably I would not enjoy it. Luckily for us at home,  it is about building partnerships with animals. . . . I have always known my limita-  tions and realised that any success Be Fair [her horse] and I had was due to his  unique ability and the firm partnership we had formed together” (Green 198533;  Green 1986:70).’ The three-time Badminton (considered the world’s premier three-  day event) winner, Sheila Willcox, discussed training: “I do not want an automaton  but a confident, free-striding and happy horse with whom I can communicate and  merge into aperfect partnership,” (Willcox 1974:17).2  The term these riders use is “partnership.” It denotes the kind of relationship they  strive for with their horses. This article explores what event riders mean by partner-  ship. What do they consider to be the key elements in a good partnership? In ex-  ploring the processes involved in the development and maintenance of a human-horse  partnership, my focus will be on building partnerships; their weakening or breakdown  will, to a lesser extent, be addressed, since opposite processes are involved.  This human-horse relationship will be discussed from the perspective of those  active in eventing, although the perspectives of those involved in other horse sports  also will be included when appropriate. I use their language and terminology. They  Direct all correspondence to Audrey Wipper, 8-250 Kingswood Drive, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada N2E  2K2.

Their statements provide insights into how they interpret their  relations with horses. Particular attention will be paid to accomplished riders and  trainers.Their profound understanding of the horse and what makes it tick has been  confirmed by their competitive successes.  There are, of course, many different kinds of horse-human partnerships. They  can be based on kindness and sympathy, where both help each other, or force and  fear, although eventers would not consider the latter a partnership. They can range  from authoritarian to egalitarian. In the former, one partner makes all the decisions  and completely dominates the other, whereas in the latter, decisions are shared and  give-and-take mutual. The rider obviously makes crucial decisions such as selecting  the course to be jumped and the test to be ridden. The rider regulates the speed, the  gait, and the direction but depends on the horse to jump the obstacles, and the horse  must want to jump them cleanly. Hence we have complementarity in which each de-  pends on the other in a different way to accomplish a shared task. To quote one of  jumping’s greats, David Broome, on this cooperative effort: “On arriving some-  where in the approximate area of take-off, I let the horse take command and jump  the fence. I try to be an uninterfering passenger from there to the other side, and  then I take up command again” (1984). Trainers noted that the legendary Secretar-  iat, winner of the 1973 Kentucky Derby, would refuse to give his all unless permit-  ted to do it his way-to use his burst of speed early or late in the race, as he chose  (Masson and McCarthy 199511 9). William Steinkraus, 1968 Olympic gold medal-  ist and chairman emeritus of the U.S. equestrian team, puts it this way: “It’s not  just one athlete, it’s two athletes and a combination of personalities, a combina-  tion of physical skills, and a combination of minds. So that distinguishes it very  much from other sports” (video, The Sporting Horse: Show Jumping, produced by  Revel Guest).  In all horse competitions, the human-horse partnership is important because it is  not only the person’s performance that counts but also the horse’s. At the most  advanced levels, where riders are exceptionally talented, the horse’s perfor-  mance may well be uppermost. On the huge scoreboards at the Badminton and  Burghley events, the horse’s name appears first in letters twice the size of those  used for the rider.  A related concept is bonding. The trainer Richard Shrake advises his clients:  “The first step . , . is to make sure that you create a strong trusting bond with your  horse. . . . This confidence is built up through patience, kindness, feel sensitivity, re-  spect and trust, never through force or fear” (English Rider,August 18,1996, p. 18).  Bonding is certainly part of building a partnership. But bonding is a more inclusive  term, for it can occur between a farmer and a foal or an autistic child and her cat,  relationships in which there is no specific goal to be achieved on the part of the per-  son involved. Riders use both terms, but competitors talk particularly about part-  nerships that entail teamwork to reach a goal that requires the efforts of both  human and horse.  </page> <page sequence="3"> The Horse-Rider Relationship 49  THE CONTEXT  Eventing is the equestrian version of the modern triathlon. It consists of three tests,  basic dressage, show jumping, and, most important (i.e., it receives the highest weight  in scoring), a cross-country gallop that involves “natural obstacles’’ such as ditches,  stone walls, hedges, banks, and water. (When a horse hits fixed objects those objects do  not come down like the rails in show jumping, which makes these obstacles more dan-  gerous.) The winner is the pair with the lowest score, decided by adding the penalty  points from the three tests. In one-day events all three tests take place on one day;  three-day events include a steeplechase and about nine miles of roadwork in addition  to the three tests. (At the highest level, because of the number of entries in the dres-  sage test, three-day events usually occur over the course of four days. The dressage test  requires a very fit horse to perform a series of prescribed movements quietly, accu-  rately, and gracefully in a small area to demonstrate its obedience and suppleness. A  well-performed test displays harmony between horse and rider.) At its most advanced  level, the three-day event is the world’s most gruelling test of all-around horsemanship.  Originally eventing served as a trial for cavalry mounts; hence horses needed to be  agile, fast, bold, and capable of galloping across any terrain. It can be traced back to  the various exercises cavalries used to improve the fitness of their horses and to the  contests they staged to test the results. Although it has been part of the Olympics  since 1912, it was the prerogative of cavalry officers up until World War 11. With the  demise of the cavalry after the war, male civilians took up the sport; women were not  permitted to compete in Olympic eventing until 1964. But horses, oblivious to sexist  stereotypes, simply go best for whomever trains and rides them best. This led to the  incongruity that some of the best horses that won on home territory with women  aboard were not given a berth on Olympic teams unless loaned to a male counter-  part. Today men and women compete on an equal basis in all horse disciplines.  Compared to thoroughbred racing or show jumping, there is little prize money  involved in eventing except at the highest level-and until recently not even there.  The 1998 Badminton winner received 26,000 pounds, the most ever and two and a  half times more than that of any other international competition. At lower levels  winners are awarded ribbons and perhaps a small prize. With little money at stake,  eventing has, at least up to now (1999), been free from scandal, remaining more a  sport for amateurs than a business, except at the most advanced level. It appeals to  middle-class people because one does not need an expensive conformation horse. A  horse is judged on its performance and not on its looks. “Eventer” refers to either the  rider or the horse. An event horse is of no particular breed, but at the highest levels  many are thoroughbreds because of the speed and tenacity demanded on the cross-  country course. The terms “event” and “horse trials” denote the competitions.  LITERATURE AND THEORETICAL ORIENTATION  Various horse subcultures-thoroughbreds (Case 1987; Rosencrance 1985; Scott  1968), saddlebreds (Clatworthy 1981), harness horses (Fetterly 1976; Helmer 1991),  </page> <page sequence="4"> 50 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1, 2000  jumpers (Deem 1969), and foxhunters (Aversa 1981)-have been explored by so-  cial scientists, but eventers have not been a subject of investigation. While the horse  is obviously central to all horse subcultures, values, norms, and practices vary enor-  mously within them. None of these studies deals in any depth with the horse-rider  relationship.  In contrast to sociological literature, which in the past largely ignored human-  animal relationships, a nonacademic literature goes back to Xenophon, who wrote the  earliest known treatise on horses, ca. 400 B.c., that deals with their emotions, minds,  temperament, and ways of communicating (Xenophon [1894] 1962; see also Ainslie  and Ledbetter 1980; Museler 1937; Rees 1984; Smyth 1974; Williams 1956). There is  also a long literary tradition. Nineteenth-century English and Irish sporting novel-  ists wrote copiously about horses’ characters, endowing them with human strengths  and frailties (Somerville and Ross 1984; Surtees 1981;W hyte-Melville 1984). Con-  temporary American novelists have noted the horse-human bond. A Texan who  grew up with horses says that he doubts if he has ever known a cowboy who liked  women as well as he liked horses and suggests a “sacramental relationship between  man and horse,” a deep bonding he calls “mateship” (McMurtry 1968:27,72,145).  Why have sociologists paid so little attention to the horse-human relationship?  Obviously it is important to animal trainers, veterinarians, farriers, and chiroprac-  tors and massage therapists who treat horses. Horses that must be tranquillized  in order to be shod or have their teeth filed are a nuisance and an expense. Ever  try to catch a horse in a field? It’s far less time-consuming to have it respond to  your call. To pull a horse’s mane, clean its sheath, or muck out a stall when you  fear getting kicked or bitten is not pleasant. Although the above work does not  require anything like a partnership or bonding, it does require some aspects of  this relationship.  One reason for the lack of academic literature on the horse-human relationship  may be that traditionally sociologists, particularly symbolic interactionists, have  made a rigid distinction between human and nonhuman interaction, assuming that  meaningful interaction necessitates role-playing, self-consciousness, and language.  Because animal interaction was seen to lack these, it was not considered worthy of  study. As a teaching assistant for Herbert Blumer, it was drilled into me that ani-  mals could not make indications to themselves, could not take the role of the other,  and lacked collective symbols; therefore, the logic went, they did not have selves  and minds. Although I did wonder how he could be so sure, being a diffident Cana-  dian, I never challenged him. By excluding human-animal interaction, the sociolog-  ical eye has excluded an important aspect of people’s lives-their relationships with  domestic animals.  Another reason may be a fear of being anthropomorphic. One will notice that  horse people use language that could be called highly anthropomorphic. Horses are  described as honest, kind, devious, arrogant, quitters, and real gentlemen. Unlike  eccentric, sentimental animal lovers who endow their pets with all kinds of human  qualities for which evidence is lacking, even dressing them up in our attire, I am re-  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Horse-Rider Relationship 51  ferring to accomplished horse people who use this mode of discourse to convey spe-  cific meanings. For instance, Mark Todd, two-time Olympic gold medalist, differen-  tiates between horses that are “courageous” and those that are “chicken,” an  important distinction for jumpers.  I once had a novice horse that was always hesitant at ditches, and although we  schooled and schooled and schooled him, it made no difference. He managed  the fences at novice level, but I knew that he was not going to make the grade  because he was simply not brave enough.  Horses do need to be brave. Charisma [his Olympic mount], for example, was  an exceptionally courageous horse. He received a tremendous ducking in the  water at the World Championships at Gawler, yet without being schooled at  water before his next event at Luhmuhlen, he jumped straight into two big water  fences there without a moment’s hesitation. That is the difference between a  brave horse and one who lacks courage. (Todd 1995:47-48)  Although laypeople may prefer a different interpretation, Todd’s explanation makes  sense to horse people.  The absence of research on the animal-human relationship has been challenged  by Arluke and Sanders (1996; Sanders 1993,1990) whose groundbreaking work has  helped to bring animals into the realm of research respectability. They argue that  (1) human-animal interaction needs to be studied at the level of observable mutual  interaction; (2) researchers should attempt to take the role of animals in order to bet-  ter understand them; and (3) the line separating nonhuman and human interaction  has been too sharply drawn and sociology should move away from its anthropocen-  tric focus to include nonhuman animals in its purview.Their stand fits in with the ap-  proach of animal trainers, many ethologists, and others who work closely over long  periods with animals and who typically portray animals as self-aware, emotional,  empathetic, communicative, and minded (Goodall 1988; Hearne 1986a, 1986b).  The animal trainer Vicki Hearne (1986b) decries the different universes of dis-  course between animal trainers and academics. In a philosophical essay she rejects  the rigid division that restricts the possession of a soul, a mind, a self, emotions, and  thinking to Homo supiens. She examines several horse-rider relationships, espe-  cially one with a mare many thought was crazy. Drummer Girl, a thoroughbred  from the racetrack, arrived at Hearne’s confused, distrustful, and nervous-a com-  mon state of track horses. Although she had jumping potential, she rushed to her  fences. Hearne worked with her to develop a “thinking” rather than her panicky ap-  proach and succeeded:  Soon she started, with no advice from me, to come in with that thrillingly round  canter-full collection at canter-which eliminated gravity. She achieved on her  own-in the course of solving for herself the problem of dealing with the fact  that she must stop after the fence.. . . I had heartlessly set things up so that if she  was capable of any sort of reasoning at all she must slow down and canter prop-  erly. (1986b:48)  Hearne portrays Drummer Girl as possessing a mind that figures things out, but it is  </page> <page sequence="6"> 52 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1, 2000  Hearne who arranged the setting so that the mare adopted a “thinking” approach.  Hearne could do this because she had an understanding of Drummer Girl’s per-  spective, probably learned by empathizing, trying to take the mare’s role.  Horse people believe that only a happy horse, a horse in high spirits, will perform  at its best. “Another [key to success] lies in the horse’s disposition. It is imperative  that he is happy and enjoying every minute of his life if he is to give his best when the  big day dawns” (Green 198658).T his belief leads eventers to try to please horses, be  it in their riding, feeding, training, or  tabl ling.^ One eventer turns her horse out at  night, rather than during the day, in the summer, because it is cooler then.  Lockie lives out at night; he socializes with his pony Boomer, rolls in puddles,  and gets dirty. Doing those things is part of why he’s happy and sound. So are  hacking in a hackamore [bitless bridle] and stopping to eat grass and roll in the  pond, or eating peppermints in the barn. I try to let him be a horse and have his  life. (Practical Horseman, December 1995,p . 70)  The above illustrates an attempt to sympathetically understand a horse, to see the  world through its eyes.  This sensitivity is part of the eventing subculture. Instructors admonish their stu-  dents to play at being a horse and to form a mental connection with the horse. A  trainer emphasized, “The best horsemen think like a horse. They exemplify this in  ail their activities around horses” (field notes). An accolade bestowed on those who  demonstrate a deep understanding of horses is “[Soa nd so] is part horse.”  Charles de Kunffy, a former member of the Hungarian Olympic team and an in-  ternationally recognized coach, articulates this perspective well:  To experience his word [sic, “world”] sympathetically is the first and foremost  principle of the upbringing of a horse. We must consciously adopt an attitude of  empathy towards the horse. We should try to experience the world (including  ourselves) through his senses as if through his thinking. This attitude presumes  not only a willingness to comply and eagerness to play at “being a horse” but also  a solid academic knowledge of the horse’s nature. . . . Riding, because it is based  on communication between two living organisms, must include not only taking  [sic, “talking”] by the rider but even more important “listening.” The awareness  of the horse’s mental and physical state indeed, should determine what and how  much the rider may ask of his mount. Therefore the truly talented riders are la-  belled as having “feel,” which is another term describing being a living antenna  that picks up all communications that the horse sends. The magic of perceptive-  ness, awareness, supplemented by intelligence, compassion and empathy by the  rider, can induce him to proper actions, aiding and communications towards his  horse. . . .A  noisy coach and one that dictates perpetually every move, produces  riders that are incapable of tuning in with their horses. . . .The results may be di-  sastrous. . . . In the process the horse and his communications are sacrificed, the  pleasure of riding unknown. Indeed, the intoxication of riding is not in the pro-  cess of aiding or the process of talking to the horse, but rather in the thrill of  monitoring his (hopefully) pleasant communications.  Not only need a rider be always and fully aware of the horse’s well-being and  his communications, but he must react to them with knowledge and insight.  Knowledge comes both by practice (riding) and by coaching; reading, watching  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Horse-Rider Relationship 53  and discussing. More important, however, is the insight and wisdom gained by  empathy towards the horse. Empathy, putting it simply, is the ability to put one-  self into the position of another. To step into the other’s shoes (horse shoes?), to  leave one’s own ego and enter that of another. Putting it another way, think horse!  What do you think he experiences when you ride him? (1984:38-39,146-47; see  also Hayman 1994, on how to learn to take the role of the horse)  de Kunffy’s ideas about gaining an understanding of the horse resonate with  those of Cooley and Mead about gaining an understanding of the world. Cooley  (1902:102-35) advocates understanding social life via sympathy and communion. In  discussing communication, he defines sympathy as “in the sense of primary commu-  nication or an entering into and sharing the mind of someone else” and “the sharing  of any mental state that can be communicated” (p. 102).  Mead, too, uses the word sympathy:  The attitude that we characterize as that of sympathy in the adult springs from  this capacity to take the role of the other person with whom one is socially impli-  cated. . . . Sympathy always implies that one stimulates himself to his assistance  and consideration of others by taking in some degree the attitude of the person  whom one is assisting. The common term for this is “putting yourself in his  place.” (1934:366)  And Mead (1934:254-55) notes that this is a distinctly human attribute: “It [role-  taking] carries the process of co-operative activity farther than it can be carried in  the herd as such or in the insect society.”  The admonition “to take the role of the other” is fraught with problems, as it is a  process that is open to errors of judgment. No observer, regardless of how hard he  or she tries, can enter into another person’s mental experiences, let alone those of  a horse. Still, the best horse people attempt to do this and, in trying, achieve a bet-  ter understanding of horses’ perspectives and behaviors than those who make no  such effort.  Horses, however, do not take the role of riders and adjust their behavior to suit  them. For instance, Happy Fella, my horse, is known as smart and cooperative, but  he does not understand that he must align himself within two feet of the mounting  block to enable me to get on easily. He will stand three to four feet away or with his  head in and his rear out, which means I would have to vault into the saddle-and  this after seventeen years of being together.  Much horse behavior is based on instinctive reactions, the stimulus-response  couplet (see Mead 1934:13-14, 253-54, for conversation of gestures; see also  Blumer [1969] 1986%). The horse has evolved as a fear-flight animal, the hunted  rather than the hunter. Something startles it and its flight instinct takes over. This be-  havior, unlike most human interaction, does not leave room for interpretation.  People, in contrast, make and execute plans, change plans, and remodel their actions.  Horses do not understand significant symbols. Different color rosettes on their  browbands denoting first or second in a contest obviously have no meaning for  them. A vocal gesture becomes a-significant symbol when it calls out the same re-  </page> <page sequence="8"> 54 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23 ,  Number 1, 2000  sponse in the individual making it as it calls out in others. A horse does not consciously  communicate with itself by being able to call out in itself the same response that its  gesture calls out in another and then subsequently use the other’s response to con-  trol further conduct.When an individual does this he or she has reached the stage of  genuine language instead of unconscious communication. The individual has ac-  quired a mind, uses significant symbols, and does not merely respond to signs.  Horse people, nevertheless, do not see horses as mindless automatons. They talk  about horses having good minds and bad minds, being smart and dumb, making  good decisions and bad decisions. A good jumper has to be able to judge where to  take off and how much effort is required to clear an obstacle without crashing in the  middle or wasting time and energy with an unnecessarily high jump. Although  eventers do not see horses as analytical, they see them as being able to figure out how  to accomplish certain tasks when properly trained. Despite endowing horses with  minds, intelligence, and thinking, eventers do not use these concepts in the Meadian  sense (Mead 1934).They view the minds and thinking of horses and people as strik-  ingly different and believe that failure to recognize this difference leads people to  misunderstand horses.  METHODS  My fascination with horses began early. Our family home backed onto a riding and  driving club, which every year held a dazzling show that brought some of the best  horses on the North American continent. As children we played horse games-I  being the riding master since I was the eldest. My brother and cousins jumped ob-  stacles and pranced around imitating the various gaits while I judged the winners.  My actual experience with horses started when I was twelve (I am now professor  emerita). My girlfriends and I mucked out stalls and cleaned tack in exchange for  rides. We exercised those horses whose owners seldom rode. As we improved, we  were allowed to ride the more difficult horses and eventually show them in compe-  titions. Later I was a riding instructor at a summer camp and for years taught Pony-  Clubbers on weekends. In the 1950s I worked as a groom and exercise girl for six  months in two stables collecting data through participant observation for my mas-  ter’s thesis, “The Occupation of the Professional Rider.”  In the early 1980s I started to event, which was a new competition for me. Since  then I have competed in many events in addition to serving as a groom, jump judge,  and dressage steward. Owning, riding, and caring for horses has thoroughly famil-  iarized me with the shared meanings of this world. These experiences have provided  me with an informed basis for discriminating between the important and the unim-  portant, the durable and the ephemeral, and reinforced my belief in the importance  of “intimate familiarity” with one’s subject (Blumer [1969] 1986). (To be considered  an insider, owning a horse is almost a necessity, and owning a “good horse,” which  Happy Fella is, is a decided asset.)  I acknowledge Hughes’s “methodological agnosticism” (Rock 1979:20), or multi-  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Horse-Rider Rela tionship 55  method strategy using a variety of qualitative data, in this study. My primary  method of data gathering was through participant observation in natural settings  such as stables, horse shows, and training sessions. I began to systematically collect  more data in May 1981 when I wanted to event and began looking for a suitable  horse. The search took five months. Since I was traveling the countryside talking to  horse people, I decided it was an excellent opportunity to acquire data on buying  and selling. My field notes, in addition, focus on the day-to-day work and competi-  tions. Being around horse people almost daily, I participate in and overhear many  conversations-the barn manager talking to stable help, a veterinarian discussing a  problem with an owner, a coach instructing a pupil. I recorded in field nates totaling  more than two thousand single-spaced pages informal talks with fellow competitors,  owners, trainers, grooms, veterinarians, and farriers. My data collecting follows  Blumer’s ([1969] 1986:47) call for the “naturalistic inquiry . . . of human group life”  through the “direct examination of the empirical social world.”  I subscribe to a number of horse magazines and receive publications from orga-  nizations such as the Ontario Horse Trials Association and the Canadian Eques-  trian Association that deal with topical issues. I read widely, from classical treatises  to pamphlets advertising the latest horse gear. Books written by, or about, world-  class equestrians are of particular interest. I attend seminars and clinics on horses,  sometimes as participant, sometimes as auditor, often taping lectures and the ensu-  ing discussions.T wo- to four-day clinics offer an excellent opportunity to hear world-  class equestrians discuss training and critique individual rider-horse combinations. I  also taped television commentary, usually by current or former international riders,  on the Olympic Games, Grand Prix jumping, and other horse subjects. As a specta-  tor at the “Big B” (Badminton and Burghley, England) events, I noted the commen-  tators’ remarks. In addition, I taped informal telephone conversations to ensure that I  would have verbatim accounts (attributions of quotations used here, with permis-  sion, are pseudonyms).  DIMENSIONS OF AN EVENTING PARTNERSHIP  Compatibility  In exploring partnerships, we are dealing with two distinct beings, each with its  own mind, its own emotions, its own ways. Basic to any successful partnership is  compatibility. The horse and rider have to get alorfg. Legend has it that Bucephalus,  Alexander the Great’s warhorse, was unmanageable and disagreeable to all save his  master; for him, Bucephalus would kneel so that Alexander could more easily mount  (Mackay-Smith, Druesedow, and Ryder 1984:8). Certain horses and riders comple-  ment each other, whereas others do not. Some horses require a butterfly touch;  some eventers’ skills are not that refined. Some riders find coping with temperamen-  tal horses challenging; others find it irritating. Some riders like tough, dominant  horses; others like more pliant ones. Sayings such as “Timid riders need bold  </page> <page sequence="10"> 56 Symbolic interaction Volume 23, Number 1,2000  horses” and “Timid horses need bold riders” are commonplace. “Click” is a term  used to describe successful combinations. Heidi Robbiani won a bronze medal at  the 1984 Olympic show jumping competition with her mare, Jessica V: “She likes me  and I like her” (Horse Sport, October 1984, p. 24). Comments such as “We’re the best  of friends” and “We’re buddies” indicate such a closeness.  The importance of rapport between horse and rider has been documented again  and again. Stories of fabulous prices being paid for top horses that fail to perform  with their new riders are legend. Caroline Bradley formed a highly successful part-  nership with Tigre as a member of the world champion British team in 1978. How-  ever, in 1980, following a dispute with the horse’s co-owner, she did not ride Tigre.  As Horse Sport reported, “After that Tigre was never shown with quite the same  brilliance” (July 1983, p. 32). Outstanding partnerships are built on some kind of  unique alchemy, an alchemy not easily defined.  Lack of rapport leads to poor performances. A commentator at an eventing com-  petition noted, “The horse is not performing well. There needs to be more har-  mony between the rider and the horse” (field notes). A stable hand explained to  me why an owner was putting her horse up for sale: “She’s getting rid of Crosby,  they’re incompatible. He can really jump, but you’ve got to let him do it his way.  She doesn’t do that. She holds him in. She wants a controlled approach. He  doesn’t like that. If you point him at a jump and let him go, he’ll jump it.” I asked,  “How did they do at Collingwood [a horse show]?” He replied, “Terrible. He  didn’t do a thing.”  Coaches, knowing the abilities and personalities of both pupils and horses, try to  pair those that fit together. According to the trainer Jimmy Williams, “Matching a  rider to a horse is a little like getting married: some personalities just clash and  nothing will ever come from pairing them” (Practical Horseman, May 1995, p. 43).  Lorraine McDonald, a senior judge, spoke in the same vein: “Remember, your part-  ner your horse is like a marriage and not all marriages work out. Sometimes riders  have to find a more suitable partner.” She closed with a quotation from Xenophon:  “Horses should be trained in such a way that they not only love their riders, but  look forward to the time they are with them” (Horse Sport, July 1997, pp. 43-45).  Compatibility between horse and rider, then, is a two-way process: each has to  like the other. It not only involves two different personalities but two distinct phys-  ical beings whose performances have to complement each other. Since horses do  not take the role of the rider, it behooves riders to adapt to the horse, and riders  vary enormously in this skill.  Mutual Respect  Successful partnerships involve mutual respect: riders respect their mounts and  their mounts respect them, or act in ways that riders consider respectful. Joe Far-  gis, winner of two gold medals in show jumping at the 1984 Olympics, put it this  way: “You’re dealing with a living, breathing creature,which has a mind of its  </page> <page sequence="11"> The Horse- Rider Rela tionship 57  own” (Time, August 1988). Green refers to her horses as people and credits them  for her outstanding success. She praised her first horse, Be Fair, the 1973 Badmin-  ton winner:  A highly intelligent, very compact and athletic chestnut, Be Fair, was an excep-  tional person. . . . He managed to reach the heights despite me, surviving many  more jockey errors born of inexperience than the three horses which followed  him.Therein lies his exceptional quality.. . .I t is sufficient tribute to Be Fair that  the profound relationship we shared could never be repeated. (1985:17-18)  Regardless of how much the partnership idea is extolled, there is no doubt as to  who its senior member is. Horses should instantly and willingly obey the rider’s sig-  nals, answering every single request. If the dressage test requires a canter at marker  A, that is exactly where the horse must pick up the canter to get a good mark. Al-  though horses may be brilliant at the tasks asked of them, if they do not obey their  riders, they are not a safe ride and certainly will not win.  Outsiders to the horse world may say it is euphemistic to talk about a partner-  ship when what we really have is a dominant-submissive relationship. In one sense  that is true. The horse must carry out the rider’s directives, but knowledgeable  people from Xenophon ([1894] 1962:62-63) to present-day trainers agree that coer-  cion should not be involved. Hearne explains:  It is wrong to talk about coercion not only because that doesn’t happen to be  what’s going on in places like the Spanish Riding School, where horses are  trained to the highest pitch, but also because it cannot go on with the horses per-  forming at high levels: horses have souls, and there is an inexorable logic conse-  quent on that which makes coercing them into high performance impossible. I  don’t mean that you can’t coerce horses-only that if you do you will end up, if  you are lucky, with a dull, unenthusiastic mount or, if you are unlucky, with a  Drummer Girl emerging murderously from the trailer. (1 986b:43-44)4  Although riders give the signals (orders if you like), they depend on the horse’s  willingness to perform. Horses will not perform at their best unless they really want  to. Jim Elder, an Olympian and member of many Canadian international teams,  lectured: “If he doesn’t want to jump, there is no way you can make him do it. You  against a 1,200-pound horse don’t have a chance” (field notes).  Horses appear to take advantage of riders who do not demonstrate that they are  in charge. An instructor criticized a student whose horse refused a jump: “He  doesn’t respect you. Get after him” (field notes). When Ian Millar (show jumping  Hall-of-Famer) was away Grant Cashmore exercised Big Ben, Canada’s most fa-  mous jumper of all time. Cashmore described his first outing with Big Ben: “He’s a  horse who sizes you up quickly. The first time I rode him he wouldn’t trot for me. I  mean he would trot but it would take ten strides before he would do it. Once you  get his respect, he’s fine. He’s like a human. If he can get away with something, he  will” (Scanlon 1994138).  In riding, two living beings, ideally each respectful of the other, are linked in mu-  tual dependency. Green put it this-way: “It’s a paradox. The horse must be allowed  </page> <page sequence="12"> 58 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1,  2000  to think and sort things out for himself and at the same time the horse must be doing  what you want him to do” (Lucinda Green Clinic, June 6,1997).  Intimate Communication  Communication is a major component in a partnership. In order for horses and  riders to work as a team, they have to understand each other’s signals. Dorothy Wil-  lis, coach to world champion eventer Virginia Leng, lectured students: “Communi-  cation between horse and rider is everything, particularly for eventers because they  must be confident together and the horse must respect the rider.”  Horses obey riders’ signals because they have been trained to respond in a cer-  tain way to a certain signal. In turn, a rider must understand a horse’s signals. In ex-  amining this communication, we are dealing, in the main, with body language. The  ways in which a horse uses its body, particularly its ears, eyes, legs, and tail, indicate  needs, wishes, moods, and emotions (Bennett 1996; Budiansky 1997; Kilby 1991;  Reynolds 1995; Roberts 1997;T ellington-Jones 1995). In turn, a rider’s seat (a term  that refers to posture in the saddle, involving the back, shoulders, and buttocks),  legs, hands, voice, and smell send messages to horses. Communication, then, is a two-  way process: horses communicate to people, and people communicate to horses. We  will look at the body language of horses and people and how they read each other.  The Body Language of Horses  In the interest of brevity this discussion focuses on the ears and tail. Ears are a  barometer of a horse’s moods, its number one communicator. When interested in,  or surprised by, something, a horse will prick his ears forward-in fact, all his sen-  sory features will project toward the object. A horse with his ears flat back is often  angry and may be contemplating an aggressive act (of course, racehorses coming  down the homestretch have their ears back because laid-back ears cut down wind  resistance and are a sign of intense physical effort). Puzzlement or confusion about,  or attentiveness to, a rider’s instructions, is expressed by repeated flicks of the ears  back and forth as he asks for more, or for clearer, information. These motions are  often accompanied by an attempt to watch the rider by flexing his poll (the very top  of the neck).  The tail is also an excellent gauge of a horse’s feelings. When it is firmly clamped  down, the horse is either readying to attack or settling down to be stubborn. If she  lashes her tail violently, a mare is angry or in physical or mental distress. When the  tail is relaxed and carried a little away from her buttocks, she is relaxed also. When  it is carried up and away from her body, she is alert and curious, and when the tail is  held high, so are her spirits.  It would be wrong to put too much emphasis on the isolated gesture, for it is usu-  ally a combination of gestures, actions, and body positions that tells the story. A  horse pawing, peering at its flank, kicking, or biting its abdomen sends panic  </page> <page sequence="13"> The Horse-Rider Relationship 59  through the stable help because these actions suggest colic (abdominal pain), the  number one killer of domestic horses. Despite their sophisticated technical equip-  ment, veterinarians rely, to a large extent, on body language in making their first di-  agnosis. One glance at the stretched out appearance-stiff hind legs that look as if  they are bolted to the ground, rigid, cold rump muscles, and profuse sweating-and  the veterinarian pronounces, “He’s tied up” (the medical term is azoturia).  People Read Horses  Body language, vocalization, and habits tell people a great deal about a horse’s  physical and mental condition. Veteran riders need not rely on heart monitors or  pulse and respiratory rates to tell them how fit a horse is. They know a horse’s level  of fitness by looking at and riding the horse.  Monty Roberts, author of The Man Who Listens to Horses, as a thirteen-year-old  boy followed mustang herds in the Nevada desert observing their day-to-day inter-  action and how they communicated with each other and learning the silent lan-  guage he calls Equus. Roberts explained, “Equus is a rich language full of hundreds  of nuances. . . . It is a language of position, gesture, direction and body stance. . . .  Once the horse comes to you, there’s a magical moment called ‘join up’ when the  horse decides that it would rather be with you than away from you. That comes  through communication and trust” (Toronto Star, August 21,1997, p. A7).  Top riders, having ultrasensitive equine antennae, are so in tune with this lan-  guage that they can anticipate what a horse will do under certain circumstances. A  gesture indicating a potential line of action can be encouraged or discouraged be-  fore it is actually carried out. For instance, if a horse “sucks back” (momentarily  hesitates) when approaching a jump, the rider will “encourage” it with his whip  and legs, which send the clear message, don’t stop, keep moving forward. Neo-  phytes, on the other hand, may miss, confuse, or not respond quickly enough to  horses’ signals. Hence those who understand this language best communicate best  with horses.  The Body Language of People  Riders communicate their wishes to horses through their hands, legs, seat, voice,  whip, and spurs, and these are referred to as “aids.” To put it simply, horses learn at  the outset that a squeeze from the rider’s legs means to go forward and that a squeeze  accompanied by a braced back and a pull-release on the reins means to stop. The  voice is used to praise and to sanction, whips and spurs to drive her forward and to  punish. Gradually, through repetition, the horse learns to respond appropriately  to the directives.  Learning to apply the aids is a major part of riders’ training. Sensitive horses can  be upset by an aid applied too strongly, while a gentle aid may be ignored by a  young or headstrong horse. It was said of Steve Cauthen, the brilliant jockey, that  </page> <page sequence="14"> 60 Symbolic interaction Volume 23, Number 1, 2000  he had “wondrous” hands and that young, skittish horses became calm as soon as he  sat on their backs, the very opposite of a rider of whom it was said, “She’s got an  electric seat. She drives every horse she sits on crazy” (field notes).  Instructors criticize the poor use of aids: aids were absent when they should have  been present, were applied too harshly or too erratically, or were ambiguous. A  coach reprimanded a student during a jumping lesson, “You’re sitting there like a  passenger. You’ve got to encourage him. You sit there and he thinks, Oh, Sally doesn’t  care. Use your whip or your legs” (field notes). A judge commented on a dressage  performance, “She demands rather than asks” (Burghley Horse Trials, August 31,  1995). A coach advised a pupil, “You’d better have the points on your spurs re-  moved. Your legs are not steady enough. You’re upsetting the horse” (field  notes). After a student had taken several jumps, the instructor pointed out the  contradictory messages she was giving her horse: “NOWc ome here, Anne. Now  tell me what you did. Your legs were telling the horse to go, but you were holding  him back with the reins. Don’t jam him in the mouth” (Captain Mark Phillips’  Clinic, June 1987).  The more skilled the rider, the more subtle, precise, and consistent the directive.  Horses Read People  It is believed that horses are extremely sensitive to people’s moods, emotions,  voices, and smells and are masters at interpreting human body language. People  give off cues by their muscle reactions, the way they sit and use their reins, legs, and  voice. These apparently tell horses many things-whether riders are nervous or  confident, friendly or hostile, befuddled or in control. The muscle responses of a  skilled, confident rider relax and embolden horses, whereas tense, nervous riders  transmit fearful messages that make them nervous. (Fearful people also supposedly  give off an odor that horses pick up.) This sensitivity was noted by a commentator  during the dressage phase of the 1995 Burghley Horse Trials: “She’s a bit anxious,  which shows through the horse. If she’d relax, he’d relax.”  A horse who misbehaves with a student on board will follow the instructor’s di-  rectives within a matter of minutes. Sandy Hawley, Canada’s most accomplished  jockey, with 6,400 victories in his thirty-year career, spoke about the first time he  “breezed” a horse: “Horses can smell inexperience. The horse bolted around the  track and I couldn’t stop him” (“The Life and Times of Sandy Hawley,” CBC Tele-  vision, June 26,1997). Maxims support these observations: “A rider who is not cer-  tain of his or her desire to get to the other side of the fence will never be able to  convince a horse to do so”; “A nervous rider makes a nervous horse”; “Throw your  heart over the jump and the horse will follow.” MacGregor Jenkins (1984) agrees  with the above: “Never telegraph to your horse how you feel unless you want him  to feel the same. No creature is more sensitive to mood than a horse. He will at once  recognize fear or impatience on the part of his rider.”  According to some, horses are superior to people in detecting moods and feel-  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Horse- Rider Rela tionship 61  ings: “Horses read the moods of human beings more accurately than humans read  the moods of horses. Discouraged, dispirited stable hands make losers of winners.  Eager, happy, interested handlers emit a sense of pleasure and success to which  horses react positively” (Ainslie and Ledbetter 1980:191).  An eventer explained how horses pick up riders’ feelings:  EVENTER: I really don’t like riding with Mary. She never wants to do more  than walk or trot. How can I get Prince exercised that way? Of course Scotty  [her horse] senses it. He says, Well, if Mary’s afraid, there must be something  scary out there. So he tenses up and looks around for something. If she’d only  relax, he’d be OK. . . . She’s always worried about this or that. She’s always  worried about everything going on around her, always looking for a problem.  A dog is going to come out, or he’s going to see something that scares him.  She’s constantly looking for these things. And when you’re on him you’re not  looking for anything. You’re relaxed, so thank God.  INTERVIEWER. So he picks that up?  EVENTER: Umm, very much so.  INTERVIEWER: She’s sitting on him. How would he pick it up?  EVENTER Because she’s constantly looking around. She’s tense with her  hands and arms, rides him tense.  INTERVIEWER. Would he feel it through her hands?  EVENTER: Yes, he feels it through her hands.  INTERVIEWER: Through her seat? Through the saddle? Do you think he can  feel it through the saddle?  EVENTER: Yes, through the legs, the hands. She’s very tense. She’s very rigid  and you’re the opposite. You sit very quiet and you’re very relaxed, looking  around enjoying it. A different attitude and he picks it up very quickly. I think  if Mary rode him for a long time and you didn’t ride him, he’d be a very ner-  vous horse. . ..  He might peak at this and peak at that, but you say “Scotty,”  pull him back and go on. It doesn’t make you nervous. You’re not nervous  for the rest of the ride where Mary is. As soon as he spooks at anything,  she’s extremely nervous, starts hanging on [pulling on the reins] and tensing  her body. She’s so worried she’s going to fall off that something is going to  happen. Well, he gets very tense and nervous. You’re totally the opposite.  You’re relaxed. A lot of times you’re riding without any contact. You’re  riding with a nice loose rein and socializing. Your mind isn’t on what he’s  doing, so he doesn’t do anything. (field notes; telephone interview)  “Conversations” can vary from being loud, crude, and confusing to being quiet,  refined, and clear. A commentator during a dressage test noted a case of poor com-  munication: “You can see that the horse and rider are not too well acquainted. Com-  munication . . . could be better. It shows how difficult it is to take over another’s  horse at this level” (Burghley Horse Trials, August 31, 1995). The horse’s regular  rider had broken her arm a few days earlier and her fiance was riding in her place.  Two famous figures in British jumping and foxhunting circles of the 1940s and  1950s, the Olympians Foxhunter and Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Llewellyn, exem-  plify the opposite, intimate communication, what Llewellyn sees as telepathic.  I have recorded elsewhere how Foxhunter, my showjumper, who clearly loved  showjumping, could read my mind and I could read his. If I wanted him to stop I  </page> <page sequence="16"> 62 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1, 2000  hardly had to do anything. He  just knew what I was thinking. There was no ques-  tion of any severe pulls on the rein. Part of this was due to his cool mind, but one  has to realize that all horses have different characters just as humans do.  (Lleweliyn 19848)  To achieve effective communication, an eventer may work for years with a horse  honing its performance, in contrast to, say, a jockey who is hired to ride a horse in a  single race. It hardly needs to be said that winning partnerships in eventing require  intimate communication.  Mutual Trust and Confidence  Eventing is said to be the ultimate test of trust and confidence between horse  and rider. The cross-country course puts a premium on having a horse that will  jump into water (depth unknown to it), off banks six feet high, and over ten-foot,  water-filled ditches. The rider, but not the horse, has seen the actual course before the  competition. Hence horses have to be confident and trust their rider and vice versa.  Steinkraus, veteran of five Olympics, says of his mount, Snowbound: “He would  trust my judgement and believe in me. If I had pointed him at a seven-foot wall, he  would probably have cleared it” (Jaffer 1996:66).T ouch of Class, a little mare, cap-  tured two gold medals at the 1984 Olympics. Her rider, Joe Fargis, said, “It was cer-  tainly the biggest course she ever jumped and the biggest course I ever jumped. Our  relationship had grown. A horse has to trust its rider. That’s a common denomina-  tor for all horses who jump a very big course. There’s nothing mysterious about it”  (Jaffer 1996:68).  Lucinda Green discusses the training necessary to produce these traits:  A horse may take anything upward of seven years to train for a full-scale (ad-  vanced) three-day event. Throughout the years of training I have uppermost in  my mind the desire to create an ever-strengthening bond of trust between my  horse and myself. I must be careful never to present him with a question [prob-  lem] before he is ready, physically and mentally, to answer it. This applies to  both dressage and jumping. He must build up his self-confidence as well as his  trust, so that when the moment comes that I ask him to jump off what appears  to be the edge of the world . . .he  will trust me, believe in himself, and go with-  out hesitation.  Steinkraus warns about not asking for too much too soon: “If you overmatch a  horse early in its career, you can be sure he’ll never make it to the top” (Steinkraus,  television commentator, 1989 World Championship, Aachen, Germany).  An instructor used to admonish her students about the grave responsibility they  had once they had gained a horse’s trust, for this bond is fragile and easily broken.  Mistakes may result in injuries whereby the bond is weakened or even destroyed.  Asking a horse to do something it is not ready for may scare it. Horses and riders  sensing each other’s fear may lose self-confidence. “Losing one’s nerve” is a com-  mon problem in the horse world.  </page> <page sequence="17"> The Horse-Rider Relationship 63  World-class riders point to mutual trust and confidence as being absolutely es-  sential and stress the importance of these qualities being carefully nutured by work-  ing together.  DEVELOPING A PARTNERSHIP WITH WIDE AWAKE  Having examined the ingredients that make up a good partnership, let us turn to  how a partnership was developed with one gifted but difficult horse, Wide Awake,  that withstood eventing’s severest challenge, Badminton. If there is anyone quali-  fied to discuss partnerships, it is Lucinda Green, who has created outstanding perfor-  mances on at least seven horses with whom she won Badminton and Burghley nine  times5 Why do horses perform so well with her? How has she been able to beat the  world’s best so many times? Is it, in part, because she develops such strong partner-  ships with her horses? Not only is she a brilliant rider, but she is a keen observer who  has the facility, rarely found in riders, to articulate her experiences with horses. The  following excerpts are from her book, Four Square (1985), which chronicles the  course of a relationship that began in conflict and, despite clashes and setbacks (so se-  vere she was contemplating giving up eventing), ended in harmony three years later.  On her first ride, 1973, Green and Wide Awake jumped a few fences. “His power  and boldness were not in question after those initial hedges, but the disdain he ac-  corded this rider’s wishes left doubt in her mind from the start as to  her ability to  ride him” (p. 20). There was little communication between them in riding: Wide  Awake did not respect her signals. Nor were they compatible in the stable. Green  found his behavior downright exasperating.  In our brief acquaintance so far Wide Awake and I were not amalgamating  well. . . . Far from possessing a gentlemanly outlook, he proved to be the original  pugnacious, cheeky schoolboy. He took the greatest delight in doing as much to  annoy us as he could-mundane annoyances, such as backing someone into a  corner of his stable; or waiting until the mucking-out dustbin was brim full [of  manure] and then backing into it and knocking it all over the clean floor. When a  protective exercise boot was being put on a front leg, he would lift up his foot  and wave it quietly around, refusing to put it down until he was certain of scor-  ing a direct hit on a toe, or better still, a bended knee. . . . Frustrations built up  between me and this independent individual who was supposed to be next in line  to the Badminton winner [Be Fair, her first horse]. (p. 22)  Their incompatibility continued she had never ridden a horse like him before,  and his reckless jumping did not inspire her trust or confidence. He, for his part, was  not happy with the way she rode him.  The only type of horse that I had any idea how to ride was a naturally balanced,  extremely cautious Be Fair, who always took the greatest care of himself and his  rider. Suddenly I found myself astride a less-balanced, straggly seven-year-old  who never looked twice at anything he was asked to jump. . . .H e treated novice  one-day event cross-country courses with scorn.. . . If he was on the right stride  </page> <page sequence="18"> 64 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1, 2000  he cleared them [fences], if he was on the wrong one he hit them. [Hitting solid  obstacles, as noted, can be dangerous.] The more arrangements I made in front  of the fence in an attempt to warn him not to hit it, the more flippantly he would  jump. I could not fathom it.. . . For a long time I felt that the hit-or-miss rides he  gave me were my fault because I was not perhaps preparing him sufficiently be-  fore each fence. It was nearly two years before it began to dawn on me that  maybe it was the preparation itself which was upsetting him and making him  lose his concentration. (pp. 22-24)  It was at Wylye that their trust and confidence in each other began to develop.  He did prove a little easier to ride across country in the Wylye Novice Three-  Day Event.. . . He show-jumped more carefully too, and a double clear earned  him fourth place. . . . For the first time I was pleased with Wakey. . . . Our trust in  each other barely existed before Wylye. Therefore we had much catching up to  do in constructing the foundations of our mutual confidence. (p. 24)  Nevertheless, even in mid-1974, serious problems remained: they did not communi-  cate well and they lacked mutual respect. Wide Awake’s owner noted their incom-  patibility and suggested that Green return the horse to her.  We were still at loggerheads. I fought him in an attempt to make him jump more  carefully; he disliked interference and fought back. Even before Tidworth, his  owner, Vicki, knew we were not happy together and tactfully suggested that if I  thought we were at odds maybe I ought to send him back to her. . . .Vicki quoted  the case of a famous jockey who had found that he could not click with a certain  racehorse, in order to make me feel that it was no disgrace to be unable to accli-  matise to Wide Awake. (p. 30)  Green gained some confidence in Wide Awake after a successful cross-country ride  that put them in the lead at the Tidworth Three-Day Event, but this lead vanished  because of his sloppy show jumping.  Wakey had given me a slightly safer ride than I expected. He was thinking a little  more and hitting [obstacles] a little less and managed the difficult fences better  than easy ones . .. To our amazement Wakey ended the cross-country day in the  lead of his section. The rejoicing lasted barely twenty-four hours because there  was still no true understanding between us  The following day, through more flat  and careless jumping, three show-jumps crashed onto the hard-baked chalk  ground. In similar fashion we descended from first to fourth. (p. 32)  An incident occurred in 1975 that Green felt clearly demonstrated Wide Awake’s  antipathy toward her and caused her coach to advise against competing that year at  Badminton because they had not yet achieved a partnership. After a poor perfor-  mance, Green returned to the arena and worked him. No progress was made.  Green reported, “We returned to the horsebox [trailer] no longer on speaking  terms” (p. 38). In the trailer he sandwiched her between the dividing bar of the two  stalls, pressing his fifteen-hundred-pound body against her and, despite her efforts  to free herself, continuing to push. Her cries brought help. “That incident scared me. I  had always suspected Wakey of having a devious, albeit good-humoured nature  </page> <page sequence="19"> The Horse-Rider Relationship 65  which he would use to antagonise humans rather than to help them. But this retali-  ation, I felt, was a sign of his genuine dislike for me” (pp. 38-39). After this clash  her coach advised, “Why do you want to take him this year [to Badminton]? . . .  [Tlhe two of you don’t quite fit together yet” (p. 40).  Their relationship began to gel with the Ledyard (U.S.) event, despite Green’s  initial despair. Her self-confidence had eroded because of a series of mistakes and falls.  However, with a clear cross-country ride she regained some confidence and hope  that a partnership might eventually develop. She actually began to like Wide Awake  and appreciate his way of going.  Ledyard was to be my own personal testing ground. My self-confidence had  gradually flaked away over the past year and a half. Eventually only the raw  truth remained to face me. I was twenty-one and I was no good at three-day  eventing. I was doing stupid things, such as wrecking Wide Awake’s cross-country  practice.. .a nd losing my way with Be Fair on the steeplechase phase and with it  the 1974 World Championships. More indicative than this, however, was the fact  that good horses were continually falling with me. In the last five major three-  day events I had incurred five falls.  Before leaving England I told my sister, Karol, that if I could not stay upright  with Wide Awake at Ledyard I would feel bound to give up eventing. It did not  seem fair that good horses should continue to be burdened with my presence  and my errors.  Wide Awake first found a place in my heart on that boiling-hot afternoon on  the cross-country at Ledyard. It was not an easy course and he went clear. Possi-  bly this was partly due to the sunstroke which hit me and left me feeling suffi-  ciently sick and weak not to interfere with his cross-country.. . . For the first time  in our association Wakey had produced a trump card exactly on cue. . . .With fa-  miliar careless, flat jumping [in the show-jumping test] two poles fell. [This caused  them to end up eighth rather than fourth.] Although harassed by my inability to  improve our show-jumping together, I left America with a small handful of confi-  dence. A thin life-line had finally traversed the gulf between Wide Awake and me.  Something had taken root that might, in time, germinate into a partnership. . . .  Confidence began to swell and with it came a little more feeling and understand-  ing in my riding. This, coupled with the experience gained at Ledyard, produced an  improving relationship between Wide Awake and me by the time we arrived at  Boekelo, for the Dutch Three-Day Event in late October. (pp. 43-45)  The bond between Green and Wide Awake was strengthened when they won  Boekelo in 1975. Green had adopted a way of riding that better suited Wide Awake.  It respected his way of going by not interfering with his jumping style. He re-  sponded and changed from being an indifferent to a cooperative horse.  This was the first time that Wide Awake had handled a cross-county course like a  top-class horse. He jumped most of what was the biggest course seen in Boekelo  using his body and his mind! . . . I realised I must learn how to make my hands  more acceptable to him. . . . John, an eventer and show jumper himself, . . .  stopped me riding with my hands and trying to shorten and place Wide Awake to  make him round his back. Instead he made me sit very still and allow Wakey the  freedom to sort each fence out for himself. To my astonishment Wide Awake  </page> <page sequence="20"> 66 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1,  2000  started to drop his head as he took off and round his back thereby being able to  tuck up his legs. It was probably during that afternoon that I finally stumbled on  the key to the technique Wide Awake required. . . . Boekelo brought out and  confirmed the very best side of Wide Awake’s character. . . . Wide Awake  changed almost overnight because I believe he sensed that at last he was no  longer surrounded by antagonism. He had made his own name, forged his own  path, and he was genuinely loved and respected for it. (pp. 47-49)  Finally a relationship that had begun in mutual antagonism culminated in a su-  perb partnership. Compatibility, respect, close communication, trust, and confidence  now existed between them.  We continued to build on the partnership that had begun to emerge at Boekelo.  . . . In 1976 Wide Awake felt ready to take on the challenge of Badminton.. . .  [Tlhis was the first time that I had enough confjdence in him for the possibility  [of winning] even to flash through my mind.. . . In the nick of time harmony be-  tween us had germinated. . . . Provided the directions were tactful he allowed me  to tell him what to do. . . . The erratic jumping, the thoughtless approaches, the  casual answers to my questions were no longer in evidence. In their place was a  poem, an ecstatic, beautifully scanned and rhythmic poem. (pp. 50-54)  Tragically, at the peak of his career, after receiving the trophy from Queen Eliza-  beth and completing a victory lap of the show ring, Wide Awake reared, fell over  backward, and died. No definitive answer has ever been given as to the cause, al-  though many have speculated it was a massive heart attack.  Green’s account shows how she constructed an understanding of Wide Awake’s  subjective experiences, of how she defined and made sense of a series of experi-  ences with a nonverbal other by constantly taking his perspective. Her construction  sustained a rewarding flow of interaction, and its success was confirmed by the  outcome-it worked! They won eventing’s most coveted competition, Badminton.  Green described Wide Awake’s character in human terms: “a pugnacious, cheeky  schoolboy” who lacked a “gentlemanly outlook,” “an independent individual”  whom she suspected of having a “devious, albeit good-humoured nature which he  would use to antagonize humans.” She sees him as having a mind that he used to fig-  ure out how to jump obstacles once she gave him the freedom to do so, as well as a  self that changed after his win because he sensed her pride in him and he was proud  of himself. Green constructed a “human” identity for Wide Awake just as Sanders’s  (1993) dog owners did for their dogs and Alger and Alger’s (1997) cat owners did  for their feline companions.  In developing this partnership, Wide Awake was an active participant in the day-  to-day interaction. He displayed likes and dislikes, a range of emotions, his own  habits, and a mind that made independent decisions. Not only did Green have to  adapt to him, but he had to adapt to her. He had to learn to listen and not to fight  back every time she tried to tell him something. She influenced him and he influ-  enced her. A complex set of negotiations took place, a give-and-take between horse  and rider rather than either dictating to the other. As a veteran trainer put it, “YOU  </page> <page sequence="21"> The Horse-R ider Rela tionship 67  give a little and you take a little.” Hence before a true partnership could develop,  both Green and Wide Awake had to accommodate to each other.  CONCLUSION  Confidence, harmony, partnership-call it what you like-is an interesting phe-  nomenon. It is dificult to pin-point its ingredients but it is easy to recognise when  its presence is lacking.  -Green, Four Square  I have taken the term eventers use, “partnership,” and examined its dimensions.  The quotations show the way they think about, and work at developing, it. Compat-  ibility as well as mutual respect, trust, confidence, and close communication are all  essential. Developing these qualities takes time: the strength of the partnership is  often related to the length of time the horse and rider have been together. Its devel-  opment with one particular horse has also been explored.  Successful partnerships have been shown to be built on a multifaceted flow of in-  teraction. Interacting with a living being is not at all like “interacting” with an inan-  imate object. Riders see horses as active participants with emotions, intelligence,  and distinct personalities who engage in rudimentary minded behavior. This makes  relationships with them very different from relationships with a beloved sports car  or tenderly cared for roses.  The discourse of people who spend their daily lives with horses, many of whom  depend on horses for a living, is data that deserve respect. It is obvious that they do  not talk nonsense. Their way of talking provides far more insight into this world  than the academic debates of philosophers, linguists, and sociologists who have had  no close and continuous interaction with animals. Sociologists need to acknowledge  that horse people’s observations and beliefs are probably more accurate than their  own and that humans share more with the animal world than some have been will-  ing to admit. The data on which this article is based support Arluke and Sanders  (1996) in that the rigid line separating human from nonhuman interaction should be  relaxed and sociology should distance itself from an outdated anthropocentric focus.  The scope of its inquiry should be broadened to include the nonhuman species. We  could then learn more about an important aspect of people’s lives-their relation-  ships with domestic animals.  The ingredients of a good relationship have been emphasized. A secondary focus  has been on processes that undermine a partnership. While not explored in any  depth, they are, in the main, the opposite of those involved in good partnerships.  Horses and riders that, for any number of reasons, are incompatible, do not respect  each other, do not communicate well, and lack mutual trust and confidence.  Partnerships have been discussed from the human and not the equine perspec-  tive. We know that horses and riders do not perceive the world in the same way: ob-  stacles that strike fear into the hearts of riders are treated with nonchalance by  </page> <page sequence="22"> 68 Symbolic Interaction Volume 23, Number 1,2000  horses, and vice versa. Advances in research on equine perception may some day  permit a better understanding of how horses perceive relationships with humans.6  The dimensions eventers consider necessary in a partnership are probably neces-  sary for relationships with other animals. For instance, in exploring partnerships  with dogs, it would be interesting to examine policemen and their guard dogs,  mushers and their huskies, and the blind and their guide dogs, a partnership of par-  ticular significance since these dogs are trained to make decisions that may override  their owners’  decision^.^ As for human relationships, it is hard to imagine an endur-  ing friendship or a happy marriage in which these qualities are absent.

The names of equestrians that have made public statements, whether through their writings,  lectures, clinics, or television commentary, or had statements made about them in public will be  retained. They are usually eminent horse people. It is far more meaningful for Canadians to  know, for instance, that Ian Millar’s superstar Big Ben behaved in a certain way and how his  groom coped than to write about a “famous horse and his groom.” Also, the omission of names  could be construed as a form of plagiarism. Similarly, in referencing field notes that involve  world-class horse people and competitions, names, dates, and locations will be given since the  opinions of these people on what constitutes successful partnerships bear more weight than  those of ordinary equestrians. The names of others who have no public face will not be used.  3. In my first version of this article, I included “Keeping a Horse Happy” as one of the dimensions  of a partnership. To comply with a reviewer’s suggestion, the section was removed. However, I  still maintain, based on much empirical evidence, that it is an important dimension.  4. See Hearne’s (1986b) discussion of training Drummer Girl not to bolt her jumps.  5. For outsiders to appreciate Green’s dazzling record, a comparison is in order. When Stuart Black,  a Canadian, placed at Badminton in 1998, a local magazine enthused: “Stuart Black of Orange-  ville, Ont. finished an incredible seventh.” Green won Badminton six times on six horses and was  second twice and thud once, accomplished in starting lineups of between seventy and one hun-  dred horses. In 1977, riding two horses, she was first on one and third on another. To have her de-  tailed, frank account of how she developed a partnership, in which she admits to fear and self-  doubt, seldom publicly admitted by world-class riders, is extraordinary data, not easy to come by.  6. See the work on equine perception of Katherine Houpt (1995,1996), professor of physiology  and director of the behavioral clinic at Cornell University, and the research of the animal be-  haviorist Temple Grandin on cattle (Raver 1997).  7. Clinton Sanders pointed out this important difference.  REFERENCES  Ainslie, Tom and Bonnie Ledbetter. 1980. The Body Language of Horses.
