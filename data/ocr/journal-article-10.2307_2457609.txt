<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FOOD OF INSECTS AND ITS RELATION TO RESISTANCE OF PLANTS TO INSECT ATTACK 1'2 PROFESSOR REGINALD H. PAINTER ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENTOMOLOGY, KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION A STUDY of the resistance of crop plants to insect attack has served to emphasize the great importance of food habits in the biology and evolution of plant-feeding in- sects. The evidence is accumulating that two plants, identical outwardly, may differ widely in nutritive value to an insect species as measured by the insect's ability to maintain a population on them. Resistance of plants to insect attack may be defined as the relative amount of qualities possessed by the plant which influence the ultimate degree of damage done. For practical purposes it represents the ability of a crop plant to produce a larger crop than do ordinary varieties at the same level of insect population. This difference in yield is a measure of the economic value of resistance, but is, however, dependent on many factors as well as resistance to insects. It should be the purpose of projects on insect resis- tance in crop plants to produce varieties not only as good or better in respect to agronomic characters and disease resistance than those now available, but also resistant to one or more insects. Thus the breeding of crop plants resistant to insect attack becomes part of the entomolo- gist's contribution to the crop improvement program of a particular crop and, conversely, insect resistance should 1 Contribution No. 442 from the Department of Entomology, BKCansas Agri- cultural Experimeilt Station. 2 The writer is indebted to his colleagues and a number of his friends for discussing with him some of the problems presented in this paper who thus have aided in the clarification of some *of the ideas given.

The place which plant resistance occupies in a pro- gram of insect control will vary with each crop aild in- sect. Frequently it will be only a contributing feature. Occasionally it may be the chief means of controlling a pest. Sometimes the study of a case of insect resistance will serve only to prevent the distribution of varieties more susceptible than those now in use. In the case of each common injurious insect and each crop plant the possibilities of the use of resistant varieties need to be examined. The more apparent causes or factors which enter into resistance and related phenomena in various plants, to- gether with references to a few examples, may be out- lined as follows: FACTORS IN THE RESISTANCE OF PLANTS TO INSECT ATTACK I. Evasion: Transitory or pseudo-resistance by avoidance. A. Tinle of maturity. ( Genetic and ecological.) (Boll weevil and cotton; Isley; 1934.) B. Soil conditions. (Largely ecological.)

Resistance and tolerance: (Largely genetic.) A. Resistance mechanisms largely of plant origin. (1) Resistance to diseases carried by insects. (Eutettix tennellits and curly top of sugar beet; Carsner; 1933.) (2) Passive resistance; resistance due to mechanical barriers, such as hairs, cuticle, etc. (Leaf-hoppers and soy-beans; Johnson and Hollowell; 1935.) (3) Active resistance. (a) Repair and recovery. (Corn-root worm and corn; Bigger; 1935.) (b) Tolerance mechanisms. (Corn or sorghum and chinch bugs (in part) ; Painter et al., 1935; Snelling et al., 1936.) (c) Destruction of eggs and other stages by cell proliferation. (Boll weevil and cotton; Hinds; 1906.) (d) Habit of growth. (Onion thrips; Jones et al., 1935.) B.

(2) Mechanisms related to feeding with the following results for the insects: (a) Abnormal length of life. (b) High mortality. (c) Reduced size. (d) Reduced fecundity. III. Immunity. (Largely genetic.) An immune variety, if defined as a variety which a specific insect will never consume or injure under any condition, does not exist as far as present knowledge goes. In particular, among some cases of the resistance to aphids cited later in this paper there are examples of resistance that approach immunity. In the case of the relationship of most insects to plants it is to be expected that resistance will be relative and must be measured in terms of the susceptible or commonly grown varieties. Hence plant resistance may commonly be expected to vary with the intensity of the insect infestation. Injury of an ordinarily resistant variety, when in the presence of a heavy infestation, does not constitute proof of sus- ceptibility unless the injury to susceptible varieties and to the ordinarily resistant variety is equal in all respects. A variety which carries only a relatively low order of resistance may be of considerable economic importance even if badly injured by occasional heavy infestation. There are at least four reasons for the study of the cause of resistance. The most important is to differenti- ate cases of evasion or escape from those in which the resistance factor is stable under a wide range of condi- tions. Such a factor, when genetic, may be incorporated into desirable varieties. When evasion is due to earli- ness resulting from genetic characters it may also be of use in insect control. The importance of evasion is shown by the increased use of quick-maturing cotton varieties during the earlier days of the Mexican cotton boll weevil invasion. The manipulation of ecological</page><page sequence="4">550 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VoL. LXX factors is a valuable adjunct in insect control. Yet eco- logical changes must be made repeatedly and when coii- cerned with crops are subject to the exigencies of farm practice and fluctuations of the weather. With the ex- ception of records concerning "date of planting" there is relatively little actual data indicating the possibility of resistance induced by ecological means. On the other hand, there are numerous cases in which resistance to insect attack is inherited and may be incorporated into desirable plant varieties. In this connection, however, it must be remembered that the thing inherited is not resis- tance as such, but the ability to react repeatedly with the same environment, both biological and physical, in a cer- tain way. Some of the hybrids from a cross between resistant and susceptible plant varieties may be expected to react like the parents when under the same conditions. Others may be intermediate or may occasionally surpass either parent in resistance or susceptibility. If the en- vironment, either physical or biological, or both, is changed the reaction of both parents and hybrids may be changed. Thus wheat varieties and hybrids that react as resistant to the Hessian fly in the hard wheat belt of Kansas or in California are susceptible in the soft wheat belt of eastern Kansas and in some states further east. This does not invalidate conclusions regarding resistance, previously reached. A second reason for the study of cases of resistance is to enable the plant breeder to differentiate the several genetic factors that may be involved and their method of operation. Some cases of resistance have been shown to be due to single genetic factors, while others appear to be associated with multiple factors. Different resistant varieties may carry different genetic factors which give the same degree of resistance but attain it through dif- ferent means. On the other hand, the same variety may carry two or more genetic factors for resistance. Thus Marquillo wheat usually carries a lower egg count and also lower larvae survival of Hessian fly than most other wheat varieties. Some evidence at hand indicates that</page><page sequence="5">No. 731] THE FOOD OF INSECTS 551 these two factors in the resistance of Marquillo are the result of different genes. It is especially important to know whether the different genetic factors are cumula- tive in their effect on the level of resistance. A study of the cause of resistance is of importance in its relation to a knowledge of the biology of the insect studied. The tropisms and other reactions of an insect sometimes stand out iin sharper contrast against the back- ground of different varieties. Thus the study of varie- ties has added to the knowledge of the relationship of the European corn borer to tall, vigorous growing corn. (Neiswander and Huber, 1929.) The study of the cause of resistance has frequently been emphasized because a visible factor is of value in the selection of resistant plants. The danger in this use is emphasized below. In addition, if selections made in this manner are not continually tested against the insect, there is a possibility of loss of modifying factors that may be of importance. It is necessary to be cautious in assigning an inherited factor as the "cause" in a case of resistance to insect attack. Genetically such a factor may be: (1) The actual modus opeiandi of resistance. (2) One of the multiple effects of a gene operating to cause resistance il some other way. That is to say, the actual cause of resistance may be one effect of a gene which is also visible in some character inherited parallel with resistance. (3) A gene which is closely linked with the one causing resistance. (4) One of a group of genes giving the sale phenotypic reaction but not all connected with resistance. It should also be remembered that resistance and its cause may themselves result from multiple factors, only one of which may be associated with the cause assigned. In spite of the genetic complications it has been possible to make progress in breeding plants resistant to insect attack without knowing in detail the cause of such resis- tance. Resistance may and frequently does result from a com- bination of two or more of these factors. Some factors or causes of resistance, notably those which may be</page><page sequence="6">552 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VToL. LXX grouped under I and IIA, have been summarized in various places. Those mechanisms of resistance which require an in- sect counterpart have not been emphasized sufficiently in summaries of studies in insect resistance. They concern some character of the plant which calls forth a physio- logical or tropistic reaction on the part of the insect to complete the quality of resistance or susceptibility. They concern mostly the food relationships of the insect and are of the nature of interdependent reactions between plant and insect. Through the last hundred years of en- tomological and botanical literature, examples are widely scattered, but when brought together shed some light on the problems involved. It is the purpose of this paper to bring together a number of these examples, especially the more recent ones, show their bearing on various ento- mological problems and suggest possible physiological explanations. The food relationships between insects and plants are especially apparent at three points in insect life history: (1) At time of oviposition by the female or location of food plant by the young larvae; (2) at time of commence- ment of feeding by the young larvae or nymphs; (3) in the effect of niutrition on the later stages, especially on mortality in the last instar before reaching the adult stage, in length of adult stage and in fecundity of the female. The attractiveness of a plant for oviposition or when sought as a food plant for an insect frequently appears to involve the character of the surface or chemical com- pounds which give off odors. These characters belong in the group of factors under consideration only to the ex- tent that the attractiveness or lack of it involves tropisms on the part of the insect. The character of the surfaces available for oviposition have been mentioned as one of the causes of resistance. The hairiness or thickness of the epidermis usually represents only passive mechani- cal resistance, though negative responses in the oviposit- ing insects may be involved. The hairiness of various</page><page sequence="7">No. 731] THE FOOD OF INSECTS 553 legumes and cotton have sometimes been assigned as one cause of the resistance of certain varieties to leaf-hoppers (Hollowell et al., 1927; Pieters, 1928; Parnell, 1925; Johnson and Hollowell, 1935). Jewett (1932) has shown, however, that some other factors besides pubescence are involved in the case of alfalfa and clover. One of these may be the ease with which the leaf epidermis of the several varieties may be punctured. (Jewett, 1933, 1935.) He relates this factor to the feeding of the insects, but if the difference occurs on the stems it may also be related to oviposition. Poos and Smith (1931) also have shown that factors other than pubescence are of more impor- tance in differences in the oviposition of the potato leaf- hopper Empoasca fabae on varieties of its food plants. The toughness of the epidermis and associated cells has been cited as one factor in resistance to insect attack, especially among insects ovipositiiig or feeding in fruits. (Boyce, 1933.) A few cases of differential oviposition on host varie- ties have been recorded without assigning a cause for the differences in tropistic reaction. Holloway (1935) has recorded differences in the size of egg clusters of the sugar cane borer (Diatraea saccharalis) on various vari- eties of sugar cane. McColloch (1918) has shown that each of four varie- ties of durum wheats had fewer Hessian fly eggs laid on them than did Marquis spring or the winter wheats studied. Packard (by letter) has called the writer's at- tention to the fact that Marquillo, a hybrid between Mar- quis, vulyare, and lumillo, durum, wheat shows the same lower oviposition rate. In a count of a light infestation in the field in 1935 there were 8 times as many eggs laid on Ceres as on Marquillo wheat planted in an adjacent row. Counts of eggs were made on six replications. This low attractiveness to Hessian fly females appears to have been transferred in some cases to winter segre- gates of crosses between Marquillo and winter wheats. Thus a character resulting in a low rate of oviposition appears to have been transferred from a durum wheat</page><page sequence="8">554 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXX (Triticutt durm) to a common spring wheat (T. vul- gare) and then to a winter type (T. vulgare). The char- acter of the wheat plant which brings about this low ovi- position rate is unknown. It and the other cases cited may be related to the character of the leaf surface or to odor. In either case it is not surprising to find it inherited. The habit and vigor of growth is a feature of plant development that has an influence on insect reproduction. Both are greatly influenced by local soil and edaphic coii- ditions in addition to variety characteristics and adapta- tion. It has been suggested, for instance, that the rela- tive erectness of leaf blades in wheat was the reason for differences in the number of eggs laid on different leaves of the same plant or of different plants. Position is, how- ever, only one of several possible reasons. Hybrid vigor has been-shown to be a factor in the resistance of corn and sorghum hybrids to chinch bugs. Whether there is any effect on oviposition is yet unknown. The European corn borer selects tall vigorous corn for oviposition (Neiswander and Huber, 1929). These characteristics may be due to variety or to ecological conditions or both. The relative difference in acceptability for oviposition of two varieties planted under different conditions of soil or date of planting, remains the same, though the more resistant variety of one experimental plot may carry a larger number of eggs than the susceptible variety in an- other plot. Such occurrences serve to emphasize the fact that, so far as is known, resistance is relative and varie- ties must be compared, as far as possible, at equivalent stages of development. MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE RELATED TO FEEDING The usual classification of phytophagous insects into the groups polyphagous, oligophagous and monophagous is useful but essentially misleading, since it disguises the actual conditions and is only a classification of the ap- parent foods. It necessarily is based on lists of plants which insects eat rather than those which furnish equal</page><page sequence="9">No. 731] THE FOOD OF INSECTS 555 nutriment. It can be demonstrated that varieties of a single host species or even parts of individual plants may differ in respect to nutriment. On the other hand, biological races of a single insect species may belong under different categories. Thus the European corn- borer strain with a single brood is practically monopha- gous, while the multiple brooded strain is polyphagous. Only if such modifications are kept in mind is the classi- fication useful. Related to this problem is the tendency to interpret food relations of insects on the basis of rela- tive acceptability as human food. Statements are fre- quent in the literature that a given insect did not feed on a certain plant because it was not as succulent as or more fibrous than its normal food. Less anthropomorphic explanations are probably nearer the truth. INSECTS DEVELOPING ON A WIDER RANGE OF HOSTS Many entomologists would consider the gipsy-moth, grasshoppers, cutworms and the corn-ear worm as be- longing among the so-called polyphagous species. In a study of 149 food plants of the gipsy-moth, Mosher (1915) found 42 species of plants that were "favored food," 13 species that were "favored food" after the early larval stages, 32 species on which a small propor- tion of gipsy-moth larvae developed and 62 species that were unfavored food. Evidently this fairly omnivorous Lepidopteron could not assimulate equally well all kinds of vegetable matter which it will eat. Hodge (1933) in rearing in separate containers indi- viduals of Melanoplus differentials from egg to adult on single food plants, found a range of mortality from 28 per cent. on wheat to 95.7 per cent. on oats. (Table I.) There was a mortality of 78.6 per cent. on lettuce, but all adults reared on both oats and lettuce died within 48 hours. The tropistic reactions, growth curves and sus- ceptibility to disease in the case of insects reared on the two latter plants are suggestive of a condition analogous to vitamin deficiency.

In the case of the cotton boll worm (Heliotltis obso- leta), Isley (1935) has found that it took twice as long for larval development on tomato stems and foliage as on corn ears. Various other host plants were intermedi- ate (Table II).

Wadley (1931) found that although the green bu1g (Toxoptera gramii,?,mn) could maintain colonies iiidefi- nitely on wheat (Triticumn vulgare), rearing was some- what difficult on Minclum durum (Triticum durum). There was about 50 per cent. mortality on this variety. On Vernal emmer (Triticum dicoccumn) less than 10 per cent. of the aphids matured and no second generation de- veloped. The interspecific wheat hybrids which have been recently bred by agronomists and plant breeders might prove a fertile field for study of resistance to this insect. Since the middle of the last century it has been known that the grape Phylloxera was unable to maintain colo- nies on certain species of Vitis. This resistance reaction is still unchanggecl (Husmann, 1930), and apparently de- pends on some feature in connection with food of the in- sect. It has been shown to be due to a dominant genetic character in the plant. French workers (B. Trouvelot et al., 1933) have found recently that wide differences exist in the ability of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) to develop and maintain a population on various species of the genera Solanum, Datura and Nicotiana. Notable dif- ferences in susceptibility to the attacks of the beetle were observed among tuber-bearing species and varieties of Solantum. A few species of Solanutm were abandoned by the insects without tasting, on others there was little feeding but no growth, on still others the larvae lived various lengths of time but died before maturing. Smith (1921) has found differences in various phases of the biology of the boll weevil when reared under simi- lar conditions on Upland and on Sea-Island cotton.</page><page sequence="12">55S THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXX INSECTS OF RESTRICTED HABITS IN WHICH THE FOOD DIFFERS AMONG PLANTS WITHIN THE HOST SPECIES In the study of varieties resistant to* insect attack several cases have been studied in which varieties or in- dividual plants would not support a population of an insect. These cases involve variation within a host spe- cies and are of especial interest because the inheritance of this reaction may be more easily studied. More than 100 years ago (Lindley, 1831) an apple vari- ety, Winter Majetin, was first reported as resistant to the woolly apple aphis (Eriosoma lanigerum). From time to time other varieties have also been observed to show this character, and all have retained them accord- ing to recent experimental work. Le Pelley (1927) in a study of Northern Spy apple was never able to get the woolly apple aphis to reproduce on this variety, although they would feed on it for as long as five weeks. No trace of galls was evident, and colonies placed on either roots or stems eventually died out. The same facts were true of Winter Majetin. The Northern Spy variety appears to carry this character in the heterozygous condition as some of the progeny are susceptible. DeLong and Jones (1926) working with the Houghtol gooseberry aphid (Mlyzus houghtonensis) found certain plants of the Houghton variety on which the insects would feed but on which they were unable to maintain a population. The plants were indistinguishable from sus- ceptible ones typical of the variety. In his study of the raspberry aphids, Winter (1929) found fewer individuals of Avtphorophora rubi in the field on the Herbert variety than on any other. Under cage conditions the aphids in colonies increased at a much slower rate on this variety than on others studied and eventually died out. He concluded from further ex- periments that the thickness of cuticle was not a limiting factor and that difference in food material used by the aphids possibly accounted for the resistance of the Her- bert variety.</page><page sequence="13">No. 731] THE FOOD OF INSECTS 559 Blanchard and Dudley (1934), working independently in California and Wisconsin, have found individual plants of several varieties of alfalfa on which the pea aphid (illinoia pisi) was unable to maintain a popula- tion. Progeny of these same plants showed similar re- sistance, indicating the inheritance of the character. Similar resistant individual plants have been found in Kansas in a number of varieties (Painter and Grandfield, 1935). Studies since the latter publication have indi- cated the inability of aphids to maintain a population on these resistant plants and on some of their progeny. These studies have been carried on by Mr. R. C. Dahims under the direction of the author. Typical data are pre- sented in Table III. The method used was to cage 5 last instar nymphs or adults on individual branches in Cellophane cages. At the end of 10 days the numbers of live and dead aphids were recorded. Two or three cages were usually placed on a plant at the same time. An interesting development of this series of experiments, which has a bearing on the subject of food, concerns the relative development of aphids on flowering and vegetative branches of the same plant. In a series of experiments, aphids were caged on paired branches of the two types on a number of individual plants that were more or less resistant. In every case there was a greater increase in the average number of aphids per parent among those feeding on the flowering branches. The difference in the averages between vegeta- tive and flowering branches on the individual plants varied from 25.4 to 1.2 aphids per parent as the increase during a 10-day period. That differences exist in the composition of flowering or fruiting branches on various plants as compared to vegetative ones is fairly well known. The difference in the development of the aphids on the two types of branches and on the individual plants appears due to differences in food available to the insects. Dahms, Shelling and Fenton (1936) have found consid- erable differences in the mortality of nymphs and length of life of female chinch bugs fed on different varieties of</page><page sequence="14">560 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL.

They have also found differences in the nlum- ber of eggs laid. Females of the over-wintering genera- tion fed on Atlas sorgo laid an average of 4.3 eggs during an average span of life of 8.5 days. Those fed on Dwarf Yellow Milo laid an average of 73.4 eggs during an aver- age length of life of 23 days. The mortality of nymphs after the first instar averaged 8 per cent. when reared on Dwarf Yellow Milo as compared to 84 per cent. on Atlas. Insects reared on Atlas were smaller. These dif- ferences in life history appear to be only a part of the mechanism of resistance to chinch bug attack among the sorghums. Several genetic factors and several causative factors appear to be involved in the resistance of various varieties of wheat to the Hessian fly. (Painter, Salmon and Parker, 1931). The relative ability of larvae to commence feeding on the resistant varieties must frequently be considered. The food of these larvae is extracted largely or wholly through the unbroken cell wall of the plants.4 The dif- ference between varieties, therefore, may be a difference in the permeability of the cell walls to enzymes of the in- sect or to partially digested food material. It may differ in this respect from the cases of the Homoptera cited above. DisCUSSION Most of the examples cited confirm the view that varie- ties or species of plants which the insects eat do not all serve equally well for food when measured by the main- tenance of the insect population. There are some in- stances in which various parts of the same plant have given similar differences in respect to insect nutrition. In those cases which have been studied this difference in food is visible chiefly in its effect on length of life, death rate, size and fecundity, singly or in combination. The life span may be lengthened or shortened, depending on various environmental factors such as temperature, as well as the insect and plant involved. When fed on resis- tant plants, the life of the insect usually is shortened and 4 See discussion by Painter, Jonr. Econ. Ent., 23: 320-321, 1930.</page><page sequence="16">562 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXX death most frequently takes place either in the first instar or at about the time the insect reaches the adult stage. There are relatively few cases (Isley, 1935) in which actual measurements of size have been made, but occasion- ally mention is made that insects reared on resistant plants were smaller than those on susceptible ones. Fecundity was noted by Isley in the study of the corn-ear worm, for he called attention to the greatly reduced oviposition of the moths reared on the less usable food plants. In the studies of aphids, no progeny counts have been recorded for individual females, but since colonies were not maintained on resistant plants, reduced fecundity un- doubtedly occurred. In the case of the pea aphid on alfalfa there were usually fewer nymphs recorded from adults on resistant plants, and these usually died while small. There are several suggested explanations of these dif- feitences in effects of food observed with the insects and plants mentioned. Specific poisons are not uncommon among plants and may be the basis of some of the differ- ences. There are two groups of facts, however, that tend to make such a possibility less likely. One of these is that the insects frequently feed for a period of time and occa- sionally mature on the resistant plants. The other is that such factors as reduced size and fecundity would not appear to be the result of poisons. The varying availability of food as a whole may be partial explanation in some cases, particularly that of the Hessian fly. Uvarov (1928) points out that all digestible elements of plant cells are included within cell membranes, usually of cellulose, and that the problem of extracting this food must be solved by insects. Hemiptera have solved the problem, partially, by puncturing the cells. Nevertheless, the various insect species differ greatly in respect to the amount of injury done and in the transfer from plant cell to plant cell of the enzymes injected by the Hemipteron. This is a case of relative permeability of the cell walls to the enzymes involved or of inactivation of enzymes by living plant cells. Varieties and species</page><page sequence="17">No. 731] THE FOOD OF INSECTS 563 of plants may differ in respect to these reactions which thus furnish a basis for resistance. Related to the availability of food is the possible lack of specific food materials, especially proteins, in species or varieties of plants. Differences in varieties with re- spect to chemicals, especially pigments and, to some extent, proteins, have been frequently noted and their inheritance described. The development of insects with respect to specific food substances or mineral elements is almost an untouched field, but cases are known where specific substances play an important part in insect metabolism. While vitamins in insect nutrition have been studied very little, enough has been done to demonstrate their importance in some cases of insect metabolism. Likewise, differences in vitamin content have been shown to exist among varieties of plants. In expecting an insect to do equally well on two varieties of a plant we may, figura- tively speaking, be expecting our live stock to do as well oii white as on yellow corn. This does not necessarily mean that the same vitamins affect both insects and warm- blooded animals. Substances analogous to vitamins may be the basis of some cases of resistance. In addition to differences in the kind of food materials available to insects in various species and varieties of food plants, there may be present actual differences in the quantity. It has been suggested (Uvarov, 1928) that the excretion of honeydew by aphids results from the neces- sity of ingesting more carbohydrates from the sap of plants than are needed by the insect, in order to get a suf- ficient amount of the scanty supply of proteins available there. This may be the explanation for the increased reproduction of the pea aphid on flowering stems as com- pared to that on vegetative branches of alfalfa plants and perhaps of differences between individual plants. By thus analyzing the possible factors involved, it should be easier to plan experiments which will confirm or reject the suggested explanations. As data accumu- late, it may become necessary to add to or subtract from</page><page sequence="18">564 THE AMERICAAT NATURALIST [VOL. LXX the list of factors given and to be more definite in their statement. The explanations suggested above probably have their basis in differences in the protoplasm or cell contents of individual plant cells. It appears that such differences play an important role in the resistance of plants to insect attack. CONCLUSIONS The actual nutritive substances used by phytophagous insects in contrast to the plant parts which insects eat is a factor of great importance in insect biology and deserves as thorough and accurate a study as that which has been given to humidity and temperature. Mere lists of plants on which insects feed is only a small start on the problem. At present, the only available measure of the food value of a plant to an insect is the rate and extent of insect develop- ment, and this value differs even within plant varieties. Where differences in varieties exist, studies of insect biology made without knowledge of, and exact statement of, the variety of plant involved may have to be repeated. Lack of such information puts the study in the same class with those made without authoritative identification of the insect involved. The comparative availability of different species of food plants has been shown to have an important effect on the relative abundance of insect pests. Plants also influ- ence the incidence and effectiveness of insect parasitism through their effect on death rate and fecundity. Thus the influence of even a low level of insect resistance in plants may assume greater importance than is evident from small experimental plots. Workers are just beginning to realize the role that food may play in the factors causing resistance. Often various morphological or growth characters of plants were men- tioned as the cause of resistance in certain instances and subsequent investigation showed that other factors were of greater or equal importance. Food relationships also may be involved in these cases, and it is believed that further studies will reveal their connection with many cases of resistance.</page><page sequence="19">No. 7311 THE FOOD OF INSECTS 565 The utilization of differences in food value in varieties of plants may furnish us with a tool for the study of phases of insect nutrition. There is evidence that varie- ties may be developed differing chiefly in the character causing resistance through food relationships. Chemical or biological analysis of such varieties may throw more light on the real food of phytophagous insects. Underlying the interrelations of insect aiicl plant as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there is involved the whole evolution of the plant-insect relationship, based primarily on food. Progress has been made in the analy- sis of the evolution of morphological structures of insects, but this must have been accompanied by similar evolution in physiological reaction, especially in respect to food. The accumulating evidence of the presence of biological races of insects, so-called "physiological species," dif- fering ill food habits, is evidence that the evolution of plant and insect relationships has been parallel.
