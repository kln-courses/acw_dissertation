Shorts Peirces Theory of Signs offers a strong interpretation of semeiotic, advocat- ing a developmental and naturalistic posi- tion. This commentary examines some of the main features of Short s approach, raising a number of critical questions concerning the growth of Peirce s thought and the problem of anthropomorphism. First, two possible weaknesses in Short s account of the develop- ment of semeiotic, connected to the treat- ment of the "New List of Categories" and the role of the index, are noted. Next, the men- ace of anthropomorphism is placed in the context of Peirces startling affirmation of this point of view. Finally, the article draws attention to Shorts bold claim that Peirces theory of signs needs to be modified in order to accommodate a plurality of final interpre- tan ts in view of varying purposes. Keywords: Semeiotic, Anthropomorphism, Theory oflnterpretants, C. S. Peirce, T L. Short For many years, studies in semeiotic have suf- fered not only from C. S. Peirces unfortunate failure to produce a comprehensive presenta- tion of his theory of signs, but also from a lack of accessible monographs by some of his most astute interpreters. Now, with the pub- lication of T. L. Shorts Peirces Theory of Signs (2007), this regrettable state of affairs has been partly rectified.2 While the final judg- ment of Shorts book must be deferred to future interpretants, one does not need orac- ular powers to predict that it will greatly affect Peirce scholarship. No doubt, Peirce's Theory of Signs will generate a multitude of ultimate interpretants in the shape of interpretative habit-changes, in addition to more short- lived emotional and energetic responses.

In spite of its title, the book does not offer an all-inclu- O siye account of Peirce's theory of signs. Furthermore, Short's presenta- |-H tion of semeiotic quickly moves beyond a simple reconstruction of i""1 Peirce's texts. Short boldly takes on the fragmentary theory, and cor- ^ rects and complements it whenever he identifies such a need. ^ Consequently, we are faced with a strong interpretation of Peirce, ^ one clearly drawn toward a developmental reading and a naturalistic ^ point of view. Short advocates two strategies for handling Peirces ^ semeiotic. Firstly, Short stresses that Peirce's theory of signs undergoes r several major changes. More strongly, Short maintains that there are irreconcilable differences between Peirce's early and mature theories. Secondly, Short argues that Peirce's mature semeiotic is grounded in a theory of teleology. And, Short claims, this provides us with means to give a naturalistic explanation of intentionality. These basic perspec- tives are reasonable, but not incontestable, as he certainly knows. Short's exposition is also guided by a more external motive: to show that Peirce's theory of signs, often bypassed because of its unfamiliar terminology and seemingly idiosyncratic interests, actually addresses a number of issues debated in contemporary analytic philosophy in an original way. This is a decidedly worthwhile aim; hopefully, main- stream philosophers and present-day pragmatists are listening - in particular those who have simply accepted the late Richard Rorty's (1982, p. 161) indiscriminate dismissal of Peirce's semeiotic. In this brief commentary, I will not delve into the depths and details of Shorts interpretation; nor will I engage his meticulous elucidation of final causation and intentionality. Instead, I want to raise some general questions concerning Short's approach. While I find his interpretative strategy mostly viable and always engaging, I believe his developmental and naturalistic account is sometimes a bit too clear-cut, neglecting cer- tain questions that are not only problematic for the story told, but which may actually prove to be quite illuminating if studied closer. However, I also wish to draw attention to a proposed, potentially highly pregnant, modification to Peirce's theory of signs, lest it be overlooked in the midst of the rich flow of Short's narrative. Developmental Perspectives Short endorses a thoroughly developmental reading of Peirce's theory of signs. If accepted, this proposal will have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the coherence of Peirce's project; in fact, if Short is correct, it should no longer be satisfactory to speak merely of "Peirce's theory of signs", without specifying which theory is meant. Overall, the picture presented by Short is one of progression, but one of monumental leaps rather than of gradual growth. According to Short (2007, pp. 42-43), Peirce's early work in semeiotic leads to an</page><page sequence="3">idealistic and paradoxical theory of thought-signs. Purportedly, this D theory contains three serious flaws: (1) "it implies that thought lacks &lt; objects not constituted by thinking"; (2) it makes the sign's significance ^g* depend on its actually being interpreted, which means that significance 3 may be assigned arbitrarily; and (3) it assumes that all interpretants are g signs, engendering further sign-interpretants, which means that there ^ cannot be any noncircular account of significance. 5 Short then argues that Peirce corrects these faults in three steps, end- g ing up with a theory of signs so different from the early semeiotic that it really is a new theory. The first fault is corrected in the late 1870s and g_ early 1880s, when Peirce affirms individuality apart from generality g^ through a reconception of the index and the second category (Short a 2007, pp. 46-5 1).3 The second error is corrected in 1903 when Peirce ^ states that the interpretant need not be actual; it can be potential, tak- 2 ing the form of a would be (Short 2007, pp. 53-56). According to £ Short s preferred terminology, this entails that significance is a type of ^ possible interpretant or grounded interpretability. Finally, the third flaw £ is eliminated in 1907, when Peirce explicitly argues that the ultimate g logical interpretant of an intellectual sign is not a sign, but a habit of 3 action (or habit-change). This is indeed a momentous revision, crucial ^ for the feasibility of Short s naturalistic approach. He identifies "Prag- gp matism" (MS 318) as the definite document of the change, but one 3 could argue that it is quite effectively expressed in the earlier "The Basis • of Pragmaticism" (MS 283), where Peirce states that "signs which g would be merely parts of an endless viaduct for the transmission of ^ idea-potentiality, without any conveyance of it into anything but sym- ™ bols, namely, into action or habit of action, would not be signs at all, w since they would not, little or much, fulfil the function of signs" (EP o 2:388 [c. 1906]). Interestingly, Peirce associates the need for such &gt; embodiment with growth, a connection that can help us to make sense of his somewhat vague talk of "development of concrete reasonable- ness" (see e.g. CP 5.3 [1902]). There are certainly other developments in Peirce s theory of signs that could be pointed out - for instance, the way such concepts as medium, collateral experience, universe of discourse, vagueness, and generality acquire new relevance in his thought as time marches on - but on the whole it would seem that Short has quite accurately pinpointed the major ruptures in the advance of Peirce s semeiotic. So sharply, perhaps, that one might criticise Short for tending to underestimate the relevance of certain continuities between the early and later semeiotic. No doubt, defenders of a unity interpretation of Peirce s semeiotic will find much to criticise in Shorts account, and not entirely without justification. Even if the existence of considerable changes in Peirce s thought over time is granted, Shorts account sometimes feels too straightforward, neglecting possible complications and problems. Here, the discussion ,</page><page sequence="4">c/3 will be limited to two emphases in his approach that may actually ¿h weaken the credibility of his principal line of argument. O Firstly, Short bypasses Peirces "On a New List of Categories" (1867) HH in favour of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy articles of 1868-9 (the f""1 so-called "cognition series"). Short (2007, p. 32). claims that the "New ^ List" is a stepping stone, rather than a keystone. This is bound to provoke ^ protests, for the "New List" is upheld by many leading commentators ^ (such as Joseph Ransdell and Andre de Tienne) as the foundational text ^ for the theory of signs. It is a point of view that is difficult to dismiss 7} lightly, as the "New List" provides a Kant-styled "derivation" of the basic r concepts of the theory of categories and semeiotic in one brilliant, albeit dense and often enigmatic, package. Nowhere else does Peirce perform such a feat with equal force. Short dismisses the "New List" too hastily, enabling the defenders of a unity view to say that the developmental camp has simply neglected the true core of Peirces semeiotic. However, Short may also be ignoring something that could have strengthened his approach. Without going into details here, it is possi- ble to maintain that the "New List" is not only incompatible with the mature semeiotic in certain respects; it also differs from the cognition series. The "New List" presents a hermetic account, in which represen- tation (or reference to an interpretant) is required to bring a manifold of impression to unity (W 2:54 [1867]), whereas the sign in the cogni- tion series is markedly open-ended. While the "New List" places the emphasis on the unity of subject and object in propositional under- standing, the Journal of Speculative Philosophy articles defer meaning to future interpretants. Indeed, the concept of interpretant may provide a different perspective on Peirce s development; it is at least worth noting that it disappears from Peirces vocabulary after the 1860s, only to resurface as a rather different beast in the mature semeiotic.4 Another thing worth noting is that the New List is one of very few places where Peirce offers a kind of exposition for how one of his most central concepts, the triadic sign relation, is attained. Yet another way to look at Peirce s development would be to compare this to a rather differ- ent "derivation" in "Pragmatism" (MS 318 [1907]), in which the basic semiotic elements are presented as abstractions culled from an analysis of the central ingredients of ordinary communication. Short (2007, p. 186) briefly notes this later approach, but he does not afford it much weight, possibly because of its anthropomorphic implications (see the next sec- tion). However, one could argue that this communicational starting point, from which generalisations can be made, indicates a sense in which semeiotic can be said to be a philosophical science based on ordinary experience, but still able to provide "statements [. . .] as to what must be the characters of all signs used by a 'scientific intelligence', that is to say, by an intelligence capable of learning by experience" (CP 2.227 [c. ^ 1897]), highly fallible as such assertions always are.5</page><page sequence="5">Another feature of Short's developmental account that may prove D problematic is the emphasis on the index as an engine of major trans- &lt; formations. He suggests that it is the discovery of the index in the 1880s ^ that enables Peirce to state that to "make sense of our experience of 3 things as existing in space and time, we need to admit a dimension of g experience other than conceptual thought, a dimension consisting of ^ that which is not at all general" (Short 2007, pp. 39-40) . This also 5 entails the recognition that the actual world cannot be distinguished g from a world of imagination by general signs alone; for that, indices are needed (W 5:163-4 [1885]). Furthermore, Short claims that the new ^ conception of indexicality leads to a transformation of the category of * relation into full-blooded secondness. a This account needs to be qualified in certain respects. First of all, ^ the index is not an innovation of the 1880s. Of course, Short means to 8 say that the concept of index that Peirce elaborates is new, although the £ term is old; but there is more continuity here than Short recognises. j£ For instance, in a text from 1866 Peirce defines the index as a sign that g "indicates the existence of the [object] without noting any characters of g it" (W 1:355). This suggests that Peirce is gradually moved to certain 3 modifications of his semeiotic, partly because the idea of index he ^ more or less vaguely has been groping for does not fit into the picture, 5t but not because of a discovery of a radically new concept of index in 3 the 1880s. For the same reason, the claim that the new "idea of indexicality g required a reconception of the category that in the 'New List' was % known as 'relation'" (Short 2007, p. 49) is debatable. The process is "\ more complex, involving, among other things, a reassessment of the w doctrine of immediate perception, new conceptions of realism and o nominalism, and so on. It would seem more appropriate to say that the &gt; major breakthrough of the 1880s is the recognition of the autonomy of secondness - that is, of secondness as something that can be experienced, but not thought or cognised, apart from representation. These qualifications do not, however, affect Short's central point: Peirce's early theories of categories and signs encounter serious difficul- ties when they try to account for individuality (or singularity); and the modifications that begin to emerge in the 1880s can be viewed as implicit responses to these problems. Anthropomorphism Avoided? Let us move on to a different issue, which can conveniently be expressed as a question: is it possible to have a non-anthropomorphic con- ception of sign and to construct a non-anthropomorphic theory of signs? This problem seems to worry Short to some extent. There are four occurrences of "anthropomorphism" or "anthropomorphic" in Peirce's Theory of Signs, all of them somewhat warily referring to a position with .</page><page sequence="6">oo which Short does not seem to want to be associated (see Short 2007, £ pp. 11, 151, 175,300). O This is to be expected. Given that Short wishes to present Peirces ^ theory of signs as a both naturalistic and scientific enterprise, the key f""1 terms of which must credibly span the nonhuman as well as the human ^ (Short 2007, p. 151), he faces the very real possibility that he will be ^ accused of anthropomorphism. And of course, if we by "anthropomor- ^ phism" understand an uncritical tendency to project human character- ful istics into nonhuman nature, then it is imperative to point out that the */J theory Short defends does not fall into that trap. However, there is a r different way to conceive of anthropomorphism, in view of which all theories - and perhaps the theory of signs in particular - are anthro- pomorphic. What makes this particularly interesting is that Peirce defends this point of view in his mature writings. Here, the question may be restricted to the basic problem of how to defend the general application of semiotic concepts, such as sign, object, and interpretant. Short argues that the broad application of semeiotic terms, beyond the confines of human sign use, can only be motivated by "its success in enabling us to see facts not heretofore noted, in this case, continuities" (Short 2007, p. 151). That is, the con- nection between human and nonhuman sign processes cannot be sim- ply proclaimed; it needs to be established through inquiry. This seems reasonable; but does it free us from anthropomorphism? How can it, since we must pursue our inquiries using signs tainted by human con- struction and employment? So, are we then hopelessly divorced from a true understanding of the nonhuman sphere of signs, if indeed it makes sense to speak of such a thing? Well, Peirce does not think so; yet, he vigorously affirms anthro- pomorphism. For instance, he states that "we ought not to think that what are signs to us are the only signs; but we have to judge signs in general by these" (NEM 4:297 [c. 1903]). Furthermore, he claims that "a man could not have any idea that was not anthropomorphic, and that it was simply to repeat the error of Kant to attempt to escape anthropomorphism" (NEM 4:313 [c. 1906]). Peirce argues that the attempt to escape anthropomorphism leads to a postulation of things-in-themselves, things beyond the reach of human inquiry. Translated into semeiotic, this entails that we must set out from the hypothesis that signs in general, human and nonhuman, are at least similar to such human signs that we know well from every- day experience - because in philosophy, there really is no better start- ing point. Perhaps this explains why Peirce, in his mature semeiotic, suggests that the signs we know best, and from which our theory of signs should start, are signs in ordinary communication. At least, such an approach fits his dictum that philosophy is a science based upon g0g ordinary experience, in which we "must not begin by talking of pure</page><page sequence="7">ideas, - vagabond thoughts that tramp the public roads without any D human habitation, - but must begin with men and their conversation" &lt; (CP 8.112 [c. 1900]). £ Does not this common-sensical starting-point for semeiotic clash with 3 Short s naturalistic point of view, which shies away from acts of "gross g anthropomorphism"? And does not Peirce s claim that a human being ^ cannot mean anything that transcends the limits of his or her "possible 5 practical experience" (CP 5.536 [c. 1905]) entail an appalling sop to Cer- g berus? Not necessarily. Firstly, as so often, it is important to emphasise that Peirce speaks of possible practical experience, which may be translated 3 as conceivable experience of a pragmatic kind. Secondly, it is clear that g. common sense is only a starting point; the expansion of semeiotic from a familiar signs to cover all signs is an abductive hypothesis, which needs to *% be specified or corrected, possibly leading to a conception of "sign" that £5 differs from common usage. But that does not mean that the concept so £ acquired would not be anthropomorphic in a certain sense. Short may be ^ unnecessarily wary of some of the anthropomorphic implications of his g own position; the attempt to escape anthropomorphism may lead to a g rather barren conflict between naturalism and idealism, arguably one of 3 the major quasi-Cartesian sources of philosophical debate today - one ^ that pragmatism may be able to overcome. ^ In the end, how could we ever talk about something that bears no 3 connection to our experience? Yet, the inevitable anthropomorphic « taint does not require anthropocentrism. We must pursue our inquiries g with the hope - for Peirce, perhaps more of a conviction - that our ^ minds are so endowed that they are capable of understanding the work- ™ ings of nonhuman signs based on our own experience of semiotic phe- w nomena; there is no other way. This hope or hypothesis is greatly o fortified by Short s sophisticated naturalism. Proved it is not. &gt; The Plurality of Purposes As a final comment on Shorts rich volume, I wish to highlight a pro- posed improvement of Peirce s theory. It is controversial, but may prove to be highly relevant for future attempts to develop and apply semeiotic. Short argues that philosophers, including Peirce, are mistaken in thinking that every purpose must be conscious; "purpose is a type of outcome for which an agent acts or for which something was selected as a means" (Short 2007, p. 1 10). A signs significance is its bearing on the purposes, practical or not, oí possible interpreters - and purpose thus conceived is not strictly speaking dependent upon an individual mind (ibid., p. 289). Short asserts that the purposefulness of semiosis is "rooted in the interpreter, not in signs or their objects" (p. 171). This, in itself, is a strong stance in Peirce-inspired semeiotic; it is clearly opposed to positions that emphasise the autonomy of the semiotic process and connect teleology to the object.6 ,~-</page><page sequence="8">Short, more emphatically than anyone before, brings out the cen- trality of purpose for semeiotic. But he does more than that, for he amends the Peircean position when he states that we need "to allow dis- tinct final interpretants of a given sign [. . .] relative to the different pur- poses for which that same sign may be interpreted" (Short 2007, p. 190). Short claims that Peirce erroneously asserts that each sign has one final interpretant, because Peirce has only one purpose in mind, that of knowing reality. Almost accidentally, Short here suggests a shift of emphasis from grammar to rhetoric, for his proposal opens the doors to a moderate plu- ralism that Peirce s semeiotic arguably needs, if it is ever to be applicable in real-life inquiry in fields where purposes and values are very much at stake, and "knowing reality" is far more troublesome than it might seem from a philosophical vantage point. Communication studies springs to mind; but Short s stance should come as a relief to those struggling to force interpretation of art works into the model of one true reality as well. More broadly, I think that Short s emendation of Peirce s theory of signs brings it down to a level where its connection to ethics and esthet- ics becomes crucial. It is a question of self-control in view of purposes and ideals, but possibly in a more nuanced setting than the one provided by Peirce.7 The growth of concrete reasonableness is a fine general ideal, but in the end we need to ask what it entails with respect to different uni- verses of discourse and domains of practice. One challenge, with which Short leaves us, is how to handle problems of divergent - seemingly incommensurable - purposes and valuations in a Peircean framework. Shorts suggestion that feelings, actions, and signs are subject to cor- rection in a manner analogous to the improvement of scientific theories may lead us in the right direction; certainly, we should not take the affir- mation of pluralism to entail a wholesale rejection of objectivity and a turn to relativism. However, Shorts (2007, p. 345) claim that this rectifi- cation takes places through collateral experience is somewhat difficult to grasp.8 In my opinion, inquiry into valuations can hardly be a strictly empirical matter; here, the need for something that could be called nor- mative rhetoric, closely connected to ethics and primarily concerned with the use of signs, becomes evident. I believe that Peirces Theory of Signs helps prepare the way for such an endeavour in a truly Peircean spirit, whether this is the authors conscious purpose or not.

One can only hope for the publication of a similar tome by Joseph Ransdell, whose approach to Peirce offers the clearest alternative to Shorts interpretation. 3. In view of Peirce s mature terminology, in which individuality and definite- ness are defined as two forms of singularity, and distinguished from the two com- plementary forms of indeterminacy, i.e. indefiniteness and generality, it might be better to say that he affirms the existence of singulars apart from the reality of gen- erals. Short does not discuss these terminological developments. 4. For a discussion of these developments, see Bergman 2003. 5. See Bergman 2004 for a fuller analysis of this approach. 6. For a statement of the autonomy thesis, see Ransdell 1992. 7. Of course, choosing suitable sources, Peirce s conception of normative sci- ence can be interpreted charitably, leaving room for reasonable pluralism; but we may need to part ways with the Peirce that proclaims that life "can have but one end" (CP 2.198 [1902]). Furthermore, in the future it may become necessary to consider whether certain studies in semeiotic do not require a reconsideration of the Peircean hierarchy of the normative sciences. 8. Shorts (2007) definition of collateral experience as consisting in "an interpre- tation of diverse signs as being signs of the same object" (pp. 102-103) offers an indication of what he has in mind; it is, however, a bit unfortunate as it strips Peirce s concept of its experiential and contextual dimensions by making collateral experi- ence consist of an interpretative act. Moreover, the suggestion that values are dynam- ical objects, waiting to be discovered in a convergent process of inquiry, needs to be spelled out in detail, and most likely qualified in various ways. Constructivism can be pernicious, but so can objectivism; it may turn out to be a quasi-scientific legiti- mation for something that is at least partly a constructive activity. , (2004), Fields of Signification: Explorations in Charles S.
