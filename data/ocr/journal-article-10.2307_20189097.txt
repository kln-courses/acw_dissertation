<plain_text><page sequence="1">151 New Greek Inscriptions from Pelagonia and Derriopos During my travels in northern part of Macedonia since 1981 for the preparation of the corpus of Greek and Latin inscriptions of that region, undertaken under the guidance of Prof. Fanoula Papazoglou, I have recorded a number of unpublished inscribed and uninscribed monuments. In advance of the corpus volume, I shall present here a few of the better preserved ones. I. MARKOVA VAROS (MARKOV GRAD) On the slopes of a hill rising above the old quarter of the town of Prilep (known under its popular name Markova Varo?) and crowned by the medieval citadel Markovi Kuli (Marko's Towers), archaeological investigation uncovered vestiges of a small Hellenistic settlement from the fourth and third centuries BC. The richest finds were made round places called Zagrad,1 Daboilc and Pod Kuli.2 The life of this community continued into the Roman period as well. In Zagrad, at a distance of about 300-400 m north-east of the medieval fortress, there was a rich necropolis belonging to a bigger settlement, most probably ancient Ceramiae mentioned in the Peutinger Table among other stations on the road between Stobi and Heraclea.3 The site of Ceramiae itslef could have been located at a place called Kabanja, north-east of Markova Varo5, known for its architectural material, marble fragments of an ancient temple and .an Early Christian basilica, altars and funerary stelae.4 Another rich necropolis from the third and fourth centuries AD was unearthed a place called Karata?, about 500 m north of VaroS5 and a third one at Bakalica, two kilometres north-east of the railway station. Inscriptions preserved in various churches in Markova Varos belong to one of these sites once forming part of the urban territory of ancient Ceramiae.6 In the courtyard of the St.Nicholas' Church in Markova VaroS is the following unpublished sepulchral monument. 1 At Zagrad, near a place called Kaldrma or Padarnica, excavations conducted in 1968 produced a necropolis with thirty-five graves chronologically situated from the end of the fifth to the end of the fourth centuries BC.

TRESKAVEC MONASTERY In the immediate vicinity of medieval Treskavec Monastery, six kilometres north-west of Prilep, on a plateau at the foot of the imposing mountain summit Zlatovrv (1250 m), traces of a small Hellenistic settlement whith life continuing well into the Roman period have been discovered. At a place called Gumenje, 300 m south of the monastery, a big necropolis with sixteen graves dating from the Hellenistic to the Later Roman period has been throughly explored.7 In Late Antiquity, the summit of Zlatovrv was strengthened by a stronghold. Several inscriptions found near the medieval church indicate that in the Roman period the site was occupied by two sanctuaries: one consecrated to a local Apollo with the epithet attested in three forms: 'Oxe\)5aviK?c, 'Ore\)8av?c, 'Et?\)8cxv?ckoc, and the second to Ephesian Artemis. One of the inscriptions records the name of the settlement - KoAo?otien.8 Other finds, such as a torso of a cult statue, parts of an .architrave slab, altars and columns of an ancient temple, bring additional evidence of the existence of a pagan sanctuary replaced in the fifth century AD by an Early Christian basilica. Ten years ago, the following sepulchral monument was unearthed at the above-mentioned place called Gumenje. 2. Marble stele broken above, with tenon to insert in ground below.

The following unpublished funerary monument is serving as the altar in the local church. 3. Marble bomos with moulding on top, partly buried below under cement floor. Ht. 0,95; width 0,42; thickness 0,28. Above inscription are two panels with reliefs. In the upper one, executed in the form of a niche, there is a bearded horseman in tunic and mantle, galopping to the rright; his right hand is raised and fingers clenched as if holding a spear or a javelin; to his right, a spear, to his left a small figure holding the horse's tail with his left, and a stick in his right hand. The lower panel contains a relief showing three draped busts: a woman and two bearded men. Only the first line of inscription is visible. Letters 0,02-0,025. (Tafel Xm). Second century AD. Aay?ac Oua?,r|Toc Mapicov Although fragmentary, this inscription merits attention because of the name Aay?ac,9 which, to my knowledge, has not been previously attested in Greek inscriptions. The only parallels I could find come from Celtic, where we meet forms Dag-anus, Dagan-ia, Dag o(n), Dagd? = *Dago-devo-s "good god", Dagdae Mor = *dago-deivos maros "the big good god", Dagda Dagdae (mase), Dagda (fern.), etc.10 developped from roots dago - "good" and dagh -"cunning, clever".11 If this name is really of Celtic origin, it is not isolated in Macedonian onomasticon. There is a close resemblance between this monument and the decoration of a monument from the near-by village of Raklje.12 9 On the photograph it looks as if the fourth letter in this name is a lambda; a close inspection ascertained beyond doubt that it was, in fact, a delta with a clear but shallow horizontal cut. 10 AHolder, Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz, Erster Bd., A-H, Leipzig 1896 (Nachdruck 1961), col. 1214 1216. Some of these forms are attested only in later periods. 11 Likewise, on one inscription from the village of Ahmetler on the Bithynian-Phrygian border, we have the name Xpfjctoc Accyi, where the father's name is obviously formed from the same root Aay- (S.?ahin, Festschrift D?rner II, 1978, EPRO 66, 2, p.775). The suffix -?ac is encountereed in Greek names. 12 N.Vulic, Spomenik 98, no.377.</page><page sequence="4">154 M.Ricl I-II. In the same church in the village of Toplica I was shown a fully dressed statuette 0,30 m high (Tafel XIV) and an uninscribed marble stele with a triangular pediment and panel displaying four draped busts: three male and one female (Ht. 1,26; width 0,66; thickness 0,12) (Tafel XIV). IV. NIKODIN N.Vulic published one uninscribed stele from the village of Nikodin north of Toplica.13 Two Roman necropoleis have been discovered at places called Glogovac (Glogovica) and Nerezinje, while an Early Christian basilica still partly survives at a place called Zelkoec,14 confirming the existence of a small Roman settlement in this part of Pelagonia. In the Prilep museum are the following three unpublished monuments from the village of Nikodin. 4, Inv.no. 3613. Found at a place called Antoi gramadi. Marble stele with triangular pediment and side acroteria; within the pediment palmette. Ht. 1,25; width 0,59; thickness 0,12.

This funerary stele was erected by evocatus16 Publius Aelius Marcellinus, the first member of his family to be promoted to Roman citizenship after serving in the army in Emperor Hadrian's reign.17 Marcellinus' father was Taioc Aiov?voc ?', which means that Marcellinus was sixth in his family line, and that the name Aiovvc was hereditary on his father's side. This name is already found in Macedonia on inscriptions from Styberra18 and Kavadarci.19 The common forms of the genitive case are Aiov? and Aiovvoc. In our case, the form Aiov?voc proves the existence of a nasal declension of the same name.20 Forms iepiioc and yovf|a)v derive from poetry and occur frequently in verse epitaphs. Marcelinus' father Gaius was a priest of Dionysus, whose cult was very prominent in northern Macedonia.21 However, this is the first time a priest of this cult appears on .an epigraphic monument. Theophoric names in this family may point to heredit-ary priesthood of Dionysus. III. Inv.no.3617. Found at a place called Brezje. White limestone stele with triangular pediment and side acroteria (the left one is broken); within the pediment rosette. Ht. 1,22; width 0,50; thickness 0,14. On the shaft, in a sunk panel, representation of a funeral feast with four men on the couch and two women beside them, sitting in armchairs; in front of the couch there is a three-legged table with food on it. Below that, a smaller panel with two figures: a child on a sort of pedestal and a man. Inscription was never engraved.

Back in 1928, N.Vulic organized excavations at the near-by site called GradiSte. He discovered a polygonal fortification (175 x 157 m) built towards the end of the third century BC and provided with strong walls 2,5 m thick in places. There were two circular towers and a gate on its east side, and another gate on the west side. The enclosed space contained modest living quarters for the military personnel. The whole complex was continually in use until the first century AD. In the Early Byzantine times it was restored and put to its former use again.22 The three monuments published here can be seen at the Eastern Gate of the fortress.23 6.

MARIO VO The remote and wooded region of Mariovo (in older literature called Morihovo) is a large tableland in the Crna Reka valley (anc. Erigon), one thousend metres above sea level. Ancient sites reported and unsistematically explored indicate that it was more densely populated ain antiquity than today. The prosperity of these ancient settlements was based on exploitation of forests and mineral resources. Somewhere in this region one should look for the site of the ancient town of Pelagonia.24 DUNJE AND PEStANI In the north-western part of Mariovo, between the villages of Dunje and PeStani, at a place called GradiSte, vestiges of an important ancient settlement have been found. The finds include a marble statue, stelae with inscriptions and reliefs, votive altars.25 Two inscriptions from Dunje and PeStani mention a community called Aoctovecov t? koiv?v.26 F.Papazoglou believes that this koiv?v could be traced back to tribal origins; gradually, it evolved into a union of several rur.al communities governed by a council. The following funerary inscription is built upside down into the southern wall of the St. Dimitrios' Church in the village of Dunje. In 1981, when I first saw it, it was completely covered with plaster and illegible. Today, it is cleaned, but still difficult to read. 24 I.Mikul&amp;c, Staroto rudarstvo kaj Vitoliste, Stremez, XIII, 7,1967,46-53; A.Keramid&amp;ev, Za staroto rudarstvo vo Mariovo, I, Mac.Acta Arch. 2,1976,237-249; idem, Mac.Acta Arch. 4,1978,113-126; Papazoglou, Villes p.284-5; 288-291. 25 G.Kazarow, BCH 47,1923,288-9; N.Vulic, Spomenik 71, nos.383-388; 437-444; 642; TIR K 34, s. vv.

ZAGORANI On the western outskirts of the village of Zagorani, at a place called Latinska crkva (Latin church), there is a medieval church built in the fourteenth century and dedicated to St. Nicholas. Inside the church and in its walls, one can see a number of ancient monuments, including a female statue with its head broken off,28 columns, altars, stelae.29 VI. N.Vulic published a fragment of a Latin inscription (BASILI ?) engraved on a white marble block (ht. 0,50; width 0,32; monumental apiced letters 0,10 high) built into the northern wall of the church. It is probably because of this fragmentary inscription that the church received its current appellation. N.Vulic never published the photograph of this block, and I would like to use this opportunity to publish the photograph taken last year. (Tafel XVH). The village of Zagorani is just a few kilometres east of the village of Cepigovo which occupies the site of ancient Styberra. Accordingly, it is a plausible hypothesis that all the monuments in Latinska crkva were brought from the archaeological site. This is, at any rate, 28 Transferred to the Archaeological Museum in Skopje. 29 Cf. N.Vulic, Spomenik 71, no.390; id. Arch.Karte p.51; TIR 34, s.v.

Monuments set up by the members of the same family were discovered in the course of excavations in the village of ?epigovo conducted by Yugoslav archaeologists in 1953 and 1959.30 Investigations on the same site were resumed in 1983 and 1984 during conservation work on Bedem, the hill on whose terraced slopes once rose the ancient town of Styberra.31 In what is referred to by archaeologists as the "sector B", excavations conducted in 1953 brought to light a square apsidal building of modest dimensions (10 x 10 m), with entrance on the north side. Inscriptions found on the spot showed that it had been a temple in antis didecated to the goddess Tyche. Eight inscriptions were discovered in the building itself, of which six were engraved on marble plinths serving as statue bases in six niches in the eastern, northern and southern wall. The largest niche was in the eastern wall, where archaeologists discovered a semi-circuit block which covered its apsidal part, still standing in situ. On the marble plinth in the same niche (length 2,45; ht. 0,37; thickness 0,80) is engraved the longest inscription, recording the will of Anthestia Fusca and her donation for the reconstruction of the temple (AD 126/7).32 She bequeathed a special fund instructing her heirs to build a statue of the goddess and busts of herself and members of her family - her husband L.Teifanius Pudens and her children - L.Teifanius Fuscus, Teifania Anthestia and Teifania Nike. The six inscriptions - the one making note of her testamentary dispositions and the five with the names of her family members - were all engraved at the same time and 30 Cf.

Concerning Titus Flavius Hyginus and his sons Teifanius, Dionysius and Philoxenus, one can assume that they were freedmen in the two prominent and closely connected local families mentioned above. The father's name Hyginus, a very common servile name,34 as well as Dionysius1 nomen, different from his father's, speak in favour of such assumption. Dionysius and Philoxenus were a freedman and a slave, respectively (no nomen in Philoxenus' name!), in the Teifanii household, whereas Hyginus gained his freedom after serving in the family of T.Flavius Philoxenus.35 Close ties between the two prominent families in Styberra are thus additionally corroborated by the newly found inscription from Zagorani. VIH. ALINCI A few kilometres east of the village of Zagorani is located the village of Alinci. In the Prilep Museum is preserved the following monument found at a place called BostaniSte in this village. 13. Crudely shaped sepulchral monument broken above. Ht. 1,21; width 0,60; thickness 0,08.

Papazoglou, Chiron 18,1988,239 no.6 and 254-255 note 71).

Unearthed by chance below the village of Oreovec and damaged by ploughing. Marble funerary stele. Ht. 1,09; width 0,60; thickness 0,18. Relief in a sunk panel on the shaft consists of three standing and fully dressed figures: a bearded man with a papyrus scroll in his right hand, a boy, and a veiled woman.

Another stele similarly shaped and of similar dimensions from the village of Brailovo, is stored in the Prilep Museum.37 The monument published here under No. 13 and the two last stelae present a welcome addition to the already published amorphous and anthropomorphic stelae frequently encountered in ancient Pelagonia and Lyncestis. 36 Similar monuments were found in the villages of Martolci (Spomenik 71, no.76), Mokreni (ibid., no.75), between the villages of Krusevica and Orle (F.Papazoglou, 2iva Antika 27,1977,138-141, fig.3) (all three located in Pelagonia), .and on various locations in Lyncestis (?ivojno, Beranci: LMikulSic, Starinar N.S.
