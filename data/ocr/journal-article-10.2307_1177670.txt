<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Spirit World of the Bukidnon By VINCENT G. CULLON, S. J. Kalabugao, Impasug-ong, Bukidnon, Philippines The following is a brief and in complete description of the spirit world of the Bukidnon of the upper Pulangi river valley. The Bukidnon are a minority group living mainly in the uplands and mountains of the provinces of Agusan, Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Some of the information was obtained from Mr. Pablo Salonca, a resident of Kalabugao, Impasugong, Bukidnon, and a shaman, and some was obtained from Mr. Sixto Dahino of Dumalaguing, Impasugong, Bukidnon, and some from personal observation. The world, as the Bukidnon of the upper Pulangi river valley knows it, is peopled by a host of spirits or invisible beings; some beneficent, some neutral and some malignant, all of whom must be propitiated or guarded against. Invisible beings is probably a better term than spirits, since the Bukidnon do not have a clear idea of spirit, and all these beings are thought to have bodies of an invisible and different kind. Some are described as large and others as small, and it is believed that they partake of the sacrifices offered them by feasting on the scent. In general it can be said that the Bukidnon idea of the spirit world is anthropomorphic in that they, the spirits, share human characteristics and are dealt with accordingly. To some extent the spirit world seems to reflect the social structure of the Bukidnon in its mixture of personal freedom and respect for and dependence on clan leaders, war leaders and chieftains.

The supreme being: In the upper Pulangi river valley there does seem to be a notion of one supreme being, but it is not certain whether or not this is due to the influence of Christianity. I am inclined to believe that Christianity has at least modified the notion. The name given to the supreme being is magbabdya/, which comes from the root bayd/ meaning 'to will, rule or own'. The form magbabdya/ seems to be plural, for in Binukid the reduplication is sometimes used to denote the plural. The name magbabdya/ seems to be a shortened form of hdri/hu magbabdya/ 'king of the rulers', and thus magbabdya/ is considered the lord of the ruling or guardian spirits. He is also known as kapitdn hu mga tumdnod, 'leader of the spirit com- panions'. Thus magbabdya/ who lives in heaven, whcih is above, is the maker of the universe and the lord of the lesser spirits, though it is not certain that he is the creator of those spirits. He is an omniscient and all powerful being, who rewards and punishes, but who is thought of as rather remote from human affairs. Along with the titles magbabdya/ or hdri/ hu magbabdya/ there often occur in the ceremonial chants the names: migsdlsal. miglimbag and migtanghdga. These names are derived from the roots, sdlsal 'forge', limbag 'form' and tanghag 'make present by preternatural power'. The titles seem to refer to the creation of the universe. 1. The mark / indicates the glottal stop. 18</page><page sequence="3">THE SPIRIT WORLD OF THE BUKIDNON The Bukidnon who claim that magbabdya/ is the one supreme being, the dios of the Visayan lowlanders, explain that the titles, migsdlsal, miglim bag and migtanghcga are merely poetic names used to describe magbabdya/. Granted that it is common in the ceremonial chants to use different descriptive titles in addressing a spirit, still I am not certain that it is really clear in the minds of the Bukidnon that those four names refer to the same being. The best we can do at present is to describe the Bukidnon spirit world as a modified monotheism with magbabdya/, the supreme being as primus inter pares, or probably better as a gradated poly- theism. Even if magbabdya/ is thought to be the supreme being in some sense, he is not the main recipient of cult, for while he is invoked in most of the ceremonies, it is the migbayd/, the ruling or guardian spirit of the place, object or action, who, being closer at hand and more involved, is the main recipient of the cult. II. Guardian spirits of places, action and things: A. Migbayd/: This is a populous, powerful class of beneficent spirits who rule over the different parts of the universe, and the objects and actions of men. There seems to be but one migbayd/ for each part of the universe and each type of object or action. For example; there is a migbayd/ hu wdhig 'ruler of water'; a migbayd/ hu kdyu 'ruler of trees'; a migbayd/ hu mamdiin2 'ruler of betelnut'. There is a migbayd/ hiu bu 'ruler of the hearth'. For certain actions there are also ruling spirits, for example; migbayd/ hu pagsakiim 'ruler of the clearing of land'; migbayd/ hu panghdbul 'ruler of blanket weaving', and migbayd/ hu pangdsu 'ruler of hunting'. There is also one ruling spirit of all men, migbayd/ hu iitao, who seems to be distinct from the guardian spirits of individuals. The individual names of the migbayd/ are descriptive and are taken from the place, object or action they rule. Thus the mig- bayd/ of land clearing is called ibabdsiik, from bdsiik to clear the land of vegetation. The relationship between the migbayd/ and mnagbabdya/ is not very clear except that the migbayd/ are con- sidered the sulugt-iin hu magbabdya/ 'the servants of magbabdya/'; and their power is thought to be derived from him. Even though 2. The letter ii refers to the high mid-back unrounded vowel which is phonemic in Binukid. 19</page><page sequence="4">VINCENT G. CULLEN, S. J. the power of the migbayd/ is derived from and inferior to that of magbabdya/, the migbayd/ seem to exercise sovereign power within their own domain. This may be the reason they are accorded a more important place in the ceremonies than magbabdya/. The migbayd/ are beneficent, but will punish by causing crop failure or sickness if the irdomain is entered or tampered with, unless their permission and assistance are first requested by the offering of sacrifice. The migbayd/ are invoked by means of the sacrifice of pigs or chickens, and other food. For example, before the clearing of land the sacrificial ceremony known as panalabu'gta/ is performed in honor of the migbayd/ hu pagsakiim, ibabasiik. In this ceremony a chicken is killed and eaten in honor of the spirit, whose assistance and protection are sought to insure a good harvest. In case there is punishment for failure to make the initial appro- priate sacrifice, then the sacrificial ceremony known as manaluhida or nmanuihid 'asking pardon', is performed. B. Tiniamdnliiwa: Unlike the migbayd/ who rule or own certain parts of the universe, certain objects and actions, but do not reside in them, and it is not very clear where the migbayd/ do reside, the timamcnuwa are localized spirits who reside in particular places, especially balcte trees, cliffs, large stones and the confluence of streams, but do not rule or own the whole class of such objects. The timamdnuwa seem to be the equivalent of the incdnto of the lowland Visayans. The root of timamdnuwa appears to be derived from the roots, timna 'dwell' and bdnuwa 'settlement', and thus the timamdnuwa are the indwellers. According to one legend, the tinmamdnuwa live in these places as a punishment from magbabdya/, because in the olden times they refused to believe that they would be taken up to heaven in a special caromdta 'cart'. So they were left behind to inhabit wild places. While not regarded as beneficent, they are not really malignant either. Rather they are described as makaddniit bdsta hadi/ pakayiikiin 'can cause harm if not pro- pitiated'. Consequently people passing their abodes will ask for pity or make some small offering of food. They can cause sickness by imprisoning the soul, in which case a sacrifice is required. This punishment is called hdbay and it is one of the main functions of the surojdno 'medicine man' to diagnose the source of the hdbay and prescribe the suitable sacrifice. The following story illustrates the attitude of the people towards the timamdnuwa. Bunlagayan creek just north of barrio 20</page><page sequence="5">THE SPIRIT WORLD OF THE BUKIDNON Kalabugao gets its name from a nearby balete tree, supposedly in- habited by a powerful timamdnuwa, tagbuldgay 'one who makes a noise like an explosion'. People say that the noise is made by the timamdnuwa shooting at sickness to drive it out of the barrio. For years no one would claim the land around the balete tree out of fear of the timamdnuwa, until Mr. Sixto Dahino took it. He wanted to have the balete tree cut down to make room for planting, but the people were afraid to touch it. In such cases if someone can be found to cut down a balete tree it is customary for the cutter to say: "habdyan si juan, iydn migsugu let the punishment fall on Juan, he ordered it". Mr. Dahino did get one other man to help him, and after they both recited some Christian prayers they cut it down. Some months after Mr. Dahino did develop a rheumatic condition in his right arm, and although he doesn't believe that the illness had anything to do with the balete tree as he still farms there, the people of Kalabugao believe that it was a punishment from the timamdnuwa. Whether Mr. Dahino's helper used the above formula under his breaths is not known. III. Personal guardian spirits: There are a number of personal guardian spirits; spirits who guard or enlighten an individual or who mediate between the man and the more powerful spirits. A. Tumanod: The first class of personal guardian spirits is the tumdnod. The word means "companion" from the root tdnod 'accompany'. This class is also called insaliingdna or indiingan. The tumdnod is a benificent spirit companion given to each person at the time of his birth according to the more prevalent belief, although some think that only adults or only the great have tumdanod. If someone shows special ability in any field of endeavor he is said to be tumanoddn, 'inhabited or influenced by a tumdnod' because it is the tumdnod which confers special ability on his charge. The tumdnod is supposed to communicate with its charge in dreams and thus assist him. One's own tumdnod and the tumdnod of the great men of the past are invoked in the cere- monies. A dalisay ha tumdnod is an especially powerful tumdnod. B. Mi ilmz-lilin: This is a class of beneficent guardian spirits whose function is to teach or enlighten; the name being derived 21</page><page sequence="6">VINCENT G. CULLEN, S. J. from the root uilin 'teach'. The mulin-tulin is said to begin to accompany its charge either from the time of birth or when its charge first gives signs of learning. When a child shows special aptitude for learning he is said to be tagulindn ha bdta/ "a child possessed of a mnilin-uilin. Thus the mulin-ulin, which is described by Mr. Pablo Salonca as small in size, accompanies its charge all through life acting as its teacher and guide. C. Espiritu: This is another class of beneficent spirit companions which accompany man throughout life, and are also called mamlilig 'helpers' from the root bizlig 'help'. Their main function is to act as messengers or intercessors with magbabdya/, making known the needs and sins, presumably to ask pardon, of its charge. According to Mr. Dahino the word espiritnt is merely a generic name for spirit when used around the poblacion of Impasugong. D. Dumnalongdong: This is a class of personal guardian spirits more powerful than the tncrmdod, and it is not certain that every- one possesses one, for while Mr. Salonca holds that everyone does, Mr. Dahino, who comes from a different barrio holds that only the powerful have dumalodlgdong, that is chieftains, war leaders, power- ful shamans or medicine men and generally people in authority. This class of spirits is invoked especially at the meetings of chief- tains, (law hadi/ ktty mahabdyan 'that we don't incur any punish- ment'. The (ldumalongdong can punish by causing sickness, and is believed to do so when a lack of respect is shown to its charge. Thus the chieftains invoke the dumalongdong at the time of their meetings to settle disputes, lest in the heat of argument should disrespect be shown, the victim's dumalongdong might punish the offender. IV. Malignant Spirits: Whereas the migbayd/ and the personal guardian spirits are beneficent and the timamdnuwa neutral, there is a host of malignant spirits that cause either fear or harm. A. Btisaw: This is a general term for malignant spirits, some of which live in the mountains, while others wander around the world causing sickness by capturing and oppressing the souls of men. 22</page><page sequence="7">THE SPIRIT WORLD OF THE BUKIDNON B. Kawd: In the Kalabugao area this term refers to a personal malignant soul-companion and also to the man's shadow, its manifes- tation. The kawd/ is of the same size as the man's shadow, but I could elicit no explanation as to why it grows and shrinks depend- ing on the position of the sun. The kawd/ accompanies a man thoughout his life, but apparently does him no harm during his lifetime. However after death the kawd/ remains about the grave, eats the body of the dead and frightens people. People say of the kawd/: "bdngon ka tuydna, tagaldpiin kid hu butsaw, tagpapamulin- ddwan kid hu buisaw hurry up leg or we will be confronted by a busaw, we are being caught by sunset, we will encounter a bzusaw". Around the poblacion Impasugong on the central plain, kawd/ simply means shadow, and the name of this class of spirits is the Visayan, Christian lowland dialect term for the human soul, kaldg. This last use of the term kaldg came as an unpleasant surprise to me, as I had for years exhorted a mixed Visayan and Bukidnon congregation to give a thought to the salvation of their kaldg, that is in the minds of the Bukidnon, their personal malignant spirit. In the Impasugong area it is thought that after a man's death the personal malignant spirit lives on in the grave and frightens people, but does not eat the body of the dead. C. Sumisigbat: This is a class of unclean spirits that can cause crop failure and sickness. It is also called sumasulimao, and bala- himbat. During certain sacrificial ceremonies, e.g. for the dead, the sumisigbat is given the feet or entrails of the chicken placed at a distance from the sacrificial table or outside the door of the house so that it won't approach the table and cause sickness. D. Sumdpay and ut-ut: These are classes of butsaw that eat people. E. Managkildwan: These are malignant spirits that eat people alive or raw as the root kilaw indicates. F. Twadhdngin: These are malignant spirits which appear in the form of beautiful women who reside on the top of Mt. Saldab. The twadhdngin have a preference for young men. If a man approaches their habitation carrying a bolo, the twadhdgin are said to insert the bolo in their vagina. The wind on Mt. Saldab is thought to come from the anus or vagina of the twadhdngin. G. Kuik-ktik: They are mischievious rather than malignant spirits, 23</page><page sequence="8">VINCENT G. CULLEN, S. J. whose name is derived from the noise they make. They are said to carry away children, but apparently do them no serious harm. A mute child of the barrio Dumalaguing, Impasugong, Bukidnon, was missing for several days, and when it was found, it indicated that it had been carried away by two kuik-ktik to a cave where it was given good food. A child of Impasugong was said to have been taken by a kuik-kutk, and when it was found, there were, as the story goes, marks all over the body where it had been licked by the kuik-kuik. H. Bdlbal: These are large buisaw that live in the mountains, but also roam around causing sickness. An alagdsi is a giant bdlbal that eats anything, cattle and men included. The dswang is the spirit dog belonging to the alagdsi and which is said to have the form of fire. This is the first spirit animal I have come across among the Bukidnon. V. The spirit of man: Man is composed of body, lawa, and spirit, gimokod. The soul is thought of in physical terms and even called the matuzud ha laiwa, the true body. It has the form and size of the man. The relationship of the soul to the body is like that of the body to the clothes it wears. When the body is weak it is thought that the soul has wandered, and there is a ceremony, gimokoddn, in which the soul is invoked and entreated to return to the body. When one is sick it is supposed that the the soul has been imprisoned in the habitation of a timamdnu'nwa or is under the power of a bisaw. The soul is also thought to travel in dreams. There is the story of a man from Impasugong who journeyed to Mt. Bala- tukan, an extinct volcano in Misamis Oriental and thought to be the home of departed souls, to search for the soul of his wife who was sick. He went to the great house of Gumigunal, as the story goes, and there found the soul of his wife in a bottle. He set it free and his wife recovered. At death the soul leaves the body as a man steps out of his clothes, and then goes to Mt. Balatukan, the abode of the dead. Such then is the spirit world of the Bukidnon, and his religion consists mainly in keeping on good terms with the various spirits, or re-establishing amicable relations if they have been severed through the breaking of a taboo. The dominant attitude is one of tdhud, respect mixed with fear, towards the spirits, except in the 24</page><page sequence="9">THE SPIRIT WORLD OF THE BUKIDNON case of the malignant spirits where it is mainly fear. This respect- ful relationship is maintained with magbabdya/, the migbayd/ and the timamdnuzwa by the offering of sacrifices before entering their domain. In the case of the guardian spirits of persons, the proper relationship is maintained by avoiding disrespect towords their charges and by invoking the tumdnod of famous men of old during the ceremonies. Protection against the malignant spirits is found in dnting-dnting, charms, and in recourse to one's own tumdnod, and, should sickness or calamity befall, in the propitiation of the malignant spirits by means of sacrifices. And so, these beliefs give the Bukidnon an explanation for the world forces whose workings he does not understand, and his ceremonies provide a means of dealing with them. While these beliefs do give him a sense of security amidst the uncertainties of life, they also tend to retard progress not only in the realm of religion, but since he does not make a very clear distinction be- tween the sacred and the profane, but also in the field of socio- economic development, which he believes to be ruled by the spirits too. So very often his response to a situation that requires change is simply; "hadi/ kud biydan sa dclan hu mga ldas I can't abandon the ways of my forefathers". 25</page></plain_text>
