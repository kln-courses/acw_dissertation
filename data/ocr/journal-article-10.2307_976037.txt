Although cross-disciplin- ary relations are in general positive and even necessary to creativity, it is time for a serious appraisal of the state of the administrative discipline, lest it become a mere hodge- podge of theoretical ramblings, lacking both force and di- rection. Any discipline must have a modicum of intoler- ance in its transactions with other disciplines, otherwise it will lose its reason to exist. To have identity and character is in a sense to be intolerant. This article submits that the extrapolative process, which I call misplacement of concepts, will render administrative theory characterless; it will be crippled if it continues to in- dulge in the practice of unqualified borrowing from other disciplines, theories, models and concepts alien to its spe- cific task. Basic Features of Theory Building Theory building in the administrative field has most fre- quently occurred as a result of (a) primary original crea- tion, (b) serendipity, and (c) displacement of concepts. It is not the intention of this writer to inquire into the complexities of conceptual creativity. Suffice it to say that a concept results from a primary act of creation when no antecedent of it is apparent, when it has been drawn from nothing but the direct personal transaction between the thinker's mind and the peculiar features of the issue or problem under attention. Thus, if we believe Cassirer, Montesquieu "is the first thinker to grasp and to express clearly the concept of 'ideal types' ".'2 With the systematic characteristics later attributed to it by Max Weber, this concept brought an unprecedented insight into the nature and meaning of theory building itself. However, concept formation usually results from serendipity and displace- ment of concepts, true original conceptual creation being more rare than is ordinarily admitted. As explained by Robert Merton, serendipity takes place when "an unexpected and anomalous finding elicits the in- vestigator's curiosity and (conducts) him along an unpre- meditated by-path which (leads) to a fresh hypothesis."' Serendipity in the administrative field is well illustrated by the so-called Hawthorne Studies. The original purpose of this research was to assess the effect of lighting on the worker's output. In a first attempt no significant relation- * This article argues that the field of administrative theory is losing sense of its specific objectives, by attempting to assimi- late models and concepts extraneous to its proper domain. In substantiating this argument, the writer discusses instances of "misplacement of concepts" current in the field of administra- tive theory, as they appear in the writings of several authors. ship was found between the two variables. This unexpected result led the researchers to pursue a thorough investiga- tion of the factors of efficiency, the outcome of which was the discovery that sentiments and informal relations be- tween the employees as well as their personal needs and so- cial conditions external to the organization have a sys- tematic influence on productivity. One can say that the efforts at evaluating and discussing the steps and results of the Hawthorne Studies led Fritz Roethlisberger and Wil- liam J. Dickson to an incipient formulation of what is now known as the systems approach. (This root of the systems approach has been overlooked by the chroniclers of the field.) A "logic of discovery"' can be formulated centered on the notion of displacement of concepts. Such is the en- deavor of Donald Schon in his book, Displacement of Concepts. "Emergence of concepts," Schon says, may "come through the shift of old concepts to new situa- tions. "5 By displacing a concept one tries to understand the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar, or the unknown in terms of the known. For instance, one example of displace- ment of concepts is found in the book The Principles of Organization by James D. Mooney and Alan C. Reiley. These authors did explicitly what others like Henri Fayol, Frederick Taylor, and Luther Gulick did implicitly: they deduced from existing historical models systematic guide- lines for organizations. Mooney and Reiley, systematically relying on a displacing attitude, formulated principles such Alberto Guerreiro Ramos is presently professor of public adminis- tration at the University of Southern California.

Another illustration of displacement of concepts is rep- resented by Karl Deutsch's The Nerves of Government. The main thrust of this book is to conceptualize the issues of political science from the "viewpoint of communica- tions"7, that is, by resorting to cybernetic models. In the field of organization theory the equivalent to Deutsch's work is certainly Social Psychology of Organizations by Daniel Katz and Robert L. Kahn, in which the main issues and problems of administration were woven into a cyber- netic fabric. Displacement Becomes Misplacement While the displacement of concepts can be a valuable, productive, and legitimate means of theory building in public administration, it can very easily degenerate into misplacement of concepts. Actually, misplacement of con- cepts is presently plaguing the field of administrative theory. Misplacement of concepts takes place when a theory, model, or concept of one phenomenon is extended to explain another. Such extension usually does not hold up after a thorough examination because those phenomena belong to distinct contexts whose specific characteristics correspond only in limited ways. One is often disposed to misplace concepts when engaged in an effort of theory building. One reason why such "unwarranted extensions of concepts"8 often happens is offered by Kaplan: No two things in the world are wholly alike, so that every analogy, however close, can be pursued too far; on the other hand, no two things are wholly dissimilar, so that there is always an analogy to be drawn, if we choose to do so. The question to be considered in every case is whether or not there is something else to be learned from the analogy if we choose to draw it.9 Thus, in trying to displace a concept, one may be enter- ing into a "potential intellectual trap"" in which the at- tempt turns out to become the misplacement of a concept. The Fallacy of Corporate Authenticity Many such attempts to displace concepts from certain areas into the disciplinary field of organization and admin- istrative theory have given rise to unintended outcomes. In general, misplacement of concepts in such a field is due to the fact that many authors do not realize that there are sev- eral forms of sociality which affect formal organizations with different degrees of intensity. For example, taking the degree of intensity in the interface between individuals as a point of reference, Gurvitch differentiates between mass, community, and communion as forms of sociality. " Many writers are led to "unwarranted" extrapolations, precisely to the extent that they overlook the fact that the third type of sociality-communion-has the least structuring func- tion within formal organizations. A typical illustration of this mistake is what has been called "authentic organiza- tions." '2 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1978 Yet, corporate authenticity is a contradiction in terms, for authenticity is an intrinsic attribute of the individual: it can never be conquered once and for all. Corporate social existence is normally the target against which authenticity addresses itself. Authentic moments of individual life are precisely those in which corporate behaviors are sus- pended. That is why authenticity is risky. Should it become a corporate steady social state, then there would be no merit for the individuals to be authentic, and the individual would lose the character of a true "I", responsible for each individual action. It is true that where communion prevails a high tolerance for authenticity may exist, but communion is hardly possible within the confines of formal organizations. Because of its nature, a formal orga- nization normally has a low tolerance for individual au- thenticity, for those types of relationships as defined by Martin Buber as I-Thou. The Misunderstanding of Alienation The idyllic overtone prevailing in many theories current in the administrative field validates Saul Alinsky's obser- vation that "social scientists often seem to be naive about the uses and purposes of organizations."'3 This observa- tion is particularly pertinent to those who claim that it is possible to minimize and even eliminate alienation within the confines of formal organizations. Any discipline must have a modicum of in- tolerance in its transactions with other dis- ciplines, otherwise it will lose its reason to exist. To have identity and character is in a sense to be intolerant. Actually, the contemporary literature on alienation is largely an instance of conceptual misplacement or "con- ceptual stretching," to use Sartori's language. Before Hegel and Marx, the issue that they conceived as constitut- ing the thrust of alienation always had a fundamental metahistorical and religious character. To overcome their misfortune in history, or their estrangement in this world, humans were supposed to come to grips with dimensions of their predicament which were essentially metahistorical and metasocial.'4 Hegel and Marx reduced that estrange- ment, conceptualized as alienation, to a purely social con- dition, so that they conceived human dealienation, re- demption or emancipation, not as an event in the life of the individual, regardless of given mundane circumstances, but as the outcome of a certain stage of the historic-social process. Hegel and Marx themselves have misplaced the age-old issue and idea of alienation and/or estrangement. Yet, Hegel and Marx were acquainted with the millenial legacy of thought and insights about alienation. They knew that according to this legacy, estrangement or aliena- tion was to be considered as a question essentially meta- physical and religious.'5 Their intent was deliberately po- lemical: to show that human estrangement or alienation</page><page sequence="3">552 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW could be overcome within the realm of secular history. They implied that prior to them, thinkers were focusing upon alienation at a level where it did not belong. Thus they suggested that those earlier thinkers were guilty of misplacing the concept of alienation. It is hard, however, to find excuses for the current be- havioralist literature on alienation. By and large, most of its representatives seem to be oblivious to the historical background of the question. Moreover, although some of these contemporary representatives refer to Marx (and rarely to Hegel) as a source, their writings are actually fraught with misinterpretations of Marx's thought, not to mention its antecedents. Apparently their intent is to "operationalize" Marx's thought, but in carrying out their endeavour they overlook the macrosocial frame in which Marx's concept of alienation solely makes sense. For in- stance, in a widely cited article, Melvin Seeman'6 seeks to make the meaning of alienation "more researchable" and "amenable to sharp empirical statement."' He portrays alienation as having behavioralist features, such as power- lessness, meaningless, normlessness, isolation, self-es- trangement. He justifies his analysis through an out-of- context interpretation of authors like Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Mannheim (gentlemen who would hurlent de se trouper ensemble) none of whom would ever accept a be- havioralist discussion of the theme. For instance, Seeman says that "rebellion" closely approximates "isolation." If this were indeed the case, Marx was an alienated person, which is tantamount to turning Marx against himself. An egophanic a character as Marx certainly was, he would repel with indignation such a suggestion. He thought that his "rebellion" against the bourgeois society and his "iso- lation" within it, were indications that he was anticipating in his lifetime the future historical stage defined by the vanishing of alienation. After all, Marx was a Hegelian of sorts. Similar to Hegel, he was convinced that he had deci- phered the riddle of history. And it is known that Marx had troubles with his interpreters. He once said: "moi, je ne suis pas marxiste." Many such attempts to displace concepts from certain areas into the disciplinary field of organization and administrative theory have given rise to unintended out- comes. To be sure, Seeman is conscious that his understanding of alienation "departs from Marxian tradition," but he considers such a "departure" as "not radical."' He ac- knowledges that Marx produced a "judgment about a state of affairs."'9 "My version," he says, "refers to the coun- terpart, in the individual's expectations of that state of af- fairs."20 The point is that such "departure" leads to grotesque outcomes. This is particularly evident in Robert Blauner's book, Alienation and Freedom. Blauner claims to draw upon Marx's theory of aliena- tion. However, in spite of his interesting empirical findings about work situations in several sectors of American in- dustry, Blauner's research is conceptually precarious, even on Marxian grounds, because the context in which he in- tends to assess alienation is uncongenial to the global socie- tal context which Marx had in mind. Blauner seems to equate alienation with discontent in the work environment, which is a denaturation of Marx's concept of alienation. As Richard Schacht has correctly pointed out, Marx would not "hesitate to speak of 'alienated labor' even in the ab- sence of actual work dissatisfaction."' For Marx, aliena- tion could never be eradicated within the limits of micro- organizations. Dealienation for Marx requires the overall transformation of the global social system itself. What in the existing industrial system makes alienation inevitable is, according to Marx, private ownership of the means of production, an aspect that is systematically overlooked by Blauner. It makes no sense from Marx's perspective to say that "the printer is almost the prototype of the non- alienated worker in modern industry"22 or that "the (con- temporary) industrial system distributes alienation un- evenly among its blue-collar labor force, just as our economic system distributes income unevenly."23 For Marx, given the intrinsic characteristics of the contempo- rary industrial societies, alienation is an inevitable feature of everyday life, a total social phenomenon, resistant to any compartmentalized solution. Those are some of the reasons why Blauner's research hinges upon a misplace- ment of Marx's theory of alienation. In fact it represents a misplacement of a misplaced concept, i.e., first, it strips the question of alienation of its metahistorical character; second, it assumes that the question can be solved by micro-organizational means. When taken at face value by writers and practitioners working in the field of public administration and manage- ment science, this kind of behavioralist literature fosters a distorted, if not bizarre, understanding of the interface between formal organizations and their members. A great number of writings current in our field reflect Seeman's and Blauner's views on alienation. For instance, Richard E. Walton claims that the "roots of worker alienation" can be "severed" through the "redesign of the work place."24 Substantiating this statement Walton reports the results of a design implemented in a pet-food plant. Some of these results are thus listed: After 18 months, the new plant's fixed overhead rate was 33% lower than in the old plant. Reductions in variable manufacturing costs (e.g., 92% fewer quality rejects and an absenteeism rate 9% below the industry norm) resulted in annual savings of $600,000. The safety record was one of the best in the company and the turn- over was far below average. New equipment is responsible for some of these results, but I believe that more than one half of them derive from the innovative human organization.2I Now it is our business as practitioners in public and pri- vate administration to redesign work places, and Walton's article is certainly a research piece of interest to that effect. However, to identify dealienation with job satisfaction and to try measuring it in terms of results such as overhead rates, manufacturing costs, annual savings, and safety rec- ords is grossly naive. Walton's research is typical of how a great deal of the literature in our field "misplaces" the concept of alienation. In fact, textbooks help to diffuse NOVEMBER/DECEMBER J1978</page><page sequence="4">MISPLACEMENT OF CONCEPTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE THEORY 553 among students this kind of misinterpreted findings. For instance, in one generally required textbook, it is said that "certain types of technology can reduce alienation."26 In other words, alienation admits of machine-like treatment. This gives the measure of the scholarship which is distilled in some classrooms of our schools of business and public administration. The fact is that, correctly understood, alienation is unsolvable through micro-organizational sedatives. Organizational Health, A Misnomer Another current case of a misplaced concept is the no- tion of organizational health. As an example, Warren Ben- nis claims that a concept of organizational health is needed in order to overcome the inadequacies of the old notion of organizational effectiveness.27 One can accept Bennis' re- mark that the "traditional ways"28 of evaluating organiza- tional effectiveness seem very rough, since they overlook several features of the question that are now salient. Indeed, traditional writers were overly concerned with per- formance established according to more or less rigid stan- dards and with limited "output characteristics."29 Cer- tainly Bennis raises an important problem in contemporary administrative theory: the traditional concept of organiza- tion effectiveness reflects a very narrow view of the "deter- minants"30 of the organization. However, the assumption that the concept of organizational health brings any clarifi- cation or broadening of administrative theory is question- able. Besides being foreign to the field of administration (for reasons to be explicated later), the notion of organiza- tional health leads to more inaccuracies than the old idea of organizational effectiveness. The proposed notion of organizational health not only fails to solve the theoretical and operational problems that the concept of organiza- tional effectiveness raised, but it creates new ones as well. When taken at face value by writers and practitioners working in the field of public administration and management science . . . [much of the] behavioralist literature fosters a distorted, if not bizarre, under- standing of the interface between formal organizations and their members. My main contentions in this regard can be summarized as follows: * Organizational health as conceptualized by Bennis is extraneous to the field of administrative theory. It is a mechanical extrapolation of an attribute that may be perti- nent to the life of the human individual, but not to the nature of the formal organization. Bennis' concept of organizational health predicates the reified existence of a collective or organizational mind, whose organismic over- tones can hardly be shown to be in tune with the frame- work of contemporary social science. One wonders if it is not a recurrence of such anthropomorphic fallacies as Gustave LeBon's "collective soul" and McDougall's ''group mind.'' NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1978 * The assumption of classic writers, from Taylor to Chester I. Barnard, that there is no administrative theory without objective standards for evaluating the specific ac- tivities of formal organization, continues to be valid today. In other words, since the formal organization is essentially defined by a specific type of rationality-instrumental or functional rationality-which is related to the optimization of means in order to reach specified goals, criteria for as- sessing organizational effectiveness are a serious theoreti- cal issue. Today we may reject as crude and inadequate the approach to organizational effectiveness proposed by Taylor and "scientific managers." However, in any at- tempt to tackle this problem their speculations and find- ings deserve serious consideration. Organizational effec- tiveness has features that Taylor and other earlier writers overlooked, and the administrative theorists' and practi- tioners' task is not to avoid the question, nor is it to pre- scribe placebos, but, rather, is to confront it head-on in all of its present complexity. The concept of organizational health, I submit, begs the issue. In trying to substantiate the notion of organizational health, Bennis identifies the organization with a who ("it needs to know who it is"3) constituted by several "selves," the task of the executive being "to strive toward congruence" or "harmony" of these "selves," "insofar as it is possible."32 Organizational "selves," as suggested by Bennis, are a reclassification in behavioral terms of the dif- ferent structures that Wilfred Brown sees in any complex organization: the manifest structure such as expressed by an organizational chart; the assumed structure such as given in the phenomenological perceptions of individuals; the extant structure such as the one objectively detected by the organization analyst; and the requisite structure, as the optimal one the organization should have within its limited circumstances. Brown's classification is valid and has ex- planatory force, but by psychologizing such structures and equating them to "selves," Bennis misplaces the concept of self and brings confusion to the terms of organizational analysis. One can indeed assess and depict such structures, but one loses accuracy in understanding organizational complexities if one resorts to the category of self, such as proposed by Bennis. This is exactly the kind of mistaken approach that Katz and Kahn object to when they observe that "some recent psychological approaches look closely at people and forget their structured interdependence in the organizational context."33 Although Katz and Kahn are psychologists, they are very alert to the pitfalls into which the psychologist may fall when indulging in the extrapola- tions of other disciplinary concepts to organizational prob- lems. Thus Katz and Kahn state: ... the approach taken in dealing with organizational problems has been oversimplified and too global. People have either as- sumed that organization was like a single individual, or that there was a single problem of motivation for the entire organization with a single answer, or that the organizational structures and processes could be ignored in dealing with the psychology of the individual. 34 Psychologists are welcome in the field of organization theory and practice. Indeed, we badly need them; but for them to be useful they have to understand the specificities</page><page sequence="5">554 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW of the organizational phenomenon which can never be fully comprehended with categories pertinent to individual psychology. A classic demonstration that psychologists can give outstanding contributions to the development of administrative theory is The Social Psychology of Organi- zations by Katz and Kahn. One can say that all the inaccuracies of the concept of organizational health derive from a common root: the mis- placement of the concept of mental health. Indeed, if men- tal health is a valid concept (and some question that it is), its standards are applicable only to individuals, and can never be applied to collectives or deduced from the organi- zational setting. The concept of organizational health revels in the psychology of adjustments, and does not ac- knowledge individual autonomy. It is not a scientific cate- gory but a disguised ideological tool, a pseudo-scientific device aimed at total inclusion35 of the individual within the organization. Psychologists are welcome in the field of or- ganization theory and practice. Indeed, we badly need them; but for them to be useful they have to understand the specificities of the organizational phenomenon which can never be fully comprehended with categor- ies pertinent to individual psychology. When used by practitioners and consultants as a referent for intervening in organizations, the pseudo-concept of or- ganizational health may lead to stifling the individual's psychological energy. In their interventions, these practi- tioners confessedly aim at integrating the individual and the organization, which is actually a sinister endeavour. The kind of psychology underlying the practice of these "integrationist" consultants is based on a misunderstand- ing of the nature of socialization and of the organizational phenomenon itself. It is a motivational kind of psychology which implies that the behavioral syndrome36 inherent in the market-centered society is equivalent to human nature at large. Motivation, thus understood, becomes tanta- mount to control and repression of the individual's psychic energy. This sociomorphic type of psychology is the con- ceptual background of practitioners, formed in some class- rooms of schools of business and public administration, who claim to possess skills for "managing human stress." However, psychology need not comply with meanings coming from institutionalized definitions of reality. It ac- knowledges a depth of psychic individual reality which re- sists being totally captured by social and organizational definitions.3" Relations between individuals and organiza- tions always imply tension and can never be "integrated" without crippling psychic costs. Formal organizations are nothing but tools. Individuals are their masters. If psychol- ogy is to be a component of the conceptual background of practitioners and consultants-as it must be-more sophis- tication is needed in its teaching in our schools of business and public administration. It is encouraging that such a re- orientation is already being suggested in recent writings ap- pearing in scholarly journals.38 Persons and Systems Models Regrettably, without explicitly subscribing to it, the "integrationist" ideology pervades a great deal of what systems designers and analysts do as consultants and practitioners. Very often they lose sight of the necessary tension between persons and contrived systems, by relying on a too-holistic conception of system. In general they reify the organizational system, i.e., they emphasize the dependence of the parts on the whole, instead of accurately dealing with the interdependence of the internal and ex- ternal constituents of the whole. Robert Boguslaw ad- dresses this point in his book, The New Utopians. Systems designers of mechanistic and organismic persuasion take for granted the operative rules inherent in institutionalized systems and "in the light of the status quo . .. proceed to explain how human groups can or do adapt to the world in which they find themselves."39 In practice, this is tanta- mount to allowing the operative rules of formal organi- zations to fashion the citizens' needs for food, shelter, clothing, transportation, education, and leisure. This ori- entation is aggravated when combined with the misuse of cybernetics which, as Sheldon Wolin has it, "consists in likening the nature of human thinking and purposive action to the operation of a communications system, e.g., 'the problem of value is like' a 'switchboard problem', or 'consciousness' is 'analogous' to the process of feed- back."40 Even a cybernetician aware of the fallacies of mechanistic and organismic analogies, as, for instance, Karl Deutsch, is caught up in the practice of misplacement of concepts. Thus, he employs a mecanomorphic image in defining the polity as a "steering system"4' and statesman- ship as the "art of driving an automobile over an icy road."42 Then the systems analyst is only concerned with the polity's capabilities to accomplish its goals; the ethical dimension of such goals is none of his business. The "threatening" outcomes of such a cybernetic posture has been highlighted by Giovanni Sartori.43 Concerns identical to those of Wolin and Sartori inspire Habermas' discus- sion of systems analysis.44 My intent here is not to dismiss systems models, but to argue against their unqualified utilization for administra- tive analysis and design. In principle, systems models have a utility in the administrative domain mainly when the structure-maintenance functions of systems are legiti- mately to be monitored and nurtured. However, when focusing upon structure-elaborating and changing func- tions of systems, analysts should be prepared to deal with the true nature of systems dynamics. A significant attempt at refining systems analysis has been undertaken by contemporary writers. I take it, for instance, that Arthur Koestler is proposing such a refine- ment when he presents the concept of holon as a tool for systems analysis to go "beyond atomism and holism."45 He sees organisms and organizations not as absolute wholes, but as constituted by sub-assemblies-organelles, organs, organ-systems-each having a remarkable degree of autonomy and self-government. Each of these sub- assemblies is a holon, "which has two faces looking at op- posite directions-the face turned towards the lower levels NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1978</page><page sequence="6">MISPLACEMENT OF CONCEPTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE THEORY 555 is that of an autonomous whole, the one turned to upward that of a dependent part."46 One can argue however that the incorporation of the concept of holon into systems analysis does not seem to eliminate the latter's reductionist and holistic bent. One might say that the concept of holon implies a functional account of personal consciousness, either as "parts relative to superstructures" or wholes "relative to sub-structures"47 and this view evidently does not express what a person is traditionally supposed to be. A person is not essentially a functional constituent of a system. I think that Kant's definition of a person still holds true: "A person is subject to no laws other than those that he (either alone or at least jointly with others) gives to him- self."48 Thus a person may eventually find himself in a system without necessarily being a functional unity of it. A person in a contrived social system may very well be a Trojan Horse, i.e., a deliberately disguised agent of dis- ruption both of superstructures and substructures. At- tempts at integrating the individual and the organization are based on a misunderstanding of the nature of a person. Only a delimitative view of organizational design can counter the unqualified practice of systems analysis. Misplacement of concepts ... permeate contemporary writings about organiza- tional problems and issues, characterizing today's administrative theory as a tower of Babel built toward the sky. The confusion of tongues is almost deafening. Misplacement of concepts identical in nature to the ones here discussed generally permeate contemporary writings about organizational problems and issues, characterizing today's administrative theory as a tower of Babel built toward the sky. The confusion of tongues is almost deaf- ening. This situation cannot be overcome unless adminis- trative theory refuses to assume that the criteria inherent in formal organizations are the criteria of human existence at large.49 Instead administrative theory should become an inquiry into multiple types of social systems, of which the formal economizing organization is a particular case. 50 Conclusion In conclusion I want to contend that paradoxically the disciplinary field of administration had a much clearer sense of its assignment before the rise of the so-called Human Relations School in the thirties. David Riesman and W.H. Whyte should be read again, for they cogently explain how the Human Relations School was triggered by the imperatives of a business structure demanding emphasis upon consumption rather than upon saving.5 From Taylor to Luther Gulick professional administrators were very much on the track of what the systematic study of laboring activities and productivity should be. Thanks to them some basic permanent issues of administrative science were identified. They can be articulated as follows: * Labor and productivity are systematic objects of scientific study. Peter Drucker correctly considers Fred- NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1978 erick Taylor as a pioneer of today's "knowledge eco- nomy" according to which "the key to productivity (is) knowledge, not sweat".52 This can be said of the so- called Classical School at large. * There is no administrative science without technical procedures to measure and evaluate work outputs. * Jobs should be technically designed. Their design- ers should take into account man's physiological and psychological condition. It is not true that Taylor and the Classical School neglected the human factor in orga- nizations. What is to be highlighted is that their concep- tion of man was reductionistic and too limited.53 * Human capabilities are not "intuitively obvious either to the worker, or to the observer"54; they must be technically and experimentally detected. * Performance on the job cannot be improved and effectively organized without systematic training of the workers. In other words, technical training does not ne- cessarily remove or stifle, but rather accentuates human differences. These are some permanent issues of administrative science. Actually, the classicists' approach to these issues was theoretically shallow, but, at least, they knew that formal organizations are not the appropriate settings for people's dealienation and self-actualization. They were more conscious of their limits than the current "integra- tionists" and "humanists" who claim to know how to design "authentic," "proactive" and "healthy" organi- zations. As harbingers of the "knowledge industry," the classicists undertook a historical mission, which was to provide the American economy and society at-large with sophisticated, capital-intensive, productive capabilities. They handsomely fulfilled this mission. In significant mea- sure, their inventiveness and ingenuity have enabled the United States to become the first tertiary and service econ- omy of mankind's history in which formal organizations, so to speak, can take care of themselves with comparatively little help from people. Today the fundamental mission of professionals in administration is not to legitimize the total inclusion of people within the confines of formal econo- mizing organizations, but to delimit their scope in human existence at-large. The time is ripe for the practice of an unprecedented kind of administrative science sensitive to the diverse issues of human life, and able to deal with them in a variety of settings where they appropriately belong, and of which the formal economizing organization is a case limit.
