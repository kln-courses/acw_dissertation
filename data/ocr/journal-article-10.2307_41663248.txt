<plain_text><page sequence="1">• In this, the second and concluding section of Mr. Stumer's account of exploration and reconnaissance in the Chillón River valley of the Central Coast of Peru, will be described the excavations at the Cerro Culebra site. It was here that most of the actual digging occurred and the most spectacular finds of the Marquez series of ex- cavations were made. The first section appeared in Archaeology 7 (1954) 171-178. Part 2: THE CHILLÓN VALLEY OF PERU Excavation and Reconnaissance 1952-1953 By Louis M. Stumer The Marquez Cerro (see Culebra Map, Figure (Hill 1) of was the selected Serpent) from site surface on reconnaissance the Hacienda Marquez (see Map, Figure 1) was selected from surface reconnaissance and examination of aerial photographs because it appeared to carry on the culture sequence that had been established in our first excavations, at Playa Grande (Archaeology 6 [1953] 42-48). The Cerro Culebra excavations became the second of a projected series of three. The third, at Vista Alegre in the Rimac valley, is scheduled for 1954. It is hoped that these three digs will give us the sequence from the middle of the Formative epoch well into that of Great Fusion, for Central Coast sites at any rate. The earlier part of this sequence, from Chavinoid to Playa Grande, has been giving us trouble because of our inability so far to find a site of a transitional period. Perhaps the current year's work may fill this need but so far no sites of that period have come to light in the Chillón or Rimac valleys, and we may have to search farther in some of the more remote Central Coast valleys. Cerro Culebra is located on a barren plateau on the north bank of the Chillón less than a mile from its mouth. There is an extensive view of the ocean from practically all parts of the site, which extends almost a kilo- meter from east to west. Its usual width is less than two hundred meters. Beginning at the western edge, the site consists of three burial plots, an unplanned and sprawling living area, two more small burial plots and, at the eastern end, a large pyramid-temple complex surrounded by patios, terraces and subsidiary compounds. Six cuts were made at the site, numbers one and five being merely test pits. Number two produced eight burials, six being of children (Figures 220</page><page sequence="2">2, 3). These burials were similar to those at Playa Grande in the matter of ceramics (Figure 5), form of burial, burial in small lots rather than large cemeteries, basketry and textiles. A number of stone-lined storage pits were also excavated, providing a large quantity of corn suitable for Radiocarbon 14 testing. It was found that the poorer dwellings at Cerro Culebra had the same "wattle and daub" construction as those at Playa Grande. Two examples of urn burial were encountered among the child graves: one is an undecorated, fire- blackened cooking olla; the other is a fine example of a large decorated mammiform jar. The neck of the jar had been struck off to accommodate the wrapped body of the infant. , Cut Three proved to be more complicated and inter- esting, since it involved the clearing of the major por- tion of an important dwelling of the Playa Grande cul- . ture. At the same time another house of an earlier type from the same culture was disclosed and investigated; of the accompanying grave plots, the later one was thoroughly excavated and the earlier "spot checked." It was interesting to observe the difference between the poorer class dwellings, both at Playa Grande and at Marquez, and the comparatively elegant house in Cut Three. The basic construction material was tapia, which was used for all weight-bearing walls. Most partition walls were of small to medium sized adobe bricks, both hand- and mold-made, although a few were of uncut stonè with clay binder. Noteworthy among these walls ^ras a small semicircular enclosure off one of the main rooms, adjacent to a hearth, which looked as if it had been a pen for guinea pigs, still one of the staple items of the Andean Indian diet. Also near the hearth were several well made circular storage pits; one contained a quantity of well preserved "anchovetas," a local sar- dine-like fish, while another was well stocked with corn and peanuts. The method of house construction was to make the tapia outer walls about breast high, and then to sink circular holes in their tops at regular intervals. Into these were set beams of the willow wood indigenous to these river valleys, which were firmly anchored in place with wet clay. The beams had forked upper ends which supported the lateral roof members (heavy canes) . The roof covering, of closely laid light cane, was placed longitudinally on top of these. In this climate, where rain is virtually unknown, this was all the protection necessary against the elements; the space between the roof and the tapia walls provided ample ventilation dur- ing the hot summer months. The roof was crowned by an ornamental cornice painted in alternating stripes of clear yellow and light gray. There was a "loggia" of low tapia walls, again crowned by the same roof con- struction, facing an adobe-walled patio in which were an open-air hearth, a garbage dump, and the family burial plot! Cutting through the well packed and finished cUy floor of this dwelling, we encountered the outer walls of an earlier house. The chief difference in architectural style was that all main walls of this earlier construc- tion were made of adobe bricks (Figure 4), not tapia, and the enclosure for guinea pigs had a well made fence of woven canes. The adobe bricks were similar in size and style to those of the partition walls of the later dwelling, consisting of an almost equal mixture of hand- and mold-made bricks. It is difficult to differentiate be- tween these early Central Coast adobes, as the molds used must have been of some rather resilient substance such as leather which allowed hand impressions to show through, although not nearly so clearly as in the hand- made type. The shape of both kinds of brick is the same, roughly that of an old-fashioned loaf of bread, having flat sides and bottom and a rounded top. Only a small portion of the underlying house was excavated, since when its adjacent burials were checked, there was no question of its period and further digging would have severely damaged the structure above. It did, however, provide additional evidence of the burial pattern for the entire culture, small family plots im- mediately outside dwelling sites. The grave orientation is almost invariably north-south with the head to the south. Extended burial is general, and face-down burial with a wooden and cane litter on top, first noted at Playa Grande, is also common at Marquez. In all, twenty-three tombs were excavated at Cut Three, nine- teen in the patio of the upper house and four in the front courtyard of the lower. A strange thing came to light in the excavation of the upper dwelling. In three instances, while clearing doorways we found the wrapped body of an infant or very young child, com- plete with miniature litter, not in a grave, but merely placed on the floor of the doorway. I shall not attempt to speculate on the significance of this startling and un- sanitary custom. Cut Four was made in another small cemetery plot about a hundred meters from the edge of the patio at Cut Three. Whereas the tombs at Cut Three contained the usual amount of ceramics (Figure 6) and other artifacts of the Playa Grande culture, those of Cut Four almost uniformly yielded only the sparsest cul- tural and diagnostic objects. In fact, had it not been for the now typical form of extended litter burial, identifica- tion of these poor graves would have been difficult. The plot contained seventeen graves, which produced ex- 221</page><page sequence="3">THE CHILLON VALLEY OF PERU cont.NUED actly two restorable ceramic vessels (Figure 7). A num- ber of rather good spindle whorls were found, however, as well as a necklace of amethyst and mother-of-pearl. In addition, miniature unfired clay vessels such as those first encountered at Playa Grande were also in evidence. The ornithotropic aspect of the Playa Grande tombs, where gayly plumed macaws were buried with their •owners, is also encountered at Marquez, although it is by no means so pronounced. This may well be because no graves so rich as those at Playa Grande were found at Marquez. Perhaps when the tombs of the high priests of the temple of Cerro Culebra are located we may see a glow of Amazonian plumage heretofore unequaled. The main value of Cut Four was to provide us with a good series of skeletal material for anthropological analysis, which is now being carried on in Lima. Cut Five was in a small dry canyon or ''quebrada" some two hundred meters northeast of Cut Three. This was a test pit which disclosed nothing more than a llama burial of the Chancay period with associated ceramics and artifacts. We then proceeded some five hundred meters eastward to the site of the temple of Cerro Culebra. We had actually been working steadily from west to east with the exception of the slight detour for Cut Four. Cerro Culebra temple had been identified earlier from aerial photographs and many surface investigations had been made during the progress of the Playa Grande dig- gings as well as the work at Marquez. The temple site itself was in a rather poor state of preservation, the re- sult of erosive action of sand-bearing winds rather than activities of grave robbers. The entire temple area, however, was littered with potsherds of Middle and Late Playa Grande types, and the top of the main pyrav 222</page><page sequence="4">1.

This style, which is often confused with the Playa Grande, has been considered by some as following it in the chronological sequence for the Central Coast. We decided to clear a small lateral strip through the center of the principal temple quadrangle in order to understand more clearly the architecture of the pyramid. The ground plan was, in the main, easily grasped from the aerial photographs, but the temple itself was so cov- ered by loose sand and crumbled* tapia that it was impos- sible to ascertain whether it had been a plain or stepped pyramid or some combination of the two. Also, there were on top some vestiges of massive tapia construction which did not appear to be contemporary with the Playa Grande ceramics scattered about, and it was neces- sary to investigate this as well. Accordingly, we began to clear away the floor of the quadrangle, pitching the rubble down the sides, intending to end up with a com- pletely cleared strip about five meters wide, with the excavated earth piled at the foot of the pyramid on either side of it. The temple enclosure of Cerro Culebra is trapezoidal in form, 250 meters from east to west and 160 meters from north to south at its greatest extent, 125 at its smallest. This area consists of terraces, courtyards and patios, with the pyramidal structure, also trapezoidal in plan, at its center. The pyramid measures 65 meters east-west and 40 meters north-south at the western end, 30 meters at the eastern. Its height varies between 12 and 1 5 meters. Thus we planned to have two dump piles in the north and south patios. The first thing ascertained was that the north face was stepped, consisting of small steps of the type found in the oldest sections of Pachacamac. A wide monumen- tal staircase led up to and was associated with the mas- sive tapia construction at the top of the pyramid. When this and the interior floor of the quadrangle had been cleared, it was plainly seen that the stairway and super- structure overlay, and were subsequent to, the main pyramid construction. Consequently, it would be neces- sary to remove the later structure in order to examine the main pyramid. For this we did not have the requisite official permission, and waiting for a permit would have entailed more time than we had at our disposal. We were therefore rather at a loss as to how to proceed. I observed that there was about an inch of a wall pro- jecting above the surface. It appeared to be a secondary wall paralleling the east-west inner wall of the quad- rangle ; it actually was the main wall of the inner quad- rangle of the original temple. At this point, in my slightly frustrated state, I kicked at the sand on the inner side of the wall, which fell away, revealing flashes of vivid red, white, and black paint on the wall itself! This put a very different face on matters, naturally, as wall paintings are quite rare on the Central Coast, es- pecially in a good state of preservation. We immediately made plans to clear the paintings by digging a narrow trench from which they could be observed, photographed and traced with a minimum of damage to the tapia structure superimposed upon them at several points. Digging the trench and carefully cleaning the painted portion of the wall occupied a period of some six weeks. Although it appeared that about one-third of the wall had been cut off to accommodate the constructions placed above, the remainder was in excellent shape, extending in some areas to two meters from the top of the wall to the bottom of the paintings. In all, twenty-six meters of fresco were cleared, and it proved to be the most com- plex and well preserved wall painting yet found on the Central Coast. The task of clearing was not an easy one, since the people of the later occupation had obviously decided to utilize this wall as a weight-bearing member for the tapia above, and had consequently built retain- 22S</page><page sequence="7">8.

The fill ranged from soft sand through puddled adobe, dis- carded adobe bricks, and tapia blocks, to heavy river cobbles, which were especially difficult to remove not only because of their weight but also because of the danger of damaging the painting. Demolition of sec- tions of the retaining walls abutting on the painted sur- faces was also ticklish work, since these were generally anchored to the paintings by clay mortar. When, however, the work was complete, the plan and technique were clearly revealed. The paintings are techni- cally close to fresco; a fine wet yellow clay slip had been applied to the basic tapia wall. Besides the yellow, seven other colors were encountered, black, white, brown, purple, orange, and two distinct shades of red. The entire southern longitudinal wall showed the fol- lowing scheme. Of its sixty-five meters of length, the two end sections (approximately twenty meters each) were a plain clear yellow, while the center section of twenty-six meters was occupied by the design. While it was impossible at the time to check the other three walls of the quadrangle, I consider it most likely that this scheme is followed there also, and that three other central painted panels are awaiting excavation. There had originally been a roof of some sort over the paint - .ings, as is shown by fragments of painted tapia found on the clay floor associated with the frescoed wall. These were cane-marked in a way that shows they had been placed over the top of the wall, possibly to preserve the main paintings which are in perishable vegetable colors. The roof designs appear to have been simple, well ex- ecuted geometric motifs in yellow, red, black and white. In its original state the whole quadrangle must have pre- sented a most colorful sight. The paintings themselves consisted of six sections, each roughly four and one half meters in width. The sections are separated by themes, not by any painted division (Figures 8-10). The three easternmost sections are representations of a highly simplified and geometric anthropomorphic or feline head. The first two show this ugly "deity" surrounded by stylized serpent attributes. The second section shows the god's serpent arms; the serpent heads are his hands. In the third section he is in the center, surrounded on all sides by smaller heads symmetrically arranged, perhaps representing trophies. The three remaining sections are less geometric and simplified ; they make use of more colors and are more difficult to interpret. The first has a central anthropo- morphic standing figure, its arms upraised, holding a trophy head in each hand. This being is flanked by a lizard or fish and various obscure geometric figures. The next section is badly damaged and only some geometric figures can be identified. The final panel has an anthro- pomorphic or feline face flanked by a balanced design of attributes. These appear to include a serpent or fish motif and are especially interesting since they alone use curved lines. We may assume that two artists were at work here simultaneously, as the first three sections differ so greatly from the last three. The preparation of 227</page><page sequence="9">THE CHILLON VALLEY OF PERU cont.NUED the surface, colors used, composition, execution and feeling are different, and finally, the right hand artist had to compress the left half of his first panel to avoid lapping over onto his colleague's work. "Right hand" is much more inventive, less neat, and definitely less sure of his composition, design, and color handling; while "left hand" knows exactly what he is doing all the time. It almost looks like a prehistoric version of "traditional" and "modern." One thing stands out in an analysis of the paintings as a whole: that is their relationship with the art of the Calle j on de Huaylas, an intramontane civilization some 250 kilometers distant from Cerro Culebra. This culture, known as Recuay or Copa, has been placed in the Re- gional Florescent epoch, which aids us in dating the Cerro Culebra frescoes. The serpent motif, so strong at Cerro Culebra, is almost identical in treatment to that on the ceramics and stone sculpture of Copa, as is the figure holding the trophy heads. The serpent motif is most important on the Playa Grande and Marquez ceramics as well. At this point one can only speculate on the significance of this relationship, and much more work needs to be done in order to explain it. However, it would seem logical, considering the distance between Cerro Culebra and Copa, that another such ceremonial center should exist somewhere in the intervening terri- tory, and we intend to make a thorough search for it in the seasons to come. Additional facts were gleaned from this excavation, including the attribution of the basic structure to the Playa Grande culture, and of the overlying massive tapia construction to the Maranga. A prominent characteristic of the Maranga civilization is the prevalence of massive pyramidal ceremonial centers, and it appears as if an attempt had been made to transform the less advanced, more delicate basic architecture of Cerro Culebra into one of these. The underlying construction associated with the frescoes was found to be of the same type as that of the house at Cut Three: tapia weight-bearing . walls, partitions of hand- and mold-made adobe bricks. We reluctantly left the central quadrangle after cov- ering the frescoes once again with soft sand in order to preserve them for the present. We then resumed our search for a rubbish heap suitable for stratigraphie anal- ysis. In this we were unsuccessful, since the refuse here appears to be generally scattered about, with no dis- cernible concentrated middens. We did, however, make controlled cuts in the rubbish overlying two patio floors, which established the fact that the Maranga ceramics ap- peared only in the uppermost level, and that beneath this all was pure Playa Grande. The floors themselves were cut, but beneath them was undisturbed sterile sand. This terminated our digging at Cerro Culebra proper. The foregoing, together with the article in the previ- ous issue of Archaeology, is a general summary of our excavations and reconnaissance in the Chillón. The primary result was to establish the culture sequence shown in the accompanying table, which partially fills a gap in our knowledge of the chronology of the Central Coast. When this chronology is complete, we shall be able to pay more attention to the varied cultural aspects of the region and the problems posed by such mani- festations as the frescoes at Cerro Culebra with their evidence of influence of a far distant culture in times long past. In the meantime, however, it is to be hoped that the analysis now under way of the many specimens obtained will give us tangible clues toward the solution of these and many other archaeological problems still remaining unsolved in this region.
