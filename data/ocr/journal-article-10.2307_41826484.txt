The visual arts, including printmaking, played a much more prominent rôle in Mexico's cultural and political life in the twentieth century than in that of most European nations. Artists of Toledo's generation, although liberated from the pedagogical rôle of the great muralists who dominated artis- tic life until the middle of the century, are still looked up to 54.

Toledo is not only the most famous living Mexican artist, but has also made a quite exceptional contribution to the life of his home town, Oaxaca, where he has been largely instru- mental in founding a cluster of cultural institutions, most of them housed in beautiful colonial buildings that he himself has restored: the Institute of Graphic Arts, which includes one of the best art libraries in Mexico; the Museo de Arte contemporaneo de Oaxaca; a Centre for Photography with a library for the blind; and a cinematheque. He also helped to rescue the cathedral and monastery of Santo Domingo (in danger of being turned into a hotel), to restore its ancient library and to found a botanical garden, and has set up a papermaking factory. These achievements have somehow flowed naturally from a life centred on the very individual matter of making art, with its proceeds ploughed back into supporting the complex and vivid society from which he came. Printmaking has long been integral to the teaching and practice of art in Mexico. Since Posada was adopted as the godfather of the muralists, and the Taller de Grafica Popular was founded in 1936 to provide a printmaking wing to the socially committed art of the 1930s and 1940s, prints, rather than photomontages, have been the popular medium par excellence. Toledo, however, was just as resistant to the propa- ganda tradition here as he was in his paintings; as a student in the 1950s he remembers being told to make prints with a political subject-matter, a command he ignored. In Paris in the early 1960s he pursued his experiments in printmaking; a limited involvement in S. W. Hayter's studio, where he pre- pared one engraving, might have encouraged his inventive- ness in the medium. The exhibition 'Francisco Toledo or the Triumph of Death' is the first retrospective of his prints, dating from 1969 to 2000. It is a wonderful collection, although whether it is fully representative of this aspect of his work is difficult to say, as the groups of prints I have seen previously are so various. One of his favourite themes, intriguingly, given the title of the exhibition, is entirely absent - that of the calavera , or skeleton, who dances through the Mexican Día de muertos and is a frequent and often humorous presence in Toledo's paintings, prints and sculpture. Knowing that he was involved in the selection of the exhibition and chose its title, the absence of this literal and archetypal Mexican subject casts a different light on the living creatures that populate the images presented here. Death stalks them in diverse ways, and is the unspoken counterpart to the erotic present. His creatures - cayman, scorpion, grasshopper, donkey, bat, rabbit, crab, toad and cow - constitute a bestiary whose associations are variously American and universal, including pre-Columbian myth, Zapotee legend and highly personal symbolic narratives. While these creatures are familiar from</page><page sequence="3">CATALOGUE AND BOOK REVIEWS 103 56. Francisco Toledo, Tortugas , 1991, wood-engraving, 550 x 903 mm (Mexico, private collection). his paintings, the prints never replicate the painted images; they are quite distinct and play with the special character of the medium, as where the bat's long wings cut dramatically against the wood grain {Murciélago 1984; fig. 54) or as in one of the extraordinary series of self-portraits from 1999, where the head emerges like a ghost from a dense black ground {Autoretrato III 1999; fig. 55). While Toledo's paintings often have a powerful erotic presence, the prints are frequently more explicit and insistent. The relations between animals and humans are profoundly ambiguous, but nothing is ever straight- forwardly anthropomorphic. Creatures shift identity and transform from human to animal and vice versa, but the drama often concerns relations of power and exploitation, involving consumption both sexual and gastronomic {La mesa puesta 1983). Many images suggest bodies and environments unknown to the human, a kind of sympathetic observation of utterly different modes of being: creatures that crawl, scrabble, sink, swim, graze, glide and peck. These different ambiences find wonderful analogues in Toledo's cut and scraped wood- blocks. Scaly animals with harsh geometrical carapaces swarm round a waterhole; a fight between crickets is repre- sented with sharply pecked bony white spines against a red- flecked black ground {Pelea de grillos 1990); the clear dark shadows of turtles stand out against a ground striated with the markings of their own shells {Tortugas 1991; fig. 56). Only a couple of works in the exhibition have an obvious reference to Mexican history. Doña caracola llega tarde al pala- cio appears to be a humorous reworking of a Posada print, and La hermana de Juarez cose ajeno (1984) is a particularly rich example in his series of ironic treatments of Benito Juarez, the iconic hero of nineteenth-century Mexico. Toledo, who has a Zapotee background, takes a sardonic view of Mexico's cultural and political heroes. His work may have become closely identified with modern Mexico's desire to amalgamate its diverse cultures, but each print in this exhi- bition asserts its individual and specific identity against any stereotypical notion of the 'Mexican', and also, crucially, Toledo's right to be appreciated in an international context. Far from being exclusively wood-engravings, Toledo's prints often mix techniques, incorporating among other things etching, aquatint and drypoint. I am no specialist in prints, whose technical mysteries I suspect are almost impenetrable to anyone who has not actually worked with burins, needles, acids, waxes, etc. Walking around an exhi- bition of Toledo's recent prints at the Galería Lopez Quiroga in México, with Pierre Alechinsky, however, my impression that Toledo's techniques are peculiarly inventive, unexpected and anarchic was confirmed by one who does understand, and who, like many fellow artists, admires their constant subversion of accepted practices.</page></plain_text>
