<plain_text><page sequence="1">STERLING M. McMURRIN Metaphysical Diversity and Cultural Disposition: A Case Study in Philosophic Difference FOR THIS OCCASION in honor of Professor Charles A. Moore, I am interested in advancing a frankly speculative historical and comparative thesis which I believe would have been of interest to him. My thesis is: That the predominant impersonalism of Indian metaphysics is in part a product of the tolerant inclusiveness which has characterized the general disposition of the people of India in religious practice and philosophical thought, while the strong personalistic tradition of the Occident, which is rooted especially in the biblical religion, is a consequence of a powerful attitude of intolerant ex- clusivism. I have no desire to comment here on the justification or merits of either of the cultural attitudes which I shall describe, or on the theological and metaphysical ideas to which they contributed. My argument is based on a broad view of the character of the two cultures and of their religious and intellectual history: for India, from the polytheism of the Vedic hymns to the culmination of the monistic trend in the sophisti- cated systems of the Vedanta, and extending even to the present; for the Occident, from the primitive semitic polytheism to the achievement of the prophetic monotheism and its eventual union with the impersonalistic hel- lenistic metaphysics, and including the subsequent character of Western theism. It is beyond practical possibility that the countless and intricately complex causal relationships that obtain among the elements of a culture can be fully identified. But the understanding of a culture and even a rudimentary com- prehension of the differences that distinguish cultures require the pursuit of this task, a task that at best is speculative and is precarious with the likelihood 97</page><page sequence="2">98 STERLING M. McMURRIN of error, and which can proceed only by committing every kind of social and historical abstraction and by indulgence in gross oversimplification. It is an interesting one, nevertheless, and sometimes yields quite unexpected results. There are at least three kinds of factors which may be causal determinants within or among cultures: ideational, material, and dispositional. These may not be entirely discrete or independent. Such material factors as climate or geography, for instance, quite certainly may affect the disposition of a people, causing them to be excessively passive or active. Or such a material element as economic or political success may profoundly influence religious ideas regarding the human predicament. But the causal relationships which obtain within a culture are often reciprocal, and metaphysical or theological ideas may have a far reaching impact on political action or economic conditions. And there is always the possibility, of course, that of two things, where one appears to be caused by the other, both may result from a third. The whole picture is utterly complex and not a little confused, and every attempt to explain cultural phenomena, including the attempt of this paper, must be regarded critically and with considerable reserve. A basic difference between the cultures of Hindu-Jain-Buddhist India and the Judeo-Christian-Islamic Occident, when these are seen in a general per- spective, a difference that has large and interesting practical as well as theoret- ic implications, is found in one aspect of the major conceptions of ultimate reality which have obtained historically in religious thought. In India the description of that reality has been in predominantly impersonal terms, while in the Occident it has been to a large degree personal. I refer here to the Occidental conception of God as a person-which is for the most part, though not exclusively, a derivative of the biblical religion-and to the impact of this conception on both theology and metaphysics. And I have in mind, of course, the strong and quite general tendency in Indian thought for metaphysics to transcend not only the personal gods of the pantheon but even the God of personalistic theism. Among the ideas that have affected Western culture and moved Western civilization, certainly none has been more important than that there is a God who is a person, and the concept of personality has been integral to, and indeed partially shaped by, the idea of God's being. This is not to say that the Occident, even since the beginning of Christianity, has not generated impersonal conceptions of God, or that the dominant ideas of God do not involve numerous descriptions which were fashioned for impersonal reality. Consider here, in the first instance, the views of some of the more radical mystics or extreme rationalists, and in the second instance, the large hellenic component of Christian theology where the Platonic and Aristotelian descrip-</page><page sequence="3">CULTURE AND METAPHYSICAL DIVERSITY 99 tions of an essentially impersonal reality become properties of the living God of biblical revelation. And I do not mean to disregard the dominance in recent years of non-theistic impersonalistic metaphysics or the strength of the modern positivistic tradition, or even the current attempt, as with Pro- fessor Tillich, to describe Christian metaphysics in somewhat impersonal terms by defining God as "being" rather than "a being." It is to insist, rather, that since the confluence of ancient cultures in the Roman Empire, the chief informing idea of Western religious culture, however involved in contradic- tions it may have been, however much confusion it may have produced, and however much it is now disclaimed, has been the concept of God as a person. Now the point that is most relevant to my thesis is not simply that God is conceived as personal, but that there is no reality that is ontologically or cosmologically prior to or superior to God, nothing in the substance or struc- ture of the universe to which he is subject. Though because of his transcen- dence of the world, God in the traditional Occidental theism is not a full- fledged metaphysical absolute, he is described in absolutistic terms and his ultimacy is guaranteed by the dogma of ex nihilo creation. Consider, in contrast, the tendency of Indian metaphysics to transcend the gods-not necessarily to deny their existence, or in many instances even their religious efficacy, but to reach beyond the anthropomorphic categories of personality in the attempt to provide a rational description of the ultimately real. I do not mean to ignore the great variety in Indian thought and the impressive diversity that is found within the several Hindu schools them- selves. And it would be inexcusable to disregard the notable instances in Indian philosophy of personalistic theism where God as a person is the highest reality. Here I have in mind, for instance, such cases as the Vi'ista- dvaita Veddnta of Rdmdnuja or the Dvaita Veddnta of Madhva. Rdmdnuja's theism, which rejects the extreme monism of Advaita by a critical reading of the monistic passages in the Upanisadic literature, is a near Indian counter- part to classical Occidental theism. I think, however, that it has inescapable pantheistic overtones. But the work of Madhva is a highly sophisticated at- tempt to preserve a genuine theism, yet reconcile it with absolutism; probably a more successful effort to cope with this problem than can be found any- where among Western theologians. It is significant for my thesis that even Rimnnuja and Madhva and their disciples, who held strong personalistic views, were deeply involved in the task of preserving the reality of the world and a personal God against the overwhelming monistic and absolutistic thrust of Advaita VedInta, and that despite their best efforts that monism was often successful in transcending the personal in the final description of reality. The case at issue does not</page><page sequence="4">100 STERLING M. McMURRIN center on monism but rather on the strong Indian tendency toward im- personalism. The importance of monism here is simply that in Indian thought it has been a powerful instrument in the cultivation of impersonalism in the concept of the ultimate reality. Some kind of dualism or pluralism seems essential to the meaning of personality. There probably is not a better ex- emplification of this problem than in the metaphysics of S. Radhakrishnan, certainly the most celebrated contemporary Indian exponent of idealism, and defender of the theistic tradition. Radhakrishnan, whose metaphysics stems especially from the Svetdsvatara Upanisad and the Bhagavadgita, has denied that Isvara, the Supreme Person, is mayd, phenomenal, but he holds never- theless to the non-dualistic position that Brahman as the transcendent Abso- lute is non-personal. Perhaps more than any other Hindu thinker, Radha- krishnan has faced the criticism of Occidental philosophers that the monism of Advaita Vedanta negates its theism by relegating its personal God to what is at best a secondary reality. His reply that the Supreme Reality need not be conceived categorically as either personal or impersonal may provide a firm ground for theism, but it clearly falls short of the attempt at unequivocal personalism that characterizes Rdmdnuja, Madhva, or the classical Christian theologians. Turning to the dispositional factors of my thesis, I refer to what I will simply call the "inclusiveness" of the Orient and the "exclusiveness" of the Oc- cident in matters pertaining to religion and to religious and philosophical dis- cussion. My reference here includes the religious syncretism so common among the Chinese and Japanese as well as among the indigenous faiths of India, but it is directed especially to the remarkable attitude of tolerance that charac- terizes India in matters of religion and philosophic thought. I understand this tolerance to be not a matter of intellectual or moral charity, but rather a deep- seated conviction of the unity of all things and of the incompleteness of every attempted account or explanation of them. I certainly do not mean to ascribe an absolutistic metaphysic to Indian philosophy generally, but absolutism, where it does appear (which is not infrequent), is compatible with this tolerance of disposition, for it conforms nicely to the idea that the supremely real transcends every facet of reality that can be known and experienced. As Radhakrishnan has so effectively put it, "The absoluteness of truth implies the relativity of all formulations of it. . . . Truth wears many vestures and speaks in many tongues." The inclusiveness, however, is by no means confined to sophisticated thought and discussion, but seems to characterize the culture even in its more primitive aspects, both today and in the distant past. It is exhibited in the peaceful relations that have generally obtained among Brahmanism, Jainism,</page><page sequence="5">CULTURE AND METAPHYSICAL DIVERSITY 101 and Buddhism, in the mutual accommodation of the sects that has often cut across linguistic and ethnic lines, in numerous political actions of historic import condoning and encouraging an ecumenical commitment, in the well established practice of regarding the sad-dars.anas, the six schools, as orthodox even though this entails some careful footwork with the Vedas, and especially in the tendency to regard the heterodox and orthodox schools as in some ways complementary rather than conflicting. Allowing for important exceptions, the inclusiveness and toleration seem to have characterized Indian thought gen- erally through its length and breadth, from the early Vedic nature religion to the sophisticated and advanced metaphysical and epistemological systems. But, returning to the Occidental religion, with its semitic roots, the picture is radically different. It is the story of an exclusivism that has rarely yielded even though the religion has in some ways achieved a quite genuine uni- versality and has had, as at present, its moments of ecumenicity. This ex- clusivism has well known symbols in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--"I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have no other Gods before me"; "I the Lord thy God am a jealous God"; "There is no other name under heaven by which men can be saved"; and "There is only one God, Allah." There are, of course, numerous features of Occidental religion that are in some ways at variance with this exclusivism and that even oppose it in principle: the ab- sence of rigorous creedal requirements in Judaism, the missionary zeal of Christianity and Islam, or the doctrine of the invisible church in Catholicism. But these do not affect the basic exclusive character of these religions that distinguishes them so radically from the Oriental faiths: that there is one and only one true God, one and only one body of true doctrine, one and only one true church, one and only one way to salvation. I will not argue this point further, as it appears entirely obvious and the facts on both Orient and Occident are well known. Nor will I hazard an attempt to account for this inclusiveness and exclusiveness. Their causes are no doubt both multiple and subtle. Conceivably they could range all the way from geographic to psychological factors and involve such matters as migra- tion, commerce, war and peace, diet, and sunshine. But that these cultural characteristics have importantly affected the structure of both religion and metaphysics appears obvious when the development of the ideas of God and ultimate reality is seen historically. Consider, for instance, the gods of the Vedic hymns in comparison with the conception of Yahweh in the early biblical period. If the Vedic theology is to be regarded as henotheistic rather than polytheistic, as both Max Muiller and S. Dasgupta have argued, it is still a henotheism that differs radically from that of the Pentateuch, for the hymns extolling the greatness</page><page sequence="6">102 STERLING M. McMURRIN of a Vedic god, and glorifying his powers and virtues, are apparent efforts to honor and flatter the deity but not to assert his sole importance. The very nature of the gods as representations or manifestations of natural phenomena precluded their being set against one another as competitors for sole reality. Nature is not at war with itself. It is true that this habit of describing the gods eventually produced a form of monotheism in Prajdpati, the Lord of Beings, the creator of the gods. But this was more than anything else simply a monotheistic tendency, for this early conception of the oneness of God lacked both vigor and integrity. Indian monotheism generally has been characterized by a high degree of indeterminateness. The vagueness of this monotheism derives, it seems to me, from the in- definiteness in the conception and description of the individual gods, who often seem to have been either indistinguishable or interchangeable. Although they are to a considerable degree treated anthropomorphically, their personal character is often in some doubt and their individuality does not clearly shine through the hymns and prayers or stamp itself firmly on the later philosophical discussions. As a facet of my thesis, I am willing to argue that if the Aryan- Hindu mind had been less tolerant and generous in its attitude of inclusive- ness, the individual gods would have shaped up more clearly and their per- sonal qualities would have become more distinct. The competition which would have developed among them would inevitably have strengthened them. The Greek deities, though they too were often expressions of natural phenomena, were more vivid in their individual characters than the gods of the Vedas, perhaps in part because of the extreme anthropomorphism re- flected in their often less than admirable indulgence in human practices--an indulgence which at times set them squarely against one another. In the Hebrew religion, on the other hand, from the earliest time-Yahweh was set in the sharpest contrast to the other gods. Indeed, as C. Labuschagne has so effectively pointed out in his monograph, The Incomparability of Yahweh in the Old Testament, even in the Mosaic era the uniqueness of Yahweh resided in his distinctiveness, his incomparability, and the fact of his incomparability was basic to his character. Over and over again in various forms appears the question or assertion "Who is like thee, O Lord, among the gods?" (Ex. 15:11). "There is none holy like the Lord, there is none besides thee; there is no rock like our God" (I Sam. 2:2). Such references are quite unlike the Vedic hymns, which praise the god, even with exaggera- tion, and focus attention exclusively upon him, but do not declare his total ascendency above all others. The god who is the object of worship is elevated to supreme status, but this honor is shared with others and is not exclusive.</page><page sequence="7">CULTURE AND METAPHYSICAL DIVERSITY 103 "Indra is sovran lord of Earth and Heaven, Indra is lord of waters and of mountains. Indra is lord of prosperers and sages: Indra must be invoked in rest and effort" (1g Veda X.89). As the object of praise in the hymn, Indra is the greatest of the gods. But the other gods are equally real and when their turn comes they, too, are the greatest. The achievement of a genuine monotheism in the biblical religion-as found, for instance, in Jeremiah, where the other gods are "worthless, a work of delusion" (10:15), "But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King" (10:10), and in the Second Isaiah, "I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to graven images" (42:8)-was the climax of a long and arduous struggle of Yahweh with the gods who contended against him. In the Second Isaiah, the prophetic idea of a God of justice and mercy was identified with the popular God of Israel, who had evolved from the tribal desert deity, and with the transcendent cosmic God of Job, who created and rules the world. The result was a pure monotheism of the universal God, the creator in whom is every power and every virtue. It seems to me that the strength of this monotheism issued in considerable degree from the fact of struggle, often desperate struggle, between Yahweh and the national baalim, or Yahweh and the gods of the local fertility cults, a struggle which could very well have been lost, considering the radical cultural transition involved in the change from a desert nomadic culture to a walled city-land ownership culture. But the struggle was fought and won, the baalim proving to be powerless, as in the legend of Elijah at Mt. Carmel, and eventually becoming figments of the imagination, as with Jeremiah. And in the struggle Yahweh not only appropriated every power of his adversaries and, breaking through the bonds of parochialism, achieved a remarkable uni- versality, but became as well a genuinely personal living God whose character was clearly distinguished by his holiness, his power, his purpose, and his moral strength. Even though the Greek deities were somewhat more distinct and articulate as personalities than the Hindu gods, Zeus, as he became the bearer of an incipient monotheism in the tragedies of Aeschylus, for instance, was no match for Yahweh either as a symbol of the ultimately real or as the embodi- ment of creative and moral power. For Hesiod he had been the greatest of all the gods and the embodiment of moral justice, but he was a tolerant God whose attitude toward his fellow gods was live and let live. Yahweh's was a magnificent solitude on Sinai, and he fought against every threat to his integrity and every attempt to compromise the uniqueness of his being. But</page><page sequence="8">104 STERLING M. McMURRIN Zeus was too much involved with pantheonic society. His mountain was cluttered with deities with whom he conspired and fought but whose reality he did not seriously challenge until it was too late. It was too late because the thrust toward unity, finding no god capable of completely commanding the field and eliminating all contenders, simply bypassed all the gods and became the work of the philosophers and the philosophical poets. These often showed deference to the gods, employing them as religious symbols or literary devices, but they did not rescue any one of them from the impending oblivion. Here is the crux of the matter, for both Greece and India. The philosophers, often with the monistic impulses of the rationalists and mystics, constructed their conceptions of the ultimately real with at least a partial and sometimes a complete indifference to the gods, whose easy complacency had betrayed them into forfeiting their hold upon reality. And this meant, in a sense, that the categories essential to the fact of personality were not fully admitted into the description of the highest reality. The philosophers were rarely, if ever, creators of a genuine personalistic theism. More often they were the pro- ducers of impersonalism, even when, as with Plato and Aristotle, they some- times employed the language and the sentiments of theology. The gods faded away as literary allusions and the conceptions of supreme being, avoiding the obvious pitfalls of anthropomorphism, were at best only partially or pseudo personal. The biblical god triumphed over the philosophers, at least for a time, be- cause in the syncretistic culture of the hellenistic world he stood out alone as a living personal God whose strength was fed by his opposition to every challenger. The philosophers from Philo on through the Christian fathers attached their concepts of reality to him and he became the Supreme, the ultimately real, and the World Ground. His victory was in a sense a victory of the moral imperative and moral action as against the calm issues of philosophic thought and intellectualized mystic insight. For Plotinus, the One was not personal, because long before he wrote the gods of his culture had declined and died. There was no deity in the Roman pantheon who had gained enough cosmic stature to be genuinely useful to the philosophers of his day, and the monism of Plotinus' system was in principle inimical to theism. But the Judeo-Christian personalism thrived. It was the triumph of a dogmatic, intolerant, and unrelenting faith in the God of time and history, who intervenes with his purpose and power in the course of human events- as against the timeless, motionless object of reason and intuition with which unity may be achieved but which makes no command to duty and action. It was the victory of the transcendent, living, personal, moral God who did not</page><page sequence="9">CULTURE AND METAPHYSICAL DIVERSITY 105 evolve from the primitive polytheism by easy and regular stages of develop- ment but issued from the powerful thrust of the intolerant, competitive, and dogmatic exclusivism of the Mosaic and prophetic religion. I am aware that in these last sentences I may appear to distort both the Greek and Indian theisms, ignoring the personal, activistic, and moral quali- ties of the gods. But my point, again, is that for most Greek and Indian philosophy, those personal qualities do not describe the ultimately real. In Indian thought especially, the ultimate is more often than not the Brahman taken not as livara, but as the Absolute. The typical position taken by Oc- cidental theism, it seems to me, is that which is set forth by Aquinas when he argues that God is not in a genus but is the "principle of all being" (Summa Theologica Q. 3., Art. 5). Aquinas held, of course, that God should be called a person (Q. 29., Art. 3). Why did the monotheisms and near-monotheisms that appeared among the philosophers not succeed as bearers of the religious and philosophical tradition? Take Xenophanes, for example, perhaps a more definite instance than any to be found in Indian literature. Strictly speaking, his theology was neither monotheistic nor polytheistic, for he did not deny the reality of gods other than his One God, nor did he conceive them to be simply natural phenomena. But his was the clearest Greek instance of the celebration of One God as the unity of the divine where the God was clearly a living, con- scious, personal being and not simply a metaphysical principle or natural force with some person-like properties. Despite his powerful polemic against anthropomorphism in the description of the divine, Xenophanes' God is easily as personal as any deity to be found in Greek literature. The answer to this question, it seems to me, is not difficult to find. It is simply that the gods of philosophers have no genuine "lasting power." Gods are like religions, of which they are the foundation. They issue from the folkways and from the living experience of the people. They are the work of the religious practitioners, the priests, the prophets, the saviors. They come from instinctive, intuitive, and dogmatic revelation-not from the pale and quiet reasonings of philosophers. Not, that is, if they are going to last and make a difference. Some philosophers, such as the American personalistic idealists, have reared impressively-argued metaphysical structures to under- write the reality of a personal God, or more properly, the personal character of the World Ground. Usually, however, they have not been the creators of their own personalism but are rather the rationalizers of the personalism of dogmatic religion. Which brings me to my final point. The strength of the personalistic metaphysics in the Occidental intellectual tradition has depended very much on the traditional subservience of philosophy</page><page sequence="10">106 STERLING M. McMURRIN to religion, a religion which was grounded in faith in the Supreme Person. For some time this picture has been changing. The strength of impersonalism in Indian metaphysics has resulted in considerable measure from the non- subservience of philosophy to religion, due perhaps to the fact that in India there has been an intimate tie and partial identity of philosophy with religion. In Western thought the relation of philosophy to religion is less intimate and often quite forced and artificial. In the real showdown the philosophers have rarely made the final decision on the religious view of life and the world.</page></plain_text>
