<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHURCH AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS' CANON CYRIL E. HUDSON IT is hardly possible to consider the problems suggested by the title of this paper, except as part of the wider problem of the Church's relation to politics and the proper functions of Church and State respectively. I hope, therefore, that I may be forgiven a brief historical initroduction. The idea of "Christendom"-of the unification of all secular interests and activities under the aegis and authority of the Church-dates from Charlemagne, who exploited the organization of the Church and the spiritual heritage which it preserved to further his own imperial policy. But the Carolingian experi- ment overran the imagination and the organizinig capacities of its day; it lacked inherent stability, and fell to pieces on the death of Charles. The ideal of unity which had inspired him, however, did not die; it was inherited and appropriated by the Church, which alone, during the Dark Ages which fol- lowed, kept society together. By the end of the eleventh century the point had been reached-I quote Mr. Christopher Dawson-"at which the traditions of the past age flow together and are merged in the new culture of the medi- aeval West. It looks back to Saint Augustine and Justinian, and forward to Dante and the Renaissance... The unity of Christendom was no longer conceived as the unity of imperial autocracy, a kind of Germanic Tsardom, but as a society of free peoples under the presidence of the Pope and the Emperor." Political thought in the Middle Ages was dominated by the idea of Na- tural Law. Life in community, it was held, which is the life proper to man, the only kind of life congruous with his divinely-ordained status and nature, is impossible, since the Fall, without domininhm and the exercise of authority of some men over others. That is the case for secular government. As early as the seventh century Saint Isidore of Seville had formtulated a doctrine which was adopted, with slight modifications, by later writers and passed into the common stock of mediaeval political theory. The ims gentiumn is part of ius naturale; it is the common possession of "all nations," to whom it belongs, not in virtue of "any (htuman) constitution," but instinctu naturae, though it must be rationally comprehended. The conventions of this ins gentiurn, covering such matters as war, captivity, reconciliation, treaties of peace, truces, the immunity of ambassadors and the prohibition of marriages with aliens, are immutable. They do not proceed from any State or human legislator. They emanate from God and are prior to and take precedence of, 'Address given at Chatham House on May 21, 1946. I</page><page sequence="2">2 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ius civile or positive law; and human laws are valid only when they conform to the principles of ius naturale. To describe such a conception as this as a "law" would seem to many, perhaps, a misnomer. It is law, of course, not in the sense of enactment or legislation, but in the Ciceronian sense of "right reason in agreement with nature: of universal application, unchanging and everlasting"-what our own Richard Hooker called "the law which human nature knoweth itself in reason universally bound thereto," embracing "all those things which men by the light of their natural understanding evidently know (or at leastwise may know) to be beseelming or unbeseeming, virtuous or vicious, good or evil for them to do." We have to remind ourselves, further, that throughout the Middle Ages authority is conceived of as vested (in theory at least) not in the executive but in the people. The authority of Canon Law and Civil Law-of all "posi- tive" law-was conceived of as the authority of custom rather than of enact- ment. "Law," says Carlyle, "was the expression of the life of the community. There is nothing more characteristic of the Middle Ages than the absence of any theory of sovereignty, as this conception has been sometimes current during the last three centuries. The king or ruler of the Middle Ages was conceived of, not as the master, but as the servant of law." -But by the fourteenth century this conception had begun to be replaced: the new, "national" kings-of England and France and Spain-so far from thinking of themselves as servants of the communities they ruled, were laying the foundations of the modern, omnicompetent, sovereign State. The Con- ciliar Movement, which Figgis called "the watershed between the mediaeval and the modern world," was an attempt to find some tolerable form of asso- ciation between secular governments, highly conscious of their new-found power, and the Papacy. The mounting claims of the latter, from the days of Gregory VII onwards, were "totalitarian" claims in the strict sense of that word, in that they recognized no social or individual activity as having any right to be exercised save under the aegis and control of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. These claims at length provoked a revolt-not always very self- conscious or articulate-of the secular impulses of man; and it can hardly be denied that the refusal of the Church to recognize the validity of this revolt (crystallized in the Conciliar Moveniient) facilitated the process which led, ultimately, to that assertion of the absolute autonomy and unrelatedness of every department of social life-including the political-which is character- istic of the modern world. The failure of the Conciliar Movement led to the apotheosis of absolutism in both spheres: in the spiritual sphere, to ultramontanism; in the secular, to sovereign States acknowledging no political superior. And the Movement failed, not merely through the resistance of the Papacy, but because, as Professor Laski has observed, "the ideas which were the foundation" upon which the advocates of conciliar reform relied-above all, reverence for</page><page sequence="3">THE CHURCH AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 3 Natural Law-"were already decaying in the secular world when men sought to transfer them to the ecclesiastical." I shall argue later that it is upon the conception of Natural Law that the Church today must base its concern with international affairs. But if the expression of that concern is to commend itself to the world, Christians must show a keener appreciation than they commonly do of both sides of the equation. They must have an understanding of the meaning of the phrase "international affairs" at the present day which goes beyond a vague and general realization that these affairs are extremely complex. "Mediaeval history," wrote Bishop Stubbs, "is a history of rights and wrongs. Modern history, as contrasted with mediaeval, is a history of powers, forces, dynasties and ideas . . . Mediaeval wars are, as a rule, wars of rights; they are seldom wars of unprovoked, never wars of absolutely un- justifiable, aggression: they are not wars of ideas of liberation, or of glory, or of nationality, or of propagandism. .. " But modern wars are of this kind. Why? Why do we naturally think and speak of international affairs as relationships between rival Powers? Why has the State in every community assumed such a preponderating place in men's lives that we do not feel Mr. Middleton Murry to be talking sheer nonsense when he asserts (as he did in a recent broadcast address) that man today "is the nation-State?" The answer to these questions, of course, is to be found in the technological ad- vances of the past century and a half. Man's curiosity and inventiveness have, in the first place, revolutionized war itself. War in the eighteenth century was "the sport of kings," who used nmercenary troops, and played the game according to a complicated set of rules which were, for the most part, punctiliously observed.1 The object of commanders was to avoid battles, not to provoke them: "I am all against battles," wrote the Marechal de Saxe, "especially at the beginning of a war. Indeed, I am convinced that a capable general should be able to carry on all his life without finding himself forced to battle." We have changed all that. Henri Bergson, writing in 1932, could say that all modern wars are wars of whole peoples fighting, for self-preservation. "Gone is the idea of the delegating of the fighting to a limited number of soldiers chosen to represent the nation. Gone anything resembling a duel. All must fight against all, as did the hordes of the early days. Only, the fighting is done with arms forged by our civilization, and the slaughter surpasses in horror anything the ancients could have dreamed of. At the pace at which science is moving, that day is not far off when one of the two adversaries, through somie secret process which he was holding in reserve, will have the means of annihilating his opponent.2 The vanquished may vanish off the face of the earth." Since that was written, "our civiliza- tion" has produced-and used-the atomic bomb. 1"Raised to the level of an art, war became an activity to be executed with elegance of manner, preference of manoeuvre for massacre, and moderation of object." Liddell Hart, The Revoluttion in Warfare (London, Faber and Faber, 1946), p. 41. 2Italics not in the original.</page><page sequence="4">4 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS The same technological triumphs-of manufacture, transport and com- munication-which have made war what it is likely to be henceforth, have created an international situation which makes it a continuous possibility. It is strange indeed, in the light of intervening economic history, to read the Cobdenite creed. "The past history of our race," wrote one of its exponents, "proclaims the supremacy of force, the selfishness of Empire, and the sub- jugation of Mankind, as the prevailing aspect of society. But the rise and progress of the industrial arts, and the extension of beneficent commerce, indicate, in terms too plain to be misunderstood, the real destiny of society, and the existence of a new epoch which shall stubstitute the ploughshare for the'sword and the loom for the battery. The cause of Industry is the cause of Humanity." It is a far cry from that expression of faith in the universally beneficent effects of industrialism, to the modern assumption that an in- dustrialized nation's economic health depends on the "capture"-from its neighbours-of world markets for the surpluses which neither it nor they can consume at home, and on what is called, paradoxically enough, a "fa- vourable" balance of trade. A third consequence of the growth of power-technics has been inevitably to increase the power of the executive within each State. The development of the means of commnunication is an obvious illustration of this. Germany and Russia have shown how, by keeping the control of education, of the press and of the wireless in a few hands, a small group of ruthless men is able to direct the opinions, the moods and the feelings-in a word, to de- termine the psychology-of multitudes. If we look into the future, it is clear that, in any State possessing atomic bombs, the control, and perhaps the knowledge, of the mechanisms which release them must be confined for reasons of security to a very few members of an inner cabinet. The buttons and switches which let loose the final horror on mankind will be pressed by half a dozen men. The essential problem in international relations is comnmonly described as the moralization of power, and it is here that the Church is expected to "come in." What has happened, it is said, is that mankind's moral enthusiasm has failed to keep pace with its technical and scientific progress. (Cf. Report on the Politics of Atomtic Energy :1 "the heart of the problem" is to accelerate "the humanising of our selfish and savage instincts" so as to make interna- tional organs effective before mankind has used atomic energy to destroy itself.) What is required is an ethical spurt: and what is the Church for, if not to inspire and to organize ethical spurts? Sometimes it is suggested that a more intense concentration of human thought and energy on the ad- vancement of scientific knowledge and research would of itself generate the moral dynamic required: thus, Professor J. B. S. Haldane assures us that, 'By H. D. Gideonse and others (New York, The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 1946).</page><page sequence="5">THE CIIURCH AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 5 if science does not kill us, it will "make us behave better."' But, more com- monly, it is taken for granted that what is wanted is a greater determination, on the part of the common people and their leaders throughout the world, to make existing instruments for the peaceful solution of international disagree- ments "work"-chiefly of course the United Nations Organization. Mankind, in short, possesses the engines of peace, though they are capable of improve- ment: and it is for the Church to grease the wheels. There are two comments to be made on this way of regarding the Chturch's task in relation to international affairs. It mistakes both the function of the Church and the nature of the international problem. In the first place the trouble with contemporary society is not so much moral as psychological. It is not that it does not want to be good, but that it is frustrated, at every turn, by an interior conflict: a conflict analogous to that described by Saint Paul, between two principles at work in the same personality-the principle in the "members," and the principle in the "mind." Modern society is suffer- ing from a similar schizophrenia, which is most clearly discernible perhaps in the divorce between civilization's conscious moral aims and the unexam- ined and uncriticized assumptions which govern its economic activities; but discernible, also, in the general doubt and uncertainty as to the ends which the life of man in society ought to serve. "Who," asks Mannheim, "is to plan the planners?" Time was, when Christian theology was thought of as regina scientiarumn. We may argue as to whether the decline of that mon- arch's influence in the world of affairs is the consequence of abdication or of deposition. The fact remains that she is no longer recognized. Who or what is to take her place? There is a fairly general awareness-witness the title of Jung's widely- read Modern Man in Search of a Sol2 -that, in some sense not very clearly understood, civilization has lost its "soul." What it would, it does not, since the deep, underlying energy to do it is absent, or is, at the least, seriously weakened. Merely moral exhortations, therefore, or appeals for more "ideal- ism," or for the "application of the principles of the Sermon on the Mount" to modern political and economic problems, are as useless as are adjurations to "pull himself together" addressed to a neurotic patient. Our contemporary civilization is neurotic. In tlhe new era that has dawned with the discovery of atomic energy, it faces an inescapable dilemma: the abolition of war, or, at the very least, in Mr. Churchill's words, "measureless havoc upon the entire globe." But civilization is impotent to solve the dilemma in the way suggested by every consideration of prudence, self-interest and morality, since it plainly lacks the psychological and spiritual resources for foregoing war as an instrument of power. 'In a broadcast talk, "The Challenge of Our Time," reported in The Listener of May 2, 1946. 2(London, 1933).</page><page sequence="6">6 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS There is a temptation to the Church in this situation: the temptation to "cash in" on the world's predicament: to forget her own complacency and lack of charity, her unconcern, over long centuries, with social evils that cried to heaven, her timorous subservience to the powers that be, her introverted absorption in matters of ecclesiastical machinery, her nervous anxiety in the face of threats to property and privilege, her supine acceptance of the awful "scandal" of schism-to forget all this, and to point to civilization's resource- lessness with the threat, explicit or implied, Come back, Come in-or else! This temptation to exploit the situation must be resisted. Yet the Church cannot deny her mission, or betray her Master. The Gospel she is charged to proclaim is a Gospel, neither of good advice nor (save consequentially) of ethical idealism, but of deliverance, salvation, redemption. The Person of Christ, rather than His precepts, is its central and dynamic core: and the Church must proclaim it. It is from this perspective that the Church must observe and evaluate the historical process, including contemporary trends and movements in international affairs. Professor Whitehead once "hazarded the prophecy that that religion will conquer which can render clear to popular understanding some eternal greatness incarnate in the passage of temporal fact." All the modern substitutes for Christianity-religious in content, though not in form-try to do this, of course. But only Christianity, by virtue of its doctrine of sin, refuses to regard "the passage of temporal fact" as -itself redemptive: only Christianity sees that the essence of the political problem lies in the nature of man himself, which impels him to corrupt the very instruments and institutions which he devises for the ordering of his social life. There is no possibility of the total elimination of power from human affairs. And all power tends to become power "over." It follows, therefore, that approximation towards justice, which is the fundamental condition of natural order, is to be measured by the degree in which power is subjected to law. In the biblical and Christian view, justice is the form in which love expresses itself in social organization: and from this follows orthodox, his- toric Christianity's "high" view of the State, as an institution with its own specific and unique function to fulfil in the divine economy: the function, precisely, of creating an ordered framework within which men may be en- abled to carry on the activities congenial to them, and develop their natural gregariousness in the fellowship of families, churches, professions, crafts and the like. "The powers that be," therefore, "are ordained of God"; in the patristic formula, the State is a "remedy against sin," though it is at the same time, from another point of view, the consequence of sin, and the punish- ment for sin. But the subordination of all other interests and associations to itself-which must be a continuous temptation in the Welfare State towards which we are moving-is a perversion of the political function. But of course there are no States in which the ideal is fully embodied. If there were, international problems would still exist, no doubt, in plenty.</page><page sequence="7">THE CHURCH AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 7 But they would be different from, and less intractable than, those which face us today. We need not subscribe to the strict Marxist view, that the State is always and necessarily a weapon of oppression and exploitation in the hands of the economically dominant class, to recognize that in all historic States, and a fortiori in the relations between States, the subjugation of power to law in the interests of justice is very far from being attained. We may rightly believe, I think, that this process has been carried furthest in our own tradition. But the task of extending that tradition-with its emphasis on the supremacy of law, the sovereignty of Parliament and the value of free- dom of discussion and criticism-to the international plane appears so formid- able that many people (especially young people) are drawn to what Mr. Arthur Koestler calls the Yogi position. A recent writer, Mr. Alexander Miller, speaking of the contemporary social crisis, refers to "the sense that events are out of hand, that our generation is in the grip of gigantic forces whose nature no man can understand and which are beyond the power of men or of democratic assemblies to control. The future of society is being shaped by influences impersonal or daemnonic, so that intelligent decision or democratic action is impossible or meaningless, and can have no constructive effect. This sense of overmastering 'fate' is shattering in its effect on personal and group initiative. It takes the stuffing out of voluntary societies of all kinds, and creates in the majority a numbness of mind and soul, a sense of political helplessness and sheer frustration. They tend more and more to concentrate on their own personal future, on that narrow range of choices which are within their own personal control. They take exams, they fall in love, they marry, they try for a temporary niche of security ... as a man on a sinking ship might shut himself in his 8 ft. by 8 ft. cabin to keep the illusion of safety for just five minutes more. This is not purely a war-time mood, and the end of the shooting war has left it relatively unaffected. It springs from the totality of social chaos which has been the lifelong experience of the present generation."1 But the policy of withdrawal is clearly a policy of despair: a surrender to the doctrine of Thrasymmachus. Any democratic State which adopted it- as, for example, by unilateral disarmament in atomic weapons of warfare- would be proclaiming its belief in the inevitability of a World State, in the sense of a world tyranny exercised by the most ruthless of Great Powers, acting on the view that Machiavelli has said the last word in political ethics, and "degrading national States to the level of local authorities without either the will or the means to fight each other."2 The only alternative to throwing up the sponge in despair is to persevere, in spite of difficulties which seem insuperable, in the task of creating an effective comnmunity out of the existing congeries of nations. And an essential 'The Christian Significanice of Karl Marx (London, The Student Christian Move- ment Press, 1946), p. 100. 2"Atomic Progress Report" (The Economist, May 4, 1946).</page><page sequence="8">8 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS precondition of this task would seem to be the recovery of that acceptance of Natural Law on which the existing corpus of International Law, tenuous as it is, is founded. It is important to remember what Natural Law essentially is. It is a doctrine, not of what ought to be, but of what is: a doctrine of the pattern and structure of man. It affirms that man is essentially a rational and moral being, responsible to the Transcendent Reality from whence he comes, and to which he goes: designed for life in obedience to God, and therefore for life in community with his fellows. It denies the doctrine that he is "naturally" a predatory, lawless and hostile creature: when he behaves thus, on the contrary, he is rebelling against the nature of things: sin is law- lessne.ss.1 It is no part of Christian orthodoxy to maintain that men and societies can have no apprehension of the will of God save through conscious adher- ence to the lordship of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, man's awareness, through reason and conscience, of the precepts of the Natural Law, consti- tutes, in the words of Aquinas, a true "participation in the Eternal Law," which is the mind of God Himself. Here, then, is the ground for thinking that the primary concern of the Church with international affairs must be to foster and encourage the search for agreement as to the nature of man, and concerning those conditions of his social life which alone can be regarded as congruous therewith. Nor is it difficult to find empirical support for this view. The history of recent months is but one illustration of the truth that international alliances and coalitions, maintained in war by the necessity of resistance to a common danger-the danger of annihilation-and a common fear, are liable not to survive (save on paper) the removal of the danger. Other mutual interests may, indeed, remain, but "the idea of common in- terest," as Mr. Martin Wight remarks, "can never have much vitality if it is separated from the idea of common obligation."2 A further pragmatic argument for basing the Church's concern with international affairs upon Natural Law is this. The doctrine had already passed out of men's minds while international intercourse was confined to States professing Christianity. Today, however, the society of nations includes some which have never pro- fessed it, and one-the most powerful of all-which explicitly repudiates all religious faith. Even if language about "applying the Christian principle of love to international relationships" means something to some people (which is doubtful), it can clearly mean nothing whatever to non-Christians. But the doctrine of Natural Law, whilst being authentically Christian in the sense that the natural is the necessary foundation and precondition of the supernatural-"first that which is natural, then that which is spiritual"- does not demand acceptance of the Christian faith as such. 'I John, iii, 4. 2Power Politics (London, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Looking Forward Pamphlets No. 8, 1946), p. 63.</page><page sequence="9">THE CHURCH AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 9 I have argued that an essential preliminary to the establishment of inter- national relations upon a basis which shall not constitute a perpetual threat of war lies in the recovery, or discovery, of some agreed body of ideas about man and society. I am bound, in conclusion, to suggest that no such common ethos, divorced from its interpretation and fulfilment in revealed religion, is likely to be found. I have used words like "law" and "justice" and "power" a good many times. But whence comes the authority and the validity of law? From Prince or Parliament? Is everything law that Parliament, or Stalin, or Hitler enacts? Can no law enacted by the State be unjust, as Hobbes affirmed? Or is there a higher and ultimate Law to which all human, positive law is related either by way of correspondence or of opposition? And can this view be maintained save on theological grounds? Justice, again: can we quarrel with the totalitarian doctrine that justice is what serves the State in the assertion of its power, or maintain the view that power must be conceived as a means to moral ends, and not as an end in itself, unless we believe that men are "naturally" brothers? And, in the last analysis, what ground is there for believing that, other than the conviction that God is their Father? And can that conviction be maintained save on the foundation of the Christian Faith? Mr. C. N. Cochrane, commenting upon similarities of terminology in the writings of Stoic and Christian writers-including phrases like "the City of God," "the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man," and "the law of charity"-observes that "such apparent analogies should occasion no surprise, since all they mean is that the Stoics agreed with the Christians in dreaming of a better world. The real point, however, is what ground of assurance they had for so doing." Mr. Cochrane quotes a passage from Marcus Aurelius in which the emperor dwells "with a pathetic insistence upon the right to believe in an orderly world, despite an accumulation of evidence which seemed to belie his faith"; and concludes: "The religion of reason thus professed by Marcus has been hailed (by Renan) as 'the absolute religion, that which issues from the simple fact of a high moral sense face to face with the universe.' This religion has been declared 'independent of race and country.' 'No revolution, no progress, no discovery could possibly upset it.' In point of fact, it constitutes an audacious anthropomorphism, a kind of sky-writing, which projects upon the cosmos a merely human rationality and translates it into an account of nature and of God."' It is possible that now, at the end of my paper, someone may be asking: Is that all? Does the writer suggest that the Church's only concern with international affairs is to give the Christian "O.K." to the doctrine of Natural Law? Is he telling us that civilization, in the desperate crisis in which it finds itself-with the nations which "won the war" further from unity among themselves than they were in the moment of victory-can be talked into safety by the reiteration of philosophical platitudes? 'Christianity and Classical Culture (Oxford, the Clarendon Press, 1940), pp. 166-7.</page><page sequence="10">10 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS I do not mean this. But then I do not believe that the world can "save" itself, in any final sense, at all; and it is certainly no part of the Church's duty to suggest that it can. The doom which hangs over our civilization is the last and inevitable term of that banishment of God from human affairs which has characterized the (nominally Christian) Western world in recent centuries. For this apostasy the Church herself has been largely responsible; she is implicated in its consequences, and cannot dissociate herself from the humiliation and repentance which it demands, and of which she must seek to make the generality of men conscious. People ask, "Why don't the Churches give a lead?" Sometimes this means, Why doesn't the Archbishop of Canterbury-or the Pope, or the British Council of Churches-say what I think they ought to say? Sometimes it means, Why can't they show us how to eat our cake and have it, how to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, how to get us to the goal we have set ourselves without asking us to change our route? The Church cannot "lead" thus. She must say that the only way out is the way back-to God: and that a civilization virtually founded upon the denial of His sovereign claim on its obedience must expect to incur His judgments and to vindicate His righteousness. Natural Law is concerned with the cardinal virtues. From a Christian standpoint, it is a serious defect of these-fortitude, justice, temperance, prudence-that they do not of themselves move the will: they do not provide their own dynamic. Now, if we take confused and incompatible social ob- jectives, self-regarding striving for power, and anthropocentric pride ("Titan- ism") to be the three factors which chiefly bedevil international relations, we can say, I think, that practical steps, based upon considerations of Natural Law illuminated by Christian insight, would go far to remedy the first. But the other two are unlikely to be eradicated except by Grace. That word, how- ever, raises a question upon which I must not embark: a problem of technique -if you like, "the politics of Grace." But it is at least arguable that the influence of the Church on international affairs is no less effective when it is indirect-even at the cost of appearing to be introverted-rather than direct. There is good historical precedent, at any rate, for thinking so. Con- sider one illustration only. I suppose that no factor had an influence com- parable to that of the Benedictine Movement on the course of civilization from the sixth to the twelfth century. But Saint Benedict had no thought of "preserving civilization." At a time when, as now, the foundations of the earth were out of course, he sought to create and maintain a "still centre" in which he and his monks "might partake by patience in the sufferings of Christ, and become worthy inheritors of His Kingdom."</page></plain_text>
