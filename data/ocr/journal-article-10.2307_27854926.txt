<plain_text><page sequence="1">transmission from one system to another, as well as capacity for storage. Harold's book is a contemporary com pendium of energy-linked membrane-as sociated systems. Described are respira tion and photosynthesis extending to wide varieties of transporters, pumps, and channels and to cellular motility, signal-processing, information, and as sembly mechanisms. The book is directed firmly at the bio logical. At the outset the position is taken that reductionism to chemistry and phys ics is not the essence of descriptions of complex biological networks. However, chemistry and physics are the best way to describe mechanisms, and it may be a result of the stance taken that some of the better understood mechanisms or more interesting ideas are not approached closely enough for the reader to get a useful idea of how these biological ma chines work at the molecular level. The trend then is to the phenomenological. Harold adopts a remarkable writing style more reminiscent of an earlier cen tury; to my taste it is overly metaphoric and anthropomorphic, and often ver bose. However, the book, which is more a broad review than a textbook, should serve as a useful source of information and references to scientists in general, including chemists and physicists who might be considering research on some aspect of bioenergetics.?P.
