<plain_text><page sequence="1">Women, Animals, and Jane Goodall: Reason for Hope Marianne DeKoven Rutgers University Hope is not, technically, an affect. "Interest-excitement" and "enjoy ment-joy," as defined by Silvan Tomkins in his important psychoanalytic work on affect, however, suggest the possibility of hope.1 These positive affects defined by Tomkins are experienced in the present time of the sub ject, while hope is oriented toward the subject's future. Hope refers to the gratification of expectation, the fulfillment of desire, of necessity in the future rather than the present; hope, to state a truism but one that must be noted, is optimism, either willed or genuinely felt, concerning the future. As one of the three cardinal virtues defined by the Catholic Church, hope is the desire and expectation of salvation or etemal joy, attained by means of faith in God. Secular definitions of hope, particularly that of Ernst Bloch in his great, three-volume tome The Principle of Hope,2 also conceive of hope as integral with the commitment to, belief in, and constant work toward some version of a future utopia, or at least a utopian future. While Bloch's utopia claims to comprehend process rather than telos, the achievement of utopia in his socialist vision can be seen as occupying the same universe of discourse, though material and political rather than supernatural and religious, as that of the Christian achievement of etemal bliss. I would argue that, although hope is not, strictly speaking, an affect, it represents an orientation toward the future that encompasses continuing conditions for the possibility of the positive affects interest-excitement and enjoyment-joy rather than an orientation toward the future (despair) that foresees the obliteration of those conditions and therefore of any form of positive affect. Further, used in a social/political rather than an individ ual/psychological context, "hope" implies the future possibility of positive affect not, or not solely, for a particular subject in the limited context of her or his own life, but for an aggregate of beings, ranging in size from a particular group (whales, for example, or women) to the largest level of "life" or "the planet." A great deal of contemporary popular literature is devoted to the ques tion of hope. The immensely successful genres of self-help, romance, mem oir, New Age spirituality and ecospirituality, ecofeminism, eschatalogical religious speculation and fantasy, and books about salvific human connec 141</page><page sequence="2">tions with nonhuman animals consistently offer hope as their product, their lure, their bottom line.3 Despite, and because of, the all-too-apparent and myriad causes for despair in the current historical moment-with despair, a cardinal sin balancing hope as a cardinal virtue, existing in a sim ple binary with hope as its opposite, a thoroughly negative orientation that denies the possibility of future conditions enabling positive affect-hope sells. Hope also literally sells: one of the currently fashionable plastic wrist adornments on the market, which one can order easily on the internet (see the "hopebracelet" website),4 is a blue bracelet, signifying the "blue states," which has printed on it simply the word "HOPE." This bracelet makes explicit the linkage of spiritual and political concerns that increasingly characterizes the present moment and that interests me here. In this essay I will discuss a best-selling book that engages many of these popular dis courses, straddles a number of genres, both popular and elite, and reveals, often unwittingly, ideologies upon which a certain contemporary strategy for hopefulness depends: Jane Goodall's Reason for Hope. Goodall is, of course, an iconic figure, but it is difficult to say exactly of what. Her iconicity's cluster of signification is complex and multiple. She is closely associated with chimpanzees and their preservation and protec tion, but one does not think simply of chimpanzees in thinking of her. Even her name, which could not work better for her if she had invented it herself, signifies an important cluster of meanings her iconicity includes, revolving around a pacific, accepting, maternal benignity (Goodall) and a generic, white, Anglo-Saxon femininity (Jane). Goodall suggests not just all-goodness, but goodness-to-all: her benignity encompasses not just chimpanzees but all of us, whoever or whatever "we" are. Despite the fact that she is a scientist with a Ph.D. in Zoology from Cambridge University and the author of ground-breaking scholarly scientific studies of chim panzees, she is not primarily thought of in that light. She is a "Mother Mary" figure, a Mother Teresa for chimps, our closest genetic cousins. Through her deployment of her status as mother goddess of environmen tal conservation, she has acquired the stature of Mother Teresa for us all. She is also (and discursively presents herself as) the brave, hardship-suf fering lone pioneer in Africa, the white woman-not just white but English, from the mother-of-them-all colonial power-fighting for Good(all)ness in the heart of the heart of darkness. She defangs and rebrands colonialism, shifting its bwana great white hunter image to that of nurturing, life-preserving mother, making imperialist eurocentric ideol ogy safe for the new, neocolonial world order. This dismissive characterization, while containing a large and important segment of Goodall's cultural significance, is ultimately too simple and easy, however, as we will see. In writing her off, along with Dian Fossey,5 as 142</page><page sequence="3">entirely a neocolonial fantasy figure, an icon of the continuation of the West's imperial relation to Africa, all the more insidious because of its con cealment beneath the righteous mantle of primate preservation and envi ronmental conservation (and all the more offensive because of the domi nance of white women within eurocentric feminist discourses and move ments), we miss the opportunity to try to understand the complex power of her symbology.6 Goodall's Reason for Hope is a mass-market cultural phenomenon. In addition to being a best-selling book, available in hardcover, paperback, and audiotape, it is also the subject of a PBS documentary of the same title, which aired in 1999, the year of the book's publication. Goodall's coau thor, Phillip Berman, is a well-known presence in the New Age spiritual ity scene. While Reason for Hope is by far his best-known and most suc cessful book, he had published several popular, mass-market books of New Age spirituality before 1999: The Journey Home: What Near-Death Experiences and Mysticism Teach Us About the Gift of Life (New York: Pocket Books, 1998), The Ageless Spirit (New York: Ballantine, 1992), and The Search for Meaning: Americans Talk About What They Believe and Why (New York: Ballantine, 1990). Berman founded the Center for the Study of Contemporary Belief after graduating from Harvard in 1982. According to his website: In his work as an author, consultant and speaker, Phillip is particularly inter ested in one major question: How do we sustain a sense of meaning and pur pose and find the courage to fulfill ourselves at various stages in life? Through his highly praised speeches and workshops over the past six years, Phillip has shared his insights into the nature of courage, human achievement, and the search for meaning with a wide range of people, from bankers to retired exec utives. He views his speeches and workshops as a special opportunity to share his knowledge with others and motivate them to realize their fullest poten tial both personally and professionally.7 It would be difficult for someone bent on debunking New Age spirituality to invent a more revealing paragraph about the primary audience ("from bankers to retired executives") and purpose ("motivate them to realize their fullest potential both personally and professionally") for this mode of self-help mysticism. The cover of Reason for Hope is similarly close to, per haps to the point of being indistinguishable from, a parody of New Age spirituality. Alone and austere against a background of the starry night sky, Goodall is dressed in Mother Mary's blue and in the simple jeans-and-shirt of the second-wave, feminist-cum-wilderness pioneer, with her undyed gray hair pulled back in a simple, plain low ponytail; her arms are folded in a pose suggesting the sign of the cross, her right forearm modestly covering her breasts, and her right forefinger pointing to the heavens in a pose 143</page><page sequence="4">recalling Adam's receiving life from God on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. She is bathed in a celestial spotlight, its source invisible, which also lights the foreground of leafy, rocky wilderness on which she sits, with vegetation at her feet, some vegetation dead but some green, with trees suggesting African wilderness outlined darkly in the background, and with her aus terely, classically beautiful, typically white Anglo-Saxon Protestant profile looking upward, eyes wide open, in a pose of calm, contemplative, but alert, almost eagerly ecstatic spiritual vision. This book, invoking the venerable Bunyan, Pilgrim's Progress tradition of the soul's journey toward salvation through the trials and tribulations of life, calls itself "A Spiritual Journey."8 It is written in the currently highly popular memoir mode, with emphasis on moments of spiritual epiphany. By deploying simultaneously a number of traditional and contemporary popular discourses, Reason for Hope assembles an arsenal of significant modes of cultural capital: scientific, environmental, neo-imperialist, femi nist, spiritual/religious, and autobiographical. It adds to this irresistible mix, I would argue, a relatively new mode of popular discourse: the fre quently, perhaps generally spiritual discourse of animal consciousness. In addition to academically and intellectually rigorous recent work on animal rights and animal consciousness by a range of philosophers, scientists, and "literary" (as opposed to popular or mass-market) writers,9 there is a grow ing popular genre of books about close human relationships with nonhu man animals, books that frequently either emphasize or suggest the spiri tual dimension of this connection. Some of these include, at the higher end, Joanna Burger's The Parrot Who Owns Me, Marjorie Garber's Dog Love, Vicki Hearne's Adam's Task, Caroline Knapp's Pack of Two, and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's The Hidden Life of Dogs.10 We also have the fruits of psychoanalyst-apostate Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's sentimental animal-book industry, comprised of Dogs Never Lie About Love: Reflections on the Emotional World of Dogs, When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals, The Pig Who Sang to the Moon: The Emotional World of Farm Animals, and The Nine Emotional Lives of Cats: A Journey Into the Feline Heart. Then we arrive at books such as Hope Rising: Stories from the Ranch of Rescued Dreams by Kim Meeder, which includes the following on its copyright page: "Unless otherwise indicated, Scripture quotations are from: Holy Bible, New Living Translation, Tyndale Publishers, Inc., 1996.""11 Interestingly, while the Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson phenomenon is a notable exception, most of these books are written by women (Melanie Sue Bowles, Dawn Bauman Brunke, Diana L. Guerrero, Kristin von Kreisler, Susan Chernak McElroy, Mary Lou Randour, Rita M. Reynolds, Niki Behrikis Shanahan, Kim Sheridan, Sherry Hansen Steiger, and Cheryl Renee' Webb, just to mention some of the best known authors). 144</page><page sequence="5">In the case of Reason for Hope, Goodall, with extensive help from Berman, uses conservative hegemonic social/cultural/literary narratives and discourses in the service of an urgent progressive purpose, a purpose she articulates repeatedly throughout the book: saving the planet and all its living denizens, including human beings, from the devastation and suf fering we continually inflict and from our own, seemingly terminally lethal depredations. Goodall's agenda is the agenda of everyone involved in any work of environmental, ecological preservation, animal rights, human rights and justice, or generally progressive global politics. The causes of destruction of species and environments and of suffering among humans and other animals are linked, often identical, having to do with the deadly combination of virtually unregulated global capitalism, pandemic disease, and extreme inequalities of wealth exacerbated by that capitalism and by anti-female, patriarchal religions and cultural practices, violent fragmenta tion into warring identitarian groups, and various modalities of hierarchi cal tyranny. Progressive opposition to those forces and efforts to shift the seemingly terminally destructive directions in which they are moving us are also inevitably linked, whether or not that opposition and those efforts recognize or consciously cultivate that linkage. Goodall does consciously cultivate linkages among various kinds of efforts to change the course of general destruction: as she says, hers is "a message that I feel is desperately important. A message that concerns the nature of human beings and our relationship to the other animals with whom we share the planet. And a message of hope-hope for the future of life on earth" (p. xv). But again she does so largely within the parameters of safely hegemonic, nonthreatening, largely conservative discourses, nar ratives, and institutions. She deploys these both knowingly, with authorial intent, and discursively, through unacknowledged textual structures. Those she employs intentionally or is aware of employing are the discur sive structures of religion, the family, the maternal, the personal spiritual journey, anthropomorphism, and the Romantic sentimentalization of chil dren as possessing innocent spiritual wisdom and as "[the] hope for the future" she defines as her "message." Those that work discursively through unacknowledged (that is, not overtly alluded to or self-consciously deployed) textual structures derive from the neocolonialism and the pater nalistic (maternalistic) white supremacy already noted; from male mentor ship/female discipleship and the father-daughter narrative of male-domi nated academic institutional legitimation; from the romance narrative and the heroic narrative of suffering and personal sacrifice; and from the tradi tional linkage of women to nature, in which both are subordinate to men and culture. Yet a deeply unacknowledged subversive force powering the book, I would argue, and also powering the iconicity of Jane Goodall, is the 145</page><page sequence="6">linkage of women, especially middle-aged or postmenopausal women (the shamanistic figure of the "eldress"), not with a reified, subordinated, gen eralized "nature," but with one another, through matriarchal or matrilineal structures, with nonhuman animals who are similarly unsubordinated and respected, and with a nonhierarchical spirituality, through what Donna Haraway calls the human-animal cyborg, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari call "becoming-animal," and Jacques Derrida calls "I'animal que donc je suis," or, 'the animal I follow and become.'12 I discuss the ways in which Haraway, Deleuze and Guattari, and Derrida illuminate the cultural mean ings of Goodall's iconicity and the larger cultural forces it represents else where, in a work in progress; here I will limit myself to analyzing some of both the overt and the unacknowledged hegemonic and subversive dis courses and formations undergirding Reason for Hope. It is impossible, of course, to know (without access to all the actors involved as well as to motivations and intentions of which they themselves may not be aware or which they may not be willing to acknowledge) to what extent particular textual strategies of Reason for Hope are purposefully geared toward the book's audience and to what extent they arise from the forms that Goodall and Berman's intentions most readily adopt. Given the book's bestseller status, its adaptation to video by PBS, its accompanying lectures and events, however, it is safe to assume that elements of textual strategy that appear to be geared toward and designed to appeal to a broad, mainstream, even conservative audience probably are so geared and designed. The picture on the book's cover, for example, as we have seen, employs appeals to underlying cultural associations and assumptions con necting women, spirituality, the Christian religion, and wilderness. The book's subtitle, "A Spiritual Journey," explicitly names one of the key tra ditional genres, the autobiographical narrative of spiritual conversion and ascent or the "pilgrim's progress," which Goodall and Berman deploy. I will discuss a few characteristic moments in the book that reveal the complexity of Goodall's deployments of hegemonic discourses in the ser vice of a radical agenda. The word "hope" itself embodies this phenome non most clearly: all utopian political agendas, again, are premised on "hope" or the possibility of a future that enables positive affect. At the same time, "hope" signals a safe, conventional religiosity a trust that, with divine assistance, we can all reach "eternal felicity"-which has nothing to do with radical politics. At the beginning and end of the book's acknowledgments, Goodall pro vides another revealing instance of this strategy.13 She thanks the anony mous reader (perhaps the "nanny" whom she acknowledges but does not name) of a story her sister and she heard every night as young children: the story of a competition among the birds "to see who could fly the highest. 146</page><page sequence="7">Well, of course the mighty eagle was sure that he would win. He flew slowly, gradually gaining height. Higher and higher he rose until he had passed all the others, until even he could fly no higher. And at just that moment a little jenny wren, who had hidden in the feathers on his back, flew up-and won the competition" (p. ix). Before discussing the overt use Goodall makes of this story for her purposes in this book, I want to point to the discourses it more quietly deploys. First, and most obvious, is the familiar analogy of the human soul or spirit to a bird or the use of birds to symbolize souls or spirits. Next, the notion of a competition among birds or souls invokes not just the competition over salvation that structures cer tain strands of Protestant Christianity (who is saved, who is among the elect) but also the (related, as we know from Max Weber) competitive foundation of capitalist individualism. The iconography of the eagle, aug mented by this particular eagle description, is strongly masculine ("mighty," "even he could fly no higher"). The eagle's foil, the "little jenny wren," is inferior, subordinate, feminine. The eagle's attitude and behavior, however, embody not just innate superiority but also unfounded hubris: he "of course" was "sure that he would win," but he did not win. Here the hegemonic narrative shifts in a subversive direction: the dominant, supe rior masculine figure is outwitted by the female, subordinate little jenny wren, who cleverly conceals herself in the eagle's feathers, literally rides his back to the upper limit of his power, and then flies up herself, beyond where he can go. The wit of the lowly wren-girl takes her beyond the reach of the revered, empowered male. This story is an allegory of Jane Goodall's success, won literally on the back of Louis Leakey and of the skeptical, often contemptuously dismissive male scientific establishment of Cambridge University and beyond, an establishment that for many years scorned and repudiated her findings about the complexity and sophistica tion of chimpanzee society. This story is characteristic of parables in which the humble, lowly figure outwits the proud, hubristic figure. But Goodall undercuts the hubris of the eagle in the (gendered) moral she herself derives from the parable: "For I too have ridden on the back of an eagle-an eagle whose every feather is someone who has helped me. My nanny. My teachers and friends at school" (p. ix). The eagle here is no longer an overly proud masculine fig ure who must be brought down. Rather, the eagle is restored to admirable power by being transformed into a figure of helping cooperation among humble people, most of them women. Goodall goes on to thank "the stu dents and field staff at Gombe, the board members and staff of the Jane Goodall Institute," then leaps from there to "all my wonderful friends around the world" (p. ix). In thanking first "my nanny" and "my teachers and friends at school," Goodall maintains the innocent, humble, child 147</page><page sequence="8">like, totally unthreatening tone in which she recounted the story. Antifeminist or otherwise threatened readers will not be put off here by any claim from a woman to be a powerful, proud, commanding eagle. But between the nanny and the teachers and friends at school, on one side, and all the wonderful friends around the world, on the other, Gombe and the Jane Goodall Institute stand out like an eagle among jenny wrens, led by an eagle-woman in command of hosts of students, field staff, and board members. This eagle-woman, however, also makes sure to stipulate that without the communities, mixed in every way, of people "around the world," there would be no Jane Goodall Institute. As always, she down plays her own achievement here and focuses on the common efforts of groups of "ordinary people": this emphasis is a potent political strategy as well as a function of her all-good modesty. She is both the eagle in power and influence and the jenny wren in humility as well as ultimate triumph. The complexity of Goodall's uses of this parable is characteristic of the lay ered and efficacious strategies of this book. Along similar lines, Goodall begins the book, in its introduction, with an anecdote about visiting Notre Dame in Paris in 1974. The opening phrase of this anecdote is "Many years ago" (p. xiii), setting the textual stage for an edifying and entertaining story, the opposite of the kind of stem, monitory, fact-filled, politically oriented lecture about animal rights and environmental conservation that many potential readers might fear, resent, or tune out. The anecdote itself is a story of religious epiphany, experienced by Goodall in a space sanctified by traditional European Christian religion, a monument of white colonial Europe, the ultimate scene of traditional social gender conformity: a wedding ceremony. The wedding, however, takes place "in a distant corner" and is further margin alized by the focus of the anecdote on Goodall's own aesthetic and spiri tual experience of Notre Dame: "I gazed in silent awe at the great Rose Window, glowing in the morning sun" (p. xiii). The Rose Window, fruit of human labor and aesthetic vision, cooperates with nature, the sun, to pro duce the feeling of awe, which is both a "religious experience'"14 and also an affect of both interest-excitement and enjoyment-joy. The anecdote then turns its reader's attention primarily to the music being played for the wedding ceremony: "All at once the cathedral was filled with a huge volume of sound: an organ playing magnificently ... Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. I had always loved the opening theme; but in the cathedral, filling the entire vastness, it seemed to enter and possess my whole self. It was as though the music itself was alive" (p. xiii): again it is the aesthetic that gives her spiritual joy, through art's con nectedness to all life, a connectedness, often used to define the spiritual, which also defines Goodall's political project. She goes on to say that this 148</page><page sequence="9">moment was "perhaps the closest I have ever come to experiencing ecstasy, the ecstasy of the mystic." What she dwells on in explaining this mystical ecstasy is the collective inspiration and faith of those who caused it [the cathedral] to be built; the advent of Bach himself; the brain, his brain, that translated truth into music; and the mind that could, as mine did then, comprehend the whole inexorable progression of evolution. . . . Since I cannot believe that this was the result of chance, I have to admit anti-chance. And so I must believe in a guiding power in the universe-in other words, I must believe in God. (pp. xiii-xiv) This passage comes heavily to rest on the safe, reassuring word "God," but it has traveled an unconventional path to arrive at that familiar destina tion. Goodall begins this passage with the labor of the builders of the cathe dral, without reference to revelation or divine inspiration, but rather with an emphasis on their "collective inspiration and faith"-the communal labor of cooperative effort toward a common purpose, reflected in the "soaring to the sky" of the fruits of that effort: the communal politics of planetary hope. She then turns her focus to the "advent" or emergence of the exceptional human brain, first Bach's, capable of extraordinary aes thetic production, then her own, capable of extraordinary scientific insight: "comprehend[ing] the whole inexorable progression of evolution." It is crucial that the content of Goodall's mystical epiphany is not a vision of God or angels or heavenly hosts or other unearthly, immaterial beings, but rather a vision of precisely that scientific knowledge that religious fun damentalists reject: the knowledge of the validity of Darwinian evolution. With "the whole inexorable progression of evolution," additionally, Goodall encompasses all living beings, reminding us that the magnificent human brain should be used not to undergird a sense of human superiority to other animals and forms of life but to understand human connectedness to all other living beings. Goodall then occupies a respected position in the scientific repertoire, and she refuses to attribute these remarkable phe nomena to chance. She uses the vocabulary of logical scientific argumen tation to reject chance: "I have to admit anti-chance." Through transla tion into a conventionally acceptable term ("in other words"), "anti chance" becomes "God." Anecdotes such as these, characteristic of this text, reveal the complex workings of Goodall's writing, her self-presentation, and her iconicity. She inhabits powerful hegemonic formations throughout the narrative-it is structured around tropes such as the innocence of childhood, the force of romantic love, the importance of the mother-daughter bond, the nurtur 149</page><page sequence="10">ing, enduring strength of her mother (this is at the same time part of the book's counternarrative of subversive female interconnectedness and matrilineality), the fortitude and resourcefulness of the British during World War II, the gratitude of the daughter-student to the great mentor teacher-father (Louis Leakey), the strength of maternal feeling (Goodall's feelings for her son paralleled with mother chimps' feelings for their off spring), the family (both human and nonhuman) as source of strength and support, the mystical wonder of nature (this too, of course, is simultane ously part of the counternarrative of human connectedness to all living things), and the surprising degree of anthropomorphizing of the chim panzees she studied at Gombe (she mentions in the book and takes with her on all her travels-I saw it myself-a stuffed animal, a monkey hold ing a large banana). She thus makes palatable or acceptable her radical arguments concerning-and life's work saving-those and other chim panzees, nonhuman animals in general, and the planet: our nearly annihi lated fellow species and their (and our) nearly annihilated habitats. These mostly hegemonic formations cushion the shock, for her millions of read ers, of the profoundly radical message (of "hope") she articulates-the message that we must utterly and as soon as possible cease the massively destructive practices of late global capitalism-and also of the subversive cultural space she inhabits: the space of the "eldress," the postmenopausal woman who has uncanny powers associated with nature and nonhuman animals. It is my hypothesis, really my guess, that most of whatever "hope" we have-whatever cultural-political agendas we might pursue, allowing for the future of interest-excitement and enjoyment-joy-comes packaged, cushioned, disguised, counteracted, or undercut by, but at the same time given a place to exist and possibly have some impact, within these conser vative or reactionary hegemonic formations.
