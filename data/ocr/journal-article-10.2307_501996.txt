The objectives of the season2 were threefold: first, to examine the site of the extra- mural Doric temple to the west of the city, and to recover some idea of the plan and elevation before the whole area was consumed by the relentless and mephitic advance of the city dump of Marsa Susa, the modern township: second, to continue the in- vestigation of the City Walls, begun in 1965, and furthering the work of M. Lauer:' third, to clear and identify a structure located immediately to the west of the Roman Baths, the existence of which was known but the plan and purpose obscure. Both before and after the excavation, work was carried forward on the Survey Plan, first in Frank- furt by the German firm of Aero-Exploration, and subsequently in Ann Arbor, and an accurate con- toured survey of Apollonia and its environs is now available. A few remarks about this plan may be in order here. THE SURVEY PLAN' (pl. 47, fig. I) In undertaking the further archaeological explo- ration of Apollonia, one of the principal objectives of the University of Michigan has been the pro- vision of a complete and precise plan of the site. After his exploration of the North African littoral in the early years of the last century, Captain F. W. Beechey published in 1828 an astonishingly accurate site plan,5 but his and all subsequent plans have suffered from some form of inadequacy. The new plan rectifies this situation. Apollonia is located at the edge of the sea, which has now risen above its shore line in antiquity," so that the harbor installations to the north are at pres- ent under water, and the more northerly of the two Round Towers (Tower I on the Plan) is threat- ened. The city was built on a limestone ridge running east-west along the coast, and the City Walls, most boldly visible on the Plan with a total preserved length of ca. 00ooo m., tell us that the maximum length of the east-west axis of the city was ca. 915 m. Today, the maximum preserved north-south width of the city is ca. 200 m. Clearly visible features of the Plan, as well as the City Walls, include: I) at the extreme east, and outside the City Walls, the Hellenistic theater, re- designed and embellished in Domitianic times (S on the Plan). 2) the Byzantine Palace of the Dux7 1 For a report of the first campaign, see D. White, "Excava- tions at Apollonia, Cyrenaica, Preliminary Report," AJA 70 (1966) 259-265. 2 Funds for the excavation were provided by the University of Michigan and the Corning Museum of Glass. Our thanks go, first and foremost, to Professor G. H. Forsyth Jr., Director of the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, under whose aegis the expedition took shape and flourishes. We are most grateful for the sympathetic interest and help of the Libyan Government, especially that of the mudir of Marsa Susa, and of the Libyan Antiquities Service. An especial debt of gratitude is owed to Mr. Richard Goodchild, then Controller of Antiquities for Cyre- naica, and to Mr. Awad Sadawiya, presently the Controller. The officers of the United States Foreign Service in Beida were unfailingly helpful and hospitable, and we are happy to record our thanks particularly to Mr. and Mrs. Hume Horan. Among colleagues who visited and gave us the benefit of their advice were Dr. Paul Perrot, Director of the Corning Museum of Glass, and Dr. Arthur Jelinek, of the University of Michigan. The direction of the excavation was shared jointly by the writer and Dr. Donald White. Dr. John Philip McAleer of Columbia University was the third archaeologist, and G. R. H. Wright again served as architect. Alexandra Charanis and Ann Cox, graduate students at the University of Michigan, were in charge of records, and John Galey, of Basle, was our photog- rapher. Additional drawings were prepared for us by Mr. Abdulhamid Abdussaid, and Saad Abdulwahad was again our enthusiastic foreman.

The closeness of the contour lines in the area of the acropolis, at the extreme southeast corner of the city, demonstrates graphi- cally enough the sharpness of the approach from the exterior to this point, and in the region of the theater, the skill with which geometry was applied to geography. THE EXTRA-MURAL DORIC TEMPLE About one kilometer to the west of the City Wall of ancient Apollonia, between the Moslem cemetery and the sea, lies the leveled platform of an ancient temple. Cuttings in the bedrock and fragments of architectural members were visible even before clearing.' The temple was oriented east-west, and the platform leveled at about 16.50 m. above sea level on a slight rise in the limestone ridge running along the coastline. The approach to the temple, now as in antiquity, is obliquely from the road which links Apollonia with Cyrene. Excavation was undertaken here under the supervision of Pro- fessor McAleer, and the temple, when cleared, was drawn and investigated by our architect, G. R. H. Wright. In the following comments I draw on Wright's report. After excavation (pl. 47, fig. 2) the area revealed cuttings in the bedrock to receive the lowermost course of the crepidoma of the temple, and several architectural members including, by happy acci- dent, an almost intact Doric capital. The temple was built on natural foundations: the bedrock, cut down to form a leveling course for the lowest step of the crepidoma, may be considered the upper sur- face of the euthynteria. No structural requirement demanded that the bedrock be prepared to this level over the whole area: accordingly, as Wright reports, the architect took down the rock only below load- bearing walls or supports and at the perimeter, leaving islands of bedrock marking the ambula- tories, porch and cella. Doubtless these were leveled with earth before the paving was set on them (pl. 48, fig. 3). The architect was careful to prepare solid founda- tions for his load-bearing surfaces. Many rectangu- lar cuttings in the quarried surface of the platform demonstrate where original weaknesses in the rock were cut out and repaired by inserted blocks. A good many of these have been removed, with most of the rest of the structural blocks, by stone robbers, but some remain partly prised out, some intact. The setting lines for the lowermost course, and the pryholes, were recovered, so that the disposition of the blocks of this course can readily be calculated. At this level the structure measured 31.93 m. in length and 17.30 m. in width. The Doric capital (pl. 48, fig. 4) is a highly individual one: the sides of the abacus are not verti- cal, but spread outwards ca. 2 cm. in their oblique height of i9 cm. The profile of the echinus is quite straight, consisting of a chamfer topped by a nar- row fillet. The height of the echinus is less than that of the abacus, the abacus measuring 18.8 cm. in height, the echinus 15-5 cm. While there is no curvature to the echinus in profile, it is so angled as to spread widely: the upper diameter of the col- umn measures 0.96 m., the side of the abacus 1.35 m. Masking the transition between the base of the echinus and the column neck are the usual four annulets. The capital tells us that the column was worked with the customary twenty Doric flutes. Among smaller architectural fragments recovered during the clearing, a limestone gutta (pl. 48, fig. 5) will provide valuable aid in the reconstruction of the elevation. Several other fragments are of marble and indicate that the temple may have been enriched with marble revetment. Pending further research and final publication, best mathematical calculations at present suggest that this temple was hexastyle with eleven columns on the flank (pl. 48, fig. 6). The date remains unclear. Several fragments of sculpture were retrieved from the debris covering the foundation cuttings, among which the best preserved was a sprightly putto riding a goat or a (?) tiger10 (pl. 48, fig. 7). Other fragments include a part of an over-lifesize 8 R. G. Goodchild and W. Widrig, "The West Church at Apollonia in Cyrenaica," BSR 28 (1960) 70-90o. R. G. Good- child, Cyrene and Apollonia.

THE CITY WALLS Our attention was again turned to the City Walls, in the hope of finding corroborative evidence for our proposed date for their construction, of dis- covering whether the two Round Towers (I and IV on the Plan) were built contemporaneously with the curtain wall, and to recover the plan of an enfilading Tower in its original condition. I. The Main City Gate and the Round Tower (Tower 1)11 A test trench was run across the line of the an- cient road in front of the blocked-up City Gate, from the northwest spur of the City Wall to the socle of the Round Tower. The trench ran roughly east-west, was 6.90o m. long and 1.20 m. wide. At a point level with the top of the Round Tower's uppermost socle course, a whitish cement pavement was encountered in the eastern part of the trench. This pavement gave way to rising bedrock close to the northwest spur of the City Wall, and petered out in the other direction ca. 2.50 m. from the Round Tower's socle course. Since this whitish cement does not seem to have formed a uniform pavement, we interpret it as a repair of the roadway leading into the city. To the west (pl. 49, fig. 8) a fill of masons' chips was found, which began at the same level as the whitish cement, but continued down to the top of the lowest socle course of the Tower, and extended some 2.50 m. into the trench. At the top of the lowest socle course, sea water began to seep into the trench and digging was stopped. This lowest stratum of white chips (stratum 5) yielded no coins. Sherds (pl. 49, fig. 9), however, were recovered, and since this stratum is to be as- sociated with the construction of the Round Tower, and we may suppose that the chips derive from the masons' final dressing of the blocks, they give us further evidence for the date of the Tower's construction. These sherds are black glaze, for the most part, and include one large black glaze sherd (inv. no. 66-480), glazed on both sides and of good quality. The date the sherds suggest is consonant with that arrived at in 1965 from the evidence of the Museum Necropolis: the wall system dates from no earlier than the last quarter of the fourth century. Two other trial trenches, set against the exterior of the Round Tower, failed to reveal any significant new evidence. Operations were begun to open the blocked-up City Gate, to procure more information about the date of this blocking, as well as to reveal the orig- inal construction of the gate's jambs and the thresh- old. These operations will not be concluded until next season. While it is likely that this blocking of the main thoroughfare into the city represents a defensive measure on the part of Byzantines before the impending Arab invasion of the Caliph Omar and his astute general Amr ibn el-Aasi in the second quarter of the seventh century,12 there is no proof as yet. 2. The Second Round Tower (Tower IV). (pl. 49, fig. Io) This Tower, on which the modern lighthouse stands, is located some i8o m. southwest of the City Gate. A number of small investigations were con- ducted here to make the Tower's date, construction and relation to the rest of the wall system more intelligible. The diligent keeper was reluctant to allow large-scale opening of the top of the Tower, but two soundings sunk against the inner face of the exterior wall revealed that the top of the Tower had been subdivided into small rooms in Byzantine times, as had the top of the other Round Tower (Tower I). The walls marking the subdivision into small architectural units were of flimsy rubble construction and ca. 0.65 m. wide. While the exterior of Tower I had been exten- sively repaired in later times, that of Tower IV maintains its pristine sequence of headers and stretchers for four courses above the foundations. Each course is ca. 0.67 m. high: the length of the stretchers varies from 1.6o m. to 1.8o m., and that of the headers from 0.80 m. to o.9o m. Drafted edges and diagonal striations characterize the dressing of the upper three courses. The soundings on the top of the Tower showed that the fifth course of Tower masonry was backed by a ring of stretchers placed against its inner face. Ain6 and M. L.

Goodchild.</page><page sequence="4">144 JOHN GRIFFITHS PEDLEY [AJA 71 This ring of backing stretchers had become sepa- rated from the outer wall by as much as 0.20 m. in some places, probably because of earthquake activity. Investigations were carried out at the junctions of the curtain walls with this Round Tower (Tower IV), to establish whether the Round Tower and the curtain walls were built contemporaneously. Both at the junction of the north-south curtain wall with the Tower, and that of the east-west curtain with the Tower (pl. 49, fig. ii), we found evidence to show that the curtain walls bonded with the Tower and hence are contemporaneous. Both the second and third courses, from ground level, of the east- west curtain terminate in blocks which bond with the third course of the Tower, and the appropriate block of the fourth course of the Tower (from ground level) bonds with the wall. Accordingly, though the outer face of the curtain wall is dressed in a different manner from that of the Towers, with beveled instead of drafted edges and smooth in- stead of broached surfaces, we need not suppose that this implies any chronological disparity. The builders simply wished to make their Towers dis- tinctive. 3. Chamber Tombs beneath Tower III. (pl. 51, fig. 12) While testing the foundations of the City Wall at another point, midway between the two Round Towers, and against the exterior face of the squared Tower (Tower III), two chamber tombs were dis- covered cut into the vertical face of the bedrock on which rest the foundations for the City Wall. No foundation trench was found. Bedrock here evi- dently served first as a quarry, and the two tombs were let into the quarry face at a later date. When the City Wall was built, these tombs were broken into, the best contents removed and the stone doors smashed and thrown down before the tomb en- trances. The area in front of the tombs was then filled up to the level of the bottom of the Wall's foundations with building refuse of white stone chips. Later yet this fill was cut into, and a wall placed at right angles to the line of the City Wall, against the old quarry face and half blocking the broken-open entrance of Tomb 2. The purpose of this wall is a riddle. Both tombs have much the same shape and measurements, Tomb I (pl. 50, fig. 13) 5.52 m. in length, 2.30 m. in maximum height, and 1.12 m. in maximum width: both are entered by doors ca. o.9o m. wide, and the floor of both chambers is ca. I.oo m. lower than the bedrock ledge which gives access to the tombs. Both tombs are equipped with ledges running their full length on either side, and measuring o.io m. in width: these are ca. 0.90 m. above the floor of the chambers, and served to carry the sarcophagi. This characteristic has already been seen at Apollonia, in Tomb 8 of the Museum Necropolis, found in 1965. Neither tomb offered numismatic evidence: but sherds and lamps, found in Tomb 2 and immedi- ately outside Tomb i, suggest that the tombs were reused over a period of about 150 years, and that their lifespan extended from ca. 450 to ca. 300 B.c. Tomb 2 yielded a good red-figure sherd (pl. 50, fig. 14) depicting the lower part of a draped figure, and a lamp that cannot be later than 350 B.C. 4. Tower XIV Hoping to recover the ground plan of an enfi- lading Tower in its original Hellenistic condition, we decided to open one of the Towers approaching the acropolis height, Tower XIV. It measures ca. 10.05 m. (east-west) by ca. 10.20 m. (north-south). After excavation (pl. 50, fig. 15) the Tower revealed traces of Byzantine repair in the reused masonry blocks which replaced the original headers and stretchers in parts of the outer wall (the wall is 1.37 m. wide). In spite of the masonry collapse in the northerly part of the building, there was ample evidence for a complete Byzantine overhaul. Three arches were inserted, the two southerly of which are preserved, and an east-west crosswall divided the Tower into two principal areas. Access to the Tower was from the north by a doorway 1.24 m. wide. Doorjambs are preserved to a height of 2.38 m. A postern gate through the City Wall immedi- ately to the north of the west wall of the Tower also provided an easy approach to the Tower from the exterior, as well as to the city itself. Two phases of Byzantine occupation have been discerned, though little is left of the original construction except the outer wall, and of this about one-half had been tampered with by the Byzantines (pl. 50, fig. 16). THE UNFINISHED BATHS Our third objective, within the City Walls, was the excavation of a monument of unknown iden- tity, blocks of which showed above the surface.</page><page sequence="5">1967] EXCAVATIONS AT APOLLONIA, CYRENAICA 145 This structure (G on the Plan) is located close to the sea directly west of the Roman Baths and north of the central Basilica. Aligned in rough axial cor- respondence both with church and Roman Baths, it measures ca. 9-55 m. wide and ca. 18.57 m. long. The northwest corner, as preserved, is at 5.90 m. above sea level. When exposed (pl. 52, fig. 17), this building proved to be another Bathing Establishment, of considerably more modest dimensions than the Ro- man structure to the east, and never finished. Pre- served are the foundations to floor level, the floor of the hypocaust arrangement in the three most easterly units (but not elsewhere-it was never put down) and one or two courses of the superstruc- ture." A few other blocks of the superstructure lay tumbled within the shell of the building atop the fill with which the bath was choked before its use by late squatters. The presence of these blocks, and the absence of traces of cement on the upper sur- face of most of the blocks of the uppermost pre- served course, suggest that the masonry was not stolen, but that work stopped abruptly. None of the thresholds carry cuttings to indicate that door- jambs or posts were ever used. The construction is of heavy limestone blocks varying in width between 0.75 m. and 0.86 m., sometimes squared, more often arranged as stretch- ers of irregular length, forming the width of the whole wall. These blocks are joined by a coarse whitish mortar and, where joins of the blocks were not close enough to satisfy the builders, the gaps were filled with a packing of rubble or fieldstones and mortar. The inner faces of blocks are more carefully aligned than the outer, though the inner faces of the uppermost course have been badly eroded by the action of sand and wind swirling within them, and in plan (pl. 51, fig. 18) the whole presents a somewhat drunken appearance. The apsi- dal building to the north, part of which has gone over the scarp into the sea, is not related. Though there is still some uncertainty about the interpretation of the westernmost chamber,"' en- trance to the structure was apparently intended to be from the west into a small apodyterion, and thence, canonically, into frigidarium, tepidarium and cal- darium. Three flues (pl. 52, fig. 19), of which the two smaller measure ca. i.18 m. by ca. 0.49 m. and the larger ca. 1.35 m. by ca. 0.98 m., connect the easternmost three units with the room to the west, and this in turn is linked by three flues to the next westerly unit. Accordingly we suggest that these two rooms be identified as the intended hot rooms, cal- darium and tepidarium. Of the three most easterly units, the central was intended to house the (pre- sumably to be brick-lined) furnace, and a further flue in the east wall of this unit, measuring ca. 0.82 m. by ca. 0.93 m., leads to the exterior of the build- ing, whence stoking would have been possible. Above this central unit, the testudo would have been located bearing the weight of the hot water. The units to north and south are connected to the central unit by terracotta pipes, located directly above the level of the floor, measuring I2 cms. in diameter, and presumably intended to allow the circulation of warm air. Flanking the furnace, these units may have been designed to serve as hot plunge baths, accessible from the caldarium. This conjec- ture is agreeably supported by the discovery of plugholes, 5 cm. in diameter, located ca. 0.55 m. above the floor level in their east walls, and thought- fully inserted by the builders. Other flues, similar to those linking caldarium and tepidarium, lead to north and south from the tepidarium to the exterior of the building, and may have been planned to draw the hot air through the hypocaust system from the furnace."5 A ledge was provided running around the hot rooms (pl. 51, fig. 2o), at the level of the thresholds, to support, along with the brick piers below, the suspensura 1 of the hypocaust. Only along the eastern wall of the intended caldarium is this offset course missing. No trace of the floor was found, but its intended level was indicated by the level of the sills of the rooms and by the protruding ledge. The foundations of the building were sunk to a depth of ca. 2.45 m. below the intended floor level in the westernmost chamber, the lowest course be- 13 Also preserved, atop the north-south wall dividing the putative caldarium from the furnace and plunge baths to the east, are the beginnings of a vault in rubble and purplish- colored mortar, springing westward and partially visible in pl. 52, fig. 19. 14The west and south walls continue briefly beyond the southwest corner, implying the possible existence of related units: this area will be investigated more closely next season. 15 Cf. e.g. C. H. Kraeling, Ptolemais City of the Libyan Pentapolis (Chicago I96O) 160-175 esp. 170-171. 16o A quantity of both circular and rectangular bricks, of the type used in the piers supporting a suspensura, were recovered during the clearing. All showed heavy traces of smoke and burning, but were not in situ, and presumably derive from the debris of the Roman Baths to the east, deposited here as garbage.</page><page sequence="6">146 JOHN GRIFFITHS PEDLEY [AJA 71 ing bedded on two offset courses of an earlier struc- ture beneath. This preoccupation with stability is reflected in the thick cement and rubble floor of the hypocaust, set ca. 1.85 m. below the intended floor level and found in the three easternmost units. Seismic activity may well have occasioned such precaution. In these three easternmost units it be- came apparent that the walls rest on the cement and rubble floor, and hence that the floor was not put in after the walls but is contemporaneous with them. Attempts were made to chop through the floor in the hope of finding some firm chrono- logical evidence: these efforts however were fruit- less and, after cutting through the floor in the southeasternmost unit to a depth of 0.45 m., with the thick gravelly cement continuing, were aban- doned. Some 66 cm. above the hypocaust floor in the southeasternmost unit, another floor had been en- countered, consisting of rubble and fieldstones irregularly laid, with the joins closed by packed earth or occasionally mortar. The purpose of this floor had not at first been clear, but we had removed it in order to get at the lower levels. Below it, we had come upon the flue leading westward delib- erately blocked by masonry and the two terracotta pipes leading northward and eastward also inten- tionally plugged. It appears that at some point, after the abandonment of the bath project, a higher, if less substantial, floor was laid down, but not before the flue and pipes below had been obstructed, and that the area thus formed was in functional use, perhaps as a storage bin. In this event the blocking of flue and pipes would have been in- tended to hinder the access of vermin, rats, mice and the like. The masonry, with its massive squared blocks, does not seem Byzantine in spirit, as compared with the masonry of the Palace of the Byzantine Duke close by. Yet our baths are unlikely to have been begun during the lifespan of the Roman Baths to the east. These were severely damaged in the great earthquake of A.D. 365, which rocked the whole of Cyrenaica, and were never restored to their pristine condition: their caldaria were trans- formed into cisterns. Hence, A.D. 365 is a good terminus post quem for the beginning of work on our baths. Some of the blocks in our building, to judge by the measurements and the dressing (pl. 52, fig. 21), were evidently taken from the city fortifications. This probably took place before A.D. 390, since Philostorgius (Hist. eccl. 11.8)" tells us that at that time the Asturiani, barbarians from south of the Syrtic Gulf, began to trouble Cyre- naica. Thereafter, fortifications were de rigueur, and the borrowing of masonry from the City Walls for non-military use elsewhere would not easily have been envisaged. Our structure then, was per- haps begun in the third quarter of the fourth cen- tury. Work stopped before the plumbers ever got in, and why the building was never completed is unknown. The shell of the building remained untouched, save for the floor laid in the southeasternmost unit, until it was decided to fill the yawning gaps with debris. Coins, pottery and glass were found here in great quantities: coins of Heraklios"8 recovered from the lowest levels of this fill were the latest retrieved, and suggest that the fill was all deposited at the same time, in the first quarter of the seventh century. Pottery consisted largely of sherds of gray and red ware cooking and storage vessels, occa- sionally enlivened by sherds of pseudo-sigillata: the glass, examined for us by Dr. Paul Perrot, Director of the Corning Museum, included several frag- ments of window glass, bases, feet and stems of goblets, handles of suspension lamps, and one new goblet or chalice shape. The fabric has a high manganese content, and the date is uniformly late. After the fill had been shoveled in, squatters appeared on the scene. They laid irregular floors consisting of tamped earth, haphazardly embel- lished by reused marble fragments and even a By- zantine dosseret block; they closed the entrance doorway (pl. 52, fig. 22) and the doorways connect- ing the units. They removed one of the wall blocks from the north wall of the westernmost unit, and cuttings (pl. 51, fig. 23) in the sides of the adjacent blocks indicate that this was used as the entrance. Circular stones set in the floors perhaps served to support poles for a makeshift roof. Coins from this occupation level are varied, but include examples from the reign of Phocas, and these slovenly squat- ters may be seen as the last inhabitants of Byzantine Apollonia; alternatively, they may even have been Berbers or Arabs who moved in after the Byzantine garrison withdrew to Tocra. 17 P.

Further examination of the signal forts to east and west of the city was possible, and their excavation is contemplated for next sea- son. The source of water for Apollonia in antiquity was already known to be a spring located across the coastal plain, in the first step of the Gebel as it rises towards Cyrene; this was visited, and the aqueducts which led water to Apollonia were traced, as was their course in the city itself. Further study of this aspect of the city's life will be undertaken in our next, and concluding, campaign.
