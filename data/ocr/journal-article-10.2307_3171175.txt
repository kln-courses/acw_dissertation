Liberty's armature under construction and sections through the shoulders Assemblage 19 Â© 1992 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Types of Spatial Bodies It is obvious, moreover, that mathematical organization imposed on stone is none other than the completion of an evolution of earthly forms, whose meaning is given, in the biological order, by the passage of the simian to the human form, the latter already presenting all the elements of architecture. In morphological progress men apparently represent only an intermediate stage between monkeys and great edifices. Forms have become more and more static, more and more dominant. The human order from the beginning is, just as easily, bound up with architectural order, which is no more than its development. Georges Bataille' In 1949 Rudolf Wittkower systematized a theory of harmonic proportion by uncovering a single spatial type in the domestic architecture of Andreas Palladio. Indeed, he discovered Palladio, one might say, by inventing an origin for his work.2 Wittkower's theory continues to provide a general rule for the definition of essential architectural structure: the nine-square grid. The exact geometry of this type guarantees its universal applicability. Wittkower exploits the differences between eleven of Palladio's villas for their ability to cancel each other out. For the cancellation of disparate elements manifests a "hidden" typological order: through a method of "return inquiry" the nine-square grid emerges as the universal origin of each of the villas.3 For Wittkower, the type is not merely a constellation of mathematical correspondences, but further, a system of spatial organization that functions as a unified and self-regulating body. The nine-square-grid type, through 33</page><page sequence="2">L uI0~ I</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 19 6. Villa Poiana at Maggiore 7. Villa Sarego at Miega 8. Villa Thiene at Cicogna 9. Villa Emo at Fanzolo harmonic proportion, makes each villa in particular, and the eleven villas in general, whole. Two years earlier, in The Math- ematics of the Ideal Villa, Colin Rowe used the same nine- square grid to crossbreed two pairs of twins: Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye with Palladio's Villa Rotunda and Le Corbusier's Villa Stein with Palladio's Villa Malcontenta.4 Both "progeny" seem less than natural kin to the paternal villas (the type relying on variations among the villas and never fully present in any one). It is, nevertheless, the proportional correspon- dence of these often contradictory spatial organizations that lays the groundwork for a single cubic spatiality from which a lineage of villas are born.5 For Rowe, the proportional har- mony of the spatial body founded on the nine-square grid evoked a "Virgilian tranquillity."6 Rather than continue this logic of burial and recovery of origins for architecture, might there be another way to re- spect particularities and differences without "returning our inquiry" to universal types? Today we confront a different but related problem: What is the nature of the interior of archi- tecture? What lies hidden within this interior? These ques- tions are already thematized within architecture through the erection of boundaries that establish the difference, and degree of autonomy, between inside and outside. Yet before determining where to begin with architectural interiority - which is a problem of finding an entry - we have to question the origin of the interior. In the work of Vitruvius we find the first clue to the problem of the type and content of this inte- rior space. He identified an internal "proportional balance which results from principles of symmetry in architecture." Vitruvius expressed remorse that, like a living body, the breast of architecture could never be opened to reveal the secrets of its interior.7 But the architectural orders of proportion and symmetry are not simply already present within architecture; according to Vitruvius, they have been intentionally con- cealed so that questions of interiority can be posed only within a closed harmonic system. This geometric system of proportion, as Wittkower, Rowe, and Vitruvius have argued, is itself a whole. This description of architecture as a har- monic, naturally proportioned organism is indebted to the operation of two "purloined secrets" within the inviolate interior: geometry and the body.8 The Unity of the Organism and the Eidetic Language of Geometry The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which must be most carefully observed by the architect. They are due to proportion, in Greek. Proportion is a correspondence among the measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to a certain part selected as standard. From this result the principles of symmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members, as in the case of those of a well- shaped man. Vitruvius9 Pure geometry and kinematics (and all the associated sciences for which they are the example here), then, will be material eidetics, since their purpose is the thingly, and thus the corporeal, determination of objects in general. But they are abstract material sciences, because they only treat certain eidetic components of corporeal things in general, disregarding their independent and concrete totality, which also comprise the 'material' (stofflich), sensible qualities and the totality of their predicates. Spatial shapes, temporal shapes, and shapes of motion are always singled out from the totality of the perceived body. By itself alone, then, a static analysis could a priori and rigorously recall for us that the protogeometer always already had at his disposal anexact spatio- temporal shapes and essentially 'vague' morphological types, which can always give rise to a pregeometrical descriptive science. This could be called geography. For such a subject, the rigor of eidetic assertions (like that for determining vague essences) is not at all undermined by the necessary anexactitude of the perceived object. We must indeed beware of scientific naivete, which causes this anexactitude of the object or concept to be considered as a 'defect,' as an inexactitude. Jacques Derrida'l In architecture, structure is drawn within things. As Bataille has suggested, architecture is the locale where the universality of geometry binds the base matter of temporal bodies. The regulating lines of architectural orders make a connection to the world as a whole, but also to the specific morphological characteristics of forms. Spatial types are involved in the practice of originating families of form (as in the constitution of "species" such as Wittkower's brood of villas).11 Architec- 34</page><page sequence="4">Lynn 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 11. Geometric pattern of Palladio's villas 12-13. Cartesian deformation of diodon into mola tural types organize amorphous matter. Architectural pro- portion, moreover, achieves the transcendental status of an abstract, holistic, and organic body. It adopts the logic of an organism, which is above and beyond either mathematics or matter. What distinguishes harmonic proportion from math- ematical measure is the value granted to specific ratios based on the symmetrical unity of all parts to a whole. The terms organic, organism, and organization can be used interchange- ably to the extent that they all delimit things that are whole - that is, containing both a rigid external boundary, "to which nothing can be added or subtracted without jeopardiz- ing the balance of the composition," and an interior space closed to the unpredicted and contingent influences of exter- nal forces.12 It is important to qualify these ideal bodies as whole to the fullest extent, complete to the point of exclu- sion. This organic logic of proportion is already embedded within architecture's interior. Architecture's provision for structure, use, and shelter neces- sitates an absolute and exact delimitation of internal volume from external forces. To signify this rigid sense of the interior, architecture frequently invokes the paradigm of the inviolate interior of a living body. Le Corbusier's Modular provides an obvious example of the alignment of the body with measure. Of course, the paradigmatic body is both docile and static; its particularities of culture, history, race, development, and degeneration are repressed in favor of a general model. Even the Husserlian notion of "variation" places the particular in the service of the average or mean.'3 The typology of natural orders is always underwritten by the variable measurement of difference between and within species. For instance, the evolutionary transformation "From Frog to Apollo," which appeared in the 1803 edition of Johann Caspar Lavater's Physiognomische Fragmente, exploited both the constellation of particularities and differences between the frog and the ideal man and a continuous and general faciality that regis- ters these differences.'4 Rather than reducing the differential variations between elements to a static type, Lavater employed a continuous, differentiated system of transformation. A similar method of Cartesian deformation was developed in 1917 by the mor- phologist D'Arcy Thompson to describe the transformations of natural form in response to environmental forces.15 Thomp- son provisionally aligned bodies and measure in such a way that particular dissymmetries and disproportions were main- tained as events within a deformable, supple, and irreducible geometric system of description. Geometry is no longer a static measure of invariant and unitary characteristics but becomes what Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari have referred to as a "plane of consistency" on which differential transfor- mations and deformations occur. Type itself is never present in a fixed state in an entire species. Thus a more fluid and dynamic system of measure can be employed to describe ever-changing spatial bodies through their manifestations at singular moments. In Thompson's deformations, particular information influences and transforms a general grid, making geometry more compliant to the matter it describes. The enlargement of a fish's eye, for example, is registered in the deformation of its accompanying grid. The dimensional fluc- tuation became, for Thompson, an indication of light level and water depth influencing that particular species. In this manner, the type or spatial organism is no longer seen as a static whole separate from external forces, but rather as a sensibility continuously transforming through its internaliza- tion of outside events. But within the pact of the organism and the geometric language with which it is exactly described, these fluid characteristics are generally reduced to fixed principles.16 To understand this better we must look to the language of geometry with an eye toward those moments where it de- scribes spaces and forms as whole bodies. It is in fact most likely not utility, economy, or structure that fixes architecture statically, but its prejudice in favor of geometric ideality. Ge- ometry provides the apparently universal language with which architecture assumes to speak through history, across culture, and over time. Architecture tends to employ geometries that are eidetic: that is, they are manifest visually as pure spatial coordinates; they are self-identical, signifying nothing other than themselves; they are repeatable identically; and they are absolutely translatable for all people, for all time. For example, geometry need posit only one "sphere" as a surface composed of an infinite number of points equidistant from a single 35 10.

In effect, the sphere that existed for Plato has been handed down to us identically across cultures and throughout history. "Vague" objects that are merely round may be more or less spherical yet no two are ever absolutely identical. "Roundness" itself can be defined with probability but never ideally described with exactitude. Likewise, an ideal sphere can never be realized in matter. Certain things are believed to be spherical even though their specific matter guarantees that they never achieve the pure form. Vague forms that do not repress the particular characteristics of matter are typi- cally considered to be inexact.17 Geometric exactitude, in other words, tends to transform particularities, no matter how precise they may be, into inexactitudes through mathemati- cal reduction. Its renders particularities and difference as mere variations beneath which subsists a more fixed and universal language of proportions. Proportional bodies are bound by geometric exactitude: These ideal spatial organisms are reducible and identically repeatable. They have the appeal of being stated "once and for all." In systems of proportion, architecture assumes a natural relationship between geometry, with its claims to exact measure, and the unified stasis of an organism, with its claims to wholeness. Because of its predilection for fixity and stasis, architecture has become the privileged site for the elision of eidetic geometry and holistic organization. Yet we should beware of any architecture described as wholesome or organic, for the logic of the organism is the logic of self- enclosure, self-regulation, and self-determination. Buildings are not organisms but merely provisional structures that are already multiplicitous. Where the organic is internally consis- tent, the "inorganic" is internally discontinuous and capable of a multiplicity of unforeseen connections. To disentangle the pact between organic bodies and exact geometric lan- guage that underlies architecture's static spatial types is a monumental task. Any attempt to loosen this alliance must simultaneously "deterritorialize" the autonomy of whole organisms and replace the exactitude of rigid geometry with more pliant systems of description.18 Like all forms of writing, architecture is neither exact nor inexact but "anexact."A suppler geometric description of architectural form would necessarily loosen the connection to organic models of proportional harmony and stasis through a flexible compliance to particularities. Thompson's deforma- tions, remember, subject the stasis of geometric types to dynamic transformation through the internalization of par- ticular vague, or anexact, characteristics. With a less whole and wholesome paradigm of the body, not only do typologies become dispersed, but moreover, their interiors open to pro- ductive alliances. That is to say, spatial bodies other than the ideal types are brought into affiliations with systems outside of their boundaries, where their determinacy at any point in time is available to the influences of external events. Deleuze and Guattari have proposed such a model for a "body without organization": the organic, bound by a unified and internally consistent model of the organism, is reformulated as a multi- plicity of affiliated organs without any single reductive organi- zation.'9 In architecture, the present static alliance between rigid geometry and whole organisms cannot be entirely over- come but it can be made more flexible and fluid through the use of suppler, deformable geometries. Geometry resists the play of writing more than any other language. Bataille's idea of the informe, or "formless," recog- nizes the capacity to both define and defer form within a practice of writing. This "informal" practice writes the anomalies in a manner that is amorphous. Denis Hollier, 24-26. Hedgehog flea with mites 36 . ' 1.1 "I))</page><page sequence="6">Lynn gb writing through Bataille in Against Architecture, implies that the informe of writing can only be "arrested" in form by archi- tecture. But rather than locating the refusal of form solely within philosophy, the formless might also be written within architecture by architects. The most transgressive moment of Bataille's informe occurs where the formless is found to be already contained within the "mathematical frock coat" of form.20 Informal writing within architecture leads, as previ- ously suggested, toward a different kind of alliance between geometry and the organism, resulting in anexact, multiplici- tous, temporal, supple, fluid, disproportionate, and mon- strous spatial bodies. Unlike exact geometry, informal writing accommodates differences in matter by resisting any reduc- tions to ideal form. Because of this hesitation to arrest forms once and for all, their descriptions become more compliant to the base matter they signify.2' Monumentality and Multiplicity The other type of multiplicity appears in pure duration: it is an internal multiplicity of succession, of fusion, of organization, of heterogeneity, of qualitative discrimination, or of difference in kind; it is a virtual and continuous multiplicity that cannot be reduced to numbers. Gilles Deleuze22 Architecture reserves its strongest statements for the monu- ment. The monument commemorates an event that is expe- rienced through shared (particularly urban) histories, and thus it offers a unitary and repeatable space. Therefore it is in the monument that the allegiance between exact geometries and organic models of the body are strongest. Hollier incrimi- nates architecture for its monumental mode of discourse. He executes this judgment through a critical strategy similar to that which Derrida employed in his introduction to Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry, arguing that architecture's "origin is still lacking at the beginning."23 It is the idea, again, that architecture unifies itself by continually originating ideal spatial bodies that can only be invoked after the fact of their variations. Hollier's, and Bataille's, rejection of architecture as a potential practice of writing depends on the assumption that proportional order originates in and is natural to archi- tecture. In monuments architecture arrests events in form by defining ideal urban spatial bodies in exact geometric terms. The challenge to architecture, once geometry and the body enter into a new alliance, is to write- in form - a monu- ment that is irreducible to an ideal geometric type. To refuse the transcendence of static form, architecture must begin to describe the particular characteristics of incompletion re- jected by the exactitude of geometry and the symmetry of proportion.24 37</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 19 27.

Competence for regeneration of a new head decreases from the anterior to the posterior end. Deleuze and Guattari's "body without organs" suggests an alternative to the organic paradigm of the whole body. Such a multiplicitous body is always both less than a single organism and an affiliation of many organs. Their extension of Elias Canetti's paradigm of the pack, swarm, or crowd is one model for engaging a less-than-whole building within a context that is an assemblage of often disparate morphologies rather than a continuous fabric. The behavior of the pack does not turn on the distinctions between part and whole, autonomous individual and collective. To become intensively involved with such an organization, an individual must enter into the affiliative alliances of the pack. There is a two-fold deterritorialization in becoming a multiplicity: the loss of internal boundaries allows both the influence of external events within the organism and the expansion of the interior outward. This generates a body that is essentially inorganic. For instance, within a multiplicitous assemblage, each indi- vidual defers its internal structure to benefit, by alliance, from the fluid movements of the pack. As the proper limits of individual elements (multiplicity of, say, wolves) are blurred, the pack begins to behave as if it were itself an organism (multiplicity of the pack). The pack itself is not regulated by or reducible to any single structure, as it is continually, dy- namically and fluidly transforming itself in response to its intensive involvement with both the external forces of its context and the internal forces of its members. Multiplicity describes both the assembly of a provisional group from dis- parate elements - which is less than a whole - and the already less-than-whole nature of each of those elements that are allied with the group. Multiplicitous bodies are always already entering into relations and alliances through multiple plications.25 Structures such as these are not identically re- peatable outside of the particularities of their internal ele- ments or their external environments. In architecture, the multiplicitous connections of buildings to the particularities of context are typically repressed by the proportion of exact, unified, organic spatial types. One example that speaks to the structural issues of multiplicity is the planarian, or flatworm.26 Within the body of a single planarian is a very specific con- stellation of possibilities for the proliferation of a multiplicity of bodies. The limits of this development are determined both by the internal structure of the animal and by the lines of development imposed from outside its body. The develop- ments that result along these lines can only be described by their affiliations. Affiliative Connections and the Colossus We still have something in common to them all; and using another mathematical term (somewhat loosely perhaps) we may speak of the discriminant characters which persist unchanged, and continue to form the subject of our transformation. But the method, far as it goes, has its limitations. We cannot fit both beetle and cuttlefish into the same framework, however we distort it; nor by any coordinate transformation can we turn either of them into one another or into the vertebrate type. They are essentially different; there is nothing about them which can be legitimately compared. D'Arcy Thompson27 A unique plane of consistency or composition for the cephalopod and the vertebrate; for the vertebrate to become an Octopus or Cuttlefish, all it would have to do is fold itself.... Plication. It is no longer a question of organs and functions, and of a transcendent Plane that can preside over their organization only by means of analogical relations and types of divergent development. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari28 There is in the colossal an attraction, a particular charm, to which the theories of ordinary art are hardly applicable. Frederic Auguste Bartholdi29 If, 'originally, the word [kolossos] has no implication of size,' it will come to have this implication later only by accident. What about this accident, this one in particular, which brings cise to the colossus, not the incisive cise which gives measure, not the moderating [moderat rice] cise but the disproportionate [demesurante] cise? Jacques Derrida30 I use the word affiliative to describe the system of connec- tions characteristic of a multiplicitous organism against the idea of the filiative. The latter implies the relations of a fam- ily, of proper parents and progeny. But the proper family 38</page><page sequence="8">Lynn I graf t 31. Small pieces of the planarian 32. Grafting by taking a small lack polarity as they regenerate piece from the donor (indicated similar structures at both ends. by broken lines) and placing it on the wound of the host values established through evolution often overlook the alliances of different species that develop along lines of in- volution. The distinction between the two strategies is aptly illustrated by the debate between D'Arcy Thompson, who favors essential unchanging species, and Deleuze and Guattari, who fold these species into each other. Thompson, as we have seen, situates essential differences on a fixed geo- metric plane of comparison. Deleuze and Guattari attack the essentialism of difference between these species by rendering this plane as a complex of folded connections between dis- parate species. Categories of form, such as the idea of "spe- cies distinction," provide for a return to an original type from which subsequent spatial organizations develop. These types are reinvented each time they are invoked. Any evolutionary discourse that employs straight filial lines of development and pyramidal hierarchies of species is founded on the rela- tions between families of forms. And these filial relations are weighted in favor of general principles. The prejudice toward fixed orders is achieved at the cost of repressing local differ- ences of program, structure, form, and culture. Affiliative relations, by contrast, typically exploit possible connections that occur through vicissitude. They cannot be predicted by the global systems of organization present in any single uni- fied organism. When whole systems of geometric description and organization break down, seemingly unnatural connec- tions between disparate elements emerge. The introduction into architecture of forms that are "protogeometric," or without exact measure, presents such an opportunity. Robert Venturi's paradigmatic duck is a possible multi- plicitous body. The duck is founded on sculptural, not-yet- architectural figures, generally considered to be in conflict with structural and pragmatic requirements. The assumed natural contradiction of the pragmatic by the figural denies any possibility for a complicitous relationship between deco- ration and structure. Colossal statuary invites characteriza- tion as ducks: sculptures-becoming-buildings. The scale of colossal statuary requires architectural design; yet the com- plex negotiations among figure, structure, and program are repressed in favor of an iconic and singular sculptural form. In the case of the Statue of Liberty, the enlargement of the one- 33. The graft grows into a small head. 34.

Plan of level 7 to-one scale of the human figure to the monumental scale of the city meant that its sculptor, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, had to collaborate with Viollet-le-Duc and, later, Gustave Eiffel. This collaboration, however, was not familial but unpredicted. The enlargement, "beyond theories of art," introduced an anomalous form that was neither sized nor "incised" before its entry into architecture.31 The introduction of this particular amorphous figure, the Statue of Liberty, which did not originate in architecture, provokes new connections with the conventions of drawing, measurement, construction, use and context. By beginning with bodies of disproportionate matter rather than with spa- tial types, a suppler affiliation ensues between geometry and the "thing" described. No single proper filial line ever exists between amorphous or base matter and the mathematics of form. The description of these anexact morphological types can be precise yet will inevitably require empirical methods that are compliant to the matter with which they begin. Both Venturi's duck and the colossus, through size, introduce an alien form prior to the origination of an organic geometric system of proportion. This differs entirely from a more familiar anthropomorphism wherein the body forms a link between nature and architecture through geometric pro- portional correspondences of part to whole, microcosm to macrocosm. Colossal architecture instead introduces a dis- proportionate body that both precedes and resists geometric exactitude. Despite its singularity as a sculptural object, the Statue of Liberty's multiplicitous assembly of contingent and compliant substructures results from an internal resistance to any single proper form or type. Further, the compliancy between the designs of Bartholdi and Eiffel engenders unforeseen affiliations among pylons, trusses, tertiary grids, substructures, skins, ornaments, and their various intercon- nections without appealing to contradiction. Rather, it joins figural and structural systems symbiotically. The effects of the colossal scale, then, are visible not only in the enlarge- ment of the singular body but, more important, in the unpredicted local relationships of disparate building systems. There is more than a dialectic relationship operating between Bartholdi and Eiffel. Although Bartholdi provided the original sculptural form that Eiffel was employed to structure, the 45.

Plan of level 3 work of each was altered in the bargain. The result of their combination is measured not by mere addition but by multi- plication. On close examination, Liberty's body is found to be riddled with gridded fissures. It is the site of a general topo- logical gridding that flexibly coordinates the particularities of the specific folds of the body and fabric that drape it. The rigid geometry of the hidden structural pylon infects the folded surface with a system of lines that seems arbitrary in this particular body.32 Simultaneously, the pure structure of Eiffel's pylon has been deflected to one side to accommodate the nonsymmetrical posture of a woman with an arm raised. In contrast to the Eiffel Tower, the posture of the Statue of Liberty lacks general symmetry. The particular gesture across Liberty's surface causes differential torsional adjustments to proliferate locally throughout the steel structure. More significant than either the figural influences on the grid or the gridding of the figure is the development of fortuitous, contingent subsystems between these two. The secondary network of connections between the trusswork and the inner surface - an inner webbing of hundreds of flexible members -exists only because of the affiliation between these dispar- ate systems. The elements that negotiate between the trusses and the draped body could not be predicted within either the architectural or the sculptural discourse. There is a colossal disproportion of these parts to the whole. Neither the archi- tectural nor the sculptural origin of the building can domi- nate the symbiotic network of affiliated subsystems that construct the seemingly singular iconic figure of the colossus. Thus the alliance between Bartholdi and Eiffel produces not a singular organism but a multiplicity of organs. In the archi- tectural drawings, or incisings, of the colossus, the iconic structure of the statue is diffused. Each specific cutting plane is oblique to the figure of the particular body since there is no single plane on which to project its form. The colossus is irreducible to any single measure or geometric description apart from its size. For a multiplicitous body is generated from an interaction of internal logics with external events. Nevertheless, when comparing the plans, we find that a nine- square grid more or less spans from the central pylon to the skin. Yet the nine-square bay system introduced by the struc- 41 46.

Eiffel's structure is provisional, then, rather than an essential organizational type like the nine-square grid of Rowe and Wittkower. This resistance of amorphous matter to "incisement" or reduction to proportional measure is characteristic of the colossus. Unlike sculpture, the discipline of architecture is founded on the drawing of a thing before its existence. It is the secondary, or what Robin Evans refers to as the alterior, status of architectural description that is resisted in Liberty's plans and sections.33 Its geometric coordinates come after, and are thus compliant to, the thing they describe. The ge- ometries that incise the colossus are therefore pliant and supple. The colossus is a body that cannot be reduced to its original size or simplicity, a body that resists the proportional coordination of an anthropomorphic organism. In the Statue of Liberty the architectural quality (other than firmness or structure) that distinguishes the colossus from sculpture is an aleatory commodiousness within the interior. The occupation of the folds of the dress, the blades of the crown, the strands of the hair, the muscular contours of the outstretched arm, and the profiles of the lips, nose, eyes, ears, chin, and fore- head is neither accidental nor anthropomorphic, but results from unpredicted affiliations between a network of disparate subsystems that make contingent connections between a multiplicity of spaces. The Stranded Sears Tower I have applied this alternative alliance between a suppler geometry and a body without a single organization to a recent architectural project first developed in response to an ideas competition held for the city of Chicago in September 1991; the project should be seen as a preliminary experiment and not as the full realization of the ideas presented here. The Stranded Sears Tower attempts to generate a multiplicitous urban monument that internalizes influences by external forces while maintaining an interior structure that is provi- sional rather than essential. In Chicago and cities throughout the United States, the corporate office tower has been the primary vehicle for innovations in urban monumentality. This project attempts to reformulate the image of the Ameri- can monument by reconfiguring the existing dominant icon on the Chicago skyline and the tallest free-standing building in the world: the Sears Tower. The iconic status of the exist- ing Sears Tower arises from its dissociation from its context; it establishes itself as a discrete and unified object within a continuous and homogeneous urban fabric. My project, by contrast, affiliates the structure of the tower with the hetero- geneous particularities of its site, while preserving aspects of its monumentality: laying the structure into its context and entangling its monolithic mass with local contextual forces allows a new monumentality to emerge from the old forms.34 In "The Orders of Simulacra" Jean Baudrillard described a new paradigm for the contemporary office tower in the United States.35 The old paradigm of competitive verticality has been supplemented with a desire not only for excessive size but also for excessive numbers. The double identity of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York inaugurated this tendency toward multiplicity. The duplica- tion of the towers reinforces the self-identity of the whole, as the identical twins merge into a singular monumental struc- ture. The response of the Sears Tower to this new paradigm was not only to exceed the height of the Twin Towers but to exceed their duplicity. The Sears Tower internalizes its multi- plication by dividing itself into a nine-square tower that Fazlur Kahn has termed the "bundled tube."36 Where the identical Twin Towers duplicate, the differentiated Sears Tower proliferates. The 225-foot square "footprint" of the Sears Tower is made up of nine 75-foot-square tubes, or towers; two of these tubes are 650 feet long, two are 860 feet long, three are 1,170 feet long, and the remaining two are a record 1,450 feet long. Each tube is striated into five structural bays yielding another 25 tubes per tower. Each of these 225 independent structural bays is further subdivided into three five-foot-square window bays yielding another nine-square tube within each structural bay, for a total of 2,025 tubes. These nine-square tubes are the essential structure of the Sears Tower and the spatial type of the bundled tube. In the reformulation of the bundled tube, the whole organization of the tower (the nine-square 42</page><page sequence="12">Lynn 4+ 4- -- +-- + +-H-1-+:. .+ + t- ~f + - + + t +-1+-++--ft+-+-++ I I I I I I f' 1 1 .++-t-t +-t+-++t+ 4Â±+-t--tf-+-+ +--- -+ t ++--+t+t-+-- +' ' ++++-++++-t-4- l. .. 11. 1.111.11..11 .1......, .1.,14r 50.

The nine-square persists merely as an organ, a provisional structure within a multiplic- ity of structures. The tower acts as if it were a strand: a collec- tion of "fibers or filaments twisted, plaited, or laid parallel to form a unit." This strand is both a system of interwoven fila- ments and a singularity capable of further twisting or plaiting into a larger or more complex yarn, thread, rope, or cordage. The project reformulates the vertical bundle of tubes hori- zontally along a strand of land between Wacker Drive and the edge of the Chicago River adjacent to the existing Sears Tower. The nine contiguous tubes accommodate themselves to the multiple and often discontinuous borders of the site. The relations between tubes are not exactly parallel but more or less parallel. These supple deflections engender affiliations with particular local events - adjacent buildings, land forms, sidewalks, bridges, tunnels, roads, and river's edge - that would have been repressed by a more rigid and reductive geometric system of description. Although the increments of the floor plates are generally oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the drawings, the particularities of the site often deflect any single ideal orientation in favor of multiple ob- lique orientations. The deformations of twisting, plaiting, and bending are not accidental but unpredicted, as they result from the combination of the disparate systems of over two thousand bundled tubes with local conditions. The resulting image is neither monolithic nor pluralistic but belongs to the now supple and flexible internal order of the bundled tube that is differentiated by the external forces of the river's edge, the city grid, and the vectors of pedestrian and transportation movement. The bundled tube is a possible paradigm for a multiplicitous monument. It is an assembly of microsystems that constructs an icon that is provisional. Examined closely, the unified image of the monument unravels into heteroge- neous local events. Irreducibility to any single type and the potential to participate with external systems are the charac- teristics of a "stranded" urbanism. The Stranded Sears Tower is neither discrete nor dispersed, but rather turns from any single organizational idea toward a system of local affiliations outside itself. 54.

See Rudolf Wittkower, "Palladio's Geometry: The Villas," in Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (New York: W. W. Norton, 1962). One could look to Peter Eisenman's "discovery" and subsequent interpretation of Terragni for a similar strategy: the moment that the architect speaks secrets is, for Eisenman, precisely when new spatial and theoretical types originate. 3. "Once he had found the basic geometric pattern for the problem 'villa,' he adapted it as easily as simply as possible to the special re- quirement of each commission. He reconciled the task at hand with the 'certain truth' of mathematics which is final and unchangeable. The geo- metrical keynote is, subconsciously rather than consciously, perceptible to everyone who visits Palladio's villas and it is this that gives his buildings their convincing quality" (Wittkower, "Palladio's Geometry," 72). Question en retour, or return inquiry, was developed by Jacques Derrida to describe the founding of an origin for geometry after the fact of its beginning: "Like Ruckfrage, return inquiry is asked on the basis of a first posting. From a received and already readable document, the possibility is offered me of asking again, and in return, about the pri- mordial and final intention of what has been given me by tradition" (Jacques Derrida, Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction [Lincoln, Nebr.: University of Ne- braska Press, 1989], 50). 4.

A similar system of variation can be found to underlie the defi- nition of species in morphological discourse. Perhaps the most interesting example is William Bateson's argument that evolu- tionary development proceeds through both continuous and dis- continuous variation. He held that variations precede adaptive devel- opments or any single line of mor- phological progress - a position that contributed to his character- ization by his Darwinian critics as a "theorist of monstrosities." See Bateson's 1893 text, Materials for the Study of Variation: Treated with Especial Regard to Disconti- nuity in the Origin of Species (Bal- timore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992). 6. "Perhaps these were the dreams of Virgil.... And it is possibly the fundamentals of this landscape, the poignancy of contrast between the disengaged cube and the ap- pearance of unimpaired nature, which lie behind Corbusier's Ro- man allusion" (Rowe, The Math- ematics of the Ideal Villa, 3). 7. "The human breast should have been furnished with open windows, so that men might not keep their feelings concealed, but have them open to view.... How- ever, since they are not so con- structed, but are as nature willed them to be, it is impossible for men, while natural abilities are concealed in the breast, to form a judgment on the quality of the arts which is thus deeply hidden" (Vitruvius, The Ten Books of Architecture, trans. Morris Hickey Morgan [New York: Dover Publications, 1960], bk. 3, 69). 8. "Every organism consists of a highly ordered complex of struc- tures, the majority of which are hidden in its interior....

"Architecture, consequently, has no 'created' model; it must create this. It follows an archetype, but one that does not exist independent of itself. Far more importantly, it must itself produce this archetype. Which is how the unity of plan between ar- chitecture and nature is guaranteed. By constituting itself as a micro- cosm, architecture delineates the world and projects the shadow of the great architect behind it. Without architecture the world would remain illegible. Nature is the archetype of architecture only insofar as archi- tecture is the archetype of nature. It is less that architecture itself is cosmic than that the cosmos itself is architectured" (Denis Hollier, Against Architecture: The Writings of Georges Bataille [Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1989], 35). 12. Vitruvius, "On Symmetry," 70. 13. In conversation, Jeffrey Kipnis has described a formal strategy for phenomenological reduction through variation in the search for the ideal proportion of a nose: If multiple photographs of faces, taken at the same scale, were laid one upon the other and all the variations between the particular noses were canceled, only the form of the ideal nose would remain. The ideal pro- portions of the nose would never exist in any single nose, yet they would become the transcendent or- der hidden in all noses in general.

"Yet one must know how to lis- ten otherwise than in good form(s) to hear what it says. That it is con- tinuous, compressible, dilatable, viscous, conductible, diffusible.... That it is unending, potent, and im- potent owing to its resistance to the countable, that it enjoys and suffers from a greater sensitivity to pres- sures; that it changes - in volume or in force, for example- accord- ing to the degree of heat; that it is, in its physical reality, determined by friction between two infinitely neighboring entities - dynamics of the near and not of the proper, movements coming from the quasi contact between two entities hardly definable as such (in a coefficient of viscosity measured in poises, from Poiseuille [sic], and not energy of a finite system" (Luce Irigaray, "The Mechanics of Fluids," in This Sex Which Is Not One [Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1985], 111). Irigaray describes how static characteristics are given pre- cedence in science over characteris- tics of fluidity. This inattention to fluids is linked with the proposition of "formal types" and other "sym- bols of universality, whose modali- ties of recourse to the geometric still have to be reexamined." 17. "Husserl speaks of protogeom- etry that addresses vague, in other words, vagabond or nomadic, mor- phological essences. These essences are distinct from sensible things, as well as from ideal, royal, or imperial essences. Protogeometry, the sci- ence dealing with them, is itself vague, but anexact yet rigourous ('essentially and not accidentally inexact'). The circle is an organic, ideal, fixed essence, but roundness is a vague and fluid essence, distinct both from the circle and things that are round (a vase, a wheel, the sun). A theorematic figure is a fixed essence, but its transformations, distortions, ablations, and augmen- tations, all of its variations, form problematic figures that are vague yet rigorous, 'lens-shaped,' 'umbili- form,' or'indented"' (Gilles Deleize and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Pla- teaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia [Minneapolis: University of Minne- sota Press, 1987], 367). 18. The idea of deterritorialization has a certain resonance among Elias Canetti, Deleuze and Guattari, and Rene Thom as it is a method of stabilizing a collection of individual elements or intensities that remain open to influence through dynamic interactions and exchanges. Canetti's descriptions of crowds and packs developing behaviors (growth, movement, protection) that are irreducible to any one of the indi- vidual members, Deleuze and Guattari's description of symbiotic, coevolutionary, and involutionary development, and Thom's concept of retroactive smoothing all perform a kind of expansion of territory and stability by opening a heretofore in- ternal system to external forces. See Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1984), Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, and Rene Thom, Structural Stability and Morphogenesis, trans. D. H. Fowler (Reading, Mass.: Addison- Wesley, 1975). 19. See Deleuze and Guattari, "November 28, 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?" in A Thousand Plateaus, 149-66. Here Deleuze and Guattari propose a body that is merely an af- filiation of organs (what in other contexts they refer to as "free intensities") that lacks a global or- ganization capable of unifying the disparate elements harmoniously. Such an assemblage is constructed by vicissitude: unpredicted external events put these free elements into a multiplicity of possible relations. (Hence the play in the title of their book on Spinoza's idea of "one thousand vicissitudes.") 20. "In fact, for academic men to be happy, the universe would have to take shape. All of philosophy has no other goal; it is a matter of giv- ing a frock coat to what is, a math- ematical frock coat" (Georges Bataille, "Formless," in Visions of Excess: Selected Writings, 1927- 1939 [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1985], 31). 21. The suppler "protogeometries" of geology, geography, morphom- etry, anatomy, fluid dynamics and other sciences that model particu- lar, temporal and incomplete bodies that cannot be wholly reduced are examples of such "anexact yet rigor- ous" descriptions.

What Hollier will not allow is that architecture might pro- vide a "sensuous sign" for commod- ity and firmness; that structural and functional materiality is signified by architecture in its orders, outside of itself already; or that structure and shelter are not natural to architec- ture but signified by it. 25. Plication describes the prolifera- tion of new structures either by the division of a single organism into multiple organisms, as in the ex- ample of the flatworm, or by the combination of two or more dispar- ate organisms into a composite organism, as in symbiosis. 26.

Derrida distinguishes between two kinds of lines in proportion: Cise describes the form of a line, what he also calls "incisement," and size describes the measure of that form. In the case of the colossus, there is initially neither an implica- tion of incisement (it is amorphous or formless) nor an implication of size (it is vast). 32. We might look to Edwin Panofsky's description of the arbi- trary, more or less architectural gridding of the Egyptian body as compared to the humanist practice of modular measure. See Edwin Panofsky, "The History of the Theory of Human Proportions as a Reflection of the History of Styles," in Meaning in the Visual Arts (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1955), 64-68. 33. See Robin Evans, "Architec- tural Projections," in Drawing as Idea (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1990). 34. Here the relations to "contexts" imply connections by vicissitude and alliance. The building becomes involved with adjacent particulari- ties. This differs from a familiar ar- gument of contextualism based on the evolution of a building from the general characteristics of an urban fabric. For a further discussion, see my "Compliancy in Architecture," in Folding in Architecture (London: Architectural Design, forthcoming). 35. "Buildings are no longer obe- lisks, but lean one upon the other, no longer suspicious one of the other, like a statistical graph. This new architecture incarnates a system that is no longer competi- tive, but compatible, and where competition has disappeared for the benefit of the correlations" (Jean Baudrillard, "The Orders of Simulacra," in Simulations [New York: Semiotext(e), 1983], 135-36). 36. "The basis of the Sears Tower is the bundled tube. In the Sears Tower, nine contiguous tubes, in essence, nine towers seventy-five- feet square, make up the fifty-story base of the building.
