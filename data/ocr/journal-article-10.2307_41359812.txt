Mann, M.A., F.S.A., Master of the Armouries of the Tower of London, and Keeper of the Wallace Collection Lecture I - Delivered January 20 th&gt; 1941 The connection between the fine arts and instruments of war has been a' very close one since remote ages. The goddess Minerva, wfyom the Romans identified with the Greek Pallas Athene, was patroness of both. It was only in very recent times, almost within living memory, that the connection ceased when instruments of war became mechanical contrivances mass-produced by machinery. Among the most primitive races and from the very earliest ages men have been wont to decorate the weapons which often formed their most precious possession. From the Red Indian ih his war-paint and the Zulu in his ostrich plumes to the Guardsman in his bearskin, the fighting man has been at pains to adorn himself for battle. The 'field is so vast that it would be impossible, even if I were qualified, to cover the ground in three lectures, for no period or</page><page sequence="2">Oct. 31, 194I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 74I Fig. i. - Ceremonial clubs , from New Guinea.

The prehistorian and the anthropologist are well aware of the value of the evidence supplied by arms as a means of determining culture, indicating the migration of peoples and the course of trade-routes. In most savage art there are motifs of decoration, of magical or other significance, so stylised as to be unrecognisable to the layman. The ethnologist can, for instance, recognise in the interlocked patterns carved on the arms of New Guinea (Fig. 1) the representation of the frigate bird. Allusions to birds and beasts have been reduced to an eye or a formalised pair of horns, each tribe having its own cult and each district its special style. Then, at a later stage of the world's history, it would be pretentious to claim a sound knowledge of the art of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance without being familiar with their arms and armour, so high did they rank in contemporary estimation and so exacting were the demands they made on the craftsmanship of the time. To the archaeologist, arms are familiar material ; they are often included in the grave furniture of important burials, and in general it is the finely ornamented specimens that have tended to survive. Gold, which has been used to embellish weapons since its first use as a malleable mineral, is one of the least destructible of metals. This accounts for the excellent preservation of such objects as the Scythian gold shield boss from South Russia in the British Museum, and the magnificent dagger and scabbard inlaid with lapis lazuli found by Sir Ernest Woolley in his excavations at Ur, now in the Baghdad Museum (Fig. 2), and which Mr. Sidney Smith places in the first half of the third millenium b.c. Not only does one see the connection between the fine arts and instruments of war in the decoration of arms and armour, but it was extended to the larger engines, the chariots and warships. A lofty dragon's head carved in wood, which was once the prow of a Viking boat, is one of the most recent treasures acquired by the British Museum. The mediaeval warship, with its castles fore and aft and its billowing sails painted with the figures of saints and bright with heraldry, was a work of art in itself. The . pleasure of the eye still continued to be catered for in more recent times, when ships of the line were furnished with sculptured and painted figure-heads, and their stern galleries were elaborately carved and gilt. All this has vanished only within the last sixty years, since the man-of-war has become a steam-driven ironclad. To-day the weapons which Pallas Athene has given him no longer allow man to stand on his feet and face his enemy in a scarlet coat. He has to crouch in the earth and conceal his presence as best he can by taking the drab colour of his surroundings. I hope to be able to show in the space at my disposal how sensitive were instruments of war to successive changes in taste ; how they embodied in turn, not only in their ornament but in their integral forms, the spirit of Classical culture and of the Gothic, the Renaissance and the Baroque, down to the neo- classical mode of the First Empire. And at the same time to show, from the</page><page sequence="4">Oct. 31, I94I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 743 Fig. 2. - Dagger and sheath of gold and lapis lazuli, from Ur , c. 2800-2600 B.C.

The surviving weapons of prehistoric times are numerous but of necessity fragmentary. The swords, daggers and lances did not offer a very large field for decoration, and the shields, being generally made of not very durable material, have mostly perished. Thfe anthropoid dagger of the La Tène period, so-called because its X-shaped hilt is in the form of a small human figure with extended arms and legs, is only an exaggeration of other early attempts to use anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms in the fashioning of weapons of offence. The fine hiks of the Spanish falcatas of the Iberian Age illustrate the same tendency. The bronze mounts of the Battersea shield in the British Museum, with their tenuous circular design and inlay of red enamel, provide one of the cardinal examples of late Celtic Art in this country (Fig. 3). Greek and Roman Armour In the eighteenth book of the Iliad,- Homer devotes nearly two hundred lines to the description of the shield of Achilles fashioned by Hephaestus at the instance of his mother Thetis. It would take too much space to quote the whole passage, but I will give sufficient* to show how closely the imaginative arts were bound up with the conception of what instruments of war should be : " And on the fire he put stubborn bronze and tin and precious gold and silver ; and thereafter he set on the anvil block a great anvil, and took in one hand a massive hammer, and in the other took he the tongs. " First fashioned he a shield great and sturdy, adorning it cunningly in every part, and round about it set a bright rim, threefold and glittering, and therefrom made fast a silver baldric (теХа/лыуа). Five were the layers of the shield itself, and on it he wrought many curious devices wTith cunning skill. . " Therein he wrought the earth, therein the heavens, therein the sea, and the unwearied sun, and the moon at the full, and therein all the constellations wherewith heaven is crowned - the Pleiades, and the Hyades and the mighty Orion, and the Bear, that men call also the Wain, that circleth ever in her place, and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of the Ocean. " Therein fashioned he also two cities of mortal men exceeding fair. In the one there were marriages and feastings. . . . But about the other city lay in leaguer two hosts of warriors gleaming in armour. . . . " Therein he set also soft fallow land, rich tilth and wide, that was three times ploughed. . . . Therein he set also a king's demesne-land, wherein labourers were reaping, bearing sharp sickles in their hands. . . . " Therein he set also a vineyard heavily laden with clusters of grapes, a vineyard fair and wrought of gold ; black were the grapes, and the vines were set up throughout on silver poles. And around it he drave a trench * From the translation by A. T.

In the heroic age the principal materials were bronze, tin, and the precious metals of gold and silver. Iron was known and was used for spear heads and the like, but not for the construction of defensive armour. The equipment of the Greek of historic times can frequently be seen on Greek vases, and specimens of bronze helmets, cuirasses, greaves and shields have survived. The archaic vase in the British Museum depicting the combat between Hector and Menelaus over the fallen body of Etiphorbus {Iliad XVII) shows the warriors in crested helmets, cuirasses and greaves, with bold designs upon their circular shields, on Hector's an eagle, on Menelaus' an arrangement of scrolls (Fig. 4), Thin bronze is not a very difficult material to work, and defensive armour was frequently embossed with ornament and engraved. For example, an early pair of bronze greaves from Ruvo in the British Museum (Fig. 5) are embossed on each knee with the figure of a Gorgon running with a snake in each hand, partly in relief and partly incised. The eyes were originally set with gems and the teeth and tongue are of ivory. The Roman legions of Imperial times were issued with a practical, uniform equipment that allowed little scope for decoration, apart from their rectangular convex shields which bore the insignia of their legions. But officers of rank had their armour embossed and decorated, and this was also the case with the armour worn in the arena by gladiators, of which excellent examples are preserved in the Naples Museum and at St. Germain-en-Laye. The cuirass worn by the Emperor Hadrian (a.d. 76-138) on his statue in the British Museum is shown as embossed with a winged Gorgon's head with knotted snakes in the centre, below which is a winged female figure, probably Victory, holding in one hand a cornucopia and in the other a palm-branch, and beneath her is figure of Abundance reclining with fruits in her lap. On either side of the central composition are two captives, each kneeling at the foot of a trophy composed of helmets, cuirasses, shields and tunic. The British Museum also possesses a good example of a Roman scabbard found at Mainz in 1848. The sheath (Fig. 6) is of wood plated with bronze embossed with a laureate medallion of the Emperor Tiberius in the centre, and at the top a relief of Tiberius enthroned and welcoming Germanicus, with a figure of Victory behind him. On the chape is a building with four Corinthian columns, within which are an eagle and Roman standards, and below an Amazon wearing a Phrygian cap and holding a double- headed axe. The " Dark Ages " The period following the fall of the Roman Empire, commonly known as the Dark Ages, but which modern research has been steadily clarifying, offers among its relics the sword of Chilperic, King of the Merovingians (died 584 A.D.), which was found in his grave. The hilt and scabbard are elaborately mounted</page><page sequence="10">Oct. 3 lì 1941 JOURNAL ÓF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 749 in gold and set with red enamel in the same way as the buckles and brooches of the time. It can be contrasted with the sword of Charlemagne of some two hundred years later, also preserved in the Louvre, to reveal how both form and decoration have changed under the influences which had been at work during the interval. The bronze shield boss found at Bidford-on-Avon and now preserved in the Shakespeare Memorial Museum at Stratford, is a much prized example of Anglo-Saxon art, and has been described at length by Mr. T* D. Kendrick* for the stylistic features which it exhibits. The body armour worn during this period was of a simple nature ; the shirt of interlinked mail had been known to the Romans and was also used by the Vikings, but its intricate and pliable nature did not lend itself to decoration. In the helmets, swords ajid axes of the Vikings, however, we find excellent exponents of Scandinavian ornament in its successive phases, and I have to thank Mr. Kendrick for enabling me to illustrate the Lannen axe (Fig. 7) in this connection.

The shields of the Norman horsemen in the Bayeux tapestry show various patterns of lines and stripes and sometimes an animal, but they have not yet been formal- ised by the art of heraldry. This gradually took shape during the eleventh century. From the earliest times men have never failed to decorate the broad surfaces of their shields. But the art of heraldry is distinguished from the devices seen on the shields of the Greeks and the Romans, as well as the Normans, in that it was codified in strict relation to paternal succession. The general adoption of the system of personal and hereditable armorial bearings spread with rapidity throughout Christendom. Originally devised for use in war as a means of marking out the leader, it had to be of a simple and conspicuous nature, like the art of the poster. It was soon employed to ornament everything which the leader possessed, from the tiles on the floor of his castle to the weathervane on its roof. In the thirteenth century armour consisted of a shirt and leggings of mail, and a great helm. The mail shirt was covered by a long surcoat which afforded an excellent field for embroidery of the owner's arms. The Sieur de Joinville describes a conversation he had with his master, St. Louis of France, deploring the changes since their youth, when men were content with simple surcoats of green, but now indulged in the vanity of garments of divers hues. English embroidery enjoyed a high reputation on the Continent, where it was known as opus anglicanum. A splendid example of a horse's trapper of crimson velvet embroidered with the golden leopards of England is preserved in the Musée Cluny at Paris, and was a striking exhibit in the Exhibition of British Art at Burlington House in 1934. The shield and the surcoat, and next the trappings of the horse, and soon every little detail of sword hilt (Fig. 8), sword scabbard, belt, buckles and bridle, were heraldically embellished. Last of all a great crest was set upon the helm, which now concealed the features of the wearer. Heraldry was one of the happiest instances of the alliance "of art with war, because it was not only pleasant to the eye, but of great practical value. Men who could not read books were able to read heraldry at a glance. It fulfilled a hundred useful functions. Henry IV at the Battle of Shrewsbury had four other knights clad in his arms to divert the attention of his enemies, which recalls the words which Shakespeare put into the mouth of Richard III on a similar occasion at Bosworth : " I think there be six Richmonds in the Field ; Five have I slain to-day instead of him " At the Battle of Barnet in 1471 the fortunes of the day were turned when the star of the de Veres worn by the Earl of Oxford's men was mistaken in the fog for the sun of York, and two bodies of the Earl of Warwick's army attacked each other before the mistake çould bç rectified»</page><page sequence="12">Oct. 31, 194I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 751 Fig. 8. - Sword of Santa Casilda , the pommel enamelled with a coat of arms, fourteenth century. Instituto del Conde Valencia , Madrid</page><page sequence="13">752 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, I94I Castles If one may count castles as instruments of war, one can still see carved upon the battlements of Bothal Castle the arms of the Northern lords, and on the fireplaces at Tattershall Castle in Lincolnshire the arms and badges of the Cromwell family. Abroad, heraldry enjoyed a vogue even greater, if anything, than in this country. One finds, for instance, sketched upon the plaster walls of the interior of the Castle of Fracstein in the Grisons a charming series of freehand drawings of shields of arms and crested helms. The instances can be multiplied indefinitely. In connection with castles and their relation with the arts, it should be noted how faithfully their entire structure reflected national characteristics. There is no mistaking the fish-tailed " ghibelline " battlements of Northern Italy, and the witch-like cluster of pointed turrets and half-timbering of Schloss Eitz on the Mosel are equally indicative of Germany. Again, the cubos on the Castle of Coca in Old Castile could belong to no other country than Spain, while the castle seen in the background of one of Fouqueťs miniatures in the Très Riches Hemes , with its round towers and gables set against the sky-line, is as indubitably French. That castles were appreciated for their artistic merits can be gathered from contemporary chronicles and romances. Dino Compagni frequently exalts the beauty of the walls and towers of Florence which, he had helped to build. Unfortunately one cannot do the same for our modern sandbags and barbed wire. The frequency with which hill-top castles and walled cities were intro- duced into the landscape backgrounds of the Old Masters is further evidence of the frank pleasure taken in their appearance. Later Medieval Armour The handicrafts had now attained great technical skill, and the various arts freely borrowed their motifs from each other. One finds Gothic architectural details of arches and pinnacles reproduced upon the scabbards of swords and daggers, and miniature castles upon buckles and belts. In the course of the fourteenth century mail was being replaced by plate armour, and in an attempt to lighten the weight substitutes for iron, such as cuir-bouilli, were tried. This latter material lent itself easily to moulding and gilding. Textile coverings and paint were freely employed. The inventories record that Sir Simon Burley had a helmet half green and half crimson, and Piers Gaveston's ailettes were fretted with pearls. The warrior on his horse was a blaze of colour from crest to fetlock. Instead of trying to conceal himself, as he must do to-day if he is to survive, he did his best to advertise his presence. His retainers followed his standard as it went forward, or were expected to rally to it in defeat. The covering of plate armour with paint and textile, and especially the wearing of armour of the brigandine type, that is to say, composed of small plates on a flexible foundation and covered with velvet or silk studded with ornamented rivets, explains the frequent allusion in the old romances to Red Knights and Green Knights.</page><page sequence="14">Oct. 31, I941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 753 The effigy in Frankfort Cathedral of Gunther von Sdhwarzburg, d. 1349 (Fig. 9), shows very little metal visible to the eye, but as now restored is bright with colour.

Though to-day these figures are usually stripped of their polychrome and gesso, there are a few cases where sympathetic cleaning has brought to light long- hidden colouring and diapered patterns. The removal of dirt and varnish from the Black Prince's gilt-bronze effigy in Canterbury Cathedral by Professor Tristram a few years ago was a revelation, and Mr. Howgrave Graham has done the same for the kneeling figure of Lord Dispencer on the canopy of his monument in Tewkesbury Abbey. Lecture II. - Delivered January 27th, 1941 FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURY ARMOUR " Gothic " Armour In the opening years of the fifteenth century, the platers, as the new workers in plate armour were called, had perfected their craft, and for the first time the complete articulated cap-à-pie harness of " white " armour was evolved. The increased mobility that had been achieved by improved methods of construction led to the discontinuance of the substitutes for metal such as cuir bouilli , while appreciation of the nature of the metal itself led to the partial disuse of the textile coverings òf velvet and silk which had made the knights of the fourteenth century as gay as peacocks. The merits of burnished steel were further enhanced by the use of ornamental brass borders. These had been already introduced in the fourteenth century, as is exemplified by the armour of one of the Vogts of Match, which has the distinction of being the earliest suit in any way approach- ing completeness, that has come dowTn to us having been preserved, since the time it was delivered by its maker, at the Castle of Churburg in South Tyrol. The brass borders are in this case incised with inscriptions of minuscule lettering : Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat , on a hatched ground. It is not unlike the lettering found upon chalices and secular plate of the same period. In the course of the fifteenth century these brass borders came to be used more freely and were decorated with heart-shaped piercings, the edges being cut into trefoils, while the surface of the metal itself is relieved by subtle shell-like ridges and flutings. The plates themselves are curved and pointed. It is for this reason that German armour of the second half of the fifteenth century has received the name of " Gothic." The term is no more applicable than its use in architecture, from wThich it was borrowed, but in armour terminology it denotes a much shorter epoch, namely between about 1440 and 1500. This is regarded by many as the apogee of the armourer's craft. The skill of the plater had</page><page sequence="16">Oct. 31, I94I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS j 755 Fig. 10. - " Gothic " equestrian armour of Panera z von Freyberg , с. 1470 , from Hohenaschau , Bavaria.

(Fig. 10.) In Italy this Gothic style did not obtain to the same extent. Milanese armour of the fifteenth century is more rounded in outline, blunter in its forms, and the surface nearly always smooth. Only in the long piked cuffs of the gauntlets and the elegant shaping of the tassets can one see a hint of the Gothic style. Though Italian armour of the fifteenth century tended to be plain in form, it was compensated by elaborate plumes and appurtenances of a most gorgeous kind. Uccello's painting in the National Gallery of the Rout of San Romano shows the most fantastic erections upon the close-helmets of the combatants ; and these appear again in Piero della Francesca's fresco of the defeat of Maximianus by Constantine , in the Cathedral at Arezzo. The first effects of the Renaissance are to be seen on the sallets covered with crimson velvet and overlaid with mounts of gilded copper (Fig. n). The Gothic artists found a congenial medium in the " ivory " saddles, that are really made of wood with a covering of stag's horn, carved and painted with scenes of gallants and damsels, and scrolls containing dialogues between them (Fig. 12). The same medium is used on the unique crossbow bearing the arms of Fels- Colonna of South Tyrol in the Wallace Collection, the tiller of which is entirely covered with religious, romantic and secular scenes carved in low relief. Much elaboration of Gothic detail, too, is found on the hilts and scabbards of swords, such as that of Duke Christoph of Bavaria in the Schatzkammer at Munich. The hilt is ornamented with little figures based on existing designs by the Rhenish artist known as the Master of the Hausbuch, and the close-set intricate foliage is the counterpart in miniature of the kind of architectural detail Fig. il. - Steel sollet covered with crimson velvet and with gilt copper ornament.

S. and Israhel von Meckenem. Even so small an accoutrement as the spur was made a vehicle in miniature of Gothic taste (Fig. 13). The Renaissance : Introduction of Etched Decoration. Hitherto we have seen the extent to which the designers and makers of arms borrowed from the Fine Arts. We now come to an occasion when it was the fine arts that put themselves under an obligation to the armourers. The art of etching upon a metal plate in acid seems first to have been employed as a means of decorating armour in the fifteenth century, and from this beginning it was adapted for reproducing prints on paper taken from etched plates. The inscriptions and scroll-work patterns traced in punched dots upon the steel itself were the forerunners of linear ornament executed by means of etching, that is to say, by tracing lines with a needle through a painted or waxed coating, and then biting with aqua fortis into the surface of the metal thus exposed. One of the earliest users of this method of enrichment not only signed his name, but is also referred to in the correspondence of the Dukes of Mantua and the Marquesses of Ferrara. He was a goldsmith of Ferrara, one Salamone da Sesso, a converted Jew, who took the name of Ercole dei Fideli. He became proficient in the etching of sword blades, which he signed with the signature " Opus Herculis." He decorated with his needle the sword of Caesar Borgia, which b ig. 14. - Breastplate , etched and formerly gilt , with a frieze of the Virgin and Child between St. Margaret of Antioch and St. Barbara.

Ercole's designs, very typical of the pagan art of the new movement, are etched with a light touch upon a background of diagonally hatched lines such as were used by the goldsmiths of the time. . He was not the only exponent of this manner, which one also finds applied to the surface of armour and in particular to the globose breast plates of about 1 500 which bear along the top a broad frieze containing compartments of the Madonna and Child and appropriate Saints (Fig. 14). One of these armours in the Museo Stibbert at Florence provides an interesting link with the great genius of Leonardo da Vinci. Etched upon the elbow is a prancing horse- man directly based on Leonardo's studies for his equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza. A number of his sketches for this are preserved in the Royal Library at Windsor. About the same time that Ercole dei Fideli was etching the blades of his cinquedeas , the brothers Hopfer of Augsburg were executing the etched decoration on armour made there in the Colman workshops, and also broadcasting their designs in the form of prints. At the outset the German style is quite distinct from the Italian, and used a background consisting of granular dots, instead of diagonal hatching. Greater names than those of Ercole and the Hopfers now come upon the scene. Both Hans Holbein the Younger and Albrecht Dürer took an active part in the decoration of arms and armour. Holbein has left us his drawings of elaborate Renaissance daggers and their sheaths including a sword hilt designed for Prince Edward, later King of England, at Basel, and there are several instances extant of dagger sheaths pierced and chased with his composi- tion of the " Dance of Death " (Fig. 15). In fact he has given his name to this type of Swiss dagger which is commonly known as a " Holbein dagger." There exist in the Albertina and elsewhere a series of designs for the decoration of elements of armour executed and signed by Dürer between the years 15 16- 17- 19. These have been identified as designs for the silver armour which the Emperor Maximilian is known to have ordered at this time from his court armourer Conrad Seusenhofer. Dürer also illustrated for Maximilian his Kriegsbuch which includes drawings of instruments of war, some of which may be claimed as being precursors of the modern tank, much in the same way as, a generation before, Leonardo da Vinci had designed engines of war and left behind him numerous drawings of mechanism, one of which is the first recorded instance of the wheel-lock system for the discharge of firearms. A conspicuous feature of the style of German armour, associated with the name of Maximilian - although most of it was produced during the ten years after his death - is the system of parallel fluting which had been evolved from the more delicate and less rigid fluting of the Gothic period. It became customary to decorate the borders of armour, in varying depths up to an inch and a half, and also down the centre of the flutes, with running floral decoration etched and gilt. Close observation enables us to distinguish certain distinct styles, although</page><page sequence="21">760 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, 194I it is difficult to supply the names of artists with certainty. As I have recently treated this subject in some detail elsewhere* I need only touch upon it here. There is one style which is called the " Hopfer style," although it is not certain it is from their hands, in which the drawing of the foliage is strong and vigorous and the leaves and tendrils are mixed with monsters, cupids and birds. Then there is the looser and more shallow style associated with the armour of the Dukes of Brunswick, although possibly actually executed at Dresden, and other styles too numerous to describe. About the middle of the sixteenth century one finds the German and Italian styles of etched ornament, hitherto so distinct, drawing together and exchanging * " The classification of etched decoration on armour."

For instance the Italians dropped the background of diagonal shading and adopted the granular ground of the Germans. Although the decoration continued to be very rich and sumptuous, it had, in the second half of the sixteenth century, lost much of the freedom of its earlier years. The armours signed with the name of Pompeo della Chiesa of Milan are among the most resplendent produced in the closing years of the sixteenth century.

These armours were exported all over Europe and appear repeatedly in the portraits of noblemen of the time. Embossed Ornament A few years after the introduction of etched decoration of armour, a further method of enrichment was evolved. This was the embossing of the surface of armour with ornament in relief as had been done before in classical times. One of the earliest instances of this process is the horse armour at Vienna embossed, etched, blued and gilt, with the double-headed eagle of the Emperor as the dominant motif. No photograph can do justice to the way in which the feathers of the wings are rendered by delicate blueing and the series of shields of arms etched along the bridle. Another early instance of the use of embossing is the so-called Burgundian Bard presented by the Emperor Maximilian to King Henry VIII of England, which is now in the Tower of London. This is freely embossed on chanfron, peytral, crupper and saddle with the crossed timbers and fire-steels of the House of Burgundy and its Order of the Golden Fleece, engraved and originally silvered. It is one of our most precious national possessions. Armour, too, was occasionally fashioned in imitation of the puffed and slashed civilian costume of the time. As this was quite unpractical, the fashion lasted for only a few years. The vogue reached its most exaggerated proportions in the armour of the professional soldier Hans von Rogendorf at Vienna, and the huge sleeves of one of the Radziwill armours now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. We have now reached the stage when the arts have taken such complete possession of instruments of war that they are beginning to interfere with their function. It is obvious that the raised decoration of embossed armour is bound to impair the smooth glancing surface, which contributes, as much as does the resistance of the metal itself, to its protective qualities. The Renaissance had now spread from Italy to Northern and Central Europe bringing with it the return to bold, classical forms. Damascening The artist-craftsmen next began to embellish armour with damascening. Damascening, in this sense of the word, denotes the inlaying of patterns in gold and silver, which were hammered into lines scored in the surface of the iron to receive them. The skill attained in this art was of a very high order. The armours made for kings and princes in the second quarter of the sixteenth century are some of the finest ever produced, if looked upon as works of art. The return to classical forms expressed itself without restraint in the parade armour of the time, the elaborately embossed casques in the form of dolphin's</page><page sequence="24">Oct. 31, I94I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 763 heads and lion's masks, and bucklers embossed with classical scenes often taken direct from the designs of artist^ engravers of the time. The broad handling of the casque in the Wallace Collection embossed with a human face (Fig. 17), although hammered out of steel, inevitably invites comparison with a Renaissance bronze. Perhaps the most thorough-going throw-back of this time is the classical armour made by Bartolomeo Campi for Charles V in the Royal Armoury at Madrid. This was something of a tour de force , and Campi signed it in full, together with a statement that he made it for the Emperor in the space of one year. The German and Italian armourers vied with each other in the production of these conceits and were encouraged by the patronage of Charles V. The rivalry pIG - Renaissance Casque embossed in the form of a grotesque mask , possibly by the Negr oli, с. 1520. Wallace Collection of the two schools is expressed on a shield of Philip II by Desiderius Colman of Augsburg, in which a warrior with the word " Negrol " on his shield (denoting the name of Negroli, one of the armourers of Milan) is shown being overthrown by a wild beast. The same Augsburg School produced for the Emperor Francis I a shield in which a German knight in full armour is. shown being pursued by a huge Gallic cock. At Milan the Negroli were followed by Antonio Piccinino, who is mentioned by Paolo Morigia in his Nobilità di Milano as among the great artists of his time at Milan, and as having excelled in damascening. It is there stated that he made an armour for Alessandro Farnese which has been identified with the embossed Farnese armour at Vienna (Fig. 18). It closely resembles the armour in the Wallace Collection which used to be known as the armour of Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara. Piccinino's taste was inferior to the Negroli' s and his designs are less vigorous and assured, though his wTork still gives an impression of great siimptuousness.

The motifs of armour decoration are those which one expects to find in any ornamental work of the sixteenth century, with running vines, interlaced strap- work, grotesques and classical medallions. The relationship between the armourers and goldsmiths was always intimate. Some of the motifs are very close to those used by contemporary bookbinders and in embroidery. I have already spoken of their relationship with pictorial artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Fig. 19. - Enamelled armour of Nicholas Radziwill , c. 1560, by Kunz Lochner of Nürnberg.

Not so long ago most richly embossed targets of the XVIth century were ascribed to Benvenuto Ceillini, but on no better evidence than most other works attributed to his versatile genius. The name of Giulio Romano, the favourite pupils of Raphael, is frequently connected with the armourer's craft, though we cannot point to anything certainly from his hand. But Giorgio Ghizi of Mantua, etcher, damascener and goldsmith, has left his signature in full on the very richly embossed and damascened buckler in the British Museum, which is one of the principal treasures of the Waddesdon Bequest. Enamelling Besides embossing, etching and damascening, enamelling was also used. Fig. 20. - Rapier of the Emperor Charles V , Milanese , c. 1550, the hilt gilt and enamelled in white and black .

(Fig. 19). The decoration of sword hilts was often of a most elaborate nature, the guards being richly chased and gilt, often also enamelled like that of Charles V (Fig. 20). Painted Decoration Painting was still occasionally employed in the embellishment of armour. Not in the way in which it had been used in the fourteenth century, but in the actual application of pictorial compositions, especially to the outer and inner surfaces Fig. 22. - Baroque casque , French mid-seventeenth century of shields. There is in the British Museum a magnificent painted pavise of the fifteenth century which, if it were not a shield but had been painted on a flat rectangular panel, would be as familiar to the public as any picture in the Flemish rooms of the National Gallery (Fig. 21). It depicts a knight kneeling before a lady, with the figure of Death hovering behind, painted in natural colours upon a gold background stippled with red and black dots. Some of the circular shields of the sixteenth century are painted with battle scenes or other subjects in grisaille on the inner surface. There is a good example in the possession of the Duke of Norfolk at Arundel Castle, and others of the same kind are in the Wallace Collection and the Tower of London. Pageant shields were often made of embossed and tooled leather, and it is interesting to note that some of these pieces of armour, shields, helmets, chanfrons, etc.,</page><page sequence="30">Oct. 31, 1941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 769 made of embossed leather, also had their counterparts made in steel. Possibly they were supplied as alternatives, so that on certain occasions the owner could relieve himself of carrying the parade armour of steel and use the lighter substitute of leather. Such productions go to show how closely connected with the fine arts were the armour and weapons of the sixteenth century at a time when the arts held swTay over men's minds, more completely perhaps than at any time before or since. The prestige of a fine armour lingered long after its use had been abandoned in the battlefield, and one finds parade armour as late as the seventeenth century (Fig. 22). Portrait painters continued the convention of depicting their more distinguished sitters in armour down to the time of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Lecture III. - Delivered February 3 rdy 1941. FIREARMS. The introduction of firearms, which were first used in Europe in the first quarter of the fourteenth century in the form of cannon, had no immediate effect upon defensive armour. For one thing men had to be specially trained in their use, and firearms were not sufficiently numerous to make themselves felt tactically for a considerable time. The early cannon, and its offshoot, the early hand gun, were at first verv primitive affairs ; but improvements in the second quarter of the sixteenth century evolved pistols for the cavalry and sporting guns for the gentry, and thenceforth we find these weapons coming under the same artistic influences that affected other arms. Furthermore, the employment of cannon made of bronze brought the bronze founder into the business. The same artists who cast groups of sculpture and architectural ornament used their furnaces for the casting of cannon by the cire perdue process. The fact that a certain type of cannon is called a " mortar " perpetuates an early resemblance to the bronze utensils of the chemist's shop, and we know what exquisite specimens of Renaissance art these chemists' mortars could be. But let us leave for a moment the subject of cannon and trace the development of their smaller derivative, hand firearms. The latter were at first ignited by hand and then by means of a match-lock. The invention of the wheel-lock late in the fifteenth or early in the sixteenth century gave to firearms their first mechanical means of discharge. As the mechanism was expensive to make, one finds it only applied to firearms of good quality, and these inevitably became the object of decoration of an elaborate nature. The wooden stocks were inlaid with complicated designs in ivory, bone, mother-of-pearl and metal. Barrels and locks were chiselled and damascened. The powder flasks and primers</page><page sequence="31">770 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, 1941 which accompanied them were made of a great variety of materials, stag's horn, metal or wood, and their sides were freely embossed or inlaid with scenes of mythology or the chase and decorative ornament. Most of the makers of firearms stamped their productions with their marks, and certain districts began to specialise in their production. Late in the sixteenth century we find the Sadeler family of Munich producing very fine chiselled decoration for firearms. They chased the furniture of swords as well as firearms, and in fact, like most artist-craftsmen of the time, were prepared to use their skill on any object which offered scope for it. The chiselled mounts, gun-locks and barrels of the Sadelers are distinguished by great precision and sharpness in the cutting, and the skilful use of gilding to enhance the design. Associated with the Sadelers was the stock-maker Hieronymus Borstorffer who frequently signed his work. It is, however, comparatively rare to find the initials of the decorator of a stock upon a piece, as well as those of the barrel-smith and the lock-smith. There is in the Wallace Collection a casket inlaid with stag's horn, mother-of-pearl and brass which is signed in full by one Jean Conrad Tornier of Massevaux, a town in Alsace. The inscription is in French but the style of ornament is mainly German, together indicative of the borderland between two cultures. This box is a most valuable touchstone for detecting this artist's hand elsewhere. Mr. A. N. Kennard has recently published an article in which he was able to point to several gun stocks decorated by Tornier made recognisable by comparison with the box. In the course of the seventeenth century Brescia came to the fore as a centre for the manufacture and sale of firearms. One recalls the account in John Evelyn's diary, of how he went to the shop of old Lazarino Cominazzo and bought a fine gun from him. The Cominazzi were the leading family of barrel makers in the Val Trompia, near Brescia. Their weapons are distinguished by their lightness, beautiful balance and refined decoration. This last generally takes the form of delicately pierced and chiselled overlays of steel upon the walnut stock. The Cominazzi do not appear ever to have made the locks, which are always signed with another name and are sometimes beautifully chiselled like the butt-caps. The Italian type of pistol in the seventeenth century is quite distinct from the French, as also are the German and the Spanish. Some of the Spanish locks are very elaborately chiselled, and the form of the " miquelet " lock shows strong Moorish influence. During the seventeenth century engraved prints were circulated with designs for the decoration of firearms. One series bears the names of Le Hollondois and Touraine who were working in the reign of Louis XIV, and there are in existence several guns made and signed by them. The small area offered by a gun or pistol for decoration does not prevent them from telling as clearly as the cabinet-maker's or goldsmith's crafts the story of successive changes of taste. They demonstrate the change from the Renaissance to the Baroque, from the Baroque to the Rococo and from the Rococo to the Empiry styles. It would</page><page sequence="32">Oct. 31, 1941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 77 1 take too long to trace this development in detail. The stocks of a pair of pistols made for King Louis XIV in the Wallace Collection are elaborately carved with the Labours of Hercules and the barrels inlaid with gold fleurs-de-lys and allusions to his conquest of the Netherlands (Fig. 23). The lighter style of the reign of his successor is dis- played in the engraved designs of LaCollombe, published in 1730 (Fig. 24), with their rocaille decoration and asymetrical scrolls. The stocks were often inlaid with silver wire, and this practice is well exemplified by a garniture - that is to say a set of weapons, a gun, rifle, and two pistols - by J. C. Stockmar of Dresden in the Wallace Collection. If one accepts Stockmar as typical of the Rococo style in art as applied to firearms, one can find no one better than Boutet of Versailles to exemplify the heavy, neo-classical style of the First Empire. Boutet made not only firearms at the Manufactory at Versailles, but also swords. The presentation pieces which he made are most elaborately inlaid with gold, and some of the swords with their eagles and sphinxes hark back to Roman forms in the most unequivocal manner (Fig. 25). Later Swords I have mentioned swords once or twice in speaking of firearms because the decorators of firearms also employed their talents on the decoration of swords. The swept hilt of the rapier of the sixteenth century exemplifies equally faithfully successive changes of taste, The pierced cup-hilt found on Spanish rapiers of the Fig. 23. - Above , one of a pair of pistols presented to Louis XIV by the City of Lille. Below , one of a pair of French pistols with silver inlay , eighteenth century , made for the Eastern Market. Wallace Collection</page><page sequence="33">772 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 3I, 194I seventeenth century is in its way the counterpart of the pierced ornament upon Brescian pistols. In the middle of the seventeenth century the rapier gave place to the small-sword. As this was not solely a military weapon, but was universally worn writh civil dress, great luxury of decoration was lavished upon it. The hilts of these weapons, small and slender, epitomise as well as any snuff-box the spirit of the Rococo. Like the snuff-box they were often made of precious Fig. 24. - Designs for a flint-lock gun by La Collombe , 1730, after Lenk metals, chased and enamelled, and two-colour gold was used to emphasize the design. Sometimes the grips were made of Dresden porcelain. All the tricks of Rococo fantasy, asymmetrical forms, C-shaped scrolls, trellis-work and so forth, are found in their small compass. One* sees, too, interesting influences at work from outside, such as the chinoiserie hilts of some French small-swords of the eighteenth century which were made in Pekin. The cut-steel hilt came into vogue at the end of the eighteenth century and has lasted in a decadent form down to our own times as an essential part of court dress.</page><page sequence="34">Oct. 31, 194I JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 773 Cannon At the beginning of this lecture I alluded to the connection between the bronze founders of the Renaissance and the making of bronze cannon. There were certain families, such as the Alberghetti of Venice, who gained great distinction as gun-founders, and many of their cannon are quite as much works of art as the groups of statuary, candelabra, well-heads and other bronze castings, as for instance the bases of the famous masts in front of San Marco at Venice. It is an interesting commentary on the extent to which aesthetic appeal was regarded as essential to instruments of war, that although kings and princes were often at their wits' end to raise money for their campaigns, the armaments which they commissioned never seem to have lacked artistic embellishment of a high order. Occasionally one reads of protests against the extravagant use of carving and gold-leaf, as for instance in Pepys's correspondence with the Admiralty, but though restraint may sometimes have been imposed, its effects are seldom visible to the modern eye. This is especially the case with cannon, Fig. 25. - Sword by Boutet of Versailles in the style of the First Empire , in the Musée de Г Armée, Paris</page><page sequence="35">774 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, I94I which, more than most things, one might think, could be allowed to remain plain tubes of iron or bronze. But cascabel, chase, reinforce and dolphins were each made to play a decorative part, even if it was only in the form of well-designed mouldings. The cannon of Henry VIII were boldly cast with Fig. 25. - Bronze cannon of the sixteenth century. That on the left signed by Giovanni da Santa Juliana. 1578. Wallace Collection the Royal badges. The guns of François I in the Musée de l'Armée, beautifully diapered with fleurs-de-lys in low relief along their whole length are hard to surpass. One of the two small bronze cannons in the Wallace Collection shows characteristic decoration of the French Renaissance with the attenuated figures which one connects with the School of Fontainebleau (Fig. 26). The other small one is signed by an Italian gun-founder Giovanni da Santa Juliana and dated 1578. A larger cannon in the same museum dates from a century later and was</page><page sequence="36">Oct. 31, 194.Í jOÜfcNÄL OF THÉ ËÔYAL ŠOCIÉTY ÖF ARTS 775 cast by Giovanni Mazzaroli of Veniçe in 1688. It is most elaborately cast in high relief with scenes of the Labours of Hercules and the Battle of the Giants, and is as characteristic of baroque art as the sculpture of Borromini. There is another Italian bronze cannon of this time in the Tower of London, a late example of the work of the Alberghetti, and dated 1684. ^ can be compared with a French gun of the same period, which bears on the reinforce the Orders of St. Michel and Saint Esprit and the arms of the Marquis de Seignelay, better known as Colbert, the famous Minister of Finance of Louis XIV. Its decoration is in the Louis XIV style and is quite distinct from the more florid Baroque of the Italian cannon. Later Military Architecture Siege artillery was quicker in making its presence felt than field artillery, and was effective in breaching the walls of the medieval castle. The effect of artillery in the fifteenth century was to reduce the height of the walls and at the same time to thicken them. This was necessary, not only to resist the battering which they now received, but also to provide a platform for the artillery of the defenders. The fortress of Sarzanella, near Spezzia, which was built for Lorenzo de' Medici, is a good example of military architecture of the third quarter of the fifteenth century. It is rectangular ; two corners are defended by round bastions and the other two are sharply angular. Military engineering was now, thanks to firearms, becoming closely coñnected with the science of mathematics. Architects like San Gallo and Giorgio di San Martino lent their minds to the newT problems, but the greatest name in military architecture of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries is that of Sanmichele. Michele Sanmichele and his brother are best known for the graceful palaces which they built in Venice and on the mainland, but Michele was also employed by the Republic as a military engineer to. fortify her possessions in the Levant against the Turkish menace. The walls which rise behind the moat are low, and have a battered or sloping fore-foot marked off by a cable or string at the point where the brickwork rises vertically to the low ramparts ; these were solidly packed with earth, and defended at carefully placed intervals by angular bastions, so sided as to obtain the maximum field of fire. But Sanmichele was an artist as well as an engineer, and his gateways show great variety of treatment, relieving the stern lines of ditch and rampart. His method of fortification quickly spread throughout Europe. The castles which Henry VIII built to defend the South Coast from the repercussions of his military adventures on the Continent also show low walls and round towers, but not yet the angular bastions of the new science. The castles of Sandgate, Deal, Walmer and Camber, near Winchelsea, and the outer walls of the Tower of London date from this time. On the other side of the Channel new fortresses sprang up - at Ostend, Dunkirk, Calais, and all those little harbour towns which we now call " the invasion ports." The elaborate</page><page sequence="37">77^ JOURNAL- Of THÈ ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, 194Í fortifications of Ostend have been demolished and I believe of Dunkirk too, although they remain at Bergues and Montreuil-sur-Mer, which was the head- quarters of Lord Haig in the last war. They survive, too, at Calais, and it was behind the walls of the citadel of Calais built in 1560 that Brigadier Nicholson held out to the last before the German assault last June. Thousands who have hurried through the customs to the boat train must have been unaware that Calais Gate, which gave its name to the painting by Hogarth of which it forms the background, was still standing. Many remember with gratitude the protec- tion given to them by the seventeenth century walls and moat of Ypres. The great military architect of Louis XIV was Sebastian le Prêtre Vauban. His book was not published until a good many years after his death, but an original manuscript (possibly one of several copies prepared by him) came to light recently in London at the first Red Cross Sale. Vauban was accused of being extravagant in the architectural embellishments which he gave to the gates of his fortifications, though he was only following a very respectable tradition. The Porte de Paris which he built at Lille is a good instance of the heavy and grandiose style of the reign of the Grand Monarque. The eighteenth century was the last time that the fine arts took their place as by right in the field of military architecture. The forts and barracks of the nineteenth century are for the most part painfully undecorative, but there are exceptions, like the cyclopean Arsenal buildings, half médiéval, half Byzantine, erected in the middle of the last century at Vienna. Eastern Arms and Armour In my opening words I mentioned how the influence of art on instruments of war can be studied comparatively as well as historically - that is to say, instead of tracing the evolution by time, we can compare the forms they assumed under local influences of race and religion in different parts of the world. The theme is so large that I can do no more than present a few examples, which may be allowed to speak for themselves. An excellent instance can be found near at hand in the case of Highland arms, especially the pistols, dirks and powder horns which retained their own special characteristics and Celtic ornamentation until modern times. If one takes the remotest countries first, and those cut off longest from intercourse with Europe, one finds in the armour and weapons of Japan something as essentially Japanese as any of the artistic products of that ingenious country. The detachable circular guards of the Japanese sword, known as tsubas, wTere a field of fertile invention. Each was a work of art in itself, and a man of taste would have several dozen of them which he changed upon his sword from day to day. Nothing could be more different from European arms and armour than the defensive equipment of the Samurai , with its clattering rectangles of tortoiseshell and lacquer, and almost complete absence of polished steel (Fig. 27). The square defences of the shoulders and thighs, the terrifying masks decorated with</page><page sequence="38">Oct. 31, 1941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 77* Fig. 27. - Armour of a Japanese warrior .

I do not think anyone, however ignorant he was of arms and armour, could fail to recognize as such a Japanese suit of armour or a Japanese sword. If one moves westwards one finds that the arms of the Malays offer special characteristics, particularly in the type of sword or dagger known as the kris, with its very curious T-shaped sheath and hilt ; the arms of Ceylon, too, are quite different from those of the Indian continent, and are distinguished by their fierce Fig. 31. - Scimiiar with enamelled hilt, Indo-Persian. Wallace Collection Fig. 30. - Turban-helmet, inlaid zvith silver. Victoria and Albert Museum. lions and lively ornament (Fig. 28). The arms of the continent of India come under the influence of Persia, through the invasions of the late sixteenth century and the establishment of the Mogul dynasty (Figs. 30, 31). The complete Indian equipment of the time of Shah Jehan consisted of a round helmet with mail tippet, a garment of red velvet, studded with metal ; a shirt of mail ; vambraces reaching to the elbow and ending in mittens ; and cuirasse made in four pieces known as a char-aïna, that is to say "four mirrors,' fropi the four component plates, one for the breast, one for the back, and two smaller pieces for the sides, under the arms. The scimitars of India and Persia often carry very fine gold damascening or enamelled decoration, so too do the gauntlet swords and that</page><page sequence="41">7^0 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, 1941 peculiar type of weapon known as the khatar , of which the triangular blade was held projecting from the fist. The fancifu), but quite practical, idea of casting a mortar in the form of a tiger is illustrated by a specimen in the Tower of London which was captured in 1838 at the taking of Kunrnaul (Fig. 32). If one passes from India and Persia to the Balkans one finds another distinctive field, and this is also true of the Mameluke and Arab arms of North Africa. Here one is getting nearer Europe* and the interchange of forms with the West, which is especially noticeable in the contact with the Moorish invaders of Spain (Fig. 33). In particular there is a type: of dagger made by Saracenic workmen, Fig. 32. - Bronze mortar , originally silvered, in the form of a tiger , taken in 1838 at the capture of Kunrnaul.

This form can be traced from the fourth century A.D. in Persia, passing through the Balkans where it has left its mark on the yataghan (Fig. 29) to the ear -dagger of Moorish Spain An excellent example is shown in the portrait, once attributed to Holbein, of King Edward VI at Windsor. W e have adopted in the West in modern times several Oriental forms. Central Europe provided another point of contact with the East during the Turkish wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For instance, the English trooper's ".lobäter-tail n helmet of the time of the Civil War, although eVölved in the Fig. 33. - Sword of Boabdil , the last Moorish king in Spain , late fifteenth century , in the possession of the Marqués de Villaseca</page><page sequence="43">782 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, 1941 first place from the burgonet, shows by its sliding nasal and laminated neck- guard a strong affinity to Polish and Hungarian hèlmets of this time (Fig. 34), which in their turn had borrowed their characteristics from the helmet of Western Asia. Polish Lancers with their shapkas and sabres, and Hussars with their fur shakos and dolmens found a permanent place in the regular armies of Western Europe in the eighteenth century. The curved, single-edged sword had never been very common in the middle ages, though it was represented by the cleaver - like falchion ; but the Persian scimitar became familiar to European warriors in the hands of the Turks, and in the modified form of the sabre it became perma- nently established in the hands of European cavalry. One thinks too of the round-headed maces of the Voivodes of Transylvania and in particular that of Stephen Bathòry in the gallery of near-Eastern arms at Vienna. To this day the full dress of an English General includes a scimitar of purely Eastern form with pistol-shaped ivory hilt. Modern Times During the last half-century the sword has lost its proud position as the queen of weapons, although it is still used in full dress, and highly decorated swords are still made for presentation. These are for the most part in deplorable taste. The decoration is fussy and mechanical, and is no longer a natural part of the weapon itself, as it was in earlier epochs. They smack too much of the kind of Fig. 34. - Helmet of semi-Oriental form. Polish or Hungarian , sixteenth century. Wallace Collection</page><page sequence="44">Oct. 31, 1941 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 783 enamelled decoration one finds on sewing machines or the gilded bicycle of the Indian Maharajah of the 'nineties. Before a weapon can be pleasing to the eye its outline and proportions must remain essentially useful. I prefer to say " useful," rather than employ the modern hackneyed term " functional." It is often a revealing test of an artist's claims to see. what he makes of a sword when he has to portray one, as often occurs in the designing of a war memorial. The true artist will at once grasp instinctively the proper proportions and purpose of the weapon. But, alas, how often does one see, carved in stone or cast in bronze, swords with puny little pommels that could never balance the blade, and unnecessarily heavy quillons, often curving in the wrong direction. They are as deformed as a club foot or a withered arm upon the human body. Modern Armour The history of arms and armour is the history of the rival forces of attack and defence. At one time one achieved the predominance and at another time the other. Since prehistoric times the human brain has been pitted against itself in this age-long struggle, and it is this that makes me claim the study of arms as a subject more alive and more fascinating than any other of the applied arts - for here is a matter of life and death and the final arbiter of history. Defensive armour was abandoned in the seventeenth century because it impeded mobility and was vulnerable by firearms. We have seen it return in our own day, first in the form of the steel helmet introduced on the Western Front by all the belligerents in 191 6, and then in the shape of the tank. Curiously enough the three principal belligerents each derived the form of their steel helmet from a different medieval prototype. The Germans based theirs upon the sallet of the fifteenth century, the French on the morion, while the English reproduced the broad brimmed war hat of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, though possibly in this latter case it was evolved quite independently of its prototype. In most of these revivals one sees the military mind once again groping in the early stages of development. The designers of snipers' armour for trench warfare in 1916-18 did not pick up the thread where their predecessors of the sixteenth century had left off, as is only too clearly shown by the clumsy and amateurish forms devised. In the regimental flashes and corps signs sewn on khaki or stencilled on vehicles we see again the shy beginnings of a new heraldry. The tank is the reincarnation of the medieval armoured horsemen. Its employment as a highly mobile force which can be used to break down opposition involves virtually the same tactics. It is only in its complete and absolute divorce from the fine arts that it emphasises the difference from its predecessor. In the foregoing pages I have often selected exaggerated instances of art applied to arms in order the better to demonstrate their subordination to contemporary taste. In some cases their forms militate against the generally</page><page sequence="45">784 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 31, 1941 accepted canon, that utility is paramount and that when decoration hinders performance it is abhorrent. But the corollary, so often put forward in recent years, should not be accepted without reserve. An instrument that is useful is not ipso facto beautiful. There are plenty of barracks and workhouses that are the one without being the other. May those whose task it is to rebuild the ravages of war remember this.</page></plain_text>
