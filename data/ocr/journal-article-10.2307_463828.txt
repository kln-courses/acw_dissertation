<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gender, Values, and Lessing s Cats Judith Kegan Gardiner University of Illinois at Chicago Two disparate conversations in which I recently took part spurred me to think about values and gender. In the first talk, a male colleague who teaches a course on Charlotte Bronte stopped by my office to ask me why there is no feminist literary theory. In preparing for his course, he had read much feminist criticism, including Gilbert and Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic and Abel's Writing and Sexual Difference.1 He assured me that although this reading was very interesting, it was sociology, not literary theory. The second conversation dealt with the weightier topic of nuclear disarmament, and in it my interlocutor insisted that my arguments against our current weapons systems were idealistic and misguided because the Russians can only under? stand a "two-by-four across the forehead." He thought that women and other liberals were too soft to recognize such political realities. Both of these examples raised for me, from very different directions, questions about values in relation to both gender and literature. Feminist literary criticism asks two main questions: how is gender inscribed in culture, and what characterizes writing by women. These questions overlap but are asymmetrical, and they often draw their answers from differing theoretical realms. Recently Margaret Homans has taken up the notion put forth by Rachel Blau DuPlessis that women's "(ambiguously) non- hegemonic" status answers both these questions; it explains women's rela? tion to culture and defines the characteristics of women's writings.2 In this essay I explore some of this theory's results for literature. In particular, I modify the concept of "hegemony" from one unified state of patriarchy and suggest instead that many intellectual structures have been regnant at different periods of history and that differing ideologies compete for alle? giance within the same culture. So far all such ideologies have been male dominant, but not in the same ways. I argue that different values belong to different ideologies; that, in fact, ideologies are systems or models that simultaneously claim to describe reality and to represent reality in eval? uative terms. Each "hegemonic" ideology encodes its own set of values, and each devalues women, though in differing ways. After considering some dominant ideological models pertinent to modern fiction, I explore one 111</page><page sequence="2">influential new "non-hegemonic" model that claims to value women's expe? rience more justly?the "mothering" theory developed by psychoanalytic feminists. This theory revises the gender-coded evaluations of dominant systems in order to explain women's psychology and writings. I will look at some uses and limitations of this theory for literature, taking my sample texts from the work of Doris Lessing, a prolific and important writer who broadcasts her ideological shifts and who illustrates the problems that arise from separating empathy and history. Let me return briefly to those two conversations I spoke of, from which I deduced that I perceived things differently from my male colleagues. In the first case, I think that what sounded to me like literary theory did not to him because for him the notion of theory is invested with values antithetical to those of feminist criticism. In conformity with the elite Western tradition in which he is trained, my colleague values the individual instance and the universal abstraction, but he is uncomfortable with anything in between. Thus he likes literary theories that uphold transcendent truths?like the deceptiveness of appearances?and that are capable of virtuoso performance by the individual theorist. In contrast, everything that pertains to women applies only to a social sub-group and is therefore "sociology": there is the human spirit, and then there are "special interest groups," like women. Having said this, however, I recognize one valid reason for my colleague's inability to grasp feminist literary theory as theory. Over the last fifteen years, the women's liberation movement and feminist scholarship have dramatically altered our ideas about men and women. They have not so altered our ideas about literature. Hence the man whose experiences and whose understanding of gender have not changed may not believe that literature changes because our understanding of gender changes, and thus he may not see that feminists have developed an enormously exciting new perspective on literature. About my second conversation, a frustrating exchange concerning the nuclear freeze movement, I need not go into detail. What is pertinent in it for this train of thought was my realization that he and I meant very different things by words like "freedom" and "security." It was not that I was embedded too exclusively in female networks or concrete specifics to use abstractions, but that these abstractions were labels attached to differing ideological models for the two of us. The first stage in my quest to disentangle ideologies and their meaning for women is the insight that virtually all the big, value-laden abstractions by which we evaluate specific events in our lives have different meanings for men and for women. Let us start with the Beautiful, the True, and the Good. The beautiful shows its gender-coded difference most obviously: it must mean something different to the person who has all her life been taught to 112</page><page sequence="3">consider whether or not she is a beautiful object than it does to someone who has always occupied the position of an observer or even possessor of another's beauty.3 Sexual desirability to men defines women's beauty, and sexual fidelity to men defines women's truth. When not assured of possessing women's truth, men have believed women deceitful, changeable, and unre? liable.4 Similarly, women's goodness fits a narrow box. A good man can possess many Virtues, but a good woman must be sexually faithful and altruistically giving, an idealized wife and mother. Thus for women sexual fidelity and maternal nurture collapse the categories of truth, honor, and goodness into one another. What about other abstractions? I thought of love, freedom, and justice. Surely love means something different to men and to women. Supposedly it is the center of a woman's life, her joy, her vocation, and her duty; for men, it is either a fringe benefit to or a noble distraction from a full and accom? plished life.5 Freedom and justice. Do women think that "freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose"? In her recent book, Intimate Strangers, sociologist Lillian Rubin reports that when asked their associations with the word "independence," men spoke enthusiastically about work and adven? ture. In contrast, women replied ambivalently, often with the word "di? vorce."6 Concerning justice, perhaps the most influential statement of a difference between male and female values is Freud's comment in "Some Psychical Consequences of the Anatomical Distinction between the Sexes" (1925): I cannot evade the notion.. . that for women the level of what is ethically normal is different from what it is in men. . . . Character traits which critics of every epoch have brought up against women?that they show less sense of justice than men. . . would be amply accounted for by the modification in the formation of their superego which we have inferred above. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected from such conclusions by the denials of the feminists, who are anxious to force us to regard the two sexes as completely equal in position and worth.7 Feminist theorists Juliet Mitchell and Carol Gilligan accept Freud's descrip? tion of female morality as different from men's, while denying that it is necessarily inferior.8 Women's position has always been dual, both outside of dominant values and inside the society that lives by them. Often enough women have been complicit with dominant values, and women's culture exists as a "muted" subculture at the margins of the dominant culture.9 The analysis of woman's position as "(ambiguously) non-hegemonic" is more subtle than that of woman as simply Other or Outsider.10 However, like the analysis of woman as Other, it, too, generalizes woman's position to a single stance. In this structuralist view, the position of woman is like that of some other colonized groups, for example, like that of upper-class Africans within French culture. 113</page><page sequence="4">However, we do not need to take an essentialist view of women's nature to insist that what is distinctive about women is not merely women's ambigu? ously insider/outsider position in culture, but the fact that women are women, a unique biological group assigned nearly universal social tasks. To say that women are women is always true but not always useful, and I will attempt, therefore, to carry our quest for a model of women's situation one step further by suggesting that women's "(ambiguously) non-hegemonic" position shifts as ideological hegemonies shift. Moral abstractions mean different things for men and for women in part because they are embedded in larger ideological systems that are asym? metrically constructed according to gender. Let us look at these ideological systems more closely. I argue that women are faced with various hegemonic ideologies, all of which are male dominant. However, each of these systems positions women differently. This multiplicity of systems confuses our dis? course about values, including the discourse of literary criticism. Thus I think the view that women have a distinctive moral voice parallel to men's is too simple.11 What are these "hegemonic" ideologies? In Western culture for the past millenium, the hegemonic moral system has been Christianity, and it still is. For the past few hundred years, the hegemonic political ideology has been that of bourgeois liberalism, with its high evaluation of individual effort and universal truth, the values that I encountered in the talk with my first colleague mentioned earlier. Some of the values implied by these two systems contradict one another?for example, Christian self-sacrifice and bourgeois self-aggrandizement. Such contradictions may lead to cultural rebalancings of gender roles. The Victorian doctrine of separate spheres, for instance, let men compete in the public market while women selflessly tended those at home. Though both are sexist, the two systems are not entirely synchronized: the Christian dualism of soul and flesh dichotomizes women as good and evil, whereas bourgeois liberal rationality tends to exclude women rather than exalt or vilify them. Within each system, moreover, recessive egalitarian values like the spiritual equality of all souls or the democratic rhetoric of full citizenship sometimes subvert dominant sexist values. But the hegemonic form of both systems is clearly sexist, so that feminist rebellion in the nineteenth century often took the form of contesting these dominant social values: Emily Dickinson defies the pa? triarchal God; Charlotte Bronte bursts into anger and Emily Bronte into passion in ways their contemporaries thought unchristian and unladylike. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, new ideologies, such as Marxism and Freudian psychoanalysis, arose to challenge both bourgeois liberalism and Christianity. Marxism disputes bourgeois liberalism's eco? nomic analyses and political values. It insists that competing class interests, 114</page><page sequence="5">based on people's relations to the means of production, mediate between the individual and the society as a whole. Classical Marxism recognizes women as exploited and oppressed in the workforce, in the division of labor within the family, and in the operation of the sexual double standard, and it therefore attracts some feminists, even though its analysis marginalizes women as a subset of the working class and its practice often relapses into sexism. Freudian psychoanalysis, like Marxism, contests the otherworldly im? primatur of Christianity, but it operates less in direct competition to it and more by dividing off a new ideological bailiwick, separating psychology from morality and claiming to describe the operations of the mind, the formation of personality, and the importance of sexuality to both of the above. Its revaluation of sexuality and aggression provides women with images of liberation even though it is radically demeaning in assessing women as inferior to men by virtue of nature, training, and character. At present, all these systems may be hegemonic. Politically, we value freedom?which we may understand in bourgeois liberal or in Marxist terms. Morally, even for atheists, Christian concepts of goodness prevail. In the psychological sphere, our vocabulary and assumptions are primarily Freudian; we accept as realities the concepts of the unconscious and repres? sion, and we value maturity and integration. For aesthetics, there is no agreed-upon standard of the beautiful, no hegemonic ideology by which to evaluate works of art or literature. This conceptual vacuum validates the established canon and leads to profound conservative distress when femi? nists challenge the canon because the values of an aesthetic canon are self- referential and self-reinforcing, a touchstone system. We know a poem is good because it resembles one by Donne or Keats, which we have already decided is good. Challenges to the canon provoke anxiety since there is no standard for its revision: any question may topple the whole edifice. Because there is no accepted aesthetic, other ideologies may impose their standards on literature: for example, Christina Froula demonstrates how patriarchal Christian readings overlay literary ones throughout the history of the Western literary canon.12 How do these disparate hegemonic value systems function together? We are all capable of holding multiple and contradictory ideas at the same time. Many systems in which we believe confuse us by claiming that they are not judgmental. Moral systems openly divide the good from the evil, but Freudian, Marxist, and other ideologies often claim to be amorally objec? tive. Despite these disclaimers, they encode certain values, like respect for psychological maturity or hatred for capitalist exploitation. Moreover, we are accustomed to switches between these systems, as in the song, "Gee, Officer Krupke!" from West Side Story where the same idle youth is decried as 115</page><page sequence="6">disturbed, deprived, or depraved: "this boy needs"?a job, a doctor, a social worker, or "a year in the pen." The argument that a killer is not evil but sick depends on our familiarity with such ideological switches. Furthermore, the various ideologies may gauge the same attribute very differently. For in? stance, a Christian might repent anger as a deadly sin, while a Freudian rejoices at expressing repressed hostility and a Marxist incites anger as a step towards political action. Feminists, too, often value anger: Virginia Woolf snubbed Charlotte Bronte's raw fury while striking her own flint against the patriarchy, and Gilbert and Gubar claim that nineteenth-century women writers wore repressed rage as close as their corsets.13 To summarize this argument so far, then, we understand different aspects of experience through different ideological models. These models are con? tradictory in some of their values. They have variously contradictory ap? plications to women, and our value-laden abstractions mean different things to men and to women. Each of these competing ideologies has its own history, yet the same people may believe them at the same time, despite their intertwining contradictions. Literature creates its own world, we have been told, but never from the whole cloth. The writer makes a world to alter or reproduce the one we inhabit as we understand it through our ideological constructions. When Sir Philip Sidney defended fiction as more just than reality, he upheld ideology over observation. One cannot imagine everything from scratch; one must talk about humans based on some preconceptions about what humans are like, how they think and feel, what social structures they design, and so on. Even the most brilliant and original novelist must rely on assumptions from one set of paradigms while revising or moving on to others. Precisely because novelists can make their own worlds to fit their own values, the novel provides a privileged arena for moral analysis. Women writers, in particular, wield fiction to analyze what society means for women. In so doing, their way is both helped and hindered by the contradictory ideological models available to them. Feminist literary criticism explicates the values of these ideologies and is often caught between them. Carol Gilligan describes female morality as narrative and contextual, and novels obviously provide an admirable ground on which to construct sys? tems that are narrative and contextual. Gilbert and Gubar describe women's literature as palimpsestic, hiding coded women's meanings beneath super? ficial patriarchal conventions. But such layers, I suggest, do not lie neatly awaiting our excavation. Instead of lying flat on its foundations, a work may be built on restlessly bubbling ideologies, from which the critic extracts her own favorite brew. That is, many feminist critical controversies debate whether a woman writer breaks traditional paradigms in ways that the critic approves. Thus some readers dislike Kate Chopin's The Awakening because 116</page><page sequence="7">its hero weakly commits suicide rather than face social ostracism; whereas other critics praise the novel for demonstrating that a patriarchal society offers no place for the awakened woman. Doris Lessing, who has taken all of modern Western culture and its future as her province, illustrates the ways that women's ideologies and values collide in fiction. Her work is ambitious and eminent, and she explicitly defends her shifting ideological investments. Her characters frequently appear clipping newspapers, trying to piece together what the twentieth century means. Many readers value The Golden Notebook for representing this common bewilderment as individuals try to understand modern so? cieties through various ideologies. Thus the red notebook records Anna's effort to see the world through the red-tinted glasses of Marxism, while the blue notebook focuses on her psychological perceptions, although none of these efforts is consistent or self-enclosed. As readers we empathize with the fragmentation that results from trying to fit these disparate ideologies together to portray a woman's experience of the twentieth century. As feminist readers we may applaud the novel when it transforms traditional paradigms that oppress women and condemn it when it fails our "liberated" values. For example, many women cheered when Anna menstruated in print, meditated about her sanitary precautions, and speculated about her moods. Since menstruating is a nearly universal and emotional female experience, its exclusion from literature demonstrates misogynist ic cultural attitudes. Those readers who praise The Golden Notebook for breaking this literary taboo, however, may condemn Anna's raptures about vaginal orgasms as a test of true love. In this case Lessing makes her character's sexual experience accord with a Freudian paradigm so powerful that it may create a non-existent physiological distinction.14 To cite a later Lessing text, The Memoirs of a Survivor describes a disin? tegrating society from which its narrator escapes by way of "memories" of a repressed girl's past and fantasies of an impersonal future. Each of these three realms?present, past, and future?obeys different laws, laws based on differ? ing paradigms. Anarchy, class division, and bad technology destroy the current public society; the Freudian personal past circles endlessly from repressive mother to denigrated daughter; liberation lies ahead in another dimension, through Sufi transcendence of individuality. The values of these realms also contradict one another. The present public world suffers from irresponsibility and inconsequence, an anarchy so total that it destroys people's consciences and allows abandoned children to survive through heedless cannibalism. On the other hand, the narrator abhors the past's stuffy, intense familial socialization that created consciences. And, yet more confusingly, though the present suffers from irresponsibility, it is not at all clear that personal responsibility can do anything to save it for the future.15 117</page><page sequence="8">I am not trying to blame Lessing for a universal failure?the failure to invent a psychology and a politics that are both consistent and adequate to account for the experience of women. However, the novel does record a healing and mirroring relationship between the middle-aged female nar? rator and an abandoned girl who blur into one another, gradually evolving into one complete female soul and transcending the rifts between past, present, and future. This female bonding is central to the novel, although neither post-Marxist politics nor Freudian psychology explains it. The theory that best illuminates this relationship is known as "mothering the? ory," a feminist reformulation of object relations psychoanalysis principally developed by Nancy Chodorow, Dorothy Dinnerstein, and Adrienne Rich.16 This aspect of Lessing's work drew my attention because I already knew the new paradigm. It is not yet hegemonic, though it is very influential, and it purports to be a model of human psychology that is truer to women's experience than its orthodox Freudian predecessor,. Chodorow's theory specifies that women's personalities develop in identification and symbiosis with their mothers through early bonds that are so strong and fluid, and whose pleasures are so compelling, that women for the rest of their lives will yearn for maternal nurturance and learn to give it to children, men, and other women. Empathic and comfortably intimate with others, women are so profoundly interdependent with one another, especially their mothers and their daughters, that their identities may seem to merge into one another. In stressing positive aspects of empathy and interdependence, this theory revalues the Freudian paradigm as well as correcting its picture of female psychological development. Moreover, it has important ramifica? tions for literary criticism. It claims that the intense infantile bonds that daughters develop with their mothers will shape their fantasies, needs, and dispositions, and hence the ways that women write and read.17 Although this theory is very influential, it has also drawn significant criticism. Some feminists fear that it accepts too much of its Freudian fathering, overemphasizing fantasy and infantile experience while slighting real events and adult development; others deplore its heterosexist bias.18 As an analytic tool for the literary critic, however, I think the chief defect of mother-daughter theory is that it separates empathy from history according to conventional stereotypes: women become their mothers; whereas men go off to conquer the world. By this division, women are comic; men are tragic.19 Women peddle along their natural cycles; men climb to peaks of individual autonomy, or dynamite the mountains. Dinnerstein blames mother-dominated child-rearing for male technological attitudes that irre? parably exploit nature and other people. According to this theory, empathy belongs to women, history to men. 118</page><page sequence="9">Now let us return to Lessing, tracking empathy and history in her texts while testing the uses and limitations of mothering theory to her work. I start with the short story "Our Friend Judith," a frequent anthology favorite. Published in 1960 before the re-emergence of feminism, the story questions dominant assumptions about gender roles. Its narrator introduces us to "our friend Judith," a middle-aged unmarried woman who lives alone, writes poetry, and adores cats. On a continental trip to research the Borgias, she succumbs to an Italian barber in a short affair that crosses class, national, and religious lines. If this information leads us to believe that Judith is a pitiable old maid, however, the story confutes this deduction. In fact, it opens by satirizing just this misrecognition: "I stopped inviting Judith to meet people when a Canadian woman remarked, with the satisfied fervour of one who has at last pinned a label on a rare specimen: "'she is, of course, one of your typical English spinsters.'"20 The narrator soon reminds us "that one's pitying admiration for women who have supported manless and un- comforted lives needs a certain modification" (189). But Judith is not "manless"; she has adoring lovers whom she will not marry. Thus she resembles ancient models of the virgin goddess as integrated female power, not as sexless being. In a borrowed green dress, for instance, she "could. . . evoke nothing but classical images. Diana, perhaps, back from the hunt" (190).21 Judith's awesome integrity separates her from both men and women, and most of the story consists of vignettes designed to reveal her character to us. Several of these incidents involve cats. In one, Judith kills her boisterous tomcat rather than allowing it to be castrated. She cries about it but does not consider compromising. Later she explains the sudden rupture of her affair with the Italian barber as due to another incident with a cat. The essence of the situation, she says, was that she "had the wrong attitude to that cat. Cats are supposed to be independent" (205). The cat in question was too young to have kittens, but pregnant nonetheless. Judith assists at its painful delivery: There were two paws sticking out of the cat's back end. The kitten was the wrong way round. It was stuck. I held the cat down with one hand and I pulled the kitten out with the other... .It was a nice fat black kitten. It must have hurt her. But she suddenly bit out... .It died. . . .She was its mother, but she killed it (206). The Italian lover kills the lone surviving kitten before its mother does, and Judith leaves him, feeling a "complete gulf in understanding" between them (204). At first the story seems a simple rebuttal of sexist condescension to unmarried women. However, if we look at it through the perspective of mothering theory, we see it in a different light. For one thing, this theory about the permeability of female ego boundaries helps us to understand the blurry frame of the story in which the narrator has no character of her own 119</page><page sequence="10">but sometimes identifies with Judith and sometimes blends into Betty, a shadowy third character, a typical wife and mother, who exists solely to talk about Judith to the narrator. Implausibly, both Betty and the narrator follow Judith to Italy to find out what she did there. The story does not devalue Judith for being unmarried; rather, it shows her as an admirable new woman. However, its attitudes to motherhood are ambivalent. When asked about having children, Judith replies it is too bad "one couldn't have everything," but she sounds completely satisfied with her life as it stands (205). However, the incident of the cat who killed her kitten exposes Judith's thwarted maternity as the essence of her character. Only in attending the birthing cat does she experience empathy and vulnerability, and only in this episode does she evoke our sympathy. But the incident closes when Judith rejects sub? merging herself in "somebody else" and returns to lonely integrity (205). The story separates this austere autonomy from both empathy and history. We, the motherly, understand people as do the narrator and her friend Betty. Judith does not: "I don't understand human behavior," she says, "and I'm not particularly interested" (203). Because she does not understand people, she cannot understand history either. She must give up researching the Borgias because she can't figure out "what made those people tick" (199). As she explains to the narrator, she thinks "one surely ought to stay in character" (190). That is, since she cannot understand others, she is doomed to remain a fictional character, not a motherly creator. My conviction about the importance of "mothering" theory to explicat? ing "Our Friend Judith" receives support from one of Lessing's lesser-known books, Particularly Cats, a volume for petlovers puffed by its publishers for avoiding "those anthropomorphic touches that make you want to throw a can of tuna at people," and apparently written as a potboiler in the years when Lessing was finishing her ambitious novel, The Four-Gated City.22 In Particularly Cats, Lessing tells the cat incidents of the Judith story as her own experiences. For example, her black and white cat kittened too young, and the birth was difficult: "At last the first kitten appeared, but it was the wrong way, . . .It came out, but the head got stuck. The cat bit and scratched and yelled. . . .That cat. . . killed the first-born kitten in each litter, because she had such pain with it" (27). Judith thought spaying a cat destroyed its identity. Lessing has a cat "fixed" and bemoans the results, curiously using the very sexist stereotypes that her story effectively debunks: after the operation, she says, her cat's "shape changed. . . she coarsened everywhere... .A strident note entered her character. . . .She was spiteful... .In short, she had turned into a spinster cat" (61). Talking of cats, it seems, Lessing allows herself to slip into careless conventions that she otherwise examines more scrupulously. This 120</page><page sequence="11">carelessness helps the critic, because it means that here Lessing leaves unprocessed chunks of ideology lying exposed in her prose. For example, the cat book clarifies one essential contradiction of Judith's story: maternity both defines a female's identity and separates one from one's true nature. Time and time again, Lessing judges her cats by how well they mother their kittens. Tet when her black cat "dozes off, eyes half-closed," Lessing com? ments that then she shows us "what she really is, her real self, when not tugged into fussy devotion by motherhood" (128).23 In fact, the whole cat book reveals Lessing's difficult and contradictory attitudes toward motherhood. The book begins with reminiscences of her African childhood. Her mother loved and tended the farm cats, but it was also her job to kill the excess kittens. One year she refuses this task, and hordes of crippled, hideous cats overrun the farm. Finally, her father rounds them up and shoots them in a sickening slaughter, a "holocaust of cats" for which Lessing angrily holds her mother responsible (19). If the mother refuses to play the goddess of nature, giving and taking life, it seems, then men are forced to extreme acts of violence. Lessing was completing her Children of Violence novels at this time, and the word "holocaust" must have been peculiarly charged for her. The mother's role in the cat book extends from Lessing's mother to Lessing as mother of the next generation. It is the only one of her books dedicated to the daughter she left behind in Africa when she moved to England with her young son. In this light, the book's many incidents in which Lessing faithfully feeds and nurses sick cats appear as covert proofs that she is really a good mother after all. The book thus becomes a plea for the possible coexistence of empathy and history: she can be a better mother than her mother was. Female life need not be merely reduplicative; genera? tional change, even progress, is possible. My last Lessing text drops cats but retains a lesson about empathy and history, although, alas, a far more pessimistic one than earlier. In the past few years Lessing has been writing?at a pace only slightly less rapid than some of us can read?angry and urgent speculative fictions which warn us that doom is near. The Making of the Representative for Planet Eight, the fourth novel in her Canopos in Argos series, concerns cosmic justice; it describes an ice age that destroys a whole planet. One hundred pages of ice bored me, but I thawed to read the volume's fascinating Afterword in which Lessing explains how she first became interested in the British expeditions to the Antarctic led by Robert Falcon Scott between 1901 and 1913, expeditions that exemplified heroism and personal transcendence, but also class dis? crimination, gender discrimination, imperialist arrogance, and a great deal of freezing to death. Lessing writes: 121</page><page sequence="12">I first heard of Scott and his band of heroes thus. It was in the middle of Africa... on my fathers farm. . . .There, most vividly in my memory, is my mother, standing head back, hands out, in a posture of dramatic identification. . . .My mother, choked with emo- tion, and radiant, for she enjoyed these moments, is saying, "and when I think of Captain Oates going off alone to die in the blizzards?oh, he was a most gallant gentleman!" and I then, with the raucous bray of the adolescent: "but what else could he have done? and anyway, they were all in the dying business." I regret the bray, but not the sentiment; in fact, it seems to me that I was as clear-sighted then as I have been since, and I envy the way that hard girl bulldozed her way through pieties and humbug, for there is no doubt life softens you up: tolerance makes nougat of us all.24 In this passage, Lessing scorns her mother for identifying with the men who go "off alone to die in the blizzards," although exactly this "dramatic identification" seems to be the source of her own fiction: we have just read a hundred pages about gallant beings who freeze to death. In her sixties, Lessing still rejects her mother and applauds her own adolescent harshness, as if she now denies the cat book's middle-aged optimism that generations can learn from one another. This despair continues in the Afterword as she digresses into an essay on history, denouncing all of us for not having listened to her clear-sighted and, we must agree, correct denunciations of southern Africa and other "crimi? nally oppressive tyrannies" (127). "But it seems that the repetitiveness of historical, of sociological processes is not even noticed," she laments, while history seems to her nothing else than this blind repetition (127). She continues: I could fill pages, volumes, with facts illustrating this theme, that the heresies of one year are the pieties of the next... .but for some reason we cannot apply the obvious lessons of history to ourselves. Why? Is it possible that we could learn not to impose on each other these sacred necessities, in the name of some dogma or other, with results that inevitably within a decade will be dismissed with: We made mistakes. It is only too easy to imagine The Spirit of History... a blowzy but complacent female, wearing the mask of the relevant ruler or satrap: "dearie me!" she smiles, "but I have made a mistake again!" and into the dustbin go holocausts, famines, wars, and the occupants of a million prisons and torture chambers" (127). This is an astonishing, even a shocking passage. Lessing personifies history as the goddess Fortuna, throwing people into the trash?that is, as an enormous bad mother, an exaggeration of her own mother in the cat book whose irresponsibility caused the "holocaust of cats." We know that in fact women have perpetrated rather few of the holocausts, wars, prisons, and torture chambers of history, yet this sexist stereotype blames the "blowzy but complacent female," just as Lessing blames her mother for the Scott expedi? tion's sentimental imperialism. Blaming mother, I think, causes Lessing's despair at human endeavor in these last works. History is like mother: if we don't understand her, we are doomed to repeat her, as Lessing both identifies with her mother and 122</page><page sequence="13">repudiates her about the Scott expedition. In "Our Friend Judith," Lessing included history within empathy and connected both to maternal care rather than to spinsterly autonomy. Particularly Cats covertly argues that both empathy and history are possible for women: women can understand their mothers and change to become better mothers than their own mothers were. In these last speculative fictions, Lessing despairs of both empathy and history, And this returns us to the importance of the paradigms through which we understand our world. If we do not incorporate gender into our model of history, we may relapse into the sexism that blames the "blowzy but complacent female." But if, on the other hand, we feminists do not incorpo? rate history into our model of gender, we are doomed to simple repetition? while, perhaps, as Lessing warns us, the world perishes.
