Dichotomy, rupture [Entz weiung], he argued, gives rise to the need for philosophy, a rupturing which reflective philosophy both seeks to resolve and exasperates. The under standing strives to enlarge itself to the absolute, but, in its finitude, it only reproduces itself endlessly, positing oppositions within itself and its prod ucts, and so mocks itself.1 The being of nature, in particular, is either dis solved into abstractions or remains but a deadly darkness within intellect. Although Fichte was Hegel's prime target here, much of contemporary philosophy was included in his critique. Hegel argued that the identity phi losophy of Schelling, however, in which reason raises itself to speculation and provides a positive account of being, overcomes such finitudes and ruptures. The Critical Journal of Philosophy that Schelling and Hegel launched from Jena in 1802, critical of the limitations of proliferating con temporary philosophical systems, sought to establish an objective philo sophical criticism based upon such a speculative use of reason.2 In Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century, all philosophy, and especially all philosophical criticism, began with reference to Kant's critical philosophy. In the "Preface" to his Difference essay, Hegel praised the spirit of Kantian philosophy, the speculative principle articulated in the transcen dental deduction of the categories, but deprecated the "remainder"?the i.

Kant never had the opportu nity to comment on the project of The Critical Journal of Philosophy, but his own critical project started from exposing the errors and contradictions of reason in its purely speculative use and arguing for its restriction to finite, empirical knowledge. Nevertheless, Kant's critical works were primarily preoccupied with the cognitive processes involved in the production of such knowledge, with the laws of reason that are the necessary conditions of possible experience, with interrogating how cognition in general is pos sible. Yet Kant left a problematic rupture in his critical examination of the conditions and sources of cognition, a rupture that he explicitly acknowledged and graphically represented in the "Introduction" to his 1790 Critique of Judgment as "an immense gulf [Kluft]" between the two do mains of our cognitive powers, that in which understanding legislates through the concept of nature and that in which reason legislates through the concept of reason, the subjects of his first two critiques.3 For Kant, this chasm leaves indeterminate not only how freedom was to be reconciled with the necessity of nature, but also how nature was to be comprehended as an organized system. We are left merely with reflective judgments of these relations, problematic acts of synthesis, rather than determinative judgments based upon the necessary laws of cognition. Kant also acknowl edged a rupture in his attempt to determine the conditions and sources of cognition in his 1782 Critique of Pure Reason, when he referred the relation of sensory intuition and understanding to a "common," "unknown root [Wurze1\."A As Heidegger has argued, it is the transcendental imagination that acts as this "unknown root," unconsciously relating the concepts of understanding to the manifold of intuition in judgment. Indeed, it is the unconscious transcendental imagination that enacts the synthesis of the manifold of intuition, prior to apperception, to produce a unified represen tation of appearances for reflective consciousness in Kant's celebrated, if problematic, "Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Un derstanding."5 If Kant designated specific judgments as indeterminate 3.

The speculative philosophy Schelling and Hegel ad vocated around 1800 appears a less radical departure from Kant's critical philosophy when the central role of the transcendental imagination in the first critique is acknowledged. Jena was the perfect site for Schelling and Hegel to launch The Critical Journal of Philosophy. The university was the center for post-Kantian philos ophy at the end of the eighteenth century, with Reinhold, one of Kant's chief expositors, the Professor of Philosophy from 1787, only to be re placed on retiring by Fichte in 1794; and it was the home of the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, the leading journal for the dissemination of Kantian phi losophy from 1785 to 1803. If Kant drew attention to the extent to which our knowledge is dependent upon cognitive processes, he did not provide an account of our knowledge of those cognitive processes. Post-Kantian philosophy thus introduced a second order critique?it not only asked how knowledge is possible, but also asked how a critique of knowledge is possi ble. Fichte introduced his Wissenschaftslehre, the science of knowledge or theory of philosophy, as such a meta-critique that took the critical philoso phy itself as an object, and posed the question of how we know the neces sary conditions of cognition.8 Fichte argued that we have an indubitable awareness of our own rational activity, of the activity of the I [Ich] in think 6.

His claim was that the self-positing activity of the I is the "first, abso lutely unconditioned principle of all human knowledge" (Grundlage 255; FsW 1: 91). Fichte further argued that this pure activity of the I can only become determinate and present for the self through the counterpositing of a not-I [Nicht-Ich] in opposition to the I. But as Hegel relentlessly made clear in his Difference essay, the not-I, if postulated to be a product of the activity of the I, remains an unconscious product. In attempting to provide a foundation for critical philosophy, Fichte's science of knowledge thus only transposed the rupture at the core of Kant's system of philosophy into a rupture within the self. In introducing the self-positing activity of the I as the foundation of all knowledge, Fichte only provided a subjective account of the relationship between the subjective and objective sides of knowl edge, what Hegel described as a "subjective subject-object," in which the not-I remains unconscious, the problem of nature a darkness within con sciousness. In his Difference essay Hegel praised Schelling's philosophy, in contrast, for giving equal weight to our knowledge of the universe "as an organiza tion intuited as objective and appearing as independent" and "the universe constructed by and for intelligence," to Naturphilosophie and transcendental idealism.9 Such a complete philosophical system, Hegel maintained, is only possible when speculative philosophy makes the synthetic acts effecting the construction of nature as transparent to the intellect as those of its own activity, the project of Schelling's Naturphilosophie. Yet Schelling had difficulties living up to the promise Hegel saw in his philosophy. The per sistent problem in all Schelling's various philosophical systems, a problem he never resolved to his lasting satisfaction, was how to give nature life by demonstrating its construction without destroying its positive presence. In the Naturphilosophie that Schelling developed from 1797, if he started from a construction of nature after Kant that sought to demonstrate the theoreti cal principles necessary for the possibility of nature, he applied the methods of critical philosophy more relentlessly than Kant, extending them even to the empirical concept of matter. The result was that all natural phenomena became problems for reflective judgment, and were conceived as complex organizations of formal and material principles, of activity and constraint, whose synthetic principle remained indeterminate. Moreover, his relentless critical construction of nature resulted in the positive presence of nature being dissolved into an abstract relation. Having thus abstracted the phe nomena of nature into theoretical principles in his speculative physics, in 9. Hegel, Differenz 6-7 and 27-28. Although Hegel's criticisms of Fichte in this essay are solely directed at his Wissenschaftslehre (1794), they also apply to his later lectures on the sci ence of knowledge.</page><page sequence="5">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 549 his 1800 System of Transcendental Idealism Schelling turned his attention to tracing the genesis of all concepts of nature from the activity of thought ac cording to the principles of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre. He concluded that the problems plaguing transcendental idealism, the dichotomizing effect of the self's reflection on its own activity and the counterpositing of the I to the not-I that left the not-I as an unconscious element within conscious ness, could only be resolved through art. Kant's critical philosophy re mained important here, but now on the Critique of Judgment and its concern with the reflective judgment of organized nature and art. Schelling's inter est in art was also influenced by the Jena Romantics?their critical reflections upon the fragmentation and incompletion of all art, their atten tion to process of artistic production, and their conception of the relation ship between the fragmentary individual and the system in terms of potentiation. Schelling conceived organized nature in analogous terms. But in attempting to articulate an absolute principle as the foundation of the whole system of nature and art, of every potency of the real and the ideal, Schelling again found himself reduced to abstract formulations, attempting to conceive it through a paradoxical logic of indifference as the identity of identity and difference. Hegel appears to have been disturbed by this aspect of Schelling's identity philosophy?even in the Difference essay there is an implicit criticism of it as empty formalism. It is thus not surprising that soon after attempting a collaboration on The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, the philosophies of Hegel and Schelling developed in quite distinctive ways. In his 1807 The Phenomenology of Spirit Hegel would seal his separation from Shelling's mode of philosophizing by condemning it as falling back into "inert simplicity" and even expounding "reality itself in an unreal man ner."10 But what Hegel saw as the failure of Schelling's philosophy is perhaps its most interesting aspect. Schelling is often represented as the grandest of metaphysical system builders. Yet developing his philosophy in the context of rigorous philosophical reflection and critique, reflection not only upon the conditions of knowledge but also upon the conditions of philosophy and critique, he encountered at every point the problem of rupture. Pur suing the ideal into its furthest reaches, he could only conceive it in terms of an abstract Band; pursuing the real, he either similarly theorized it into an abstract Band or was left with an incomprehensible dark presence. In his 1809 essay Philosophical Enquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom these problems are presented in stark and irresolvable terms. Dichotomy now ex tends even to God, who is conceived in terms of ground and existence. The ground of God, his impenetrable and unruly nature, persists in created io. Hegel, Die Phanomenologie des Geistes, in Gesammelte Werke 9: 18.</page><page sequence="6">550 JOAN STEIGERWALD nature as that which cannot be brought to order. And the absolute princi ple of indifference is now articulated only negatively, as nonground [Ungrund]. Thus a fundamental incompletion remained the core of each of Schelling's attempts at a philosophical system, an incompletion in which the problem of nature has a particular prominence. His unwillingness to publish after the Freedom essay perhaps was an acknowledgement of his in ability to produce a complete philosophical system.11 As he would argue late in life, in his Munich lectures of 1832-33: Nothing is easier than to displace oneself into the realm of pure think ing; but it is not so easy then to escape that realm. The world does not consist of mere categories or pure concepts, . . . but of concrete and contingent things, and what must be considered is the illogical, the other, which is not concept, but its opposite, which only unwilling accepts the concept. It is here that philosophy must take its test.12 The Construction of Nature: Schelling's Naturphilosophie When Schelling arrived in Jena in 1798 to take up the position of Professor of Philosophy, he was only twenty-three, yet he already had a considerable number of publications to his credit. He had completed two substantive works on Naturphilosophie, Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature in 1797 and On the World Soul in 1798. He had also published several essays critically respond ing to Fichte's writings between 1794 and 1797. The engagement with Fichte's science of knowledge began when Schelling was a student at a seminary in Tubingen together with Hegel and Holderlin. But he had de veloped an interest in Naturphilosophie by the close of his studies in 1796, an interest he was able to pursue that autumn when, taking a position as a tutor to an aristocratic family, he traveled to Leipzig, an important center for the study of the natural sciences at that time.13 At Leipzig Schelling en ii.

Although the author ship of the essay is uncertain, with Hegel and Holderlin also appearing to have had a hand in it, the emphasis on nature is likely Schelling's.

His first works on Naturphilosophie also display a close reading of Kant's critiques and his 1786 Metaphysical Foundation of Natural Science. The Ideas introduced the project of Naturphilosophie through a pre cocious dialogue with this complex of formidable sources, and particularly Kant's philosophy of nature. Schelling made clear that the concern of his Naturphilosophie was not to present a system of nature once it exists, but "the possibility of a nature"; that is, not how the connections of phenomena we call nature "have be come actual outside us, but how they became actual for us," how those con nections of phenomena attained the necessity in our representation in which we are compelled to think of them.14 The terms are Kantian. Kant's critical philosophy was concerned to determine the forms of cognition that enable knowledge of objects. He argued that the possibility of nature, indeed the possibility of an object of experience, depends upon our con cepts and representations, for only through such concepts is it possible to know anything as an object, or to know the necessary connections be tween phenomena?a priori concepts give our sensory intuitions determine meaning. But Schelling was critical of the appeal to the idea of a noumenal thing-in-itself in Kant, an idea he noted that Kant inherited through tradi tion, for to Schelling it was inconceivable what things external to us and independent of our representations might be. Such ideas make the separa tion between human beings and nature permanent, into "bottomless abysses" [bodenlosen Abgrunde].15 But Schelling did not seek unity in a meta physical monism, whether of an infinite material substance, after Spinoza, or infinite divine spirit. His sought unity in a philosophy of nature in which nature would "not only express, but even realize, necessarily and originally, the laws of our mind, and that it is called nature only insofar as it does so" (Ideen 93). Schelling was thus truer to Kant's critical philosophy than its author, at least in his view, restricting the conditions of our cogni tion of nature to the cognitive phenomena of the finite human mind. These ideas for a philosophy of nature were made more precise in Shelling's 1799 Introduction to the Outline of a System of Naturphilosophie. Naturphilosophie is now defined as a speculative physics, in which "our knowing is changed into a construction of nature itself, that is, into a sci 14- F. W.J.

The first edition attributed this dichotomizing to speculative philosophy; the second edition referred instead to reflective philosophy.</page><page sequence="8">552 JOAN STEIGERWALD ence of nature a priori." Schelling argued that we know objects only when we know the principles of their possibility, which means "a pure knowing a priori." It is only through a deduction from a priori principles that phe nomena of nature are conceived with the necessity requisite of a science.16 The basic conception remains Kantian. In the Metaphysical Foundations, Kant presented a construction of Newtonian laws of physics by reasoning a priori from categories. But Kant distinguished his metaphysical construc tions from a purely speculative philosophy of nature by making such con structions dependent upon the injection of empirical concepts from con temporary science.17 Schelling, in contrast, whilst insisting that we know nothing at all except through experience, also insisted that empirical phys ics is directed "only at the surface [Oberflache] of nature." Even experiment, he argued, is only a first step toward science. In putting a question to na ture that it is compelled to answer, experiment contains an implicit a priori judgment of nature, making it what Schelling called a "production of na ture," but experiment can never go beyond the forces of nature it uses as its tools of inquiry. A speculative physics was to have no such limitations. It was to be directed "at the inner spring-work [Triebwerk]" of nature. Ac cordingly, it was necessarily a subjective or purely theoretical science. If empirical physics is directed to what is "objective" in nature, it only "regards its object in being," as a finished product; a speculative physics, in contrast, is directed to what is "non-objective in nature"; it "regards its ob ject in becoming," in its productivity (Einleitung 274-75, 282-83). For Schelling, Kant's concept of matter is the physical correlate of his idea of the thing-in-itself. Representing the limits of human rationality, the impenetrable content of objects given to cognition, it acted in a similar way to the purported presence of some thing in experience that was the absolute other to all the mind's activity. But Schelling contended that no physical concept, no phenomena, no thing is in principle refractory to fur ther rational analysis. In the Ideas he argued that any body, no matter how inert or minute, can be regarded as a system of yet smaller bodies. His argu ment was based upon a consideration of the simplest distribution of matter in space required to ensure an orderly and self-perpetuating motion in all its parts. His solution was that of an indefinite number of unequal bodies, each disposed in relation to the others so that they all would gravitate 16.

In such an arrangement, any determinate set of bodies that achieved equilibrium around a center of gravity would also be gravitating as a unit around some other center as part of a larger system of bodies. On the other hand, the bodies within the first system could be con ceived to consist of smaller bodies all forming a system around their own center. Schelling argued that to stop the analysis at any particular system of bodies would be arbitrary. Accordingly, he rejected the conception of mat ter as an impenetrable substratum endowed with attractive and repulsive forces. Neither Kant nor Newton before him, he argued, had been able to explicate how forces are supposed to inhere in this inert substratum, or what matter without forces or forces without matter might be conceived to be. Schelling rather argued that the material content of any phenomena must also be conceived as a system of attractive and repulsive forces.18 "In resolving the problem of how matter in general is originally possible," he concluded, "the problem of a possible universe has also been solved" (Ideen 187). To state his point more modestly, the problem of understanding the nature of matter is no different from that of understanding the nature of the universe as a whole, or any organized body. Schelling thus broke down the difference in kind Kant had introduced in the Critique of Judgment between determinate judgments of inorganic bodies, in which phenomena are sub sumed directly under the concept of mechanical causality, and reflective judgments of organic bodies or nature as an organized whole, in which the complex interrelationship of phenomena posed a problem for conception. For Schelling, all of nature and each part of nature was to be understood like an organism, and thus posed a problem for judgment. Schelling also blurred the boundary between inorganic and organic phe nomena through his treatment of chemistry. In his Metaphysical Foundations Kant had excluded chemistry from science proper, which "treat[s] its ob ject according to a priori principles," because its "principles are ultimately merely empirical" (Metaphysische Anfangsgrunde 468). But some ten years on, the new French chemistry was widely accepted in Germany, providing investigators with the theoretical foundation for a science of chemistry, and new instruments and methods for the study of inorganic and organic phe nomena, the results of which were widely disseminated in new journals and monographs, and by increased funding for chairs in chemistry and chemical laboratories at universities.19 Schelling, fresh from his scientific studies at the University of Leipzig, gave chemistry a central place in the 18.

On these changes to the German chemical community, see Karl Hufbauer, The For mation of the German Chemical Community (Berkeley: U of California P, 1982).</page><page sequence="10">554 JOAN STEIGERWALD Ideas. If mechanics examines the motion of bodies under the impact of external forces, insofar as the parts of the bodies appear at rest, Schelling argued that chemistry examines how bodies supposedly inert become active under an external stimulus. He attributed the apparently spontaneous chemical reaction to the forces within bodies, which only need the stimu lus of something extraneous to be excited into free play. If that stimulus should be continued, he contended, these new activities could become permanent. "Thus already in the chemical properties of matter actually lie the first seeds, albeit still quite undeveloped, of a future system of nature, which can unfold into the most diversified forms [Formen] and formations [Bildungen], up to the point at which creative nature seems to return into herself" (Ideen 190). Schelling argued that any chemical event is open to the conceptualization of mechanics, whilst mechanical events are liable to the conceptualization of chemistry?it is just a question of the perspective of one's analysis. Furthermore, chemistry lies at the juncture of mechanical and organic bodies, with the difference between mechanical, chemical, and organic phenomena conceived as a difference in degrees of activity and or ganization rather than a difference in kind. The Naturphilosophie that Schelling put forward in the Ideas was that all natural phenomena must be conceived as an interplay of attractive and repulsive forces in varying degrees of complexity and activity. These opposed forces were not intro duced as empirical concepts, or as the physical grounds of explanation like some form of occult qualities, but as the necessary conditions for the possi bility of a world system (Ideen 79?80). If the Ideas extended the conception of natural phenomena as organized systems of opposed forces into matter infinitely and indefinitely, On the World Soul extended that basic conception in the opposite direction, through the organic world towards the appearance of mind in nature with the human form. In the 1798 work, rather than forces, Schelling referred to the more abstract notion of principles, representing the basis of life as con tained in opposed negative and positive principles. The negative principle of life is the specific material condition lying within each individual being, which determines the differing degrees of receptivity to stimulus of the di verse forms of life (Von der Weltseele, SW2: 503-5). Much of the World Soul is concerned with detailing these negative material conditions of life, by drawing upon contemporary research in chemistry and physiology, from the role of light and the elements of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in plant nutrition, to animal respiration and the influence of nutrition on irritability of muscles, with Schelling displaying an impressive command of the mate rial. But he argued that these negative conditions alone are insufficient to account for the phenomena of life?the capacity of organs to develop and maintain their form and composition, the machinations preserving the ani</page><page sequence="11">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 555 mal fluids that animate the body, the contraction of muscles?all these pro cesses are inconceivable without the assumption of a positive principle which disturbs the tendency of the negative conditions of life toward stasis. This positive principle lies outside the living individual; a single principle spread throughout the whole of creation, it penetrates each individual as the "common breath of life." But Schelling, in keeping with the project of Naturphilosophie, did not introduce this positive principle as a determinate entity and was critical of his contemporaries who appealed to a special force or Lehenskraft as a purported cause of the phenomena of life. Indeed, he even contended that language has no term for it, and hence made use of the poetic expression of the ancient philosophers, the "world soul," to in dicate metaphorically what eluded conception (Von der Weltseele 502-4, 247, 529, 565?69). Life thus appears as the interaction of an indeterminate positive principle and material conditions that are also indeterminate, re ceding, as the Ideas showed, infinitely into ever smaller systems of interact ing forces. When changing material phenomena become bound together in a product, something enduring is formed. But this product, as the com bination of phenomena, is not anything real in itself but only the concept of a definite organization, and as dependent upon actual phenomena that are continually altering, is not anything enduring?it is only the union of both, of concept and phenomena, that gives rise to a living being. Schelling translated this representation of life directly into the terms given by Kant in the Critique of Judgment. Life, "organization is nothing other than an ar rested stream of causes and effects ... a succession [of processes] that, en closed within certain borders, flows back into itself." Such an organized being "we must consider as if it is both cause and effect of itself."20 To ex press this concept of life Kant appealed to the notion of the Bildungstrieb or formative impulse, first introduced by Blumenbach to represent the forma tive activity of organic matter. For Schelling, the Bildungstrieb expresses the synthesis of positive and negative principles, activity and constraint, of free dom and lawfulness in all natural formations, but is not the explanatory ground of this union itself.21 Thus in the World Soul Schelling represented life in terms of a concept of a relation between positive and negative prin ciples, principles that are ultimately indeterminate and recede into infinity, but a concept without constitutive significance in itself. These provocative aspects of the Ideas and On the World Soul are much more explicitly articulated in Schelling's 1799 First Outline of a System of Naturphilosophie and the subsequently produced Introduction to that work, 20. Von der Weltseele, 349, 519?20. See also the Introduction to Ideen 40?44. 21. Von der Weltseele, 527-30.

In these works Schelling stressed the infinite and indeterminate nature of the negative and positive principles and the abstract and indeterminate nature of their relation in any given nat ural product. These later works also place a greater emphasis on the activity of nature, with the positive principle characterized as pure productivity and the negative principle as its constraint. Schelling also emphasized that if the negative principle is to constrain the positive principle, pure productivity, it must be something positive itself?a counteracting tendency. It is in the space between these two principles, each receding beyond the horizon of our representations, that the phenomena of nature occur. Schelling de picted the products resulting from the concurrence of the pure productiv ity, the positive principle, and constraint, the negative principle, with the image of a whirlpool. "Where [a stream] meets resistance, there is formed a whirlpool; this whirlpool is nothing fixed, but something that in every mo ment is vanishing, and in every moment springing up anew" (Einleitung 289). Such a product appears finite, "but as the infinite productivity of nature concentrates itself within it, it must have the impulse to infinite de velopment . . . the empirical representation of an ideal infinity." In each such product, therefore, lies "the germ [Keim] of a universe" (Einleitung 290?91). The image of a whirlpool highlights the activity inherent in all natural phenomena. It also suggests the potential or potency of each natural product for further change and development, already suggested by his treatment of chemistry in the Ideas, what Schelling now termed its entelechy or potency [Potenz]. Again he emphasized that the difference be tween inorganic and organic products is only the degree of productivity enclosed within it. Of particular import is the synthetic aspect of these nat ural products. Schelling's discussion of the Bildungstrieb buried in the mid dle of World Soul thus now becomes highlighted, and the discussion in Ideas of the interplay of attractive and negative forces is supplemented with a dis cussion of their synthetic relation through gravity. The concept of gravity had acquired symbolic significance during the course of the eighteenth century as the representation of an actual relation whose nature remained unknown. It was appealed to throughout the sciences to justify the intro duction of a conception of synthesis that could not be made specific, with Blumenbach introducing his notion of a Bildungstrieb by invoking the au thority of the concept of gravity.22 Schelling made the indeterminate nature of such syntheses explicit by referring to them abstractly as a third some thing, ein Dritte, "as something [etwas] which is mediated by the antithesis, and by which the antithesis is in turn mediated" (Einleitung 308). Nature is 22. Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Uber den Bildungstrieb, 2nd ed.

For Schelling, this indeterminate relation between activity and constraint, form and matter, was not only a problem of organic bodies and the system of nature as a whole, as in Kant's Critique of Judgment, but of each natural product. In his 1799 works Schelling introduced a series of analogies, analogies between sensibility and magnetism, between irritability and electricity, be tween the Bildungstrieb and chemistry, each in turn represented in terms of opposed principles in different relations and potencies. Scientific details seem obfuscated by this overlaying of apparently fanciful speculations. But Schelling was very clear that he was not offering a system of nature but a system of speculative physics; his concern was not with natural products but with the principles for the construction of nature, the principles neces sary for our knowledge of nature. Whereas Kant's construction of nature was dependent upon empirical concepts, upon some content given in ex perience that was not open to further analysis, Schelling critically ques tioned such restrictions, arguing that speculative physics cannot set out from some product, some "thing," but must extend to the unconditioned (Einleitung 283). The result was a construction of nature premised upon an opposition of positive and negative principles, both of which extended into infinity and so defied determinate representation. Between these opposites "all of nature lies" as some Dritte struggling to indifference, as an infinitely progressive formation, in which are found only relative mediating links of synthesis, never a lasting or an absolute synthesis. In any particular product there is both productivity and constraint, freedom and necessity, so that in even the simplest formation there is some element of freedom and the po tential for further formation, and in even the highest formation some ele ment of necessity. It would be a strange metaphysical system in which "outside this opposition nothing is." Schelling relentlessly questioned all foundations for a system of speculative physics so that in the end he was left only with this indeterminate opposition. But as he argued, "who cannot think activity or opposition without a substrate cannot philosophize at all" (Einleitung 308). Schelling introduced his Naturphilosophie in 1797 by arguing: "Nature should be the visible mind [Geist], the mind the invisible nature. Here then, in the absolute identity of the mind within us and nature outside us, the problem of how a nature external to us is possible must be solved" (Ideen 93). In the Ideas he also included a chapter on the "First Origin of</page><page sequence="14">558 JOAN STEIGERWALD the Concept of Matter, from the Nature of Perception and the Human Mind," in which he provided a "transcendental discussion" of the concept of matter, tracing the origin of the concept in our minds after the method of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre (Ideen 213-23). Thus from the beginning of his engagement with Naturphilosophie, he was concerned with its relationship to idealism. Indeed, the positive and negative principles of his Natur philosophie, pure activity and its constraint, were conceived as analogies of the activities of freedom and constraint in Fichte's analysis of the activity of thinking. On the completion of his three important works on Natur philosophie, Schelling turned to the problem of the relationship of his Naturphilosophie to transcendental idealism. The Natural History of the Mind: Transcendental Idealism In his 1800 System of Transcendental Idealism Schelling offered a new con ception of the natural history of the mind, depicting the emergence of na ture from the mind by tracing the genesis of all intuitions and concepts of nature from the mind's activity according to the principles and method of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre. Fichte's dominant presence in Jena no doubt stimulated Schelling shortly after his arrival there to reexamine Fichte's work with which he had engaged so productively as a student at Tubingen. Moreover, given the project of his speculative science to bring theory into the phenomena of nature, to examine the a priori conditions or the possibil ity of a nature, it became important to clarify its relationship to idealism. Schelling insisted that the two were quite separate sciences, starting from different bases and proceeding in different directions. Naturphilosophie as cends from experience and empirical laws to the pure principles prior to all experience; it sets out to idealize the real, to spiritualize all natural laws into the laws of thought. Transcendental idealism, in contrast, descends from pure subjectivity to empirical phenomena; it sets out to produce a realism out of idealism, to display phenomena as products of the mind. Thus although both offer constructions of nature, they do so in distinct ways. As opposed to Fichte, Schelling contended that a complete system of philoso phy would need both.23 His System of Transcendental Idealism was introduced as a complement to his earlier Naturphilosophie, and as a part of a complete philosophical system. Schelling also offered a different emphasis than Fichte in his treatment of transcendental idealism?whereas Fichte was principally concerned with finding a consistent definition of the principle of pure sub jectivity and proving his system through immediate inference from that principle, Schelling claimed to offer a factual proof of transcendental ideal 23. Schelling, System 340-42; and Einleitung 271-72. Schelling would repeat this argument in numerous essays in the early nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="15">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 559 ism by demonstrating that it could actually derive the entire system of knowledge (System 377). Fichte's science of knowledge is best understood as a reworking of Kant's critical philosophy, and its claim to examine the sources and condi tions of cognition. As Schelling's Naturphilosophie subjected the empirical concepts that Kant took as a starting point for his construction of nature to further critical construction, so Fichte subjected the facts of consciousness that Kant took as the starting point for his critical philosophy to further critical analysis. Fichte objected, for example, to Kant resting the argument for practical reason upon an appeal to a fact of consciousness. He also main tained that Kant "by no means proved that the categories he set up to be the conditions of self-consciousness, but merely said that they were this."24 In deed, Kant left the synthesis of the manifold of intuition that constitutes the categories to the unconscious activity of the transcendental imagination (Critique of Pure Reason A778/B103). Fichte sought to examine the grounds for these facts [Thatsache] of consciousness by examining the activity of thinking giving rise to them, what he called the Act or active deed [Thathandlung].25 Rather than simply accepting that an "I think" accompa nies all states of consciousness, Fichte demanded of his students and readers that they attend to the activity of thinking involved in thinking the I. He would thus claim to provide a better defense of Kant's philosophy than Kant himself gave, and in ways more consistent with the principles of criti cal philosophy. In attending to the activity of one's I in thinking, Fichte cautioned against turning such activity of thinking into phenomena of consciousness requiring a distinct subject possessing awareness of that phenomena, result ing in an infinite regression of the subject's thinking of thinking. Such an error had been made by Reinhold, Fichte's predecessor at Jena.26 In his Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge, published in 1794 for his first lectures on the Wissenschaftslehre in Jena, Fichte introduced the notion of self-positing [sich setzen] to avoid the self-alienating effect of the infinite re gress of reflection upon the self's activity of thinking. The positing of the I through itself is thus its own pure activity.?The I posits itself, and by virtue of this mere self-assertion it is; and con 24.

It is at once the agent [Handelnde] and the product of action [Handlung]; the active [Thdtige], and what the activity [Thatigkeit] brings about; action [Handlung] and deed [That] are one and the same, and hence the / am [Ich bin] expresses an Act [Thathandlung]. (Grundlage 259; FsW 1: 96) Fichte played with the double meaning of the word Seyn, as both the noun "being" and the verb "to be" or logical copula "is," to express the identity of the self's being and the activity of thought in self-positing. In the posit ing of itself, he argued, the I is both subject and predicate, subject and ob ject of itself. For Fichte, philosophical reflection is concerned with the transformative activity of reflecting on the form of knowing, "through which the form becomes the form of the form as its content and returns into itself" (FsW 1: 67). But the Wissenschaftslehre is not solely a formal sci ence of potentially unending reflection, of the self reflecting upon the form of its thought. The positing of the I determines the I, making its being present, and halting the infinity of reflection. The term Thathandlung ex presses the identity of reflection and positing, of the form and content of the self's activity.27 The judgment that something is something, that phenomenological awareness of something is connected to a concept, that act of thought, constitutes the being of the self as an active power or pure activity. The content of the self's activity is thus identical to its form. Fichte introduced this absolute [schlechthin], unconditioned self-positing of the I as the first principle of all philosophy. Fichte thus foregrounds the identity of the self, the "I think" that Kant held accompanies all cognitive activities, making it the basis of all human knowledge. But, as Heidegger has noted, Kant held that the identity of the self that accompanies all cognition only becomes aware of itself through opposition [entgegensteht] to some object [Gegenstand] of thought or repre sentation.28 Fichte followed Kant here, oppositing or counterpositing [Entgegensetzen] to the positing [setzen] of the I [Ich] that of a not-I [Nicht Ich] as the second principle of all human knowledge. The not-I acts as a check [AnstoJJ] or limit upon the I's infinite and unconditioned activity, reflecting it back upon itself and thus making it conscious of itself. Fichte used this strange expression not-I to indicate that all cognitive activity in volves the I, that any phenomenon must be a phenomenon of conscious ness for us to be aware of it as a phenomenon?a not-I. Like Schelling, 27. See Walter Benjamin, "Der Begriffder Kunstkritik in der deutschen Romantik," in Walter Benjamin Gesammelte Schriften, ed.

Yet this phenom enon of consciousness appears as something alien and unconscious to the pure, unconditioned activity of the I?a not-l. The opposition of the I and not-I led Fichte to introduce a third principle, that of a synthetic relation between these opposites. This third principle addresses the Kantian prob lem of how synthetic a priori judgments are possible. Fichte argued that by regarding the pure activity of the I as quantitatively divided into an objec tive portion of the I, or not-I, opposed to a subjective portion of the I, their synthesis could be comprehended as grounded in the self-positing I as the basis of both. From these three principles?the pure, unconditioned activity of the I, the opposition within the I's activity of a not-I to the I, and the synthesis of the I and the not-I?Fichte claimed to be able to de rive the entire form and content of cognitive activity. Fichte's presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre is mind-numbingly convo luted, and it is hard to imagine his students thinking with him as he traced the supposed activity of the I through all aspects of its self-construction. Its complex formulation is in part due to its hasty composition and episodic publication as lecture notes, and in part due to Fichte's unusual modes of expression. Indeed, some have read him as postulating the production of the entire world from the absolute, unconditioned activity of the self, al though it is unclear what that might mean.29 But we should take seriously Fichte's claim that he was a Kantian, that he offered a critical examination of the cognitive activities of the finite human mind, and only went beyond Kant in offering a critical examination of elements of cognition left opaque by Kant. The close relationship between Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre and Kant's critical philosophy is particularly manifest in the "Deduction of Representation," the summary statement that concluded the first, theoreti cal part of the Foundations, and that was based on the argument and termi nology of Kant's "Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of Un derstanding" in the Critique of Pure Reason (Fichte, Grundlage 369?84; FsW 1: 228-46). In Kant's treatment, the synthesis of intuitions into a unified representation, ready for recognition in a concept, is enacted by the tran scendental imagination working unconsciously. As the "unknown," but "common root" of sensation and thought, the transcendental imagination has an essential but problematic place in Kant's architecture of pure rea son.30 Fichte, in contrast, argued that through philosophical reflection, all 29. Neuhouser attributes such "popular" readings of Fichte as due to a misreading of his use of the term absolute [schlechthin]. Fichte used the term to refer to the unconditioned activity of the I, rather than to claim that the I was an absolute being productive of all other being. See Neuhouser, Fichte's Theory of Subjectivity 46. 30. Kant, Critique of Pure Reason A98-100 and A15/B29. See Heidegger, Kant 33-35, 130 36 and 155.</page><page sequence="18">562 JOAN STEIGERWALD activity of the I could be attended to and traced genetically, including that of the imagination. Indeed, a science of knowledge must not only posit knowledge as the identity of intuition and thought, but show that identity by its Act (Hegel, Differenz 36). Fichte depicted the imagination as wavering between the opposite directions of the I's activity, its spontane ous, outward activity and the reversion of that activity back into itself through some extraneous check. The imagination thus posits an intuited [Anschauen], an "extuition [Hinschauen] of an indeterminate something [Etwas]" and has its wavering or transciency stabilized or brought to a stand [verstandigt] in a concept of the understanding [Verstand]?1 Not only the intuited but also the intuitant is thus determined through reflection, in Fichte's version of Kant's argument for the unity of apperception. Indeed, all elements of Kant's presentation are found in Fichte's, including the syn thesis of the now dichotomized intuition and concept through judgment, in which the activity of the I in the form of the imagination again enacts the synthesis, now rendered a conscious act through philosophical re flection. Hegel's critique of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre in his Difference essay was that this reflexive re-enactment of the immediate and unconscious ac tivity of the I in fact separates the I from itself. Indeed, reflection can only conceive of the synthetic activity of the I by first dividing the I into subjec tive and objective portions, thus rendering its synthesis as merely relative and theoretical. Fichte's transcendental treatment of the I's unified activity does not provide the conditions of its possibility, Hegel argued, but rather makes it impossible (Differenz 34-40). In his attempt to explicate the aspects of cognitive activity Kant left unconscious and unexplicated Fichte has thus only multiplied the ruptures within the self?not only is the synthetic ac tivity of thought comprehensible to philosophical reflection solely on the premises of a separation within the I of its subjective and objective parts, of the I from the not-I, but the immediate synthetic activity of the I is also separated from the reflective activity of the I. But the most scandalous aspect of Fichte's account for Hegel is his account of the not-I. The I's spontaneous activity must be checked and reflected by something alien to its act. Into the infinity beyond the check and reflection of the I, there is posited a product of the imagination, "through a dark, unreflected intuition that does not reach consciousness. . . . This product is the not-I."32 That the not-I remains unconscious 3i. Fichte, Grundlage 371 and 373-74; FsW 1: 230 and 233. Although the transcendental imagination has only a very implicit role in Kant's "Transcendental Aesthetic," Heidegger gives it emphasis in the formation of intuitions in his reading of Kant.

Vater "The Construction of Nature 'Through a Dark, Unreflected Intuition,'" Fichte Studien 11 (1997): 1-11.</page><page sequence="19">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 563 means, however, that although the activity of the transcendental imagina tion that was left as unconscious and unknown in Kant is now explicated through Fichte's philosophical reflection upon the activity of the I, some thing unconscious and inexplicable nevertheless remains in his science of knowledge in the guise of the not-I?an alien element, a dark spot, a nega tion of being at the heart of being. Hegel complained that "the objective world, in its endless determinacy through intelligence, still remains a some thing for intelligence that is at the same time undetermined for it. The not I has no positive character, to be sure; but it does have the negative charac ter of being something other, that is, something opposite in general" (Differenz 42). For Fichte, Hegel argued, pure consciousness, since it is a positing of itself, cannot produce the not-I from itself nor conquer it, rather it must presuppose it, and yet in doing so it recognizes its own pri mordial defectiveness. From the standpoint of the I's activity "nature has the character of absolute objectivity or of death" (Differenz 51). Fichte, having recognized such problems in his discussion of theoretical philosophy, attempted to resolve them in his discussion of practical philos ophy in the third and final part of the Foundations. That practical philoso phy appeared at the end of his work belies its import for Fichte. When Fichte first became engaged with Kant in 1790 whilst preparing for a tutor ing position, it was Kant's Critique of Practical Reason and its argument that any understanding of human beings must start from the fact and experience of freedom that affected him most profoundly. His experience with censor ship shortly thereafter made him a public and strident defender of freedom and the French Revolution.33 And as a teacher in Jena he continually de manded that his students display freedom of thought, that they think for themselves, arguing that the science of knowledge could not be learned by transmission from another but only by attending freely and critically to the activity of thinking in oneself In the concluding part of the Foundations Fichte argued that practical reason was a necessary condition of theoretical reason, that self-consciousness was grounded in self-autonomy. The philo sophical reflection that enabled awareness of all activity of thinking, of all acts of the I, is an act of absolute freedom. Philosophical reflection lifts itself out of the sphere of givenness by an act of free choice [Willkur] and thus produces consciously what in empirical consciousness intelligence produces unconsciously so that it appears to be given. But Fichte reconciled the ab solute, infinitely free activity of the I in philosophical reflection with finite 33- See Daniel Breazeale, "Editor's Introduction," in J. G.

Rather than positing a complete determination of the not-I by the free activity of the I, Fichte ascribed to the I a striving toward determination. The sub ject's absolute independence from its object, the I's complete conquest of the not-I, remains a demand [Forderung] of practical reason. As Hegel criti cally noted, the practical faculty of the I is not able achieve absolute self intuition any more than the theoretical faculty, but can only progress infinitely towards it.34 The not-I remains eternally opposed to the I. Fichte attempted a new presentation of his Wissenschaftslehre in his Jena lectures from 1796 to 1799, in which freedom became the starting point for his exposition. He now even allowed that the first principle of philoso phy, whether the highest condition of philosophy is regarded as the thing in-itself or the self-positing I, is a matter of free choice, although he did go on to argue that only the latter choice could produce a complete and con sistent philosophical system.35 Fichte began his new sequence of lectures by describing self-positing as a transition from spontaneous activity to self intuition, an act of free self-determination that is at the same time an im mediate intuition of the I. Fichte now used the expression intellectual intu ition for this immediate self-consciousness, in which the self-reverting activity of the intellect is at the same time the original intuition of the I. The intuition is intellectual as its object is the activity of the I as opposed to an object extraneous to the I?the object of consciousness is the subject of consciousness. But this immediate consciousness does not provide concep tually mediated awareness of the I's activity; "immediate consciousness is no consciousness at all." In Fichte's new version of the Wissenschaftslehre reflection is still needed to trace genetically the initial free activity of the I, and bring it to repose or stability in a fixed concept. Free self-determina tion is the I's real activity, its practical activity, its actual doing, its striving. Reflection on this real activity is the I's ideal activity, its theoretical activity, the activity that produces the concept of the I. "An image of this real activ ity is that of a river that continues to flow even while it mirrors ourself in our eye. What our eye does when it observes the river corresponds to the ideal activity."36 But if real or practical activity took precedence in Fichte's 1796/99 Wissenschaftslehre, it is a practical activity that is intellectual; free self-determination is intuitable only as a determination to become some thing, with a concept of a goal underlying each free act, as an ideal, a 34- Fichte, Grundlage 396-401; FsW 1: 261-66; Hegel, Differenz 43-45; and Neuhouser, Fichte's Theory of Subjectivity 50-51. 35.

This intellectual restriction of practicality also appeared in Fichte's dis cussion of willing; willing freely restricts thinking to a particular direction, and is at the same time a kind of thinking in its determination of that direc tion.37 Thus Fichte's I retains its duplicitous nature?the I is a subject object, both real and ideal activity, free self-determination and reflection, willing and thinking. After a couple of years in Jena, Schelling redirected his energy to the philosophy of his earlier mentor and more recent colleague, and became concerned to find a way to relate Fichte's idealism to his recent work in Naturphilosophie. His 1800 System of Transcendental Idealism was introduced as such a complement to Naturphilosophie. Schelling opened the System by rehearsing Fichte's arguments for the need for an ultimate principle of all human knowledge in the form of immediate self-consciousness or intellec tual intuition. Schelling then proceeded to derive "the entire system of knowledge" from this principle, with each representation being depicted as a product of the synthesis of the free activity of the I and its limitation by the not-I. For the I itself, each synthetic act is a single, instantaneous, un conscious act of productive intuition grounded in the original act of imme diate self-consciousness. Philosophical reflection can, however, analyze these unconscious acts into a sequence of acts that can be traced con sciously and progressively in time. But although thus closely following the method of Fichte's transcendental idealism, Schelling's System contained significant criticisms of and clear departures from its explication of human subjectivity. In Schelling's presentation philosophical reflection remains alienated from the original activity of the I by its reflexive observation of the I's activity. If the transcendental philosopher recognizes the principle of the harmony between subjective and objective, conscious and unconscious activities of the I lies within the I, "The / itself does not see this" (System 610). The philosopher in fact can only present a temporal narrative of a progressive revelation of identity through the seemingly endless conflict of original duplicity within the self.38 Fichte had gone to great lengths to eliminate the alienating or dichotomizing effect of self-reflection, the pre cise problem he criticized in Rheinhold's presentation of a first principle of philosophy, by claiming the identity of "I am" and "I think" in self positing, the identity of real and ideal activity of the I in intellectual intu 37- Fichte, (Wissenschaftslehre) Nova Methodo 147-53 and 277-307; and Giinter Zoller, "Thinking and Willing in Fichte's Theory of Subjectivity," in New Perspectives on Fichte, ed.

But it is difficult to retain a unitary notion of the I when it is intuitant and intuited, and the activity of intuiting, and when the I's awareness of itself as such only arises through philosophical reflection. Fichte himself was aware of these problems, and would make yet another presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre in 1801 in an attempt to resolve them.39 This dichotomizing and alienating effect of reflection, to which Hegel had drawn attention in his Difference essay, is di rectly criticized by Schelling in the System. Manfred Frank argues that it was such problems with Fichte's transcendental idealism that led Schelling in his writings subsequent to the System to posit an absolute spirit [Gmr] extraneous to the finite individual consciousness as the ultimate determi nant of the finite I.40 Certainly in the philosophy of identity that Schelling developed in the early nineteenth century he introduced an idea of the absolute, as pure identity and indifference of ideality and reality, as the ultimate principle of a complete system of philosophy, claiming thus to overcome the shortcom ings of transcendental idealism. But for Schelling in the System, as for Hegel in 1801, it was the inability of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre to illuminate na ture, the counterpositing of a not-I to the I that remained opaque to con sciousness, that made it an incomplete philosophical system.41 In the 1796/ 99 formulation of the Wissenschaftslehre Fichte retained his postulate that "one cannot grasp the concept of the I which comes into being by deter minate activity without determining this concept by means of an opposed Not-I"; "ideal activity is possible only as constrained activity" ([Wissen schaftslehre] Nova Methodo 67, 174). Indeed, the not-I must be something real if it is to constrain the free activity of the I. Hence Fichte gave it the designation being, a being that annihilates the actual doing and striving of the I. But he again rehearsed his argument that it is absurd to treat the not-I as a thing-in-itself, for although it is something opposed to the activity of the I, and intuited by the I, it can be nothing actual unless related to acting on the part of the I. Thus the not-I is but another way of looking at the I. 39- Indeed, in some presentations of his Wissenschaftslehre Fichte does not escape this prob lem at all. See in particular his 1796 publication "Vergleichung des vom Herrn Prof. Schmid aufgestellen Systems mit dem Wissenschaftslehre," in Gesamtausgabe 1.3: 235-66; FsW 2: 421-58. For critical examinations of Fichte's attempts to resolve these difficulties, see Dieter Henrich, "Fichtes urspriingliche Einsicht," in Subjektivitat und Metaphysik, ed.

Frank argues that it was Holderlin, the close friend of Schelling and Hegel in Tubingen, who first identified these problems with Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre. See Frank, Einleitung in Schellings Philosophie. 41. See, for example, Schelling's letter to Fichte of 19 November 1800, in Schelling, Briefe und Dokumente, ed.

As a real negation of the I's activity or striving, it is itself a suppressed activity or drive [Trieb], whose actual being remains con cealed ([Wissenschaftslehre] Nova Methodo 131-33, 169-80). In his new presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre, Fichte still only offered what Hegel had criticized as a subjective subject-object, and the problem of nature re mained. As Schelling argued in an 1801 essay, "Over the True Concept of Naturphilosophie," what remains but a negative presence of the not-I in Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre are activities to be explicated, which is the task of Naturphilosophie.42 Fichte, in fact, appears simply to have ignored Schelling's first works on Naturphilosophie. But he did communicate to Schelling his objections to Schelling's presentation of the relations between Natur philosophie and transcendental idealism in the "Introduction" to the System and in his 1801 Presentation of my System of Philosophie, arguing that "there is no special idealism, or realism, or Naturphilosophie . . . there is everywhere only one science, this is the WissenschaftsL[ehre]."43 It was these differences regarding the place of nature in a philosophical system that led to the col lapse of their intended collaboration on The Critical Journal of Philosophy, and Schelling enlisting Hegel instead. After the appearance of Hegel's Dif ference essay, relations between Fichte and Schelling eroded sharply, with each criticizing the other's philosophical system with growing acrimony in publications and in public lectures.44 The direction that Schelling's philosophical system would take over the next years was indicated in the last sections of the System. Schelling empha sized here, as he had in his Naturphilosophie, that the highest construction of nature is that of organic nature or an organized system, and then intro duced the argument that the highest construction of free human activity is that of art. Schelling's model was clearly Kant's Critique of Judgment. He concluded the System by representing the problem of the relation of Naturphilosophie and transcendental idealism as the problem of the relation between a philosophy of organism and a philosophy of art. Schelling accepted the main argument of Kant's "Critique of Teleological Judg ment," that nature as a product must appear as purposive, as an identity of 42.

He argued that nature can be comprehended thus only intellectually, that the organism is only a monogram [Monogramm], an intricate sketch [verschlungen Zug] or reflection [Reflex], of an act of synthe sis within the I (System 611). For Schelling the problem then became how to represent this identity enacted in thought objectively and to others. Rather than turning, like Kant, to the productive use of such judgments by physicians like Blumenbach in their observations and experimental activities, Schelling turned to art, proposing a much more intimate rela tionship between the two parts of the Critique of Judgment than presented by Kant. Schelling argued that through artistic production the dichotomy be tween the original productive intuition of the I and philosophical reflection can be resolved, for in it productive intuition or imagination is taken to its highest power, and its action brought to consciousness. Aesthetic intuition has the ability "to bring together that which exists in separation in the ap pearance of freedom and in intuition of the natural product; namely identity of the conscious and the unconscious in the I, and consciousness of this identity" (System 612). Artistic production begins with an opposition between con scious and unconscious activities, with "a feeling of a seemingly irresolvable contradiction," but it reaches a point where production must stop, where all conflict is resolved, and where conscious and unconscious activity merge into one, and so ends "in the feeling of infinite harmony" (System 617) Moreover, in the art product the identity breaks free from the intelli gence in which it was produced to become totally objective to intelligence. "Intelligence will therefore end with a complete recognition of the identity expressed in the product as an identity whose principle lies in intelligence itself; that is, it will end in a complete intuiting of itself." "That which the philosopher allows to be divided even in the first act of consciousness, and which would otherwise be inaccessible to any intuition, comes, through the wonder of art, to be reflected back from the products thereof." "The aesthetic intuition simply is the intellectual intuition become objective." Schelling thus concluded his examination of transcendental idealism with the claim that "art is the only true and eternal organon and document of philosophy" (System 615, 625, 627-28). But in the philosophy of art presented in the System, Schelling has not actually removed the unconscious element, the darkness or rupture, at the heart of transcendental idealism, but only displaced it and renamed it. Schelling contended that artists bring an element of necessity to their free creations in that they are involuntarily driven to create their works and in producing them satisfy an irresistible urge of their own nature. It is this in comprehensible gift granted by nature that endows their productions with</page><page sequence="25">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 569 objectivity (System 616-19). Thus, some notion of the unconscious not-I that he criticized in Fichte's transcendental idealism remains. Schelling has introduced an unconscious drive into artistic production, an element of necessity that he leaves unexplicated, simply likening it to fate. Identity Philosophy as Negative Philosophy: Art, Nature, and the Absolute It was not only through Kant's Critique of Judgment that Schelling came to see the import of aesthetics. Aesthetics was second only to critical philoso phy as a preoccupation of those based in Jena at the turn of the nineteenth century. This preoccupation was due not only to the presence of Schiller, and of Goethe and Herder in nearby Weimar, but also the small group of early romantic writers and critics that gathered in Jena from 1798 to 1800. Soon after arriving in Jena, Schelling began associating with this romantic group, frequently meeting with them at the home of August Wilhelm and Caroline Schlegel, and becoming progressively involved with Caroline. When Schelling decided to give lectures on the philosophy of art from 1802 to 1805, he turned to August Wilhelm for information about the em pirical details of art and its history; he managed to maintain cordial relations despite his affair with Schlegel's wife. But it was Friedrich Schlegel, and to a lesser extent Novalis, who had the most profound influence on his phi losophy of art. Influenced by the philosophical debates taking place around them in Jena, they regarded an awareness of rupture as the heart of the modern consciousness, arguing that modern poetry is distinguished by con taining its own critique and thus reflection upon its fragmentation and incompletion, in contrast to the sense of natural form and perfection in classical poetry. But if critique, stimulated by philosophical reflections of the time, opened up a sense of rupture even within works of art, for these Jena Romantics it was only through artistic production or poesy that the possibility of bridging that gap lay. The romantic concept of poetry not only contained its own theory and critique, but theory and critique were in turn conceived as poetry. Schlegel in fact argued for a union of art and phi losophy, that "poetry and philosophy should become one."45 By 1800 Schelling was convinced. As he worked out a new philosophical system in the first years of the nineteenth century that would give equal place to the real and ideal, and that would attempt to resolve the problem of their rela tionship, his philosophy of identity, it was the conception of art of the Jena Romantics, and its attendant conceptions of reflection and critique, that increasingly informed his idea of the ideal. Benjamin has offered a helpful interpretation of the concept of art 45- Friedrich Schlegel, Philosophical Fragments, trans.

For Fichte, reflection has refer ence to the I; it is a thinking that produces its own object, so that the form and content of thinking, intellect and intuition, are identical. The roman tics, in contrast, remained with pure reflection, pure intellect, a thinking that produces its own form and thus in which thinking is infinite, rising to ever higher levels of reflection?the thinking of thinking of thinking, and so on. For Fichte, the pure activity of the I is limited and determined by means of opposition to a not-I. The romantics, contrarily, allowed reflection to expand infinitely without limit or check, so that rather than the not-I, the absolute becomes the counter-I to the activity of the I. Yet attention is thus not directed to the substance of the absolute, but to the unfolding of the absolute, as revealed in the medium of reflection. For the romantics, the infinity of reflection was not simply an infinity of continued advance, but an infinity of connectedness. Interconnection is grasped in a mediated way from the infinitely many stages of reflection, and from the way everything hangs together in an infinitely manifold manner or system atically. Novalis described the movement in the medium of reflection as "romanticizing," thus indicating it as essential to romanticism: "Romanti cizing is nothing but a qualitative potentiation. The lower self becomes identified with the higher self through this operation. "46 As Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy have argued, romantic criticism draws attention to the reflective excess of poetry or literature in relation to itself, to its demand for completion and perfection beyond of any finite instance of it. Schlegel's 1800 Conversations over Poesy, a critical dialogue that mirrors the exchanges of the Jena group, raised the question of what is romantic poetry, to the point of demonstrating its impossibility. The characters have all devoted themselves to poetic composition. Yet only one character, Lothario, who corresponds to Novalis, promises to deliver a work, repeat edly; a promise he never delivers, but merely repeats at the dialogue's end. They are characters waiting for the work, characters waiting for a view of the work; thus romanticism occupies the place of the absence of the work. Reflective criticism results in the infinitization of poetry by demonstrating the impossibility of actually producing the perfect work that it promises, but thus directing attention to the process of production.47 That the nega tive space of romantic poetry resulting from its containing its own critique, 46.

Its aim isn't merely to unite all the separate species of poetry and put poetry in touch with philosophy and rhetoric. It tries to and should mix and fuse poetry and prose, inspiration and criticism. . . . And it can also?more than any other form?hover at the midpoint between portrayer and portrayed, free of all real and ideal self-interest, on the wings of poetic reflection, and can raise that reflection again and again to a higher power, can multiply it in an endless succession of mirrors. . . . Other kinds of poetry are finished and are now capable of being fully analysed. The romantic kind of poetry is still in the state of becoming; that, in fact, is its real essence: that it should forever be becoming and never be per fected. (Philosophical Fragments AF 116) Criticism becomes essential to romantic poetry as the reflection that raises poetry to an ever higher power, but in the process criticism becomes po etic. Hovering at the midpoint between the ideal and its realization, it finds itself in the space of production, of the formation of form, the domain of poesy. The absence of form in form necessitates the formation of form. It is only through criticism that poetry penetrates to the heart of the formative process that constitutes it. This critical reflexivity is clearly manifested in the romantic genre of the fragment. The fragment is not unique to romanticism, and most generally designates a work that has no pretence of completion, but rather that indi cates that incompletion can and even must be published. The romantic fragment, however, makes incompletion essential to every work of art. The fragment thus becomes the projection of what it incompletes, and identical to the romantic project expressed in Athenaeum fragment 116 of a "progres sive universal poetry," a poetry that is "forever becoming and never per fected." But the individuality of the fragment also suggests an organic wholeness. "A fragment, like a miniature work of art, has to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world and to be complete in itself like a por cupine" (AF 206). Yet individual fragments, if like singular organic totali ties or systems in miniature, because of their incompletion, remain only seeds or germs of future systems. "Aren't all systems individuals just as all individuals are systems at least in embryo and tendency? Isn't every real en tity historical? Aren't there individuals who contain within themselves whole systems of individuals?"48 In an age of system building, the fragment 48. AF 242. See also Novalis, Schriften 2: 463.</page><page sequence="28">572 JOAN STEIGERWALD was the only possible system that the romantics could conceive. But if failed expressions of totality, fragments critically point "toward the heart of things," the productive center of each system, each individual, for what makes an individual is its capacity to hold itself together, the internal Bildungstrieb that enables it to produce itself. "The genre of the fragment is the genre of generation. "49 The fragment thus captures the event character of a system, the relation of parts into a whole that occurs in each individual formation, the formative act essential to every work of art. It is here that the romantic project expressed in Athenaeum fragment 116 lies. The argument of the Jena Romantics that critique and reflection can only be checked by the absolute, their attention to the medium of reflection and process of formation, their conception of the relationship be tween the individual and the system, the finite and infinite, in terms of potentiation?all these ideas can be found within Schelling's philosophy of identity. In a series of works published in the early 1800s, Schelling argued that the entire system of mind and nature must necessarily have reference to the absolute or God as a first principle, as the absolute identity or indif ference [Indifferenz] of ideality and reality. Schelling insisted that this iden tity was original, rather than being the result or synthesis of sublated oppo sites; yet, to account for otherness and difference, it must have a principle of difference built into it. As Schelling articulated this problem in his 1802 work Bruno or On the Natural and Divine Principle of Things, "we must define this supreme identity as the identity of identity [Einheit] and opposi tion [Gegensatz], or the identity of the self-identical [selbst Gleiche] and the non-identical [Ungleiche].50 But what is indifferent in the absolute appears to us as separation, as the sundering of the ideal and the real. If the absolute is the identity or indifference of the ideal and the real, phenomena are distin guished by differences of emphasis or preponderances of ideality or reality, what Schelling termed potencies [Potenzen]. [Potency] refers to the general doctrine of philosophy regarding the essential and inner identity of all things and of that which we are able to distinguish in general. There is actually and essentially only One essence, One absolute reality, and this essence, as absolute, is indivisi ble such that it cannot change over into other essences by means of division and separation; since it is indivisible, diversity among things is 49- Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, Literary Absolute 49, 39-58, 90-93; Rodolphe Gasche, "Foreward: Ideality in Fragmentation," in Schlegel, Philosophical Fragments xi-xiii; and Schlegel, Philosophical Fragments 1, no. 155. 50.

(Philosophie der Kunst, SW 5: 366) In his 1802 Presentation of my System of Philosophy, Schelling represented these concepts in mathematical terms (SW 4: I37f): + A=B A=B+ A= A The mathematical formula illustrates how each phenomenon, A = B, is an image of the absolute identity, A = A, and how the entire absolute informs [einbilden] itself into every potency, but with a preponderance of ideality or reality, an imbalance toward one pole or the other. There are no real or ideal entities as such, only relative identities of the real and ideal. Indeed, each potency is always correlated with and reflects its opposite. And each individual potency of the real and the ideal has its identity only through its relation to absolute identity or indifference. Schelling regarded the system thus constructed to have a completeness lacking in his System of Transcen dental Idealism; the whole, whilst containing all difference, has a perfect bal ance between ideality and reality, and thus is itself total indifference. In his identity philosophy Schelling retained the privileging of art and organic nature found in the System. Art, as the highest potency of the ideal, is the identity or indifference of knowledge and action, unconsciousness and consciousness, necessity and freedom; the organism, as the highest po tency of the real or nature, is the identity or indifference of matter and form, corporeality and activity. What is essential to art, as well as to the organism, is the productive activity of relating the real and ideal. "All art is the direct expression of the absolute act of production or the absolute self-affirmation." Indeed, "poesy [Poesie], that is creating [Erschaffung]," "can be viewed as the essence of all art" (Philosophie der Kunst 631?32). Within art, this creating occurs through artistic genius, the presence of the univer sal mind in the individual mind, as in his or her product, the individual art product, the infinite is present. But whilst in the System, Schelling had regarded genius an "exceptional human being," in whom "that unal terable identity, on which all existence is founded, had laid aside the veil with which it shrouds itself in others," in his lectures on Philosophy of Art, it became the "daemon" [Genie or Genius], the creative spirit or "indwelling element of divinity" that is part of the nature of all human beings (System 616; Philosophie der Kunst 460). Within nature, this productive activity takes different forms in different potencies or different natural phenomena. In his 1799 works, Schelling had added to the construction of matter through positive and negative principles the necessity of a third principle of con struction, gravity or even more metaphorically that third [Dritte] which</page><page sequence="30">574 JOAN STEIGERWALD is "a striving after indifference, a striving which is conditioned through differ ence itself, and through which difference in turn is conditioned" (SW 3: 309). In On the World Soul, the formative activity relating the positive and negative tendencies within the organism had been represented by the concept of the Bildungstrieb. In his 1806 supplement to that work, "On the Relation of the Real and the Ideal," this synthetic relation becomes the Band, the Dritte, enacting the identity or indifference of the real and ideal that makes each a potence of absolute. In the Ideen Schelling had claimed that "in resolving the problem of how matter in general is originally possi ble, the problem of a possible universe has also been solved" (Ideen 187). In his 180j supplement to the construction of matter in the Ideas, Schelling argued that "matter is the general seed-corn [Samenkorn] of the universe, in which is hidden all that unfolds in later developments." Or, as he argued in 1799, in each natural product lies "the germ [Keim] of a universe" (Ideen [1803] 223?24; Einleitung 290?91). As Friedrich Schlegel made his similar point: "Aren't all systems individuals just as all individuals are systems at least in embryo and tendency?" (Philosophical Fragments AF 242). Gasche's reading of Benjamin's reading of the Jena Romantics, in his es say "On the Sober Absolute: On Benjamin and the Early Romantics," finds in Benjamin's marginal comments and notes the extent to which he was disturbed by Schlegel's suggestion. By his failure to pay attention to the difference between the absolute and individuality Benjamin contended that Schlegel illegitimately mixed levels of thought. Dissolving the single work of art into the medium of reflection not only renders the finite absolute, it also relates the absolute to the finite, to the tangible and profane. Not only is the absolute the basis for the potentiation of the individual work of art, it is also thus opened to the possibility of abasement. The absolute is tainted by lower forms, the infinite by the terrible signature of nature and fate.51 Benjamin might have been even more disturbed if he had read Schelling, with his explicit discussion of not only potentiation but also depotentiation, of not only how everything which appears to us as particu lar has its essence in the absolute as pure identity but also how the absolute "expands itself into the particular, so that in the absolute embodiment [Einbildung] of its infinity into the finite itself, it may take back the latter into itself, and in it both are One act" (Ideen [1803] 65). The absolute informs each real and ideal product, providing the basis for its identity, the basis for its potency, and yet to be this basis, in Schelling's disconcerting formulation, the absolute cannot be unitary, but must retain some aspect of both the real and the ideal, even if indifferently, within itself. The absolute, the infinite, is in some sense informed by the finite. 51. Rodolphe Gasche, "The Sober Absolute: On Benjamin and the Early Romantics," SiR 31 (Winter 1992): 433-53.</page><page sequence="31">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 575 Indeed, Hegel's criticism of Fichte's science of knowledge, that the iden tity of the I's activity can be grasped in philosophical reflection only by first sundering it into oppositions, applies as forcefully to Schelling's attempts to characterize absolute identity or God. The absolute ... is necessarily pure identity; it is just absoluteness and nothing other, and absoluteness is only equal to itself: but it does in deed also belong to the idea of that, that this pure identity, independ ent of subjectivity and objectivity, as this, is itself matter and form, subject and object. (Ideen [1803] 62) As Michael Vater has argued: Schelling is forced by his logic of indifference to forego any positive metaphysical characterization of the absolute. In essence, the absolute is the 'neither . . . nor . . .' of all contrasting predicates, in form their 'both . . . and . . .' It hardly needs mention that the coexistence of both aspects is formally a paradox. If the absolute can be indicated at all, it is solely in terms of logical relations, not in terms of metaphysical predicates. (Vater, "Introduction" 29) The further Schelling pursued the paradoxical play between identity and difference in his impossible logic of indifference, the more it defied positive conceptualization. Constrained to express himself with the concepts of ra tional philosophy, within the language of dualistic metaphysics, even as he attempted to overthrow them, Schelling tried to express what cannot be expressed in such language?neither simply identity nor difference, but somehow both at once. Even the metaphors to which he turned in articu lating the construction of nature or the construction of art?formative im pulse, Dritte, striving, daemon?dissolve as Schelling retreated further into the purified logic of indifference. Fichte's abstraction of the being of the I into the synthetic activity of thought is now further abstracted so that only a copula, a Band, remains, which Schelling denied can even be conceived as a synthetic relation of the real and the ideal, but must rather somehow be conceived as their indifference. The result is an absence of being at the heart of all real and ideal being, an abtruse band that extends even into the absolute, an abstract identity with no content. In Schelling's philosophy of identity the notion of rupture has become fundamental. Schelling's pene trating critical examination of contemporary philosophical systems, from philosophies of nature to transcendental idealism, ended in his own attempt at a complete system of philosophy, his philosophy of identity, but in which his critical principles prevented him from founding that system through the presence of some being. It thus remained an epistemology of rupture, a philosophy in which there remains an indifference, an identity</page><page sequence="32">576 JOAN STEIGERWALD yet difference, in every potency of the ideal and the real and in the absolute itself, a rupture that can only be traversed through a purely abstract notion of a copula or Band. It is for this reason that Schelling would describe his philosophy of identity as a negative philosophy. And it was for this reason that Hegel criticized Schelling's philosophy of identity as empty formalism. From God to Ground to Ungrund: The Elusiveness of Being The years following Schelling's sojourn in Jena were marked by a series of losses. The community of early romantic writers and critics who had been gathering at the home of August Wilhelm and Caroline Schlegel began to fragment in the first years of the nineteenth century. A growing tension within the group was the love affair developing between Schelling and Caroline Schlegel. August Wilhelm behaved with extraordinary forbear ance during this affair, but early in 1801 he departed for Berlin. Novalis, af ter a period of increasing illness, died in 1801. Friedrich Schlegel, having failed to get a position at the university, left Jena in 1802, travelling first to Paris, then Cologne, and eventually settling in Vienna. Fichte had been dismissed from the university in 1799 under charges of atheism and was now in Berlin. When Schelling left Jena in 1803 to take up an invitation to teach at the University of Wiirzburg, he left under a cloud of scandal. He had originally planned to go to Berlin in 1800 to further his medical stud ies, but he changed his plans because Caroline had become ill, and he in stead travelled with her to Bamburg for treatment. Then Caroline's daugh ter, Auguste, became very ill and died suddenly in July. Schelling, who had arranged Auguste's treatment with the local doctors, was accused of culpa bility in her death in an anonymous pamphlet attacking the "new philoso phy" written in the summer of 1802 by a Wiirzburg theologian Franz Berg; an obscure pamphlet that achieved prominence by being reviewed in the Jena Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung.52 After the Napoleonic invasions of 1806, Schelling sought refuge from the embattled north in Munich together with a small group of followers of his Naturphilosophie. In 1807 Schelling's preco cious philosophical stardom was eclipsed by the appearance of Hegel's formidable The Phenomenology of Spirit. Then in 1809 Caroline died. Throughout these years of personal losses, of personal crises, Schelling struggled to bring his identity philosophy to completion. But the Philosoph ical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom that he published in 1809, his last major published work, appears rather to demonstrate the impossibility 52. On this incident see Urban Wiesing, "Der Tod der Auguste Bohmer: Chronik eines medizinischen Skandals, seine Hintergriinde und seine historische Bedeutung," History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences n (1989): 275?95; and Werner E. Gerabek, Friedrich Wilhelm Jo seph Schelling und die Medizin der Romantik: Studien zu Schellings Wurzburger Periode (New York: Peter Lang, 1995) 105-11.</page><page sequence="33">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 577 of that task. God, the absolute principle in his identity philosophy, is given prominence in the Freedom essay, but in a complex yet necessary relation to God's revelation, to created nature and to the human individual and his freedom, and to God's own ground, in a way that elaborates and further problematizes the identity and difference of the infinite and the finite, the ideal and the real, freedom and necessity. The Freedom essay, ostensibly concerned with the problem of the appar ent contradiction between the concept of freedom and the concept of sys tem?how freedom is possible in connection with the conception of a scientific order of the world or with the system present at least in divine understanding?in fact rehearsed a theme found throughout the varied permutations of Schelling's philosophy, the significance of the real, the im port of nature, and the inadequacy of idealism due to its "abhorrence [Abscheu] of everything real" (Philosophische Untersuchungen iiber das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit, SW 7: 356). As Schelling argued in the Freedom es say, idealism treats freedom as the mastery of the spirit over the sensory, of reason over desires, and thus as the freedom from nature and natural neces sity. Its conception of freedom is accordingly merely empty formalism. By the dissolution of all being into the idea, idealism becomes groundless; as nature does not exist for it, idealism lacks a living ground. Schelling, in contrast, sought the real ground of freedom. But the concern of the Free dom essay was not nature as the system of the real, it was not how freedom is the fundamental potentiating act through which nature raises itself to in tellect and will, the being of nature in its various stages as the coming to be of human freedom, the object of his Naturphilosophie. Rather, its concern was nature in the ideal, the real as the ground and means for idealism to ac tualize itself and assume flesh and blood. Yet Schelling argued that the two concerns?the nature [Wesen] of nature [Natur] and the nature of free dom?are not unrelated. Indeed, he found it curious that whilst in the Cri tique of Practical Reason Kant treated freedom and independence of time as correlative concepts, and in the Critique of Pure Reason distinguished things-in-themselves from appearances through their independence of time, Kant did not think "to transfer this sole possible positive concept of in-itself [An-sich] to things," and to make freedom part of the conception of in-itself in general (Freiheit 352, 356). As Heidegger articulates Schelling's argument in his commentary on the Freedom essay, "where na ture is understood, not as what is merely to be overcome, but as what is constitutive [Mitbestimmende], then it joins in a higher unity with freedom" (Heidegger, Schelling 145). Having established the real ground or nature of freedom as the central problem of his essay, Schelling proceeded to use a basic principle of Natur philosophie, the distinction between being [Wesen] insofar as it exists and be</page><page sequence="34">578 JOAN STEIGERWALD ing insofar as it is the ground of existence, to understand freedom and to understand the nature of God and the relationship of God to nature as the foundation of a system of freedom or of the understanding of the concept of freedom in connection with the concept of system. Schelling thus began the main body of his essay with a discussion of the ground or nature of God. This ground of his existence, which God has within himself, is not God absolutely considered, i.e. insofar as he exists; for it is only the ground of his existence, it is nature [Natur]?in God; a being [Wesen] actually inseparable from him, yet still distinguished from him. (Freiheit 358) Ground, nature, being, essence [Grund, Natur, Wesen]?these are terms with which Schelling attempted to indicate the real in God as the founda tion of God. But as he elaborated on his meaning, it only became more elusive. As the incomprehensible basis of reality in things, the ground of God cannot be resolved in understanding, and yet it is that from which un derstanding is born. It is the striving for the self-revelation of God, but a striving, a longing without understanding, an unruly ground that always al ready threatens to break through, even once brought to order, thus making it appear as though order and form are not original. It is the positive pres ence that cannot be penetrated, the dark ground, without which God and the whole of creation could not exist, could have no reality. It is the neces sary inheritance, the indivisible remainder, of being. As if to compound ambiguity with ambiguity, Schelling argued that although the ground of God has precedence over the existence of God, in some sense acting as its basis, this precedence does not constitute a priority in time or a priority in essence. "Since nothing is before or outside God, he must have the ground of his existence within himself." "God has within himself an inner ground of his existence, which in this respect precedes him as to his existence; but likewise God is prior to the ground, as the ground, as such, could not be if God did not exist in actuality" (Freiheit 358). It is the same paradoxical logic that Schelling utilized in his identity philosophy in characterizing God. David Clark highlights the problematic nature of Schelling's "strange and self-estranged God": Neither 'inseparable' nor 'distinguishable,' but both at once: this Grund, this 'irreducible remainder' . . . shimmers before our gaze, simultaneously there, distinct from God, and not there, [a] spectral presence/absence . . . How can God be divided by a difference that does not differentiate, his determined identity deferred by the 'irre</page><page sequence="35">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 579 ducible remainder' that makes it possible? (" 'The Necessary Heritage of Darkness'" 87) Schelling struggled with the limits of philosophical language of his time to articulate thinking that violated its categories. At first he turned to the language of Naturphilosophie, to Kant's philosophy of the organism that informed On the World Soul, in which "all things mutually presuppose each other" or are cause and effect of each other. "In the circle out of which all things become, it is not a contradiction that what produces one thing is itself generated by it" (Freiheit 358). God might be better understood, Schelling suggested, through this notion of becoming. God's existence comes to be from his ground; but this ground is the cause as well as the ef fect of God's existence, so that what God is is best understood as this relation of becoming, as the formative process linking ground and exis tence. As Heidegger elaborates this notion, "the Being of God is a becom ing to himself out of himself." But it is the "not-yet-existing [Nochnicht existente]" of the ground that ultimately, and positively, makes existence possible; the "not-yet for itself" is that from which that which emerges from itself begins (Heidegger, Schelling 195-96). Schelling tried again; re maining within the language of Naturphilosophie, he now expressed the relationship between the ground and the existence of God through an analogy with the interplay between gravity and light. Gravity, as the abso lute identity viewed in a specific potency, precedes light as its eternally dark ground, but does not exist in actuality itself. Schelling here referred to his more detailed discussion of the relationship between gravity and light in his Journal for Speculative Physics, but his discussion elided between the scientific and the metaphorical or mythical. Gravity, as the dark ground, "flees into the night when light (the existing) dawns" (Freiheit 358). The dark, unruly ground, like a surging sea or Plato's matter, incapable of forming some thing lasting in itself, requires the eternal act of God's self-revelation to bring rulelessness to order. Schelling's language was that of the Protestant mystics to whom he had been introduced as a youth growing up near Stuttgart and who he began to read seriously around 1804?Schwabenvater, such as Friedrich Oetinger, and the seventeenth-century theosophist Jacob Bohme?as well as Plato's mythical theogony and cosmogony in the Timaeus.53 Schelling then tried yet again. The being of God might be 53- See Clark, "'Necessary Heritage of Darkness'" 88?100; Werner Marx, Schelling: Geschichte, System, Freiheit (Munich: Alber, 1977) 106?9; and Robert Brown, The Later Phi losophy of Schelling: The Influence ofBohme on the Works ofi8og-i8i5 (London: Associated Uni versity Press, 1977). On the historical background to this protestant mysticism, see S. R.

The ground of God is "the longing felt by the eternal one to give birth to itself" (Freiheit 358). But too sophisticated a philosopher to linger long with a simplistic idiom of personification, Schelling immediately translated the notion of God's long ing for existence into the language of Fichte's 1796/99 lectures on the Wissenschaftslehre, tracing the production of determinate representation from indeterminate striving. Schelling, like Fichte, conceived longing or willing as a kind of thinking: as "a will of the understanding, namely its longing and desire; not a conscious, but a prescient willing, whose pre science is understanding" (Freiheit 359). It is a striving to understanding, aroused by understanding, but not yet determinate understanding. Schelling presented the actualization or self-revelation of God as a reflexive representation engendered within God, as a counterpart to the indetermi nate longing, through which God beholds himself in his own image, hav ing no other object but himself. This self-reflexive act is analogous to that in human thought, through which unconscious and indefinite longing is raised by understanding into the unity of an idea, imagined into something comprehensible, singular, determinate. In Fichte's terms, the I determines itself, the activity of the intellect becomes aware of itself, by becoming an image for itself ([Wissenschaftslehre] Nova Methodo 151?52). Yet Schelling lit tered this detour into the language of transcendental idealism, as he did that into the language of Naturphilosophie, with obfuscating metaphors. "All birth is birth from darkness into light. . . . The human being is formed in the womb, and from the darkness of non-understanding (from feeling, longing, the glorious mother of knowledge) lucid thoughts first grow." This representation is "the word of this longing"?"in the sense that one says: the word of [the solution to] a riddle"?the resolution of obscure longing into meaning. The eternal spirit utters the word, as understanding combined with longing, and "becomes freely creating and omnipotent will and informs the initially ruleless nature" (Freiheit 360-61). In a few packed pages, in a disturbing confusion of tongues, Schelling strove to articulate the being of God. What Schelling did manage to convey is that the only way for us to con ceive of God is through his others. Schelling argued that the "consequence [Folge] of things from God is God's self-revelation" (Freiheit 347). Thus the actualization of God, the transformation from ground to existence, from indeterminate longing to representation or self-revelation, is the act of cre ation, through which the unruly ground or nature becomes the natural world ordered in a series of potencies culminating in human nature. To consider the nature of things is to consider them in relation to God, to consider the becoming of things from God or the process of creation. But</page><page sequence="37">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 581 to understand the nature of things as becoming is to understand them as presenting the stages and manner of emergence of divine being into exis tence. Thus things reveal the being of God. Moreover, if things become in and through God, they are also different from God, for things become in that in God which is not God himself, that is, in the ground in God (Heidegger, Schelling 201-5, 212-14). Schelling's argument here is provoca tive. "The process of creation comes to light only in the inner transmuta tion or transfiguration of the initially dark principle" (Freiheit 362). This dark principle which originates in the ground is the created being's self will; to the extent to which it is not raised to or does not grasp its unity with light, the principle of understanding, it is a blind craving. Opposed to the self-will of the creature is the universal will?understanding, light, what brings unruly craving to order. Each singular being comes to be from both. But it is the ground in God, that nature which is distinct if insepara ble from him, which becomes the basis for the separate nature of created beings, a self-craving that stands against the universal will of understanding to order and unity. The implications of Schelling's argument are only fully realized in the case of human beings. In human beings the deepest point of initial darkness is transfigured completely into light in one being?in them are the whole power of the principle of darkness and the principle of light, "the deepest abyss and highest heaven" (Freiheit 363). Like all natural beings, human be ings arise from the ground, and thus have within them a principle inde pendent of God. But in human beings the word is completely articulate; only in human beings is the image of God, which God first beheld in his own longing, apprehended and brought to light, and the becoming of na ture brought to rest. The unique consonance of principles in human beings elevates them above other creatures as spirit, and enables human selfhood to act freely in accord or in discord with universal will. This freedom is the condition of the possibility of evil; evil is the proclamation of self-will above universal will. As Heidegger presents Schelling's contention, evil consists in "a reversal of the unity of the divine world in which the univer sal will stands in harmony with the will of the ground" and thus the be coming of a "reversed god [umgekehrten Gottes], of the counter spirit [Gegengeistes]," in which "the ground elevates itself into existence and puts itself in the place of existence" (Heidegger, Schelling 246-48). As Slavoj Zizek notes, with "speculative audacity . . . Schelling locates the split which opens up the possibility of Evil in God Himself."54 Evil has its ground in the ground within yet independent of God, in the primal will 54- Slavoj Zizek, The Indivisible Remainder: An Essay on Schelling and Related Matters (New York: Verso, 1996) 61.</page><page sequence="38">582 JOAN STEIGERWALD that has emerged to separate selfhood. Since "every being can be revealed only in its opposite," there must be an other for God. This other is the human being; the human being is necessary for God to be revealed. But the revelation of the existing God as the free human being is at the same time the condition for the possibility of evil. Thus evil is "necessary for the revelation of God" (Freiheit 373). It seems that Schelling's appeal to Naturphilosophie and transcendental idealism was not just analogical. Since God is only revealed, only exists, in his creation, the being of God can only be known through his creation. In Schelling's Naturphilosophie the opposition in natural beings between dark and light principles, between the real and the ideal, is what gives them activity and life, their existence as real living entities, in contrast to the deadly abstractions of idealism. In the Freedom essay, Schelling argued that God too is "a life." The unity of ground and existence in God is a neces sary unity, but Schelling insisted it could not be conceived as a logical ne cessity; rather God is "the living unity of forces" (Freiheit 399, 394-95). As Clark argues, "God's being is primordialfy a conflictual site . . . that is con stituted rather than compromised by otherness" (" 'Necessary Heritage of Darkness'" 89). As in his identity philosophy, in his Freedom essay Schelling appears to have collapsed the distinction between divine and created life, the infinite and finite. But not only is God thus "incorporated" (" 'Neces sary Heritage . . .'" 86, 109-11) there is also an element of the ground of God, that basis of freedom, in all of nature. This dark ground, as an unruly or irrational principle, resistant to light, understanding, unity and order, like Plato's matter, is the basis for dissonance and contingency in nature. This unruly ground can never be fully overcome; the human being never attains complete control over this condition, and even in God it remains relatively independent, although God is able integrate it into himself (Freiheit 399). If this ground of freedom only rises to evil in human self hood, in other natural beings, such as organic being, it provides the basis for varied formations and deformations (Freiheit 250-52). Freedom for Schelling is thus not found in the triumph of the ideal over natural neces sity, as he portrayed his idealistic predecessors, but in the dark, unruly, real basis of nature.55 Nature thus "by no means exists through the capa city of mere geometric necessity; not sheer, pure reason, but personality and spirit are in nature (just as we distinguish between the rational and ingenious [geistreichen] author)" (Freiheit 395). In all of nature freedom, 55- Perhaps Schelling is not so far from his idealistic predecessors here as he claims. For Fichte, in his (Wissenschaftslehre) Nova Methodo (1796/99), also regarded freedom as based in the unconscious striving of the self, the real side of the self, as opposed to the conscious and ideal. And insofar as the not-I was a product of the I, it too constrained and concealed this el ement of the real striving of freedom.</page><page sequence="39">NATURE IN SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY 583 spirit and self-will is combined with the necessary in the formation of being. The distinction of ground and existence in all being, in God as well as his creatures, leaves the problem of their relation. Schelling began his essay by conceiving this relation in terms of becoming?the becoming of cre ation from God, the becoming of the existence of God from his ground. This becoming, in Heidegger's terms, is the joining of ground and exis tence, is the essence [Wesen] or jointure of Being [Seynsfuge], the in-itself of all being, what all being is (Heidegger, Schelling 185?90, 205?15). In the last few pages of his essay, Schelling returned to this central problem, and at tempted to articulate the being [Wesen] before all ground and all existence, before any distinction or duality?"how can we name it other than as the primal ground [Urgrund] or rather nonground [Ungrund]" (Freiheit 406). Preceding all oppositions, it is not the identity of opposites, or the product of opposites, but their indifference. Schelling appears at first to have ap pealed again to the paradoxical logic of his identity philosophy, the indif ference that is neither identity nor difference but the identity of identity and difference, the two principles predicated by the Ungrund as non opposites [Nichtgegensatzes], in disjunction and each for itself. But in these last pages of his Freedom essay, he pushes this impossible reasoning even fur ther, claiming that the Ungrund is "a being [Wesen] of its own, separated from all opposition, off which all oppositions rebound, which is nothing other than just their non-being [Nichtseyn], and which thus has no predi cate except lack of predicates, without therefore being nothingness [Nichts] or an absurdity [Unding]" (Freiheit 406). The ultimate essence, before or be hind even the ground and existence of God, the non-being beyond all dif ferentiated being and yet not nothing, this absolute that Schelling sought to make the positive essence of all, he could only negatively express as Ungrund. "About the Ungrund . . . nothing can be said. Or next to nothing, since, remarkably, he strains in the same sentence to make shades of nega tive discrimination where, strictly speaking, none should be possible." The Ungrund "is neither the void of nothingness or the nonsense of nonen tity"; it is "nothing but nothing" (" 'Necessary Heritage of Darkness'" 130). Clark here reads Schelling through Derrida: "How to avoid speaking (of the Ungrund)? That is, both "how not to speak?" and how, in speaking, "to avoid an inexact, erroneous, aberrant, improper form? How to avoid such a predicate, and even predication itself?"56 What Heidegger con ceived as the jointure of being becomes for Schelling an abyss of negativity 56.

A positive expression of being eluded Schelling once again. Indeed, no sooner had Schelling attempted to articulate what defies all positive expression, to think the unthinkable, then he appears to have conceded defeat, and concluded his Freedom essay with a retreat into the familiar vocabulary of idealism. Schelling surprisingly allowed that the du ality that comes to be in Ungrund, if at first becoming one in love as the combination of ground and existence, eventually resolves into an absolute duality, as all that is true and good in the ground or longing is raised to lu minous consciousness and all that is false and impure in the ground is eter nally locked in darkness to remain "as the caput mortum of its life process." The duality that he had just denied as a predication of the Ungrund now becomes its end. The one essence of all finally divides itself into two, into the purely ideal and the excluded, expelled ground. The ground continues to exist, but not to act, as an irreducible remainder, debased now to eternal excrement (Freiheit 408). Then, as if himself shocked at what he had written, in the last lines of his Freedom essay Schelling turned back once more to nature, that unartic ulated presence that portends all. We have an older revelation than any written one?nature. It contains the prototypes [Vorbilder] that no human being has yet interpreted, whereas those of the written ones have long received their fulfilment and interpretation. The sole true system of religion and science would appear, if the understanding of this unwritten revelation were dis closed, not in the wretched state pieced together out of a few philo sophical and critical concepts, but appearing at once in the full radi ance of truth and nature.
