<plain_text><page sequence="1">Saying but Little: Malory and the Suggestion of Emotion PETER R. SCHROEDER When he shows a character saying 'but lyryll,' Malory suggests a more complex emotion than he does through his usual emotional displays. (PRS) In the opening scene of his Arthurian saga, after twice telling us that Uther Pendragon is 'wonderly wroth' at the sodeyne departyng' of the Duke of Cornwall and his wife and their refusal to return to Uther s court,1 Malory goes on to show Uther falling sick Tor pure angre and for grete love of fayr Igrayne' (1.8). Uther himself is quite aware that his immoderate emotions have caused his sickness: 'I am seke for angre and for love of fayre Igrayne, that I may not be hoof (1:8). In the following pages, characters are constantly making great dole, or sorrow, or joy?make' suggesting an indissoluble link between emotion and manifestation. When they swoon, or weep, as they often do, Malory generally makes clear why: '[t]han for verry pure joy La Beali Isode sowned' (2:492); Tristram made such sorow that he felle downe of hys horse in a sowne (2:495); Arthur 's?nke downe in a sowghe for gladnesse' (1:358). At times the response is more idiosyncratic. When the host of thirty thousand knights Tounde the fyve kynges dede they made such dole that they felle downe of there horsis' (1:129) and are then hacked to bits, in a scene worthy of Monty Python; whan [Lancelot] wyste the entente of the letter he was so wrothe that he layde hym downe on his bed to siepe' (2:617). But even here the general pattern holds: a strong, well-defined emotion (pure anger, pure joy) leading clearly to a dramatic result. Most readers would probably agree that this is Malory's normal way of depicting his characters' emotions. The emotions themselves seem to be bright, flat, and simple, like unshaded patches of primary colors in a painting. Uther, for example, may suffer simultaneously from love and anger, but the two remain separate emotions, not some complex hybrid of the two. My interest here is in Malory's deviations from this normal practice. When he gives us a dramatic emotional effect without providing a clearly-defined emotional cause, or when he provides us with what seems to be an emotional 43 ARTH U RI AN A 11.2 (200l)</page><page sequence="2">44 ARTHURIANA cause and then withholds the dramatic effect, the reader senses that something is out of the ordinary and tries to explain why. And this readerly involvement in itself leads to an uncharacteristic sense of emotional shading, nuance, and complexity. Malory achieves this effect in a number of ways. One is by providing an explanation which leaves the emotional waters muddied. Thus, after Lancelot, the quintessential knight in shining armor, has ridden out of the forest to save the queen from Sir Mador's murder accusation, evermore the quene behylde sir Launcelot, and wepte so tendirly that she s?nke allmoste to the grownde for sorow that he had done to her so grete kyndenes where she shewed hym grete unkyndenesse (2:1058-9). What exactly causes her tears? Sorrow, yes; but Malory's own explanation complicates this sorrow. It's not really the kind of straightforward, unalloyed dole that so many characters make out of measure: after all, Guinevere is glad to see Lancelot, relieved to be exonerated, and at the same time regretful that she has showed him such 'unkyndenesse.' So here we have an emotion that really doesn't seem like a flat, primary color: it's too nuanced, too complex. Later, Lancelot inspires similarly complex tears in Arthur, after intervening to re-horse the king in the midst of their battle: 'So whan kynge Arthur was on horsebak he loked on sir Launcelot; than the teerys braste oute of hys yen, thynkyng of the grete curtesy that was in sir Launcelot more than in ony other man' (3:1192). Instead of giving us an explicit cause for Arthur's tears, Malory links them to Arthur's thoughts: somehow, thinking of Lancelot's superlative courtesy makes Arthur weep. We can understand this, I suspect: like so many of the tears in this extremely lachrymose section of the tale, these seem to be lachrymae rerum, tears of general sadness for the horrible way things have turned out. But this is a much more shaded, nuanced emotion than the flat, simple grief or joy that we find elsewhere. Then there are reactions for which Malory omits any explanation. When Morgawse, Sir Gareth's mother, 'saw sir Gareth redyly in the visage she myght nat wepe, but sodeynly felle downe in a sowne and lay there a grete whyle lyke as she had bene dede' (1:358). We may assume that she swoons because she is overcome with joy at seeing her son, but the explanation is ours, not Malory's. A more complex example involves the mutual recognition of Tristram and Isoud, after Tristram's extended spate of lunacy. At first Isoud has only a dim sense that 'I shulde have sene thys man here before in many placis,' but Tristram, recognizing her immediately, 'turned away hys vysage and wepte' (2:501). At this point, Malory greatly expands a brief and</page><page sequence="3">SAYING BUT LITTLE 45 undramatic reference in the French to a little dog that Tristram had earlier given Isoud: And anone thys lityll br?chet feite a savoure of sir Trystram. He lepte uppon hym and lycked hys learys and hys earys, and than he whyned and quested, and she smelled at hys feete and at hys hondis and on all the partyes of hys body that she myght com to. A, my lady!' seyde dame Brangwayne, Alas! I se hit ys myne owne lorde sir Trystramys.' And thereuppon La Beali Isode felle downe in a sowne and so lay a grete whyle. (2:501-2)2 Strong emotions clearly lie behind Tristram's tears and Isoud's swoon, but we sense that the emotions are too complex to be summed up by one simple label: joy, regret, relief. The brachet's reaction follows the same pattern. Most of us probably take the naively anthropomorphic view that she is glad to see Tristram. But Malory doesn't tell us this. He just shows us this eager little dog so vividly that he more or less compels us to imagine some emotion? something unseen and inward?that gives rise to the dog's behavior. And so he does with human beings. I'll pass by the many other instances of unexplained weeping and swooning and turn at last to my ostensible topic: silence, or what I'll call marked silence,' in which Malory calls attention to a character's failure to say as much as we'd expect the character to say. Such silences almost always produce gaps, or, in Gricean terms, examples of implicature, which the reader must interpret.3 Again, Malory varies in the degree of assistance he gives to our interpretations. Since antiquity, literature has recognized that passion is often speechless. When Virgil's love-struck Dido, giving Aeneas a tour of Carthage, must break off her spiel in mid-voice [mediaque in voce resistiti, pious Aeneas must be about the only person too obtuse to guess what causes this sudden silence.4 At times, Malory saves us guesswork: 'But whan La Beali Isode saw sir Palomydes she chaunged than her coloures; for wrathe she myght nat speake' (2:755). Here Isoud's pure, clearly-motivated wrath at Palomides causes her speechlessness. But we don't need to rise to lofty Virgil to find causal connections getting blurred. Here, from one of Malory's sources, the stanzaic Morte Arthur, is Lancelot's glum reaction to the Queen's poignant speech, after the Maid of Astolat episode:</page><page sequence="4">46 ARTHURIANA Lancelot full still then stood; His herte was hevy as any stone.5 The lines imply that grief renders him silenr, but since effecr and emotion are simply juxtaposed, the reader must make the causal link, and in the process may well add some depth and shading to that simple grief And at times, more mysteriously, we may sense that an explicitly-labeled emotion may not be the cause of a marked silence. Thus when the holy hermit, Sir Baudwin of Britain, finds that Lancelot has reopened his wound by rashly exerring himself on his horse, 'he seyde but lityll, but wyte you well he was wroth' (2:1086). Here the connection is presented as oppositional rather than causal: Baudwin is silent in spite ofhis anger. In this case the silence leaves a much wider gap for the reader to fill in. At whom, we ask, is he angry? At Lancelot, above all, and probably at Bors and Lavaine for colluding in the scheme to get Baudwin and Elaine out of the way by sending them to gather herbs. But Lancelot is the one who has suffered from this reckless disobedience, and no one can be more eager to see him recovered than Lavaine and Bors. So what could be gained by an explosion of anger? Where Isoud's anger renders her speechless, Baudwin's speechlessness (we gather) results from deliberately suppressing his anger. And where an explicit dramatization of Baudwin's anger would have given us another bright flat patch of primary color, the silence introduces a hint of depth and shading into the picture: more is going on here than meets the eye. Less direct still is the linking of a marked silence wirh a vague indicarion that, in essence, more is going on than meets the eye. Another example from earlier popular romance is the scene from Sir Tryamowre in which the evil Sir Marrok goth forth and holdyth his pese,/ More he thenkyth than he says,' after he has been rebuffed in his attempt to seduce the Queen of Aragon.6 Here his muteness, coupled with the unspoken and undefined thought, conveys a sense of menace amply borne out by his subsequent vengeful plotting. Malory, too, sometimes suggests that hiding one's emotions can be a symptom of general duplicity: 'But whan quene Morgan wyste that Accolon was dede, she was so sorowfull that nye hir herte to-braste, but bycause she wolde nat hit were knowyn oute, she kepte hir countenaunce and made no sembelaunte of dole' (1:149-50). Morgan's subordination of passion to prudence here hints (if we needed a hint) at her moral unsoundness. Having just pled temporary diabolical possession when her son caught her trying to kill her husband, she knows it would be unwise to make too much fuss about the death of her paramour. Similarly King Mark, another exemplar</page><page sequence="5">SAYING BUT LITTLE 47 of false-seeming, annoyed at Tristram's growing power, 'smote downe hys hede, and in hys harte he feryd sore that sir Trystram sholde gete hym such worship in the realme of Logrys wherethorow hymselff shuld nat be able to withstonde hym' (2:545). Smiting down one's head, here and elsewhere in Malory, becomes a dramatic manifestation of wordless frustration. And we have already had our attention explicitly called to the gap between outer civility and inward animosity in the Mark-Tristram relationship: as longe as kynge Marke lyved he loved never aftir sir Trystramys. So aftir that, thoughe there were fayre speche, love was there none' (1:396). F aux-semblants?hypocrites who hide their inner evil under a fair appearance?are medieval staples. But in Malory, such dissimulation need not be a sign of depravity. Thus, as Malory makes clear, the visit of Elaine (daughter of Pelles; mother of Galahad) to Camelot puts a number of interesting strains on the civil veneer of Arthur's court. Lancelot, from a mixture of shame and guilt, refuses to speak to her, even though he thinks that she is 'the fayrest woman that ever he sye in his lyeff dayes' (2:803). Thus snubbed, Elaine 'was so hevy she wente her harte wolde have tobraste' (2:803). Guinevere, too, must mask her true feelings: 'whan dame Eleyne was brought unto the quene aythir made other goode chere as by countenaunce, but nothynge wyth there hartes' (2:803). A great deal of dissembling is going on, but we are unlikely to see this as a sign of some moral flaw in the characters. Guinevere and Elaine dislike each other, true, but they are simply following the code of Miss Manners rather than Marianne Dashwood in responding to a difficult social situation. And what of Tristram? He loathes Mark, but he too participates in the necessary social charade. And?while obviously one of the noblest and most admirable of Malory's knights?he is by no means a transparent character. Thus, in an interesting echo of the Tryamowre formula, as Tristram (incognito, as usual) listens to the abuse hurled by Kay, Braundiles, and Torre against Cornish knights, 'Sir Trystramys harde all that they seyde, and seyde but lytyll, but he thought the more' (2:488). What does he think? We need to fill in what Malory leaves unspoken, but we are likely to suspect that his thoughts are not too warm and friendly: as a Cornish knight, Tristram has already indicated his impatience with Kay's anti-Cornish slurs. In this case, though, the implied menace seems to lead nowhere: after smiting down Torre and Brandiles in a rather perfunctory joust, and avoiding the companionship of Kay, Tristram reveals his identity to them, humbly declines their offer to become a knight of the Round Table, and, after a long chat, parts from them on apparently amicable terms.</page><page sequence="6">48 ARTHURIANA Yet even so Tristram's silence tempts us to question appearances. Although Tristram may be annoyed, he has enough self-control not to fly off the handle: the passage, that is, suggests something about Tristram s character, something perhaps supported elsewhere by his willingness to maintain a civil relationship with King Mark, or endure the abuse of Palomides: every day sir Palomydes wolde repreve sir Trystram of olde hare berwyxr them, and ever sir Trystram spake fayre and seyde lytyll' (2:540). And his unstated thoughts may also cast a kind of shadow over the subsequent scene. He claims that his refusal to join 'the felyship of the Rounde Table' is based on his own sense of unworthiness: 'I was never yet of such dedys of worthynes to be in the companye of such a felyship' (2:489). But, in the context, we might hear a certain irony in his words. Tristram's 'worthynes,' after all, has been established clearly: that is why King Arthur's knighrs are seeking him so eagerly. On Malory's usual scale of knightly merit he is certainly superior to these three representatives of the Arthurian fellowship. And elsewhere Tristram shows himself capable of both biting snideness and sudden outbursts of bitterness.7 In these examples, Malory makes clear that his characters' silence masks some sorr of unspoken emotion. But at times the silence alone alerts the reader that a gap needs to be filled in. Context, of course, often relieves the reader of much guesswork. Thus in Ipomedon A, one of the most silence filled of the Middle English romances, Ipomedon has mutely loved the Fere of Calabria for three years. When he presents her with a gift of seven huge deer heads, she is struck dumb: 'In a stodye fui stylle she stode.'8 What are we to make of her 'study ? Is she warming to him? Is she appalled at those deer heads? The text does little to constrain our interpretation. A bit later, though, as she observes his own preoccupied silence, she smiles, and this smile is likely to strike us as a sign of hope for Ipomedon. From their frequency in popular romances, we can suspect that such pregnant silences had become a kind of formula in Middle English lirerature: something is unsaid, thus something needs filling in. Malory seems to have found this formula convenient for situations where the emotions themselves are more tangled and complex than the usual unalloyed anger, grief, joy, or love. Thus, when the relentlessly abusive Damosel Maledisant learns that her knight, La Cote Male Tayle, has been a huge success at the Castell Orgulous, 'she smote downe the hede and seyde but lytyll' (2:466). Why? Sir Mordred?cast against type, here, as an avuncular dispenser of knightly lore?clearly regards her response as another petulant rebuke. But her sudden silence hints more than mere petulance or vexation, and in its openendedness it may foreshadow her eventual explanation that she 'rebuked hym never for</page><page sequence="7">SAYING BUT LITTLE 49 none hate that I hated hym, but for grete love that I had to hym' (2:471). In dramatizing her reaction, then, Malory suggests a much more complex set of emotions than King Uther s earlier pure angre and grete love/ The messy triangle of Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and La Beale Isoud produces even more complicated emotions. Palomides, though in most respects an admirable knight, would probably rank high on anyone's list of Malory Characters Most In Need of Psychological Intervention. In addition to his ill-explained reluctance to be baptized, his hopeless love for Isoud leads him to feel an oscillating mixture of hatred, jealousy, envy and respect for Tristram. At the Tournament of Lonazep he disguises himself in order to doublecross Tristram, then lies about what he has done, leaving Isoud (who has seen everything) speechless with rage, as we noted earlier. After Tristram, recognizing that this speechlessness needs to be explained, asks her what is wrong, she gives her eyewitness account, wondering how she can be expected to 'suffir in youre presence suche a f?lonne and traytoure as ys sir Palomydes' (2:755-6). Palomides repeats his self-exculpatory lie, and Tristram rather equivocally accepts this excuse. 'Than La Beali Isode hylde downe her hede and seyde no more at that tyme' (2:756). Up to this point, Malory has been quite explicit about Isoud's emotions: anger toward Palomides, concern about the welfare of Tristram. But how exactly are we to interpret her silence here? By taking' the excuse of Palomides, Tristram seems to call into question the truth of Isoud's own account and at the same time to declare an end to Palomides-bashing. Isoud's silence may thus imply a certain resentment directed at Tristram?akin, perhaps, to the hint of resentment we sometimes sense in Lancelot's later interchanges with Guinevere. What this does, of course, is again to muddy the pure primary colors of the simple emotions, and in the process to make them seem more 'realistic'?that is, to make us see these fabled ideal lovers as something more like actual human beings, capable of resentment, misunderstanding, and the like. The effect of the corresponding French passage is less complex and ambiguous. Thus the French Tristans words?'whatever he did, I pardon him, because I don't want to lose his company' [conment k'il onques le feist, je li pardon; pour cestui fait ne voeil je pas perdre sa compaingnie]?seem to accept Iseult's account and explain why he is willing to pardon Palomides anyway. And Iseult's silence?without that possibly petulant dramatic gesture 'hylde downe her hede'?is presented as simple acquiescence: 'when the queen understood the will of Sir Tristan, she shut up' [quant la roine entent la volente de monsigneur Tristan, eie sen taist].9 We are still free to imagine a</page><page sequence="8">50 ARTHURIANA touch of resentment here, but the French text does a lot less than Malory's to nudge us toward such an interpretation. And, as so often, Malory gains his effect by a process of addition and subtraction: he adds the dramatic gesture, while he cuts away the causal explanations. The result?as we saw with Tristram's dog?is that the reader is the more strongly drawn in to provide the explanations that Malory has omitted. In these examples, then, Malory calls our attention directly to the fact that a character has violated the Cooperative Principle of conversation by failing (in Gricean terms, again) to make an appropriate conversational contribution. This failure is more striking because these cases also violate Malory's own normal procedure of linking emotion to dramatic response. In each case, then, we are more or less directed to find a reason for this failure: to fill in the gap with our own interpretation. And in most of these cases the context suggests that our own interpretation should involve a mixture of emotions rather than a single pure example of anger, grief, love, or joy. By this suggestion of emotion, Malory thus adds a kind of shading and ambiguity to his otherwise bright, clearly-defined picture. To 'say but little,' then, becomes one of the formulas by which Malory alerts us to the surface inadequacy of a character's response. I will conclude by linking this formula to a less explicit but more pervasive feature in Malory: the laconic quality that many readers have noted in Malory's dialogue. According to Mark Lambert, although this dialogue can be vivid it is neither individually varied nor psychologically revealing.10 But at times, at least, the laconism seems to be a dramatization of 'saying but little.' In such cases, that is, Malory would seem to intend us to recognize that the words themselves are inadequate, and to take this as a signal (akin to the signal provided by his formula) that more is being suggested than is being articulated. A single example will have to serve. During the Grail quest, Gawain encounters a hermit who rebukes him for having 'lyved myschevously many wyntirs' (2:891) and tells him he must do penance for his sins. Gawain demurs, saying?in the French version, conveniently noted by Vinaver?'that he would not be able to suffer the pain of penance, and the good man said no more, for he saw that it would be a waste of effort to admonish him' [et cil dist que de penitance faire ne pourroit il la painne souffrir, et le preudons le laisse a tant que plus ne li dist car il voit bien que de lui amonnester seroit painne perdu] (3:1552). Malory expa*ids and dramatizes this scene: 'Sir, what penaunce shall I do?' 'Such as I woll gyff the,' seyde the good man.</page><page sequence="9">SAYING BUT LITTLE 51 'Nay/ seyd sir Gawayne, 'I may do no penaunce, for we knyghtes adventures many tymes suffir grete woo and payne.' 'Well/ seyde the good man, and than he hylde hys pece. (2:892) In effect, the French version tells us that the hermit 'said but little.' Malory translates this into a single word: well/ But, rather remarkably, that single word manages to suggest the weary what's the use' attitude set forth explicitly in the French. And this, I would suggest, is Malory's intention. That is, here (and elsewhere as well) Malory is moving from the explicit suggestiveness of the formulaic 'marked silence' (he 'seyde but lytyll, but he thought the more ) to a dramatization of that 'saying but little' in which the laconic utterance itself is designed to hint at some unspoken and generally complex emotion.
