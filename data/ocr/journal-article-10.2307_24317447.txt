<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FOUNTAIN AND ITS FORMS By Ma. de los Angeles De Las Vilas The Spanish fountain, as ¡ntroduced ¡n America, was predominately circular in form, and it may be that the latent religious symbolism of this shape, as well as its practicality, recommended the choice. The circle is the oculus of the early basílica, the opening toward heaven and the eye of God; it is the holy nimbus above the head of Christ and, in other religions, it is the sun, the source of all life. The European concept of the fountain was unknown in America before the arrivai of the Spaniards. Sahagún said, when writing of the Main Plaza: "Structure 68 was called Tozpalatl. This was a highly valued fountain which issued from the same spot, from here the rulers of the idols took water, and when they held the festival of Huitzilopochtli and other festivals, the common people drank from this fountain with great dévotion." The writings of Artemio de Valle Arizpe provide us with more infor mation: "This fountain was sealed after the Conquest, but there is evidence that in 1528 it was reopened by order of the Ayuntamiento, and it is not known, or at least I don't know, when or why it was closed. Fray Servando Teresa de Mier talks of a very abundant spring of good water that was found on opening the foundations of the cathedral and that was also sealed. I think it is the same that was found when building the crypt some years ago, the sealing of which required much work and cernent." The best known of the XVI-century Spanish fountains still in existence today are the Queen's Crown Fountain in Chiapa de Corzo, constructed before 1562, and the octagonal fountain in Tochimilco. The cisterns for the storage of water that had existed in pre-Hispanic times — a number may still be seen at Calixtlahuaca — became an inte gral part of such XVI-century fortress-monastery complexes as Tepeaca, Tepeapulco, Tecali, Ocuituco, Ucareo and Totolapan. San Martín Tepotzo tlán, of later construction, had cisterns in both the Patio of the Wells and in the kitchens. The central patio fountain served as the pivotai point for life in the household or religious community, while the exterior fountains in the plazas, at the terminais of aqueducts, on street corners and in other loca tions where the municipal government felt fhat they were necessary provided the inhabitants with daily water as well as with a meeting place where plots were hatched, romances flourished and news was exchanged. Wall fountains, such as are found in the Palace of the Counts de Santiago de Calimaya, the house of the Counts del Valle de Orizaba and the Hacienda de Goicoechea, were common on street corners and in résidences. Cristóbal de Villalpando's painting of Mexico City's Main Plaza in 1695 includes a beautiful octagonal fountain with two basins and a finely carved column topped by a bronze cross. Around the fountain, 82 da * f' \f o 5</page><page sequence="2">the seated Indians ¡n regional dress offer their merchandise to shoppers and passers-by. The ¡ndispensible water vendors who carne to the foun tain to flll their large ¡ugs often appear ¡n illustrations of Mexico City, even as late as the flrst decades of the XX century. In the provinces, they may still be seen, although the large ¡ugs, the chochólos — the ñame derived from the Náhuatl word for gushing of water — have been replaced by containers attached to a shoulder yolk. Villalpando's painting also shows in the center of the Parián another smaller fountain which, according to Dr. de la Maza, was an invention of the artist, as the Parián had been destroyed by fire and was being rebuilt at the time the paint ing was made. Of importance here, however, ¡s the fact that this painting shows a typical form of the XVII-century fountainn. In Spain, the Triton Fountain that until 1657 was part of the Jardín de la Isla de Aranjuez and today grâces the Campo de Moro ¡s, with its elabórate zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and vegetable forms, a good example of the complicated style created by Pedro Ribera, a follower of Charriguera. The Fountain of the Shells, also part of the Campo de Moro, was designed by Ventura Rodríguez and constructed by Francisco Gutiérrez and Manuel Alvarez. Made originally for the Palace of Bobadilla del Monte, ¡t was later part of the Jardines de Vista Alegre before being moved to its présent location. This work and the Apollo Fountain that was also designed by Rodríguez with sculptures by Alvarez, the Nep tune Fountain near the Prado Muséum, designed by Juan Pascual de Mena, and the Cybeles Foutnian by Francisco Gutiérrez were copied and constructed in New Spain. At the beginning of the colonial era, the plazas and gardens of New Spain were similar in simplicity and sobriety to those of Castille, but with the ascension of a Bourbon monarch to the Spanish throne, French, Austrian and Italian influences were felt in the arts and customs of Spain and subsequently in her colonies. Marble replaced stone as a popular building material, and nymphs, tritons, neptunes and flshes appeared as décorative elements in the increasingly elabórate fountains. The beautiful Neptune Fountain in Querétaro and the neoclassic Caja de Agua in San Luis Potosí were built at this time, and Mexico City's Alameda had four of these mythological fountains — the present-day ones, however, are not the origináis. The disorientation and increased anxiety of Western man that followed the cataclysmic changes brought by the Industrial Révolution were felt in the arts, where the introduction of steel and concrete as architectural and sculptural materials contributed to depersonalized expression. The flrst World War and the Bolshevik Révolution were followed by twenty years of peace and uncertainty, and then the destruction of war was once again known to man. In Mexico, where international affairs as well as national events, most ¡mportantly our social révolution, exerted a strong influence, the flrst half of the présent century was an era of imitation and disorientation in the arts — the muralist movement, however, being an exception. The neocolonial style, born about the time of the Calles administration and motivated by a nostalgia for the past, was soon embellished with na tionalisée motifs, such as the cactuses and masks of the Parque Mexico fountains. More recently, a group of architects designed the University City, a praiseworthy attempt to create a truly Mexican style in which the architecture, utilizing native materials, was integrated with the landscape. Today the fountains of Mexico City that were once abandoned and uncared for have been repaired, cleaned, surrounded with flowers and brought to life, and again a new search for forms and expression is taking place. The architect Luis Barragán, with his rare understanding of beauty, has given new vitality to the fountain in Mexico. His flrst works — the great reflecting pools and cascades in the Pedregal de San Angel — and his more recent fountains in Los Arboledas, the Camino Real and the Egerstron home are superbly designed and are capable of inspiring the spiritual peace so necessary for man's présent and future well-being. 83</page><page sequence="3">Hit i 'Vl Patio del siglo XVII plantado con naranjos.
