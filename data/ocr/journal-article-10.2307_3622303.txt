<plain_text><page sequence="1">RABBI ABRAHAM BEN DAVID OF POSQUIJtRES: HIS ATTITUDE TO AND ACQUAINTANCE WITH SECULAR LEARNING By ISADORE TWERSKY Probably the most scintillating and creative Talmudic scholar of that notable galaxy whose members are designated in later chronicles and rabbinic texts as the "sages of Provence," "elders of Narbonne," or "wise men of Lunel" was Rabbi Abraham ben David (Rabad) of Posquieres (d. 1198).' Contemporary and subsequent sources repeatedly underscore his phenomenal erudi- tion, inspirational piety, widespread authority, and immense prestige; and he himself graciously volunteers the information - certainly accurate but slightly immodest - that his word is law in all Provence.2 During the last decades of Rabad's life Provence was the scene of great intellectual fermentation which came in the wake of the introduction of secular learning carried by emigres from Almohade Spain; a man of Rabad's stature and intellect could hardly insulate himself from this pervasive process of cultural pollination or view the resultant, truly epoch-making changes impassively. This paper aims to appraise Rabad's attitude to, and acquaintance with philosophic thought and extra-Talmudic science. It does not pretend to be an exhaustive study of his theological and ethical opinions; only those which ' The date of Rabad's death is given by Solomon ibn Verga, Shebet Yehudah, ed., Shobet-Baer (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1947), 146-47.

As for the time and place, it should be remembered that Provengal Jews, who until the middle of the twelfth century were immersed head and shoulders in exclusively rabbinic learning, were just being exposed to secular culture. Hitherto, like the Jewish centers of northern France, and unlike those of Moslem Spain which distinguished themselves by their inclusion of secular learning and Arabic scholarship alongside of the traditional academic subjects, Provence was - and is so described by such scholarly observers as Abraham bar HI.iyya,4 Abraham ibn Daud,s and Judah ibn Tibbon6 - a monistic, Torah-centered community completely devoid of secular learning. However, the ground was prepared for expansion and innovation; stray seeds of a more cosmopolitan culture - restricted acquaintance with Arabic, sporadic use of Latin and Provengal, some knowledge of astronomy - were sprouting. The introduction of secular learn- ing was considerably facilitated and accelerated by the avail- ability of original Hebrew writings on a variety of topics: the many valuable works of Abraham bar IHiyya and Abraham ibn Ezra,7 several commentaries on the Sefer Yesirah by Shabbetai 3 We shall not, for instance, analyze Rabad's insights into various questions of ethical theory, especially his original discussion of sexual temperance which is found in the Sha'ar ha-iedushah of the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh. Nor shall we have occasion to mention his terse comments on eschatology and resurrection, which must be viewed in the light of the more articulate position maintained by Nalhmanides or Meir ha-Levi Abulafia. 4 Abraham bar .Hiyya, Hlibbur ha-Meshihah weha-Tishboret, ed., J.

This accumulation of Hebrew writings accessible to interested Prov- engal students was augmented by the translations of Judah ibn Tibbon and Joseph Kimhi who immigrated to Lunel and Nar- bonne respectively, bringing with them their secular learning and Arabic scholarship. Between 1161 and 1186 - in the course of a twenty-five year plan of systematic translations - they had made available in Hebrew the Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh and Mibbar ha-Peninim of Solomon ibn Gabirol, the Hobot ha- Lebabot of Ba.ya ibn Pakuda and the Cuzari of Judah ha-Levi (two ambivalent works capable of stimulating both philosophical and mystical speculation), and the 'Emunot we-De'ot, faithfully rendered. It should also be recalled that Berechiah ha-Nakdan, famous fabulist and popularizer who had epitomized the 'Emunot we-De'ot on the basis of earlier translations, paraphrased the Quaestiones Naturales of Adelard of Bath ;8 Abraham ben HIisdai, Hebrew translator of the well-known Ben ha-Melek weha-Nazir, translated Algazali's ethical work Mozene Sedek (Mizan al- Amal);9 Judah Alharizi provided a Hebrew translation of Honein ben Ish.ak's Musre ha-Pilosofim, a ninth-century Arabic collection of ethical apothegms which enjoyed considerable vogue.I' In the last decades of the twelfth century, therefore, a dedicated Provengal student, although a monolinguist, could already begin to amass a definite measure of knowledge concerning philosophy - something which, all its lingering limitations notwithstanding, was radically novel and previously totally inconceivable. As for the person, it should be emphasized that Rabad was primarily a Talmudist, a "man of one preoccupation" to which everything else was decidedly peripheral.

The Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, a code on the laws of uncleanness and purity, which is most revelatory - in its own discursive manner - of his theological and ethical opinions, was written almost simultaneously with the first Tibbonite translations from the Arabic., In his later Talmudic commentaries, the one on Baba Kamma, for instance, which was written after 1171,12 and especially in the various hassagot, which followed the translations, he had little occasion to express himself 'philosophically and a sense of literary discipline made him shun digressions from his predetermined subject. Even the aggadic portions of those Talmudic tractates which he commented upon evoked no philosophical homilies and very few kabbalistic allegories from him. Consequently, his views on various questions relating to God, nature, and man have to be reconstructed and inferred from scattered references. They will, moreover, be derived mainly from native Jewish sources - from which it is possible to construct a complete system of theology and ethics - and will be expressed for the most part in traditional rabbinic terminology. It may be noted that inasmuch as traditional views are not dogmatic or monolithic, an author's skill in manipulating and selecting various texts displays a definite measure of orig- inality and creativity. However, Rabad did have at his disposal the Hebrew phil- osophic works mentioned previously and an incipient knowledge of the new translations. The atmosphere was generally congenial to this learning, especially in the circle of his famous teacher and "' An exact terminus ad quem for the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh would be forthcoming if the second ethical treatise of Berechiah ha-NaIadan could be precisely dated, for this work apparently contains the earliest quotation from the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh; cf.

If there is no reason to expect that this literature played a decisive role in molding Rabad's thinking and terminology, it is warranted to assume that traces of, or veiled allusions to this learning and its technical jargon are to be discovered in his writings. The undefined variable in the scheme of his theoretical knowledge is how much of the new learning he actually incorporated into his thought and writing. In light of this we must turn, first of all, to the problem of Rabad's ideological attitude toward secular sciences. A number of writers - starting with Geiger and Zunz and followed by Gross and others'3 - have drawn for us an impressionistic portrait of Rabad as completely impervious to the humming activity which then enveloped non-halakic learning. They depict Rabad not only as choosing to remain ignorant of the entire literature which was then circulating in Provence but also as frowning upon its use and denigrating its value. The pigments for their painting are mixed from the following ingredients: they failed to find any immediately explicit references to such learning in Rabad's writing, while they thought they had found certain apparently clear statements by Rabad which bear out their contention. Two passages in particular, in which he speaks of his scholastic inferiority and intellectual backwardness and in which he concedes his remoteness from astronomical knowledge respectively, are usually adduced in support of this view. In addition to - and partly, as a result of - the very evident rationalistic bias under which most members of this school labored, they also conventionally assume that Rabad's criticism of several Maimonidean opinions which reflect philosophic thought is a sure sign of his opposition to philosophy which was, as it were, embodied in Maimonides. The following is a rep- resentative summary of this common view: '3 Zunz, "Abraham b. David," Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift fuir judische Theologie, V (1839), 309; Geiger, ibid., 558; Gross, H., "R. Abraham b. David aus Posquieres," MGWJ, XXII (1873), 402; Atlas, op. cit., 20; cf. also J.

Rabad himself was aware of his inadequate training, and deplored his shortcomings in other branches of scholarship.14 Against this extreme view, there was also a reaction which sought to modify the conventional assumption of his opposition to philosophy and to indicate instead that he showed a benevolent attitude toward it. Even Steinschneider, who speaks of Rabad in one place as "the learned but mystic and not very scientific" scholar, comments elsewhere in a terse, elliptical style char- acteristic of Rabad himself that "his style is short and abrupt, and his views are, after all, not far removed from those whose exclusive authority he condemns."Is Reifmann also, who states that Rabad completely ignored secular sciences, observes - again, with a brevity reminiscent of Rabad - that "secretly he yearned for their love."'6 Interesting in this respect are the acute insights of some late medieval scholars. The rabbi of Oran, North Africa, in the early fifteenth century, in a cor- respondence with his more prominent contemporary Rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet (Ribash) comments on Rabad's relationship to secular sciences as follows: "He was not well-known in, nor did he boast about and let himself be attracted to secular science. Yet, it appears that their views are close."'17 Similarly, the philosopher Joseph Solomon del Medigo, in the introduction to his Nobelot klokmah, alludes to Rabad's familiarity with secular learning.'8 In analyzing this problem, it should be noted first of all that Rabad's stand cannot be assumed a priori to have been negative "4 Atlas, op. cit., English Introduction, XIII.

Rabad's hassagot on Maimonides' Sefer ha-Madda' must be considered in a historical context and compared to similar views maintained by predecessors and successors. The divergent opinions should be treated as legitimate issues of controversy, just as so many of his halakic strictures on the Mishneh Torah must be viewed historically, as links in the historical development of certain juridical views. His acute animadversions against Maimonides on such problems as an- thropomorphism, determinism, and eschatology should not be taken as signs of arbitrary opposition to a philosophic- rationalistic formulation of opinion. They should be analyzed as reasoned convictions, with backgrounds of their own. This analysis might indeed locate Rabad in what we designate as the conservative camp, which was suspicious of excessive philos- ophizing or rational investigation of traditional beliefs, but certainly no verdict of a blanket condemnation of philosophy is warranted by such disagreement. We must therefore reexamine the two vague passages generally taken as indicating Rabad's negativism and reluctance to admit the use of philosophic literature. The first is found in an introduc- tory passage to his hassagot on the Halakot of Alfasi, where he humiliatingly proclaims: I know well that I am among the inferior creatures that God created and did not achieve success in any of the simple sciences ( okmot) that are accessible to wise men because of the dullness of my nature and because the troubles and distressing events of the time which occur to men oppressed me. As a result, I did not grow wise. I put my hand to my mouth because intelligence is lacking and I have no power of speech.19 Rabad continues that despite these shortcomings, he swallowed his reluctance and was presumptuous enough to dissent from Alfasi's views and even to record his criticisms, lest one suspect '9 Hassagot on Alfasi, Kethuboth, 14b.</page><page sequence="8">168 TWERSKY [8] him of being a "silent fool who does not differentiate between good and bad." Now, if this self-debasing confession of ignorance with regard to hoikmot is to be taken as referring to secular sciences, as Zunz, Geiger, and company have done, it appears incongruous and not at all justifiable by the context. Probably what misled these scholars is the plural use of the term hokmot which ordinarily refers to various branches of secular science but which Rabad, most likely following Prov. 9.1, is obviously using with regard to knowledge or learning in general. For, of what relevance is a disclaimer of secular knowledge in the introduction to a purely Talmudic undertaking? As a matter of fact, self-indictment on the grounds of Talmudic parochialism - if such were actually the case here - might even be considered an asset rather than a liability in the critical annotation of a purely Talmudic composi- tion like that of Alfasi, for it would allow greater specialization and more exhaustive knowledge of this one field. We are inclined to maintain that Rabad is not here confessing his ignorance of secular sciences or his inability to pursue them, but is engaging in a customary profession of general humility, unworthiness - even in the field of Talmud, with which he deals - and seem- ingly insurmountable reluctance in undertaking the task of halakic criticism. The whole structure of the passage - the transition from the self-deprecation to the declaration of his intent and the subsequent encomium of Alfasi followed by the reiteration of his own shortcomings - corroborates this in- terpretation.20 The superficial impression received from the second passage - an animadversion against Maimonides concerning astronomy - is also modified after some analysis. Prefatory to his actual 20 Self-deprecation and altruistic praise are conventions of medieval rabbinic composition and need not be illustrated specifically. It is interesting, however, that the identical phrase used by Rabad to indicate his intellectual inferiority is repeated by Meshullam b. Moses of Beziers, who knew Rabad's writings very well; cf. Sefer ha-Hashlamah on Berakoth, ed., H. Brody (Berlin, 1893), introduction. Razah, Rabad's temperamental, independent colleague also comments on his inferiority prior to a lengthy analysis of astronomical theories; cf. ha-Ma'or ha-Ia~an, Rosh ha-Shanah, 20b.</page><page sequence="9">[91 RABBI ABRAHAM BEN DAVID OF POSQUIERES 169 critique of a factual statement by Maimonides --a critique which, in the words of a prominent living mathematician, "has not lost any of its weight even today""'2 - Rabad says somewhat derisively: Because this author raises himself up and boasts about this science and in his opinion he reached the very ultimate (in knowledge of it), while I, on the other hand, am not among those proficient in it, for also my teachers did not attain to it - consequently I have not intruded upon his statements to check up on him, but when I encountered this statement which he wrote it was remarkably strange in my eyes.22 Rabad proceeds to explain the error of Maimonides' calendrical calculation and to correct it. We may safely infer from this passage only the following. Rabad seems to be disclaiming that expert knowledge of astronomy based on foreign sources of which Maimonides, as alleged by Rabad, "boasted," but no hostility to it can be detected in his remarks.23 He felt that the traditional Jewish 2z A. Fraenkel, " 'Al NimmuIleyhem shel ...," Rabbi Kook Memorial Volume (Jerusalem, 1945), 180. 22 Mishneh Torah, Kiddush ha-.Iodesh, VII, 7. 23 As for Rabad's allegation of Maimonides' boasting, it may be said that the tone and style in this section of the Mishneh Torah are clearly more confident and authoritative than elsewhere and Maimonides actually appears in his exposition of astronomical theories as if displaying superior knowledge. For instance, after describing the difficulties inherent in the calculation of the calendar and alluding to the "significant controversies between ancient non- Jewish scholars" who investigated the matter, Maimonides states that "great scholars fell into error concerning these matters, did not possess all the knowl- edge, and doubts were created in their mind concerning these matters." Since in the course of time and as a result of much research and investigation "the methods of this calculation became known to a few scholars" and there are some books on this subject that are not generally known, Maimonides "saw fit to explain the methods of this calculation in 'order that it be available for whoever desires daringly to come unto the work to do it.' " (Ibid., XI, 1-4.) It is perhaps significant that although Maimonides is here quoting a verse in Exod. 36.2, he changes the idiom from "nesa'o libo" to "mela'o libo" (Esth. 9.5), which implies daring and even presumption. Such passages may have been in Rabad's mind when he spoke of Maimonides' boasting. Moreover,</page><page sequence="10">170 TWERSKY [10] astronomy was perfectly sufficient for all calendrical problems and he refers, for example, to his great teachers who managed very well and even understood the laws regulating the proclama- tion of the new month without the specialized astronomical knowledge which Maimonides ostentatiously claimed to possess. In fact, there is a somewhat satirical indication that Maimonides was led astray by his secular knowledge, for after the preliminary contrast between Maimonides' knowledge and his own ignorance, Rabad unhesitatingly goes on to disprove Maimonides' state- ment and to conclude triumphantly: "He seems to me as one who is straying."24 Furthermore, Rabad's opposition was not to the use of astronomical knowledge derived from secular sources in the exploration and solution of calendrical problems but to the fact that this knowledge was not always in keeping with halakic norms, that it was sometimes erroneous for practical religious purposes. Since Maimonides believed himself to be completely proficient in astronomical science while he admittedly was not, Rabad maintained, as a rule, a discreet silence. None of Mai- monides' statements in this section of the Mishneh Torah, more- over, were objectionable on halakic grounds - Rabad's primary concern in the hassagot. However, that Rabad was as articulate as ever when astronomical or mathematical discussion affected practical decisions in halakah is evident not only from this lone animadversion on Hilkot KITiddush ha-Ijodesh where he is quick to expose what appears to him as a blatant error in regard to actual practice, but also in his hassagot on Rabbi Zeraliyah ha-Levi (Razah) concerning the International Date Line, where he allows nothing to pass unscrutinized.2s Rabad's criticism of Razah for the use of secular astronomical learning - Razah Rabad may also have seen Maimonides' famous letter to the Provengal sages concerning astrology (1194) in which Maimonides boasts of having studied this topic assiduously and having read just about every available book on the subject of astronomy and astrology. Rabad may have been alluding to - and poking fun at - this boasting. 24 Ibid.: ynynn ',ry mm. 25 Sefer Katub Sham, ed., M. Z.

He focuses attention upon the erronebus interpretation and makes the point that there is absolutely no need to resort to this foreign knowl- edge. There is no implication of disdain whatsoever in the remark that we should rely exclusively upon professional Tal- mudists in the solution of halakic questions. Rabad merely objects strongly to unqualified outsiders, deficient in Talmudic training but possessed of some astronomical learning, encroaching upon the field of halakah, for they usually distort it. That Rabad was not hostile to astronomical science as such is clear from the fact that he welcomes its use by trained Talmudists who know how to harmonize it with the halakah. He was not content simply to reject dogmatically the conclusions reached by Razah on the basis of astronomical computations as being irreconcilable with the requirements of halakah - as could be done unflinch- ingly by a rabid traditionalist - but refers to the scientific refutation of this view by Isaac ben Baruch ibn al-Baliya, Spanish Talmudist and mathematician who was equally profi- cient in both fields of learning. Such a person was, in the opinion of Rabad, capable of grappling with these knotty problems and his solution would deserve serious consideration. Rabad is pleased here both with the invalidation of an erroneous opinion by kindred theoretical arguments and with the harmonization of a Talmudic view with a related scientific theory.26 It is possible to cite more indirect corroborative evidence - mostly in the form of appropriate and persuasive arguments 26 Ibid.: n;nn 13!) c'ra m rn' 'ma r n1nrr ma n 1 n' Pw 'o in-In '-nzhw i mrnonn i p~ n'Trw Yr 1rn, -I fn pr)x ', K' "3r "D 13Y~V -1231 .ID N 6 mt -H P v=lf'1 7=MM irnM Zi lv, .anrn1 n1 3'ro n1An2 ,p= nrm; cf., e. g., what the fourteenth- century chronicler Isaac de Lattes recorded about Isaac b.

The fact that he did not dissent from a number of Maimonidean statements on the importance of secular knowledge is very meaningful. Note the following Maimonidean declaration in praise of ... the wise men of Greece who composed many books on astronomy which we now possess. The books which the wise men of Israel, who lived in the time of the prophets, from the tribe of Issachar, composed did not reach us. Inasmuch as all these matters are based on clear proofs that are beyond reproach and it is impossible for one to question them, we should not care about the author, irrespective of whether prophets or (scholars from) other nations composed the books.27 Rabad is conspicuously silent. Similarly, when Maimonides enumerates the intellectual prerequisites necessary for election to the Sanhedrin, including in his catalogue an impressive array of secular subjects which must be mastered, Rabad tacitly assents. The significance of this assent, with its implicit aware- ness of the importance of secular learning, is accentuated all the more by the fact that his younger Provengal contemporary and successor in Maimonidean criticism Rabbi Moses ha-Kohen pointedly dissented from this statement, inquiring why the members of the Sanhedrin should be obliged to acquire this knowledge.21 Another detail worthy of special comment is the question of Rabad's interpretation of the 'aggadah, for his attitude toward 'aggadah is sometimes taken as a significant correlative of his intellectual attitude in general. For instance, Gross remarks that "Rabad was entirely prejudiced in favor of the 'aggadah and he opposes its frequently absurd utterances to the pro- foundest ideas of philosophy expressed by Maimonides.""9 It is customary to classify Rabad as an uncompromising literalist in 'aggadah, dedicated to the simple, unsophisticated meaning of all legendary lore, while Maimonides is presented as the apostle 27 Mishneh Torah, Xiddush ha-IHodesh, XVII, 24. 28 Ibid., Sanhedrin, II, 1 and commentaries ad loc. 29 Gross, op. cit., XXIII, 167; cf. Steinschneider, op. cit., 87.</page><page sequence="13">[13] RABBI ABRAHAM BEN DAVID OF POSQUIIkRES 173 of spiritualism and allegorization. The proof-text confirming Rabad's servility to the literalness of the 'aggadah is in the first chapter of Hilkot 'Akum where Maimonides reports Abraham as proclaiming monotheism at the ripe age of forty, possessed of mature intellectual faculties and after much independent reflec- tion, while Rabad cites a second view mentioned in the Talmud that Abraham was only three years old when he recognized the unity of God - and consequently, it is assumed, that this perception must have been a supernatural, supra-rational act.30 This nourishes the generalization concerning Rabad's literalism and naivete in the interpretation of 'aggadah. However, enough examples to the contrary are forthcoming - for instance, the first hassagah in the Mishneh Torah concerning the phenomenal age of Ah.iiyah the Shilonite who participated in the exodus from Egypt and was also a high-ranking member of King David's court,3' one in the third chapter of Hilkot Teshubah where Maimonides reproduces verbatim the Talmudic statement that "a person whose sins outnumber his merits dies immediately because of his wickedness,"32 significant interpretations in the Sifra commentary, and many others. In these, instead of following the 'aggadah verbatim as Maimonides happens to do, Rabad pursues the correct historical perspective or the more realistic interpretation. While these examples do not detract much from Maimonides' rationalism any more than they justify the ascription of an advanced historical or critical sense to Rabad, they do, however, caution against loose generalization and counsel more objective reading of related hassagot. As a matter of fact, even the conventional demonstration based on the divergent statements concerning Abraham's age at the time he proclaimed the monotheistic principle is far from 30 Mishneh Torah, 'Akum, 1, 3; cf. Nedarim, 32a; cf. S. Baron, "The His- torical Outlook of Maimonides," PAAJR, VI (1935), 119. For additional variants, cf. S. Abramson, "'Imre Ijokmah," Minbah li-Yehudah, ed., S.

There is no reason to assume that Rabad actually espoused the legend that he cites. He merely means to call attention to a conflicting source and thus to challenge Mai- monides' imaginative description of Abraham's rationalistic powers and speculative prowess in discovering the truth about God. There are a number of conflicting legends and variant readings concerning Abraham's age at the time. Just as the age of forty does not tell us that the act was rational, so the age of three does not tell us that it was mystical or intuitional. Furthermore, Rabad cites this view as "there is a legend" and it should be remembered that when Rabad introduces a critical note vacuously as "some say" or "there is another opinion," he does not necessarily commit himself to this explanation. There are numerous cases in his halakic critique of Maimonides where he quotes different views merely for the sake of supplementing Maimonides' statement or registering possible alternative ex- planations. The author of the Kenesset ha-Gedolah lists this as one of the general methodological principles governing Rabad's composition: "When Rabad writes 'there is someone who maintains' it cannot be inferred conclusively from this phrase that he adopts the view expressed there.' '33 This rule is certainly applicable with regard to the subject here discussed, for else- where we find Rabad explicitly speaking of an intellectual, cognitive perception of God.34 If we may further introduce a definitely persuasive argument from silence, it is very notable that Rabad allowed the following intellectualistic, typically Maimonidean statement to stand unqualifiedly: "No one loves the Holy One, blessed is He, except by means of the knowledge with which he knows Him. The love will be according to the knowledge: if it be small, the love will be small; if it be great, the love will be great..." That Rabad studied this passage attentively --thus eliminating the possible contention, un- doubtedly valid in other cases, that Rabad may have glossed 33 Kenesset ha-Gedolah, Kelale ha-Rabad (printed at the beginning of most editions of the Mishneh Torah): p',n nr 1 w z.-I 'r- z"' " n n~Ia 34 Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, 88.</page><page sequence="15">[15] RABBI ABRAHAM BEN DAVID OF POSQUIERES 175 over this section without observing it too carefully - is dem- onstrated by the interesting lexicographical annotation on the meaning of "shigayyon" which he appended to the beginning of this very passage.35 Corroborative evidence, finally, that Rabad did not always feel obliged to take the'aggadah literally is the celebrated obiter dictum in which he refers to some midrashic passages and homiletical themes as "corrupting opinion about religious matters."36 This statement, which is a vindication of the metaphorical interpretation and modification of certain 'aggadic notions, should deliver the coup de grace to the preconception concerning Rabad's servility to the literalness of 'aggadah. In summation of the question of his attitude to secular learn- ing, we may say that there is no reason to posit that Rabad appears as an antagonist of secular learning. The sources nowhere reveal an attitude of uncompromising hostility. If anything, we may assert only that in Rabad's implicit classifica- tion of sciences, secular learning was relegated to a secondary position, that it occupied a lower rung in the ladder of knowledge. For Rabad was certainly no philosopher and did not, for instance, share Maimonides' enthusiasm for philosophy. He would un- questionably grant that the "four ells of halakah" might indeed be enlarged to provide space for secular learning, but the latter was clearly not on par with Talmudic learning nor was it in- dispensable. In a number of passages, Rabad stresses that Talmudic study has clear-cut priority over everything else.37 All wisdom, which he duly recognizes, is ultimately futile and evanescent if it is not allied to Torah - and we might note parenthetically that when you get down to it, this view, with 3s Mishneh Torah, Teshubah, X, 6. 36 Ibid., III, 7. 37 Cf. e. g., Sifra commentary, ed., Weiss, 110b; KJinnim commentary, end. It is interesting to observe that there are many parallels between this sentiment and the disputed opinion of Hai Gaon concerning the value and usefulness of secular studies. The latter's statement is quoted by Nahmanides in his letter to the French scholars concerning the ban against secular studies; KobeS. Teshubot ha-Rambam (Leipzig, 1859), III, 9a. cf. also I. H.

It might be worthwhile to point out a curious literary discrepancy between two practically similar statements by Maimonides and Rabad which is very symbolic - even if trivial or perhaps unintentional. Both affirm that man should not castigate or weaken himself because of a contemptuous attitude toward things of the body. Physical well-being is a necessity, for "one who suffers hunger, thirst, or pain" cannot engage in spiritual activities. Maimonides identifies these ac- tivities with "understanding and speculation in the sciences" while Rabad says that one who is weak will necessarily be idle from prayer and study.38 As a final indication of Rabad's attitude to philosophy, we should mention a preliminary, methodological criticism leveled by Rabad at Maimonides before taking issue with his view on the problem of free will. Maimonides had elaborately presented the perplexing antinomy between human freedom and divine foreknowledge and left it as an insoluble problem. Rabad contends that he should never have introduced such an antinomy in a work like the Mishneh Torah which was destined also for laymen and nonprofessionals. Untrained people who do not understand that there exist certain ideas which are insoluble might be misled by Maimonides' conclusion, which is in essence an admission of logical impotence. It is preferable, Rabad contends, to leave such matters in the realm of faith from the very beginning rather than to analyze them philosophically, speculate about them, and ultimately reduce them to articles of a religious creed.39 From one aspect, this may be taken as an accusation of Maimonides for a breach in the discipline of esoteric knowledge, of confronting laymen with problems that are beyond their grasp. It should be noted incidentally that Maimonides would definitely defend himself against such an accusation, for he 38 Mishneh Torah, De'ot, III, 3; Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, 87. 39 Mishneh Torah, Teshubah, V, 5.

This clearly underscores Rabad's primary, pervasive concern with the practical religious life. In view of all this, we may affirm that Natmanides was undoubtedly justified in invoking the authority of Rabad and the sages of Lunel in support of his conciliatory position during the prolonged and heated controversy concerning philosophic works, in general, and the study of Maimonides' Moreh Nebukim and Sefer ha-Madda', in particular. He cites Rabad's essential acceptance of Maimonides. Even though Rabad criticized and disputed several opinions, Nabmanides asserted, he never accused Maimonides of heresy or impugned his orthodoxy. He never suggested that the book be suppressed or its reading be pro- hibited. Nahlmanides believes, in short, that Rabad would naturally have aligned himself with his own intermediate view.41 This reservedly benevolent attitude which we have tried to delineate is best attested to and substantially bolstered by his actual use of philosophic literature. This use is revealed by a study resting upon the usual bases of internal evidence: bits of philosophic terminology discovered in his writings; similarities of structure and reasoning between Rabad and representatives 40 Mishnah Commentary, Introduction; I.agigah, II, 1; Mishneh Torah, Yesode ha-Torah, II, 12; IV, 10: Moreh Nebukim, I, 71.

Such an investigation discloses that Rabad knew a number of philosophic or scientific works, either originally composed in Hebrew or made available in Hebrew translations from the Arabic. These are the astronomical works (Sefer .lokmat ha-Kokawim and Sefer ha-'Ibbur) and Hegyon ha-Nefesh of Abraham bar Hiyya, the Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh of Gabirol, the Cuzari of Judah ha-Levi, the Ifobot ha-Lebabot of Babya ibn Pakuda, the 'Emunot we-De'ot of Saadia, and possibly the Musre ha-Pilosofim of Honein ben Ishak and Ifakemoni of Shabbetai Donnolo. These borrowings and sim- ilarities, although not abundant, are strikingly exact and suffi- ciently technical to warrant the assumption of direct use of these works. The specific contexts in which they usually appear preclude the possibility of their having been "picked up" in- directly. I shall try in the following pages to reproduce as succinctly as possible the evidence for this sweeping declaration. In the lengthy discussion concerning the International Date Line, which we have already cited, two authors are mentioned by name. The first is Abraham bar HIiyya whose astronomical treatises - Sefer Iokmat ha-Kokawim and Sefer ha-'Ibbur, the latter being, incidentally, the oldest Hebrew work on the calcula- tion of the calendar - are knowingly discussed in comparative detail. Rabad does not repeat the titles of these works, which Razah had already specified;42 he dismisses them as "the treatises of Abraham bar HIiyya the Spaniard," but the manner of his discussion and refutation clearly evidences direct knowledge.43 This knowledge - boastfulness, if you like - is even reflected in the flippant remark implying that Razah was a dilettante in these matters and the little information which he garnered from his perusal of bar Hiyya's works was inadequate. Furthermore, Rabad's reference in the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh to the "eternal thought" (mazashabah kadmonit) in which all later creative acts resided most probably reflects Abraham bar Hiyya's intellectualistic conception of divine action, formulated 42 Ha-Ma'or ha-Ia.an, Rosh ha-Shanah, 25a. 43 Katub Sham, II, 38.

Zerabya ha-Levi," REJ, LIX (1910), 208, n. 2.</page><page sequence="19">[19] RABBI ABRAHAM BEN DAVID OF POSQUIERES 179 in the Hegyon ha-Nefesh, where he uses the phrase "pure thought" (matashabah tehorah) to describe the eternal, primordial divine idea which preceded and planned the entire creation. It is noteworthy that this intellectualistic conception - vis a vis the voluntaristic conception of Gabirol, for instance - is also found in the Bahir, an early kabbalistic classic appearing in Provence at this time in Rabad's circle. The Bahir uses "thought" (mah.ashabah) to designate the highest divine sphere (keter) - a usage which Professor Scholem traces back to the Hegyon ha-Nefesh.44 The second and main source from which Razah derived his information for establishing the International Date Line was the Cuzari of Judah ha-Levi. Razah does not mention ha-Levi explicitly; all he gives is a vague reference to "Spanish sages.'"45 The name of the immediate, underlying authority is supplied for us by Rabad for, as is his custom in many halakic strictures, he first clarifies his opponent's source, elaborates his view, and only then does he proceed to refute it. Rabad felt that Razah's reproduction of ha-Levi was too nebulous and wanting in precision, and the reader could never understand the subject only from Razah's account - "the halakah is not clearly for- mulated on the basis of his statements." Consequently, Rabad presented "the gist" of ha-Levi's thought. What he gives is an accurate paraphrase of ha-Levi's four arguments for the cen- trality of Palestine. The equivocation existing among scholars concerning the question of Rabad's direct use of the Cuzari or second-hand acquaintance with its contents can be categorically eliminated by a parallel reading of the two passages.46 The perfect correlation of thought-content as well as the stylistic affinities speak for themselves. The fact that he does not quote ha-Levi verbatim is in keeping with common medieval literary usage as well as his professed intention of stating only "the gist of his statements." 44 Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, 4; Hegyon ha-Nefesh (Leipzig, 1860), 2; cf.

(c) It is there that the calendar began after the six days of creation, for Adam then began to name the days. (d) When the earth was inhabited and people mul- tiplied they continued counting in the same way.47 Rabad One who sees this opinion in the Cuzari will understand that the beginning of the Sabbath is there, in Palestine, because (a) that is the source of the Torah and the commandments; (b) it was there that Adam was transferred when he left the Garden of Eden; (c) it was there that he named the days; (d) all succeeding generations accepted (this system) from him... This is the gist (toref) of his statements.48 It may be noted incidentally that Rabad's use of the Hebrew word "toref" in the sense of "gist" or general idea is in keeping with that common in the writings of Abraham bar Ijiyya. The word "toref" may also be used - as it is by Maimonides, for instance - to introduce a direct quotation.49 There is other proof that Rabad borrowed from the Cuzari. In explanation of the verse "Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice ... and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire,"so adduced in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael to illustrate the thirteenth hermeneutic rule of Scriptural interpretation - "when two verses contradict each other, the contradiction is removed by a third verse" - as well as in explanation of the midrashic statement that "God lowered the upper heavens of heaven down to the mountain top,"s5 Rabad submits that "God showed the form of the upper fire ('esh 'elyonah) on the mountain 47 Cuzari, II, 18. 48 Katub Sham, II, 38. 49 Cf.

As for Babya ibn Pakuda's HIobot ha-Lebabot, whose mystical overtones, pietistic strains, and popular religious character were undoubtedly of great interest to Rabad - part of it was even translated from the Arabic at his insistent urging - he knew not only the Hebrew text but also Judah ibn Tibbon's introduc- tion. One version of an annotation on Hilkot Shebu'ot faithfully reflects ibn Tibbon's observations on the prerequisites for proper translations. Criticizing Maimonides for translating the original Aramaic of the Talmud into Hebrew and, in the process, changing the meaning or not reproducing it accurately, Rabad remarks: "I acknowledge the truth to be with them who said that one who translates from one language to another must be proficient in the subject matter and in both languages." In the introduction to his translation of the I.obot ha-Lebabot, Judah ibn Tibbon enumerates three factors which lead translators to corrupt the original works: "They are not proficient in Arabic from which they translate ... are not proficient in Hebrew to which they translate ... do not understand the statements of the author."s54 There is a more or less literal allusion in the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh to the first section of the IUobot ha-Lebabot. Speaking of the relation of the Creator and the created, Rabad describes God as beyond both transcendence and immanence: Every created being should know that he is not separated from the Creator and (yet) is not compound with him, for whatever is compound is limited and whatever is limited has been created. The Creator, exalted be He, has none of these attributes for He is eternal, neither limited or created.ss 52 Sifra, op. cit., la. 53 Cuzari, V, 14. s4 Mishneh Torah, Shebu'ot, VI, 9; Judah ibn Tibbon, Introduction to Hobot ha-Lebabot. ss Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, 88.</page><page sequence="22">182 TWERSKY [22] This is obviously a reflection of the similar statement by Babya: Whatever is separate is limited. Whatever is limited is finite. Whatever is finite is compound. Whatever is com- pound has been created. Whatever has been created has a Creator. We have therefore demonstrated that the Creator is eternal, cause of all causes.s6 The recently published derashah of Rabad for Rosh ha-Shanah - the only extant example of a significant literary genre cul- tivated by Rabad, as by Provengal scholars in general - also reveals his acquaintance with the Uobot ha-Lebabot. In the context of his exhortatory, ethical discourse on repentance, Rabad gives a five-fold classification of penitent people: (a) penitent on his own, not motivated by the rebuke of another; (b) penitent as a result of heeding the rebuke of another; (c) penitent only after witnessing the punishment inflicted upon another sinner; (d) penitent only after he himself is castigated; (e) penitent only at "the gates of death." This is based directly on Babya's analogous four-fold classification in chapter six of his Sha'ar ha-Teshubah. The fifth category, added by Rabad, is a self-evident extension or supplement.s7 In addition, we shall presently note the affinity between Rabad and Balya concerning the problem of Divine Incorpo- reality. In further describing God's relationship to and presence in the world, Rabad says that the existence of created things does not separate God from the world or restrict His being: The Creator is the place of the world but the world is not His place. The analogy of this is that the world is full of air and everything enters into the air. They feel it but it is invisible to them.s8 This analogy, which, as Professor Scholem mentions,59 was adopted and elaborated by later kabbalists, is to be traced back s6 IHobot ha-Lebabot, I, 9.

Attention should be called to the following passage in the Emunot we-De'ot: "How is it possible to conceive the thought of God's presence everywhere so that no place would be vacant of His presence?"S6 Also, Judah ben Barzilai, in his commentary on Sefer Yesirah, observes that "all places are in me, for I am the place of my world and my world is not my place and I am the place of all my creatures."6' The late Professors Marx and Ginzberg contended that Rabad's statement in Hilkot Teshubah ("this author did not conduct himself according to the custom of the sages, for one does not start something if he does not know how to finish it") is actually a quotation from the Musre ha-Pilosofim ("do not start something which you will be unable to finish"). If Rabad did in fact use this as his literary model - and the thought itself is clearly too much of a common-sense maxim to warrant any definite assertion of literary dependence - it follows that it is the oldest known quotation from the Musre ha-Pilosofim by a French author.6" The question of the place of man in creation and, especially, his relationship to the angels - in other words, the subject of anthropocentrism, which was a favorite of both midrashic and philosophic speculation63 -is taken up, among others, by Solomon ibn Gabirol.

We know this from the Patriarch Abraham when (the angels came) to inform and warn him... There are many illustrations of these matters and I shall not expatiate to recall them all. The language, imagery, and ideas of Gabirol are reflected in the following passage of Rabad, taken from the context of a similar discussion in the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh and not distinguished by any philosophic language: Even the higher spiritual beings (angels) are given over to serve the righteous person. We found this (in the case) of the angel who came to inform Sarah... There is no need to expatiate on this matter, for (it is illustrated) in many places which are known to all.64 In Gabirol, as well as in other philosophic literature available to Rabad, it was common to point out analogies between the four elements of nature and the four humors of man. This analogy, which, as Prof. Wolfson has shown,65 stems originally from a passage in Galen, is expressed in the Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh as follows: "God created man with four natural elements, for he has in him blood which is analogous to air, phlegm which is analogous to water..."66 Also Shabbetai Donnolo, in the first part of 1akemoni, works with this par- allelism: "So He created man also from the four elements: from air, water, fire, and earth and they are blood, phlegm, choler, and melancholy."'67 In discussing the nature and importance of man, Rabad echoes this distinctly philosophic concept: "the 64 Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, 3. 65 H.

We find him using such phrases as 'ilat ha-'ilot, yeshut, kadmut, 4iddush, yesh me-'ayin, hay medaber, nefesh behemit, gezerah (in the sense of predetermination), ru~anim 'elyonim (in the sense of angels). Besides, other Arabicized Hebrew terms, introduced by the contemporary translators - for instance, 4aber in the sense of 'compose,' hassagah for 'criticism,' 'anshe (like 'anshe ha-Me .ar) for devotees of a certain subject - are also used by Rabad. These terms could be derived only from the new literature then beginning to circulate in Provence.69 In the philosophic literature available to Rabad, the perennial problem of human free will versus divine foreknowledge was customarily solved by maintaining that God's knowledge was not causative or determinative. Saadia repeats this middle-of-the road solution in the fourth chapter of the 'Emunot we-De'ot as follows: "The Creator's foreknowledge of things is not the cause of their coming into being.. ."70 In the last part of the Cuzari, ha-Levi also reproduces this answer, which was the stock Kalam view: The Mutakallims considered this matter in detail, with the result that the divine knowledge of the potential is but casual, that the knowledge of a thing is not the cause of its coming into existence and God's knowledge does not compel."7'1 Maimonides did not believe this to be a satisfactory answer and did not repeat it. In the Mishneh Torah he states frankly that the antinomy is insoluble, inasmuch as the omniscience and 68 Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, 3. 69 Ibid., especially 3, 4, 80, 87, 88; cf.

Divine knowl- edge, which obliterates the customary subject-object division, is incomprehensible to us and therefore we cannot eliminate or logically circumvent this inherent contradiction between the freedom of man and the knowledge of God. Both, Maimonides concludes, must remain articles of faith.72 This exposition - which Husik has termed "agnostic"73 - left Rabad cold and led him to submit hesitatingly a solution of his own: Although there is no decisive answer to this (dilemma), it is desirable to provide some answer. I say that if the right- eousness or wickedness of man were dependent on the decree of the Creator blessed be He, we would conclude that His knowledge is His decree and then the question would be very difficult for us. Now that the Creator removed this power from His hand and put it in man's own hand, His prescience is not a decree but may be com- pared to the foreknowledge of the astrologers who conclude the character of a man from the stars. It is known that whatever happens to man, great or small, God turned over to the power of the stars. He bestowed upon man, however, a mind which gives him the strength to avert the influence of the stars. That is the possibility given to man to be good or bad. The Creator knows the power of the stars and can judge whether the mind has the strength to over- come it. This knowledge is not a decree. But all this is not worth much (as as answer).74 The problematic aspect of God's prescience in relation to man's freedom is thus disposed of by Rabad just as it was by Saadia and ha-Levi - prescience is not a decree. When he says that "it is desirable to provide some answer" to this dilemma, he is merely falling back upon the conventional philosophic theory which Maimonides had rejected and which he himself admits "is not worth much." 72 Mishneh Torah, Teshubah, V, 5. 73 I.

The influence of the stars, belief in which was a fashion- able, widespread doctrine, is not determinative, for God endowed man with adequate intellectual resources with which to avert this influence and liberate his destiny from blind power. Man remains, therefore, in the face of both divine foreknowledge and stellar influence, a free, volitional creature capable of self- determination. 75 In conclusion, we turn to a famous hassagah on the Mishneh Torah which indirectly involves both the problem of his attitude to philosophy as well as his use of philosophic terminology. The issue was the well-known question of Divine Incorporeality, which had been discussed at great length and on many occasions by the rabbis and by all Jewish philosophers from Philo to Maimonides.76 The metaphoric interpretation of all Scriptural anthropomorphisms, in keeping with the explicit Scriptural doctrine of the absolute unlikeness of God, was the accepted view. When Maimonides, in his code, made a five-fold classification of heretics, the third being "he who says there is one ruler, but that He is a body and has form," he elevated a common belief to the status of a rigid dogma. In his animadversion directed against this part of Maimonides' statement, Rabad comments trenchantly: Why has he called such a person an heretic? There are many people greater than and superior to him who adhere to such a belief on the basis of what they have seen in verses of Scripture and even more in the words of those 'aggadot which corrupt right opinion about religious matters.77 75 Cf. in general, Marx, ibid., 63-76.

There are those scholars - like Eppen- stein, Gross, David Kaufmann, Ezekiel Kaufmann, and others, with slight shades of opinion between them - who, disregarding the very meaningful conclusion of Rabad's animadversion which brands the anthropomorphic legends as corrupting, place him in the camp of anthropomorphists or attributists.78 Others, like Steinschneider, Guedemann, Ginzberg, Atlas, and Kadushin, maintain that the last phrase clearly indicates that Rabad him- self did not subscribe to the principle of corporeality but intended only to defend its adherents against the charge of heresy.79 Deserving special mention is Professor Scholem's original in- terpretation which submits that Rabad's hassagah reflects the mystical belief in a logos - "which is like a body to the soul." Although Rabad and the mystics agreed that God as the first Cause was absolutely spiritual, they were willing to sanction all corporeal allusions with reference to the Demiurge.so Now, there is not a shadow of doubt that Rabad was personally committed to the traditional Jewish view which maintained the unlikeness and incorporeality of God as an nlmy, nt.

Albo, neutralizing the acidity of Rabad's hassagah, quotes him as saying: "Certainly the essential principle of belief is that God is incorporeal."s, Elsewhere in his writings, Rabad is emphatic and unequivocal concerning the elimination of all anthropomorphic attributes with regard to God: "... it is not correct to speak in this manner about the Creator."8" In this statement he implicitly concurs with the Talmudic maxim "the Torah speaks according to the language of men," which is explicitly invoked by Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah in connection with the allegorical interpretation of certain grossly anthropomorphic expressions of Scripture - and there also Rabad tacitly assents.83 As a matter of fact, Rabad quotes the famous rabbinic statement from the Mekilta - "We describe God by terms borrowed from His creations in order to cause them to sink into the ear"84 - with a few minor variations. He says concerning the description of God: If Scripture compared the Creator (in His act of creation) to clay in the hands of the potter, it is only that the ear might get it in accordance with its capacity for hearing, i. e. understanding. Any simile applied to God is as remote from the literal sense of the metaphor as east is from west.8s Moreover, he was very fond of the Iobot ha-Lebabot, which is decidedly antianthropomorphistic.86 Finally, he passes over Maimonides' lengthy metaphysical formulation of the absolute incorporeality of God in the very first chapter of Hilkot Yesode 81 J.

While the point is a good one, it should be observed that Babya's refutation of anthropomorphism occurs in the first chapter (section ten), which was translated at the request of Meshullam ben Jacob of Lunel.</page><page sequence="30">190 TWERSKY [301 ha-Torah without comment or qualification. This is a case where an argument ex silentio may convincingly be mustered as corroborative evidence. Why then did Rabad dissent so vociferously when Mai- monides, in his enumeration of the "five classes (that) are termed heretics," included those who impute body or form to God together with those who actually deny His existence or posit a plurality of deities? Why should he take issue with Maimonides on a matter concerning which they are in theoretical agreement? The answer is that Rabad objected to the apodictic style in which Maimonides stressed the importance of this dogma. He was clearly not against the belief in incorporeality, but he was against Maimonides' doctrinaire statement that one who affirms the corporeality of God is a heretic. Certainly, individuals distinguished by impeccable piety and Talmudic erudition ought not to be stigmatized as heretics and, by implication, be denied a place in the hereafter as a result of their literal reading of Scripture. Literalism of this sort, moreover, was evidently widespread. Maimonides himself was acquainted with Jews of unshakeable literalist persuasion, whom he condemned un- qualifiedly. He reports that he encountered many prominent Talmudists some of whom were uncertain whether God possessed eyes, hands, and feet while others concluded categorically that God had a body with organs and senses.8' Younger contem- poraries and immediate successors such as Nahmanides, David Kimbi, and Maimonides' son Abraham also inform us of the prevalence of these beliefs.88 Rabad presumably knew such people, whom he held in high esteem, and he was not prepared to dismiss them as second-rate Jews, even though he himself did not favor literalism. 87 "Ma'amar Tebiyat ha-Metim," in 'Iggerot ha-Rambam, ed., M.

Scripture speaks only of the "unlikeness" of God, which Philo for the first time equated with the doctrine of philosophic incorporeality. In his footsteps, all philosophers identified this philosophic view with this Scriptural teaching but recognized that divine Incorporeality is nowhere explicitly taught in Scripture.89 It is noteworthy that in his hassagah Rabad does not use the term for incorporeality. He must have been thinking in terms of "unlikeness." In short, an erroneous notion concerning the philosophic conception of the incorporeality of God did not necessarily imply religious im- perfection and need not be condemned. In his opinion - and this, as we have seen, is characteristic of his entire attitude and manner of thinking - philosophic formulations were not binding for all Jews provided that the practical religious life was un- impaired. Such, in essence, is the view, popular and tolerant, expressed also by Bahya ibn Pakuda in the first section of his philosophic work, the contents of which Rabad had undoubtedly absorbed: The foolish and simple person will conceive the Creator in accordance with the literal sense of the Scriptural phrase. And if he assumes the obligation of serving his God and strives to labor for His glory, he has in his simplicity and lack of understanding a great excuse for his erroneous conception. For man is accountable for his thoughts and deeds only according to his powers of apprehension and comprehension, physical strength and material means.90 It is in the spirit of this view of BahIya that the concurrent opinion of Rabad is reformulated in the fifteenth century by Joseph Albo, the last of the great medieval Jewish philosophers. Albo was well-acquainted with Rabad's theory, which he quotes - with a very meaningful variation, as we have noted - and explains as part of an interesting justification of both philosophic 89 Wolfson, Philo, II, 96 ff. 90 IHobot ha-Lebabot, I, 10.</page><page sequence="32">192 TWERSKY 1321 inquiry and speculative nonconformity. His argument runs as follows, the similarities to Rabad being self-evident: We say, therefore, that a person whose speculative ability is not sufficient to enable him to reach the true meaning of Scriptural texts, with the result that he believes in the literal meaning and entertains absurd ideas because he thinks they represent the view of the Torah, is not thereby excluded from the community of those who believe in the Torah, Heaven forbid. Nor is it permitted to speak disrespectfully of him and accuse him of perverting the teaching of the Torah and class him among heretics.9~ 9' 'I arim, 1, 2.</page></plain_text>
