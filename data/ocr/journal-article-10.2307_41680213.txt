It is about a fascination with natural places that are unwelcoming, even unfor- giving, to human presence: ocean, mountains, desert, the wilderness. Of course the books and, in one section, movies that depict such places cannot completely avoid humanizing them since it is humans doing the depict- ing. They do go as far as they can, using the rhetorical possibilities at their disposal to diminish if not completely deface the signs of human presence that mar what would ideally be pristine sites. In the first section I examine some of these philosophical and rhetori- cal strategies. The theories and terms for such strategies mostly postdate the writings that use them, as is usually true for literary critiques. The strategies I find most relevant are the negative dialectics of Theodor Adorno, negative theology, Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime, and variations on these conceptions in the emerging field of what is now called ecocriticism. I first explore the problem of representing the unrep- resentable, a problem negative theology saw in any attempt to represent God and Adorno saw in any attempt to represent nature. Indeed, even the word "nature" turns out to be complex and inherently contradictory. Near the end of this section I show how Wallace Stevens's poem "The Snow Man," which contains the line that gives my book its title, plays out the paradoxes of attempting to write nature naturally. This section concludes with Robinson Jeffers's proclamation of a conception of nature that he terms "inhumanist," which explicitly rejects edenic and comforting fantasies of nature. The next section is concerned with Thoreau's quest for wildness, as shown especially in his journals and in "Ktaadn," his account of Mount Ktaadn's encounter with him, later posthumously incorporated in The Maine Woods. We shall see an explosion of paradoxy in Thoreau's endeavor to write nature in as uncivilized a fashion as possible. Thoreau departs from his mentor, Emerson, whose conception of nature eventually folds it back into the subjective ego from which Thoreau, along with other artists in this study, was trying to escape. Indeed, a central motif of this study is Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 54, No. 2, Summer 2012 © 2012 by the University of Texas Press, PO Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="4">Preface 221 the felt need to transcend personal ego and the ever-expanding cultural apparatus in order to rediscover something basic and primal. Whether this can be done, of course, is in question. Thoreau does make a determined attempt to identify with the wild in the form of a fox and a mountain (Ktaadn), though he is outfoxed by a loon. Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat," the subject of section 3, under- mines notions of nature's quasi-providential benevolence with lethal irony while also powerfully conveying its sublime power. Here, as with Ktaadn in Thoreau, the central agency is found in nature as opposed to human ef- forts. The men in the boat are at the mercy of nature, which has no mercy. The men would settle even for malevolence so they could have the solace of something if not someone to blame, but this too fails them. Nature is simply magnificently and dangerously there, while God is conspicuously not there. The story is as much about falsely comforting conventions of representing nature as it is about the natural world itself, a world that resists such representational conventions except for the one Crane himself employs, that of the sublime. The focus of section 4 is the desert; I explore three encounters with the southwestern desert in Bill Broyles's Sunshot, Charles Bowden' s Inferno , and Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire. These are wild books by wild authors about wild places, places all three love in direct ratio to how unforgiving they are. In Bowden and Abbey the unrepresentability of the desert world is a theme, as is its sublimity Section 5 takes up fictional and filmic representations of dangerous terrain: the Sahara in Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky; the harshness of the outback in the Australian film The Proposition ; the high desert of Kekexili in the Chinese film Mountain Patrol : Kekexili; the desert seacoast of Brazil in House of Sand ( Casa de Areia); and, briefly, the Atlantic Ocean in The Perfect Storm. In these works human presence is dwarfed and threatened by the force of the settings. Finally, in section 6, I show why these sites should matter to us, discussing three works that portray the consequences that come from ne- glecting the facts of nature: Patricia Highsmith's prophetic fable "Please Don't Shoot the Trees," Jack London's "To Build a Fire," and Werner Herzog' s documentary film about Timothy Tread well' s encounter with the bears he tried to love, Grizzly Man. These are moral tales clearly intended to warn us of the threats we bring to ourselves by excessive ignorance of and confidence in nature.</page><page sequence="5">"The Nothing That Is": Representations of Nature in American Writing Anthony Channell Hilfer 1. The Nothing That Is There is naked Nature, inhumanly sincere, wasting no thought on man, nibbling at the cliffy shore where gulls wheel amid the spray. - Thoreau, Cape Cod- Is it even possible to write about nature without anthropomorphizing or humanizing it? Can the ideal of "nature writing itself" (Cameron 47) be achieved, and can "things noncommittally reveal what they are" (Cameron 79)? This section examines philosophical and critical proposi- tions on the attempt to outflank the tendency to sentimentalize nature, to reduce it to human terms and human uses. A powerful critical convention now reigning in literary studies argues that all experience is so mediated by culture as to be merely cul- tural reflex; when nature speaks to us, it tells us what we already know and wish to hear. In a bit of ventriloquism, nature is Charlie McCarthy; his lips move and the culture is Edgar Bergen speaking through them. Whether nature or anything else can be experienced without cultural and psychological préfabrication, without bouncing our own images off it, installing our own desires in it, is the question. Most contemporary philosophy would read claims of authentic representation out of court, doubting the possibility of unmediated experience of anything. Without questioning that our cultural conditioning mediates our experiences, I would argue that it does not predictably determine them. To me it seems possible to have authentic contact with the world, the real, the natu- ral. But it isn't easy to communicate such experience. It takes time to absorb an inhuman communication, one that is wordless and thus re- quires rhetorical translation. Any account of reality must be mediated by a rhetorical frame and its accompanying conventions. As T. S.

Nature, capital N, is especially hard to speak. As Raymond Williams demonstrates in Keywords , "Nature is perhaps the most complex word in the language" (184). The word encompasses a range of differing and sometimes incommensurable meanings, though Williams nicely sorts out the major ones. Moreover, in certain usages the word "nature" becomes a singular word that denotes multiple entities or qualities. Charles Darwin, Thoreau's contemporary, supplies a concise illustration of the latter use: "It is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by Na- ture, only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us" (92). Arguably, any use of the word "nature" is a personification moving toward an allegory, es- pecially if the use assumes agency or essence: Nature doing, Nature being, and so forth. As will be seen, the works in this study do assign agency to nature, though sometimes hedged with irony. It may be that the concept of Nature is both necessary and necessarily ambiguous. There are similar problems with the concept of a monotheistic divinity. Paganism and espe- cially animism manage diversity more naturally. There are philosophical positions that allow for eruptions of au- thentic experience, epiphanies of reality, while not denying the problem of translating such experiences into language. These positions are nega- tive dialectics, negative theology, and the aesthetic mode of the sublime. Negative dialectics was a philosophical method developed by the German philosopher Theodor Adorno. Dialectic, a philosophical method of arriv- ing at something approximating truth by way of questioning, answering, and questioning the answers, is the method of the Platonic dialogues, though Plato stacked the deck in favor of Socrates. Adorno believed that any positive, that is affirmative, philosophy was subject to being co-opted by the reigning social and political hegemony, which had an inherent ten- dency to define as common sense whatever advantaged the power elite. Philosophical systems especially tended toward totalistic, even totalitar- ian, closure, limiting possibility and change. In his seminal work Aesthetic Theory , Adorno applied his mode of questioning to conceptions of art and nature, attacking sentimental hu- manizations of nature that served as reassurances of bourgeois comfort. In keeping with the provisional, antisy stematic nature of his thought, Adorno, like his forebear Nietzsche, wrote in an aphoristic, sometimes orphie, style. He accused idealist philosophy of "the desiccation of everything not to- tally ruled by the subject" (62). The difficulty in talking about nature is that "as indeterminate, as antithetical to definitions, natural beauty is in- definable [. . .] Its object is determined negatively, as indeterminable" (72). "Words glance off nature and betray its language to one that is qualitatively</page><page sequence="7">224 Anthony Channeil Hilfer different from its own" (73). Adorno appeals to an "idea of that nature that extirpates the primacy of human meaning" (60). "Natural grandeur" re- veals "that aspect in which human domination has its limits and that calls to mind the powerlessness of human bustle" (70). Nature is in principle divorced from the human: "The essence of natural beauty [. . .] is precisely what does not exist for-an-other" (74). Thus, art holds true to the appear- ances of nature "only where it makes landscape present in the expression of its own negativity" (67-68). Some such landscapes are the ocean in Stephen Crane, the desert in Paul Bowles, and the outback in the Australian film The Proposition. Finally, "Silence is the single medium through which nature speaks" (74). Adorno's reflections on nature have proceeded to a paradox: silence speaking. This is what Mount Ktaadn does for Thoreau, the ocean does for Crane, and the desert for Bowles. As a Marxist materialist, Adorno keeps any conception of deity out of the picture, though such formulations as his, as will be apparent, tend to substitute nature for god as a deific principle. Yet Adorno's negative dialectics was anticipated by the methodology of negative theology, which theorized the problem of representing the transcendent as Adorno did and additionally posited a rhetorical technique for dealing with the paradox of needing to speak the unspeakable. Negative theology answers the felt need to convey a presence that, like Rudolf Otto's idea of the numinous, "completely eludes apprehension in terms of concepts" (5) because "God stands above all possible predication whatever, and so is Nothingness and the silent Desert" (185). It is the "wholly other" to the point that mysticism "finally actually calls it 'that which is nothing'" (29). Otto describes this as as- sociated with "deserts and empty distances " (Otto's italics). "Empty distance, remote vacancy, is [. . .] the sublime in the horizontal. The wide-stretching desert, the boundless uniformity of the steppe, have real sublimity" (69). Silence is another aspect of the numinous: "Even the most consummate Mass-music can only give utterance to the holiest, most numinous moment in the Mass - the moment of transubstantiation - by sinking into stillness: no momentary pause, but an absolute cessation of sound long enough for us to 'hear the silence itself'" (70). The. almost unspeakably silent presence, found in the privileged sites of the " deserts and empty distances " in this study, tends to lead to "the es- timation of the self, of the personal 'I,' as something not perfectly nor essentially real, or even as mere nullity, a self-depreciation that comes to demand its own fulfillment in rejecting the delusion of selfhood, and so makes for the annihilation of self" (Otto 21). Yet Otto offers an interesting out for the self. It is "the Identification , in different degrees, of the per- sonal self with the transcendent reality" (22). Except that for the writers I examine, the numinous attributes are found not in God but in Nature, sometimes in the form of quasi-totemic identifications, as with the fox</page><page sequence="8">Representations of Nature in American Writing 225 in Thoreau, or, more cosmically, with the desert in Abbey. The midpoint of this development is Goethe's conception of the demoniac, which Otto depreciates precisely because he sees it as neopagan. For Goethe, the de- moniac was a complex and paradoxical presence: He thought he could detect it in nature - both animate and inanimate, with soul or without soul - something which manifests itself only in contradictions, and which, therefore, could not be comprehended under any idea, still less under one word. It was not godlike, for it seemed unreasonable; not human, for it had no understanding; nor devilish, for it was beneficent; nor angelic, for it often betrayed a mali- cious pleasure. It resembled chance, for it evolved no consequences: it was like Providence, for it hinted at connection. All that limits us it seemed to penetrate; it seemed to sport at will with the necessary elements of our existence; it contracted time and expanded space. In the impossible alone did it appear to find pleasure, while it rejected the possible with contempt. (543) Besides theorizing the paradox of representing the unrepresentable, negative theology developed a rhetorical method for outflanking this di- lemma. As Anne Howland Schotter puts it: Any Christian visionary writer must confront the problem of how to convey the divine in human terms. Throughout history theologians have spoken of two ways, the positive, which proposes analogies for God, and the negative, which denies that any analogies are valid. The two ways tend to work in a dialectical manner, the latter continually warning against the idolatry that the former might encourage. (23) This technique, applied to theology by such thinkers as Abelard ( Sic et Non), is central to the dialectics of antihumanist nature writing. Theologians since the sixth century have termed such paradoxes "apophatic," that is, "unsaying" or "speaking away" (Lane 246, footnote 5). Lane, in his wonderfully titled book The Solace of Fierce Landscapes , goes on to say, The apophatic tradition, despite its distrust of all images about God, makes an exception in using the imagery of threatening places as a way of challenging the ego and leaving one at a loss for words. If we cannot know Goďs essence, we can stand in God's place - on the high mountain, in the lonely desert, at the point where terror gives way to wonder. Only there do we enter the abandonment, the agnosia , that is finally necessary for meeting God. (65)</page><page sequence="9">226 Anthony Channeil Hilfer Substitute Nature for God in this fine passage and it applies perfectly to the writers in this study. Apophasis is their native language. Another approach to squaring the circle of representing a nature that resists human appropriation is a particular use of the sublime. Here I do not mean the sublime primarily as a rhetorical category, as in Longinus, but rather as a way of apprehending, or striking an attitude toward, nature as well as art, as in Edmund Burke. In "A Philosophical Enquiry into the Sub- lime and the Beautiful," Burke stated, "I know of nothing sublime which is not some modification of power." Furthermore, he sees terror as "the common stock of every thing that is sublime" (107). The diminishment of human presence is the most central feature of the sublime, as in experiences of God's presence: "But whilst we contemplate so vast an object, under the arm, as it were, of almighty power, and invested upon every side with omnipresence, we shrink into the minuteness of our own nature, and are, in a manner, annihilated before him" (111). For the writers I take up here, God does not come into it except insofar as nature takes on some of the attri- butes of God - certainly the numinous qualities and that of power - while conspicuously lacking others, most notably the slightest bit of providential concern. Indeed, Rudolf Otto invented the term "numinous" precisely "to stand for 'the holy' minus its moral factor or 'moment'" (6). Here we encounter an especially American aspect of this study: in Nature and Culture: American Landscape and Painting , 1825-1875 , Barbara Novak sees in nineteenth-century American sublime nature painting "a mystic abandonment of self which ultimately distinguishes the American transcendental landscapes from those which maintain an anthropomor- phic tie to the ego in the midst of spiritual experience" (43). These American painters show more of a retreat of the ego behind the thing than the German idealist, whose art became, in the twentieth century, the expressionist exaltation of the tragic self. Somehow this was attached not just to American pragma- tism (always less dramatic than the German) but to an American need to equate thing and Deity without symbolic intervention. When in German art symbol intervened, feeling and subjectivity could as well. Thus one may say that in America there was a more complete elimina- tion of ego. [. . .] Where the French had stressed means, the Americans stressed ends: where the Germans injected feeling, the Americans dis- tilled it to a more impersonal essence. (272-73) The American painters saw divinity reflected in nature, but it was "an overwhelming divinity, dwarfing the observer who, though he aspired to transcendence, rarely forgot his own insignificance" (34). Though Novak relates these responses to painting rather than to literature, I posit</page><page sequence="10">Representations of Nature in American Writing 227 the same tendency in the writers in my project, with some differenc- es: that their retreat from the ego is at times partial and even ironically equivocal, though they do show a positive ferocity toward its claims; that God drops out of the picture and it is nature per se that dwarfs and overwhelms the observer (or character); and that one can find the sublime response to nature even more in contemporary foreign film than in American movies. But, again, how does one evade the intrusion of the ego? There is a parallel in the philosopher Thomas Nagel' s attempt to find the "view from nowhere/' Though Nagel's subject is objectivity rather than nature, he, like my group of writers, sees that "we are small creatures in a big world of which we have only very partial understanding" (5) and has the same desire to regard the world "as it is": "That is the impulse to find a way of thinking about the world as it is, so that everything in it [. . .] can be regard- ed as real in the same way: not just as an aspect of the world as it appears to us, but something that is really there" (16). (Thoreau's language for this was " Contact ! Contact! Contact !" [Journal 1: 646].) Nagel acknowledges that taking in a world "that is not especially given to the human point of view [. . .] is a paradoxical enterprise" (18). He questions the orthodox academic skepticism of the possibility of objective perception: "The ambition to get outside of ourselves has obvious limits, but it is not always easy to know where they are or when they have been transgressed" (6). How then to find a language for our problematic perceptions of the world, given that one of the "most difficult tasks is to express unformed but intuitively felt problems in language without losing them?" (6). The language of the sublime is one route to this difficult end. In Maintaining the Sublime : Heidegger and Adorno , Jan Rosiek sees the sublime "as a response to something that challenges any given language" (13). It "emphasizes the threshold rather than the substance of what is beyond; it regards its bond with the metaphysical as a motion at the limit rather than as a warrant of an accessible beyond. There remains a basic uncer- tainty concerning this threshold, especially as to whether one has passed it or not" (15). Rosiek suggests "that we regard the sublime as a 'language game' [. . .] as a vocabulary which enables us to verbalize compelling ex- periences and queries that are neglected or explicitly abandoned by the prevalent modes of secularized modern thought" (15). Better yet, unlike [. . .] other genres or language-games [. . .] that of the sublime allows us to re-open the closed book on the relation between finitude and transcendence, to ponder and imagine the possible numinous qualities of in-human no-things, without forcing or even urging us to decide for or against philosophical doctrines, theological tenets and religious confessions of faith. (16)</page><page sequence="11">228 Anthony Channell Hilfer Rosiek's conception of the sublime relates to my writers, especially in that he emphasizes that "it remains of great importance to explore what occa- sions sublime writing, what it presents beyond itself" (103). That is, my study attends to the writing, the rhetoric, primarily for what it reveals about the desert, the mountain, the ocean. The writing of the natural sub- lime, unlike much current critically approved writing, looks out upon things, upon the world, more than in upon itself. It looks at "the question of nature," which, as Rosiek declares, "has been ignored, marginalized, neglected or repressed" (103). The writers in this study recognize and stra- tegically address the question of how to represent a nature that in many respects resists accurate representation. I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that the implicit politics, ethics, and even accuracy of the conception of the sublime as a quality transcendent of human concerns and found only in pristine, unhumanized natural sites have been strongly attacked. The very possibility of a pristine natural world is questionable. Some geographers, most notably William Denevan in "The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492," argue that the American landscape had been occupied and significantly altered by Native Americans before the arrival of the Europeans, and that only the horrific spread of European infections thinned out the landscape's human presence to where it appeared pristine. Denevan even declares that "a good argument can be made that the human presence was less visible in 1750 than it was in 1492" (369). Thomas Vale qualifies Denevan's argument in "The Myth of the Humanized Landscape," stating that "the pre- European landscape of the United States was not monolithically human- ized. Rather it was a patchwork, at varying scales, of pristine and humanized conditions" (234). Still, William Cronon's case in "The Trouble with Wilder- ness; Or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature" is more philosophical and more devastating than Denevan's. Building on his own and Denevan's evidence of Native American impingements on the land, he argues further that the very notion of untenanted wilderness is inherently contradictory: This then is the central paradox: wilderness embodies a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural. If we allow ourselves to believe that nature, to be true, must also be wild, then our very presence in nature represents its fall. The place where we are is the place where nature is not. (80-81) This indeed is the circle my writers are trying to square. Christopher Hitt, in a brilliant defense of the sublime, acknowledges that the sublime mode has also been accused by a Marxist critic of being "an instrument of the bourgeois subject" and by feminists of endorsing masculine power (603). Hitt notes that the celebrated Marxist Frances</page><page sequence="12">Representations of Nature in American Writing 229 Ferguson indicts the sublime as "the instrument for the production of in- dividuality" (604), which might not sound so bad until one realizes the extent to which individuality can impede a properly progressive society. In response, citing Kanťs recognition that "in experiencing the sublime we perceive 'our faculty of resistance as insignificantly small in comparison with nature's might/" Hitt reminds us that "humility before nature has consistently been an elementary part of the natural sublime" (606). Hitt defines the natural sublime as "a particular cultural and /or literary ex- pression of something that is indeed universal: human beings' encounters with a natural world whose power ultimately exceeds theirs" (609-10). Far from an endorsement of an oppressive culture, the natural sublime "de- pends on an experience of hyperbolic alienation, a sense of the inexorable otherness of nature" (612). Hitt admits that the discourse of the sublime is predicated on what in the academic world is the highly unfashionable notion that "unmediated experience might be possible" (614). To return to Rosiek's analysis, the sublime and its problematic can be seen to arise most urgently at times when the critical powers of the most advanced art and thought threaten the hegemony of the current religious and metaphysical orders or whatever was their modern substitute until the nineteen seventies - say, the metanarrative of necessary growth and progress common to bourgeois and Marxist ideologies. (10) The chastisement of the ego, a major aspect of the sublime, is unwelcome to both bourgeois consumer society and the anthropocentric neo-Marxist academic world. Thus, negative dialectics, negative theology, Burke's conception of the sublime, Otto's of the numinous, and Goethe's of the demoniac help unlock the rhetoric of how to speak nature's otherness. In sum, rather than attempting to render the term "Nature" transparent, I agree with the ecocritic Jonathan Bate that both the negations and affirmations of the con- ception of an actually existent entity we call nature suggest that "'Nature' is a term that needs to be contested, not rejected" (171). The new and burgeoning field of ecocriticism has much to offer the search for a philosophically valid approach to nature writing. A number of critics have taken up aspects of the argument I make in this study in relation to particular writers, such as Gyorgy Voros on Wallace Stevens, Dana Phillips on Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian (to the point that I summarize Phillips's brilliant essay rather than do an extended commen- tary on McCarthy), and various critics on Thoreau and Crane. Moreover, a number of ecocritics have also raised the questions I pursue. Alison Byerly declares, "The American idea of wilderness might seem closer to</page><page sequence="13">230 Anthony Channell Hilfer the aesthetic category of the sublime than to the picturesque" (53). Suellen Campbell notes that "ecology insists that we pay attention not to the way things have meaning for us, but to the way the rest of the world - the nonhuman part - exists apart from us and our languages" (133). Glen A. Love laments that "in the face of profound threats to our biological survival, we continue, in the proud tradition of humanism, to [. . .] 'love ourselves best of all/ to celebrate the self-aggrandizing ego and to place self-interest above public interest, even, irrationally enough, in matters of common survival" (226) - although I cannot claim my writers are greatly concerned with the public interest, or even matters of common survival (Paul Bowles! Cormac McCarthy!). Michael J. McDowell says that recent nature writers "try to divest themselves as much as possible of human preconceptions and enter the natural world almost as though they were animal participants; the animal participants often have equal representation with the narrators. Their hope, it appears, is to allow the landscape to enter them in order to be expressed through their writ- ing" (381). Finally, the first two qualities that Terry Gifford describes as fundamental to what he terms "post-pastoral" literature are as follows: "1. An awe in attention to the natural world; 2. The recognition of a creative-destructive universe equally in balance in a continuous momen- tum of birth and death, death and rebirth, growth and decay, ecstasy and dissolution" ("Pastoral" 221). These qualities are found in the post- Darwinian works that I examine, though in some instances with the emphasis on the more negative of Gifford's pairings. Wallace Stevens's "The Snow Man," the poem that gives this study its title, provides a particularly exemplary version of the problems and paradoxes involved in the attempt to represent nature naturally. Stevens's poem is a playfully profound response to the Victorian sage John Ruskin's condemnation of the "pathetic fallacy," the attribution of human feelings or motives to nature. Ruskin points out a passage from Charles Kingsley's poem "The Sands of Dee" ("They rowed her in across the rolling foam, / The cruel crawling foam"), tartly observing that "the foam is not cruel, nei- ther does it crawl" (155). Ruskin objects to philosophical idealism carrying over to poetry, declaring that subjective idealist philosophers deduce that it does not much matter what things are in themselves, but only what they are to us; and that the only real truth of them is their ap- pearance to, or effect upon, us. From which position, with a hearty desire for mystification, and much egotism, selfishness, shallowness, and impertinence, a philosopher may easily go so far as to believe, and say, that everything in the world depends upon his seeing or thinking of it, and that nothing, therefore, exists, but what he sees or thinks of. (152-53)</page><page sequence="14">Representations of Nature in American Writing 231 Stevens's poem tells us that "one must have a mind of winter /[...] not to think / Of any misery in the sound of the wind/' which is to say, one must resist the pathetic fallacy. He commends the listener who [. . .] listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. (54) The wind in "The Snow Man" is not miserable, and its observer should not be miserable in supposed empathy with it, even if he himself is half- frozen. Q.E.D. Yet "a mind of winter" is still a human way of seeing, if a more austere one than is usually found in nature poems. Moreover, like a poem, a snow- man is an artificial, human construction. The poem reflects the modernist aesthetic of its time, that of T. E. Hulme' s wish for "dry, hard, classical verse" that would displace what he contemptuously termed "the spilt religion" of romanticism (118). Hulme predicted, "The particular verse we are going to get will be cheerful, dry, and sophisticated" (137). Hulme wrote this in Speculations , published in 1924; Stevens's poem was published in 1921, so he was already there. Also predating Hulme, Eliot, in a 1921 essay, com- mended Andrew Marvell for his "wit: a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace" ( Essays 252). Such wit was conspicuous for its absence in nature poetry until the advent of Stevens and Robert Frost, not to mention William Carlos Williams. So the joke of "The Snow Man" is that, finally, one cannot get around the pathetic fallacy. Yet the poem does go in the direction of doing so, chilling out human presence to something at least approaching zero-degree reality, an empathy with Nature exhibited more as a profoundly felt absence than as a presence. It does this by explicitly repudiating pathos as a proper response; pathos would involve the error of beholding "some- thing that is not there." But the nothing that is has an evident sublimity, especially in its reduction of the human onlooker. Gyorgy Voros writes: When Stevens thought of seeing the "gold sun about the white sky / Without evasion by a single metaphor" or when he attended to "the cry of leaves that do not transcend themselves," what mesmerized him was the flickering presence of something wild, primordial, pre-Oedipal, preverbal. Indeed, he peered toward something yet more distant and elemental - pre-Adamic Nature unadorned by human conception, scoured of impastoed human meanings, unmediated, authentic, and whole. He wanted to write "The poem of pure reality, untouched." (7) I would add that the only way Stevens could approach this was through the metaphor of nothingness. But Voros is right in that Stevens</page><page sequence="15">232 Anthony Channeil Hilfer was trying to get at what is left after you slough off the residue of the cultural apparatus. Robert Frost had his go at the pathetic fallacy in "The Need of Being Versed in Country Things." One has to be versed in country things not to be- lieve the phoebes wept at the pathos of a burnt and abandoned farmhouse: For them there was nothing really sad. But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept, One had to be versed in country things Not to believe the phoebes wept. (300) As observer and poet, Frost is versed in country things and tough- minded enough to be as immune to pathos as the quite comfortable birds that have adapted to an ideal nest. In "Lucretius versus the Lake Poets," Frost gives a pre-Christian and post-Darwinian answer to the question of what nature poetry (as in that of Wordsworth and Coleridge, the Lake Poets) can be when one distinguishes between Nature as merely "Pretty Scenery" and Nature as "the whole Goddam Machinery" (558). All of the writers in this study have in common an aversion to the unproblematically beautiful as opposed to the sublime and paradoxical. I have ranged so far afield in this introductory section because my intent here is not so much to examine the writers for what they reveal of themselves or their culture, but for what they reveal about the deserts, the mountains, the ocean. I hope to show in them an authentic as well as para- doxical response to the problematic nature of Nature. This response cannot precisely be called a philosophy; it is not so thought-out in generalized terms. It is more a tendency, or, to use a now-superseded term from the old New Criticism, a sensibility, defined by M. H. Abrams as "a characteristic way of responding, in perception, thought, and feeling, to experience" (282). We find this tendency, this sensibility, almost expressed as a philosophy in what Robinson Jeffers called "Inhumanism." Many of the perceptions and attitudes of the writers in this study can be found forthrightly stated, sometimes with an almost comical asperity, in Jeffers' s letters and verse, though to me Jeffers's poetry - especially his long, didactic, and melodra- matic pieces such as "Roan Stallion" - is less compelling than his visionary philosophy of nature as expressed primarily in his letters and other prose. Like the other writers I discuss, Jeffers preferred the outward to the inner, human world: "Don't you think too much human energy goes back into humanity; and the farmers who subdue the earth, the scientists who wid- en horizons, even the merely contemplative person admiring mountains have chosen a better way? They lived outward" ( Selected Letters , hereafter L, 59). More expansively, he declared,</page><page sequence="16">Representations of Nature in American Writing 233 I don't think industrial civilization is worth the distortion of human nature and the meanness and loss of contact with the earth, that it entails. [. . .] Civilization will have to go on building up for centuries yet, and its collapse will be gradual and tragic and sordid, and I have no remedy to propose, except for the individual to keep himself out of it as much as he can. (L 104) Human egoism repels Jeffers: It seems to me wasteful that almost the whole of human energy is expanded inward, on itself, in loving, hating, governing, cajoling, amusing, its own members. It is like a newborn babe, conscious al- most exclusively of its own processes and where its food comes from. As the child grows up its attention must be drawn from itself to the more important world outside it. (L 159) He wants to "let in the inhuman mind of the world [. . .] to obliterate [the] human one" (L 184). Jeffers's taste in landscape is for the harsh as opposed to the edenic, as evidenced in his response to an English garden village: "The earth is so civilized and acquiescent and pitifully smiling in England" (L 158). Wonderfully, he comments, "I've decided I don't like trees, they make the landscape so soft and fluffy" (L 158). The Big Sur country is composed of sterner stuff, as in Jeffers's description of the titular subject of his poem "Point Alma Venus": "The story grows rather intimately from the rock of this coast. Someone said to me lately that it is not possible to be quite sane here, many others feel a hostility of the region to human life" (L 68). In general, "existence would be a rather shallow affair without non-existence to back it up" (L 29). Jeffers believes in a deity, but neither the Christian nor the fuzzily benign new-age God will do. The heroine of "Roan Stallion" half- consciously identifies her horse with a deity, "first with the God she had heard religious stories about, the Conception and so forth; and then with a more real God - not a human invention but the energy that is the uni- verse" (L 39). Jeffers's natural world has agency, power. He believes in an almost animistic way in "the feeling of deep earnestness and nobility in natural objects and in the universe: - these are human qualities, not mineral or vegetable, but it seems to me I would not impute them into the objects unless there were something in not-man that corresponds to the qualities in man" (L 263). He believes, as Nagel put it, in the natu- ral world "not just as an aspect of the world as it appears to us, but something that is really there" (16). This world perceives things, even us perhaps:</page><page sequence="17">234 Anthony Channeil Hilfer [. . .] the high still rocks Stood in the canyon sea-mouth alert and patient, waiting a sign per- haps. ( Selected Poetry , hereafter P, 593) Jeffers highly values solitude - Abbey's masterpiece is Desert Solitaire - and has a totem creature, the hawk; these motifs combine in one image in "The Inhumanist": "Old men and gray hawks need solitude" (P 592). (There are also the lyric poems "Hurt Hawks," "Give Your Heart to the Hawks," "The Cruel Falcon," and "Rock and Hawk.") All this is daring but not easily definable, or even expressible, as Jeffers acknowledges: It is the life. Which is like beauty. It is like nobility. It has no name - and that's lucky, for names Foul in the mouthing. (P 596) I believe Jeffers's most profound statement is, "But still remains the end- less inhuman beauty of things" (P 617). This inhuman beauty is what I find in the writings I explore in this study.</page><page sequence="18">Representations of Nature in American Writing 235 2. Rhetoric and the Real in Mount Ktaadn's Encounter with Thoreau Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau' s mentor, is now seen by ecologically in- clined critics as the less powerful thinker and writer of the two. Emerson's early work "Nature" (1836) does offer a general definition of the term that still holds up to our usage: "Strictly speaking [. . .] all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men and my own body, must be ranked under this name, NATURE." He adds, "Nature, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by man; space, the air, the river, the leaf" (8). As Raymond Williams notes in Keywords , since the eighteenth century "nature is what man has not made" (188). So Emerson's definition seems unexceptional, until we see where he goes with it. Over the course of his essay, Emerson's ME proceeds to incorporate nature, the NOT ME, into itself, essentially pounding nature into a pulp. It may be true that in Emerson's nature "all mean egotism vanishes" (10), but what finally displaces mean egotism is grandiose egotism. First we have the National Park view of nature: "To the body and mind which have been cramped by noxious work or company, nature is medicinal and restores their tone. The tradesman, the attorney comes out of the din and craft of the street, and sees the sky and the woods, and is a man again. In their eternal calm he finds himself. The health of the eye seems to demand a horizon" (14-15). This is true enough, as I and a great many others can attest in our experiences of nature.1 But it leads to a slippery slope - nature as an outdoor museum, "a picturesque commodi- ty" (Byerly 59), which is an idea antithetical to the deep ecology view "that nature possesses the same moral standing and natural rights as human beings" (Byerly 63). Ultimately, down this slippery slope a snowmobile may be sliding, giving tonic as well as possibly gin to the tradesman and corporate lawyer. Admittedly, Emerson, as always, elsewhere contradicts many of these views, though ultimately, at best, his concept of nature leads to what Arne Naess, the originator of the deep ecology school of thought, termed "shal- low ecology , essentially a resource-management approach predicated on the values of efficiency and utility" (Naess in Oelschlager, 208). This is as opposed to " deep ecology, which transcends conservation in favor of preservation and biocentric values" (Oelschlager 208). The writers in this section were in the spirit of deep ecology before the term came into use. The treacherous aspect of Emerson's nature is most obvious in his sec- tion entitled "Commodity." Expatiating on the uses of nature, he declares, "The misery of man appears like childish petulance, when we explore the steady and prodigal provision that has been made for his support and de- light on this green ball which floats him through the heavens" (13). Nature has a "ministry to man [. . .] All parts work incessantly into each other's</page><page sequence="19">236 Anthony Channell Hilfer hands for the profits of man" (12). This is a thinly disguised version of the Christian providence that Lynn White Jr., in an influential essay, argues is the historical route of our ecological crisis: "Man named all the animals, thus establishing his dominance over them. God planned all of this explic- itly for man's benefit and rule; no item in the physical creation had any purpose save to serve man's purposes" (9). Emerson's detestation of the moneymakers of his world was well known, so he hustles through this section with a palpable discomfort, ending with a justification for avoiding (embarrassing) particulars: But there is no need of specifying particulars in this class of uses. The catalogue is endless, and the examples so obvious, that I shall leave them to the reader's reflection, with the general remark, that this mer- cenary benefit is one which has respect to a farther good. A man is fed, not that he may be fed, but that he may work. (13) If the reader were a land developer, imagine how easily the endless cata- logue of particulars could be filled out. My view of Emerson may seem overstated until one comes across his passage commending the man who "takes up the world into himself" (16). Just what this means is suggested by an 1840 entry from Emerson's journal: "I dreamed that I floated at will in the great Ether, and I saw this world floating also not far off, but diminished to the size of an apple. Then an angel took it in his hand &amp; brought it to me and said 'This must thou eat.' And I ate the world" (74). The meaning is clear: an ingestion of the NOT ME by the ME. Emerson, as brilliantly argued by Quentin Anderson, was an inven- tor as well as chief exemplar of the American "imperial self" (Anderson passim). In Emerson, "our prime business is no longer imagined as either generation or action, but, ultimately, an exhibition of the power of the self to image the world it has incorporated" (Anderson 14). The writings in this study are about limits of the self; Emerson is all about "the infinitude of the private man" (Emerson in Anderson, 29). Emerson avoids making his inner drama "visibly subject to an outer world, and to the conditions of growth and decay. He must war on particularity" (43). Anderson's critique is directed at Emerson's negation of society rather than of nature. For Anderson, the problem of the imperial self is "the Amer- ican flight from culture, from the institutions and emotional dispositions of associated life" (3). In this respect most of the writers in this study could be accused of being imperial selves, as they share a common abhorrence of the society they were born into. Where they differ from the Emersonian impe- rial self is in their respect for the limits that nature, as opposed to society, presents to the self. Anderson says of Emerson that "the social world was</page><page sequence="20">Representations of Nature in American Writing 237 not for him either a home or a significant and threatening other with which we enjoy a dialectical relation, or in whose denial we affirm ourselves" (32). For most of my writers the social world was a threat, the denial of which allowed them to affirm themselves. The greatest threat of the social world, however, was not to the self but to the natural world, which for them was the social world's dialectical opposition. The natural world provided a wel- come limit to their own selfhood, keeping it from becoming imperial. One value of Nature is precisely its resistance to the social and the human. In contrast, Emerson's nature is constituted by "perfectness and har- mony" (18), which is not the view of Stephen Crane, Charles Bowden, Paul Bowles, or, for that matter (pun intended) Henry David Thoreau. And of Emerson's finding of "Truth, and goodness, and beauty" (19), only truth might be affirmed as a valid quality of nature by these writers, and even then might be qualified by epistemological and other doubts. The assur- ance in "Nature" that "fact is the end or last issue of spirit" (25) might not survive a trip to the Sonora or Sahara desert, or Kekexili, or the outback. Emerson's dictum that "man's victorious thought comes up with and re- duces all things" (28) suggests a world pureed into a Gerber's concoction. "The ethical character" that "so penetrates the bone and marrow of nature" (28) is not apparent in Blood Meridian or The Sheltering Sky; nor does the world of these novels seem "the present expositor of the divine mind" (42). My view of Thoreau, I should acknowledge, differs from those of such scholars as Richard Slotkin and Louise Westling. Westling avers that Thoreau, like Emerson, "was not as interested in a particular place as he was in seeking to use his experiences as rhetoric, 'for the sake of tropes and expression'" (148; Westling's embedded Thoreau quotation is from Waiden). While Waiden has its ferocious moments too, "Walking," passages from Thoreau's journal, and the "Ktaadn" section of The Maine Woods are Thoreau's most notable wilderness moments; they are a rebuke to Westling's condemnatory analysis of Waiden in that the tropes and ex- pression are for the sake of exploring the particular place. With Thoreau, along with other writers in this study, the question is of both/ and rather than either/ or. Whereas Emerson's nature is medicinal, harmonious, and transparent, Thoreau finds his "tonics" ("Walking" 239) in "absolute free- dom and wilderness" ("Walking" 234). His ideal sites are those found in the other writings and films of this study: "If it were proposed to me to dwell in the most beautiful garden that ever human art contrived, or else of a Dismal Swamp, I should certainly decide for the swamp" ("Walking" 241-42). Thoreau catalogues his privileged sites: "My spirits infallibly rise in proportion to the outward dreariness. Give me the ocean, the desert, or the wilderness!" ("Walking" 242). This could read as the table of con- tents for my study. Here is Thoreau's recreational restorative: "When I would re-create myself, I seek the darkest wood, the thickest and most</page><page sequence="21">238 Anthony Channeil Hilfer interminable and, to the citizen, most dismal swamp. I enter a swamp as a sacred place, - a sanctum sanctorum. There is the strength, the marrow of nature" ("Walking" 242). I take "sacred" literally; these are spiritual sites for Thoreau, where by finding the marrow of things, "the raw material of life" ("Walking" 241), he can be reborn, "re-create" himself. This religion is obviously not Christianity, but rather is closer to animism, as expressed in The Maine Woods : I believed that the woods were not tenantless, but chokefull of honest spirits as good as myself any day, - not an empty chamber, in which chemistry was left to work alone, but an inhabited house, - and for a few moments I enjoyed fellowship with them. Your so-called wise man goes trying to persuade himself that there is no entity but himself and his traps, but it is a great deal easier to believe the truth. It sug- gested, too, that the same experience always gives birth to the same sort of belief or religion. (732) Lynn White Jr. argues the superiority of animism to orthodox Christianity as a nature ethos: In Antiquity every tree, every spring, every stream, every hill had its own genius loci , its guardian spirit. These spirits were accessible to men, but very unlike men; centaurs, fauns, and mermaids show their ambivalence. Before one cut a tree, mined a mountain, or dammed a brook, it was important to placate the spirit in charge of that particu- lar situation, and to keep it placated. By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indiffer- ence to the feelings of most objects. (10) Thoreau, of course, experienced nature less anthropomorphically and with even greater respect for independent existence than did these animists. First, though, there is the question of how one gets close enough to the spirits in the woods to establish fellowship with them. One can do this, Thoreau demonstrates, by immersion in the spirit of place via its par- ticular thinginess. And one can establish fellowship with animals via a sympathy that borders on identification. Take Thoreau' s journal passage of December 10, 1840: "I discover a strange track in the snow, and learn that some migrating otter has made across from the river to my wood [. . .] in the silence of the night." A moral is drawn: "Such an incident as this startles me with the assurance that the primeval nature is still working and makes tracks in the snow" (1: 200). Nature here does seem headed toward becoming a language, a trope that does turn up in Thoreau, perhaps a bit too patly in this instance. However, the ultimate difference between self</page><page sequence="22">Representations of Nature in American Writing 239 and its languages and the utterly otter is illuminated by a moment of guilt about turf dispossession: "It is my own fault that he must thus skulk across my premises by night. Now I yearn toward him, and heaven to me consists in a complete communion with the otter nature" (1: 200). The yearning expresses the distance even as the desire for communion is heartfelt. Thoreau comes closer yet to a fox by walking a mile in its paw prints, prints that become a text. The fox's textuality is more distinctly foxy than the otter's was otterly: Here is the distinct trail of a fox stretching a quarter of a mile across the pond. Now I am curious to know what has determined its grace- ful curvatures, its greater or less spaces and distinctness, and how surely they were coincident with the fluctuations of some mind, why they now lead two steps to the right, and then three to the left. If these things are not to be called up and accounted for in the Lamb's Book of Life, I shall set them down for careless accountants. Here was one expression of the divine mind this morning. (1: 240) The accounting of the fox is implicitly compared to Christian moral accoun- tancy ("the Lamb's Book of Life"), but for Thoreau a proper accountancy would not be a moral scrutiny of the fox's predatory misdeeds but rather a celebratory account of its verve and swerve. The fox is an author of note: "The pond was his journal, and last night's snow made a tabula rasa for him. I know which way a mind wended this morning, what horizon it faced by the setting of these tracks - whether it moved slowly or rapidly, by the greater or lesser intervals and distinctness - for the swiftest step leaves yet a lasting trace" (1: 240). All this about the fox is from a journal entry of January 30, 1841; clearly Thoreau is taking literary instruction for his journal from the fox, wanting to record which way a mind wended, whether it moved slowly or rapidly, or swerved to the right and left, and also wanting to embed these movements into the swerves of his prose. This section of the journal could be seen as collaboration, and had Thoreau published it, the fox might have been acknowledged as coauthor. Thoreau then, in a remarkable tour de force, transmutes into a fox- hound springing into both the fox's world and the pagan one: So yielding to the instinct of the chase, I tossed my head aloft, and bounded away, snuffing the air like a fox hound; and spurning the world and humane society at every bound. It seemed like the woods rang with the hunter's horn, and Diana and all the satyrs joined in the chase, and cheered me on. Olympian and Elian youths were waving palms on the hills - In the meantime I gained rapidly on the fox, but he showed a remarkable presence of mind, for instead of keeping up</page><page sequence="23">240 Anthony Channell Hilfer the face of the hill which was steep and unwooded in that part, he kept along the slope in the direction of the forest, though he lost ground by it. Notwithstanding his fright he took no step which was not beauti- ful - The course on his part was a series of most graceful curves. It was a sort of leopard canter, I should say, as if he were no-wise impeded by the snow, but was husbanding his strength all the while. He ran as though there were not a bone in his back, occasionally dropping his muzzle to the snow for a rod or two, and then tossing his head aloft when satisfied of his course. When he came to a declivity he put his forefeet together and slid down it like a cat. He trod so softly that you could not have heard it from any nearness, and yet with such expres- sion, that it would not have been inaudible at any distance. (1: 241^12) This passage is a triumph of description as well as of identification with the natural world as opposed to human society. Thoreau snuffs the air, tosses his head, and bounds, if not a fox at least a foxhound. Moreover the description of the fox's flight, standing in for nature's flight from our imaginative possession, becomes a bravura performance as much on the fox's part as on Thoreau's. This is one way of tracking nature and is indeed almost consubstantial with foxiness. Thoreau's spontaneous pursuit of foxiness is analogous to the Pawnee identification with wolves that the nature writer Barry Lopez has de- scribed. The Pawnees sometimes put wolf skins over their heads and were called wolves by other tribes. Lopez argues that the sense of being Wolf that came over a Pawnee scout was not the automatic result of putting on a wolf skin. The wolf skin was an ac- coutrement, an outward sign to the man himself and others who might see him that he was calling on his wolf power. It is hard for the Western mind to grasp this and to take seriously the notion that an Indian at times could be Wolf, could actually participate in the ani- mal's spirit, but this is what happened. It wasn't being like a wolf; it was having the mindset: Wolf. (111-12) Thoreau was exercising his foxiness. Another mode of connection is evident in Thoreau's ironic imagining of a naturalized version of baptism in his journal entry of June 16, 1840. Like some Baptists, he wants total immersion: "Would it not be a luxury to stand up to one's chin in some retired swamp for a whole summer's day, scenting the sweet fern and bilberry blows, and lulled by the min- strelsy of gnats and mosquitoes?" (1: 129). Still another impulse toward participation in the wild comes from Waiden : "As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite</page><page sequence="24">Representations of Nature in American Writing 241 dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize him and devour him raw; not that I was hungry, except for that wildness he represented" (490). The desire recurs in "Walking": "The Hottentots eagerly devour the marrow of the koodoo and other antelopes raw, a mat- ter of course. Some of our Northern Indians eat other parts, including the summits of the antlers, as long as they are soft. Give me a wildness whose glance no civilization can endure, - as if we lived on the marrow of koodoos devoured raw" (239-40). The woodchuck murder fantasy and raw koodoo devouring seems rather extreme, especially from someone who in Waiden declared meat eating to be unclean. Yet Thoreau was enough of a classicist to know that the Greeks saw "raw eating" as a dividing line between civilization and barbarism (Redfield 197-99) and wants to make his choice of the latter clear. It is part of a drive toward the bedrock reality Thoreau sought from his early life onward, a recurrent moment in his works: he would front the essential facts and suck all the marrow out of life through a wilderness en- counter. Moreover, Thoreau is playfully parodying the Christian concept of communion, taking it back to its pagan origin of imbibing the spirit of an animal by eating its flesh. This brings us to a signature moment in Thoreau: Mount Ktaadn' s en- counter with him. There is a question as to whether this was an ontological moment, a recognition of a reality, or, as various critics have persuasively argued,2 a rhetorical moment, a playing out of traditional tropes. I want to come down on both sides of this question while recognizing that the two views are, logically speaking, incommensurable. I will first address the en- counter as Thoreau described it in "Ktaadn," a section mostly drawn from his journal of September 1846 that was published as an essay in Union magazine and then posthumously published in The Maine Woods. I will begin with how this encounter reflects a conventional roman- tic conception of nature and is framed through the conventions of the sublime. From the perspective of Emerson's Nature as the NOT ME, refer- ring to "essences unchanged by man: space, the air, the river, the leaf," Thoreau' s Nature is awesomely primal, originary. In Thoreau' s account of his ascent of Ktaadn he sees the loose rocks of the mountain as "the raw materials of a planet dropped from an unseen quarry, which the vast chemistry of nature would anon work up, or work down, into the smiling and verdant plains and valleys of earth. This was an undone extremity of the globe; as in lignite, we see coal in the process of formation" ( Maine Woods 639-40). So this is a kind of myth of origins, although, significantly, it leaves out man, and Nature in this part of Maine has not been processed into verdant plains. It is indeed antithetical to the Garden of Eden and does not welcome Thoreau. It is frightening in a sublime fashion:</page><page sequence="25">242 Anthony Channell Hilfer Nature was here something savage and awful, though beautiful. I looked with awe at the ground I trod on, to see what the Powers had made there, the form and fashion and material of their work. This was that earth of which we have heard, made out of Chaos and Old Night. Here was no man's garden, but the unhandseled globe. Man was not to be associated with it. It was Matter, vast, terrific, - not his Mother Earth that we have heard of [. . .] the home this of Necessity and Fate. There was clearly felt the presence of a force not bound to be kind to man. (645) Notably, while rejecting one personification, Mother Earth, Thoreau imports four more, all capitalized, to be the creators and tenants of his ver- sion of nature: Chaos and Old Night, borrowed from Milton, and Necessity and Fate, indirectly borrowed from Aeschylus. In the journal there is even a deity, displacing and antithetical to Mother Earth: "Pomola whom the Penobscot consider as the evil genius of the mt - or God in his angry mood is ever angry at he who climbs there" (2: 340). Pomola is more usually called Pamola, though both names are derivatives of Bahmolai, a name that has been translated as "He curses on the Mountain" (Pinder 66). Thoreau has Pomola ask him, "Why seek me where I have not called you and then com- plain I am not your genial mother?" (2: 340). He invokes a hostile male god as the resident spirit of the region, in opposition to a reassuring female one. The mountain is demonic, in Goethe's terms: "Coming down the Mt perhaps I first most fully realized that this was unhandseled and ancient Demonic Nature, natura, or whatever man has named it" (2: 278). In a brilliant es- say on "Ktaadn," John Tallmedge glosses the Thoreauvian word "handsel": "To 'handsel' something is to inaugurate it by means of a gift or ceremony. To say that the earth was handseled, then, is to say it had been readied for meaningful use and bestowed upon us by its creator. Conversely, an un- handseled nature would embody no covenant between human beings and God" (144). Pomola's point exactly. For Thoreau, then, nature has the con- tradictions as well as the sublimity of Goethe's conception. Thoreau glories in, rather than complains about, the fearsome aspect of Ktaadn because it is a prime instance of what Burke defined as the sub- lime. In a schoolboy essay on Burke's sublime, Thoreau rejected fear as a necessary component; by "Ktaadn" he had clearly come around to it. Farther on in The Maine Woods Thoreau says of some rapids, "There was really danger of their losing their sublimity in losing their power to harm us" (649). Perhaps Ktaadn had brought him to this acknowledgment: Aeschylus had no doubt visited such scenery as this. It was vast, titanic, and such as man never inhabits. Some part of the beholder, even some vital part, seems to escape through the loose grating of his ribs as he as-</page><page sequence="26">Representations of Nature in American Writing 243 cends. He is more lone than you can imagine. There is less of substantial thought and fair understanding in him, than in the plains where men inhabit. His reason is dispersed and shadowy, more thin and subtle, like the air. Vast, Titanic, inhuman Nature has got him at a disadvan- tage, caught him alone, and pilfers him of his divine capacity. (640) This may sound like recoil from nature, except that what Thoreau seeks in nature is self-evacuation. Of going to Waiden, he says in his journal, "It will be a success if I have left myself behind" (1: 347). Let me be precise here. This is not a question of humility, not one of Thoreau's strong points. Rather it is a need to get beyond the clamor of the always already social- ized ego, a recurrent theme for the writers I address. Arguably Christianity, except in its most Franciscan or Calvinist incarnations, encourages egoism, especially as over against the natural world. So Thoreau's was a fortunate fall out of the Christian dispensation as he came to worship other sublime presences, "where as man is not, we suppose some other power to be. My imagination personified the slopes themselves" ( Maine Woods 734). To sum up, one could, on the evidence of the passages above, fairly accuse Thoreau of major ecological solecisms: personifications of nature, pathetic fallacies, and reducing the natural world to the aesthetic category of the sublime. Yet through all these conventions Thoreau at least ap- proached an authentic relation to Nature, a word we can hardly use, as hinted at in the beginning of this discourse, without some element of personification. Thoreau may really have met "some hard matter in its home," perhaps a Titan and perhaps the bedrock reality for which he quested: "What is this Titan that has possession of me? Talk of mysteries! - Think of our life in nature, - daily to be shown matter, to come in con- tact with it, - rocks, trees, wind on our cheeks! The solid earth! The actual world! The common sensel Contact! Contact! Contact !" (646). The "Contact! Contact ! Contact!" moment is recurrent in the kind of nature writing I examine as much through parallel experiences as through influence and intertextuality. Robert Frost's "To Earthward" has both; it plays on Thoreau and has an intensity all Frost's own. It begins with the instant sensitivity of Youth: Love at the lips was touch as sweet as I could bear; And once that seemed too much; I lived on air That crossed me from sweet things The flow of - was it musk From hidden grapevine springs Down hill at dusk?</page><page sequence="27">244 Anthony Channell Hilfer Later, his sensations dulled, the speaker needs stronger stimuli: When stiff and sore and scarred I take away my hand From leaning on it hard In grass and sand, The hurt is not enough; I long for weight and strength To feel the earth as rough To all my length. (279-82) Such a response is just as historically mediated for Thoreau as it is for Frost. Both certainly participate in a romanticist anxiety about the loss of direct contact with nature that goes back at least to Wordsworth's fear of losing a childhood intimacy with the natural in "Ode on Intimations of Immortality." The anxiety is also expressed in Wordsworth's lament in "The World Is Too Much with Us": "Little we see in Nature that is ours" (224). Until Wordsworth lapsed to Anglicanism, he had the same attraction to pagan animism as did Thoreau: [. . .] I'd rather be A pagan suckled in a creed outworn; So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn. (224) Thoreau both quotes and goes beyond Wordsworth in his joy of discovering a hitherto unknown natural phenomenon in The Maine Woods : "I exulted like 'a pagan suckled in a creed' that had never been worn at all, but was bran [Thoreau's spelling] new, and adequate to the occasion" (731). Clearly he sees the spirits of the woods as still accessible, though not providential. Moreover, Thoreau abjured pleasant leas. Robert Faggen's description of Frost in Robert Frost and the Challenge of Darwin as "subversive of congenial conceptions of nature" (7) holds equally true for Thoreau. In another persuasive reading of the Contadi passage, Tallmedge argues that the very contortions of Thoreau's rhetoric play out the problem of representation: The "contact!" passage deals not only with nature, but also how to write about nature. Thoreau alerts us to this issue when he speaks of " Nature , or whatever else men call it." Here he clearly questions not just the concept of nature but the name we give it and the act of</page><page sequence="28">Representations of Nature in American Writing 245 naming itself. This reality can be tamed neither physically nor imagi- natively: the "hard matter" at issue is not merely the crust of the earth but also the resistant subject matter of experience itself, that is, the raw material of travel and nature writing. As the passage rushes to- ward its conclusion, Thoreau's normally pliant syntax becomes brittle and disjointed, finally breaking apart into ejaculatory fragments. We feel, with a twinge of panic, that our narrator is losing control of his material. Language seems to be failing him. (145) The point is not that Ktaadn is less real to Thoreau; rather, it is more real than any language can adequately convey. It should be clear that Thoreau' s first-person speaker is not simply himself; he is in the classical and medieval rhetorical tradition enunciated by Jan Swearingen, in which the "I" was not alone a self but a rhetorical persona designed to persuade and teach. Swearingen explains that Augustine's confessional and teacherly "I" [. . .] represents the emo- tional and spiritual ecstasis that can only be recollected in tranquility. It can only and should only be composed and written through the hindsight of reflection, according to doctrines of composition and per- formance that were shared to an extent by Augustine and Sappho. But performed and enacted the words become again their expressive or spiritual experience at the moment of expression. (152, my italics) What was especially strong for Thoreau was Ktaadn's encounter with him. I phrase it so because, as in some other ecoliterary encounters, the agency appears reversed from our usual assumption. Take a parallel in- stance, brilliantly analyzed in Jennifer Ballenger's essay "The Figure of the Invisible," which begins with a suggestive quote from Rilke: "It is our task to imprint this temporary, perishable earth into ourselves so deeply, so painfully and passionately, that its essence can rise again, 'invisibly,' inside us" (314). Ballenger cites the line "often a star / was waiting for you to notice it" (315) from the first Duino elegy, and from the eighth, With all its eyes the natural world looks out Into the Open. Only our eyes are turned backward. (322) Ballenger glosses this via Merleau-Ponty' s phenomenological description of "a call of the visible for attention" (316). As Thoreau said in his journal, "Go not to the object let it come to you" (5: 344). Ballenger observes that "for Merleau-Ponty, it is the artist [. . .] who strives to see the object as it gives itself to be seen" (316); she later cites Maurice Blanchot as declaring</page><page sequence="29">246 Anthony Channell Hilfer that "language names in silence and by silence and makes of the name a silent reality" (qtd. in Ballenger 333). Ktaadn, I would argue, drawing from Blanchot, is an instance of "where, in the midst of absence, everything speaks" (qtd. in Ballenger 333). This is paradoxical - Thoreau believed that "the truth is always para- doxical" (1: 143). In an 1841 journal entry, Thoreau commended Hindu thought for a kind of thinking in absence, a version of negative theology: "The very indistinctness of its theogony - implies a sublime truth. The divinity is so fleeting that its attributes are never expressed" (1: 325). In 1842 he observes, "I was always conscious of sounds in nature which my ears could never hear - that I caught but the prelude to a strain - She always retreats as I advance" (1: 365). This problem seems inherent in the always necessary, never quite successful, attempt to identify with nature and become consubstantial with . . . with what? We have already seen in Raymond Williams and Darwin that the very word "Nature" is a conun- drum. In Waiden Thoreau says that "Nature puts no question and answers none which we mortals ask" (547). Is then identification with Nature - or anything - an impossibility? Kenneth Burke in A Rhetoric of Motives argues for "identifications in the order of love" and that "a doctrine of consubstantiality, either explicit or implicit, may be necessary to any way of life" (20-21), while acknowledging that identification implies division, a dialectic that runs through "Ktaadn" in both the fox and Ktaadn epipha- nies. In "Worpswede" Rilke saw that "landscape is foreign to us, and we are fearfully alone amongst trees which blossom and by streams which flow" (408). He declares, "She knows nothing of us" (408), while personi- fying "her" via gendering and by having her do a star turn soliciting our attention in the first of the Duino elegies. Thoreau plays again with paradox and the demonic in the loon section of the "Brute Neighbors" chapter of Waiden. Paddling along on Waiden Pond, Thoreau hears the loon's "wild laughter" (509). He paddles in the loon's general direction but the loon "maneuvered so cunningly" (510) that he couldn't get close to him: "He led me at once to the wildest part of the pond and could not be driven from it. While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine" (510). Thoreau's attempt epitomizes the problem of trying to think nature. The loon does not need to think nature because it is nature. In effect, Nature laughs off Thoreau's effort to track it: His usual note was this demoniac laughter [. . .] but occasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn and unearthly howl, probably more like a wolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This was his looning, - perhaps the wildest</page><page sequence="30">Representations of Nature in American Writing 247 sound that is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. (511) Like some Heisenbergian particle, the more the bird is looked for the less can its location be divined. It is an emblem of the wild, partaking of wolfian as well as ornithological traits. Paradoxically, Thoreau has represented na- ture's unrepresentability without belying the loony qualities of the loon. In Thoreau' s writing, as Alan Hodder observed, "subjectivity is al- most entirely subdued in matter" (65). And, as noted in section Î, Sharon Cameron saw in Thoreau "nature writing itself" (47), and that in his writ- ing, "things noncommittally reveal what they are" (79).</page><page sequence="31">248 Anthony Channell Hilfer 3. Nature as Protagonist in "The Open Boat" The bottom of the sea is cruel. - Hart Crane, "Voyages" As many critics have argued, questions of perspective and epistemology are central to Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat" (Kent; Hutchinson). The story's first sentence famously clues us to this: "None of them knew the color of the sky" (68). But behind the uncertainties of perspective is a determinable ontology, a presence, or rather, I shall argue, a sort of presence, the existence of which implies a rectified aesthetic response. This response emerges, how- ever, from negations, denials, and occultations: what is not seen, who is not there, and what does not happen.3 Here again, when we look at nature we behold things that are not there and miss "the nothing that is." Fully as much as Stevens in "The Snow Man," Crane is concerned with certain conventions of representation: personification, the pictur- esque, the American sublime, and the melodramatic, which although it does not inform "The Snow Man" is played on in Stevens's "The Ameri- can Sublime." Crane's story is intertextual with nature poetry, sentimental poetry, hymns, and landscape art, as well as with Darwinism, theological clichés, and, less obviously, theological actualities. For the most part these conventions add up to what the Stevens poem declares is "not there." To get to "the nothing that is" we must first traverse this ocean of error. Doing so helps keep our perspective not on the men in the boat but on the "real" (with the scare quotes actually meant to be scary) ocean. If the story is at least as much about Nature as about men in nature, if nature is a central character in the story, then one of the story's central questions is how to see nature from a natural rather than human perspective. In a passage in section 1 of "The Open Boat" the sea is depicted in an orgy of hyperbolic personifications: A singular disadvantage of the sea lies in the fact that after successfully surmounting one wave you discover there is another behind it just as important and just as nervously anxious to do something effective in the way of swamping boats. In a ten-foot dinghy one can get an idea of the resources of the sea in the line of waves that is not probable to the average experience, which is never at sea in a dinghy. As each slaty wall of water approached, it shut out all else from the view of the men in the boat, and it was not difficult to imagine that this particular wave was the final outburst of the ocean, the last effort of the grim water. (69) Nature here has malign intent, being "nervously anxious to do something effective in the way of swamping boats." Nature has more agency, and an</page><page sequence="32">Representations of Nature in American Writing 249 agency more primary, than that of the men in the boat, who are merely in a reactive relation to the waves. In the final section of the story the cor- respondent is shown in an ironically passive relation to his own survival: Then the correspondent performed his one little marvel of the voyage. A large wave caught him and flung him with ease and supreme speed completely over the boat and far beyond it. It struck him even then as an event in gymnastics and a true miracle of the sea. An overturned boat in the surf is not a plaything to a swimming man. (91) As J. C. Levenson precisely observes, "Though the correspondent may be said ambiguously to have performed his little marvel, the wave and not the man has controlled the event" (lxv). In the men's apprehension the waves are making an "effort" to kill them, threateningly "snarling" at them, the water "grim" in its resolve (69). Yet the heightened emotions attributed to Nature are rhetorically offset by the understated, calcula- tedly stilted, legalistic language of "a singular disadvantage" and "do something effective in the way of." Crane is squaring the circle, on the one hand showing Nature as an effective presence and agency and on the other mocking the all-too-human tendency to personify nature by means of the pathetic fallacy. In effect, nature has presence and agency, but when we attempt to describe it, we fall into a ludicrous anthropocen- trism. And, finally, Crane is raising the question of justice - is Nature's ascribed malice actionable? Earlier in section 1 we were told that "these waves were most wrongfully and barbarously abrupt and tall [. . .]" (68). In section 4, as the men are within sight of the shore, their anger turns against the lifesaving stations they mistakenly suppose to be along the shore: "To their sharpened minds it was easy to conjure pictures of all kinds of incompetence and blindness and, indeed, cowardice" (76). They need an agent to blame.4 The lifesaving stations, which do not exist, cannot be blamed for the predicament itself, and to blame the ocean is self- evidently nonsensical, so the narrative voice speculates that men's collec- tive mind progresses from personification to myth, going from wrongful and barbarous waves to "the seven mad gods who rule the sea" to the more consolidated figure of "this old ninny-woman, Fate," who if she "cannot do better than this [. . .] should be deprived of the management of men's fortunes." Intention is again assumed, or rather a blameful absence of it: "She is an old hen who knows not her intention." Here the complaint becomes one of incompetence even more than malice: If I am going to be drowned [. . .] why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contem- plate land and contemplate sand and trees? Was I brought here merely</page><page sequence="33">250 Anthony Channeil Hilfer to have my nose dragged away as I was about to nibble the sacred cheese of life? It is preposterous. (77) Then: "If she has decided to drown me, why did she not do it in the begin- ning and save me all this trouble? The whole affair is absurd. . . . But no; she cannot mean to drown me. She dare not drown me. She cannot drown me. Not after all this work." Afterward the man might have had the impulse to shake his fist at the clouds. "Just you drown me, now, and then hear what I call you!" (77) The preposterousness of this denunciation is quite marvelous. Inten- tion is posited where it does not exist, and that the men have worked so hard is presented as a moral claim to a dubious divinity, Fate. Clearly the men were not "allowed" to come this near land but did so through their own efforts and good luck. That they cannot get ashore is the result not of malice but of heavy surf and bad luck. It is too unbearable for them to envision their predicament as mere accident, so they turn to a mythicized deity and indict it in a kind of inverted prayer.5 In a similarly desperate situation Job calls God to an accounting, one in which God justifies himself not morally but by an appeal to his creative power or, as we might say, to an aesthetics of the sublime. Before we return to the sublime let us first witness the grandiose buildup and breakdown of the moral claim in the great passage in section 6: During this dismal night, it may be remarked that a man would con- clude that it was really the intention of the seven mad gods of the sea to drown him despite the abominable injustice of it. For it was certainly an abominable injustice to drown a man who had worked so hard, so hard. The man felt it would be a crime most unnatural. Other people had drowned at sea since galleys swarmed with painted sails, but still - When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as impor- tant, and that she does not feel that she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples. Any visible expression of nature would surely be targeted with his jeers. Then, if there be no tangible thing to hoot, he feels, perhaps, the de- sire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas, bowed to one knee, and with hands supplicant, saying, "Yes, but I love myself." A high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that she says to him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his situation. (84-85)</page><page sequence="34">Representations of Nature in American Writing 251 The extended ellipsis of "but still - " indicates the absurdity of asking for an exemption from a routine hazard. The greatest joke of the passage is the pun "a crime most unnatural/' as if large waves and heavy surf were un -natural impositions. The discomfiting thing about nature is that though we can ad- dress it, our messages can only come back stamped with "return to sender." The men do, however, receive a kind of sign, the "high cold star on a winter's night." This sign resembles that which Stevens's Snow Man perceives, and also what another Snow Man, Robert Frost, recognizes in "Desert Places": And lonely as it is that loneliness Will be more lonely ere it will be less - A blanker whiteness of benighted snow With no expression, nothing to express. (386) Nature's non-expressiveness is, naturally, its ultimate expression, "the word he feels that she says to him." Why is this so hard to accept? Human egocentricity, an egocentricity on a cosmic scale, is reinforced, at least in the West, by the Christian doctrine of man's deserved transcen- dence over nature. As the Christian aspect of this belief weakened, it was replaced with technological domination, yet the shadow of divinity still hung over it. That is why it is such a shock, even an affront, that nature does not regard a man as important and does not feel that she would maim the universe by disposing of him: "Perhaps an individual must consider his own death to be the final phenomenon of nature" (91). Nature as a placeholder for the absconded God is woefully lacking in one of His most appealing attributes: providential care. Therefore the comfort of implor- ing or defying becomes irrelevant. There is nobody about to keep his eye on the sparrow. J. C. Levenson has it right in his commonsense reading of the first line of "The Open Boat": "The famous opening sentence - 'None of them knew the color of the sky' - is the simplest possible rendering of direct experience" (lxii). While the primary meaning is that the men must keep their eyes on the next wave that is so "nervously anxious to do something effective in the way of swamping boats," there may also be the intimation that the men cannot share in the reassurance from the heavens of William Cullen Bryant's allegorical waterfowl: There is a Power whose care Teaches thy way along that pathless coast, The desert and illimitable air, Lone wandering, but not lost. (125) Signs in the sky - of a providential God or of God's protected species of sparrows and waterfowls - are not evident in Crane's story. As George</page><page sequence="35">252 Anthony Channeil Hilfer Monteiro has demonstrated, "The Open Boat" is intertextual with a tradi- tional line of hymns that evoke God's providential rescue of those in peril at sea. Noting that the lifeboat itself becomes a danger to the men in their final attempt to reach the shore, Monteiro shows how Crane deconstructed the tropes of such hymns as William Bliss's "The Life-Boat": He matched his personal experiences of shipwreck against the es- sentialist, allegorical teachings of nineteenth-century Protestantism as he knew them, and he found their optimism decidedly wrong- headed. While the hymns talk of Christianity as the life-boat which in itself provides safety and salvation, Crane's story tells of a dinghy which at the last becomes as dangerous to human life as the sea itself. ("Logic" 334-35) The men are angry at Providence for not being there. There are, in fact, signs galore throughout "The Open Boat," but they are signs of insignificance, functioning usually as ironic denials of reas- surance: "There was the shore of the populous land, and it was bitter and bitter to them that from it came no sign" (76). The gull that tries to land on the captain's head seems an ironic inversion of Coleridge's benign albatross: "After it had been discouraged from the pursuit the captain breathed easier on account of his hair, and others breathed easier because the bird struck their minds at this time as being somehow grewsome and ominous" (71-72). The man on the shore waving his coat "don't mean anything" (80). If the men on the boat cannot communicate with a man on shore, how much the more is their difficulty in making sense out of the speechless phenomena of the natural world. Signs in Crane's story either fail to signify or are interpreted by the men to signify natural ma- levolence, or at least indifference. Crane has put the last nail in the coffin of Emerson's transcendentally idealist concept of nature. In Crane's story, words are signs of unadorned natural facts - "these waves were of the hue of slate" (68) - except, just as frequently, when words serve as egocentric complaints or pleas. These natural facts are signs of spiritual facts only if there is a spiritual force in nature that does not serve human desires. Final- ly, if nature is the symbol of spirit, then what it symbolizes is, as with the bird, "ominous." Emerson resonantly declared that "the world is emblem- atic" and that "a Fact is the end or last issue of spirit" (24-25). What then to make of our last view of Billie, possibly the best of the men in the boat: "The welcome of the land to the men of the sea was warm and generous, but a still and dripping shape was carried slowly up the beach, and the land's welcome for it could only be the different and sinister hospitality of the grave" (92). This seems an answer to which sign, exactly, the men are interpreting in the last passage in the story: "When it came night, the white</page><page sequence="36">Representations of Nature in American Writing 253 waves paced to and fro in the moonlight and the wind brought the sound of the great sea's voice to the men on shore, and they felt they could then be interpreters" (92). What they interpret remains unstated and is doubly qualified by being what they "felt [. . .] then." In yet another Crane irony, the last word in the story is "interpreters." Although Crane is rigorously ironic about the men's egocentric re- sponse to natural facts, it should be emphasized that this egoism is generic rather than unusual or individual. Thus, except for the oiler, Billie, the men in the boat are not named. These men-in-general are, if anything, better than most. Men tend to be provincial in the face of nature and find it difficult to keep it in mind that nature does not equate to nurture. But Billie' s death is an irony doubly directed at both Christian and Darwinian providence, given that he seems not only the most altruistic of the men in the boat, the one for whom divine providence should look out, but also the fittest who should come out ahead in what Darwin called "the great and complex battle of life" (91). Crane dealt with benign providence directly and rather crudely in another sea story, "Flanagan," in which a storm deals out inverse rewards: "The first mate was a fine officer, and so a wave crashed him into the deck-house and broke his arm. The cook was a good cook, and so the heave of the ship flung him heels over head with a pot of boiling water and caused him to lose interest in anything save his legs" (97). Darwinian providence does no better. In the last section of "The Open Boat," Crane sets us up with the correspondent's observation that "the oiler was ahead in the race. He was swimming strongly" (90). Yet he alone fails to survive. But, paradoxically though it may seem, Calvin as well as Darwin stand behind Crane's ironies. As John Berryman shrewdly observed, "Among [Crane's] rebellions, one hears something, however, Calvinist" (115). To be sure, Crane did not believe in God, but the God he did not believe in was the Calvinist God, and Crane is nearly as fierce about human pride and vanity as was Calvin, who noted, "So long as we do not look beyond the earth, we are quite pleased with our righteousness, wisdom, and virtue; we address ourselves in the most flattering terms, and seem only less than demigods" (38). Edward Garnett commented on Crane's "irony deriding the swelling emotions of the self" (213), and indeed these are his main tar- gets: "His work is a continual examination of pretension - an attempt to cast overboard, as it were, impediments to our salvation" (Berryman 279). Theodor Adorno' s philosophical reflection on nature suggests that it is a corrective for our pretensions: "Natural grandeur reveals another aspect to its beholder: that aspect in which human domination has its limits and that calls to mind the powerlessness of human bustle" (70). The men in the boat do finally find their pride pared down to an irreducible minimum: "Yes, but I love myself."</page><page sequence="37">254 Anthony Channell Hilfer As against even this minimal remnant of egocentricity, nature, the shad- ow of the Calvinist God, has its claims. These claims are expressed in the pictorial mode in terms of three opposing visions of landscape painting: the beautiful, the picturesque, and the sublime. Crane explicitly invokes the picturesque: "In the wan light the faces of the men must have been gray. Their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern. Viewed from a balcony, the whole thing would doubtless have been weirdly picturesque" (69). Crane is writing against the picturesque aesthetic and its prescribed, anthropomorphic expectations. The ecocritic Jonathan Bate makes the case against the picturesque as a mode of apprehending nature: The very word "landscape" makes the point. A land-scape means land as shaped, as arranged by a viewer. The point of view is that of a human observer, not the land itself. The classic picturesque view is seen from a "station," a raised promontory in which the spectator stands above the earth, looking down over it in attitude of enlighten- ment mastery. Landscape was originally a technical term in painting; it denoted an artistic genre, not something in nature. Hence the term "picturesque": a stretch of land that resembles a painting. (132) Charles Wright remarks that "landscape is something you determine and dominate. Nature is something that determines and dominates you" (qtd. in Costello 3), as good a distinction between the picturesque and sublime as any I know. Crane's image is an accusation of the putative picturesque spectators. It seems possible that the balcony from which these spectators view is that of a theater, thus demeaning the position of the men in the boat to figures in a melodrama. One could even envision a melodramatic adaptation of "The Open Boat" along the lines of the following scene, from a nineteenth-century stage adaptation of Nick of the Woods : Savages pursue Roland and his fiancée, who are stopped in their flight by a raging river below a waterfall. Suddenly, "the Jibbenainosay" [the name the Indians give to the revenger hero who pursues them] is precipitated down the cataract in a canoe of fire. The Indians all utter a yell of horror and fall on their faces. Near the end of Nick , the prophet-avenger reveals his true identity to his band of settler follow- ers, a revelation of revenge which presages the revelation of divine wrath at the climax of the action. (McConachie 137) The aesthetic of the melodrama, like that of the picturesque, has built into it the comfort of the spectator in a divinely ordered, providential cos- mos, a comfort shared by the reader looking down at the page. Even the</page><page sequence="38">Representations of Nature in American Writing 255 danger present in melodrama evokes self-pity rather than tragic clarity, turning in toward the ego rather than transcending it. Crane plays this out by introducing the notorious soldier of the legion who lay dying in Algiers: A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears; [. . .] (85) Though the correspondent suddenly feels an intense sorrow for the soldier not unlike the pangs one feels at a splendidly manipulative pop song ("The Leader of the Pack," say, or "Teen Angel"), Crane satirically targets the writ- er and, by implication, the reader: "It was no longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate [. . .]" (85).6 This imaginary danger has no real stakes for the reader or even the excessively safe and comfortable writer - as contrasted with Crane, whose story was based on his actual experience of shipwreck. The singsong rhymes of the poem emphasize its conventionality and gen- erate the correspondent's displaced, and, despite the straits he is in, rather luxurious self-pity. As John Conron notes in American Picturesque , Crane was one of the writers of the 1890s who "had begun to critique the picturesque both explicitly and implicitly by means of irony" (310-11). In a final twist, the correspondent, swimming for his life, finds himself envisioning the shore, the place of comfort, as a genre painting in an art gallery: "The shore, with its white slope of sand and its green bluff, topped with little silent cottages, was spread like a picture before him. It was very near to him then, but he was impressed as one who in a gallery looks at a scene from Brittany or Holland" (91). Here the aesthetic is neither pictur- esque nor sublime but beautiful, a landscape redolent of tranquility. Against the comforts of the beautiful, the picturesque, and the melo- dramatic, Crane poises a notably severe version of the sublime. The sublime serves the double office of restoring to nature a respect for its otherness while humbling the pride of human figures dwarfed in natu- ral immensities. J. C. Levenson interestingly argued that Crane's "famous irony was the necessary instrument of an intelligence which had so little on which to work" ("Stephen Crane" 384). Levenson notes that this irony was derived from a loss of faith in Emersonian transcendent meaning: The tacit assumption from which [Emerson] argued was this: that the unembellished facts could convey meaning because by themselves they had meaning in an implicit universal order. With an agnostic like Crane, however, for whom the vision of chaos was constant and glimpses of order were rare, the meaning of an event came less from its fitting a general pattern than from its not fitting the preconceptions</page><page sequence="39">256 Anthony Channell Hilfer with which society prepared him. Take metaphysical belief away, change certainty for ambiguity, and irony becomes the method for finding meaning. (393) In other words, Crane's writing is Adorno' s negative dialectics avant la lettre. Via irony and parody, Crane deflects a betraying language into at least an intimation of what nature is not, a strategy similar to Stevens's Snow Man. What both address is the "permanent reductio ad hominem of all appearance" (Adorno, Negative Dialectics 3 87), a state we are rapidly approaching in our age of simulacra. But pare down to "nothing that is not there," and you have at least cleared the ground for "the nothing that is," a nature that marginalizes man and negates God. Stevens's "The Snow Man" and Crane's "The Open Boat" are determined attempts to approach, if they can never arrive at, the zero-degree sublimity of nature, a perfect inhumanism. Crane gives us a nature that has agency without intention or person- ality, a nature that is visible without being intelligible, and he does so in language that flourishes signs warning against being taken for the thing they signify. But to the narrator, if not the men in the boat, nature has awe- inspiring attributes: "It was probably splendid, it was probably glorious, this play of the free sea, wild with lights of emerald and white and amber" (70). Is the qualification, the doubly stressed "probably," a sign of general indeterminacy or of the uncertainties involved in differing human per- spectives? The correspondent does seem to have a momentary epiphany of an impersonal natural, sublime in his apprehension of the unnamed "thing" (clearly a shark but unnamed as certain dread divinities are): But the thing did not then leave the vicinity of the boat. Ahead or astern, on one side or the other, at intervals long or short, fled the sparkling streak, and there was to be heard the whiroo of the dark fin. The speed and the power of the thing was greatly to be admired. It cut the water like a gigantic and keen projectile. (84) Even here the admiration is in the passive case and is not necessarily the correspondent's. From a strict Darwinian point of view, wherein by nature is meant "only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws" (92), Crane personifies throughout the story, as in "the play of the free sea" and the sublime power of the shark. Could these passages then be a more ironic play on our tendency to personify? We know from the beginning that the men in the boat do not have the luxury of aesthetic contemplation. So where are these views coming from? Not from the men, not from the (theater?) balcony. It is the view from nowhere and this is the ground of its authority, its lack of interested partiality. It is, so to speak, the sound of</page><page sequence="40">Representations of Nature in American Writing 257 the tree falling in the forest even when Bishop Berkeley is not there to hear it. Earlier we were shown an unqualified oceanic sublimity: "There was a terrible grace in the move of the waves, and they came in silence, save for the snarling of the crests" (69). "There was" is an ontological rather than epistemological claim. Crane ultimately affirms Nature with a capital N, but like Stevens's Snow Man and unlike most nineteenth-century versions (Melville obviously excepted), it is not a Nature that cares for us. The cor- respondent comes to realize this in his response to yet another sign, a tall wind tower on the shore: The tower was a giant, standing with its back to the plight of the ants. It represented in a degree, to the correspondent, the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the individual - nature in the wind, and nature in the vision of men. She did not seem cruel to him then, nor beneficent, nor treacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent. (88) Though indifference is, of course, a humanizing trait, and nature is assigned a gender in the passage, Crane, in negatively and theologically dialectical terms, in self-canceling language, has come near to outflanking the human- ization of nature without giving up on its sublimity. One thinks of Stevens's evocation of the cry "Inhuman, of the veritable ocean" (97) in "The Idea of Order at Key West." Behind all the anthropomorphic or egoistic or conven- tional or comfortable perspectives on nature is the veritable ocean.</page><page sequence="41">258 Anthony Channell Hilf er 4. A Passion for the Desert: Bill Broyles, Sunshot; Charles Bowden, Inferno; Edward Abbey, Desert Solitaire The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert, even tho' it is vast and empty and untouchable - and knows no kindness with all its beauty. - Georgia O'Keefe The desert is, as Edward Abbey maintained, "paradox and bedrock," com- bining a persistent inexpressibility with "the bare bones of existence, the elemental and fundamental, the bedrock which sustains us" (6). It seems that the more it is so very much there, the harder it is to capture in lan- guage. Yet the experience of the desert is remarkably similar among all the writings I shall reflect on here. Certain themes and tropes recur and fre- quently resonate with those I have examined in Thoreau, particularly the experiencing of the sublime, the turn to paradox in the attempt to trans- late this feeling into language, and the yearning for identification with the natural world at its least human. For most of us the obvious aspect of the desert is its emptiness. If one is driving through it on the way, let us say, to the golden land of coastal Cali- fornia, it appears to us as miles and miles of miles and miles. From another perspective the desert has striking forms of life, if of a hardscrabble sort: The strangeness and wonder of existence are emphasized here, in the desert, by the comparative sparity of the flora and fauna: life not crowded upon life as in other places but scattered abroad in spareness and simplicity, with a generous gift of space for each herb and bush and tree, each stem of grass, so that the living organism stands out bold and brave and vivid against the lifeless sand and barren rock. The extreme clarity of desert light is equaled by the extreme individu- ation of desert life forms. (Abbey i) Though the writers here recognize the distinctive fauna and flora of the desert world, what seduces them most is the emptiness, "the bare bones of existence," the unwelcomeness to human presence. One doesn't go to the desert for the society (at least that of fellow humans). The Arizona high school teacher and desert hiker Bill Broyles, in his 2006 book Sunshot (pho- tos by Michael P. Berman), finds that the appeal of the desert is that "it has too much sand, too many thorns, too little entertainment, too much noth- ing" (11). (Imagine hiking through the desert with an iPod - you might never hear that warning rattle.) It is "another world, which humans - my kind - have never figured out how to call 'home'" (45). It calls forth such ob- servations as the one Broyles quotes from Harley Shaw, that "the Universe</page><page sequence="42">Representations of Nature in American Writing 259 would not miss the planet. It will not miss lions. It will not miss humans" (29). Broyles boasts that in 1925 his native state was so "despoblado" that there was one person living between Ajo and Yuma (55), a distance of roughly eighty miles. Further back yet he cites the government explorer Lt. Nathaniel Michler, who wrote in 1886 that though the dirt road he was following was sometimes erased by high winds he could hold to it via the "continuous line of bleached bones and withered carcasses of horses and cattle, as monuments to mark the way [. . .]" (9). This is Broyles's ideal. He is an adept at desert hiking, "a cross between numbness and Nirvana" (171), as good a summary of the desert experience as could be. Broyles knew Abbey and knows Charles Bowden, another desert maven. These three resonate to the same, dare I say, mystical desert vibra- tions. For Bowden, a newspaper reporter and a desert bard, author of the aptly titled Inferno (2006, photos by Michael P. Berman), a splendid essay and photo book of the Sonora, the desert is "this huge empty" (37), where the basic rules are: 1. YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. 2. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. 3. DEAL WITH THIS FACT. 4. TIME'S UP. (35) As these injunctions indicate, neither the desert as a habitat nor Bowden as its Pindar is user-friendly, nor was Abbey, who noted in his introduction to Desert Solitaire (the title of which makes its own statement) that much of the book will seem coarse, rude, bad-tempered, violently prejudiced, unconstructive - even frankly antisocial in its point of view. Serious critics, serious librarians, serious associate professors of English [this critic is a full professor, I don't know if that lets me out] will if they read this work dislike it intensely; at least I hope so. (x) Bowden is even more aggressive, though less fairly he waits until the con- clusion of his book to dare the reader to repudiate it as a "self-centered rant" affected by "the intense heat that clearly deranges the mind," not to mention, in a nod to feminists, "the alarming presence of women and the way they are treated as sexual objects" and, not least, "the uncivilized distaste for words like nature, the entire absence of a reasoned argument springing from the researches of biology and the kindred sciences" (171). The harshness of the desert bleeds, appropriately, into Bowden's and Abbey's prose. Like the desert it is "clean to the eye and offensive to [our] ways" (Bowden 36). This too is part of a larger argument about what to make of the desert, about which rhetorical posture to take toward it.</page><page sequence="43">260 Anthony Channell Hilf er Bowden, like other desert lovers, glories in the nothing experience: An instant on the rim of absolute terror, when I heard nothing at all, not the sigh of a breeze, not the chirp of a bird, not the churning of the sun's fires, not the scream of an insect. But absolutely nothing, noth- ing at all in the pan of heat of a dry desert when the rains did not come and nothing moved, not even God. (53) And yet, "the silence was the deepest hearing of all" (53). Here Bowden combines a rhetorical with an epistemological recognition. Des- ert sublimity consists of what the silence says, sometimes loudly: "The quiet rang" (Broyles 24). As Bowden declares, his book "states what I know about a place I will never really know" (8). That is one paradox. In another, perhaps more confrontational, paradox, Bowden affronts post- structuralist theories of the priority of language and culture to experience by bluntly averring, "I knew nature before I ever knew the word" (25). In both instances Bowden is attempting to get at something that "is not contained in the categories I have been taught" (35), that outflanks "the nets of theory" (168), "the words that cage the objects" (111), in order to arrive at "the right place, the place I do not belong but the place I am, the yearning ground, and the yearning is never named because that would limit it" (88). Ultimately he yearns to "escape the cloaks of language and culture and go to the hot and angry ground" (37). What he believes he finds on the hot and angry ground is "the Thing itself [. . .] this thing is hard to say and harder to deny" (41). That the thing-in-itself is hard to say has been a staple of philosophy ever since Kant; it has, however, proven to be anything but hard to deny since Kant and Berkeley, much less poststructuralist theory. Bowden, contrary to such theory, actually credits his experiences, believes he has them, and rhetorically runs with them. He objects to theoretical and religious high ideas. The real for him is "something we fling names at and these names do not stick - they cling very briefly and fall away and are blown by the wind. [. . .] They do not answer to the force of [. . .] sensation" (47). Scandalously, Bowden applies this critique of what he sees as linguistic falsification to nature writing. If he overstates and unfairly de- means much beautiful and meaningful nature writing, there is a method to his badness. His real complaint is against a strain of nature writing that, like the picturesque, reduces nature to human dimensions, to har- mony, to prettiness, to the peaceable kingdom. Personally I love Thomas Hicks' s great Quaker paintings of the peaceable kingdom, with lions lying down with lambs, Isaiah's vision realized, and in Pennsylvania yet. But one takes Bowden's point. Bowden's tableau is oppositional to visions such as Hicks's:</page><page sequence="44">Representations of Nature in American Writing 261 We were [. . .] bouncing down a mountain road when a Gambel's quail streaked past the front bumper, closely followed by a bobcat in the fury of its fine appetite. Both ignored us. The cat had a silky coat, the hairs on its face bristled in the failing light and I am certain I caught a gleam in its eye. And I refuse to say this gleam shot rays of ravenous appetite or of blood lust or of sadism or of the chase or of anything but life and I am not sure what life really is. I simply can recognize its absence in the checkout line, the singles bar, and the sex lectures I received in my ancient high school. (70) Bowden contrasts the desert world to the garden world, where "the tem- perature is controlled, the weather steady, the food bland but ample, the screens programmed and relentless." He prefers the desert, "a piece of planetary hell and because of this fact [. . .] truer to the facts than the gar- den can ever be. [. . .] The garden is safe and is death" (144). Bowden' s vision of the world is rather more in accord with Darwin than it is with some strains of nature writing. The difference shows not only in philosophical perspective but also in prose style, in a sometimes strenuous attempt to avoid piety and tameness and to seek power and terror. I think it undeniable that Bowden' s philosophy and style make him a sitting duck for the sort of feminist critique he anticipates in his aforementioned conclusion, but they also allow him his insights, which happen to be less predictable and thus more interesting - he is less easily written off as a macho monster. There is a value in his holding out for "the edginess of things, our war against balance and harmony and our disbelief that the lambs will lie down with the lions and live" (128). He asks, "Can the natural world be saved if we are not animals? Or, better yet, can the natural world be saved once we utter that damning phrase of segregation: the natural world?" (129). Bowden wrote Inferno as a reaction to the pious and bureaucratic language he had to use to help bring about the Sonoran Desert National Monument. What he wants in contrast to the bloodless bureaucratic language of his park recommendation and the "pretty pictures" (131) of some nature writing is not just booze, drugs, and sex, though he clearly does want these. His main ego-drive, paradoxically, is to be overwhelmed, to lose self to desert: "I've come here because this place has always worked for me and has forced me to surrender the buzz of my ideas and taste the limits of my power. In the cities of my world I am never outnumbered, but here I am overwhelmed, one frail Homo sapiens facing a multitude" (25). Much of the desert's value is in its resistance to self, to ego: "This place has value because it is not our notion of nature. It is not safe. It is not home. It is not kind" (159). But it offers a mystical resource, "a peace that is beyond our religions, of falling off the edge into not ourselves but something greater, the feeling of not belonging and not</page><page sequence="45">262 Anthony Channeil Hilfer having the will to leave, the desert of yearning where we stop yearning, where we simply are. A state of being rather than a state of becoming" (162). His book is "a testament to something far greater than myself" (8). It is the eternal quest of the mystic, and I would not venture to avow that it is possible, especially given all of the theoretical fatwas issued against it. But it seems worth a try. How can this state be attained in relation to the nonhuman world? The recurrent answer, or attempt at an answer, as noted in the Thoreau section, is identification and Contact ! Contact ! Contact! These motifs are readily apparent in Broyles, Bowden, and Abbey, but about the quest for identification, I ask: when does it leave off being identification and become what the psychoanalysts term incorporation and introjection? I see a thin line separating the two responses for the three writers in this section. According to Laplanche and Pontalis's The Language of Psycho- Analysis, "incorporation contains three meanings: It means to obtain pleasure by making an object penetrate oneself; it means to destroy this object; and it means, by keeping it within oneself, to appropriate the object's qualities" (211). I do not see the second of these aspects as operative in the writers I am discussing, though it might be argued that any incorporation implies the overcoming of the object and hence its destruction. Emerson's relation to nature is incorporative in this sense. The three writers in this section, however, more nearly destroy themselves than their world, even if they do exhibit a bit of imperial selfhood. It would be difficult to miss the first and third qualities of incorporation in them. Laplanche and Pontalis note that Sandor Ferenczi coined the term introjection as the opposite of projection : In "Introjection and Transference" (1909) he writes: "Whereas the paranoiac expels from his ego the impulses that have become un- pleasant, the neurotic helps himself by taking into the ego as large as possible a part of the outside world, making it the object of uncon- scious phantasies. [. . .] One might give to this process, in contrast to projection, the name of Introjection ." (229-30) While I think these terms may elucidate the writings at hand, I do not see these writers as neurotic. If anything Bowden and Abbey are paranoiac, but structural rather than clinical paranoids, which is to say their enemies are real, not imagined, and I believe them to be my enemies as well. Broyles, the least extreme, does show an understandably popular form of identification: coyote envy. This is flagrant: "I envied the coyote and tried to emulate its durable lope" (24). Thoreau and his fox come to mind. Broyles also repeatedly experimented with total immersion, several times hiking in solitary desert country, and once, even more dangerously, training for the desert by shutting himself in his car in the driveway of his Tucson home in</page><page sequence="46">Representations of Nature in American Writing 263 August. He lasted ninety-one minutes with the heat inside the car register- ing 170 degrees on the dash and managed to emerge dangerously ill. His attempt to know heat in his bones through his introjection of it very nearly destroyed not the object, as in Laplanche's analysis, but himself. Bowden too has his Contact! moments. He wants to "eat the dirt and lick the rock" (21), to "become the tree and the rock" (83). He wants to touch and yet transcend touch. The good and bad thing about touch is that it shows we are there. In a Thoreauvian italicized extravaganza Bowden falls repeatedly on knife-edge lava surfaces, reflecting, "Touch always as- sists in our suicide of meaning. How often during the day and the night do we touch ourselves and , by that act , convince ourselves that we still exist ?" But do we really want this conviction? Or is its loss of greater value? "In the black rock of my desert this touch is finally cast aside and we go into the feeling. The hands , they are vanishing bit by bit as each fall tears away more of the hands. [...] I lurch across the living rocks and more and more of me falls away." The rocks seem to be doing the introjection. Finally there is an epiphany: "I no longer reach toward things to touch. The feeling comes to me. I am ready to go for the singing bones and finally, ah, at last, I touch " (81). Going to a touch beyond touch he is ready for the elemental, down to the singing bones that Broyles notes were landmarks to Lt. Michler. Later Bowden has a more thoroughly immersing Contact ! moment, one that deploys all the senses: I hear the hum of the rocks and see, finally, the scream of the stars at noon. I touch the face of the desert noon. I touch the face of the clock in the scattered rocks. I smell the ooze all around me in the dry desert. I am on my knees now. The bone goes into my mouth, slowly ; ever so slowly ; the tongue crumbles as my mouth fills with bone. I spit out the fragments of my tongue onto the sizzling soil. A stub flounders in my mouth as the singing bones go down my throat and choke me into the music. I am now a man ready for my desert, an Adam prepared for the face of Eve. (135) Like Thoreau's this is a fantasy immersion, indeed further yet from literal reference. This, along with other Bowden passages, is wide open to ridi- cule and deconstruction. The pun on desert/ dessert in the last line, after a meal of singing bones, derived from the Grimm brothers, pushes the envelope. For one, as fossil expert J. Shreeve points out - though not in relation to Bowden - "Everybody knows fossils are fickle; bones will sing any song you want to hear" (58.) If Bowden is absurd and extravagant it is because he is playing not so much the mimicry (mimetic, imitation of reality) game as Ilinx, the vertigo game, defined by Roger Caillois in Man, Play and Games as "based on the pursuit of vertigo and which consists of an attempt to momentarily destroy the stability of perception and inflict a kind of voluptuous panic upon an otherwise lucid mind. In all cases, it</page><page sequence="47">264 Anthony Channeil Hilfer is a question of surrendering to a kind of spasm, seizure, or shock which destroys reality with sovereign brusqueness" (23). Bowden gives his stamp of approval to this enduring game (that perhaps began in literature with Aristophanes, with a later assist coming from Petronius Arbiter): "Vertigo, the only balance worth living, the lunging, lurching, bashing about, the fall- ing and then, whoops, that last minute recovery, the stumble forward, eyes half open, watch out now, don't spill that drink, the wandering without a map, the wrong turn, reverses, digressions, small talk in the midnight bars" (139-41). He goes on to note: That is the reason and need for the desert, that blasted zone of madmen crawling through the sands with their visions, honey and fragments of wild locust dribbling from their cracked lips, braying messages from some kind of god, touting revelations, insane bits of dietary lore and songs, and, generally needing a bath. (141) Bowden has to be thinking of his friend Edward Abbey, the ecologi- cal wild man, a major figure of modern nature writing (or should I say, anti-writing), another master of the vertigo game. Abbey was in the great American tradition of self-invention. Born and brought up in rural Penn- sylvania, he became an archetypal Westerner, a throwback mountain man. A dedicated conservationist, he was also temperamentally avid, a devour- er of experience and relationships (with women these were intense but frequently not sustained), an extremist who worked toward promoting a more civil relationship with the natural world. Abbey wrote, among other works, a novel, The Monkey-Wrench Gang , that doubled as a how-to book for eco-sabotage, explaining why one should always carry a chainsaw in one's car trunk in case one came upon a billboard desecrating the land- scape without a police car in sight. Abbey's masterwork is undoubtedly Desert Solitaire , an account of two years (squeezed into one in the book, following Thoreau's precedent at Waiden) as the forest ranger in the then sparsely developed Arches National Monument in Utah. Desert Solitaire is anything but a journal. It is a polemic, a lyric, an el- egy, a parody, a theophany. Abbey believed the beauty of the place would be compromised beyond repair by accommodating campers, less the tent- bearing kind than the invading-barbarians-in-Winnebagos kind, with television reruns humming into the desert night. This invasion happened shortly after he left, having done as much as he could to keep people out of his "natural paradise" (190). Abbey's desert country is (or was) "the most beautiful place on earth" (1). Questing after "the shock of the real" (42), Abbey finds it in "the solidity and resistance" of sand and rock (155). In Abbey's revision of Plato, "only rock is real" (219). Resistance is an es- sential element in Abbey's philosophy/ theology because the humanizing</page><page sequence="48">Representations of Nature in American Writing 265 of nature is what he is striving to extirpate from his consciousness - not an easy task for someone of such capacious ego. Hence his emphasis that "the finest quality of this stone, these plants and animals, this desert landscape is the indifference manifest to our presence, our absence, our coming, our staying. Whether we live or die is a matter of absolutely no concern what- soever to the desert" (301). Yet this passage personifies the desert or at least hypostatizes it, a sign of the difficulty of this stance. What so entrances Abbey? In part, nothing; he is "spellbound by that fulfillment of nothingness" (238). True, the context here is a passage about a camper who fell off a mesa, perhaps drawn by the attraction of vertigo. But for Abbey this was a fortunate fall: "I envy him the manner of his go- ing; to die alone, on rock under sun at the brink of the unknown, like a wolf, like a great bird, seems to me very good fortune indeed" (240). In celebrating "this glare of brilliant emptiness [. . .] this arid intensity of pure heat" (151), he plays on Marvell's great lines from "The Garden": "Anni- hilating all that's made / To a green thought in a green shade." Except in Abbey's version, it is "annihilating all thought and all that men have made to a spasm of whirling dust far out on the golden desert" (151). Abbey's definition of paradise is not one that evokes fleecy clouds or the comforts of home: Now when I write of paradise I mean Paradise , not the banal heaven of the saints. When I write "paradise" I mean not only apple trees and golden women but also scorpions and tarantulas and flies, rattle- snakes and Gila monsters, sandstorms, volcanoes and earthquakes, bacteria and bear, cactus, yucca, bladderweed, ocotillo and mesquite, flash floods and quicksand, and yes - disease and death and the rotting of flesh. (190) As in Bowden's paradise, the lions do not lie down with the lambs. "What would they eat?" Abbey inquires (190). But even as he emphasizes the otherness of nature Abbey, as much as Thoreau or Bowden, wants Contact ! Staying true to his antihumanism, he identifies with trees, rocks, and, in the world of fauna, primarily with preda- tors. Yet when he attempts to commune with a juniper its essence eludes him, perhaps, as he suspects, because "its surface is also the essence" (30-31). He notes, with ecological exactness, that "we need more predators" (35), declar- ing that the loss of an occasional lamb is worth it to keep the coyotes sleek. The coyote may be his as well as Broyles's totem animal.7 He comments, We need coyotes more than we need, let us say, more people, of whom we have already an extravagant surplus, or more domesticated dogs, which in all fairness could and should be ground up into hamburger</page><page sequence="49">266 Anthony Channell Hilfer and used as emergency coyote food, to raise their spirits and perhaps improve the tenor of their predawn howling. (236) This modest proposal obviously derives from Jonathan Swift, the give- away being the wonderfully bland "in all fairness." (For that matter, a book of essays about Abbey is titled Coyote in the Maze : Tracking Edward Abbey in the World of Words.) In one of Desert Solitaire's notable passages Abbey reassures someone who may be perishing in the desert that a better world awaits him: Comfort yourself with the reflection that within a few hours, if all goes as planned, your human flesh will be working its way through the gizzard of a buzzard, your essence transfigured into the fierce greedy eyes and unimaginable consciousness of a turkey vulture. Whereup- on you, too, will soar on motionless wings high over the ruck and rack of human suffering. For most of us a promotion in grade, for some the realization of an ideal. (135) The parody on Buddhist transmigration and on Christian transcendence of death is unmistakable, a very different version of being raptured. The best way to get close in to the desert world is on all fours: "I lie on my belly on the edge of the dune, back to the wind, and study the world of the flowers from ground level, as a snake might see it" (30). He helpfully recommends this for park visitors as well: "Walk, better crawl, on hands and knees, over the sandstone and through the brush and cac- tus. When traces of blood begin to mark your trail you'll see something, maybe. Probably not" (xii). We should all give thanks for such counsel, but pay more attention to Abbey's signature Contact! passage, where he pulls out all the stops in memo- rably passionate purple prose. The passage begins with a seemingly egregious assertion of imperial selfhood, as greedy though sexier than Emerson's: Standing there, gaping at this monstrous and inhuman spectacle of rock and cloud and sky and space, I feel a ridiculous greed and pos- sessiveness come over me. I want to know it all, possess it all, embrace the entire scene intimately, deeply, totally, as a man desires a beautiful woman. An insane wish? Perhaps not - at least there's nothing else, no one human, to dispute possession with me. (6) This passage is a duck in a barrel for critics of imperial American selfhood and for feminists who have shown the complicit intertangling of rape fan- tasies of women and female-gendered landscapes. There is also a notable presence of introjection as well as identification. But Abbey knows these</page><page sequence="50">Representations of Nature in American Writing 267 implications are there and has bad fun playing with their ridiculousness and insanity; the critique is built into his language. He proceeds with a crucially tricky and oft-quoted passage: The personification of the natural is exactly the tendency I wish to suppress in myself, to eliminate for good. I am here not only to evade for a while the clamor and filth and confusion of the cultural appara- tus but also to confront, immediately and directly if it's possible, the bare bones of existence, the elemental and fundamental, the bedrock which sustains us. I want to be able to look at and through a piece of quartz, a vulture, a spider, and see it as it is in itself, devoid of all humanly ascribed qualities, anti-Kantian, even the categories of scientific description. To meet God or Medusa face to face, even if it means risking everything human in myself. I dream of a hard and brutal mysticism in which the naked self merges with a non-human world and yet somehow survives still intact, individual, separate. Paradox and bedrock. (6) Abbey believes everything he says here, especially the denial of all post- Kantian philosophy, built as it is on the impossibility of perceiving the ding-an-sich, the thing-in-itself, the bare bones of existence, the elemental and fundamental, the bedrock. Yet Abbey signals the difficulty of evad- ing the culturally prior with his obvious paraphrase of two well-known quotations from Waiden : the one where Thoreau wishes to "front only the essential facts of life [. . .] to suck out its marrow," to "reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine mean- ness [Medusa] of it and publish its meanness to the world" (394), and the one where Thoreau determines to wedge in his heels, work downward through the mud and slush of human opinions and institutions until he hits rocks "which we can call reality and no mistake" (400). So is Abbey, in another example of postmodernist belatedness, a mere cultural echo of his hero, Thoreau? The paradox is that Abbey knows Thoreau has trod this ground, but Abbey has arrived at the same place, albeit with some helpful guidance. And through his own heightened rhet- oric Abbey has claimed the insight as due to his own sensibility, different from if respectful toward Thoreau' s, with different identifications - the piece of quartz, the vulture, the spider, and not least the flagrant sugges- tion of sexual intercourse with the natural world. So the passage is a kind of joke, but an essentially serious one, paradox and bedrock. A distinction in Beiden Lane's The Solace of Fierce Landscapes helps place Abbey's extravagant rhetoric. Lane argues that apophatic language can be supplemented by its seeming antithesis, kataphatic language, which is characterized by abundant metaphor and bold overstatement:</page><page sequence="51">268 Anthony Channell Hilfer Its [apophatic imagery's] spare, deconstructed ambiguity provokes, curiously, a language of bold exaggeration. "How does one write about nothing?" asks Maggie Ross, speaking of the perennial dilemma of apophatic theology. "As extravagantly as possible," she answers. (109) As Lane notes, apophatic theology, holding its breath in silence for as long as it can, sometimes bursts at last into a kataphatic excess of language. It becomes, as Denys Turner argues, "a kind of verbal riot, an anarchy of dis- course in which anything goes" (qtd. in Lane 110). This holds for Thoreau and Crane as well as Abbey and Bowden. The jokes and self-contradictions of Abbey's and Bowden's rhetoric, in fact, affirm the desert's unsayable sublimity: "Whirlwinds dance across the salt flats, a pillar of dust by day; the thornbush breaks into flame by night. What does it mean? It means nothing. It is as it is and has no need for meaning. The desert lies beneath and soars beyond any human quali- fication. Therefore sublime" (Abbey 219). More sublime than the biblical god evidently, since there's no need for the human qualifications of burn- ing bushes and pillars of fire through which God manifests himself. God declares, "I AM THAT I AM." The desert is as it is. This is the epistemological difficulty the desert presents: "The des- ert says nothing. Completely passive, acted upon but never acting, the desert lies there like the bare skeleton of Being, spare, sparse, austere, ut- terly worthless, inviting not love but contemplation. In its simplicity and order it suggests the classical, except that the desert is a realm beyond the human" (270). It is "untouched by the human mind" (73). All in all it sounds rather like the New Critical version of the formalist work of art, and Abbey compares it to the music of Berg and Schoenberg: "The desert is also atonal, cruel, clear, inhuman, neither romantic nor classical, motion- less and emotionless, at one and the same time - another paradox - both agonized and deeply stilled" (286). If someone were to add that Abbey's version of the desert is also flagrantly macho I would not be inclined to disagree, but I do not think this invalidates it. As Abbey adds, "The itch for naming things is almost as bad as the itch for possessing things" (288). Abbey's desert is seen through the rhetoric of the sublime, indebted to the prior vision of Thoreau, compromised by his immitigable machismo, and in touch with a nearly or perhaps altogether unsayable reality that he nonetheless, by a procedure akin to negative theology, conjures into being. For all his hostility to religion, Abbey has a spiritual, indeed mystical, vi- sion, a "suspension of time, a continuous present" (13), the wish to "learn to love space as deeply as we are now obsessed with time" (66). Abbey and Broyles quote the same luminous passage from Balzac's bizarrely beautiful story "A Passion in the Desert." The story, actually a</page><page sequence="52">Representations of Nature in American Writing 269 story within a story, is about a French colonial soldier who escapes his Arab captors only to find himself alone and seemingly helpless in the desert. But just at the point where he contemplates suicide he finds a small, apparently uninhabited oasis with water and a fig tree. Refreshed and with renewed hope he goes to sleep, only to awaken and find he is in the den of a panther. At the end of his rope, he attempts to gentle the panther by petting it, and thus begins one of the odder if not quite fully consummated love affairs in world literature. In the event, he kills the panther in a moment of unjustified mistrust. For me this very French amour, though compelling, is less memo- rable than Balzac's depiction of the desert's sublimely terrifying beauty: The dark sand of the desert spread further than the eye could reach in every direction and glittered like steel struck with bright light. It might have been a sea of looking-glass, or lakes melted together in a mirror. A fiery vapor carried up in surging waves made a perpetual whirlwind over the quivering land. The sky was lit with an Oriental splendor of insupportable purity, leaving naught for the imagination. Heaven and earth were on fire. The silence was awful in its wild and terrible majesty. Infinity, im- mensity, closed in upon the soul from every side. Not a cloud in the sky, not a breath in the air, not a flaw on the bosom of the sand, ever moving in diminutive waves; the horizon ended as at sea on a clear day, with one line of light, definite as the cut of a sword. (357-58) Some of this could certainly be reduced to the numbered conventions of Roland Barthes's deconstructive subversion of another Balzac story in S/Z. But I have seen that horizon - though not in Egypt - and Balzac has it right. At any rate, if Balzac is running the table of the conventions of the sublime, he does get all his billiard balls in the pocket. This is the desert sublime, powerful and terrible. It is not, however, the passage that Broyles and Abbey quote. That comes at the end of the story, when the soldier sums up his experience of the desert to a bewildered listener: "In the desert, you see, there is anything, and nothing." "Yes, but explain - " "Well," he said, with an impatient gesture, "it is God without man- kind." (369) Which is to say that whatever their formal religious beliefs or lack thereof,8 Broyles, Abbey, and even Bowden respond to the desert, whatever "it" is, with authentic reverence.</page><page sequence="53">270 Anthony Channeil Hilfer 5. Small Figures in Large Landscapes Paul Bowles's first view of North Africa was enough to tell him that he had landed in his landscape of desire. Only twenty-one years old and still a musician rather than a writer, he had found his spiritual home: Straightway I felt a great excitement. Always without formulating the concept, I had based my sense of being in the world partly on an unreasoned conviction that certain areas of the earth's surface con- tained more magic than others. Had anyone asked me what I meant by magic, I should probably have defined the word by calling it a secret connection between the world of nature and the consciousness of man, a hidden but direct passage which bypassed the mind. (The operative word here is "direct," because in this case it was equivalent to "visceral.") Like any Romantic, I had always been vaguely certain that sometime during my life I should come into a magic place which in disclosing its secrets would give me wisdom and ecstasy - perhaps even death. And now, as I stood in the wind looking at the mountains ahead, I felt the stirring of the engine within, and it was as if I were drawing close to the solution of an as-yet-unposed problem. ( Without Stopping , hereafter WS, 125) This is one of the many passages in Bowles's writings where he reveals a passion for North Africa and, most of all, for the Sahara, at least equal to Abbey's for his desert and Broyles's and Bowden's for theirs. It's all the more odd that Bowles found his way there by chance concatenations, especially the suggestion of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas that he go to Africa as an alternative to the trite American apprenticeship in France. Bowles later declared, "Like my fifteen-year-old counterparts all over the world, I was seduced by Lafcadio's acte gratuite" (WS 67). While it seems unlikely that fifteen-year-olds all over the world were reading André Gide's novel Les Caves du Vatican , whose protagonist's principal ethos is to act on whim, in one incident pushing a man out of a train to his death simply because the thought occurs to him, the tendency is consistent with Bowles, who let gratuitous suggestions lead him to momentous choices. Eventually, the Sahara became not only Bowles's muse but also part of his being in the world. He discovered in it the nothing that is: "I realized that I loved all those things: the sun, the silence, the nothingness" ( Con- versations with Paul Bowles , hereafter C, 225). When very young, Bowles adopted the "practice of pretending not to exist" (WS 131), but this did not work well in Morocco; a blond westerner could hardly escape notice. Still, the desert's appeal was in its negation of ego. As Bowles commented to an interviewer, "I don't see myself, really, I have no ego" (C 115). This</page><page sequence="54">Representations of Nature in American Writing 271 is why he didn't engage in the kind of literary gamesmanship for which, say, Norman Mailer is known: "To take part in such games, you have to believe in the existence of your personality in a way that I don't" (C 119). This skepticism about the value of salient selfhood very much carries over to his fiction: "For years critics have objected to the facelessness of my fictional people, although that is deliberate on my part. And at the time I was writing [. . .] I did not have reactions to people as people, but only as forces to propel me, as a glider uses air currents" (In Touch : The Letters of Paul Bowles , hereafter L, 439). The gratuitous act substitutes for personal motivation. More importantly, it is the landscape, not the people, that is central; the usual foreground and background of fiction switch off: "Places have always been more important to me than people. That is to say, peo- ple give the landscape scale; the landscape is not a background to them" (L 440). Thus in The Sheltering Sky the apparent protagonist, Port Moresby, dies halfway through. The Sheltering Sky is not quite like Vanity Fair , which Thackeray subtitled "A Novel without a Hero": "What I wanted to tell was the story of what the desert can do to us. That was all. The desert is the protagonist" (C 54). (As with Crane's "The Open Boat," a comparison to which I shall return.) But why the desert? Its appeal, once more, is in its negational essence: "I find the desert very exciting because there's nothing there. You won't find a tree or a rock or a bush. You won't find anything at all except sand dunes. You can pretend you're lost in there. You can get lost in there. It's very beautiful" (C 215). What one loses there is oneself - as Bowles describes it, "the romantic fantasy of reaching a region of self- negation and thereby regaining a state of innocence" (C 93). The religious vision most prevalent in our world is that of a loving God who sometimes providentially intervenes in human affairs. The spiritual principle in Bowles's fiction has as little to do with benevolent providence as it does in Crane's. The appeal of the Sahara is in inverse ratio to its welcome of human presence: The Sahara is not Algeria, is not Morocco, is not Senegal. It's a great stretch of earth where climate reigns supreme, and every gesture man makes is conscious defense from, or propitiation of, the climactic con- ditions. Man is hated in the Sahara . . . one feels it in the sky, in the stones, in the air. It might as well be written in the stars: God Hates Man, Pinky is a Rat. But, of course, that can be exciting. Where life is prohibit- ed, it becomes a delectable hidden fruit, and that is the feeling one gets here: each instant is begrudged one by an implacable tyrant. (L 189) Its implacability is central to its sublimity: "The Sahara has its own 'di- alectic,' as hard as nails, and fifty times more sharp and beautiful than anything else" (L 119). Sky as well as sand composes this dialectic: "The S</page><page sequence="55">272 Anthony Channeil Hilfer is the place of the great lie, where nothing is true save that the light makes it so, a pitiless and capricious light. Shadow can have more reality than rock, the sky can be more solid than the earth beneath" (Stewart, citing Bowles's papers at the Harry Ransom Center, 52). Hence, "The book was going to take place in the Sahara, where there was only the sky, and so it would be The Sheltering Sky" (WS 275). I do not mean to suggest that Bowles's characters are unreal. Port Moresby unmistakably resembles Paul Bowles in his philosophy and his states of consciousness (more on which is forthcoming), and Kit Moresby is at least "a counterfeit Jane" (The Sheltering Sky, hereafter SS, 6). (Jane Bowles was herself the author of the underground masterpiece Two Serious Ladies.) And the novel has sharp portrayals of well-meaning but fussy French administrators, a variety of Arabs, and a grotesque mother-son couple in the form of the bigoted and incestuous Lyles. Yet there is less relationship among characters than among characters and their states of consciousness or, to use an existentialist-phenomenological term, char- acters and their being-in-the-world ( Dasein in Heidegger's German). Moreover, these are not only states of consciousness but also states of spatial location, relation, or a conspicuous lack of relation to their locale in the Sahara. More than any characters I can recall in fiction, Bowles's are located between earth and sky, an insistent division in the novel, the borders of which are precisely notated: The dunes here leveled off to make the terrain nearly flat. In a land- scape made gray by too much light, the few hundred palms at first were no more than a line of darker gray at the horizon - a line which varied in thickness as the eye beheld it, moving like a slow-running liquid; a wide band, a long gray cliff, nothing at all, then once more the thin penciled border between the earth and the sky. (270) With a very significant exception, the minor characters are not shown in relation to the landscape, but Port and Kit increasingly find themselves swallowed up in it, cancelled out by it. Their displacement from the civil world and encompassment by the desert world is the central motif of The Sheltering Sky. Thus we have Kit, who during a social encounter "sat drink- ing the tea, feeling that what she saw and heard around her was not really happening, or if it were, she was not really there herself" (128). A not un- common nonce feeling, but for Kit and Port one that is almost normative. Both are at odds with "the mechanized age" (14) they have gone to the Sahara to evade. Port declares that "he is not going to carry a passport to existence around with me, to prove I have the right to be here!" (95). This is not entirely metaphorical, since he subsequently has his literal passport stolen and then insists on outrunning its return. He anticipates several</page><page sequence="56">Representations of Nature in American Writing 273 Antonioni film protagonists in recognizing the ultimate existentialist con- dition that "the soul is the loneliest part of the body" (124). In another instance of Port's evasion of civil status, the immigration authorities are disturbed that he has "left a blank after the word Profession on their papers as he had done on his passport" (198). Kit, more concerned with civilized creature comforts, nevertheless finds herself bemused as well as reassured by the familiar and a fortiori absurd contents of her purse: It gave her momentary pleasure to think of that dark little world, the handbag smelling of leather and cosmetics, that lay between the hostile air and her body. Nothing was changed in there; the same ob- jects fell against each other in the same limited chaos, and the names were still there, still represented the same things. Mark Cross, Caron, Helena Rubinstein. "Helena Rubinstein," she said aloud, and it made her laugh. (195) In the event, the desert trumps Helena Rubinstein as Kit ventures out in it alone. What does the desert mean? Port loses his life in it and Kit her reason. Port feels disconnected to life, unable to fully experience even the desert, the true object of his affection: The landscape was there and more than ever he could not reach it. The rocks and the sky were everywhere, ready to absolve him, but as always he carried the obstacle within him. He would have said that as he looked at them, the rocks and sky ceased being themselves, that in the act of passing into his consciousness, they became impure. (168) His consciousness of the desert, in an especially perverse manifestation of the problem of authentic representation, prevents him from attaining Contact ! Contact ! Contact ! For that matter, what he seeks may ultimately be his death. Merleau-Ponty' s description of his phenomenological phi- losophy might serve to describe the opening moments of Bowles's novel: "It is a philosophy for which the world is 'already there' before reflection begins - as an inalienable presence; and all its efforts are concentrated upon re-achieving a direct and primitive contact with the world" (vii). In the Bowles passage above, this contact is thwarted by Port's self-consciousness. The novel begins with a scene that evokes a state close to Merleau- Ponty's "already there" state: He awoke, opened his eyes. The room meant very little to him; he was too deeply immersed in the non-being from which he had just come. If he had not the energy to ascertain his position in time and space, he</page><page sequence="57">274 Anthony Channeil Hilf er also lacked the desire. He was somewhere, he had come back through vast regions from nowhere; there was a certitude of an infinite sad- ness at the core of his consciousness, but the sadness was reassuring, because it alone was familiar. (11) Sadness and nonbeing appears to be the ideal state, one which resembles Merleau-Ponty' s description of night: Night is not an object before me; it enwraps me and infiltrates through all my senses, stifling my recollections and almost destroying my personal identity. [. . .] Even shouts or a distant light people it only vaguely, and then it comes to life in its entirety; it is pure depth with- out foreground or background, without surfaces and without any distance separating it and me. (283) As Port flees from civil identity, this darkness, sometimes represented as an ineffable menace hidden behind the sheltering sky, seems to be the object of his quest. Its locale is to be found in "one strict, undeviating course inland to the desert, and now he was very nearly at its center" (198). This evokes, perhaps intentionally, Louis-Ferdinand Céline's Voyage au bout de la nuit ( Journey to the End of the Night). Like Céline's quest Port's seems nihilistic, an impression reinforced by Port's "theorem," which is "name- ly that the difference between something and nothing is nothing" (199). Is the desert's significance then as the ultimate emblem of nothingness? Certainly it is not the desert's function to nourish Port and Kit back to spiritual health. In an extraordinary passage, Kit feels menaced by the desert nightscape: The town below was invisible - not a light showed - but to the north glimmered the white ereg, the vast ocean of sand with its frozen swirling crests, its unmoving silence. She turned slowly about, scan- ning the horizon. The air, doubly still now after the departure of the wind, was like something paralyzed. Whichever way she looked, the night's landscape suggested only one thing to her: negation of move- ment, suspension of continuity. But as she stood there, momentarily part of the void she had created, little by little a doubt slipped into her mind, the sensation that some part of this landscape was moving even as she looked at it. She glanced up and grimaced. The whole monstrous star-filled sky was turning sideways before her eyes. It looked still as death but yet it moved. Every second an invisible star edged above the earth's line on that side, and another fell below on the opposite side. (226)</page><page sequence="58">Representations of Nature in American Writing 275 This negational vision is what suggested itself to Kit, what slipped into her mind, a stylistically emphasized subjective impression. Later Tunner, the Moresbys' dubious companion, reflects on the desert's agency: "Since Port's death and Kit's disappearance he hated the desert: in an obscure fashion he felt that it had deprived him of his friends. It was too powerful an entity not to be personified" (251, my italics). So is it the desert, or our anthropocentric perception of it, at issue? There is much to support both viewpoints in the novel. A key episode may offer a cue. The section's subtitles as well as its title itself are landscape references: "Tea in the Sahara," "The Earth's Sharp Edge," "The Sky." So, one way or the other, the locale is central. The first of the subtitles encompasses a story within the story that Port is told by an Arab prostitute, Mahrnia, with illustrative gestures supplied by her pimp, Smail. The story is of three Arab women whose most intense desire is to have tea in the Sahara. They put all their savings into buying a tea service and joining a caravan into the desert. They sneak out one night with their service looking for the tallest dune they can find for their ceremony, going farther and farther into the desert in their quest. The story's ending is both shocking and inevitable. They find the highest dune and climb it and, ar- ranging their tray and teapot and glasses: "Then they lay down and slept. And then" - Smail paused and looked at Port - "many days later another caravan was passing and a man saw something on top of the highest dune there. And when they went up to see, they found Outka, Mimouna and Aicha; they were still there, lying the same way as when they had gone to sleep. And all three of the glasses," he held up own little tea glass, "were full of sand. That was how they had tea in the Sahara." (39) The story is a parable, and like many other great parables and frequently great aphorisms as well, it is ambiguous. Port is not sure what to make of it and shrugs it off with the banal comment, "It's very sad," to which Mahrnia replies, "Ei oua'" (the equivalent of "You bet"). In context, we could take as this as a symbolic warning to Port and an omen of what awaits Kit in their ventures into the Sahara. Yet we know of Port's and Bowles's entrancement by the desert, and the novel cannot be showing their belief in the transcendent quality of the Sahara to be an illusion. For that matter, to envision this quality as malevolent would be fully as much a personification as to see it as somehow redemptory. I incline to the view that as a transcendent essence it cannot be defined by either term. I sug- gest that the brilliant French existentialist philosopher Jean Wahl gives us the terms for it in his scandalously untranslated masterpiece, Existence humaine et transcendence (Human existence and transcendence). Wahl</page><page sequence="59">276 Anthony Channeil Hilfer argues, "Transcendence is at the same time a no and a yes. It is a yes which is a no to all our affirmations. It is a no which is affirmation of something which is beyond all our affirmations" (36; this and all following quotes are my translation). He posits two modes of transcendence: transascendence and transdescendence. You may not know whether you are faced with a good or an evil transcendence, God or a demoniac force, transascendence or transdescendence, that is to say (39). You can "go beyond," either up or, as in Bowles's novel, down, by mysterious forces that rejoin what is animal or primal but are not perhaps bad because of that (45). Mentioning such writers as Blake, Gide, D. H. Lawrence, and John Cowper Powys, Wahl de- clares, "Il s'agit pour eux de retrouver quelque chose d'élémentaire, de farouche, ange ou démon, qu'importe " (What concerns them is to recover something of the elemental, of the wild, whether angel or demon, it doesn't mat- ter) (40). This is a view reminiscent of Abbey's "God or Medusa" and Goethe's conception of the demonic. Wahl's proposition was presented at a conference where it was vigorously resisted by the Christian existen- tialist Gabriel Marcel, who perceived Wahl as wanting a transcendence that exalts our powers by emphasizing subterranean parts of ourselves, or "le Dieu sombre " (the shadow God), and reinforcing a kind of visceral consciousness that we have of our existence. Marcel protested that this involved a denaturing of ideas of good and evil by reducing them to a bioenergetic meaning (113-14). Wahl replied, very much in tune with my argument here, that he wanted to recover a primitive idea of the divinity of nature that does not necessarily presume the idea of a God (118). In an interview with Oliver Evans, Bowles answered Evans's suggestion that the desert in The Sheltering Sky resembled the ocean in "The Open Boat" in that both presented a nature that was "not inimical but merely indifferent" by responding, "Precisely. Not caring. Unaware. And if you use the word God in place of nature, then I think you get even closer to it" (C 55). Clearly the God in question is not the Christian one, nor is the view of nature the Words worthian one. But the formulation makes perfect sense in relation to the concept of the sublime I have been developing, in which absence, power, and terror are the operative concepts. Much of what I have said about The Sheltering Sky I could also say about another extraordinary American novel, Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. But since Dana Phillips has already said it, and brilliantly, in his American Literature essay "History and the Ugly Facts of Blood Meridian ," I shall limit my commentary to summarizing Phillips's essay. Phillips sees the precedence of landscape over character in Blood Meridian , noting that "McCarthy seems to have largely dispensed with the concept of character in fashioning his material" and that "the descriptive [as opposed to narrative and thematic] or 'earth' sciences such as geology, meteorology, astronomy, archeology, evolutionary biology, and paleontology" are paradigmatic for</page><page sequence="60">Representations of Nature in American Writing 277 Blood Meridian (441). Indeed, it seems at times that the rock formations in the novel come closer to being protagonists than the humans. Phillips avers that "persons are not privileged as subjects" and agrees with Vereen Bell that the novel is "a critique of our culture's anthropocentrism," noting that in the novel "the human does not stand out among the other beings and objects that make up the world" (443). In sum, "the American West in McCarthy's novel is not the New World but a very old world, the reality of which is bedrock. We might periodize him with some confidence, then, as a writer not of the 'modern' or 'postmodern' eras but of the Holocene, with a strong historical interest in the late Pleistocene and even earlier epochs" (452). The human action in the novel is mostly barbaric slaughters, fitting the harshness of the landscape, a Darwinian world of cruel struggle. I will add to Phillips's incisive reading only that one can see in Blood Meridian the motif of transdescendence, particularly in the figure of the horrifying, charismatic Judge Holden. Finally we must address another mode of representing nature with the human aspect of it subordinated: film. Of course, landscape paint- ing and photography have long been a privileged form of representing nature, often with the human presence used primarily to indicate natural grandeur of scale or even airbrushed out. The films I will discuss do this as well. I do not confine myself to American film; this would misrepre- sent the extent of the complex interplay between the humanizing and the naturalizing of the natural world in the intensively, obviously necessarily, technological world of films. (In several cases I cite commentary by the filmmakers. These are drawn from the Special Features sections of the films' DVDs, unless otherwise indicated.) Also films, by the very nature of their technology, have an ambiguous relation to the real. As an imme- diate, visual experience they immerse us in a reality that has, of course, been scripted, choreographed, and, literally, filtered. So the gap between nature and its representation is heightened in film. The first film is the The Proposition (2005), from Australia, which Roger Ebert aptly compared to Blood Meridian : "This movie comes close to re- alizing the vision of that dread and despairing story." Directed by John Hillcoat and written, his first screenplay, by the dark Australian singer/ songwriter Nick Cave, The Proposition depicts the outback in terms nota- bly more Darwinian than Wordsworthian. Indeed, the bizarre Jellon Lamb (played by John Hurt in a bravura turn), who owns a rambleshack dwell- ing in the middle of nowhere, cites Darwin's Origin of Species to explicate the bestiality of life there, explaining, "I was in days gone by a believer but alas I came to this beleaguered land and the God in me just . . . evaporated. Let us . . . toast sir, to the God who has abandoned us." The movie begins with historical photographs of late nineteenth- century Australia overlaid by Andrew Young's poignant song "There Is a</page><page sequence="61">278 Anthony Channeil Hilfer Happy Land/' based on Psalm 149: "There is a happy land far, far away / Where saints in glory stand, bright, bright as day." It is immediately clear that this happy land is not the outback: we see the bullet-ridden cabin and photographs of the bodies of the Hopkins family, sadistically murdered, the wife after being raped by the notorious Burns gang. In the next scene, two of the Burns brothers are captured by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) after a shootout at the Burns shack that resembles the grim scenario at the Hopkins homestead. Captain Stanley holds the obviously feeble-minded Mikey as a pawn, telling his brother Charley that he will execute Mikey on Christmas day unless Charley kills the dangerous and elusive leader of the gang, his older brother Arthur Burns. This is the proposition that provides the plot of the film. But what is most memorable is the opposition and con- nection between the Darwinian natural world, of which Arthur is a prime representative ("a monster, an abomination" the captain terms him), and the "civilized" world of Captain Stanley. Stanley himself reflects, "Australia, what fresh hell is this?" but declares his mission to convert it: "I will civilize this place." His home shows a val- iant attempt to do so, with its middle-class English interior complete with paintings and flowers growing in a garden separated from the badlands by a pathetically fragile wooden fence. Contrasting this are sublime scenes in the outback, where Charley finds Arthur and the two soulfully watch an amazing orange-and-red sunset from a mesa as Arthur recites poetry. The plot motif here is that Charley narrowly misses a chance to push Arthur off the mesa, but more interesting is how Arthur unsettles our view of him by his heart- felt love of the natural world, his spontaneous recitation of poetry, and, later, his singing of traditional ballads. In James Fenimore Cooper's Deerslayer, the characters with soul and moral goodness are distinguished from the coarser, evil ones by their love of nature; in The Proposition a central character is a psy- chopathic killer with an aesthetic appreciation of poetry and the outback. The film further complicates the moral paradigm when the mayor of the town, Mr. Fletcher, insists that Stanley break his pact with Charley and subject Mikey to a hundred-stroke flogging that will clearly kill him. The captain resists Fletcher, threatening to shoot a member of the town mob that gathers to conduct this lynching, but breaks down when his wife joins the mob, carrying a very Victorian parasol to protect her from the sun. Earlier Stanley's wife called him a good man, and he responded that she was a good woman. The mayor, as he partakes of tea served on fine china with the captain and his wife, compliments the wife as "well-bred," a loaded comment given the Darwinian citation earlier in the film. And as the mayor conducts the sadistic flogging, he addresses the town as "my good people." They are good enough that when they actually witness the flogging they forced, it is too much for them, to the point that the whip- man, at his forty-eighth stroke, flings down the whip in revulsion and the</page><page sequence="62">Representations of Nature in American Writing 279 captain's wife faints at the reality she did most to force. Thus the line be- tween civilized and savage is blurred from both sides; as Danny Huston, who plays Arthur Burns, notes: "The good guys are bad and the bad guys are good." (At least intermittently.) Certainly the tendency toward cruelty and violence is present in all the characters. One of the background songs features Nick Cave singing, "Clean hands, dirty hands." In the film's conclusion the gang rides into town disguised in the uni- forms of troopers they have killed to free the dying Mikey. Significantly, they are not at all distinguishable from the troops. In a series of significant juxtapositions, Charley rides off with the dying Mikey, buries him, and then has second thoughts about what Arthur and the rest of the gang are doing, which is going after the captain and his wife. Meanwhile Arthur and the rest of the gang ride along, intending rape and murder, as Arthur reflectively muses, "The mountains, the trees, the endless plains, the moon, the myriad stars. Every man can be quiet and complete." Then we see the captain and his wife, who have just sat down for Christmas dinner, with turkey, candles, and wine, making their prayers: "For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us grateful." At which point the gang breaks in, beats the captain, and prepares to rape his wife. The prayer is paralleled with an obviously ironic recall of the captain's question, "What fresh hell is this?" and Jellon Lamb's remembrance of God abandoning him. The in- terrupted ritual of Christmas prayer is succeeded by the gang's intended ritual of rape and murder, a repetition of the Hopkins massacre, itself in- terrupted by Charley entering, blowing the head off of the gang member atop Mrs. Hopkins, and shooting Arthur in the chest. His motivation is his simple declaration, "No more" - as close to a non-ironic moral statement as the movie ventures. This is clearly far from John Wayne country, and the director indeed comments that the film is an "Australian take on the Western," with an "epic landscape" and centered on "conflict with the cli- mate." The ending is mixed, since the captain and his wife at least survive, whereas Arthur, dying, takes his final look at the land before him and asks Charley, "What are you going to do now?" This brilliant film concludes without an answer. In the conflict with the climate, the climate ties. In the Chinese film Mountain Patrol : Kekexili (2004), written and direct- ed by Lu Chuan, the climate wins, though its antagonists, the Mountain Patrol, are valiant indeed. In one brilliantly developed scene, a lone pa- trolman's car becomes stuck in the sand, losing traction. The patrolman surveys the possibilities, stepping to the side for another angle. He has stepped into quicksand that engulfs his torso. He flails backward, and his movement sinks him deeper. Finally we witness him slowly, inexorably swallowed up, and then the camera backs off, leaving as the only sign of his former presence on earth the empty car. Here is a total immersion that cannot be introjected, much less celebrated.</page><page sequence="63">280 Anthony Channell Hilfer Though the scene was probably inspired by the famous quicksand scene in David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, Lean's rather than Chuan's seemed derivative to me (having watched the two scenes back-to-back). The scene in Lean's movie is less harrowing: rather than dying alone, the boy in the film has his friend and a chic-looking Lawrence desperately attempting to rescue him; the film palette is a bright, almost cheerful Tech- nicolor that has no hint of the irony, à la Crane, of how lovely nature can be as it is doing you in; and there is welling, fruity, melodramatic music apparently emanating from the desert sand. The mission of the Mountain Patrol can and should be celebrated. They were in fact as well as fiction a volunteer group who attempted to police the poaching that threatened the extinction of the Tibetan antelope. They drove through some of the hardest, most unforgiving terrain on the planet to protect this species, regarded as sacred in Tibetan religion. There are moving scenes of the men watching the sky in a part of the world where the stars are fully visible, and a powerful episode with a burial service com- plete with prayer wheels to the dead antelopes they have to burn. They do this work out of a genuine and not culturally rewarded reverence for nature. Richard Gere is not around to present them with a donation. And besides the sublime but difficult and dangerous terrain, their antagonists, the poachers, are better armed; the film opens with the image of a patrol- man asleep in his vehicle, only to be awakened, kidnapped, and eventually murdered by the poachers. In the last scene we see the funeral of the lead- er of the group, also killed by poachers, bringing the film full circle. The seeming futility of the patrol's struggles is contradicted by a written coda noting that a newspaper story about the patrol and the film itself led the Chinese government to form a military patrol that had the resources to cut down on the poaching. Yet this is outside the frame of the film, which is a story of defeat at the hands less of the poachers than of the region's forces. This was clearly what the audience of the film perceived - the Wikipedia entry notes, "The harsh landscape preys on friend and foe alike, blurring traditional distinctions between good and evil." Internet Movie Database (IMDb) commenter Andrew Graf noted the "incredibly vast, unforgiving, yet hauntingly mesmerizing landscape," and another IMDb commenter sees that "the movie's greatest asset is its truly terrifying portrayal of the fragility of man in overwhelming environmental situations." This "breath- takingly beautiful, yet ultimately deadly landscape," as Kazuo Kiriyama described it on IMDb, is yet another instance of the natural sublime. This landscape clearly impresses through its visual power and latent terror. An even more interesting movie for our purposes is House of Sand (Casa de Areia, 2005), a Brazilian film directed by Andrucha Waddington and starring his wife and mother-in-law, Fernanda Torres and Fernanda Montenegro, respectively. Fernanda Torres plays two roles: Aurea, the</page><page sequence="64">Representations of Nature in American Writing 281 wife of the madman who drags his wife and mother-in-law to a particu- larly barren and desolate part of northern Brazil; and Aurea' s daughter, Maria. Fernanda Montenegro plays Aurea' s mother, Maria, and also an older Aurea. The two Fernandas, as they are known in Brazil, are national treasures of their country, and their performances in this film amply jus- tify this status. But just as great a performer in the film is its setting in a desert seacoast near the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park. As A. O. Scott declared in his New York Times review, "The land is such a presence in this movie that it almost takes on the status of a character." He admires "the bold, primal emotions and the almost classical dignity of the main characters." As I shall show, these were qualities provoked by the setting as much as the story. Or, to put it more accurately, the setting is the story. As Rob Nelson said in the Village Voice , the film is "a purely visual experi- ence: sensual shots of gargantuan sand dunes appear at least as important in storytelling as the faces of [the] three women [. . .] who are forced to traverse this barren landscape." And the film's theme is "what it means to come and go when one's house is not a home but the earth itself." The concept for the movie derived from a photograph the director saw of a house inundated by a dune. During filming, the dunes dominated the director, actors, and crew as much as they did the characters. Conse- quently I will draw not only on the film but also on the moviemakers' informative commentary on the film's DVD. The movie begins with a long aerial shot of the sand dunes, followed by a level one, both shots showing an immensity empty of any sign of human presence. Then a line of men and mules appear at the left corner of the screen, struggling against the wind as they climb along the top of a dune. Finally the focus moves to a close-up of the strained faces of two panting, wind-ravaged women, Maria and Aurea, as they ascend the dune. The husband has to physically force his wife into the sorry hut that is to be their homestead amid the dunes. When he dies in an accident brought on by his enraged madness, the wom- en attempt to find a way back to the civilized world but realize they are trapped; they gradually begin to adapt with the help of an escaped slave who eventually becomes Aurea' s new man. We see Maria tracking gulls for their shells, bringing home a crab, and eventually raising goats, and both women discard their heavy city dresses for looser garments more suited to the terrain. Finally, Aurea gets the chance to leave and resists it, though her daughter (also named Maria) does go. This is basically the plot of a movie one of its makers described as "minimalist." The considerable beauty and power of the film derive from its set- ting and how the experiences of the director, actors, and crew duplicated those of the characters. Fernanda Montenegro's response upon reaching the film location was, "Oh my God, we're on the moon." And Fernanda Torres made the remarkable declaration that "I owe much of my work</page><page sequence="65">282 Anthony Channell Hilfer in the movie to the wind, the sun, the rain, the hassles, the beauty." The participants became very much aware of the parallel between the opening scene of the movie and the making of it: an obsessed director taking his wife and mother-in-law to an extraordinarily hostile locale to which they had to adapt. As Waddington noted, "The difficulties became elements of the movie." He realized that "we couldn't fight nature here with all its power, so we decided to incorporate it." Also, "Our main challenge was to hang in there." What they needed to do and did was to turn their "prob- lems into solutions." The mud on the actresses' clothes was real mud, the sand in their hair real sand and, like the characters, they had to continually deal with the sand. One of the characters declares, "The sand sweeps ev- erything away," and in actuality it not only caused major discomfort in the temporary shelters of the cast and crew but also disabled their equipment cars and messed up the cameras. One of the most memorable images in the film occurs when Aurea returns from a brief foray into "civilization," a camp of scientists there to study the eclipse of 1919. She plans to leave with them for the city, but when she returns to her mother's house much of it has been encroached upon by the dune and Maria has disappeared into the sand. Here, as in Kekexili, is a total immersion, an ultimate sign of nature declaring its nonnegotiability. Yet, of course, it is negotiated via the film itself. The desert world was the source of the film's major paradox. This movie comes as close as any I know to showing a pristine natural world, and one technique it uses to do so is to emphasize the distinctness of the single lines of the characters' footprints on the vast surface of the dunes. But, naturally, the moviemak- ers had to continually hide not only their cars and equipment but also their tire tracks and foot tracks, that is, the signs of their presence as portrayers of this pristine scene. Also, as Waddington declared, the landscape was too beautiful, the sky too blue to give a sense of the land's harshness the movie meant to show, so the filmmakers turned the sky a grayish white, dimming the scenario down. Perhaps the most beautiful moment in the film comes when Aurea sees the 1919 eclipse, which of course was depicted through pure movie technology. So even in this empty world the eye of the be- holder must intrude for it to exist and put us into a state of awe. Finally, I want to mention the film version of The Perfect Storm (2000), not because of the studio-created movie magic of a ship climbing per- pendicularly up monstrous waves, as impressive as such scenes are, but because of a scene that takes place onshore in a government office. Two meteorologists are watching a computer screen, and one of them realizes that three major weather events are converging. In strained but measured tones he declares, "You could be a meteorologist all your life and never see something like this. It could be a disaster of epic proportions. It could be the perfect storm." The meteorologist is safe from the storm, an onlooker</page><page sequence="66">Representations of Nature in American Writing 283 and diagnostician. He understands it scientifically while simultaneously feeling a sense of awe toward it. Jan Rosiek notes that "the natural sub- lime is one of the places in which we may still encounter an otherness that has eluded technological objectification" (104). Yet here the sublime power of nature is exactly what has been recorded by instruments of tech- nological objectification. We might call this the Technological Sublime. The film shows this mighty storm overwhelming the intimate lives of the men on the boat and their companions and lovers onshore. The sublime has intruded on their being. But we are witnessing it as art and tragic enter- tainment, via a curiously ambivalent spectator position. That is, as I have argued, a prototypical state of the sublime.</page><page sequence="67">284 Anthony Channeil Hilfer 6. Blowback The term "blowback," which officials of the Central Intelligence Agency first invented for their own internal use, is starting to circulate among students of international relations. It refers to the unintended consequences of policies that were kept secret from the American people. What the daily press reports as the malign acts of "terrorists" or "drug lords" or "rogue states" or "illegal arms merchants" often turn out to be blowback from earlier American operations. - Chalmers Johnson, Blowback We know we are in trouble, near or at the tipping point where environ- mental problems become disasters. We know too that we have brought this on ourselves by overloading our world with toxic material, blind to actions that exceed natural limits. It is blowback time. This chapter makes no attempt to preach to the choir on this theme but rather aims to elucidate some literary and cinematic parables on the etiology of our present crisis and our failure to respond adequately to it. The following stories are clear- ly parables, with discernible morals, depicted in broad strokes because our desperate circumstances and our blindness to them demand it. Jack London's "To Build a Fire" was written in 1910, well before "glob- al warming" (more accurately termed climate change) became apparent. But it is a parable, a rigorously realistic fable, of hubris, of overstepping the limits. In keeping with its simple, almost algebraic, form, the story's protagonist is not granted a proper name; he is only "the man." The plot: the man goes out alone on a very cold day in the Klondike, hits a spot in the snow with underlying water that soaks his feet, builds a fire to warm his feet before they freeze, makes an elementary mistake in doing so, and dies. Underlying this simple structure, like the water beneath the snow, is an ironic verbal texture that reiterates "he knew," "he knew," "he knew" three times in one paragraph to build to the revelation that he did not know enough, that his dog knew better: "It knew that it was no time for traveling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by his judgment" (7). But in his complacency, the absence of sun, the "intangible pall over the face of things [. . .] did not worry the man" (3). Even when he realized that it was well below fifty, "the temperature did not matter" (5). The man has two fatal limitations: he lacks a philosophical perspec- tive, and he is self-reliant. The lack of philosophical perspective appears at first as only a character flaw, but something more is implied from the length of London's usually spare character depiction: But all this - the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weird-</page><page sequence="68">Representations of Nature in American Writing 285 ness of it all - made no impression on the man. [. . .] The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of tempera- ture, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe. (5) In effect, the man dies because he lacks respect for the power and danger of the natural world's sublime force, because he is unable to imaginatively conceive of his place in nature. He also fatally underestimates his need of other men. When he sup- poses that he has built a sufficient fire, he celebrates his self-sufficiency: The fire was a success. He was safe. He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he had saved himself. Those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them, he thought. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who was a man could travel alone. (18) And then the tree under which he foolishly built the fire cascades snow from its branches and snuffs the fire. So much for rugged individualism: "If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now" (20). The man does make another stab at building a fire, but to grip the matches he must take his gloves off, and his fingers are so numb with the cold that his most determined attempts to hold the matches fail, and he must recognize the chill of the losing game. This chill is literal and it leaves his body as disconnected from the world around him as his imagi- nation had been: "He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth" (26). Shortly after, "the man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging at the end of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find where his hands were" (27). Merleau-Ponty notes that for certain injured patients "an unsound sense of touch calls for special movements designed to localize stimuli, and for the same reason the patient substitutes, for tactile recognition and perception, a laborious de- coding of stimuli and deduction of objects" (109). In the man's case, he</page><page sequence="69">286 Anthony Channell Hilfer must substitute his eyes for his tactile recognition and perception in a profound phenomenological disconnect. But he has been disconnected all along, and finally he dies of it. The New York Times columnist Verlyn Klinkenborg is I think precise in indicating how confrontation with wil- derness demands a recognition of its autonomous reality: "When I say the grace of wildness, what I mean is autonomy, its self-possession, the fact that it has nothing to do with us. The grace is in the separation, the distance, the sense of a self-sustaining way of life." The man in London's story is too certain of his own supposed autonomy, self-possession, and self-sustaining way of life to be fully aware of the world he is in, and he dies from his philosophical deficiencies. The same symptomology is evident in Patricia Highsmith's futuris- tic horror story "Please Don't Shoot the Trees." Written in 1977 and set in 2049, Highsmith's story anticipated gated communities - hers being on a far greater scale - as well as those disasters the Authorities assured us could never happen, Three Mile Island (1979) and Chernobyl (1986). She also goes William Faulkner one better: in his story "Golden Land," his protagonist daydreams, pleasurably, of an earthquake that causes Los Angeles to slide gently into the Pacific Ocean, whereas in Highsmith's story it actually does. Both stories probably reflect strong attitudes about Southern California. Highsmith's protagonist is Elsie, a housewife married to a nucle- ar engineer, Jack, and living in Rainbow, a community in Golden Gate, one of four big states that America has been partitioned into. Rainbow is protected from nearby Los Angeles, one of the great cities that have "become unsupervised prisons of the poor and the black" (362), by bat- teries of laser weapons. Elsie's husband and other Authorities dismiss warnings that widespread nuclearization of energy has been having ill effects on the trees in Rainbow, although the trees now seem to be actively fighting back, aiming acid sap at the forestry operatives working for the nuclear plants. The forestry engineers respond by shooting the trees and executing what is nicely called, with a perfect play on scientifico-military technobabble, "counterbombing" - underground nuclear explosions de- signed to head off an earthquake but of course about to cause one. Elsie's husband keeps telling her what she comes to realize is the official story about everything being under control, though for some reason he is wear- ing an asbestos suit. Elsie realizes during Jack's reassurances that he is in a "semi-trance" (369), the one we frequently see on television in official spokespersons explaining how well things are really going despite vari- ous eruptions of what looks a lot like what we used to call reality. In the event, Jack is zapped by a tree, a clearly justifiable homicide, and Elsie, who has somehow retained an ethical sense, refuses rescue and, as she feels her house start the slide into the Pacific, reflects that it was "right</page><page sequence="70">Representations of Nature in American Writing 287 to go like this, conquered by the trees and by nature" (372). As a parable this over-the-top version of environmental apocalypse catches a technol- ogized culture in denial of the harm it does to nature and of the blowback from this harm. The third of my exemplary narratives is Werner Herzog' s extraordinary documentary film Grizzly Man , about Timothy Tread well, the self-anointed protector of Alaskan grizzly bears. Unlike the man in London's fable and like Jack in Highsmith's, Treadwell does not lack imagination; rather than an antagonist of the natural world, he is a would-be savior of it. In fact, he wants to join it: "I will be one of them," he proclaims of the bears. He believes himself to be respectful of them, declaring that they have been "misunderstood," and even that "I know the language of the bear." These hubristic statements come from Treadwell's extensive footage of his stay in the bear country, footage that Herzog, who should know, declares to be remarkable filmmaking. At the least, it is a remarkable document of Treadwell's swings between wild exhilaration and paranoiac rage at sup- posed poachers and what he imagines to be his own persecution by the Park Service. Some of the footage is lovely indeed, as in a sequence that Herzog, in the course of a collaborative editing of Treadwell's film, res- cued from the cutting room floor. It shows images of fox paws going over the top of Treadwell's tent, an unforgettable scene. There is no doubt that Treadwell loved the bears and foxes that he encountered, perhaps not wisely but too well. In the event, the Park Service and the curator of a Kodiak museum understood the bears better than Treadwell and better respected them as well. For instance, Treadwell, soliloquizing to his camera, repeatedly assures us of the danger he is in and how brave he is in facing up to it. Yet as Herzog mentions in an in- terview with Chris Garcia, "In the history of Alaska since 1903 or so not more than twelve people were killed and eaten by grizzly bears. Eighty times more people die from wasps in the United States than from bear attacks." Of course bears are dangerous to anyone who invades their turf and, worse yet, tries to become their best buddy. The Park Service rule, which Treadwell proudly ignores, is to stay one hundred yards away from any bear. Sven Haakanson, the Kodiak museum curator and a lifelong Alaskan, says of Treadwell's overfamiliarity, "You don't do that. You don't invade on their territory." Moreover, "for him to act like a bear the way he did, would be the ultimate of disrespecting the bear and what the bear represents." Treadwell, he says, "crossed the boundary." In certain scenes we see Treadwell petting an adult bear. He believed he was safe in doing so because, he claims, "I earned their respect by stand- ing my ground." Treadwell, as one observer said, was given to "acting like he was working with people in bear costumes." He gave cute names to the bears - Ed, Rowdy, the Grinch, Sergeant Brown - and talked to them as if</page><page sequence="71">288 Anthony Channell Hilfer to children. Herzog says, in his interview with Garcia, "He has a sentimen- talized, Disneyfied view of wild nature [. . . ]." Bernd Heinrich, in an essay on March of the Penguins , notes of such film fantasies, Paradoxically, the cartoonish anthropomorphism of "Bambi," al- though it entertained the youngsters, blocked rather than promoted an understanding of animals. In "Bambi" we do not see other crea- tures. Instead we are presented humans with antlers, and with our thought and speech. This is what the traditional idea of anthropo- morphizing is - expecting animals to feel and behave like humans, which they never will. At first glimpse this may seem like the identifications I examined in Thoreau, Broyles, and Abbey. But they are invested in the animal world precisely be- cause of its otherness; the last thing they wish is to humanize it. They want to be the animals, though they are well aware of the impossibility of this wish; they have no wish for the animals to be tame, humanized. Herzog respects Treadwell as a filmmaker and a unique human be- ing but has a running argument with Treadwell's humanization of nature. In a voice-over Herzog declares, "I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony but chaos, hostility, and murder," a view in consort with the writings of Bowden, Bowles, McCarthy, and even some of Thoreau's. He sums up his response to bears in a fashion antithetical to Treadwell's: "What haunts me is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. To me there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears, and their blank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food." While I think it possible that bears have a bear understanding of their world, and it is secret in that we have only the most inferential and speculative access to it, I see Herzog' s attitude toward the bears as more respectful than Treadwell's. And I should mention that the image we see as Herzog delivers his stark credo is the face of a bear, with his brown eyes looking uncannily into ours. Eventually, Treadwell and the woman companion whom he all but completely edited out of what he was claiming to be a solitary trip were killed and eaten by a grizzly from a different ranging ground, an old and probably starving bear who took up an opportunity. Although it wasn't one of Treadwell's bear friends, its actions were a tragic and gruesome form of blowback. Ecologists have long discussed the dangers of our persistent anthro- pocentricity. Max Oelschlager cites George Santayana citing John Muir: A Californian whom I had recently the pleasure of meeting observed that if the philosophers had lived among your mountains, their sys- tems would have been different from what they are. Certainly very</page><page sequence="72">Representations of Nature in American Writing 289 different from what those systems are which the European genteel tradition has handed down since Socrates; for these systems are ego- tistical; directly or indirectly they are anthropocentric, and inspired by the conceited notion that man, or human reason, or the human distinction between good and evil, is the center and pivot of the uni- verse. That is what the mountains and the woods should make you at last ashamed to assert. (180) The portal for self-transcendence of the culture's blindness is, I have argued, the sublime: "The sublime is the inhuman, the realm of things beyond our- selves, the dimension of otherness we can never know" (Arensberg 1). This indeed is built into the etymology of the word: "sub," up to; the "limen," lintel, doorway The word's primary meaning is "set or raised aloft, high up," and, figuratively, expresses the senses taking off, "of flight" ( Compact Oxford English Dictionary , 1944). It is the boundary, the threshold, of our experience of the cosmos, where we must try to see beyond ourselves and cannot. It is also, for the contemporary self, at the border of consciousness, i.e., subliminal, hence the problems of representation I have noted. A recent and excellent study of the disenchantment of nature and the thinning out of the self is Frank B. Farrell's Subjectivity ; Realism, and Postmodernism: The Recovery of the World. Farrell, like Lynn White Jr., sees religion as playing a pernicious role: "In order that God's power would be absolute, nature had to lose its necessity and eternity, its determining power as a region where entities had, on their own, their substantial na- tures and their proper values." Worse yet, in the modern period the finite human thinker takes over some of God's functions as subject. The qualities that things once were taken to have on their own migrate across the subject /object divide and are seen to be determinations imposed by the self (secondary quali- ties, substance, causality, value, and the like). The world becomes ever more neutral and insubstantial as the environment in which human willing makes itself real. [. . .] It seems we have repeated the cycle of medieval philosophy, only with ourselves in the place of God. (2) As James Applewhite demonstrates in "Postmodernist Allegory and the Denial of Nature," poststructuralism takes reductiveness one step fur- ther, locating it in a language of signifiers without signifieds, "a closed system of signs acknowledged to have only internal references" (7) as "critical theory engages in a language-centered version of the Cartesian dichotomy between mind and universe" (8). Applewhite finds in the art produced under this dispensation "a central inability to relate to nature" (3) and concludes that</page><page sequence="73">290 Anthony Channeil Hilfer we know the first nature [as opposed to the poststructuralist primacy of the second nature of the socially constructed] is still there, because we can breathe. It is possible to breathe back an art which relates us to this origin, celebrates the glory of our original association with it, and directs what may become an effectual anger at the forces which paper our horizons with money-imagery: value dissociated from a referent in nature. (16-17) I have considered such art in this text. Finally, Morris Berman describes the kind of consciousness our denatured, cyber-fried society is moving toward: Our culture is starting, without much questioning or critical evalua- tion, to acquire a kind of "computer consciousness" [. . .] both video games and home computers create a similar view of the world for mil- lions of people [. . .] both convey the notion that reality is a function of programming, and children as well as adults pick up a certain type of vocabulary from their use. The general result, I suspect, is a vast subculture that lives entirely in its head, that sees reality as essentially neutral, value-free, and especially disembodied, a form of pure men- tal process, (qtd. in Devall and Sessions 90) Gyorgi Voros describes how the Rocky Mountains were for Wallace Stevens what Ktaadn was for Thoreau: "a shocking reminder of the in- corrigible Otherness of the vast nonhuman bulk of nature, impervious to human meanings or metaphors" (45). The incorrigibility of the otherness of nature, as well as the contemporary repression of recognition of what- ever is not easily subordinated to social selfhood, is what makes nature so contradictory to our customary modes of thought. Hence the epidemic of paradoxy in the nature writing I have explored, and its resemblance to the discourse of negative theology. As Oelschlager cites Max Duerr as saying, "We may even have to sacrifice the ability to represent such experiences in a generally intelligible way in return for achieving the abil- ity to experience them" (9). Similarly, Robert Roshi cites the Diamond Sutra's dictum "Dwell nowhere, and bring forth that mind," going on to define Nowhere: "'Nowhere' is the zero of purest experience [. . .]." (in Devall and Sessions, 234). This real is where my writers have ventured in their very negations. In the face of the desert, the mountains, the ocean, they felt wonder, "an inclusive name for our most significant feelings in response to nature, an abrupt and non-referential awe." We might ques- tion "non-referential," as these writers were immersed in matter, but the critic I quote, Rob Wilson, goes on to say, "Wonder is non-referential in the sense that as a feeling it seems unrelated, by cause or analogy, to the rest of life" (76). The negations of the nature writing in this study are</page><page sequence="74">Representations of Nature in American Writing 291 responses to an inadequate conception of nature, as argued by Thomas Weiskel: "There can be no sublime moment without the implicit, dialecti- cal endorsement of human limitations" (44). In fact, the sublime is "built on the failure of the beautiful and its reconciling fictions" (45), as I have shown in Crane's great story. And "the sublime, it would seem - at least the negative sublime - leads to alienation in all its forms. The beautiful, on the contrary, leads to a reconcilement in which the critical, 'negative' power of art is in danger of melting away" (46). I see no such danger of reconcilement in any writer in this study. Summing Up Blowback will grow in frequency and severity so long as we remain oblivi- ous to "the way the rest of the world - the nonhuman part - exists apart from us and our languages" (Campbell 133). The writers I have discussed in this study would not be happy at having a moral attributed to their work; Thoreau declared, "What offends the most in my compositions is the moral element in them" (Journal 1: 316). But I do believe a com- mon vision can be discerned, as sketched herein. Central to this vision is a sense - not a social construction, but a visceral, experienced, sensu- ous awareness - of the otherness of the natural world, and a reverence for it. This sense should not be confused with the pre-Darwinian view of a fostering, sympathetic, quasi-providential nature. On the contrary, as the poet William Stafford proclaims, "What disregards people does people good" (qtd. in Love 233). What we need is a kind of modesty, not personal modesty so much as species modesty, such that "the smaller we come to feel ourselves compared to the mountain, the nearer we come to participating in its greatness" (Arne Naess, qtd. in Devall and Sessions 202). To feel small in relation to the mountain - or the ocean, or the desert - we need to recognize it as other and as real, both problematic recognitions for the Christian, modern, and postmodern selves. Difficult for the Christian self because, as Lynn White Jr. has argued, this self is taught to believe that "no item in the physical creation had any purpose save to serve man's purposes" (9). Difficult for the modern self because nature has undergone a reduction to secondary qualities and has only instrumental reality. And difficult for the postmodern self because linguistic idealism leads this self to believe there is no reality except in social construc- tions. These three modes of contemporary selfhood have in common the disenchantment and derealization of nature. Nature becomes the unrecognizable other. From the deep ecological perspective of the wil- derness philosopher Max Oelschlager, "the relation between the human species and the 'other' - that is, the wilderness itself - is not simply one</page><page sequence="75">292 Anthony Channell Hilfer of exploitation and domination. Instead, wild nature and culture are understood as organically related. So viewed, the destruction of things wild and free will entail the collapse of any civilization that rests upon them" (8). Hence blowback. The University of Texas at Austin Austin , Texas NOTES 1. Terry Gifford declares that there is much evidence to show that those of us living in large industrial cities [. . .] still need to have unmediated contact with nature. A study of the therapeutic value of trees for hospital patients found that, compared with patients whose windows looked out onto brick walls, those whose windows gave them a view of trees required fewer painkillers and were discharged earlier. The frame here is a healing one. We not only need this sort of contact, we need to communicate it, examine it, and share its meaning through our symbolic sign systems. Our semiology of nature keeps us sane by reminding us that we are animals. ('The Social Construction of Nature" 29-30) My argument would be that so long as understanding and respect for the oth- erness and autonomy of the wild natural world are maintained and nature is not swallowed up by ego and commodity, it would be absurd to deny the curative power of nature or the delights of ecotourism. 2. The strongest argument for the conventionality of Thoreau's rhetoric in "Ktaadn" is in Lawrence Buell's magisterial The Environmental Imagination, 12-13. 3. H. G. Wells's comment seems exact: "In style, in method, and in all that is distinctively not found in his books, he is sharply defined, the expression in literary art of certain enormous repudiations" (671). 4. A contemporary variation on the need-to-blame theme is in Russell Banks's The Sweet Hereafter. 5. Compare Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan : This perpetual feare, always accompanying mankind in the ignorance of causes, as it were in the Dark, must needs have for object something. And therefore when there is nothing to be seen, there is nothing to accuse, either of their good, or evill fortune, but some Power, or Agent Invisible : In which sense perhaps it was, that some of the old poets said, that the Gods were first cre- ated by humane Feare: which spoken of the Gods, (that is to say of the many Gods of the Gentiles) is very true. (88) 6. The actual poet was, of course, a woman, Caroline Norton. The poem is "Bingen on the Rhine" (see Monteiro 1984). 7. William Stafford's poem "Coyote," the speaker of which is eponymous, is another instance.</page><page sequence="76">Representations of Nature in American Writing 293 8. Paul Woodruff, in his book Reverence, persuasively distinguishes reverence from religious belief, especially religious orthodoxy. Reverence is a response fre- quently felt toward the immensities of the natural world and is characterized by an awe that transcends selfhood, not by obedience to a doctrine. Comparable is Jan Rosiek's distinction between "sacred" and "holy": As opposed to the meaning of its near equivalent, holy ( sanctus , saint), the notion of the sacred can be used as a purely descriptive term by neutral ob- servers, who wish to make no ontological claims for divinity nor to endorse it in the way a believer may do in faith or conduct. It is not by accident that something is holy but is held sacred; the former is related to claims about the divine itself, the latter to the perspective of a human beholder. (7) It is true that some of the writers in this study seem to see nature as holy. But not moral; instead they echo Rudolf Otto's desire "to invent a special term to stand for 'the holy' minus its moral factor or 'moment'" (30). WORKS CITED Abbey, Edward. Desert Solitaire.
