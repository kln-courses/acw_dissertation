<plain_text><page sequence="1">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 161 Francis Cromphout From Estrangement to Commitment: Italo Calvino's Cosmicomics and T Zero* Edited &amp; Translated by RMP Some of the most remarkable works of Italian SF stand on the margins of the genre-certain of Dino Buzzati's stories, for example, or Primo Levi's Storie Naturali. This generalization applies as well to Cosmicomics (Le Cosmicomiche, 1965) and T Zero (Ti con zero, 1967) by Italo Calvino. Yet Calvino seems to have thought it necessary to discourage labelling him a writer of SF.I "The prime difference...," he writes in the Preface to La Memoria del Mondo (The Memory of the World, 1968), "is that SF deals with the future, whereas each of my narratives refers to a remote past" ("La prima differenza...e che 'science-fiction' tratta del futuro, mentre ognuno dei miei racconti si rifa a un passato remoto": p. 5)2-even, we may add, to a "prehistoric" past. Still, the views of certain other eminent critics of SF moderate these reservations of Calvino's. Brian Aldiss tells us, for instance, that "[i]n reality there is no future" because we can only imagine a future by drawing upon elements of the past and/or present (p. 11); and comple- mentarily, Darko Suvin speaks of SF's use of the present and the past "as special cases of a possible, historical sequence seen from an estranged point of view" (p. 21). Moreover, the estranged or distantiated perspective that for Suvin typifies SF, while it requires "an alternative historical hypothe- sis" (p. 49), does not necessarily dictate that the fiction be set in the future. The cognitive enterprise which-again, according to Suvin-SF is engaged in can just as well be conducted in terms of the past. This, at any rate, is Calvino's usual mode of proceeding; and it is one that qualifies as S-F for another reason as well. That other reason has to do with the connection Calvino makes between his imaginary worlds and science. "I would have scientific data serve for propelling me out of the [fixed] habits of the imagination, and also for living the quotidian at the farthest limits of our experience," he says in his Preface to Memoria ("lo vorrei servirmi del dato scientifico *An earlier (and somewhat different) version of this essay appeared in French in Just the Other Day: Essays on the Suture of the Future, ed. Luk De Vos (Antwerp: Restant, 1985), pp. 495-507.</page><page sequence="2">162 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) come d'una carica propulsiva per uscire dalle abitudini dell'immagina- zione, e vivere anche il quotidiano nei termini piu lontani dalla nostra esperienza": p. 6). He thus in effect differentiates his own work from a sort of SF which we might call reactionary on the grounds that it employs scientific argument to make an imaginary situation suit the standards and expectations of the status quo. In contrast to such, Calvino seems to be suggesting (in his own terms) that he is writing fiction which relativizes existing norms-that he is engaged in the same kind of "cognitive estrange- ment" which characterizes the best SF.3 In exploring that point and matters relating to it, I will be treating Cosmicomics and T Zero as constituting a single literary project.4 My immediate justification for doing so is that the stories in the earlier of the two volumes and those in Part One, at least, of T Zero have in common four significant elements: (1) they feature Qfwfq, also as narrator; (2) they employ SF models; (3) they recurrently display a similar structural pattern; and (4) they are informed by a binary code, with the characters fulfilling a symbolic function. At the same time, they also satisfy Suvin's definition of SF as a genre which is: (a) cognitive, (b) pluridimensional with respect to (historical) time, and (c) estranged, or unconstrained by any reality principle (thought to be) operating in the actual world of the author and her or his addressees. An estranged perspective is so crucial to Calvino that one critic, naming it a "pathos of distance," has observed that it totally determines Calvino's poetic mode of expression.5 Furthermore, it governs not only the cosmic aspects which Cosmicomics and T Zero share with certain other works of SF but also the comic aspects deriving from them. In fact, irony and humor are Calvino's usual means for critically distancing what we take to be reality, for escaping from the narrowness of vision by which we reductively manage the world's complexities. "What I am looking for in humorous or ironical or grotesque or comic-strip-like transfigurations," he declares, "is a way out of the limitation and univocality of any representa- tion or judgment...[is] a type of distancing from the particular, a sense of the vastness of everything" ("Quel che cerco nella trasfigurazione comica o ironica o grottesca o fumistica e la via d'uscire dalla limitatezza e univocita d'ogni rappresentazione e ogni giudizio...questa specie di distacco dal particolare, di senso della vastita del tutto": Una pietra, p. 157). Calvino's originality in the realm of SF perhaps lies with this combin- ation of imaginary and comic estrangement. Let me begin, then, with some remarks on the most evident ways by which he achieves that estrangement, and take up afterwards-and in reverse order-the remaining two criteria of Suvin's outlined above. The first feature that we encounter in .these "cosmicomical" tales is the scientific text which usually appears as their headnote or epigraph and advances a hypothesis or theory concerning the origin of the universe (or</page><page sequence="3">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 163 some part thereof). The scientific idea thus focussed on is one that Qfwfq seemingly confirms in his ensuing narrative as he bears witness to a course of events predicated upon and dramatizing the preliminary hypothesis. This proof, however, redounds parodically against the scientific notion that Calvino highlights; for at every turn, the reader confronts the non-sense of an absurd situation that Qfwfq through his narrative renders credible (more or less).6 In "The Distance of the Moon," for example, the hypothesis in question is G.H. Darwin's, according to which the Moon used to be very close to the Earth before tidal forces pushed it away. This notion is applied logically to the "prehistoric" reality Calvino portrays, and in a manner that gives a kind of plausibility to the fictive goings-on. But those goings-on are in themselves fabulous, consisting as they do of excursions to the Moon, primarily for the collecting of moon-milk. We find the same kind of incongruity exploited for comic effect on a stylistic level. Repeatedly Calvino uses mundane or banal expressions from everyday experience in connection with grandiose facts about the formation of galaxies, the evolution of species, and so forth. Amidst occurrences of such cataclysmic proportions, we have Qfwfq exclaiming "no use shouting" (C51; "avevi un bel gridare": p.64) or "[Attaboy idiot]"** (C87; "Bravo furbo": p. 106)-verbal responses incommensurately incommensurate with what is happening. This incongruity also operates at the level of incident, and with the same risible consequences-as when, for example, Qfwfq and Pfwfp play a game of marbles with the hydrogen atoms that steady-state physics posits (in "Games Without End"). The foregrounding of attitudes deriving from our daily experience but malapropos and/or inadequate in their cosmi-fictional context works toward a similar purpose. Thus, in "At Daybreak," for instance, the sojourn among the whirl of particles constituting a nebula prompts a foolish desire to scratch oneself "because-they can say what they like-all those [little] particles spinning around had [no other] effect than a troublesome itching"** (C19; "perche, si ha un bel dire, ma tutto questo vorticare di particelle non aveva altro effetto che un prurito fastidioso": p. 28). This last sentiment bespeaks an anthropocentrism that Calvino exploits in his cosmicomic tales as a kind of literary topos. All of them abound in **I have used William Weaver's translations of Cosmicomics (C) and T Zero (T) but have modified these to bring them into closer accord with the Italian original. Such modifications appear in brackets, which in these cases (only) signal devia- tions from Weaver-meaning substitute words, not simply or necessarily additions to his text. The translations from other works of Calvino's quoted are my own, as corrected by Maria Rita Rohr. (A few of the essays in Una pietra sopra, have been published in The Uses of Literature [San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986]; but those translations, by Patrick Creagh, are highly problematic.) Finally, it may be worth explaining that I have supplied the Italian original because when it comes to Calvino much is lost in translation (a comparable case would be Lem's).-RMP</page><page sequence="4">164 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) specifically human actions and concepts, thus expressing an attitude which fits in with the author's critical and cognitive objectives. "This anthropo- morphism," he writes, "I have accepted and fully vindicated as fundamental literary procedure....This is also a way to put to the test the most obvious, lazy, and vainglorious image of man: to multiply his eyes and nose all round him so that he no longer knows where to recognize himself' ("questo antropomorfismo l'ho accettato e rivendicato in pieno come procedimento letterario fondamentale....[Q]uesto e un modo di mettere alla prova l'imma- gine piu ovvia e pigra e vanagloriosa dell'uomo: moltiplicare i suoi occhi e il suo naso tutt'intomo in modo che non sappia piu dove riconoscersi": p. 188; emphasis in original). Another means for estrangement that Calvino sometimes resorts to involves techniques drawn from comic strips. These generally appear in fictive situations described in schematic fashion with the help of literary collage and featuring a rapid succession of incidents. This comic-strip procedure, operating at a primary level ostensibly to assist the reader in following the thread of the story, is something that Calvino explicitly calls attention to and comments on in "The Origin of the Birds": There's no use my telling you in detail the cunning I used to succeed in returning to the Continent of the Birds. In the [comic] strips it would be told with one of those tricks that work well only in drawings. (The frame is empty. I arrive. I spread [glue] on the upper right-hand corner. I sit down in the lower left-hand corner. [Enter] a bird, flying, from the [top] left. As [it] leaves the frame, [it remains glued by the tail. It continues] flying and pulls after [it] the whole frame [adhering] to his tail, with me [seated] at the bottom, allowing myself to be carried along. Thus I arrive at the Land of the Birds. If you don't like this story, you can think up another one: the important thing is to have me arrive there.) (T24) [E inutile che racconti dettagliatamente l'astuzia con cui riuscii a tornare nel Continente degli Uccelli. Nei fumetti andrebbe raccontato con uno di quei trucchi che vengono bene soltanto a disegnarli. (I1 quadretto e vuoto. Arrivo io. Spalmo di colla l'angolo in alto a destra. Mi siedo sull'angolo in basso a sinistra. Entra un uccello, volando, da sinistra in alto. All'uscire dal quadretto resta incollato per la coda. Continua a volare e si tira dietro tutto il quadretto appiccicato alla coda, con me seduto in fondo che mi lascio transportare. Cosi arrivo al Paese degli Uccelli. Se questa non vi piace potete immaginarvi un'altra storia: l'importante e farmi arrivare la.) (Ti con zero, p. 30)] This facetious account, whatever else may be said about it, exhibits a literary self-consciousness which, once again, serves for the estranging of cognition. Our next set of considerations applies to SF's pluridimensionality. Here we can look upon the retrospective emphasis in Calvino as a response</page><page sequence="5">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 165 to the impasse confronting us in our efforts to imagine the future. Not only are those efforts questionable by reason of what Aldiss observes about them (as we have already noted); they have also become highly problem- atic insofar as the very basis for such projections from the past (and present) can no longer be taken for granted. Jean Baudrillard contends as much in his Les strategies fatales. That philosopher, starting from Elias Canetti's view that our culture has lost the linear thread of its history, argues that along with this loss of historical perspective goes a loss of reality. In consequence, he contends, we are witnessing "the end of linear time" (Baudrillard: 20). But if that be true, how can SF accomplish its prodigious mission of projecting this irrecoverable past into an imaginary future? While refusing to deal in (mirage-like) futures altogether, Calvino delineates the utopian longing which SF often attaches to them in another way: he imports a utopian dimension by his manner of evoking the par- ticulars of a "prehistoric" past. Insofar as that past is (self-consciously) hypothetical (in significant part, by reason of its foundation, as it were, in the "scientific" headnote introducing each fictive vision of it), it in effect addresses the problem which Baudrillard poses (and does so with a ven- geance). But at the same time, it represents a world expressly different from, and contradictory to, the present, largely for being open to Possi- bility.7 Nor is that the only sense in which this past counts as Utopian. In every version of it (and each of the cosmicomical tales has its own), it is always the place where harmony, unity, and happiness are-or were. Accordingly, the movement from past to present always entails the passage from order to chaos, from unity to division, from happiness to misery-a passage whose emotional impact Qfwfq testifies to in his own "person" and one which often brings with it his realization that he has been (self-)deceived, the victim of an impersonal con game, as it were. This is the case with Qfwfq in "The Distance of the Moon" well before the process of the Moon's distancing itself from Earth concludes with his separation from Mrs Vhd Vhd. At the very moment when his romantic dream of being alone with her seems about to be fulfilled, even then he realizes that "I should have been happy" (C13; "Avrei dovuto essere felice": p. 21) but is not-i.e., that such happiness lies in his past imagining of what this togetherness would (have) be(en) like. "Without Colors" follows a similar pattern of disillusionment. There Qfwfq's attempt to initiate the object of his romantic desire-here named Ayl-to the new world of colors (which Earth's acquisition of an atmos- phere is rapidly bringing into being) results only in his disappointment and solitude. As the totally grey world she is enamoured of disappears, Ayl disappears with it, "inside" it; so that the newly-"chromatized" world serves merely to impress on Qfwfq his sense of loss. Though splendidly colorful vistas are before his eyes, they can only make him sad:</page><page sequence="6">166 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) all seemed so trivial to me, so banal, so false, so much in contrast with Ayl's person, with Ayl's world, with Ayl's idea of beauty, that I [under- stood] that her place could never have been out here. And I realized with grief and fear that I had remained out here...and Ayl's perfect world was lost forever, so lost I couldn't even imagine it any more." (C60; italics added) [tutto m'apparve cosi insulso, cosi banale, cosi falso, cosi in contrasto con la persona di Ayl, con il mondo di Ayl, con l'idea di Ayl, che compresi come il suo posto non avrebbe mai piu potuto essere di qua. E mi resi conto con dolore e spavento che io ero rimasto di qua.. .e che il mondo perfetto di Ayl era perduto per sempre, tanto che non sapevo piu neppure immaginarmelo.... (pp. 73-74; italics in original)] The disenchantment that Qfwfq experiences thus comes from his conscious- ness both of Ayl's lost happiness and of the loss of his own happiness that accompanies it. The mastery of a new stage of evolution always end thus: in the aware- ness, after the fact, that the perfect world Qfwfq dreamed of was an anterior world. This subjective insight has its objective correlative, as "How Much Shall We Bet" demonstrates. There the two protagonists are wagering on predictions of coming events in a universe whose future holds increasing disorder (in this case, thanks to quantum leaps in particularity and the information overload that these cause). The race toward the future, [that] race I had been the first to foresee and [prognosticate], tended only-through time and space-toward a crum- bling into alternatives like [these], until it would dissolve in a geometry of invisible triangles and ricochets like the course of a [soccer] ball among the white lines of a field [which] I tried to imagine [as being traced] at the bottom of the luminous vortex of the planetary system. (C90-91) [(L)a corsa verso il futuro, quella corsa che io per primo avevo previsto e auspicato, non tendeva ad altro attraverso il tempo e lo spazio che a uno sbriciolarsi in alternative come queste, fino a dissolversi in una geometria d'invisibili triangoli e rimbalzi come il percorso del pallone tra le linee bianche del campo quali io cercavo d'immaginarmi tracciate in fondo al vortice luminoso del sistema planetario. (pp. 109-10)] This, like all the other cosmicomical tales, represents the passage from the past to the present world, figured (typically) in "How Much..." both as an awakening of consciousness to historical transitoriness and (correlatively) as the fracturing of primordial harmony, out of which division and aliena- tion emerge. Qfwfq is very much a part of this process, a prisoner-as in the above quotation-of a temporal maze or (as elsewhere) of the biolo- gical evolution compelling him from one stage to another. "After all," he says in a moment of disillusionment in "The Aquatic Uncle," "what could I</page><page sequence="7">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 167 do about it? I went on my way, in the midst of the world's transformations, transformed myself' (C8 1; "Ma poi, che farci? Continuai la mia strada, in mezzo alle transformazioni del mondo, anch'io transformandomi": p. 98). One of the chief images symbolizing this situation of imprisonment comes from genetics. Throughout "Priscilla," especially, each "living" creature (and particularly Qfwfq, of course) appears as a "past" product, as it were, of a conglomeration of possibilities which have not been ruled out and which tend to repeat themselves ad infinitum. These (non-)beings have no future, imprisoned as they are in the mechanisms of a memory that can only remember itself. Consequently, if Qfwfq and Priscilla were ever to find each other in a love encounter, it would merely be to duplicate the marriage of their ancestors. As if this genetic enchainment were not enough, there are also socio- cultural forces acting to the same effect. These are what pressure Qfwfq to adopt and adapt to the outlook of just-evolved amphibians (as against that represented by his Aquatic [i.e., piscine] Uncle) or the values of the New Ones as opposed to the Dinosaurs' (the species to which Qfwfq ostensibly belongs in the fiction so called). If nature and culture have a tendency to repeat themselves in unalter- able series, is there a way out for the individual? The narrator of "The Count of Monte Cristo," speaking of himself at this point in the third person, observes that the fortress from which he desires to escape "repeats in space and time always the same combination of figures" over and over again (T142; "ripete nello spazio e nel tempo sempre la stessa combina- zione di figure": p. 159). All of a sudden he becomes conscious of this possibility: that maybe the fortress extends progressively with the Abbe Faria's (his fellow-prisoner and alter ego's) exploratory excavations. And if the fortress is expanding (spatio-)temporally, perhaps the way out lies with retraversing time at a velocity superior to its extension. To free oneself, to find oneself outside, would then mean to find oneself in the past-in this case, precisely at the moment when the prisoner has not yet entered the fortress. The solution is therefore not to be found in the future: to escape from the prison, one has to move backwards in time-which involves getting rid of the consequences of the past, including-or perhaps, especially-those of one's own past. In Calvino, then, we have a kind of meta-Proustian "recherche du temps perdu," which operates-at least in principle-as a liberating enter- prise vis-a-vis the deterministic factors which would deprive us of our reality, our particular destiny. Such an enterprise, as it entails a reconquer- ing of time and history, requires a standpoint outside time. This parameter is what Calvino means by "t[ime] zero," or to. In the narrative explicitly devoted to that concept (as its title indicates), to repre- sents a moment definable only in relation to the moments following it. Neither it nor its "contents" yet "exist." But by the same token, this time-</page><page sequence="8">168 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) less parameter is Calvino's utopic laboratory as well as the observation point from which his imagery takes form. In "T Zero" it is the instant when the outcome of a hunter's having shot his arrow at a lion already springing at him remains radically uncertain. This split second designated to is a universe unto itself. It is the stop- frame moment (to use a filmic metaphor whose inadequacy Calvino ex- pressly examines in "T Zero") which would permit us to contemplate the sum of all the discrete points of time contained in this universe-second and thereby attain objective knowledge of to in all its spatial extensiveness. This implies that every spatio-temporal point-not just to, but tl, t2, t3, etc.- coincides with, or contains, all others. In which case there would be no difference between time and eternity (understood as an atemporal condi- tion), so that the writer would be cut off from (historical) reality. To obviate that problem, and also to observe to objectively, it is necessary to adopt a (temporal) point of view. And such a point of view- i.e., any, properly speaking-requires a subject looking at to from the outside (at least as it were). In that sense, we have not only to proceed to tl, to move in time, in order to get a fix on to, to stop time; we must also take a subjective position in order to be objective. This is where Qfwfq comes in: as a second parameter-a "prehistoric" one, we may call it, characterized by subjectivity and "pluritemporality," or a certain temporal omniscience. From the various stories in which Qfwfq figures, we know: that he "exists" in relation to a very distant past, that he is the witness to and an actor in different stages of the/his universe's evolu- tion, and that he develops in/over the course of time, undergoing multiple metamorphoses as the universe (by his account of it) evolves. He is the one who "remembers": "How well I know!-old Qfwfq cried-the rest of you can't remember but I can" (C3; "Lo so bene!-exclamo il vecchio Qfwfq- voi non ve ne potete ricordare ma io si": "La distanza della luna," p. 9). Being the protagonist of a quest in (temporal) reverse-of a process of consciousness which imaginatively recovers the past that (would) im- prison(s) us-Qfwfq is the cognitive instrument par excellence of Cal- vino's demystifying S-F enterprise. At any given (narrative) moment, we find Qfwfq heading towards, or already situated in, time-zero, the instant of suspension between one stage and another, the limbo between the no-longer and the not-yet. That is the case (described above) with Qfwfq the lion-hunter in "T Zero" and also (to take another simple example) in "The Aquatic Uncle," where he appears, suggestively enough, as an amphibian-i.e., as neither wholly a land creature nor a fish. He finally loses out, in that last-mentioned tale, to his fish-uncle in their rivalry over the beautiful Lll. She chooses in the end to return to the sea and live with the uncle because, unlike Qfwfq, "he's somebody who is somebody" (C81; "lui e uno che e uno": "Lo zio acquatico," p. 98). Still,</page><page sequence="9">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 169 Qfwfq prefers to maintain his half-way station: "They all had something, I know, that made them somehow superior to me, sublime, something that made me, compared to them, mediocre. And yet I wouldn't have traded places with any of them" (C82; "Tutti costoro avevano qualcosa, lo so, che li rendeva in qualche modo superiori a me, sublimi, e che rendeva me, in confronto a loro, mediocre. Eppure non mi sarei cambiato con nessuno di loro": "Lo zio acquatico," p. 99). Why? Because (as "The Dinosaurs" makes clear) his "place" affords him a standpoint which is (relatively) comprehensive, and is also one from which to judge the limitations of competing world-views. That standpoint-the moment to-figures in "The Origin of the Birds" as the moment when Qfwfq must forget all he has so far understood in order to enter the birds' new world and marry Or, their queen. This is a moment of transition from one kind of knowledge to another; and as such, it links the two kinds: For a fraction of a second between the loss of [all that] I knew before and the [acquisition] of [all] I would know afterward, I managed to embrace in a single thought the world of things as they were and [that] of things as they could have been, and [it came to me] that a single system [comprehended] all. The world of birds, of monsters, of Or's beauty was the same as the one [in which] I had always lived [and] which none of us had understood [to the bottom]. (T26) [Per una frazione di secondo tra la perdita di tutto quel che sapevo prima e l'acquisto di tutto quel che avrei saputo dopo, riuscii ad abbracciare in un solo pensiero il mondo delle cose com'erano e quello delle cose come avrebbero potuto essere, e m'accorsi che un solo sistema compren- deva tutto. Il mondo degli uccelli, dei mostri, della bellezza d'Or era lo stesso di quello in cui ero sempre vissuto e che nessuno aveva capito fino in fondo. (pp. 31-32)] This to, then, is (to borrow another of Calvino's cosmicomical metaphors) the moment at which the world's ideological crust breaks apart and becomes mobile, the moment for contemplating the plurality of equivalent worlds. That brings us to the cognitive dimension of Calvino's fictional pro- ject. Here a problem poses itself for any writer whose work aims at some "truth" as the object of knowledge. The problem, in brief and from a criti- cal standpoint, concerns the extent to which a literary text can be subjected to cognitive criteria of truth and falsity. I would argue (and elsewhere have) that the truth implicated in such a text is at once relative and dynamic.8 This can perhaps best be explained vis-a-vis a theory of correspondence symbolically enunciated as V ('p')=(p), where "V" stands for veridicality, "('p')" for some fictive content expressed in propositional form, and "(p)" for some proposition about extra-fictional reality. On that basis, we can</page><page sequence="10">170 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) observe that propositions of the latter sort (and hence, too, their fictive equivalents) are relative-i.e., they hold (or fail to hold) true in relation to the writer, the reader, and their respective socio-empirical environments. To say that such propositions are also dynamic means-what may apply to their fictive counterparts as well (as in Calvino's case)-that neither the persons nor the events to which they pertain admit of an essentialist (and therefore static) analysis. Calvino's cognitive undertaking is responsive to these two demands, of relativity and dynamism. Indeed, his ceuvre virtually amounts to a declara- tion of war against any (notion of) absolute or essentialist truth. This is unmistakable-to take one of a multitude of illustrative instances-in the satire of U(h)'s attitude toward the birds. To preserve his world from the crisis which the advent of the birds precipitates, the dogmatic U(h) first pronounces that novum "a mistake" and then tries to erase it (T16-17). Calvino formulates some of the basics of his critical vision quite straightforwardly in his essay "The Sea of Objectivity." There he describes an "I" imprisoned by the reality principle-immersed in object-ivity, "in the uninterrupted flux of what exists" ("...flusso ininterrotto di cio che esiste": Una pietra, p. 39). Consequently (and as he points out) the more one is part of that reality, the less one understands. That is why he argues for a literature of consciousness as opposed to an object-ive literature: "The moment that we would want to see arise from one as from another mode of understanding reality is always that of non-acceptance of the given situation, of an active and conscious jump, of the desire for contrast, of perseverance without illusions"9 ("il momento che vorremmo scaturisse dall'uno come dall'altro modo di intendere la realta, e pur sempre quello della non accet- tazione della situazione data, dello scatto attivo e cosciente, della volont'a di contrasto, della ostinazione senza illusioni": Una pietra, p. 45). By the same token, literature has to relieve itself of the weight of the established order, thereby "becoming a private fact which allows poets and prose- writers to express what oppresses them" ("diventando un fatto privato che permetta ai poeti e agli scrittori d'esprimere le loro stesse oppressioni": "Cibemnetica e fantasmi," in Una pietra, p. 179; emphasis in original). The danger, of course, is that the literary "reality" which the author means to set against objective oppression may in its turn introduce its own dogmatic order, one as absolute and essentialist as that which it proposes to overthrow. For this reason, Calvino speaks of levels of reality rather than of reality (as if it were) plain and simple. As he writes in an essay called "Levels of Reality," "literature knows the reality of levels and perhaps offers a better understanding of that reality than does any other cognitive approach" ("la letteratura conosce la realta dei livelli e questa e una realt'a che conosce forse meglio di quanto non s'arrivi a conoscerla attraverso altri procedimenti conoscitivi": "I livelli della realta," in Una pietra, p. 323; emphasis in original).</page><page sequence="11">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 171 Conscious of the proper value of literary language, Calvino is equally aware of its relativity. Here he points to the mutual challenge that literary and scientific discourse-systems present: as they at once call into question and stimulate one another, their mutual relations serve to warn the writer against believing that she or he has discovered an absolute truth. Moreover, the example of science may instruct an author in "the patient modesty of looking upon each achievement as making part of a perhaps infinite series of approximations" ("nella paziente modestia di considerare ogni risultato come facente parte di una serie forse infinita d'approssimazioni": "Ciberne- tica...," in Una pietra, p. 191). This same prudence, which takes account of the difficulty of knowing anything in view of the complexity of the realit(y)/(ies) being investigated, has its stylistic correlative: in the succes- sive attempts to convey some point, in the alternative ways of explaining that these offer, and in the frequency with which Calvino introduces propo- sitions with a "like," an "as if," an "almost" or an "a kind of" ("come," "come se," "quasi," and "una specie di"). These in fact are the linguistic markers of what Michel Tournier has wittily termed the principle of "Italo- Calvinism," which is characterized by "the concern to proceed in the investigation of things only while adhering tenaciously to the rational method, striving for exhaustive surveys and fearful of losing oneself in the infinite" ("le souci de n'avancer dans le decouverte des choses qu'en tenant fortement la rampe de la methode rationelle, le gout des denombrements complets, la peur de se perdre dans l'infini": p. 353). The principle of Italo-Calvinism becomes increasingly evident as we move from Cosmicomics to T Zero. It is barely visible in the former vol- ume, where sight of it is lost in the narratives as such; but in T Zero's, it is regularly-indeed, systematically-put into focus as a central subject of the fictional discourse. Time and again Calvino there calls attention to the how of what is being said-to the problematical how-as in this passage from "Priscilla": Narrating things as they are means narrating them from the beginning, and even if I [attack] the story at a point where the characters are multicell- ular organisms-for example the story of my [relations] with Priscilla-I [must] begin [by] defin[ing] clearly what I mean when I say '1' and what I mean when I say 'Priscilla' [in order to] go on to establish what [these relations were]. (T75) [Raccontare le cose come stanno vuol dire raccontarle da principio, e anche se si attacca la storia in un punto in cui i personaggi sono organismi pluricellulari, per esempio la storia dei miei rapporti con Priscilla, bisogna cominciare definendo bene cosa intendo quando dico: io, e cosa intendo quando dico: Priscilla, per poi passare a stabilire quali sono stati questi rapporti. (p. 83)] To get out of what would otherwise be a cognitively self-defeating situa-</page><page sequence="12">172 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) tion, Calvino poses this primordial requirement of reasoning thought in the metaphorical terms of an Archimedean mechanism (so to speak) for lever- ing the entire world: "I must understand the mechanism, find the [point] where we can [take in hand] and stop this uncontrolled process [viz., 'per- petual self-repetition']" (T92; "devo capire il meccanismo, trovare il punto dove possiamo mettere le mani per fermare questo processo incontrollato": P. 99). This kind of rationalistic undertaking could eventuate in a fixity of thinking. To avoid any such dogmatism, Calvino appeals to the mathe- matical principles of combination.10 These constitute a symbolic language, working with analogies and allowing for the elaboration of infinite possibil- ities from a finite number of givens. Transposed to the literary realm, the strategy of permuting "data" ad infinitum safeguards the critical spirit: "Literature arrives at this...through combinatory games which at a certain point become charged with preconscious content and give it voice; and it is by this liberatory way, opened by literature, that humans acquire the critical spirit and pass it on to culture and collective thought" ("A questo la lettera- tura arriva...attraverso giochi combinatori che a un certo punto si caricano di contenati preconsci e danno loro finalmente voce; ed e per questa via di liberta aperta dalla letteratura che gli uomini acquistano lo spirito critico e lo trasmettono alla cultura e al pensiero collettivo": "Cibernetica...," in Una pietra, p. 179). What Calvino has to say about "the critical spirit" of inquiry bears on a crucial difference between SF and myth: that "myth is oriented towards constants and SF toward variables" (Suvin: 27). Myth in that sense-i.e., as embodying the tendency to establish immutable concepts and relationships -is precisely what Calvino means to avoid by his critical method of endlessly permuting the fictive data. Put positively, he demonstrates for his readers that the state of affairs obtaining at any given point is only one variant among infinite possibilities. So, too, it is by means of the perpetual -and open-ended-mathematico-literary game which he plays that he imports a utopian parameter, enabling cognitive perception of the object- world in which the individual is immersed. Imagining for the sake of knowing-no more and no less than that is the task which Calvino reserves for the literary act. So long as writers remain immured in the world which they are endeavoring to describe, so long as they do not resort to imagination to depart from that reality, they must resemble Dantes in the Chateau d'If, incapable of comprehending how such a world is constituted and hence prisoners of it. "From my cell" -Dantes begins by telling us "I can say little about [how] this Chateau d'If, where I have been imprisoned for so many years, [is made]" (T137; "Dalla mia cella, poco posso dire di com'e fatto questo castello d'If in cui mi trovo de tanti anni imprigionato": p. 151). His-and our-power to escape such imprisonment is proportional to the ability to imagine things</page><page sequence="13">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 173 otherwise, and in that sense (and also by reason of its liberatory function) to construct a cognitive utopia. Or, as Calvino himself puts the matter in his essay "For Fourier": "Utopia as a city...cannot be founded by us, but [must] found itself within us, [must] construct itself piece by piece through our capacity to imagine it, to think it to the last detail" ("l'utopia come citta ...non potria essere fondata da noi ma fondare se stessa dentro di noi, costruirsi pezzo per pezzo nella nostra capacita d'immaginarla, di pensarla fino in fondo": Una pietra, p. 252). Calvino's works reveal not only the nature of his cognitive project but the motives behind it. I1 Chief among these is his impulse, or desire, to know; but this conceals other requirements, the first of which is the writer's need to establish an identity. That identity comes about through an act which is fundamentally semiotic. "A Sign in Space" represents that process of (self-)identification in somewhat parabolic form. There Qfwfq makes a sign in space, originally for the purpose of finding it again 200,000,000 years later-i.e., after a complete revolution of the galaxy he inhabits. That is, he wants to establish a point of orientation in the primal obscurity of space. Yet this same mark which would enable him to determine his spatio- temporal location is also the first mark of his own identity: "the sign served to mark a [point]...and at the same time [the] sign was [my sign], the sign of me" (C32-33; "il segno serviva a segnare un punto...e nello stesso tempo il segno era il mio segno, il segno di me": p. 43). Conversely, the loss of the sign means the loss of identity: "I had lost everything: the sign, the point, the thing that caused me-being the one [of that sign] at that point- to be me" (C35; "Avevo perduto tutto: il segno, il punto, quello che faceva si che io-essendo quello di quel segno in quel punto-fossi io": p. 45). The semiotic aspect of this search for identity is equally explicit in "The Spiral." There the secretion of a shell by Qfwfq-cum-mollusc stands in as a metaphor for the creation of a self-expressive linguistic artifact: "I wanted to make something [that would] mark my presence in an [unequiv- ocal] fashion, something that would defend [it,] this individual presence of mine[,] from the [undifferentiated] instability of all the rest....[Thus] I made the shell: [just] to express myself' (C145-46; "Volevo fare qualcosa che marcasse la mia presenza in modo inequivocabile, che la difendesse, questa mia presenza individuale, dalla labilit'a indifferenziata di tutto il resto.... [C]osi io facevo la conchiglia, cioe solo per esprimermi": p. 75). The quest for identity also involves the mastering of destiny. That is because the "I" which semiotically constitutes itself is neither an accident nor the consequence of any kind of predestination, but instead appears as the result of a reversible act wherein the sign, by the repetition of it, becomes charged with signification for its author and thus establishes the author's destiny/destination. The concept of destiny operative here resembles that which Baudrillard defines as "the precession of effect over cause" (p. 231). Indeed, "A Sign in</page><page sequence="14">174 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) Space" can be read as a gloss on that paradox. The sign in question is one which Qfwfq has made-i.e., caused-as the means for measurement by which he can orient himself in space-time. But for that very reason, the sign-as-effect requires that he rediscover it after 200,000,000 years. The sign, then, is an "effect" which in its recovery proves to be not only its own cause but also his cause and his destiny-i.e., it dictates that he return to it to know where he is and in that sense take on an identity, or become himself. This sense in which the sign that he has made makes him also has its cosmic correlative. That is, the case with his individual destiny applies to the universe as well. It, too, takes on a purpose thanks to the "effect" of the sign-or rather, of the multiplicity of signs engendered by the very first of them: "Now things were different...because the world...was beginning to produce an image of itself, and in everything a form was beginning to correspond [to function]" (C35-36; "adesso le cose erano diverse, perche il mondo...stava cominciando a dare un'immagine di se e in ogni cosa alla funzione cominciava a corrispondere una forma": p. 47). The formation of the shell in "The Spiral" has a similar impact on the world's "formal" destiny-an impact not unlike that of the placing of a jar on a Tennessee hill in Wallace Stevens's "Anecdote of the Jar": "[As] the shell had a form, the form of the world was also changed, in the sense that it now [compre- hended] the form of the world as it had been without the shell plus the form of the shell" (CI49-50; "Avendo la conchiglia una forma, anche la forma del mondo era cambiata, nel senso che adesso comprendeva la forma del mondo com'era senza la conchiglia piut la forma della conchiglia": p. 180). The proliferation of signs (on the part of Qfwfq's imitators, who want in their turn to mark their own position) makes for a problem, however. Ending in chaos, it sends the author back into the original state of undiffer- entiation which he had sought to escape through the invention of the sign in the first place. In the universe now there was no longer a container and a.. .contained, but only a general thickness of signs superimposed and [agglutinated], occupy- ing the whole volume of space; it was constantly being dotted, [very] minutely, a network of lines and scratches and reliefs and engravings; the universe was scrawled over on all sides, along all its dimensions. There was no longer any way to [fix] a point of reference: the Galaxy went on turning but I could no longer count the revolutions[-]any point could be the point of departure, any sign heaped up with the others could be mine.... (C39) [Nell' universo ormai non c'erano piu un contenente e un contenuto, ma solo uno spessore generale di segni sovrapposti e agglutinati che occupava tutto il volume dello spazio, era una picchiettatura continua, minutissima, un reticolo di linee e graffi e rilievi e incisioni, l'universo era scara-</page><page sequence="15">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 175 bocchiato da tutte le parti, lungo tutte le dimensioni. Non c'era piu modo di fissare un punto di riferimento: la Galassia continuava a dar volta ma io non riuscivo piu a contare i giri, qualsiasi punto poteva essere quello di partenza, qualsiasi segno accavallato agli altri poteva essere il mio .... (p. 51)] Semiotics thus turns out to be a double-edged sword: an instrument of self- identification-and conquest-but also of the loss of identity. Indeed, semiotics-identification can become a semantic prison: once established, the (sign-)system which Qfwfq inaugurates does, after all, turn into an obstruction to individuality and communication. This brings us to the second cognitive requirement in Calvino-for order in relation to the surrounding reality. Here we should first consider the perils of a certain kind of order. These we have already confronted in "Priscilla." There, as we noted, the "language" of chromosomes leads to an enshacklement in the repetitive-the self-reproducing-chains of nucleic acids. In the section of "Priscilla" called "Death," Calvino applies this point to all individualities-i.e., to discrete, or discontinuous, organisms, and chiefly, of course, to humans-as they enter into social units; and he does so in terms that take him from the biological realm to that of language proper (for which genetics has hitherto been the surrogate): [No sooner are we] out of the [continuity of] primordial matter [than] we are bound in a connective tissue that fills the hiatus between our discontin- uities[-]...a collection of signs, articulated sounds, ideograms, morphemes, numbers, punched cards, magnetic tapes, tattoos, a system of communi- cation that includes social relations, kinship, institutions...namely every- thing that is language in the broad sense. (T9 1) [Appena fuori dalla continuita della materia primordiale, siamo saldati in un tessuto connettivo che riempie l'iato tra le nostre discontinuita ...un insieme di segni, suoni articolati, ideogrammi, morfemi, numeri, perfora- ture di schede, magnetizzazioni di nastri, tatuaggi, un sistema di comunica- zioni sociali, parenteli, istituzioni...cioe tutto quel che e linguaggio in senso lato. (pp. 98-99)] Language as liberator from the indistinct may thus also perpetuate slavery, a bondage to itself which is all the more difficult to escape from because we are as much creatures of the language-system as it is of us. This makes for the situation which Dantes and the Abbe Faria must try to deal with in "The Count of Monte Cristo." Calvino's Dantes puts his faith in reasoning thought: "the only way to escape the [condition of prisoner]," he says, "is to understand how the prison is built" (T140; "l'unico modo di sfuggire dalla condizione di prigioniero e capire come e fatta la prigione": p. 154). There are, however, two time-proven methods for such rational thinking. One of these, the inductive approach, Dantes leaves to the Abbe Faria. The Abbe attacks the difficulties he encounters</page><page sequence="16">176 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) haphazardly: he ceaselessly excavates every which way in order to eliminate, by a trial-and-error process, "all possible errors and unforeseen elements" (T143; "tutti i possibili errori e imprevidenze": p. 157). Once he has done that, he figures, "[the] escape can [not not succeed]" (T143-44; "l'evasione non puo non riuscire": p. 157). But this method of blind experiment leads to a growing complexity: "The Abbe digs, digs, but the walls increase in thickness, the battlements and the buttresses multipl[y]" (T145; "L'Abate scava, scava, ma i muri aumentano di spessore, si molti- plicano le bertesche e i barbacani": p. 158). Dantes meanwhile takes the deductive route. He starts with the premise of a fortress from which it is impossible to escape-a perfect prison, a "utopia of a prison," so to speak. This allows him to contemplate the problem from outside the "reality" which (otherwise) contains him. He can therefore determine that "escape is possible only if in the planning or the building of the fortress some error or oversight was made" (T144; "solo se nella progettazione o costruzione della fortezza e stato commesso un errore o una dimenticanza l'evasione e possibile": p. 157). In that case, he can identify the way out by projecting his construct of the prison onto the real prison as ascertained by the Abbe's experiments so as to discover the point where the two fail to coincide. In that sense, but also for the sake of correcting any theoretical misconception, Dantes' deductive method requires the kind of experimental confirmation that the Abbe in effect offers: "the only way to reinforce the [conceived of] fortress is to put the real one continuously to the test" (T144; "l'unico modo di rinforzare la fortezza pensaia e mettere continuamente alla prova quella vera": p. 157). In this combination, whereby the inductive-particular approach is made subordinate to the theoretical-generalizing, the important thing is not so much to indicate the way out of the fortress prison-which is, after all, fictional (not to say meta-fictional)-as to guarantee an alternative world in which escape is possible. More precisely, and in Calvino's own words, what is wanted is "the place of the multiplicity of possible things" (T147; "il luogo della molteplicita delle cose possibili": p. 159). This search of Calvino's for another world, another order, gets its liberating effects from his representation-on both the verbal and a symbolic plane-of that place of multiplicity. He confronts his readers with a universe logically thought out, but informed by values and relations different from the ones initially supposed (which does not simply mean alien to our usual way of thinking). "The autonomous, logico-fantastical machine is dear to me inasmuch as it serves to enlarge the sphere of what we can represent to ourselves and to introduce into the limitations of our choices the 'absolute distancing' of a world thought out in all its details according to other values and other relationships" ("La macchina logico- fantastica autonoma mi sta a cuore in quanto [e se] serve...ad allargare la sfera di cio che possiamo rappresentarci, a introdurre nella limitatezza delle</page><page sequence="17">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 177 nostre scelte lo 'scarto assoluto' d'un mondo pensato in tutti i suoi dettagli secondo altri valori e altri rapporti" ("Per Fourier," in Una pietra, p. 252). Still, the mere construction of a conceptual utopia according to a logi- cally deductive principle does not necessarily produce liberation, properly speaking. Indeed "The Count of Monte Cristo" makes this precisely the point of issue concerning the hypothetical lines along which the manu- script-story-i.e., Alexandre Dumas'-might proceed. Facing all possible variants, as proposed to him by his lackeys, Calvino's Dumas makes his choice (in a manner cognate to Faria's) by deciding which to reject: "To plan a book-or an escape-the first thing [is] to know...what to exclude" (T15 1; "Per progettare un libro-o un'evasione-la prima cosa e sapere cosa escludere": p. 164). This eliminatory method, then, closes off possi- bilities. Yet it figures in a retelling of Dantes' story, which as it potentially reverses Dumas' ending, completely reopens those possibilities. Calvino's "Count of Monte Cristo" thus illustrates his intimate conviction that there is no such thing as reality established once and for all; or, in any case, he bets against the existence of any such fixed world. And if he be wrong, then there is truly no way out of (its) prison-something which his "Monte Cristo" also takes account of: in which regard, like Calvino's other alter- native fictive worlds, it exhibits extreme transformability. Next to the preoccupations with order and identity, we find in Calvino's cognitive undertaking a concern with the motive for the act of writing. Indeed the impulse behind his literary practice is a matter expressly dealt with, even thematized, in his cosmicomical (and other) narratives. What he says on the subject comes down to this: that writing is for him a form of action; to write, to express onself, is a way of "making." This is quite clear from "The Spiral," which represents the mollusc's making of its shell as an act of self-expression: "Now it's no use my piling up words, trying to explain the novelty of this intention I had; the first word I['ve] said is more than enough: make, I wanted to make....So I began to make the first thing that occurred to me and it was a shell" (C 146; "Ora e inutile che cerchi di spiegare accumulando parole la novita di questa mia intenzione, gi'a la prima parola che ho detto basta e avanza; fare, volevo fare....Cosi incominciai a fare la prima cosa che mi venne, ed era una conchiglia": p. 175). In Calvino, even the simplest organism can be conscious of an objectless desire to express itself through this kind of (self-)making. Thus the unicellular Qfwfq says: "desire moves you...to do....But...the only doing you can allow yourself...is that special kind of doing which is [telling]" (T67-68; "il desiderio muove a fare....Ma...l'unico fare che ci si puo permettere...e quello speciale tipo di fare che e il dire": pp. 74-75). This desire "to make"-or "to tell"-focusses on the other and the elsewhere, even if its object is not clearly fixed in the mind of the "I" that is the desiring subject. The Qfwfq of "Priscilla," for example, declares at the</page><page sequence="18">178 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) outset that he is in love without a referent, and soon makes it plain that he is looking for the Other-indeed, for Otherness: "my state of desire tended simply toward an elsewhere [elsewhen] otherwise" (T67; "II mio stato di desiderio tendeva semplicemente a un altrove altravolta altrimenti": p. 74). This total otherness he will encounter only through his own death as a unique and discrete being-in the continuity he generates in giving rise to two new unicellular organisms. The desire for the Other whose benefits he will not enjoy likewise propels Qfwfq-as-mollusc towards "making." Not possessing the eyes to see it, he can never appreciate the beauty of the shell he creates around himself-"So sight, our sight, which we were obscurely waiting for, was the sight that others had of us" (C152; "Cosi la vista, la nostra vista, che noi oscuramente aspettavamo, fu la vista che gli altri ebbero di noi": pp. 182-83). Furthermore, the image which he gives of himself is (logically) productive of eyesight: "An image...presupposes a retina, which in turn presupposes a complex system stemming from an encephalon" (C150; "Un'immagine presupponeva...una retina, la quale a sua volta presuppone un sistema complicato che fa capo a un encefalo": p. 180). In sum, by producing his own image he makes the specular world possible: All these eyes were mine. I had made them possible....With eyes had come all the rest, so everything that the others, having eyes, had become, [in] their every form and function, and the quantity of things that, [having] eyes, they [i.e., 'the others'] had managed to do, in their every form and function, came [out of] what I had done. (C 153) [Tutti questi occhi erano i miei. Li avevo resi possibili io....Con gli occhi era venuto tutto il resto, quindi tutto cio che gli altri, avendo gli occhi, erano diventati, in ogni loro forma e funzione, e la quantita di cose che avendo gli occhi erano riusciti a fare, in ogni loro forma e funzione, veniva fuori da quel che avevo fatto io. (p. 183)] This world resulting from the act of identifying oneself and of linguistic ordering is also the readers' world in the sense that its author always presupposes readers and continually addresses them (as an express or implicit "you"). In fact, it is a crucial part of his narrative project that Calvino is conscious of engendering an audience: "the successful project of a writer who matters entails the enucleating of a society of readers which distinguishes itself in some way from society as it is" ("il progetto di successo dello scrittore che conta implica l'enucleazione di una societa di lettori che si distingue in qualche modo dalla societa quale essa e": "Un progetto di pubblico," in Una pietra, p. 279). This awareness both of the writer's active part in generating a reader- ship and-what is equally constitutive of the literary act-of the reader's active role is, I think, the clearest way of envisioning literary commitment. It links up with the pragmatic view of literature, which locates the relation-</page><page sequence="19">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 179 ship of author and reader in their mutual meeting via the act of reading, or exactly where a literary work takes on a social character. We find this same revalorizing of the reader's part in the Roland Barthes who says: "Reading is not a parasitic gesture, the reactive complement of writing which we endow with all the prestige of creation and anteriority; it [i.e., reading] is a labor" ("Lire n'est pas une geste parasite, le complement reactif d'une ecriture que nous parons de tous les prestiges de la creation et de l'anteri- orite, c'est un travail": p. 17). It is this demand of praxis turned towards the reader-this commitment of the writer-that Calvino situates not on the "realist" level of mimetic content agreeable to the socio-linguistic norms which happen to be in force, but on the level of style, which in his case involves a distancing relation to those norms. As for literary commitment of a "realist" type-that, for Calvino, can only perpetuate the language reflecting the established standards which he is seeking to overthrow. It is precisely by stylistic means that Calvino evokes a multiplicity of cognitive possibilities in defiance of the world that holds us prisoner. "For me," he writes in "La sfida al labirinto" ("The Challenge to the Labyrinth"): there is only one expressive and critical problem: my first ethico-formal choice was in favor of solutions of reductive stylization; and although my more recent experience leads me to orient myself instead to the necessity of a discourse as englobing and articulate as possible which conveys the cognitive multiplicity of the world we live in, I keep believing that no valid solutions exist aesthetically, morally, or historically if they are not realized on a stylistic foundation. [I1 problema espressivo e critico per me resta uno: la mia prima scelta formal-morale e stata per la soluzione di stilizzazione riduttiva, e per quanto tutta la mia esperienza piu recente mi porti a orientarmi invece sulla necessit'a di un discorso il piu possible inglobante e articolato che incarri la molteplicit'a conosciutiva del mondo in cui viviamo, continuo a credere che non ci siano soluzioni valide esteticamente e moralmente e storicamente se non si attuano nellafondazione di uno stile. (Una pietra, p. 89)] Style, for Calvino, is commitment, then. And its result is an aeuvre which, though it affords the reader no definitive escape, does carry the hope that change is possible, that the incarcerating world of fixed concepts may yet be transformed in reality as it is in Calvino's cosmicomical fictions. NOTES 1. The fact that Calvino distances himself from what he considers to be SF is probably connected with the quality of Italian SF in the 1950s. Though that SF achieved a publishing breakthrough after the Second World War, both the</page><page sequence="20">180 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) literary value and the quality of the books themselves could properly be judged poor. The magazine Urania, for example, and the series "I romanzi di Urania" (published by Mondadori since 1952) mainly brought out incomplete trans- lations of popular subliterary Anglo-American SF. This is also true for the series "Mondi astrali" (see Curtoni and also Stragliati on this subject). At the same time, Italian SF writers published under English-sounding pseudonyms -e.g., Lino Aldani became "N.L. Janda" and Ugo Malaguti "Hugh Maylan." When Cosmicomics first appeared, most critics seemed to share Calvino's negative view of what was then considered to be SF. Thus the poet Eugenio Montale, writing in the newspaper I1 Corriere della sera spoke of Calvino's book as "SF inside out." Nor did Calvino himself discourage this negative attitude toward SF on the part of his critics. When Anne Marie Ortese, in her "Direct Line: Ortese-Calvino-Eyes to the Sky," declared it a pity that the image of the Moon was disfigured by recent conquests in space, Calvino answered that he was not seeking an escape from reality, but a conscious way to rethink the Moon and space, especially in giving them a new place in the world of language and imagination. To be sure, he did not add explicitly that traditional SF would not do this, but his lack of concrete references to illustrious predecessors seems to suggest as much. 2. It is worth noting at this point that the title La Memoria del Mondo is as ambiguous as its English equivalent-i.e., "the world" can be either (or both) the subject or object of the remembering process.-RMP 3. Calvino deserves the credit for having freed SF, previously considered to be subliterature, of its myths and of its predictive baggage. This is one of the things that gives his books critical value, at least in the view of Enzo Gallino: "Calvino knocks over all anticipatory myths common to science-fiction." Gallino seems to forget, however, that H.G. Wells, too, was a myth destroyer. According to Francesca Bernardini (p. 71), Calvino reacted especially against the kind of SF originating after World War II in Europe-SF proclaim- ing in its futuristic myths the naive belief in the unrestricted possibilities of human beings to conquer all natural limitations thanks to science and techno- logy, and thus (as Bernardini remarks) introducing in the present a future already conquered. 4. La Memoria del Mondo, though usually associated with Cosmicomics and T Zero, seems to me very different from them. Furthermore, Calvino him- self makes the same separation: "The experience of Cosmicomics is completed; what begins now is of another" ("L'esperienza delle 'Cosmicomiche' e esaurita: ne comincia un'altra": Memoria, p. 8). Cosmicomics and T Zero, on the other hand, form a macrostructure on the basis of the common elements listed in the body of this essay of mine. To be sure, there are notable differences between the two volumes. But just as their style evolves over the course of the stories they comprise, so the narrative character of Cosmicomics leads into the essayistic one of T Zero. On these matters, compare Bemardini, pp. 66ff.</page><page sequence="21">ITALO CALVINO: ESTRANGEMENT AND COMMITMENT 181 5. According to Cesare Cases, the pathological aspect of Calvino's work lies in his finding it impossible to identify with the characters and situations he creates. On the other hand, Cases also stresses the cognitive superiority of this attitude of distantiation. 6. Contardo Calligaris argues (pp. 91-92) that the cosmic and estranged character of Qfwfq lies in the abstractness of his being (he is a kind of eternal monad) conjoined with the fact that he lives in the human world and uses images typical for our way of speaking. To this observation we might add that Qfwfq is an extremely aposite incarnation of Calvino's cognitive estrangement in the sense that he is the kind of vehicle for subjective anthropomorphic projection onto extra-human reality as well as history who can maintain the uninvolved stance, the distance, requisite for cognition (at least of the Calvino- esque sort). 7. Here I would endorse Karl Mannheim's dictum: "A state of mind is utopian when it is incongruous with the state of reality within which it occurs" (p. 192). That was also one of the conclusions of my 1975 study (pp. 136, 141; see also Suvin's definition of utopia, p. 49). All this is to say not that Calvino writes in the utopian genre, but that he builds a utopic dimension into his works as a verbal construction and an epistemological system. 8. For more on "truth" in relation to "fiction," see my 1977 essay. 9. Here Calvino makes a stand against the nouveau roman as then conceived by Alain Robbe-Grillet, whom Calvino appreciates, but wants to keep his distance from, especially as far as his analytic method is concerned. 10. Calvino systematizes this permutational method in certain of his later works-e.g., II castello dei destini incrociati (The Castle of Crossed Destinies, 1973), in which the Tarot provides him with a combinatory principle. On this matter see my 1983 study, pp. 446-47. 11. In the discussion of Calvino's literary motives, I have profited from Bernardini's monograph, which is arguably the first thorough critical synthesis of Calvino. WORKS CITED Aldiss, Brian.

De l'estrangete a l'engagement: Cosmicomics et Temps zero d'Italo Calvino.-Calvino ne se considere pas comme ecrivain de science-fiction, et ce pour diffe'rentes raisons qui ont trait a' la fois a la situa- tion du genre en Italie a' l'epoque ou' Cosmicomics et Temps zero ont ete' publie's ainsi qu'a certains pre'juge's concernant la definition du genre, par exemple celui qui assimile la science-fiction au roman d'anticipation scien- tifique. Confronte's a' la typologie du genre telle que l'a e'tablie Darko Suvin, ces deux ouvrages, par leur demarche cognitive, pluritemporelle et distancie'e, s'averent toutefois appartenir a la grande litt6rature de science-fiction. Chez Calvino, cette dcmarche aboutit a' l'edification d'une utopie cogni- tive, fruit des exigences d'ordre, d'identite' et de pragmatisme qui corres- pondent aux themes repris tout au long des ecrits e'tudies. Pour l'e'crivain, l'wruvre litteraire qui en re'sulte implique un engagement situe au niveau stylistique.

(FC) Abstract.-Italo Calvino did not think of himself as an SF writer. This fact, however, has to do with the situation of SF in Italy at the time Cosmicomics and T Zero were published more than with certain prejudices about how SF is to be defined-such as the notion that the genre should be wholly identified with the novel of scientific anticipation. Given a generic typology like that which Darko Suvin establishes, the two works of Calvino's just mentioned can properly be claimed as belonging among the best SF by reason of their mode of proceeding, which is at once cognitive, pluritemporal, and estranged. This proceeding leads Calvino to construct cognitive utopian fictions, the product of the demands for order, identity, and applicability to the extra- fictional world, all of which are thematized in his "cosmicomical" stories. The result is an auvre which implies, especially on the stylistic level (in both the narrow and the broadest sense), an engagement on the part of the writer. Calvino, in other words, calls into question established norms of thinking in a way that also imparts the idea of the world's transformability. (FC)</page></plain_text>
