<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEW PROFESSOR WOLFSON'S PHIILO* It is perhaps impossible for one who is not a specialist in Hellenistic thought to do full justice to Mr. Wolfson 's latest contribution to his pro- jected Structure and Growth of Philosophic Systems from Plato to Spinoza. For only a specialist would have the detailed knowledge of the sources in the relevant languages which a full appreciation of the work requires. The fundamental thesis of its author has already appeared in The Philosophy of Spinoza (1934). That study emphasized the novelty of Spinoza's philos- ophy rather than its traditionalism. It gave reason to believe that Spinoza was trying to overthrow the type of religious philosophy which had become dominant in Western Europe through the Middle Ages and to return to the technique of the pre-Christian thinkers. The volumes which are now before us investigate the foundations of the philosophy which their author believes to have become eventually Scholasticism. They have been written by a man whose knowledge of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic is unquestionable and who has a first-hand knowledge of the most influential books written in those languages. This knowledge is supplemented by a familiarity with the modern commentaries composed upon these books. There are few scholars in this country whose equipment would be equal to the task of criticizing such a study and this review is written with a sense of great inadequacy. Fortunately it requires no more than a knowledge of English syntax and grammar to understand what Mr. Wolfson has accomplished. For he writes with unusual clarity, organizes his thoughts with exemplary self- discipline, has a gift of exposition which comes only from a mastery of one's subject-matter. Each chapter is constructed in such a fashion as to leave no doubt in the reader's mind about what is being demonstrated. From this point of view the work is a model. One is never puzzled by the meaning of Mr. Wolfson's thoughts nor by their possible inter-relations. To state the argument briefly, Philo is held to have introduced into Western philosophy a new principle, the principle that there was a body of knowledge, in his case the Old Testament, revealed by God and of un- questionable truth. The task of the philosopher therefore consisted in mak- ing this body of knowledge rational, in showing that its apparent inconsistencies were only apparent, and thus in exhibiting a systematic body of propositions where the casual or uninstructed reader would see a lack of organization. We might thus say, though the idea is not that of Mr. Wolf- son, that Philo took over the Scriptures as a natural scientist takes over a part of the empirically known world. The scientist sees as much disorder and heterogeneity as the non-scientist; but by means of his scientific prin- ciples he is able to organize and unify. Philo had a similarly various set of * Wolfson, Harry Austryn. Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity,'and Islam. Cambridge (Mass.): Harvard University Press, 1947.

It is no revelation to anyone to point out that his teehnique of unification was largely the allegorical method. Mr. Wolfson makes it clear that Philo did not assume everything in Scripture to be allegorical; on the contrary (I, 115 ff.), he is frequently willing to accept the literal or obvious mean- ing of a text. But he has certain rules which he follows in his exegesis. Thus no anthropmorphic expression about God is to be taken literally (I, 116). The rest of Scriptures must then be distinguished into various parts: (1) laws, (2) oracles delivered through prophets, and (3) psalms and other books "which foster and perfect knowledge and piety" (I, 117), i.e., the traditional Jewish division of the Bible into Law, Prophets, and Hagio- grapha. The first of these three divisions is again subdivided into the historical and the legislative, the former of which deals with the creation of the world and all other stories which are called by Philo "genealogical." None of the historical statements is entirely rejected by Philo (I, 126); they are accepted both as facts and as allegories. As for the legislative part, the question hinges on what is a law and what is not a law. Here Philo hedges and appears to rely on the priesthood to decide (I, 131, n. 110). That he does not decide for himself does not vitiate the distinction which he has made, but it certainly shows that one cannot read Scripture for oneself and see when a law is a law and when it is not. Thus authority, as in Catholicism, rests not only on the sacred texts but also on the inter- pretations of a specially trained group of interpreters. Now the use of the allegorical method, which, as Mr. Wolf son agrees (1,131), was also common in pre-Philonic Greece, depends on the previous acceptance of a body of knowledge in terms of which the allegory may be stated. So the natural scientist must have in the back of his head a set of assertions which he will call statements of fact, natural law, or methodo- logical principles in terms of which he will harmonize the data of crude experience. These are not simply descriptive assertions but, as everyone nowadays knows, syntactical rules, basic metaphors, experimental devices, and so on. These constitute a part of what might be called the proto- philosophy of the thinker, accepted by him at the time without question and which in his system is prior to any investigation. The allegorist similarly possesses a set of beliefs which he does not question and which in his system of interpretation constitute literalness. In Philo's case, the protophilosophy was a composite of ideas taken from the Pagan schools, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics largely. But he also of course possessed a set of religious beliefs which he stated in philosophic terms. These are given by Mr. Wolfson as follows: (1) the existence of the Hebraic God, (2) the unity of God, (3) divine providence, (4) the creation of the world, (5)the unity of the world, (6) the existence of incorporeal ideas, (7) the revelation of the Law, (8) the eternity of the Law (I, 165).</page><page sequence="3">PROFESSOR WOLFSON 'S PHILO 387 Some of these principles were similar to ideas held by the Pagans. But Mr. Wolfson is careful to point out, as far as that is possible, from Philo's own words, that though the verbal symbols might be the same, the ideas ex- pressed by these symbols were different. We shall not attempt to reproduce the book which we are reviewing, but for the sake of example merely illus- trate the difference in one case, the belief in the existence of God. The existence of God is asserted against the atheism of the Sceptics and the followers of Critias (I, 167) and those of Protagoras (I, 168 f.). This leaves Philo apparently in agreement with the Plato of the Timaeus, Aristotle and the Stoics. But now there arises the question of whether his God is the same as theirs. The principle of God's unity (I, 171 f.) is a denial of polytheism of any sort, a denial that there are any uncreated but creative beings [pla- tonic ideas], an assertion of God's self-sufficiency, and His ultimate "un- knowability and indescribability. It seems also to imply a denial of Aristotle's God, the source of the world's motion, co-eternal with the world (I, 175) as well as of the theism of the Stoics, which in his mind identified God and the world (I, 176 f.). In thus differentiating between Philo's ideas and those held by his pre- decessors and expressed by them in the same linguistic symbols, Mr. Wolfson has avoided the trap which too many historians of ideas have fallen into. He shows with great delicacy of discernment how in one case at least a philosopher's terminology is not identical with his doctrine. I do not mean to assert than any historian would admit such identity, and yet, if one may judge from actual practice and from the love of unity which seems so often to dominate historians, the use of such terms as "Nature," "God," "the Ideal," "the Reason," to cite only the more notorious instances, by a group of philosophers indicates not merely a community of language but a com- munity of thought. The works of Mr. A. 0. Lovejoy ought to have con- vinced the reading public of the dangers of this trap, but it is peculiarly agreeable to find another historian, working independently, coming to similar conclusions and using a similar technique to reach them. Aside from the benefit which an historian may acquire for his method of study, there are certain philosophical lessons which any reader might do well to ponder over. A man like Philo, learned in Pagan thought, might have been expected to put his greatest faith in what he had been taught by the use of his reason. Yet there would have been no need of his allegorical method had not the compulsive power of something admittedly inconsistent been greater than his scholastic discipline. The "irrational" was for him the truth; rationality was a trait which a philosopher might impart to the truth. But the philosopher was not apparently conceived by Philo as a man who might start with principles which in his time would have been called " self-evident" and who would then deduce from them more geometrico their implicit truths. On the contrary, reasoning is nothing more than a tool for finding the hidden harmony between apparently contradictory ideas</page><page sequence="4">388 GEORGE BOAS and it must itself be kept faithful to the ideas which it is attempting to harmonize. It is clear that no such attempt could be successful unless its maker first had a fairly clear idea of what the hidden meanings were whose harmony was to be made explicit by the reason. Thus the principle that all anthropomorphic statements about God must be allegorical is based upon the assumption that God is not anthropomorphic. Such an assertion is nowhere proved by Philo, nor would a reader of Mr. Wolfson's book suspect that he would have seen any need to prove it. Yet it was taken over bodily from his Pagan predecessors and had no more Biblical foundation than its con- tradictory. It would be interesting, but of course now impossible, to learn why certain philosophical ideas appealed so strongly to Philo. Why would he not admit, for instance, the destructibility of the material world? The proof-text for his belief is God's promise to Noah [Gen. ix, 11] that no flood should ever again destroy the earth (I, 348). But Christian philosophers were also to read that text and to accept it as true, and nevertheless they were willing to believe that the world was not only destructible but that it would be destroyed. In other words, the Biblical texts which required "ra- tionalization" might be rationalized in a variety of conflicting ways. Here again Philo's protophilosophy comes into play. How he worked it out can never be solved, though Mr. Wolfson is very ingenious in indicating what may have been his grounds for it. (He is also, it should be added, very cautious in not insisting that the reasons which he sets forth as possibly Philo 's were really Philo 's.) The protophilosophy was of course not entirely Greek. Though there are, as everyone knows, copious similarities between Philo's philosophic ideas and those of Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, a great many of them were also to be found integrated into the tradition of the Jewish Biblical commentators. In bringing these latter into the light of day, Mr. Wolfson has performed another service to historians of ideas. What now were Philo's contributions to philosophy, aside from the new problems which he set and the new method which he used to solve them? It may be well to spend a bit of our space on this question since, as we have said, Mr. Wolfson maintains (I, 103) that he is "not only in the midst of a general philosophic tradition, which was started with Plato, but he is also the founder of a new trend within that tradition-a trend which continued with- out any interruption for about seventeen centuries, terminating ultimately with Spinoza. " 1. One of the more important innovations of Philo appears to have been the concept of the Intelligible World (I, 227). Mr. Wolfson maintains that this is not the same concept as Plato's "Intelligible Place," [Rep. 509 D, 517 B] by which is meant simply the astronomical heaven, whereas for Philo the Intelligible World, as for the Neo-Platonists, it is the world of ideas. The importance of this innovation can be appreciated when one remembers its place in the Plotinian school. 2. Another innovation of Philo occurs in his proofs of the existence of</page><page sequence="5">PROFESSOR WOLFSON 'S PHILO 389 God and of the origin of knowledge. Here he accepts earlier tenets of the philsophers, but he adds to them the proof from revelation. Thus he avoids Plato's theory of recollection as a source of ideal knowledge and the Stoic theory of the innateness of the idea of God (II, 92). That God could reveal anything to anybody, except possibly through a Daimon, had not been con- sidered a possibility before his time and, if one accepted his belief in the existence of the God of the Old Testament, his theory might well have proved a solution of the problem. The popularity of revelation as a source of knowl- edge is known to every reader of the history of philosophy. 3. The ineffableness and unnameableness of God are a third innovation (II, 113). This is believed to follow from God's simplicity, as that term was interpreted by Philo, though it was also inherent in the Jewish practice of not pronQuncing the name of God. That the nature of a unique being could not be described seems reasonable enough, but unique beings are precisely those who have to be named. They are given proper names. But in a time when names, even proper nouns, were supposed to "mean" something, it is perhaps clearer why Philo thought the Jewish prohibition of speaking the name of God was philosophically justified. In any event, the ineffableness of God became, as is well known, an important thread in the texture of medieval, philosophy. 4. God is also unknowable for the first time in occidental thought (II, 150). His unknowableness, along with His ineffability, gives rise to the negative theology. The theoretical basis for the doctrine is God's unique- ness, being without genus or species or differentia, and having no accidents. It would not follow from this that God's acts could not be known or, one might imagine, that there could not be a mystic vision of Him. 5. Though using the term "natural law," Philo gives it a new meaning (II, 182). (a) Natural law does not exist alongside of statute, but is rather an historical stage of all law, coming before statute. It "existed prior to the laws revealed by God through Moses," (II, 182) but was incorporated in those laws. (b) Natural law is associated with certain persons of the pre- Mosaic age, especially with Noah and Abraham, each of whom was given knowledge of God's commandments. (e) The Logos was created by God before the creation of the world (II, 183) and the Logos was among other things the rational principles discoverable in cosmic regularity. Conse- quently, though Philo uses the old expression "according to Nature," he reads into it a Biblical meaning as transmogrified through his philosophy. 6. While accepting many of the traditional virtues, Philo adds to the list three of his own: prayer, repentance, and study. Mr. Wolfson makes out a good case for Philo 's originality in introducing these additions to ethics (II, 237 ff.) and shows how, though these terms were important in Greek thought, the Rabbinical tradition which Philo followed gave them a meaning which would not have been congenial to the Pagan mind. I fail to see how Socrates's prayer to Pan at the close of the Phaedrus or the hymn of Clean-</page><page sequence="6">390 GEORGE BOAS thes differs from prayers in the Hebraic tradition. But it is certainly true that repentance was not considered a virtue by any classical Greek writer with whom I happen to be familiar. It was considered better not to sin than to sin and to repent, and it must be remembered that Greek religion-unless perhaps in the mystery cults-had no myth or doctrine which could have presented man as guilty of a primordial sin. The Fall of Man in the Greek thinkers seems to have been attributed either to greed or pride or the desire to know what properly belonged to the gods, as in the Prometheus legend, or, as in Hesiod's account of the Five Ages, is simply left unexplained. Many Pagan thinkers to be sure accepted the legend of the Golden Age and knew that mankind had deteriorated morally since that time, and though some thought that there was a possibility of returning to the condition of primi- tive man, none, so far as I know, thought that repentance would be of any use. But then none of the Olympian pantheon had created the world and man as well; none had given his creature a commandment such as that ex- pressed in Genesis ii, 17. Consequently, though some Pagans believed in a primordial vice which had eventuated in man's degeneration, none could have interpreted this vice as the Rabbis had. As for study, in Philo this means study of the Law and the duty of teaching it to others. The lack of an organized church in Greece involved the lack of orthodoxy and the conse- quent absence of heresy. Fidelity therefore to a sacred text could have meant nothing to the Greeks before the Alexandrian period and after reading Mr. Wolfson's study, one begins to wonder whether it was not the influence of such men as Philo and the early Fathers which crystallized the tradition that certain earlier thinkers, e.g., Plato and Aristotle, were sacred. In Plo- tinus [Enn. V, i, 8, line 10] we find the words, "Such doctrines are not new nor are they modern, but were pronounced in ancient times, though in an undeveloped fashion, and we today are but the exegetes of those doctrines proved to be ancient by the writings of Plato himself." And there follows an attempt to show that even the pre-Socraties had dimly seen the principles of Neo-Platonism. The tractate in which this appears is fairly early, being the tenth in the chronological order of Porphyry, and thus shows that Plo- tinus near the beginning of his career had taken his stand as a member of a school, not as an innovator. If it be true that philosophy as exegesis began with the Alexandrians, then the suspicion that many historians must have had that the conception of "schools" of philosophy is late becomes fortified. Such comments must suffice as praise for this really great work. No re- view would be complete, however, unless its author also indicated points of disagreement. A few of these follow: 1. Mr. Wolfson accepts the legend that Aristotle had two philosophies, an esoteric and an exoteric. In fact, he goes further than this and states, "In general, it may be said that the practice of keeping certain doctrines secret was common among all schools of Greek philosophy" (I, 25). The authority for the latter of these beliefs is Clement of Alexandria, for the</page><page sequence="7">PROFESSOR WOLFSON 'S PHILO 391 former, Aulus Gellius. It will, I believe, be found that no one before the Hellenistic period believed in the existence of esoteric doctrines and that Plato's comment on Protagoras [Theaetetuts 152 C], that he must have told the truth to his pupils in secret, is purely satirical. Yet Mr. Wolfson ap- parently takes this legend seriously, for we find him repeating it later (I, 54) . 2. That God must not be considered to be jealous is referred to Aristotle [Met. 983 a] and indeed we may defer to Mr. Wolfson when he gives this as the source of a similar thought in the Wisdom of Solomon (I, 25), yet the idea itself, which had such famous results in what Mr. Lovejoy has called the Principle of Plenitude, comes from the Timaeus. It is because of this principle that all possibilities must be realized, according to Plato and his followers, and one of these possibilities would be precisely the acquisition of wisdom, which is in dispute in -the passage cited from Wisdom. On the other hand, Aristotle distinctly says that all possibilities need not be realized and if he had a secret doctrine of "higher things," it is strange that he would also have insisted upon the possibility of all men's acquiring knowledge. 3. Mr. Wolfson considers the Alexander to be a genuine work. If so, it must be the source of Plutarch's Gryllus or of a lost work of which the Gryllus is the descendant. Very little use is made of this piece by Mr. Wolf- son, but if it is genuine, not only is Philo an early source of another impor- tant literary tradition, but also expressed ideas which were hardly congruous with the main body of his beliefs. 4. When Mr. Wolfson sums up his treatment of Philo's use of the alle- gorical method (I, 138), he says, "The example of the Greek allegorical method, of course, helped and encouraged him and served him as a model. But it is conceivable that his allegorical method could have become philo- sophical even without such models." It is indeed conceivable, but the ques- tion is historical and logical. And it must not be forgotten that alongside of the allegorical method in Pagan writers there had also grown up the tech- nique of the Euhemerists who explained away the gods as culture-heroes and hence were forced to interpret many of the popular myths as not literal. Euhemerism is not identical with allegorism, but it is a species of it and it helped create the intellectual climate in which any philosopher of the Alexan- drian schools grew up. Philo loses nothing of his greatness in having had Pagan antecedents. 1 Cf. Shorey, TVhat Plato Said, p. 607 on attributions of a secret doctrine to Plato. Usually secrecy was attributed only to the Pythagoreans. The lpse dixit appears in Diogenes Laertius, VIII, 46, in Hermias [Diels, Doxographers, p. 655, 9], in Julian the Apostate, Or. VII, 239 A, 251 C; Epist. XX, To Theodorus, 452 C; and Epist. XXX, To Philip, 397. These passages refer to Pythagoras and to his disciples. Eunapius, 456 [Boissonade] speaks of "some philosophers" hiding their teachings in obscurity, but does not say that they were secret doctrines. On Aristotle there is a letter from Alexander the Great to his Master asking him to publish his esoteric doctrines, but surely no one would consider that authentic. The whole legend requires elucidation.</page><page sequence="8">392 GEORGE BOAS 5. In one passage (I, 164) Mr. Wolfson argues as if Philo could not have been inconsistent. He brings together two opinions of Philo's which seem to be contradictory and argues that he could have really believed in only one of them. But they occur in different works and surely there is nothing extraordinary in philosophers' saying conflicting things in their various writ- ings. In fact, such conflicts sometimes occur in a single work. 6. Commenting on Philo's view of prophecy, he points out that the prophet is but "the echo of another voice," that "nothing of what he says will be his own" (II, 23). In view of the textual similarity of this and the Platonic Epistles II [314 C] 2 and VII [341 C] and the subsequent claim of Plotinus that he was only the interpreter of the Ancients, it may well be that Philo was merely repeating a commonplace, a commonplace which was espe- cially found in disciples of the Platonistic schools. To which may be added the fact that even the Hermetica were drawn up as expressions of certain gods. There are one or two other similar pedantic criticisms which might be made of this work, such as Mr. Wolf son's treatment of Aristotle on happiness (II, 166) or that of "Nature" (II, 170). But they should not be inter- preted as anything more than the slightest of blemishes. It is impossible to write anything in intellectual history, however large in scope and detailed, without inviting some disagreement. For in a field where conjecture has to play its part, scholars are bound to disagree. It is not likely that even Philo enthusiasts will accept entirely Mr. Wolfson's thesis that medieval philoso- phy began with Philo. And yet from now on they will not only have to con- sider that thesis with great seriousness, but also to give reasons why they do not aceept it. They will have to consider the possibility that the medieval period was not so much a period of time as a new strain of thought which began well before the extinction of Pagan philosophy. The two types of philosophizing will then be seen to overlap, which is plausible, and which will prove much more enlightening as to the true nature of philosophy than the method of periodizing. No one who has read the Gospel according to Saint John could have failed to see the similarities in its ideas to those of Philo. The Greek Fathers abound in what now seem like echoes of Philo- nism. Plotinus has even been thought to have read Philo.3 A strong case has therefore been made for re-estimating the influence of this neglected figure and it ought no longer to be possible to refer to him as anything less than one of those men, like Aristotle or Saint Augustine, through whom old currents of ideas flowed to be redirected. For having made so impressive a case for this thesis, Mr. Wolfson deserves the gratitude of all scholars. It will be interesting to observe to what extent they recognize their debt.
