Trobriand Shields and Their Interpretation 2. A Code with Three Levels 3. The Representation of the Sex Act 4. The Mythology of the Afterlife and the Shield Conclusion Introduction This article sets out to interpret a neglected Trobriand artefact - the decorated war shield - from the Trobrianders' own explanation of its meaning. The shields support the view that the Islanders were not "ignorant of physiological paternity" and independently confirm Edmund Leach's view that there is no contemporary society without a knowledge of the fertilising influence of semen. Leach suggested the prob- lem of knowledge lies with the native beliefs and "...a set of variations around a common structural theme, the metaphysical topography of the relationship between Gods and men" (1967:39). This particular metaphysical topo- graphy has never been identified in the Trobri- and case (nor for the Australian Aborigines). We are in the realm of the symbolic and it is this realm - in relation to the Trobrianders' explanation of their war shield design (Fig. 1) - which will be explored in outline here. Jerry Leach has written: Trobrianders believe in spirits of the dead who reincarnate themselves through their former matrilineal group. The formal belief seems to deny males any role in reproduc- tion, and the Trobrianders convinced Mali- nowski that their religious belief was a true statement of their actual knowledge about sex and copulation. Analysis of the vocabulary of their belief, however, reveals in its structure that males are recognised as part of the reproductive process, at least by some. The public denial of this seems intended for the ears of the spirits who jealously guard their pre-emi- nent role in the formation of new human beings, but it has led the world to believe that the Trobrianders do not associate inter- course with copulation (1976: 2522). Today, Trobrianders relate that in the language and traditional belief system the concept of fatherhood could not be expressed1 (Nisbett 1975/76: 859). On the rare decorated shields is document- ed a particular view of procreation: the facts Patrick Glass, BA in philosophy, history, and geo- graphy at Dublin; Diploma in sodai anthropology at Manchester; MSc by thesis at Salford (see References). He has taught social anthropology in Manchester Universi- ty's Extramural Dept. 1 Though the Trobrianders sometimes revealed to Malinowski what appeared to him a puzzling fuller knowl- edge of the procreative process (1916b: 411), this did not prevent him later taking up a strong stance on their alleged "ignorance of paternity." However, by 1932, this position had become considerably modified and the full difficulty of the matter was readdressed by Malinowski, along with "an evolutionist's recantation," in his special foreword to the third edition of The Sexual Life of Savages. He wrote: "...the Trobrianders do not suffer from a specific com- plaint, an ignorantia paternitatis. What we actually find among them is a complicated attitude towards the facts of maternity and paternity. Into this attitude there enter certain elements of positive knowledge, certain gaps in embryological information. These cognitive ingredients again are overlaid by beliefs of an animistic nature, and influenced by the moral and legal principles of the commu- nity and by the sentimental leanings of the individual" (1932: xxi). This was his considered opinion and he con- cluded: "Incidentally, my account is a methodological challenge for future fieldwork" (ibid.: xxviii). And so it has remained.

It seems to relate to the religion and its contradictions: reincarnation in a unique and closed universe and the ongoing social organisation based on symbolic brother-sister incest (see Moore 1964; Weiner 1979; Glass n.d.b). 1. Trobriand Shields and Their Interpretation Trobriand war shields were made of acacia wood, vayoulo, and were of two types: plain, which were uniformly blackened or whitened, and decorated, which were painted with an elaborately red, white, and black design on a white background.2 Plain shields were carried by ordinary men and the decorated shields by the brave. In the last war reported in the Islands in 1899 only two or three men carried decorated shields and none of these was a chief (Mali- nowski 1920: 11). These elaborately painted ovoid shields were unique to the Trobriands and their outliers. All Trobriand shields have the same characteristic elongated egg shape, narrower at the top than at the bottom, some- times with a slight inward curving at the sides and presenting a bow shape when viewed from the side. Shields differ considerably in size, and the large shields are heavy to handle. The shields were early recognized as a high point of New Guinea art. The Trobrianders' own description of their war shield was taken down in about 1897 by Samuel Benjamin Fellows, the first Methodist missionary to the Trobriands. The native account entitled "Kiriwina Emblazoned Shield" appeared as a single page appendix to the Annual Report on British New Guinea (1897/ 98). 3 Interestingly, Malinowski confirmed the a Kubwana, Venus or the morning star which rises when sikwaikwa birds and lekoleko (fowls) begin to crow. b Kaiuna or three-headed snakes, c Saina or decorative lines, d Sasaona, small fish found in creeks and in shallow waters on the beach, e Siwai, a species of flat fish, f Ubwala or stars of lesser importance visible in the morning hours, g Heads of snakes. h Vikia or frigate birds caught by the snakes, i Haia or rings of shell used in series as earrings, j Sikwaikwa, a bird the size of a starling which gives a sharp short call before sunrise, k Ludakaidoga, the rainbow. 1 Multiplicity of marks representing holes pierced by spears in the shield, m Buli-buli, the tail of the manucodia. Fig. 1: Interpreted Design on a Trobriand Shield' (after Fellows 1897/98) accompanied an exhibition of four Trob- riand decorated war shields in the South Australian Museum, Adelaide, from 1920 or earlier. 2 Whether the plain undecorated shields, kuilumuju, carried by ordinary men were blackened or whitened is unclear. Fellows, who saw the shields in the last skir- mishes, states that all of these shields were uniformly blackened (Seligman 1910: 684). However, in 1951 Lepani Gumagawa (Watson) held that the undecorated shields were painted white all over (Tindale 1959: 50). 3 I am grateful to Graeme Pretty for this reference.

S.B. Fellows got the names and descriptions on the shields all right, barring one or two mistakes, made through his insufficient knowledge of the language. And there is no getting beyond the disconnected agglomer- ate of unrelated motives. No deeper magi- co-religious meaning, absolutely none - and this applies to their art throughout (1918). 4 Malinowski never appears to have changed his opinion in this matter and, oddly, there is no reference to the native shield explanation in his published works. Unaware of the native explanation, Ed- mund Leach (1954) offered his own ingenious interpretation of the shield design which was strongly challenged by Ronald Berndt (1958). That the design represents a flying witch, mulu- kuausi (E. Leach 1954) or "... a male and female engaging in, or about to engage in, coitus" (Berndt 1958: 65) has called for some verification.5 A copy of Fellows's native account (1897/ 98) has accompanied an exhibition of Trobriand shields at Adelaide since 1920, and the native explanation has been validated by Lepani Gumagawa (Watson), the Trobriander, but for one spelling mistake: ludakaidoga should be lubakaidoga,6 rainbow (Fig. 1; Tindale 1959). This is also spelt lupakaidoga (Baldwin 1936- 67). The shield is labelled "Trobriand Island Shield, and an interpretation of its design." Like the majority of decorated shields it is painted red, white, and black on a predomi- nantly white background, and the caption underneath reads: The design on this shield is similar to those exhibited in this case. It has been interpret- ed as having the elements associated with mythology and [the] totemic system of Kiri- wina. According to other interpreters these designs embody highly symbolic representa- tions of male and female genital organs. The design elements are then described (see Fig.l). 2. A Code with Three Levels The Trobrianders' shield description has long been neglected. The question of its meaning or meanings must be considered bearing in mind its collection took place when the shields were still in use. By 1900 the British colonial authori- ties had pacified the Islanders and the shields were no longer used. The native description has been compared with copies of fifty-nine deco- rated shields (Glass 1978). Not surprisingly the mythological and totemic elements do appear to link up with the fact that according to other interpreters these designs embody highly symbolic representa- tions of the human male and female genital organs (Adelaide Trobriand Exhibition Notice [Tindale 1959: 50]). Leach's shield model and lettering (1954) has been juxtaposed with those of the native explanation in offering a new interpretation of the shield design (Fig. 2). The shield designs conform to a pattern and the native explanation indicates the shields possess a unified symbol- ism. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize on the basis of a common symbolism and differen- ces in individual elements can be seen to sup- port the unity of the object or objects symbol- ised. The shield design embodies highly symbol- 4 I am grateful to Michael Young for this reference. 5 Edmund Leach's Trobriand shield interpretation has been reproduced in Jopling (1971) and, in part, in Anderson (1979). Besides Ronald Berndt, there have been other dissenters from Leach's interpretation (e.g., Rey- nolds 1958; Cranstone 1961), and support for it has come from Salisbury (1959), Newton (1975), and Scoditti (1980). 6 The actual shield from which Fellows was able to obtain his indigenous explanation was in the Australian National Gallery, Canberra, awaiting shipment back to Papua New Guinea. Whether the Adelaide shield exhibi- tion model (Fig. 1) - along with the sexual interpretation - came from Fellows himself, is unknown.

While there are parallels with both Leach's (1954) and Berndt's (1958) interpretations, there are also important differences. The manner of the geni- tals' depiction is surprising. The conjunction of the Trobrianders' alleged "ignorance of paterni- ty" with the fact that male and female genitals are observable on the shields led to the expecta- Patrick Glass tion that paternity, in some way, may be implied in the design. And this appears to be the case. The hidden meanings of the design arise from a fusion of the totemic-mythological and biological elements and together these con- stitute a code which can be read on three levels: (1) the native explanation: totemic and myth- ological designs of stars, birds, fish, and so on; (2) an X-ray or anatomical cross-section of human copulation from two distinct angles; and (3) a representation of Topileta, the deity, in Turna, the Trobriand heaven and underworld of the spirits. As key elements in the native explanation relate to stars and this was exclusively men's knowledge, the full meaning of the shield design may have been men's knowledge: Women do not know the names of the moons. It is exclusively men's lore ... the star names are also not known by women (Malinowski 1915: 897). MacGregor relates that the initiated male Laughlan Islanders knew every line and corner of their decorated shield design (1897: 61). The Trobriand shields were the hereditary province of ritual specialists who invested them with protective magic (Malinowski 1922: 406, Plate LVIII). The shield examination will be set out in relation to the native explanation (Fig. 1; level 1 above) and I shall clarify hypotheses 2 and 3 in relation to it, starting with hypothesis 2. 3. The Representation of the Sex Act Malinowski emphasized that the Trobrianders made much use of plays on words: puns, alliter- ation, onomatopoeia, particularly in relation to the language of magic, and spells (Malinowski 1922: 448, 452). Father Baldwin, who tried to document the language of song relating to Turna, found the Trobrianders "... have a secret language that they will never divul- ge" (1945: 202). It is possible to see links be- tween the terms associated with the totemic- mythological elements and human genitalia and Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="5">The Trobriand Code: An Interpretation of Trobriand War Shield Designs 51 these linguistic links help give rise to the impor- tant third hypothesis. Nonetheless, while the linguistic links are important, the interpretation put forward here seems to be valid simply on the aesthetic evidence.7 The individual evidence of the native expla- nation will be examined in turn, starting with the top half of the design (Fig. 1). The collected shields show that the upper half of the design represents, on some shields quite clearly, an ejaculating penis (Figs. 3, 4). The mythological- totemic elements ubwala are described as stars of lesser importance visible in the morning hours (Fig. If). The Trobriand word for testic- les is puwala (Malinowski 1929: 141). The sounds p and b in the language are never inter- changeable (Malinowski 1935/2: 303). Ubwala Pig. 3: Trobriand decorated war shield, British Museum. and puwala constitute a play on words. On some shields the testicles, ubwala, are repre- sented as excluded from the unseen vagina (Finsch 1888: 56; Glass 1978: illustrations 12, 15, 16, 26).8 Fig. 4: Trobriand decorated war shield, National Museum of Victoria, Melbourne. If an ejaculating penis is symbolized then this indicates the penis is inside a vagina and that kubwana, Venus or the morning star, represents the womb (Fig. la). The X-ray nature of the design is upheld by other features. 7 Trobriand vowels are pronounced as in Italian and the consonants as in English (Malinowski 1922: xx). 8 The shield in Finsch (1888) is unlocated; one shield is in the South Australian Museum, Adelaide, and two others are in the British Museum. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="6">52 Patrick Glass While the realism and stylisation of the symbol- ism varies greatly from shield to shield, two shields in particular strongly support the "X- ray" interpretation (Figs. 3, 4). The realism is here vividly displayed. An ejaculating penis is depicted with semen shooting from the penis through a well-demarcated cervix. The cervix conforms for accuracy with a Western scientific diagram of the female reproductive organs (com- pare Figs. 3 and 5). Fïg. 5: Illustration of female reproductive organs from Anthony Barnett ([1950] 1961: p. 52) and A. Stuart Mason (1960: p. 167). Significantly, the Trobrianders were very reticent to Malinowski and Leo Austen about their knowledge of anatomy; indeed to both of them the Islanders' knowledge appeared defi- cient and inaccurate. Malinowski found ... no words to describe the mons veneris as a whole, nor the labia majora or minora .... The internal female organs are called gener- ically bam, and this comprises the uterus and the placenta. There is no special word for the ovaries (1929: 141). Austen relates that he heard an old woman use the taboo word for the cervix, kaipita, but it was considered extremely rude to articulate it (1934: 103-104). Some anatomical knowledge was clearly taboo and restricted and some of this coded on the shields. The planet Venus, kubwana, with its green glow, is recognized as the symbol of fertility in a number of cultures. Kubwana makes its appear- ance at the ioba, the rite of the return of the spirits to Turna (Malinowski 19165: 380). If kubwana represents the womb, then kaiuna, the element representing three-headed snakes in the native account, is related to the womb, for the two elements join on the design (Fig. la and b). On some scientific diagrams of female re- productive organs the Fallopian tubes are in fact depicted as "three-headed" where the tubes meet the ovaries (Fig. 5). However, it appears the ovaries themselves are not depicted on the shield design. This detailed anatomical knowl- edge can be explained as coming from the Trobrianders' customary practice of cutting up the dead (Malinowski 1929: 31). And the artis- tic focus, as with other X-ray styles (for exam- ple that of the nearby New Irelanders), is on what is of significance to the people themselves within the body (Adam 1949: 38-39). The most variable elements in the shield design are those which occur between the womb and the penis and within the penis. The fish, sasaona and siwai, are rarely represented within the penises on the collected shields. Only two of the fifty-nine shields include identifiable fish in the manner of the native interpreted shield (Figs. Id and e, 8), though some shields have fish-like elements and these include the shield in Argonauts (1922: Plate LVIII; Fig. 6). On the native interpreted shield the fish, siwai and sasaona, have a strongly anthropomorphic ap- pearance. They look like grinning and limb- less gingerbread men (Fig. Id and e). A number of shields have a clearly decipherable Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="7">The Trobriand Code: An Interpretation of Trobriand War Shield Designs 53 face in place of the fish and on one shield there is what looks like a human embryo (Fig. 7). These designs all suggest real embryos or babies.

This shield is illustrated in Malinowski (1922: Plate LVIII). Spiky lines occur consistently on the penis depicted in the shield design (Figs. 1 and 8). These lines, very clear on some shields though not on others, appear to represent vibration marks like those found in Western graphics to illustrate rapid movement. Thirty-seven of the fifty-nine shields studied have spiky lines on the symbolized penis. The spiky lines appear to represent vibration between the penis and the Fig. 7: Trobriand decorated war shield, Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Cambridge. This shield was interpreted by Edmund Leach (1954). vagina in the act of intercourse; the "hammer- ing," kuli, the Trobrianders related to coitus (Austen 1934: 103). Kuli in fact means to coagulate. Of Trobriand "coagulating," kuli, Malinowski wrote: When you enquire again why it is that people resemble their father, who is a stranger [tomakava] and has nothing to do with the formation of their body, they have a stereotyped answer to give, for there exists a stereotyped doctrine on the subject. "It coagulates the face of the child; for always he lies with her, they sit togeth- er" (1929: 176). Malinowski accepted the Trobrianders' appar- ently non-sexual explanation of the meaning of "coagulate," kuli. But "lying" and "sitting" are both Trobriand euphemisms for copulation (ibid.: 283-284). The subject - the "it" - that Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="8">54 Patrick Glass Fïg. 8: Trobriand decorated war shield, Museum für Völkerkunde, West Berlin (photo: W. Schneider-Schulz). does the coagulating when the husband and wife "sit" and "lie" together is left unexplained. The shield design suggests the "it" is the penis. The Trobrianders were insistent that a child always looks facially like its father. The mystery has been: how could this be, given the father's explicitly non-physical role in their doctrine of procreation? Semen, anthropomorphic fish and faces, em- bryos, and other shapes all appear within the penis design on the shields. These symbolize a common message and this concerns the male role in procreation. Why fish? In Trobriand thought the conception of children is closely linked with water, bathing, and fish. Women believe if they bathe in the sea they are in danger of conceiving, of being entered by a spirit child, baloma or waiwaia. Sea water is placed by a woman's bed by her brother so that she may be entered by a spirit child while she sleeps. The usual way for a woman to announce she is pregnant is to say to her companions while bathing: "...'A fish has bitten me.' In fact, it was a waiwaia entering or being inserted into her" (Malinowski 1916b: 404). Edwin Hut- chins has recently pointed out that the Trobri- and words for "bathe" and "coitus" are almost homonyms, only distinguishable by context (Spiro 1982: 121). The siwai, the flat fish of the native shield account, sounds like waiwaia, spirit child. The sasaona, found in shallow waters and creeks is also a fish bathing women encountered (Fig. le and d). Sasaona fish ap- pear on two places on the shield: between the phallus and womb and also in groups of up to four each side of the upper part of the shield design. To these latter fish we shall return below. Humans and fish are also closely related in the ritual surrounding marriage. The one gift a man must make to his wife's father, after he has taken up residence with his wife, is a fish. The saykwala is exceptional in the series of marriage gifts in being exclusively of fish (Robinson 1962: 129). Significantly, the gift is made after the man has been living with his wife for some time. The fish is ritually laid in front of the girl's parent's house with the words: "Kam saykwala (thy saykwala gift)"(Malinowski 1929: 78). It seems the fish here covertly confirms male fertility against the matrilineal dogma of "no paternity" which symbolically makes husbands procreatively sterile. In short, the saykwala fish symbolizes the fruit of the marriage - a child - the joint fertility. Turning to the lower half of the shield design, we expect to see some connection be- tween the terms for totemic-mythological ele- ments and female genitalia in this part of the design. Lubakaidoga (misspelt ludakaidoga), the rainbow of the native account has a distinct- ly labial look to it (Fig. Ik). The labia change colour rapidly and in shape and colour are akin to a rainbow.9 The Trobriand generic term for 9 Among the Tukano Indians of South America the rainbow is the "cosmic vagina" (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971:79). The rainbow (vagina) also appears as a key element on Trobriand armshells and on canoe prows in combination with puwala, testicles. Their symbolism is also open to reinterpretation (Scoditti 1980: 80 ff.; Camp- bell 1983: 232). Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="9">The Trobriand Code: An Interpretation of Trobriand War Shield Designs 55 the female genitals is "the scarlet" and the labia are painted on the shields to this description (Malinowski 1935/1: 203). The design element buli-buli, the tail of the bird of paradise, can be seen to represent the clitoris (Figs, lm, 2m and G). Trobrianders re- garded the clitoris, kasesa, as an especially funny and attractive detail of female anatomy (Malinowski 1929: 337); it would be natural to liken it to a bird of paradise. The female genitals are inverted and bulibuli or bunibuni means "to walk stooping or [with] backside humped; careless in mien" (Baldwin 1936-67). Further evidence of the inversion of the female genitals - as if viewed from behind - lies with the depiction of the pubic hair. Trobrianders kept their pubic hair obsessively shaven (Mali- nowski 1929:253, 407). Spiky pubic hair is evident at the top of the vulva, near the clitoris, on some shield designs (Figs. 7 and 8). Yet, the vulva's depiction may be a front view - approp- riate to the normal 'legs up' sexual position. The female genitals' depiction below the phallus would seem to imply male sexual activity over female sexual passivity. Trobrianders rarely painted their bodies, unlike their faces, and tattoo markings were not visible on them. The notable exception to this was the custom of tattooing girls' vaginas at puberty. The tattooing is called ki'uki'u (ibid.: 257). On the stylized female genitals of the shield design there are colourful patterns indicative of tattoos. These markings are called vikia, haia, and sikwaikwa (Fig. lh, i, j). Haia and sikwaikwa are puns on waiwaia, spirit children. Vikia, frigate birds caught by snakes, may be the code for ki'uki'u, the obligatory vaginal tattoo. For Trobrianders, the snake symbolized the penis. The great penis of the legendary sexual hero, Inuvayla'u, was likened to a long snake (ibid.: 348 f.). And the vaginal tattoo, vikia, would naturally attract snakes (penises). To summarize: the top half of the shield design correlates with the bottom half. The spiky lines, or vibration marks, over the stylized vulva - distinguishable from the pubic hair - together with the swollen scarlet labia indicate that copulation is depicted in the bottom half of the design as in the top. It appears that copula- tion is being depicted from two distinct angles. The top half represents an internal and X-ray view at the point of ejaculation with the empha- sis on the penis and female internal reproduc- tive organs (cervix, womb, and Fallopian tubes); the bottom half represents an external view of the inverted vulva, also in copulation, with the penis unseen or X-rayed out. 4. The Mythology of the Afterlife and the Shield If the above interpretation is correct it does pose the question: why the Trobriand need for an ingenious X-ray design? Had it any deeper meaning? After all, the X-ray style does high- light what would otherwise be invisible - and what was strongly negated in the traditional society - namely, paternity. The deeper meaning of the shield design appears to relate to the religion and the mythology of the after- life. Many cultures make the comparison be- tween the cowrie shell and the vulva, and many types of shell come under the rubric conchae veneris, including the giant clam of Botticelli's Birth of Venus. A cowrie or clam shell is decipherable in the lower half of the design on the shields and it encompasses the stylized female genitals. Now the chief source of large cowrie shells for the Trobrianders was Turna, their small, most northerly, island, the land of the spirits. On Tuma ... the large white cowrie shells (Ovulum ovum) are very plentiful; in fact, this small island is the main source of these important articles of decoration for the northern and eastern villages of Kiriwina (Malinowski 1916b: 363). Significantly, the term for the cowrie shell, ovulum ovum, is the same as that for the rainbow, lupakaidoga (also spelt lubakaidoga) (Malinowski 1916a: 1975; Baldwin 1936-67). Every Trobriand child is reincarnated and comes "into existence (ibubuli) in Tuma" (Ma- linowski 1929: 146). So the term for life, "to come into existence," ibubuli, is a pun on another term for the clitoris, the clitoris of the Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="10">56 Patrick Glass shield design, bulibuli (Figs. Im; 2G, m). The clitoris is placed at the lower end of the symbol- ic cowrie shell for the whole signifies Tuma: sex in the underworld, the paradise of reincar- nation of the spirits. On the shield designs the shell, Tuma, is marked with spiky lines, like those around the phallus, the vibrations of intercourse. Forty-four out of fifty-nine shields studied have these lines on the stylized female genitals. And, appropriately, every time a spirit enters Tuma "the earth trembles" (Malinowski 19165: 359). A shell and the vulva appear to have been synonymous with Tuma, the island of large shells. While the women's view may have been rather different (Stocking 1977), according to Trobriand men the afterlife was an endless sexual orgy among the Tuma beauties, who greatly outnumbered men: . . . the home of the spirits in Tuma remains a paradise, and above all an erotic paradise. When a native talks about it, when he grows eloquent ... all other aspects soon fade into the background and sex comes to the fore ... In their anticipations, Tuma is thronged with beautiful women, all ready to work hard by day and dance by night. The spirits enjoy a perpetual scented bacchanal (Malinowski 1929: 361 f.). Sex always comes to the fore in any discussion of Tuma. The idea of death would not have been far from the thoughts of the warriors who carried the decorated shields. For they were the main focus of the enemies' spears. Death would have meant an early confrontation with Topileta, the gatekeeper of Tuma. If Tuma, a cowrie shell, is symbolized on the shield, it is logical to look for Topileta there as well. Malinowski found that Trobriand men used very guarded language about Topileta10 (ibid.: 410). How might the warriors have recognized him? What did he look like and what was his character? Seligman, who had visited the Trobriands in 1904, reported that Topileta possesses large ears which flap continually, has an insatiable sexual appetite, is covered in tattoo, dwells in and is the master of Tuma, but otherwise is exactly like mortal man, though much larger (1910:733; Malinowski 1929:361-363). The penis of mortal Trobriand man also dwells in Tuma, the vulva, the land of the cowrie shell. So Topileta is the code name for the phallus - much larger on the shield than ordinary Trobri- and man's - which has taken possession and control of the female reproductive organs, womb and Fallopian tubes, "the ears of the spirits" (Fig. 9). To explain: Topileta is covered in tattoo because he is in congress with the vulva, Tuma, which is tattooed. His large ears flap continually because the warrior who carries Topileta's image moves the shield rapidly up and down to defend his whole body from the onslaught of spears (Malinowski 1920: 11). "The ears of the spirits," who jealously guard their pre-eminent role in the formation of new human beings, refers to a female dimension of Topileta, the Fallopian tubes (J. Leach 1976: 2522; Figs. 2b, C; 9). The spirit, Topileta, is therefore androgynous - of male and female sexual character - but primarily he is male. It appears that he has taken possession of the necessary female organs to assert his - the male - mastery over the spirit world, Tuma, which is an overtly female domain. This covert mastery emphatically negates the official matrilineal dogma of "no paternity." Significantly, Susan Montague has recently reported: God is ... anomalous to traditional Kadu- wagan [Trobriand] cosmology in one signifi- cant respect. He is a masculine, paternalis- tic innerworld Being, and this innerworld is the world of women and ties through women (1978: 96). God is a spirit who always resides inside a bwala, a house, an area dominated by women. But it is a sign of his power that he is present there and the words relating to him and the bwala are the words of meguva [magical spells] and sex, however "...the words ... can never be given outer reality without intruding death into life" (ibid.: 96). The innerworld being is an apt 10 Malinowski's aggressive fieldwork style can be seen to have pressed his informants to "the metaphysical wall" and inhibited the possible flow of information in the vital matter of beliefs (Stocking 1977: 5).

The "holes" or "houses," bwala, of emergence of the first couples who founded the local lineages, dala - "a sister as the head of the family and the brother as her guardian" - are often marked by grottoes, springs, and heads of creeks (Malinowski 1926: 36). Ill l^y^i ill (8atekeePer of ¡m '//(^ÊIÊiïï íM Fïg. 9: A further interpretation of designs on the Trobri- and shields: the Trobriand code. The Trobrianders had no kinship term to express the physical relationship between a father and his child; there was no term to express agnation or consanguinity (Malinowski 1916b: 407-410). There is only the generic term for kinship, veiola or veyola, and this means kinship in the maternal line. But there is consi- derable ambiguity in this term: in fact, patrilin- eal as well as matrilineal kin may be veyola, for the term denotes kin of origin (Weiner 1976: 53-55). This may be seen as a pointer to explain the terms used for the decorated shields where origins are depicted: vai ova (Haddon 1894), vaiaúlo/vayoulo/va'yaulo11 (Malinowski 1915, 1918, 1919), vayoula/vayola (Baldwin 1936-67). These terms may be seen as a pun on veiola/veyola, the generic term for kinship. For the ovoid shield makes the inexpressible kinship relationship - fatherhood - and the joint fertili- ty explicit. Interestingly, Malinowski relates in his field notes that: "the child is often addressed by the father as 'my egg' " (1915: 1167). And the largest male egg in Trobriand society - the war shield - expresses the relationship graphically. On one level, fatherhood is banished to the supernatural realm and is locked into the pro- cess of reincarnation in the spirit world of Turna. Topileta is both God, the Ancestor Spirit, the master of the spirit world; but he is also - for those who can recognize him - a part of every man and woman. He is the spirit who sent forth everything there is in the upper world, the Trobriands: people, animals, food, magic, and so on, but he stayed behind to determine who is to enter and leave Turna - who is to be and not to be (Seligman 1910: 679, 733). He is the ruler of the underworld, the chthonic god or spirit. Topileta is symbolized in the upper half of the war shield design and Turna, a cowrie shell, is depicted in the lower (Fig. 9). If the symbolism of the war shield design is to be taken seriously, and here, as in all matters of symbolism, we have no alternative, then the design suggests a quantum leap for our under- standing of the traditional society. Turna, the world below, is said to be a mirror of the world above, Boyowa (Malinowski 1926: 36). On the shield design Turna is drawn to equal Topileta in length (Fig. 9). If a cowrie represents an island, Turna, then the other reproductive organs depicted on the shield design may also symbolize islands (Boyowa or Kiriwina). There are, in fact, symbolic transformations of Topile- ta and Tuma on the main Island, Boyowa, which support geographical sexual polarities which appear to have orientated the traditional social order (Glass n.d. a and b). While it is beyond the brief of this article to go into these transformations, they must be noted before discussing the symbolic parallels between the shield design and those of the principal rite of the Islanders, the milamala. But, first, to return to the war shield 11 While Malinowski never refers to the decorated shield by any native term in his published writings, elsewhere he refers to them as vaiatilo (1915: 912), vayou- lo (June 1918), and va'yaulo (December 1919). For the last reference see note to Figure 6. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="12">58 design. The symbol of Turna, an island, and sasaona fish, either side of Topileta, suggest that water or the sea may be symbolized (Figs. Id; 2d and D). On the shields sasaona usually number from two to four either side of the representation of Topileta. The fish may be there for aesthetic reasons to produce a balance in the overall design. But the question must be asked: why fish - which are also inside the phallus - here? The fish are also surrounded by exceptional B E shapes. These are said to be "holes pierced by spears" (Fig. 11). Fifty-one out of fifty-nine shields studied have either B or E shapes as the predominant shapes repres- enting this element. These straight lines are unique in Trobriand art. And the shapes indivi- dually and collectively, in combination with the manifest tension of Topileta in Turna, may relate to the Trobriand aesthetic ideal of "even- ness or balance" along with "tension in the clear pure line" (Beier 1975; 1976: 10 f.). Here, perhaps, we come to the heart of Trobriand culture, for water is paramount in their symbol- ism. The whole reincarnation process takes place by, through, and in water. Indeed, the very word for magic, sope, also means water. The Trobriand artist of genius, of whom there is only one in each generation who follows his calling from birth, is said to have sope, magic/ water. He always listens to the sea (Kasaipwalo- va 1975: 5; Narubutal 1975: 1). While there is no way of proving that water or the sea is being depicted on shields, Tuma and the sasaona fish hint at its presence. In addition, there are two particular puzzles about the phallus's representation on the shields which further support the suggestion. Only the phallus, and never the womb, kubwana, or vulva, Tuma, has the unique B E shapes in it. Also the majority of shields studied, thirty-one out of fifty-nine, have the phallus depicted as open at the top, at glans penis (Figs. 6 and 8). So the open-ended phallus and the B E shapes link up a common symbol: the sasaona fish. Sasaona, a fish which bathing women would encounter in the sea, are depicted both in the penis and either side of it. Together they strongly suggest a connection between the sea, fish, and the phallus. Bathing women, about to become pregnant, would descend the momola, Patrick Glass the eastern seashore; but momola also means semen (Malinowski 1935/1: 235; 1929: 142). On the design there is a convergence suggestive of a link-up between geography and anatomy through the mediation of a transcendent sym- bol, the fish. The fish is both on the seashore, momola, and in place of the semen, momola, on the phallus. sea + BE shapes + sasaona = sasaona + B E shapes + phallus sea + momola + sasaona = conception = sasaona + momola + phallus What is overtly negated on land (male fertility) takes place for the Trobrianders on the seashore, momola (semen: momolá), through water, sope, and fish, sasaona (which is linked to the phallus) by magic, sope. But conception is depicted on the war shields as tied to the phallus through fish and, by implication, to water and the seashore as well. So to the contradiction which is at the centre of the system of belief. Trobriand mytho- logy relates the source of love magic to an act of brother-sister incest in the water on the beach, momola, at Kumilabwaga in the south of Boyo- wa. If magic is performed there the favourable augury is that "... two small fish will be seen playing together in the shallow water on the beach" (Malinowski 1927: 129). When people come to the beach and later dream of fish swimming "nose to nose" they prepare for a fruitful marriage (Malinowski 1929: 458). Inter- estingly, the siwai- sasaona fish of the shield design also swim nose to nose (Fig. 8). At Kumilabwaga, the source of love magic, the impossible - from the Trobriand view - happen- ed: the mythological act of brother-sister in- cest led to procreation. This fact is further celebrated in the myth of the cultural hero, Tudava, who covertly married his own sister and flourished. He is the Trobriand cause for celebration (Glass 1978; n.d. b). The main religious rite of the Trobrianders is the milamala, the annual harvest festival, and visitation of the spirits, baloma. The milamala started with the consecration of the drums; the large drum is nicknamed kupi, which means "the penis" (Malinowski 1916b: 372, 380). Kupi drums orchestrated all the activity. The milama- la ended with ioba, the return of the spirits to Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="13">The Trobriand Code: An Interpretation of Trobriand War Shield Designs 59 Turna, which was associated with a distinct heightening of sexual activity. The baloma returned after a two-to-four-week stay to Turna: This return is compulsory, and is induced by the ioba ... the second night after the full moon, about one hour before sunrise, when the leatherhead (saka'u) sings out, and the morning star (kubuana) appears in the heavens, the dancing which has been going on the whole night, ceases, and the drums intone a peculiar beat, that of the ioba. The spirits know the beat, and they prepare for their return journey (ibid.: 380). There is a remarkable coincidence between the symbolism of the ioba, recorded by Mali- nowski, and the symbolism of the war shield design (Fig. 1). Both imply a common meaning, namely, procreation. When the spirits compul- sorily return to Tuma, it is early morning and kubwana, Venus or the morning star, rises and the sikwaikwa begin to sing. The departure of the spirits to Tuma is scored by the kupi (penis) drum beat. Ioba is a rite of percussion and transition on several levels (Needham 1967). When the spirits of the dead depart the Islands for Tuma, the underworld, other spirits (of the living or about to be conceived) are arriving in Tuma (vulvas) all over the Islands. The spirits are all superintended by Topileta, the deity and gatekeeper of heaven (Fig. 9). And, it appears, for a short time, Topileta (sexual intercourse: the Trobriands) symbolically equals Tuma. The proof that the Islands become coital and fertile at ioba lies with Bellamy's statistical finding on the timing of Trobriand births shortly before Malinowski arrived. His study surpris- ingly revealed that the majority of births occur- red in May which meant that most Trobriand conceptions took place during the ioba and its aftermath. And Bellamy speculated whether this was not the Trobriand "breeding season" (Black 1957:237). Yet, custom dictates this activity since: "Everybody had to be bound on ... sexual license, in order to please the baio- ma" (Malinowski 19165: 380). At ioba, Kiriwi- na, the Trobriands, becomes the "transforming or generating female"; which is what "Kiriwi- na" means (J. Leach 1983: 126-127, 130). It seems at least part of the symbolism of the war shield design and ioba are the same.12 Conclusion The one extraordinary fact about the Trobrian- ders was their overt denial of an understanding of the fertilising influence of semen. The whole process of introducing new life into the commu- nity lay simply between the spirit world and the female organism. As Malinowski related: "There is no room for any sort of physical paternity" (1929: 153). But, it appears, the war shield design and its symbolism along with Trobriand behaviour and beliefs tell another story. Where there is cultural suppression of crucial knowledge, it is logical, after all, to expect that knowledge to find other expression, possibly at the level of belief. Malinowski noted: "Sex ... pervades art and it produces its spells and its magic. It dominates in fact almost every aspect of the culture" (ibid.: xix).13 And the conclusions of this article are consistent with Malinowski's contention. The elaborate war shield design, the native explanation of which was taken down by Fel- lows in about 1897 (Fig. 1) and its correctness confirmed by both Malinowski and Lepani Gumagawa (Watson), appeared to be a series of disparate elements representing natural objects set in no particular relation to each other. Yet taken in conjunction with the fact that other interpreters, notably Berndt (1959), said that male and female genitalia are clearly decipherable on some shields led to the expec- 12 See particularly Frederick Damon's reassessment of the Trobriand and Woodlark Islanders' calendrical rites (1982). 13 However, later in the same work he wrote: "In the Trobriands, representations of sexual matters are com- pletely absent from decorative art and from dancing" (ibid.: 335). Whether or not the sexual element in the war shield design was noted by Malinowski remains, for the present, an intriguing mystery. He noted in his intimate diary, somewhat dismissively it seems, that he found the Tuma language given him by an informant "very guttural" ([1917] 1967: 154). Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="14">60 Patrick Glass tation that paternity - in some way - is being expressed in the design. The knowledge which ninety-nine per cent of contemporary societies take for granted was strongly tabooed in tradi- tional Trobriand society, and, it seems, only transmitted by secret means. For one group, the warriors, the tabooed knowledge was contained in their shield design.14 The native explanation of the design implies the very central impor- tance of the sex act - and the generative function of intercourse - to the mythology and cosmology of the belief system. The Trobrian- ders were very guarded about articulating their knowledge of paternity for fear of offending "the ears of the spirits" - the female dimension of the Spirit, Topileta - who apparently jealous- ly guarded their pre-eminent role in the forma- tion of human beings (Fig. 9). These beliefs were also in accord with the strong matrilineal dogma. But the Spirit, it would appear, is primarily male and then androgynous. What I have attempted to show is that the native shield design was coded and the code may be interpreted on three levels. Each level relates in a different way to the secret male role in Trobriand procreation and reincarnation. First, the native explanation relates to stars, birds, fish, and so on, and is allied to totems and mythology (Fig. 1). Secondly, the shield design represents two views of human copula- tion, which appear to be complementary, and relate to the penis carrying out its procreative role. The top half of the design represents an X-ray style drawing of the penis ejaculating inside an unseen vagina with the cervix, womb, and Fallopian tubes depicted and the whole viewed from the front. The bottom half repre- sents a view of the external female genitals in copulation in a submissive posture, as seen from behind, with the penis unseen or X-rayed out (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). Finally, and importantly, the shield design depicts the belief system, the Trobriand code, which constitutes a form of fertility cult of reincarnation. The top half of the design repre- sents the deity, Topileta, the gatekeeper of Turna. Turna, the underworld of the spirits of the dead, is symbolized in the bottom half of the design by a large cowrie shell (Fig. 9). Topileta is the Spirit who determines who is to exist or be reincarnated in the upper world, Boyowa or Kiriwina. There is much more to be written on the war shield design: on, for example, the colour- ing which has been neglected here - most of the key features combine red, white, and black elements (see Tambiah 1968; Beier 1975; Munn 1977), and the shield's position within Trobri- and art and viewed comparatively. But these topics take second place to demonstrating a finding which suggests a radical cultural reinter- pretation. The traditional Trobriand inability to articulate paternity - their so-called "igno- rance" - appears to have involved a denial of paternity because it is a secret dimension of the supernatural and has eternal power. And this finds expression in many symbolic transforma- tions. It must be noted that the loss of eternal life on Boyowa was through female error and fe- male sexuality, for the traditional Trobrianders, tied to uncontrollable human disorder - death to all men - on the Island of Kaytalugi which means "the fill of copulation" (Malinowski 1926: 6O-62; 1929: 356 ff.). For the Islanders, it is the male spark which started everything and keeps it all going. And the word for first cause, base, origin, or source of strength, u'ula, may be seen as a play on Topileta's Ubwala (Fig. If.; Malinowski 1929: 143). This is another example of the phenomenon of the unacknowledged male principle, by inversion, becoming the fount of human and natural activity (Bloch and Parry 1982: 18 ff.). Topileta is tied to the stars, the seasons, transcendent creatures, the Islands, and coitus. He represented the meta- physical topography of the relationship between God or the Ancestor Spirit, men and women 14 This concurs with Powell's 1950 finding of two sets of beliefs concerning paternity both "true," but "differ- ent"; namely, "men's talk" which is true in formal situations and relates to the matrilineal ideology and may appear to defer to the "ears" of the spirits, and "women's and children's talk" which expressed an explicit knowledge of the male role (1956: 277-278; E. Leach 1967: 48). Powell also found that the male is the Trobriand origina- tive mode: "Women are ... the transmissive, not the originative, mode of communication" (ibid.: 267). Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="15">The Trobriand Code: An Interpretation of Trobriand War Shield Designs 61 (E. Leach 1967). Phallic or sexual mediator gods - "the gatekeepers of heaven" - are common to many cultures from Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome to India and Papua New Guinea. They are the guardians of the sacred place, the mediators - often by sexual means - between this world and the next. Topileta may be classified as a kind of phallic trickster Spirit or God: part fraud, part isolated phallus which has usurped the female reproductive organs (E. Leach 1961: 130; 1983). He has a hidden, invi- sible ("X-ray") presence, as Susan Montague found: he is potentially everywhere and no- where in the Trobriands, the working ghost of the belief machine, Deus in machina, manufac- turing spirits in Turna. The short answer to Melford Spiro's ques- tion - if the Trobrianders understood paterni- ty, why could they not express it? (1968: 260) - appears to be that paternity involved beliefs which had to be coded and symbolic for the beliefs are inexpressible in everyday intelligible language. However, why they should place their religious beliefs in coded form on their war shields is another question and is explored elsewhere (Glass n.d. a).

Abstract. - Tin's article offers an interpretation of the Trobrianders9 own explanation of their war shield design which was taken down by Reverend S.B. Fellows in about 1897. The design is coded and suggests an interpre- tation on three levels: the native rendering relating to stars, fìsti, birds, and so on; an X-ray view of human copulation from two angles; and a representation of Topileta, the deity, in Turna, the underworld of the spirits and reincarnation. Evidence is given to support each level of the code which has radical implications for the under- standing of traditional Trobriand society. The shield design suggests that Trobriand religion constituted a ferti- lity cult. [Melanesia, Trobriand Islands, war shield design] References Cited Adam, Leonhard 1949 Primitive Art.
