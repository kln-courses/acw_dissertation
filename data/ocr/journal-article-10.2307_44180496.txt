<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milena Mileva BLAŽÍC The city as a motif in Slovene youth literature 1. The city as motif in Slovene youth literature from 1850-1900 Realistic narrative is a type of narrative prose where reali- stic or experiential narrative elements prevail (literary hero, time, space and events). Fantastic narrative is a type of nar- rative prose where imaginary or invented narrative elements prevail (literary hero, time, space and events). To pupils in primary schools we differentiate the experiential from the imaginary city by explaining that the experiential or real city can be found on a map, while the imaginary city exists only on an imaginary or invented map. Exceptional examples of imaginary space found in world youth literature are for example A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh and The house on Poo's corner (the map is on the inside cover) or J. R. R. Tol- kein's Lord of the rings (detailed map). In the early or first period of Slovene youth literature, ran- ging from 1850-1900, above all in Levstik's Children's play in rimes (1880, orig. Otročje igre v pesencah), the scene of events is tied to rural, village environment, pastures and paths to schools or the church. In Martin Krpan from Vrh (orig. Martin Krpan z Vrhá), Levstik reflects about the road along which Krpan transported (smuggled) salt and the city of Vienna: »On coming to Vienna, the city was donned in black; people aimlessly shuffled along, like ants whose ant- hill is on fire.« Levstik also mentions Trieste, however he sees the city as the antipode of village, courage and com- mon sense. Because of the nature of work and life in the second half of the nineteenth century, Stritar still keeps the scene of events tied to rural places while events follow life in the rural environment, whereby the child is seen by so- ciety as a diminished adult. In the poem titled Ljubljana he does however write »The Lord greets (heals) you, white city!« l1l and in another he nostalgically mentions Bled. 2. The city as motif in Slovene youth literature from 1900-1950 The city as motif in Slovene youth literature becomes appa- rent at the beginning of the 20th century. Oton Župančič in his books Bubbles, Easter eggs, Onehundred riddles (orig. Me- hurčki, Pisanice, Sto ugankj still sticks to the rural, village en- vironment, which is nevertheless idyllic. From Levstik and Stri- tar we can gather that the child is auxiliary work force, helping in pasture, picking fruit and vegetables, going to church and school, »working and praying«. Župančič brought about a sig- nificant shift, the child, although living in a rural environment, begins to play, becomes naughty, has the right to be a child and is given characteristics of childhood, e.g. playfulness, spontaneity, naughtiness etc. Župančič also mentions an ima- ginary land, which is based on the vernacular lore, as a land of plenty where life is good, i.e. India Coromandia. We can observe an interesting motif-thematic shift in the book by Milčinski, Birds without nests (orig. Ptički brez gnezda, 1917). The introduction to the motif is the gradual 97</page><page sequence="2">CŁJED URBANI IZZIV vol. 14, No. 2/03 migration of families from rural and suburban to urban envi- ronments coupled with all the pertaining thematic changes in the field of youth literature. With Milčinski realistic youth narrative begins to focus on social problems and issues and continues during times of social realism with France Bevk: (Little Luka and his bird (starling), Shepherds (1931), Pe- strna (1935) and The little thief (1951)(or/gf. Luka in njegov škorec, Pastirci , Pestrna, and Tatič), Tone Seliškar (The brotherhood of the blue seagull (1936, orig. Bratovščina Si - njega galeba) and Prežihov Voranc (Solzice, 1949 (orig. Tearddrops). An interesting image of city in which a child gets lost is presented by Bevk in the story Luka and his bird (starling) (1931). The motif of a coastal city is also intere- sting when shown by Seliškar in The brotherhood of the blue seagull (1936). Both the mentioned stories were writ- ten during the time of so called social realism, i.e. between the two world wars and the motif of city as shown in the Brotherhood ... is also the space of adventures of a group of young people. With Kosovel the understanding of child is idealised, the child lives in idyllic timelessness and cares about a »sunf- lower« so that »it wouldn't break«. Although in Kosovel's poetry for the adult reader the motif of city is emphasised, expressionists, he didn't use it in poetry for children. The motif of city in imaginary, fantastic narrative, which is distinguished from story telling and vernacular, author's or modern stories, entered Slovene youth literature much la- ter. Even in imaginary narrative the motif of city was prima- rily given to villages, rural environments, suburbs and later also the city. The first fantastic narrative, positioned in the time of social realism, when time, space and the rural envi- ronment are fantasised, are stories by Josip Ribičič (Little mouse (1931, orig. Miškoiin) and Nana, the little monkey (1937, orig. Nana, mala opica), where personified animals are the stars. In Miškoiin the scene of events are the villa- ge, rural environment, school, while in Nana, mala opica, the scene extends to the city and circus. 3. The city as motif in Slovenian youth literature from 1950-1990 After the Second World War realistic narrative blossomed, because of the post-war time but also indirectly shifts in the social arena, industrialisation, when families migrated from the countryside to urban environments, especially after 1950 and again after 1960. Popular realistic narratives with urban themes are the pre-war Brotherhood of the blue gull, by Seliškar (1936) and The secret society PGC, by Ingolle (1958). Ingolič however focuses on the problems of young- sters growing up in urban environments, who are troubled by maturing, family conflicts, school (Gimnazijka, 1958). Growing up as a theme of youth realistic narrative, which was never expressed in rural environments, appears in sto- ries by I. Zorman (At seventeen, Dew Bay (orig. V sedem- najstem , 1972, Rosni zaliv , 1975) and B. Jurca (When strawberries ripen (orig. Ko zorijo jagodę, 1974). The city as a motif became a constant in Slovenian youth literature when it was introduced by a new generation of writers that were mostly brought up in suburbs and cities, e.g. Polonca Kováč (There are never too many Andrews (1977, orig. Andrejev ni nikoli preveo, Ursulas are perfect (1980, orig. Urške so brez napak), Špelce, 1983), and abo- ve all Slávko Pregi with his typical image of a child or »ras- cal« as he called them. Groups of children of the same age play in front of their apartment blocks, their city; they are typical urban children (A manual for vagrancy (1977, orig. Priročnik za klatenje, Genius in short pants (1978, orig. Gé- niji v kratkih hiačah), The battle notes of a city rascal (1982, orig. Bojni zapiski mestnega mulca). The collective hero and outstanding individual are typical for realistic narratives and urban environments, with the time and scene of events be- ing the present and the city. Events that are narrated or described are tied to urbanity (park, school, shop, road lights, trams, Tivoli, the Ljubljana castle, Tromostovje, gara- ges etc.). Use of »slang« as a specific form of language is typical for these children or »rascals«. Special attention should be given to the collection of poems by Niko Grafenauer (Old Ljubljana (1983, orig. Stara Ljub- ljana), illustrated by Kamila Volčanšek), which is based on a real representation of medieval Ljubljana, written by Ja- nez Lombergar and poetic interpretation by Niko Grafena- uer. The collection is an example of harmony between rea- listically, poetically and artistically presented motifs of me- dieval Ljubljana for young readers. It is simultaneously an example of an interesting method for bringing history closer to young readers. The city as motif is also present in modern stories, short stories, extended short stories and fantastic narratives. The benchmark in this genre is the short modern story by Ela Peroci (My umbrella can be a balloon (orig. Moj dežnik je lahko balon), The slipper cat (orig. Muca copatarica)). The city as motif becomes obvious and imaginative after 1950 with Vitomil Zupan (Travelling to a thousand cities (1956, orig. Potovanje v tisočera mesta)), Vid Pečjak (Drejček and the three little Martians (1961, orig. Drejček in trije Mar- sovčki)), Kristina Brenk (The girl Delphina and the curly tai- led fox (1972, orig. Deklica Delfina in lisica Zvitorepka)) and Kajetan Kovič (My pal Piki Jacob (1974, orig. Moj prijatelj Piki Jakob)), Muri the cat, Cat city, Cat fair (orig. Maček Muri, Mačje mesto, Mačji sejem)). An interesting moderni- stic image of city can be found in the collection of short mo- dern stories written by Lojze Kovačič, with an imaginative title (Stories from Ric-Rac town (1962, orig. Zgodbe iz me- sta Rič-Rač). An interesting image is also presented as an illustrated book, Little man between chimneys (1974, orig. Možiček med dimniki)), the artistic work being done by Mi- lan Bizovičar (1974), where two images are presented. The first is a nostalgic understanding of old cities in which an imaginary figure »The little man« lives and helps people, while the second is an image of a new noisy city, in which the little man doesn't feel very comfortable. The literary part is the author's reminiscence about Basel, his birthplace. The scene of Kovačič's short modern stories is often the old part of the city or old Ljubljana, even in his other literary works for adult readers. Compared to prose or poetry, dra- matic literature is not very common in youth literature. Ne- vertheless it does appear in the text by Leopold Suhadol- čan: Up-side-down things in the city of Petpedi (1967. orig. Narobe stvari v mestu Petpedi). Svetlana Makarovič introduced novelties to fantastic prose (Kosovirs on a flying spoon (1974), What's up, kosovirs? (1975), orig. Kosovirja na Ieteci žlici, Kam pa kam, kosovir- ja?)), who simultaneously innovatively developed a form of modern story with the main character being an animal. In most of her texts the actors are personified (characterised) or antropomorphosised (with human functions) animals, 98</page><page sequence="3">The Image of city in popular culture ■■■■■■ vol. 14, No. 2/03 even villages, suburbs and cities as motifs are often used, predominantly expressed by their population's characteri- stics, e.g. The Mo-Mouse's bakery, Sapramiška, Oka the owl (orig. Pekarna Mišmaš, Sapramiška, Sovica Oka). The city as motif from this new perspective is very clear in her short modern story The tramp and the night lamp {orig. Po- tepuh in nočna lučka) or since 1 990 in her newer stories- Shcheper and Mba (orig. Ščeper in Mba). Other authors writing in this genre are: Jože Snoj (Automotive ants (1975, orig. Avtomoto mravlje)), Polonca Kováč (Jack and uncle fridge (1976, orig. Jakec in strie hladilnik, Five puppies search for the right one (1982, orig. Pet kužkov išče prave- ga), Puffy the dog's troubles and messages (1986, orig. Te- ža ve in sporočila psička Pafija). An interesting viewpoint from this so called fantastic world into the real world can be read in the short modern story by Frane Milčinski Ježek, Sleepy little star (1949, orig. Zvezdica Zaspanka) with an unearthly view of our planet, where the beginning is posi- tioned on a fantastic level (the sky), while the central scene is on Earth, in a city, where Zvezdica Zaspanka is sent as punishment for »being late to work«. The story surely has a dual message - for both the young and adult reader. 4. The city as motif in Slovenian youth literature after 1990 In contemporary times, a significant shift can be observed after 1990, writing on cities as motif narrows down to urban parts of cities, e.g. Dim Zupan (The Trnovo mob, 1992; Flying cats, 1997 (orig. Trnovska mafija , Leteči maćki)), Ja- nja Vidmar (Heroes from the fifth grade, 1995; Fatty, 1999; Scoundrel, 2001 (orig. Junaki petega razreda, Debeluška, Baraba)), Bogdan Novak (Nina's two poets, 1995; the collec- tion Loyal friends, after 1995 (orig. Ninina pesnika dva, Zvě- sti prijatelji 1995)), Leopold Suhodolčan with his serialised adventures in urban cities or parts of cities - sports grounds (To be a basketball playe! (1994), To be a cyclist! (1997) (orig. Košarkar naj bo!, Kolesar naj bo!)). During the nineties motifs such as urbanity, alienation, difference, issues and themes with individual literary heroes, begin to prevail. The collective hero from the seventies and eighties disappears. Urbanity and effects of urbanity, such as: alienation and con- temporary problems (separation, alcohol, drugs, sexuality, crime, refugees, death etc.) become the central topic. Individual symbolism of fantastic places and cities are in the works by Niko Grafenauer (Little one, 1987; Mahajana, 1990 (orig. Majhnica, Mahajana)), Bina Štampe Žmavc (Where did snow dissapear, 1983; King Mina's watches. 1999; Softpawed cat, 1998 (orig. Kam je izginil sneg, Ure kralja Mina, Muc Mehkošapek). In the awarded picture book Softpawed cat, in which the author recommends »to spend one cat of time«, indirect consequences of urbanity, such as: alienation, overemployment, transition, fast tempo of life, changing values and lifestyles, can be discerned. Unsensi- cal elements and thematics of up-side-down world or cities were wittily continued by Milan Dekleva (Totally crazy day, 1992; Bučka on Broadway, 1993 and Onwards to the past, 1997 (orig. Totalka odštekan dan, Bučka na Broadwayu and Naprej v preteklost). He uses the motifs of urban city, fo- reign cities and time machines to take the reader to the past or future. Realistic issues of urban children, e.g. sepa- ration of parents, are a motif - theme in realistic narrative, but also in fantastic narratives by Polonca Kovac (Kaya and her family, 1999 (orig. Kaja in njena družina)). We have to mention that the city as motif doesn't figure only in prose but also poetry, i.e. Niko Grafenauer (Pedenjped: Pe- denjeity, Pedenjempire, Skyscrapers sit down (1978, orig. Pe- denjped: Pedenjmesto, Pedenjcarstvo, Nebotičniki, sedite), Tone Pavček (Beautiful city Notown, 1979 (orig. Čudovito me- sto Nigagrad )), Kajetan Kovič (Muri the cat, 1975; Cat fair, 1991 (orig. Maček Muri, Mačji sejem)). The commercially most successful short modern story in picture book form is Muri the cat, also available as an interactive picture book on CD-ROM. All events take place in Cat city, at the cat fair, the cat races etc. It is typically human but all the literary figures are anthropomorphic animals. The city as motif was also emphasised by illustrator Jelka Reichman on the interactive CD_ROM Maša Kozjek, where we can recognise motifs from the city of Ljubljana (Nebotičnik '2' Town hall etc.). After 1990 the influence of contemporary development ideas in global youth literature and interdisciplinary fields, i.e. ecology, presented in modern stories, picture books, as well as in realistic narrative, becomes stronger. The scene is transferred to the individual's person, whereby the hero has to overcome internal tensions, boredom, problems, ill- ness, loneliness etc., when socially vulnerable. Even on the level of language, authors of youth literature usually use the term »city« in the literal sense (beautiful Ljubljana, business district etc.) and with expressive signifi- cance (the whole city is buzzing about ...; eternal city (pla- ce); in the last round I managed to advance to first place; recognise the place, which somebody should assume; the lad has his mind in the right place; to know how to put so- mething in its place etc.). PI 5. Conclusion The motif of city in Slovenian youth literature became a constant after 1950, when social changes and migration from the countryside to cities accelerated the development of realistic narrative and inherent thematic issues. In the 70s and 80s an obvious shift can also be seen in the field of motifs, themes, when most Slovenian families were al- ready living in cities. Urbanity and pertaining effects, above all side effects, in the sense of development of issue orien- ted youth literature, have been emphasised since 1990. Ho- wever the city, as a motif or thematic constant isn't present only in the realistic narrative but also fantastic narrative pro- se, where authors imaginatively invent new cities and coun- tries for their literary heroes, eg. India Coromandia, Ciciban lives in Cicibania (O. Župančič), the city Ric-Rac (L. Kova- čič), Čenčač lives in Čenčarija (T. Pavček, orig. čenča = tattle), Nigagrad (T. Pavček), Pedenjped in Pedenjempire (N. Grafenauer), Kosovirs in Kosoviria (S. Makarovič). Alt- hough the motif of city isn't always explicity mentioned, it is implicitly present, for example in the short two-liner by An- drey Rozman Roza: »Vojaki in vošibki / korenjakajo. M Assist.
