<plain_text><page sequence="1">FACTS AND COMMENTS PADDLE AND ANVIL APPEARANCE OF SOME SONORAN POTTERY While engaged in recent ethnological field work in the San Miguel Valley of northeastern Sonora,* I had occasion to observe a potter at work. This area, in aboriginal times, was inhabited by the Opata Indian tribe. Today it is predominantly mestizo racially, and culturally is a blend of aboriginal, early Spanish, and Mexican traits. I was assured by many people that the potter, who is extremely Indian in appearance, was "pura indigina." The pottery in use in the village comes from many areas. There is the Guadalajara earthenware so com- mon in Mexico, manufactured china, and a variety of handmade types from throughout Sonora. The pottery made in the village is a buff colored plainware, fairly thick walled, with coarse temper. The core is usually the surface color, rarely black. From examination of the pottery made in the village I had been unable to determine the exact technique used in the forming and finishing of the vessels. It seemed as if they were polished and scraped, though many had the appearance of what I thought paddle and anvil pottery should look like. In the potter's yard and house I saw several pots which, upon cursory examina- tion, led me to believe that while scraped, they also had been worked on by paddle and anvil. While show- ing irregular striations from a scraper, small plane sur- faces on the exterior were backed on the interior with rounded indentations about the diameter of hens' eggs. On both the interior and exterior they showed evidence of polishing with some smooth tool. These pots, which had been made by the old lady in previous years, showed more distinct evidence of the paddle and anvil than any others which I saw in the village. Observation of the manufacture of the pottery re- vealed the following technique. The base of the pot was molded from a ball of moist clay about the size of a cantelope. This ball was first flattened on one side, then hollowed by fist action, then scraped with a piece of gourd to thin the walls. When the molded section achieved the desired form, a round, fat coil was pinched onto the rim, forming one circumference. This coil, formed on a wooden tray and made of the same mate- rial as the base, was thinned by being squeezed and pulled between the hands, and then scraped. Like the molded base, the new section was smoothed by the potter's wet hand, removing most of the striations caused by the scraper. Two more coils were added and thinned, the pot finally reaching the desired height. The rim was formed by turning the pot with the left hand, while the right was bending over the top 2 inches of the olla. Simultaneously the right thumb was push- ing in the neck of the vessel, gently constricting the neck and giving the pot a slightly flaring rim. When this shaping was finished, the entire pot was agaip scraped with the piece of gourd, backed by the bunched fingers of the potter's left hand. As the scraping con- This field work was supported in part by a grant from the Eben F. Comins' Fellowship Fund, Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, Tucson. tinued, small indentations were made on the interior by her fingers. When the gourd bit too deeply, as it frequently did, flat surfaces were formed on the outside. Finally when she was satisfied with her work, she went over the entire pot with her wet hand. When fairly dry it was polished with a smooth stone. On looking at a companion piece of the pot E. B. Sayles, Curator of the Arizona State Museum, stated: "The coiled portion of the pot (the upper part), in particular, has all the appearance of paddle and anvil pottery as frequently defined." The olla has distinct flat surfaces on the exterior and small hollowed areas on the interior, this feature being more marked on the upper portion of the vessel than the lower. In reference again to the upper, coiled portion Sayles remarked: "As sherds there wouldn't be any doubt that this would be classified as paddle and anvil." This was further corro- borated by C. L. Tanner of the Department of Anthro- pology, University of Arizona, who also stated that as sherd material it would be indistinguishable from what is usually classified as paddle and anvil. This paradox, a pot made by coiling and scraping which appears to have been formed by paddle and anvil, is explained, I believe, by the method of scraping and smoothing employed by the potter. The bunched finger tips, and the deep biting scraper formed the hollows and the plane surfaces, then the wet hand removed all or almost all evidence of the fingers and the piece of gourd. This was aided further, by the action of the smooth stone polisher, with the result that coiling was not readily apparent. The remaining evidence points to the paddle and anvil. Though the pottery made by this old lady is below standard for the community, other pots I have seen are quite similar in appearance. The worker was trying to make a smooth, round pot, but she was unable to fully achieve her goal. The results achieved by this potter point to the danger, in this area at least, of assuming the techniques used in pottery manufacture when the process is not observed. ROGER C. OWEN Tucson, Arizona July 20, 1955 FIRED CLAY FIGURINES FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA In San Diego County clay figurines occur sporadically throughout most of the intermediate valleys, inland valleys, and mountain regions, and although of rather wide areal distribution they seem to be numerically rare.* In addition to those described in this report, *The writer wishes to express his appreciation to C. W. Meighan, University of California at Los Angeles, for his generous help with this report. Raymond C. White, University of Califor- nia at Los Angeles, offered many helpful suggestions, and data from his detailed study of Luisefo ethnology. Mr. and Mrs. Verne Jones, Valley Center, California, were most generous with their time and artifacts; 10 figurine fragments have been found by them at a site on their ranch. Mrs. Billie James kindly permitted the writer to examine figurine fragments found at the Jones site by herself and Mr. James prior to selling the property. 291</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY specimens are known to be in the possession of the Museum of Man, San Diego, and the Cuyumaca State Park Museum. A probable fragment was found by B. F. McCown in the excavations at Temecula. Other finds are occasionally reported but have not been documented or described. This report describes a total of 17 whole and fragmentary figurines from 8 sites in the central watershed of the San Luis Rey River, northern San Diego County. All were surface collected except for A A B m n Ir c c IS m uflft lf FIG. 1 [True]. specimens from Valley Center, Site 29, which were excavated by their present owner, Verne Jones, in the course of various farm activities. The figurines were found in all cases on village loca- tions which agree in form and content with San Luis Rey II, described by Meighan (1954) and tentatively dated by him in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 2 instances, at Rincon 4 and Valley Center 29, the figurines were found on an- outlying occupation area adjacent to the main village. In both cases the sites appear to contain a heavier than normal concentration of sherds. Anthropomorphic forms predominate, with only 3 animal figures known. Two general types are noted, those with bulbous terminations, and those which appear to have more tapering terminations. Ten specimens have blunt or rounded terminations, with one anthropo- morphic and 2 animal figures showing breaks indicating probable limb terminations. Rounded fragments have been found that probably represent limb segments. Dec- oration in both types is limited to incising with no evidence of appliqu6 elements found on local speci- mens. The specimens displayed by the San Diego Museum of Man and Cuyumaca State Park Museum have applique elements for eyes. In general they do not resemble specimens described here. The dissimilarities between local forms and the figurines displayed in the San Diego Museum of Man with their applique "coffee bean" eyes are obvious. In spite of this some Yuman or Hohokam southwestern influence is no doubt present in the sample. All local specimens are fired. Yuman and Hohokam figurines are also fired, while most figures from Morss's Northern Tradition area are unfired (Morss 1954). In attempting the brief comparisons of local and Southwestern figurines the writer has leaned heavily on Noel Morss's' monograph. The terms Northern and Southern Traditions are his and apply to figurine styles and areas of the Southwest. The naturalistic, limb-termi- nated anthropomorphic (Fig. 2 E) and animal forms (Fig. 3 G, H, I) are probably similar to specimens de- scribed from the Santa Cruz, Gila Butte, and possibly Snaketown phases of the Colonial and late Pioneer periods of the Hohokam. The apron termination (Fig. 2 D; Fig. 3 F) is described as typical of the Fremont area of Morss's Northern Tradition and similar to a specimen from the Pine Lawn period of the Mogollon (Morss 1954: 100, Fig. 23 h). In general, over-all appear- ances suggest both Basketmaker III and early Hohokam. Morss describes elements common to both of his South- western traditions as well as to some nonsouthwestern areas (Morss 1954: 27). He attributes this to a possible community of origin and influence from the south in post-Basketmaker times. The wide variation in local forms showing resemblances to both of Morss's South- western figurine traditions and to figures described by Heizer from central and northern California is apparent (Heizer and Beardsley 1943). However, they do not seem to be conforming to any common pattern. There exists then an as yet undefined chronological or areal variation in figurines from Southern California. 292 [ XXII, 3, 1957</page><page sequence="3">FACTS AND COMMENTS INCHES I m2 [Tr FIG. 2 [True].

Little or no temper is noted and the texture of the material is fine. The head is modeled with muzzle-like features. There is no neck. Eyes are represented by puncture marks, shoulders are well defined, and breasts are represented by conical swellings which appear to have been bonded to the torso. The basal termination is bulbous and neither smoothed nor decorated. The section tends to be round rather than flattened. The total length is 8.9 cm., width at shoulders 2.5 cm., and width at base 4.0 cm. Number 2 (Fig. 1 B, B1) is a female figurine of brownish color and sandy finish and texture, with little smoothing. Feldspar and quartz inclusions or temper are noted, but they are less than 1 mm. in diameter. The torso tapers from a rounded head to bulbous base without a break and is lacking in limbs or shoulders. Sex is indicated by slight swellings in the upper third of the torso; these appear to have been pinched and modeled from the same piece of clay as the torso. A navel is indicated by a puncture mark above a horizontal ridge crossing the lower midsection. The cross section flattened and tapered except for the basal bulb which is rounded. Decoration consists of incised diamond elements between the breasts. Four punctures are found on the bottom of the basal bulb. Total length is 8.2 cm., width at breasts 1.9 cm., width at navel 2.3 cm., and width at the base 2.5 cm. Number 3 (Fig. 2, A, A1) is a headless torso of brownish gray colored fine-grained micaceous material, not smoothed. The upper portion suggests that shoulders were present although they are not descernible on the remaining fragment. The waist is shaped with 3 incised grooves above it on the front which do not extend to sides or back. The section is somewhat oval except for the bulbous termination which is rounded. Viewed from the side, the torso tapers slightly to the termination with a waist indentation on the dorsal as well as the ventral side. A crack runs the length of the torso where it was dropped and repaired by its present owners; another fracture line is noted on the terminal bulb, but appears to be only superficial. A slight puncture is noted between the 2 lower incised lines that could indicate a navel indentation. Total length is 7.2 cm., width at top of torso 3.6 cm., and width at base 4.1 cm. Number 4 (Fig. 2 B, B1, B2) is a headless torso, brown in color, partially smoothed but not finely finished. The slightly micaceous clay contains some sand temper. Shoulders are ap- parent and the torso is well modeled with a well defined spinal curvature. Breasts are indicated by swellings in the chest region; these seem to have been modeled from the original clay and are not bonded to the torso. The termination is bulbous and without markings. Horizontal lines are incised across the midsection. A navel puncture is located between the 2 lower lines, which do not extend around the sides of the body. The total length is 4.9 cm., width at shoulders is 1.6 cm., width at breasts 1.7 cm., and width at the base 2.4 cm. Number 5 (Fig. 2 C, C1) is a probable female figurine, a semi- smoothed basal fragment, with medium-grained finish, and some fine grit temper. It is of brownish color with a trace of red pig- ment remaining, and no other decoration. A possible indication of female genitalia is incised into the base; this is the only sug- gestion of sex, as the chest region is missing. Total length is 3.7 cm., width at center 1.6 cm., and width at base 2.5 cm. Number 6 (Fig. 2 D, DI) is a basal fragment, slightly smoothed, although the finish is somewhat gritty. Color is gray brown. Some sandy inclusions are present, all under 1 mm. in diameter. A flattened oval in section, this fragment terminates in a roundcd, slightly flared bulbous base. The back is flat and unmodeled except for a slight vertical indentation. A navel is indicated in about the center of the ventral side. Decoration which may repre- sent clothing is shown by 2 horizontal incised lines in the lower midsection. Below these, 7 vertical lines are incised and seem to represent an apron or skirt. Above the horizontal lines multiple crosshatching is present between 2 incised vertical lines. Light crosshatching extends around the sides of the torso beyond the vertical lines but does not reach the back at any point. The back is devoid of all marking. A hole 4 mm. in diameter is located on the base of the termination. Length is 6.8 cm., width at top 2.9 cm., and width at termination 3.2 cm. Number 7 (Fig. 3 A, A1, A2) is an upper torso fragment, brownish red in color, with a gritty finish with little or no smooth- ing. Oval in section, it tapers slightly from shoulders to mid- section break. The back is modeled with a vertical depression from shoulders to midsection. It has no design or markings. Length is 3.9 cm., width at shoulders 2.8 cm., and width at mid- section 2.5 cm. Number 8 (Fig. 2 E, E1, E2) is a headless and legless torso, brownish red in color, with a semismoothed finish. It has a fine-grained texture, with some small inclusions, slightly micacous. The torso tapers from shoulders to bulging midsection and termi- nates with what appear to be legs, broken off at the base of the torso. No decoration is present. A slight puncture, possibly repre- senting a navel is located in the center of the torso. Length is 5.9 cm., width at shoulders 1.6 cm., and width at widest point 3.2 cm. Number 9 (Fig. 3 C) is a cylindrical torso fragment of fine- grained, slightly micaceous material. The torso tapers from the neck to a bluntly pointed termination with no modeling or decora- tion. Length is 7.0 cm., width at shoulders 2.2 cm., and diameter at neck 1.1 cm. In addition to the above described figures a total of 5 addi- tional fragments are shown (Figs. 2 F, F1, G; 3 B, D, E, F). Of these, three are partial or complete terminations, and two are torso midsections. Other fragments of fired clay have been found that are not obvious vessel fragments and are believed to be figurine fragments. However these are not complete enough to determine original forms. Animal representations consist of 3 fragments found on the Jones site (Fig. 3, G, G1, H, H1, I). Of these, two appear to be large quadrupeds and the third, which is only a neck and head, resembles a bird. All are fired clay, gray-brown to brownish red in color with a slightly smoothed gritty finish. Scarcity of specimens and lack of knowledge among the Luisefio does not suggest common usage through any great depth of time. This plus obvious similarities to Southwestern figurines makes it unlikely that local figurine development took place independent of the Southwest. The range of figurine types found in the Mogollon, Hohokam, and Yuman cultural areas, plus possible post- contact Mexican influence in the area could easily ac- count for the present variety of figurine forms here. The similarities of local figurines to Basketmaker III and some Fremont figures, as well as to those found in central and northern California, are such that the pos- sibility of influence from Morss's Northern tradition area can not be ignored. Early introduction from the North- ern tradition area, some local evolution, and a late Yuman pottery influence coupled with strictly limited usage could account for both the variety of forms and scarcity of specimens. Although considered unlikely at present, lack of figurines in San Luis Rey I sites could be attributed to as yet incomplete investigation of the complex and possibly to poor preservation of unfired figures on open sites. Little is known of the functions of figurines locally. Definition of their uses is complicated by the many variant forms, uncertain origins, and differences in chronological placement. Modem Luisefio informants' data are sketchy and the location of the figures archae- ologically gives little clue to their use. Lacking a strati- graphy and specimens from earlier sites, all the present figures must be considered somewhat contemporaneous. For the most part modem Luisefio informants deny knowledge of the figurines found. It seems unlikely that 295</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY they represent children's playthings, as such toys would surely be more common. Reluctance of informants to discuss figurines or outright denial of their existence does not seem justified for common toys, particularly when these same informants can and do define the use of nearly all known elements of the San Luis Rey com- plex. It has been noted that such descriptions become increasingly difficult to obtain as the artifacts or ele- ments approach or become related to certain religious rites. However, 2 informants have stated that they were used as hexing devices by witches and shamans (Ray- mond C. White, personal communications 1955). It was stated that at one time all such devices were made of clay but that in postcontact times cloth materials were substituted. The use of such cloth figures for hexing purposes in the old days is commonly admitted. Death or illness is reported to result from practices in- volving such dolls. Association of figurines and increase rites in many early agricultural economies has been well documented, but lacking direct archaeological evidence or ethnological information the use of figurines in increase rites locally is unlikely. However, ownership of hunting grounds, oak groves, and other seed sources by individuals, fam- ilies, and village complexes, suggests a grove management situation that was conceivably not far removed from early agricultural economies in other areas. Ceremonies to increase the acorn crop are said to have been per- formed in the old days. Details are vague but the described pattern is consistent and has been cross- checked through several informants. No living person is known to have the knowledge needed to perform this rite. The presence of a seed impression suggestive of a small acorn was found in a bulbous termination frag- ment recovered from Rincon 67. This is the only sug- gestion of local associations between figurines and in- crease rites. Admittedly this tiny fragment from a single site is far from adequate evidence of figurine function in increase rites. However, all evidence, however mi- nute, deserves consideration in any determination of origins and functions of figurines in California. HEIZER, R. F. AND R. K.

May, 1955 RADIOCARBON AGE OF THE DAMARISCOTTA SHELL HEAPS * The large oyster shell heaps on both sides of the Damariscotta River, just north of the towns of Damari- scotta and Newcastle, Maine, have been known for many years and both geologists and archaeologists have speculated about their age. During the summer of 1955 I made 2 collections of Mya shells from the largest shell heap on the west side of the river (Glidden estate) for radiocarbon age determinations. Mya shells, though not common in these shell heaps, were selected for this purpose because they have been much less affected by weathering than the thinly laminate oyster shells. One collection came from a small pit approximately 6 feet above mean high tide level in the river and the other from a small pit near the top of the mound, roughly 6 feet below the highest point. According to Meyer Rubin of the U.S. Geological Survey's Radio- carbon Laboratory, the shells collected near the base of the heap gave an age of 1710+160 years (sample W-337) and the shells collected near the top of the heap, 1610 + 160 years (sample W-342). These ages were computed on the basis of shell activity equivalent to modern wood; they were not corrected to C13 activity. J. L. Kulp, Lamont Laboratory, Columbia University, determined for me the radiocarbon age of some oyster shells (sample L-160), which I collected several years ago from a small pit near the base of this same shell heap. These shells gave an age of approximately 1600 +220 years. Although these oyster shells were carefully cleaned and only the soundest parts used, they were in part weathered and would therefore be expected to give an age somewhat younger than the true age. The weath- ered oyster shells could have been changed only by replacement of carbonate from rainwater percolating down through the overlying shells; no older carbonates are admissable because the.mounds stand above all the surrounding terrain. I have corresponded with both Frederick Johnson and Douglas Byers of the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology about the archaeological significance of these dated shell samples. They inform me that the Glidden Shell Heap, like other shell heaps, is made up of a series of overlapping piles of shells and that arti- facts were not plentiful. Although the dated shell col- lections cannot be related to any of the artifacts or to the complex stratigraphy, Johnson believes that they do indicate, in a general way, an age for some kinds of early Point Peninsula pottery found in Maine. The dates indicate also that the heaps may have started to accumu- late soon after the beginning of the Christian era. More- over, as the dated samples came from pits near the base and near the top they suggest that at least the part of the Glidden Heap close to the river may have built up rather rapidly-within one to a few hundred years.
