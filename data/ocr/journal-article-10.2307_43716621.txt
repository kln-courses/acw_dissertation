In this dissertation Bassler sets out to prove that the theologoumenon "divine impartiality" in Rom 2: 1 1, although reflecting a tradition, nevertheless contains Paul's specifically Christian theology. To demonstrate this B. first traces the use of this concept in canonical, deuterocanonical, and rabbinic literature as well as in Philo. This study of the use of the motif establishes several important factors. The expression had become an axiom and was associated with definite complexes of ideas. Its applications were various, flexible, original, and usually related to a crisis in Jerusalem. The axiom underwent a development with a shift in the notion of justice from a this-worldly framework to that of the eschaton. It states that ultimately all will receive God's impartial justice, Israel as well as the nations. In Jubilees the axiom becomes a cosmic principle. Yet nowhere in all these writings does this notion blur the distinction between Israel and the nations. It is, rather, part of Israel's hope that it would be vindicated by God, even though Israel's sins will also be punished. In rabbinic literature the divine impartiality is at best latent. The rabbis, with the exception of the author of Tanna debe Eliahu , usually stressed God's preferential treatment of Israel. Philo also holds this view, but he is not limited by any fixed terminology. However, he strips the axiom of its biblical anthropomorphism and accommodates it</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 141 to the Greek philosophical idea of a divinity. The concept is associated with the subsistent and personified divine justice. Philo uses this axiom to assure the protec- tion of the weak, and thereby also of Israel. The notion is developed quite apart from that of universality. After this background study B. turns to Paul. The main text is Rom 2:1 1. The author establishes rather successfully the literary unity of Rom 1:16-2:1 1 and argues that the entire passage is governed by the axiom of "divine impartiality." B. sees the originality of Paul in applying this rule for the first time to the Jew-Greek division. The Apostle makes the point that all, despite the fact that the law was given to the Jews only, will fare alike before God's final tribunal. B. then traces the influence of this axiom on the rest of Romans, as well as on other Pauline and deutero-Pauline writings and on the rest of the NT, but admits that, outside of Romans 1-2, the theme is only weakly present. Perhaps the best part of this study is the analysis of the usage of this axiom in the OT and other Jewish writings. The examination of the structure of Romans 1-2 is also rather convincing. On the negative side, the author is rather too partial to patterns. Further, some of the assertions made are somewhat questionable and tenuous. For example, the statement that Rom 1:32b, beginning with alla kai , introduces punishment rather than a new and culminating accusation, is supported by a single, unsubstantial verbal echo. Equally questionable is the author's presumption that orge in Rom 1:18 is wholly eschatological. The subsequent development in Romans 1 points rather ob- viously to the present experience of God's wrath. We can, nevertheless, speak there of its eschatological implications. Also, the argument for the presence of impartiality in Romans 3 is quite flimsy. Bassler admits that the theme of "divine impartiality" only weakly enters into Paul's argument in Romans 9- 1 1 and 14-15. In fact, we would ask if it deserves to be treated as a major theme in Romans at all. Joseph Plevnik, S .J., Regis College, Toronto, Canada M4Y 2R5</page></plain_text>
