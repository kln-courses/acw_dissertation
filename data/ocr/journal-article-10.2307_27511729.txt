<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art INUIT: WHEN WORDS TAKE SHAPE The poet WaUace Stevens wrote, "The way through the world, is more difficult to find than the way beyond it." Beautifully designed and profoundly pre sented, the exhibit on Inuit sculpture at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Lyon, France, captures well Steven's telling words in that these forms, fash ioned out of stone, bone, and creative effort, suggest not only symbols of trans formation and transcendence, they also reflect a dramatic reality of Inuit sec ular life?a life of changing communities, environments and cultural diversities. The exhibit of sculpture chosen from many of the most accomplished Inuit artists to date, is a result of a close collaboration between the Museum of Lyon (soon to be the Mus?e des Cultures du Monde) and the Mus?e d'Art Inuit Brousseau, in Quebec, Canada. The Brousseau family has been champions of Inuit art for decades, and their expertise and enormous understanding of In uit life and art is apparent in this first of kind exhibit in France. Michael Cote's vision for this extraordinary gathering of art and culture finds a precise partnership with the Brousseau's seasoned and wise direction. The exhibition illustrates the many dimensions of Inuit life and culture. Although the sculptures depict a wide-ranging approach to the difficulties of northern worlds, in particular the demands and rituals involved in hunting and subsistence living, these representations of daily struggle and cultural adaptability are also twinned with shamanic themes of shape-shifting and spirit travel that underscore anthropomorphic qualities attributed to natural entities. The Inuit see themselves as ila, in other words, part of social whole. The notion of "person" is thus translated as someone with relational affinity, and this simple and complicated sense of affinity includes both the natural and communal surroundings. The exhibit captures well this encompassing re ality that the Inuits maintain, especially in the deft way the themes of nature, hunting, religion, community, and modernity are juxtaposed in each well constructed section. Those familiar with Inuit art will be treated to early and current works by well-known artists.

We can only hope that this exhibition continues to travel, widening like water from a stone, not unlike these wonderous stone sculptures and finely-crafted figures dropped into our imaginations.
