<plain_text><page sequence="1">On vajrapurusa by Laura Giuliano Introduction In an article published in the Rivista degli Studi Orientali (Giuliano 1998) we applied figurative comparison and textual evidence in the attempt to identify an image appearing beside Indra in two N?g?rjunakonda reliefs as personification of the vajra or vajrapurusa. Displaying on top of his head a 'fleur-de-lis' identical in style to the vajra depicted at N?g?rjunakonda and in the ?ndhra sites (ibid:. 149, figs. 3-5), the personage appears on a fragmentary medallion from st?pa 3 with a scene of Buddha worship (Fig. 1) (Longhurst 1938: pi. XIV.&lt;:; P.R. Ramachandra Rao 1956: pi. XII; 1984: pi. CXXVIII, fig. 387; Rosen Stone 1994: fig. 157; Giuliano 1998: figs. l-la) and in a panel with the Indrasaila episode (Fig. 3) (Longhurst 1938: pi. XLIV.?; Rosen Stone 1994: fig. 218; Giuliano 1998: figs. 2-2b). In the former case the personage characterised by a thick curly head of hair and the 'fleur-de-lis' sign on the head appears beside Indra (Fig. 2) amid a close throng of male figures sitting in anjalimudr? at the feet of the Buddha, seated and in abhayamudra\ in the second relief, the figure is shown twice, again displaying the stylised 'fleur-de-lis' on top of the head: to the right, he is seated beside Indra (Fig. 4) intent on listening to the words of the Buddha in the cave of Indrasaila while, to the left, he again appears close to the deity (Fig. 5) in a scene probably showing a later phase of the same episode, namely Indra's return to his celestial dwelling on the back of the elephant Air?vata. If our interpretation of this figure as vajrapurusa is correct, then the images * This work was carried out in the ambit of post-doctorate research at the Archaeological Department of Deccan College, financed by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. I take this opportunity to thank all those who have offered their support during my stay in India, and in the first place my tutor, Professor Gouri Lad, who has advised me and encouraged me with highly relevant discussion of the subject as well as giving me her human support in dealing with many practical situations, and Professor Deglurkar, with whom I had various opportunities to discuss the subject. I also have a debt of gratitude to Professor Anna Maria Quagliotti, who kindly dedicated much time to me with advice, ideas and bibliographic references and Professor Claudine Bautze Picron, who supplied me with some bibliographical references that proved indispensable in the preparation of this text. Finally I wish to acknowledge the great help I received from the late Professor Maurizio Taddei, to thank Professor Raffaele Torella, for his helpfulness and precious advice, and Professor Arcangela Santoro for the encouragement she has given me to forge ahead with this research.

This image may indeed represent the prototype of the vajrapurusa and ?yudhapurusa images in general; however, we have no figurative evidence associating these with the later examples. Thus it remains an example isolated in time and space which can have no certain interpretation (Giuliano 1998:174). (2) Against this well-known theory, however, note that the ?yudhapurusa images in Cave 6 at Udayagiri appear to follow a well-established iconographic formula frequently recurring in other structures on the site (Caves 9, 10, 11: Visnu with cakrapurusa and gad?devt [AAB neg. 73.54; 73.84; . AUS neg. 229.14]; Cave 12: Narasimha with cakrapurusa and gad?devt [AUS neg. 309.72]). The images in question do not, therefore, appear to be the outcome of figurative experimentation, but seem to emerge from a long process of evolution. [3] 249</page><page sequence="4">The idea of personifying the vajra is not foreign to Indian tradition, as is confirmed by ample literary and figurative evidence. On the evidence of our precedent study, the concept occurs in texts of various periods: in certain passages in the Gr by a s?tra of Gobhila (3), in the Mah?bh?rata (4) and in some portions of the ?gamas (3). At the figurative level we showed that versions of vajrapurusa depiction can be seen in Nepal, in a period between the 8th and 11th centuries (Figs. 15-21) (Giuliano 1998: 163-66, figs. 11-17), but in any case much later than the N?g?rjunakonda examples, while the rarity of this subject in actual Indian territory has been observed (ibid:. 162, 171). So much emerged from our previous research. Two points remain to be clarified: a) on the one hand, we have the contrasting literary and figurative evidence - in fact, while theorisation of the vajrapurusa finds mention in the Brahmanical texts, application of the figurative device has been found solely in Buddhist environments (ibid: 172); b) from the iconographical point of view, on the other hand, the documentation assembled up to a few years ago did not suffice to bridge the chronological gap between the N?g?rjunakonda iconographical model and the later depiction of the personified vajra, nor to follow the progress of this motif (ibid: 171). With the results of our latest research set out here we hope to shed some new light on the matter. In the course of an investigation that we are still working on, we have been able to observe that the vajrapurusa image is fairly frequent not only in the territory of Nepal, but also in India. Along with the N?g?rjunakonda depictions, revolutionising the iconographical theories of the ?yudhapurusa, we do in fact find further examples of the vajrapurusa, above all in the caves of western Deccan and in Bih?r. Moreover, the data available to us show that depiction of the subject is not confined to the Buddhist environment, as the evidence of finds had suggested until a few years ago, but can also be found in Brahmanical contexts. In the first part of this study we shall confine our attention to description of the various images which, we believe, may be interpreted as vajrapurusa, dividing them into two groups, i.e. Buddhist images (I) and images from Brahmanical environments (II). Within these groupings the images will be further ordered on the basis of a geographical criterion.

We also raise a number of problems which we shall, however, be dealing with more exhaustively in the closing section of this paper (III) when, after due con? sideration of the chrono? logical sequence of depictions we shall attempt to reconstruct the iconographical evolution of the motif, pinpointing common and differentiating features among the various examples (III.l), identifying a series of typologies of the subject (III.2), and finally advancing some hypotheses on the transformation or transmission of certain im? ages and the thinking and philosophical concept behind them (III.3). I. The vajrapur us a : Buddhist Images LI K?nheri A vajrapurusa image of a period some centuries after N?g?rjunakonda can be identified in Cave 90 at K?nheri. This small cave, preceded by a veranda, is decorated in every part with reliefs (6), including a striking mandala composition displaying a Buddha in dharmacakramudr?, seated in pralamhap?d?sana on a lotus flower supported by two n?gas with n?gini on either side of them (Fig. 6) (Fergusson &amp; Burgess 1880: pi. LVI; Leese 1983: fig. 479; S. Huntington 1989: fig. 12.25). On either side of the Buddha we see a standing bodhisattva. In the corners of the relief four smaller Buddha* identical to the central figure can be seen, while to the right and left vertical lines of four standing Buddha* border the composition (7). At an (6) For a detailed description of the place see Leese 1983: 101-2. (7) Leese {ibid.: 246), who identifies the scene as the 'Miracle of Sravasti', points out that the composition represents 'a new interpretation of an oft-repeated theme in late Ajant?'s sculpted panels'. S. Fluntington (1989: 263-64), by contrast, rightly points out the mandala structure of the depiction and 252 [6]</page><page sequence="7">^^^^^ Fig. 7 - Pancasikha and a nymph. Detail of Fig. 6. (Photo by the author). Fig. 8 - Indra and vajrapurusa. Detail of Fig. 6. (Photo by the author). intermediate level, between the n?ga figures and the Buddhas lotus throne, there appears a scene of particular interest consisting of four figures seated on the corollas of flowers on either side of the stem of the main lotus. To the right, a man plays a harp beside a female figure (Fig. 7); to the left, Indra is represented with his typical headdress, accompanied by the vajrapurusa (Fig. 8) (8), the latter showing a thick head of hair, partings sharp and clear, the three tips of the vajra emerging from the head. The arms are crossed over the chest in an attitude that, on the basis of textual evidence, Jamkherdkar (1977-78) defines as hasta svastika or svastikad?na - an attitude displaying submission and devotion (9) that often appears associated with interprets the image of the central Buddha as Sarvavid Vairocana and the four smaller Buddha^ at the corners of the composition as the four jinas. Together with the principal image these constitute the five jinas of the pancajina mandala, and - according to the author - represent the sambhogak?ya level. In contrast, the nirm?nak?ya is thought to be symbolised by the eight images of m?nusi Buddha* appearing in the two vertical rows at the sides. (8) For interpretation of this figure as vajrapurusa see Lippe 1978: 9; Pal 1974: 121, fig. 53; 1978: fig. 73. (9) Jamkherdkar (1977-78: 6) argues that 'such a gesture of hands signified an auspicious omen of welcome, and hence respect and obedience shown to a person with authority, e.g. a royal personage. [7] 253</page><page sequence="8">images of vajrapurusa (10) and various other ?yudhapurusas and attendants I11). As at N?g?rjunakonda, the scene the figure appears to take part in is in all probability the episode of Indrasaila (Lippe 1978: 9), recounted in the Sakkapanha S?tta of the Dighanik?ya and in the commentary to this text, the Sumahgala Vil?sini - a tale associated with a long figurative tradition in Buddhist art (Foucher 1905, I: 492-97; Coomaraswamy 1928: 33-41; Soper 1949: 254-58). In fact, the image to the right (Fig. 7) does not represent Brahma, as S. Huntington (1989: 263) argues, but must be Pancasikha, the gandharva, in the episode as recounted by the sources, who leads Indra in before the Buddha, playing the harp and singing of profane love for a nymph, here surely the female figure seated beside him. 1.2 Ellora The greatest number of vajrapurusa depictions have been found in the Buddhist caves of Ellora. One of the most famous images of the subject can be seen on the wall to the right of the entrance to Cave 6 (Fig. 9) (Gupte 1962: pi. LV middle, right; 1964: pi. 4a; Malandra 1993: fig. 21; Bhattacharya 1995-96: fig. 8; Giuliano 1998: fig. 10) (12), beside a bodhisattva that some - on the evidence of the caitya on the mukuta - identify as Maitreya (Malandra 1993: 29; Kim 1997: 178), others as Vajrap?ni (Gupte 1962: 164) (13). Our personage, to the left of the bodhisattva, wears a decorated The sculptural evidence shows that this gesture was associated with attendants, even of gods'. Pal (1978: 120; 1985: 91), on the other hand, follows Kramrisch (1964: 60, 129) in defining the gesture as vinaya hasta, although the sources offer no support for the term. With regard to this position of the cakrapurusa images, Begley (1973: 43, n. 200) points out: 'Although it would be tempting to interpret the crossed arms as a visual metaphor for the spokes of a wheel, it seems more probable that the gesture is merely a conventional one, signifying self-assurance, or perhaps merely devotion'. In contrast, Brancaccio (1995: 190-91) holds it possible that 'tale mudr? [...] simbolicamente rappresenti un vajra\ and that it has 'una sostanziale caratteristica fotistica. E un gesto luminoso e ritengo che in tal senso esso possa essere stato associato al cakra, scintillante arma di Visnu, quasi un equivalente del vajra . On this subject see also Devendra (1956: 126 ff.), which is also the starting point for the work by Jamkherdkar, and van Kooij (1985, II: 679 ff.). (10) See the vajrapurusa images,at Ellora, discussed later in this paper (Figs. 9-12) and the Nepalese vajrapurusa^ of Dvhaka Bahal (Fig. 18), of Patan (Fig. 17), of the Los Angeles County Museum (Figs. 16, 19-20), the Doris Wiener Gallery (Fig. 21) and the Norton Simon Museum (Fig. 15). (n) This gesture also characterises, for example, the cakrapurusas in the relief of Sesasayin at Deogarh (van Kooij 1985: fig. 1), in the Visnu image in the Mathur? Museum (Begley 1973: fig. 5), in the Harihara relief in the Allahabad Museum (Chandra 1965-66: fig. 203^), and the tris?lapurusas of N?chn? Kuthara (P.K. Agrawala 1968: pis. XIV, XXIII), of Mukhalinga (Barrett 1960: pi. 17), of Bhuvanesvara (Mani 1985: fig. 26). (12) Bhattacharya (1995-96: 333) erroneously supposes that this is the earliest representation of the personified vajra. (13) Even Bhattacharya (1995-96: 333, 345, n. 18) is not sure to identify the bodhisattva as Maitreya and seems to suppose an interpretation of the figure as Vajrap?ni. 254 [8]</page><page sequence="9">^^^^ Fig. 9 - Ellora, Cave 6. Vajrapurusa carved to the right of the sanctum. (Photo by the author). Fig. 10 - Vajrapurusa. Detail of Fig. 9. (Photo G. Sguazzini). crown surmounted by three wavy, pointed spikes - evidently one of the ends of the vajra - and various jewels including large circular earrings (Fig. 10). He is also shown in praty?tidh?sana - the position for combat - with the weight of the body borne by the bent left leg, arms in hasta svastika. While the body of the vajrapurusa shows a leftward movement, away from the bodhisattva, the face is turned to the right, looking up to the 'master'. Thus the figure is ready for the assault against the enemies of the dharma (praty?tidh?sana), but at the same time appears in a submissive attitude of devotion towards the deity (hasta svastika, eyes turned to the bodhisattva). In comparison with the K?nheri figure, the role of the personage appears modified here: no longer that of a silent onlooker, he now incarnates an extension of the bodhisattva's energy, taking the form of a living, conscious being capable of acting autonomously in defence of Sacredness, ever attuned to the divine will and the law of the dharma (14). (14) Note that in Cave 6 at Ellora the bodhisattva-vajrapurusa group is completed with a female figure and the image of a dwarf to the right of the bodhisattva. The composition as a whole recalls the depiction of a sculptural group to the left of the entrance to the cell in Cave 7 at Aurangabad (Berkson [9] 255</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 11 - Ellora, Cave 2. Relief of the Buddha with two attendant bodhisattva* to the right of the sanctum. The bodhisattva to the left of the Buddha is accompanied by a vajrapurusa. (Photo by courtesy of the American Institute for Indian Studies, neg. 37521). A similar depiction can be seen in Cave 2, in a small panel carved to the right of the sanctum (Fig. 11, AUS neg. 37521). The scene shows a Buddha in dharmacakramudr? and pralambap?d?sana, feet resting on a double lotus, with two attendants - one on either side - not readily identifiable, their sole attribute being the c?mara. The personage to the left of the Buddha (bodhisattva Vajrap?ni?) is accompanied by a vajrapurusa identified by the three spikes emerging from the top of the head (Fig. 12). Unlike the figure in the Cave 6 (Fig. 9), this one is plump with a curly head of hair and has the proportions of a dwarf. In common with the previous example it has the position of the hands in hast a svastika, and large circular 1986: 125): here too a bodhisattva of no certain identification holds his right hand raised to chest level in vitarka mudr? (like Maitreya in Cave 6 at Ellora) and is accompanied, to the left, by a personage wearing a tiara and, to the right, by a female figure resting her hand on the head of a dwarf. A similar scene also appears in Cave 6 at Aurangabad, to the right of the entrance to the cell (see pp. [13]-[14]). 256 [10]</page><page sequence="11">earrings. The position of the body is not very clear, the right leg being covered by the lotus upon which the principal attendant is depicted. It is, however, quite likely that here too the intention is to reproduce the praty?tidh?sana, the left leg being bent like that of the vajrapurusa in Cave 6 (15). In Cave 10 - the so-called 'Visvakarma Cave', one of the last works of Buddhist rock architecture and probably the last caityagrha carved on Indian soil - we find an image of problematic interpretation that, we believe, displays characteristics attributable to the iconography we have been dealing with. On the second-storey terrace, to the right, near the entrance to the first cell, we see an image of a nude figure with four or six (?) arms wielding the vajra in the lower left hand, an unidentifiable object in the lower right hand which rests on the hip, and the long handle of an attribute now lost in the upper right hand (Fig. 13) (Burgess 1883: pi. XIX.4; Gupte 1964: pi. 10#). The figure has thick curly hair and three wavy, pointed spikes emerging from the head (Fig. 14), and is further characterised by a nimbus and a snake wrapped round the neck, the ends coming down over the chest and the right arm. Burgess (1883: 11) identified the personage as Vajrap?ni, or as an early form of Vajrap?ni in the terrific aspect of Chyag-rdor, 'the subduer of evil spirits', as represented in Tibet. No other scholar has since questioned the interpretation, and indeed Gupte (1964: 88, 93) embraces Burgess' idea while pointing out that this is the only four-armed Vajrap?ni to be found on the Ellora site, while Bhattacharya (1995-96: 326) goes no further than citing the theories of the scholars preceding him. Actually, however, the meaning of certain iconographical details of the depiction has never been examined in depth. Various features of the Fig. 12 - Bodhisattva and vajrapurusa. Detail of the relief shown in Fig. 11. (Photo by the author). (15) The same personage is possibly also portrayed to the right of the entrance to Cave 2 where, beside a badly damaged dv?rap?la, which may well be the bodhisattva Vajrap?ni (the remains of a vajra can be seen in his left hand), we see an equally worn down accompanying figure of diminutive dimensions, arms crossed over chest, left leg bent forward (?), probably personifying the vajra. In fact, despite the eroded condition of the stone it seems clear that the personage in question is characterised by a thick head of hair with three spikes rising from his head. [11] 257</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 13 - Ellora, Cave 10. Vajrapurusa carved on the second-storey terrace. (Photo by the author). Fig. 14 - Vajrapurusa. Detail of Fig. 13. (Photo by the author). image suggest it should be identified as the vajrapurusa. The three spikes emerging from the head are undoubtedly half of a vajra, the form being identical to that of the weapon the figure wields in his right hand. Together with this particular, the figure has other characteristics in common with the vajrapurusa* so far described: the hair is thick and curly, as in the depictions of N?g?rjunakonda (Fig. 2), K?nheri (Fig. 8) and Cave 2 at Ellora (Fig. 12). Moreover, the personage wears the same type of large circular earrings as the vajrapurusa* in Caves 2 and 6. At the same time, the snake coiling round the neck and the nimbus represent an iconographical innovation. The nimbus would suggest the divinisation of the vajrapurusa and a cult attributed to this member of the Buddhist pantheon: indeed, the image is isolated and accompanied neither by the Vajrap?ni nor by any other deity. It is worth recalling that isolated vajrapurusa images, which were probably objects of cult, characterised by nimbus and serpent, have been attested in Nepal since the 9th century (16). As (16) 'Even the anthropomorphized vajra seems to have had an independent cult in Nepal Mandala during the Licchavi and Transitional Periods. There are a number of portable bronzes of Vajrapurusa, 258 [12]</page><page sequence="13">examples we may cite the bronzes in the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena, California (Fig. 15) (Slusser 1982, II: fig. 469; Giuliano 1998: fig. 15), in the Los Angeles County Museum (Fig. 16) (Pal 1985: 96, fig. S.16; Bhattacharya 1995-96: fig. 14; Giuliano 1998: fig. 16) and the Patan stone sculpture (Fig. 17) (Slusser 1982, II: fig. 470; Giuliano 1998: fig. 17). 1.3 Aurangabad When considering the iconographical history of the vajrapurusa it is as well to take into account certain icons that have no particularly apparent connection with our subject, lacking the identifying 'sign' of the vajra at the top of the head, but that nevertheless still have the ?yudhapur^^ function in our opinion. Note that, apart from the isolated images of the vajrapurusa, the personifications of the vajra so far described accompany deities or bodhisattva^ devoid of attributes, in some cases identified on the evidence of their attendant. In contrast, in the cases we shall now be considering, the bodhisattva displays the vajra and can therefore be identified as Vajrap?ni, without any need for interpretation of the secondary figures. Moreover, the accompanying figure exhibits no attributes characterising him directly as personification of the weapon. One of these sculptural compositions can be seen in Aurangabad Cave 6, which was excavated under the Kalacuri domination (Fig. 22) (J.C. Huntington 1981: fig. \h\ Berkson 1986: 179-80). Here, alongside the Vajrap?ni, who holds the vajra in his left hand, is a personage in ?tidhasana and hasta svastika displaying a high headdress decked with jewels and a ferocious expression on the face, eyes starting from their sockets (Figs. 23-24). To the right of the bodhisattva is a female figure Fig. 15 - Vajrapurusa from Nepal. Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena, California. (After Slusser 1982, II: fig. 469). which though they may once have accompanied larger separate images of the Bodhisattva, show no sign of previous physical attachment, and could have been made as independent objects of worship' (Slusser 1982,1: 284). [13] 259</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 16 - Vajrapurusa from Nepal. Los Angeles County Museum of Art. (After Pal 1985: fig. SI6). looking towards the sanctum, who is probably T?r?. Let us now compare this sculptural group with the figures guarding the entry to the cell in Ellora Cave 6 (Fig. 9), which we have already mentioned (see p. [9], n. 14). The icono graphical scheme is the same: the bodhisattva holds his right hand raised to chest level and is accompanied by a male figure to the left and a female personage to the right, the latter resting her right hand on the head of a dwarf in the Ellora relief. While, as we have seen, interpretation of the Ellora bodhisattva remains uncertain (see p. [8]), the figure in Aurangabad Cave 6 wields a vajra which identifies him unequivocally as Vajrap?ni. In both cases, moreover, we find the bodhisattva/dv?rap?la's attendant in fighting posture {praty?tidh?sana or ?tidh?sana), arms crossed in hasta svastika. At Ellora this figure is distinctly recognisable as vajrapurusa because of the spikes emerging from his head, while the Aurangabad figure shows no such iconographical feature and is therefore harder to 260 [14]</page><page sequence="15">interpret. Nevertheless, in this case we see in the identity of the 'master' evidence to identify his attendant: the presence of Vajrap?ni and the iconographical analogies the secondary figure at Aurangabad shares with the vajrapurusas suggest that this personage should be interpreted as an anthropomorphic projection of the vajra wielded by the bodhisattva. As Brancaccio (1995: 189) rightly points out, the figure conserves 'il retaggio funzionale di un ?yudhapurusa, nonostante il vajra sia tenuto nelle mani della divinit?'. He displays the characteristics of a krodha - a wrathful looking attendant - whose task it is to protect the faithful and strike fear in the enemies of the Buddhist faith (17). 1.4 Eastern India: N?land?, Bodh Gay? There are two sculptures from eastern India that differ greatly from the Aurangabad ~ T7 . , A, i. . n i 7 i Fig. 17 - Patan. Vajrapurusa. (After composition stylistically, but nevertheless Slusser 1982, II: fig. 470). show striking figurative affinities with it. The first is a 7th-century image from N?land? belonging to the Irving collection, and now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art (Fig. 25) (Bhattacharya 1995-96: fig. 1), showing a Vajrap?ni with hair worn in Gupta-style curls, a vajra in his right hand at navel-level, left hand resting on the head of a dwarf attendant with ferocious-looking face, canines protruding from his mouth, wearing serpent-shaped upavita, armlets and necklaces. The dwarf's right hand is in tarjani mudr?, while his left arm rests on an axe (parasu) pointing to the ground. The second sculpture, probably from Bodh Gay? and datable around the 8th century, belongs to the David Young collection and again shows a Vajrap?ni with the attribute in the right hand, left hand on hip and a three-pointed crown (Fig. 26) (ibid.: fig. 3). Accompanying him is a dwarf personage in praty?tidh?sana and (17) J.C. Huntington (1981: 50) identifies this image as Krodhacandratilaka, a krodha of Vajrap?ni in the Mah?karun?garbhadh?tumandala described in the Mah?vairocana s?tra.

(After Slusser 1982, II: fig. 464). hasta svastika, ferocious face and protruding canine teeth, the p?sa in his left hand and various ornaments including circular earrings and a serpent over the left shoulder (Fig. 27). The figure accompanying Vajrap?ni in these sculptures does not display the vajra in his headdress but - as at Aurangabad - most probably represents an iconographical residue of the vajrapurusa and essentially performs the same function as the personifications, as emanation of the 'master's offensive/defensive power. Significantly, he is portrayed with a terrifying look (ugra), showing a ferocious face with protruding canines and eyes starting from the sockets (18). (18) According to Bhattacharya (1995-96: 329) however, the attendant in Fig. 25 'does not appear to be Vajrapurusa, because Vajrapurusa is quite a calm figure with hands crossed on his chest in a gesture of submission'. However, the author has some doubts about the accompanying image in Figs. 26-27: 'We are not sure if we can identify this image as Vajrapurusa or the personified vajra?' (ibid.: 330).

The vajrapurusa: Brahmanical Images In Brahmanical environments, too, we find a series of depictions attributable to the vajrapurusa typology. However, an important point to bear in mind here is that figures showing a trident emerging from the head - an iconographical typology interpreted as vajrapurusa in Buddhism - traditionally represent personification of the tris?la, the attribute of Siva, in Brahmanical art (19). The figurative features these doubts, he wonders whether these two depictions might have served as models for the Nepalese Vajrap?ni and vajrapurusa images, in this connection recalling the group in Cave 6 at Ellora {ibid.: 332). (19) Siva or his dv?rap?las often appear accompanied by this figure, examples being in the Allahabad Museum (R.C. Agrawala 1960: fig. A; Chandra 1965-66: fig. 203a), of N?chn? Kuthara (P.K.

Ill Ellora An illuminating example once again comes from Ellora where, in the latter half of the 6th century A.D., the Kalacuri, of declared P?supata faith, had a number of Brahmanical caves excavated in the vicinity of the great waterfall (Spink 1967a). In structure 21, the so-called 'Ramesvara Cave', the guardians of the sanctum and their attendants show an interesting compositional arrangement. Beside the dv?rapala to the left of the cell is depicted a tris?lapurusa in praty?tidh?sana and hasta svastikay wearing a ferocious expression on his face (Figs. 28-29) (Gupte 1962: pi. CXXVI right). His mukuta displays a skull on the right side and a large tris?la with wavy lateral spikes at the top. On the same side of the entrance a very small relief carved at the base of the doorframe shows the same scene, namely a dv?rapala accompanied by a tris?lapurusa in hasta svastika (Figs. 30-31). 266 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 30 - Ellora, Cave 21. Relief showing a dv?rap?la and a tris?lapurusa carved at the base of the doorframe (left). (Photo by the author). Fig. 31 - Tris?lapurusa. Detail of Fig. 30. (Photo by the author). Somewhat more puzzling is identification of the figure accompanying the dv?rap?la to the right of the sanctum in the same cave (Fig. 32) (Malandra 1993: fig. 19) (20). The attendant exhibits the features of a paunchy dwarf (21) with his arms in hasta svastika. The headdress is characterised by a series of curls or plaits while the elaborate mukuta shows a truncated pyramid element with a pointed end, which seems to emerge from the head (Fig. 33). A miniature reproduction of the scene is again displayed on the doorframe, this time on the lower right-hand side (Fig. 34). The personages mukuta is an elaboration of the one worn by the dv?rap?la shown beside him (Fig. 32), and by the tris?lapurusa to the left of the cell (Fig. 29). This form of crown, with three rounded points, is often depicted in the caves of the Kalacuri period. For example, a model very similar to the one worn by the attendant in Cave 21 can be seen on the head of the Vajrap?ni in Aurangabad Cave 2, showing a join decorated with beads, lotus flowers along the sides and a curving line (20) My thanks go here to Pia Brancaccio, who kindly drew my attention to this image, realising the importance it could have in the context of research on the vajrapurusa. (21) Note that the attendant on the left of the cell (Fig. 28) shows somewhat diminutive proportions with respect to the dv?rapala, but otherwise retains normal proportions.

(Photo by the author). connecting the side points with the central one (Fig. 36) (22). Moreover, the Vajrap?ni here exhibits a headdress with plaits much like the Ellora image (23). In the case of the secondary figure in Cave 21, however, the central point of the crown is replaced with an inverted truncated pyramid motive with pyramidal end, not to be seen in other examples. Rather than a feature completing the diadem with a decorative function, the motif can be interpreted as an object protruding from the head in accordance with the typology encountered for the ?yudhapurusa images. This appears all the more evident when we turn to the reproduction of the (22) Similar headgear, more or less ornate, more or less vertical, occasionally associated with the jata, is to be seen on the heads of a number of Vajrap?rm (Aurangabad: Caves 1,2,5,6; K?nheri: Cave 90 etc.), bodhisattv&amp;r (Aurangabad: Caves 6, 7; K?nheri: Cave 90), figures accompanying the bodhisattva^ (Aurangabad: Caves 6 and 7) and personages of the Brahmanical pantheon (Mandapeswar: personage dancing in the relief of Natar?ja; Ellora: Cave 26, figure accompanying the dv?rap?la on the left of the cell). (23) Also the figure accompanying the bodhisattva to the left of the sanctum in Cave 6 at Aurangabad and the two bodhisattvar on either side of the Buddha, in the image in Cave 90 of K?nheri (Fig. 6), show the combination of three-pointed crown and plaited hair. 268 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 34 - Ellora, Cave 21.

(Photo by the author). dv?rap?la/'attendant group portrayed on the doorframe, where the figure accompanying the dv?rap?la wears no crown but shows a pointed object emerging from his head (Figs. 34-35). Again, it is worth noting that the truncated pyramid element on our personage's head coincides perfectly with a half vajra, as it appears depicted in Gandh?ran reliefs. In fact, in India we find two basic typologies to depict this weapon: a) the vajra with 'double trident', and b) the Gandh?ran (or so-called Gandh?ran) vajra, showing an 'hourglass' or a 'bone' shape, a typology for which manifold variants can be found (Giuliano 1997: 118-23). A common example of the latter is a quadrangular or hexagonal model characterised by a double truncated pyramidal element, with pyramidal ends or ends curving in profile (Fig. 37) (24), exactly like (24) This weapon typology first appears at S?nchi, at the time of the construction of the tor anas. In the relief of Visvantara j?taka, on the northern tor ana of the Great St?pa, the vajra is depicted like an 'hourglass' consisting of two truncated hexagonal pyramids, from the base of which a pointed protuberance stands out (Marshall &amp; Foucher, n.d., II: pi. 29). Apart from a few rare examples, the Gandh?ran vajra iconography derives directly from this typology. However, it differs from the S?nchi vajra in that the pointed protuberance has been eliminated.

Moreover, this vajra typology is not confined to Gandh?ra alone, but also appears in Mathur? (Fig. 38: year 32 of the Kaniska dynasty), Kasmir (Fig. 39: 8th century), Bih?r - where the basic model is either faithfully reproduced or undergoes reinterpretation, occasionally taking on the 'double spear-point' form (Fig. 49: 6th century) - and in other parts of India (25). The same type with slight modification can also be seen at Ellora, in the relief of the Saptam?trk?* displayed in the niche to the right of Cave 22 (Soundara Rajan 1981: pi. LXXVII): on this occasion Indr?ni exhibits a vajra which is of clear derivation from the 'hourglass' model. In outline the weapon appears (25) A similar vajra model is also known in Afghanistan at B?miy?n, Cave G (Klimburg Salter 1989: pi. XLVII, fig. 7), and at Tap? Sard?r in the hands of Durga Mahis?sura (Taddei 1973: 203-13, fig. 15.8; Taddei &amp; Verardi 1978: fig. 82). 270 [24]</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 38 - Vajrap?ni.

(After S. Huntington 1989: fig. 17.4). identical with the Gandh?ran type, although the object takes on a more flattened form here (Fig. 40) (26). (26) The course taken by iconographical features from the northern regions to the caves of western India is well documented. For example, Dillard Collins (1988: 150) points out how important the heritage of the northern regions is in determination of the iconographical sources of Elephanta: 'Concerning the Lakulisa and especially the Mah?deva images of Siva at Elephanta, prototypes clearly seem to have come from the north with the Gandh?ran area of the Kus?na dynasty as a distant source. These forms were then developed throughout the regions of Kasmir, R?jasth?n and Gujarat before they were used at Elephanta'. Again, if we consider Buddhist art, we find motifs that must have originated in Gandh?ra and the neighbouring regions frequently appearing in the western caves (Divakaran 1988: 156-57). Moreover, the migration of these iconographical features to Deccan is borne out by historical events: since the mid-5th century, the Huna occupation of the northern regions and consequent devastation had led to a general instability ill-suiting the monastic life. As Divakaran (ibid.: 155) argues, it is very probable that many monks fled to safer places, creating a sort of exodus towards the communities of Deccan, the more easterly regions of the Gupta empire and, finally, Nepal. [25] 271</page><page sequence="26">we In the light of these analogies propose that the object on the head of the personage in Cave 21 should be interpreted as the upper part of an 'hourglass' vajra, and the bearer of the 'sign' as the vajrapurusa. In fact, the weapon on the head of the vajrapurusa in the Brahmanical caves may well be depicted on the basis of a model taking inspiration from the 'northern' iconography of the object, which differs from the tripartite vajra typology appearing on the head of the Buddhist vajrapurusa^ since the times of N?g?rjunakonda. In all likelihood this is a conscious choice, dictated by the need to differentiate between personification of the vajra and repres? entation of the tris?lapurusa in a Brah? manical context. If our interpretation is correct, moreover, such differentiation becomes all the more imperative in Ellora Cave 21 since the iconographical pattern created for this structure includes both tris?lapurusa and vajrapurusa in the same sculptural composition at the sides of the sanctum. We shall be returning to the reasons for the presence of the vajrapurusa in a Saiva environment: for the time being suffice it to recall that the vajra had been among the attributes of Siva since Kus?na times, as various images of the deity and the literary evidence make clear (see pp. [43]-[45]), and that the vajrapurusa image is indeed theorised in the texts of this religious tradition, and particularly in those belonging to the Saiva Siddh?nta tradition (see p. [43]). Thus interpretation of the Cave 21 image as vajrapurusa is borne out by ample literary and iconographical evidence, which we shall be discussing later, as well as by the formal similarity of the object protruding from the head of the personage with the 'hourglass' vajra. Cave 21 at Ellora does not seem an isolated case: a portrayal of the Brahmanical vajrapurusa could in fact also be identified in Cave 26, a rock structure showing marked architectural, stylistic and iconographical affinities with Cave 21 (27). Fig. 40 - Ellora, Cave 22. Vajra in the hand of Indr?ni. Detail of the relief of the Saptam?trk?s carved in the niche to the right of the cave. (Photo by the author). (27) Indeed, Spink (1967b: 14) pointed out that The relationships between Cave 26 and Cave 21 are so striking that they must be noted. They suggest that an architect (or group of architects) was now asserting a remarkably potent influence on the development of the site's temples. [...] It is interesting to note how very similar Caves 21 and 26 are in many details: in general layout, in size, in the insistently high quality of their carving, etc. Furthermore, in type and treatment, their shrine guardians and the lesser figures associated with these guardians might almost be by the same hand'. 272 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 41 - Ellora, Cave 26. Dv?rap?la and s?lapurusa carved to the left of the sanctum. (Photo by the author). Fig. 42 - S?lapurusa. Detail of Fig. 41. (Photo by the author). Here we find much the same scheme as at the entrance to the sanctum in structure 21. The dv?rap?la to the left of the cell is accompanied by an attendant in hasta svastika and praty??dh?sana (Fig. 41) (Gupte 1962: pi. CXXIX), the latter showing no tris?la on the top of his head, as does the figure in Cave 21, but a weapon with one single point (Fig. 42), probably representing a personification of the spear {sakti or s?la). However, he cannot be identified as saktidevi who, according to the sources and on the evidence of iconographical comparison, takes on female characteristics; rather, it is to be considered a representation of s?lapurusa and functional equivalent of the tris?lapurusa. Indeed, considering the tris?la-s?la link in Saiva symbology the role of the two personages appears interchangeable. In the same cave the dv?rap?la to the right of the sanctum is - as in structure 21 - accompanied by a personage that could be identified with the vajrapurusa (Fig. 43). Typologically speaking, this sculpture exhibits features differentiating it from figure 21, the Cave 26 image being shown in a subordinate position, with legs slightly bent and crossed at ankle-height, a frown on the face, mouth half open, as if addressing the 'master' in accordance with a type often encountered in the V?k?taka and [27]</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 43 - Ellora, Cave 26. Vajrapurusa carved to the right of the sanctum. (Photo by the author). Fig. 44 - Vajrapurusa. Detail of Fig. 43. (Photo by the author). Kalacuri caves (28). Protruding from the head is a truncated pyramid motif the upper base of which shows a rounded profile (Fig. 44), much like the object (28) The position, expression and features of this personage are in fact also seen characterising other figures accompanying deities: consider, for example, the image on the corbel of the right pillar in the antechamber preceding the sanctuary in Cave 1 at Ajant? (Spink 1967a: 54, fig. 1), or the attendant of a female figure near T?r? in Cave 7 at Aurangabad (ibid.: fig. 4; S. Huntington 1989: fig. 12.30), who has his legs bent and crossed at ankle level, back stooped under the weight of the goddess resting her arm on his head. The face is mask-like, with protruding eyes, fleshy lips and pointed ears. This accompanying figure, like the personage in Cave 26 at Ellora and like others of the type, shows a calotte-style headdress with three or five small chignons, which S. Huntington (1989: 267) interprets as the five bijds of the pancajina mandala, his hands grasp the stem of a flower (?) or rather a stick. Similar features and characteristics can be seen in the image of the attendant of a Saiva dv?rap?la at Elephanta (to the left of the Mahesvara relief) (Spink 1967a: 54, figs. 2-3; Dillard Collins 1988: fig. 11) and in a figure to the left of the sanctum in Cave 14 at Ellora (Spink 1967a: 54, fig. 6). With regard to these figures Spink (ibid.: 55) noted: 'One finds many representations of aged and crippled men in the excavations of the Vak?taka and post-V?k?taka periods. Yet these deformed and withered types seem not at all out of place, for all of their being a darker backwater of Ajant?'s ideal art. Often they are specifically associated with the tall and beautiful maidens, as if they were a tangled undergrowth seeking peace and protection beneath those flowering trees. Sometimes, both at Ajant? and at later sites they hover beneath the looming and protective guardians, waiting for the inner change which a 274 [28]</page><page sequence="29">appearing on the head of the figure in Cave 21 (Fig. 35), and comparable to a half vajra (29). II.2 Eastern India: Mundesvari Further evidence for identification of the attendants to the right of the sanctum in Caves 21 and 26 with the vajrapurusa is, it seems, offered by other finds. At Mundesvari, in Bih?r, a number of Saptam?trk?* are characterised by the personified attribute. In this group, an acephalous Mahesvari seated in lalit?sana, originally showed a child sitting on her left thigh (Fig. 45) (Panikkar 1997: pi. 54). Before the seat we recognise the tris?lapurusa [ibid:. 91) - a paunchy male figure, possibly in flying position (30), with a trident protruding from his head (Fig. 46). Another female image in the same series, but better preserved, is seated in lalit?sana holding a child on her lap, resting on her left thigh (Fig. 47) (ibid.: pi. 55). At the base of the seat, to the centre, an elephant is depicted and thus identifies the main figure as Indr?ni. To the left we see a small male figure (Fig. 48) sitting with left knee raised, displaying circular earrings, a thick curly head of hair and a rhomboidal, 'spear-point' object protruding from his head, decorated with beads at the base. If the female image appearing in this sculpture is Indr?ni (in fact, the elephant is traditionally the goddess' v?hana), then the male figure sitting at the base of the seat can be identified with the vajrapurusa (ibid.: 91). As in fact we have also seen, this personage was already to be observed accompanying Indra in certain of the N?g?rjunakonda and K?nheri reliefs (Figs. 2, 4,5, 8). Thus we find repeated in the group of Saptam?trk?* from Mundesvari the same formula adopted at Ellora, personifications of the tris?la and vajra being apparently differentiated as in Cave 21. To avoid iconographical confusion with the tris?? lapurusa characterising the image of Mahesvari, the vajra is not shown here with a trident emerging from the head, as in the case of various Buddhist vajrapurusa*. The form adopted for the weapon at Mundesvari is that of the 'spear-point-like' rhomboidal object, matched in other portrayals from Bih?r and representing a reworking of the 'hourglass' vajra: consider, for example, the image of Indr?ni dating around the 6th century from Amamwa in the district of Bodh Gay? (Fig. 49) (Asher 1980: pi. 64; Panikkar 1997: fig. 56). The outline of the vajra in this and other cases Spiritual alchemy can affect. In the same way, hosts of actual devotees, burdened with pain or care, must also have to come to the caves and stood before the Buddhas in praise and expectation'. (29) This is the only feature that distinguishes the Ellora personage from similar depictions found at Aurangabad and Elephanta. (30) This particular posture is not unusual in the ?yudhapurusa images: in Cave 3 at B?d?mi, Narasimha holds in his upper hands the personification of the cakra and gada in flying position (AAB neg. 178.69). Similarly, in a relief at Melagitti Sivalaya, Visnu holds cakrapurusa and sankhapurusa depicted in the same position (AAB neg. 149.52) and, finally, the same posture characterises a tris?lapurusa held in the upper right hand of a Saiva dv?rap?la in a relief let into the wall of the northern fort at B?d?mi (AUS neg. 148.97).

(Partial reproduction from Panikkar 1997: pi. 54). shows clear derivation from the so-called Gandh?ran 'hourglass' model with pyramidal ends (Figs. 37-39), although here much flattened and in the form of a 'double spear point'. III. ICONOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS Let us now sum up the data assembled following a chronological order and making comparison between the various iconographical elements that go into the vajrapurusa image. For the caves of western Deccan we shall follow here the chronology adopted by Spink (1967, 1967a, 1978, 1983). We shall seek to demonstrate, on the one hand, the continuity of certain figurative schemes and, at the same time, the transformations taking place over time (III.l), identifying a series of typologies in portrayal of the subject (III.2) and, subsequently, looking into the significance of certain images and the reasons behind the iconographical 276 [30]</page><page sequence="31">[31] 277</page><page sequence="32">development, pointing out how changes in thinking may have influenced the role attributed to them (IIL3). Tables 1-2 and Figures 50-52 serve as back-up material to this section and for a relatively rapid understanding of the chronological development and iconographical elaborations. III. 1 History of the Image: Continuity and Transformation 1) As we saw above, the earliest images of the vajrapurusa in the role of accompaniment to Indra were found on certain panels at N?g?rju? nakonda (Figs. 1-5). As far as we know, these also constitute the first evidence of ayudhapurusa in Indian art, and the fact that they were found in a Buddhist context has raised a number of thorny problems since personification of the weapon is widely held to be a prerogative of Brahmanical iconography. In consideration of these points I have hypothesised that 'tra il II ed il IV secolo gli artisti buddhisti dei territori ?ndhra abbiano elaborato l'iconografia del vajrapurusa e che tale modello sia stato utilizzato successivamente nelTarte brahmanica per la rappresentazione di altre armi ed attributi' (Giuliano 1998: 172 ff.), but this is still a very open question. 2) The vajrapurusa image reappears after a long absence in 6th-century K?nheri Cave 90 (Fig. 8), accompanying Indra in the Indrasaila scene. Note that the K?nheri scene shows various features in common with the N?g?rjunakonda depiction of the Indrasaila episode (Fig. 4). In the first place, at K?nheri as at N?g?rjunakonda the vajra is no longer an inert object in the hands of the deity but emerges as an incarnation of Indras power, in the guise of silent onlooker symbolising the power that the deity possesses but does not use. Furthermore, the compositional structure, with the two figures on either side seated below the throne of the Buddha and the two figures standing beside the Master Fig. 49 - Indr?ni from Amamwa.

In particular, at both K?nheri and N?g?rjunakonda the images of Indra and the vajrapurusa are perfect matches: Indra is seen in three-quarter view kneeling and in anjalirnudr?, wearing a tiara that displays chequered geometrical decoration, while his attendant appears behind showing a tripartite motif on the head that takes on the form of a 'fleur-de-lis' at N?g?rjunakonda, and of a trident at K?nheri. The only difference lies in the gestural code characterising the two portrayals, the vajrapurusa being in anjalimudr? at N?g?rjunakonda, while at K?nheri the attitude is that of hasta svastika, but this discrepancy does not affect the significance of the composition since both gestural features hold the sense of veneration and worship (31). A further point to make is that the surviving texts recounting the Indrasaila episode make no (31) The sense of submission is perhaps more intensely evoked in the case of the hasta svastika.

On the evidence of various comparisons it is possible that the N?g?rjunakonda depiction represents one of the prototypes for the K?nheri scene. In fact, the analogies between the two reliefs suggest a figurative continuity in portrayal of the vajrapurusa, although we unfortunately have no intermediate documentation. At the same time, an innovative feature in the K?nheri relief is to be seen in the depiction of Pancasikha and the nymph seated to the right below the Buddha's lotus - figures that find no place in the ?ndhra panel (32). Again, at K?nheri we find contamination between the narrative in the sources and the meta-historical and symbolic level, with significant changes to the message itself: the story as evoked in a mandala context with the great central image of the Buddha on the lotus - symbol of the dharmak?ya - is transformed into a timeless, repeatable event. In fact, the religious climate is now very different from that of N?g?rjunakonda: at K?nheri a number of caves of the Traikutaka period attest to the rise of a greatly advanced Mah?y?na, evident not only in the repetition of mandala schemes like the case before us, but also in the emphasis placed on depiction of Avalokitesvara, portrayed as protector of the faithful in the Cave 90 (S. Huntington 1989: fig. 12.26) and in the ek?dasamukha form in the Cave 41 {ibid.: fig. 12.27). In some cases, moreover, the inclusion in the K?nheri repertory of female images not confined solely to the role of yaksi or n?girii, but as sakth of the bodhisattvas suggests a religious context tinted with Tantric elements. 3) Slightly later than the K?nheri vajrapurusa are those identified here as Brahmanical images of the subject, in Caves 21 and 26 at Ellora dating to the latter half of the 6th century (Figs. 32-35, 43-44). Here, in order to distinguish the personage from depiction of the tris?lapurusa the artists took the 'hourglass' model for the weapon shown on the head - a typology characteristic of the northwest regions but also occurring in other parts of the subcontinent (Figs. 37-39). This type . of vajra also reached Ellora, as attested by the portrayal of Indr?ni in the relief of the Saptam?trk?^ in Cave 22 (Fig. 40), immediately adjacent to structure 21. Thus interpretation of the attendants bearing this 'sign' on their heads as vajra personifications seems quite plausible. A point to be made here is that the images in Caves 21 and 26 distinctly and unquestionably mark an absolute novelty in the vajrapurusa iconography. In this connection it is worth noting that during the Kalacuri period - to which (32) Pancasikha is, however, portrayed in a scene above on the same panel of N?garjunakonda, which depicts an earlier stage of the same episode, namely the arrival of Indra and the gandharva in the cave (Longhurst 1938: 48-49, pi. XLIV; Rosen Stone 1994: fig. 218). 282 [36]</page><page sequence="37">construction of Caves 21 and 26 is attributed - the ?yudhapurusa figure occurs fairly frequently, various attendants of deities and dv?rap?las taking on this form. Apart from the tris?lapurusa and s?lapurusa of Ellora considered above (Figs. 28-31, 41-42), we might take as examples the tris?lapurusa of Jogesvari (Spink 1978: fig. 9), the saktidevis of Elephanta (Doniger OTlaherty, Michell &amp; Berkson 1983: pi. 14; Dillard Collins 1988: fig. 16) and Mandapeswar, and various images that despite poor conservation can be identified as ?yudhapurusa. Indeed, certain ?yudhapurusa typologies were in fact developed during the Kalacuri period, reappearing in the C?lukya, Pallava and P?ndya temples (33), while other personifications not clearly identifiable remain a unicum in Indian art (34). It is therefore probable that this was a period of experimentation for the iconography of the personified weapons - a time of transition that saw new figurative types emerging and the creation of what we might term a fluid iconography, showing occasional moments of indecision. It is in terms of experimentation that we may account for the differences between the two vajrapurusas in structures 21 and 26, which have in common the truncated pyramid element, i.e. the half vajra surmounting the head. The personage in Cave 21 is depicted as a paunchy dwarf with arms in hasta svastika, while the type in Cave 26 has the appearance of an old cripple, bowed under the weight of the dv?rap?la in accordance with an iconography recurrent in the V?k?taka and Kalacuri periods. In both cases, however, the personage is portrayed with deformed features, which might have some particular significance now unknown to us. We have already pointed out that identification of these figures with the vajrapurusa appears to find confirmation in the Mundesvari Indr?ni (Figs. 47-48), in Bih?r, belonging to a group of Saptam?trk?i- and accompanied by a personification of the vajra similar to the Ellora types. Here, too, the personage bears on the head a 'spear-point' vajra - a reworking of the 'hourglass' vajra - differentiating him from the tris?lapurusa accompanying Mahesvari in the same series (Figs. 45-46), and this depiction may well have been indirectly influenced by the Ellora images. 4) The fact that the ?yudhapurusa iconography was extremely vague and fluid in the Kalacuri period is further demonstrated by portrayal of Vajrap?ni's attendant in Cave 6 at Aurangabad (Figs. 22-24) of the latter half of 6th century, a personage with (33) Here I am referring in particular to the personage exhibiting a weapon with one point on the top of his head, probably personifying the spear which, given its masculine features, is interpreted here as s?lapurusa (p. [27]). This type is depicted, for example, in Cave 26 at Ellora (Figs. 41-42) and reappears in the guise of dv?rap?la in various temples in Pattadakkal (see for example Clark Chatham 1981: fig. 180) and in many caves in southern India (Sivaramamurti 1961: pi. 31; Srinivasan 1964: pi. XXVc). (34) Consider, for example, the enigmatic image showing a mushroom-like object protruding from his head, portrayed to the right at the entrance to the sanctum in the east wing of the sanctuary at Elephanta (Doniger OTlaherty, Michell &amp; Berkson 1983: pi. 11; Dillard Collins 1988: fig. 83).

It is interesting to see how the typologies devised in the Kalacuri period recur and find confirmation in finds in the eastern regions: in fact, like the vajrapurusa depictions in the Brahmanical caves of Ellora, the Aurangabad image finds matches in some later depictions of the figure from Bih?r (Figs. 25-27). Here, too, characterised by the attribute, the bodhisattva Vajrap?ni continues to be accompanied by a personage taking the distinct form of a krodha, who can be considered an 'iconographical residue' of the ?yudhapurusa. 5) A little later than the images of the attendant at Aurangabad and of the Brahmanical vajrapurusa in Ellora structures 21 and 26 are the vajra personifications found in the Buddhist caves of Ellora, including the ones in Caves 6 and 2 dating to the 7th century (Figs. 9-12), with tripartite vajra on the head (as in the N?g?rjunakonda and K?nheri examples), in hasta svastika (as at K?nheri and in Cave 21 at Ellora), and postured on the attack (as in Cave 6 at Aurangabad). It should be noted that the same iconographical bodhisattva/vajrapurusa scheme found in these caves at Ellora recurs in a series of Nepalese depictions contemporary with or just slightly later than the images we have been considering so far, and which we have dealt with elsewhere (Giuliano 1998: 163-66) (35), including the sculpture of the Dhvaka Bahal from Kathmandu of the 7th century (Fig. 18) (Slusser 1982, II: fig. 276; Krishna Deva 1984: pi. 10L4; Bhattacharya 1995-96: 332; Giuliano 1998: fig. 11), the two 8th-century bronzes in the Los Angeles County Museum (Figs. 19-20) (Kramrish 1964: fig. 7; Pal 1974: fig. 202; 1985: fig. S6; Slusser 1982, II: fig. 464; Bhattacharya 1995-96: fig. 7; Giuliano 1998: figs. 12-13) and the 11th-century bronze in the Doris Wiener Gallery (Fig. 21) (Slusser 1982, II: fig. 471; Giuliano 1998: fig. 14). These images show surprising figurative affinities with depictions of the subject in the Buddhist western caves (36), and in particular the position of the arms in hasta svastika and the presence of the trident protruding from the head, enhanced in some cases with elements possibly taken up from the iconography of eastern India. 6) At Ellora the last depiction of the subject appears in the latter half of the 7th century in Cave 10 (Figs. 13-14). This image had previously been interpreted as an unusual form of Vajrap?ni, but viewed in relation with the vajrapurusa iconography it reveals its true identity. In fact, the depiction shows various features in common with the earlier vajrapurusa images, namely the tripartite vajra on the head (like the vajrapurusa of N?g?rjunakonda, K?nheri and Ellora 2 and 6), curly head of hair (as in the examples at N?g?rjunakonda, K?nheri and Ellora 6) and the circular earrings (35) See also Slusser 1982,1: 284; Pal 1985: 90; Bhattacharya 1995-96: 326, 331-33, 337. (36) On the iconographical similarities between the art of central India and Nepalese art, see Brancaccio 1995: 190, n. 185. [41] 287</page><page sequence="42">(K?nheri, Ellora 2 and 6). However, it also exhibits some new iconographical features (multiplication of arms, nimbus, serpent round the neck) and unlike the previous images it does not appear in a position of subordination or accompanied by any bodhisattva. The depiction as a whole, including the nimbus, suggests divinisation of the subject: this possibility finds confirmation in the find of a number of Nepalese bronzes that, apart from the multiplication of arms, display similar figurative characteristics and which were indeed probably actual cult objects (Figs. 15-17). It is therefore possible that in caityagrha 10 at Ellora a new vajrapurusa iconography was coined which retained the characteristics of the earlier image - and in the first place the weapon on top of the head - while introducing new elements, namely the nimbus and serpent, which recur in Nepalese depictions of the subject. III.2 The Figurative Models From the typological point of view, on the basis of the data so far assembled we can single out four distinct iconographical models for depiction of the vajrapurusa, in some cases applied during the same period. a) The image coined at N?g?rjunakonda, with tripartite vajra on the head (Figs. 1-5), recurs with a series of variations through to the late period, and we can follow the route it took from K?nheri (Cave 90, Fig. 8) to Ellora (Caves 2 and 6, Figs. 9-12) and on to Nepal (Figs. 18-21). The iconographical variations occurring within this typology attest to a development in the concept of the vajrapurusa which we shall be considering later in this paper. From the Kalacuri phase, on the other hand, we find two different figurative trends developing in depiction of the subject which initially appear as a form of experimentation and go on to follow their own evolutionary path, as the finds in Bih?r appear to demonstrate: h) the Brahmanical vajrapurusa, which also finds confirmation in the Hindu textual tradition (see below), found at Ellora in Caves 21 and 26 (Figs. 32-35, 43-44) and at Mundesvari (Figs. 47-48), and c) a particular type of Buddhist vajrapurusa, without the customary attributes but identifiable on the basis of comparison with other images of the same subject, depicted in Aurangabad Cave 6 (Figs. 22-24) and, a little later, in Bih?r (Figs. 25-27). Finally, to these models we must add d) the isolated vajrapurusa type, first depicted at Ellora (Figs. 13-14) in a Tantric environment and frequently recurring in Nepal (Figs. 15-17). If, therefore, to our knowledge, N?g?rjunakonda stands as the point where this figurative type originated, the surviving evidence points to a fundamental role for western Deccan in the elaboration and dissemination of the concept. Certain vajrapurusa iconographies were coined in these areas to reappear, reworked, in the eastern territories of the subcontinent and Nepal. Curiously enough, the route 288 [42]</page><page sequence="43">followed by the image from western Deccan to the eastern regions coincides with the path taken by certain Mah?y?na texts during the same period. For example, it is significant that the Vairocanabhisambodhi tantra - a text better known in Sino Japanese tradition as the Mah?vairocana s?tra and considered a sort of iconographical manual which the artists of the Buddhist caves of K?nheri, Aurangabad and Ellora in all likelihood referred to when devising certain iconographies - was, according to Wayman (1992: 8-15), written during the mid-6th century in Mah?r?stra by a Brahman converted to Buddhism, and only subsequently reached the eastern regions of the subcontinent, and in particular Orissa. III.3 The Image and Its Meanings: An Interpretation As these iconographical models go through the various forms of elaboration, we find a line of thought developing through various artistic currents in India, originating from N?g?rjunakonda. No longer an inert object in the hands of the deity, here the vajra is revealed as the incarnation of Indra's power, and in the guise of silent onlooker symbolises the power that the deity possesses but does not use. This concept is also reflected in the reliefs of K?nheri and certain Nepalese sculptures. Again, the Brahmanical depictions of the vajrapurusa, while departing from the Buddhist figurative tradition, seeking to avoid iconographical confusion with the by then established model of the tris?lapurusa, can neverthless be conceptually related with certain N?g?rjunakonda and K?nheri types, being shown in attitudes not of aggression but rather of submission to the deity whose retinue they form, manifesting the creative and combative energy of the 'master', ever present but as yet unused. In this connection let us make a brief digression in an attempt to clarify the presence of the vajrapurusa in a Saiva structure, as in the case of Caves 21 and 26 at Ellora. To begin with, let us recall that this figure takes theorised form in the texts of precisely this religious tradition, and in particular in those belonging to the Saiva Siddh?nta line, like the P?rvak?ran?gama and the Uttarak?mik?gama, and that the vajra as object of veneration is numbered among the weapons of &amp;iva in the Suprabhed?gama (kriy?p?da 22, w. 169-185, see p. [47]) and of Mahesa in the Siva Pur?na (VII, 30, 65-68), a passage here each of the deity's attributes is assigned a particular place in the temple (see p. [47]). As for the vajra, it had been among the arms attributed to Rudra-Siva since the Vedic period, when the association of Rudra with Indra took shape. Rudra bears the Indraic epithet sahasr?ksa, 'of the thousand eyes' (AV XI, 2, 3; 2, 7; VS XVI, 7; AVS XI, 23, 7-17; TS IV, 5, 5; $B IX, 1, 1, 6), and in the prayer addressed to Bhava and Sarva is identified with the slayer of Vrtra (AV IV, 28, 3) (37). Like Indra, he is also called hiranyab?hu, 'golden armed' (TS IV, 5, 2a), and frequently appears associated (37) 'sahasr?ksau vrtrahan? huveham duregavyuti stuvannemyugrau / yavasyes?the dvipado yau catuspadastau no muncatamamhasah'. [43] 289</page><page sequence="44">with the Maruty, deities connected with storms (38): Rudra is their father (RV I, 114, 6 9; II, 33, 1) and the Marutr, also called Rudrai or Rudriyai", are considered his sons (Macdonell 1897: 74). In some passages, moreover, the deity is called vajrabahu (RV II, 33, 2-4) or attributed with vidyut (AV X, 1, 23; XI, 2, 12); in Rg Veda VII, 46,?3 his thunderbolt (didyut) 'discharged from the sky traverses the earth [...]', while the Satarudriya relates how homage was paid 'to him of the lightning' {namo vidyuty?ya). The Siva-Indra connection is also well documented in the epic period (Doniger O'Flaherty 1973: 85-89), and the vajra again finds mention on various occasions among the weapons of Siva (SP VII, 32, 20; Mbh, Anus?sana Parva, 14, 382), who occasionally bestows it on other personages (MP CXXXV, 55 ff). From the figurative point of view, moreover, the weapon had been among Siva's attributes since the Kus?na period. The deity is shown wielding the object in Kaniska and Huviska coin images, and in other sculptural depictions of Siva in Gandh?ran production (39). In these cases the attribute is shown in the Gandh?ran 'hourglass' or in the 'double trident' vajra styles indifferently (40). Thus we see a literary and artistic tradition attesting to the presence of the vajra and its personification in the field of Saiva symbology. The same object was subsequently to become one of the most frequent attributes of Subrahmanya in the images of southern India (Rao 1914-16, II: 424-50; L'Hernault 1978: 142-59) (41) through assimilation of Skanda and Indra (42). (38) The Marut? have as attribute vidyut (lightning) (RV I, 64, 5; V, 54, 2; 3, 11; VIII, 7, 25) and on occasion wield the vajra (RV VIII, 7, 32). (39) See for example the image of Siva from Akhun Deri (Aiyar 1913-14: pi. LXXILz; Rosenfield 1967: fig. 84), the image presented by Kurita (1989-90, II: 180), conserved in a private collection, and the figurine from Kuhah (Invernizzi 1968-69: 145-48; Taddei 1972: pi. I). (40) It is probable that in the hands of Siva the attribute is intended to show the close links the divinity has with Indra or his functions, which are also borne out by the early textual references: the vajra, as thunderbolt, is the weapon hurled at Vrtra to bring about his death and consequent liberation from the imprisoning waters in the hollow of the mountain (RV V, 1.32). The myth is cosmogonic since the slaying of an ophidian monster - symbolising chaos, the virtual and the inert - produces conditions for the creation of a new order in the universe. Applying this symbol to the structure of the microcosm, Vrtra appears as the symbol of man's lower nature, the p?sa or the link binding him to phenomenal reality, and is emblem of the chaos unleashed by the passions, of the subconscious inert. Siva, identified in various passages with the slayer of Vrtra (AVIV, 28.3), flings the vajra representing his power to imbue the devotee with his energy; breaking the chains of ignorance and unbinding the p?su from its yoke, he frees the true nature of the human being. (41) Note that in Mah?bh?rata IX, 46, 84 Skanda 'pierced Mt. Kraunca and split it with the dart given him by Agni (but ibidem 44 given by Indra) because Bana had sought refuge in that mountain. All were destroyed by the lightning flashes of the great javelin (a saktyastra "very bright and noisy, adorned with bells")' (transl. by Hopkins 1915: 228). In the epic tale the weapon is a spear, but the story undeniably shows marked analogies with the myth of Indra breaking open the mountain where Vrtra is hidden and with the Buddhist legend of Apal?la, where it is the Vajrap?ni that hurls the vajra, shattering the rocks. (42) In southern India, the connection between the two deities is also evidenced by the portrayals of Subrahmanya on the elephant: see, for example, the central figure on the east side of the Arjunaratha at M?mallapuram, the east niche in the tower of the 10th-century temple of Tiruvallam, the east niche in the 9th-century central temple of Kotumpalur, etc. (L'Hernault 1978: 141-42). 290 [44]</page><page sequence="45">Let us, however, return to interpretative analysis of the vajrapurusa images so far encountered. As we have seen, it was N?g?rjunakonda that saw the origins of the concept of personification of the vajra, representing a projection of the deity's power, although presented in an attitude of silent submission - an idea subsequendy taken up at K?nheri, in the Brahmanical caves of Ellora and in certain Nepalese images. In a different way Aurangabad and the Buddhist caves of Ellora saw the rise of a new concept that was to reach as far as Bih?r. In this case, the vajrapurusa is still shown in submission to the 'master' {hasta svastikd), but on the point of flying at the enemies of dharma (?tidh?sana or praty?tidh?sana) and thus capable of acting independendy in defence of Sacredness, ever attuned to the divine will. Significantly, a number of these images are of the wrathful type, taking on a krodha appearance. In this connection the passage conserved in the Shntiparvan of the Mah?bh?rata (XII, 31,27-28) is highly indicative: coday?m ?sa vajram sa divy?stram m?rtisamsthitam/ vy?ghro bh?tv? jahimam tvam r?jap?tram iti prabho// vivrddhah kila viryena m?m eso'bhibhavisyati/ srnjayasya suto vajra yathainam parvato dadau// 'He (Indra) spurred on the vajra, divine weapon in embodied shape: "Having become a tiger kill this prince, oh powerful one! This son of Srnjaya, in truth, grown, in virtue of his strength, will prevail over me oh vajra!" Which he was told by Parvata'. Here there is some emphasis on the elements also seen in the visual depictions: the deity does not act in person but sends the personification of the vajra, which acts according to his will and takes on the appearance of a tiger - a fearsome semblance - to symbolise the awful destructive might of the weapon. Following this conceptual line we finally arrive, in the Tantric context, at the identification of the personified vajra with a divine force, and the elevation of this personality to an object of cult. In fact, the nimbus characterising some of the images demonstrates that the personified weapon no longer has the simple function of an accompanying figure, but takes on a role of his own in the Buddhist pantheon. This transformation first appears at Ellora in Cave 10 (Figs. 13-14), to recur more frequently in Nepalese territory as from the 9th century. With the divinisation of this figure emerges the Tantric nature of the cult practised at Ellora (43). According to this doctrine the elements of reality represent a (43) The architectural structure and iconographical repertory of the Buddhist caves of Ellora, which Spink (1967b: 22) considers to have been almost certainly sponsored by a dynasty of local feudatories during the C?lukya period in the 7th century, suggest a deep-reaching change in the doctrine and different liturgical requirements. The presence of new bodhisattva^ and female divinities, and the final affirmation of the mandala scheme found in the sculptural diagrams, in compositions with the Buddhas and bodhisattvaj portrayed in the cells, together with the many-armed images taken up from Brahmanical depictions, all go to reveal a symbolic universe thoroughly renewed since the times when, for example, the artists of Ajant? were at work. [45] 291</page><page sequence="46">projection or manifestation of the Absolute, and can thus be considered symbols of the various levels of fulfilment of the Truth - signs on the path leading from multiplicity to the One. In this phase, therefore, we see a 'personificazione dei vari moti e potenze dell'anima in altrettante forze divine espressione dell'ultima realt?, offuscatrici e liberatrici ad un punto' (Gnoli 1983: 29-30). The vajra is an 'arm of knowledge' (jn?n?yudha) (44), a spiritual weapon that breaks down 'the mountain of perverse ideas' - that obstacle consisting in the philosophical view asserting the substantiality of the self {satk?yadrsti) (45) or, at a more psychological level, that profound sense beings have of existing as individuals - and in short a liberating force for the psyche able to transform inclinations and bring about a 'conversion'. Ultimately, it indicates the lightning-like, intuitive value of knowledge itself, with which it is fully identified. In this context the vajrapurusa thus manifests itself not simply in the role of attendant - an extension of the bodhisattva's offensive/defensive energy - but as personification of a power of the soul acting autonomously, penetrating reality and transforming its structure as a thunderbolt does. This modification of the vajrapurusa concept that finds its first manifestation, we believe, in caityagrha 10 at Ellora, and subsequent confirmation in the Nepalese finds (Figs. 15-17), has once again a parallel in the Brahmanical texts. As we have seen, personification of the vajra and other weapons is theorised in various Brahmanical texts, but what seems particularly relevant here is that even very early works bear occasional evidence of the cult attributed to this personage. As early as the Grhya s?tra of Gobhila (IV, 4, 26-29) we read that to ensure a good harvest, sacrifice must be made to various deities including As?ni, which is one of the names of Agni, and can also be interpreted as personification of the thunderbolt (46). In the text As?ni is associated with other personages, but not in a subordinate position, which suggests he had a role of his own: (44) See The J?taka (Fausboll, ed., 1887, I: 274) and the Lalitavistara (Vaidya, ed., 1958, II: 7; IV: 19,27). (45) In this connection, we find in a text as early as the Divy?vad?na: 'tasya bhagavat?say?musayam dh?tum prakrtim ca jn?tv? t?drsi catur?ryasatyasampratiyedhaki dharmadesan? krt? y?m srutv? tay? devatay? vimsatisikharasamudgatam satk?yadrstisailam jn?navajrena bhittv? srot?pattiphalam s?ks?tkrtam' (Cowell &amp; Neil, eds., 1886: 46). 'Bhagavat connaissant l'esprit, les dispositions, le caractere et le naturel de cette Divinite, exposa l'enseignement de la Loi fait pour donner Tintelligence des quatre verites sublimes, de teile sorte que cette Divinite, aussitot qu'elle l'eut entendu, fendant avec la foudre de la science la montagne d'o? Ton croit voir que c'est le corps qui existe, montagne qui s'eleve avec vingt s?mmets, vit face ? face la recompense de Tetat de Crota ?pattf (Burnouf 1876: 235). See also The Divy?vad?na (Cowell &amp; Neil, eds., 1886: 52,549). (46) Agni has a three-fold nature, appearing as fire in the earthly world, as lightning {as?ni) in the intermediate world and as the sun in the celestial world. With regard to the links between vajra and as?ni, it is worth recalling that the two terms often appear as synonyms in Vedic literature (Benveniste &amp; Renou 1934: 128) and in the Buddhist texts (Giuliano 1997: 50-52). 292 [46]</page><page sequence="47">ath?to hal?bhiyogah/ punye naksatre sth?lip?k srapayitvait?bhyo devat?bhyo juhuy?t indr?ya marudbhyah parjjany?y?sanyai bhag?ya// sit?m?s?marad?managh?nja yajate/ et? eva devat?h sit?yajnakhalayajnapravapanapralavana partyayanesu// 'Now then the first use of the plough (during the year).

These very deities (are to be worshipped) at the plough-field-sacrifice, at the stacking-treshing field sacrifice, at the sowing, at the reguing of the crop, at the removal of the corn to the store-house'. (Transl. by Vanamali Vedantatirtha 1940: 132-33). Divinisation of the vajra is also evoked in Brhaddevat? I, 84-85: visve ca dev?h savit? tvast? vai r?pakrnmatah/ asvo'nnam rtvijo vajro gr?v?no rathasamyut?h // stut?h prthak prthak svaih svaih s?ktair rgbhis ca n?mabhih/ [...] The All-gods, Savitn, Tvastr (who is) regarded as the fashioner of forms, the Steed, Food, Priests, the Bolt, the Pressing-stones, (all these deities) furnished with cars, are praised separetely in their various hymns and stanzas by their names [...]'. (Transl. by Macdonell 1904, II: 18-19). Again, a passage in the Siva Pur?na (VII, 30, 65-68) describing a point in the k?mya rites prescribes worship of the weapons of Mahesa (including the vajra), installed in the various directions of space: evam caturth?varanam p?jayitv? vidh?natah// ?yudh?ni mahesasya pasc?d v?hyam samarcayet// srimattris?lam ais?ne vajram m?hendradihmukhe// parasum vahnidigbh?ge y?mye s?yakam arcayet// nairrte tu yajet khadgam p?sam v?runagocare// ankusam m?rute bh?ge pin?kam cottare yajet// pascim?bhimuldiam raudram ksetrap?lam samarcayet// After worshipping the fourth Avarana in accordance with the injunctions he shall worship the weapons of Mahesa externally. He shall worship the glorious trident in the north-east, thunderbolt in the east, axe in the south-east, and the arrow in the south, the sword in the south-west, the noose in the west, the goad, in the north? west, the Pin?ka in the north, Ksetrap?la in the west'. (Transl. by a Board of Scholars: part IV, 2031). The personified vajra is also repeatedly referred to as an object of veneration in the Suprabhed?gama, a text belonging to the Saiva Siddh?nta tradition: in the kriy?p?da 22, w. 169-185, it features among the ten weapons of Sadasiva that are venerated one by one during the religious ceremonies (47), and a little later in the (47) These weapons must be made in one tola measure and must be mounted on attendant (bh?ta) for being worshipped separately on all auspicious occasions, and in festivals and for being carried about' (S.K. Ramachandra Rao 1977, III: 97). [47] 293</page><page sequence="48">same text (w. 195-196) the vajra in anthropomorphic form is included in the list of the weapons of lokap?las, and considered an object of cult (48). Furthermore, it is interesting to see how the isolated vajrapurusa image found in the Buddhist environment not only receives confirmation in various Hindu texts but is also matched in the Brahmanical context by depictions of the cakrapurusa and tris?lapurusa, respectively personifications of Visnu's cakra and Siva's tris?la, as isolated cult object. Indeed we have evidence of depiction of the cakrapurusa not associated with statues of Visnu as early as the Gupta period. Often sculpted on two faces and raised to the tops of pillars, these images had not however taken on a completely independent role in the period, but rather served as heraldic emblems or religious symbols in the vicinity of temples dedicated to Visnu (49). The practice of depicting the cakrapurusa as an isolated subject reached its culmination in eastern India (Bengal, Bih?r) around the 8th-9th century (50), and then in southern India in the 11th century (Begley 1973: 65-92, figs. 45-80; Mani 1985: 17-22, figs. 9-22). In these places Sudarsana rises to the role of an independent deity as hypostasis of the power (sakti) of Visnu, a point that finds confirmation not only in the iconographical complications characterising his image, but also in various literary passages and hymns so dedicated, like the passage recited by the demon Bali in V?mana Pur?na LXVII, 6-19 (Begley 1973: 29-30; Mani 1985: 5), or the famous Sodas?yudhastotram attributed to Ved?ntadesika (Begley 1973: 30-32; Mani 1985: 17-18). Moreover, the existence of a tantric cult dedicated to Sudarsana had already been evidenced in (48) 'The weapons carried by the ten guardians of direction (lokap?las) are also worshipped: vajra, sakti, cudgel (danda), sword (khadga), noose (p?sa), goad (ankusa), mace (gada), trident (tris?la), discus (cakra) and lotus (padma) (to [...] Indra and others, beginning with East and proceeding clockwise). Among these, sakti alone is feminine in form, and all others masculine. They are shown in human form, well-decorated and with hands joined in supplication. They stands on lotuses and carry the respective weapons on their heads' (S.K. Ramachandra Rao 1977, III: 97). (49) We might consider, for example, the 5th-century image from Pawaya, now in the Gwalior Museum (Begley 1973: 46, fig. 12), the image on the pillar at Eran (484-485 A.D.) (ibid.: 47, fig. 13), also interpreted as Garuda (Harle 1974: 12, fig. 23; S. Huntington 1989: 195, fig. 10.13), the 6th century image from Salar in West Bengal (Begley 1973: 45, fig. 10), and the 7th-8th-century image in the Basheshar Mah?dev Temple at Bajaura in Himachal Pradesh (ibid.: 46, fig. 11). (50) See, for example, the cakrapurusa from Maharawan in the district of Gay? (Bih?r), now in the Museum of Patna, dating to the 8th-9th century (AUS neg. 287.10) (Kalidos 1990), and the 9th-century portrayal of Sudarsana dancing, sculpted on two sides, from Marni, in the district of Nawadah (Bih?r) (AUS neg. 297.18). See also the many-armed images from Sharishadaha, in the district of Parganas (West Bengal), dating to the llth-12th century, now in the Asutosh Museum of Calcutta (Begley 1973: 62, fig. 43) and from Deulberia, in the district of Bankura (West Bengal), also dating to the llth-12th century (ibid.: 63, fig. 44). In contrast, arguing against identification of these images with the cakrapurusa, Kalidos (1990: 336) holds that the cult of Cakrattalvar 'was a later development confined to Tamil Nadu'. This author focuses attention in particular on the example from Maharawan, which he identifies as a rare image of &amp;va Natar?ja (ibid.: 338). 294 [48]</page><page sequence="49">Garuda Pur?na XXXIII, 4,5 while various references to rituals dedicated to the personage can be found in the Pancaratra literature: for example, the Ahirbudhnya Samhit? is framed around a dialogue on the rituals connected with the cult of Sudarsana consisting in yoga practices, p?j?, the repetition of mantras over his image and on the esoteric interpretations of the cakra, identified with Visnu's kriy?-sakti. The cakra is further interpreted as a symbol of Visnu's will-to-be' (sy?m iti samkalpd), which is identical to his kriy?-sakti, defined as the creative feminine principle of Tantrism, and personified as Laksmi, the consort of Visnu. Laksmi and Sudarsana both represent the active side of Visnu's transcendental nature, which functions independently of him. Since Sudarsana is totally independent, his power is, therefore 'natural (s?msiddhika) and not created'. The creative power of Sudarsana is characterized as will (icch?) embodied in wisdom (preks?) and resulting in action (kriy?Y [...] It is apparent that, theoretically at least, Sudarsana was regarded as an independent deity and not merely a subordinate agent of Visnu's destructive power. This view is substantiated by the evidence in the Samhit? for the existence of a hhakti cult centered on Sudarsana, who, according to the text, is equal in importance to Laksmi, the speculatively all-powerful sakti of the deity. (Begley 1973:28-29). Thus a complex speculative reflection developed in both Buddhist and Brahmanical environments, elaborating the theme of the ?yudhapurusa and divinising this figure, to be invoked or worshipped individually whenever the intervention of this specific power is deemed necessary, possibly also through the repetition of a mantra to evoke it. Elaboration of this concept and the consequent figurative development, with representation of the isolated ?yudhapurusa characterised by attributes clearly indicating his divine nature, thus becomes a common factor in the two traditions, which in turn confirms - if indeed there be any need - the existence of one religious background, shared and continually drawn upon, and of intercommunication leading - in some cases - to converging choices. Such are the initial findings of a wide-ranging study on the vajrapurusa still in progress, and which we intend to continue. From the iconographical point of view, it would be interesting to dedicate greater attention to the artistic and cultural relations working back and forth between western Deccan, eastern India and Nepal, extending research to areas in southern India since certain figurative features of western Deccan seem to have influenced the art of the C?lukya, Pallava and P?ndya. We also believe there is a need to delve deeper into the texts, and especially the Buddhist texts, in our attempts to resolve the contradiction between iconographical and textual material. In fact we have seen in various connections how theorisation of the vajrapurusa features in Brahmanical works, although figurative application of the 'invoking [...] the deity of gentle form, adorned with a crown and holding conch- shell, discus, club and lotus, in the mystic diagram he [the devotee] should worship him' (Dutt 1968: 81, quoted by Begley 1973: 25 and Mani 1985: 6). [49] 295</page><page sequence="50">norm has been observed mainly in Buddhist contexts. There may, however, also be some references to the idea in works associated with the Buddhist tradition, and in particular in the Tantric tradition, but in all probability the personification of the vajrapurusa is given no particular designation affording immediate identification in this context. This and other related problems we shall be addressing in the future, trusting that in the meantime the fruits our research has yielded so far may prompt further discussion on the subject.
