AUGUST 4, 1921 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY GENETICISM AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE IN PSYCHOLOGY1 A TTENTION was called in 1914 by Professor Cohen2 to the errors inherent in the use of the historical methods of explanation commonly employed in certain fields of inquiry. To him there appear to be in the popular philosophy of the day two more or less axiomatic principles. One is that nothing is explicable except in terms of its history; the other is that value is independent of history. These two principles, though dwelling to- gether in modern thought in apparent peace, are essentially antagonistic. They are indeed the lineal descendants of the ancient feudists, the rationalists and the empiricists. The use of the histori- cal method rests as a heuristic principle upon an assumption which is essentially rationalistic, its fundamental dogma being that the past completely determines the present. This seems true in spite of the fact that the method arose in part at least as a protest against rationalism. Spencer, whose philosophy is a wholesale applica- tion of the historical method, calls attention3 to the disposition of his time to make use of it in lieu of the current doctrines of creationism. Although Cohen proposes to concern himself with mental sciences he leaves psychology out of account, taking up in order Economics, Jurisprudence, Politics, Ethics, Religion and Philoso- phy, pointing out the errors that arise from the exclusive depend- ence on historical methods in these several fields. To "subordinate economic science to economic history," for example, has turned out to be misleading. It has resulted in a movement, under the leader- ship of Carl BUcher, back to psychology and anthropology. In jurisprudence the revolt of Eichhorn and Savigny from older methods and their emphasis on the supreme importance of history has in turn led to an even graver danger. It has been, in Cohen's opinion, a " positive hindrance to any improvement or enlargement of the law-precisely because those who think of new problems ex- clusively in terms of historical analogies get tangled up in their own traces and think that what has been must remain forever."

In religion historicism has had an important effect. But even here, where tradition means much, while the orthodox are tracing out apostolic succession, etc., the heterodox are carrying us back to phallic worship and the life of primitive man. So that we are confused to know in terms of which group we are to make our judgments. In philosophy Cohen holds that historicism breaks down since that subject is not a branch of archeology, and since the truth of a philosophic doctrine does not rest upon historical sequence. Many of the great constructive minds in philosophy have been unacquainted with their predeces- sors, so that it would be impossible to say that the past in this field determines the present. It seems to have escaped Cohen's notice that there are in psy- chology, as he says concerning these other sciences, " brave souls who have taken the historical faith quite seriously and have actually attempted to make the historical point of view replace or supersede all independent method or standpoint of evaluation." The purpose of the present paper is to extend his criticism to psychology and to show certain seemingly erroneous implications in its use in this field. We have had no end of controversy concerning the validity of introspectionism and behaviorism, but it seems that the valid- ity of historicism as a method of psychological inquiry has been taken more or less for granted. The doctrine of recapitulation, to be sure, has been successfully called in question, but while reca- pitulation may be considered an outgrowth of historicism the two con- ceptions are distinct. Historicism in psychology is better known as geneticism. Pro- fessor Baldwin in his Dictionary defines the genetic method as " the explanation of things, for purpose of instruction, according to their genesis or manner of coming into being." D. J. Hill4 says, " The genetic method, then, consists in referring every fact to its place in the series to which it belongs. An alleged fact is entirely meaning- less until it is restored to its serial relation. When thus restored, it is seen to be a part of the real order, the outgrowth of its own antecedents, and it is thus unified with other facts as part of a con- tinuous whole." Although frequent use is made of geneticism by psychologists of all schools, no one has championed the method itself as has Dr. G. Stanley Hall. Because of his acknowledged leadership in this field 4 Genetic Philosophy, p. 14.</page><page sequence="3">GENETICISM AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE 423 it seemed fair to illustrate the use of the method by reference to certain of his well known writings. The gist of his position is to be found in a monograph,5 the title of which is " A Glance at the Phyletic Background of Genetic Psychology." At the outset he asserts the reality of time as a sort of fundamental principle from which the genetic method must proceed, thus falling perhaps uncon- sciously into rationalistic usages, from which, as we have seen, the genetic method in general was supposed to have revolted. Be that as it may, the psychologists, he says, who would undertake to ex- plain mental reactions in terms of what goes on in the laboratory are intellectually myopic. As well might a geologist attempt to un- derstand the fossils and strata of the earth by mere chemical analy- sis of them. The psychologists must adopt the geologist's method, and acquire some of his time sense. There are layers, strata, "pubic beaches," and the like in the mind of man, which can only thus be made intelligible. The genetic inquiry is not only pushed indefinitely backward in time but also downward, if we may so say, in the direction of the inanimate. The performances of radium, cyanogen, carbon, etc., are reviewed in connection with a search, that is almost pre-Socratic in intent, for a materia prima. The behavior of metals under torsion, their fatigue, and recuperation are suggestive of vital processes. The action of crystals and foams shows the possibility of com- pleting the genetic series, leaving no gap from top to bottom, if such a scheme of things may be said to have a top and a bottom. Matter in the genetic system must, of course, contain the promise and po- tency of all things. Hall thinks that " The secrets of the origin of soul are now more and more clearly seen to be bound up, if not identical, with those of the origin of life, and the beginnings of both stretch back ever farther in time and down the scale of simpli- city so that their primordial germs must be coeval with the dawn of matter and with time itself. Although, as we know them in their present forms, they seem incommensurably different from the life of the physical universe, they are, in fact, products of an evolu- tion that has proceeded by insensible gradations with no rupture of identity " (Italics mine)." He further says that his own experiments with certain plants have convinced him that they show " a behavior that can hardly be entirely excluded from Psychology. 7 Thus " the unity between plants and animals is fundamental and detailed, and just so far as psychology becomes a natural genetic science it will trace all 5 tAmerican Journal of Psychology, Vol. XIX, 1908, 149-212. eIbid., p. 168. 7 Ibid., p. 186.</page><page sequence="4">424 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY higher powers back to those we have in common with plants and the simplest animal forms, and vice versa, derive all the former from the latter. "8 The genesis of consciousness and its place in the genetic series brings out this suggestion, whatever it may mean, which serves at least as an attempt to bridge a famous chasm: "What we call con- ciousness is derivable from the suddenness of the biometamorphosis with which new balances are attained and to the more complex and manifold changes that this involves in higher organisms which are susceptible to shock in a different way." It seems not only justi- fiable but necessary to bridge this chasm in the genetic series by some means, by a figure of speech a la Santayana, if by nothing else. Hall prefers " to defy the current horror of anthropomorphism and to show a decent respect to continuity." " Only to speculative and monodeistic minds," says he, " can the question between some psychic rudiment and tropism be so put that we must cleave to the one and despise the other." This situation again illustrates the ra- tionalism of the genetic method. In facing such gaps as these in the genetic series it is interest- ing to note that the geneticist apparently cleaves to his conception of the continuity of things and despises the evidences for any rupture of identity even to the extent of accusing those who have respect for such evidences of being " speculative," or wedded to a system. The logical upshot of geneticism must necessarily be that all vital phenomena are ultimately explicable in terms of mechanical laws. In fact, unless there is an "unruptured identity" throughout the genetic series the method is valueless, for otherwise, in tracing our phenomenon backward in time for purposes of explanation, it would disappear in our grasp. Hall at least does not shrink from the logical consequences of this necessity. He holds9 that " one day physiology, if not psychology itself, may be expressible in chemical formulae." This notion of continuity is found not only in genetic psychol- ogy but in the literature of psychology in general in the form of the ancient doctrine of essences, of things in themselves. The older ter- minology has been changed, but the idea may be found intact in the frequent statements in which mental processes, functions, etc., are described as being " at bottom " so and so. " At bottom " may without violence to the intended meaning be translated as " in esse." For instance, we find the suggestion that plant protoplasm is at bottom crystalline; that at bottom man is a vegetative being ;10 8 Ibid., p. 187. n Ibid., p. 195. 10 Ibid., p. 161.</page><page sequence="5">GENETICISM AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE 425 that we can not know self in any " fundamental " way until we know protoplasm and the amoeba; that " perhaps when we know why one thought or feeling is preferred to another it may some time be clear that it is ' at bottom ' because it favors cerebral or general nutrition. " 11 So much for a statement of the genetic method and the hypothe- sis upon which it proceeds. It is understood that no legitimate objection can be made to the study of the natural history of mind, or to the use of the genetic method in the examination of such a history. A purely methodological issue is here raised in the form of an objection against the assumption, wherever it may occur, that the genetic "explanation " is exhaustively explanatory, and that its con- clusions are always valid. Wherever this assumption is made, the fundamental error of it is apparently the one to which Cohen has directed our attention in the fields of inquiry already alluded to, namely, the error arising from a confusion of history with valuation. Against this undiscriminating use of the genetic method in psy- chological inquiry I beg to submit the following objections: (1) In the first place the demand for the continuity of essence is a logical demand. Thanks to Bergson we now have the audacity to question the validity of such a demand. We can recognize it as but another of those " musts " from which science broke away in comparatively recent times. But like a, Freudian dream it escapes the censorship of our minds because it is disguised in more accept- able terminology. In this manner it returns to play a part in the thinking of the day. The very words of this logical obsession, how- ever, will at times betray its presence, as when John Burroughs, the naturalist, says, " No extrinsic condition could have made a man out of a worm, the man scheme must have been inherent in the worm." Both the notion of the " man scheme " and the authority of the " must " are clearly rationalistic. Mr. Burroughs seems here to be espousing the genetic method as the only alternative to creationism. This illustrates the fact that the biological sciences, psychology in- cluded, are ready to accept all the consequences of one of two ancient alternatives when the other has been discarded. But we may not play both fast and loose with our logic, for if it demands that the man-scheme must be found in the worm, would it not also demand that it must be found in those primordial conditions, what- ever they may have been, from which the worm itself came, and so on in indefinite regression, for, as Stewart puts it,12 " the only possible issue of such determinism would be to say for example that the whole social and moral progress of the human race was implic- 11 Ibid., p. 191. 12 Questions of the Day ifn Philosophy, p. 155.</page><page sequence="6">426 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY itly present in that molten mass which scientists tell us constituted our earth at the stages when the heat was too intense to allow the presence of life. " William Jamesl&amp; and Lloyd Morgan'14 have recog- nized the same crisis of reasoning. The genetic hypothesis seems to assume that whatever aspect of human experience we may desire to examine is to be found, if not in the nebula, at least in some form of existence that is lower in the scale than the point in the phyletic series at which the phe- nomenon. is being examined. We are familiar with the assumption in comparative psychology that the differences between the mind of mari and that of the lower orders is one of degree and not of kind, i.e., it is a matter of more or less, the essences, if you will, remaining the same. The higher is assumed to be present in the lower, and all that subsequent evolution can add amounts to mere accretions of secondary or non-essential characteristics. The use of the notion of differences in kind and differences in degree, if followed persistently, can be made to lead to queer results. It sometimes would appear that the only differences that exist be- tween things at all are reducible to differences in degree, if one is allowed to choose the aspect from which they are to be compared. For instance, land animals and aquatic animals may from some viewpoints be considered different in kind, and yet, if the part which water plays in the life economy of each be taken as the point of comparison (surely a fair one in this case), the difference be- comes one of degree when one thinks of the proportion of water in the living cells of the bodies of so-called land animals. Again, sea-water and human blood surely could be regarded as different in kind from some points of view. Yet Professor Macallum has suggested that the blood in the human body is but a modified form of the water of the Pre-Cambrian seas. The distinction represents one of those snares into which logic will betray itself when pushed into finalities. What except the relentless urge of logic could drive us to demand a psychology of lettuce or to imagine the phlegmatic temperament of cabbage? Our minds seem held by the conviction that what is must always have been, that nothing new can come into existence. This conviction is one of the subtle perversions of the laws of cause and effect and of the conservation of energy. The dictum that every effect must have an exactly commensurate cause is a different thing from saying that every evolutionary antecedent is identical in essence with its successor. " The intellect,' says Bergson, " does not admit the unforeseeable. It rejects all creation. That definite antecedents bring forth a definite consequent, calcu- 13 Psychology, Vol. I, p. 149. 14 Introduction to Comparative Psychology, Ch. XVIIL</page><page sequence="7">GENETICISM AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE 427 lable as a definite function of them, is what satisfies our intellect." This, it would seem, is the logical demand that has constrained us to build a line of biological essences, and has led us in our study of mental phenomena to pursue them beyond their vanishing point and to evaluate them in terms of that which, from certain aspects at least, they are not. It is the same logical demand that has misled us into confusing historical continuity with historical identity. The spirit of present-day thinking does not seem to insist so much that evolution shall, as logically conceived, run smoothly. What if it does not do so? Will not the processes of life go on and the sun continue to rise without the crowing of a logical chanticleer? Some of the most fundamental hypotheses in the physical sciences are altogether illogical. It is difficult to understand why psychologists should be expected to have so much more sensitive consciences about logical consistency than other scientists. One can see why they above all others should be able to appreciate the fallibility of logic. (2) Again it is to be observed in criticism of the genetic method that in spite of its insistence on the introduction of the time ele- ment into our explanations of mental phenomenal when it comes to saying what a certain thing really is, the time factor is reduced to the zero point, and some arbitrarily chosen cross-section of the life history of it is selected and this is declared to be the point at which the phenomenon in question is to be found in its ultimately real form. In the genetic procedure the usual method is to strip the phenomenon to be studied of all supposed evolutionary accre- tions, or addenda, of all characteristics that have not endured through a satisfactory lapse of time. To the geneticist the old is the real, the quintessential. Before he is ready to say that any phenom- enon is " at bottom," or " nothing but " so and so, he must con- tinue the process of elimination of all qualities of a more or less com- plex or evolved kind to an indeterminate stopping point. If the process were indefinitely continued he would in the end arrive, as we have just pointed out, at a meaingless core of material substances and forces which would be embarrassing in the hands of a psycholo- gist if this were all that he had left. Psychology would at such a point, and indeed at all points, be compelled to foreclose in favor of mechanics. But in order to avoid bankruptcy of this kind the geneticist chooses a stopping point at which he locates the genesis of the presumably essential characteristics. It is very necessary to know, and for the geneticist to declare, by what right these points are -selected, and by what criteria the choices are determined. Is not the geneticist compelled to abandon his geneticism in making use of such starting points? Woodbridge'5 points out that history 15 Purpose of History, p. 63.</page><page sequence="8">428 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY can have neither ending nor beginning. In tracing beginnings he says we " stop only because we do not care to go farther, or lack the means to do so, and not because we can say that we have found a first beginning with no antecedents before it." Hence we see one of the chief difficulties in explaining things genetically or in terms of history, for, since nothing can be stated in terms of its entire history the geneticist is compelled to resort to cross sectional explanation, which he starts out by condemning. Now, if, as Woodbridge points out, there are no stages, stations, stops or beginnings and endings in history and if, as certain psy- chologists hold, there is " no rupture of identity " in the phyletic series, it would seem sound to claim the superiority of the more accessible present cross-section as the best cross-section for scientific investigation, as indeed the introspectionists are supposed to assume. The examination of phenomena in their simplest forms has its obvious advantages, whether these forms can be produced arti- ficially under experimental control or can be found in nature. But this admission does not justify the conclusion, so often found im- plicit in psychological thinking, that the simplest forms contain all that is real and essential in the complex. Aristotle says,16 " The nature of anything, e.g., of a man, a horse, or a house, may be de- fined to be its condition when the process of its production is com- plete. " One can not see how this is any less sound than the genet- icist's method of " defining things in terms of their origins," for after all, who is competent to judge between the several contending cross-sections? There are cross-sections, it must be remembered, not only on the time scale, but also on the scale of simplicity. (3) In the third place, history is one thing, evaluation another. In calling attention to this point years ago William James17 said that the logic of the times recognized " two orders of inquiry con- cerning anything." The answer to the first inquiry is an existen- tial judgment or proposition. The answer to the second is a prop- osition of value. Most important of all he calls our attention to the principle that "neither judgment can be deduced immediately from the other." " They proceed," he says, " from diverse intel- lectual preoccupations, and the mind combines them only by mak- ing them first separately, and then adding them together." The use in psychology of the terms "at bottom," " nothing but," " in essence," and the like, generally discloses an instance of immediate deduction of value from history. That a widespread use is made of this deduction would scarcely admit of doubt. Woodbridge says,." 16 Politics, I, ii, Weldon 's trans. 17 Varieties of Religitow Experiences, p. 4. 8 Loc. eit.</page><page sequence="9">GENETICISM AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE 429 " Relieved of the necessity of explaining continuity, philosophers, biologists, historians, and even students of language, literature, and the arts have been too frequently content to let the fact of continu- ity do all the explaining that needs to be done. To discover the historical origins and trace the descent of ideas, institutions, cus- toms, and forms of life, have been for many the exclusive and suffi- cient occupation to the neglect of experimental science and with the consequent failure to make us very much wiser in our attempts to control the intricate factors of human living. If we would appre- ciate our own morals and religion we are often advised to consider primitive man and his institutions. If we would evaluate marriage or property, we are often directed to study remote ancestors. And this practical advice has sometimes taken the form of metaphysics. If we wish to know the nature of things or to appraise their worth, we are told to contemplate some primitive cosmic stuff from which everything has been derived. Thus man and all the varied pan- orama of the world vanish backward into the nebula, and life dis- appears into the impulse to live. " The axiomatic principle to which Cohen called our attention, namely, that " nothing is explicable except in terms of its history," becomes quite easily transformed in practise into its much more radical converse that everything is explicable in terms of its history. From this the step is easy to the assumption that history exhausts the possibilities of knowledge, to the identification of history with valuation. Evolution, according to this conception, would have to be pictured as an infinitely long chain with equality signs written between each link. It is not to the links but to the equality sign that objection is meant to be raised. That a confusion of history and valuation occurs even in the commonplace affairs of life is indicated by the ordinary experience that a prophet is not without honor save in his native land, the reason being that his neighbors know his origin and history, and hence feel that by that fact they know his worth. The question, " Is not this the carpenter's son?" illustrates this common illusion of knowledge. The feeling of a sense of insecurity in the presence of the strange, the novel, is dispelled by a knowledge of origins and history, which in turn gives way to a comfortable feeling of security and mastery, a feeling which doubtless accounts for this illusion and which completely satisfies certain types of inquiry, leaving no curi- osity for further investigation. It is a significant observation that the study of social origins sometimes begets a disregard for the au- thority and value of social conventions. This could not be if his- tory were not assumed to be the equivalent of valuation. While evolutionary science has wrought an emancipation of the human</page><page sequence="10">430 THE JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY mind and has effected a disillusionment of man concerning his origin, it has bequeathed him an illusion and a sophistication which are no better grounded in fact than his former conceptions and which are probably less valuable socially. (4) Turning to the question of fact we find still another criti- cism against the validity of the genetic method. If we lay aside the notion of essences, it does not appear to be true that natural phenom- ena have maintained an unruptured continuity throughout their history. This may be shown in morphological changes that are supposed to have taken place in the progress of evolution. The suggestion is made'9 that the thymus gland, the mouth, the olfactory organs and certain parts of the ear may have evolved from the gill slits. Now if it be granted that these or similar things have oc- curred in nature the genetic hypothesis becomes at once discredited. For once you attempt to define or explain a certain structure by it you will have to reduce that structure back at least to a point at which it has completely changed both its form and its function. Such a reduction would be of doubtful explanatory value, except in so far as it would add the item of knowledge that a certain step occurred in the genetic series. Now, if we mean by explanation just that, then geneticism is exhaustively explanatory, but when we have chosen to adopt such an interpretation of what shall be meant by explanation, are we not in that very act using valuation, which by hypothesis is inconsistent with the genetic method of explanation? Psychologists have never hesitated to adduce such facts as these, sometimes in seeming disregard of their bearing upon the method which they were employing-the identification of the smile, by Spencer I believe, with the act of opening the mouth to receive food, the tracing of will back to the same food-seeking act by Hall,20 the reduction of the process of laughter back to the shaking of the sides to rid the creature's skin of stinging insects. And so all the ele- ments of human experience become explained by or identified with their genetic forebears. In no realm is this criticism of fact against the genetic method more effective than in that of social phenomena. The raison d'etre, the structure, and the function and purpose of institutions may change from age to age, and yet they may show unbroken continu- ity. This sort of change would admit of many illustrations. In certain classes of phenomena it is to be admitted of course that history affords the most important available data. It is doubt- less true that the early development of the genetic method took place in the treatment of matters of this kind. Hill2' illustrates this 19 Partridge: Genetic Philosophy and Education, p. 29. 20 Loc. cit., p. 191. 21 Genetic Philosophy, pp. 14-15.</page><page sequence="11">GENETICISM AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE 431 use by supposing that an archeologist should find a bronze axe in a mound of shells. It is obvious at once that this instrument was made by man, and that it belongs to a certain stage of human cul- ture. But he says if we desire to go further we can only follow the genetic method. As soon as we abandon this method, " all scientific thought stops short and all other thought is nugatory. " In archeology the question of chief consideration is, admittedly, the location of the phenomenon, at its proper point in the historical series. Most of all one wants to know to what period of history a certain custom or thing belongs in order to relate it to its particular time setting. In the case of these phenomena which do not function in the present time setting, history has its maximum importance as compared with valuation. But even in such cases as that of the bronze axe the historian may be so exclusively historical in the han- dling of his data that ideas which had been concrete and vital in their time setting may grow into meaningless abstractions. The proper sort of history of philosophy, for example, says Balz,22 should help to "free philosophic thought from over-respect for the past, to provoke a more forward-looking manner of thinking, and make his- tory an aid and not an obstacle in the pursuit of wisdom.'" This plea is a pertinent one for psychology. For example, the phenome- non of agarophobia, the fear of open places, may be made more in- telligible by reference to the dangers incurred by our ancestors through exposure to enemies in open spaces. In this instance our only question and our only interest may be, whence did it come, how did it arise? In other words, since it now has no raison d'etre, in order to be able to make it intelligible' we must carry it back to the point of time at which it did have significance, meaning, value. And it is in terms of its one-time value after all that we seek its ex- planation. Merely to run it back in the temporal order can not of itself satisfy all inquiry. (5) There seems to be an identical case against those who, for purposes of explanation, reduce natural phenomena down the scale of simplicity without the employment of the time factor. Geneti- cism, as we have seen, assumes, and indeed must assume, the validity of both methods. So long as we arrive " at bottom " the geneticist seems content. The attempt in physiology to express vital processes in terms of lower, simpler mechanical action has, we are told,23 not met with success. Haldane24 says, " The new physiology is biologi- cal physiology--not bio-physics or biochemistry. The attempt to analyze living organisms into physical and chemical mechanism is 22 This JOURNAL, Vol. XVI, 41. 23 McDougall: Body and Mind, p. 253. 24 Science, Nov. 3, 1916.</page><page sequence="12">432 THE JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY probably the most colossal failure in the whole history of modern science. It is a failure, not, as its present defenders suggest, be. cause the facts we know axe too few, but because the facts we already know are inconsistent with the mechanistic theory." This latter method might be called analyticism. Geneticism and analyticism have certain features in common. They both seek to explain the complex in terms of the simple. In analyticism the phenomenon is reduced to its lowest terms, whereas in geneticism the endeavor is made to find it thus reduced in nature, or else to deduce what must have been its simplest form at some distant point of time. Both geneticism and analyticism assume the explicability of the complex in terms of the simple. An example of this assump- tion can be found in The Text Book of Psychology by Titchener (p. 238). He says, " experiences which may be analyzed into organic sensations are complexes of organic sensations, and nothing more or less." This is clearly another case of " at bottom " ex- planation. The underlying assumption may be considered to be the basis and background of introspectionism. It is also doubtless the logical demand back of the contention, in the now somewhat quiescent imageless-thought controversy, that all that there is in mental processes must reveal itself in the structural elements of mental content. As with geneticism, we may confine ourselves to a search for the elemental components of mental processes, and we may assume at the outset that we shall mean by explanation precisely that and nothing more. No one questions the right of a scientist to prescribe the conditions of his own inquiry. But it must be borne in mind that an inquiry thus prescribed can not pretend to answer all the demands of all sorts of explanations that could arise. The know- ledge that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen might be sufficient for a chemist, but not for a gardener. While Herbert Spencer's method is primarily that of the geneticist, attention has been called to the fact that his sociology suffered from use of the analytic method in that he centered attention on the units of the social groups to the disregard of their unity. Both geneticism and analyticism are after all only heuristic principles, and as such are useful only in so far as they yield desired results. (6) In conclusion let it be understood that the main contention of this paper is that fact and value should be kept distinct in scien- tific treatment. Whether science should take account of value is another question, and one on which there is a difference of opinion. According to Titchener25 " science deals, not with values, but with facts. There is no good or bad, sick or well, useful or useless, in 25 A Beginner's Psychology, p. 1.</page><page sequence="13">MEETING OF THE WESTERN DIVISION 433 science," says he. On the other hand we have the view of Everett, who says2t that " the distinction ... is no longer one between de- scriptive sciences of what is, and non-descriptive sciences of what is not, but what ought to be; it is a distinction between descriptive sciences of facts indifferent in value, and descriptive sciences of what may be called value-facts." Kantor takes the position27 that " the facts of science are evaluations of phenomena," and that psychology should be treated as a, " science of critical evaluation." It is interesting to note that the first sentence of Titchener's Be- ginner's Psychology, to which reference has been made, is this: "'We live in a world of values." The text is presumably proposing to examine the human instrument, the mind, by which this " world of values " gets understood and by means of which vital adjust- ments are made to it. To separate thought from its object, to treat mind in complete disregard of its environing world is a species of psychological dualism against which psychologists should not need to be warned. Psychology has ceased to occupy itself exclusively with struc- tural analysis of the content of consciousness. The chief inquiry at the present has reference to the functional efficiency of mental com- ponents revealed by such analyses. Indeed, in the theoretical study of mental tests and especially in practical psychology, we are recog- nizing and are endeavoring to differentiate " the good and the bad, the sick and the well, the useful and the useless. " In short we have crossed the Rubicon and are busy in the domain of psychological values. Hence any confusion of fact and value will have conse- quences for the future of psychology. To resolve psychology into the natural history of mind and to make no distinction between his- tory and value, after the fashion of the geneticists, would be as for- eign to the purposes of functional psychology as structural analysis itself has been.
