<plain_text><page sequence="1">' ' Why Should I Be Rational ? ' ' by Max Black * Summary The prevalent view that a question expressed by the interrogative title must be absurd and in no need of a reasoned response (Geach, Peter Singer, Ayer) is rejected. Popper's contention that commitment to rationality (respect for reasons) has only an irrational basis is criticised. A preli- minary attempt is made to resolve some genuine perplexities about the justification of rationality by invoking the notion of a "quasi-rationality" shared by human beings and other animals. An appendix on the metaphor of support is attached. Résumé L'auteur rejette l'opinion prédominante selon laquelle la question contenue dans ce titre doit être absurde et ne mérite de ce fait aucune réponse raisonnée (Geach, Peter Singer, Ayer). Il criti- que l'affimation de Popper que l'engagement en faveur de la rationalité (le respect pour des rai- sons) ait une base uniquement irrationnelle. Il tente un premier essai pour résoudre quelques per- plexités quant à la justification de la rationalité en introduisant la notion de «quasi-rationalité» que partagent les êtres humains et autres animaux. Suit un appendice sur la métaphore anglaise «support». Zusammenfassung Der Verfasser verwirft die überwiegende Auffassung, dass die im Titel aufgeworfene Frage absurd sein müsse und keiner rationalen Antwort zugänglich sei (Geach, Peter Singer, Ayer). Er kritisiert auch Poppers Behauptung, dass Rationalität (Anerkennung von Gründen) nur irratio- nal begründbar sei. Es wird versucht, einige echte Verlegenheitsmomente bei der Rechtfertigung von Rationalität zu überwinden, indem der von Menschen und Tieren geteilte Begriff einer «Quasirationalität» eingeführt wird. In einem Appendix wird die Metapher der «Stützung» er- örtert. * Cornell University, Ithaca N.Y.

It is like hitting below the intellect. Oscar Wilde 1. Prologue The philosopher had ended his last lecture, as always, with a homily: " Ladies and gentlemen, let me urge you: Do try in future, do please try, to be rational!" After the cheers and jeers had subsided, a student rose to say, 4 'Professor, I have been itching for a long time to ask you, Why should I be rational? " (Let us call this the rationality question.). The heckler seems to be asking for a reason to be rational. In so doing, is he not manifesting some commitment to the practice of asking for reasons and hence behaving rationally? Does some absurdity lurk here, as philosophers have usually supposed? Would it be rational to offer a serious answer? If so, what form might it take? These are some of the questions that I propose to consider. In so doing, I shall be at odds with the writers who have thought that the rationality question deserves only a summary dismissal. Unlike them, I believe that the title of this paper can express a genuine perplexity that merits serious attention. Sober friends of rationality, well aware that 4 'rationality is not enough," should still be willing to cope with genuine doubt as to whether commitment to rationality can, without circularity, itself be rationally defended. 2. An indeterminate question I need to distinguish between two ordinary uses of 'question'. We sometimes regard an interrogative formula - such as ' Why should I read this paper? ' or its translation into another language - as expressing a determinate question even if it contains an indexical pronoun. I shall call what is supposedly thus expressed by the relevant interrogative formula a standard question ( Q , for short). In talking about some Q (as say in the locution "The question before the assembly") we feel no need to spell out the state of mind of any hypothetical user of Q : we presuppose, as it were, an open class of standard questioners, all of whom mean the same thing ( Q ) when uttering the identifying formula.</page><page sequence="3">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 149 On the other hand, what a given speaker or thinker means when using a Q- formula will normally vary with his state of mind, his beliefs about the topic, his intention in raising Q , and so on. To refer to this use, I shall say that a particular questioner is making an inquiry (/ for short). Since the F s corre- sponding to a given abstract Q vary with the questioner's condition, the same Q-formula in the mouth of one person may demand an answer significantly different from an answer to another inquiry of the same verbal form. Let us refer to the relevant facts about a questioner's situation that determine his specific ' 4 inquiry ' ' his stance. To summerise: I view a particular Q-formula, expressing a single standard question , as bearing a one-many relation to a set of related questioners' inquiries , the latter being functions of the respective users' stances. I shall eventually describe a variety of types of inquiries , each correspond- ing to the same interrogative formula, 44 Why should I be rational? " If I am right, satisfactory answers to a rationality inquiry will need to be tailored to a hypothesised speaker's particular stance. First, however, I must draw attention to a troublesome ambiguity in our first Q-formula (this paper's title). 3 . Disputes about rationality A natural first response to anybody raising the rationality question would be 44 Well, that depends upon what you mean - and what you ought to mean - by 'rational'." But the word 'rational' and its near relations 'rationality' and 4 Reason ' are extraordinarily variable in their uses. Appeal to 4 4 ordinary language", usefal as it is in clarifying less contro- versial concepts, is here unhelpful. For 4 rational', unlike 'reasonable', is no part of the working vocabulary of the "man in the street"; and even "educated" professionals (say those reluctant to admit ignorance of Freud or Wittgenstein) are remarkably erratic in their uses of 'rational' and its par- onyms.1 On turning to scholarly elucidations of rationality we again find extensive disagreement and inconsistency. Bertrand Russell once said: "'Reason' has a perfectly clear and precise meaning. It signifies the choice of the right means for the end that you wish to achieve. It has nothing whatever to do with the choice of ends." (But Russell was too sensible to conform to his own dictum.)2 Such an instrumental 1 A questionnaire, widely distributed among students and university teachers in England, Canada and the United States, has revealed extensive disagreement as to whether backing a horse to win and to lose at the same odds, or crying over spilled milk (to mention two examples) should count as rational, irrational, or neither. (The results of this inquiry are as yet unpublished.) 2 Bertrand Russell, Human Society in Ethics and Politics (London, 1954, preface).</page><page sequence="4">150 Max Black conception of rationality no doubt owes much of its present vogue - and not in economics alone - to the supposed authority of Max Weber's Zweckratio- nalität. 3 Michael Oakeshotťs lengthy essay, " Rational Conduct,' ' contains the observation that " the only significant way of using the word 'rational' in relation to conduct is when we mean to indicate . . .faithfulness to the knowl- edge of how to conduct the activity we are engaged in More succinctly: "practical human knowledge may be counted 'rational' in respect to its faithfulness to a knowledge of how to behave well."4 Gilbert Ryle5 and Richard Robinson6 identified rationality with man's supposedly unique power to exercise 4 4 thought ' ' . In such common uses, 'rational' and its cognates are concertina words, sometimes referring to distinctively human powers of grasping necessary connections and demonstrating theorems (as in classical "rationalism"); at other times referring more expansively to vaguely conceived ideals of "right thinking" or admirable living; and nowadays, far more restrictively, to the manipulation of a cost-benefit calculus for maximizing utility. Fortunately, I need not enter the lists of this endemic jousting between enbattled partisans of conflicting conceptions of reason and rationality. For all would agree that a necessary condition for thinking, feeling or acting rationally is to use and to respect reasons. I shall therefore narrow the Q-for- mula to run "Why should I pay attention to reasons? " 4. The amended question The question to be considered from now on - or rather the variety of par- ticular "inquiries" fitting the various users' "stances" in point - now takes the form: "What reason is there for me to be rational? Since I am thinking of rationality as a style of life minimally, but of course not exclusively, requiring a steady interest in finding reasons for thoughts, emotions and actions, our Q can be spelled out as: "What reason do I have for attending to (searching for and using) reasons for my doings? " 3 It is often forgotten that Weber also recognised Wertrationalität, demanding the pursuit of absolute values without considering alternatives or "counting the cost". See for instance Tal- cott Parsons ed., Max Weber: The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation (New York, 1947) especially pp. 14 and 115. 4 Michael Oakeshott, "Rational Conduct," The Cambridge Journal , vol. 4 (1950), pp. 20, 26 (original italics). 5 Gilbert Ryle, "A Rational Animal," Collected Papers (London, 1971), vol. II, p. 419. 6 Richard Robinson, An A theisť s Values (Oxford, 1964), p. 105.</page><page sequence="5">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 151 I use " doings" here as shorthand for ' 4 thoughts, feelings or actions". Hen- ceforward, my use of ' Q' without further specification, will refer to the 4 ' standard question " expressed in the above formula. A satisfactory answer to Q , as now amended, will take the form: " You should attend to reasons, because, unless you do so, R [some- thing or other] will be the case. ' ' 04) Here, Ļ R ' is a place-holder for some sentence expressing what is presented as being the case. An example, though not the one I shall be recommending, might, be: " You should attend to reasons, because unless you do so, you will roast in Hell." In an answer of this form, the reason offered is expected to serve as an effec- tive reason for the original questioner, e.g. because he would rather not roast in Hell - and similarly for other possible replacements of ' R '. 5 . The alleged unreasonableness of answering: Geach ys position In the canonical form of the answer I am now seeking, a reason is proposed why the particular questioner raising the rationality inquiry should "attend to reasons ". Here, there is a perceptible whiff of vicious circularity. Professor Geach has said: " Though it is reasonable to ask for reasons, it is not always reasonable to ask for reasons. . . . [I]t is not reasonable to ask for a reason why one should ever observe the practice of asking for reasons; the man who claims to reject the practice must not ask others why (i.e. for what reason) they go in for it, or else he is shown not to be a total abstainer from it." (P. T. Geach, Reason and Argument, Oxford, 1976, page 1) If we agreed with Geach, we should presumably have to reply to somebody asking Q, (my " amended question") by saying something like: "I can't answer, because you are behaving unreasonably in asking the question". Then we should be behaving reasonably by supplying a reason for refusing to answer, but on Geach' s view that would cut no ice with the questioner. Yet to offer a direct answer instead would, on Geach's view, be as unreasonable as to start a game of chess with somebody who " rejects the practice" of playing the game. Geach seems to assume that anybody asking Q is a " total abstainer " from rationality: I shall argue later that this need not be so. And even somebody who is utterly sceptical about the point of 4 4 the practice" of using reasons might maliciously intend to embarrass an advocate of rationality. If so, there</page><page sequence="6">152 Max Black is prima facie nothing unreasonable about presenting supporting reasons for the practice. But wouldn't there after all be something objectionably circular about offering a reason for attending to reasons? I shall now briefly discuss the considerations advanced by two other philosophers for thinking that there is indeed such an absurdity. 6. Peter Singer's objection Professor Peter Singer has recently claimed that what I have been calling the rationality question (in its original rather than its amended form) must be dismissed because it 44 questions something - in this case rationality - nor- mally presupposed " (Practical Ethics, Cambridge, 1979, p. 203). Well, the alleged presupposition involved might be expressed as an asser- tion, say: 4 4 One should provide reasons for assertions ' ' (C) A more defensible version might be: 4 4 Reasons should be offered for assertions, whenever possible or de- sirable" (C) That (C) is in some sense 4 4 normally presupposed " in conversation and argu- ment cannot be expected to appeal to a questioner who is prepared or anxious to reject this very 4 "presupposition". Might he not retort that if rational con- versation 4 4 presupposes" something like ( C) or (C") so much the worse for that kind of discourse, which he is happy to forgo. (Cf: 44 Betting in a casino presupposes willingness to lose money." 44 Then I'd rather not bet ! ") But it has not yet been shown that a rational defense of rational proce- dures 4 4 presupposes" what such a defense is intended to achieve. In section 4 above, I imagined a rationalist's defense to take some such form as: You should attend to reasons, because unless you do so, such-and- such (which you don't want) will be the case, which has the form, approximately, of: C, because if not-C, then D 04) where D is understood to be something unwanted by the person addressed. So our present question can take the form of: Does A presuppose C, and if so in what sense ? Well, nobody could sincerely present A without already believing its con- clusion (C) to be correct. But there is nothing disturbing, from a logical point of view, about this, since we often find it useful to argue for a conclusion that we already believe to be correct, e.g. in order to strengthen an antecedent belief or to establish logical connections between disjointed beliefs.</page><page sequence="7">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 153 To offer C as a premise of A would, of course, to be guilty of flagrant circularity. But clearly C is not needed as a premise of A, even though we show that we accept C when we argue in its favour. In order for A to be valid, it suffices that the R presented shall be a good reason for not rejecting C, without our saying that it is so. Now consider the position of a sceptical questioner who is offered A. Does he need to believe C in order to perceive A as valid ? No: he is required only to see that the particular reason supplied, (if not C, then D) is indeed a good reason for holding C. If he can't or won't do so much, then of course A will fail to convince him of the advisability of attending to reasons - and so, no doubt would any other argument to the same effect. No argument, however sound, can have any appeal to a questioner too stupid to recognise a good reason when he sees one - or too obdurate to confess that he does recognise it. 7. Ayer's objection Writing on a closely related topic, the justification of reliance upon induc- tive procedures, Ayer has said: "What is demanded is a proof that what we regard as rational procedure really is so; that our conception of what constitutes good evidence is right. But of what kind is this proof supposed to be? A purely formal proof would not be applicable, and anything else is going to beg the question." A. J. Ayer, The Problem of Knowledge (Baltimore, Penguin, 1956, P. 74) Ayer views this outcome with some complacency: "This does not mean that the use of scientific method [in context: inductive procedures] is irrational. It could be irrational only if there were a standard of rationality which it failed to meet; whereas in fact it goes to set the standard: arguments are judged to be ra- tional or irrational by reference to it." (Op. cit., p. 75) No doubt, Ayer would take the same position with regard to our rationality question. He might well feel that with regard to a demand for an argument in support of appeal to reasons, "No proof that we are right can be forthcom- ing: for at this stage nothing is going to be allowed to count as such a proof" (ib.). Substituting "rational argument" for "inductive reasoning" in Ayer's peroration, we get: "When it is understood that there logically could be no court of superior jurisdiction, it hardly seems troubling that [rational argu-</page><page sequence="8">154 Max Black ment] should be left, as it were, to act as judge in its own cause. The sceptic's merit is that he forces us to see that this must be so." {Ib., p. 75) Stripped of its persuasive rhetoric, Ayer' s view amounts to this: scientific method is what scientists accept as justifying the conclusions they accept; appeal to good reasons is what those of us (including scientists) treat as a "standard"7 for justifying beliefs: "logically" speaking, there can be no "proof" or even a good supporting argument to show that we are right in having such a standard. (This implies that even if experience were to show that reliance upon reasons does not pay in certain domains - an eventuality not be excluded a priori - that would in no way discredit our continuing reliance upon reasons, even in those very domains.) Unlike Ayer, 1 do find this view of the matter "troubling". For I believe it provides, however unintentionally, substantial ammunition to an irrationalist. Such a one might plausibly retort that if there can be no reasons favoring rationality, there cannot be any reasons against irrationality. Seen in this light, a settled policy of rejecting appeal to reasons will seem no shakier than the contrary policy. Currently fashionable talk about the "standard" we adopt, or the rules supposedly governing the uses of 'rationality' and its semantic cognates, or the "game that is played", or the mores and conven- tions of "our" society will then have no persuasive force against anybody seriously revolting against these very standards and practices. 8. Popper's view I shall end this part of my paper with a remarkable illustration of the tendency of even passionate devotees of rationality to succumb to what sounds like ultimate irrationality. In an essay entitled "Utopia and Violence ", (reprinted in Conjectures and Refutations [London, 19631) Karl Popper partly identifies his own version of "critical rationalism " in the following terms: "A rationalist, as I use the word, is a man who attempts to reach decisions by argument, and perhaps, in certain cases, by com- promise, rather than by violence" (p. 356). 7 It is tempting, but mistaken, to suppose that a standard cannot itself be tested for accuracy. If we had evidence of a break-in to the chamber containing the ''standard meter rod" in Paris and could see that its end had been removed, we would have excellent reason to believe that the official standard had changed its length.</page><page sequence="9">"Why Should I Be Rational ?" 155 Popper then makes the following remarks about the basis of his own ' ' rationalism ' ' as thus understood: "[M]y rationalism is not self-contained, but rests on an irrational faith in the attitude of reasonableness. I do not see that we can go beyond this" (p. 357). Here Popper uses the word 'irrational', not in its usual sense of 'contrary to reason', but rather as meaning 'fio^-rational' i.e. unable to be supported by argument. That this is his intention is made explicit by the following passage: " My rationalism is not dogmatic. I fully admit that I cannot ration- ally prove it. I frankly confess that I choose rationalism because I hate violence, and I do not deceive myself into believing that this hatred has any rational grounds " (p. 357). Although Popper has not explicitly raised the question I have chosen as a title, he has provided an answer to it in the passages I have just quoted. A Popperian style of reply to the questioning student imagined in my opening paragraph would presumably run somewhat as follows: " Why should you be rational? There is no ' should ' about it ! I can give you no arguments in favour of being rational. To be blunt about this matter, there are no reasons for you to be rational (for the existence of any such reason would yield an argument for ra- tionality). You have a choice between being rational and practising violence. If, like me, you hate violence, you will choose rationalism; if not, not. That's all there is to say. If you reject rationalism, you will be irrational, and that's all there is to it. 8 It is worth noting that this position implies that there are also no reasons for or against violence. For if " violence" and " rationalism" are mutually exclusive alternatives - as Popper seems to imply - any reason for or against violence would be a reason against or for rationalism. Whether Popper's view about the epistemological status of ť ' rationalism " can itself be rational in Popper's sense - i.e. supportable by reasons - I shall not stop to consider. At any rate he offers no such reason that could be expected to sway anybody already committed to some alternative to "rationalism" - say, praying for divine guidance. Might not a terrorist, happy to bait the enemy, reply in the following terms ? 8 Popper has elsewhere provided far more adequate and persuasive conceptions of the rationality of which he has been a life-long advocate. See for instance, Paul Schilpp, ed., The Philosophy of Karl Popper, (La Salle, 111., 1974) vol. II, pp. 1085-86.</page><page sequence="10">156 Max Black 4 4 Bravo! You hate 'violence', but I hate argument (a sneaking use of force other means). You call me irrational but I glory in that title. Like you, I hold that there are no ultimate reasons for my irra- tionality (for that would detract from the purity of my position). The difference between us is like that between a protestant and a catholic: your faith is my heresy; my faith is your heresy. That's all there is to say." Leaving such a terrorist to gloat over his dialectical skill, I shall try to argue that there remains something - and something important - to say from a rational point of view in defense of rationality. 9. A gallery of questioners I have already maintained that the " rationality question", whether in its original or in its amended form, when raised without information about the context of utterance and the questioner's " stance" (why he asks, what is bothering him) is too unmotivated and diffusely vague to elicit an appropriate reply. I shall now partly remedy these déficiences of specification by present- ing a variety of conceivable stances, generating an ordered series of specific " inquiries " expressible by the same standard Q. Let us then imagine Pyrrho Redivivus in a variety of questioning avatars, (P1,P2,. . .). PI is a fanatical antirationalist, who views the hypocritical homilies of rationality advocates as no more significant than the braying of donkeys. His interest in raising the rationality question is to provoke yet another ridiculous exhibition of folly. P2, less malicious than PI, is a belligerent sceptic , like the apocryphal 4 'village atheist". Believing that talk about 'reason' and 'rationality' is as superstitious as talk about witches or the devil, he uses the rationality labels with sneer-quotes. For him, ' reason ' means only ' whatever you perversely mean when using that word'. His interest is to watch a rationality advocate struggle with the hopeless task of producing a rational justification of ra- tionality, (His own stance resembles that of a mathematician condescending to hear one more futile attempt to square the circle). P3 is an agnostic rationalist ,9 who usually "listens to reason" in practical affairs, resents the scorn of PI and P2, and yet despairs, 9 Here, and elsewhere in this paper, I use "rationalist" to mean somebody who is com- mitted to trying to be rational.</page><page sequence="11">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 157 with Hume, of finding ultimate rational foundation for his beliefs and actions. Conformist in deeds and thoughts, but agnostic about the ultimate Articles of Faith, he is an easy prey for anthropologising relativists for whom 4 'our rationality" is merely one culture-bound form of life among many. Like Sartre, he thinks of commitment to rational- ity as an arbitrary choice. P4 is an undogmatic but whole-hearted rationalist , confident of his cognitive rectitude in using relevant rational procedures, yet seriously interested in seeking good reasons for the beneficial practice of using good reasons. (He is cautiously optimistic of the prospects of justifying rationality by rational considerations; but sufficiently sceptical not to foreclose the disagreeable possibility that rationality might after all prove to be an illusion.) These characters demand differential responses from a friend of rational- ity. It would be folly to argue with that extreme type of misologist I have dubbed the 4 4 fanatical antirationalist ' ' . When one's interlocutor is as likely to draw a revolver (like the unlamented Goebbels on hearing the word 44 cul- ture") as to listen to the 4 'nonsense of rationality" the safest course for a rationalist is avoidance and flight. The others deserve better treatment, to the degree that they are amenable to rational argument. In what follows, I shall sometimes think of myself as addressing a 4 'belligerent sceptic: (P2), since his initial stance presents the hardest problem for a defender of rationality. But the considerations to be advanced should apply with even greater force to the "agnostic rationalist" (P3) and the "whole-hearted rationalist" (P4). (In addressing the last, I also engage in soliloquy.) 10. The bogy of infinite regress A suitable response to our imagined questioner (one of the Ps) can take the form of a 44 practical" argument: C, because/? (A) in which something, R, alleged to be the case, is offered as a reason for the problematic assertion C. Thus a demand for a reason is met by a piece of pur- portedly sound reasonmg. In order to do the job, A must be valid, yet will not count as sound unless it is agreed that belief in R is justified. Now a sceptic, an agnostic, or a rationalist with high standards of argu- ment, might object that A , even if valid, merely shifts the burden of establish- ing credibility from C to R. Accordingly, he demands a reason for thinking</page><page sequence="12">158 Max Black that-jR, i.e., a further argument to show that belief in R is justified. If such a reason, R ' , is supplied, A expands into: C, because R, because R ' (A') But A ' is as vulnerable as A was to a demand for further justification. So the objector contends that we cannot be satisfield with A' , but must move on to A" , and further still, without end. (If no argument will satisfy him but the next, he can never be satisfied.) Traditionally, the way out of this predicament has been to stop at some Rn that allegedly needs no further support - either because its truth is "self-evi- dent" (no sooner clearly understood than intuited as true) or "incorrigible" (belief in its truth guarantees its truth). But when C is some empirical proposi- tion, or some injunction concerning an action (or other "doing") in the real world, it will be impossible to produce such a proof from self-evident first principles or incorrigible sense-datum assertions. 10 This line of thought, as old as Plato, remains a potent incentive to sceptical anti-rationalism. For anyone accepting it may plausibly feel that the "chain of reasons" can be terminated only by some external compulsion, fiat, or arbitrary choice (cf Popper's remarks in section 8 above). In acute instances of this disorder, the sufferer may feel like some character in a story by Kafka, protesting an unmotivated condemnation, who is sent from one functionary to another, only to find at last an Ayatollah who pronounces guilt and an assassin to put an end to the futility of argument. (When Wilde referred to ' ' brute reason ' ' , did he have a similar picture in mind ?) Adequate discussion of the complex issues raised by the infinite regress argument must await another occasion. My present concern is with what Peirce called "real and living doubt" ( Collected Papers, 5.376). I write only for an imagined questioner retaining sufficient common sense and self-knowl- edge to confess that he does not genuinely doubt that he exists, or that he sees a tomato, or such other renewed staples of epistemological debate. (The hyperbolic doubts of Hume, Descartes or their contemporary descendants demand different treatment.) My own position, stated briefly, is that sufferers from hyperbolic pseudo- doubts are illicitly operating with a mathematico-logical model of proof, inspired by Euclids's axiomatic presentation of geometry or its latterday refinements. This perverse inclination to demand mathematically "strict" standards of proof for empirical assertions or for practical injunctions, is, I suggest, strengthened by a seductive metaphor of reasons as supports, which I shall examine in an Appendix. 10 There is a valuable discussion of "The Infinite Regress" in John Passmore, Philosophical Reasoning (London, 1961), chapter 2.</page><page sequence="13">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 159 12. A landing stage and a preview The various views of those who have considered the 4 4 rationality ques- tion" (Why should I be rational?) can be summarised as follows: (1) the question is too incoherent or self-defeating to deserve an answer; (2) the ques- tion makes sense, but can receive no rational answer; (3) [which shows that] rationality must be grounded in something non-rational (faith, hatred of available alternatives, custom, or whatever); (4) alternatively: the impossibil- ity of an answer shows that rationality needs no defense. I have tried in the preceding sections to show that such views rest upon misconceptions and I have urged that the rationality question, when specified by attention to the situation or 4 'stance" of a hypothetical questioner, can sometimes deserve an answer. The time has come to offer what may serve as at least a preliminary sketch of an answer (for a questioner whom I shall imagine to be a ť 4 sceptical anti- rationalist" or an 44 agnostic rationalist "). My strategy will be to describe the most primitive form of reason-using conceivable (common to the 44 lower animals " as well as to homo sapiens ), to consider the consequences of abandoning this practice and finally to sketch how progressively more elaborate and sophisticated exercises of rationality can be built upon the basis of such basic or 44 proto "-rationality. 1 3 . Basic reason-using by humans Consider the following episode: While clambering up a mountain slope, I suddenly notice a large boulder hurtling towards me. I jump to one side - (and tumble into a stream). This is a paradigm case of what I shall call 4 4 basic reason-using" (BR U). In this imagined instance, it would be generally agreed, I hope, that my perception of something's being the case (the rolling boulder), seen as imminently dangerous, prompted evasive action. (I use the colourless word 4 prompted ' to avoid discussing whether the relation between the percep- tion and the action was partly a causal one, as I believe.) In other BRU episodes, such as reaching for a ripe blackberry, the induced expectation is of some positive benefit. A rough definition of a case of BRU might run: prompt action induced by a perception, not necessarily correct, of something per- ceived as imminently beneficial or harmful. I have deliberately chosen as my prime example of BRU an episode in which there was no time for well-articulated thought. What 4 4 passed through my mind" at the moment of peril might be plausibly rendered as 4 4 Ouch! Going to hit me. Jump!" - or something still more disjointed and frag-</page><page sequence="14">1 60 Max Black mentary. But afterwards, of course, I have no trouble at all in providing an articulated version of what I thought and did - along the lines of 44 I saw a large boulder rolling towards me and expected to be hit if I didn't act at once - so I jumped." This full-blown version has the form of a practical enthymeme; in supplying it, I am, as it were, replaying 44 what passed through my mind " in slow motion, with some additional editing. Well-articulated inference, whether from perception or antecedent belief, is comparatively rare in human experience, being normally reserved for diffi- cult or complex problems that demand orderly approaches and critical appraisal of the reliability and strength of the reasons adduced. Commonly, fragmentary expressions of perceptions or thoughts suffice to induce satis- factory conclusions, informally derived. Even the eminently rational delibera- tion of a chess-player will probably run somewhat like this: 4 'That to there? Will be captured - same if go there? - no - OK" (a far cry from the de- corous full sentences of De Grooťs 4 4 protocols ' ') 1 1 . Postulating, accordingly, little more than a kind of telegraphese of frag- mentary visual and verbal images, even in sophisticated exercises of human reasoning, I regard clear cases of human BRU as normally requiring no more than a capacity to articulate and reconstruct reasoning post hoc.{ And even so, a reasoner who is maladroit at retrospective 4 'reconstruction" is not neces- sarily to be censured as an ineffective reason-user.) To return, then, to my original paradigm, I qualify the episode as a case of 44 basic " reason-using, because I view such quasi-automatic response to situa- tions of immediate benefit or risk as necessary for the adequate performance of all but the crudest human reactions (jumping when pricked). Basic reason- using is obviously indispensable for human survival, but basic also for the most elaborate and distinctive manifestations of human intelligence and skill. 14. Quasi-rationality in beasts Consider next the following samples of animal behaviour, each of which might plausibly be regarded as resembling a case of basic human rationality: (i) A bear raises its head while feeding and leaps out of the path of an approaching boulder.

(iii) A dog is seen 4 4 trying to cross" a busy street - looks to either side, darts into the traffic, returns to the sidewalk, etc. 1 1 Adriaan D. de Groot, Thought and Choice in Chess (The Hague, 1965).</page><page sequence="15">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 161 (iv) Some deer, grazing in a sheltered hollow, respond to a distinctive " warning "cry from the "sentinel" posted at the rim by taking to flight. Each episode resembles my earlier paradigm of human "basic reason-using " (the mountain walker and the rolling boulder) in involving anticipation of danger or imminent benefit: animal and human alike suit behaviour to the expected-but-not-yet-occurring. We can think of such anticipatory response as the interpretation of perceptual signs, which as it were enlarges the actor's perceptual field: thus the deer in (iv) behave as if they could peer over the hol- low's rim at the approaching predator. Each actor in our minature dramas responds as if he could actually see in advance what is about to happen. Some readers may find a whiff of anthropomorphism in my references to " anticipation,' ' "warning" and "sign." But I am not imputing in bear or deer mental acts that phenomenally resemble closely what "passes through the mind" of an adult human in a similar situation. (Can we even guess how the world looks to a dog or a horse?) Of course, bears and deer have no concept of a reason or a sign and may well be incapable of producing even the visual images, let alone the fragments of verbal telegraphese, that often mark informal human inference. Above all - not to shirk the obvious - not even the talented chimpanzees now so much in the news can be plausibly expected to exercise our own retrospective power of articulating non-verbal rational action ("I jumped because I saw the boulder rolling") or the reflective self- criticism ("How stupid to ignore the chance of falling into the stream!") required for learning from our mistakes. Granting all this, I still wish to stress the following points that will, I trust, be readily conceded: 1. The animal actor's manifest behaviour may closely resemble human behaviour in like case: we jump aside as the bear does; a child's forays into a busy street do not significantly differ from those of my imagined dog. Indeed, if we indulge the fancy of being transported into the body of another animal - say a pigeon - with human powers of perception and inference unim- paired, our behaviour, for all our cognitive advantages, could not be expected to be better than that of authentic pigeons 12. For evolutionary adaptation can be counted upon to have eliminated, on the whole, any deleterious responses to immediate stimuli. One might say that the "lower animals," given their relatively modest cognitive abilities, behave as if they were as rational as they need to be. 12 In a natural habitat, of course. Our knowledge of an extensive municipal effort to poison pigeons might give us an advantage.</page><page sequence="16">1 62 Max Black 2. Intelligent human behaviour obviously requires the acquisition of auto- matised skills: a child musician laboriously calculating where to place his fing- ers must end by getting the notes rights as unthinkingly as a bird pecking at a seed. It is as if developed human skill requires a return to the spontaneity of merely animal response (releasing mental energy for higher tasks), with habit doing the work of instinct. Given the homology in manifest behaviour of basic human rationality (innate or acquired) and parallel animal behaviour I propose to call the latter exercises of quasi-rationality . 15. Answering Pyrrho Basic reason-using in humans (BRU) and its homologous " quasi-rational- ity" in other animals conduces to survival and well-being, by promoting benefit or warding off harm. But only when the reasons used - or, equival- enti, the sign signified - are well-used: the reason has to be "good," the sign must be recognised to be a true signifier. Conversely, impairment of the requisite inferential capacity, whether by fatigue, organic malfunction, or disease tends to produce frustration of desire, bodily or mental damage or, in extreme cases, death. The price of poor reasoning, whether through mis- perception or erroneous anticipation, can be frustration, hurt or extinction. Given all this, we now have the makings of a rather obvious but com- pelling reply to our imagined questioner, who is dubious about the point of rational behaviour. The prime reason for not trying to discard the "basic rationality" that we can assume Pyrrho to be already practising, since he is alive and in sufficiently good shape to ask disturbing questions, is that to do so invites the risk of disagreeable death. Expressed in our canonical form (sec- tion 4 above), the argumentative reply to the original question takes the form: You should respect "basic reasons" (be basically rational) because not to do so is to expose yourself to almost certain frustration, pain and death (A") Given that Pyrrho is a developed human being, he has the choice of accepting or rejecting the normative conclusion of (A "): he can on principle try to emulate an inarticulate "lower animal", trusting to his own reflexes to keep him out of danger - or, if he is sufficiently doctrinaire, even adopt a fanatical policy of total indifference (a kind of extreme ataraxia), toward the normal perceptual signs of danger or profit. But if so, he had better find some</page><page sequence="17">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 163 riskless environment or trust to friends to keep him out of mischief13. I have already argued that such a prudential argument involves no vicious circular- ity: in offering it, we " presuppose" nothing at all, although we can rea- sonably expect and hope that Pyrrho will understand the argument and feel its force. If not, there is nothing more to be done. 16. Further moves Even if Pyrrho accepts the prudential argument outlined in the last sec- tion, it may be felt that very little has been accomplished. For Pyrrho might well be 4 'basically rational" in our deliberately restricted sense of responding intelligently and prudently to perceptual signs of impending harm or benefit and yet be on the whole somebody who behaves very irrationally: he might have the horse sense to dodge traffic and still believe that he can command the stars and live forever. But in the present project, as in other practical undertakings, the first step can be of extreme importance. Once you can get a troubled questioner to see the point of basic rationality, the ground has been laid for an examination of what is involved in having a (basic) reason for con- duct, and so by degrees an unfolding of the need for a more comprehensive conception of rationality. Such rational development of the point of rational thought and conduct might well commence with the implications of human needs and opportunities as a social and literate animal, focussing perhaps upon the kind of implicit reasoning involved in talking to and listening to others. And so by gradual steps to the consideration of vexed questions about the limits of rationality, its relations to faith and revelation. But this complex task is too much to commence at the end of what is already a long paper. I shall be content if the line of argument can realistically return my imagined questioner to the condition of one who affirms ' 'basic" rationality, leaving his further induction into the human race, as it were, for another and more ample occasion. 13 According to Diogenes Laertius, the Greek sceptic, Pyrrho of Elis, who believed "that custom and convention govern human action" was indifferent to common hazards, "but was kept out of harm's way by his friends who . . . used to follow closely after him" - and he lived to be nearly ninety! (. Lives of Eminent Philosophers, ed. R.D. Hicks (London, 1925) vol. 2, p. 245, quoted from Arthur W. Burks, Chance, Cause, Reason [Chicago, 1977] p. 137.</page><page sequence="18">164 Max Black 17. The professor's reply [Since I opened this paper with an imagined question, 1 shall, at the cost of some repetition, end with an imagined response.] ' Why should I be rational? ' That is like asking 4 Why should I breathe? ' And one answer to that is 'It's harder than you might think to stop - and stupid to try if one isn't tired of living.' (There are less painful ways of com- mitting suicide.) You can't see the analogy? Well consider. You were born an animal - an extraordinary one, to be sure - and remain so. I too. So here we are, too ť 4 educated " to be good animals, too ignorant to be satisfactory humans. Now our animal capacities to survive and satisfy our needs (by breathing, eating, mating, and so on), however modified by social 4 'acculturation," strongly depend upon a primitive repertoire of inferential skills for recognising and responding to threat of harm and promise of benefit. We were born able to treat sights, sounds, and scents as signs of impending events of concern; and all our learned responses rely upon this primitive survival-and-satisfaction kit. (If you see a bicycle rolling your way, you step aside; when the fire blazes suddenly, you flinch; the sight of a ripe blackberry sets your hand moving.) Such anticipatory activity, however spontaneously and unconsciously performed, is already an exercice of primitive rationality of a very basic sort. All distinctively sophisticated human performance depends upon basic sign- reading - as ability to play a Chopin prelude requires unthinking ability to strike the correct keys. An act of minimal rationality , as I shall call it, can be viewed as an episode of compressed reasoning, capable of subsequent articulation. On the model of: "That bicycle will hit me if I don't move; so, I shall jump [Does so ! "] In this reconstruction, the ' so ' (or such a surrogate as 'therefore,' or 'because') stamps the episode as one of inference to a practical conclusion. The most basic use of a reason is to reason from a perceptual sign to what it signifies. When a "lower animal" reacts to a sign portending immediate harm or benefit, it behaves to all outward appearance as we do: I jump away from the bicycle and so does my dog. But I have a reason for jumping and know that I have; my dog simply jumps. I call his action quasi-rational because I applaud his behaviour as life-preserving or life-enhancing. (He may be "dumb" but he can't be stupid; that is our liability as reasoning human animals). He acts as if he were guided by reasons; but we can act not quasi-rationally but fully so. Forgive me for reminding you of the enormous practical benefits gen- erated by the sophisticated rational superstructure that we erect on the</page><page sequence="19">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 165 foundation of "minimal rationality." (It takes a human, reasoning, animal to forecast tomorrow's weather, even if he uses a computer and still gets it wrong.) Are you, as a human animal, doomed to be minimally rational (to shun danger and seek pleasure, as mindlessly as any dumb brute)? No. You may, if you wish, regard even minimal rationality as a disease of civilization. As a child you had no choice, but now you are free to try divesting yourself of your acquired habits of recognising and respecting reasons. But the price will be heavy. It is too late to rely upon animal instinct and unrealistic to become someone's domesticated pet. To fight against even the "quasi-rationality" of speechless animals would be to choose deliberate self- stupification. To purge one's mind of reasoning and its requisite conceptual and cognitive skills in order to live in the immediate present is to court the horrible apathy of the catatonic. Your life would then be predictably short and nasty - remember the "wild boy of Aveyron". Anybody who ignores traffic signals or hurtling bicycles, on the doctrinaire ground that attention to reasons is prejudice and superstition, won't live very long, without the protection of friends or the security of a consistently beneficial setting. Short of seclusion on some island of lotus eaters or, more plausibly, in some padded cell, the price of principled irrationalism is a messy and early death. You wouldn't go that far? You are not that committed to principle? Well, it's your choice. I hope you will be more fortunate in your friends than in your principles. Let me hear from you again, if you are still around to send greet- ings. APPENDIX Reasons as metaphorical supports A reason (something-that-is-the-case, a circumstance) is so naturally conceived as "supporting" its probandum (as I shall call it) that we normally have little occasion to examine the backing metaphor. Yet the word 'support', considered out of context, primarily evokes physical support, as when a but- tress props up a cathedral wall. It is worth taking a close look at the back- ground metaphor 14. 14 I am using here a technique explained and defended in my "More About Metaphor," Dialéctica, vol. 31 (1977), especially pp. 443-445.</page><page sequence="20">1 66 Max Black The metaphorical statement, "A reason is a support", determines some- thing like the following implication-complex in its secondary subject: (51) A support is a material body; (52) that props up another body (prevents it from falling): (53) or helps to do so. The parallel claims about the primary subject would be: (RI) A reason is a circumstance (something-that-is-the-case) ( R2 ) providing sufficient evidence for a probandum's truth; (R3) or helping to do so (by raising the probandum's likelihood). When so elaborated, the metaphor looks far-fetched; evidence for some- thing is not much like force exerted; staying upright (not falling) has little resemblance to being true; and so forth. My purpose, however, is not to dis- parage this rickety metaphor, but only to consider how far the alleged infinity of reasons is paralleled by a corresponding series of material supports. Three points deserve special emphasis. 1 . Although a material support will often itself be supported or propped up (prevented from falling), there never is, nor could there be, an infinite series of progressively remoter supports. The roof of a house is supported by its walls; they in turn by the foundation; and it by soil or rock; but proceeding in this way we get no further than the whole earth, which neither needs nor receives any support. The old fantasy of the supporting elephant, itself sup- ported by a tortoise, after which there are "tortoises all the way" is no more than a joke. 2. Whether the walls do actually support the roof, in our illustration, is determined hie et nunc , by considering what would happen if the walls were removed, and is quite independent of whether the walls are themselves sup- ported. (Similarly, in the important case of the alleged infinite regress of cau- ses: whether A is a necessary cause of B is determined by a local inspection of the consequences of imagining A removed and is quite independent of the issue whether A is an intermediate or a "first' 'cause.) 3. In the case of bodily support, it is easy to describe - contrary to initial intuition - a system of reciprocally supporting supports. An amusing example would be that of a number of persons standing in a circle, each with his back half turned to the next: on a word of command, all lower themselves and hey presto all are sitting, each supported by one neighbour while simulta- neously supporting another. (If one member of the ring were removed all would collapse). A still simpler example would be that of three posts leaning against one another to form the framework of a wigwam - or two leaning boards forming a hutch open at both ends. In all such cases, the postulate of a</page><page sequence="21">"Why Should I Be Rational?" 167 serial arrangement of the interacting bodies is violated, without detriment to the stability of of the entire system. The three features of systems of material support briefly described above might be dubbed: (1) finiteness of support-chains; (2) proximate or "local" influence of support; and (3) reciprocal influence. In view of the merely analogical resemblances between material supports and supporting reasons , we cannot assume without examination that all three features can characterise rational support (support of " probanda" by reasons). But in fact they do. 1 . As in the case of the unsupported earth, able to support bodies resting upon it, we can envisage unsupported reasons able to support a probandum. Let R be a reason for the probandum, P. Then whether R really does ' "sup- port" P, i.e. whether the circumstance that-/? tends to make P more likely to be true than if there were no circumstance, depends only on the relation bet- ween R and P. Thus the fact - if it is a fact - that a hundred balls drawn at random from an urn (with replacements) were all black (R) itself supports the probandum that most of the balls in the urn were black (P), without reference to any reasons for taking that R to be a fact. (I might simply be convinced, and correctly, that the R in question was a fact, but my conviction is not itself a reason for so regarding R.) 2. The last example illustrates tha analogue, in the case of rational sup- port, of my previous claim that the reality of material support is establishable "hie et nunc". Of course, we cannot literally see that the above-cited sampling fact supports the urn-generalisation. The link between R and P is a generally accepted principle about the probative influence of a random sample. Still, the analogue of the second feature seems to be sound: so long as the sampling- fact really is a fact, it renders the generalisation-probandum more credible than otherwise, regardless of the support that the R in question might or might not receive. 3. For an analogue of the "reciprocating" effect of mutually supporting bodies, we need only to produce an example of three propositions each two of which entail the third (which might be called a "prologism" - a kind of opposite to the more familiar "antilogism"). The following would be such an example: Let a = n is a multiple of 6 b-n is a multiple of 1 5 c = n is a multiple of 10 Now if ďs truth and b's truth were independently established, a&amp;b would be conclusive) reason for asserting c - and similarly for b&amp;c etc. (Examples not</page><page sequence="22">168 Max Black involving strict entailing relations between the members of a "prologism" are left as an exercise for the reader.) I hope the foregoing discussion, incomplete as it is, may serve to inhibit what might be called the 4 'fallacy of misplaced regression", i.e. the view that something of the form aRb cannot be known to be true (or cannot even be jus- tifiably asserted) unless we also know that for some c, we have cRa and so on ad infinitum. To believe that an empirical proposition cannot be rationally supported unless an infinity of other propositions are already known to be justifiably assertible is really as absurd as believing that one cannot identify somebody's parents without knowing his whole family tree.
