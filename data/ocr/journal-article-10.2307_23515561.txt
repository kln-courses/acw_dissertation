<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS BY ANTIOCHUS IV Jonathan A. Goldstein Iowa City Antiochus IV's treatment of the Jews was a puzzle already in ancient times and has remained so.1 I wish to suggest a solution to the puzzle. Antiochus followed, not his own Graeco-Macedonian patterns, but Roman patterns, learned during the years between 189 and 175 that he was a hostage there.2 Antiochusי mania for things Roman is well attested. What did he learn at Rome ? He learned that Rome had become a superpower through widely extending both Roman citizenship and lesser privileges throughout the Roman republican system in Italy. Antiochus would do the same: he would establish an "Antiochene" republic, analogous to the Roman republic, and he would extend its citizenship widely, even to Jews of Jerusalem.3 Antiochus also observed in 188 how Rome brutally suppressed the Bacchanalia, a cult viewed as subversive by the ruling circles.4 Should any cult look subversive to Antiochus IV within his realm, the king could be expected to use Roman methods against it. Antiochus5 strange relations with the Jews fall into three periods: First, there is the attempt to confer the civic privileges of his Antiochene republic on "liberal-minded" Jews of Judaea, under the rival high priests Jason and Menelaus, from 175 to 169.5 During this period pious Jews rose in violence, not against the king, but against Menelaus, who had embezzled temple property.6 The pious may also have risen in violence against Jews so wicked as to violate the Torah by accepting Antiochene civic privileges. Such privileges surely involved participation in Graeco Macedonian rituals. 1. See E. Bickerman, Der Gott der Makkabäer (Berlin: Schocken, 1937), pp. 17-49; V. A.

GOLDSTEIN Second, there is Antiochus1 attempt from 169 to 167 to deal with what appeared to be political rebellion, centered in the factions of the privileged Antiochene Jews of Jerusalem, gathered around the rival claimants to the high-priesthood.7 Third, there is Antiochus' attempt from 167 to 164 to treat the Jews as the Romans had treated the adherents of the Bacchanalia. Antiochus' procedure point-for-point followed the Roman model. Antiochus was unable to disentangle the threads of politics and religion which had turned quiet Judaea into a hotbed of violence. To him the religion itself looked subversive. Detailed proof of all this is in my forthcoming commentary to First and Second Maccabees. Here I shall deal only with the third period, the perse cution from 167 to 164. The Romans and Antiochus faced parallel problems: how could they curb long-recognized religions that only now appeared to be subversive? It was well known how Bacchus and the God of the Jews punished their enemies.8 To avoid offending both god and man, the Romans circulated propaganda, insisting that the Bacchanalia were not only degenerate but foreign, a recent import to Italy, though the consul himself had to admit that the cult of Bacchus had long existed there.9 The contradiction could be resolved: there was the legitimate cult of Bacchus on the Aventine hill in Rome,10 as opposed to the impious Bacchanalia. Antiochus, too, appears to have claimed that there was a legitimate Jewish cult of the God of Heaven, as opposed to the impious, subversive, degenerate, and possibly foreign accretions which had turned the religion of Moses into a religion of rebels. Indeed, even a pagan would have had difficulty understanding Antiochus IV's policy if his aim had been to force the Jews to abandon their own religion and adopt a Greek or Syro-Phoenician cult.11 Pagans readily conceded that the God of the Jews was a god.

Antiochus found Josiah and Ezra and the prophets who came after Moses to be corrupters who had turned the religion of Moses into a cult of rebels. Indeed, Greek intellectuals like Hecataeus of Abdera, Theophrastus, and Poseidonius believed Moses taught the Jews that the encompassing heavenly sphere was God and that no cult images in animal or human form were to be used in His worship. Throughout, these Greek intel lectuals held, Moses taught a rational religion of which they approved. They strongly disapproved of "abuses" introduced by later successors of Moses, such as Jewish "tyranny" (i.e., intolerance of pagan practices on Jewish soil?) and the dietary laws and circumcision. Theophrastus was head of the school of Aristotle at Athens; Athens and the school may well have been the center of comparative religious studies of the Hellenistic age. When Ptolemy I wished to revitalize the cult of Sarapis in Egypt, he used an expert from Athens.13 Antiochus IV appears to have done likewise in "purifying" the religion of the Jews: he imported an Athenian expert.14 Antiochus, however, did not have to follow blindly the traditions represented by his Athenian expert or by Hecataeus, Theophrastus, and Poseidonius. Evidence in the ancient accounts suggests that he also drew on Jewish sources, perhaps Greek versions of the Scriptures, to reconstruct the uncorrupted Religion of Israel. Some groups of heterodox Jews ptobably still survived with traditions going back to the cults condemned by the prophets and the Torah.15 Antiochus is likely to have received information from such Jews, either directly or from observations of them made by Greek 12. E. Bickerman, Institutions des Seleucides (Paris: Geuther, 1938) pp. 250-251. 13. See M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion (2d ed.; München; C. H. Beck, 1961), II, pp. 156-158. 14.

The close parallels between the imposed cult and observances condemned by Jeremiah and Ezekiel and those known to have existed at the Jewish community of Elephantine (see below, pp. 145 ff.) strongly suggest that a small community of such "syncretistic Jews" still existed and served Antiochus IV as informants. See now M. Smith, Palestinian Parties and Politics that Shaped the Old Testament (New York and London: Columbia University Press, 1971), pp. 82-98. The subject of the continued existence of heterodox Jews from the time of Jeremiah on deserves further treatment.</page><page sequence="4">138 JONATHAN A. GOLDSTEIN anthropologists. The ancient accounts of the cult imposed on the Jews by Antiochus are difficult to interpret, and we must study them closely. There is little difficulty in understanding the Greek name given to the God of the Jews. If a non-Greek people worshiped a God of Heaven, Greeks would automatically name him "Zeus". Greek-speaking Jews themselves would do so if there was no danger of taking "Zeus" to be the name of an idol.16 Hence, though Antiochus seems to have been impres sed with the Dionysiac traits of Judaism, he did not rename the great Jewish God as "Dionysus" but as "Zeus Olympius".17 Though some A small community of syncretistic Jews could have passed unnoticed by Greek travelers such as Hecataeus of Abdera. Even as Antiochus' informants such a com munity could conceivably have been ignored by the monotheistic Jews who suffered under Antiochus. Nevertheless, no ancient observer mentions the role of such infor mants in the imposed cult. Since monotheistic Jews were never reluctant to voice loud condemnation of "sinners," this silence suggests that the syncretistic Jewish informants were so insignificant in number that they verged on non-existence. The only possible contemporary references to such informants are the "deserters of the Holy Covenant" at Dan xi 30 and the "people of a foreign god" at Dan xi 39, but both are connected with the expedition of the Mysarch and the establishment of the Akra, not with the proclamation of the imposed cult. See chapters 2 and 6 of the introduction to my forthcoming commentary on I Sc II Mace. One might read Dan xi 30, "And he [Antiochus] shall return and give a sympathetic hearing to those who deserted the Holy Covenant," as showing that the seer ascribed the imposed cult to suggestions of heterodox Jews. Josephus (AJ xii. 5. 1. 240-41) appears so to have interpreted Dan xi 30, but Dan xi 30 refers to events of 168, the year of the Roman ultimatum to Antiochus to withdraw from Egypt, not, as Josephus would have it,to the introduction of Antiochene civic institutions at Jerusalem, which occurred long before the sack of 169. Prophyry (apud Jerome Commentarii in Dani elem to xi 30) made the same error as Josephus. In fact, however, the verse is connected neither with the introduction of the Hellenizing "Antiochene" institutions nor with the proclamation of the imposed cult, but rather with the expedition of the Mysarch. Antiochus may indeed have used the advice of heterodox Jews, but the author of First Maccabees and Jason of Cyrene readily speak of Jewish sinners. Why do they not ascribe the imposed cult to the suggestions of heterodox Jews? Why does Jason of Cyrene instead mention only Antiochus5 Athenian expert (II vi 1)? Clearly because the Hellenizers, too were victims! From the words of the men of the Akra and their supporters at I Macc vi 23 one can deduce only that the speakers obeyed Antiochus' decrees, not that they suggested the decrees or even welcomed them. 16.

Although Poseidonius18 and other Greek theorists approved of the absolutely monotheistic Jewish worship and its prohibition of images, Antiochus apparently did not share their opinions. Antiochus did not, indeed, require the use of anthropomorphic images, but he found other means equally heinous to pious Jews, who were to view as Antiochus' worst infamy his desecration of the temple altar by affixing to it some kind of idolatrous equipment. The prophesies of Daniel are the works of contemporaries. The unintelligible and ungrammatical character of the extant text may be the result of mistaken vowels. Good sense can be made of the original consonantal text. In Daniel, the idolatrous equipment is called fäbä ("host"; viii 12, 13, xl), siqqüfim mswmm ("abominations from desolation" [?]; ix 27), hassiqqüf msmm ("the abomination from desolation" [?]; xi 31), siqqüf Swmm ("abomination of desolation" [ ?]; xii 11),19 and smm ("desolation'' [?]; ix 27 end). Though the author of the Testament of Moses had an ambiguous attitude toward the second temple,20 he revered it enough to resent bitterly the desecration. From the obscure and mutilated text of his prophesy (viii 18. FGH 87, F 70-Strabo xvi. 2. 35. 19. Hebrew grammar forbids rendering the phrases at Dan ix 27 and xi 31 as "abomin ation(s) of desolation" or "abomination(s) that make desolate," The usage of msmm at xi 31 frustrates the attempt in the Revised Standard Version to construe mswmm at ix 27 as subject of the clause and render, "Upon the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate." The only acceptable alternative is to revocalize the Hebrew as misSömem, as in our suggested translation. The author of a variant to the Greek version of Theodotion also took the mem of mSwmm as meaning "from," rendering apo aphanismou. Josephus, too, may well have taken the mem as meaning "from." To judge by AJ xii. 7. 6. 322, he took "desolation" in Daniel to be a noun of action, meaning "the act of desolating." He seems there to paraphrase it by the verb "they devastate" (Kata lyousin). He may well have read Dan xi 31 as meaning, "they shall make an abomination while devastating," and Dan ix 27 as meaning, "on a wing [ ?] [there shall be] abomina tions during the devastation," and Dan xii 11 as meaning, "after the making of abomin ation and devastation/' For ntn as "make" in such contexts, see Jer ix 10. For m with the participle as meaning "while" or "during," see E. J. Kutscher, "Studies in Galilean Aramaic," Tarbip, XXI-XXIII (5710-1949-50), 33-37 (in Hebrew). 20. See the introduction to my forthcoming commentary on I &lt;£ II Macc.</page><page sequence="6">140 JONATHAN A. GOLDSTEIN 4-5) we may perhaps learn that Jews were forced to carry heavy idols and affix (?) them to the altar.21 As for First Maccabees, at i 54 we learn that Antiochus IV had an "abomination of desolation" (bdelygma er emöseös) constructed upon ihe sacrificial altar of the temple. At i 59 we learn that sacrifices were offered upon the "pagan altar" which stood upon the Jewish sacrificial altar. At iv 43 we learn that the priests who purified the sanctuary first removed to an unclean place "the stones of loathsomeness."22 These stones are sharply distinguished from the defiled stones of the Jewish altar itself, which were reverently hidden away (I iv 44-46). The verb used to speak of the stones of the altar as "defiled" usually means "made unclean." The abridged history in Second Maccabees says nothing of structures upon the altar but speaks of the defilement of the temple in Jerusalem, of how it was renamed the temple of Zeus Olympius, how prostitution was practiced in the temple precincts, how idolatrous objects were brought in,23 and how the Jews were forced to make processions in honour of Dionysus on Dionysus1 festivals (vi 2-7). Finally, the sixth-century Christian writer, John Malalas of Antioch, perhaps drawing on traditions and records of his home city, says that 21. "Nam illi in eis punientur in tormentis et igne et ferro, et cogentur palam baiulare idola eorum, inquinata quomodo sunt pariter continentibus ea. Et a torquentibus illos pariter cogentur stimulis blasfemare uerbum contumeliose, nouissime post haec et leges quod haberent supra altarium suum." The words following the last comma are ungram matical, for a neuter singular singular relative pronoun has as its apparent antecedent a feminine plural noun, and a verb in the imperfect subjunctive follows a main verb in the future indicative. Perhaps we may ascribe the irregular sequence of tenses to the inelegant Latin translator. The long sequence of verbs listing the dreadful acts which Jews will be compelled to perform suggests that yet another verb should stand where leges ('"laws") does, perhaps locare or ligare ("place," "affix"). If so, we may translate the passage, "For therein they shall be punished with torture and fire and sword and shall be forced publicly to haul their idols, polluted as they are like those who hold them. By their torturers they shall be compelled to enter their secret place [5c. the Holy of Holies], and by whips they shall be compelled to blaspheme the Word with abusive language, and finally, after these atrocities, even to place over their altar that which they were holding." Antiochus' act of desecration was all the more heinous because he made Jews haul the idolatrous objects and fasten them to the temple altar. See TB'Abodah zarah 42a (statement of Raba) and M. 'Abodah zarah 3:5. 22. Tous lithous tou miasmou. "miasmou" at I Macc iv 43 is not "uncleanness," since in the same verse "akatharton" renders "unclean." The related word miasma renders liqqu? ("abomination") at Jer xxxii (Greek xxxix) 34. My use of the word "loathsomeness" is an effort to have a synonym for "abomination." 23. See my remarks on II Macc vi 4 in my forthcoming commentary.</page><page sequence="7">TEWS' PERSECUTION BY ANTIOCHUS IV 141 Antiochus turned the Jewish temple into a temple of Zeus Olympius and Athene.24 From these sources we can learn the following: an idolatrous structure was built upon the sacrificial altar of the Jewish temple. Viewed from one point of view it was a single "abomination," and perhaps it was a pagan altar, but from other points of view it was multiple: "abominat ions/' "stones," or a "host." The "abominations" were associated with something which could be called "desolation." Nowhere in this con nection is a statue mentioned in any source earlier than Porphyry,25 who wrote late in the third Christian century. All these clues may well be correct. They fit into a coherent pattern. Let us examine them more closely. Probably least understood by interpreters ancient and modern is the evidence of Dan viii. Consider the following new interpretation of Dan viii 8-12. According to the seer, from the Seleucid kingdom, one of the four Hellenistic monarchies which inherited parts of Alexander's empire (Dan viii 8), shall come a king (the "little horn") so arrogant that he will expand his kingdom southward and bring his armies into Egypt and into the Holy Land. More; he will presume to lord it over the stars, the Host of Heaven (Dan viii 9-1 la); i.e., he shall presume to give prescriptions about the cults of celestial deities. Worse yet, he will claim to have in his control fallen stars (Dan viii 10b), i.e. meteorites.26 The traditional vowels of the Hebrew text of Dan viii 11-12 give rise to an ungrammatical text extremely difficult to interpret.22 A different 24.

In vs. 11 higdil suddenly introduces a masculine verb into a context where the subject (the "little horn") has been feminine, hrym, in defiance of the vowel-letter, is vocalized hüram. "The place of his [or "its"] sanctuary was overthrown" is con trary to historical fact. Nowhere else in the contemporary apocalypses or in First and Second Maccabees do we hear that Antiochus destroyed any structure in the temple; rather, he built additions onto the existing structures. In vs. 12 the verbs suddenly become feminine again, though the apparent subject, "host," is masculine.</page><page sequence="8">142 JONATHAN A. GOLDSTEIN vocalization results in good grammar and excellent sense28 and can be rendered as follows: 11. It [the "little horn" = Antiochus IV] grew, until it equaled the Prince of the Host, and beyond; it removed the Continual Offering and cast it from its holy base [the altar]. 12. It shall place a Host as a despite to the Continual Offering,29 because of the sin. Who is the "Prince of the Host,'י with whom Antiochus IV vied in his arrogance and passed beyond? Interpreters have been accustomed to take the works as referring to the God of the Jews. This interpretation can hardly be correct. Could the pious Jewish seer have spoke of a presumptuous king "growing to equal the LORD and even beyond"? Even if the seer could have done, so there is evidence that he did not, for, when he turns to speak of his own God, he calls him not "Prince" but "Prince of Princes" (Dan vii 25) and says, not that the presumptuous king will grow to equal Him, but that he will 'attack" of "rebel against', the Prince of Princes. The Host in this context is the Host of Heaven; hence, the "Prince" or "Commander" of the Host is naturally taken to be the sun.30 Antiochus IV was the first Seleucid king to have regularly issued coins portraying his own head with the crown of rays, which was the normal attribute 28. 11. we'ad Sar haffäbä hag del ümimmennü; härem hattämid w'haStek mikkan miqdäiö. 12. w'fäbä tinten 'al hattämid bappeSa' [or b'pesa'].

The meteorites, being a "host" could be referred to as a collective singular "abomination" (especially if they were all contained in one framework) or as plural "abominations" or "stones." What of the passages connecting the meteorites with "desolation"? The word smm could be a contemptuous deformation of the Phoenician word for "heaven" (sämem). Some scholars assume that Daniel's "abomination of heaven" referred to the Phoenician deity Ba'alsämem, the "Lord of Heaven," who was identified with the Greek Zeus.32 Howewever, there is no reason to assume that Antiochus was imposing a specifically Phoenician cult on the Jews. In contemptuous references to idolatry by Israelites, siqqus ("abomination") is always used as predic ate, never as a substitute for the name of a pagan god.33 In the seer's time, the Hebrew word for "heaven", sämayim, could have been pronounced exactly the same as "desolation" (sömem) by many Jews whose pronunciation was substandard.34 Pious Jews, like the author of First Maccabees, used the word "Heaven" to refer to their own God. Those who used purist pronunciation seem to have been glad to use the vulgar pronunciation, sömem, to refer contemptuou sly to the origin of Antiochus' meteorites and express their revulsion. If so, we may see through the disguise imposed on the facts by the language choosen by pious Jews, and we can recognize in the "abominations from desolation" abominations from the sky, meteorites to be used as idolatrous objects of worship. 31.

GOLDSTEIN In setting up such a structure of meteorites to be worshiped, Antiochus would not have been an innovator. Indeed, such stones as representations of a deity or containers of his presence are abundantly attested in the Bible and in Phoenician and Syrian cults.35 Jacob,s "Bethel" (־= "house of God") is not said to have been a meteorite but appears to have been just such a stone containing the presence of the Deity; Jacob set it up as a cultic upright stone or pillar (ma$?ebäh)3e and the role of such stones in early Israelite religion is an important and complicated subject. It is clear from the sources on the persecution that the cult-stones were plural, and from the pagan parallels we learn that each meteorite could represent a different god.37 At least three gods, Zeus, Athene, and Dion ysus, are mentioned in the sources.38 There is good reason to believe that these are all the gods of the imposed "Jewish" cult. There was a strong tendency among the Phoenicians to worship gods in families of three, consisting of a father-god, a mother-goddess, and their son ;9ל correspondingly, Phoenician cult-stones often appear standing upon altars in groups of three.40 Here, too, Antiochus may have intended to restore illicit Jewish rites condemned by the prophets, rites which he believed to have been part of the original religion of Moses. 35. It is remarkable that Elias Bickerman (Der Gott der Makkabäer, [Berlin: Schocken, 1937], pp. 90-109) derived almost the same picture of the cult imposed by Antiochus and did so solely from the study of Phoenician and Syrian parallels, without interpreting Daniel.

In Egyptian texts 'Anath is called "Lady of Heaven" (nbt pf).42 At Tyre around 676 B.C. 'Anath was the consort of Ba'al-§aphon (=Aliyan-Ba'al)43 Pious Israelites gave to their own deity the attributes of Aliyan-Ba'al44 Jeremiah angrily censured Israelites who appear to have also given 'Anath to their God as consort, under the name "Queen of Heaven."45 Since many Jews at the time of the persecution called their God "Hea ven", among them the author of First Maccabees, "Queen of Heaven" would be an appropriate name for His consort. One might then look to have the God of the Jews called "King of Heaven," but he is not so called in the Hebrew Bible.46 Among heterodox Jews and Samaritans the teachings about Athene or "Wisdom," the consort of God, may have survived down to the rise of the Simonian gnostics, early in the 41.

GOLDSTEIN Christian era.47 Though among the Phoenicians 'Anath was known only as "Lady of the lofty Heaven" and Asherath was the Queen of Heaven 48 the cult imposed on the Jews was theoretically a purified Judaism, not an import from Phoenicia. The one Israelite adult male deity, the LORD, absorbed almost all the powers and epithets of the Phoenician adult male deities, El and 'Elyün and the Lord of Heaven and Ba'al, rider of the clouds. Just so, Jeremiah's contemporaries may have believed in only one adult female deity, consort of their male God, ascribing to her the powers of all the Phoenician female deities. This tendency to fuse the adult gods of each sex into a single deity is visible in Phoenicia itself.49 The third god ot the imposed cult was "Dionysus." In Hellenistic and Roman times there was a strong tendency for the young god of a Syro-Phoenician triad to be identified with Dionysus or to take on the traits of Dionysus, even when he bore the name of another Greek god, as did the Hermes of Ba'albek-Heliopolis. Dionysus was a young god who died a violent death and returned to life.50 The tendencies which would link youthful Syro-Phoenician "third gods" to Dionysus and to Antiochus' meteorites existed long before. For example, in Phoenicia a famous young god who seasonally died and returned to life was Adonis, whose very name ("Adon" = "Lord") was used by pious Jews to refer totheir God.51 There is evidence that Adonis was the son of El (Greek 47. Simon, the "First God," had as his consort Athene or "First Thought" (Ennoia)= "wisdom" (Sophia); see Irenaeus Contra haereses i 23, Vol. VII, cols. 670-73 Migne. Simon's own name may have been taken as a play on the Hebrew and Aramaic words for "heaven." See R. M.

Fusion of adult male gods appears quite early at Tyre; see Du Mesnil, Revue de l'historie des religions, CLXIV, 140-41.

Though most of the sources on the death and resurrection of young Dionysus are late, the belief was well established long before the time of Antiochus IV. See H.

Adonis was later worshiped at Antioch53 and may well have been in Antiochus' time. Adonis was identified with Dionysus 54 and also with Mesopotamian Tammuz.55 Just as Jeremiah's rebukes let us know that Israelites worshiped the Queen of Heaven, so Ezekiel's denunciations let us know that Israelites worshiped Tammuz.56 The imposition of cult-prostitutes mentioned at II Mace vi 4 confirms our theory that Antiochus installed the worship of the Queen of Heaven and of a counterpart of Adonis. Cultic prostitution was usually a part of the worship of female, not male deities.6"7 However, prostitution was a part of the worship of Adonis.58 Here, too, Antiochus could have believed he was restoring rites which the prophets had "wrongly" eliminated. Certainly, the patriarch Judah himself did not hesitate to use a cult-prostitute (qedesäh),59 and the prohibition of cult-prostitutes occurs only in Deuteronomy (xxiii 18). Throughout, Antiochus claimed he was honouring the God of the Jews, a God unknown to his ancestors; along with "restoring His consort and child" the king probably embellished His temple with rich gifts (Dan xi 38). I Macc iii 48 probably means Antiochus' agents tried to convince the Jews that texts proving the imposed cult was indeed the original religion of Israel were to be found in the Torah itself.60 Thus Antiochus imposed upon the Jews a cult he believed to be the true Judaism. As the Romans suppressed the Bacchanalia by cruel war on the adherents of a religion believed to be subversive, so Antiochus waged war on pious Jews. As the Romans imposed their view of what the cult of Bacchus should be, so Antiochus imposed his view of the cult of the God of Heaven. Unlike the adherents of the Bacchanalia, we are here today to attest that the Jews prevailed. 52. Du Mesnil, Etudes, pp. 58-59, 107. 53. Ammianus Marcellinus xxii. 9. 5. 54.
