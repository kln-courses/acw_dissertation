<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATTHEW ARNOLD AND THE POETICS OF BELIEF SOME IMPLICATIONS OF Literature and Dogma EPIFANIO SAN JUAN, JR. CAMBRIDGE, MASS. ALTHOUGH Matthew Arnold, in his disquisitions on faith and belief, never used the word "myth" as literary criticism defines it today, yet his whole approach to the spiritual crisis of modern times derives from an implicit assumption that man cannot live without myths.' In "On the Modern Element in Literature," he voiced man's need of an adequate intelligence of his situation. To comprehend the collective life of humanity, past and present, in all its complex interrelatedness - such is, to Arnold, the essence of moral and intellectual deliverance, the necessity for an age of "multitudinous" facts. On his insight into the Zeitgeist rests Arnold's call for a new religious or, more precisely, mythopoeic orientation of man's consciousness. His analysis of disbelief is premised on the changes not only in the outward circumstances of life but also in man's psychological make-up: That miracles, when fully believed, once felt by men in general to be a source of authority, it is absurd to deny. But the belief is losing its strength. It is what we call the Time-Spirit which is sapping the proof from miracles - it is the Zeitgeist itself. Whether we attack them or not, whether we defend them, does not much matter. The human race, as its experience widens, is turning away from them.2 In effect, the magical world-view, the belief that spirits somehow control events, is losing its value in providing man a principle for the organization of his experiences. Arnold recognized how the scientific world-picture, brought about by man's increasing knowledge and command over nature, has radically neutralized nature and alienated the self from its surroundings.

But now the belief in Christianity, founded on the ruling myth of Christ, is weakening. And thus a sense of the futility of all aspirations afflicts man. According to M. Schorer: "Belief organizes experience not because it is rational but because all belief depends on a controlling imagery, and rational belief is the intellectual formalization of that imagery." 4 Myth, then, serves as the controlling image which attributes meaning and value to facts, which unites in a central symbolic pattern the diverse elements of temporal existence. Arnold real- ized, too, that scientific knowledge answers the "how" and not the "what" and "why" of things. Actually, when man engages in the quest for the "what" and "why" of things, he is searching not for the objective validity of knowledge but, rather, for an emotional assurance of the practicality of concepts that he wants to enter- tain. Pure cognition, therefore, has little or no direct bearing upon what man should do or what he should feel. Feelings, at- titudes, and behavior - in short, man's psychological needs con- stitute the sources of whatever he supposes himself to be know- ing. What he is and what the world is - ancient, deeply-rooted questions - will confront man always, so long as he is finite and mortal: That the spirit of man should entertain hopes and anticipations, beyond what it actually knows and can verify, is quite natural. Human life could not have the scope and depth and progress it has, were this otherwise. It is natural, too, to make these hopes and anticipations give in their turn support to the simple and humble experience which was their original ground.5 3,.. . this strange disease of modern life/With its sick hurry, its divided aims"; see Kenneth Allott, Matthew Arnold (London, 1955), p. 25.

Also, it is the experience of satisfaction and peace man feels after having done something in obedience to his conscience. Using Goethe's term "Aberglaube" to designate unverifiable beliefs, Arnold conceives of myth as the "Aberglaube" of Scrip- tures: "Extra-belief, that which we hope, augur, imagine, is the poetry of life, and has the rights of poetry." 6 Christianity is mythical when it furnishes an imaginal pattern which depicts the fundamental unity and identity of all human experiences. On this assumption Arnold endeavored to interpret the Scriptures as a product of the mythopoeic or imaginative activity of man. At the outset, he asserts: "To understand that the language of the Bible is fluid, passing, and literary, not rigid, fixed, scientific is the first step towards a right understanding of the Bible." ' To take the Bible as a literal rendition of objective facts or states of affairs is to misconstrue its nature. Using language as an emotive agency to evoke feelings, the Bible seeks to arouse in us, through the affective potency of words, a sense of identity with "a power not ourselves." Authorities on hermeneutics have recurrently observed that mythical pattern can be revealed through sensory images, e.g., the aural image of Ra, Jehovah, Allah. Such poetry, primordial and nominative, testifies to the magical use of words in primitive poetry. Indeed, poetic power largely inheres in the magical efficacy of the poetic image considered identical with a feeling- value, "the feeling-value of the archetype, of the numinous what- ever-it-is that demands a meaning." s Word, name, and image magically exploited exemplifies how the mind explores the con- fines of consciousness, making visible the invisible through sen- suous analogies. Originally, of course, myth (mythos) meant word or speech: . . word and name do not merely have a function of describing or portraying but contain within them the object and its real powers SIbid., p. 70.

(they) do not designate and signify, they are and act. In the mere sensuous matter of language, in the mere sound of the human voice, there resides a peculiar power over things . . . the mythical- magical power of language is truly manifested in articulated sound.9 To Arnold, Scriptures employ "God" as a "term of poetry and eloquence, a term thrown out, so to speak, at a not fully grasped object of the speaker's consciousness, a literary term." 10 Since Plato's myths, man has depended on imaginative constructs to fill in the gaps of his knowledge. Thus parables antedated argu- ments. Arnold then regards the Bible as a mythical construct composed in the "language of approximate figure," the imaginal or substantival elements of primitive language that have been proved to give emotional impetus and satisfaction." Obviously Arnold recognized what poetry or the mythic power of metaphor can do. When he argues, for example, that the strongest element of religion today is "its unconscious poetry," he has in mind his definition of religion as "ethics heightened, enkindled, lit up by feeling"; or as "morality touched by emotion." Not just touched by emotion but, upon closer scrutiny, motivated by the emotional frame or sentiment-structure of the individual. Instead of reasoning out the nature of God, the Hebrew felt and experienced Him. Such an experience is fundamentally the epiphany that, "left to ourselves, we sink and perish; visited, we lift our heads and live." Psychologically, this intuition manifests the character of the religious intention which "represents a desire for total harmony, meaning thereby the individual's successive efforts to complete the incomplete, to perfect the imperfect, to conserve all values, eliminate all disvalues, to find permanence in the place of transitoriness." 2 The religious need is basically a need for physical wholeness, for synthesis, impelled by that SIbid., p. 121, quoting Cassirer.

To realize the ideal of the self as a "totality figure," man lays hold of images of wholeness drawn from the depths of the un- conscious. Such images are, in Jungian terms, "universal arche- types" or myths which reconcile individual instinct, the intro- spectively isolated ego, with the universal forces surrounding it. Thus, the feeling of human futility finds relief in the mystical goal of oneness with a transcendental power "not ourselves" which comprehends the mysteries of death and the future. Once a per- son imagines vividly his union with a force greater than his solitary self, he begins to act as if the authority of the moral law were acting through him. With the death of the ego, he merges in the life of the universe. This is indeed a case verified not by metaphysics but by religious experience and witnessed by the testimonies of mystics, saints, or even inspired political leaders and "messiahs." As a psychological fact, then, "God" intends to stimulate emotions for ethical actions. To William James, "true thought is a thought that is an invaluable instrument to action." In other words, the pragmatic or, in Arnold's term, "experi- mental" value of any utterance lies in its capacity to help one realize his aspirations. Through an act of the will to believe, faith makes the possible actual: "if a man helps himself in his conduct by taking an object of hope and presentiment as if it were an object of certainty, he may even be said to gain thereby an ad- vantage." 13 Christian myth may be viewed as a means of pro- viding in fact the events which it describes in figurative language. Cognizant of the experimental efficacy of prayer, ritual and inspiration, Arnold attributes the source of St. Paul's persuasive- ness to the evangelist's mode of exploiting feeling, not intellect. Not dialectics but imagery or tropes were his devices. By ma- nipulating man's responses, St. Paul was able to control and direct the master-impulse of "righteousness" in man. Since this desire is emotional in nature, it cannot be satisfied by abstract specula- tion or rhetoric. To St. Paul, the word "Christ" and all it evokes served to intensify "sympathy," for faith generates an enigmatic power which operates through the passions. Of such an opera- 1 LD, p. 97.</page><page sequence="6">102 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW tion, Arnold elucidates, "some clear notion may be got by any- body who has even had any overpowering attachment, or has been, according to the common expression, 'in love.' Everyone knows how being in love changes for the time a man's spiritual atmos- phere, and makes for animation and buoyancy where there was flatness and dullness." 14 Compare this condition of "buoyancy" with Coleridge's notion of Joy as "a consciousness of entire and therefore well being, when the emotional and intellectual facul- ties are in equipoise." 15 This "beautiful and beauty-making power" of Joy exists only when the whole soul of man is brought into activity in the poetic process. In this regard, Arnold exhorts man to attend not to conventional behavior but to the "feelings and dispositions whence conduct proceeds." Conduct, to Arnold, involves one's temper, sexual instinct, the impulse to survival. And the greatest difficulty in life is the imposition of self-re- straint. Such a difficulty Arnold resolves through metanoia, "a change of the inner man," whereby inward faults of self-assertion, violence, and sensuality are corrected: ... the first man who, as a being, comparatively of a large dis- course, looking before and after, controlled the native, instantaneous, mechanical impulses of the instinct of self-preservation, controlled the native . . . impulses of the reproductive instinct, had morality revealed to him.16 He perceived St. Paul's technique of involvement with man's psyche: And as attending to conduct had very much degenerated into a deadness and formality, attending to the springs of conduct was a revelation, a revival of fresh intuitive perceptions, a touching of morals with emotion, a discovering of religion.17 4 Saint Paul and Protestantism (New York, 1924), p. 60. * Cf. I. A. Richards, quoting Coleridge, in Coleridge on Imagination (Indiana, 1960), p. I50. See also Biographia Literaria, ed. E. Rhys (London, 191o), Chap. XIV, p. 166: "The poet diffuses a tone and spirit of unity, that blends and fuses the powers and affections 'each into each, by that synthetic and magical power to which we have exclusively appropriated the name of imagination.'" In the con- text of Arnold's thinking, "happiness" signifies the balance suggested by the phrase "imaginative reason." Only by being able to induce balance can "righteousness" prevail as a moral directive.

Speaking of liturgy, Arnold considers prayer and ceremonial practices as a "beautiful rendering" of what an individual feels and believes. Such rituals are essentially poetry, in fact "the most serious use of poetry by the noblest races." Charged with mystical connotations, ritual possesses beauty of form with "associations of pathos and solemnity." Consequently, Arnold counsels that the words and externals of religion should be handled as poetry, as "language thrown out at a vast object of consciousness not fully grasped." Therefore: "The mighty and holy one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy," is far more proper and felicitous language than "the moral and intelligent governor of the universe" just because it is far less an attempt to be precise, but keeps to the language of poetry and does not assay the language of science. . ... If the object be one not fully to be grasped and one to inspire emotion, the language of figure and feeling will satisfy us better about it, will cover more of what we seek to express, than the language of literal fact and science.'8 To Arnold, the language of the Bible functions metaphorically with its pseudo-statements, a pseudo-statement being "a form of words which is justified entirely by its effects in releasing or organizing our impulses and attitudes." 19 Whereas a statement is accepted in the degree to which it corresponds with facts, a pseudo-statement is accepted as true if it stabilizes impulses, en- gages as many attitudes for the keenest, most active and complete life. In "Science and Poetry," I. A. Richards delineates Arnold's theory of how "for poetry the idea is everything." "Idea" signi- fies poetic form. Like Arnold, Richards stresses the sound and feel of words, cadence, manner, tone, which activate emotional re- sponses and form attitudes leading to action, so that "even before the words have been intellectually understood and the thoughts is Ibid., pp. 34, 36. 19I. A. Richards, "Science and Poetry," in Criticism, ed. Mark Schorer et al. (New York, 1948), p. 518. L. Trilling writes: "If organized religion is pseudo- statement, ritual is indeed its very essence; and style is the very essence of ritual," in Matthew Arnold (New York, 1949), p. 361.</page><page sequence="8">104 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW they occasion formed and followed, the movement and sound of the words is playing deeply and intimately upon the interests." 20 The intellectual content of words serves only to direct and excite the conscious mind. Since the mind, being a system of delicately poised interests, is disturbed by every situation to which man re- sponds, what is needed is to bring his impulses into a new balance; for each new disequilibrium, which a shift of position, a fresh situation, entails, corresponds to a need. Poetry answers this need; and through rhythm and epithet, the instinctive impulses find release. In a poem, the words act as a structure by which the impulses are adjusted to one another and act together. The poet's use of words is an answer to the interests which a given situation calls into play, such pattern of words being a means of ordering, controlling, and consolidating the whole experience. Indeed, the universe of poetic discourse is an emotional organiza- tion. Thus, the command of life is the command of words. As the supreme ordering of experience, poetry reconciles all con- flicting desires and allows all impulses of which it is composed full freedom, bringing into play the maximum of man's positive interests. Through the poetic experience, an individual attains equilibrium. No belief is necessary for pseudo-statements, for like faith it simply requires unqualified acceptance. A poetic ex- perience justifies itself in its ability to bring about the aesthetic condition of harmony and equilibrium called "synaesthesis." 21 When impulses are harmonized, they work together and make us realize the full complexity of our environment. Like Richards, Arnold believes that man is a complex structure of interests or powers: the intellectual, the moral, the aesthetic, and the social. And their harmony engenders the total, perma- nent, and best self. This idea of the total man prefigures Arnold's conception of God as the "Eternal Power, not ourselves, by which all things fulfill the law of their being." 22 Arnold argues for the total man, the fusion of Hellenic and Hebraic strains, the blend- ing of intellect and emotion (implied in "conduct"), which is his solution to man's so-called "dissociation of sensibility."

As an epigraph to Literature and Dogma, Arnold quotes Senancour: "La tendance a l'ordre ne peut-elle faire une partie essentielle de nos inclina- tions, de n6tre instinct . . . ?" Consequently, man solicits religion for a revelation of order. Through participation in religious ritual, man accomplishes the task of ordering his im- pulses. Actually, myth as dramatized in ritual operates in focusing the religious intention to its object, "God," taken as a ritual symbol. Besides articulating man's inner urges and drives, a ritual symbol unites the individual will with the moral spirit of the community. From the collective symbol, each member draws out energy and a sanction for his choices and acts. Prayers, too, are gestures relating the individual to the natural scheme, project- ing his will to its desired end, and providing perspective for judg- ing situations: "All good and beneficial prayer is an energy of aspiration towards the Eternal not ourselves that makes for righteousness - of aspiration towards it and of co-operation with it." 24 The rituals of sacraments furnish sensible signs of the "power not ourselves," manifestations acting as proofs of the in- telligible structure of the universe, making visible and immediate the laws that govern life. Accordingly, Arnold's "sense of right- eousness," of a power beyond man's finite self, brings about man's integration of his faculties in binding him to the whole creation and the power that gives it meaning. Ultimately, religion proves itself as man's attempt to integrate his own personality by dis- covering the encompassing context in which he rightly belongs. In general, Arnold conceives of faith as the inward reorganiza- tion of man and his outlook in life. In recasting the Bible, he at- tempts to reduce its prescientific fables to a subordinate rank, while electing to primacy the archetypal myth of Christ's re- nunciation, death, and resurrection. What underlies Arnold's ' E. D. H. Johnson, The Alien Vision of Victorian Poetry (Princeton, 1952), pp. 157ff. 2See LD, pp. 38-9.</page><page sequence="10">106 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW "method" and "secret of righteousness" is the death-rebirth cycle, one of the more predominant archetypal motifs in litera- ture.25 At this juncture, it may be remarked that permanent myths or symbols describe some reality not capable of being analyzed but which nevertheless can be verified through its effects in human behavior. Thus, St. Paul's attachment to an unseen power of goodness may be validated on its own experiential level: "That 'God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Him- self' is verifiable in the experience of everyone who feels the mercy and the new life which flows from true repentance in the encounter with God." 26 And so Arnold counsels: "Here again it is experience that we invoke: try it!" We must then distinguish between the prescientific myths presumed to describe natural phenomena and the inspiring myth of Christ. While scientific symbols are verifiable by strict measurement, religious symbols can be measured only in terms of their practical effect on con- duct. Consequently, the Bible's mythical form of expression in- tends to intensify moral attitudes through inciting emotions of "righteousness" in the believer. And what else is conduct if not the actualization of emotion? Being the alliance of imagination and conduct, Arnold's notion of religion involves an ordered realm of experience. Whereas morality concerns one's attitude towards a situation, the imagina- tion engages itself with the integration of sensuous particulars found in the given situation. If life is, as Arnold insists, largely conduct, then in order to change the direction of man's life, the motivations of his behavior must be transformed. But though analysis might be able to dissect the inner springs of conduct, there will still remain, beyond the grasp of reason, the impene- trable domain of instinct and the subconscious. Into this realm poetry penetrates through the suggestive potency of words. Now, certain words like "God," "grace," "righteousness," have so far 5 An archetype is a primordial image which penetrates the individual con- sciousness and plumbs the collective unconscious beneath it, the racial past, or the prelogical mentality.

Arnold declares that the poetry of religion makes some- thing in us to "vibrate." With this "vibration," the believer's struggle towards the realization of his ideal grows more intense and more zealous. The feeling of being in the right not only heightens self-confidence but also transforms altogether the nature of conduct. Poetry, to recall Keats' phrase, is the "true voice of feeling." Poetic excitement stirred by primitive incantation arises from a dark impulse in man when he is confronted by the fundamental mystery of Being. Poetic emotion derived from myth may be characterized thus: "The awareness of intense individual vitality in the midst of or against an awareness of natural veritable change, or even destruction, enters the reader's mind directly, as a simple unanalyzed acute awareness of standing on the shore of time." 27 In this connection, literature may be regarded as a myth insofar as it orders experiences. Poetry embodies arche- typal symbols which are the repository of racial memories, ves- tiges of primordial ritual and ceremony. The poetic imagination is archetypal in nature when it takes particular objects as em- bodiments of a universal experience. As the closest verbal ap- proach to an immediate intuition of reality, poetry shares the archetypal function of myth. Following Jung's depth psychology, an archetype is usually construed as an image which evokes pro- found emotions in the reader because it awakens a primordial image in his unconscious memory and calls into play strong re- sponses. Similarly, Eliot observes: "The pre-logical mentality persists in civilized man, but becomes available only to or through the poet." 28 But the symbols of religion are no longer operative as archetypes, because they have lost touch with psychic reality and must now be consciously inculcated as dogma. Thus, without the emotive properties of poetic language, Scripture or any other ethical code, being a product of a given mental climate, soon for- feits its truth-value with the mutations of the Zeitgeist. To the extent that religious myth derives its appeal from its poetic 'LD, p. 293.

It is illuminating to equate Arnold's "sweetness and light," the union of Greek nobility and Hebraic sublimity, with Coleridge's theory of the mythopoeic process as the coordinative cooperation of all human faculties. In the delicate fusion of thought and feel- ing in poetry, we may discern the nature of Arnold's "grand style." To Arnold, poetic felicity issues from the balance of sentiment and thought sustained by that activity of the whole mind, that genius, as Johnson nobly describes it, without which judgment is cold and knowledge is inert; that energy which collects, combines, amplifies, and animates, and which is "in poetry at its highest stretch and in its most energetic exertion." 29 In this context, Arnold also proclaimed that "it is to the poetical literature of an age that we must, in general, look for the most perfect, the most adequate interpretation of that age, - for the performance of a work which demands the most energetic and harmonious activity of all the powers of the human mind." 30 This activity of the mind fuses reason and spirit, rational insight and emotion, until it achieves the unerring balance of "sweet reasonableness" which constitutes conduct. Like poetry, myth is an imaginative ordering of experience. It offers a picture or an image whereby present vicissitudes become meaningful. Because man cannot thrive on abstraction alone, he must have pictures of what might be or ought to be. Thus the Second Coming and the Last Judgment, in Christian eschatology, are projections of present moral evaluations into a future state in which what is temporal gains permanence. Here myth denotes the symbolic rendition as events in time of man's timeless ideals. Because it represents an idea or value as a future historical event, religious myth serves to dynamize believers into action. Over- coming lethargy and dismay, the impetus excited by the wish to believe mobilizes man's powers. In this regard, myth must be judged as a means of acting upon the present. Accordingly, Arnold imputes to religion a pragmatic validity: ' Matthew Arnold, Essays, ed. F. Neiman (Cambridge, Mass., I960), p. 7. o Ibid. There is a striking affinity between Arnold's formulation and Coleridge's description of the poetic imagination in Chapter XIV of Biographia Literaria.</page><page sequence="13">MATTHEW ARNOLD -POETICS OF BELIEF 109 Righteousness had by Jesus Christ's time lost, in great measure, the mighty impulse which emotion gives; and in losing this, had lost also the mighty sanction which happiness gives. "The whole head was sick and the hole heart faint"; the glad and immediate sense of being in the right way, in the way of peace, was gone; the sense of being wrong and astray, of sin, and of helplessness under sin, was oppressive. The thing was, by giving a fuller idea of righteousness, to apply emotion to it, and by thus reapplying emotion, to disperse the feeling of being amiss and helpless, to give the sense of being right and effective; to restore, in short, to righteousness, the sanction of happiness.31 Myth also signifies a social or collective perception of a mean- ing in the universe. Produced and sanctioned by the community, myth clarifies to the believer who receives it "in willing suspension of disbelief" the inscrutable mysteries which reason fails to ac- count for. Man can endure existence and acquiesce to death be- cause he apprehends these events as intelligible within a cosmic pattern of values. Consequently, it is illegitimate to criticize myths from a scientific viewpoint. Precisely because it is a fabric of emotional meanings, myth lies outside the dominion of science. In spite of its nonscientific nature, myth involves a species of truth - more exactly, a scheme of values which does not con- tradict but rather supplements the limited hypothetical assump- tions of science.32 To be sure, man is not all head or intelligence. Certainly the demands of the heart cannot be satisfied by for- mulae. Many situations in life escape scientific explanations which will satisfy the complex instinctive needs of man. Only myth, appealing directly to the emotions, can render such situa- tions meaningful by placing them within a perspective of values. And so, when St. Paul resolved, through Christ's example, the conflict between intention and deed, he was - to Arnold - up- holding a "figure," a myth. According to Bultmann: Myth is an expression of man's conviction that the origin and pur- pose of the world in which he lives are to be sought not within it but beyond it - that is, beyond the realm of known and tangible reality - and that this realm is perpetually dominated and menaced by ' LD, pp. 76-7. 32 Cf. Essays, ed. F. Neiman, p. 238.</page><page sequence="14">110 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW those mysterious powers which are its source and limit. Myth is also an expression of man's awareness that he is not lord of his own being. It expresses his sense of dependence not only within the visible world, but more especially on those forces which hold sway beyond the confines of the known. Finally, myth expresses man's belief that in this state of dependence he can be delivered from the forces within the visible world.33 (In acknowledging the presence of "a power not ourselves," man is thus liberated from the control of his environment, from earthly contingency. Is this not the import of what Arnold assumes as the foundation of religion, namely: "Righteousness tendeth to life?") Instead of being a transcript of the objective world, myth is then an embodiment of man's experience of the powers that govern his actions, an apprehension of his destiny. When man conceives of such powers, he is actually introducing them into the sphere of human life: he interprets natural occurrences to make concrete and particular a cosmic insight. In effect, he translates into his own language what is not of the world, transcending time and space. Now, all language is basically figurative and mythical. When myth, sanctifying the ritual which enacts it, becomes closely united with rite, it becomes Scripture; hence, the Bible incorpo- rates a myth. But because of the objectifying virtue of language, the subjective nature of Biblical myth has been rendered quite ob- scure. In Literature and Dogma, Arnold endeavored to focus our attention not on the objective content of Scripture but on its inherently poetic, subjective, mythical meaning. Ignoring the mythical quality of Biblical language, popular religion, confronted by the Zeitgeist, continued to endorse prophecy and miracle as evidences of the scientific basis of religion. But to Arnold, who took "science" simply as "criticized experience," the "proof" of religion lies on its universal appeal to the moral-emotional make-up of man. Human experience con- firms the practical value of faith. Consider, for example, Arnold's logic here: "Man's natural desire for continuance, however little it may be worth as a scientific proof of our immortality, is at best a proof a thousand times stronger than any such demon- "Rudolf Bultmann et al., Kerygma and Myth (New York, 1961), pp. Iof.; [Kerygma und Mythos, I (Hamburg, 1948), p. 251].</page><page sequence="15">MATTHEW ARNOLD -POETICS OF BELIEF 111 stration." 34 On the other hand, liberal orthodoxy valued the "thaumaturgic personage" of Christ instead of the acts of self- denial and of self-sacrifice dramatized in the Gospel. Science naturally has no appetite for magic and superstition. Since the form of Christianity was dictated by the mental temper of an age now grown archaic, Arnold deemed it necessary, if the Bible's in- fluence on conduct is to be preserved, to emphasize what is not historically refutable, namely, "its unconscious poetry." Of rele- vance here is Bultmann's acute reflection on "Aberglaube": All this is the language of mythology, and the origin of the various themes can be easily traced in the contemporary mythology of Jewish Apocalyptic and in the redemption myths of Gnosticism. To this extent the kerygma is incredible to modern man, for he is con- vinced that the mythical view of the world is obsolete. We are there- fore bound to ask whether, when we preach the Gospel to-day, we expect our converts to accept not only the Gospel message, but also the mythical view of the world in which it is set. If not, does the New Testament embody a truth which is quite independent of its mythical setting? If it does, theology must undertake the task of stripping the Kerygma from its mythical framework, of "demy- thologizing" it.35 Arnold's diagnosis of the Zeitgeist in Culture and Anarchy pointedly underscores the role of historical perspective in the task of ordering man's past and present experiences. In the light of the changes wrought on man's consciousness by the advance of science, religion must be recast to meet the changing needs of man. This adjustment may be accomplished by extracting the per- manently "useful" message of Christ which now lies buried in the mass of extra-beliefs peculiar to the mental climate of the past epoch. In this connection, Carl Jung once observed that "speech is a storehouse of images founded in experience and therefore concepts which are too abstract do not easily take root in it or quickly die out again for lack of contact with reality." Con- sequently, Arnold tried to salvage valuable principles of conduct 34LD, p. 340. SBultmann, p. 3; [pp. I6f.]. Curiously enough, Arnold anticipated the prop- ositions of Bultmann and Karl Jaspers in the main theme of Literature and Dogma. Nobody so far has investigated the implications of Arnold's ideas on religion in relation with Bultmann's theory of religion without myth.</page><page sequence="16">112 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW in the outmoded mythical trappings of the Bible. Imbedded deep in the "machinery of the fairy-tale" are certain moral principles whose validity lies in its enduring influence on human behavior. Arnold states that, instead of casting out "Aberglaube," we must change our attitude towards it: extra-beliefs are to be treated, then, as pseudo-statements. Of miracles, Arnold remarks that "the human mind, as its experience widens, is turning away from them. And for this reason it sees, as its experience widens, how they arise." 3 In the past, because of the grandeur, "the awe and admiration which they inspired," certain actions called "miracu- lous" (for want of a natural explanation) reinforced the emo- tional appeal of the Bible. In an age of skeptical materialism, Arnold exhorts us to accept on poetic faith Christ's method - "If we love one another, God dwelleth in us" - for the experience it affords us. We must then treat the Bible as the world-picture of a vanished age which is no longer applicable to our scientific era. No doubt miracles and prophecies arose not from rational speculation but from a visionary grasp of man's place in the universe. Since myth is always a representation of a world-outlook of a specific epoch, and since the Zeitgeist evolves in history, we must view the mythical language of Scripture as a vehicle through which the Hebrews announced their understanding of life. To regard religious myth as a medium is to penetrate to the deeper truths of moral experience. Modern man certainly cannot entertain the world-picture of a past age unless he treats it simply as an imaginative rendering of certain verities of the heart. Possessed with a profound historical awareness, Arnold realized that what modern man needs most is psychic balance, which science does not give. To restore such balance, Arnold proposed Christ's method of "inward movement of attention" in conduct. Religion is nothing else but "a doing which is moral," and conduct is simply "to have the heart and thoughts in order as to certain matters." "7 On more than one occasion, Arnold affirmed his conviction that the "common anthropomorphic ideas of God" and the reliance on miracles must and will inevitably pass away.

Tradition has lost its power to order the chaos of human experiences. More- over, "our religion has materialised itself in the fact - the sup- posed fact; it has attached its emotion to the fact," and now the fact is failing it. Arnold's "poetics of belief" stems principally from the vision expressed first in I88o: The reign of religion as morality touched with emotion is indeed indestructible. But religion as men commonly conceive it - religion depending on the historicalness of certain supposed facts, on the authority of certain received traditions, on the validity of certain accredited dogmas - how much of this religion can be deemed un- alterably secure? Not a dogma that does not threaten to dissolve, not a tradition that is not shaken, not a fact which has its historical character free from question. Compare the stability of Shakespeare with the stability of the Thirty-Nine Articles! Our religion has ma- terialised itself in the fact - the supposed fact; it has attached its emotion to the fact. For poetry the idea is everything; the rest is its world of illusion, of divine illusion; it attaches its emotion to the idea, the idea is the fact. The strongest part of our religion today is its unconscious poetry. The future of poetry is immense, because in conscious poetry, where it is worthy of its high destinies, our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and surer stay.38 Creeds, dogmas, and tradition now fail to support attitudes and satisfy feelings. Consequently, Arnold suggests that it is not the factual material which sanctions the attitude of reliance on Scripture conceived as poetry, but rather it is "happiness," the experience of equilibrium that it gives. There is nothing else for man to trust and act upon but his feelings. But "to confuse this trusting with believing an emotive description of them is a mistake which all traditional codes of morality encourage us to commit." 31 Precisely Arnold warns us not to believe in the "emotive descrip- tion" of the Bible, its "Aberglaube," but only to trust the emotional experience it affords, an experience conducive to har- monious conduct. Since his responses have always been sup- ported by a belief in a world-picture which is now found to satisfy SEssays, p. 239. 8" Richards, "Science and Poetry," p. 522.</page><page sequence="18">114 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW him no longer, man is unable to respond effectively to the rapidly changing circumstances of life. Only poetry can restore the har- mony of the self by setting up attitudes which do not rest on belief, which are self-supporting. The value of poetry lies in developing attitudes whose justification rests on their ability to heighten our awareness of all kinds of situations in life. With the inevitable growth of human awareness witnessed by the Zeitgeist, the traditional modes of order are losing their hold on man's imagination. Their explanations of natural phenomena are gradually being discredited. With his attitudes deprived of their material support in facts which are now proved untenable, man is reduced to ennui, to a sense of alienation from his world. Arnold perceived also modern man's propensity for "self-dissolv- ing introspection." Because of man's extreme subjectivism, im- personal and collective myths are no longer able to affect his passions: symbols are screened off by an introspective and skepti- cal intelligence. Without the balance offered by myths, man vacillates. No longer giving allegiance to the dogmatic expres- sions of the "collective unconscious," he is left without a guiding pattern for his actions. Has man, then, lost all possibility for order? Although the old myths are no longer functional, man, nevertheless, has not lost the power to make new ones. Pursuing Arnold's advocacy of poetry as a magister vitae, Richards proposes: "If we grant that all is myth, poetry, as the myth-making which most brings 'the whole soul of man into ac- tivity,' and as working with words, 'parts and germinations of the plant' and, through them, in the 'medium by which spirits com- municate with one another,' becomes the necessary channel for the reconstitution of order." 40 By means of his metaphor-making or mythopoeic imagination, man can still create symbols which are the concentrated expressions of his psychic awareness, the concrete insight into the reality of an existing situation. Though the ephemeral contexts of life may change, man's emotional make- up will always compel him to conceive of a pattern representing his primary awareness of order in the universe. All ruling myths will of course suffer modifications as history progresses; never- theless, myth will always subsist as the substructure of all human activity. This is because all ideas in the language are supported by 4 Ibid., p. 228.</page><page sequence="19">MATTHEW ARNOLD - POETICS OF BELIEF 115 a submerged metaphor: all generalizations proceed from things. No system of abstractions can affect man's behavior unless it has generated an imaginative symbolism in his mind. In all this, myth is the element that activates ideas. Conscious of the Zeitgeist, Arnold perceived that the reconsti- tution of order could be achieved mainly through the influence of religion (in its poetic aspect) upon conduct. Thus, St. Paul began with man's moral experience, from which he deduced "righteous- ness" as the law of human nature itself, the source of all order and happiness. When man enters experimentally into communion with the life of the spirit, he experiences an uplift, a magnifica- tion of his powers.41 "Righteousness" designates a mode of action which induces a feeling of transcendence over one's physical limitations, an intensified sense of life. "To one who knows what conduct is, it is a joy to be alive." 42 Arnold observes further: "And the more a man walks in this way of righteousness, the more he feels himself borne by a power not his own." To Arnold, then, conduct is simply "inward motion and rule." And Christ's method consists in spiritual rebirth, an inward reorganization of the personality. It is experience which reveals that man does not only have a momentary self, I'homme sensuel dominated by the "wishes of the flesh and of the current thoughts"; man also has a total or best self which is realized through the unified exercise of his powers of conduct, of knowledge, of beauty, of social life and manners, through the mutual interdependence of the Hellenic and Hebraic tendencies in man. On the whole, Arnold upheld ex- perience as the basis of conduct. Confronted by the temper of the times, Arnold called for a new mode of approach in the interpretation of the Bible. What he actually did in his exegesis of the Hebrew testaments was to "take their fact of experience, to keep it steadily for our basis in using their language, and to see whether from using their language with the ground of this real and firm sense to it, as they themselves did, somewhat of their feeling, too, may not grow upon us." Such "1 On the cathartic function of myths, R. Chase writes: "I suggest that myth is the repository of repressed wishes and that part of the magic power of myth stems from its ability to furnish 'recognition scenes' in which we have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with a disinherited part of ourselves," in Quest for Myth (Baton Rouge, 1949), p. ioi. 42 LD, pp. 30, 37.</page><page sequence="20">116 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a passage virtually sums up the theme of Literature and Dogma. For Arnold in effect tried to do two things: first, to distill the principles of right conduct in Christ's example of self-sacrifice - that is, "their fact of experience"; secondly, to use Biblical language as poetry to arouse the same feelings attached to "their fact of experience"; in effect, Christ's example. For the understanding of the Bible as literature, Arnold en- dorsed culture as a prime requisite. Only culture can make us sensitive and receptive to the poetic resources of Scripture, be- cause culture acquaints us with man's ways of thinking and of using words, with the scope and powers of the verbal equipment he employs in speech and thought. All thinking, in fact all mental activity, can hardly be carried on without language. Primarily through language man orders his thoughts, organizes his impulses, and directs his responses. As literature, an ordering of responses and attitudes, the Bible is then to be distinguished from dogma. Whereas dogma, the ideational content of religion, demands belief, the poetry of Scripture justifies itself by being able to arouse pro- found feelings that are required in the discharge of one's social duties and responsibilities. In order to correct man's outward faults, poetry with its emotive potency effects a change in his in- ward dispositions. If only for "the experimental sense of benef- icence" that the poetry of the Bible induces, one must concentrate on the mythical elements of Scripture instead of preoccupying oneself with the demand for systematic verification of all its sup- posed dogmatic affirmations. Such demand, indeed, betrays igno- rance of the authentic value of Scripture. For Scripture, besides ordering his impulses, also provides man with the means for self-integration in the myth of Christ which it embodies. Ex- perience has shown that man acts rightly only when he cherishes faith in a universe wherein his actions appear meaningful, when he feels that there is a universal power guiding his acts. So long as man's natural constitution remains constant, religious myth will be found necessary to give value to his daily acts. Because myth imparts to the individual a sense of being right and effective, and so helps him achieve his goals, then the Bible as poetry must be preserved. In Literature and Dogma, Arnold committed himself to the task of preserving the creative influence of the Bible on human</page><page sequence="21">MATTHEW ARNOLD - POETICS OF BELIEF 117 conduct. One recalls here the pragmatic axiom that faith in a fact helps to create the fact. William James wrote: "God is real since he produces real effects." 43 In a situational ethics, the pragmatic value of myth is preeminent. Arnold's "emotional subjectivism" involves a situation as a test of the value of any moral principle. Consequently, Arnold emphasized that God, to Israel, was "neither an assumption nor a metaphysical idea; he was a power that can be verified as the power of fire to burn, or of bread to nourish" - in short, a power verifiable through the emotional force it exerts on behavior. Religious experience manifests itself as an intuition, a feeling of confidence and sureness in one's judgment which, in turn, impels one to constructive labor. Moreover, Arnold con- sidered the exercise of the imaginative power as the highest function of man. In so doing, he assigned to literature the duty of guiding the business of life. What the critical study of literature intends to establish is a moral standard for the critical evaluation of conduct. If poetry is to be a criticism of life, it must engage itself with moral ideas. Biblical language, when treated as poetry, answers to such a criterion. With his vision of contemporary man as a Faust or a Hamlet exhibiting "the dialogue of the mind with itself," Arnold foresaw the crisis of Western civilization." He envisaged the emergence of the "split man," the being divided within itself, in an age of anxiety. We find revealed in Arnold's religious and social criti- cism the malaise of man's alienation from himself, his estrange- ment from nature and the world. What is largely responsible for man's depersonalization is his increased command over nature, his growing faith in machines, his materialism. Together with the faith in technological progress, the spirit of rational skepticism ushered in with an inexorable force a radical transvaluation of values. His traditional beliefs exposed as absurdities, man found himself left without any intuition of a purpose in life, without a myth to render significant his daily trials. By the middle of the nineteenth century, amidst these revo- lutions in matter and spirit, in secular as well as in spiritual life, Arnold strove to contemplate steadily and comprehensively the " The Varieties of Religious Experience (New York, 1903), p. 517.

And he sought to interpret it through an idea which will coordinate all its multitudinous elements - for life has become so utterly overwhelmed by facts and data - in some intelligible design. Arnold aspired for lucidity and balance, the harmony between the mind and the heart. Although he was critical of the predominant Hebraic tendency of his day, he was not entirely free from a certain imbalance: "Congestion of the brain is what we suffer from . . . I always feel it and say it - and cry for air like my own Empedocles." 4 Nonetheless, he endeavored to fuse the romantic and the rationalistic, the Hebraic and the Hellenistic qualities of his personality into an integrated whole. The integration of the self was the prime object of Arnold's intellectual quest: "So entirely does the idea of humanity, of in- telligence, of looking before and after, of raising oneself out of the flux of things rest upon the idea of steadying oneself, con- centrating oneself, making order in the chaos of one's impressions, by attending to one impression rather than the other. . ." 4 In effect, Arnold was attempting a mythical ordering of human experience through poetic coherence. In a kindred spirit, Carlyle, in Sartor Resartus, sought to "embody the divine Spirit of that Religion in a new Mythus, in a new vehicle and vesture, that our Souls, otherwise too like perishing, may live." 47 Towards such an end, Arnold elected poetry as a means. And experience, for him, confirms the value of the moral principles he perceived drama- tized in Christian myth. From an imaginative participation in myth arises man's religious experience. In essence, religious ex- perience is equivalent to the poetic experience of equipoise, of psychic harmony. Thus, if one attends to poetry, one attends to life in its fullness and at its loftiest intensity. In conclusion, we may assert that the idea of poetry as a magister vitae serves as Matthew Arnold's chief contribution to man's attempts in clarify- ing his present predicament. 4"To be sure, Arnold, with his singular method of persuasion, argued for no doctrine at all. His value lies in exemplifying a certain tone of mind, a largeness of temper, an intellectual urbanity. See John Holloway, The Victorian Sage (London, 1953), p. 203. 6 Quoted in Howard F.
