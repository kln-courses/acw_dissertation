<plain_text><page sequence="1">Performing and the Real Thing in the Postmodem Museum Tracy C. Davis When artifacts are displayed, viewers' relationship to the "real" is particularly important. Whether the context is a museum such as Skansen (Stockholm's prototypical museum of agrarian architectural preservation) or a theatrical pro- duction such as David Belasco's installation of a Child's Restaurant (in 1912 for The Governor's Lady), the material authenticity within a logically illusionistic setting is key to the attraction. This simulacrum is so well established by various genres in the history of 20oth-century entertainment that it can even translate into the immaterial medium of cinema. Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993), for example, depicts a museum in two parts: an interpretive center containing fossils and educational presentations and the Jurassic park itself, a biological col- lection of prime specimens which happen to be extinct yet, as in zoos, are cor- poreally present and alive. The variation on this staple of entertainment that concerns me here is the more unusual instance when, through a physical relationship to the artifacts (invariably the viewer's ocular and kinetic experience in the objects' midst), the installation is constructed in such a way that a performance about the un- derlying meaning of the place occurs, and it is made by the visitor without the intercession of docents. Jurassic Park shows us how this works. Dinosaurs are supposed to be extinct due to either a cataclysm or Darwinian natural selec- tion. In the context of a spectacularly thrilling ride, the paleozoological col- lection gives its would-be endorsers the ultimate encounter with the "artifacts": a chase to the death where the fittest (by Spielbergian definitions of poetic justice) survive. The screenplay pits revived dinosaurs against mod- ern-day humans, and is structured around the question of whether this time a cataclysm will stop the rapidly adapting dinosaurs from naturally selecting the humans' extinction. The premise of Jurassic Park (the place) differs from what actually occurs in the plot, for the outcome is too literally the ecosystem/evolutionary logic rather than museum logic. The museums that I regard as exemplary instances of this technique use a similar formula, relying on tension between the visitor and the displays, while encouraging the triumph of museum logic. In each case, different investments are made in maintaining the artificiality of realist or in drawing overtly on the design lexicon of postmodernism-all require the deployment of both traditions. None can be likened to the Mashantucket The Drama Review 39, 3 (T147), Fall 1995.

Davis Pequot tribe's proposed ethnic theme park next to the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, where a replica of the Great Wall of China, "visible to passing traffic on Route 2," on reservation land signals an abandonment to pastiche rather than an encounter with actual- ity (The New York Times 1993). Nor do these instances correlate to the now abandoned proposal for a Disney complex in Manassas, Virginia, which would have existed to indulge consumerist fantasies within plastic backdrops of American historical cliches (see Wines 1993; Fjellman 1992). Instead, I am interested in museums that maintain their historical mission of bringing the general public into the presence of artifacts (and in some cases sig- nificant sites) and fulfilling educational functions through the presentation of ar- tifacts within manipulated environments and built forms. However, while each instance involves an environment in harmony with prevailing ideas about the past or science, they all constrain and direct visitors' behavior as a theme park would, rather than as would a strictly "conserve and display" type of museum (such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Uffizi, or most of the British Mu- seum). They encourage an encounter with the ideology and its mise-en-scene--a la the 1993 Sylvester Stallone vehicle Demolition Man'-rather than merely an observation of items in display cases or neatly hung on walls. In such instances, visitors are in part like the audience of a realist stage play deciding whether to be caught in the simulacrum of a depicted time and place, and in part like the spectators at a promenade performance where they are at liberty to move from staging post to staging post and direct their attention at will. Performance theorists and cultural historians have explored how living his- tory museums and heritage centers adhere to the classic museum mandates of exhibiting, explicating, and preserving or reconstructing artifacts around a theme, adding human beings (in role or merely in costume) to the collection of buildings and smithies (see Schechner 1985; Leon and Rosenzweig 1989; Snow 1993). As if responding to Emile Zola's challenge to set popular drama "inside a factory, the interior of a mine, the gingerbread market, a railway sta- tion, flower stalls, a racetrack, and so on" with authentic costuming and envi- ronments, these museums superimpose a framework upon truth (enhancing observation through invention and arrangement of the mise-en-scene), yet depend on purely ocular stimuli or oral exchanges rather than physical en- gagement, proxemics, and participant-observation to promote cognition (Zola 1976:168-69). The case studies I focus on take a different approach: realizing (in Martin Meisel's sense of the Victorian theatre bringing a painting to life [1983]) the ideas behind the events or artifacts conserved and contextualized, deploying the visitor as the only human actor. Visitors experience something fundamental to the content and are drawn into performing this themselves, rather than watching others do it. At the McMichael Canadian Art Collection (Kleinburg, Ontario), as at the Billy Graham Museum (Wheaton, Illinois), space is arranged to literalize the museum's theme-in one case the aesthetics of Canadian modernism, in the other case the heavenly ascension promised by the evangelist-making visitors confront the museums' ideologies spatially rather than through the mediation of a docent or entirely inferentially through artifacts. Other examples drawn from sites as diverse as the National Civil Rights Museum (Memphis, Tennessee) and Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump (in southern Alberta, Canada) demonstrate spatial theses in sophisticated inter- actions that promote self-reflection and a conscious performance by the visitor of the meaning of the place. The technique seems to be spreading in postmodern mu- seums, including the new Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, DC, though evidence suggests it was just as effectively employed in so-called ana- tomical museums of the I9th century.</page><page sequence="3">Postmodern Museum 17 A Symbolic Microcosm of Our Nation Twenty miles north of Toronto, Ontario, in the midst of a large nature preserve along a steep river valley, stands a rambling gallery built of native materials. Set in a major flyway for migrating birds, a magnificent stand of first-growth white pine mixed with groves of ash, beech, birch, cedar, hem- lock, and tamarack, the gallery optimizes the harmony between its surround- ings and its contents. Private collectors Signe and Robert McMichael gave their art, home, and land to the Canadian nation in 1965. The McMichael Canadian Art Collection now houses the foremost examples of painters known as the Gioup of Seven, the founders of a Canadian modernist aesthetic in the early 20th century. One of the members, A.J. Casson, describes the his- toric significance of the Group in the following terms: In a very real sense, the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven repre- sent a critical turning point in Canadian art. For the first time, Canadians dared to venture beyond the restrictive confines of the European aca- demic tradition and paint as Canadians. For the first time, they dared to view native landscapes through Canadian eyes and paint with the fire and conviction required to record the breathtaking vistas of this country. Theirs was the first real protest against painting landscapes with, as Lawren Harris was so often wont to say, "an imported formula." (in Boulet 1982:9) In formalist terms, the same treatment of landscape is evident in still lifes and portraiture, but it is the landscapes that define the Group's nationalism and place in history. The gallery has expanded considerably since the collection became a Crown Corporation in 1972, yet Robert McMichael's original plan for the space is faithfully retained: "We envisioned a welcoming door, sheltering roofs and large windows which would encourage nature to embrace the celebration of natural beauty within our walls" (1986:20).2 By arranging the works of Tom Thomson (the artistic inspiration who predeceased the Group's first exhibit of 1920), J.E.H. MacDonald, Lawren Harris, A.Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, F.H. Varley, Franklin Carmichael, A.J. Casson, their successors in the Group, and 1.

Two paintings featured in the McMichael Collection: (left) Arthur Lismer's Canadian Jungle and (right) Afternoon, Algonquin Park by Tom Thomson. (Photos courtesy of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection) the Group's spiritual sister Emily Carr, the Collection portrays the geographical breadth of Canada from the Laurentians to the foothills of Alberta, Kwakiutl villages of the Pacific Coast, and islands of the Arctic Ocean in a variety of painterly styles capturing the moods, diversity, and vastness of the second larg- est nation on earth. It is a cliche-and I believe a true one-that Canadians have a strong affinity for their land which extends beyond regional fidelity. The Group of Seven both documented and formalized this identification. Masterpieces like Lismer's Canadian Jungle or Thomson's Afternoon, Algonquin Park, which capture territory very much like the museum's own setting, unmistakably connect the museum's art treasures to the land on which they are displayed. Unusually placed windows in the first floor galleries offer large and frequent expanses of "real" landscape for ready comparison with the art. It would be very difficult for anyone visiting the museum to miss this con- nection. First, one undertakes a meandering path through the woods to get from the parking lot to the museum. One passes Thomson's actual shack, re- located from downtown Toronto, where he spent the winters executing canvases based on the oil sketches he made in abundance every summer where he lived and died, 120o miles north of Kleinburg. Whatever the season, visitors cannot avoid recognizing seasonality on this walk: whether by slipping on icy trails, huddling against downpours reverberating against the forest canopy, sneezing through clouds of ragweed pollen, or scuffling through puddles of brilliantly hued leaves, the land and its climate demand sensory re- sponses. In front of the main entrance, Pauta's enormous sculpture Bear (a po- lar bear gripping a doomed seal) reminds visitors of a naturist perspective from Cape Dorset, devoid of pastoral or benign romanticism-Canada's outdoors in brutal but equilibrist form. This conditions a productive tension between indoor and outdoor, identifying the art (including the huge First Nations People's galleries upstairs which emphasize figure rather than landscape art) with the land which inspires it, as in Blake Debassige's The Enlightenment or Haida totem poles. McMichael calls this a "symbolic microcosm of our na- tion" (1986:30), and that is precisely the connection visitors are encouraged to make. No connoisseurship, no knowledge of art is necessary, and one needn't read the labels: dwelling in the land, experiencing the ferocity of its seasons, and navigating its vast distances are enough. The environmental theme is so omnipresent, both in the European Canadi- ans' and the First Nations people's art, that it cannot be ignored. The gallery succeeds in leading visitors to experience for themselves the artists' aesthetic reaction to the environment. This experience is not restricted to cognitive connections, but through repeated cross-referencing of interior and exterior,</page><page sequence="5">Postmodern Museum 19 4. &amp; 5. The plan of the grounds of the McMichael Collection (top), and the museum interior (bottom). (Photos courtesy of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection) it becomes a performance of artistic insight. We do not just read the captions, listen to the birds, or look at the art, we perform the gestalt affectively, expe- riencing the creativity, emotion, and ideological attitude of the artists. The artfulness of manipulating concept and metaphor (aesthetic and art) brings us into ajurassic Park-like encounter with the artifacts. Widely differing in style, the European Canadians' art is nevertheless uni- fied by its Group of Seven label, augmented by a few followers such as David Milne who urbanized the Nature vocabulary. Perhaps what edges this neat signifying chain into a fractured identity is the tendency to call into question the hierarchy of authenticity. Which is more real: the forest landscape un- changed since before the fur trade, the landscape paintings that epitomize what "Canadian" means to dwellers in the modem state, or the material evi- dence of indigenous people's interpretations (chronologically later than the Group of Seven's)? In the visitor's experience, they emulate each other. Postmodernist theory tends to leave out questions of self-identity allied with nation, aesthetics, and epistemology (Waugh 1992:124-25). The McMichael Collection invites a performance of self-identity undistanced from the theory,</page><page sequence="6">20 Tracy C. Davis affectively pulling us, like the historically reclaimed Emily Carr, into the pic- ture for the sake of historiographic coherence and the formal complexity of a modernist argument. But while the first-floor galleries promote a coherent modernism, the upper-level First Nations galleries remind visitors of the con- tinuing project of nation-building which often ruptures the evolutionist ideas of European artists. The Universal Truth of Ethnology In a 1977 UNESCO report, Kenneth Hudson ponders the fate of thousands of archaeological sites scattered over the world[... T]he museological problem is always to decide whether to build a small mu- seum on the site, with all the difficulties of supervision and security that involves, or to more or less leave the site to its fate and to transfer what has been found on the site to a conventional type of museum in a nearby city. (1977:72) The next three examples are all site-specific museums that tackle this problem in different ways. Herding bison and driving them over a cliff to their deaths is a hunting method unique to North America, developed Io,ooo years before the adop- tion of bows and arrows. The best preserved site among over Ioo examples is Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump located in southwestern Alberta, within view of the Kananaskis Range of the Rocky Mountains.3 The Porcupine Hills be- hind the site provide basins to gather and contain herds in preparation for the run at the cliff; the plateau adjacent to the jump site has driving lanes marked by over I,ooo cairns of piled rocks extending back Io kilometers (6.2 miles). Beneath the cliff, at the kill site, bone deposits are over 30 meters (almost Ioo feet) thick, accumulated over a period of 5,700 years; beyond, the Old Man 6.

In 1981, UNESCO declared Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump a World Heritage Site (like the Pyramids at Gizah and the Great Wall of China), and in 1987 an interpretive center opened. The site presented unusual challenges to the architects. Moving the artifacts to Calgary, or the closer centers of Fort MacLeod or Lethbridge, would nei- ther help the tourist industry of the Crowsnest Corridor, assist the nearby Peigan (Peeagan or Peekanow) and Blood (Kainah) reservations in honoring and protecting their heritage, or contribute to a visitor's understanding. If a building was placed at the base of the cliff, it would preclude future archaeo- logical digs and hamper the scientific project of interpretation. If a building was placed some distance away, say at the camp site, the succession of events of bison jumping would be harder to convey, and the camp site which had not yet been excavated by any team would be buried forever. If a building was constructed at the top of the cliff, the impact of the natural topography would be destroyed and an adjacent sacred knoll (for vision quests) endan- gered by visitor traffic. A building behind the site, farther back in the Porcu- pine Hills, would be difficult to reach by automobile and would obscure the narrative of running, killing, butchering, and preserving the kill. Meanwhile, Alberta Culture and Multiculturalism (the government department responsible for museums) specified that the site development must be as nearly invisible as is technically feasible. [...] It is not the purpose of the structure to attract visitors to the site, or by its architecture to make any statement on site theme or government presence; its function is solely to provide an unobtrusive environmental envelope. Similarly, such ancillary features as access roads, carparks, or exterior lighting shall pro- vide the necessary services with the least possible visual impact. [...] In particular, it is required that no more than Io% of the volume of the Centre shall be visible from normal eyelevel at a distance of one hundred feet (or thirty-three metres). (Head-Smashed-In 1982:3 1) Alberta was about to do the unthinkable: invest $6,59,00oo (Canadian) in making ar. invisible museum (27). The solution is ingenious. It is possibly the most dramatic break with the tradition of palacelike edifices that defined museums' architecture since their emergence in the I8th century. The LeBlond Partnership put the museum un- derground-in the cliff-just south of the kill site.4 Visitors park at an archaeologically insignificant site 300 meters (330 yards) southeast of the mu- seum, enter the building at the toe of the cliff, explore five levels of exhibits con- nected by two banks of elevators, and emerge at the cliff edge where a pathway conducts them to the primary jump site. It is entirely accessible by wheelchairs. 7. &amp; 8. Two views of the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump from the east. (Photos by E.A. Davis)</page><page sequence="8">22 Tracy C. Davis 9. &amp; lo. Head-Smashed- In Buffalo Jump from the southeast (top), and from the east. (Photos by E.A. Davis) The architecture plays a crucial part in structuring visitors' experience of the museum and its thesis: a pedagogy about indigenous peoples' ecological adaptation and cultural system based on exploiting the migratory bison (Head- Smashed-In 1985:23). While the relationship between First Nations peoples and the environment takes up many exhibits, the focal point of all five levels is a trio of bison perched on an artificial precipice. Visitors find this precipice as irresistible as the real one outside, which encourages a syncretic unification of both the human and bison perspectives on the land and particularly on the use to which this piece of land was devoted. Buffalo hoofprints guide visitors from elevators to displays, and while respect for the hunters is fostered, so is an anthropomorphism of the prey. The bison were slaughtered to the verge of extinction by a race just as clumsy, short sighted, thick skinned, and ubiqui- tous as the prehistoric herds; Donald Graham's narrative of traveling the</page><page sequence="9">Postmodem Museum 23 nearby Bow Valley in 1872 records "there seemed to be no space, unoccupied by buffaloes" but a decade later the last Blackfoot (Siksika) bison kill was logged (Graham n.d.). Understanding of the Native ways will, it is hoped, prevent a similar catastrophe from being delivered on the Native peoples who are making a recovery from genocide, as evidenced in Peigans' staffing of the tourist-oriented sections of Head-Smashed-In. The reemergence of the bison in managed herds underscores the "recovery" theme, and we know they have recovered because we are invited to eat buffalo burgers in the cafeteria. The exhibits emphasize the covert operations of bison stalking which show Natives' respect for their prey: wearing animal skins, moving like bison within the herd, and "thinking" like their prey made the hunts successful. This en- courages a similar perspective between the races that now populate the plains: developing greater respect, greater understanding, and a harmonious coexist- ence are crucial. Teetering on the brink of the cliff, my museum-conditioned imagination suggests two plots: (i) I am a bison careening to my death, or (2) I will be like the peoples who economically use the fruits of the kill and the resources of the environment to survive in an ecologically and therefore spiri- tually sustainable manner. This is "the universal truth of ethnology" that arises when we put ourselves in the place of the Other, becoming, as Baudrillard wrote of the Philippine Tasaday "'what they used to be,' or at least that which ethnology has made them" (1985:15-16). It pushes the ecomuseum into the mode of "living history," foregrounding the traces of colonialism and what is for Native people the ever-deferred "post-" in postcolonialism, and yet insists as a site that its specific history and geography be addressed. Cultural pluralism-or "multiculturalism," which is the official rhetoric es- poused by the Albertan and Canadian governments-requires encounters with the Other. Physically situating visitors at the brink where animal and human worlds met institutes a dialog with the site's data (mythological, geological, ar- chaeological, ethnographic, and historical) that encourages an intercultural hermeneutic. At the brink, feeling the prevailing cool southwesterly winds at their backs, squeezed on a precipice between formidable mountains and equally awe-inspiring plains, visitors may actively manipulate this rhetoric of interculturalism, and depict themselves at the intersection of two systems: the Native (fulsomely documented in the museum) and the white (inferred in the lower levels' exhibits on post-Contact cultural changes, and Head-Smashed-In as a field site for archaeologists-the vital abattoir reduced to layers that bear witness to the longevity of the First Nations and the tenuous claims of the new state). Only a "despotic" mentality looks at an object or a landscape and leaves it unanimated by the imagination. A pluralist mentality can move around and within the artifacts and landscape to imagine the Other's worldview. In Patricia Waugh's words: In its postmodern forms [...] the aesthetic [or as I might say, the museum thesis] is no longer simply model or catalyst occupying an autonomous realm of its own. It has entered the lifeworld and invaded the spheres of knowledge and ethics in a new version of a longstanding attempt fully to integrate body with mind and self with world. (1992:1I4-1 5) Like the majority of visitors to Head-Smashed-In, I am from the province of Alberta. Raised on Alberta Culture's rhetoric of multiculturalism-and marked by its failure-I may read the museum's pedagogy with particular acuity. Nevertheless, like most museumgoers, I visit the site in search of knowledge, greater understanding of cultural concerns, and a way to integrate myself into my surroundings. So, my reaction to Head-Smashed-In may be as much an act of writing upon it as reading it. It makes me feel implicated in a</page><page sequence="10">24 Tracy C.

Head-Smashed-In marks a break with conventional ethnographic museums located in cultural capitals--Ottawa, London, New York-that assemble arti- facts into illusionistic displays, encouraging visitors to "step into" the material circumstances and the imagined mindsets of pre-Contact "Indians" (Jacknis I991), disregarding the vast geographic distances between the displays and any surviving peoples. Canadian institutions have been particularly culpable in continuing this tradition in the most seductively high-tech illusionistic displays</page><page sequence="11">Postmodern Museum 25 (the British Columbia Provincial Museum in Victoria and the spectacular new federal Museum of Civilization in Hull are the most glaring offenders). What Head-Smashed-In accomplishes (and what the Little Big Horn revisers might consider) is the de-aestheticization of artifacts; encouragement of visitors to identify with First Nations peoples in multiple temporal eras; and the fractur- ing of visitors' identities in such a way as to ultimately make them more criti- cal of their own ethno-historical profiles and able to confront their own people's culpability for past, present, and future practices. Mediation of the site is instrumental to the pedagogy. Behavior and Space Are Mutually Dependent In 1968 the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated as he stepped out of his room on the second floor of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Nightly since 1991, a laser beam has outlined the bullet's trajectory across the limousines in the parking lot. In daylight, the motel looks pristinely realistic: defying anyone to believe it is anything other than what its facade reveals. But a protestor across the street, a former maid who was evicted from the mo- tel when it was designated for conversion in 1988, observes a daily vigil op- posing the appropriation of her space, King's memorial, for anything but housing, a clinic, or a job training center. Inside, there is almost no trace of the motel: it has been gutted, stripped down to warehouse aesthetics, and filled with the National Civil Rights Museum. Gerald Eisterhold, the designer, writes: The challenge was to give the [civil rights] movement an interpretive framework that would bring out historic lessons that are still relevant- and becoming more so. What we decided on was a storyline based on the constitutional issues that were tested through the actions of civil rights activists-issues that we believed grounded and gave structure to the emotionally charged and often violent events. (1992:52) In the storyline the events are chronologically arranged. After a film and gallery of two-dimensional displays on the 19th-century history of civil rights, the ex- hibit style changes to "a series of environmental 'you-are-there' experiences" accompanied by "photos, audio recordings, documentary footage, life-size stat- ues, artifacts, and reproductions" (Eisterhold 1992:52). We can examine the ex- terior of a burned-out freedom bus, but more importantly, by climbing aboard the actual bus on which Rosa Parks' protest began, we can sit down and be- come subject to a recording of the driver's voice demanding that we (posi- tioned as Rosa Parks) move or leave. Such exhibits invite visitors to make a 13. The exterior of the National Civil Rights Museum, the former Lorraine Motel, in Mem- phis, Tennessee. (Photo by J.

Davis choice: experience the prejudice, resist, and continue the work of history as bracketed by Dr. King's preference for nonviolent integrationist tactics; or get up and leave. A lunch counter installed, following contextualizing displays, al- lows visitors to reenact occupations, perform races, experience integration while remaining conscious of visual markings; to syncretically unite an object of study with the discourse about it and an affective experience of performing the acts of civil disobedience that led to a more just nation. By contrast, we can only peer into King's prison cell, faithfully relocated from Birmingham, merely an artifact in a museum setting. A scene of school integration is played on a bank of video monitors; on a wall across the aisle this episode and others like it are described by text that is behind a glass surface. The glass reflects the video footage as well as our own images, so that we are now intermediate in the riot and the historicization. In this museum, we not only read, hear, and see the civil rights movement of the 1950s-I960s in action, we are put in its midst and challenged to do something within the bounds of the historical narrative. Because much of the population is too young to have participated in these events, the museum offers a second chance to experience the moment. In the segment depicting the 1963 march on Washington, the largest group up to that time to have converged on the Mall, gray sculptures express rapt at- tention as we hear the speeches we have selected from an array of options listed on a foreshortened Lincoln Memorial. The space invites us to sit, listen, and be moved. It depicts an emergent democracy and allows us to participate in the invention of this tradition, again or for the first time. The design of the life-sized sculptures enhances the theme of integration; they are gray, seem- ingly "colorless," but still distinctly racially marked. The nonrealism of the strategy, in a first impression, breaks down in closer examination, promoting a different way of seeing race-not as the primary characteristic of individuals nor erased as a characteristic of difference. By placing the sculptures in displays promoting participation-they are on the bus and at the lunch counter, as well as on the Mall-affective and cognitive learning are promoted.s But at the site of Room 306, the theatricalization of iconography and the strategic use of artifacts stimulates a strong emotional response. The Female (and geographers would say "feminist") components of spatial geography, em- phasizing the embodied, collective, and passionate aspects of history and its 14.

Even though many of the artifacts in earlier displays are authentic, the color, textures, and "reality" that confront us when we turn a corner and suddenly face a cross-section of the room from which King stepped to his death-the bedspread still dented, plates of half-eaten food on the bureau, signs of work everywhere-the realization that we are in the Lorraine Motel and not some random place, looking across the bullet's track, is emotionally stunning. Among the generations whose hearts stopped-though only mo- mentarily-when King died, I have observed it bring about a devastating re- newal of loss. For younger generations and foreigners who know this story but may not have felt it before, the place underlines the futility of this death; 16.

Jacqueline Smith on Day 2531 of her vigil opposite the National Civil Rights Museum. (Photo by Barbara Babbitt, with kind permission ofJacqueline Smith) and, with the momentum of a movement with so many devotees documented in the preceding displays, it also underscores the tragedy that so much time was lost grieving and recovering from this murder. Jacqueline Smith, the former maid who still pickets across the street, marks the days of her vigil on a banner, and though the museum disavows her, she, more than any part of the official exhibit, requires an improvisation from visi- tors. Shall I acknowledge her and her cause? Shall I honor only history and not the present? One foreign newspaper's travel section complains that the la- ser beam tracing the bullet to the motel balcony is "the ultimate lapse of taste" (McArthur 1993). Is it really so bad? Isn't it analogous to a centuries-old tradi- tion of ritualized reenactments of the crucifixion in the passion plays? If Jesus Christ was put to death in Jerusalem today, rising from the grave three days hence, wouldn't it be commemorated with a museum and laser show? And wouldn't that be fitting, as long as an elderly ragged woman, evicted from Calvary, bore witness and performed her commentary?7 The prison cell, the photographs, and the tapes of King's speeches provide traces on him throughout the museum. His trace is strongest in Room 3o6, closing the narrative about him. The museum's thesis suggests an unstoppable movement, yet the exhibits virtually end with 1968. Jacqueline Smith is vis- ible from the viewing gallery next to Room 306, and this is the museum's only window on the outside world. Her protest is the only evidence that King's ideas, as opposed to his deeds, should still be shocking us, should still be applied to conditions of squalor and injustice. Is Smith the unwitting museum's docent? Or is she an artifact, more up-to-the-minute than all those encountered within the museum and its grounds? It is she who ironizes the museum and its contents. It is she-if we will look-who shocks us out of so- lemnity, promoting more than mourning, nostalgia, or paralysis.

No Preacher Dares Show Us God in the Form of a Bearded Dummy In the Billy Graham Center on the campus of Wheaton College, a state-of- the-art museum dedicated to the life, work, and philosophy of the college's most famous alumnus opened in 1979. Following an orientation film on the meaning of evangelism, a lengthy exhibit demonstrates the direct line of suc- cession from Saul to Billy Graham. Various techniques, such as tent meetings and the Salvation Army, and exponents such as Lyman Beecher and Billy Sunday are featured. The second third of the museum documents the variety of media by which Billy Graham's Evangelistic Association preaches: monster rallies, radio, a syndicated newspaper advice column, magazines, television, cinema, and video. In most cases the text and artifacts are small, inviting close scrutiny. After all, the Protestant's communion with God is private, though another human being-say, an evangelist-may facilitate by connecting the call through a metaphorical switchboard of gospel texts. Visitors can push but- tons to select from a range of texts, listen privately on telephone receivers, watch videos on small screens, and flip the pages of a magazine; these tech- niques are consonant with the ideology of Protestantism, yet are still techni- cally conventional exhibition strategies. This second section, the only part that explicitly references Graham, culminates in a cinema where a film on Graham's crusades runs continuously. It suffices as a "personal encounter" with the museum's namesake. Upon exiting the cinema, the visitor is confronted by an odd spatial im- passe: for the first time in the museum, the direction one is intended to take is unclear. During my first visit, one choice led me to an emergency exit and another to a broom closet. Finally, after a moment's agnostic dilemma, I found my way into an irregularly shaped huge polygonal room with nothing but a few biblical texts etched on the white walls. Rounding a bend, I came upon a corridor in the shape of a cross. The source of the distant blue glow 18.

Davis 19. The entrance to the Resurrection, "The Walk Through the Gospels," at the Billy Graham Center Museum. (Photo by Peter A. Davis) became clear at the same moment that an enormous austere crucifix loomed into view. Within this room, once more there is text-"God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son"-but the room presents another im- passe. At the foot of the cross, the left leads nowhere, and the right-while not visually presenting an exit-at least promises more space to maneuver. Af- ter trial and error, I began to ascend a sloping corridor, black on every surface and carpeted all around to absorb sound. The corridor zigged and zagged half- a-dozen times. Finally, I read "He has Risen! He is not here," and continued on until an infra-red scanner was activated, triggering Handelian music as I rounded the final bend and stepped onto an immaculate white marble floor surrounded on all sides by tromp l'eoil clouds and fluorescent flood light. In this sequence of rooms, one passes from crucifixion through limbo and resurrection into the heavenly spheres. One achieves (or rather, "realizes" in the theatrical sense) the promised outcome of evangelism and atonement. In theological terms, beginning with the museum's exhibit on Saul, the beginning, middle, and end are played out with an inevitable outcome. The Christian ar- rives in the presence of God, who in our day and age cannot be represented by a bearded animated dummy (see Eco 1986:53); that technique is reserved for Disney's Lincoln and the Pirates of the Caribbean. The atheist arrives in the hall of God's scene painters. In either case, evangelism's logic is performed and made inevitable. Like 19th-century panoramas, this sequence of rooms (which the staff call "The Walk Through the Gospels") employs technical skill "to achieve what may have seemed to be the impossible: the incorporation of the passage of time into a static picture" (Warren 1993:182). The museum prepares for this and constructs it linguistically and ideologically long before one en- counters the hereafter's visual, aural, and tactile presence. Most importantly, it makes the visitor mark the time by making decisions, finding the right path, as- cending the slope, achieving righteousness, and then standing back and admir- ing the view. This physicalizes the promised spiritual journey as a human experience, not the experience of God as depicted in a Catholic passion play.</page><page sequence="17">Postmodern Museum 31 20. &amp; 21.

Descend a slight incline, pass through heavy rough-hewn doors, and an understated chapel in muted earth tones with early Christian symbols etched into the walls envelopes everyone in an ecumenical ambiance that would "authenticate" the Christian faith by the his- torical longevity of its church. In geographic terms, it is feminist: melding a doctrinal promise to an aesthetic in one's own rehearsal for the afterlife, em- bodied and rehearsed in such as way as to make the personal historical. It is not countertextual, like Jacqueline Smith's vigil, but it is a capitulation to</page><page sequence="18">32 Tracy C. Davis realism's artifactual and illusionistic paradox in the here and now, artfully con- cealing as it blatantly manipulates empty signals to culminate in the ideologi- cally determinist simulacrum. Unless visitors complete the sequence, it has no narrative meaning: no personal implications. Passing through "heaven" and on to church, we are forced to be metaphorically "reborn" in our reentry to the earthly. The "Walk Through the Gospels" is devoid of real objects-the stock-in- trade of museums-yet it gives an experience of historical as well as doctrinal themes. Whereas the Disney parks eschew any scholarship, preferring the purely emotional response of "happiness," the Billy Graham Center inge- niously combines information and education with the pleasure of theatrical spectacle. Exiting the chapel, we reenter a college. In this same structure there is an archive and library on the subject of evangelism. Just as the Disney parks sell Disney (and MGM, Touchstone, and Hollywood production studio me- mentos), the Billy Graham Center promotes its own product: the promise of salvation and the means to learn about it. Borrowing Michael Belcher's terms, both might be said to represent "the point where the scholarly pursuit of re- creating environments and the leisure industry's interest in providing enter- tainment overlap" (1991:65). Open Daily, for Ladies Only, from 8 A.M., to 6 P.M. Lest these case studies be categorized as either ingenious or crass products of late-industrial culture, merely drawing on theme-park motifs, deviously ap- plying psychological research and relying on postmodernist conditioning, my last example falls squarely within the oldest traditions of museum display and antedates all the others examples by at least a century.! In premodern museums it was not unusual, as at the Peabody in Salem, to see a jar of gallstones next to a reindeer carcass or, as at the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, a jar with Napoleon's bowels next to a rib from Robert the Bruce (Ripley 1969:39-4o). Academic edification was not necessarily more than a thin pretext in such collections. Like the postmodern, "Rococo taste produced an epidemic of illicit fanciful joinings" in the cabinets de curiositi, and "subversive optical associations flew in the face of that intellec- tual clarity and distinctness sought by a puristic strain of Neoclassical thought" (Stafford 1991:29-31). This tradition is perhaps best traced today in the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museums in various tourist centers. In any case, like today's institutions, they were entrepreneurially based "places of public diversion" ca- tering to a variety of clientele (Vergo 1989:2). One such collection, the Ladies' Museum of Anatomy, exhibiting in New York in 1869, is a prime example of the 19th-century postmodern (or is it ro- coco?) museum with a superabundance of eclectic objects bearing on botany, endocrinology, geriatrics, veterinary science, osteology, gynecology and ob- stetrics, oncology, dermatology, sea shells, minerals, snakes, and all manner of animals and curiosities including a wooden Chinese book. But as its name suggests, it was primarily an anatomical collection and it was for these displays that a clientele was drawn. What is extraordinary about this museum, how- ever, is that it was not only primarily a museum about women but it was also a museumfor ladies. The anatomical exhibits were presented in a variety of media: plate illustra- tions, models, wax reproductions, and occasionally the real thing, preserved in formaldehyde as a "wet" preparation. Most museums of this kind, such as Dr. Kahn's Anatomical Museum in London, were ostensibly for the training of medical doctors, though open indiscriminately for the delectation of any pru- rient man. Supposedly educational, they were actually pornographic and used</page><page sequence="19">Postmodern Museum 33 extensively by male erotic thrill-seekers. Of C. Susini's wax models displayed at La Specola (Florence) for example, Ludmilla Jordanova writes: The use of hair illustrates this vividly--eyelashes, eyebrows, on the head and pubic area. If you add to this the pearl necklaces on recumbent fe- male models and the look of ecstasy on the faces of these women, the glass cases and fringed silk linings, it is immediately evident that to de- scribe these models as deliberate substitute for a bit of nature unavailable for technical reasons does not explain anything. Wax figures have also been seen as vehicles for popular sex education, an idea which is as plau- sible as claims for their strictly medical function in anatomy teaching. On one level anatomic wax models simulate nature and hence can be deemed a legitimate source of knowledge. But at another they frankly invite the viewer's fantasies, fantasies which are inevitably sexual in na- ture. (1989:36) The Ladies' Museum of Anatomy, though as aleatoric in its collection as most such museums, is like the contemporaneous American Museum theatre of P.T. Barnum in that it targeted a middle-class audience ("for ladies only") promising that only other females are in attendance at all times, as a guarantee of privacy and respectability. However, the usual bricolage is broken by an unusual variation evincing a technique remarkably similar in effect to the McMichael Collection, Head-Smashed-In, the Museum of the Civil Rights Movement, and the Billy Graham Center. Samuel T.E. Beck, MD, the physician responsible for preparing many of the exhibits, promised that "Consulting Rooms for Ladies are on the premises, where he may be consulted daily, from I2 till 2, Sundays excepted" for the fee of $5.oo. In his introduction to the catalog, Beck argues that women's educa- tion in Chemistry, Anatomy, and Physiology has been wrongfully ignored, making ladies ill-prepared for marriage and motherhood, by which he means 22. &amp; 23.

He warns: "Whenever in doubt or trouble in any of these matters, consult with those who are professional and competent; those who can sympathize with the fond mother, and appreciate her sacred position, as in part the author and moulder of immortal souls, destined for good or evil" (Ladies Museum of Anatomy 1869:Io-II). Realizing this in a museum setting is thought to be a 20oth-century goal, possibly first demonstrated by the fetal displays and human cross-sections at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry (Cole 1993). The preponderance of exhibits depicting gynecological disorders, fetal de- velopment, obstetrics, pediatric disorders and infant dissections, congenital dis- eases accompanied by editorials on the cause (invariably bad parenting), models of the Aspinwall children (starved to death by their father), and "the world-re- nowned dissectible figure, the celebrated Venus de Medici" in whom "at one glance the whole internal structure of the [female] human frame can be seen" are supposed to be "in all instances true copies from the originals as furnished by actual cases" (Ladies' Museum of Anatomy 1869:29, 6). Examples include: 98. Extreme case of prolapsus uteri. This case came under Dr. Beck's immediate notice. The patient had for years suffered from this great affliction, and tried in vain all the modern inventions, medicines and appliances of the day. The case terminated, under Dr. Beck's care and treatment, in a successful and perfect cure. There are, unfortunately, too many causes which tend to induce this disease, and we all know how very common it is amongst us. One great preventive of it is proper care and judicious treatment during that particular period when the young wife is about to become a mother, and particular care after that impor- tant event. Dr. Beck would impress upon the minds of visitors the neces- sity for extreme caution at that eventful time [...] 00oo. Generative organs of an Ethiopian virgin. o10. Model showing after-effects of ulceration of the female organs. (Came under Dr. Beck's notice.) [...] I116. Leucorrhoea. This abnormal discharge is very common among married females, and is attributable to various acquired habits; also in- duced by improper diet, excess, &amp;c. Dr. Beck is remarkably successful in these diseases. (Ladies' Museum of Anatomy 1869:29) Following the King of Sparta's maxim that boys should learn at school what they will practice as men, Beck presents his museum as a school for wives, but in a much more performative dimension than the Chicago displays facilitate. He is promoting his own medical practice, but he does this by presenting women with examples of dysfunctions that they can study. If lacking knowl- edge and vocabulary to describe their own problems, they can identify their symptoms among the exhibits, and refer to a model, diagram, or specimen as an opening gambit in their $5.oo consultation. It is a brilliant circumvention of women's gynecological and pediatric ignorance and it is undoubtedly in- tended to be self-referential, for among the preponderance of exhibits on women, children, and racial foreigners there is a conspicuous absence of any- thing bearing on Euro-American men.9 The presence of a consulting room, and the repeated implications that women should see themselves reflected in the specimens, whether healthy or unhealthy, suggests that the objects collected in the Ladies' Museum of Anatomy and the gestalt of the display were far from arbitrary. Women were supposed to gain educational benefit, not titillation, and while I do not deny the possibility of homoerotic or homosocial viewing, unlike the anatomical wax museums emphasizing gynecology for the delectation of men, the Ladies' Museum encouraged women to see themselves and their children, not an exoticized opposite. For female visitors, an Enlightenment epistemology was</page><page sequence="21">Postmodern Museum 35 not rooted in domination of inert representations of the body/nature/woman ruled by the detached cognitive subject of mind/science/man. The post- modem, which exists insofar as the animal kingdom is plundered for the pur- poses of variety, not comprehensiveness, is subverted by a coherent narrative made by women's self-identification with the displays, and performances of this in the consulting room. The museum itself does not make a symbolic or- der, but the female visitors, referring to the exhibits and referencing their own anatomy and symptomology can. For white men-if they ever were admitted even on a day when the doctor was "in"-this would be impossible. Insofar as Beck's services are useful, he facilitates women metonymously recognizing themselves and discovering an image, if not a grammar, for self-identity. In this sense, the exhibits and their pathologies are not metaphors of female sexuality or health-which would be the mode of anatomical museums for male consumers-but simulacra. There are no boundaries between the lady visitors and the exhibits; they are, in a corporeal sense, intertexts. In a way, Beck functions as a docent facilitating the recognition. However, a consulta- tion with him was optional, his hours were short, and the recognition process was encouraged merely by the presence of a consulting room. Some, but far from the majority, of the anatomical exhibits were wet specimens, which places the women visitors themselves in the position of the artifactual. It is as if the museum beckons in the exhibits, and they, in quiet contemplation, taxonomize themselves as freakish or normative, uniting the functions of arti- fact and performer. Ultimately, heaven's son et lumiere show at the Billy Graham Center re- quires the same cross-referencing of text and context as the self-identification of gynecological pathology, the material and ideological bases for nationalist aesthetics, or multicultural agendas. The spiritual or scientific takes a physical form, and that is the essence and purpose of a museum. "A museum," accord- ing to the International Council of Museums, "is a permanent establishment administered in the public interest, with a view to conserve, study, exploit by various means and, basically, to exhibit, for the pleasure and education of the public, objects of cultural value" (Hudson 1975:1). By this definition, Nike Town, the Michigan Avenue shop-front homage to Nike's superstar endorsers and its latest and flashiest fashion gear, is a museum. It is crass, but like the La- dies' Museum of Anatomy, the Billy Graham Center, and Alberta Culture and Multiculturalism it has a product to sell, whether or not monetary exchange is implied. Museums are undergoing a boom-in 1991 there were 13,500 in Eu- rope; 7,000 in North America; 2,800 in Australia and Asia; and approximately 2,000 in the rest of the world-and as a sector of the entertainment industry they are a major contender against theatre and performance per se for atten- dance and revenue. So, if only for economic reasons, it is important for per- formance scholars to note the elements of performance that museums are invoking and the effect some museums may be having on conditioning par- ticipant-spectatorship. In truth, however, there is much more at stake. The new American Museum of the Holocaust (Washington, DC) demonstrates how this can operate on a micro-sensory level in order to trigger a cognitive appreciation for ideas way beyond the reach of mere historical verisimilitude. Halfway through the mu- seum, intellectual horror at an already familiar narrative of recent genocide is compounded by olfactory confirmation in a gallery where the odor of decom- posing shoe leather cannot be obliterated by even the most energetic air condi- tioner. The adjacent Ejszyszki Tower gallery relies (in formalist terms) on fragmentation of photographic imagery, and while the aesthetic is never one of disposability or superficiality, claiming always a realist authenticity and coher- ence, the shoes' odor invades visitors' bodies and in so doing cements concept</page><page sequence="22">36 Tracy C. Davis 24. &amp; 25. Two exhibits from the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC: the Shoe Exhibit (top), and the Ejyzyski Tower (bottom). (Photo by Peter A. Davis; photo by Timothy Hursley) to experience. As in any realist stage performance, the imaginations of muse- ums' spectator/participants are stimulated by grounding the underlying ideas in material evidence so that "the critical mass of artifacts pronounces a reality" (Crew and Sims 1991:162). Yet it is not merely the embodiment of meta- phor-as when Queer Nation pelts a vacillating politician with waffles (Pick 1993)-that makes these museums' logic succeed.'0 In the performances amidst the "real" thing, the interior movement of the soul and/or mind is only pos- sible through bodily action.</page><page sequence="23">Postmodern Museum 37 The modernist museum which revels in the quest for artistic coherence (formal complexity) is not a thing of the past, but neither is the strategy of triggering viewers to perform the ideology necessarily a technique of the late 20oth century. This is more than a gloss on the correct dating of what is called postmodernism: it suggests a recourse to strategies that may otherwise be ex- plained as borrowing from late 2oth-century theory and empirical research, for similar techniques were deployed in the middle of the last century. Per- haps each case outlined here is a product of chance, intuition, or accident. Yet there is a pattern that characterizes all these examples, no matter how differ- ently or in what complex relationships they activate the museumgoer to per- form the relationship between the artifacts and their setting. These examples are variously concerned with giving a perspective on sexu- ality, ethnicity, race, religion, or nationalism as primary markers of identity. The means by which these constructs are kept separate supports the idea that the display techniques are far from arbitrary and reflect extraordinary control over context on the part of designers. They do not necessarily construct a dominant ideology-they may be resistant, subversive, revisionist, or subcul- tural-but they all place the targeted visitor in an interactive role that requires engagement with the subject matter and ideology, bringing the realist aes- thetic paradox (enhanced by artifacts) sliding into postmodernist practices. Notes I. In one particularly telling scene, Stallone's 199gos criminal character (revived from sus- pended animation into a futuristic L.A. officially purged of free enterprise, advertising, crime, and dissent) bursts into a museum of late 2oth-century memorabilia and streetscapes. 2. McMichael complains that since 1981, when he was more or less forced to resign from the curatorship in anticipation of the McMichael Canadian Collection Amendment Act becoming law in 1982 (turning the museum completely over to the government), con- trol over the direction of acquisitions and presentation irreversibly changed the museum's ambiance, focus, and purpose for the worse (McMichael 1986:406-07). I disagree. The structure is intact, the unique ambiance is preserved, and the association between nation and national art is still unmistakable. 3. The center respects the traditional Blackfoot name as reported by North Peigan Chief John Yellowhorn: One might assume the name "Head-Smashed-In" refers to the unfortunate buf- falo, but according to George Dawson, who worked for the Geological Survey of Canada in the I88os, the name comes from an allegedly true story concerning a Peigan brave who wanted a closer look at the plummeting buffalo. The brave situated himself against the cliff wall, beneath the lip over which the bison charged. He watched from his privileged position as one after another the bison hurtled to their deaths. He was safe for a while, but the pile of bison carcasses grew much higher than he had anticipated, eventually pinning him against the cliff wall. When his fellow tribesmen came to butcher their kill, they were shocked to discover the young brave with his head crushed by the weight of dead and dying buffalo. In the Blackfoot language, this place is called Estipah-Sikikini- Kots, meaning "where he got his head smashed in." (in Reid 1992:17) 4. This appears to be a last-minute decision: an August 1983 document by the Corner- stone Planning Group Limited, Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump Interpretive Centre Facility Program. Prepared for Alberta Public Works Supply and Services and Alberta Culture, consid- ers various locations but recommends that: subject to results of [the] geo-technical survey, the Head-Smashed-In Interpre- tive Centre be located on top of the cliff. This position is chosen primarily be- cause it is able to enhance the interpretation of the site without significant detriment to the appearance of the land form and the integrity of its historic re- sources.

A study of fifth-grade students shows that three weeks after visiting a science museum, the exhibits that are best recalled incorporate one or more of the following characteristics: -It does something that is not immediately obvious-and this probably makes a noise -The thing it does is completely under the control of the visitor -It requires the co-operation of two or more people to discover what it can do -The thing it does lends itself to competition or group play -The distinctive legend or symbol is affixed to the apparatus -The apparatus itself is familiar to the visitor even if the phenomenon it embodies is not -The apparatus or the phenomenon it embodies evokes feelings of mystery, drama, or romance. (Garvin in Belcher 1991:207) The gray figures in the Civil Rights Museum are associated with noise (the bus driver's command, videotapes of lunch counter occupations, and speeches at the Mall) though they are not animatrons; their significance is demonstrated by visitors choosing to move in proximity to them; they invite mimicking play; and they carry the aura of ghosted artifacts. 6. When I first visited the museum in 1992, there was little to see in the corridors follow- ing Room 306, apart from a display case contextualizing events like the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square as "continuations" of the Kingian freedom-fighting legacy. 7. For the effects of "absenting" women from a museum thesis, see Dafna N. Izraeli, "'They Have Eyes and See Not': Gender Politics in the Diaspora Museum," (1993: 5 15-23). 8. I am not interested in resolving the controversies about the historical relationship of modernism to postmodernism. Whether there was a radical or gradual break (or no break at all), whether the terms designate styles or periodicizing concepts, or whether there even is anything that coheres enough to be called postmodernist are not questions I intend to debate. I find David Harvey's (199o) elucidation of the major cultural shifts from the i8th to the late 20th century that account for definite conceptual and aes- thetic shifts convincing. For a full explanation of modernism and postmodernism as co- incidental entities see also Foster (1983). 9. George Bernard Shaw reminds us in Misalliance (1910o) of how this marks the middle class. Mrs. Tarleton, formerly a shop girl and now wife of an underwear manufacturer, recalls her first committee meeting "with a marchioness, two duchesses, and no end of Ladies This and That": I had to go away; but before I was out of the door one of the duchesses- quite a young woman-began talking about what sour milk did in her inside and how she expected to live to be over a hundred if she took it regularly. And me listening to her, that had never dared to think that a duchess could have anything so common as an inside! I shouldnt have minded if it had been children's insides: we have to talk about them. But grown-up people! . . . Thats what theyre like: theyve nasty minds. With really nice good women a thing is either decent or indecent; and if it's indecent, we just dont mention it or pretend to know about it; and theres an end of it. (1963:122-23) Io.
