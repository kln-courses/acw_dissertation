G. G. ROSE 13 Campbell (I9ii) and Basedow (I925) have described the rock carvings at Port Hedland in North-western Australia, and Davidson (I936) has brought the inlformation under one head in his monograph Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings. The two earlier writers collected considerably more information from the aborigines with them at the time than I was able to obtain from my informants when I visited the locality in May, 1942. They did not, however, mention one characteristic subject of these carvings, viz. the considerable number of human feet represented with six digits (see Plate Bi). The carvings are on a fairly coarse limestone ridge about a mile east of the township of Port Hedland on the road to the causeway and '7-mile' aerodrome. The ridge is oppo- site the old native hospital a few score yards south of the road. The carvings extend over a distance of several hundred yards along the ridge, and are in a reasonably good state of preservation despite their apparent antiquity. There are reputedly numerous other rock carvings on Finucane Island, a short distance offshore opposite Port Hedland, which, however, I did not visit. Carvings and intagliations have been described by Wickham (I842) and Stokes (I846) as occurring on Depuch Island between Roebourne and Port Hedland. It would seem likely from the situation of the ridge and the size, shape and considerable number of the representa- tions, that actual feet with six toes were first outlined and subsequently carved out from the rock, and that the extra digit was not a mistake as is sometimes found in con- ventionalized drawings of the hand or foot. The significance of these carvings lies in the fact that we know that six fingers or toes are the manifestation of a recessive gene which would appear most frequently in an inbred community. By consideration of the structures of Australian aboriginal societies Jolly and the present writer (1943) have shown it to be a rational hypothesis that primi- tive society in the earliest nomadic state evolved by the progressive avoidance of incest. The results of 'incest,' or breach of the laws of exogamy, would be the appearance of recessive genes such as six digits on hand or foot, herma- phroditism, deaf-mutism, etc. It can be presumed that the motive behind the representations of the six-toed feet on the ridge at Port Hedland would be something of the nature of suggestive magic. If this hypothesis is accepted a similar interpretation mnight be ascribed to the remarkable and characteristic anthropomorphic paintings, known as Wondjina, in the North-west Kimberleys (Elkin, I93I). Every one of these paintings lacks the two features, ears and mouth, which could well symbolize deaf-mutism, another recessive gene. It is interesting to remark, however, * With Plate B that some of the anlthropomorphic carved figures at Port Hedland have mouths (Plate Bs). I have myself observed deaf-mutism and six-toed feet in Northern Australia, while W. Harney has reported verbally that he had noted herma- phroditism amongst Northern Territory aborigines. Elkin noted that when it was suggested to the natives accompanying him that the Wouidjina figures should have mouths they said that 'It could not be done,' in a mnanner which showed that the representation of mnouths was quite out of the question: moreover Elkin noted that these figures are connected with fertility. On the hypothesis advanced, the original mnotive behind the drawing of these figures was suggestive magic, presumably to rid the comnmunity of the scourge of deaf-mutism. The fact that mouths (and presum- ably ears) could not be indicated and the association of the idea of fertility would both accord with the hypothesis. There is one further noteworthy point in connexion with the Wondjina drawings. This is that the area in which the drawings are found is almost identical with that in which patrilineal moiety societies occur. Jolly and the writer (1943) have postulated that originally these parti- cular societies (Worora, Unambal, Ngarinyin, etc.) were matrilineal and that it was in order to avoid the incest implicit in the mother-in-law taboo (Jolly and Rose, I942), which presumably was not applied too effectively, that the change-over from muatriliny to patrilinyl occurred. Avoidance of this implied incest was facilitated in other inatrilineal moiety societies by the fusion of moiety societies to give progressively section and sub-section societies. But owing to the geographical location of the Worora, etc., this fusion was impossible and the spectre of this incest had to be laid by a change-over from matri- liny to patriliny. The myth of the praying mantis as given by Love (i935) is adduced by Jolly and Rose (I943) as symbolizing this change-over. As far as I am aware only one photograph of the rock carvings at Port Hedland has been published (Basedow, 1925). It is in order to put these carvings on record in a more satisfactory manner than by sketches that the photo- graphs are reproduced. It will be noted that some carvings (Plate B4) are described as beche-de-mer, although Campbell (I9II) and Basedow (1925) have called them boomerangs. It is submitted that the shape is not typically that of a boomerang, being too thick, and the striations seem to indicate a beche-de-mer. Note 1 Consider a simple matrilineal society with moieties A and B. Any man of moiety A can theoretically marry all women in moiety B. His own daughter is of moiety B and hence he could also marry her. If a taboo is introduced on women called 'mother-in-law,' the daughter of these women, whom a man would ipso facto call wife, 13</page><page sequence="3">Nos. I3, I4 Man FEBRUARY, I950 would never be his own daughter and hence he could not commit father-daughter incest providing the taboo was effective and despite the fact that the mother-in-law was in a man's own moiety. In a patrilineal society, on the other hand, a man's daughter is in his own moiety and hence is never available as wife and in this society providing the exogamy of the moieties is enforced a man could never marry his own daughter. The same applies to typical Australian section or subsection societies, where a man can never marry his daughter, as she is in the wrong section or subsection for marriage. References H.
