<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naive Consciousness and Culture Change: An Essay in Historical Structuralism By Harry Berger, Jr. L Introduction In a recent issue of Clio I outlined the rudiments of a general theory'of culture change, a theory which might be able to provide an integrative but non-coercive setting for modes of interpretation in a variety of disci- plines.' The thematic center of the theory is the ecological interaction between homo faber and his environment-that is, the conscious and non- conscious productive processes by which man makes his history, and by which he continually re-creates himself and the world in which he finds himself. I tried in that essay to convert the theme into a set of working definitions and axioms, and from that set to derive a hypothetical model in which processes of culture change were arranged in a probable sequence. One of the obvious requirements of such a theory is that it must distinguish cultural from biological, or historical from evolutionary, considerations, and try at least to interrelate the areas of consideration so distinguished. My purpose in the present essay is to try to meet this requirement by suggesting how a sequential model of culture change may be generated from, and related to, a hypothesis about the character and prejudices of human perception. Before beginning this, however, I should offer a brief structural description of the general theory. The thematic center cited above seems innocuous enough if it only re- fers to man as a creator in his environment and not to man as the creator of his environment: when we call the world real, more than mere fantasy, we generally mean it has been and continues to be shaped by extrahuman as well as human forces. One of the significant gradients of history, in contemporary opinion, is the changing proportion of the creative mix: what we call "reality" appears to us to have been increasingly affected by human forces, and especially by consciously directed productive proc- esses. This opinion must be differentiated from the recognition that post- medieval society has increasingly proclaimed the role played by human '"Outline of a General Theory of Culture Change," Clio, 2 (1972), 49-63. I Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="2">forces in the constitution of reality. But the two propositions are func- tionally interdependent, and they suggest some lines of inquiry that articu- late what men do with how they perceive what they do. For example, you might explore the interplay-at any given time or for a given period of time-between the following two relationships: (1) the relation between man's conscious and nonconscious productive processes, and (2) the re- lation between what appears to man to have been produced by himself and what appears to him to be given, that is, created by non- or transhuman forces. You are then likely to discover a considerable overlap between (1) and (2) owing to the historical fact that much of what has appeared to men to be transcedent in origin has in fact been a human product non- consciously created by man. At this point, and on the basis of this example, let me introduce the basic terms of the theory. When I speak of "a human product noncon- sciously created by man" I refer to such culturally imposed structures as kinship, cosmos, the natural order, divisions of time, and social or- ganization; and to such cognitively or perceptually imposed structures as space, time, objects, and the various categories and relations in which they are ordered. I group all the nonconscious processes by which such structures are generated under the term transposition: transposition may be defined as the nonconscious transfer of structures from man to world such that they appear to be transcendent elements in and of the world. Transcendence in this context refers to whatever appears to man to owe its origins and being to nonhuman sources. Transposition and transcend- ence are two of the three basic terms that carry the weight of the two relationships mentioned in the previous paragraph. The third term, tech- nology, embraces the sum total of consciously directed productive proc- esses, or techniques. Extending the term beyond its normal range, I use technology to refer to all arts and skills of mind or hand-crafts, philos- ophy, music, law, commerce, war, sciences, art, etc.-and all activities aimed at affecting economic, social, and political conditions. Technology and transposition are thus the complementary modes of human creation, while transposition and transcendence have a historically defined affinity since so many structures which in traditional societies were perceived as transcendent have subsequently been re-defined as products of trans- position. To return to our two relationships, we may now substitute the three basic terms: (1) is the relation between technology and transposi- tion, (2) is the relation between technology and transcendence, and the link between (1) and (2) is the relation between transcendence and trans- position. Having defined these terms, I begin with the postulate that technology and transposition are complementary modes of adaptation in man's strug- 2 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="3">gle for existence, and on this basis go on to generate a dynamic model from the changing interplay of the three terms.2 For example, when technology is in its rudimentary stages, transposition is necessarily the dominant adaptive mode by which early man transforms his environ- ment so as to be able to cope with it more adequately. By transposition he restructures "brute nature," metamorphosing its blank features to a source of recognition and communication, and thus establishing the form and context of reality-social, cosmic, divine-within which traditional techniques receive their particular characters and functions. As human techniques develop, the burden of adaptation gradually shifts from trans- position to technology, with two significant and interrelated consequences: (1) the evidence of technical human mastery becomes more conspicuous, encouraging further technological effort and, always in conjunction with that, criticism of technology as ultimately hubristic and futile; (2) the transpositions generated in terms of earlier technical adaptations and ascribed to transcendent forces are jeopardized by skeptical critiques- charges of archaism, anthropomorphism, and projection necessitate de- fenses and revisions of traditional "reality."3 Without going into further detail, I shall simply note that one of the aims served by this dynamic model is the articulation of a set of hypothetical structures which I call forms of cultural and period consciousness. I have discussed some of these in earlier studies,4 and the formulation of the general model allows me to trace the historical careers of these structures as manifestations of the changing interplay of basic terms. Consciousness is currently an overworked and badly abused word, but like instinct it can, if carefully employed, provide some useful heuristic services. I don't propose at this juncture to define it except in a vaguely ostensive manner by indicating three contexts in which it is convention- ally viewed: (1) Consciousness may be studied in terms of the individual. You can explore the consciousnesses of actual persons, and you can also construct hypothetical models of individual consciousness to help you in that exploration. (2) Consciousness may be studied as a cultural config- uration imposed on individuals-as the prevailing set of internalized values, norms, assumptions, prejudices, customs, etc., and-among other 2For a somewhat more detailed (though still cursory) sketch of this interplay, see Clio, pp. 56-61. 3Cf. the four axioms of culture change, Clio, p. 61. 4E.g., the following essays: "The Ecology of the Mind: The Concept of Period Imagina- tion-An Outline Sketch," Centennial Review of Arts &amp; Sciences, 8 (1964), 409-35; "The Renaissance Imagination: Second World and Green World," CR, 9 (1965), 36-78; and "Ecology of the Medieval Imagination: An Introductory Overview," CR, 12 (1968), 279- 313. 3 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="4">things-attitudes toward transcendence, technology, and transposition. (3) Consciousness may be studied at the level of the species: as mem- bers of homo sapiens we all share a single basic perceptual apparatus determined by the neurophysiological makeup of the human organism. Presumably we shall continue to do so as long as the species endures in its current form. I shall refer to this as naive consciousness. Any actual individual consciousness is partly conditioned and shaped by the structures of cultural and naive consciousness, since culture and species are defining aspects of the individual. For purposes of interpre- tation, cultural consciousness and naive consciousness may be abstracted from the context of the actual individual and considered in relation to each other. The remainder of this essay will be devoted to this task. In the following section 1 shall summarize some familiar facts about per- ception, the basis of naive consciousness, in order to identify those pref- erences and biases which have a bearing on various cultural configura- tions of the three basic terms. After that, I shall describe two basic structures of cultural consciousness and suggest how their historical relationships are influenced by the structure of naive consciousness. In my Clio essay, I referred to these cultural forms as traditional and mod- ern, for the sake of simplicity. As the following discussion will show, these terms are misleading and inadequate, and will be replaced by what I hope are more accurate descriptive terms. II. The Prejudices of Naive Consciousness I take as my point of departure Husserl's classic description of the natural standpoint, or natural attitude: I find continually present and standing over against me the one spatio-temporal fact-world to which I myself belong, as do all other men found in it and related in the same way to it. This "fact-world," as the world already tells us, I find to be out there, and also take it just as it gives itself to me as something that exists out there. All doubting and rejecting of the data of the natural world leaves stand- ing the general thesis of the natural standpoint. "The" world is as a fact-world always there; at the most it is at odd points "other" than I supposed... but the "it" remains... a world that has its being out there.5 Phenomenology has illuminated the more or less systematic character of the natural attitude by taking its stand outside the frame of reference of that consciousness and conceiving it not merely as an attitude but as a standpoint, a thesis-a coherently organized set of tendencies and preju- dices the structural order of which may be made explicit by description. This order is nevertheless rooted in the neurophysiological structure of 5ldeas, trans. W.R. Boyce Gibson, ([1931] New York, 1962), p. 96. 4 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="5">the body via our perceptual systems, and because it is an order which frames all our experience and awareness I shall henceforth refer to it as naive consciousness. The reliance on perception should not merely be noted and then ignored. We should view it as the first and most basic prejudice of naive con- sciousness: it commits itself to perception. (It might have been other- wise; human perception and consciousness are products of natural selec- tion.) Merleau-Ponty speaks of the primacy of perception and identifies as its most significant effect, perspectivism: both in space and in time the incarnated perceiving consciousness is positional-restricted to a certain point of view-and therefore its experience is perspectival. Con- sciousness is aware, or may easily be made aware, that it is limited by its bodily standpoint to only a partial view of its objects, that there is always more than is seen in any perception, always other points of view from which to apprehend the object. The object is thus experienced as transcending the perceiver, whose perceptual experience includes at least latent awareness of the object's independent otherness: The "things" in naive experience are evident as perspectival beings: it is essen- tial to them...to reveal themselves only gradually and never completely... I grasp in a perspectival appearance, which I know is only one of its possible as- pects, the thing which transcends it. A transcendence which is nevertheless open to my knowledge....6 Perspectivism and its consequences may also be illuminated by ref- erence to perceptual evolution. James Gibson has observed that many fishes and animals possess something like panoramic eyes, and there- fore have no need of the exploratory eye movements involved in scanning because they had "no especially acute foveal areas in the retinas and no centers of clear vision to correspond. They see equally well in all directions, and they do not have to 'look' in order to see." But since cer- tain directions may have more importance than others, depending on the creature's way of life, "evenly dispersed panoramic vision in all direc- tions is...wasteful, and some animals adapted to this fact by concen- trating the resources of each eye, that is, by a tendency toward fovea- tion." For example, primates developed accurate depth perception (through binocular vision) especially for nearby objects. Frontal foveal development "must be accompanied by the development of the ability to look-that is, to explore... by scanning."7 6Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Structure of Behavior, trans. A.L. Fisher ([1963] Bos- ton, 1967), p. 187. 7The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Boston, 1966), pp. 170, 175. 5 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="6">Because man has a fovea, a concentrated center of clear vision on the retina, he can register detail with considerable precision and discrimi- nation. Because his eyes are directionally oriented, he can only com- prehend the ambient world by successive fixations in time. Because more precise detail is available to him, the awareness of scanning per se is likely to be more conspicuous-he may have to select or inhibit, and at any rate, he has actively to guide his looking. Greater reliance on active and controlled detection would seem to be accompanied by greater dif- ferentiation and intensity of proprioceptive awareness. Our experience of scanning in time, for example, is separated from our experience of the stable and enduring world. This separation ultimately leads to reciprocal enhancement of the differences between subjective and objec- tive poles of experience and, at a more "philosophical" level, between self and other. Man differs from other animals whose visual systems have evolved in this direction because his proprioceptive awareness is at once more intense and more differentiated. If in certain respects he does not see as much or as well as other animals, he is aware of the limitation and consequently aware, so to speak, of what he is not seeing. This perspec- tival awareness is reinforced by the fact that the different senses not only cooperate in enhancing perception, but also cooperate in telling tales on each other-in making each other's limitations available to gen- eral awareness: sight tells us what touch fails to perceive, taste and smell tell us what sight fails to perceive, etc. Thus the senses inform us simultaneously about their own limitations and the transcendence of their objects. In committing itself to perception, naive consciousness therefore commits itself to transcendence. By this I mean that it prefers to ex- perience the structure and order of the perceived world as given to it rather than as constructed by it. Since we tend to accept perceptual experience as accurate most of the time, we normally feel ourselves to be in direct sensory contact with a real world of space-time, objects, persons, and events, and with the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches they give off. And since we experience very little of the mechani- cal operations of perception additional to perceiving itself, we take it for granted that perceiving is a passive activity. Our commitment to what we feel is a passive and accurate process of receiving information from "out there" in the world encourages us to take for granted the reality and transcendence of the external sources of information. It is in this sense that the commitment of naive consciousness to perception reveals a preference for a transcendent world, and a preference for having one's experience of that world automatically determined from outside. This 6 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="7">provides something like a sense of security in our relation to the world: perception is something we don't have to be anxious about; it comes naturally and easily; it is automatic and inborn-naive. When we are told by phenomenologists, psychologists, and others that all this is at best only partly true, then we are pushed to the same con- clusion even more forcefully: naive consciousness reveals a bias toward belief in the automatic passivity and accuracy of perception, toward belief in the transcendence of the perceived world, toward belief that the forms and structures of that world determine the way we perceive them. These beliefs do not square with the facts revealed by sophisticated stu- dents of perception (including poets). Perception is much more active, selective, and constructive than it appears to normal consciousness. Per- ception not only receives data; it also transposes them, and perceptual or congnitive transposition is basic to all other forms of transposition. A bias against recognizing this seems to have been built into naive con- sciousness along with the evolutionary development of perception to its present form. We might have been made to perceive otherwise, and to experience perception differently. Naive consciousness commits itself to a perceptual system which in turn prefers to rely heavily on the distance senses, sight and hearing (especially the hearing of speech), for its most important information. This extends its grasp not only of space but also of time. Seeing a star, for example, contemporizes two now's or moments of present actuality- the star's and the observer's-eons apart in time. We have to remember what we were taught in order to frame that percept in the awareness that the farther away a light source is, the longer ago it was. Visual percep- tion is always perception of the past, however minute the time lag is, yet the percept itself abstracts from the reference to time and nullifies the temporal divergence between the two moments. "Sight is par excel- lence the sense of the simultaneous or coordinated, and thereby of the extensive."8 In his primeval orientation toward the heavens man had, without knowing it, altered the global structure of space time.9 Though it would take millennia to bring that knowledge to light, the solar-stellar orientation itself greatly extended man's control over the local and diurnal organization of experience (as is the case with the polarization of light in bees). And because, beyond a certain distance, our seeing diminishes in precision as it gains in comprehensiveness, the possibility existed from the start that man would articulate and domesticate the distance through transposition. 8Hans Jonas, The Phenomenon of Life ([1966] New York, 1968), p. 136. 9Cf. Erwin W. Straus, "The Upright Posture," in Essays in Phenomenology, ed. Maurice Natanson (The Hague, 1966), pp. 164-92. 7 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="8">Though the perception of stars is an extreme example, the same ab- stractive character of vision is manifest in other ways and dominates the nature of man's engagement with the world. Vision abstracts from physical process-the temporally ordered transmission-of-energy events that underlie seeing-and is thus a relatively quiescent form of experi- ence. As in scanning, vision also abstracts from the temporal sequence of sensations, allowing the identity of the scene or object to be preserved through the succession of changing fixations. In these ways sight differs from hearing, which is more like touch in including physical and me- chanical events as components of the percept. Our auditory system is made to feel the pressure of sound waves as vibrations at the tympanic membrane, while vision screens out the perception of light waves, which travel at much higher frequencies. Thus hearing, unlike sight, has a dynamic vector character; sound is experienced as coming-from-out- there-toward-us.'0 But to the extent that our perceptual field is domi- nated by the influences of visual structuring, it gives priority to space over time. It is primarily through the overlapping distribution of automatically imposed stimuli over the basic orienting system (the statocyst), the haptic system, and occasionally the auditory system, that external real- ity communicates its pressure, its insistence and resistance." But vision is very different, and Hans Jonas describes three characteristics '?Hearing is a mechanical event which seems to have evolved from the basic orienting system-the primitive statocyst (a sac filled with fluid, ciliary or hairlike receptors, and lime or sand granules serving as a weight-a statolith-which may be displaced relative to the sac) which functions in certain invertebrates as the organ of balance and equilibrium. The human statocyst is the inner ear, and like it the outer ear "responds to being shaken, although the shaking is only the minute vibrations of the air." The inner ear "picks up forces of acceleration" and cooperates with touch in registering "the direction of grav- ity," while the input to the auditory system "specifies the nature of vibratory events in the world" and their direction (Gibson, Senses, p. 53). This imposes a physical limit on the distances of auditory sources, and situates us in a directional field of spatial forces which are both gravitational and sonic. Transcendence as a criterion of provenance- reality as that which moves from-there-to-here-is perceptually embodied in the pres- sures and vectors of auditory experience. "Though the interaction between touch and sight is complex, and influential on both, the experiences of "objectivity" provided by touch and sight are opposed in nature: touch gives proximate and pressure-laden experiences of objects, and its information is trans- mitted through tactile sensations, while vision gives distant and pressure-free experi- ences of objects, and visual sensations play little or no role in transmitting visual infor- mation. When we perceive through sensations, as in touch, subject and object are inter- mingled in a more intimate manner. But when the object is abstracted from subjective sen- sations, as in vision, the object is more easily distinguishable from the subject and thus more "impersonal." 8 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="9">which give it a peculiar form of objectivity and make it more abstract: "(1) simultaneity in the presentation of a manifold, (2) neutralization of the causality of sense-affection, (3) distance in the spatial and mental senses." The first is exemplified by scanning, and the second by the absence of radiant vibration from the visual percept: "effacement of causality means disengagement from it... From the onrush and impact of reality, out of the insistent clamor of its proximity, the distance of appearance is won," and effect is replaced by image. Distance involves abstraction in the sense of detachment or disengagement, and not mere- ly at the conscious level proposed by Jonas: "We consciously stand back and create distance in order to look at the world, i.e. at objects as part of the world."12 But the possibility of distance is pre-consciously in- herent in the amplitude of the perceptual field made available by radiant energy, and this possibility is actualized through transposition in "a world," a structured cosmos whose primary sources of stimulation occupy its outermost reaches. At varying depths in the concavity of that world, things appear with what Whitehead called "presentational immed- iacy"; the appearance as such contains no reference to causal relations either among objects or between itself and the perceiver, and in itself it tells us very little about the "intrinsic characters" of the things per- ceived-that is, about their intentions, forms of activity, histories, pos- sible effects on us, and so forth. If there is no pure appearance-no "presentational immediacy"-in the sense just described, it is because we transpose intrinsic characters and thus, through psycho-cultural conditioning, perceive them as transcendent.13 This process is con- cealed and therefore supported by the abstractive detachment of vision which, in its self-awareness, contributes to the perspectival character of "objectivity": Eidos, "appearance," is an object of sense, but not its whole object. In percep- tion external objects are apprehended not merely as "such," but also as "there" ... Perception is intrinsically awareness of such self-giving presences-the experience of the reality of the object as co-existing with me here and now and on its own determining my sensory condition.... But there is this paradox to sense perception: the felt affectiveness of its data... must in part be canceled out again in order to permit the apprehension of its "objectivity"... Some sort of disengagement from the causality of the encounter provides the neutral freedom for letting the "other" appear for it- self.'4 12Jonas, pp. 136, 31, 150. 13Cf. A.N. Whitehead, Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect (Cambridge, Mass., 1928). '4Jonas, pp. 167-68. 9 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="10">The peculiar characteristics of visually dominated perception-dis- tance, abstraction, objectivity, extensive organization of space-time, causal neutrality-make it an ideal vehicle through which to transpose into the world the structures of meaning and causality without which we could not have the orientation presupposed by elective and effective action. It is fashionable nowadays to speak of the brain as a quasi- computer. But it seems just as helpful to think of the world as a com- puter programmed by nonconscious operators working in perceptual and cultural fields of activity. We feed information into the world and receive messages from it. Our aim is to reduce uncertainty and "noise" by set- ting up a restrictive code of symbols designated according to some pre- vious tacit understanding. Through perceptual transposition we appre- hend reality as a significant world which communicates messages that we can read and understand. And in the earlier phases of human experi- ence, long before the computer analogy was available, man transposed message senders, or a Sender, so that he could engage in genuine two- way communication with his computer. The terms of this analogy remind us not to overestimate the contribu- tions of sight to perceptual experience, for it is only in certain respects that it may be called the king or queen of the senses. It shares this domi- nance with the auditory system because of language, and though language may be a second-order phenomenon owing to its conventional or sym- bolic character, there are two familiar reasons for taking seriously the possibility that its role in perception may be more direct and primitive: (1) it demands and presupposes extremely refined acoustic precision within a narrow range, and therefore (2) it must have influenced the character of hearing and its functions vis b vis the other senses during the millennia in which language developed into rudimentary systems for organizing information. Hearing and vision may be considered dialectical foci of human perception, and this view has been set forth by Walter Ong, S.J., in The Presence of the Word (1967) and other studies. The follow- ing brief paragraph is based on a selective distillation of Father Ong's views. Where sight perceives surfaces of objects, hearing and sound offer clues to interiors-physical as well as psychological interiors. Sound communicates interiors revealing themselves; sound is a function of the resonance produced inside the things that resonate. Sound as the spoken word moves from one human "interior" to another, and opens them to each other without physical violation or intrusion. Human encounter is achieved largely through voice. The combination of vision, hearing, and the spoken word produces a greater awareness both of objective others and of subjective others in the world. This too intensifies our sense that 10 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="11">something within others is held in reserve, that we don't make it all out, that there are puzzles in what we see and hear. It makes us want to find out more, to seek security in the belief that we are perceiving what is in fact the case. This underlying urge for security seems connected to the theory that certain functional preferences for socialization may be genetically pro- grammed into perceptual attention: babies display an apparent preference for face-like objects, which may indicate a tendency to look toward par- ticular forms as cues to the sources of security and pleasure. We seem quite early in life to divide others into those like us and those unlike us. From time immemorial, man has divided the world into persons or pres- ences and objects; into those who speak, hear, and understand his lan- guage, and those who don't. We seem intuitively to gravitate toward the former kind; we fasten on self-like others as most important to our wel- fare. Naive consciousness tends toward collective life, seeks the soli- darity of shared awarenesses, and reaches through perception and com- munication toward community. It prefers a world of face-like person- like mother-like father-like womb-like objects, places, and spaces. And, because of our early helplessness, it prefers to commit its future to them, to allow itself passively to be determined from the outside by others. The urge for security and control is manifested in other abstractive preferences of naive consciousness. It may be that the three-tense struc- ture of time governs all life and existence, but it is peculiarly explicit and important for man. Our past and future are clearly demarcated parts of the present. Our actions are directly and indirectly undertaken in terms of habit, memory, foresight, and expectation. We thus widen and deepen the present tense of existence; past and future permeate our con- sciousness in the present tense, and this enables us to abstract ourselves from the immediate present, and to control our consciousness of time. It keeps us from being trapped in a sequence of vanishing point-like in- stants, a narrow one-way tunnel to death. By coordinating the tenses, by storing past and future experience in images, we can spatialize our aware- ness of time. In this respect our three-dimensional experience of time has a countertemporal character. This tendency also informs the preference of naive consciousness for repetitive experience. We learn by imitating, remembering, repeating, and generalizing. The educative value of these processes leads naive consciousness to commit itself to a present tense dominated by the past, and dominated by others-those others who were there when each of us was born, and who were initially our models, protectors, and punishers. Any culture can either encourage or inhibit this conservative preference built into naive consciousness. 11 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="12">The movement from repetition to generalization is a movement from many similar individual experiences to the single class of which they are all instances, and this is another abstractive process: abstraction from a world of sheer individual, eccentric, unduplicated, and unrepeat- able experiences or events, from a world of chaotic flux with which we could not cope. Naive consciousness tends to escape from this possibility of chaos by generalizing and typifying experience-that is, by organizing its data into classes, sets, and categories.15 It further consolidates its ex- perience by committing itself to perceive physical objects rather than dynamic patterns of energy or scattered sense events (the chaotic flux of sense data and sensations). These preferences for repetition, typi- fication, and objectivity disclose a tendency to simplify, organize, and order experience so as to make it more manageable. Repetition and typification also interlock with another preference of naive conscious- ness: its tendency to gravitate toward collective life. The need to transpose meaning and simplify experience seems to be connected with the sensitivity of our perceptual apparatus. Human sense receptors pick up a very rich input of patterned energy from the environment-radiant, mechanical, and chemical patterns in great var- ieties-and recent experimental work in perceptual psychology suggests that there is something like "stimulation overload.'16 There appear to be distinct limitations on the ability of perceptual systems to handle, process, and interpret the data available to them-to turn stimulus en- ergy into information. Every increase in the range and reach of dis- criminative receptivity entails an increase in the need to simplify and organize the rich input so as to realize its informational value. Between the initial reception of any stimulus and the final percept, a great deal of unconscious filtering, classifying, and reorganizing goes on, the aim of which is to enhance clarity and accuracy, and to reduce ambiguity. Both as a patterned system-a grammar-and as a system of signs, language influences the unconscious processing of perceptual input. It '5Aristotle long ago discussed typification under the aspect of the universal, the mental correlate of the class nature or substantial form embodied in the individual members of any class or species. In the Posterior Analytics he remarks that "though the act of sense- perception is of the particular, its content is universal-is man, for example, not the man Callias" (100a17). Recent accounts of typification have replaced the objectivist by a phenomenological standpoint, but they approach the process in essentially the same way, as an originary process shaping perception and not an abstraction from prior experience. Cf. Maurice Natanson, "The Phenomenology of Alfred Schutz," Inquiry, 9 (1966), 150ff. 16See George A. Miller, "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two," in Read- ings in the Psychology of Cognition, ed. R.C. Anderson and D.C. Ausubel (New York, 1965), pp. 241-67. 12 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="13">helps simplify and recode an input which might otherwise be a source of confusion and uncertainty. But language is double-edged: in its po- tential complexity and richness it is the source of new confusions. Vision and hearing, because they are highly developed and specialized senses, are also potential sources of confusion. The vividness yet muteness of visual objects and the indefinite "etcetera" of the visual field stretch- ing away from the eye-these invite more strenuous efforts to improve object-recognition. The richness of the auditory field, enhanced by myriad voices of men, forces the perceiver continually to impute mean- ings to their patterned murmurs, and motives to their ingathered pres- ences. Such ever-present sources of uncertainty lead to more drastic strategies of clarification. Confronted with both possibilities-chaos and order-naive consciousness inclines toward order and clarity not only because this reduces anxiety but also because order and clarity seem gratifying in themselves. In all these ways, then, perception is not only a passive receiver but also an active transposer. Yet, as I noted earlier, naive consciousness prefers not to notice the margin of transposition. It ignores the contri- butions of the brain and central nervous system to the structure of sense data. It takes no account of the fact that our perceiving is significantly modified by neurophysiological processes. It overlooks the cognitive in- fluence of intelligence-logical, linguistic, mathematical, and symbolic structures-on the form of our perceptions. It attributes the forms of perceiving to the structure of the transcendent world and objects which are perceived. It commits itself, once more, to the primacy of the world outside the self, to others, to external influence. This relieves it of uncertainty, ot the need to make up its own mind and make its own in- terpretations, of the need to take its destiny in its hands and be respons- ible for its own survival. It gravitates toward an external collectivity- a culture-which will satisfy these needs. Thus it gravitates toward cul- ture, as embodied in the social world in which it first finds itself. All the characteristics which I have described in the preceding pages suggest to me that naive consciousness is the product of adaptive de- velopment toward a particular, coherently organized set of tendencies and capacities. This means that we may conjecture another set of pos- sibilities which it avoids or denies. The emphasis here is on conjecture, for I take my cue from some speculations by Freud which are quite ex- plicitly mythical, or should be seen as such. Consider, for example, the following two evolutionary events: (1) the evolution of perception toward a system dominated by the special features of sight, hearing, and lan- guage; and (2) the evolution of a hominid toward homo sapiens, a crea- 13 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="14">ture who not only lives and dies but also has a conception of life and death; who not only lives in the world but who is what he is because, in Wilfrid Sellars' words, "he has a conception of himself as man-in-the- world." These two events have one pattern in common: a shift of the center of gravity from "behind" or "beneath" consciousness to "within" and "beyond" consciousness. Freud has focused on this tendency of man to externalize-to widen and deepen the objective space perceived by consciousness, and find his orders and solutions there. He posits a view of development based on differentiation of a secondary outer-directed ego from the primary inner- directed id. And he speculates that this is partly an accommodation to external pressure, but partly also an escape from internal pressure. Hence it is both a facing outward toward "nature" and a defensive flight toward "culture." Behind this flight is the specter of a psyche with only an id, driven only by death instincts and the pleasure principle, largely cut off from the external world, dominated by kinesthetic and tactile affect, unable to distinguish clearly between objects and states of feel- ing, fixed in its singular existence, less cognizant of space than of time- or rather of the duration measured by its affective oscillations. In this creature, even the instincts ot self-preservation, should they exist, would serve the death instincts by helping "to assure that the organism should follow its own path to death, and to ward off any possible ways of return- ing to inorganic existence other than those which are immanent in the organism itself," for this creature-following the pleasure principle which is a function of the death instincts-strives to regain the inorganic state, unconscious and therefore pain-free, from which it originally arose, and "wishes to die only in its own fashion,"'7 In the Freudian myth, this truncated psyche is what perception "fears," as the ego fears the id. All the biases built into the structure of naive consciousness are biases against mortality, finitude, and death; against an experience of time as mere disappearing flux, an entropic tide carry- ing us swiftly and helplessly to the appointed end. There is a bias against the prison of inwardness or pure subjectivity, against a consciousness held captive within the body, blind to the world and slave to its own sen- sations and feelings. There is a bias against a state of perpetual anxiety caused by dim and vague experiences of what moves, presses, or threat- ens the self from beyond it. lhere is a bias against a life which can com- mand only two forms of behavior, advance and retreat, and two forms of response, attraction and repulsion. The preferences of perception seem 17Beyond the Pleasure Principle, trans. James Strachey (New York, 1950), p. 51. 14 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="15">to deny or avoid this mythical id-like existence as if it existed within or beneath consciousness, as if it was its constant shadow, the nightmare from which it is always struggling to awaken. To be the slave of destruc- tive time, pure inwardness, and absolute singularity; to be blindly driven by fatal forces always close as touch yet never known: from this night- mare, perception and naive consciousness embody in their evolved struc- ture a perpetual escape toward space, toward the sun, toward others, to- ward a changeless or repeatable present, toward community, toward a secure, familiar, comprehensible, smiling, cradling, mothering, father- ing world. Therefore naive consciousness reduces its fundamental anxiety at the cost of uniqueness and freedom, and does so by committing itself to culture which is-like any antidote to anxiety-not merely an order, but an overorder. III. Naive Consciousness and Cultural Consciousness: The Ontogenetic Hypothesis What would be required of a culture which would help naive conscious- ness fulfill its desires and avoid its anxiety? It would obviously have to assert the primacy of the past over the present; of space over time; of patterns of recurrence over the meaningless and fortuitous flux of his- tory; of the collective over the individual; of self-like presences over hostile, threatening, nameless forces; of gods over men. It would have to rely heavily on transposition, denying creative responsibility, so that the world order it constructs would appear to it as transcendent rather than constructed. In defending against anxiety (and also, in exercising a tendency toward creative play) naive consciousness would demand of its culture two characteristics: (1) Overorder, the ability to make the universe into an absolutely comprehensible and poemlike unity, make it intellectually satisfying- even logical, mathematical, and geometrical in its perfection of form. What we think of as the peculiar characteristics of man-made structures in art or science, this culture would display as the marks of transcendent reality. What for us are the conscious achievements of human intelligence, would be presented by this culture as the work of the gods. The same human intelligence is at play in both their world and ours, but in the former its creative activity is primarily nonconscious: it conditions the character of perception and passes directly into the world. (2) The less man is aware of such creative activities, the more he is controlled by them and passive to them; the more he feels determined by the struc- tures he has transposed. The second characteristic demanded by naive consciousness of its culture is the ability to implant a sense of passivity 15 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="16">and determinism in its members. Since naive culture has to do the work done by "instinct" in other species, since it has to replace the kind of genetic programming built into individual organisms in other species but not in man, it must close down very tightly on its members. The culture of naive consciousness would have to apply the criteria of overorder and determinism to whatever forms of social organization it might develop. Human institutions would have to appear given and in- evitable, natural and unalterable. Every man would have to be assigned his appropriate status and role in the social system in such a way as to feel that it was his by nature, part of his being, the essence that identifies him and gives him his place in the world. In sociological jargon, all roles, statuses, and functions should be ascribed rather that achieved. This can best be done by encouraging beliefs in the embeddedness of society in the real ("natural" or "divine") order, and by cloaking political, social, and economic relationships in the forms and idioms of kinship. The architecture of kinship, one of the most elemental cultural transpositions, satisfies a number of requirements. It gives the appearance of trans- cendence; it is, in its formal elegance and logical symmetry, a model of overorder; it is adaptable to a variety of ecological situations; it fea- tures the conservatism of relationships dominated by parents and elders, by ancestors and spirits of the dead, by the gods and the natural universe to which blood relationship (real or fictive) belongs. Through kinship the social ego may be welded to the individual as his inmost being and may be saturated with all the values, beliefs, customs, behavior pat- terns, and techniques of the culture: the whole of the culturally trans- posed world may bear in on the ego/self and cling to it. Thus culture may come to have the force and inevitability of the instinctual, the natural, and the sacred. Since the socio-political order of naive culture should not appear either created or alterable by man, it must not be presented as the product of intelligence, intellectual systematizing, or philosophical con- ceptualizing, nor of social contracts and constitutional conventions. Men should learn that it is divinely and naturally instituted-conferred by divinity and rooted in the biological order of family, blood, and genera- tion. Social institutions, as they change or develop, should be presented as imitating and fulfilling a preordained pattern, a principle of order existing before and outside the society in the sacred origins of nature. Such beliefs may be reinforced by a familiar form of transposition and overorder: extending the society's particular model of organization to the world and the gods, so that they appear organized in families, lineages, tribes, states, and other socio-political hierarchies. Note the reversal 16 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="17">produced by transposition: the copy and the original change places; the transposed copy becomes the transcendent paradigm from which the hu- man society derived its patterns. A culture such as I have just described is logically constructed to realize the partly adaptive and partly escapist preferences of naive con- sciousness.'8 It is the hypothetical ideal toward which naive conscious- ness, as I have depicted it, would aspire. It is therefore logically and ideally the first position in any putative cultural sequence. For this rea- son it may as well be called primitive culture. As a hypothetical model it has of course many characteristics ordinarily associated with the great variety of actual cultures which anthropologists subsume under the term primitive or tribal. Though I clearly had some of these in mind-I might otherwise have deduced an entirely different set which could equally well have met the requirements-my point is that they can be deduced as if they were logical consequences of the structure of naive conscious- ness. They can also be derived from my hypothesis about the early con- figuration of the three basic terms-that is, the set of the characteristics that define a culture as primitive most completely and explicitly dis- plays the interwoven primacy of transposition and transcendence as the basis of adaptation. But this is only the beginning. How do we get from there to here, from primitive to modern? Is it simply by the more or less mechanical or pseudodeductive process of working the transformations on the basic terms, superimposing the derived sequence on selected historico-cul- tural cavalcades, and exclaiming at the results? Can any appeal be made beyond the primitive terms and axioms of the theory, either to some empirical basis or to some different theoretical matrix? If naive con- sciousness is by definition unchanging (and thus conservative) throughout the epoch of Man on earth, and if cultural consciousness is defined by the general theory as constantly changing, how can these two models be mediated? I see two possible sources of enlightenment here, and two '8And also to reinforce its dogmatism. Infallible authority and certainty "are psycho- logically much stronger in their appeal than any other criteria of belief, for all others suggest caution, some degree of doubt, and some insecurity. An ultimate appeal to auth- ority takes all responsibility off the mind of the knower and affords him a feeling of pro- tection... It is worth noting that all, or practically all, the knowledge of primitive so- cieties is based on authority either in the form of mythology or of practical skills passed along as cultural tradition. The strength of tradition, and the feeling of security which it assumes, could hardly be immediately supplanted by anything so delicately balanced and apparently so flimsy as a hypothesis or a probability estimate" (Stephen Pepper, World Hypotheses [1942]. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1961, pp. 17-18). See Sections 4 and 5 below for the transition to a culture dominated by hypothetical thinking. 17 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="18">related formal patterns which the sources can yield. The sources are (1) individual consciousness or some model of same, and (2) the dynamic structure of naive consciousness, whose equilibratory stability seems polarized between its preferred self-image and its unperceived processes. The formal patterns are (1) developmental and (2) dialectical, the former, obviously, generated from the study of models of individual con- sciousness, the latter from the polarity of naive consciousness. In this section and the next, I shall explore the developmental pattern, and in section 5, the dialectical pattern. Behind this procedure is the assump- tion that only some such complementary yoking of disparate perspectives can do justice to the complex phenomena which the theory aspires to illuminate. In establishing a link between naive and cultural consciousness, I should note that my account of the tormer was elaborated with reference to the species and was therefore concerned with a static description of struc- ture. But in any hypothetical model of individual consciousness, naive consciousness is subject to processes of development, and-though we can never be precise or certain about this-it would appear that the cru- cial early phases of development are, in their general structural out- lines, generic to the species. 1 mean no more by this statement than E.H. Lenneberg means when he observes that all language systems, however diverse, display three common features which may be posited as bio- logically (rather than culturally) determined possibilities and prefer- ences: phonology, concatenation, and grammaticality.19 The distinction is between biologically determined structuring tendencies and the par- ticular structures elaborated in cultural contexts. The developmental model 1 choose to employ is Piaget's, mainly be- cause it is in many respects isomorphic with the transposition-to-tech- nology pattern which I have been exploring. The basic concept binding the two is the relation of abstraction to developed consciousness. Abstraction is used here in an active sense, that is, abstractiveness. Ab-+ trahere bears connotations not only of activity but also of deliberate activity. To abstract is to abstract from something else; something else had to be there before you began abstracting. And in Piaget's perspective, abstrac- tion is not only an act of consciousness, a special focusing of attention, it is also a bringing into consciousness. What was there before the bring- ing into consciousness? Something there in the world but not here in con- sciousness. Yet not merely and only there in the world, but placed there by transposition, and therefore here "beneath" consciousness as well. 19"Language, Evolution, and Purposive Behavior," in Culture in History: Essays in Honor of Paul Radin, ed. Stanley Diamond (New York, 1960), pp. 875-83. 18 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="19">Abstractiveness, which is already an originary tendency of naive con- sciousness (see the remarks on visual perception above), is the basis for all consciously guided processes of thought and action from which issue the products of human technology.20 Piaget teaches that the earliest activities of behavior and perception are vitally affected by formal-that is, form-producing-processes of intelligence.21 These processes are essentially logical and mathematical in nature: intelligence not only distinguishes objects from each other, numbers them, serializes them, and combines them in classes or sets. It also constructs the objects themselves, as well as the system of space, time, and matter in terms of which objects are perceived. But unlike logic and mathematics, these primary processes of intelligence are not the objects and instruments of conscious thought; through transposition, their structures travel unnoticed from the psyche to find lodgings in the world. With the help of parents, naive consciousness assures children that the results of these transpositions are transcendent and real. At a certain phase in his growth, the child develops, and begins to master, such concepts as time, space, number, and causality. These con- cepts are conscious, but still bound to sensory experiences, to concrete acts and situations, and therefore Piaget calls the processes that pro- duce them concrete operations of intelligence. Children who perform them "are usually incapable of them when they cease to manipulate objects and are invited to reason with simple verbal propositions." These operations are constantly tied to particular actions, and emerge as re- actions to or reflections of them. Hence they are not yet fully abstract: concrete thinking is imitative and reactive, rooted in perceptual experi- ence of the world, confined within the categories and images of naive consciousness. Though formal intelligence has not yet become fully aware of itself, its constructive processes shape the world which condition concrete behavior and thought. 20The whole of Jonas' discussion of relationships among perception, vision, abstraction, and human freedom is illuminating: Phenomenon of Life, pp. 135-82. 2IThis account of Piaget's theory will of course be grossly oversimplified, centering only on those themes relevant to the present discussion. In certain respects, the over- simplification has advantages because it allows me to avoid special problems raised by Piaget's approach and experimental method, and because it identifies a general develop- mental thesis about which there is some consensus among psychologists. I would have preferred to use the developmental concepts and terms of L.S. Vygotsky as expressed in Thought and Language, but it is a skeletal and too restrictively cognitive presentation: not enough of Vygotsky's work is yet available either in published or translated form. For Piaget's ideas I have drawn chiefly on The Psychology of Intelligence, The Origins of Intelligence in Children, and selected essays (see next note). 19 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="20">Thought becomes abstract when it breaks free from this concrete dependency, becomes self-conscious and liberated-abstracted-from the limits imposed by perception. Piaget's term for this level of thinking is formal operations, but since I want to distinguish more clearly be- tween conscious and nonconscious formal processes, I shall substitute the term abstract thought. What... are the conditions for the construction of abstract thought? The child must not only apply operations to objects--in other words, mentally execute possible actions on them-he must also "reflect" these operations in the absence of objects ...This "reflection" is thought raised to the second power. Concrete thinking is the representation of a possible action, and abstract thinking is the representa- tion of a representation of possible action... Abstract operations...are applied to hypotheses or propositions... and provide thinking with an entirely new ability that detaches and liberates thinking from concrete reality and permits it to build its own reflections and theories.22 Withdrawing from concrete actuality into its own domain, abstract thought is not restricted to logical, analytical, and mathematical activity; it is more generally hypothetical in that it concerns itself with alternatives to the actual world in the realms of possibility. Abstract thinking em- braces the exploration of the possible; not only in the experimental "If ...then" of science and philosophy, but also in the fictional "If' and "As-if' of art. At its highest levels, abstract thinking frees itself from the concrete particularity of perception, and from the prejudices of naive consciousness by moving toward systems of greater generality which contain the world given in perception as only one among a number of possible systems; and on this basis it may turn back to re-structure, re-imagine, or re-cognize concrete experience in new and different worlds in art as well as in science, mathematics, and philosophy. Development as Piaget traces it is thus a process of continuous ab- straction in which self-conscious intelligence is drawn out of its hiding- places in naive consciousness and the world, a process in which the objects of abstract thought are disengaged from the concrete conditions of space, time, and the external world. Piaget remarks that intelligence is initially "entangled in a network of relations between the organism and the environment" and does not at first "appear as a power of reflec- tion." Abstraction proceeds by differentiation: the activity of intelli- gence "progresses simultaneously in the conquest of things and reflec- tion on itself," and it may ultimately become the most immediate factor of conscious life: "physiological and anatomical organization gradually 22Six Psychological Studies, trans. Anita Tenzer, ed. David Elkind (New York, 1968), p. 63. 20 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="21">appears to consciousness as being external to it and intelligent activity is revealed for that reason as being the very essence" of the selfs existence. To discuss abstraction in the context of developmental psychology is to discuss it out of the context of history. But this brief outline gener- ates some painfully obvious inferences which will lead us back toward the relationship of naive consciousness to the sequential model of cul- tural consciousness. The first two inferences are virtually tautological. Since abstraction by definition presupposes something prior from which one abstracts, it must follow its antecedent chronologically as well as logically. And since abstract thought frees itself from concrete experi- ence and transcends the influence of perception, it must be counterper- ceptual-just as abstract systems of quantum physics and relativity physics are counterperceptual. The most advanced stages of conscious formal intelligence radically challenge the biases of naive conscious- ness. Finally, abstraction, especially in its advanced stages, demands effort, discipline, and skill. For these reasons abstract thought which is so refined as to be historically significant is bound to be an improb- able phenomenon, a rare and late cultural manifestation, achieved by relatively few members of most societies, and dominating very few societies in history. I have simplified Piaget's model in order to restrict attention only to the two levels of formal intelligence-concrete and abstract thought- which will be applicable to a developmental view of culture change. On this basis, we may posit the following analogy between individual and cultural development: individual and cultural forms of consciousness both begin their careers under the aegis of naive consciousness, and both develop along similar lines through a concrete toward an abstract phase. To distinguish the two contexts let me arbitrarily assign names to the cultural versions of concrete and abstract thought, calling the former empirical and the latter hypothetical; the reasons for using these terms will be given in the next section. Following Piaget's develop- mental logic, we can describe empirical cultures as those which are more firmly rooted in naive consciousness and which represent struc- tured extensions of its prejudices. Their world views, institutional or- ders, and technologies may be expected to reveal the characteristics of concrete behavior and thought. Advanced abstract thought, always cen- tered in the minds of individual men, is likely to be a threat to the col- lective unity and security, the traditional authority and continuity, which the culture preserves in order to maintain itself. On the other hand, hypothetical cultures may be described as those which reveal the domi- 21 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="22">nance of advanced abstract thought in the structure of world views, in- stitutions, and technologies. These cultures (a) must be assumed to have encouraged abstract thought by allowing greater freedom to, and by placing higher value on, individual self-assertion and development. We may also assume that (b) their institutional structures and technol- ogies will be reciprocally affected by that development: (a) and (b) are functionally interdependent. The cultural extensions of naive conscious- ness and its prejudices will be challenged; continual pressure will be exerted on the norms that encourage the individual to adopt a relatively passive stance toward the linked authorities of perception and tradition. But this way of translating Piaget's developmental phases into cul- tural attitudes can't be right: if concrete = empirical and abstract = hypothetical, then I am saying that a culture, like a person, moves from infancy to maturity and that in its earlier phases it is childlike in being determined by the processes of concrete thought and behavior. This transfer of concepts from the individual to the collective structure, and from "nature" to culture, produces the ontogenetic fallacy, that is, that we can study development in culture as if it were a large-scale version of development in the individual, and that this is justified on the principle that "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny," or in this case that "phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny." Many so-called primitive and archaic societies have been called childlike because the surviving evi- dence suggests that they were dominated by intuitive and concrete be- havior, and this assumption sometimes crops up in its debased form: not only the cultures of such societies but all their members must be victims of arrested development. This error can be avoided by taking Piaget's model into account in a negative manner, that is, by asserting its inapplicability. We have to begin by assuming that the individual members of any society have com- pleted each his own personal progress through Piaget's stages of develop- ment, and that there is no reason a priori why we shouldn't find either highly developed individuals or highly developed cultures at all times in history. Concrete behavior is not freely adopted but deterministically shaped-chiefly by psychophysical mechanisms and processes-during a relatively early phase in the progress of formal intelligence from its unconscious to its fully conscious states. But empirical refers to a cul- turally imposed attitude which presupposes full development in the individual and may involve conscious control of cognitive techniques characteristic of abstract thought. The empirical attitude is a general way of looking at things, that is, a world view. Thus we must assume two forms and levels of abstract thought, empirical and hypothetical. 22 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="23">The former bears structural resemblances to concrete thought and be- havior in the relationships between transposition and the forms of con- scious thought and technology which characterize the attitude. But the individual's reactions to this particular set of relationships may vary from the most rudimentary to the most sophisticated, and from unthink- ing acceptance to ideological assertion.23 Abstracted from the tissues of cultural forms and considered by itselt, the empirical attitude is a philosophically respectable mode of conscious thought and behavior in- fluenced but not inexorably determined by the same structural condi- tions that confine concrete thought and behavior in a more rigorous fashion. Piaget's model is both structural and chronological: it consists of a sequence of overlapping but analytically separable structures each of which has its own generalized and definable character, for example, sensory-motor, intuitive, concrete, and abstract structures of behavior and thought. It also consists of rough age sequences to which the struc- tures are correlated. Piaget treats these correlations flexibly, but more importantly, he assumes that the two sequences may be uncoupled so that the structural sequence can be examined apart from actual chron- ogy. The significant factors of growth lie less in the younger/older relationships of actual childhood than in the before/after relationships that lead one structure to be transformed into the next. This suggests how we can convert the ontogenetic fallacy to an ontogenetic hypothesis: we do not posit a two-term analogy between a child and a culture, but rather an isomorphism between two models-child and culture-mapping out a structure of relationships common to both. The common structural features center on the degree to which formal operations of intelligence are consciously or unconsciously exercised, the degree to which they are embedded in or abstracted from concrete experience-that is, the degree to which thought and technology are conditioned by the cooper- ating influences of perceptual and cultural transpositions. For example, the sequential structures grouped together under the label childhood are characterized by the primacy of transposition and 23It may be useful to set forth the following presuppositions to forestall misunderstand- ing: I assume that at any time in history, and in any culture, there will be both kinds of thinkers, empirical and hypothetical (and in any individual, both kinds of thought, depend- ing on the contexts or objects of thought); that cultures may discourage or encourage ad- vanced abstract thought by the structure of their institutions; and that in some cultures advanced abstract thinking may be institutionally inhibited yet developed and expressed by rare individuals. In Saving The Appearances, Owen Barfield has described two similar levels of abstraction as alpha-thinking and beta-thinking. 23 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="24">therefore by the transcendence of the structures of order that shape the child's world. Since he is unaware of the extent to which he has contrib- uted to that order, he experiences it as real, accepting it with cer- tainty and conviction. Similarly, the members of a society may be cul- turally encouraged to accept the reality of their world with "childlike" certainty and conviction. In both cases, the prejudices of naive con- sciousness are reinforced by the agents of authority and legitimized as the conditions of life. Experience is dominated by norms which bear the authority of the past and of some legislative source transcending the human agents. The authority of the norms is taken for granted even if the human agents of authority may be challenged. Since the influence of transposition dominates, technology will be governed by the empirical attitude (see below). But as technology develops and takes over crea- tive functions of formal intelligence initially exercised through trans- position, the emergence of the hypothetical attitude as a significant cultural force becomes more probable. And as the institutions of cul- ture begin to encourage the development of advanced abstract thought, they gradually come to receive its imprint. Yet anyone looking back through recorded history must be struck by the extreme rarity of that development. For we find in cultures of the most varied sorts a widespread tendency to inhibit or discourage the hypothetical attitude so that, although it may be developed and ex- pressed by individuals, it does not gear functionally into the institu- tional order. The most significant processes of classifying, organizing, systematizing, etc., tend either to be carried on primarily through transposition, or to be carried on as technical efforts to imitate, re- flect, and analyze those structures given through transposition. Thus genuine alternatives to the existing order are not easily envisaged. Be- cause of this, and because of the inherent difficulty of advanced ab- stract thought, a culture dominated by the hypothetical attitude is an improbable phenomenon. The basic cultural sequence elaborated here may seem to have no foundations in experience, and to be generated entirely in terms of the fairly arbitrary set of definitions and hypotheses which constitute the general theory. The ontogenetic hypothesis, however, provides a par- tial remedy by suggesting a ground in the relation between individual development and cultural change. Following Piaget, I have distinguished empirical from hypothetical structures as embodiments of two degrees of abstraction, the first clearly more subordinate and responsive to concrete experience, the second more removed from it. Piaget's model allows us to posit as a constant of human experience the priority in time 24 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="25">of transpositional to technical influences, of concrete to abstract be- havior and thought, and of empirical to hypothetical degrees of abstrac- tion. In the individual this sequencing seems generically determined. In cultural sequence it is not. Yet something similar seems to happen, since in cultures, as in individuals, the functional dominance of hypo- thetical abstraction is a late and improbable event. The ontogenetic hypothesis, then, asserts that since this sequence is always the case for individuals, we can expect it to influence the pattern of cultural change, and thus can expect the empirical attitude to precede the hypothetical in time as the dominant cultural factor. IV. The Empirical and Hypothetical Attitudes: A Developmental Perspective In the Clio essay I sketched an epitome of the general model of cul- ture change as a shift from "traditional" to "modern" attitudes, noting that those terms had little meaning beyond their reference to the fact that one attitude precedes and generates the other. I can now replace "trad- itional" by "empirical" and "modern" by "hypothetical." "Empirical" is already laden with connotations which have little to do with the way I want to use the word, but 1 have decided to risk employing it here be- cause its earlier history yields very precise indications of the attitude I wish to describe. The term derives from a Greek word for experience, and there is also an archaic sixteenth-century English word, empiric, which refers to a quack doctor who depends on observation and experi- ence to the exclusion of science and theory. Leibniz criticized men who, he said, behave like animals in so far as the sequence of their percep- tions and actions is determined only by what they have observed and remembered; in this they resembled the empirical physicians who prac- tice without any theory. And, he goes on to say, we are all empiricists in three-fourths of our actions. Leibniz is critical because he was a hypothetical thinker in an age during which the empirical attitude was being defined in historical perspective, and challenged. But stripped of their pejorative tone, his remarks pinpoint the meaning I want to empha- size: A mode of thought, a general attitude, a form of cultural conscious- ness which is empirical begins and ends with the world as experienced in naive consciousness. Unlike quack doctors, empirical thinkers may be exceptionally scientific and theoretical; but even their science and theory is ultimately determined by the concrete structure of what they have transposed, observed, and remembered. The word hypothetical suggests in general the fact that something is a mind-made construct, a product or process of conscious deliberation. 25 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="26">But the term has various shades of meaning. It may be viewed at one extreme as counterfactual-unquestionably fictional, imaginary, or make- believe, as when we dismiss someone by saying, "that's a hypothetical question," that is, not worth asking because it refers to a state of af- fairs that couldn't possibly exist. It may mean conjectural, uncertain, with the implication that doubts outweigh assurances: "That's pretty hypothetical; what's your evidence?" It may mean conditional-experi- mental, provisional, tentative-with the implication that it is open to future determination, and may be positively resolved: "teachers oper- ate on the hypothesis that the student may be stirred into useful mental activity by having his opinions challenged." And it may mean inferred, posited, laid down as a premise, supposed or presumed from other actual evidence (or, in deductive thinking, from other premises) to be really the case. "My hypothesis is that when the sun goes down it will be dark"; "if all men are mortal, and Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal." The implication in the first example is that it is not yet the case, but that it almost certainly will be the case; in the second, that if you adopt these premises, that one must certainly follow. Yet even these inferential hypotheses imply a kind of conditionality. These premises need not be adopted, and in fact there are alternatives to a logic based on a transitivity which verges on tautology. Furthermore, the if-then reminds us to take into account the "conditionality" of relevant condi- tions. In the first of the two inferential examples, the phrase "My hy- pothesis is that..." effectively pushes the conditionality of when toward that of if: "if the sun goes down it will be dark." We might conceive of alternatives in which the sun does not go down, or in which it will re- main light after the sun goes down. We know too that "the sun goes down" expresses our perceptual response to the counterperceptual fact, "the earth turns round." Hobbes's statement about the conditionality of knowl- edge may be exaggerated by its nominalistic context, but it helps us drive the wedge between the absolute or dogmatic "tone" of the knowl- edge based on empirical "fact"-on observation and memory-and the tone of that based on hypothetical reasoning: No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come. For, as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally, sense; and ever after, memory. And for the knowledge of consequence,... it is not absolute, but condi- tional. No man can know by discourse, that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; which is to know absolutely: but only, that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be: which is to know conditionally....24 24Leviathan, ed. Michael Oakeshott (Oxford, 1960), p. 40. See also Oakeshott's intro- duction, pp. xxiii-xxiv. 26 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="27">To exemplify how these two modes-empirical and hypothetical-may be transferred from the ontogenetic to the cultural model, I shall de- scribe two familiar forms of abstraction, the first of which is more, and the second less, responsive to concrete experience.25 In the first, you abstract the "essence" or basic idea of anything in order to understand it better; you eliminate irrelevant or accidental aspects. Thus Aristote- lian-Thomistic epistemology holds that the mind abstracts the essence of a perceived object from the concrete image presented to the senses, drawing a universal concept out of a particular percept. The theory fur- ther assumes that the concept is automatically registered, passively re- ceived and abstracted. This makes it possible to view all simple con- cepts as accurate copies of essences in the real world. These concepts supply the raw data for the more complex and conscious mode of abstrac- tion that characterizes reasoning: the activity of judgment, in which con- cepts are defined, separated, and combined. The aim of judgment is to produce knowledge of the object as it truly is-that is, to return to the perceived individual with an understanding of its form and matter, its essential and accidental structures, and the relations between them. This theory presents knowledge as a sophisticated extension of the kind of abstraction which Piaget assigns to the level of concrete thought. However creative and independent the activity of judgment is, it remains an articulated reflection of something already in the world-and the most comprehensive and summary judgment is the cosmological dogma, "there is one real world." The intellect may selectively abstract a variety of perspectives on the world, or theories about it, but all are understood as parts abstracted from a prior and transcendent whole; all are contained and fulfilled in the one reality that environs the mind of man. From the formula, "nothing is in the intellect which was not first [deposited] in the senses," another (medieval) formula logically fol- lows: "truth is the adequation of thought to thing": what the mind con- ceives is valid to the extent that it corresponds to the given structure of the world outside the mind. By this theory, the prejudices of naive consciousness are both confirmed and reinforced.26 25For a related discussion to which I am obviously indebted, see Lewis Mumford, Tech- nics and Civilization ([1934] New York, 1963). 26While Platonic and illuminationist epistemologies explicitly rely less on the senses and more on the activity of mind their principles are (1) permeated by perceptual (chief- ly visual) terms and metaphors, and (2) expressly mimetic in their dependence on a transcendent order which provides the paradigms and, in some theories, the motive force of thought, relfection, and noetic vision. For a concise and stimulating account of med- ieval theories, see M.H. Carr&amp;, Realists and Nominalists (Oxford, 1946). 27 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="28">The second kind of abstraction is an act of fictive construction. As opposed to the concept, the abstract construct does not mirror pre-exist- ing essences or qualities in nature. It disengages abstract objects from the empirical conditions of space, time, and the external world, re-de- fines them in logical, imaginary, or quantitative terms, and re-locates them in a purely hypothetical space or world different from the world given in experience. The aim of construct formation is to investigate, discover, or invent something which was not first in the senses, because it is felt either that the senses are basically unreliable-active and crea- tive rather than passive and mimetic-or that genuine understanding can only be reached by choosing frames of reference which entail rejection (or reconstruction) of the given. Once thought has thrown off the yoke of naive consciousness it tends to disengage itself from the "monocosmic" environment of empirical culture and organize its life situation into a set of heterocosms, whose hypothetical and disjunctive character I have discussed elsewhere.27 Such studies as World Hypotheses, by Stephen Pepper, are paradigms, or perhaps caricatures, of the viewpoint ot hypothetical culture. Pepper reduces the variety of world theories to tour basic kinds, each gener- ated from a particular root metaphor, and each developed by construc- tive abstraction to "the highest available degree of structural corrobora- tion." And Pepper testifies to the skepticism with which the hypothetical attitude views the transcendence or givenness of "facts" when he notes that "the better a world theory, the less we are able to tell fact from theory, or pure fact from the interpretation of fact." A good world hypothesis "is not clearly distinguishable from much of the evidence it organizes, and the more highly developed it is, the less can the distinc- tion be made."28 Pepper's four basic theories are heterocosmic in that they differ from each other and yet are all of equal explanatory power: they cannot be resolved into a single ultimate theory which can claim to reflect reality through conceptual abstraction. Each remains explicitly a construct, and each is autonomous: "If two or more world hypotheses handle their facts with the same degree of adequacy..., and there is no world hypothesis of greater adequacy available, then there is no ap- peal beyond these hypotheses and each must be held as reliable as the other" (p. 98). 27See Clio, pp. 53-56; "Renaissance Imagination," pp. 46-52; and "Symbols, Metaphors, and Other Worlds: A Conspectus of Cultural Change," forthcoming in the first volume of Th 7im os. 28World Hypotheses, pp. 81-82. 28 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="29">As Pepper notes that the tacts of a world theory are not clearly dis- tinct from the theory, so Ernst Cassirer identifies the "objects" of the sciences with constructs. Such constructs "as those of mass and form, the atom or the ether, the magnetic or electrical potential... are no simple thing-concepts, no copies of particular contents given in percep- tion." They are, on the contrary, "theoretical assumptions and con- structions, which are intended to transform the merely sensible into something measurable, and thus into an 'object of physics,' that is, into an objectfor physics."29 And as hypothetical thought extrapolates from the one world of naive consciousness a universe of physics, so also it produces worlds of biology, religion, art, society, mathematics, politics, etc.: "true unity is never to be sought in things as such, but in intellec- tual constructions, which we choose according to the peculiarity of the field to be measured, and which are thus in principle possessed of an unlimited variability" (p. 361). Constructive abstraction is disjunctive by virtue of the fact that it involves the choice and selection of a partic- ular frame of reference, which means the exclusion of others. The aware- ness of disjunction and exclusion contributes to the hypothetical (non- dogmatic) character of constructive thought: it knows itself as linr ;ed in scope, and it further knows that its heterocosms are subject to veri- fication or falsification by experience. These characteristics of hypothetical culture are not limited to the intellectual sphere. It is a commonplace of sociology that modern experi- ence is characterized by heterocosmic organization at the institutional level. Following Weber, modern sociology correlates the increasing rationalization of experience-that is, the increasing dominance of tech- nology-with what is called the structural differentiation of various orders (social, economic, political, cultural) from each other. On the other hand, the concept of "embeddedness" is used to describe the relation of these orders to each other in traditional or empirical institutional or- ganization: thus in tribal cultures, economic institutions are embedded in religious institutions; in traditional civilizations, technologies are embedded by custom or ideology in transcendent structures. Sociolog- ists associate the emergence of modern culture with the period during which these orders leave their common transcendent bed and separate, and if we trace this process from the late Middle Ages we can easily correlate it with the epistemological and scientific revolutions, and with the other manifestations of the radical shift from transposition to tech- nology which marks the emergence of the modern age. 29Substance and Function, and Einstein's Theory of Relativity, trans. W.C. and M.C. Swabey ([1923] New York, 1953), p. 357. 29 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="30">It is important at least to note this change of institutional structure- the limits of space prevent further discussion-because it points to a peculiarity of hypothetical thought which the intellectualist emphasis of my previous discussion may have obscured. Its constructiveness extends to practical existence and is in fact defined by such familiar slogans as "conquest of nature," and by organized movements of reform and revo- lution. It not only abstracts from the world of naive consciousness more radically than empirical consciousness; it returns to that world more aggressively. Constructive abstraction developed, after all, in a specific historical context which entailed the critique of conceptual abstraction and the awareness that man has been more responsible for the changing shape of his environment than he had hitherto known or was willing to recognize. The hypothetical attitude involves more than a new orientation of theory; it involves a new understanding of what theory is, what prac- tice is, and how they are related; in fact, it involves a new conception of theory-and-practice as a single, dialectical, self-transforming ac- tivity. Archimedes was said to have remarked that if he had a lever long enough, a place far enough away to exert sufficient pressure, he could move the earth. The Archimedean point is sometimes used to refer to the withdrawal of man to a standpoint from which he may explore the whole world and see it in a new perspective. Both empirical and hypo- thetical thinkers withdraw in this manner. But there are two essential differences between them: (1) Empirical withdrawal may be character- ized by the term speculation, with its connection to specula (observation tower) and speculum (mirror). It is a mode of philosophical thinking whose relation to vision suggests that what it apprehends is already actualized: its object is the transcendent world or some part of it. But the hypothetical thinker exchanges the standpoint given by naive con- sciousness for another standpoint which is contrary to or at least differ- ent from the biologically and ecologically determined one in terms of which we usually view the world. When the astronauts reached the moon they did not simply externalize the Archimedean process; that ancient empir- ical dream could be actualized only by a very different hypothetical journey whose itinerary may have been charted when we first took seri- ously the difference between seeing the sun go round the earth and know- ing the earth goes round the sun. (2) In his return to the given world, the empirical theorist does not dialectically engage the practical technology around him. The social and intellectual reasons for this are familiar and need not concern us here except to note that the empirical attitude could be expected to encourage a technology whose speculative and practical 30 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="31">branches would be largely isolated from each other. Making, in the empirical attitude, tends to be tectonic rather than architectonic-based on traditional recipes, transmitted techniques, rote learning and imita- tion. It is only when (social conditions permitting) speculators become interested in machinery and get new ideas from mechanical models; and when craftsmen become interested in theory, and use or construct ma- chines for experimental purposes; only then that empirical begins to give way to hypothetical technology. For the hypothetical thinker, the first part of the Archimedean analogy-withdrawal, or (as Herbert Butterfield has put it) "putting on a different kind of thinking cap"-is only half the story. He entertains counterperceptual and heterocosmic alternatives not merely as speculative visions but also as programs for action; theoretical and practical technology develop hand in mind. The new divergence in hypothetical culture is not between theory and practice but between science and common sense. The world familiar to naive consciousness has been reduced in modern culture to a much smaller portion of total reality than ever before. The environment within which naive consciousness finds itself is largely an alien one, no longer dominated by the transcendent cosmos which it had created through transposition. Empirical technology is suffering the same ecological fate as the wild animals, and its recent revival has been taking place in a golden or Californian atmosphere of nostalgia. The divergence between science and common sense may be viewed in its sociological dimension as a split between a "high tradition" of ex- perts, technicians, and theoreticians, and a "low tradition" of laymen, naively conscious, uneasy, and anti-intellectual. And as in ancient Rome the equestrian order gradually developed "between" the patricians and plebeians, so in modern culture a "middle tradition" of organizers, managers, and others has emerged. But when this split was first socially encouraged by the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century organization of technology in science, law, art, administration, music, war, etc., it assumed a dialectical or complementary form: theory and practice, theoreticians and practitioners, for the first time in history began to cooperate in continuous and mutually transforming interaction. Meta- physics and natural philosophy moved "down" toward practice, and in consequence, empirical practice diverged from its traditional lines of organization (crafts, arts, guilds) and moved "up" toward modern technology. Subsequently, the "low tradition" divided into workers and technicians, the former replacing guilds with unions, the latter grav- itating toward professionals, managers, and intellectuals. The dialectic between theory and practice itself moved upward, to be appropriated by 31 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="32">the significant minority as the possession of a new elite. This minority may be considerably larger, in proportion to the total populace, than earlier historical elites, but it is still relatively small. The important difference is that it operates in a different mental world. Earlier his- torical elites maintained and exercised their power primarily by their ability to appeal to the traditional order, and to draw sanction from criteria, beliefs, ideals, etc., which reflect the prejudices of naive con- sciousness and its socio-political institutions. But the modern elite re- ceives its power and legitimacy from its control of the new counterper- ceptual environment, the new technology, developed by the radical abstrac- tion of postmedieval thought and culture. This new division in society reflects the fundamental dialectic of hypo- thetical thought between theory and practice. If it was social, political, and economic change that made the hypothetical attitude dominant, the thange could nevertheless not have taken place unless there were in- dividuals, like Galileo and Newton, in whom the theoretician and the practitioner were combined. And as I have suggested, the basis and out- come of this dialectic is the organization ot experience into heterocosms, separate and alternate universes and systems. For the method of empir- ical or Aristotelian abstraction, you need only one world. For the kind of abstraction employed by Galileo and Newton, you need at least two. Those hypothetical technicians who have changed the world we live in, and who continue to control it, have done so by hitching their technology to a star: by abandoning the geocentric viewpoint and withdrawing mentally to a "distance" from which the universes of man could be moved, un- hinged, as by the lever of Archimedes. In The Human Condition Hannah Arendt sees this as the touchstone of the modern. It is, she writes, as if "the worst fear and the most presumptuous hope" of man could "only come true together": "the ancient fear that our senses, our very organs for reception of reality, might betray us"; and, together with that, "the Archimedean wish for a point outside the earth from which to unhinge the world." It is as if the desire of Archimedes for a lever long enough, a pressure point far enough away, "would be granted only provided that we lost reality" as we had known it when naive consciousness was king; and as if man could only compensate for this loss by acquiring "supra- mundane powers."30 V. The Empirical and Hypothetical Attitudes: A Dialectical Perspective I have obviously been constructing this model with reference to one great cultural sequence, the one we generally call western civilization, 30The Human Condition ([1958] Garden City, 1959), pp. 237-38. 32 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="33">originating in the Near East and extending from neolithic times to the present. This is the sequence in which the pattern of transformations appears to have been most fully played through and thus it provides a paradigm against which to articulate the patterns of other cultures. The significant aspect of the western pattern, for the present discussion, is the set of historical conditions in terms of which the hypothetical atti- tude assumed cultural dominance. For, although I have been presenting it in developmental perspective, the conditions provided by the transition from medieval to modern culture display little of the sense of "natural growth" or unfolding we may associate with developmental concepts. The Renaissance manifestation of hypothetical consciousness emerged in problematic circumstances and assumed a radically antithetical stance: it defined itself by its opposition to its predecessor, at first finding its' roots in classical antiquity, but soon preferring to see itself as revis- ing, superseding, or "overgoing" classical culture. Even if this form of consciousness would prefer a stable and orderly world, that was not what it found in those centuries. In part, hypothetical culture was gener- ated through force of circumstances by the gradual breakdown of the empirical world view. Renaissance consciousness developed in a con- tentious and competitive atmosphere by manifestly asserting its counter- perceptual, countertraditional, and countermedieval character. A structural account cannot remain satisfied with a description in terms of external historical factors. It asks whether there is something inherent in the structure of the hypothetical attitude which produces this aggres- sive character. And if we are to explore this question, we have to depart from the developmental perspective and turn from the ontogenetic model to the basic model of naive consciousness to seek there an alternate pattern of description. In postulating a Freudian myth to "explain" the preferences of naive consciousness, I emphasized the defense against anxiety as a primary factor revealed in the structures of both naive consciousness and primitive culture. The source of anxiety was attributed not merely to brute environmental challenges but also to vague, internal, psychic threats. This may well belong to our animal inheritance. In The Phenomenon of Life, Jonas describes the "precarious and exposed mode of living" characteristic of animal life, and affecting animal conscious- ness: a mode which commits the animal to wakefulness and effort, whereas plant life can be dormant. Responding to the lure of the prey, of which perception has given notice, alertness turns into the strain of pursuit and into the gratification of fulfillment; but also knows... hun- ger,... fear,... flight... The suffering intrinsic to animal existence is thus pri- marily not that of pain...but that of want and fear... In its greater exposure and the pitch of awareness that goes with it, its own possible annihilation becomes an 33 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="34">object of dread just as its possible satisfactions become objects of desire (pp. 105, 107). The human development of powers of memory and anticipation that ac- company the enlarging of the brain may well allow some rude generali- zation of experiences of hunger, fear, and flight, of danger and malice, of perceived or possible death. What Freud called life and death instincts are better seen as life and death concepts or images, images first inter- nalized in the dimmer affective awareness ot animal sensibility. Yet man's naive consciousness seems to have attained to its present structure by adaptive modifications which respond to the anxieties and pressures of animal consciousness in a manner that markedly differs from the adaptations of animals. "Where man differs from animals-so far as we yet know-is that throughout as much of his evolution as is known to us he has not normally remained supine but has striven to take a positive attitude and assume a definite line of conduct" toward the more incomprehensible processes of life and death which affect his survival. "What he says and does rests on the assumption that the secret workings of nature are capable of being influenced by his actions, and commonly on the further assumption that those secret workings are due to forces which operate in virtue of wills and emotions comparable with those which prompt his own operations."31 I quoted this passage in my Clio essay while discussing the functions of transposition and technology and in a context which the above account of naive consciousness as a response to anxiety virtually ignored: the context of homo creator. Anx- iety is insufficient as a motivational hypothesis; creativity must be added. If there were only anxiety, it would be difficult to explain how human culture ever left its overordered primitive Eden to embark on its histor- ical journey. As soon as we add creativity, however, we introduce a complication into our account of the source of anxiety. This becomes clear if we consider modern views of perception as a transposer-a selective, crea- tive, probing activity which not only helps determine the kinds of infor- mation it receives from the environment but also uses this information to suggest and test hypotheses about the environment. Naive conscious- ness may be imagined to have suppressed awareness of this active and creative character because of the difficulty and uncertainty of a life in which survival depended less on "instinct" and more on conscious proc- esses of attention, interpretation, problem-solving, and decision-making. This, then, is a second source of anxiety, quite different from that postu- lated in the Freudian myth. 31A.D. Nock, Conversion ([1933] Oxford, 1961), p. 1. 34 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="35">Some combination of both sources finds its way into the existentialist notion that man's fundamental anxiety is occasioned perhaps more by himself than by the world, and that this anxiety is the dread of human freedom, the dread of the discovery that man's fate is in his own hands the dread of the freedom which resides in the unique human power of creativity. Consciousness of such freedom would impose an intolerable and paralyzing burden on a creature technologically incapable of using that freedom and directing those creative processes. Thus naive con- sciousness gravitates toward transposition as its chief creative process, and toward a culture which would in effect guarantee flight from freedom, exchanging it for the minimal security required to allow man to develop his technology. Freedom in that sense is "sacrificed" by the individual to the culture, which will preserve it in a safe place until individuals become culturally enabled to accept it. In its more critical moods, existentialism fails to appreciate the survival value of cultural innocence and the importance of a quasi-deterministic overorder, but it has helped us appreciate the radical and irrepressible creativity of man which history has dragged out into the open over the objections of naive con- sciousness. Following a respectable primitive model, I shall order the Freudian and existentialist notions into a set of binary opposites in the following arbitrary manner: Man has two primal needs. First is a need for order, peace, and security, for protection against the terror or confusion of life, for a familiar and predictable world, and for a life which is happily more of the same. Thus the structures of naive consciousness and primi- tive culture answer to this Freudian need. But the second primal im- pulse is contrary to the first: man positively needs anxiety and uncer- tainty, thrives on confusion and risk, wants trouble, tension, jeopardy, novelty, mystery, would be lost without enemies, is sometimes happiest when most miserable. Human spontaneity is eaten away by sameness; man is the animal most expert at being bored. Restless and playful, he perpetually uproots himself from the soil in which he has been planted, reaches always beyond himself toward some dim and never fully actual- ized differentness, some mystery or transcendence which must be sus- tained as well as approached. To borrow an image from the painter Albert Ryder: "Have you ever seen an inch worm crawl up a leaf or twig, and then clinging to the very end, revolve in the air, feeling for something to reach something? That's like me. I am trying to find some- thing out there beyond the place on which I have a footing." Plato has Meno ask Socrates, "How on earth are you going to set up something you don't know as the object ol your search?" and the implicit Platonic 35 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="36">response is that the problem is precisely "to set up something you can't completely know," a transcendence which sustains as a perpetual possibility man's primal need for uncertainty, risk, mystery, and crea- tive search. Plato's term for this need is eros and his critique of the polis is founded on the awareness that in its proper concern for order, peace, and security, it fails to discriminate between the impulses: its institutions fear and frustrate the existentialist eros as well as allaying the Freudian need.32 These two mythic impulses, which I shall distinguish as need and eros, are contrary in their modes of assertion: need is essentially passive, eros active; need is a condition, eros a process; need shrinks from the future, eros reaches toward it. Need is rooted in biological existence and its rhythms are periodic and recurrent. Without eros it would know only two primitive reflexes, approach and avoidance, and it would be locked into the ebbs and flows of apprehension-the desire to take, the fear of be- ing taken. Whatever forms the threat to existence takes-whether the "demands of the id" for peace or gratification at any cost, or the compul- sions of organic life, or any sense of being assaulted, coerced, con- strained, and denied-they produce signals of pain which indicate impend- ing emptiness, shrinkage of being, life losing ground to death. These signals of disturbed equilibrium work like negative feedback mechanisms: they prompt irritable responses to restore the past state and extend it into the future. The responses may be positive in the sense of being cooperative: need evokes not only the activities that protect, feed, or perpetuate the organism and its kind, but also the variety of attentive acts implied in the terms care and consideration and associated with philia or "family feeling." Grooming, education, and sex are responses to need no less than the more negative responses by which the organism strives to ease its crav- ing or diminish its anxiety and emptiness: the acts by which the otherness of a threatening or alluring object is destroyed, that is, aggression or the assimilation which replenishes the self. The objects of needy conscious- ness have no otherness in the sense of meaning in and for themselves which is recognized as valuable, as something to be preserved and en- hanced in its distance and differentness from the self. In the context of need, even the generating and educating of a new creature are acts in- tended to produce an extension of self. The latent function of cooperative acts-care and consideration-is to tighten the solidary bonds that preserve the group. Need-dominated behavior is thus conservative in the basic 32This conception of eros has nothing in common with either Freud's myth of the life instincts or Marcuse's transformed and utopian libido. 36 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="37">sense of that term. It tends to restore an earlier condition, revive an earlier satisfaction, or produce more of the same. Its decisions about the future are copies of decisions made in the past. Its response to anx- iety may be summarized in the formula, "paring and repairing." The term that best describes eros, on the other hand, is revising, and the etymological suggestions are important: seeing again, seeing better, seeing more-though not more of the same but seeing differently, seeing anew. Seeing implies that properly speaking eros is a consciously di- rected mode of response. But historically the first and most radical appearance of revision was in the activity of transposition by which man created a transcendent world for himself. Perhaps we can speak of trans- position as proto-erotic, and in this covert form the activity of eros is ancillary to need. Eros comes to consciousness as dissatisfaction with the world it had unknowingly structured in fulfilling the demands of need. It responds in ennui, in annoy, to the suffocating fullness, the stultifying overorder, the seeming permanence of what already is. Where need speaks in answers, eros speaks in questions. Its questions challenge the answers it had provided for need, or dig beneath them to lay open and resurrect earlier questions buried under those answers. It seeks what Robert Frost has called "the wonder of unexpected supply," and Wordsworth "some- thing evermore about to be," something perpetually beyond-evermore, or never now. Where need involves an urge to incorporate something miss- ing into the self, eros involves an urge to create an emptiness, a sense of something missing, and project it toward the future. Eros aspires to sustain the otherness of its objects and keep them from collapsing into the self. Unlike nature, eros demands a vacuum, a permanent tohu bohu without which no new creation or revision would be possible. We may assume that there are as many configurations of these two impulses as there are individuals. But if, for the sake of analysis, we were to separate the impulses in order to articulate the dispositions and preferences characteristic of each in its pure form, we could construct two puppets, a man of need and a man of eros. The man of need will ob- viously gravitate toward the consolations of naive consciousness and its preferred form of culture. We would expect him to be pious, conserva- tive, and anti-intellectual. Clearly he will prefer a stable, typical, and orderly world, and will try to keep it the way he finds it. He learns and teaches that this world was created or is sutained by some transcendent power(s) more durable and authoritative to man yet in some ways simi- lar to and aware of man. Thus he believes he can influence the power(s), which he finds at work in society as well as in nature. He learns and teaches that the world has had this order for as long as it has existed; 37 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="38">that it offers its inhabitants favored directions-a center, perhaps an out- side, an above, a below, a past (in illo tempore). He further learns and teaches that, as perception informs us, there is only one such world. It may have different regions and be articulated into different zones, but there will be related to each other in terms of geography as well as value. The usually invisible presences inhabiting that world are all to be found, along with visible things, within its various zones. If the spiritual is invisible (or the invisible is spiritual) it must be in the same way that air is invisible. And like air, the spiritual/invisible exists within the one world available to preception-may be felt or heard, may enter dreams-and its energies may flow like air currents through the world. The man of eros, on the other hand, is a man against naive conscious- ness. In certain ways he is less independent than the man of need: he needs his predecessor as he needs naive consciousness-not only, how- ever, because he needs his five senses but also because he defines him- self by his opposition to his contrary. He does not teach that there is only one world, that society is natural or divine, that the world always was and will be the way it is. He does not take it for granted that society is more real or valuable than the individual, does not prefer collective over singular norms of behavior, activity, and authority. He challenges every source of givenness and transcendence which he has been told to accept: memory, the past, tradition, time-honored customs and institu- tion, the wisdom of the elders. He decides which to accept and which to throw away; which to exalt and follow as paradigms, and which to consign to flames. For the man of eros, the real is what he decides it is after deliberation; it issues forth as the product and fulfillment of his questing conscious- ness. And this quest is not something to be undertaken in some ritual or otherwise collectively organized and shared experience; he prefers to work by himself, in a corner. There he can replace the one world given by perception with others which he imagines and constructs; and he may find these possible worlds more satisfying, comprehensible, and orderly than the given world. But it isn't enough for him to invent other worlds and stay in his corner. He is more contentious, restless, and ambitious. He notes with distaste his opponent's desire to keep the world the way he found it and decides thereupon that it should be changed. His ultimate aspiration is to make his view of the world the world. Within the grandiose hope he harbors a more modest scheme, based on his disagreement with the man of need over the origins of society and the state: he postulates that in the past men had created their social systems without knowing it (that is, by transposition) and had legitimized their man-made political 38 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="39">systems by embedding them in the transcendent order; men should wake up to their power, shift from nonconscious to conscious creation, and take the shaping and changing of socio-political order into their own hands. Men should thus withdraw into themselves and their corners, muse out their plans and visions and then, returning to the world, act to make them come true. These two caricatures are familiar, and it must be apparent that the man of need symbolizes empirical consciousness while the man of eros symbolizes hypothetical consciousness. Need and eros are affective equivalents to those cognitive attitudes. And yet, however apparent it seems, this can hardly be true. It is at best, stated this way, trivial. It can't be true because the cognitive structures are developmentally re- lated while the structures of need and eros are dialectically related. And it remains trivial until we sort out the referents of need and eros-that is, the species, individuals, forms of cultural consciousness. Naive con- sciousness reveals its responsiveness to need in the style of perception- passive, automatic, accurate-and in the qualities of transposed struc- tures-overordered, determining, transcendent. Creative eros is present in the primordial mode of transposition; in this mode-the psychic un- conscious and cultural nonconscious-it is the servant of need. As the condition of anxiety produced by organic ananke and its varied threats to existence, need arouses a dormant eros and puts it to work under the banner or yoke of necessity. This corvee arrangement is basically tense and unstable, leading first to the tyrannic assertion of need's authority and ultimately to its loss. For in stimulating the proto-erotic activity of transposition, need makes it possible for consciousness to discover its creative power: this can only happen if it finds its products outside itself-in the world toward which naive consciousness gravitates-and intuits some reflection of that power in the products. The latter appear first as transcendent models to be imitated, as forms and powers that legitimize further technology, and as sources of authority, for example, welded to political institutions, and wielded by political technicians-kings and priests-so as to intensify the output of corvee labor. But as the mark of human thought and power grows clearer-even if only expressed in such hubristic perversions of eros as lust, repression, and force-man's confidence in technology in- creases. And as creative eros finds expression in conscious forms and generates new technical structures, the old transpositions become prob- lematic, open to doubts or criticism, perhaps obsolescent. If their valid- ity is to be sustained and renewed, they must be defended-possibly re- vised-by means which are usually technical: ideology and speculative 39 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="40">thought. These means remain in the service of need: they justify and are justified by transcendent sources of authority; they help preserve the transpositional (and usually the political) status quo. But eros is now less the slave of the divine king than a member of his city-state. It is beginning its long journey toward the time of partnership when, surrounded by the heavens and pantheon and polities it has made, eros discovers and flaunts its power, and claims for technology a share in God's work. It is thus by the foresight of a nonconscious providence that early man in his need transposes his creations to the transcendent field where alone they may be "discovered," and from whence they may be repossessed, refined, and transformed. Auden's whimsical question, "How can I know what I think till I see what I say," may with slight alteration serve as a formula for this dialectical process in which first need and then eros is dominant: how can man know what he thinks and creates till he sees what he has made? We may now correlate the affective structures of need and eros with the two basic forms of cultural consciousness by postulating that (a) since need and eros exist together in each individual, and (b) since need and eros are dialectically interactive in cultural as well as individual consciousness, and (c) since by virtue of their relation to naive con- sciousness need is initially the dominant condition and the empirical attitude the dominant form, then (d) the development of culture from its empirical to its hypothetical mode is congruent with the changing course produced by the dialectic postulated in (b): need dominating and challenged by eros is the affective structure of the empirical attitude, and when the challenge succeeds this leads to the affective structure of the hypothetical attitude, eros dominating and challenged by need. For the sake of convenience, let our two puppets, the man of need and the man of eros, be called Consciousness 1 (Cs 1) and Consciousness 2 (Cs 2); and let any lingering echoes of Charles Reich be dissolved like morning mist. In the empirical attitude, Cs 1 is the prevailing cultural mode; Cs 2 may be called its counterculture. The structure of the empir- ical attitude may be expressed as Cs 1 --&gt; (Cs 2): &gt; = "is great- er than," or "includes," while - = "interacts in tensional op- position with." The structure of the hypothetical attitude may be ex- pressed as Cs 2----&gt; Cs 1. In the first formula, Cs 2 is in parentheses to indicate that it has not yet emerged as the dominating mode. Cs 2 be- came the dominating mode by reacting against the already actualized structure dominated by Cs 1, which persists as a counterculture and re- tains its influence (supported by naive consciousness) in the hypothetical attitude. The difference between the formulas expresses the irreversible or developmental character of culture change. 40 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="41">These formulas are deficient in that they fail to express the calculus of transformations which, as a function of the interplay between Cs 1 and Cs 2, gives each of the two attitudes a definite and irreversible tem- poral profile. Empirical and hypothetical cultures are not static, mono- lithic forms. The career of the first is shaped by its gravitation toward Cs 2 and its attempts-increasingly technological and thus self-defeating- to resist that tendency and maintain Cs 1 in power. The career of the second is shaped by the gravitational force exerted by Cs 1 and leading to continuously changing modulations of the two affective structures. This can hardly be demonstrated without exploring the historical manifesta- tions of these changes in considerable detail. For the present, I can do no more than conclude with an impressionistic description of each of the two careers. And first 1 would like to restate the two paradoxes with which I concluded the Clio essay: (1) the paradox of transcendence: the creature becomes the creator of the creation in which he is a crea- ture; but he retains this power only on condition that he continue to think of himself as creature, not creator; (2) the paradox of technology: the creator becomes the creature of his creation; and this happens because he continues to think of himself as creator, not creature, as master and not servant of his creation, and because he aspires to give it the kind of independence and self-regulating character that will enable it to transcend the limits of his own fallible nature.33 The first paradox epitomizes the dynamics of the empirical attitude, the second that of the hypothetical attitude. (1) The empirical attitude may be conceived as sustaining its original value structure, derived from naive consciousness, through a sequence of historical periods in the same way as a soaring hawk sustains its ap- parently calm, effortless stability and equilibrium: by continual fibrillating readjustments, micro-changes, tiny compensatory motions that enable it to ride the shifting currents of environment-sometimes opposing, sometimes assisting the flows and ebbs and eddies of environmental en- ergy. But this analogy will not explain those shifting currents that de- rive from the dialectic of Cs 1 and Cs 2 within the structure of period consciousness itself; currents produced when an emergent technology, manifesting and stimulating the exercise of man's conscious creative powers, increases the probability of more radical efforts to master or transform the world. For example, in ancient conquest empires the political elites appropri- ated the god-power of the transcendent order and expropriated the man- power of the masses (in ancient bureaucratic empires, the same pat- 33Cf. Clio, pp. 61-62; this is a slightly modified formulation of the second paradox. 41 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="42">tern took a more benign and effective form). What the rulers desired was essentially a heterocosmic situation-one world for the rulers and another for the ruled-and their reliance on political techniques approxi- mated tendencies which I have associated with Cs 2. But if they would continue as rulers, and not reduce themselves to the helpless position of mere exterminators, they had to appeal with special force to the values espoused by Cs 1, for only the ideology provided by that model could justify their power and prolong their repression of the masses: it is more acceptable to rule in the god's name than in one's own. Another example: the first series challenge to archaic transpositions was posed by classical technology, chietly in politics, social and economic organi- zation, natural philosophy, critico-speculative thought, and engineering. But this challenge led ultimately to the failure of Rome, the failure of the City of Man, and produced and sophisticated reaction of Christian culture. Christianity did not simply revive a more primitive culture; it strove to re-institute a primitive configuration of relationships between transposition and transcendence, transcendence and technology. The programmatic aspect of this enterprise- "striving to re-institute" was historically a new manifestation of eros; this aspect became con- spicuous during the high and late Middle Ages and took on the pale cast of human thought in scholastic and political technology. The difference between these two examples suggests the difference be- tween two phases of empirical culture in western history. In the earlier phase, efforts to challenge the value structure of Cs 1 are overcome, or must be kept latent through displacement. Such efforts may arouse strong conservative counter-measures or a variety of accommodations which may be transpositional or ideological. The resultant changes will de- rive in part from the subversive activities of the erotic counterculture, and the reaction of Cs 1 may successfully restore or maintain the origi- nal structure but it will do so only by driving the actual configuration of culture into a new historical phase. Both examples make clear the role of the counterculture in sustaining the paradox of transcendence: though it is partly through the efforts of Cs2 that the creature becomes the creator of the creation in which he is a creature, it is essential that he continue to see or to present himself as creature, not creator. The dominance of transposition, and of Cs 1, is thus paradoxically what en- ables the underground activity of Cs 2. (2) The second example reveals the ultimate failure of empirical cul- ture to honor the terms of this paradox. This made it possible for post- medieval men to proclaim, positively or critically, that man, by taking thought, was able to change himself, his history, and his world. Taking 42 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="43">thought, placing the erotic mark of technology on the world, led to the revolutions associated with Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Kant, America, France, Industry, and Marx. The scientific, epistemological, and po- litical revolutions challenged the primacy and passivity of perception, the transcendent provenance of its data, and the metaphysical priority of space over time (that is, the superior symbolic efficacy of spatial categories as signifiers of transcendent "form"). They initiated a sustained critique which threatened the validity of transcendence as a significant genetic category providing the basic criterion of reality, and this critique succeeded because so much of what had traditionally been considered transcendent had gradually been revealed over the centuries as the effect of transposition. This critique was accompanied by the dual emergence of modern technology with the first clearly counterperceptual culture in history. At the same time, the career of hypothetical culture takes a peculiar direction: noting the nonconscious and thus automatic character of transposition, the modern critique of empirical culture left that character standing as a new criterion of reality validating such strange bedfellows as the unconscious and the systematic, the psychic and the cybernetic, the realm of the transpersonal and the realm of the impersonal, E.S.P. and servomechanical sense organs. It is here that we see the predicament and instability of Cs 2, the in- fluence of Cs 1, and the dynamics of the paradox of technology. Hypo- thetical culture would like to convert its technical achievements into realities that have the same status as that previously possessed by transcendent forces; it would like to create structures or systems which not only change the world but may be depended on-through self-regulation -to continue changing it for the better. And in this impulse, at the heart of the most aggressive and power-seeking urges of Cs 2, lies the enemy agent working for Cs 1. In his drive to convert technology to a source of transcendence-to a transcendent force itself-the man of eros restores to his reality the independence and power it had for the man of need. If technology replaces transposition, it continues the work of transposition. Thus the Frankenstein paradox of technology presides over the dialectical career of a culture dominated by Cs 2. Hypothetical culture as the product of the gradual undermining of the empirical dominance of naive consciousness: it is in this oversimplified- but comprehensive and economical-perspective that we may integrate the myriad utterances in our century of the sort of commonplace I am stating here. The discovery of man's radical creative power is the discovery of transposition (whether by this or any other name), and the significance of this discovery-going on over the last four centuries-is 43 Naive Consciousness</page><page sequence="44">suggested in the slightly pejorative and also, perhaps, slightly nostalgic connotations of the term naive consciousness. Such terms as rationalism and intellectualism may be assimilated to the broader category of "dis- trust of transposition and reliance on technology." Our ambivalence toward the historical fate of naive consciousness as a cultural form sometimes divides into the polar opposites of romantic- ism and technocracy, but it is better represented by more integrated attitudes such as Max Weber's ambivalence toward what he calls "the disenchantment of the world." Weber asks whether the processes of rationalization and structural differentiation "which we have been under- going for thousands of years" means that we today "have a greater knowl- edge of the conditions of life under which we exist" than did early man. Answering in the negative, he notes that the savage "knows incomparably more about his tools" than we know about our instrumental systems. Therefore this "intellectualist rationalization, created by science and scientific technology," means something else: It means... the knowledge or belief that if one but wished one could learn it at any time. Hence, it means that principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted. One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to master or implore the spirits, as did the savage, for whom such mysterious powers existed. Technical means and calculations perform the service. This above all is what intellectualization means.34 Amplifying a similar theme, Jacques Ellu modifies Weber's insight by the notion that transcendence has not disappeared but has been displaced --in my terms-transposition to technology: Nothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or to the supernatural. The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very well that there is nothing spiritual anywhere. But man cannot live without the sacred. He therefore trans- fers his sense of the sacred to the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to technique itself. In the world in which we live, technique has become the essential mystery... Those who have preserved some of the notions of magic both admire and fear technique.35 Cowell College University of California at Santa Cruz 34H.H. Gerth and C.
