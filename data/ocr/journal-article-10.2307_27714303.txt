<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE THE EARLIER SEVENTEENTH CENTURY: REVISED VERSION Arthur E. Barker, University of Illinois Since the fifth volume of The Oxford History of English Literature has had for scholars and students something approaching the authority of Scripture, a revision is an event of major importance.1 It proves of even greater importance and interest than announcements have indicated, and it must be said, at once and bluntly, to render obsolete the edition of 1945 and its several reprintings. References to the first edition must be regarded by editors and instructors as quite unacceptable, and students should be warned against buying at a low price the second-hand copies which will shortly flood the market. Even assiduous marginal annotation will not serve, for pagination is changed by revisions and additions increasing the text by more than twenty pages, apart from some thirty-five pages of additional bibliography (including many items published in 1962 or forthcoming). Save for one major author, these revisions and additions nowhere make for any radical change in the history's argument or appraisals. They underline, while somewhat subtly deepening, the orig inal's characterization of what was, historically, the period's main movement of mind, and, often with somewhat less unsympathetic distaste, of those cur rents of free (and not always particularly fresh) ideas that were apparently to prevail as it moved into the future. Characteristically, a brief apologetic insertion turns out to be a vigorous reassertion of the centrality of "Christian humanism" (^6; 35: throughout the first reference is to 1962, the second to 1945). Yet, even when they involve minute rephrasings (as at one point in the reversal of a conditional clause) rather than considerable additions or re writings, the revisions often significantly readjust the original's angle in the light of the historian's staggering command of developing scholarship and interpretation and in terms of the general improvement of opinion and taste since Hiroshima. In very large measure, of course, such adjustments have been made necessary by the history's own pervasive influence, through the fusion of exact and comprehensive scholarship with sensitive and vigorous appraisal which gave the original its quite exceptional authority. The revised version's reflection of this influence and of recent developments is not easy to catch in a couple of sentences; but this may be hazarded. It was evidently possible to derive from the original edition the impression that the literature of the earlier seventeenth century in England was chiefly marked by the dis integration of the "bulwark" of right-rational Christian humanism and its sevenfold ethic under the destructive impact of naturalism, libertinism, scepticism, scientism. Since 1945 many studies (and not least of Milton) have had their point of departure (and of essential and often explicit disagreement 1 English Literature in the Earlier Seventeenth Century.

Pp. viii-r-680. $10.50. 617</page><page sequence="2">6i8 Barker with the appraisals of the history itself) in such a reading, supported of course by earlier hypotheses as to cross currents, or by insistence on some weakness or other in the "Christian-humanist synthesis" issuing in varieties of counter-renaissances (or counter-reformations), or by preoccupation with some manifestly doomful destiny usually connected with "science" and more or less reflecting the tragicomic turn of those two Victorian characters, Huxley and Wilberforce. The revised history will induce the sense of a much higher degree of literary unity in its period, by its indications, in detailed re visions rather than in general terms, that Christian humanism is inadequately characterized as a rigid and largely academic bulwark, that it was capable (in men of genius and courage) of a vital and developing response to the complexities of the existential and historical situation, that its vitality de pended on its manipulations of the disciplined energies it inherited from classical, Hebraic, Christian, Patristic, and late-medieval traditions, and, further, by its indications, again in detail, that eighteenth- and nineteenth century varieties of naturalism, libertinism, scepticism, scientism were less characteristic of the seventeenth-century English literary scene than we had been led to suppose?whatever may have been true of the continent or of the English social and political scene. For reasons which are in general obvious enough, though their origins are deep in our postwar psyche?as contrasted with the postwar psyche of the twenties?critical interpretation since 1945 has largely been concerned with formulating in various ways the period's principles of literary unity and continuity despite historical appearances. It is to this effort that the revision chiefly responds, by bringing out more clearly the influential implications to that effect in the original and by consistently toning down the implications of fragmented despair, largely induced, ironi cally, by the now outdated inadequacies of the critical appraisals of the twenties and thirties. If this does not make the period seem rather more than half medieval, it makes it seem a good deal less than half modern?in the sense in which Professor Bush uses the word, a sense with which it is per missible to disagree. The revisions thus merit the closest scrutiny, as authorita tively symptomatic of our movement of mind since 1945. There are few such volumes whose revision one would wish to subject, or dare to subject, or run the risk of subjecting, to such close scrutiny. But this revision has been car ried through with a sensitive meticulousness at every point that deserves the closest and most respectful evaluation. It will be found that such evaluation illustrates the significant vitality of recent scholarship of all sorts, while bring ing into relief?as a history should?some critical, interpretative, and histor ical problems that demand further attention. And no student of the period needs to be told that the work of this authority can sustain (and make abun dantly profitable) the most minute and rigorous examination. As to the bibliographies, the comprehensiveness of the substantial addi tions requires no comment: vide, passim. The addition of a subsection on "The History of Ideas" will seem a heartening gesture to such as do stand; but it proves to be a brief, mainly "world-picture" list, including items col lected, where they belong, under other, original ideological headings. As to matters of biographical and literary fact, transpositions of uncertain items and minor additions occur throughout the chronological tables (as with the appearance of Middleton's Ghost of Lucr?ce in 1600 and the dropping of</page><page sequence="3">Review Article 619 Hamlet and Twelfth Night down to 1601?) and here and there in the text (as with the change of date for Charleton's Ephesian Matron, 54; 54; or the removal of the observation that Basse may have written "On the Tombs," 83 ; 83 ; or the note on the difference of opinion about this added to the bibli ography, 531; 494; or, there also, the identification and analysis of Beau mont's Thomes, 532; 495). Many minute changes occur in the biographical notes concerning Chapman (60; 60), William Browne (80; 80), Daniel (91-92; 92-93), Campion (101; 98), Jonson (108; 104-105), Herrick (115, ni-12), Suckling (121; 117-18), George Herbert (141-42; 136), Vaughan (151; 143-44), Traherne (156; 147), Edward Herbert (160; 151-52), Marvell (167; 158-59), Cornwallis (198; 187), Hall (209-10; 198-99), Hayward (225; an addition), Lilburne (264; 250), Thomas Browne (286; 272), Andrewes (316; 300), Taylor (329; 311), Hales (341; 324), Davenant (372; 354), and especially, of course, Donne (132-33; 129-30). "The Background" is unchanged save for a slight emphasis on the polarities of Puritanism (7; 7), some softening of capitalist rigor in the light of recent findings as to charitable bequests (11, 12, 14; 11, 12, 14), a reasser tion of the importance of humanistic classicism (against drab dissenters?), chiefly as to tutorial influence in the universities (15-17; 15-16), and some addition concerning leveling educational opinion with, at the same time, some softening concerning Baconianism (20-21; 20). A few slight changes are made on the subject of printing (though nothing is added about the impor tance of manuscript circulation), and an addition notes the popularity of various types of fiction (56; 56). A number of additions throughout underline the period's range of response to experience and deepen the original sense of spiritual battle along the Waltonian path to heaven through this world, of the "process" and the "ironies" of the existential situation: Spenser becomes "Pla tonic" instead of "half-mystical" (91; 90); Montrose is probably merely amatory, not patriotic (127; 123); Chapman's representation of experiential process is stressed as to the Odyssey and his Tears of Peace (61, 97; 61, 129); Greville is less Platonic and more political and Calvinistic (98-100; 94-96); and Jonson's ironic awareness of human limitations (no; 107), Herrick's ten sions (118-19; 115-16), penitential progress in Crashaw (148; 141), and especially the stages of Pauline and Augustinian regeneration in Vaughan (154-55; 146-47) all get new emphasis. "Travel" required no changes, and "essays and characters" none of any significance, save for an underlining of Hall's Christian-Stoicism (210; 199); but "history and biography" did. These include the shifting of the matter of Arthur and Britain to allow for a new emphasis on the Saxon view of history and antiquarianism (223-24, 228; 210, 214-15), with additions tending to vary the simple humanistic "exemplary" view and to illustrate the mixed inheritance from Tudor historians (220, 221; 209, 210)?though of course the "marriage of classical and Christian" remains the basic theme. Notable also are the substantial addition of Hayward and Daniel (225-27; 212), and con siderable rewriting of the paragraphs on Raleigh tending to make him more typical of the period and to shift the emphasis from the classical to the mem orably "religious and poetical" or providential (224-25; 210-12). And Walton is subjected to a number of (chiefly Donnean) modifications (236-38; 222-25). Apart from an underlining of Hobbes' distrust of reason (256; 242),</page><page sequence="4">620 Barker "political thought" needed little change?and is still the most lucidly com prehensive review of midcentury opinion available. Though Bacon's "strongly figurative" strain alone requires additional note (281; 267), "science" exhibits an accumulation of significant revisions, beyond some elaboration of the search for a universal language (285; 271). These yet further reduce the notion of psychic "dislocation" induced by the "new philosophy" and culminate in an addition keyed by Collingwood's devastating remark?"philosophically foolish and historically false" (291; 277; and see 293, 294; 279). These underscorings of what was already in the original have chiefly to do with Drummond and, of course, Donne; and they require no significant change as to Burton (though some students might per haps have profited from some underscoring of his Anglicanism). This deter mined underlining may perhaps be associated with a pervasive (though not entirely new) sense of nature as "the art of God," in Herrick (118-19; 114-15), in Vaughan (153; 146), in Marvell (170; 161), in the conclusion (423; 401), and?though, curiously, not in Milton?particularly in Thomas Browne. Though the removal of a long comment on Browne's interest in "little things" may be regretted (352; 335), there is a new emphasis on his response to this (not exclusively) "Hermetic" notion of divine artistry (351; 334); and, while detailed revision concerning his style tends further to offset the quaint (356-58; 339-40), Cyrus gets much more sympathetic and extensive treat ment (354; 337), in the light of recent interpretation but consistently with what was already said of Urne and Letter. The efforts of the Cambridge Pla tonists to sustain right reason needed no modification, nor does the brief account of heroic poetry, though there is some reductive or revisionary point ing up as to both Gondibert and Davideis (371, 375-76; 355-66, 357). It is with other poets that the most significant revisions occur. Since "baroque" has "even less significant and settled meaning" than "metaphys ical" (132; 127)?and has elsewhere been publicly rejected?it is interesting to find that Giles Fletcher remains so, though his paradoxes are also those of traditional Christianity, and the suggestion that Phineas is of the company is at least entertained (86-87; 86-87). On account of his Catholic and Platonic Thornes, John Beaumont gets shifted into the religious context (89; 97). Revision underlines the humanistic mean of Daniel's ethical ideals (again against the drab), while adding a reference to Montaigne, whose own reputa tion is changing (93-95; 91-94). More significant is the shifting of Chapman from association with Donne?on whom the shift has an important bearing? to a position between Daniel and Greville, where revised comments on "the texture of his verse as well as his humanistic creed" illustrate the rhythms of the main movement, despite a counterbalancing added reference to Ficino's Hermetic Poimander and contrast with Greville as to "mythological and other symbols" (95-98; 127-29). No significant changes were needed, despite substantial recent studies, in the accounts of poetry and music or Jonson, though Trimpi's important study, promised in the bibliography, might have induced a stylistic revision or two. Considerable revisions for Herrick at once add an echo from Catullus and (though without finding Noble Numbers as no table as others recently have) underline the piety of the "serious" poet whose tensions issue in a unified vision through the "artifice of eternity" reflected (with however pagan an atmosphere) in the book of the creatures (115-19;</page><page sequence="5">Review Article 621 111-16). Revisions also point up Carew's "double allegiance" and his single metaphor technique (119; 116); and even the gentlemanly unevenness of Lovelace newly testifies to some tension (122-23; n 8-19), while Collop?who was of course already there?gets brief new medical attention in line with the recent edition (129; 125). More significant is the somewhat heavily under lined insistence on neat subtlety of artistry and "security of belief" in Herbert as contrasted with Donne, with a disinclination to follow recent suggestions that, as compared with Donne's "Spouse"?whose changed bearing is noted (136; 133)?Herbert's "dear Mother" has some aura of sanctimonious Episco palian superiority (to use a mild word). Yet here too the addition of Sidnean and Ovidian echoes is accompanied by new comments on meditative (and perhaps exaggerated) highlightings of the tensions between sin and love, handled through symbolic and liturgical suggestions of temples, of body and soul, individual and church (142-45; 136-39). The meditative?duly but judiciously acknowledged?and the erotic and now even the "playful" as well as the penitentially progressive get new emphasis in Crashaw, who remains our one conspicuously baroque poet (147-50; 139-43). But a dele tion here may prove regrettable: though the conceit in Crashaw is now said to be not only unDonnean but "in line with the ordinary Elizabethan" type (147; 140), the poetry of Donne and Herbert is no longer said to have "re mained largely English in character," though some of us may feel less certain than we were led to feel a few years ago that they were imitating continentals. In Vaughan sudden conversion is toned down into "a gradual process of deepening seriousness and illumination"?a perception perhaps not inappli cable to many sensitive minds who withstood the pressures of this desperately controversial period (perhaps even in large measure to Donne's) ; and a num ber of rephrasings also tone down "mysticism" into an Augustinian conscious ness of the creature's significance. A new stress on biblical symbol and allusion and the emblematic, as expressions of stages in the purifying regenerative process, is marked by the addition of a long comment on Vaughan's aforetime insufficiently appreciated "Waterfall" (151-55; 143-47). Marvell's variety is somewhat similarly elaborated, along with his "balanced, impersonal com plexity of mind" and his sense of the demands of different genres; and there is of course a considerable addition on the "much-analyzed" Ode and its wit (with further reference to May's Lucan), others on the "paradoxes and ironies" of soul and body, the world's corruption in the emblematic "Dew," and (though Marvell echoes Donne less and Spenser more than we had sup posed) the "perfect blending of classical artist and metaphysical wit" in the Garden and Mower poems, with some reduction as to the "sincere and rational Christian" and the rejection of religious allegory in the "Nymph," yet with new allusions to the divine artistry (167-72; 159-64). Fairfax gets only a little more of his ironic due; and the "Mistress" metaphysically stands?and waits. These revisions represent the slight if significant shiftings and the steady deepening of our response to the poets, as when Edward Herbert, somewhat curiously, loses something of his Platonism (161; 153), Cleveland and Cowley remain unchanged (though the latter's new world of order is noted in the bibliography), and the "age-old attitudes" and classical ideals, stylistic, civil, religious, of Cooper's Hill are newly stressed (178; 168-69). But of course the keenest interest will be aroused, from one point of view or another,</page><page sequence="6">622 Barker by the revisions concerning Donne, not only in the sections devoted to the two flamens but scattered throughout. His biographical note (132-33; 129-30) is subjected to detailed revision, following the clarified chronology of his writings, which tends to shift the emphasis, as throughout, toward the serious?though young Donne remains "engaged in reading and writing and the life of a young man about town" without reference here to Walton's or his own allusions to the readings' having much to do with the points in con troversy between the churches or to the comment (which might have been expected to be specially attractive to this historian) about his frequenting the theatre and the ladies and being "not dissolute, but very neat." Despite the third satire, a basic assumption here and throughout is that religion did not for Donne become a dominant motive till "years later" (135; 133). But else where Donne becomes "troubled" rather than "restless" (157; 149). Though, with Edward Herbert, he still outdoes the Petrarchans in treating love and the mistress with glorifyingly argumentative hyperbole, the ambiguous rela tion of this to "the flesh" is dropped (161; 153). King still echoes Donne's "amatory wit" (162; 153), though a contrast for Carew is no longer provided by "Donne's most wanton elegies" but by "the immediacy of Donne's 'Elegy XIX' " (120; 117). His "auto-intoxication" has gone (317; 301), though his "extravagance" remains. He and Montaigne no longer serve to represent libertine naturalism (350; 332), but Walton still does not let us forget his "youthfull sins," regarding which some specification might have been in order (238; 224); and, though an addition stresses the asceticism and saintly death of Walton's preacher (237; 223) whose preparations after "that final challenge to the everlasting worm" are now less elaborate (321 ; 304), the young Donne remains the inheritor of outlawed Roman Catholic distress, "a sensual and cynical poet," an undifferentiated student of "sceptical and naturalistic thought," though now a "courtier" no longer said to have "known the pleasures of the court" who ultimately has, as to ordination, a new sense of "Providential guidance" (318; 302). Meanwhile the "conceited reflections" of his letters remain (243; 229); the seriously neglected elegies and verse-epistles, with ingenuity seldom fused with strong feeling, get even less attention (134; 131); and, in phrases that may make one wish to find better reasons, the "half-playful, half-serious" paradoxes remain "a link between the 'cynical' poet and the troubled preacher" (200; 189). The underlining of reservations about the effects of science has of course an important bearing on Donne. For him as for Greville science is mainly an illustration of intellectual vanity (99; 95), though with Greville, as against Daniel and Chapman, he can exemplify whatever is meant by "disillusioned fundamentalism" (100; 96). In relation to Drummond's echoing he is no longer a "troubled mind"; instead a sermon illustrates the unchanged faith of both (291 ; 277). He can remain in Milton's company to illustrate Browne's typical submission of reason to faith (351; 334), and can be added to Browne and Milton to characterize Burton's therapeutic view of the matter (295; 280), to Herbert and Crashaw as to the function of emblems (90; 90), to Vaughan as to the exiled soul's longing for return (153; 146), and, as preacher, can be contrasted with Bacon and Browne in seeing "America" as heaven rather than science (289; 274). As poet Donne is subject to simi?ar revisions reflecting the recent uncer</page><page sequence="7">Review Article 623 tain shiftings of opinion. Though the original judicious and discriminating contrast with Jonson remains unchanged and the contrast with Herbert has been heightened, the commentary on "Metaphysical" interpretation is of course considerably revised (130; 126) and the emphasis on eccentricities is softened in the light of recent developments. Spenser "remains a greater poet than Donne"?a judgment with which Donne would probably have agreed, though there is no notation here of the complex relations between the two; and Drummond and Johnson still provide a point of departure, though the conceit and tension have faded out in favor of the corrective orthodoxy of rhetorical technique and a common correspondency (not retaining its whole ness in Donne) and even the homiletic force of particularities as in Andrewes and Herbert. Yet the young Donne still simply gives "utterance to the dis contents and libertine consolations of the intellectuals who had outgrown the old verities and ideals," and little is said of the character of this utterance since it can be left to the uncertain care of the earlier volume in the series? though important additions associate it briefly with the logic, rhetoric, and decorum of the established mode of Elizabethan satire and with the exploita tion of Ovidian casuistry and wit, as opposed to the mythological (132-34; 129-30). Though The Progress of the Soul still first impresses by a surprisingly "brutal sexuality," other somewhat brutal comments on Jack's "conventional libertine naturalism" give place to explanatory remarks on Donne's private difficulties (but not on such business as Essex's), his "perrenial questioning" of man-woman, body-soul relations, and, reluctantly, on the "novel" Pythag orean-Platonic religious interpretation (134-35; 130-31). Additions as to the liturgical "Litany's" muscular plea for evenness and "Corona's" imper sonal statement of Christian paradoxes rather underline than prepare for the sudden "dramatic violence" and "changed perspective" stressed at revised length in the redated, tentatively rearranged, and just possibly contritional "Holy Sonnets" (135-36; 133-34). Though an interesting new effort strives to contain the sonnets between systematic meditation and the dramatic force and originality of explosive personal feeling, they leave the sinner cold, as Herbert does not. The "purpose of self-analysis" dominates the revised com ments on the Anniversaries, following the "mediative" analysis while finding the complex "She" an encumbrance and, wisely, insisting that the second is not mystical but is to be associated with "Litany" and Donne's subsequent career in its application to the world (137-38; 131-33). Revision here under lines what was already soundly said of the uses of old and new science; the two poems can be paralleled, reservedly, with Browne's Cyrus and Urne (355; 33^)'} but the network of meaningless particularities leaves Donne "off center" and less relevant than Chapman or Greville (138-39; 133)?a judg ment not much offset by extended comment on the meditative Christian paradoxicality of "Good-Friday," the "Nocturnal," "Germany" and the other hymns, despite an added reference to the Devotions (139-40; 133-34) Thus the poems continue, in a conclusion revised with emphasis, to illustrate a religious experience "equally intense and limited," concentrated on the par ticular moment and situation of John Donne, from a "concretely fundamen talist" point of view which blacks out the rest of life and the world and is incapable of achieving the "contemplative vision" of Herbert (140-41; 134-35).</page><page sequence="8">624 Barker The suspicion that we still somehow fail of perception as to Donne's satiric, hortatory, homiletic purposes and techniques, which may be sug gested by these revisions, may be underlined by comparable revisions as to the preacher. Here the Waltonian parallel with Augustine gets even heavier emphasis, though with no reference to its propaganda value for Anglican apologists from James through the significant date of Walton's publication (318; 302). While the "strain of the morbid and macabre" remains (to be slightly toned down later: 321-22), the Fathers now come in to replace "sex uality" and to shift the emphasis from science, and there is a sound added observation?also made elsewhere, in a recent public lecture?that, "so far as we know, Donne never at any time in his life had doubts about the Chris tian faith," an observation underlined (while being discriminated from the Hookerian) by slight revisions as to Biathanatos, an added reference to a sermon, and a long, though not markedly sympathetic, comment on Essays in Divinity, where the divine "purpose in the world" is recognized as more conventionally contemplated than in the Anniversaries, if the prayers sug gest the "more violent" of the sonnets (319-20; 303). Thus also "real humil ity" takes the place of "masochistic exhibitionism" (become, more spe cifically, "something of Puritan exhibitionism") in the account of the Devo tions. (Here it is regrettable that Miss Webber's exposition of the tripartite stylistic progression, in Anglia, was not available for notice, particularly since it is likely to become even more noticeable through her forthcoming, and unmentioned, Wisconsin study of the prose.) It is interesting that few changes needed to be made concerning Donne's homiletic technique, apart from some added concentration on the imaginative realization of particulars rather than of intelligibly regenerative doctrine. (Here one thinks of the somewhat intro ductorily simplified doctrinal parts of Mueller's new study, promised in the bibliography.) And it will be interesting to observe what effects result from a comment on our being inclined, "perhaps wrongly," to read the sermons from a preoccupiedly subjectivist point of view and to think Donne still "by nature something of a theatrical spellbinder" (323; 306). (A rhetorical angel preach ing from a rhetorical cloud and, despite Walton, in one?) But what will demand the most respectful attention and the most pre cise response from students of Donne is the series of carefully revised or addi tional caveats directed against currently developing lines of redeeming apology and tending to confirm the as yet unreconstructed opinion that "Donne's central faith is not much more complex than General Booth's" (326; 308). Whatever one's opinion of Booth (or of what constitutes the central faith of any other branch of Christianity), these authoritative opinions are challeng ing. Donne's "minute and barren exegesis" appears chiefly concerned with "fundamentalist" matters, sin, death, salvation, original sin, Christ's blood, burning, and obsessively with the corruption and ressurection of the body. (On this, D. B. Quinn, in JEGP, lxi, is at least not negligible.) His lately much emphasized ecumenicity and exaggerated "liberal charity" is strictly limited by his insistence on royal authority and his incessant attacks on Rome, atheists, idolaters, Jews, Turks, Papists, nonconformists, separatists, and so on. (Here Ian Sowton's sober review of the sober opinions on unity expressed throughout Donne's neglected letters, Canadian Journal of Theol ?iy&gt; VI&gt; is at least not irrelevant.) Though the inclinations inherited from</page><page sequence="9">Review Article 625 Jack are now played down, the "fascination with life and the world" (leading to now general agreement that he is not "mystical") is not offset by "the restless, inquiring reason of the instinctive sceptic (if this last word may be used in a very limited and unmodern sense)," for that issues in a "craggy approach to truth" and a faith "less rational and mystical than evangelical" in its focus on guilt rather than "vision" or "harmonious unity," in a very limitedly rational moderation quite unHookerian and (especially in its dis paragement of the moral ancients) quite outside the rational Christian humanist tradition represented by Erasmus, Hooker, Cambridge Platonism, Spenser, Milton (324-28; 306-309). (Here the omission of Donne's great granduncle is interesting; and at least Irving Low's documentation of Donne's middle way, JHI, xxn, is not to be overlooked.) What will make these ex tended caveats of particular interest is their collocation with unrevised, or very little revised, and more sympathetic comment on what at first sight seem not totally dissimilar preoccupations in Taylor (see, despite some under lining of the original Stoicism and the "systematic" contrast with Donne's "subtle and individual intellectualism," with the removal of some "macabre" and some Platonic illustrations, 330-35; 311-18), or in Andrewes (where Donne already appeared for company as to the oath of allegiance; 336; 319), or in Chillingworth, with his detestation of Socinianism, among other opinions (339; 321), or in even Hales with his detestation of Rome and the Dutch (341; 324), all of which will be underlined by an additional reference to Donne's view of sectarianism as more or less typical (346; 328), and an additional apology for Milton's controversial violence by reference to An drewes and Donne (389; 370). These revised appraisals of Donne would seem to indicate that a good deal more work will be required before the subjective shadows cast by the gossipy Gosse and the amateur Freudianism of the thirties can be finally dispelled. What has of late been done for Swift and was in process of being done (until there was another temporary beatifying hiatus) for More, needs badly to be done for Donne. Neither aesthetic nor rational absolutism can grasp the special (if peculiar) quality and bearing of Donne's purposeful techniques, because their bearing is specifically relative to the immediate early-seventeenth-century manifestations of a moral and religious collapse from whose consequences Herbert, Crashaw, Vaughan, and at first Marvell, withdrew in their various ways as the century proceeded to the desperations of its midpoint, and because their quality results from an intensely deter mined fusion of complex methods of which no other mind of the period was capable and from whose demands we instinctively turn to seek relief in the relative simplicit?s of others. Sufficient evidence of the kind of response Donne intentionally aimed to induce is provided by the period itself, and should keep us from unhistorical misconceptions. It would, for instance, be useful to maintain a firm grip on the two terms indicated by a couple of contem porary comments noted by Volume v in its first edition and remaining in its second, though apparently even more firmly dismissed than before: Godol phin's comment on Donne as "Pious dissector" of hearts and sins (123; 120), and Falkland's praise of his rational faith (343; 326). It is shameful to us that we apparently seem to know of Donne's response to and involvement in the tense immediate complexities of the Jacobean situation no more than Mrs.</page><page sequence="10">626 Barker Simpson told us?and that was enough to clear the mind of cant, especially with the support of Miss Gardner's notes and appendices. Our attention is, perhaps naturally, still focused on what this context led to in the end?as in this history's superb summary of midcentury opinion. Until we know a great deal more, in historical detail, about these complexities, it will remain diffi cult to see clearly that what we, more than quite possibly wrongly, interpret in terms of a purpose of self-analysis or an "onward-Christian-soldiers" evangelical fundamentalism is the effect, however ineffective, of a disciplined effort to induce a response of active and intelligent right-willing in terms of only too immediately present dangers. But it will be perceived in due course, after much further informed historical effort, that there is hardly a line of Donne's that is not the product of the sharpest objective evaluation of the disastrously threatening corruptions of the age and of those alternatives to the apparently inevitable course of history to which we are only just now, in our desperation, beginning to pay real attention. It will then still be possible to prefer the comfort of Herbert's refinedly withdrawn serenity, but it will then at least be possible to discern more accurately Donne's determined stance and drive. Meanwhile, those who find him historically interesting (and otherwise not unrewarding) need not be disturbed by the aid and comfort that will, rightly or wrongly, be found here by such self-advertising critics as have been announcing?in the manner of Madison Avenue, where they might be happier?that Donne's telstar must fall as they send Milton's into orbit, a current absurdity of criticism no less absurd than the parallel absurd ity of the thirties it reverses. It is thus the more interesting (and perhaps a consolation and a stay) that, at the other end of this most desperately crucial half-century in English history, Milton is subject to no significant revision of opinion, despite con siderable revision in detail reflecting some further refined perceptions and of course the activities recorded in the much enlarged bibliography. An added reference to the materials provided by alchemy and astrology for imaginative writers from Donne to Milton (274; 260) may suggest the desirability of reanalyzing Milton's pregnant pot (or that of his Sin and Death) along with (not Donne's but) that of the persona of "Loves Alchymie" (134; 130); a revised observation as to Locustae takes us back into the complex "gunpow der" tradition (88; 88); and the substitution of "Whichcote" for "Milton" to illustrate the Christian-humanist fusion of natural and revealed truth may come as a slight shock (333; 315). But it proves happily possible to delete or considerably revise a number of comments on wrong-headed appraisals of Milton (174, 377, 403; 164, 359, 383). Though there is some addition and much rewriting concerning the early poems, the original emphasis is not greatly changed: the contrast between Milton's "Nativity" and Crashaw's is significantly revised; the companion pieces now present "ideal abstractions" rather than "two sides of the author"; the Mask is slightly more Neoplatonic but there is no significant change as to its ethic; a recognition of response to the Italian canzone in Lycidas (as elsewhere) goes along with an underlining of the interwoven pastoral and Christian strains; and there is a sounder brief appraisal of "the much inferior" Epitaphium (380-88; 362-68). Save for some underplaying of the polarities of Milton's Christian humanism (390; 370), the revision of a wise comment on divorce (391; 371), and a sound second</page><page sequence="11">Review Article 627 thought on despair (394; 374), the comments on the prose are unchanged. However, in the pages on Milton under "Political Thought" slight revisions tend to simplify or remove some discriminations between Milton's thinking, especially as to church and state, and the more radical thinking of Williams and others?discriminations which have not, it is true, worked much appar ent conviction in anybody, though they remain to be clarified if Milton's controversial position, especially in 1659, here unfortunately somewhat scamped, is to make the sense to modern minds vaguely indicated by a couple of recent articles. But the judicious emphasis of these pages (261-64; 247-50) on Milton's preoccupation with "Christian liberty," its extent and limits as compared with the opinions of both reactionaries and radicals, leaves them still the most succinctly illuminating account of Milton's thought that is available?and one the editors of the three extant volumes of the Yale edition might profitably have meditated on with more respectfully detailed attention and so have forestalled the sense of inadequacies of inter pretation likely to develop as younger and less Whiggish generations of scholars mature. As to Paradise Lost, revision in detail leaves the main reading for our time unchanged. Theologically, the responsibilities of freedom are underlined; it is recognized that Adam's fault lies in "idolatry" rather than "passion" and that the opinion of speculative pride is comparable to Chapman's, Greville's, Donne's, while there is a new notation of the pre-Nicaean Neoplatonic roots of Milton's Christology and a revised concern for Milton's God, leaving the emphasis where it soundly was but depending less on the excuses provided by dramatization or the impercipient confusions of "royalism"?though not responding to recent "anthropomorphic" explanation (397-400; 377-81). The poem's response to evil "as a fact of life" is underlined, and Milton now, happily, proves conscious of the problem of treating the abstractly spiritual in concretely epic terms, no longer less fully than but "quite as much as the modern reader" (402; 382-83). His recreation of traditional genres and con ventions (380; 362) is stressed in this case by added or revised comments on Satan (especially as dramatic epic villain), the Son, the War, Creation, with additional stress on the "logical coherence" of organization "both massive and minute" (403-405; 383-84). While admiration for the grandeur of Mil tonic generality remains, there is a significantly new insistence on "abundant and subtle complexity" beneath the "deceptively smooth surface" (378; 360), as in the allusive symbolism of the Mask (385; 365), the artistic com petence of detached urbanity in the companion pieces (382; 363), the "dra matic objectivity and irony," the "ironic effect" of adaptations, and the "compassionate irony" of the epic (404, 405, 411; 384, 390)?recently the subject of a judiciously suggestive essay in this journal. The comments on the verse and style of the epic are much revised and elaborated (408-10; 388-90), and there are new comments on the middle style of "meditative georgic" in Paradise Regained (414; 392) and the abundance and variety of sustained pattern in Samson (418; 396). The ironic in Paradise Regained, a "masterpiece of artistic form," is stressed by added comment on Satan's increasing desperation, Christ's acceptance of the knowledge God reveals, and the climactic demonstration of his divinity (412-14; 390-93), though here and in Samson there is (as in a recent essay) an increased emphasis on</page><page sequence="12">628 Barker the hero's isolation, with which it is possible to disagree. Concerning Samson (still last despite arguments about its date), detailed minor revision points up Milton's manipulation of classic convention and preservation of Hebraic, as well as Greek, decorum, to emphasize the original appraisal, the movement of the hero's unexpected responses out of despair to tragic acceptance of provi dential power being underlined by a reduction?somewhat to be regretted in view of the implications of recent reappraisals?of comment on the Israelites and Dalila (416-18; 393-96). Save for one gloomy comment on "modern man," the conclusion as to Milton stands. So also does the conclusion of the whole, apart from a brief addition already noted and the heartening substitution (for severe observations on modern Baconian optimism and defeatist literature) of a brief comment on the possibility of modern imaginatively sympathetic response to the art and belief of the age (424; 402-403). In this connection it may not be impertinent to observe that a somewhat extra-literary and additional expression of opinion on an earlier page is open to question: it is not easy to see (and will not be easy for present and coming generations of students to see) why the authors of this period need be described as "the last generations of men who can con template the human condition with both the faith of real Christians and the natural feelings of 'natural men' " (293; 278). It is not necessary to be Christianly Utopist, romantically sentimentalist, simple-mindedly funda mentalist, or irrationally evangelistic to believe that this Newmanesque and Arnoldian observation, though obviously sincere, is quite mistaken. Whatever may be true in the Bemertons of New England, experience with students even in Manhattan, and more largely in Canada and the Middle West, sug gests that this is not a view of history or of the present to which one must subscribe by predestination or even under authority. In fact, among many other notable signs, this history itself, with its pervasively illuminating influ ence, and now with the meticulous revisions that will sustain and increase its influence, constitutes a monumental refutation of that view. A somewhat inexperienced (though not entirely untutored) reviewer of the first edition was moved presumptuously to regret that no chapter of the history drew together in an account of the function of literature its scattered comments on literary theory. That regret must stand and be underlined by a plea, if not for a book, at least for an authoritative public lecture on the sub ject. The reviewer also opined that Donne needed thorough re-examination "in the light of the historical pattern so sensitively defined in this book." Sufficient restatement has already been given to that opinion?whether obsessive fixation or better tutored sense of a continuing desideratum. But a consideration of the meticulous efforts of the second edition to remove what small indications of "intenebration" appeared in the first?to recall one of the historian's favorite quotations?requires only the addition of a slight empha sis to the original conclusion. "The sensitiveness is everywhere apparent in the deft use of brief but pithy quotations, in the constant feeling for the con nection between style and belief, in the discriminating appreciation of poetic effects, in the precise differentiation between shades of thought, and not least in the definition of a pattern which clarifies without dampening 'the soaring fire which in this age was distributed with such pentecostal generosity' " (UTQ, xvi).
