But no one has yet addressed what is most peculiar about it ? the way it seems to flout Woolf's own prescription for composing a novel. When Woolf began formulating her aesthetic in the early 1920s, she promoted her vision of the modern novel by defining it against the materialistic fiction of Edwardian authors like Arnold Bennett.2 Whereas Woolf wanted to write fiction that captures "life itself," the unfettered spirit of her characters,3 she tells us that Bennett's fiction captures only the surface of life: his novels, like his characters, resemble houses in which no one is at home.4 To the Lighthouse, in so many ways, 1. Entry for April 18, 1926, The Diary ofVirginia Woolf vol. 3, ed. Anne Olivier Bell with Andrew McNeillie (Har? court Brace, 1980), p. 76. 2. The most important essays for Woolf's aesthetic in this period are all variants of the same argument: "Modern Novels" (1919), which Woolf later rewrote as "Modern Fiction" (1925), and "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" (1923), which she substantially expanded and republished under the same title in 1924; for sake of convenience, I will refer to these four essays together as "the Bennett essays." In "Modern Fiction," Woolf writes that the Edwardian authors are materialists "because they are concerned not with the spirit but with the body" {The Essays of Virginia Woolf vol. 4, ed. Andrew McNeillie [Hogarth Press, 1994], p. 158). Woolf seems to have meant a number of things by this: the Edwardian novel? ists are too concerned with inessentials in their writing; too bound by convention; too imitative of the surface of life; too popular and commercial (on the one hand) or too political, class-conscious, and didactic (on the other hand) to qualify as serious artists (p. 159). 3. Woolf describes life as an "unknown and uncircumscribed spirit" ("Modern Fiction," p. 160), and she considers a modernist writer like Joyce "spiritual" (p. 161) insofar as his fiction strives to capture "the spirit we live by, life itself" ("Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" [1924], The Captain's Death Bed and Other Essays [Harcourt Brace, 1950], p. 119). 4. As early as 1919, Woolf is criticizing Bennett by likening his novels to empty houses. She admits that his books are solidly built, but what good is that craftsmanship "if life should refuse to live there?" ("Modern Novels," The Essays of Virginia Woolf, vol. 3, ed. Andrew McNeillie [Hogarth Press, 1988], p. 32). In 1925, she again affirms that "life escapes" Bennett's novels: "Whether we call it life or spirit, truth or reality, this, the essential thing, has moved off, or on" ("Modern Fiction," p. 160). And when she critiques Bennett's Hilda Lessways in 1924, she fixes on Hilda's house as the emblem of Bennett's narrow materialist vision: "Hilda not only looked at houses, and thought of houses; Hilda lived in a house" ("Bennett" [1924], pp. 108-9). Woolf's complaint is that Bennett "is trying to hypnotize us into the belief that, because he has made a house, there must be a person living there" (p. 109). And this is the trouble she has with the Edwardians gener- Mark Gaipa, "An Agnostic's Daughter's Apology: Materialism, Spiritualism, and Ancestry in Woolf's To the Lighthouse," Journal of Modern Literature, 26.2 (Winter 2002-2003), pp. 1-41. ?Indiana University Press, 2003.</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Modern Literature fulfills Woolf's vision of a modern novel; and "Time Passes" ? as the most daring element in the novel, and one that looks ahead to the visionary quality of The Waves ? would seem far removed from Bennett and the Edwardians. And yet, the outstanding feature of "Time Passes" is neverthe? less an empty house; in Woolf's own words, "I have to give [in "Time Passes"] an empty house, no people's characters, the passage of time, all eyeless &amp; featureless with nothing to cling to."5 How can we make sense of this? What is Woolf's emblem of degraded materialism ? which she had apparently turned her back on to write novels like To the Lighthouse ? doing in the heart of this defiantly modern novel? One is tempted to conclude that Woolf, uneasy with the material- ity of the abandoned house, makes time pass so quickly in this section so that she may rush past its deadening effect.6 But such an interpretation does not explain why Woolf felt she had to draw this symbol of materialism into her novel, or how the lyricism of "Time Passes" is compatible with it. We also need an interpretation that can explain the empty house's centrality in Woolf's narrative ? for the design of To the Lighthouse makes "Time Passes" stand between the failures and successes of her characters. When Lily Briscoe returns to the house in part three ofthe novel, "The Lighthouse," she is finally able to complete the painting she had left unfinished in part one, "The Window," while the trip to the lighthouse that James had desired ten years earlier is also completed by surviving members of the family. Where does the difference lie, if not in the empty house in part two? The success Woolf's characters experience in "The Lighthouse" in fact depends on the fortune of the house in "Time Passes," but to understand how this is so we first need to trace Woolf's debate with Bennett back to a surprising cultural context. When Woolf opposes her writing to that of the materialists, she is essentially aligning herself ? and modern art ? with the position that spiritualists in the nineteenth century staked out against scientific naturalism and material? ism. The idea that Woolf may be using this aging cultural debate to promote her modern aesthetic may seem unlikely, but the link is confirmed by the manuscripts of "Time Passes"; here Woolf resumes the debate she had earlier conducted with the Edwardian materialists, but in the mean- time the empty house in her novel has clearly become a token of the materialist universe: a world without a knowable god, in which evolution (time passing) changes the living without any certain divine guidance, and in which people are probably bodies without immortal souls. It was precisely this view of the universe that so strongly moved her parents' generation; and it is the specter of Woolf's father, Leslie Stephen, that ultimately haunts the materialism Woolf first criticizes in her Edwardian forebears and later monumentalizes in the middle of her family novel. After Huxley, Leslie Stephen was the most famous agnostic of his day; we shall see that Stephen's writings on agnosticism ? most notably his essay "What Is Materialism?" ? provided a crucial subtext for Woolf as she composed her novel.7 ally, whose novels place "an enormous stress upon the fabric of things": they "have given us a house in the hope that we may be able to deduce the human beings who live there" (p. 112). 5. Diary, vol. 3, p. 76. 6. One is also tempted to think that the house in Woolf's novel may have nothing to do with her prior argument with Bennett, since it is apparently modeled on the Talland House at St. Ives that Woolf idealized in her memoirs. But Woolf cannot spend six years using the empty house as an emblem for materialism in her criticism and then have it mean some? thing entirely else in her fiction. We will also see that numerous parallels between the Bennett essays and To the Lighthouse indicate that Woolf thought of the two together. 7. I make this claim despite Woolf's contention that she "specially refrained either from reading her [mother's] letters, or [her] father's life" when composing the novel (The Letters of Virginia Woolf, vol. 3, ed. Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann [Harcourt Brace, 1977], p. 379).</page><page sequence="3">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology Contrary to what we might think, the house in "Time Passes" is not really empty, for it con? tains, in its emptiness, the materialist arguments Woolf associated with her father's agnosticism. And the impersonal stance Woolf assumes in this difficult, abstract piece of writing also belies how intensely personal this section was for her. With the help of Woolf's biography, her manu? scripts, and Stephen's writings, we will see how the author has quietly structured her relation with both of her parents into the middle of her novel. We will also see how indispensable the agnosti? cism brought to the foreground in these pages is to Woolf's portrait of her parents in the novel as a whole. Today's readers of To the Lighthouse are prepared to discern a critique of patriarchy woven into the Ramsay marriage;8 what they have overlooked is how the peculiar dynamic of the Ramsay household ? and the angel at its center ? are also a response to the disappearance of god. The materialism in "Time Passes" points out the central importance of religion in Woolf's novel. But To the Lighthouse is no testament to religious faith. Woolf begins the novel (as well as "Time Passes") by criticizing her father's agnosticism, which she views as a materialist obstacle standing between her and the spirituality she associates with her mother; but by the novel's end, Woolf has come to regard materialism as a crucial (though painful) trigger for vision. One reason "Time Passes" is so confusing is that Woolf's view of agnosticism undergoes a sea change in these pages. Taking over her father's exploration of what happens to morality in the wake of religion, Woolf uses her fiction to renovate the Ramsays' agnostic household ? a transformation we wit? ness when Woolf nearly lets the empty house of materialism collapse, only to have it restored and opened again to life. As this restructuring unfolds, Woolf also rehabilitates her father's agnosti? cism by re-conceiving it (and him) as open to a belief in spirit, even as she refashions her mother's role, as angel, by opening her spirit to the materialism within her family's agnostic home. The result is that Woolf, in part three, draws upon both spiritualism and materialism, in equal mea- sures, and does so in the name of a hard-won balance that reflects her triumphant inheritance of an agnostic view of the world. In the end, Woolf's To the Lighthouse is as much an agnostic's apology as any essay written by her father. As the very site of vision in her novel, the empty house in "Time Passes" indeed runs contrary to Woolf's early pronouncements about modern fiction; as such, it points out the limits of trying to size up Woolf's novel ? and her fiction generally ? in terms of the Bennett essays that she wrote in the early twenties. Only when Woolf succeeds in accommodating materialism in her vision does she embrace the openness ? the balance of impressionism and impersonality, "a butterfly's wing . . . clamped together with bolts of iron"9 ? that makes her writing both modern and distinctively her own. This means that Woolf achieves her vision in To the Lighthouse not by turning her back on the past, but by paradoxically affirming, in the house of her fiction, the agnos? tic doubt that long ago defined her parents' world. I: "Time Passes" and the Victorian Crisis of Religion As readers will recall, "Time Passes" recounts what happens to the Ramsay summer house during the ten years the family leave it vacant. Speeding up narrative time, Woolf shows us ? in eighteen pages ? how the neglected house decays over the years and is saved from collapse only by 8. See, for instance, Jane Lilienfeld, "'Where the Spear Plants Grew': the Ramsays' Marriage in To the Lighthouse? New Feminist Essays on Virginia Woolf, ed. Jane Marcus (University of Nebraska Press, 1981), pp. 148-69. 9.

Though the perspective of "Time Passes" remains trained on the summer residence, Woolf periodically interrupts her account of the empty house to give us poignantly understated updates about the absent family members; this is how we learn, for instance, about the deaths of Mrs. Ramsay, Prue, and Andrew. This bracketed information connects these middle pages to the narrative in the rest ofthe novel, and the counterpoint that results in "Time Passes" ? between the empty house and the lives of its former occupants ? creates the section's signature dynamic. What readers of To the Lighthouse may not know is that this bracketed information about the family is a late addition to "Time Passes." When Woolf drafted "Time Passes" in May 1926,10 and then revised it for independent publication in the French journal Commerce later that winter,11 the only mention ofthe absent family came from what Mrs. McNab thought about them. In the absence of these intermittent updates, another narrative, which survives in reduced form in the published version of the novel, played a major role in framing "Time Passes." This is Woolf's account of some dreamers who are troubled in their sleep and leave the house to pace the shore. Apparently disturbed by doubts about the nature of the universe, these sleepers ? who are variously identified as "restless spirits" (Holograph, p. 233), "escaped soul[s]" (p. 207), "solitary watchers" (p. 216), and "mystic [s]" (p. 214) ? attempt to summon from the sea a divinity that may assure them of the order and purpose of the world. Their faith in divine guidance is further strained by the war; but with the resumption of peace at the end of the section, they are tempted to resume their belief in a higher, benevolent power. Because Woolf juxtaposes the ordeal of these restless spirits against her account ofthe fall and rise of the empty house, these dual narratives seem to be the source for her later idea of counter- posing the empty house and its absent inhabitants. But Woolf's manuscripts suggest that this coun? terpoint in "Time Passes" has an even deeper origin in the struggle between belief and doubt that stirs the pacers on the beach from their sleep. When we first encounter these restless spirits at the start of "Time Passes," they are troubled by "the anguish of life, its concealed pain" (Holograph, p. 198), and they reach out in sleep to "ghostly ... confidantes" (p. 199) ? to some "counterpart" or "sharer" who might offer the "completeness ... denied them by day" (p. 200): To each a sharer; to each thought, complet[ion].. . [So it] it might be that, [in dreams] dreaming sleeping each passed from the house &amp; paced the beach . . . like ghosts who will no more put on the cumber &amp; trouble of flesh ... &amp; found in loneliness the consum- mation . . . to cry out &amp; have the wind [echo] toss back an answer . . . to shed in that darkness, nose &amp; eyes &amp; the old slips &amp; shifts of the tongue. (p. 200)12 The sleepers appear to find momentary comfort here in transcending their bodies, but they are unable to escape the doubts that chase after them in the very next paragraph:13 10.

Brackets in this quote indicate words that appear crossed out in Woolf's manuscript. 13. Woolf's typescript of "Time Passes" clarifles how the skepticism that follows the sleepers here is their own: "It might be that dreaming and sleeping each put off the cumber and trouble of flesh and left the house and paced the beach and asked of the wave and the sky: is the sharp-edged furniture all, and the flower; is the day all; is our duty to the day?" (p. 280).</page><page sequence="5">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology Then they say ... how there is no soul, [&amp;] no ... immortality ... or completeness; [&amp; that] The [tables] sharpedged furniture is there, they say, &amp; the flower, but it [has died before morning]; &amp; they say the day is all; &amp; . . . our duty is to the day; &amp; [those who] escape is cowardice &amp; the wind nothingness, &amp; the furniture all. &amp; [these chinks &amp; crevices which might tempt anyone of them, in the] this immense darkness, &amp; sleep ... to [believe in] escape [&amp; try] it are the cloaks of superstition &amp; deceit. (pp. 200-01) Against the sleepers' desire to achieve spiritual completeness with a higher being, Woolf counter- poses a naturalistic view of the world which skeptically regards their spiritual aspirations as mere fiction, "superstition &amp; deceit." Clearly, this passage echoes the debate that Woolf conducted in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" between Georgian modernists and Edwardian materialists. But the differences are important. Woolf's restless spirits do not simply resume that earlier contest between spirit and matter ? they also dramatize it when they turn their backs on the house. And when Woolf shuttles us between the spirits on the shore and the empty house they have left behind, she is not simply comparing two kinds of fiction but rather exploring the two competing philo? sophical outlooks ? idealism and materialism ? that hover vaguely behind Woolf's Georgians and Edwardians. Through Woolf's disembodied sleepers, who look for completion in a spiritual counterpart, we get a glimpse of the world where spirit is the only reality, and where all material- ity (as fiction or appearance) is no longer real before us; once "shed ... [of] nose &amp; eyes," we have lost even the senses needed to perceive the world of objects. And through the empty house where "furniture [is] all," we get a contrasting view of the world where matter is the only reality ? the material world that the sleepers have sought to leave behind, the object world when we are not there to observe it.14 This drama of conflicting spiritualist and materialist perspectives becomes clear when, moments after Woolf has released the sleepers from their bodies, certain airs ? which appear animated, but prove to be just wind ? make their first attempt to invade the empty house. Among the furniture, they discover the unconscious bodies the sleepers have left behind ? bodies that have become (like Bennett's characters) empty houses for their departed souls. From this, we may conclude that "Time Passes" does not simply represent the world with? out a self, as it has sometimes been described.15 Rather, from its very inception, and continuing into the counterpoint of the final published version, "Time Passes" stages a contest between two incompatible views of the world.16 It has also been commonplace to read the disruption of "Time Passes" as expressing the violence of the first World War,17 and thus what draws a boundary in the 14. I am taking my cue here from Ann Banfield, who says (but not about "Time Passes" per se) that "Woolf's characteris? tic conception of death is the separation of subject and object, the possibility of one observing nothing and the other exist? ing unobserved. Death is one name for their independence" (The Phantom Table: Woolf, Fry, Russell and the Epistemology of Modernism [Cambridge University Press, 2000], p. 214). 15. Mary Jacobus, for instance, claims that "there is no subject of consciousness" in "Time Passes" ('"The Third Stroke': Reading Woolf with Freud" in Virginia Woolf, ed. Rachel Bowlby [Longman, 1992], p. 117), and J. Hillis Miller describes "Time Passes" as Woolf's "extraordinary representation ... of the world without any witnessing consciousness other than the ubiquitous mind of the narrator" ("Mr. Carmichael and Lily Briscoe: The Rhythm of Creativity in To the Lighthouse" in Modernism Reconsidered, ed. Robert Kiely et al. [Harvard University Press, 1983], p. 169). 16. By contrast, Jane Marcus claims that Woolf's manuscript shows her "first plan was to narrate the 'Time Passes' sec? tion through Mrs. McNab" (Virginia Woolf and the Languages ofPatriarchy [Indiana University Press, 1987], p. 12). I can find in Woolf's manuscript no evidence for this, or for Michael Tratner's subsequent claim that Woolf originally intended "Time Passes" to be Mrs. McNab's "internal monologue" (Modernism and Mass Politics: Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, Yeats [Stan? ford University Press, 1995], pp. 58, 75). 17. See, for instance, Kathy Phillips, Virginia Woolf against Empire (University of Tennessee Press, 1994), p. 113; or Makiko Minow-Pinkney, Virginia Woolf &amp; the Problem ofthe Subject (Harvester, 1987), pp. 98-99.</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Modern Literature novel between past and present ? much as Woolf, in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," separates Edwardian from Georgian by installing the historical barrier "on or about December, 1910" when "human character changed" ("Bennett" [1924], p. 96). But even though the title of "Time Passes" instructs us to look ahead, the debate that frames this section is really an extension of the concerns of the past. There is little difference between the doubt-driven restlessness of the sleepers and, for instance, the conflicting ways Mrs. Ramsay earlier regards the waves in "The Window": first as a "a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts" that "seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again ... the words of some old cradle song, murmured by nature," and then as "a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat[ing] the measure of life" which "made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea" (p. 16). In fact, these competing views of the world ? shared by both Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay as well as the sleepers ? indicate how "Time Passes" originates not in war, nor in the death of Mrs. Ramsay, nor even in Woolf's earlier aesthetic theory,18 but rather in the Victorian crisis of religion ? the struggle between religion and science, faith and skepticism ? that shook her parents' generation. As numerous cultural documents such as In Memoriam or "Dover Beach" attest, science and espe? cially evolutionary theory had eroded belief in orthodox religion during the nineteenth century, but for many Victorians the triumph of the new materialism (represented by worldviews like utili- tarianism, positivism, and naturalism) failed to provide the emotional security that religion had offered, leaving them desirous of some other source of spiritual comfort.19 In 1877, W.K. Clifford discussed these feelings of inconsolable emptiness while participating in a "Modern Symposium" about "The Influence upon Morality of a Decline in Religious Belief": [I]t cannot be doubted that theistic belief is a comfort and a solace to those who hold it, and that the loss of it is a very painful loss. It cannot be doubted, at least, by many of us in this generation, who either profess it now, or received it in our childhood and have parted from it since with such searching trouble as only cradle-faiths can cause. We have seen the spring sun shine out of an empty heaven, to light up a soulless earth; we have felt with utter loneliness that the Great Companion is dead.20 18. As we will see, "Time Passes" shares with the Bennett essays a common origin in Woolf's conflicted feelings about her parents. 19. Alan Willard Brown writes that "during the latter half of the nineteenth century all religious authority . . . [was] subjected, more intensively than ever before, to searching criticism in the light of a secular philosophy and in the spirit of an essentially naturalistic or materialistic science" but that the "struggles between religious orthodoxy and science in the sixties brought. . . searching doubts to the minds of many men not deceived by the easy certainties of an age of material progress" (The Metaphysical Society [Columbia University Press, 1947], pp. 284-85, 40). According to Frank Miller Turner, "the narrow confines of the dogmatic science of T.H. Huxley, John Tyndall, and Herbert Spencer nurtured a new variety of honest doubter who questioned the all-sufficiency of contemporary scientific concepts"; such doubters could accept "'the methods and results of Science'" while refusing to surrender '"the ancient hopes'" for spiritual transcendence (Between Science and Religion: The Reaction to Scientific Naturalism in Late Victorian England [Yale University Press, 1974], p. 3). Janet Oppenheim adds that '"reluctant doubters' who could not dispense with the solace of theism, who refused to endorse scientific naturalism as the sole key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe, [treated their] loss of Christian faith [as] merely the opening bout in a determined struggle to find alternatives to the materialistic vision that they rejected" (The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914 [Cambridge University Press, 1985], p. 118).

It is no coincidence that Clifford's words speak to Woolf's restless spirits ? for he was addressing here the Metaphysieal Society, whose members have often been described as "reluctant doubters," "restless" agnostics, and "seekers."21 Between 1870 and 1881, the Metaphysieal Society ? probably the most famous discussion group of the Victorian period22 ? tried to resolve the spiritual crisis in England by seeking common ground between theistic and materialist positions.23 Though the Society included confirmed agnos? tics and men of science like Clifford and Huxley, as well as committed theologians, the group is best characterized by men like Henry Sidgwick who, subject to Clifford's "searching trouble" from a loss of faith, found no comfort in the naturalistic universe and ? like Woolf's searchers ? rest- lessly sought some reconciliation between doubt and belief.24 Regarded by many as the very pic? ture of the restless Victorian doubter,25 Sidgwick had entered the Church at Cambridge, only to lose his faith; yet as one friend remembered him, he could never "'acquiesce in a godless world.' He could not find rest in agnosticism, and, though accepting the methods of modern science, revolted against its atheistic tendencies."26 The Metaphysieal Society dissolved in 1881, presum? ably because its members had made little headway reconciling their conflicting perspectives.27 But Sidgwick ? who insisted that "I am quite content to go on seeking while life lasts"28 ? persisted in helping form other groups that continued the search. The most notable of these was the Society for Psychical Research, which ? from 1882 forward ? investigated a host of spiritualist phenomena (like seances, haunted houses, and telepathy), and sought to find scientific proof ? or disproof ? of the independent existence of spirit.29 When Woolf separates body from spirit in "Time Passes" and writes about restless souls who seek an elusive spiritual harmony at odds with the facts of materialism, she has in effect recre- ated in these pages the same tension between faith and doubt that impelled both the Metaphysieal Society and the Society for Psychical Research. The evidence that Woolf had such metaphysieal searchers in mind would be circumstantial at best were it not that Woolf's father was himself an active participant in these debates. Leslie Stephen was a member of the Metaphysieal Society in its latter years (1877-81) and allegedly an early member of the Society for Psychical Research as well.30 His brother Fitzjames ? also a Society member ? orchestrated the Modern Symposium 21. "A Modern 'Symposium'" essentially reproduced for the English public a debate that its contributors ? all members of the Metaphysical Society ? conducted in private at one of their sessions (Brown, p. 38). John Tulloch described the Victorian restless spirits ? the kind of men who were drawn to the Society ? as a "class of minds who, while repelling the old solutions and the ecclesiastical connections identified with them, are yet restlessly impelled to new solutions" (quoted in Oppenheim, p. 118). When G. Lowes Dickinson in 1905 composed his own Modern Symposium ? a fictional session of the Metaphysical Society ? he identified it as "a club known as the Seekers" (A Modern Symposium [Frederick Ungar 1962], p. 3). 22.

Leslie Stephen was also friendly with both Clifford and Sidgwick; in fact, Stephen composed the description of Sidgwick ? upon the latter's death, in 1901 ? as a restless agnostic that I cited above. We will see shortly just how important Sidgwick is for Woolf's novel. But for now, it suffices to note that Stephen had much in common with him: he too attended Cambridge, was ordained, and then ? experiencing religious doubts ? repudiated his Holy Orders. And both men, partly in response to their common fall from belief, would go on to write big books on ethics that explored whether morality could survive without religious sanctions: Sidgwick's The Methods of Ethics in 1874, and Stephen's The Science of Ethics in 1882.31 Stephen's book on ethics was a product of the Victorian debate between faith and science, but Stephen most squarely engaged this debate in the essays he wrote about agnosticism. I believe these essays are the resource Woolf turned to for representing Victorian doubts in her novel. In "An Agnostic's Apology," Stephen treats the "dark riddle of the universe," much as Woolf does in "Time Passes," by inquiring into the difference between gnostic faith and agnostic skepticism.32 His essay "What Is Materialism?" offers an even more compelling source for Woolf's dealings with agnosticism in her novel. Here again Stephen inquires into the competing perspectives of materialism and spiritualism;33 but he also goes on to address the very things that Lily, in To the Lighthouse, identifies with Mr. Ramsay's philosophy: Whenever she "thought of his work" she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table. It was Andrew's doing. She asked him what his father's books were about. "Sub? ject and object and the nature of reality," Andrew had said. And when she said Heavens, she had no notion what that meant. "Think of a kitchen table then," he told her, "when you're not there." (Lighthouse, p. 23) Like Mr. Ramsay, Stephen addresses "subject and object and the nature of reality" in "What Is Materialism?" telling us, for instance, that "an object without a subject is a meaningless phrase" (p. 135). And like Andrew, he also calls upon a table to illustrate how, from our individual acts of perception, we formulate a common object-world: "'This is a table' is a phrase which in the first place asserts that I have a certain set of organised sense-impressions. But it also means that you have an analogous set of impressions, and that if we changed places we should also change sensations" (p. 137).34 The most surprising evidence of Woolf's debt to this essay, however, lies in something that has yet to be acknowledged: "What Is Materialism?" is also where Woolf gets the idea of using "The Fisherman and His Wife" in her novel. Towards the end of the essay, Stephen recounts how "an eminent theologian" ? Adolf Harnack, in his work Dogmengeschichte, or the History of Christian Dogma ? "compares the history of religion to the fairy-story ofthe mortal to 31. Noel Annan, Leslie Stephen: The Godless Victorian (Random House, 1984), pp. 40, 70, 278, 282; Oppenheim, pp. 113,115. 32.

Jane Marcus [Indiana University Press, 1987], p. 53) agree that "What Is Materialism?" could have served instead as Woolf's source.</page><page sequence="9">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology whom it was granted to become whatever he wished, and who rose through successive stages to be king, kaiser, and pope, and then wished to become God, when he fell back to his original misery" (p. 162). The story Stephen describes is clearly a version of the Grimm's fairy tale that Mrs. Ramsay reads to James ? and which Woolf quotes extensively from ? in "The Window." It can hardly be a coincidence that the very essay where spiritualism and materialism are con- trasted, where the relation between subject and object is debated, and where a table is summoned as an example, also mentions just one fairy tale which happens to be the one fairy tale Woolf eventually folds into her novel.35 Woolf, in composing To the Lighthouse and "Time Passes" in particular, is clearly responding to what she encountered in her father's agnostic writings. But why has she drawn these debates into her novel? If we listen closely to "Time Passes," we can begin to answer that question ? for we can actually hear Woolf arguing with her father. The main point Stephen makes in "What Is Materialism?" is that there are necessary limits to what we can know, and that we "land... into insuperable difficulties" when we presume to step beyond them (p. 129). Stephen makes no judgment about the existence of the hereafter, but his agnosticism clearly works to weaken the hold that spiritual faith has on us; like Mr. Ramsay at the start of the novel, when he contradicts his wife's assurance to James that it may be fine tomorrow, Stephen contends that there is every reason to distrust what we have to take on faith, and that the progress of humankind largely comes from "materialists" heeding what the empirical sciences reveal about the world (pp. 131,159).36 In Stephen's day, this confidence in the power of naturalism to transform mankind was derided by critics as itself a false faith: the naturalists had repudiated the Church only to worship science, and their slavish obedience to empiricism blinded them to the higher realities of man? kind.37 It was spiritualists, committed to the reality ofan unseen world, who largely fashioned this criticism of materialism as complacent, limited, dogmatic.38 Woolf steps into this critical outlook when she faults Bennett's materialist novels as being inhospitable to spirit; and she calls upon it again to criticize her father. Woolf tells us that Leslie Stephen had a limited, unimaginative mind,39 while Lily says that what she disliked about Mr. Ramsay was "his narrowness, his blindness" {Lighthouse, p. 46). 35. What may be a coincidence is this: the story of "The Fisherman and His Wife" also makes an appearance in the actual history of Woolfs family during one of their last stays together in Cornwall. Though Stephen composed "What Is Materialism?" in 1885, he substantially revised it for republication in An Agnostic's Apology during the summer of 1892; and only at this time did he add his reference to Harnack's Dogmengeschichte, which he had been reading at St. Ives (Frederick Maitland, The Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen [Duckworth, 1906], reprinted by Thoemmes Antiquar- ian Books [1991], pp. 412-13). In To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Ramsay reads James the fairy tale while Mr. Ramsay ? out of earshot ? walks outdoors along the shore. But we now know that in July, 1892 ? when Woolf was ten years old ? her father was thinking and writing about "The Fisherman and His Wife" in his study at Talland House. 36. Stephen concludes "What Is Materialism?" by advising that we make "the best of the materials at our disposal, and conform[] to the known conditions ofthe world around us, instead of construct [ing] a fanciful palace under the guidance of arbitrary fancy" (p. 167). 37. According to Turner, restless spirits like Sidgwick would not "submit to a new enslavement to narrow, often intel- lectually shallow, scientific dogma, propagated by another intolerant and sometimes uncritical secular priesthood," for they "knew that religion ... encompassed dimensions of life and experience unrecognized within the context of scientific naturalism" (p. 35). 38. It "became the special task ofthe spiritualists... to deplore and combat the materialism that they perceived as all too rampant in their time" (Oppenheim, p. 61). 39. In "A Sketch ofthe Past" (1939-40), Woolf depicts her father, "the muscular agnostic," as having a strong mind that nonetheless lacked subtlety and imagination: he had "an impatient, limited mind; a conventional mind entirely accepting his own standard of what is honest, what is moral, without a shadow of doubt accepting this is a good man; that is a good woman. . .. That shows a very simply constructed view of the world" (Moments of Being, ed. Jeanne Schulkind [Hogarth Press, 1985], p. 115).</page><page sequence="10">10 Journal of Modern Literature And in "Time Passes," Woolf repeatedly invokes her father's agnosticism only to overrule the empirical limits he advises us to observe. When Stephen compares spirit and matter in "What Is Materialism?" he insists that the two are so inextricably connected that we can never separate one from the other: "I do not believe that any metaphysician can separate soul and body by logical analysis" (p. 161). Yet such an agnostic stance ? which claims that materialism and spiritual? ism are alike unknowable metaphysieal fictions ? is belied by the very experiment Woolf has undertaken in "Time Passes" of separating body from spirit. Stephen also claims that there is no knowing what lies beyond our world, and any "beyond" that we conceive is merely a projection of what we see in this one: "I cannot get into a world outside of all experience. . . . We cannot peep behind the curtain_The curtain is the reality. The effort to look behind it is an effort to get out of ourselves. It only plunges us into the transcendental region of antinomies and cobwebs of the brain" (pp. 143-44). And yet, Woolf again defies her father's agnostic stance when the sleepers seek completion by trying to glimpse a deity hidden behind the curtain of material appearances: It seemed now as if, touched by human penitence and all its toil, divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it, single, distinct, the hare erect; the wave failing; the boat rocking, which, did we deserve them, should be ours always. But alas, divine goodness, twitching the cord, draws the curtain;. . . he covers his treasures in a drench of hail, and so breaks them, so confuses them that it seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth. For our penitence deserves a glimpse only; our toil respite only. (Lighthouse, pp. 127-28) Here the restless spirits appear to have a fleeting vision of divine goodness: behind the curtain of our fallen world lies a gnostic realm that promises the comfort of eternity ("ours always") and the absolute (knowledge ofthe "perfect whole" and "truth" unavailable from our mortal position). It is such a vision that Stephen ? who professed to be quite content with his lack of belief ? unfailingly criticized, as dishonest, in his agnostic writings. What stands between Woolf's restless spirits and this comforting vision is the empty house: the prospect of a universe without a god, a world without design, a body without a soul. In "Time Passes," however, we now see that Stephen presents a similar obstacle to Woolf herself. Woolf had described "Time Passes" as "this impersonal thing, which I'm dared to do by my friends";40 but its true daring lies in how well she has veiled her personal involvement in it. Woolf appears to step away from herself and to mystically contemplate the world apart from human perception, but "Time Passes" remains as much a family affair as "The Window." When Woolf writes that "They say ... our duty is to the day," she is echoing what her father repeatedly says in his agnostic writings: that all sanctions for ethics must come from earth-bound morality and not from dictates issued from above. And when Woolf seeks to transcend the limits of her father's agnosticism, she assumes the spiritual restlessness ofthe men that Leslie Stephen argued against in his writings and at meetings of the Metaphysieal Society ? men like Henry Sidgwick.41 But Woolf did not simply 40. Diary, vol. 3, p. 36. 41. Woolf exceeds the empirical limits of the naturalist perspective when she notes, in introducing her restless spirits, how "there rose . . . thoughts, dreams, impulses, of which the sleepers by day knew nothing" (Typescript, p. 279). And when these sleepers reach out for "a completeness denied [them] by day," they express their dissatisfaction with material-</page><page sequence="11">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 11 back into the position of the restless searcher; in her diary, she made the identification explicit. On February 27, 1926, about the time she was composing the scene from "The Window" where Mrs. Ramsay fails into darkness, Woolf wrote that "I have some restless searcher in me. Why is there not a discovery in life? Something one can lay hands on &amp; say 'This is it?'"42 Moments later in her diary, Woolf recounts a mystical vision she had while walking about Bloomsbury that at last allowed her to feel "quite at rest": Then (as I was walking through Russell Sqre last night) I see the mountains in the sky: the great clouds; &amp; the moon which is risen over Persia; I have a great &amp; astonishing sense of something there, which is "it" ? It is not exactly beauty that I mean. It is that the thing is in itself enough: satisfactory; achieved. A sense of my own strangeness, walking on the earth is there too: of the infinite oddity of the human position. .. . I do fairly frequently come upon this "it"; &amp; then feel quite at rest.43 If Woolf is to find rest in a similar vision by the end of To the Lighthouse, she will first have to get past her father's agnosticism in "Time Passes." We can begin to appreciate how she maneuvers around her father when she makes Mr. Ramsay into a metaphysician. In her manuscript, we learn that Mr. Ramsay "wrote about books about metaphysics" (Holograph, p. 29); in the published novel, Mrs. Ramsay consoles her husband by telling him, "Charles Tansley thought him the great? est metaphysician of the time" (p. 37); and in both texts, Woolf describes Mr. Ramsay and his work as being "visionary," "austere" (Holograph, p. 253; Lighthouse, p. 155): "only one man in a thousand... could even understand" his philosophy (Holograph, p. 29). Woolf is certainly justified in associating her father with philosophy; though he made his livelihood as an editor, journalist, and essayist, Stephen wrote a number of histories about philosophie thought in England (most notably The History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century), and with his The Science of Ethics Stephen believed he had made "his one substantial contribution to thought."44 Yet in this book ? as well as his essays on agnosticism, which better represent Stephen's lasting contribution ism, much as restless spirits like Sidgwick "longed to find some other basis [besides orthodox Christianity] for the ethical precepts they cherished and some reassurance that all human suffering was not utterly devoid of purpose" (Oppenheim, p. 152). 42. Diary, vol. 3, p. 62. Susan Dick traces the restless searcher in "Time Passes" back to Woolf's diary, but she does not relate this figure to the "reluctant doubters" and hopeful spiritualists ofthe Victorian period, claiming merely that the "reli? gious context" in this part ofthe novel is vague ("The Restless Searcher: A Discussion ofthe Evolution of 'Time Passes' in To the Lighthouse," English Studies in Canada 3 [Autumn 1979], p. 320). 43. Diary, vol. 3, pp. 62-63. We should note that at the time Woolf had this vision in Russell Square ? in fact, for the entire time she resided at 52 Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury, from 1924 to the late 1930's ? she was neighbors with the restless spirits who made up the Society for Psychical Research, which had its headquarters a few doors down at 31 Tavis? tock Square. 44. The words belong to Stephen's biographer, Noel Annan (Leslie Stephen: His Thought and Character in Relation to his Time [Harvard University Press, 1952], p. 214). Annan dismisses Stephen's project of an evolutionary ethics as a mis- guided failure ? as does William Quillian; but Quillian nonetheless calls The Science of Ethics "one ofthe most notable contributions made" by a follower of Darwin and Spencer, and he cites Rudolf Metz's opinion that it is "the maturest and best thought-out contribution to establishing morals upon the foundation of an evolutionist philosophy" (The Moral Theory of Evolutionary Naturalism [Yale University Press, 1945], p. 24). Herbert Paul further suggests the importance The Sci? ence of Ethics may have had for Stephen, calling it "the central book of his life" (Leslie Stephen, Essays on Ereethinking and Plainspeaking, ed. James Bryce and Herbert Paul [Smith, Elder, 1907], p. xxiv). These judgments about Stephen's book echo William Bankes' belief that Mr. Ramsay "had made a definite contribution to philosophy" (Lighthouse, p. 23); but whereas Ramsay's contribution consists of "one little book when he was only five and twenty," The Science of Ethics is a tome that took Stephen years to write and that was finally published (in 1882) when he was fifty years old.</page><page sequence="12">12 Journal of Modern Literature to philosophy ? Woolf's father consistently argues against metaphysics while aligning himself with the authority of science. As the title of The Science of Ethics indicates, Stephen sought to take the subject of ethics away from philosophy/metaphysics and re-establish it on the basis of evolu- tionary naturalism.45 It is important to note that when Stephen wrote this book, he was deliberateiy trying to write a naturalistic correction to Sidgwick's The Methods of Ethics, which he faulted for being metaphysieal.46 For Stephen, metaphysics is the philosophical counterpart to theology; hope- lessly out of touch with the real world and its problems, metaphysics is the problem that agnosti? cism is intended to solve.47 This conflict between agnosticism and metaphysics is so fundamental in Stephen's writing that Woolf could not be unaware of it; her characterizing Mr. Ramsay as a metaphysician therefore has a significance that is overlooked or fudged by most critics.48 With her portrait of Mr. Ramsay the philosopher, Woolf is once again willfully contradicting Leslie Ste? phen. She is also refashioning his agnosticism to make him look more like Henry Sidgwick. II: Angels and Agnostics in the House To understand why Woolf struggles with her father's agnosticism in "Time Passes" ? and also why that conflict has led her to restage the Victorian crisis of belief in the middle of her novel ? we need to look into Woolf's biography. The ten years that elapse in "Time Passes" correspond to the dark period in her life that extends from her mother's death in 1895 (followed by the death of her older stepsister Stella in 1897) until her father's death in 1904.49 When Woolf reflects back on her life in "A Sketch ofthe Past" in 1940,50 she is still reluctant to return to this unhappy time: 45. Stephen attempts, in The Science of Ethics, to plot out a sociology of ethics based on the actual moral behavior that mankind has developed over the course of its evolutionary history. Metaphysics and religion, in his opinion, provide mythical explanations for moral practices, and thus obfuscate any true investigation into ethics (Annan, Leslie Stephen: His Thought and Character, p. 214). Stephen therefore tries to bar metaphysics from his study: "Starting, as I profess to do, from the scientific point of view, it follows that I have to deal. . . with facts of observation. I have . .. to consider the moral sentiments which have, as a historical fact, exercised an influence in the world, and to ask what part they play in the general process of evolution. I have, therefore, nothing to do . . . with those moral principles which are . . . deduced from transcendental considerations or from pure logic" (The Science of Ethics [Smith, Elder, 1882], reprinted by Thoemmes Antiquarian Books [1991], p. 36). 46. In his review of Sidgwick's The Methods of Ethics in 1875, Stephen writes: "If I were to make a general criticism upon Mr. Sidgwick's book, it would be that his method is too purely metaphysieal He investigates moral questions by start? ing from definitions rather than from observation; and assumes too easily ... the unity and simplicity of our conceptions of morality" (Fraser's Magazine, n.s. 11 [March 1875], p. 307). 47. Stephen writes that "ontology . . . is but the spectre of theology, the caput mortuum to which it is reduced when the attempt is made to purify it from all sensuous and anthropomorphic elements" (Science of Ethics, p. 451). He was not alone in linking religion and metaphysics in this way; Henry Maudsley's rhetorical question, "Is metaphysics anything more than supernaturalism writ fine?," indicates the prevailing opinion among naturalists, who found in agnosticism "an instrument for clearing away certain metaphysieal remnants in practical scientific research" (Turner, p. 21). 48. John Bicknell is one ofthe few critics who have noted this discrepancy between Mr. Ramsay's metaphysics and Leslie Stephen's agnosticism (p. 53), but he sees it as a fictional liberty (and inaccuracy) in Woolf's novel rather than as Woolf's strategic correction of her father's narrow agnostic views. 49. This correspondence is confirmed by the fact that after their mother died, ten years elapsed before Virginia and her siblings returned to St. Ives in the summer of 1905; see Hermione Lee, Virginia Woolf (Knopf, 1997), p. 21. Woolf is reputed to have had her first mental breakdowns during this time, one after her mother died in 1895 and another after her father died in 1904 (Lee, pp. 172-74). 50. In my argument, I will assume that echoes between Woolf's memoir and To the Lighthouse illuminate the intentions she had for her novel in the mid-1920s. There is of course the possibility (which I will not try to defend against) that the many parallels between these texts work the other way, and that Woolf is rewriting her family history in "A Sketch of the Past" to comply with the fiction she created in To the Lighthouse.</page><page sequence="13">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 13 I shrink from the years 1897-1904, the seven unhappy years. Not many lives were tor- tured and fretted and made numb with non-being as ours were then. That. .. was the legacy of those two great unnecessary blunders; those two lashes ofthe random unheed- ing, unthinking flail that brutally and pointlessly killed the two people who should have made those years normal and natural, if not "happy." (p. 136) As this quote makes clear, the darkness Woolf associated with these years is full of dismay at the materialist universe: not only was there no point in the "random" and "unthinking" deaths of her mother and Stella, but the effect of these deaths was to "numb" the household "with non- being" ? what Woolf would also call the "cotton-wool" of life. But Woolf also associated this materialist legacy of her mother's death with the burden her father now imposed upon his daugh? ters. Much as Mrs. Ramsay's death leaves Lily unprotected before Mr. Ramsay, whom she must confront herself in "The Lighthouse," Woolf tells us that her mother "left us the legacy of [Leslie Stephen's] dependence, which after her death became so harsh an imposition" ("Sketch," p. 133). It is appropriate, then, that Woolf's description of her father's behavior ? his unreasonable demands, his intense self-pitying, his explosive temper51 ? should recall the thoughtless, relentless violence of nature that nearly reclaims the house in "Time Passes": "Nessa and I were fully exposed without protection to the full blast of [their father's] strange character" (p. 107); "It was like being shut up in the same cage with a wild beast" (p. 116). The perspective in "Time Passes" may be fixed on the family's vacant summer house in the Hebrides, but the turmoil in these pages, along with the tortured stance of the restless spirits, really originates in the tumultuous feelings Woolf experienced within her family's London residence at 22 Hyde Park Gate after her mother died. Like the beach pacers, who respond to the pain of mate? rialism by attempting to split off from their bodies, Woolf describes how thoroughly disconnected her life was at this time.52 And like the Victorian restless spirits, who sought to recover the spiritual comforts lost to their childhood, Woolf ? unshielded before her father's wrath ? likely reached out to the lost deity that she associated, in her childhood, with her mother.53 In "The Window," Woolf seems to provide us with just such an exalted view of Julia Stephen when Lily, struggling to capture the inner spirit of Mrs. Ramsay, credits her with possessing an ill-defined, immeasurable value: "she imagined how in the chambers ofthe mind and heart ofthe woman ... were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out, would teach one everything" (p. 51). In her memoir, Woolf similarly recounts how her mother had seemed to her, as a child, "the whole thing .... She was keeping ... the panoply of 51. See "Sketch," p. 116; Lighthouse, p. 24. 52. Torn between the intellectual world of her father and the social world of her older stepbrother George, Woolf writes that "the division in our lives was curious. Downstairs there was pure convention; upstairs pure intellect. But there was no connection between them" ("Sketch," p. 157). Nor did Woolf find any more coherence of body and soul in her bedroom, which she describes as being sharply divided between "the living half and "the sleeping half (p. 123). In both instances, Woolf has mapped the disconnection she experienced within the house upon its physical frame; she herself admits that "the two halves" of her room "symbolized with ... intensity" "those two lives" that she led in it (p. 124). 53. Madeline Moore reads "Time Passes" as "a metaphysical story of Woolf's own experience of destruction and desola- tion after her mother's death" (The Short Season Between Two Silences [G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1984], p. 63). Marcus similarly regards it as "a lament for the dead mother. The figure of the empty house, the questioning of the meaning of life, the horror and chaos of the universe, devastation and meaninglessness, is a portrait of the dead mother's body and the daughter's appalling sense of loss" (Virginis Woolf and the Languages of Patriarchy, p. 6).</page><page sequence="14">14 Journal of Modern Literature life ? that which we all lived in common ? in being" ("Sketch," p. 83).54 Woolf also remembers her mother as being larger than life: "generalised; dispersed, omnipresent... the creator of that crowded merry world which spun so gaily in the centre of my childhood" (p. 84) and which was "shut for ever" when she died (p. 93). After this divine presence is withdrawn from her, Woolf seems to undergo the same emotional fluctuations ? between "despair" and "ecstasy" ? that afflict the sleepers through "Time Passes": she would retreat to her room at Hyde Park Gate "when father enraged me, and pace[] up and down scarlet"; but also in that very room she "could scarcely talk for happiness" when Madge Vaughan ? one of the older women Woolf worshipped after her mother's death ? "came one evening" to visit (p. 123). When the sleepers in "Time Passes" seek completion by reaching out to a companion and try to glimpse a deity hidden behind the curtain of material appearances, they are essentially echoing Woolf's attempts, from her room, to recover the lost sense of "whole" that she identified with her dead mother.55 We can now see how a family drama ? and a peculiar Oedipal triangle ? lies behind the con- test between spirit and matter in "Time Passes." A restless spirit herself, Woolf yearns to recover the sense of wholeness she associates with her mother, but her quest for spiritual completion is denied by her father, who was for Woolf "the most imminent obstacle, the most oppressive stone laid upon our vitality and its struggle to live" ("Sketch," p. 144). The unreasonable demands that Stephen placed upon his daughters, as well as the all-too-sensible restraint that he promoted in his agnostic writings, gave Woolf's spiritual aspirations their urgency ? while also making them seem hopelessly out of reach. Before seeing what difference this family drama in "Time Passes" makes to our reading of To the Lighthouse as a whole, we first need to register how it affects our understanding of Woolf's debate with the Edwardian materialists, as that will introduce a new way to relate the Bennett essays to Woolf's novel. Woolf's readers have long valued these essays for illuminating the aes? thetic she achieves in the modernist novels of her maturity; yet To the Lighthouse ? more so than Woolf's other novels ? seems to have a special relationship with them. As others have noted, To the Lighthouse is structured to fit the generational divide that Woolf installs in the Bennett essays56: the narrative trajectory echoes Woolf's distinction between Edwardians and Georgians, and the line Woolf draws down the middle of her novel ? the entirety of "Time Passes" ? seems to provide the same demarcation that Woolf's date "on or about December, 1910" offers for distin- guishing her modernist novels from those ofthe past.57 When we read the Bennett essays in light of Woolf's personal involvement in "Time Passes," the family resemblance between them and To the Lighthouse becomes only stronger: for behind Woolf's generational conflict with the Edwardians 54. Compare this with Lily's expansive view of Mrs. Ramsay in "The Window": "what could one say to her? 'I'm in love with you?' No, that was not true. 'I'm in love with this all,' waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children" (Lighthouse, p. 19). 55. John Mepham writes of this scene in Woolf's manuscript, "It is as if Virginia Woolf were drawing on her sense of her dead mother's presence as a proof that our daytime reality is an illusion" (Virginia Woolf [St Martin's Press, 1991], p. 111). 56. See Lee, p. 476; Maria DiBattista, Virginia Woolfs Major Novels: The Fables ofAnon (Yale University Press, 1980), p. 101; Alex Zwerdling, Virginia Woolf and the Real World [University of California Press, 1986], p. 193. 57. The ten years that elapse in "Time Passes" divide the book into two periods: the Victorian/Edwardian era of "The Window," in which the family circulates around Mrs. Ramsay; and the Georgian/modern era of "The Lighthouse," in which Lily ? a marginal figure in the first part ? comes into her own as the dominant narrative consciousness. If we examine the historical markers in the novel, we discover that "Time Passes" likely begins in the autumn of 1909, only months before Edward VII dies. "The Window" accordingly takes place in September 1909, toward the end of the Edwardian era, and "The Lighthouse" in September 1919.</page><page sequence="15">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 15 we can make out the shape of Woolf's family triangle. In "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" (1924), Woolf's modern artist seeks to capture a vision of an elusive female character, Mrs. Brown; but her efforts are continually blocked by overbearing men ? like Mr. Smith on the train, who physically coerces Mrs. Brown, or like Arnold Bennett, whose conventional focus on external life stifles a character's inner spirit. In Woolf's "overwhelming fascination" for Mrs. Brown ? "an old lady of unlimited capacity and infinite variety" ? we may hear her own attempt to reach out to her mother (p. 119), which To the Lighthouse later refracts through Lily's attempt to capture, in her painting, a vision of Mrs. Ramsay. And behind the male bullies in the Bennett essays ? like Mr. Smith, whom Woolf describes as a force of nature breaking into Mrs. Brown's seaside house: "I saw him blowing in, so to speak, on a windy day. He banged, he slammed" (p. 101) ? we may hear Woolf's struggle to get around the obstacle of her father, just as Lily struggles ? against Mrs. Ramsay's devotion to her husband and family, against Charles Tansley's discouraging words that "women can't paint, women can't write" {Lighthouse, p. 48) ? to bring Mrs. Ramsay into focus and com? plete her painting. We could read these many parallels as indicating the sizable debt To the Lighthouse owes to the Bennett essays from the early twenties; but the precedence that Woolf's dark decade has over all of these texts suggests another possibility. Rather than see Woolf's novel as her response to the essays, we can regard the essays as her earlier effort to work through the family triangle that she will return to in "Time Passes." If I am right about this, the Bennett essays are not just Woolf's attempt to announce her mature aesthetic, but also a first draft (of sorts) for To the Lighthouse. When Woolf appears to allude to Bennett through the empty house in "Time Passes," she is not using her novel to continue her controversy with him; rather, that controversy (which began in 1919) has always been a part of this fiction ? despite Woolf's claim that she first conceived To the Lighthouse in a "great, apparently involuntary, rush" in 1925 ("Sketch," p. 81). And since 1923, a piece of fiction ? in the form of Mrs. Brown ? has been a part of Woolf's clash with the Edward- ians. Readers have naturally regarded Woolf's portrait of Mrs. Brown as the means to support her argument with Bennett, but we also need to see her argument with Bennett as Woolf's means to produce Mrs. Brown ? along with the fiction that will become To the Lighthouse. This new outlook on the Bennett essays has the advantage of explaining why Woolf reworked them as many times as she did. In "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" (1924), Woolf says of novelists that "the study of character becomes . . . an absorbing pursuit; to impart character an obsession" (p. 97); and the uncanny resonance between these essays and her novel suggests that Woolf likely brought to her debate with Bennett the same obsessive feelings she claims she had for her dead parents before writing To the Lighthouse.5* Woolf's persistent rewriting of these essays also sug- 58. "Until I was in the forties ... the presence of my mother obsessed me_She was one ofthe invisible presences who after all play so important a part in every life_and when [To the Lighthouse] was written, I ceased to be obsessed by my mother. I no longer hear her voice; I do not see her" ("Sketch," pp. 80-81); "I used to think of him [Woolf's father, Leslie Stephen] &amp; mother daily; but writing The Lighthouse, laid them in my mind. And now he comes back sometimes, but dif- ferently. (I believe this to be true ? that I was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; &amp; writing of them was a necessary act.) He comes back now more as a contemporary" (Diary, vol. 3, p. 208). Both Samuel Hynes ("The Whole Contention Between Mr Bennett and Mrs Woolf" [1967], reprinted in Virginia Woolf: Critical Assessments, vol. 2, ed. Eleanor McNees [Helm, 1994], p. 58) and Beth Rigel Daugherty ("The Whole Contention Between Mr Bennett and Mrs Woolf, Revisited" [1983], also reprinted in Virginia Woolf: Critical Assessments, vol. 2, p. 64) recognize that Woolf's persistent attacks on Bennett appear excessive, but Hynes explains Woolf's sustained response as an unjustified expression of her personal dislike of Bennett, heightened by her snobbish sense of class superiority (pp. 54-55), whereas Daugherty ? who links Bennett to Woolf's father ? reads Woolf's attack as a justified repudiation of Bennett's sexism (p. 64).</page><page sequence="16">16 Journal of Modern Literature gests a further link with her novel: despite her multiple attempts, Woolf ultimately fails to capture her vision of Mrs. Brown in the Bennett essays, and she carries that failure and frustration with her into To the Lighthouse. In "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," Woolf tells us: "I let my Mrs. Brown slip through my fingers. I have told you nothing whatever about her" ("Bennett" [1924], p. 112), essentially blaming the Edwardians for her failure; and in "The Window," Woolf's characters fare no better: James is blocked by his father from sailing to the lighthouse ? and from receiving all of his mother's attentions, while Lily fails to grasp Mrs. Ramsay's spirit and complete her painting. In fact, the furthest Woolf gets, in the Bennett essays, to finding her way beyond this impasse is to catch a glimpse of the abandoned, ramshackle house of "Time Passes." Woolf tells us that when we ignore what the Edwardians say about Mrs. Brown and "begin to search out her real meaning for ourselves," her solidity disappears; her features crumble; the house in which she has lived so long (and a very substantial house it was) topples to the ground. She becomes a will-o'-the- wisp, a dancing light, an illumination gliding up the wall and out ofthe window.... And it is from the ruins and splinters of this tumbled mansion that the Georgian writer must somehow reconstruct a habitable dwelling-place; it is from the gleams and flashes of this flying spirit that he must create solid, living, flesh-and-blood Mrs. Brown. Sadly he must allow that the lady still escapes him. ("Bennett" [1923], pp. 387-88) Released from the prison house of Edwardian fiction, Mrs. Brown's spirit here points us toward the expressive subjectivity of Woolf's characters, freed of the material baggage of conventional description; yet her "flying spirit" is still stymied by the problem at the heart of "Time Passes": how to relate spirit and matter, body and soul. In the Bennett essays and To the Lighthouse both, the house in "Time Passes" figures as an obstacle between Woolf and the vision of her art. What happens in "Time Passes" that allows Woolf to see her way through this impasse and finish her novel is already suggested by the way we have turned the Bennett essays on their head. If we regard these essays as a sort of staging ground for To the Lighthouse, Woolf's argument with Bennett ? as an expression of her family triangle ? is as much a part of Woolf's fiction as Mrs. Brown herself. And because Mrs. Brown is who she is because Woolf needs to rescue her from Mr. Bennett, neither the character of Mr. Bennett in these essays (who is not to be mistaken for the real Arnold Bennett), nor the empty house of Edwardian fiction, can be eliminated from Woolf's evolving text. This new perspective essentially turns Woolf's argument upside down: Bennett's materialism may block Woolf's access to Mrs. Brown, but Woolf paradoxically needs this obstacle to help produce her vision. Despite how backwards this sounds (and is), the Bennett essays confirm this reversal by showing us how the male bullying of Mrs. Brown incites in Woolf the "overwhelm- ing and peculiar impression" of her character ("Bennett" [1924], p. 101).59 If Woolf is to get past 59. We can trace out this odd transference ? from male bullying to female vision ? in the way Woolf sums up her fic? tional relationship with Mrs. Brown: "Here is a character imposing itself upon another person [Woolf herself]. Here is Mrs. Brown making someone begin almost automatically to write a novel about her" (p. 102, emphasis added). What's telling here is how closely Mrs. Brown's relationship with Woolf recalls Mr. Smith's relationship with Mrs. Brown: "he had some power over her which he was exerting disagreeably.. . . Obviously against her will she was in Mr. Smith's hands" (p. 99). Between these two quotes we may witness the bullied woman becoming the object of compelling fascination for Woolf: Mr. Smith's imposing upon Mrs. Brown seems to produce the strong impression Mrs. Brown makes upon Woolf, and Mrs. Brown's will-lessness before Mr. Smith bleeds into the spontaneity of Woolf's inspiration.</page><page sequence="17">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 17 the impasse of her family triangle, she will have to reconfigure the triangle so as to connect what she has previously kept divided ? obstacle and vision. Woolf did not consciously connect Mr. Bennett (material obstacle) and Mrs. Brown (spiritual vision) in her critical essays. But I believe she makes just this link in "Time Passes" ? and takes a major step forward in resolving her family drama ? when she realizes that her spiritual vision of her mother is not blocked by her father's agnosticism but rather produced by it. I also believe Woolf arrives at this insight through the abstraction of "Time Passes," since it allows her ? much as the distance of ten years allows Lily, in "The Lighthouse" ? to step back from her personal engage? ment with her parents and view them against the cultural context of their day. What Woolf sees is that her parents' marriage, along with its peculiar dynamics, is an expression ofthe Victorian crisis of religion. Clearly, Woolf has shown us, in "The Window," that something is amiss in the Ramsay household. Confirming what she later tells us about her parents in "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf portrays Mr. Ramsay as being excessively dependent on his wife, selfish and immature in his great need for attention and comfort, and she shows Mrs. Ramsay to be over-burdened and stifled by her responsibilities to her husband and the eight children in their household. Mr. Ramsay's constant refrain early in the novel ? "some one had blundered," from Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" ? heightens the critical air that floats about his marriage. Yet Woolf's characters lack the distance they need to bring the problem into focus: Mrs. Ramsay "could not for the life of her think what" was wrong (p. 30), while William Bankes and Lily are dumbfounded by Mr. Ramsay's childish dependency and need for praise (p. 45). An explanation really emerges only in "Time Passes," where the impersonal contest between spiritualism and materialism casts Woolf's parents into critical relief while showing the probiems in the Ramsay household to be a response to her father's agnosticism. But just as we can make out the link between obstacle and vision in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," we can also discern in "The Window" the groundwork for this explanation when Woolf relates Mr. Ramsay's frustra- tion with his philosophizing to his unreasonable dependency upon his wife. Before Mr. Ramsay resumes his daunting quest to reach the letter R in the alphabet of his thinking, he fortifies himself with the sight of his wife and child;60 and when he fails to clear this philosophical hurdle, he again turns to his wife for comfort: "It was sympathy he wanted, to be assured of his genius, first of all, and then to be taken within the circle of life, warmed and soothed, to have his senses restored to him, his barrenness made fertile, and all the rooms of the house made full of life" (p. 37). By all appearances, Mr. Ramsay needs his wife here to assuage his failure at being a great philosopher.61 In fact, it is because Woolf's father is not a metaphysician at all that Mr. Ramsay asks so much of his wife. The "barrenness" Mr. Ramsay experiences is a symptom of Leslie Stephen's philosophi? cal commitment to a naturalism that unapologetically treats the world as if it were void of tran- scendent spirit;62 and the fertility Mr. Ramsay associates with his wife and home indicates how, in the agnostic household of Woolf's parents, Leslie Stephen sought from his wife what others have 60. "[T]he sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear under? standing of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind" (Lighthouse, p. 33). 61. Woolf herself encourages this reading in "A Sketch of the Past" when she writes that her father's "failure as a phi? losopher ... gnawed at him" and helps explain his dependence on women (p. 145). 62. Stephen, for instance, concludes The Science of Ethics by declining "to follow the metaphysician into his own ground." He is concerned merely with the meaning "attached to morality so long as we remain in the world of experience; and if, in the transcendental world, you can find a deeper foundation for morality, that does not concern me. I am content to build upon the solid earth" (p. 446).</page><page sequence="18">18 Journal of Modern Literature sought from religion: "she assured him, beyond the shadow of a doubt . . . [that] the house was full-If he put implicit faith in her, nothing should hurt him; however deep he buried himself or climbed high, not for a second should he find himself without her" {Lighthouse, p. 38). Mr. Ramsay's problem lies, in short, not in his doubts about his grasp of metaphysics, but rather in the scientific doubts about metaphysics and theology that make up Stephen's agnosti? cism. When Woolf's father, in The Science of Ethics, divested organized religion of its authority over ethics, he promoted the family as the basic unit responsible for upholding moral and spiritual values.63 Stephen's thinking here reflects the tenor of Victorian middle-class ideology in presum- ing a strictly gendered division of labor. But the patriarchal confinement of women to the domestic sphere does not adequately explain the spiritual authority Julia Stephen exercised in their house? hold.64 Domesticity essentially replaced religion for Stephen; and he made this exchange explicit when he wrote to Julia Duckworth in anticipation of their marriage: "I have not got any Saints and you must not be angry if I put you in the place where my Saints ought to be."65 In "Professions for Women" (1931), Woolf would later write about the "angel in the house" that she had clearly modeled upon her mother; but her portrait of Mrs. Ramsay in To the Lighthouse indicates that she had already achieved enough distance from her mother to regard her "angelic" qualities as exemplifying a generic Victorian role. As the angel, her mother ? like any respectable Victorian housewife ? oversaw the moral well being of the family; but in the secular sphere of their home, she also filled the hole left by the retreat of god. Once we share Woolf's insight that her mother was the spiritual center of her family precisely because their household was agnostic, we can also discern how agnosticism connects her father's materialism and her mother's spirituality ? the two poles of her family universe that Woolf held apart after her mother's death. This dramatically revises how we view the apparent opposition between Mr. Ramsay's philosophy and Mrs. Ramsay's domesticity in the first part of Woolf's novel. When Mrs. Ramsay sits indoors reading the fairy tale of "The Fisherman and His Wife" to James {Lighthouse, p. 42), Mr. Ramsay is outside, striding the shore, alone; and there he confronts again, without support or consolation, the "barrenness" he recoiled from earlier: 63. Annan says that Stephen, in The Science of Ethics, "founds the moral health of society upon the institution of the family" (Leslie Stephen: His Thought and Character, p. 118). Stephen himself writes that "the true school of morality is the family. . . . The moral quality of every man is determined to a very great extent in his infancy. We learn our morality, not from books and lessons, but in the nursery, or at our mother's knee_There it is that the core of character is fixed, and that the deepest organic qualities are permanently stamped upon us-The purity ofthe domestic relations is the essential guarantee for a most important class of virtues-The love ofa mother is the typical and central virtue of which all others seem to be faint reflections" (Science of Ethics, pp. 344-45). 64. Walter Houghton (The Victorian Frame ofMind: 1830-1870 [Yale University Press, 1957]) notes how "the Indus? trial Revolution created a psychological and amoral atmosphere for which an idealized home with its high priestess offered a compensating sense of humanity and moral direction" but it was not only "the hard competitive world of business" but also "the pressure of intellection and doubt" that fueled Coventry Patmore's popular ideal ofthe household "angel" (p. 393): "the sanctification of love and woman could rescue a worried Victorian from sliding into disbelief by reassuring him of a divine world, manifested here in the flesh, so to speak" (p. 392), and "many Victorians, consciously or otherwise, were able to quiet their anxious doubts by finding an angel in the house" (p. 393). Responding to Houghton, Nina Auerbach (Woman and the Demon [Harvard University Press, 1982]) suggests that the household angel also provided a religious substitute for those confirmed in their doubts, noting the angel's "iconoclastic power": "this apparently quiescent figure is an implicit revolt against the patriarchal imagery of official Christianity" (p. 73). For an example, Auerbach turns to Woolf's hereti- cal father: "In contrast to official precept, the domestic angel Leslie Stephen persisted in worshipping is pressed into no hierarchical order, but rises alone, free from any reigning divine 'appointment'" (pp. 73-74). As the angel in Stephen's agnostic household, "Julia's lone independence of God unites her reverential husband with a powerful community of hereti- cal Victorian acolytes" (p. 74). 65. Sir Leslie Stephen's Mausoleum Book (Clarendon Press, 1977), p. 53.</page><page sequence="19">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 19 It was his power, his gift, suddenly to shed all superfluities, to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer, even physically, yet lost none of his intensity of mind, and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance, how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on. . . . he kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision.... (p. 44) '"But the father of eight children,'" he goes on, breaking his philosophical concentration, "has no choice." Muttering half aloud, so he broke off, turned, sighed, raised his eyes, sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy, filled his pipe. He turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate . . . which, had he been able to con- template it fixedly might have led to something; and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over. (p. 44) Mr. Ramsay installs a considerable barrier here between the rigors of his agnostic philosophiz- ing ? where he faces alone the limits of human knowledge and entertains no illusory vision of the hereafter ? and the comforts of his domestic life; and when he turns away from his thinking and toward his wife, he further underscores their opposition by thinking that he could have been a great philosopher if he had not had to care for his large family. However, the view of Mr. Ramsay we later get in "Time Passes" ? where he again appears alone, the night after Mrs. Ramsay has died ? suggests otherwise. Stricken with apparent grief, Mr. Ramsay reaches out to his dead wife: "[Mr. Ramsay, stumbling along a passage one dark morning, stretched his arms out, but Mrs. Ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before, his arms, though stretched out, remained empty]" (p. 128). This passage appears only moments after the sleepers, striding the shore, have tried to pull divinity out from behind the curtain of appearances. The juxtaposition clearly aligns Mr. Ramsay with them: so in reaching out for his dead wife he is also ? perhaps a sleepwalker himself here ? standing before the water with the other restless spirits who search the shore for consolation, looking for the "ghostly confidante" who will hold his hand and share his distress. This new view of Mr. Ramsay reveals him to be (as Bankes had suspected) "a bit of a hypo- crite" (p. 46): for Mr. Ramsay cannot after all sustain his agnostic courage without the consolation afforded him by his wife. That consolation ? far from interfering with his thinking ? ironically lends him the strength he needs, when alone, to view the world without illusion. Mr. Ramsay may think that he "luxuriated in no vision" in his lonely philosophical contemplation in "The Window," but our amended view of him in "Time Passes" ? where he resumes his agnostic stance on shore, but now appears to be reaching out toward his wife ? reveals how a religious impulse, unbeknownst to him, undergirds his agnostic meditation. "Time Passes" reveals, in short, that Mr. Ramsay's agnostic is really a restless spirit. Like the sleepers at the start of "Time Passes," Mr. Ramsay aspires in "The Window" to "shed all superfluities" and release his philosophizing mind from the physical limits of his body. And what he endeavors to reach through this contem? plation ? the letter R that lies forever beyond his grasp ? is what the sleepers (and, later, Mr. Ramsay himself) struggle to reach in "Time Passes": the Great Companion. This spirit appears in "The Window" but takes the form ofthe domestic angel at Mr. Ramsay's back, whose comforts he disparages in his blindness.</page><page sequence="20">20 Journal of Modern Literature Woolf was clearly targeting her father when she developed this picture of Mr. Ramsay's self- deception in her novel, for the heroic agnostic stance Mr. Ramsay assumes on shore in "The Window" is the very pose her father strikes in "Dreams and Realities" (1878), another essay that Stephen included in his 1893 collection An Agnostic's Apology and Other Essays.66 Stephen tells us that he "would rather face the inevitab[ility of death] with open eyes" than act like the Apostle Paul who "is desperately trying to shirk the inevitable and at best resembles the weak comfort- ers who try to cover up the terrible reality under a veil of well-meant fiction" (pp. 91-92). Mr. Ramsay hardly makes good on Stephen's manly resolve, for he has his eyes closed in this scene to the spiritual underpinnings of his open-eyed agnosticism. Likewise, in "What Is Materialism?" Leslie Stephen disavows any metaphysical concern about the hereafter by proclaiming that "The true question is, What are we? not How long will any one of us last?" (p. 165). Yet Woolf turns these words against him when she locates the source of Mr. Ramsay's dependency in his obses- sive worries about the longevity of his writings and fame (Lighthouse, pp. 35, 107). Mr. Ramsay cannot practice what Leslie Stephen preaches. And Mr. Ramsay's hypocrisy likely originates in the narrowness and lack of self-awareness that Woolf associated with her father's agnostic beliefs: ironically, the intellectual limits Stephen heeded in his agnostic writings may have blinded him (if Woolf is right) to the emotional needs that the practice of agnosticism exacted from him. Never? theless, it is this very hypocrisy ? the way Woolf's agnostic father remained beholden to religion through his shameful reliance upon his wife ? that ultimately allows her to rehabilitate Stephen's agnosticism. Woolf's critique of her father's blindness suggests how he was never able to solve the problem that Religion ? or the elusive letter R ? represented in his materialist thinking.67 But by turning Mr. Ramsay into a restless spirit, Woolf opens him to spirituality by projecting onto her father her own metaphysical impulse to reach out to her dead mother.68 Now when Mr. Ramsay reaches past Q, he is also reaching out for something beyond the empirical limits of Stephen's narrow agnosticism. By adding a picture of Mr. Ramsay's spiritual restlessness [in brackets] to the final version of "Time Passes," Woolf revealed something in "The Window" that we otherwise have difficulty seeing: Mrs. Ramsay's angel in the house is profoundly connected to Mr. Ramsay's agnostic phi- losophizing on shore. Remarkably, Woolf again foregrounded this link between angel and agnostic when, in her final draft, she decided to let Mrs. Ramsay read "The Fisherman and His Wife" to James.69 We know that Woolf must have associated this tale with her father and with the issues of agnosticism and religion he discussed in "What Is Materialism?" It is just this materialist perspec? tive, so clear in "Time Passes," that the story brings to the Ramsay marriage ? though Woolf, who reproduces only fragments of the tale in "The Window," leaves it to us to flesh out. In the fairy 66. Mr. Ramsay's agnosticism in this scene is made even clearer in Woolf's manuscript, where he sounds just like Leslie Stephen: "we have to face the fact of our ignorance; fact which he was used to meeting . . . of human ignorance &amp; our powerlessness in the face ofthe greatest problems of life" (Holograph, p. 81). 67. Annan also contends that Stephen's narrow agnosticism reveals that he never really understood religion (Godless Victorian, pp. 256-57). 68. Woolf's memoir confirms that she is drawing her father closer to herself in this scene. Of the night her mother died, Woolf writes: "My father staggered from the bedroom. ... I stretched out my arms to stop him, but he brushed past me, crying out something I could not catch; distraught" ("Sketch," p. 91). In "Time Passes," Woolf has given her fictional father her own gesture of reaching out for comfort in mourning. 69. When Woolf composed the first draft of "The Window" in the winter and spring of 1926, she had Mrs. Ramsay read to James another fairy tale, a version of "The Three Dwarfs" or "The Three Bears" (Holograph, pp. 73, 96). Woolf clearly had not yet decided what story to use, nor had she reproduced in her novel the text of any fairy tale.</page><page sequence="21">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 21 tale, a poor fisherman and his wife have their fortunes altered when he catches a magical flounder that can grant him whatever he wishes. The husband wants nothing; but the wife, discontent with the narrow constraints of their life, makes her husband go to the shore ? day after day ? so the flounder may grant her wish for ever greater wealth and authority. The wife rises in stature to king, emperor, and pope ? receiving an ever larger residence at each turn; but when she finally wishes to be god, she loses everything, and she and her husband are east back into their wretched hovel.70 This tale clearly comments on the Ramsays, since the fairy tale couple exactly mirrors their loca- tion in this scene: the husband is outside, striding the shore, while the wife remains indoors, at home. But what the story foregrounds for us is how the Ramsays together have sought, in their household, to displace god with materialism. Mrs. Ramsay is surely "guilty" of the grievous sin that all of the wife's desires lead up to: as the angel in the house, she has effectively replaced god. And the spiritual power Mrs. Ramsay achieves, as a household deity, is itself a measure of increas? ing materialism ? something the tale expresses by representing the wife's quest for the godhead in terms of her presiding over a series of ever more sumptuous residences. It is hard to imagine that Woolf, having railed against Edwardian materialism in terms of houses, was not drawn to this story for the materialism its many houses conveyed. Woolf certainly does not share the fairy tale's interest in condemning the couple for their impiety. But she does want to understand the effect that the end of religion had upon moral rela? tions in her parents' household, and the eventual fall of the fairy tale couple contributes to her judgment that her family was ill served by her father's narrow agnosticism. Lily wonders how Mr. Ramsay could be "the most sincere of men" while also "tyrannical" and "unjust" (p. 46); and Woolf struggled as well to make sense of her father's glaring hypocrisy: how he could present speeches in public to ethical societies while behaving at home in ways that can only be described as immoral.71 Stephen's agnosticism, "Time Passes" suggests, enabled this hypocrisy, in so far as the spiritualization of the secular in their home warped human identities and strained family relations. If Stephen looked to his wife (and then to his daughters) for the assurances that others sought from religion, he was destined to be disappointed. And his wife, reified into a deity, could hardly live up to immortal standards. Lily laughs "at the thought of Mrs. Ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand" {Lighthouse, p. 50); and Mrs. Ramsay reveals the steep toil that "the rapture of successful creation" exacts from her: "the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself, so that she had only strength enough to move her finger" (p. 38). By linking the agnostic and the angel in her parents' home, Woolf diagnosed her father's excessive reliance upon his wife as his misguided attempt to have her substitute for religion. The problem in the Ramsay marriage is that Mr. Ramsay pretends he can stand apart from the support of religion, while Mrs. Ramsay pretends she can give him what he needs. Woolf's insight, how? ever, does not simply alter how she views her parents' marriage; it dramatically affects as well her quest to recover her mother's spirit. Woolf initially looked to her mother as a divine figure poised against her father's materialism, but she can now see that this spiritual being is the very angel her 70. Jacob Grimm, Tales from the Brothers Grimm (F. Etchells &amp; H. Macdonald, 1930), pp. 90-101. 71. According to Woolf, her father acted as though he "was exempt, because of his genius, from the laws of good society" ("Sketch," p. 110); "he was somehow not bound by the laws of ordinary people" (p. 111). Mrs. Ramsay similarly describes as "an outrage of human decency" her husband's tendency "[t]o pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people's feelings, to rend the thin veils of civilisation so wantonly, so brutally" (Lighthouse, p. 32).</page><page sequence="22">22 Journal of Modern Literature father worshipped, and that her mother's true character remains immured within the walls of her powerful household role: "So boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by" (Lighthouse, p. 38).72 In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf acknowledges how her mother's beauty and angelic stature made it difficult to know Julia Stephen as an individual: the family had lived "so completely in her [mother's] atmosphere that one never got far enough away from her to see her as a person" (p. 83), while she also complains that her memory of her mother is "rubbed out and featureless . . . dominated by the beauty of her own face" (p. 85). If Lily is to capture Mrs. Ramsay's character in her painting, it now appears that she will have to free it from the religious function Mrs. Ramsay has served in the Ramsay household. This means that it is no longer enough (or even necessary) for her ? or Woolf ? to circumvent the external obstacle of the father's materialism; each needs instead to demystify her own vision of the mother. III: Mrs. McNab and Consolation for Life's Pain Woolf stood squarely against her father when she first traced the probiems in her family back to the Victorian crisis of religion: she aligned herself with the metaphysical arguments Leslie Ste? phen opposed, and she sought ? as the restless searchers did in the Metaphysical Society and the Society for Psychical Research ? to return spirit to the world after naturalism had tried to drive it out. However, as time passed, Woolf's investigation seems to have drawn her increasingly into her father's footsteps: she not only resuscitated the Victorian conflicts Stephen had debated, but with her depiction of the Ramsays, Woolf adopted her father's quest of imagining the world apart from the security given by a belief in god. If the Ramsay household reveals what went wrong in her parents' marriage, it remained for Woolf to imagine how to put things right ? to resolve, in the fictional world of her characters, the proper relations between spirit and matter. As we have seen, Woolf started this process of revision in "The Window" when she used the link between agnostic and angel to refashion Leslie Stephen's narrow agnostic into Mr. Ramsay's restless spirit. To complete that process, she would have to re-envision her mother as well ? to reach beyond her memories of Julia Stephen as a transcendent spirit and see her character as she truly was. Situated at the end of her parents' actual lives, "Time Passes" marks Woolf's struggle to rehabilitate both parents; in these pages, Woolf continues Mr. Ramsay's quest for R by reaching beyond the limits of historical fact to build her parents' house anew. Oddly enough, the pivotal figure Woolf summons to bring these changes about is the lowly charwoman, Mrs. McNab. We ought to be wary of Woolf's reliance upon Mrs. McNab. After all, Woolf calls upon her ? like any maid ? to set right the disorder left in "The Window" after the family has gone, only to usher her off stage once the job is done. Not surprisingly, readers have found Woolf's por? trait of this elderly charwoman to be embarrassing and exploitative.73 If Mrs. McNab's restoring 72. The materialism in "The Fisherman and His Wife" also helps us see this: however much material power the fisher- man's wife accumulates, her identity remains tied up with her residence, which she never leaves throughout the tale. Mrs. Ramsay, as the angel, is no less a slave in the home she rules. As Woolf writes in her memoir about her mother's genera? tion, "woman ... though gilt with an angelic surface [was also] the slave" ("Sketch," p. 145), and Leslie Stephen expected women in his family to be "part slave, part angel" (p. 146). 73. Mary Lou Emery claims, for instance, that Woolf secures Lily's place as a new woman in "The Lighthouse" by steal- ing Mrs. McNab's labor and displacing onto her the stigma of the Other ('"Robbed of Meaning': The Work at the Center of To the Lighthouse" Modern Fiction Studies 38:1 [Spring 1992], pp. 220, 226). Tratner reads Mrs. McNab's appearance</page><page sequence="23">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 23 the house symbolically makes "civilization" possible again, she herself stands outside the circle ofthe civilized: Woolf describes her as "not highly conscious" (Lighthouse, p. 139), she lives by mechanical routine, and she has no clear insights into life. As a representative of the loyal lower orders, Mrs. McNab is only dehumanized by Woolf's apparent efforts to celebrate her importance to the Ramsays. Yet if we can look past our indignation, we can also see that Mrs. McNab does real theoretical work in "Time Passes" as the subject of religious and social controversy. Once again, Woolf's first draft is illuminating, for our first introduction to Mrs. McNab there comes not in "Time Passes" but during the dinner party in "The Window," when the conversation at the table turns to "the decay of religious belief (Holograph, p. 152). Mrs. Ramsay says, "They are so much worse off," only to stop herself when she realizes that "instead of thinking of Betty McNab &amp; Ellie Kennedy she thought of 'them', the poor, who were ... 'happy' or miserable, in blocks." We can make out the larger argument for which Mrs. McNab here was originally conceived (by both Woolf and Mrs. Ramsay) as a generic example. If well-to-do people like the Ramsays can hardly bear the pain and injustice of life without resorting to the solace of religion, how can the poor, who have real grievances and burdens to shoulder?74 Even more troubling to the middle classes were the social consequences of massive disbelief: once deprived of a religion's rewards and threats, would the lower orders continue to obey moral dictates or would they lapse into anarchic self-interest? Leslie's brother Fitzjames certainly believed "the destruction of religion would ... invoke a moral revolution," and that a strong state was needed in the wake of religion to enforce civility.75 Equally pessimistic was Bertha Lathbury, who ? writing in the Nineteenth Century, in 1880 ? sought to dissuade women from becoming agnostics for just these reasons: "What gain will it be to the poor to know and realise fully that their lot is pain and discomfort in this world, and that this world is the only one? How will certain hard questions about justice and equality be answered? . . . What has the Agnostic to offer in compensation?"76 Mrs. McNab could well be the target of Lathbury's questions. She knows her lot in life is "one long sorrow and trouble" (Lighthouse, p. 130). She has felt oppression as "a mat for King and Kaiser" (Typescript, p. 284), and in her daily labors she struggles against the relentless decay of both the house and her seventy-year-old body. There is also no reward for her in sight. Though she is paid by the Ramsays, Mrs. McNab does not receive news, or thanks, or direction from them (Lighthouse, p. 136). And with no religious beliefs to fall back on, she is also beyond communicat? ing with any higher being. Woolf underscores this last point by contrasting Mrs. McNab with the restless spirits on shore: Walking the beach the mystic, the visionary, were possessed of intervals of comprehen- sion.... But Mrs. McNab was none of these. She was no skeleton lover, who voluntarily surrenders and makes abstract and reduces the multiplicity of the world to unity and its volume and anguish to one voice piping clear and sweet an unmistakable message. . . . Mrs. McNab continued to drink and gossip as before. (Typescript, pp. 284-85) in "Time Passes" as bringing into the open what the nineteenth-century psyche repressed ? the barbarous masses, the unconscious; much as the primitive served as a touchstone for revitalizing modern art, Mrs. McNab serves in Woolf's novel to "release the vision inside Lily" (p. 58). 74. In 1922, in "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street," Woolf gives this opinion to Clarissa Dalloway, who expresses a personal disbelief in god but thinks that the shop girl serving her "would be much more unhappy if she didn't believe" (The Com? plete Shorter Fiction of Virginia Woolf, ed. Susan Dick [Harcourt Brace, 1980], p. 158). 75. "A Modern 'Symposium,'" p. 332; Annan, Godless Victorian, pp. 273-76. 76.

It is appropriate, then, that the main question Woolf asks of Mrs. McNab, as she labors to maintain the house, is what consolation she can possibly have for all her pain and effort: Was it then that she had her consolations, when, with the breeze in the west and the clouds white in the sun she stood at her cottage door? For what reason did there twine about her dirge this incorrigible hope? and why, with no gift to bestow and no gift to take did she yet prefer to live; singing, [and] dusting?

(Typescript, p. 284) We can almost see Woolf struggling here over Lathbury's question: What does agnosticism have to offer Mrs. McNab, who is so in need of consolation? But we can also see in Woolf's questions that Mrs. McNab does have consolations, despite her lack of religious faith. The only real question is how this is possible. Readers of Woolf's novel will think it unlikely that Mrs. McNab has anything to do with Mr. Ramsay; yet the two are clearly linked by the question of where we find consolation in the wake of religion. And the issue of consolation returns Woolf once more to her father's writings ? most notably Stephen's "An Agnostic's Apology." Written in 1876 in response to the grief he suffered upon losing his first wife, Stephen probes in this essay the very issues Woolf addresses with Mrs. McNab ? the need to be consoled for life's pain, the prospect of solace without religion. Despite his grief, Stephen defends his agnosticism against the temptation to yield to the visionary alter? native of gnosticism. He tells us that gnostics willfully simplify the world, seeking an anodyne for their pain by insisting "the harmony beneath the discords is a reality and not a dream" (p. 3), whereas agnostics like himself "have felt the weariness and pain of all 'this unintelligible world'" but "have not been able to escape into any mystic rapture" (pp. 36-37). We have seen how Woolf, with her ironic portrait of Mr. Ramsay in "The Window," was restless with this kind of manly agnostic bravado; but now she seems to have found, in Mrs. McNab, a way to redeem it ? for she defends Mrs. McNab in just these terms, contrasting her to the sleepers whose mystical visions reduce the world ? as Stephens' gnostics do ? to an abstract harmony.77 Just as Leslie Stephen asserted, Mrs. McNab has her consolations without believing in the hereafter; and her experience within the empty house is somehow more profound than the experience of the restless spirits pacing the beach: Her message to a world now beginning to break into the voluntary and irrepressible loveliness of spring was transmitted by the lurch of her body and the leer of her smile and in them no less than in the bleat of lamb and the bud of cowslip were the broken 77. Stephen's gnostics, though "overpowered ... by the sight of pain, folly, and helplessness ... are yet enabled to hear at times a whisper that all is well, to trust to it as coming from the most authentic source, and to know that only the temporary bars of sense prevent us from recognising with certainty that the harmony beneath the discords is a reality and not a dream" ("Apology," pp. 2-3, emphasis added). Woolf's sleepers similarly received "as the evenings lengthened ... the strangest imaginations, the most authentic beckonings, in the sunset, on the moonlit evenings. . . . that good triumphs, happiness prevails, order rules" (Typescript, p. 285, emphasis added).</page><page sequence="25">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 25 syllables of a revelation more confused but more profound (could one have read it) then [sic] any accorded to solitary watchers, pacing the beach at midnight, and receiving as they stirred the pool, revelations of an extraordinary kind. (Typescript, p. 285) This is a pivotal moment in Woolf's text. By granting Mrs. McNab a revelation from within the house that surpasses that of the visionaries on shore, Woolf has stepped to one side of her earlier identification with the restless spirits. She also has reversed her opposition to her father's mate? rialism. Mrs. McNab's presence in "Time Passes" signals how Woolf ? building on her insight linking obstacle to vision, and then following her father's lead ? has written her own "agnostic's apology" into the heart of To the Lighthouse. Once the site of materialist obscurity, the empty house has been renovated as the site of revelation. We can begin to understand how Mrs. McNab orchestrates this reversal by noting that her mes? sage to the world, "a revelation more confused but more profound (could one have read it). . . ," coincides with the perspective of the empty house itself: "Listening (had there been anyone to listen) from the upper rooms of the empty house only gigantic chaos streaked with lightning could have been heard tumbling and tossing" (Typescript, p. 287). Woolf's parenthetical exclusion of a perceiving subject in these two sentences (which appear only pages apart in "Time Passes") indicates how both revelations lie just beyond our grasp: Mrs. McNab's message is inscrutable, the sound of chaos in the house ? inaudible. Each revelation overrides the empirical limits that Stephen observed in his agnostic assertions; "an object without a subject," he might remind his daughter, "is a meaningless phrase" ("Materialism," p. 135). Woolf registers the merit of this objection with her parenthetical qualification to each sentence; but this concession to common sense does not stop her from stepping into the metaphysical breach ? even as her one sentence runs roughshod over the absence of the perceiving subject ("listening . . . only gigantic chaos . . . could have been heard"). Abiding beyond the evidence of our senses, Mrs. McNab and the empty house together allow Woolf to travel beyond the impasse in Mr. Ramsay's philosophy and to real- ize, in "Time Passes," his vision of the "kitchen table ... when you're not there." We might think Mrs. McNab's revelation, in pressing beyond the narrow limits of our experi? ence, would open up into the spiritual hereafter; but Woolf's clear contrast of Mrs. McNab to the gnostics shows us that her metaphysical revelation lies instead within the here and now. Rather than dispense with her father's materialism, Woolf is actually rehabilitating it. Mrs. McNab's obscure message to us ?that revelation is immanent in the world, not transcendent ? builds upon Woolf's discovery that her mother, the angel, is a response to agnosticism; if Woolf is to locate the spirit she associated with her mother, she is going to have to look for her not out at sea, but within the empty house of her father's materialism. Mrs. McNab's revelation inside the house (which is identical to the revelation of the empty house) thus inverts the coordinates of spiritualist rhetoric: whereas materialism had been the veil blocking Woolf's path to spiritual vision, spiritualism has now become the veil, and what lies beyond is the reality of the world that she can dimly make out with the help of materialism. The gnostic vision of a spiritual "beyond" is ? just as Stephen claimed in "An Agnostic's Apology" ? a comforting extension of our lives onto the universe. And to grasp the world beyond ourselves, we must turn to the sweeping evo? lutionary view of nature that Woolf installs in "Time Passes." This outlook reveals how even the "feather-light fingers" of night air are powerful enough, over time, to destroy the house and any other human construct (Lighthouse, p. 126). It offers Woolf the "sense of [her] own strange-</page><page sequence="26">26 Journal of Modern Literature ness . . . of the infinite oddity of the human position" that she gets from her revelation in Russell Square.78 We now know why Woolf made Mrs. McNab the way she is. As the living embodiment of the empty house in which she labors, Mrs. McNab is herself an expression of materialism. The inversion of Mrs. Brown, she is not the spirit but rather the matter we live by.79 Defined against the disembodied sleepers, she is also a body lacking an immortal soul ? the very body Woolf's sleep? ers have sought to slough off in their quest for spiritual completion ? and the resurgent reality of the material world, full of pain and injustice, that they have struggled to repress with their gnostic faith. Whatever revelation Mrs. McNab conveys comes not from the heavens above, but rather is to be read off of her body, through "the lurch of her body and the leer of her smile," which transmit "the loveliness of spring ... no less than ... the bleat of lamb and the bud of cowslip." More animal than human, Mrs. McNab conveys the wonder of evolutionary naturalism, which deprives the uni? verse of its human center by placing us on a continuum with all other beings. Mrs. McNab may be barely conscious, but she needs to be so if she is to navigate the straits of Mr. Ramsay's philosophy; described as "the voice of witlessness" ? "she was witless, she knew it" (p. 130) ? Mrs. McNab fulfills Woolf's contradictory agenda of conveying a subject beyond the reaches of subjectivity. Only if she is emptied of mind can she deliver us a view of the world unseen by any person ? the real world stripped of the social and theological constructions we have imposed upon it. With Mrs. McNab's message to the world, Woolf has apparently found ? in the center of her novel ? some middle ground between spirit and matter, metaphysics and naturalism.80 We can find a clearer expression of this message ? and better understand how Woolf has shifted her sym- pathies from gnosticism to agnosticism ? by looking at her essay "On Being 111," which she com? posed in November 1925 when an extended illness stopped her for months from working on her novel. In this essay, Woolf assumes the perspective of the bed-ridden recumbent in order to explore the cultural value of pain ? a subject, she says, that has always been repressed from serious study. Woolf's main point is to acknowledge the claims that the body in pain has upon the spirit; not only does our outlook depend on whether we are healthy or not, but pain itself may reveal the truth of the world unnoticed when we are healthy: Directly the bed is called for . . . we cease to be soldiers in the army of the upright. . . . We float with the sticks on the stream; helter skelter with the dead leaves on the lawn, irresponsible and disinterested and able, perhaps for the first time for years, to look round . . . to look, for example, at the sky. . . . [which] is discovered to be something so different. . . that really it is a little shocking. This then has been going on all the time 78. Diary, vol. 3, p. 62. 79. Woolf closes "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" (1924) by identifying Mrs. Brown as "the spirit we live by, life itself" (P-119). 80. With The Phantom Table, Ann Banfield has recently written a very impressive book about just this place in Woolf's fiction; she argues that Woolf's world "when you're not there" has its counterpart in Bertrand Russell's idea of un-sensed sensibilia, "phantom 'solid objects'" which can be described but not observed (p. 49). Banfield's book explores the impact that the thinking of Woolf's contemporaries (Russell's logical positivism, Fry's post-impressionism) had upon her fiction. I am arguing, on the other hand, that Woolf looked backwards ? at the Victorian contest between spiritualism and mate? rialism ? when she created the space of the phantom table in her fiction. We also disagree about the nature of this space, since I would claim that it never gets beyond being a contradiction. But to the extent that our views coincide, my essay may be read as demonstrating the intensely personal struggle Woolf had to wage with her father's materialism in order to embrace finally the philosophy of her Cambridge and London colleagues ? and see her father "more as a contemporary" (see footnote 58).</page><page sequence="27">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 27 without our knowing it! ? this incessant making up of shapes and casting them down, this buffeting of clouds together . . . this endless activity . . . has been left to work its will year in year out.81 What Woolf discovers from bed ? and from her bodily suffering ? is the point of view of the empty house, of the world "when you're not there."82 This is what we see in "Time Passes" when things that remained in the background in "The Window" ? furniture, servants like Mrs. McNab: all that Woolf had earlier repressed so she might better delve into her characters' minds ? re- surface as things in themselves. It is also what Woolf sees, in this essay, when she observes ? as though for the first time ? the sky that, in normal circumstances, serves merely as "a background for man, signify[ing] wet weather or fine" (p. 321). And it is what she sees when she views a rose not as the symbolic counterpart of our emotions, but simply as a part of nature: as "it stands, still and steady, throughout an entire afternoon in the earth" (p. 322). These are all revelations afforded by naturalism. Is it any wonder, then, that Woolf, in this recumbent perspective, also achieves Mrs. McNab's consolation? Suggesting that we may "learn virtue from plants," Woolf writes: It is in their indifference that they are comforting. That snowfield of the mind, where man has not trodden, is visited by the cloud, kissed by the failing petal, as, in another sphere, it is the great artists, the Miltons, the Popes, who console, not by their thought of us, but by their forgetfulness. (p. 322) The comfort Woolf describes here comes not from finding her counterpart in nature, but rather from finding that the natural world is wholly unconcerned with her. This idea controverts conven? tional reasoning, which tells us that only religion can relieve our grief in the face of the world's indifference. But Woolf is counter-intuitive here in just the way her father was when he insisted that agnosticism, and not religion, brought him comfort after his wife's death. Years later, in "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf will again affirm the spiritual consolations of materialism when she describes how she has come to accept pain as a necessary precursor to her revelatory "moments of being": [M]any of these exceptional moments brought with them a peculiar horror and a physi? cal collapse; they seemed dominant; myself passive. . . . though I still have the pecu- liarity that I receive these sudden shocks, they are now always welcome; after the first surprise, I always feel instantly that they are particularly valuable. And so I go on to suppose that the shock-receiving capacity is what makes me a writer_I feel that I have had a blow; but it is not, as I thought as a child, simply a blow from an enemy hidden behind the cotton wool of daily life; it is or will become a revelation of some order; it is a token of some real thing behind appearances; and I make it real by putting it into words. It is only by putting it into words that I make it whole; this wholeness means that it has lost its power to hurt me; it gives me . . . a great delight to put the severed parts together. (p. 72) 81. "On Being 111" (1926), The Essays of Virginia Woolf, vol. 4, p. 321. 82. Woolf confirms this when she goes on to write, "One should not let this gigantic cinema play perpetually to an empty house" ("On Being 111," p. 321).</page><page sequence="28">28 Journal of Modern Literature Woolf understands here what she did not yet understand in the Bennett essays ? that the appar? ent obstacle of materialism is the painful trigger for her visionary "moments of being." This also happens to be Mrs. McNab's message to the world, which Woolf has since learned to read: the very things that seem to frustrate vision ? materialism, darkness, blockage, non-being, pain ? are actually essential to producing the revelation Woolf now associates with the sense of the whole. Woolf elaborates on this idea when she recalls how, as a child at St. Ives, she had a revelation about a flower's relationship to the earth: "it seemed suddenly plain that the flower itself was a part ofthe earth_It was a thought I put away as being likely to be very useful to me later.... When I said about the flower That is the whole,' I felt that I had made a discovery" ("Sketch," p. 71). This dis? covery is what Woolf comes back to in To the Lighthouse when she affirms, through Mrs. McNab, the importance of materialism to her vision. As the unconscious part of life, the matter that gnos? tics repress in their desire to secure the independent existence of spirit, Mrs. McNab supplies (as it were) the materialist soil for Woolf's spiritual bloom. Only by affirming her does Woolf see the flower whole. And only by sublimating the "blow from an enemy" ? the "formidable ancient enemy" that Lily confronts whenever she paints {Lighthouse, p. 158), but also the "two lashes of the random ... flail" that killed Julia and Stella, and the "full blast" of Leslie Stephen's emotional bullying ("Sketch," pp. 136,107) ? may Woolf give purpose to her losses and make herself whole. At last bridging the painful disconnection between body and soul that she structured into "Time Passes," Woolf may now experience the "delight" of putting "the severed parts together." Before Woolf drafted To the Lighthouse, she worried that "the flight of time" in the middle would "break [the] unity in my design"; but after finishing the novel, she told Roger Fry that "one has to have a central line down the middle of the book to hold the design together."83 Between these two moments, Woolf reversed her feelings about materialism; the apparent obstacle to her vision had since become the vehicle. It seems appropriate, then, that the fairy tale that Woolf associated with materialism, and that she used in "The Window" to diagnose the problem agnosti? cism posed in her parents' household, should also supply her with the means in "Time Passes" for imaginatively refiguring the Ramsay marriage. As a sort of dream between the waking reality of "The Window" and "The Lighthouse," the whole of "Time Passes" is a loose rewriting of "The Fisherman and His Wife." In place of the fairy tale's triad of fisherman, flounder, and wife, Woolf gives us: the restless spirits, who escape the house to wander the beach; the divinity at the shore, to whom the restless spirits reach out for completion; and Mrs. McNab, who remains behind in the obscurity of the house.84 However, in this modern updating of the tale, Mrs. McNab is not just one character of three, but combines, within herself, the distinguishing features of all three roles. She is most obviously aligned with the fisherman's wife, as both women have suffered poverty within the home; but Woolf's great effort in "Time Passes" has been to show that Mrs. McNab 83. Diary, vol. 3, p. 36; Letters, vol. 3, p. 385. 84. Lest this sort of translation sound outlandish, we should recognize the other elements ofthe fairy tale that Woolf has built into the middle section of her novel: both Mrs. McNab and the fisherman's wife live in a cottage by the sea; the ques? tion of consolation or compensation informs both texts, since both women have endured hardship and poverty; Mrs. McNab has suffered as "a mat for King and Kaiser," whereas the fisherman's wife, to ease her dissatisfaction, becomes both king and kaiser ("emperor" in the English translation of the tale), as well as pope, on her way to the godhead; and the violent natural imagery that Woolf uses in "Time Passes" echoes that found in the fairy tale: Woolf writes, for instance, that "there was apurplish stain upon the bland surface of the sea as if something had boiled and bled, invisibly, beneath" (Lighthouse, pp. 133-34, emphasis added), while in the translation of the tale that Woolf cites in "The Window" the wounded flounder "leav[es] a long streak of blood behind him," the water soon turns "quite purple and dark-blue," and finally "the sea was quite black and thick, and began to boil upfrom below" ("Fisherman," pp. 91, 93,96, emphasis added).</page><page sequence="29">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 29 has her consolations ? and thus resembles the fisherman, who similarly persists in his painful toil without needing supernatural compensation. And Mrs. McNab is of course reflected in the flounder as well. We are told that she "looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun-lanced waters" (p. 133); and like the flounder, who effects miraculous changes to the couple's residence, Mrs. McNab ? with the help of Mrs. Bast and her son ? works her magic on the Ramsay house by taking it back from the brink of collapse. We never see Mrs. McNab apart from the house, but her supplemental identification with the fisherman and the flounder on shore allows her to bridge the opposition between mother and father that had defined Woolf's family triangle.85 As an embodiment of materialism, Mrs. McNab is aligned with Woolf's father and thus Mr. Ramsay; but as a stand-in for Mrs. Ramsay after she is gone, Mrs. McNab also occupies the position of the angel, the place of vision within the empty house. By drawing the materialism out of Mrs. Ramsay's angel position, Mrs. McNab helps Woolf articulate a new whole that is now centered on agnosticism instead of the motherly angel. This is the real work that Mrs. McNab performs in the novel. And through her labors, Woolf inverts the moral of the fairy tale. In "The Window," "The Fisherman and His Wife" seemed to offer us a cautionary tale about the rise and fall of materialism in the Ramsay household. But Woolf's revi? sion of the tale in "Time Passes" allows for a happy ending ? recounting now their home's fall and rise. By restoring the house, Mrs. McNab does what Woolf failed to do in the Bennett essays: "reconstruct a habitable dwelling-place" for her characters. With her help, Woolf puts her family on a new footing, so the surviving characters in her novel may now return to the house and try, in this new edifice, to complete what they left undone ten years before. IV: The Voyage Back and Forth The most surprising evidence for my reading of "Time Passes" can be found in the last part of Woolf's novel, "The Lighthouse." Unlike "The Window," this section has a decisive, albeit com? plex, structure: once the characters set off on their tasks, the narrative is divided between tracking Mr. Ramsay's expedition out to sea and following Lily's progress in painting on shore. Page after page, the two parties move farther apart, until each finally lies beyond the sight of the other. Yet as the characters separate, Woolf's narrative weaves together their fortunes by shuttling between the two story lines. Both narrative strands involve journeys (one outward, over the water; the other inward, back through memory), so they seem to parallel one another. And because Mr. Ramsay reaches the lighthouse just as Lily finishes her painting, the two divergent strands seem to converge on the same spot.86 In her diary, Woolf worried about the "chop &amp; change" in her last section, but her narrative's shuttling to and fro appears to solve the "problem [of] how to bring Lily and Mr R. together."87 This solution is also wholly anticipated by what happens in "Time Passes." As we have seen, "Time Passes" is likewise structured around a contest between two sharply divergent out- 85. Emery would likely agree: "Mrs. McNab absorbs into her body the opposing gender qualities that shaped the Ram? says' characters and marriage" (p. 222). 86. Martin Corner reads the structure of "The Lighthouse" in much this way, and he also sees the structural pattern of this section as Woolf's effort at reconciling her mysticism and atheism ("Mysticism and Atheism in To the Lighthouse? Studies in the Novel 13:4 [Winter 1981], pp. 408-23). Also see Zwerdling, p. 207. 87. Diary, vol. 3, p. 106.</page><page sequence="30">30 Journal of Modern Literature looks ? spiritualism and materialism, the restless spirits on shore and Mrs. McNab in the house; and though Woolf first regards these views as irreconcilable, she manages to bring them together when she embraces the obstacle of agnosticism that had stood in her way. This ironic reversal in "Time Passes" is precisely what we witness in the structure of "The Lighthouse" when divergence gives way to convergence. And we have even more reason to read the end of Woolf's novel this way, since the trips Lily and Mr. Ramsay undertake in "The Lighthouse" appear to be, respectively, voyages into spiritualism and materialism. As the two characters physically move away from each other, they seem to move in opposite theoretical directions as well: Lily advances toward the vision she has by the end of the novel, while Mr. Ramsay approaches the godlessness he affirms upon finally reaching the lighthouse: he "stood in the bow of the boat, very straight and tall, for all the world, James thought, as if he were saying, 'There is no God'" (p. 207). But because their divergent journeys are coordinated, their conflicting outlooks seem to end in agreement, as though Woolf has found a way to affirm both spiritualism and materialism at once.88 What transpires in "Time Passes" thus does more than allow the Ramsays to return to their summer home; it also gives Woolf's characters the means to complete their unfinished tasks ? and gives Woolf the means to complete her novel ? by holding the key to the design of the fictional universe in "The Lighthouse." Lily and Mr. Ramsay continue to enact the metaphysical debate staged in "Time Passes" by advancing rival spiritualist and materialist interpretations of the uni? verse; but by shuttling between them, Woolf installs their contest as the pattern that lies behind their world and that holds it, and them, together. In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf clarifies where Lily and Mr. Ramsay end up in the novel when she describes her philosophy as similarly drawing spiritualism and atheism together: "behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern," and yet "certainly and emphatically there is no God . . . we are the thing itself" (p. 72). The apparent contradiction here ? lodged in the heart of Woolf's philosophy, as well as the end of her novel ? indicates how Woolf has found the solution to her familial impasse in the agnosticism she has rehabilitated over the course of her novel. When Woolf connects her mother's spirit with her father's materialism and relocates revelation within the father's house, she turns Stephen's narrow agnosticism ? essen? tially closed to belief ? into the sort of vibrant doubt of Henry Sidgwick, who found in the world of naturalism room enough for belief in a spirit realm beyond. Stephen complained that "to some readers ... [Sidgwick] was essentially sceptical or preferred a balance between two opinions to the acceptance of either";89 but Woolf would prove to be such a reader herself (whether she had read Sidgwick or not), and would evolve her pattern of aesthetic balance out of Sidgwick's brand of rest? less agnosticism, always open to the contrary position. It is this balance of conflicting interpreta? tions that Woolf's restless spirits inherit from Mrs. McNab's labors at the end of "Time Passes": The voice entreated the sleepers, if they would not actually come to the beach itself, at least to lift the blind and look out. They would see how the robes of the august God flowed down-And if the sleepers still faltered, and said, No: that it was vapour this splendour of his, and the dew had more power than he, without complaint without argu? ment, the voice would sing its song-he was content with this; it was enough this ? to 88. As Corner sees it, Mr. Ramsay's "experience is a nonmystical analogue of the 'facing' mysticism implicit in Lily's art" (p. 418). 89. Leslie Stephen, "Henry Sidgwick," Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 22 (Oxford University Press, 1973), p. 1216.</page><page sequence="31">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 31 fold the sleepers round in blue, to be, should they need him, waiting them there. (Type? script, pp. 293-94) We misunderstand Woolf's conceptual journey in "Time Passes" if we try to read this conclu? sion as a victory for either spiritualism or materialism.90 The sleepers are no closer now than they were before to confirming or refuting the independent existence of spirit. But they have nonethe? less made progress: back inside the house again, they have achieved a measure of peace in the face of their continuing doubts, which are no longer unendurable. Whatever restlessness is left to them ("the voice entreated the sleepers") is no longer a problem. In fact, it has become their strength: like Sidgwick, the sleepers may now embrace the real world described by naturalism, while remaining within earshot of the call of belief. "It was enough this" ? a phrase that seems to sanction agnostic limits ? leaves the door open to spiritualism ("should they need" it) rather than closing it off to belief. In the name of agnosticism, Woolf transforms the once-burdensome restlessness ofthe sleepers in "Time Passes" into the invaluable balance of conflicting outlooks structured into "The Light? house." We therefore err again if we try to align Woolf exclusively with either Lily's spiritualism or Mr. Ramsay's materialism, since "The Lighthouse" truly affirms both at once. However, our interpretation of "Time Passes" does more than explain this paradoxical concurrence of conflict? ing journeys at the end of Woolf's novel; it also allows us to see further into the respective journeys that Woolf's characters take. It seems that Mr. Ramsay arrives at atheistic certainty even as Lily reaches her mystical vision; but since each journey arrives at the same place, and is part of the same whole, it must also be inflected by the expedition the other makes.91 Indeed, Mr. Ramsay's journey comes to an end only when he reaches beyond materialism by opening himself to Lily's spirituality, whereas Lily's journey conversely ends only when she embraces materialism through her mystical vision. Woolf may seem here to be condemning her characters (and her novel) to end? less interpretative indeterminacy; in fact, she is only following through on her earlier insight that linked angel and agnostic. James is right to claim that Mr. Ramsay appears to embrace atheism in the end; "The Light? house" charts Mr. Ramsay's journey beyond his disabling dependence on Mrs. Ramsay, his spiri? tual crutch, to a point where he may stand finally on his own two feet.92 But Mr. Ramsay stands free of Mrs. Ramsay not because he has forsaken spirituality, but because he properly looks for spirit now "out there," in the world beyond the domestic sphere. Much as Woolf earlier rehabili- tated her father's agnosticism by turning it into Mr. Ramsay's metaphysics, she now redirects Mr. Ramsay's final journey into atheism by turning it into a spiritual journey into the unknown. Woolf signals this reversal at the very start of part three, when Mr. Ramsay ironically initiates the voyage out that he insisted was impossible in "The Window." And through Lily's thoughts about him, 90. The same ambiguity swirls around the way the sleepers ? and Lily, in the final version of "Time Passes" ? appear to fall just before awakening into "The Lighthouse," for we cannot tell whether they have lost their grip on their skepticism and are failing into spiritual illusion, or if they have instead lost their handle on divinity and are failing into a mire of end? less skepticism. 91. Many critics have noted the apparent interdependence of the two journeys in "The Lighthouse"; see for instance Norman Friedman, "Double Vision in To the Lighthouse," Virginia Woolf: To the Lighthouse; a Casebook, ed. Morris Beja (Macmillan, 1970). 92. Mr. Ramsay seems to have moved beyond the doubts that had troubled him before (pp. 155-56), and he is able to pass the point where the sailors drowned without indulging in the self-pitying chant of "The Castaway" (p. 206).</page><page sequence="32">32 Journal of Modern Literature Woolf develops an alternative religious view of the journey he undertakes, telling us that "there was no helping Mr. Ramsay on the journey he was going" (p. 154) and that he had embarked on a "final phase": "it seemed as if he had . . . entered some other region ... out of one's range" (p. 156). The prophetic finality of Lily's descriptions ? anticipating the moment when the boat will sail out of view ? suggests that Mr. Ramsay's journey is, in fact, into death. But Lily is not alone in thinking this; Woolf has carefully altered her family history in the novel to produce this view of her father. In 1905, ten years after their mother died, the Stephen children actually returned to the family house at St. Ives, much as the Ramsay family does in "The Lighthouse." But Leslie Stephen was not among them, having died the year before.93 If Mr. Ramsay holds Stephen's place in Woolf's family, then he is already a ghost when he returns to the family's summer home. And Woolf secures this interpretation in her novel by telling us, only pages from the end, that Mr. Ramsay is 71 years old (p. 205), which is how old Leslie Stephen was when he died.94 This information ? quietly added to the novel in the final draft ? lends poignancy to Mr. Ramsay's imminent, undeclared death. Like Tennyson's Ulysses, Mr. Ramsay is venturing off, as an old man, into the spiritual unknown. When he declares there is no god, he now seems to make this claim with evidence drawn from the other side. As for Lily, it is hard not to read her perspective on shore in "The Lighthouse" ? just as we have read it above ? as a spiritualist counterpoint to Mr. Ramsay's atheism. Almost every aspect of Lily's day is informed by a mysticism that has much more to do with Bloomsbury spiritualism than with the Platonism that has sometimes been associated with Woolf's book. Like the rest? less spirits from "Time Passes," Lily asks broad, metaphysical questions ("what can it all mean?" [p. 145]) upon her return to the house;95 she also steps into the sleepers' disembodied stance on shore as she prepares to paint ("she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body . . . exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt" [p. 158]); and in her painting she aspires to lift the veil on the visible universe, replacing its "strife, ruin, chaos" (p. 150) with a gnostic vision of simplicity, stability, "something permanent" (p. 161). But Lily's investment in spiritualism really comes clear when her act of painting begins to resemble a seance: like a medium, she stands on shore and calls out to Mrs. Ramsay, as though trying to summon her spirit back from the other side (p. 180). And to solicit this vision, Lily avails herself of spiritualist tools: she fails into a trance,96 and even facilitates spiritual communion by engaging in a sort of telepathy ? as demonstrated by her silent communications with Mr. Carmichael.97 When Lily finally announces "I have had my vision" at the end of the novel (p. 209), all the spiritualist staging in "The Lighthouse" suggests that Lily's words get their meaning from the literal vision of Mrs. Ramsay she had only moments before: "Mrs. Ramsay ... sat there quite simply, in the chair ... cast[ing] her shadow on the step" (p. 202). 93. In making her fictional father take this final trip to the family's summer house, Woolf is again contradicting Leslie Stephen, since he vowed never to return to St. Ives after his wife's death, and died not having done so ("Sketch," p. 136). 94. Born on November 28, 1832, Stephen was 71 years and 3 months old when he died on February 22, 1904. He would have to have lived to the age of 72 if he were to accompany his children to St. Ives in the summer of 1905. Since "The Light? house" takes place in September, Stephen ? at age 71 ? would already be dead if he were on the sailboat with Mr. Ramsay. 95. And later: "What is the meaning of life?" (p. 161); "How do you explain it all?" (p. 179); "What did it mean?" (p. 180). 96. "She was losing consciousness of outer things" (p. 159); "all her faculties [were] in a trance, frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed" (p. 201). 97. "A curious notion came to her that [Mr. Carmichael] did after all hear the things she could not say" (p. 179); he "seemed ... to share her thoughts" even though "they had not said a word all this time" (p. 194); they "had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without her asking him anything" (p. 208).</page><page sequence="33">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 33 The mystical experiences that Lily has on shore are just the kind of spiritual phenomena that members of the Society for Psychical Research would want to investigate. Is her vision a genuine ghost sighting or simply a hoax? To discover the true nature of Lily's final vision, we have to test her experiences against Mr. Ramsay's opposing naturalism; what we will find is that her spiritual communion with Mrs. Ramsay hinges on materiality itself. Our first clue comes from Lily, who appears to struggle with materialism when trying to complete her painting; she says she must first "get hold of something that evaded her... . when she thought of Mrs. Ramsay; it evaded her now when she thought of her picture. . . . Visions came. Beautiful pictures. . . . But what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been made anything" (p. 193). Lily here ? sharing Woolf's desire to commune with her mother ? has also made Woolf's discovery that her vision of her mother's character is not expressed by her angelic beauty but rather is blocked by it; thus if Lily is to reveal what lies beneath Mrs. Ramsay's beauty, she will have to grasp the materiality that Mrs. McNab expresses in "Time Passes": "the thing itself before it has been made anything." Our next clue comes from Woolf's memoirs. Writing in May 1939, Woolf appears to get a handle on this materiality that evades Lily when she reaches beyond her own experiences with her mother and peers into the darkness of Julia Stephen's personal history.98 What Woolf finds there is a "foot rule" for measuring her mother's character: "there is something to take hold of in [the] fact" that her mother "was capable of failing in love with two very different men; one" ? Herbert Duckworth, who died in 1870 ? "the pink of propriety; the other" ? Leslie Stephen, whom she married in 1878 ? "the pink of intellectuality. She could span them both" ("Sketch," p. 85). Straining here to see beyond the limits of her empirical knowledge of her mother, Woolf finds that Julia's most intense and defining experiences came before Virginia was even born: her marriage to Duckworth was the happiest time in her life, while the eight years after his death were the unhappiest. And lifting the crepe a bit more off of Julia's dark years of mourning, Woolf clarifies what these ups and downs have to do with her mother's character: What is known, and is much more remarkable, is that during those eight years spent, so far as she had time over from her children and house, 'doing good', nursing, visiting the poor, she lost her faith. This hurt her mother, a deeply religious woman, to whom she was devoted, and thus must have been a genuine conviction; something arrived at as the result of solitary and independent thinking. It proves that there was more in her than simplicity; enthusiasm; romance; and thus makes sense of her two incongruous choices: Herbert and my father. There was a complexity in her; great simplicity and directness combined with a skeptical, a serious spirit. Probably it was that combination that accounted for the great impression she made on people; the positive impression. Her character was sharpened by the mixture of simplicity and skepticism. She was sociable yet severe; very amusing; but very serious; extremely practical but with a depth in her. (P- 90) 98. Woolf describes the darkness that surrounds her mother's history before she knew her: "What my mother was like when she was as happy as anyone can be, I have no notion. Not a sound or a scene has survived from those four years" of her first marriage ("Sketch," p. 89); the same holds true of the eight "unhappy years" (p. 96) that followed her first husband's death: "She was as unhappy as it is possible for anyone to be. There is very little known ofthe years that were thus stamped" (p. 90).</page><page sequence="34">34 Journal of Modern Literature Woolf here has finally grasped the elusive complexity of her mother's character, as well as her independence of mind. And it is her mother's loss of faith, she says, that brings that complexity into focus. Ironically, Julia's newfound apostasy ? the agnosticism she came to adopt during her years of mourning ? is what gives her a depth of soul, and thus distinguishes her from the two- dimensional angel that seemed continuous with Woolf's early environment. Julia's turn toward agnosticism "makes sense" of her marrying two such different men; it also makes sense ofthe two sides of Julia's character, as a "mixture of simplicity and skepticism." Woolf achieves a vision of her mother ? and at last catches Mrs. Brown ? when she comes to see that the "angel in the house" is herself an agnostic. This too, I would suggest, is what Lily sees, in her vision, at the very end of To the Lighthouse. Spanning the extremes of spirituality and materialism, Woolf's vision of her mother achieves the "razor edge of balance between two opposite forces" that Lily has been struggling to locate in her painting (p. 193). And this complex vision of Julia Stephen's character also describes the "razor edge of balance" that Woolf, in "The Window," has captured in her portrait of Mrs. Ramsay. Woolf actually portrays Mrs. Ramsay as the conventional angel in the Ramsay household; but having seen her from the perspective Lily attains by the end ofthe novel, she delivers this stereotype to us from the inside out: Mrs. Ramsay is an angel that also has depth, is skeptical, and shares her husband's agnostic beliefs. In fact, in chapter 11 ? the only place in "The Window" where Mrs. Ramsay appears alone ? Woolf depicts Mrs. Ramsay precisely as Lily sees her in her vision at the end (p. 202); and Woolf reveals the depth of Mrs. Ramsay's character in this scene by having her replay Julia's conversion to agnosti? cism. In a moment of soul-searching, Mrs. Ramsay enters a "wedge of darkness" where she loses her personality and reaches out for "peace . . . rest. . . eternity" (p. 63). Almost reflexively, she summons god's protection against the hazards of the world ? "We are in the hands of the Lord," she says ? only to stop herself, annoyed for thinking what she believes to be a lie. Like Julia, Mrs. Ramsay disavows the faith of her mother,99 and she then rehearses an argument against God that seems to grow more out of Julia's suffering at the loss of her first husband than out of any trauma Mrs. Ramsay has experienced in the novel: "How could any Lord have made this world? ... There was no treachery too base for the world to commit; she knew that. No happiness lasted; she knew that" (p. 64). In Woolf's holograph draft, Mrs. Ramsay appears unable to find her way out of this pain (pp. 106-8); but when Woolf rewrites this scene in the published novel, Mrs. Ramsay lifts herself out of this dark mood by affirming ecstatically that "she had known happiness, exquisite happiness. . . . It is enough!" (p. 65). Woolf brings her portrait of her mother to completion here by giving Mrs. Ramsay the vision she had herself, in Russell Square, that "the thing is in itself enough."100 And Mrs. Ramsay ? tra- versing the darkness that divided Julia's two marriages in this scene ? helps us see how this vision is afforded by agnosticism. The happiness Mrs. Ramsay celebrates echoes the extreme happiness Woolf assigned to her mother's first marriage; but her capacity to celebrate the sufficiency of that happiness ultimately comes from the agnosticism Julia embraced by marrying Leslie Stephen. As Mrs. Ramsay knits stoically against her mortality, she affirms her life with a revelation that 99. Mrs. Ramsay, "annoyed with herself for saying that," asks "Who had said it?" (p. 63). Only the first draft of To the Lighthouse makes the answer clear: "they said (her mother said) We are in the hands of the Lord; She never had the least inclination to say that" (Holograph, p. 105). By turning against her mother's words of faith, Mrs. Ramsay re-enacts Julia's turn toward agnosticism, which "hurt her mother, a deeply religious woman." 100. Diary, vol. 3, p. 62.</page><page sequence="35">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 35 vindicates the agnosticism Mr. Ramsay aspired to earlier while striding the shore. Certainly "It is enough!" is what Leslie Stephen concludes, at the end of "What Is Materialism?" when he main- tains the spiritual value of life apart from any promise of a hereafter: "We cannot get behind the curtain, which is reality. If this be called a Materialism, materialists we must be. But it is mate? rialism which denies neither the reality nor the value of the loftiest instincts" (p. 166). And "it is enough" is also what Julia Stephen herself concludes when, in 1880, she defends agnostic women against the critique by Lathbury that I mentioned earlier: "purity of life, sincerity of action, obedi- ence to law, love of our fellow creatures, all those qualities which ennoble life are the stronghold of the Agnostic. . . . those who have not the power to follow the reasoning of Christianity should not therefore be denied all spiritual life."101 Woolf had first used the agnostic dictum "It is enough" at the end of "Time Passes" to open her father's materialism to spirit. Now she uses it again, but to open, from the other direction, her mother's spirit to materialism.102 V: The Narrow Bridge of Ancestry Now if there's any truth in Darwin, And we from what was, all we are win, I simply wish the child to be A sample of Heredity ? James Russell Lowell, from the poem he wrote for his god-daughter, Virginia Woolf, upon her birth (1882)103 There is no mistaking the modernity of To the Lighthouse. As a new kind of writing demanded by the new age following the war, Woolf's novel makes a virtue of disruption.104 It studiously avoids the conventional trappings of other novels (such as plot, character description), and it breaks the rules they slavishly obey ? as when Woolf kills off Mrs. Ramsay, her main character, midway through. Moving beyond the ending of traditional narratives, To the Lighthouse also disrupts middle-class values ? displacing, in part three, the gender-polarized world of the Ramsays with a new order centered on a new woman, Lily, whose sexual independence from men threatens the stable gender identities maintained in the past.105 By charting this shift in power from the angel in 101.

Woolf's revisions to her novel illustrate the shiftiness of this phrase, which first appears at the end of "Time Passes" but then, in the final draft, is given instead to Mrs. Ramsay. These changes ? along with the other changes Woolf made to her draft, like the addition of "The Fisherman and His Wife" ? indicate that Woolf never abandoned "the decay of religious belief" as a central theme in her novel but rather pursued it to the very end. 103.

Rachel Blau DuPlessis writes, "By the midpoint of the novel, both of the traditional endings ? marriage and death ? have occurred, a sharp critical statement on Woolf's part that clears the ground of any rival solutions to Lily's plot. The third part of To the Lighthouse surpasses these classic resolutions, moving beyond the endings they propose, to brother-sister links, to male-female friendship, and, even more, to a vision that overwhelms all the binary systems on which the novel has been built" (Writing beyond the Ending [Indiana University Press, 1985], p. 96).</page><page sequence="36">36 Journal of Modern Literature the house to the woman artist outside the home, To the Lighthouse heralds the advance of modern feminism ? even as it links Lily's success to the rise of modern art. Lily's abstract painting may wind up in an attic, but it belongs among the post-impressionist works Roger Fry exhibited at the Grafton Galleries in the winter of 1910; and as a stand-in for To the Lighthouse itself, Lily's paint? ing ? with its line down the middle ? lends modernity and formal wholeness to Woolf's novel, which makes up in design what it lacks in story. To the Lighthouse, in short, answers Woolf's call in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" for a new novel. Woolf even gives us, with Mrs. McNab, the Victorian cook in that essay who has "lived like a leviathan in the lower depths, formidable, silent, obscure, inscrutable," but whose rising into sunlight marks the transition from the Edwardian to the Georgian era ("Bennett" [1924], p. 96).When Lily completes her painting with a final flourish, her gesture seems to underscore how very much Woolf, in order to complete this novel, has herself relied on such a line to put the past behind her. For all these reasons, the revolutionary aesthetic that Woolf envisioned in her Bennett essays is essential to To the Lighthouse. Yet the fact remains that the outlook in these essays is insufficient, in the end, to explain this novel ? or to explain, for that matter, the vision of the novel that Woolf reaches through it. Once we recognize how "Time Passes" exceeds the binary logic of the Bennett essays by affirming the value of the materialist obstacle, we can regard the whole of To the Light? house ? along with Lily's painting ? as a revision of Woolf's earlier aesthetic pronouncements. The difference this novel made to Woolf's aesthetic becomes apparent when we compare the Ben? nett essays with a piece Woolf wrote immediately after the novel, "The Narrow Bridge of Art," which she published in August 1927. The continuity between these texts is unmistakable: in the latter essay, Woolf again calls for a novel that can capture the extraordinary complexity of modern life;106 she again bemoans the tyranny that past conventions hold over contemporary authors strug- gling to realize this modern vision;107 she even expresses her frustration with facts in the name of houses.108 Yet since 1925, the target of Woolf's criticism has shifted from the Edwardian novel to contemporary poetry, whose fortune she links with the lyric: [F]or our generation and the generation that is coming the lyric cry of ecstasy or despair, which is so intense, so personal, and so limited, is not enough. The mind is full of monstrous, hybrid, unmanageable emotions. That the age ofthe earth is 3,000,000,000 years; that human life lasts but a second; that the capacity of the human mind is nev? ertheless boundless; that life is infinitely beautiful yet repulsive; that one's fellow crea? tures are adorable but disgusting; that science and religion have between them destroyed belief; that all bonds of union seem broken, yet some control must exist ? it is in this atmosphere of doubt and conflict that writers have now to create, and the fine fabric of a lyric is no more fitted to contain this point of view than a rose leaf to envelop the rugged immensity of a rock. ("Narrow Bridge," p. 12) 106. For instance: "Every moment is the centre and meeting-place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed" ("The Narrow Bridge of Art," Granite and Rainbow [The Hogarth Press, 1960], p. 23). 107. Woolf observes that "writers are attempting what they cannot achieve, are forcing the form they use to contain a meaning which is strange to it" (p. 11); they "are trying to work themselves free from a bondage which has become irksome to them" (p. 23). 108. The new novel "will make little use of the marvelous fact-recording power, which is one of the attributes of fiction. It will tell us very little about the houses, incomes, occupations of its characters; it will have little kinship with the sociologi- cal novel or the novel of environment" (p. 18).</page><page sequence="37">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 37 Woolf's criticism ofthe lyric here is a significant departure for her, though not because it signals a fundamental change in her aesthetic; she is still trying to push the modernist novel toward the more rarified condition of poetry. The difference lies instead in the way Woolf approaches her aesthetic in 1927 from the opposite direction. When she levels against the lyric the same charge she directed against the Edwardian novel (it also cannot capture her vision109), but then faults the lyric for being too personal, Woolf is implicitly doubling back to correct her previous arguments about the novel and make them more encompassing. What Woolf has come to see is that the aesthetic she promoted in the Bennett essays is insuf- ficiently impersonal. With their imperative that we "look within," these essays cleared a space in Woolf's fiction for her impressionist development of character, but they did so by apparently sacrificing her grasp on the outer world. In "Modern Fiction," Woolf attempts to capture "life itself" ? "a luminous halo," the superfluity of random impressions that make up the invaluable inner life of her characters ? by excluding the external: the novelist's task, she tells us, is "to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever aberration or complex? ity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible" (pp. 160-61). What goes unsaid here is that Woolf risks abandoning her characters to the solipsistic pull of their own egos ? much as the "lyric cry of ecstasy or despair," however "intense," is "not enough" for being "so personal," "so limited." The poetic novel that Woolf envisions in "The Narrow Bridge of Art," by contrast, conveys an ideal balance between the impressionistic and the impersonal ? even as it rescues Woolf's characters from the isolation of their individual selves. In 1925, Woolf argues that the novelist should "have the courage to say that what interests him is no longer 'this' but 'that': out of 'that' alone must he construct his work" ("Modern Fiction," p. 162); but the poetic novel she envisions in 1927 is, by nature, both 'this' and 'that': "It will have something of the exaltation of poetry, but much ofthe ordinariness of prose"; and the prose in such a novel "will show itself capa? ble of rising high from the ground" once it is freed "from the beast-of-burden work ... of carrying loads of details, bushels of fact," though it will also "keep[] at the same time in touch with the amusements and idiosyncrasies of human character in daily life" ("Narrow Bridge," pp. 18, 22). Before Woolf wrote To the Lighthouse, she defined the modern novel by what it excluded; but afterward, it is the novel's power to include ? both poetry and prose ? that sustains her vision.110 Woolf here is not folding back into her novel those materialist trappings ofthe Edwardian novel (factual information, detailed exterior description, compulsory social morality) that she worked so hard to push back in the Bennett essays so she might plumb the subjective depths of her charac? ters. But she is re-evaluating prose (along with non-being: the cotton-wool of daily life) to give the external world an essential place in her art; and the outer world that she recovers here ? the material world that lies beyond ourselves ? is part of the world she excluded in those essays in the 109. Woolf described the Edwardian novel as an "ill-fitting vestment[]" for containing "life or spirit, truth or reality" ("Modern Fiction," p. 160), and she now describes the lyric as unflt to contain "the thoughts, the visions, the sympathies and antipathies which are actually turning and tumbling in [our] brains in this year of grace 1927" ("Narrow Bridge," p. 15). 110. We can measure the difference if we contrast the mixing essential to the poetic novel with Woolf's earlier vision of a novel, whose "purity" of inspiration is not (like the books H.G. Wells writes) fatally "mixed up" with a "great clod of clay" ("Modern Fiction," p. 158). Interestingly, Woolf's argument in "Modern Fiction" is undermined by the contradiction that Woolf later encompasses with her notion of the poetic novel: she initially claims that "the proper stuff of fiction is a little other than custom would have us believe" (p. 161), only to claim later that '"the proper stuff of fiction' does not exist; everything is the proper stuff of fiction" (p. 164). Woolf's idea of the poetic novel makes a virtue out of what her earlier argument cannot handle, even as it reconciles her criticism of the Edwardians with her criticism of the Georgians for not being sufficiently impersonal.</page><page sequence="38">38 Journal of Modern Literature name of materialism. If there is any doubt about this, we need only refer to the examples Woolf cites above for justifying the poetic novel, since it is the insistent reality of naturalism and mate? rialism that the lyric fails to contain. Only by producing a more inclusive vision of the novel can Woolf accommodate the mind-boggling age of the earth (which violently knocks humans off of their pedestals) or manage the irreconcilable contrast between body and spirit (where one "lasts but a second" while the other seems "boundless"). Nor is it incidental that Woolf credits "science and religion," which have together "destroyed belief," as having produced this "atmosphere of doubt and conflict" in which she writes in 1927, since it is materialism ? in the form of agnostic doubt ? that Woolf now looks to for underwriting the inclusive vision of her art. The poetic novel can manage the "hybrid, unmanageable emotions" that arise from such doubts because it is a hybrid literature built upon a refusal to choose between prose and poetry. Unlike either the lyric or the Edwardian novel, the poetic novel is enough because it is fashioned upon Woolf's revelation that "It is enough!" Once we acknowledge the agnostic irresolution that informs Woolf's vision ofthe poetic novel, we can see that her fiction properly hinges on contradiction rather than disruption. The above passage from "The Narrow Bridge of Art" illustrates this subtle shift in Woolf's vision, since the complex impressions that Woolf seeks to capture in 1927 are not random ? as in the Ben? nett essays111 ? but rather sharply contrastive or contradictory: "human life lasts but a second" although "the human mind is nevertheless boundless," life is "beautiful yet repulsive," humans "adorable but disgusting" (emphasis added). Or as Woolf writes elsewhere in the essay, modern life is "full of contrast and collision" (p. 12), marked by "discord," "incongruity," "sneer," "con? trast" (p. 17), where "beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain" (p. 16). This pattern of contradiction can also be found at every level of To the Lighthouse: not only in the structure of "The Lighthouse," as we have seen, but also in the way (for instance) Woolf's char? acters, throughout the book, typically contradict themselves within pages (as when Mrs. Ramsay fluctuates between defending Charles Tansley and finding him odious); or in the way Woolf refrains from judging her characters, leaving us instead to sort through the competing judgments they form about each other.112 This kind of contradictory openness, I would suggest, describes as well what is most distinctive about Woolf's other modernist fictions, both before and after 1927; but it is through the writing of this one novel, To the Lighthouse, that Woolf arrives at this vision. Contradiction lies at the heart of Woolf's vision of her mother ("her character was sharpened by 111. In "Modern Fiction," Woolf presents randomness and disruption as ends in themselves when she famously instructs us to "record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however discon- nected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness" (p. 161). 112. It would be wise to defer here to Alex Zwerdling, who has already composed a marvelous description of this dynamic in Woolf's novel: "Everything about To the Lighthouse is invented to do away with the necessity of exclusive choice, from the individual sentence to the book's overarching structure. The sentence and the paragraph are turned into instruments for recording opposing responses. The words 'but' and 'yet,' with their corrective force, become a mannerism of the novel's style.... Such indecisiveness in judging both others and oneself is the standard evaluative mode of To the Lighthouse and accounts for a good deal of its complexity" (p. 205); "The book as a whole is conceived as an inclusive fiction, a structure that allows rival codes to coexist rather than forcing the reader to choose between them" (p. 207). Although Zwerdling never relates this aspect of Woolf's novel to agnosticism, he acknowledges the "fundamental uncertainty" that the "firm ideology of Victorian family life" often produced "in those who could neither believe in it nor reject it entirely" ? which includes characters like Lily, who exhibits "continued emotional dependence on a discarded model of conduct" (p. 204). He goes on to write that "if such ambivalence could not finally be resolved, it could be exploited. Woolf's most important deci? sion in planning her novel was to make her own divided loyalty its structural principle." I would add only that the features described here are not merely specific to To the Lighthouse but are typical of Woolf's modernist aesthetic.</page><page sequence="39">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 39 the mixture of simplicity and scepticism"); and contradiction is the essence of Mrs. Ramsay's character that Lily captures, with her vision at the end, when she completes her painting by draw? ing a line down the middle. And with "Time Passes" ? the line Woolf draws down the middle of her novel, as well as the isthmus that stretches between past and present ? Woolf builds, before the fact, her own "narrow bridge of art" in To the Lighthouse, coaxing both poetry and the impersonal out of her prose. Now we can discern one further reason why the agnostic Mrs. McNab ? whom Woolf contracted to renovate her house of fiction ? ultimately prevails over the mystics in "Time Passes"; it is through her that the novel will become a kind of poetry. In "The Narrow Bridge of Art," Woolf tells us that poetry ? like the gnostic spirits on shore ? "has remained aloof in the possession of her priests" and is too stiff "to express this discord, this incongruity, this sneer, this contrast" of modern life (p. 17); but prose ? more like Mrs. McNab ? "is so humble that [she] can go anywhere; no place is too low, too sordid, or too mean for [her] to enter" (p. 20). And it is prose ? which (like Mrs. McNab) has always "served the needs" of others and (like Mrs. McNab) "has taken all the dirty work on to her own shoulders" ? that "is going to take over ?has, indeed, already taken over ? some of the duties which were once discharged by poetry" (pp. 17-18). The novel can become a kind of poetry because it is a "cannibal," capable of "devour[ing] so many forms of art" (p. 18); and Mrs. McNab accomplishes her task of restoring the house because she assimilates into herself, and into her agnosticism, the vision of the mystics against which she is initially defined. Embodying contradiction and hybridity in this way, Mrs. McNab oversees the sublation of Woolf's fiction, giving To the Lighthouse "something of the exaltation of poetry, but much of the ordinari- ness of prose" ("Narrow Bridge," p. 18). "Time Passes" thus captures the vision ofthe novel that Woolf failed to grasp in the Bennett essays; it provides her with a fictional blueprint for the aes? thetic she goes on to formulate in "The Narrow Bridge of Art." This returns us to the modernity of To the Lighthouse. "Time Passes" looks ahead to "The Narrow Bridge of Art" by offering us a view of the poetic novel of the future; but to realize that vision, Woolf has had to double back to her past essays to recover what she previously excluded from them. The modernity of To the Lighthouse is no less paradoxical, for it too is fashioned out of the past. As we have seen, Woolf's characters reach the end of the novel by retracing the steps Woolf has already worked out in "Time Passes," and "Time Passes" ? rather than look ahead ? finds its bearings in the debates that defined her parents' generation. The new order that Woolf installs in "The Lighthouse" thus relies upon, and repackages, what was already in play in "The Window" ? just as Woolf's solution to her family triangle was already latent in the structure of her argument in the Bennett essays. Behind the seeming no-man's-land that Woolf fashions in "Time Passes" between poetry and prose, and behind the disinterestedness Lily aspires to (and Woolf achieves) throughout the novel, lurks the Victorian contest between doubt and belief. This historical debate marks the impasse that Woolf faces in "Time Passes." She gets beyond it, and comes into her own as a modernist novelist, not by landing upon a new resolution ? for Woolf has no more success reconciling spiritualism and materialism than the Metaphysical Society or the Society for Psychical Research had. Rather, she moves forward by affirming, in the name of agnos? ticism, the historical irresolution of these debates, and by sublating the restlessness of the Victo? rian agnostic into the central principle of her modern art ? an art of contradiction, not disruption. But this means that "The Lighthouse," in the end, never really gets beyond "Time Passes" at all. The most substantial difference between the two sections is that the content of one has become the</page><page sequence="40">40 Journal of Modern Literature form of the other; and the counterpoint in "Time Passes," which once expressed Woolf's sense of disconnection, has become the formula for bringing her novel to completion. The supreme example of how Woolf smuggles the past into the present under our noses in this book can be found in the iconic structure Woolf designed for it. In her writing notes, Woolf described the form of To the Lighthouse as "two blocks joined by a corridor," which she illustrated with the barbell figure that most readers are familiar with (Holograph, Appendix 48). Critics have marveled at the archetypal resonance of this image, which speaks to a host of oppositions woven into the novel.113 But my argument reveals the extraordinary personal significance this image had for Woolf; behind this vision of the modern novel ? and behind Woolf's "narrow bridge of art" ? we can discern the features of her mother's bifurcated history: "she spanned the two mar? riages with the two different men; and emerged from that corridor of the eight silent years to live fifteen years more" ("Sketch," p. 91). For the public, the tri-part structure of To the Lighthouse records the advance of history from the Victorian past to the modernist present. But for Woolf herself, it also connects, in its entirety, mother and daughter around the trials they experienced individually within their respective generations: blissful happiness, followed by a period of the darkest unhappiness, followed by a hard-won resolution. "Time Passes" may look like a chasm dividing one generation from the next in Woolf's book, but ultimately it functions much more as a bridge ? or corridor of ancestry ? between Woolf and the world of her parents. In particular, Woolf seems to have discerned an uncanny connection between her "unhappy years" and those her mother suffered through.114 When she charts Mrs. Ramsay's descent into agnosticism in chapter 11, Woolf relives not only her mother's imagined unhappiness but also her own: like Mrs. Ramsay, Woolf knew, from the two great unnecessary blunders of her mother's and Stella's deaths, that "there was no treachery too base for the world to commit," that "no happiness lasted." The darkness that Mrs. Ramsay enters in chapter 11 is often read as looking ahead to the flood of darkness that descends upon "Time Passes," but now we can see that Mrs. Ramsay undergoes in these pages the same contest between belief and skepticism that Woolf later conducts in "Time Passes." The parallels between these sections forge a link of ancestry ? or passing down ? between mother and daughter. And if the darkness they share arises from their common struggle with belief, agnosticism (it is enough, after all) also provides both with a way out, since the obstacle that before had barred Woolf from her mother ? her father's agnosticism ? has become their means for communion in this dark space. In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf tells us how Julia Duckworth was helped out of her mourning and depression by reading Leslie Stephen's writings on agnosticism: "when at last she was left alone ... she began to think out her position; and for this reason perhaps read something my father had written. She liked it. . . when she was not sure that she liked him" (p. 90).115 In this essay, I have argued that Woolf ? following in her mother's footsteps this time ? also reads something her father wrote 113. See, for instance, Mepham, p. 100. 114. In "A Sketch of the Past," the eight "unhappy years" (p. 96) of Julia's mourning after Duckworth's death find their counterpart in the "seven unhappy years" (p. 136) of Woolf's own dark internment at 22 Hyde Park Gate after Julia and Stella died. 115. Recalling the scene from chapter 11, Woolf imagines her mother "sitting in the creeper-shaded drawing room at Hyde Park Gate in her widow's dress, alone, when the children had gone to bed, with a copy of the Fortnightly, trying to reason out the case for agnosticism. From that she would go on to think of Leslie Stephen" ("Sketch," pp. 90-91). This image may suggest the importance "An Agnostic's Apology" had for Woolf, since this was the only one of Stephen's essays on agnosti? cism that appeared in The Fortnightly Review before he began courting Woolf's mother.</page><page sequence="41">Gaipa: Agnostic's Daughter's Apology 41 about agnosticism when she sets out to compose her family fiction. The effect is essentially the same: in the end, she comes to like both her mother and father the better for it. Woolf owed her very existence ? life itself, one might say ? to the agnosticism that brought her parents together. But only when she refashions her parents in her fiction ? opening her father's materialism to belief, and her mother's spirit to materialism ? does she open herself, and her art, to their agnostic legacy, fulfilling at last Lowell's prayer that she grow up to be "a sample of Hered- ity." Woolf never gets beyond the Victorian crisis of religion in To the Lighthouse. And despite the historical revisionism of "The Lighthouse," neither does she put her parents' marriage behind her. Instead, Woolf translates the Victorian couple ? angel and agnostic together ? into her vision of modern art.116 When Lily aspires, in her painting, "to be on a level with ordinary experience, to feel simply that's a chair, that's a table, and yet at the same time, It's a miracle, it's an ecstasy" (p. 202, emphasis added), Woolf is finally embracing, as her aesthetic ideal of balance, the Ramsay's marriage as an agnostic union of materialism and spirituality. 116. And here is where I disagree with Zwerdling: "Stronger than [Woolf's] impulse to recapture the world of her parents was her need to shape her characters according to her own vision" (p. 181). Woolf certainly adjusts her portrait of her par? ents to her own vision, but how does she come to achieve that vision? By "recaptur[ing] the world of her parents."</page></plain_text>
