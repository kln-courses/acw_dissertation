A few remarks regarding the literary aspects of this metaphor are first needed. The metaphor consists of two distinct parts, each of which constitutes an independent unit, yet at the same time the two are artistically intertwined and so are the messages they carry. Structurally, the great metaphor appears to be unique in biblical literature. The first unit starts with verse 4, ending with the words וכסף הרביתי לה in verse 10. This unit is a 'textual sentence', i.e., a topic unit whose semantic subject is an unfaithful wife. The story is completely personal·, what happened between the unfaithful wife and her husband can be related to any married couple. The name of God is not mentioned in this unit, nor is idolatry stated specifically. The second unit, verses 11-15, is definitely theological. God is emphatically mentioned, in its conclusion (ןאתי שכחה ;אם הי), and so are הבבלים (verse 15). The very phrasing of this unit proves that all the acts contained in it relate to God. Thus, only He can take away (prevent the ripening of) wheat and wine in their time and season (ולקחתי דגני בעתו ותירוש, במוסדו, verse 11; contrast with verse 10 of the first part which does not have the words בעתו...במועדו). The phrase חהב עשו לבעל (v. 10) serves as a connecting link between the two units. At the end of the great metaphor comes the phase of appeasement between God and His people: (16) לכן אנכי כפתיה והלכוניה המךבר ןךבךוני על לבה; and (17)ונתתי לה את־כרמיה משם ןאת עמק עכור לפתח ונקוה וענתה שמה כימי נעוריה וכיום עלותה מארץ מ?רים The appeasement relates directly to the second unit and indirectly to the first. We propose that the text of these verses includes the following motifs: (a) The return to the desert, namely to the period preceding the settlement of Canaan. This period is seen romantically, as that of true love: verse 16. (b) The renewal of the normal, honest, husband-wife relationship. (c) Because of the appeasement the nation regains its strength, its sins being effaced. Motifs (b) and (c) are unwrapped in verse 17. Motif (b):־ וענתה for this verb see A. Deem's interpretation ('The Goddess Anath and Some Biblical Passages', JSS, 23 [1978], pp. 25-30). The pi'el stem of the root ענייה is frequently used in biblical Hebrew to denote an enforced act of physical union between a man and a woman (e.g., Deut. 21:14; Lam. 5:11). Comparing the use of the qal and pi'el stems in roots like חיה) חי"ה - 'he lived' - ודה 'χ revived, brought y to life') or אבד) אב"ד '[he] was lost' - אבד 'χ caused y to be lost'), it may be inferred that ענה in the qal signifies a normal, unforced, physical union between a man and a woman. The physical union is preceded by the drinking of wine: this notion is metonymically conveyed by כרמיה 'her vineyards'. The stages of the metonymy process: vineyards &gt; grapes &gt; wine. The connection between drinking wine and the physical act of love is evidenced in Cant. 2:4-5, 5:1-4 (cf. also Cant. 1:4 and 4:10; Hosea 4:11; Prov. 23:27-30). A reference to this connection is also found in Ugaritic literature. Motif (c) is communicated by the phrase ונתתי לה..) ואת עמק עכור לפתח ונקוה). The word ונקוה can also mean 'cord' (Josh. 2:18,21), and it is possible to interpret it as 'strength' in Job 14:7</page><page sequence="2">VI ENGLISH ABSTRACTS (and perhaps, as a secondary, concocmitant, meaning in קוי, Is. 40:31). Etymologically the latter meaning is derived from the root qwy which in Arabic regularly denotes 'power, strength'. The semantic feature of binding, prominent in the meaning of 'cord', is also present in mishnaic Hebrew in the word און (Nega'im 11:8; vocalisation not certain; it is און in the Yem enite tradition) 'binding (of flax)', which may be related to that of און 'vigour', common in biblical Hebrew. It is suggested that עמק עכור in this verse has a double meaning, a trait not rare in Hosea's Hebrew. In addition to that of 'Valley of Calamity, Curse', it possesses a secondary sense, namely that of 'strength impaired'. The analysis of the denotations and connotations of the root עכ"ר discloses the sense of 'feeblenness', 'defectiveness' (cf. ועברת in Prov. 15:16, con trasting חסן 'abundance, strength'). The root עמ"ק in biblical Hebrew also carries the sense of 'strength, force' (Jer. 47:5; Job 39:21). Support for this can be found in Akkadian and Ugaritic. Thus, עמק עכור לפתח תקוה signifies, concomitantly with the meaning 'the transition from the state of calamity to that of the beginning of hope' also that of the 'conversion of the state of "impaired strength" to that of the beginning of (renewed) might'. The paper concludes with a discussion of the use of the forms of ענייה in Hosea 2:23-24. ON THE SON OF GOD', ARMILUS AND MESSIAH SON OF JOSEPH by Israel Knohl Document 4Q246 from Qumran treats a figure called 'the Son of God', who is described as being destined to be a great person in the world, whom all will serve. Scholars disagree as to the identification of this figure. Some claim that it refers to a positive messianic figure, while others believe that it refers to a negative historical personage who they identify with Alexan der Ballas, the Seleucid ruler. David Flusser argues that 'the son of God' is to be identified with the figure in the Oracles of Hystaspes who is called 'the son of God and the false prophet' and with the second beast which is described as a false prophet in the vision in chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation in the New Testament. Flusser claims that all these figures represent the anti-Christ. The author of this paper accepts Flusser's thesis, but rejects his claim that the figure is purely mythical. The paper argues that the reference is to an historical person, who is de scribed in mythical terms, i.e., Augustus, emperor of Rome, who claimed to be 'the son of God' and who was worshipped as a deity. The sources referred to above were in fact opposing the Augustan propaganda and the notion of emperor worship. Augustus, who claimed to be the redeemer of mankind, is described as the anti-Christ. Similarly, according to the author, the mythical figure of Armilus-Romulus, who appears in Sefer Zerubbabel and other midrashim, is also to be identified as Augustus, who repre sented himself as the heir and successor of the legendary Romulus, the founder of Rome. In the Oracle of Hystaspes, as well as in the Book of Revelation and Sefer Zerubbabel, 'the son of God', 'the false prophet', 'the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit', or 'Armilus' kills a religious leader. Hystaspes describes the victim as a true prophet; Revelation (chapter 11) tells how the beast will kill the two messianic witnesses; and in Sefer Zerubbabel we read of the murder of Messiah, son of Joseph. The author claims that these descriptions</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH ABSTRACTS VII refer to an historical event which took place in 4 bce. In the suppression of the revolt which broke out after the death of Herod, Augustus' troops killed a messianic leader. They refused to allow his body to be buried and it remained on a Jerusalem street. This event was the basis of the myth regarding the slaying of 'Messiah, son of Joseph' by 'Armilus'. It is further suggested that that event had a great influence on the messianic doctrines of Jesus Christ. IF IT WERE NOT A WRITTEN VERSE IT COULD NOT BE SAID by Moshe Halbertal The formula 'If it were not a written verse it could not bee said' is a sentence that introduces few statements in the Midrash. This rare formula serves as a conscious expression that something daring is about to be said, and that without the shield of a written verse it could not be said. The analysis of the occasions in which the 'If it were not' formula occurs is thus a key for our understanding of rabbinic religious sensitivities. The study of midrashim that are introduced with the formula yields the following conclu sions: (1) in most cases the idea expressed by the midrash is actually not written in the verse in its straightforward meaning. The formula reveals therefore a cirular nature: the interpreter creatively rereads the text, and then he states that if his interpretation weren't already in the text he would not have dared to offer his reading; (2) in answer to the problem what is con sidered daring in the Midrash the following pattern is manifested: most of the midrashim that are introduced by such formula represent God in anthropomorphic metaphors in which God's role is reversed and transformed. Anthropomorphic metaphors are usually drawn from hier archical human structures, such as king and slaves, father and son, husband and wife, etc. God is always represented as the figure which is superior in the analogous social relationship; He is the husband, the king, the father, and so on. In midrashim that are introduced by the formula 'If it were not', God is represented as the inferior partner in the analogy - he is a slave, a student, a wife and a defendant in a trial. In these metaphors or parables Israel or the righteous are represented as the superior figure. Another form in which hierarchical meta phors are reversed is exhibited in the Midrashim that use metaphors from non-hierarchical relationship such as friends and twins. The last part of the essay is devoted to uncover the same pattern in other midrashim that are not introduced by the 'If it were not' formula, and to a discussion of the significance of this phenomenon in rabbinic religious thought. FATAL FICTIONS by Joshua Levinson This paper discusses the cultural resonances of the arena in late antiquity with special refer ence to the athlete mashal of R. Shimeon ben Yochai on the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis Rabbah 22:9). In an attempt to break away from the formalist tradition which stresses the autonomy of the literary text, as well as the positivistic historical approach which attempts to isolate an historical kernel, the author proposes viewing these texts as a social practice in con tinuous conjunction with other cultural mechanisms for producing meaning and knowledge.</page><page sequence="4">VIII ENGLISH ABSTRACTS The discourse of the arena is examined as an ideological construct, as political theater for the expression and representation of the dominant Roman ethos. In the social imaginary of late antiquity the arena occupied a liminal cultural space, it joined together the earthly and the divine, life and death, honor and shame. For this very reason the subordinate groups in this culture, specifically the Christians and Jews, could utilize this same discourse of the arena as a means of resistance to and accommodation with the hegemonic voices. Within this com plex of power and its critique the mashal of R. Shimeon stakes out a unique position. THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE MARRIAGE STATUTE (TAQQANAT HA-NISSSU'IN) OF TOLEDO by Aharon Shweka The Marriage Statute (Taqqanat ha-Nissu'in) of Toledo is one of several similar Taqqanot in effect in Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries that were meant to regulate the in heritance rights of a married couple at the death of the husband or of his wife. In one of its sections the statute deals with the case of a childless couple when the wife dies during her husband's life time. In that case the statute stipulates that the inheritance should be split between the husband and his wife's heirs, thus contradicting the Talmudic law accord ing to which the husband has sole rights of inheritance of his wife's estate. Around 1320, a polemical controversy arose in Toledo between Rabbenu Asher (HaRosh) and R. Israel, a local scholar, as to the correct interpretation of that section of the statute. The issue at hand was whether the wife can indeed bequeath her half of the inheritance to whom soever she wishes, including to her husband. The Rosh's opinion was that the statute gives the wife no such rights of will, while R. Israel argued forcefully that it did. In his arguments R. Israel mentioned the prevalent local custom in Toledo as well as previous interpretations of the statute by the rabbis of Toledo. He also relied on the language of the original Arabic version of the statute and did not abstain from using philosophical arguments as well. The paper explores the unfolding of this entire controversy and retraces the chronology of its events. The Rosh's ruling that began it all has reached us in two different and contradictory versions. The paper argues in favor of one of them, which is documented in some manuscripts, over the one commonly found in print, and this preference leads to a new understanding of the objective of the assembly of the community council (Tove ha-Ir) that was initiated by the Rosh following the large public interest his ruling aroused. The paper also analyses the five letters that were exchanged between the Rosh and R. Israel during that episode. The fourth chapter of the paper deals with an ancient interpretation of the statute which has been pre served in a recently published manuscript. The reconstruction of the original manuscript text reveals that the question debated in 1320 was in fact under discussion in Toledo already as early as the beginning of the second half of the thirteenth century, shortly after the statute was enacted, and that it was indeed decided then in the same manner as it was later decided by the Rosh. It is clear therefore that, contrary to what one may have assumed, R. Israel does not represent in this dispute the original position of the Toledo rabbis, but only the local custom as it had prevailed in Toledo since the end of the thirteenth century. The fact that the original interpretation of this statute by the Toledo rabbis was unknown to the Rosh himself and did not surface either at the time of this debate or before it, is indicative of the poor state of the Toledo rabbinical courts in the second half of the thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH ABSTRACTS IX The appendix (co-authored together with S. Hopkins) presents the document that contains the statute in its original Arabic version and its ancient interpretation (as reconstructed in its original sequence), as well as its Hebrew translation, with annotations to the various Hebrew versions that have reached us, both in print and in manuscript. Book Review: VARIANT READINGS IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD - A METHODOLOGICAL STUDY MARKING THE APPEARANCE OF 13 VOLUMES OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE COMPLETE ISRAELI TALMUD'S EDITION by Shamma Friedman The Babylonian Talmud has been traditionally accorded a central position within the entire Talmudic-Midrashic corpus, which encompasses Mishna, Tosefta, Bavli, Yerushalmi and Midrashim. During the more than century and a half of modern Jewish studies, the Talmud edition by Yad Harav Herzog represents one of the major landmarks. It is a worthy continua tion of Raphael Rabbinovicz's Variae Lectiones (=Diqduqe Sofrim). Although its organiza tional roots, and often its intellectual orientation, are significantly within the sphere of tradi tional (i.e., non-academic) Torah studies, non-the-less the edition also addresses and makes major contributions to the critical-historical school. The project has been in operation for almost 60 years, although its publications began to appear in 1972. These were preceded by a period of thirty years in which the groundwork was laid. This task included collecting data regarding surviving manuscripts and rare first printed editions of the Babylonian Talmud, and locating and assembling photographs of the thousands of surviving manuscript fragments. The next stage, even more challenging, represents a Her culean accomplishment - the colossal jig saw puzzle of rebuilding the fragments that belong to the same original manuscript into consecutive text, to the degree that such survives. Schol arship is much in debt for this contribution. The initial period also witnessed the preparation of the monumental cross reference sys tem, upon which the edition rests. Of necessity, our review of this work must be limited in its scope, and can touch upon selected topics only. We will first dwell briefly upon masoret ha-shas ha-shalem, which provides a running cross reference to parallel passages within the entire talmudic-midrashic corpus. This is an invaluable tool to scholarship, in that comparison of text to parallels is, or should be, one of the hallmarks of modern Talmud studies. The main improvements that I can suggest lie in three areas: Mishna should be referenced by chapter and mishna, not by Bavli folio numbers; use of page references to scholarly editions should be increased; the definition of a parallel should be sharpened, so that this section does not include reference to single words or short phrases which belong more authentically to lists of terms and not parallel passages. Our main concentration will be upon the variant readings. This edition presents an appa ratus with an impresive collection of variant readings from primary textual witnesses of the Talmudic text, on a line by line basis. Checking for accuracy in an investigation of select manuscript originals, I found the transcription of a high level of accuracy, although the types of errors represented could be avoided in terms of the precautions herein suggested. The issue of the completeness of recording the variants is a more complex problem. Were minute orthographic variants regularly reported, the apparatus would grow to unwieldy di mensions and become even more difficult to use. However the current practice of ignoring</page><page sequence="6">ENGLISH ABSTRACTS less significant orthographic variants renders the apparatus of limited use to the philological scholar, whose research is dependent upon full and exact representation of the original text. The apparatus in the currant edition does not enable the user to compose an accurate letter by letter reconstruction of specific manuscript text, often required for a full appreciation of the issues under study. More serious is the problem that relates to one of the central principles upon which the apparatus is constructed, and we will expand upon this in greater detail. The base text of this edition is a transcription of the Vilna edition. The apparatus, in ori enting to the base text, attempts to record all variants, but does not record the agreement of the primary textual witness (or the secondary, for that matter), with the Vilna text. This pre sents a major difficulty for the user. If indeed the Vilna text is a loyal representation of the first printed edition and is in complete agreement with the manuscript texts, this is an impor tant piece of information which is significant for both the traditional user as well as the scholarly one, but not supplied here directly. The elimination of such information is connected with the concern that the apparatus not grow to unwieldy proportions. Agreement of textual witnesses with a base text is always a knotty problem, which must be reckoned with in any edition of this type. The editors of the Complete Israeli Talmud expect the reader to deduce that any witness not listed for a particular line or word contains a reading identical with Vilna. This solution is cumbersome enough for complete manuscripts — the reader must con stantly be equipped with information as to which manuscripts exist for each tactate or part of a tractate but it is virtually impossible for Geniza fragments. The result is that a finding of high potential significance, the corroboration of the accepted text by the oldest manuscript remains, is not readily available from this edition. A further problem that has developed is that of newly discovered manuscript material, which cannot be easily incorporated once the volumes are published. In the future, the entire enterprise of recording variant readings of the Babylonian Talmud for scholarly purposes must be based upon a computerized synopsis which presents the entire text of each witness horizontally, and allows comparison vertically. Modern technology and communications will thus allows us to go far beyond the apparatus, the only feasible medium for publication of this type of material in the past. The quiet clarity of synoptic presentation versus the taxing noise of apparatus investigation provides manifold scholarly benefits: the ability to see and comprehend the overall relationship of the variants for any specific phrase, overarching patterns of textual groupings and families, accurate full-text presentation, and more. When built with creative computer programming, many sophisticated research tasks will become possible, potentially increasing the creative part of scholarly life. Newly found man uscript material can be incorporated without agonizing delays, and improved electronic com munications will give the entire resource direct and immediate access. This vision should be best materialized through organizational cooperation. However, pro posals for the future are contrastable to achievements in the present. Yad Harav Herzog has provided us with a superb and unique resource in its complete Israeli Talmud, combining painstaking preparation, skill and determination, expertise and toil to produce a monumental achievement and central scholarly contribution, for which we are all indebted.</page></plain_text>
