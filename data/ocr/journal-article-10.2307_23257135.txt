The previously neglected stuff of life is back and now deserves to be embraced and included in our histories and democracies. This paper discusses our efforts to include these others and seeks to reflect on how some of our gestures of inclusion may not be as humble and tolerant as we like to argue.

Keywords Things • History ■ Memory • Ruins Wonder, as I understand it, is not a general attitude in front of a wonderful world. What is general—the idealist attitude—is the explaining away of what would complicate our judgments, or worse, what we see as dangerous, encour aging irrationality. This is why silencing the power of wonder is not to be identified with a scientific attitude. Rather, it designates science as it has been mobilized in defence of public order (Stengers 2011, p. 374). Introduction The recent growth of archaeological approaches to the contemporary past, or present, has coincided with the return of things in the humanities and social sciences. In fact, the origin of these approaches is partly traced back to the development of garbage t&gt;.

Thus, while all archaeology is arguably a study of material culture, the emphasis on things and materiality in archaeological approaches to the recent and contemporary past is fundamentally embedded. After a long period of neglect, culminating in the frameworks of post structuralism in late twenteith century, "things are back," as stated by Trentman (2009, p. 283). It is even claimed that we are facing a paradigm shift; a turn away from the linguistic hegemony towards posthumanism and new materialisms (e.g., Coole and Frost 2010; Domanska 2010; Wolfe 2010). In archaeology and anthropol ogy this is not least apparent in the renewed interest in things, matter and stuff and a concern for materialities of all kinds—of everyday life, death and individuality, of memory, politics, religion, and stone, to name but a few. While materiality is yet, or consequently, a concept ill-defined and elusive its popularity alludes to the common motif of assigning matter, material culture, things or "the real," a new stance of significance in social and cultural academic research and discourse (see e.g., Appadurai 1986; Bennett 2010; Brown 2001, 2003, 2010; Gell 1998; Graves-Brown 2000; Hallam and Hockey 2001; Hoddcr 2011; Hoskins 1998; Ingold 2000; Kanppet and Malafouris 2008; Latour 1993, 1999, 2005; Meskell 2004, 2005; Miller 1987, 2005; Olsen 2003, 2010; Preda 1999; Tilley 1994, 2004). And considering the loyal servants they are, what could be more just after decades of neglect, of being either fetishized or dissolved into air? "Surely, things deserve better," Trentman comments (2009, p. 292). Or as Latour (1999, p. 214) argues; "They deserve to be housed in our intellectual culture as full-fledged social actors." Therefore, we have also adopted more inclusive and humble ontologies, where things too are granted with the virtues of agency and vitality, where they are included as well in our constructions of history and where our democracies have been extended to embrace them too (cf. Latour 1993, p.142). For what less could things deserve? This paper discusses this question, but rather than providing any solid answers as to what things deserve it seeks to reflect on how some gestures of inclusion may not be as humble and tolerant as we like to think. With reference to an ongoing archaeological research of a neglected site, an abandoned herring pro cessing station, from Iceland's recent past I will discuss how the archaeological remembering of this site and its inclusion in historical narration can easily result in the active forgetting of things' own character; their fragmented and discontinuous memory and their utter silence. Far from refuting the agency or vitality of things I will argue that the desire to include them often takes the form of assimilation', things are humanized whereby their otherness, their thingness, is explained away, and where their right to be included is mistaken for their right to be. As an alternative I will explore how this can be overcome and, by attempting a turn to things themselves, seek to scrutinize the possibility of a different ecology of practices (Stengers 2005); one that does not require the abolition of things' otherness or unfamiliarity in order to render them useful but accepts the possibility that things themselves may be the source of their own signification (Benso 2000). Ruins of the recent and contemporary past provide an exemplary heuristic case in this respect by accentuating, through their withering and crumbling, the integrity and otherness of things; in other words, how things exist, act and inflict on each other, also outside the human realm, and how they may remember these pasts in their own (alternative way. Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 579 The question is, however, is there room also for these often trivial and coincidental ruin memories in our accounts? Approaching Eyri Eyri is located in Ingölfsfjöröur in Strandir, on the east coast of the Westfjord peninsula, one of Iceland's most isolated regions (Fig. 1). My first visit to Eyri was in early August 2010. The drive to Eyri takes a while and I've realized since that it, for some reason, simply always takes longer than you think. The roads, of course, are awful but the route is beautiful. Threading the narrow strip of land along the coast, in fjord, out fjord, and never revealing too much of the scenery at a time. Farms and settlements inhabited get sparser the further north you get while specters of a recent past become more evident. Eyri is located almost by the end of the road. The last bit of the gravel track takes you from Trékyllisvik in sharp and twisting curves up the Eyrarhâls pass (Fig. 2). From there you get the first glimpse of the Ingölfsfjöröur fjord with the spectacular rock formations of Drangaskörö beyond its mouth in the distance, and the little cluster of houses at the foot of the steep slope below you. The first view of Eyri, thus, is from above but from an oblique angle—a bird's view. You see all the buildings at the site; the three farm houses (now used as summer houses) on the east side of the river flowing down from the mountain and into the sea. Eyri in fact means river estuary. On the other side of the river, down by the shore, you see a stately building, a two-storey timber house on concrete foundations. It is the Ôlafsbraggi F.yri STR.4XDIR Djùpavik "V.

Visible buildings are, from left, the shed that housed the shrimp factory, the stately Ôlafsbraggi and two of the farm houses behind it, the Ingofur herring factory and the oil tank. The roof of the women's dormitory is visible above the factory, but the Storage house is hidden behind it. The road leading down from Eyrarhâls pass is clearly visible on the slope (Photo: bora Pctursdôttir) where the managers and higher staff of the herring factory lived, and where all the male workers dined. Close to it stands a small green shed where the Eyri farmers for a short time ran a shrimp factory. Further away you see the low, timber built Lagerhüs or Storage house, with its read/grey roof of corrugated iron plates, which housed the shop, the laboratory, offices, storages and rooms for rent (Fig. 3). Behind it you see the massive, concrete-grey Ingôlfur herring factory (Fig. 4), the building stretch ing from the shoreline up towards the mountain slope. Its roof looks green and blends with the green of the surrounding land. You see the tall, read roofed and charming timber house at the foot of the slope, the Thorsteinssonbraggi (see Fig. 3), where the girls and women working at the salting station lived, and where the farmer ran a small hardware store in the basement. Beyond the factory, but rising above it, you see the substantial, concrete built oil tank where the valuable herring oil was stored before it was shipped out to markets in Europe. If you look closely you also see less conspicuous structures among the standing buildings; concrete founda tions from buildings that once were another factory, a bakery, dwellings, a large storage house. And you see the remains of timber piers along the shoreline, appearing and disappearing with the movements of the waves reaching the pebbly beach. There lie also the remains of the landing crane, like a gigantic rusting spider on the seashore. It is no metropolis, of course, but taken into consideration where you are, and how you got there, the cluster of houses silently lurking at the foot of the slope below you as you stand on top of Eyrarhâls instantly catches your eye and makes you wonder. What is this place? What was this place? From above, Eyri already looks deserted—but it is not until you have come down the steep hill, along the narrow road that leads you past the ghostly houses, that you are sure the place is abandoned, and that it has been so for some time. The eastern gables of the two timber houses are gaping towards the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 581 Fig. 3 Thorsteinssonbraggi, the women's dormitory, at foot of the slope and the timber built Sotragc house, with their gaping gables. The concrete foundations of an older factory arc visible in the foreground, and the standing factory with its concrete chimney in the back (Photo: Inga Malcnc Bruun) fjord mouth (see Fig. 3), walls are leaning, roofs are caved in, windows broken, the concrete of the factory is cracked and fractured. Grass is growing on floors, moss and lichens in bright colors on walls and window ledges. From above you had seen the vegetation on the concrete built roofs of the factory and oil tank. Now, nearing the buildings, you understand why; a swarm of birds circle above you, their angry calls fill the air and one by one they swoop down to attack. It is the arctic tern that has Fig. 4 Ingolfiir factory and a swarm of its present day seasonal inhabitants, the arctic terns (Photo: l&gt;ôra Pctursdôttir) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">582 Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577 -603 overtaken the roofs of the buildings (see Fig. 4). Usually nesting on the bare ground the flat roofs provide a perfect spot for the tern, and conveniently also unreachable by the region's constantly growing population of arctic fox. You also see smaller birds, sparrows, flying in and out of broken windows or openings, making use of the many habitable nooks and crannies and enjoying the protection and security involved in neighboring the aggressive tern. Along with the screeching sound of birds the buildings also generate different eerie and indistinct noises; loose boards of corrugated iron or timber moving in the wind, hinges creaking, things falling, water dripping, dust drifting. Walking around inside the buildings you hear the sound of rubble and glass crushing underneath your feet. It is cold and dim inside, even though it is sunny and rather warm outside. The smell is profound but different from house to house and room to room. It often indicates damp and rotting wood, paper, things or debris, moist soils, animal dung and mould, while there are also more indefinite and strange scents in the air. As your eye adjusts to the light inside the buildings, rooms, stairways and corridors things take over, appearing in familiar, less familiar or alien forms and assemblages everywhere you turn. The rusting heavy machinery in the factory, a boiler, a press, a dryer, brick laid ovens and steam kettles; the unused spare parts in the storage, some still neatly packed and labelled; the supplies in the stock room behind the shop, rusting cans of liver paté and fish pudding, bottles, buttons and hairpins; an archive of damp books and documents in the attic above the office, some partly consumed by mice or covered in mould; the bunk beds and straw mattresses in the girls dorm (Fig. 5) and the single stove they shared among them; test tubes in Fig. S Bunk beds and straw mattresses in the women's dormitory, Eyri (Photo: t&gt;ora Petursdottir) â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 583 different shapes and sizes, gloves and jars with strange liquids in the laboratory (Fig. 6); everywhere floors are covered with things, broken, crumbled or pulverized. No matter where you turn you will turn to things. A mixed feeling of wonder, excitement and despair overtakes you; what is this, what do I do with it—and how can I possibly account for it? Eyri: A Neglected Site from a Recent Past I was rather well prepared on my first visit to Eyri. I had read much of what there was to read about the place, and the period and history it belongs to—the herring history. Herring has played an important role in Iceland's recent history. As most parts of the Western world Iceland underwent large-scale social and economic transformations during the twentieth century; from being one of Western Europe's least developed countries by the turn of the century to become one of the worlds wealthiest and most developed nearing its close. The growing fishing industry, and not least the herring industry, was an important drive in this development, producing wealth and employment, but also furthering settlement nucleation with changes in means of subsistence and livelihood (Jônsson 1980; Jônsson 2004; Sigurösson et al. 2007). The strongest indication of the herring industry's acclaimed impact is maybe captured in the phrase "sildarasvintyriö" or "the herring adventure" which is generally used to describe and denote the golden age of the herring industry from the early 1900s into the 1960s, when herring more or less disappeared from Icelandic waters. And although an ephemeral phenomenon, the herring, salted or rendered, has repeat edly been portrayed as the nation's rescuer "bjargvaettur Jjjôôarinnar" (cf. Sigruösson 1989)—as the key to modernity, to independence from the Danish crown (in 1944) and economic viability during the former half of the twentieth century, a period thus considered to be highly significant in the nations recent history as well as in its Fig. 6 Scicncc in action; the decaying laboratory in the Storage house at Eyri (Photo: t&gt;6ra Pctursdottir) Springer</page><page sequence="8">584 Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 present day identity. A significance, moreover, well reflected in the attention devoted to this period and the "herring adventure" in both novels and academic historical accounts. The herring industry affected more or less every settlement along the coast of the island, while landing- and processing stations were also established in remote and previously sparsely or unsettled areas where proximity to the resource was a first priority (Ragnarsson 2007). Eyri in Ingölfsfjöröur is one such community. Eyri's herring history spans the period from 1915 to 1952, during which Eyri underwent massive transformations—from a small scale salting station to one of the country's most mechanized rendering factories (Jöhannesson 2001; Matthiasson 1973). As part of these developments a small and partly seasonal based com munity was formed in Eyri, with all the facilities necessary; dwellings, cantinas, a social venue, a laundry, a bakery, a shop that sold everything you could possibly need, in addition to the factory buildings, garages, laboratory, storages and offices. The industrial enterprise was, however, completely dependent on the unpredictable herring stock which during the 1940s diminished considerably along the Westfjörd peninsula. This gradually took away the rationales for the processing station in Eyri and after a short life in function its engines were finally silenced in 1952 (Jöhannesson 2001 ; Matthiasson 1973). When abandoned, however, the factory, the engines, the dwell ings, the shop, the laboratory with all its equipment, offices, archives, beds, chairs, food supplies, and spare parts were left behind, in hope of return—a wish however never fulfilled, but to which the community of things and structures still today faithfully bears witness. Eyri's post-industrial biography has been one of (human) negligence and the herring factory and all related facilities have been left more or less unattended. Icelandic heritage law (ï&gt;jôôminjalôg nr. 107/2001) defines (and automatically protects) archaeological heritage as any cultural remains over 100 years old, and architectural heritage preceding 1850 (Lög um hüsafriöun nr. 104/2001), while later remains may be specially protected.1 The industrial ruins at Eyri, like other modern ruins "littering" Icelandic landscapes, thus lack any protection as well as an official declaration of cultural value. Similarly, while the herring history is well covered in written accounts the sites and their remaining material assemblages have not enjoyed the same attention. The new publication of Iceland's herring history in 2007 (Sigurösson et al. 2007)—three elaborate volumes, together nearly 1,100 pages and 5.5 kg of text, found no place for these stubborn survivors, the buildings and their sounds or smell, the rusting machinery, the bunk beds or other things whole or broken, the floor deposits, the rotting wood, the cracked concrete, the new inhabitants. Thus, while Eyri and the herring history appeared to be so well known, all these things I encountered on my first visit were unknown, unaccounted- and uncared for. Surely, I thought, they must deserve better. But what, and how would I make sure they received their deserved attention? Walking around and inside the buildings at Eyri it was not so much the sites relation to the events described on the 1,100 pages of herring history I had meticulously read that affected me. 1 These acts will be replaced with a new and more inclusive law in January 2013, which eventually will lead to the protection of Eyri's heritage. Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 585 Rather it was the concrete presence and weight of the site, and the fragmented, incoherent memory things held. It was not just that the site, the things, the smells and sounds added new and valuable aspects to the history I had read, or other herring histories, but that their "presence effects" (Gumbrecht 2004) proposed a different way to remember this past. Not a counter-history but something counter to history; ruin memories that were already there and not at all awaiting my interpretation or historization. Alternative Histories and Alternatives to History It is interesting to note that the existence of text (in abundance!) has never been the issue of debate in archaeologies of the recent and contemporary past, as it was, and still is to some extent, in historical archaeology. Perhaps one may say that it emerged and developed partly in opposition to text, as a specific approach to the tacit and unwritten, which also counts for the earlier garbage archaeology (Rathje and McCar thy 1977; Rathje 1984). As stressed by Buchli and Lucas (2001a) in their ground breaking volume Archaeologies of the Contemporary Past the defining criteria for archaeology had by the turn of the millennium been divorced from temporal concerns and oriented towards the particularity of the archaeological gaze and material inquiry. While it was, of course, questioned whether an archaeology of the recent and contemporary could really claim to be archaeology at all, the issue was thus to some degree settled on the conception that all archaeology is in fact contemporary (cf. e.g.. Buchli and Lucas 2001a; Hodder 2001; Olivier 2001). Or, as similarly argued by Lucas (2004), that all archaeology is "prehistoric." One could therefore claim that with the advent of archaeology of the recent and contemporary past, and the justifi cation for its existence, the conception of archaeology has come to involve a far more explicit independence from history than what has been expressed by spokesmen of historical archaeology (mind the name). Although not put in such direct terms the underlying statement is that Archaeology is not History. Subsequently, the rightful and often heard legitimization for archaeological approaches to the recent and contemporary pasts, and presents (and indeed for historical archaeology as well), is that the archaeological perspective enables us to bring to light other or alternative aspects and other histories than those produced through historical sources and engagements; that things allow us to access also the ineffable, the mundane and the everyday realities, the subaltern, the silent or silenced groups of the past. Many turns to the previously neglected things or material cultures of the more recent pasts can therefore be seen as endeavors towards such correctives; deconstructing master-narratives by giving voice to those marginalized or absent in historical sources—the people without history (Little 1994; Wolf 1982). This aim is apparent, and even firmly established, in the two edited volumes that have become recognized as two of the most significant milestones in the history of archaeology of the recent and contemporary past (e.g., Harrison and Schofield 2010; Harrison 2011), Matter, Materiality, and Modern Culture (Graves Brown 2000) and Archaeologies of the Contemporary Past (Buchli and Lucas 2001b). The editors of both volumes emphasize archaeology's ability to destabilize what is dominant or taken for granted by defamiliarizing the familiar (Graves-Brown 4") Springer</page><page sequence="10">586 Int J Histor Archaeol (2012) 16:577-603 2000, p. 1; Buchli and Lucas 2001a, p. 9). And that through its focus on the archaeological material, the non-textual, and its practical striving to uncover that which has been withheld from view "the archaeological act comes directly into contact with the subaltern, the dispossessed and the abject" (Buchli and Lucas 2001a, p. 14). Because of these established aims and alleged capacities there seems to be an underlying notion among many of its practitioners that archaeology of the contemporary and recent past (and the same could indeed be argued for much of historical archaeology) is in itself an ethical statement. The fact that it is addressing fields previously left out of academic discourse is considered a moral move in itself. The fields' practice is described as inclusive, multi vocal and democratic, and thus providing academics as well as non-academics with more egalitarian means to engage with, construct and reconstruct historical experience and recent pasts (cf. e.g., Buchli and Lucas 2001a, b; Harrison and Schofield 2010; Olivier 2001). However, as already noted the development of archaeological approaches to the recent and contemporary past is embedded in a general turn to materiality and things in the humanities and social sciences at large. In this respect the democratization of archaeology through the development of archae ologies of the recent and contemporary should not only be seen as an aim to include subaltern subjects and their alternative histories but also to address and include material cultures previously uncared for. The waste and vestiges of the modern regime—things conventionally considered too recent, repulsive or mundane to be included in our accounts and histories. It has lately been questioned, however, to what extent scholars of materiality, generally speaking, have been true to this agenda, in what sense they have in fact turned to things, or to what degree the things themselves have been their focus. In his discussion of materiality as a concept Ingold (2007, p. 2), for example, proclaims that in order "to understand materiality, it seems, we need to get as far away from materials as possible." He asks whether the concept of materiality may have lost its concreteness and instead become a rather vague "stand in" for what things comprise. And as stated by Olsen (2010, p. 3), the claimed turn to things, or interest in materiality, has in fact "for some reason ... largely left void the intrinsic material significance of things and the qualities they possess beyond human cognition, representation, and embodiment" (emphasis in original). Hence, despite the current obsession with materiality, it seems, the things themselves, their essential material qualities, are for some reason, still, mostly left out of concern. Despite the enthusiasm for what things allow in terms of approaching the othered and subaltern they themselves rarely seem included in the empathy and care for the marginal otherwise persistently voiced in these studies. And although the wish for correction is articu lated in many arguments for thing- and material culture studies, among them archae ologies of the recent and contemporary past, things more often end up as a means towards a moral end—while they themselves run the risk of being lost in translation. Hence, one would like to concur with Trentman's (2009) proposition that surely, things must deserve better. But why is it that things still seem to have the tendency to fall in between? Maybe part of the problem resides in the belief that a moral corrective is somehow inherent to our modes of inquiry and our choice of perspective. That Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 587 addressing things is an end in itself; and that the right to be included equals the right to be. In his argument for the shortcomings of postmodernist critique of history, Nandy (1995) discusses the problem of integrating the other and the misunderstanding of ingrained morality. He argues that while it has become generally accepted that there is no one objective history to be revealed, and that the past is constantly reconstructed, the principle is yet that the remedy is the democrati zation of history, in opening history to all those ahistorical others and their alternative histories. The improved approach and the incorporation of the previously excluded thus becomes an end in itself, "an exercise in self-correction" (Nandy 1995, p. 50). The problem however, as Nandy points out, is that these critiques of history and suggestions of alternative approaches have nevertheless been historical: they may be radical claims for alternative histories, for other histories—but never for something other than history. In other words, however radical they may be they are not pleas "for alternatives to history" (Nandy 1995, p. 53, emphasis in original). Nandy describes this historical hegemony in terms of what he calls "impe rialism of categories", a conception related to what Said (1978) called "strategic formations" in his argument for the Western construction of "the Orient." That is how a conception, a genre, gains mass and becomes objectified through its own repre sentations and the referential relation among those representations (Said 1978, p. 22). This is a self-sustained system, a circulation of reference, where a statement or concept eventually does not only constitute knowledge of the subject described but takes its place and thereby constitutes the reality it seeks to depict. This is directly applicable to Nandy's argument for history's complete hegemony over the domain of the past. That is, in the modern, enlightened, conception "there is no past independent of history" (Nandy 1995, p. 53), and if there is, it must be anticipating its historical incarnation. I find Nandy's critique interesting and relevant here, as an analogue case, but not least because what he is criticizing is the imperative of history, and how it has colonized our conception of the past. His argumentation of how other cultures' modes of conceptualizing and constructing the past are no less othered within a more democratic or inclusive history, may hold for non-human material cultures as well. The problem is not how history is defined, the problem is history. And one reason for why things are still, despite our efforts, mostly lost in our historical narrations may be that this particular modern conception of the past is yet another "trait" they do not share with us. Despite several opportunities we have never accomplished, as argued by Olivier (2011), to divorce our conception of archaeology from cultural history, and in fact "one of the basic hypotheses of the discipline holds that the past that lies outside of recorded history is historically knowable" (Olivier 2011, p. 182, emphasis added). Thus, critical as we have been of history, and clear on the fact that archaeology is not history, we have remained positive to our ability to deconstruct and rewrite it, also when it comes to including our fellow non-humans. We seek other histories and alternative histories—but we rarely seek beyond it. And while we are concerned with what things remember it is mostly because we believe they give us an alternative perspective on history (which surely they do), but not that their memory may also differ from history. And thus things still end up as means towards an end. £] Springer</page><page sequence="12">588 Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 In our tum to things we have sought to abandon the modern conception of things as passive and inert matter. We have applied the frameworks of semiotics and network theories to underpin a re-conceptualization where things are seen not only as mediators but as social actors —who through the power of relations are holders of agency and vitality. We write their biographies, include them in our histories and we repeatedly speak of extending democracy to things. These are of course all partly strategic articulations; we do not intend to claim that things are alive in the actual meaning of the concept—after all things are not us. We could therefore say that in lieu of other ways of expression our striving to get beyond anthropocentrism has taken the form of what we could call strategic anthropomorphism, with allusion to Spivak's (1988) term "strategic essentialism." That in order to be able, in the first place, to even speak of things in another way than as dead and replaceable matter, we took the risk of reducing them to sameness, to humanized things (see Domanska 2006 for similar critique). It is possible, however, that this strategy has served its purpose and is now burdening us with its own excess and thus needs to be abandoned in order to make it viable for us to take a step further; to take things also for what they are. Without refuting their capacity to "act" or their "vitality," we have to consider the consequences of the fact that we have sought to assimilate things into an already anthropocentrically loaded terminology, and into a very specific histor ical genre and conception of the past, which things maybe cannot (or indeed will not), because of their otherness, really flourish within. Indeed, speaking of democracy—we need only look into the etymology of that concept to understand that things' integrity, what things are and what they deserve, is maybe not best served within that political framework (the Greek concept dêmokratia (6TUJ.OKpccricx) being formed of démos (ôrmoç) = "people" and kratia or kratos (kpcitoç) = "power," and hence, power to the people). Ruin Memories "History has never been a fetter on the ankles of Icelanders but only a source of energy. " Such declared Âsgeir Âsgeirsson, spokesman of the Icelandic parliament and later president of Iceland, in his speech at the millennial celebration of Al|&gt;ingi in 1930 (Hâlfdanarson and Rastrick 2006, p. 102). Iceland, the "Saga-island," was then and still is best known for being the home of the Sagas, the legends of the Norse Vikings. This Saga heritage has understandably highly influenced the Icelandic archaeological tradition as reflected in its strong Viking age and Early Medieval focus (Lucas and Snaesdôttir 2006; see also Friöriksson 1994). Even more effectively, however, has this heritage influenced the "Icelandic identity"; Icelanders are de scribed, and even describe themselves, as the "saga-nation," a people obsessed with history—and a nation that by tradition holds record of its own history. And although it has been strongly debated, all archaeology in Iceland can be claimed to be historical archaeology. While the earliest written records seem to appear roughly 300 years after the island's first settlement they are nevertheless considered informative of these first ages of the Icelandic settlement. The past in Iceland, thus, is history—and as conventionally understood Iceland has no prehistory. Being an archaeologist in "Sagaland" I would therefore claim quite the opposite to Âsgeirsson (as others have Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 589 done before me, see e.g., Einarsson 1994); that history has indeed sometimes been a fetter, precisely because it is too much of an inspiration, dominating our ideas about the past and wittingly or unwittingly directing our research agendas. The archaeological investigations at Eyri are part of a larger research project called Ruin Memories where the overall aims are, "firstly, to critically scrutinize the normative categorization of modern ruins and the discourses and practices that may have led to their academic and historical marginalization; [and] secondly, to reassess the cultural and historical value of this "prehistory" and of the role things play in expressing the ineffable" (Ruin Memories, www.ruinmemories.org). My objective, thus, was to explore why these vestiges of the modern, and things more generally, become marginalized and silenced in social discourses and moreover to examine how these things contribute to upholding the past, and how they enable different forms of memory that may inform social and historical inquiries. During my research at Eyri I have therefore clearly felt the weight of the 5.5 kg of herring history, that I have carried with me also during fieldwork, much like a fetter, not to mention all other historical accounts of the period. And while the archaeological exploration of Eyri does, of course, add new aspects to this history, I also felt there was some kind of inconsis tency to my agenda; that there was some incommensurability between valuing things and considering their historical value. I wanted Eyri's things to bear witness to this history—to this particular conception of the past: to the ideals and limits of capitalism, to the initial expectations and consequences of industrialization. The sites layout could bear witness to the construction and manifestation of class and gender, the material excavated in men's and women's middens to their different status and condi tions. Eyri and Eyri's things could even constitute a heuristic case for the deconstruction of the grand abstract schemes of the modern regime, to our dualistic ontology, to the division between nature and culture, past and present, modernity and tradition. Eyri could become an extremely useful means in such correctives. However, climbing that ladder of inference, 1 felt, was anything but a move towards things. It was rather avoiding the challenge of really confront ing things; the true challenge of valuing things and not only their historical or otherwise derivative value. Could I really pretend to be doing some justice to Eyri's things, to be doing them a favor, by allowing them to bear witness to this historical past? How would their statements be rewarded? How would their silence be translated into history? 1 sensed a growing feeling of arrogance as I walked around the site. And however hard 1 tried to "tread lightly upon the earth" (Bennett 2004, pp. 365-366), I heard the sound of things crushing underneath my feet. Since herring production at Eyri came to a close in 1952 the factory and the small community of adjacent buildings have been left more or less unattended for. The ruination process, therefore, has been uninterrupted, efficient and fast and Eyri's transformation is significant. Left to their own being and preferences things develop disturbing mixtures and combinations, new forms and sometimes near formless creations. Walls and concrete decompose, things degrade, nature intrudes, mingles and reclaims. The previous clear distinction between the man-made and the natural surroundings evaporates as material debris disperses into the surrounding landscape while nature trespasses the concrete boundaries of the site, creating "manifestations of Springer</page><page sequence="14">590 Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 threatening otherness in a [yet] familiar space" (Edensor 2005, p. 313). As I looked around me it became ever more clear that the memory of things themselves, and the "involuntary memory" (Benjamin 1999) their presence evoked, did not really corre spond with the grand narrative, the herring history, that I wanted them to testily to. And in any case, the one characteristic that seemed distinctive for most of Eyri's things, their fragmentary and incoherent nature, their own banal recollection - in short, their otherness and the presence effects this generated, would most likely be lost in my translation. These were ruin memories that were already there and not at all awaiting my interpretation or historization. Without really thinking it through as a possible part of my project, or an alternative project, I started making notes of these trivial encounters with Eyri's things. With just a few thoughts, a couple of sentences among my field-notes, and some photographs, I gradually gathered my own fragmented recollection of these ruin memories. It did not become a big collection, but nevertheless a varied collection of encounters with things, images and texts and the immediate reactions and sensations they provoked. A collection big enough to share with you a few examples. The first two ruin memories were encountered in the herring factory's engine hall. One of them is the gigantic cogwheels driving the herring press (Fig. 7). Like rusting clockwork, the wheels still cling together in the exact same way as when they were shut down, possibly in 1952, as if stubbornly holding on to a moment in the past so it may be revoked or rather endured into ever new presents. I remember standing in front of the gigantic wheels, on the spot from where the photograph is taken, together with my informant, a 91-year old man, who clearly remembered the factory while still running. I remember him doing his best to explain to me the technology in front of us, the sound of wheels turning and machines roaring. I tried to listen carefully, I nodded, I even took notes, but my mind was drifting; to the size of the wheels in front of me, Fig. 7 The first ruin memory; the gigantic cogwheels in the factory's machine hall (Photo: l&gt;6ra Pétursdôttir) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 591 they were much bigger than me, and to the moment they petrified. The metal was ice cold and its surface was rough from corrosion. I did not want to be impolite but I remember having problems doing both at once—admiring that thing in front of me and understanding its retold use and function. I respected his effort, of course, but did not fully understand. And yet, despite my unconcern for its history, I was deeply affected by the thing facing us. As we continued our walk along the processing line I remember thinking how irrational that was, how naïve—and wishing my notes had been more detailed. Even more affective was the encounter with the second ruin memory (Fig. 8), the oil centrifuges standing in a row by the wall opposite to the cogwheels in the machine hall. Despite my informant's meticulous description of their function, how the herring oil was rinsed as it ran through their system, and my eager note taking, I could not rid away the thought that their responsibility involved something far beyond oil rinsing. Lined along the wall, overlooking the other machines in the hall, as well as me in front of them, they looked almost militant. Nowhere in the hall could I evade their suspicious eye. I felt we had invaded their premises, that my informants detailed descriptions of their function were disturbing their silence— that it was much rather me, my informant and our unasked-for visit to this world of things that needed explanation. Was I here to spread democracy? How pathetic, I thought, they seemed to be doing fine without me. I'm anthropomor phizing them of course - but how can I not? This was how they immediately affected me. Yet, importantly, this was not a humanized and comforting affection. It was rather their disturbing thingness which now, in their abandoned being, was allowed to shine through; their unsettling otherness that seemed to escape any attempt towards definition.

It was terribly warn as the old timber house sheltered us from the chill ocean breeze. The work was hard, the midden deposits were dense and coarse and rich in stone coal. Suddenly and utterly unexpected the comb appeared at the trowels edge. It was blue, or rather turquoise, unlike anything I had ever excavated before—and took me by immediate surprise. The plastic on its rim was slightly worn, it was broken and a few of its teeth were missing. These faults were probably the reasons why it ended up there in the midden, on the slope outside the house. On the side facing us in the sun, by the edge of its handle, the comb was marked with its origin, "MADE IN U.S.A", the "IN" encircled and slightly tilted. How exciting, we thought, we could most likely trace it directly to its producer. Recall its route across the Atlantic—mass production, we thought, consumption, export and import. But as we kneeled there in the sun admiring that extraordinarily blue thing in the soil the enthusiasm to explore its meaning or memory beyond its immediate presence gradually faded and turned into an appreciation of the comb itself. Its blue otherness, its incompleteness and its presence there and then, in the coarse soil in front of us. This fragmented quality of Eyri's things was evident in different ways wherever you turned, in buildings decaying, in things broken, but also and interestingly, given our obsession with it, in fragments of text. On paper, packaging, walls, and doors, on concrete, brick and wood, fragments of text appeared in different contexts in all of the buildings at Eyri. These fragments increasingly intrigued me. Barely noticing them at first they slowly came into view, one by one they revealed themselves in their sometimes obvious, other times discrete locations; names of people, boats and places, initials, images, calculations, messages, poems, instructions, advertisements, frag mented news, and novels. Some in isolation other in clusters they were like minute and often banal memories that remained—yet without being remembered. Again, ruin memories that were already there and not at all awaiting my interpretation or historization.

Ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">594 lnt J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 The fourth ruin memory (Fig. 10) I encountered on the concrete wall of the factory's landing hallway, beside the conveyor belt along which the herring entered the building. It was hauled in from the boats—Grötta, Fugloy, Huginn, Grundick, Fame, Döra, Jökull—with the landing crane on the pier in front of the factory. From the belt it was scooped into the compartments on each side of the hallway and the amount brought in by each boat was recorded in numbers of "mal" (150 1). Sometimes, like on August 17, 20, 24, and 25, on the wall beside the belt. Maybe with a piece of chalk or with a small stone of some kind, possibly a piece of fragmented concrete. Today the surface of the wall is degrading and information is lacking from the original memo. Yet, as soon as you let go of the idea that this fragment is constitutive of Eyri's grand historical narrative it is the immediacy and weight of its incompleteness that becomes meaningful. Everything it leaves out, or does not remember, becomes constitutive of its totality. My fifth ruin memory (Fig. 11) I encountered in the women's dormitory, in a yellow painted room on the second floor in the timber house at the foot of the slope. A message written with a blunt pencil on the yellow painted panel above one of the beds, which in my imperfect translation reads as follows; A girl that may sleep in this bed is asked to report to the below signed Garöar Halldôrsson Fig. 10 The fourth ruin memory; Grôtta, Fugloy, Huginn, Grundick, Fame, Dora, Jökull...

It was moved there from another salting station in 1918. At Eyri it became the summer-home of up to 50 women who shared among them the eight rooms and the one stove in the hall by the stairway on the top floor. The walls in that house hold many fragmented memories, names, dates and images (Fig. 12). Anna, Indi, Dianna, Rûna, Pâla, Margret. Also male names like Alfred, Oskar, Pôrôlfur, Pôrarinn. I do not know who the girl was that slept in that bed and Garöar wanted to meet with. Or when it was that he left her the message. However, rather than simply recalling that event, a moment when Garöar leaned against the wall, the message faithfully born by the wall remembers a duration - a duration that has outlived many girls in that bed. And thus, rather than lessening the memory evoked the details unknown, the mysteries, become part of its potency. My sixth ruin memory I encountered on the floor in the stock room behind the shop in the storage house (Fig. 13). It is page 6 of Vikan, an Icelandic weekly, from 1938 (2nd issue); the first page in an article written by a Dr. Phil. Poulsen. The heading, in my translation, reads; Predators of incredible size reigned over the earth millions of years ago. A drawing beside the text shows two lions attacking a mammoth, and the huge mammoth holding one of them victoriously above its head. The text, partly consumed by mice (as if demonstrating their disapproval of its argument), discusses the earth's fauna millions of years ago with a special focus on the larger animals and the dinosaurs. In line nine, though, it says; "Many millions of years ago reptiles were the most common on earth, but at that time the first mammals were small, monstrous, resembling rats. " It is an odd piece of text, describing in a coherent and sensible way an outlandish world that vanished millions of years ago.

Poulsen, knows in any coherent or sensible way—but from fragments that remained; from ruin memories, fossilized, degraded, and incomplete. These fragments, however, have no presence in Poulsen's text and not at all in the detailed attack scene depicted beside it. Their silence and discontinuous memory did not translate well into this historical narration and rational conception of the past.

But acknowledging it for what it is instead of forcing it to witness to a historicized version of the past it does not remember, it becomes immediately meaningful. Not in the conventional, historical or rational way but in a more prosaic and abrupt way. As I encountered it page 6 of Vikan was lying on the floor of the stock room behind the shop. It is a room without windows that requires a few moments to adjust to the darkness as it slowly comes into view. The page from Vikan was part of a dense crowd of things; other pages and fragments of paper, hairpins, buttons, broken glass bottles, tin cans and ceramics, dust and sheep manure that together covered or composed the floor of the room (Fig. 14). Page 6 of Vikan was among the recognizable things in the assemblage. The bulk of it, however, was composed of an almost formless mass of crumble and debris. A thick carpet of things, non-things or nothings, degraded and reunited into a state of complete unfamiliarity that through its mass generated a stillness, a silence, that filled the room and devoured each sound I made as I carefully moved across it. A small whirl of dust was stirred up with each of my steps. As the darkness faded the otherness of the assemblage grew even more apparent. Here, things showed themselves in their most incomprehensive way. An aura of otherness and wonder had also designated my encounter with the cogwheels and centrifuges in the machine hall, but at least they had a clear and recognizable form, even a figurative form. Here I was rather confronted with a landscape of things—of something and nothing which I had no means of grasping. This entanglement of non things and nothings evaded every category, every concept, every instrument I mas tered. I could not name them, I could not count them. They did not obey as I kneeled down to tell them apart. Yet their presence was beyond doubt, and even grew stronger with my despair. Was I to make sense of this? To translate it into history?

Encountering that plane of things, non-things, and nothings and their saturated silence I felt, with every sense in my body, the contradictions of my agenda, the paradox that essentially will be, and has to be, part of any attempt to approach things themselves; the concurrent experience of their direct availability and yet total seclu sion and remoteness. Things Forgotten—Things Released "Things-in-themselves? But they're fine, thank you very much. And how are you? You complain about things that have not been honoured by your vision? You feel that these things are lacking the illumination of your consciousness? But if you missed the galloping freedom of the zebras in the savannah this morning, then so much the worse for you; the zebras will not be sorry that you were not there, and in any case you would have tamed, killed, photographed, or studied them. Things in themselves lack nothing, just as Africa did not lack whites before their arrival" (Latour 1988, p. 193, cited in Bryant 2011, p. 34). Eyri's things deserved better, I was convinced. They deserved to be included. But included in what? In our anthropocentric terminology that grants them with life, agency and speech (but ironically rarely with death and thus liberation), and as witnesses to our historical constructions of the past? Such and inclusion, I would argue, is actually nothing else than yet another version of things' suppression. A true democracy extended to things; be like us and we shall welcome you in your difference (cf. Domanska 2006 with reference to Badiou 2003). We need to be reminded, as Domanska (2006) has pointed out, that care is not an ultimately moral move. Taking care of something or someone entails a relationship of control, a hierarchy where the one, or the thing, taken care of is placed under the rule and authority of another. Thus, we could say that in our effort to extend our care to things we have placed ourselves in the position to decide what is for their best, what they deserve and what they want. And as the ultimate goal of our modern ethics is to secure the integrity of the subject—to defend it by all means possible from the fate of objectification—our only epistemological means to care for their being has in effect been to reduce them to subjects; to humanized things. Our claimed ontological shift, it seems, has come no further than this. But the turn to things is not effortless. We cannot simply turn around on the spot, and contain the point of departure, the norm, as our own stand. We need to step down and face things as things, as the others that they are. Because while their inclusion takes the form of assimilation they will continue to be lost in our translations. An inclusion of things should, as has been suggested by Introna (2009) with reference to Lingis (1994), rather be thought of as a "community of those who have nothing in common." Things aren't us—they do not live, die, breathe or speak. But rather than putting all our effort into eliminating their difference we need to find a way to overcome our fear for it and instead allow ourselves to be challenged by it; to occasionally allow us to remain in wonder. •£] Springer</page><page sequence="23">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 599 As archaeologists, I state, we all experience that wonder when we encounter a thing unrecognized and unseen before. At that moment of prehistoric wonder we see the thing itself, and we become affected by its concrete presence. Unfortunately, however, we have no means to contain that momentum. As argued by Olivier (2011, p. 32), we find ourselves torn between a fascination of that unknown thing we hold in our hand and an irresistible desire to make it "a part of what is already known." A similar tension is described by Andrén (1998, pp. 105-6) in relation to the in betweenness of historical archaeology and how its representations fluctuate between the genres of narrative and biography on the one hand and analysis or statistics on the other In other words, we discriminate between interpreted data and raw data— between things explained and things awaiting explanation—or indeed, historization. There is no past outside history. Of course, interpretation in archaeology has almost without exception been driven by the inclination to dig deeper, as the immediate, what meets the eye, is not enough. It is often both fragmented and incoherent but furthermore it is considered a mere material expression of the more important and genuine social or symbolic meanings that reside behind it. These things, we believe, not to mention non-things or nothings, are meaningless or devoid of value unless socially or historically contextualized. In other words, what characterizes this epistemology is not only that meaning, value and significance is seen as inevitably subjective, but also that meaning is confused with or restricted, rather, to symbolical or other modes of derivative meanings (cf. Olsen 2012, p. 223). Meaning beyond intellectualization is meaning/ess. And, importantly, this regime of derivative meanings leaves no space for wonder, because in retrospect there is none (cf. Stengers 2011, p. 380). But if, as Latour argues, things-in-themselves are doing just fine, and our attempts to care for them so far have even resulted in quite the opposite, should we at all be bothered? And are we even able to care for them? I think finding ourselves in wonder about our capacity to care for things, or to know them, is actually a first step in a more empathetic direction. What we need is to find a way between care and carelessness or indifference; a way that allows things to be included without eliminating their right to be the things that they are. An ethics extended to things, or in other words, a different kind of ethics that allows us to let things be, as Introna (2009) puts it with reference to Heidegger's (1966) concept of Gelassenheit or "releasement." The concept of Gelassenheit, to let be, is not an easy one to grasp. The very reason may be, however, that Heidegger wanted the term to retain an unknowable segment that hints at its comprehension. Because "mystery," and maintaining an "openness to the mystery" (Heidegger 1966, p. 55), is an important element in understanding or moving towards Gelassenheit. In relation to his discussion of the concept Heidegger distinguishes between "calculative" and "meditative" thinking (Heidegger 1966, p. 46-47), where the former is a way of willful thinking that already expects an outcome, whereas the latter is released from the chains of anticipation, and instead awaits for that which may come towards it. In other words, meditative thinking is an awareness, an attitude, that is open to the mystery of its surrounding; it is challenged but not frightened by things' otherness, and thus open to the possibility of releasement. Rather than a distinct phenomenon Gelassenheit should therefore be understood as a process, an experience or a movement towards the unexpected and unknown—the thing itself; a "releasement towards things" (Heidegger 1966, p. 54). Importantly, this is not a â Springer</page><page sequence="24">600 Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 suggestion of a passive or indifferent attitude, but rather an active but non-intrusive, or rather non-demanding acceptance of things in their otherness—in their remote, mysterious being. Gelassenheit thus entails a different way of valuing and inhabiting the world, a way that undermines "the authority of what is well known, to let be the multidimensionality of what exists and surrounds us as an expanse, a vastness of silent notes" (Dalle Pezze 2006, p. 33). Conclusion In light of dominating archaeological traditions in terms of method, interpretation, and representation my ruin memories from Eyri may appear as unexciting, meaning less or incomplete observations. But then it is important to mention that I did not anticipate discovering anything particularly impressive, but simply saw this as an opportunity to attempt to grasp the banal everyday life of things, on their own—and my trivial encounters with these things, non-things, and nothings. It was not an attempt to excavate things to dissect and get beyond them, but rather an attempt towards an archaeology o/'things. An observation on level with things—and of things as things. As archaeologists we are used to treat our sites as voids. We emphasize our discovery and their being therefore becomes primarily archaeological; the derived product of our scientific skill and interpretation. We retrieve things forgotten and make them archaeologically useful—in order to bring them back to life. But as argued by Fowles (2010, p. 37) in his praise of absence, "we must do away the assumption that every absence in the world is a void in need of being filled." Similarly, we need to acknowledge that there may be other kinds of meaning—meanings that may be inherent to things themselves—and their silence. An observation of things abandoned, therefore, like the ones in Eyri, may help make manifest this face of things themselves. When abandoned or forgotten, things are released from the chains of human utilitarian relations. Thus, it is perhaps in the state of abandoned being, as forgotten things, that aspects of things' ownness and integrity become most immediately present (Olsen 2010, p. 170). Hence, stepping back to observe the abandoned condition, instead of stepping right in to manipulate it archaeologically, can be a way to let things be; a way to acknowledge things as things, and their being-for-themselves. Olivier (2011) has suggested that archaeology is in fact closer to memory than to history, as the things it handles share with memory the qualities of fragmentation and discontinuity. It is an illusion, he argues that things themselves bear witness to cultural history: "Archaeology does not (re)construct a "history before history"; it deals with the material memory of the past that escapes historical consciousness" (Olivier 2011, p. 34). Of course, discontinuity and fragmentation, like ruination and decay, are concepts conventionally understood in a negative way; things are degraded and humiliated through material alteration, while information and knowledge embed ded in them become lost along the way (DeSilvey 2006). If we, however, see archaeological matter as material memory, as ruin memories, this becomes less problematic. For as Olivier (2011, p. 133) argues, memory works in contradicting ways, and "the very process of imprinting memory is directly linked to what has been Spring er</page><page sequence="25">Int J Histor Archacol (2012) 16:577-603 601 forgotten or has vanished. .. .the existence of memory is dependent on absence." The meaning, and the presence effect of my ruin memories, therefore, was not least due to their fragmentation and incompleteness. It was not derived from but rather released through their unknown and mysterious segments; their immediacy and concrete prehistoric context. Ruin memories that were already there and not at all awaiting my interpretation or historization. To conclude with a praise of wonder I would like to concur with the suggestion proposed by Stengers (2011, p. 368) that "just like the Marxist concept of class, materialism loses its meaning when it is separated from its relations with struggle." In other words, it is in that moment of prehistoric wonder, when we struggle to under stand a thing, that materiality manifests itself and its meaning. What we need to do is as simple as it is difficult; to translate that moment into a momentum that endures.
