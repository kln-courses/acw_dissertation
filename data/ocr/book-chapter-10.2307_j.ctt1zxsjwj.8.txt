These issues  include his origin—his own “secret stem,” leading back to Russian  Romanticism—as well as translation as a vehicle for expressing  Nabokov’s own strongly held ideas about art. While Nabokov’s  practice of translation undergoes significant changes in the course of  his career, his adherence to the idea of some “true,” “metaphysical”  language—ever elusive and ever present—remains surprisingly  constant.  In the Foreword to his four-volume translation of Eugene  Onegin, Nabokov defined three modes of literary translation:  paraphrastic, lexical, and literal. Paraphrase is understood as “a free  version of the original with omissions and additions prompted by  the exigencies of form, the conventions attributed to the consumer,  and the translator’s ignorance.”2 Nabokov described this type of  translator in “The Art of Translation” as “the professional writer  relaxing in the company of a foreign confrère.”3 His own English  versions of Aleksandr Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, and Fyodor  Tiutchev, undertaken in Three Russian Poets4 and highly praised  by Edmund Wilson, as well as Nabokov’s translations of Pushkin’s  “Little Tragedies” (the subject of his correspondence with Wilson  in 1940-1941), would fit this category, as would Vasilii Zhukovskii’s  nineteenth-century translations of Friedrich Schiller and Thomas  Gray. This was Nabokov’s point of departure—the Russian tradition  of translation. The other extreme, the lexical translation, serves to  render the basic meaning of words and their order, and is something  a machine “under the direction of an intelligent bilinguist” can  do. “The well-meaning hack”5 is a less than flattering description  of such a translator. Finally, there is literal translation, on which  Nabokov insists. It is the only “honest translation,”6 which entails  “rendering as closely as the associative and syntactical capacities  of another language allow, the exact contextual meaning of the  original.” The literal translator is “the scholar who is eager to make  the world appreciate the works of an obscure genius as much as he  does himself.”7 Linking Nabokov’s preoccupation with “honesty”  — 207 — </page> <page sequence="3"> C o n c l u s i o n to the metaphysical question of truth, Clarence Brown noted: “As  his definition of translation is a compromise between two extremes,  so his translation itself is a compromise between two languages.  It is frankly unsatisfactory—neither one thing nor the other—but  it is the best that under the circumstances and under the sway of  Nabokov’s inexorable principles is possible. The best that is possible  means for him the best that is true. . . .”8  This in-between position is what makes Nabokov’s idiosyncratic  translation and much of his fiction so lucidly mad. The loss of his  native language, along with the necessity to establish his literary  reputation anew in his English-speaking environment, made his life- long engagement with Pushkin more important than ever. As Jane  Grayson wrote, “it was the example of Pushkin’s cultural eclecticism  which helped him maintain his point of balance.”9 Pushkin, as the  quintessential Russian poet, drew indiscriminately from foreign  cultures and, by way of an inexplicable metamorphosis, succeeded  in turning these appropriated sources into something original and  decisively “native.” Nabokov’s contribution to Pushkin studies is  now recognized first and foremost for his investigation of Pushkin’s  multi-cultural eclecticism. Nabokov adopted similar “cross-cultural  reference, intertextuality, [and] multilingual play” as his own artistic  method.10  Pushkin’s cultural eclecticism had its roots in eighteenth-century  Russian cultural developments. It was one of the reasons why  Pushkin’s true—perhaps only—cultural hero was Peter the Great,  who had forcefully transposed European culture onto the resisting  Russian soil. Borrowing and appropriating from elsewhere was  recognized by Peter as discipleship in nation-building. In his case,  the result was a national empire; in Pushkin’s, a national literature.  The attempt of eighteenth-century Russian classicism to “translate”  the whole of European culture into Russian culture, while the very  literary language itself was a work-in-progress, was broad in scope:  from actual texts, to architecture, to fashion. By way of Pushkin,  this strategy of unapologetic borrowing and appropriation became  Nabokov’s artistic makeup—a fully embraced multiculturalism.  An interesting parallel here is that Nabokov’s English itself was  an ongoing work-in-progress. In this sense, Iurii Lotman’s idea of  — 208 — </page> <page sequence="4"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n cultural translation as a translation of a code or a structure,11 rather  than verbal communication of information, is very true in the case  of Nabokov.  However, the Russian classicist tradition of translation also  bore the mark of utilitarianism inherent in that age. Petrine reforms  required first and foremost the translation of “useful” texts— educational, scientific, and military. It was a state project, carried out  under the surveillance and enormous exhortation of the tsar himself.  An unconfirmed story of an eighteenth-century translator who,  having failed to translate a French book on horticulture, committed  suicide, is therefore very characteristic of the project. Mikhail  Lomonosov’s, Antiokh Kantemir’s, and Vasilii Trediakovskii’s  works on literary translation, developed at the end of the eighteenth  century by Nikolai Karamzin’s circle, were spurred by a practical  need for a new, adequate Russian literary language. Fidelity was  understood by a classicist translator in its narrow, practical sense:  only that which in the original was close to the ideal, as seen by  the translator, deserved accuracy. Thus Aleksandr Sumarokov in  1748 translated Hamlet as a conflict between feeling and duty. Most  European literature came to Russia through translations from the  French, and occasionally from the German—which renders the  very idea of authorship problematic. As Nabokov wrote in “The  Servile Path”: “In consequence, Shakespeare is really [Pierre-Prime- Félicien Le Tourneur] Letourneur, [George Gordon] Byron and  [Thomas] Moore are [Amédée] Pichot, [Walter] Scott is [Auguste- Jean-Baptiste] Defauconpret, [Laurence] Sterne is [Joseph Pierre]  Frénais, and so on.”12 A good example, albeit already anachronistic,  would be the translation in 1830 by Aleksandr G. Rotchev, absurdly  entitled “Macbeth. Tragedy of Shakespeare. From the Works of  Schiller.” In a similar vein, the enthusiasm of neo-classical French  criticism for Alexander Pope, for example, and the Russian worship  of the French, especially Voltaire, contributed to the Pope vogue in  Russia even before he was translated. By the same token, because  Voltaire, Denis Diderot, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau had praised  Salomon Gessner’s Idyllen (which were imitations of Thompson)  while remaining unaware of John Milton and Shakespeare, it was  therefore Thompson—not Milton or Shakespeare—who would spur  — 209 — </page> <page sequence="5"> C o n c l u s i o n fifty years of imitations in Russia and prompt Karamzin to call “The  Seasons” “zerkalo natury” (“the mirror of nature”) in his Letters of  a Russian Traveller.13 Filtered through French and German renderings,  Thompson did not so much inspire original Russian nature poetry,  but rather introduced a new sentimental and melancholic worship  of nature that had no specific national characteristics—nature in  the abstract. Edward Young’s “sepulchral philosophy” (by way of  the French translation by Le Tourneur and of German translations  by Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Heinrich von Kleist, both  big influences on Karamzin) brought into vogue the poetics of  melancholy. Thomas Gray’s graveyard poetry further promoted  the sentimentalist/Romantic sensibility and appeared in multiple  Russian renditions, most of them coming into being by way of  a third language. Only by the time Romanticism completely  prevailed over classicism would translations via a third language  become exceptions.  The disparaging view of the function and role of translation in the  new Russian sentimentalist/early Romantic aesthetics is expressed  very explicitly (and derisively) in Novyi Stern (A New Sterne), an 1805  comedy by prince Aleksandr Shakhovskoi. Its hero, Count Pronskii,  becomes so obsessed with Sterne’s sentimentalism that, instead  of going into the military service, he embarks on a journey in the  Russian countryside during which he writes a journal à la Sterne  and scares the Russian peasantry with his apostrophes to nature  and Sterne. He bemoans the death of a “Lady,” who turns out to be  his English dog, and falls for a peasant girl who giggles and thinks  he is speaking in German. When Pronskii’s servant asks where this  sentimental mania comes from, a friend of Pronskii’s father, sent  to rescue the stray youth from this predicament, responds: “It was  formed in England, rehashed in France, exaggerated in Germany,  and came to us in a sorry fate.”14  However, apart from teaching the Russians exaggerated  affectation, sentimentalist and Romantic translation also served  a much more serious purpose. It slowly worked as deferred  action, as Freudian Nachträglichkeit, to generate a new origin. In  his 1912 “Remembering, Repeating and Working Through,” Freud  formulated Nachträglichkeit thus: “There is one special class of  — 210 — </page> <page sequence="6"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n experiences of the utmost importance for which no memory can  as a rule be discovered. These [are] experiences which occurred  in very early childhood and which were not understood at the  time but which were subsequently [nachträglich] understood and  interpreted.”15 Within psychoanalysis, this has to do with the establishment of  meaning, with restoring the link between cause and effect, broken  not because of the failure of causality, but because the patient cannot  recall. The patient is outside the event, and the mental functioning  of the individual is defined not only in terms of causality, but also  by the dichotomy between the inside and the outside—a gap to be  bridged by the analyst.16 “The question of origin is posed within  the field of desire,” writes Andrew Benjamin in Translation and the  Nature of Philosophy.17 If one considers Russian literary translation  in this light, the desire for an origin “necessitates a narrative that  includes and completes.”18 In the “subsequent action” of translation,  reworking places foreign literary experiences within native literary  subjectivity. The nineteenth-century Romantic tradition that  nurtured the Russian school of translation suggested the existence  of an absolute, if unattainable, “ideal” translation. In his theoretical  translation principles, Zhukovskii, the founding father of Russian  Romanticism, was close to the classicist and Karamzinist positions  insofar as the “existence” of the ideal translation was concerned.  The difference was in the understanding of the nature of the  ideal: in classicism it was objective and mimetic; in Romanticism  it was subjective and unattainable. The methods changed along  with the transformation in this understanding. The important  and revolutionary innovations in poetic language (for instance,  the creation of the Russian hexameter and octave, experiments  with rhyme and blank verse in the works of Nikolai Gnedich,  Stepan Shevyrev, Pyotr Kireevskii, Pavel Katenin, and Konstantin  Batiushkov) were brought about in the process of translation.  Pushkin’s translations of André Chénier, Catullus, Anacreon, and  Horace were not just translations per se but also experiments  in genre, understood as a “larger context”19 beyond the “smaller  context” of the original works. Such experimentation allowed  Pushkin, in his translation of the French alexandrine of Chénier,  — 211 — </page> <page sequence="7"> C o n c l u s i o n to alternate between hexameter and iambic meters, or to introduce  rhymes in Anacreon; in other words, to acquaint the nineteenth- century reader with a broad variety of unaccustomed strophic and  metric arrangements.  Novalis, in one of his fragments, identified three types  of translation: grammatical, free [verändernd], and mythical.20  Grammatical translations require only minimal discursive abilities  and have no artistic value. Free translation is understood as a true  Romantic translation. Such a translator “muß der Dichter des  Dichters sein, und des Dichters eigеner Idee zugleich reden lassen”  (“must be the poet of the poet and be able to render at the same  time the poet’s own ideas [and the ideas of the translator]”).21 Free  translation is therefore re-creative and co-creative; the relationship  to the original is as that of a genius of mankind to each individual  man. (Pushkin actually  called translation “re-creation.”) The  general and the whole express itself through the individual and the  particular. Similar ideas of the Romantic aesthetic of the part and  a whole are postulated in Hegel’s Aesthetics.  The ultimate form of translation for Novalis is the “mythical”  translation that recreates not the work itself but its ideal. It is  perhaps significant that Zhukovskii’s programmatic poem had  the title “Ineffable” (1819) and subtitle “A Fragment.” Its central  rhetorical question is: “Is there power to express the Ineffable?”  (“Nevyrazimoe podvlastno l vyrazheniu?”) The ending of the poem  claims that “only silence speaks with clarity” (“I lish molchanie  poniatno govorit”)—a motif that is later passed on to Tiutchev’s  famous “Silentium!”22 Only the metaphysical language (i.e. the  absence of language!) adequately expresses the soul. Zhukovskii’s  French contemporary, Alphonse de Lamartine, in his poem “Dieu”  (published in 1820) similarly juxtaposes the language of “sons  articulés” (“articulate sounds”) and the other language: “l’autre,  éternel, sublime, universel, immense/ Est le langage inné de toute  intelligence.” (“The other [is] eternal, vast, immense, /the innate  language of intelligence”)23 In the 1820s, Romanticism in France  forms into an independent literary movement and, through such  literary journals as La Muse Française, spreads its influence and  shapes new literary tastes in Europe and Russia. — 212 — </page> <page sequence="8"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n Novalis does not provide examples of “mythical” translations;  their helle Spuren (“light traces”), according to him, are found only in  some critical descriptions of works of art. This allows us to identify  the origins of the status of superiority that both Benjamin and  Nabokov attributed to translation as criticism/“scholiastic passion”  as well as the origins of their engagement with the discourse of  “truth.” Benjamin wrote: “If there is such a thing as a language of  truth, the tensionless and even silent depository of the ultimate  truth which all thought strives for, then the language of truth  is—the true language. And this very language . . . is concealed in  concentrated fashion in translation. . . . For there is a philosophical  genius that is characterized by a yearning for that language which  manifests itself in translation.”24 Nabokov’s narrator in The Real  Life of Sebastian Knight, who himself is engaged in a “translation”  project, trying to re-create his brother and his brother’s life, says:  “I sometimes feel when I turn the pages of Sebastian’s masterpiece  that the ‘absolute solution’ is there, somewhere, concealed in some  passage I have read too hastily, or that it is intertwined with other  words whose familiar guise deceived me.”25 While any investigation  of facts is necessarily only a “version” of the truth, what manifests  itself in Sebastian’s writing taunts the narrator with a possibility of  uncovering his brother’s true identity.  Nabokov’s understanding of fidelity in translation is that of  the closest possible approximation to the “absolute solution”—to  the original’s intent rather than that of reproducing the original’s  harmony. Fidelity for Benjamin is also more powerful than mere  communication of sense: “a translation, instead of resembling the  meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the  original mode of signification, thus making both the original and  the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language, just  as fragments are part of a vessel.”26  While Nabokov’s adherence to the profoundly Romantic idea  of a true “metaphysical” language stayed surprisingly constant,  his practice—or his understanding of the nature of the necessary  compromise I have mentioned in Chapter 2—did change over the  years. Nabokov’s translations of Three Russian Poets, published in  1944, follow the Romantic tradition insofar as a free translation  — 213 — </page> <page sequence="9"> C o n c l u s i o n is viewed as a viable re-creation by means of another language.  However, Nabokov’s Romantic approach is closer to that of Pushkin  than Zhukovskii, and this approach would be essential for Nabokov’s  further development, both as a translator and as a writer. The roots  of Pushkin’s Romanticism lay in the French Enlightenment and the  neo-classical tradition of the seventeenth century, not in the German  tradition of Goethe and Schiller. From the Enlightenment Pushkin  inherited his affirmation of rational intellect. Like Pushkin—and  unlike Zhukovskii or Lamartine—Nabokov has no doubts that  language is capable of expressing absolutely everything he wants  or needs to express (Pushkin called his poetic speech “my obedient  words”). Such Romantic juxtapositions as expressible-material  and ineffable-spiritual, dead and alive, particular-individual and  general-absolute, exterior world and inner life, are not central to  Pushkin’s poetic world. In Nabokov’s translations of Lermontov  and Tiutchev, in whose poetry such juxtapositions are present, they  are transformed by Nabokov for his own purposes. For example,  in translating Tiutchev’s famous poem “Silentium!,” itself based on  the juxtaposition of silence as truth and “uttered thought” as a lie,  Nabokov conveys the last eight lines as follows:  Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred: drink at the source and speak no word. Live in your inner self alone within your soul a world has grown, the magic of veiled thoughts that might be blinded by the outer light, drowned in the noise of day, unheard . . . take in their song and speak no word.27 The translation is very close to the original in content (“respect  for the content, if not the form of the original” was postulated by  the mature Romantic movement in opposition to the tendencies to  “improve” or “ennoble” the original, rampant in sentimentalism  and early Romanticism).28  This closeness in content makes the  only instance of seemingly slight change potentially significant:  in Nabokov’s interpretation, the inner world might be disturbed  — 214 — </page> <page sequence="10"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n by the “outer light” and “noise of the day,” not as in Tiutchev— literally—“deafened by the outer noise” and “dissipated by the  rays of the Day.” What gets suppressed in Nabokov’s translation,  whether consciously or unconsciously, is one of the most important  of Tiutchev’s Romantic juxtapositions—that of the Night and Day  (and, by extension, that of chaos and cosmos). A poet in Nabokov’s  interpretation becomes someone self-sufficient, secure in his inner  world, who does not need the world at large. Such a poet can “draw  the curtains,” literally and metaphorically, on the world outside.  Tiutchev’s original, one of the twenty-four poems published by  Pushkin in his literary journal The Contemporary in 1836 as “Poems  sent from Germany,” much more forcefully relates this inner world  to the element of the Night, the primordial chaos of the unconscious.  It would be much more problematic to “draw the curtains” on one’s  unconscious. The adjacent poems of the 1836 selection speak even  more explicitly of the “world of the night soul,” listening to the  “terrifying songs of ancient chaos.”  Since Nabokov’s translations of Three Russian Poets follow the  Romantic mode and are of course rhymed, one might argue that  the change just accommodated the rhyme pattern. Nabokov’s  Romantic translations generally expose the “rather mechanic  nature of rhyming.”29 Prince Pyotr Viazemskii, Pushkin and  Zhukovskii’s friend and contemporary, who was one of the earliest  Russian proponents of literalism in translation, once observed of  free Romantic translations that these “reincarnations of souls from  foreign languages into Russian” were inevitably limited, as they  failed to convey the “soil and climate of their native land.”30 As  early as 1830 he recommended translating verse in terse prose, since  “it is hard to be free in double chains—those of idea and those of  expression,” and claimed that only such exceptions as Zhukovskii  were capable of creating an illusion that they were “walking their  own road.”31 Later Nabokov himself would heed Viazemskii’s  advice.  One might suggest, however, that the nature of Nabokov’s  understanding of translation at the time of Three Russian Poets  allowed for precisely those “reincarnations of souls” and the mutual  fluidity of the two separate processes—that of translation and that  — 215 — </page> <page sequence="11"> C o n c l u s i o n of original creation. Thus Nabokov, who like Pushkin was not as  focused on the juxtaposition of the impotent consciousness and the  primordial unconscious as was Tiutchev, ends up expressing his  own most profoundly held ideas through translation. This becomes  evident when one compares the translation of “Silentium!” to  Nabokov’s own poem of the same year, “Slava” (“Fame”), which  I discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. The poem affirms the  self-contained sufficiency of the writer’s inner world; the night,  now explicitly mentioned, becomes a coded text, but the key  to the code, the means to transcending self, is found in the self  alone—Tiutchev with a Nabokovian twist. As often happens in  Nabokov, the “sign words” in this poem—special “markers” whose  appearance summons particular references—also point back to  Tiutchev. Nabokov’s reference in “Slava” to the immersion in “svoe  kliuchevoe” (italics added; translated into English by Nabokov as  “my wellspring”), the journey that takes the writer along the path  to a metaphysical mystery of self transcendence, derives from  Tiutchev’s “kliuchi” (“fountainhead,” in Nabokov’s translation of  “Silentium!”), from which one ought to drink silently in order to be  truthful to the metaphysical absolute.32 When Nabokov’s views on translation undergo a change, his  anti-utilitarian literalness still remains profoundly Romantic insofar  as its rebellion against classicist “purposefulness” is concerned, just  as is Walter Benjamin’s radical “no poem is intended for the reader,  no picture for the beholder, no symphony for the listener.”33 Much  as it was for Benjamin, the mere transmission of information is  for Nabokov a “hallmark” of a bad translation. Benjamin’s Judaic  tendency toward conceptualizing translation as a cabalistic text is  echoed by Nabokov’s “acrimoniousness toward heretical corruption  of a sacred text.”34 Antoine Berman, in his “Critique, commentaire  et traduction,” brings up the Talmudic tradition, which strives to  preserve the text from that “violation interprétative” which, as  he quotes Tamara Kamenzaian, “l’aurait plongée [la Tora] dans  l’oubli” (“would have plunged it [Tora] into oblivion”).35 In “The  Task of the Translator,” Benjamin writes that all the great texts  contain their translation between the lines, and that “this is true to  the highest degree of sacred writings.”36 Nabokov’s later hostility  — 216 — </page> <page sequence="12"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n to the “inventions” and “self-inventions” of free translators is  paradoxically very much like what Harold Bloom, drawing on  Giambattista Vico, called “the prohibition of the divination” on  which the Jewish religion was founded.37 The notion of Romantic irony, crucial for Benjamin, was  also instrumental for Nabokov in his fiction and translation (in  equal measure) because of its role in foregrounding ironic play,  referentiality, and intertextuality. Romantic irony, as the alternation  or indeed simultaneous coexistence of opposing meanings— faith and skepticism, reality and illusion, the absolute and the  relative—are realized in Nabokov’s oeuvre both through the  radical playfulness of his art and the metaphysical uncertainty at  the core of it. Irony in Nabokov’s work takes on different forms:  the subversive irony of quoting (I referred to this in my analysis of  Nabokov’s poem “On Translating Eugene Onegin”),38 which allows  for a disjunction of meaning between what is stated and what is  intended; the tragic irony of Fate’s relentless power and patterns;  Sophoclean irony, which makes Nabokov’s characters haplessly  ignorant of the web prepared for them by the omniscient author (an  “anthropomorphic deity”); and finally, punning and verbal play, in  which context gives validity to both meanings at once. Although  all of these mechanisms are used in both Nabokov’s “original”  works and translations, Nabokov’s idiosyncratic punning has  a special significance in translation. He often engages not only  in intralingual word play, but also in interlingual play. By doing  this, he draws attention “to the utterance as a piece of organized  language” and “bring[s] about functional syncretism (i.e. the  combination of several functions intersecting in one and the same  carrier).”39  By the end of the nineteenth century in Russia, Romantic free  translation had come to be understood as the leading mode. Imita- tion, a sub-genre widespread at the beginning of the nineteenth cen- tury, had practically disappeared, and “grammatical” translation  (to use Novalis’ term) had become obsolete. Symbolist translation,  an inheritor of the Romantic free translation that had evolved by the  end of the nineteenth century, is especially repulsive to Nabokov.  In many instances he ridicules Konstantin Balmont, who imposed  — 217 — </page> <page sequence="13"> C o n c l u s i o n his own melodious “sweetness” on all translated poets alike—from  Shota Rustaveli to Pedro Calderon de la Barca. In Nabokov’s letters  to Wilson, as well as in “The Art of Translation,” he evokes a gro- tesque episode: Sergei Rachmaninov had asked him to translate  into English a Russian poem that he wanted to set to music. After  a closer inspection it turned out to be Balmont’s translation of Poe’s  “Bells.” Nabokov amusingly entertains the possibility that one day  someone will “come across my English version of that Russian ver- sion” and the poem “will go on being balmontized until, perhaps,  the ‘Bells’ become silence.”40  In many ways Russian modernism reconsidered the rules set  by the Romantic/Symbolist tradition. Nikolai Gumilev’s famous  “commandments for a translator” provide a good example.  According to these commandments, a good translator has to  faithfully render: “1) the number of lines, 2) meter, 3) alternation  of rhymes, 4) character of enjambment, 5) character of rhyme,  6) vocabulary, 7) type of comparison, 8) individual devices, 9)  changes in tonality.”41 Valerii Briusov, though a Symbolist himself,  eventually broke with Symbolist translation and experimented with  literalness. Nabokov tends to constitute his approach as unique, but  it must be noted that Briusov’s literal translation of Virgil’s Aeneid  in many ways anticipated Nabokov’s literalness.42 As a result,  Briusov’s rendering of the structure of Latin sentences in Russian  seems in every way as odd and eccentric as Nabokov’s rendering of  Pushkin’s Russian sentences in English.  Russian Formalism also developed as a reaction against  Symbolist scholarship. In major works such as Boris Eikhenbaum’s  Theory of the Formal Method and Iurii Tynianov and Roman Jakobson’s  “Problems in the Study of Literature and Language,” the Formalists  expanded the boundaries of literary scholarship to include the  extraliterary and introduced a structuralist, systemic approach to  literature and language. While Nabokov obviously does not share  the emphasis of some of the Formalists (such as Eikhenbaum) on  the context of social evolution, he would agree with Tynianov’s  hierarchical literary system—an approach that placed the relation  of a literary text to the norm (convention, social order) at the lowest  level of the system. Nabokov’s relationship with Formalism was  — 218 — </page> <page sequence="14"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n more complex than he cared to admit. “Art as device” was at the  heart of the Formalist controversy over what language is directed  toward—the “real” world or the sign itself? Vladislav Khodasevich,  in his 1937 article “On Sirin,” was first to point out Nabokov’s kinship  to Formalism: “Under thorough scrutiny Sirin proves for the most  part to be an artist of form, of the writer’s device . . . . Sirin does not  hide them [devices] because one of his major tasks is just that—to  show how the devices live and work.”43 Khodasevich also described  Nabokov’s device as close to the Formalists’ ostranenie (estrangement,  defamiliarization): art as deception, composed of simulacra of the  “real world,” but with their nature being diametrically different  from that of the “real.”44 However, a much more profound kinship  is evident in the Formalists’ understanding of the poetic text as  a system of near total correspondence. The work of art is a meta- system, governed by structural laws, in which all formal elements  function in relation to all other intratextual and intertextual  elements. Nabokov’s exercising of a “system of total tyranny”  over the organizational elements of his texts, be these “original”  works or translations, makes the text’s structure a secret “link and  bobolink,” which, paraphrasing his own definition from The Gift,  could explain “everything.” In this sense, Nabokov’s metaphysics  is a metaphysics of a consistent structuralist: his “secret” (the gift)  lies in knowing the hidden structure of the world of a work of art in  its totality, thus making the author decisively parallel to God (who,  supposedly, knows the workings of the hidden mechanism of the  “real” world in its totality).45 Despite Nabokov’s disagreements  with Jakobson, in some ways he comes close to Jakobson’s idea of  the poetry of grammar that he regarded as untranslatable.46 In his  1960 essay, “Poetry of Grammar and Grammar of Poetry,” Jakobson  treats the poetic text as “proto-text” for “the most formalized use  of language,” in which “the suggestive possibilities of language are  exploited fully.”47 Jakobson painstakingly analyzes the grammatical  structures of Pushkin’s poem “I Loved You,” a poem which, lacking  translatable tropes or “interesting” images, relies almost entirely on  grammatical play (the distribution of personal pronouns, the specific  use of adverbs, the near absence of prepositions, etc.). Jakobson’s  conclusion is that even a virtuoso translator “could not help but  — 219 — </page> <page sequence="15"> C o n c l u s i o n reduce to nil” the artistic strength of Pushkin’s “grammatical”  quatrains.48  Nabokov’s rejection of the post-revolutionary developments in  translation, and especially his rejection of the Soviet school, is largely  due to personal reasons, but it also has to do with his aesthetic  aversion to totalitarian mentality. (In light of Nabokov’s formalist  totality, I detect a certain irony here.) I mentioned earlier Nabokov’s  scorn for Soviet commentators as expressed in his Commentary  to Eugene Onegin. The Soviet school of translation rejected the  formalist approach (among other things it gave up the rules of  equalinearity and equametrical arrangement), subjected translation  to the law of consumer-oriented “functional equivalency” (close to  that of Eugene Nida), and regressed back to the nineteenth-century  Romantic notion of fidelity. For obvious reasons, untranslatability  was not an issue for the Soviet school. André Lefevre explains the  dominance of the “normative” practice of translation by the rigid  categories of “right” and “wrong,” instilled for centuries in Europe  and the Americas by institutions such as “the church, the state and  its educational system.”49 Obviously, the state and its educational  institutions in the Soviet Union dominated the thinking about  translation. As Lefevre notes, cultures that “derive their ultimate  authority from a text—be it the Bible, the Qur’an, or The Communist  Manifesto,” are bound to be vigilant about the issues of “norm”  and ideology.50 Nevertheless, translation practice in the Soviet  Union retained Romantic and modernist achievements along with  the culturally established high status of literary translation. This  was due, at least in part, to the forced “self-exile” into the field of  translation of many of the finest Russian writers and poets because  of harsh censorship and the impossibility of publishing their  original work. On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that Nabokov’s trans- lation theory is also at odds with the Poundian influence that large- ly informed Western and especially Anglo-American theory and  practice in the twentieth century. Translation played an important  role in Ezra Pound’s own evolution as a poet. The achievement of  Pound’s translations lay not in comparative poetics but in rethink- ing the nature of an English poem: he was, in T. S. Eliot’s words,  — 220 — </page> <page sequence="16"> V l a d i m i r  N a b o k o v  w i t h i n  t h e  R u s s i a n  a n d  We s t e r n  Tr a d i t i o n s  o f  Tr a n s l a t i o n “an inventor of Chinese poetry for our time” rather than a mere  translator. Drawing on multiple mistranslations of Pound’s—a no- torious conflation of two poems in one title and a large number of  errors—Hugh Kenner argues that many were deliberate. Pound  would dismiss vast commentaries, which could explain obscure  meanings, and instead would summon up the tradition through al- lusions, for the sake of making the poems in English “uncluttered  and self-sufficient.”51 He would counterpose a “focal strangeness”52  to the stance that “correct” is always synonymous with “tradition- al.” A text, a word, means what has been continuously understood  by it, and systematized understanding has always been based on  a long tradition of interpretation. The far-reaching consequences of  Pound’s understanding, as well as of his “mistranslations,” even- tually came to signify the new practice of poetical translation in  general. Pound would be content to “leave it on record that the  Chinese had come to him by way of Japan, as ‘Jupiter’ comes from  ‘Zeus’ by way of Rome.”53 Nabokov’s “servile path” of fidelity in  translation stands in sharp contrast to Pound’s defiant license in  appropriating the classics for the sake of the terseness of his own  poetic word.  Having traced Benjamin’s and Nabokov’s theoretical origins to  their Romantic roots, one cannot fail to notice the vertiginous gap  their approach opens up between theory and practice. Benjamin  posits translation in metonymic contiguity to the original, “just as  a tangent touches a circle lightly” only to pursue “its own course  according to the laws of fidelity in the freedom of linguistic flux” in  perpetual renewal of language.54 The metaphor/metonymy tension  also informs Nabokov’s fiction, endlessly deferring an ultimate  interpretation. It is this tension that makes it so hard to situate  Nabokov’s translation within the Russian and Western traditions.  This becomes especially clear in comparing Nabokov’s translation  theory to the poststructuralist and deconstructionist theories of  language of Paul de Man, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida.  Their double vision of translation—translation that kills the original  and still constantly rewrites it (thus problematizing authorship),  that both manifests and conceals, deferring meaning in the play of  intertextuality—could easily be Nabokov’s vision as well. However  — 221 — </page> <page sequence="17"> C o n c l u s i o n this vision always confronts Nabokov’s Romantic and insatiable  desire for absolute identification, for the “absolute solution.”  Having consciously assumed the “servile path” of “the translator’s  invisibility” (to use Lawrence Venuti’s term), Nabokov nonetheless  thrust himself into the limelight with his Eugene Onegin, forcing  everyone to discuss his amazing translation. Finally, Nabokov’s  understanding of fidelity to the original resulted in “foreignizing  translation in opposition to the Anglo-American tradition of  domestication,” and in his denial of the notion of “abusive fidelity”  that would adjust a foreign text to the dominant cultural discourse  of the target language.55 All this situated Nabokov in the perennial  exile status of “non-citizenship”: between the Russian and English  languages, Russian and Western traditions, and theory and practice.

However, I would like to point out how the stratagem of a chess problem  is related to a “secret”: “The crude might of the queen was transformed with  refined power, restrained and directed by a system of sparkling levers; the  pawns grew cleverer; the knights stepped forth with a Spanish caracole.  Everything had acquired sense and at the same time everything was concealed.  Every creator is a plotter; and all the pieces impersonating his ideas on the  board were here as conspirators and sorcerers. Only in the final instant was  their secret spectacularly exposed” (The Gift, 172; emphasis is mine). “Khod  konia”—“knight’s move,” an expression with a reference to chess, implies  a decisive shift in a struggle, leading to the achievement of the goal (the  revelation of the secret). It is often used by Nabokov to denote the shift in  mimetic correspondence that I described in the analysis of “On Translating  Eugene Onegin.” Chess parallels are important for the Formalists, too.
