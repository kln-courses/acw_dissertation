Bellingham, WA: Western Washington University Press, 2010. These two volumes, the result of a conference held in Paris in 2006, represent a profound sum- mary of historical and anthropological research on „Inner Asia, Central Eurasia or Central Asia" (30:IX), a complex macro-region where Iranian, Turkish, and Mongolian cultures intersect, en- riched by shamanistic, Buddhist, and Islamic elements and cosmologies. Focussing on statecraft and empire in Inner Asia's past and present, the articles thus cover a wide range of topics; their common concern is to explore the different "types and techniques of power representation" (30:2), i. e., power manifestations based on operations of making something present again. Ha- giographical practices, symbols of power, divine kingship, ancestral worship and personality cult, iconodulism, and the politics of cultural memory are some of the key issues addressed in twenty- four chapters discussing such diverse techniques of presenting power as legitimization by descent and tradition, writing reforms, the production of regalia, the redistribution of gifts, the corpor- eal placing and perception of spaces, or the condemnation of memory ( damnatio memoriae). The recognition of proven capabilities, which finds its expression in the retinues acclama- tion to a successful leader, was an essential precondition for the acquisition of political power in the old Khitan, Turkic, and Mongol polities. Yet, Denis Sinor ("1*2011) suggests that noble or supernatural descent, evidence of divine help, as well as competitive selection and elections were also common ways to establish and legitimize power in a manner that resembles similar pro- cesses "in other parts of the world" (30:41). What differs significantly, however, was the manner in which power was confirmed. While in medieval Europe it was the ruler who in the corona- tion ritual provided affirmative answers, thereby expressing his will to respect the rights of those who bestowed the power upon him, in Inner Asia it is the entourage that pledges undivided obedience and elevates the khan-elect onto his imperial seat. The Mamluk commander Baybars, born a military slave from the steppes of the Desht-i Qipchaq, justified the assassination not only of the last Ayyubid sultan Al-Muazzam Turanshah but also of the Mamluk sultan Saif ad-Din Qutuz "as realizing God's will (&lt; qadar )" (30:63), thus invoking a divine decree before he became sultan himself. Lacking noble descent and having committed regicide twice, Baybars soon invented a fictive lineage and performed as a protector of the true faith, in spite of the fact that he was not well acquainted with Islamic culture. This "political legitimacy on Islamic basis" (30:66) resulted, as Denise Aigle points out, in an influ- ential propaganda machinery to produce collective memories that represented Baybars as the eschatological 'last emperor' and saviour of the Muslim community.</page><page sequence="2">Buchbesprechungen 27 1 Islam was used not only for political legitimation in the personal agenda of ambitious rulers but also provided a whole toolkit to reshape rulership and particularly to transform nomadic legacies into sedentary forms of state organization. Ordered conversion in the Mongol successor states in Persia and China to Islam under Ghazan Khan and to Confucianism under Qubilai Khagan represented political solutions to maintain Mongol dominance in an agrarian and bu- reaucratically organized polity. It is, however, interesting to see that "many Confucians and Muslims were eager to assimilate the Mongols not by a model of conversion, but [. . .] of 're- version'", a model that perceived the dynastic founders as "untutored practitioners of the Con- fucian or Islamic religion" (30:95). This model served both sides, as Christopher Atwood's ana- lysis of differing historiographical traditions shows. It helped Mongol rulers and nobles to successfully manage their encounters with more developed civilizations, and may thus be inter- preted as a resource that fostered nativist sentiments and fundamentalist re-orientations. How- ever, by introducing the idea of proto-Confucians (simplicity, authenticity) and proto-Muslims (purity) the model also opened a window of opportunity for an intermediate class of Chinese, Buddhist, Uyghur, Turkish, and Persian followers, clerks, clergymen, and merchants to integrate their own cultural orientations into the new imperial realities. Tellingly, what took shape in Eurasia as Pax Mongolica - whose conceptual emergence, ac- cording to Tseveliin Shagdasürüng (30:357), now needs to be dated to the mid- 13th rather than the early l4thcentury - had started out as a rivalry for political dominance between the two lineages of the Borjigin and Tayici'ut over the Khamag Mongyol confederation in the Onon- Kerülen river region just a century earlier. Both groups show ambivalent relations and, with their mutual preferential marriage (exogamy) and alternations in political succession, traces of dual organization. Tatiana Skrynnikovas etymological investigation into pre-Chinggisid anthro- po-/ethnonymy and its mythological context suggests "that matrilateral kinship, which actually coexisted with the patrilineal system, played a role in the identification practices" (30:136) and that the two groups had originally more in common than is reflected in the historiography of that time which portrayed them as eternal enemies. Highlighting the political and symbolic meanings of seals in Chinese (xi, bao, yinzhang ) and Mongolian ( tamga , paize) cultures, Françoise Aubin compiles a concise history of the utilitarian purposes and ritual usages of imperial seals, their artistic forms, and various modes of represent- ing authority and authenticity. In contrast to the predominantly round forms of ring seals in medieval Europe and the Orient, in ancient China and Inner Asia "they were made of a plaque of bronze, generally square, carved in intaglio" and, in the wake of a wider distribution of silk and paper, "more frequently in relief" after the second century CE (30:162). Their manufacture was supervised by the Board of Rites {Libu) until the end of the Qing empire. In the Mongolian world the tamga was used as a mark of ownership long before the Chinggisid adopted the Chi- nese seal which was then applied simultaneously to variant forms of the 'Phags-pa script. How- ever, the famous paize (gerege) , being already well-known tablets of authority in the Tangut Xia and Jin empires, continued to be used as well. Portrait statues of Mongolian rulers represented another distinguished manner of displaying authority and demanding reverence. Relating these stone statues to the old-Turkic tradition of erecting anthropomorphic Kurgan stelae ( hün culuu ) in the Eurasian steppes, Isabelle Charleux presents a concept where the Chinggisid personality cult appears to be the later stage of a wide- spread ancestor worship, reified as the Ongon cult ubiquitous in the social organization of the Mongol-Turkic pastoral nomads. Anthropomorphic or zoomorphic Ongon figurines were often portable and made of wood and sometimes bronze; thus, they suited the nomadic everyday life</page><page sequence="3">27 2 Zeitschrift für Ethnologie 1 37 (20 1 2) well. Their most obvious link to the two-dimensional portraits of Yuan and later Mongol rulers is their belonging to the same category of 'inhabited portraits', i. e., "images serving as a 'sup- port' for the soul", although their functionality had significantly changed "linking the past so- vereign to the present ruler" (30:216, 243). The Mongol worship of the august spirit' or Vital energy' (. sülde ), which after Chinggis Khan's death became a central part of a rapidly growing cult of the emperor's supramundane forces (or charisma) reified in objects and places, is a striking example for the integration of formerly communal rituals into the service of the state or at least of the latter s elites. Focussing on the imperial-war nine- tail standard (qara sülde, tuy sülde), Sergei Dmitriev shows that the invention of the 'spirit protector' already took place in the military organization shortly after Chinggis Khan's victory over Jamukha. Early forms of this concept are hunt-related and were widespread in Central Asia and Siberia. Not surprisingly, historiographical representations of ruling figures' power and authority do change over time depending on the moment of their compilation - before or after a ruler's rise to power - as well as on the political intentions of their editors and the background of their sources. Taking "the celebrated founding father of the Qing dynasty" (30:261) as a case in point and summarizing recent Manchu studies on Nurhaci, Nicola Di Cosmo discusses the variety of meanings that accompanied the Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese titles attached to the emper- or during the different stages of his rulership. His analysis clarifies that titles (e. g., 'enlightened khan born by heavenly design'), being part and parcel of the Inner Asian reference system of noble naming, are not merely smoke and mirrors from a distant past but helpful to identify traces of political agency from a long-term perspective. When we turn our attention to the much older nomadic 'empires' of Xiongnu and Xianbei, solid historical evidence becomes even scarcer and is thus generally complemented and sup- ported by archaeological data. Introducing recent excavation results from burial sites in the Trans-Baikal region, Nikolai Kradin presents a concise overview oft the socio-political organiza- tion in the two empires combined with fresh conclusions regarding their social stratification. Given the diversity of grave goods in male and female Xiongnu burials, a complex hierarchy becomes apparent - particularly in female burials - indicating various "groups differing in social status" (30:316). However, Kradin frankly admits that even these findings do not throw enough light on the more pressing issues of the political nature (early state or nomadic 'empire') and structure (switch from triadic to dual organisation and vice versa; notions of tribe, chiefdom, and clan-confederation) of the two Inner Asian 'empires'. A different form of political duality, that of 'terrestrial empire' and 'divine inspiration', is treated by Françoise de Polignac by comparing an Arabic version of the 'Alexander romance' with narratives on Al-Khadir (al-Khidr, Khidr), a famous spiritual figure in Islam. Alexander the Great (i. e., Dhu 1-Qarnayn) who, according to the Qur'an, "reçoit de Dieu pouvoir sur la terre entière" (30:343), though only temporarily, appears to be not always the opposite image of Al-Khadir s prophetic (eternal) authority; rather, both figures do complement each other. In the concluding chapter to this volume, David Sneath once more takes the chance to po- pularize his deconstructionist crusade against well-established concepts of kinship society and kinship-based political organization in Central Asia recycling, as he admits, "extracts from the author's book The Headless State " (30:365), which is itself an oxymoron (&lt; contradictio in adjecto ) and a misnomer for acephalous polities indeed. Here I can do no better than refer the reader to the recent reviews by Thomas Barfield (Comparative Studies in Society and History, 2009, 5 1 :4, pp. 942-943), Anatoly Khazanov (Social Evolution &amp; History, 9:2, pp. 206-208), and Peter</page><page sequence="4">Buchbesprechungen 273 Golden (The Journal of Asian Studies, 2009, 68:1, pp. 293-296; 2010, 69:2, pp. 658-663) who expressed well-founded criticism levelled at his many misled and construed assumptions. I will only make one remark with regard to Lawrence Krader (f 1998), who presumably would have raised his voice against Sneath's selective references and blank imputations as to the repro- duction of colonial concepts: Krader did not partake in any "tribal discourse" (30:375) but con- vincingly explained from an ethnohistorical perspective how Mongolian Villages were grouped into clans , and clans further into confederations . It is astonishing to see how a flimsy treatise so badly informed by historico-anthropological sources and ignorant of linguistic studies can at- tract so much attention, but I shall confine my comments here to an old Kalmyk saying - "Aris- tocrats and Dogs don't know anything about kinship" (i. e., they do not care) - penned down by Benjamin Bergmann in 1802. Referencing to ancient rituals, Sedenjav Dulam and Isabelle Bianquis observe the former's re- invention in the service of the state in contemporary Mongolia. As was the case with Chinggis Khan's war standard, the concept of animated objects imbued with Vital energy' (süldé) has again found its place in state rituals today. The animistic belief in mountain spirit masters' (ezen) is, for instance, represented in the cult of Bogd Han, a mountain in the vicinity of Ulaanbaatar that was the object of sacrificial performances on the occasion of the 355th birthday of the capital in 1994 and again in 2004. Official sacrifices to the "black standard on the Burhan Haldun Mountain" (31:41), led by a shaman in the presence of the Mongolian President in 1995 and 2001, are further examples of political intentions to gain fresh power from old symbols in times of rapid change. As shamanism became much in vogue in Central Asia since the 1 990s, other forms of tradi- tional belief also came to the fore in the process of post-socialist nation and identity building. In Kyrgyzstan and some Turkic speaking republics of the Russian Federation, this reorientation to what was perceived as a value-adding past fostered a Tengrist movement (from old Turkic tärjri , 'sky', 'heaven'), a "revivalist ideology in the arenas of both religion and nationalism" (31:56). Aurèlie Biard and Marlène Laruelle suggest that in contrast to present-day rituals in Mongolia, 'Tengrism' in Kyrgyzstan is nothing more than a newly 'invented tradition' of cultured urban elites and ambitious politicians. Just as seems to be the case with Zoroastrianism in Tajikistan, shamanism in Buryatia, and neo-paganism in Russia, 'Tengrism' moreover appears to be an opt- out ideology for those who seek alternative identities to 'rediscovered' Islam, Buddhism, and Eastern Orthodoxy, all of which are state favoured belief systems that again reveal tendencies of centralisation, unification, and control. As the preceding chapters give the impression that Mongolia's post-socialist elite made prop- er use of cultural heritage to produce new ideological legitimacies, one is not surprised to see this idea further supported by Gregory Delaplace and Françoise Aubin. Following Katherine Verdery's study on Political Lives of Dead Bodies , the two authors deal with funerals of political leaders, particularly the reburial of General Sühbaatar and Marshal Choibalsan ("j" 1952) whose mummified bodies, unlike Lenin's still resting in his mausoleum in the Red Square, were taken out in 2005 "during the night [...], without the press and with no witnesses" and transferred to a "cemetery in the suburbs" (31:97). It is obvious that Marshal Choibalsan's dead body, brought back down to earth and deprived of his charisma, had to make way for the resurrection and veneration of another dead body, that of Chinggis Khan, in an act of replacing the historical memory of the Stalin-like state creator by that of the empire's founder. Focussing on people/landscape relations in Buryat communities of the Khentii aimag in Northeast Mongolia, Rebecca Empson elaborates on contrasting developmental concepts of 'growth'. While Buryat individuals and shamans either invest labour in land (gazar) or interact</page><page sequence="5">274 Zeitschrift fïir Ethnologie 137 (2012) with it culturally and thus "claim that land grows because it encloses' or temporarily 'houses' people", promoters of a national park who are investing state money conclude that growth is rather to be achieved by "creating enclosures that exclude people" (31:124). The power of la- bour and capital is represented here by the establishment of new categories of legal and illegal occupations resulting in various strategies of land nostrifìcation. The very process of replacing icons of national identity as an expression of politico-ideolo- gical changes in post-socialist countries, which brought Mongolian elites - as we have just seen - to substitute Choibalsan by Chinggis Khan, is discussed by Roberte Hamayon with regard to Buryatia's changing status in Russia, and again Chinggis Khan emerges victorious (at least on a multi-facetted calendar from 2002). But this time it was not a revolutionary hangman who had to quit the scene but epic hero Geser Khan, an integrative and all-Mongolian, if not all-Inner Asian, figure promoted by Buryat intellectuals "as emblem of the Republic" (31:150) since the early 1990s. Having been territorially fragmented under Stalin and facing new challenges with Putin's political restoration, the question for Buryatia is how much cultural (not political) iden- tity can be claimed and which re-orientations will be expressed in the future. Considering the question of how the Qing empire dealt with its many nationalities, the next chapter discusses the Manchu way of indirectly ruling newly acquired territories and peoples in In- ner Asia, most of which were governed through the "Board of Managing the Non-Chinese Popula- tion" (Lifanyuan, SSIK)- Focussing on the Urad Front (West) Banner of today's Inner Mongolia, Caroline Humphrey meticulously illustrates that besides military service and loyalty to the imperial court, membership to a noble lineage that could trace its descent from either Chinggis Khan or, as was the case with Urad aristocracy, from his younger brother Khabutu Khasar, was a key argument to maintain nested sovereignty' even in 19th century imperial China. The relationship between ruler and lama, in Tibetan-Mongolian concepts generally depicted as a patron-client dyad, turned out to be extremely close in this small polity even though it was Qing strategy "to keep religious and political powers separate" - a policy repeatedly supported by edicts that "forbade the findings of religious reincarnations in ruling families" (31:194). By echoing the emperor's role as grace-giving Manjushri but at the same time ensuring that the aristocracy would not ally themselves with Buddhist clergy but rather limit political identity to worldly concepts of power {erke) and force (kiicii), this policy thus provided the nobles with yet another means to express independence. For some Central Asian and Caucasian states post-socialist independence was and still is maintained by a certain degree of dependence on foreign funding institutions and NGOs, the vast majority of which are Western-financed, lined up to implement or safeguard civil society'. While Kyrgyzstan and Georgia are good examples of this political antagonism, resource-rich countries such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan are more likely not, and still others depend on Russia even today (Armenia, Byelorussia). Taking Kyrgyzstan as a case in point, Sve- tlana Jacquesson shows which tools and strategies were developed in this contradictory context by a weak political elite to strengthen state authority. In the search for fresh but at the same time widely accepted integrative representations, national identity building initially followed the common model by portraying the epic hero Manas (like Geser in Buryatia, Dzhangar in Kalmy- kia, and Chinggis in Mongolia) as the new virtue-inspiring leader of the nation. However, such attempts to arrange and control the paradigm shift were soon challenged by bottom-up concepts drawing "upon the authority of the ancestors and on pride in descent and genealogy [. . .] cap- able of downplaying both state and nation" (31:241). Post-socialist nation building has seen many forms of 'invented traditions', the renaissance of all kinds of previously forbidden belief systems, and the formation of social groups and new</page><page sequence="6">Buchbesprechungen 27 5 elites whose political legitimatization was frequently based on sufferings in Communist times. Hence, generating memories of past injustice became a powerful tool for self-integration and for imaginations of loss. For Northern Mongolian Darhads, where shamanism was always strong and purges of the 1 930s left scarcely anything of Qing-influenced Buddhist traces, Morten Axel Petersen reports that this imagination is strong enough to project people's spirituality onto "a Virtual temple' which is continuously constructed from people's bitter-sweet memories of the golden age of Buddhism in the late nineteenth century" (31:246). The manner in which present-day nomadic societies are confronted with the challenges of global warming, desertification, neo-liberal economy, and modern lifestyle is presented in a brief contribution by Linda Gardelle comparing adaptation strategies of pastoral nomads in Mongo- lia with those of Tuareg herders in Mali. Given the Mongols' strong "attachment to the state" (31:260), nomadism, which occupies a large sector of the country's economy, seems to have a bright future in Mongolia whereas the Tuareg, being a Berber minority and marginalized in many ways, rely on meagre means to maintain their traditional economy. Given Mongolia's strong tradition of pastoral nomadism and the leading role of Buddhist clergy in the past, it is not surprising that urban development of Ulaanbaatar from "a religious settlement into a modern capital city" (31:270) began late, flanked by the industrialisation pro- gram of the 1930s. The modernisation drive, as Ai Maekawa informs us, turned hundreds of monasteries into factories, offices, schools, and museums, and thousands of monks into workers. Modern urbanity and architecture (with newly built cinemas for propaganda screenings) were thus heavily influenced by socialist, more precisely Moscow-oriented, perceptions of the new world order, the 'new man', and the new city'. Analysing Mongolian wedding rituals preserved in texts of early 20th-century folklore wed- ding literature and focussing on kinship terminology, Rodica Pop shows how one of the most comprehensive collective terms, "töröü' describing the exogamous unit (otog - clari) in Kalmyk, Buryat, and Khalkha social organization, is etymologically related to "tör" (rule, principle, order) and "later came to mean also 'state, regime, government,' among Mongol ethnic groups" (31:293). Pointing out the many features that make one clan distinct from another and discuss- ing the clans' two hemispheres of patrilineal (yasun - bone) and matrilineal ( makhan - flesh) descent she adds evidence to the kinship- and clan-based structure of a medieval and early mod- ern past that later became transformed into the affinity-centred perception of a modern nation composed of lineages and alliances. In the concluding chapter, Ü. Hürelbaatar and David Sneath give a short account of Ulan- hu's (Wulanfu, *1906 fi 988) political biography that illustrates the changing attitude in the national minorities policy of the People's Republic of China. Once Mongolian aspirations to political identity were broken and a controlled system of rotating positions for the IMAR was installed, forms of cultural identity became more tolerated. Illustrating this shift in policy, the following section is dedicated to the Mongol novelist and poet Injannashi (Injinash, *1837 f 1892) whose writings are famous for their social criticism and patriotic ideas, which earned him (though post mortem) a celebrated place "in the new ideology of Mongolian Nationality [. . .] within the Great Family of Nationalities [. . .] of the New China" (31:330). The essays under review, the majority of which have a focus on Mongol-related topics, are a striking example of the benefits of continuity thinking in socio-cultural research on Central and Inner Asia, though their sequential arrangement and the criteria applied to the inclusion of con- tributions remain arguable. Combining a palmful of closely related disciplines (linguistic and literary studies, history, archaeology, social anthropology), the two volumes give long-term per-</page><page sequence="7">276 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 137 (2012) spectives on political and socio-cultural processes with relevance to present-day developments and explain complex phenomena that are hard to understand if approached from a presentisi point of view.
