<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALLEGORICAL AGENCY AND THE SINS OF ANGELS BY ANDREW ESCOBEDO This essay seeks to re-describe the relationship between personi fication and agency?taking John Milton's Paradise Lost as a primary example?and in the process offer some insights into our conventional ideas about the agency of literal characters in narrative.1 Commentators have usually treated personification as a figure of volitional limitation or stasis: Angus Fletcher's obsessed persona, Paul de Man's trope freezing anthropomorphism, J. Hillis Miller's stone-derived Galatea, Gordon Teskey's captured material, or Steven Knapp's fanatically self absorbed agent.2 These accounts have great merit?personifications do sometimes operate as reduced, immobilizing, or self-canceling agents. Yet it is important to remember that no commentator before the eighteenth century spoke of prosopopoeia in this manner.3 The emphasis on stasis thus appears to derive in part from a modern bias for psychologically mimetic, well-rounded characters, in comparison to which personifications appear narrow or flat. This modern association of verisimilar character with agency owes at least a small debt to post-Renaissance interpretations of Milton's Satan, whose psychological depth and dramatic autonomy the romantics frequently interpreted as exemplary of the sublime will. This stance reveals a complex attitude toward agency, yet, whether these post-Re naissance writers regarded the sublime will as desirable or hopelessly implausible, personification regularly functioned as a related but op positional figure whose mechanical artifice could only parody actual human volition.4 This view sometimes persists in modern criticism of romantic literature. In his discussion of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey's The Fall of Robespierre (1794), for example, Wil liam Jewett discusses the play's allusions to the speeches of Milton's Satan in terms of the "Miltonic sublime," which represents an agency of absolute self-possession. For Jewett, the play ironizes this ideal agency through the presence of allegory: "the attribution of agency to the personification 'Peace' tends to qualify the hitherto undoubted agency of mimetic characters, who may now themselves seem to congeal into abstract personifications of their leading traits."5 Allegory here forecloses Miltonic agency, and the word "congeal" points to ELH 75 (2008) 787-818 ? 2008 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 787</page><page sequence="2">the assumption that personifications are vitiated versions of mimetic characters, colder and less vital. Yet when Renaissance commentators discuss prosopopoeia, they do not talk about static or flat characters; instead, they follow the ancient rhetoricians in emphasizing the act of animation, the vitalization of non-living or non-reasoning things with living attributes and person hood. George Puttenham writes that poets use prosopopoeia when they "attribute any human quality, as reason or speech, to dumb creatures or insensible things, and do study (as one may say) to give them a human person."6 Henry Peacham likewise describes the trope as "when to a thing senseless and dumb we fain a fit person," attributing to it "speech, reason, and affection." By means o? prosopopoeia, Peacham explains, the poet temporarily reverses the effects of mortality: "sometime[s] he raiseth again as it were the dead to life, and bringeth them forth complaining or witnessing what they knew." Indeed, he insists that prosopopoeia is the last, best defense of a besieged orator, "not unlike to a champion, having broken his weapons in the force of his conflict, calleth for new of his friends ... or to an army having their number diminished, or their strength enfeebled, do crave and call for new supply."7 Personification, for these commentators, is energy. Even in post-Renaissance art we can still sometimes glimpse this sense of energy. Consider Eugene Delacroix's 1830 painting "Liberty Leading the People," a work commemorating the July Revolution (see figure 1). Lady Liberty, breasts bared, holding the French Flag in one hand and a musket in the other, urges a peasant army of ill dressed men, women, and children over the fallen bodies of Bourbon soldiers. She fights along with the peasant-citizens, integrated into the historical scene, but her idealizing iconography makes her more than just another literal figure: she is also the mental projection of their political aspirations of progress. Here we have a personification that is a vital and expansive realization of the people s historical agency, a figure who breaks through the constraints of historical inertia. Looking back at Lady Liberty's ancestors in medieval and Renais sance allegory, we can find a similar sort of volitional energy.8 To whatever extent personifications act out of compulsion, their other ness to the story in which they appear also potentially liberates them from ordinary narrative constraint. They thus represent, as we will see, an agency radically divided between causality and freedom. Ex ploring this allegorical agency allows us understand the limits of the deliberative will that we associate with literal characters, who produce the impression of free agency not so much by resembling real people 788 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1. Liberty Leading the People, Eugene Delacroix, 1830, Louvre Museum. as by accepting a compromise with narrative determinism. I intend to explore these issues first by examining a decidedly non-allegorical figure, Milton's Satan, who makes the most perplexing choice in the history of literature, and then by looking at the appearance of the most peculiar character in the poem, Milton's Sin. I. MILTON'S ANGEL When does Milton's Satan first choose to rebel in heaven? We first meet him in hell, of course, when Paradise Lost opens, and it is not until Raphael's flashback in book 5 that Milton dramatizes the initial emergence of angelic rebellion. In this earliest chronological view of him in the poem, he is not yet called Satan, and having just witnessed the Father's exaltation of the Son, he is "fraught /With envy against the Son of God."9 "[F]raught with envy": this does not sound good. Does feeling envy count as rebellion; has he already fallen? At first glance, it seems unlikely that an Unf?llen angel would experience wicked feelings in heaven, where no provocations to evil exist. Making the angel already fallen before we see him would allow Milton to avoid Andrew Escobedo 789</page><page sequence="4">the awkward representation of a super-intelligent creature inexplicably believing he could defeat God in battle.10 If the angel has made his evil choice before Raphael's narrative begins, then we can read the episode as a celebration of the loyal angels, such as Abdiel, who can serve as heuristic models for Adam, Eve, and Milton's readers. Milton would have been prudent to arrange his poem in this way. His contemporaries regularly expressed their bewilderment at why an angel, a divinely rational being, untouched by original sin, in the manifest presence of God in heaven, freely chose to rebel against his maker. The fall of Lucifer was even more mysterious than the fall of Adam and Eve, since Eve at least had the tempting serpent, and Adam had Eve.11 Richard Baker's series of incredulous questions typifies Re naissance accounts of the war in Heaven: "But how could Lucifer fall, that had such stays to hold him up? . . . But how could Lucifer fall, that was an Angel? . . . Lucifer, why wouldst thou fall, when thou mightst have stood?" Likewise, the angelic chorus in Hugo Grotius's Adamus Exul (1601) asks the fallen Lucifer, "Why would you, rushing to your own destruction, refuse to submit to the Creator of things; why, when so high a status had already befallen you, would you vainly aim for higher things?" Thomas Heywood, trying to imagine the circumstances of angelic rebellion, wonders of the angels why, "if they were / In Time before Time was, and with sincere / Faith and Obedience had so long abode, / They only then revolted from their God?"12 These expressions of puzzlement hint at the extent to which the question of when the angel chose to rebel is bound up with the ques tion of why he rebelled. What event or sequence of events prompted his disobedience? Stella Revard has surveyed pre- and early-modern theological and literary explanations, which point variously to the creation of humans, the promise of the Son's incarnation, or (Milton's preference) the exaltation of the Son.13 Yet nearly all of these com mentators recognize that further explanation is required, since these precipitating events did not prompt all the angels to rebel, only a third of them. What moral deficiency made Lucifer susceptible? The most popular answer was pride. Heywood describes Lucifer "swelling . . . with pride and envy," and Baker wonders "how could such pride enter into the mind of Lucifer?"?as if "pride" itself entered into Lucifer or that he himself was pride's embodiment.14 Milton's Raphael mentions envy in his account, but also states that the rebel angel "could not bear / Through pride that sight" (PL, 5.664-65) of the Son's exaltation, and the narrator notes at the opening of the poem that the rebel angel's "pride / Had cast him out from heaven" (PL, 1.36-37). Pride carries a 790 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="5">considerable burden in these passages, serving as the motivating force behind Lucifer's otherwise puzzling choice. Baker, Heywood, and Milton probably derive pride as an explana tion of angelic sin directly or indirectly from Augustine's City of God, which contains one of the earliest and most influential Christian re sponses to this perplexing issue. Yet its chapters devoted to Lucifer's fall supply less of an explanation than has often been claimed, since Augustine himself clearly states that pride describes, but did not cause, the rebel angels' evil choice.15 For him, the language of causation can never succeed in accounting for free will: "nothing causes an evil will, since it is the evil will itself [ipsa] which causes the evil act."16 Strictly speaking, volition "itself" has effects, but never causes. Certainly, in his later polemic with the Pelagians Augustine would emphasize the deleterious influence of original sin and wicked habit on the otherwise free will, but these involuntary dispositions post-date, and thus are irrelevant to, Lucifer's choice to rebel in heaven. For Augustine, then, pride cannot be a miasmic presence influenc ing Lucifer from the outside nor a daemonic presence possessing him from the inside. To explain pride in this manner would oblige us to conclude in Manichaean fashion that "the Devil has evil as the essential principle of his being."17 Free will thus prevents Lucifer from devolving from a responsible moral agent into what?in literary terms?we have come to think of as allegorical personification (such as Pride), which presumably has no agency and therefore no culpability. Anne Ferry, in her influential study of Paradise Lost, made much the same point about Lucifer's agency four decades ago: "We cannot reduce the fallen Archangel as we are first made to see him to an abstraction?Pride or Wrath or Despair or even Evil?because we . . . must feel that his actions did in fact transform our own history."18 Lucifer can serve as an agent of postlapsarian history, but the motivation of his own choice remains unspoken. The alternatives seem undesirable: to represent the angel's choice as free but incomprehensible or to explain it as an (almost allegorical) expression of Pride, which nullifies its agency.19 All of this militates, again, in favor of the view that Milton, so Augustinian in so many ways, has the rebel angel's moment of choice predate the earliest chronological moment of Paradise Lost. When did Lucifer fall? Don't ask, don't tell. This arrangement makes such good sense that it is curious that so many elements in the rebellion episode specifically, and in the poem generally, contradict it. For one, Milton seems to go out of his way to have Raphael insist that the envious angel is called Satan now, at Andrew Escobedo 791</page><page sequence="6">the time of Raphael's speaking to Adam, but not when he first felt envious in heaven. A fallen angel ought to have a fallen name, one would think. Then there is the unusual nature of Milton's heaven, which gives evil desires considerable range before they incur divine wrath. Angels entertained bad thoughts well before the uprising, and perhaps even before the exaltation of the Son: Mammon coveted the gold pavement "even in heaven" (PL, 1.680), and Satan?according to Gabriel?secretly dreamed of supplanting God even as he hypo critically worshipped him.20 Milton describes these wicked habits of thought with language that makes them sound like ongoing activities in heaven. We could speculate that Milton wished to present a scenario in which lots of fallen angels inhabited heaven long before the rebel lion, but this arrangement severs the link between fallen behavior and God's response to such behavior. It seems less bizarre to assume that angels can experience less than virtuous feelings and remain Unf?llen provided they do not act on them. The angel's initial envy, then, does not necessarily constitute evidence of his fallen nature. There is also the related problem of the involuntary nature of envy: Milton's angel did not choose to feel envious (even angels presumably cannot choose their immediate feelings). His moral agency would come into play?so we might expect?only when he chooses how he will respond to this feeling of envy. Certainly, in another poem we might overlook this matter and say that envious people get what they deserve, but we cannot say this in Paradise Lost. "Freely we serve," Raphael tells Adam, "Because we freely love as in our will / To love or not: in this we stand or fall" (PL, 5.538-40).21 In Milton's heaven, the angels do not serve out of habit or nature, but rather actively choose to stand or fall.22 The possibility of such ongoing insecurity in heaven nauseated Augustine, who insisted that after the expulsion of the rebel angels it would be "intolerable to suppose that the holy angels are now uncertain of their bliss, and that they themselves are left in ignorance about their future."23 What Augustine finds intoler able Milton sees as the guarantee of angelic virtue. An involuntary inclination, in this view, cannot count as a choice, and sin (anomia, law-breaking) only emerges through choice.24 "Evil into the mind of god or man /May come and go, so unapproved, and leave / No spot or blame behind" (PL, 5.117-19), Adam assures Eve. Paradise Lost is a poem in which the metrical caesura in the line describing Eve's hand "Forth reaching to the fruit, // she plucked, she eat" (PL, 9.781) maintains the threshold between intention and choice?"all was lost" (PL, 9.784) only after Eve chose. The envious angel has not crossed this threshold yet. 792 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="7">If the angel is not yet Satan when we first see him, then the epi sode bears the burden of dramatizing his fall. In order to appreciate the narrative challenge that the commitment to free choice places on Milton, it is worth digressing for a moment to consider another seventeenth-century account of the war in heaven. We do not know if Milton read the work of the Dutch dramatist Joost van den Vondel, but in any case VondeFs Lucifer (1654) offers an illuminating set of similarities and contrasts. Like Milton, Vondel has no interest in treat ing Lucifer as an allegory of Pride or Evil, making him instead a quite verisimilar character.25 Yet, unlike Milton, Vondel provides several compelling reasons for angelic discontent: Adam and Eve get to have sex whereas the angels do not; it is rumored that "man threatens to displace [them]" (L, 15); and Gabriel announces that humankind will be "preferred to Angels even" (L, 16), with the angels taking on extra guard duty to protect the humans. By the time Lucifer complains, in act 2, that man "usurps our birthright for his own" (L, 20), he is sim ply adding to previous angelic commentary. The other angels in fact actively try to persuade him to lead the insurrection, and his decision to rebel appears to derive in part from the exhortations of his fellows. These narrative details suggest the degree to which Vondel seeks to make angelic sin psychologically and literally intelligible, even if it means jettisoning the pretense of super-intelligent angels who would intuitively understand the futility of opposing God. Yet Vondel weaves into the fabric of narrative plausibility a series of dramatic choices made by Lucifer. The storyline does not push the archangel off the cliff?he must jump off it himself, and the loyal angels remind him of this fact. In act 4, prior to the battle, when the vacillating Lucifer laments, "No good being sorry now ... It is too late," Vondel is careful to have Raphael reply, "There is! I'll mediate; I warrant you that mercy shall be found" (L, 55). Lucifer in fact actively chooses to rebel repeatedly in the play: at the end of act 2, when he resolves to "hoist my Throne to Heaven's highest place" (L, 25); at the end of act 4, when, after prolonged and anguished indecision, he gives the order to attack: "I give it . . . follow me!" (L, 56); and even after the battle, in act 5, when the victorious Michael, standing over the supine Lucifer, offers one more chance to repent. Lucifer again chooses to fight on, and is finally cast into hell, his physical counte nance changed from angelic to monstrous. (If there is any significant personification allegory in Lucifer it is here, when this new pros?pon, this imposed face or mask, marks the evacuation of the angel s literal agency into a symbolic form of Pride or Evil.) Until this final moment, Andrew Escobedo 793</page><page sequence="8">Lucifer's choices may seem to curiously lack definitive consequences but Vondel's apparent intention is to create an effect of dramatic and lengthy process.26 The archangel is confronted with a narrative cir cumstance, deliberates, and chooses a path, which leads him to a new circumstance, requiring deliberation, a new choice, and so on?each time coming closer to the point of no return. This narrative structure preserves the impression of Lucifer's free agency while making his evil decision psychologically comprehensible. Returning to Milton, we might conclude that he likewise opts to describe the angel's transformation as a slow process, perhaps begin ning with the feeling of envy and culminating at some later point, such as the start of the angelic war in book 6. Milton does provide hints throughout Raphaels narrative that the envious angel is gradually moving toward rebellion before he openly broaches the subject with his followers. He "resolved /With all his legions to dislodge and leave / Unworshipped, unobeyed, the throne supreme" (PL, 5.668-70), and later God scornfully notes that "a foe / Is rising who intends t'erect his throne / Equal to ours throughout the spacious north" (PL, 5.724-26), with "foe" punning on the Hebrew meaning of Satan's name. Later, Raphael refers to the discontented angel as "Satan" twice before the end of book 5 (PL, 5.743, 756); and he reminds the angel of his peril by saying that "pardon may be found in time besought" (PL, 5.848). Such moments in the episode create an (admittedly perilous) space of ethical suspension between intention and choice: the point of no return looms somewhere ahead, presumably getting closer and closer. John Leonard nicely captures this diffuse sense of volition when he suggests that Milton handles the rebel angel's transformation from un-fallen to fallen "smoothly and unobtrusively. We cannot see the change happen before our eyes, but we can, with Raphael, say that it has taken place."27 Yet comparison with Vondel also helps us see what Milton does not do: he provides no series of distinct choices that actively cooperate with the downhill narrative incline from Lucifer to Satan. Vondel's angel repeatedly makes choices that, if not individually definitive, nonetheless dramatize a powerful will. In Milton's version, by contrast, we see no distinct moment in which the angel decides to rebel. Indeed, in this episode we have oddly little access to his interior thought, compared to the open and fascinating window into Satan's mental life that the poem provides elsewhere. Milton in fact makes it hard even to say what the angel's intentions are. Does the fact that he "resolved" (PL 5.668) to march north, and does his ambiguous midnight communication to 794 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="9">his lieutenant about "new counsels" (PL, 5.681), definitively indicate that he plans to rebel in the future? God does later ridicule the angel's intention to erect a rival throne, but Milton never lets the angel himself express this intention.28 Even when Raphael mentions that the rebel angel renames his palace as the "Mountain of Congregation" (PL, 5.766)?essentially a public declaration of war?Raphael curiously defers the precise moment of renaming: "not long after" (PL, 5.762) the host reaches the north. Likewise, Abdiel's later offer of "pardon" could mean either that the angel has not yet definitively chosen (since he could still take it back and gain forgiveness) or that he already has (since only criminals need pardons).29 Even the angel's "haughty" (PL, 5.852) response to Abdiel's warning does not seem like deliberate choice, but rather indicates a mind already made up, predetermined by the earlier series of events and inclinations. These ambiguous signals make it hard to say at any given moment in the episode whether the angel has already fallen or if the fall is still to come. This absence of inner deliberation and distinct choice is surpris ing, since it risks giving the impression that the narrative sequence compels Milton's angel to rebel. The angel's initial involuntary envy, we might conclude, sets off a chain of mental and narrative events that lead almost irresistibly to sin. Again, some poems, such as The Faerie Queene, depend precisely on this ambiguity between intention and choice, but not Paradise Lost. Milton carefully separates Eve and Adam's dramatic deliberation from their subsequent choice to "freely taste" (PL, 9.988). Why is the narrative in heaven so different? One reason that Milton declines to give his angel a series of choices, as Vondel did, may be that for him a moral choice counts as such if it has definitive and clear consequences. Adam, Eve, Samson, and the Lady in Confins do not make multiple moral choices that follow a gradual process?they each make one choice, one that counts for everything.30 This follows from the manner in which Milton refuses to see gradual degrees of error but rather, as Gordon Teskey has described, "forces the concept to either side of a distinction between evil and good."31 We should perhaps therefore expect that the movement from Lucifer to Satan will involve, for Milton, crossing a definite threshold, rather than, as for Vondel, following a gradual degeneration. The problem then with the interpretation of the angel's fall as smooth and unobtru sive is that it diffuses the distinct moment of choice into an obscure narrative sequence. If we return to the Raphael's narrative flashback with this notion of a single, crucial choice in mind, can we locate a precise moment Andrew Escobedo 795</page><page sequence="10">of decision? Not a decision to rebel, perhaps, but this raises a prior question: what counts as sin in heaven? Augustine, the scholastics, and John Calvin?despite important differences?all agree that Lucifer sought to end his dependence on his maker. If sin in heaven amounts to claiming autonomy from God, then we can locate it in the rebel angel's reply to Abdiel: We know no time when we were not as now; Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised By our own quickening power, when fatal course Had circled his full orb, the birth mature Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons. (PL, 5.860-64) The rebel angel asserts his self-creation, and saying it presumably counts as choosing it. Here we have, perhaps, the moment of sin, the threshold at which the angel-who-will-be-Satan becomes Satan. As partial confirmation, we might note that immediately after this speech Abdiel stops debating with the angel, telling him that "I see thy fall / Determined" (PL, 5.878-79)?which we could plausibly read as "you have just determined your own fall." Milton also emphasizes the perceived freedom of the angel's assertion by declining to include prior events or statements leading up to it. That is, we hear about the rebel angel's envy, pride, and sense of displacement, but nothing that specifically prepares us for his claim of autogenesis. When Abdiel argues that the Son created the angels we no doubt expect the rebel angel to dispute this, but Milton has him take the additional step of asserting self-creation.32 Along these lines, Philip J. Gallagher sees the freedom of this sinful claim to lie precisely in its disconnection from temporal or narrative contexts. For him, no relation exists between the rebel angel's earlier cognitive activity and his eventual choice; or, at least, no relation that matters. Gallagher wants to justify Milton's representation by making the will radically free from prior cognition: "Volition does not deliberate in time; it chooses in a moment." Choice, in this view, eschews impinging circumstance, and Gallagher will not even allow the angel's initial envy to be more than a "distant occasion" for his later execution of will.33 Such an account secures the Miltonic ethic of choice and identifies a precise threshold between Unf?llen and fallen. Yet the radically free and distinct nature of the angel's choice brings us back to an earlier question: why does the angel choose to sin? Emphatic volitional free dom appears to come at the cost of narrative intelligibility. Outside of narrative, it may be possible to think of choices as freestanding, 796 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="11">instantaneous events, in the way that Gallagher describes. But, within narrative, events impinge on one another, encouraging us to under stand an action in terms of those that precede it. To say, then, that in Paradise Lost the rebel angel's choice is an absolute threshold between Unf?llen and fallen, untouched by earlier circumstances, obliges us to assign an unsustainable neutrality to Raphael's narrative. It obliges us, among other things, to treat as curiously insignificant all the signals that earlier hinted at the angel's degenerating moral status?his envy, his identification as "Satan," God's pun on "foe," and so on?details that draw the moment of choice back into the entangling narrative process. Even the seemingly simultaneous options facing the angel?to deny or affirm his creaturely status?possess a temporal aspect, since an option's legibility must partly depend on its link to past events. The angel's initial envious disinclination to acknowledge the authority of the Son makes it possible for us to understand what is at stake when he chooses to assert his self-creation. To un-yoke the involuntary envy from the later voluntary announcement risks turning deliberate choice into an inexplicable, arbitrary whim. One commentator, although de fending the cogency of Miltonic free will, significantly calls the angel's choice "bizarre."34 To recap, we have at least three ways of interpreting Milton's pre sentation of the rebel angel in Raphael's narration: 1) he has already fallen before the episode begins; 2) he gradually becomes fallen over the course of episode; 3) he suddenly chooses to fall during the argument with Abdiel. All three of these views avoid reducing moral agency to allegory, or treating evil as "the essential principle of [Lucifer's] be ing," as Augustine puts it. Yet each interpretation involves a significant drawback: (1) risks erasing the distinction between fallen and Unf?llen in heaven, (2) makes the transition from fallen to Unf?llen seem de termined, not chosen, and (3) makes the moment of free choice seem arbitrary rather than deliberate. To make sense of the angel's character in the episode we must choose one of these interpretations, yet the episode itself, it seems to me, provides no definitive evidence allowing us confidently to select one over the other two. II. DELIBERATION AND CHOICE IN NARRATIVE Some readers, especially Miltonists, may object at this point that I am making up problems in order to have something to solve. When the rebel angel's movement from Unf?llen to fallen appears gradual, I complain about determinism, and when it appears sudden, I com plain about arbitrariness. Yet these complaints do not arise from any Andrew Escohedo 797</page><page sequence="12">perceived deficiency in Milton's art or theodicy, and I do not plan to solve any of the problems I have mentioned.35 Instead, I offer them as evidence of the audacity of Milton's undertaking in book 5. Nearly every literary account of angelic rebellion before Paradise Lost made Lucifer's sinful choice comprehensible either by turning him into an allegory of evil or by turning him into the equivalent of a human sinner, fraught with moral frailties we can all recognize. Milton, by contrast, sought to keep his rebel angel both verisimilar and superhuman, boldly balancing an ethos of free agency with a narrative scenario (the bliss of heaven) that would appear to make evil choice highly unlikely. This balance results in an episode that exposes with unusual keenness the subtle tension between choice and narrative context. It provides a valuable occasion to think about the agency of literary characters and what it means to say that a character appears free or not free. In the next few pages, then, I would like not so much to develop a theory of choice in narrative as to elaborate on a general level the problems we encounter in the interpretation of Raphael's account. Then, in the final section of the essay, I will return to the question of allegory to examine how this most non-allegorical of poets intimates the crucial affiliations between literary agency and its ostensible opposite, personification. Most immediately, the preceding discussion underlines the manner in which all narrative representations of choice must negotiate the extremes of freedom and intelligibility. As a choice becomes highly distinct from the flow of narrative, it escapes determinism but risks arbitrariness. Conversely, as a choice becomes highly identified with the flow of narrative, it escapes arbitrariness but risks determinism. The classic means of avoiding these extremes is to insert a process of deliberation between the narrative chain of events and the agent. De liberation is the literary trope that allows agency to express itself as "an engagement of gears between . . . intention and action," as Elizabeth Fowler has recently put it.36 By deliberating, the agent reveals cogni zance of the surrounding circumstances but also maintains a distance from them, allowing her to engage the narrative landscape without letting that landscape simply determine her actions. Deliberation straddles the divide between intelligibility and freedom, permitting us to understand why a character chooses as she does in terms of reasons (which leave the will free) rather than causes (which compel the will). It also creates the impression of multiple options, crucially avoiding the impression that an inner essence simply compels the character's actions, what we might call the personification effect. 798 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="13">Why then does the rebel angel's brief reflections on his circum stances fail to produce this effect of intelligible freedom, in the way it does for Milton's Adam and Eve or Vondel's Lucifer? Part of the answer is that the angel has little on which to reflect. Nothing hap pens in the story that would plausibly initiate a process of delibera tion about rebellion. Unlike the Edenic narrative, heaven provides no serpent, no dream about flying, and no argument about gardening. True, God does announce the new authority of the Son and raises the possibility of dissent, but Milton (unlike Vondel) offers no sense of why an Unf?llen angelic being might possibly take this event as an occasion to feel discontent.37 Indeed, Milton suggests the oddness of this response by mentioning only the envy of a single angel, and no other. In doing this Milton refuses to deny the inherent strangeness of the Lucifer legend when it is juxtaposed with an ethic of free will. The lack of narrative provocation to sin in heaven denies the angel plausible material for sinful reflection, leaving us with two unsatisfying alternatives: either the angel's deliberation?his prideful and envious response?causes his choice to rebel (determinism), or it is irrelevant to his choice to rebel (chance). In neither view does deliberate choice appear to obtain. Again, this problem does not represent a failure of Milton's theodicy. Rather, it exaggerates and clarifies the inevitable tension between choice and narrative inertia. Since formal narratology tends to treat choice as simply another narrative code, it offers less help with the problem of narrative deliberation than does recent discussion about free will in Anglo-American philosophy. Of course, modern "compatibilists" and "libertarians"?both of whom believe in free will?debate the agency of real people, not literary characters, but their disagreements hinge on just this tension between freedom and intelligibility. Philosophical libertarians take the commonsense view that freedom and determinism are incompatible with each other?an agent is free to the degree that she could choose otherwise at the moment of choice. Compatibilists, by contrast, argue that choices become unintelligible if they lack any determinism whatsoever: a choice is deliberate to the degree that it follows from rational and emotional deliberation.38 Granted, an agent could, after a careful mental process tending toward the choice o? option A, suddenly choose option B at the last second, but compati bilists insist that such a choice would represent arbitrary whim rather than free will, more like a hiccup than voluntary action. Libertarians, on the other side, seek to deny the association between intelligibility and determinism by describing deliberation as subject to a special Andrew Escohedo 799</page><page sequence="14">causality distinct from physical causality (the Kantian solution), or by distinguishing between indeterminism and random chance (the quantum mechanics solution).39 Setting aside the question of whether the freedom of real human be ings is determined or not, we can note from the outset that in narrative compatibilism usually wins. The inherently temporal nature of narrative obliges authors to represent deliberation linearly, as one thought after another after another, creating the impression that thoughts impinge on one another and so at least minimally determine each other.40 Im manuel Kant's distinction, in the Second Critique, between physical and mental causation cannot help here: in narrative, the interior chain of thoughts is always liable to resemble the exterior chain of events. This is why compatibilists tend to be narrative thinkers. Daniel Dennett, for example, considers the example of Martin Luther's assertion, in breaking with the church of Rome, that "I cannot do otherwise." For Dennett, this claim of necessity represents the most deliberate form of moral choice because it follows from a series of prior deliberations, habits, and resolutions on Luther's part. We must place his statement in its narrative context to appreciate it as a responsible act of volition.41 Libertarians, by contrast, tend to be anti-narrative thinkers. Robert Kane deems it a fatal mistake to think of human choice as occurring within a completed story; instead, he offers the analogy of a heroine facing a crisis "in the middle of a novel," whose character is "is not yet developed ... in sufficient detail to say exactly how she will react." Kane insists that, as choosing agents, our narrative character is never "fully formed."42 Free will here depends on denying narrative's abil ity to predict the outcome of a choice, a refusal of the finished story. When talking about finished stories, then, we can most coher ently account for the representation of deliberate choice in terms of compatibilism. The compatibilist perspective accepts a middle ground between freedom and determinism required by narrative.43 It recognizes that the narrative element (deliberation) that creates the effect of free agency also circumscribes this effect. Deliberation may be the minimum condition for the impression of volitional freedom, but this freedom does not simply increase as deliberation increases: deliberation also entangles the will. As a result, a character's choice can appear both intelligible and free (or free enough). By contrast, applying a libertarian perspective to narrative would involve refusing this middle ground, making choice either radically undetermined (free) or deeply determined (compelled). This perspec tive dichotomizes the free will into opposite extremes of freedom and 800 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="15">deliberateness.44 On the one hand, the free will is free to the degree that that it is unconstrained by any prior narrative of mental activity or external pressures. All sorts of thoughts may enter my head prior to choosing, but they cannot push me to make a particular choice, which is a free-standing, instantaneous event. In this extreme sense of free dom, even to say that reason guides the will reduces the will's liberty, since the conclusions of reason must remain ontologically distinct from the act of willing. By contrast, free will is willed to the degree that it follows from a prior narrative of deliberation and circumstance: con sidering evidence, employing logic, assessing goals, weighing options. A choice divorced from this process might be free, but would also seem curiously random and unintended, not willed. The prior narra tive of deliberation makes my choice feel willed by me instead of an event that happens to occur. In this extreme sense of deliberateness, narrative determinism essentially causes the choice. In the libertarian view, then, either the moment of choice breaks free of the determining elements of narrative (volition becomes a detached product) or narrative leads up to and swallows the eventual choice (volition becomes a diffuse process). In the final section of this essay I will suggest that this dichotomous model has important implications for the behavior of personifications, but for the moment let us note how peculiar the libertarian view would make choice in literal, verisimilar narrative. Characters would either be the absolute slaves of the story in which they appear or their choices would make that story seem almost irrelevant. Yet most literary characters in fact appear to exercise volition as a combination of their personal agency and narrative circumstances. Anna Karenina chooses to have an affair with Vronski, thus demonstrating her free will, but the choice also hinges on the count s charisma, her husband s coldness, the stultifying society of St. Petersburg, and so on. Leo Tolstoy's novel gives us the impression that she can voluntarily decide either to accept or resist Vronski s advances, but we also feel that narrative circumstances push her one way or another. She is free enough, but not too free. Scholars who examine free will in Paradise Lost nearly always do so under the aegis of studying the poem s theodicy, and these examinations sometimes employ the philosophical categories of compatibilism and libertarianism. Two of the very best, Dennis Danielson and Stephen M. Fall?n, focus on the famous free-will debate between Thomas Hobbes and John Bramhall, noting, surely correctly, that Milton's sym pathies would have been with the libertarian Bramhall.45 Yet whatever his theological commitments to absolute moral freedom, Milton the Andrew Escobedo 801</page><page sequence="16">consummate narrativist saw at least this much: a choice too detached from the narrative chain of events risks obscurity, whereas a choice too diffused along this chain risks evaporation. Here we find the structural limits of narrative agency, and theodicean approaches to free will in Paradise Lost have underestimated these limits. Danielson, in the strongest (and most interesting) version of his libertarian interpreta tion, insists that Milton would rather leave choice unintelligible than risk its freedom: "there is finally no answer to the question why."46 This is a bold recognition of the problem of choice, though a narrative that actually allowed for so radical a disjunction between choice and story would seem to approach the realm of the absurd, on the order of Albert Camus s L'Etranger. Indeed, it seems clear that, despite his distaste for Hobbesian me chanics, Milton recognized?as an inevitable feature of narrative?a gentler form of determinism akin to that described by modern com patibilism, and that he placed it in tension with his libertarian com mitment to free moral choice. Both views receive airtime in Paradise Lost. When emphasizing the unfettered quality of the will, Milton often associates will with power. Satan, admitting to himself that he could have resisted his feelings of ambition in heaven, concedes that he possessed "free will and power to stand" (PL, 4.66). Raphael likewise explains to Adam that God "left it in thy power, ordained thy will / By nature free, not over-ruled by fate" (PL, 5.526-27). These passages insist on the potential power of the will to overcome exter nal influence or internal inclination that would otherwise push it in a given direction?the libertarian will breaks free of its constraints. Yet when emphasizing the deliberate quality of the will, Milton usually couples it with the idea of reason. God adduces humankind's "will and reason (reason also is choice)" (PL, 3.108); Raphael warns Adam to "take heed lest passion sway / Thy judgment to do aught, which else free will / Would not admit" (PL, 8.635-37). Critics have tended to misunderstand the equation between reason and choice in these passages, assuming that reason simply makes the will free per se.47 Yet reason or judgment, in the process of enabling moral choice (by ap prehending the existence of options beyond mere passion or instinct), in fact guides the will to choose rightly, ideally limiting its freedom to select evil. To say that "free will / Would not admit" certain passion ate inclinations so long as "judgment" functions properly amounts to saying that judgment does more than merely provide neutral data for the will to consider; rather, the deliberative process of reason directs the will?prompts it and pushes it. Thus, Milton has God describe 802 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="17">the rebel angels as those "who reason for their law refuse" (PL, 6.41). Reason's law is in fact philosophical compatibilism, ideally determining the will to (voluntarily) choose the good.48 In the case of Adam and Eve, Milton feels confident, I think, that he can allow this gentle form of narrative determinism to exert pressure on the will to freedom without damaging his theodicy. The Edenic couple appear to us to exercise deliberate choice precisely because Milton allows their voluntary choices to intermix with involuntary feelings and circumstances: the serpent's temptation, Eve's sense of inferiority, Adam's deep attachment to his wife, and so on. These elements, which we might feel impinge upon Adam and Eve's freedom, also make their choices appear intelligible rather than arbitrary. Granted, such narrative determinism in a poem that cares so much about liberty makes free will fragile. The best account of this phenomenon in Milton's Eden remains Leslie Brisman's Milton s Poetry of Choice and Its Romantic Heirs, which begins with the assumption that "choice is necessarily belied when it is written about."49 His elegant study examines the poet's efforts to sustain the presentness of decision over against the determining pressure of narrative. Drawing on S0ren Kierkegaard, Henri Bergson, and romantic poetry's representation of mind, Brisman suggests that Miltonic choice takes the form of an unmediated con sciousness that forestalls evacuation into past or future by strategically staging narrative arrests, interruptions, and expansions. Yet Brisman surprisingly says nothing about the angel's choice to rebel in heaven, perhaps because he feels there is not enough nar rative material to work with. However, as I have already suggested, this paucity is precisely what makes Milton's account of angelic sin so strange and daring, and what prompted the dichotomous interpretation of the rebel angel's choice in the first part of this essay. The lack of plausible provocation to sin makes it difficult to apply the compatibilist model of narrative to this episode's representation of choice, since the rebel angel cannot occupy a deliberative middle ground, as we discussed earlier. If we think in terms of chronology of events, then we first see the angel before any narrative has a chance to intelligibly predict his choices: he is a radical version of Robert Kane's unformed character in a perpetually unfinished novel. This is why Milton gives the angel no name: no legible agency yet exists in him. On the other hand, if we think in terms of r?cit, then the narrative has long since named this angel Satan, making his prideful choices in heaven seem determined by his prideful, completed character. Deliberation, such as it operates in this episode, thus tends to entangle the will with nar Andrew Escobedo 803</page><page sequence="18">rative causality. Significantly, the statement by Abdiel that we earlier took as the affirmation of the rebel angel's free choice?"I see thy fall / Determined"?can also be read, due to its passive construction, as an indication of compulsion. This ambiguity is the cost of Milton's insis tence on literal agency in a heavenly narrative, his refusal to turn the rebel angel's evil choice into an "essential principle" of his being. III. MILTON'S SIN We should see Raphael's narrative in book 5 as Milton's second attempt to represent the angelic will to sin. In it, Milton registers the need to account for the mental process of transgression, even in a context (heaven) that deprives him of the usual narrative props that motivate sinful volition. His first try occurs in book 2, in Satan's encounter with the allegorical personifications Sin and Death at the Hell Gate. Milton clearly aligns these two episodes, having Sin's ac count of her sudden birth from Satan?"Out of thy head I sprung" (PL, 2.758)?anticipate Satan's claim of autonomy as a "birth mature" (PL, 5.862) in book 5. Yet whereas Raphael's literal narrative can de pict sinful volition only in an entangling negotiation with deliberation, the allegorical episode in book 2 represents volition in a much more radical relationship to narrative, one that simultaneously subjects and releases the will. In doing this, Milton avails himself of the curious effects of allegorical agency. What would it mean to say that allegorical personifications possess agency? For one thing, since personifications do not typically deliberate, we would have to suspend for a moment the commonsense association between free will and deliberation, imagining instead a highly dichoto mous representation of narrative agency. On the one hand, allegorical figures are agents in the sense of principal and agent: they are factors that carry out a pre-existing ontological imperative. Angus Fletcher has influentially described this agency as a kind of "daemonic" possession, a figure whose conceptual being compels it to undertake only a narrow range of actions.50 Allegorical agents are obliged to make choices that recapitulate their being: the character Vanity, for example, behaves vainly because she must act out the imperatives of her daemon. In this view, personifications are not free compared to psychologically deep characters, who seem realistic precisely because their volition appears unconstrained by a single, motivating essence. Allegorical agents' lack of freedom is likewise implied by their traditional appearance in genealogical lists (for example, Fancy, Love, Covetousness, Jealousy, 804 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="19">Rage, and so on) that imply fixation within a conceptual chain of cause and effect. The compulsion that drives a personification to act thus comes both from its inner daemon and from the external allegorical landscape that assigns it its function. On the other hand, allegorical figures are agents in the sense that their single-minded activity is unconstrained by external circumstances or mental distraction. They are, in a deep sense, free to do what they are. Nothing can stop Vanity from behaving vainly?not persuasion, not hard times, not regret?and a counter-allegory like Humility can only send Vanity offstage, not transform its behavior. This view resonates with Theresa Krier's recent identification of prosopopoetic daemons with the semi-divine beings who intercede between gods and mortals in Greek literature. In this striking re-description, daemons enable rather than merely compel the agency of personifications, transform ing them into unfettered energy mediating between conceptual parts, the "free movement across an interval."51 If we apply this idea of free movement to the domain of will, we might say that a personification's actions represent a discharge of volitional energy. In this sense, alle gory allows for unconstrained agency?at least, unconstrained by the impinging forces of narrative circumstances, because personifications are heterogeneous to the literal elements of a story that might other wise determine them. To employ two concepts from modern political theory, an allegorical agent enjoys both negative and positive liberty: it is "free from" the constraining pressures of narrative circumstance, and it is "free to" realize its nature through volitional action, to "be his own master," as Isaiah Berlin put it.52 We have wandered into strange territory. Personifications simul taneously appear deeply compelled and radically free. If this latter dimension of allegorical agency?the volitional realization of concep tual essence?constitutes a kind of agency, it is a kind quite different from the deliberate freedom we associate with literal characters. The point, then, is not that personifications are really just as free as other characters. Rather, personifications can help us notice the compro mise that literal characters make with narrative determinism, because personifications eschew this compromise. Literal characters express their free will in a compatibilist manner, interacting with and reflecting on narrative circumstances that make manifest their options but that also impinge upon their choices. They live in narratives that require a negotiation between the involuntary and the voluntary, allowing for the potential of the former to influence the latter. Personification, however, radically disentangles the voluntary and involuntary, placing them on Andrew Escobedo 805</page><page sequence="20">either side of a threshold that cannot be crossed. Personifications do not undergo a process of cognition when choosing. Their mental activity of choice is usually represented as happening all at once?in what we can describe equally as a sudden volitional discharge or as an involuntary daemonic compulsion. To recall the dichotomous effects of the libertarian perspective: in personifications, the free will kicks itself free of the process of cognitive activity in the way that Vanity kicks herself free of her narrative circumstances. Conversely, the free will derives from a cognitive and narrative process that compels volition in the way that allegorical genealogy imposes a function upon Vanity. The divided agency of personification sheds considerable light on Milton's use of the allegorical character of Sin. Most commentators conclude that this figure represents a kind of ontological diminishment, the consequence of choosing evil.53 Yet Milton carefully links Sin, as I have already noted, with the precise moment of the rebel angel's choice to claim self-creation in heaven. She is simultaneous with this act of will, not a consequence of it. Her appearance proleptically reinscribes that literal act of deliberative agency in terms of a division between determinism and radical freedom. Milton does this in anticipation of the problem of sinful choice in book 5, which threatens to diffuse the moment of choice throughout the entangling process of narrative. We can better appreciate the care with which Milton sets up this re-staging of will if we compare his account with one of his primary sources, Pirineas Fletcher's The Locusts (1627). Both poets place Lucifer and Sin within a conceptual genealogy, wherein one term begets another, which begets another. Yet Fletcher associates his allegorical Sin with Adam and Eve's fall rather than with Lucifer's, shifting the emphasis from agential origin to consequence. That is, he pushes Sin down the causal chain rather than up toward etiology, making her the effect of a prior choice. As with Milton, we come across Sin at the Hell Gate: A shapeless shape, a foul deformed thing, Nor nothing, nor a substance: as those thin And empty forms, which through the air fling Their wandering shapes, at length they're fastened in The Crystal sight. It serves, yet reigns as King: It lives, yet's death: it pleases, full of pain: Monster! ah who, who can thy being fain? Thou shapeless shape, live death, pain pleasing, servile reign. Of that first woman, and th'old serpent bred, By lust and custom nursed; whom when her mother 806 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="21">Saw so deformed, how fain would she have fled Her birth, her self? But she her dame would smother, And all her brood . . . 54 Sin's determination to harm Eve's future "brood" (fallen humankind) suggests that Sin herself has begotten the allegorical figures we meet a few stanzas later: Sickness, Languor, Grief, and Pangs. The evil choices of fallen humankind are to some degree already determined by this genealogy of misery. Yet the allegorical chain moves not only downward, but also upward, enveloping and transforming its historical (literal) origin, Eve. Fletcher describes Eve's transgression as a symbolic sexual coupling with Satan ("th'old serpent"), and so the "lust" that nurses Sin attaches itself to Eve, as if Sin resulted not from Eve s deliberate choice but rather from her lustful essence.55 Eve's volitional agency tacitly but inexorably transforms into allegorical essence, something like Feminine Lust. So far the allegory behaves as conventional accounts of personifica tion would lead us to expect, rewriting deliberative agency as conceptual essence, making choices seem like compulsions. Yet when we move from Eve, further up the genealogical chain to its origin, to Lucifer, we encounter a scenario that splits agency between choice and compulsion. Fletcher's angel, "swollen with pride, but more with rage, and hate," is as much personification as literal character when we meet him in council a few stanzas later.56 Indeed, "swollen" aptly exemplifies the critic Angus Fletcher's sense of the "daemonic" possession under which allegorical personifications labor. Yet Lucifer's wicked compulsion dif fers from that of Sin or Eve because no prior allegorical genealogy can determine it: Lucifer's evil agency in heaven precedes all others. This agential anteriority causes Phineas Fletcher's description of Lucifer's fall to vacillate between freedom and constraint: Thus fell this Prince of darkness, once a bright And glorious star: he willfully turned away His borrowed globe from that eternal light: Himself he sought, so lost himself: his ray Vanish't to smoke, his morning sunk in night, And never more shall see the springing day.5' The passage makes clear the angel's volition?"he willfully turned away . . . Himself. . . himself?overcoming any circumstantial or mental context for his choice: Lucifer simply wills, all on his own, to his own detriment. Any attempt to explain rationally why Lucifer rebelled disappears into paradox: "Himself he sought, so lost himself." Andrew Escobedo 807</page><page sequence="22">On the other hand, the poet has already made it perfectly clear why Lucifer transgressed: he was "swollen with Pride," and transgression is the kind of thing Pride does, much as Sin sins because she's Sin. They do not choose; they are. This is why Fletcher makes "Prince of Darkness" the grammatical subject of "fell"?an incorrect attribution, historically speaking, since the darkness was the consequence, not the cause, of the falling. Yet the error represents an apt instance of the manner in which allegory turns choice into consequence. Thus, to the degree he is pulled into allegory, Fletcher's Lucifer is radically free or ontologically compelled; there is little deliberative room in between. We can see some of the same dichotomous features in Milton's Sin. With Sin's birth from Satan, the will kicks itself free from any prior, entangling process of cognition. Sin carefully sets up the circumstances, describing Satan In heaven ... at the assembly, and in sight Of all the seraphim with there combined In bold conspiracy against heaven's king . . . (PL, 2.749-51) The stage is richly set with details that we will see recapitulated in book 5, Satan's "bold conspiracy" here anticipating his "bold discourse" (PL, 5.803) in Raphael's telling. But how did he come to choose bold conspiracy? His envy? His resentment? A miscalculation of logic? As Sin explains, it just happened: All on a sudden miserable pain Surprised thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzy swum In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide, Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright, Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed Out of thy head I sprung; amazement seized All the Host of heaven; back they recoiled afraid At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign Portentous held me . . . (PL, 2.752-61) Sin's sudden appearance replaces the psychological process of trans gression with an instantaneous disclosure of daemonic energy, akin to Krier s account of the conceptual transformations that such energy enables. Satan chooses all in a moment, free from the burden of ex planatory contexts. Yet, at the same time, this act of willing so dislo cates itself from any prior deliberation?emphasized by the language 808 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="23">of "sudden," "surprised," and "amazement"?that choice here verges on trauma, and it is scarcely right to say that it is Satan who wills. Rather, volition happens to him, and he is daemonically possessed by sin, like Phineas Fletcher's Lucifer "swollen with pride." What book 5 presents as an ambiguous combination of causality and volition, book 2 presents as radically divided volition, free from narrative and yet subjected to essence.58 Yet Sin's association with the first wicked angelic choice also signals Milton's revision of Phineas Fletchers Sin. That personification was a second-generation consequence of Lucifer's "willful" choice to sin, already interpolated by a genealogical chain.59 Milton's Sin, by contrast, emerges simultaneously with the rebel angel's choice. The poet intends that she escape from time, eluding the diffusion of choice into narrative by using her as what we might call a volitional radical.60 This escape does not so much stretch out the moment of choice?what Brisman describes as the "simultaneous ongoingness" of decision?as it makes choice a singularity divorced from the contextualizing pressures of time itself.61 Vondel describes this aptly: "Time grants no respite," the anguished Lucifer says as he wavers between repentance and defiance, "and this instant now / Is no sufficiency of time, if one / May give the name of time to this brief moment / Between salvation and eternal doom."62 Vondel's Lucifer compresses the instant of choice so tightly that it loses duration altogether. Both Vondel and Milton recognize that this atemporal model will finally not work in narrative, since narrative makes choice meaning ful by allowing the voluntary to interact with the involuntary over a period of time. Yet, as an allegory, Milton's Sin does not exactly need to interact with the fictional elements in the narrative in order to ac quire a meaningful identity, which she derives instead from a second ary order of non-fictional ideas. Her meaning and being are identical the moment she emerges in the narrative. As a volitional radical, she isolates the rebel angel's choice from any deliberative or circumstan tial process that would seek to determine it, and it is impossible to fix for certain her own temporal relation to this choice. Sin's appearance causes Satan's choice, as an agent herself ("a goddess armed"), and is also a consequence of the choice that Satan himself made ("a sign / Portentous"). Sin's double nature responds to the deliberate ambiguity of the narrative context that Milton supplies: "in bold conspiracy." At what point in a conspiracy does the intention to transgress become the choice to transgress? If we identify conspiracy with choice, Sin's appearance allegorically reflects what Satan has already willed. If we Andrew Escobedo 809</page><page sequence="24">identify conspiracy with deliberation, Sin's appearance compels Sa tan finally to cross the volitional threshold from intention to choice. Milton's Sin is the evil twin sister of Delacroix's Lady Liberty, whose encouragement gives the peasant-citizens the agency to revolt but who also simply signifies the agency they already have. Yet Sin remains an unusual personification, since after her fall from heaven Milton provides her with a psychological autonomy unexpected in an allegory. She appears to reflect on her decision to disobey God and open the gates of Hell: "what owe I to his commands above / Who hates me ... ?" (PL, 2.856-57). She also relates that, having just arrived in Hell but before birthing Death, "Pensive here I sat / Alone" (PL, 2.777-78). What is she thinking about? Defeat? Revenge? Fear? Regret? For just a moment, Sin is psychologically abstracted from her conceptual being, like the "stupidly good" (PL, 9.465) Sa tan momentarily smitten with Eve's innocence.63 Presenting Sin as a deliberating agent creates an odd effect: to what other choice could Sin's deliberations lead her except to sin? Why would Sin bother to deliberate at all? These questions point to the manner in which Sin's reasoning process forces us to suspend temporarily our commonsense association of deliberation with freedom. In the case of the allegorical Sin, deliberation either causes her choice (her wicked thoughts ensure her wicked choice) or is irrelevant to her choice (even if she thought nice thoughts, Sin would still choose to sin). Sin's psychological depth amounts to a libertarian parody of the compatibilist compromise that deliberating characters, for the sake of intelligible choices, make with narrative determinism. At the moment of her birth, Sin circumvents this compromise by detaching the rebel angel's choice in heaven from any process that might explain it, and so constrain it. This choice is supremely intelligible (the angel sins because he's sinful) and com pletely arbitrary (Sin happens to come upon the angel rather than Obedience). This interpretation may seem to let Satan off the hook, marginal izing his "literal" agency and moral responsibility in heaven. Yet Milton does not intend Sin simply to represent Satan's evil status, but rather to expose the narrative limits of moral choice itself by pushing agency toward its two logical extremes. The allegorical interlude of book 2 thus seeks not so much to reaffirm the free-will theodicy of Paradise Lost as to reflect on the poem's narrative operations.64 Certainly, when Sin and Death appear later in the poem, as God's "Hell-hounds" (PL, 10.630), they have been reabsorbed into the moral-punitive fabric of the poem's ethical cosmos. But in this initial episode Sin teaches us how 810 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="25">to think about narrative agency, preparing us for the problematic mix of causality and freedom in heaven, and also for the gentler narrative determinism in Eden. The episode prompts us to recognize that, if in narrative Adam and Eve cannot be radically free (lest they become personifications), they are free enough for moral responsibility. Milton thus uses personification allegory to intimate the limits of literal agency but also to guarantee a workable version of that agency, recognizing the risk of too absolute a demand for freedom in narrative. Victoria Kahn has written suggestively along these lines about the Sin and Death episode, which she sees as an effort "to negotiate between two allegorical extremes": One in which everything is a function of the self, with the result that all experience is narcissistic; the other in which everything is a function of God and external circumstance, in which case experience?and education?are impossible. . . . [I]f reading is to be possible, then the text must be conceived of as a thing indifferent in the precise sense that it offers an occasion for ethical deliberation.65 This account of textual indifference, requiring a middle ground between narcissism and external causation, resonates with the compatibilist middle ground between arbitrary free choice and narrative compulsion. Kahn here admirably lays out the allegorical stakes of moral inter pretation, in Milton's view, for both prelapsarian Adam and Eve and postlapsarian humanity. Yet she underestimates the special narrative circumstances to which Milton applies the Sin and Death episode, a narrative presenting the unique problem of angelic sin, which, un like Eve's choice, is "Self-tempted, self-depraved" (PL, 3.130). As we have discussed, heaven provides Satan with no indifferent tableau for neutral interpretation, and so in representing the rebel angel's act of volition Milton is deprived of the usual narrative props that allow him to explain Edenic and postlapsarian choices. On the contrary: Milton's heaven, unlike his Eden, is exactly that narrative milieu in which inter pretation risks evacuation into either pure narcissism or pure external determination. In this respect, it is significant that Milton chooses to represent Satan's transgression only in flashbacks told by characters in the poem, narratives overtly marked as versions of the event. No neutral telling can encompass the psychological impasse of the angelic will to sin. Either Milton must rely on a literal version (book 5) in which inexplicable involuntary circumstances such as "envy" constantly threaten to overdetermine the free choice to transgress, or he must rely Andrew Escobedo 811</page><page sequence="26">on an allegorical version (book 2) in which voluntary and involuntary are culled apart from one another in the most extreme fashion. The allegory of Sin is Milton's concession, before he gives us the literal narrative in book 5, to Calvin's judgment about the intricacies of angelic sin: "it were better, if not entirely to pass them in silence, at least only to touch lightly upon them."66 Milton does touch upon them, but uses allegory to isolate the contradictory pressures of causal circumstance and free-standing choice within any narrative of angelic transgression. As the agent ofthat transgression, Sin frees the will from narrative causality by rendering choice inexplicable. As the sign ofthat transgression, Sin entangles the will within the causation of allegorical genealogy, whereby her existence leads to Death and to the manifold, involuntary miseries that later pervert the will of postlapsarian human ity. This allegorical genealogy also stretches upward along the causal chain, enfolding Satan as its conceptual source. Milton anticipates this effect of allegorical genealogy as Satan flies toward his fateful encounter with Sin and Death, when, for the first time in the poem, he becomes the name he has. The narrator calls him "the adversary of God and man" (PL, 2.629), which is to say in Hebrew, Satan. Ohio University NOTES The research for this essay was originally undertaken in the 2003 NEH Summer Seminar, "The English Reformation: Literature, History, Art," directed by John King at Ohio State University. In a later draft the essay benefited from the generous sug gestions and criticisms of Jeff Dolvin, James Dougal Fleming, and Beth Quitslund. Comments offered by my colleagues in the English Faculty Colloquium group at Ohio University also helped me remove several errors from my argument. My thanks to all these readers. J An odd consequence of the history of literary criticism is that we now find it easier to define allegorical character than we do literal character. For the purposes of this discussion, a character is potentially literal if it meets one or more of the following requirements: 1) it openly represents a historical person; 2) it does not announce (via name or behavior) its secondariness to an order of non-fictional ideas?that is, it can be understood primarily in terms of its relation to other elements in the same narrative plane; 3) it displays emotions, dispositions, or intentions of sufficient range to make it difficult to identify the character with a single trait. Renaissance writers and readers would affirm (1) explicitly, (2) implicitly, and probably regard (3) as rather oblique. (For the modern sense of literal character, simply reverse this order of priority.) In any case, all three of these criteria are at least minimally relevant to the Renaissance rec ognition of literal character, allowing us, for example, to include William Shakespeare's Lord Bardolph, who spreads rumors in 2 Henry IV, but exclude Shakespeare's Rumor. Shakespeare's contemporaries would see this distinction, even if they had no interest in theorizing or formalizing it. 812 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="27">2 See Angus Fletcher, Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode (Ithaca: Cornell Univ.

H The question of whether medieval and Renaissance readers in fact saw any asso ciation between personification and allegory is a long-debated one. This essay follows Stephen Barneys commonsense intuition that, even before the eighteenth century, personification "is the most trustworthy signal of allegory" (Allegories of History, Al legories of Love [Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1979], 32). Jon Whitman further argues that the association was inevitable due to the manner in which both personification and allegory rely on a double structure of interior reality and external fa?ade, prosopon and allos. See Whitman, Allegory: The Dynamics of an Ancient and Medieval Technique (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1987), 269. In the case of John Milton, this associa tion is indisputable, as we can see when his The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce (1643) personifies Custom: "To pursue the allegory, Custom being but a mere face, as echo is a mere voice, rests not in her unaccomplishment, until by secret inclination she accorporate herself with Error" (Complete Prose Works of John Milton, ed.

Hereafter abbreviated PL and cited parenthetically by book and line number. 10 John Carey assumes precisely this, suggesting that Milton responded to the problem of illogical angels by "omitting any depiction of the Unf?llen Satan from his account" ("Milton's Satan," in The Cambridge Companion to Milton, ed. Dennis Dan ielson [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1989], 136). Here, as throughout, I avoid referring to Milton's rebel angel as "Lucifer" since, as John Leonard has discussed, Milton deliberately withholds Satan's prior name in heaven. See Leonard, Naming in Paradise: Milton and the Language of Adam and Eve (Oxford: Clarendon, 1990), 86-104. This lack of naming also has consequences, as I will suggest, for the poem's sense of the angel's agency. 1 ' William Poole has recently written a monograph on Renaissance discussions about the fall of Adam and Eve and its relation to Milton, which articulates many of the perplexities facing commentators. Why, for example, would the presumably sin-free Edenic couple choose to disobey God unless they had already fallen before the serpent tempted them? See Poole, Milton and the Idea of the Fall (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2005), 9-39. Yet whatever puzzlements emerged from the Genesis story, narrative elaborations of Genesis chapters 2 and 3 regularly identify the serpent as the cause of the transgression. Milton makes this move at the beginning of his epic: "Th'infernal Serpent. He it was ..." (Paradise Lost, 1.34).

Ilr. 15 "When we ask the cause of the evil angels' misery, we find that it is the just result of their turning away from him who supremely is, and their turning towards themselves, who do not exist in that supreme degree. What other name is there for this fault than pride?" (Augustine, City of God, trans. Henry Bettenson [New York: Penguin, 1984], 477). Notice that Augustine is discussing the cause of the rebel angels' misery after their rebellion, not the cause of their choice to rebel. Pride did not cause the rebel angels to turn away from God and to themselves; rather it is this turning. 16 Augustine, 477. Augustine does note in the City of God that our creaturely origin ex nihilo, rather than ex deo, makes possible wicked choices, but he does not think this explains why some creatures choose evil while others do not. Only free will can account for that. Nothingness is the initial condition of, not the cause of, the evil will. 17 Augustine, 446. 18 Anne Ferry, Milton's Epic Voice: The Narrator in "Paradise Lost" (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1963), 130-31. 19 Some critics argue that Milton intends the mimetically improbable war in heaven as an allegory (for example, Mindele Anne Treip, Allegorical Poetics and the Epic: The Renaissance Tradition to "Paradise Lost" [Lexington: Univ. Press of Kentucky, 1994], 194-96). Somewhat differently, Michael Murrin insists that Milton refuses allegory?in the sense of one-to-one correspondence?but instead employs a biblical typology for his heavenly scenes "which protected them from literalist readings" (The Allegorical Epic [Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1980], 154). Yet, whether allegory or typology, nothing in Raphael's narrative of book 5 exceeds literal plausibility. On the level of visualization and action the narrative appears self-sufficient, and does not announce itself as secondary to an order of non-fictional ideas or biblical events. 20 See Milton, Paradise Lost, 4.957-61. 21 O? course, if Milton thinks voluntary loving is the same as feeling envious, then we could say that the angel chooses to experience envy. Yet "fraught with envy" sounds highly passive, especially compared to the sense of sustained commitment in the choice to "freely love." Furthermore, "as in our will" may act as a qualifier, designating that dimension of love that voluntas can command. Milton suggests that angels experience involuntary feelings when he describes how Raphael "glowed / Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue" {Paradise Lost, 8.618-19). Love's proper hue: the glow belongs to love, not to Raphael's free will. 22 See also Milton, De Doctrina Christiana: "It seems to some people that the good angels now maintain their position not so much by their own strength as by the grace of God. ... It seems more reasonable, however, to suppose that the good angels stand by their own strength, no less than man did before his fall" (Complete Prose Works, 6:343-44). 23 Augustine, 445. 814 Allegorial Agency and the Sins of Angels</page><page sequence="29">24 On this definition of sin, see Milton, De Doctrina Christiana, 6:382. 25 The only two personifications mentioned in the play, Mercy and Justice, never even appear onstage. See Joost van den Vondel, Lucifer, trans. Noel Clark (Bath, England: Absolute Classics, 1990), 49. Hereafter abbreviated L and cited parentheti cally by page number. 26 Hugo Bekker notes this problem of indefinite choices, and accounts for it by ar guing that Vondel wants to emphasize the theme of mercy. Thus, any indication that Lucifer has crossed the point of no return (until the very end) is mistaken, including Gabriel's straightforward report in act 3 that God has decided to withhold mercy from the rebels. See Bekker, "Vondel's 'Lucifer': An Inquiry into its Structure," Modern Language Review 59 (1964): 425-34. Yet his account of Gabriel's so-called mistake is rather arbitrary, since nothing else in the play suggests that this angel makes erroneous reports about God's will. 2' Leonard, 93. 2S For God's ridicule, see Milton, Paradise Lost, 5.724-26. 29 Critics sometimes argue that any inconsistencies result from Abdiel's or Raphael's imperfect knowledge of divine will. But surely this claim amounts to saving the ap pearances: neither Milton nor his God give any indication that these loyal angels get the story wrong. 30 In some cases a Miltonic character makes more than one crucial choice over his entire career, such as Samson's decision to trust Dalilah. Yet, significantly, Milton opts to place this decision in the past and dramatizes instead Samson's single (heroic and horrific) choice to overcome his Palestinian enemies. Likewise, even if we say that the Lady chooses to trust the disguised Comus, Milton gives no indication that her ignorance of his libidinous intentions in any way constitutes a moral lapse, as would be the case in Spenser, for example. Instead, moral choice becomes relevant when the Lady, now aware of her captor's intentions, must definitively refuse his advances. The same situation applies to Eve's choice to follow the talking serpent to the Tree of Knowledge. 31 Teskey, "From Allegory to Dialectic: Imagining Error in Spenser and Milton," PMLA 101 (1986): 9. 32 For Abdiel's claim about the Son, see Milton, Paradise Lost, 5.835-40. 33 Philip J. Gallagher, Milton, the Bible, and Misogyny (Columbia: Univ. of Missouri Press, 1990), 93, 89. 34 Stephen M. Fall?n, Milton Among the Philosophers: Poetry and Materialism in Seventeenth-Century England (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1991), 218. 35 For a very different view of Milton's representation of free will in heaven, one that finds the poem's theodicy a failure, see Richard Strier, "Milton's Fetters, or, Why Eden is Better then Heaven," Milton Studies 38 (2000): 169-97. 36 Elizabeth Fowler, Literary Character: The Human Figure in Early English Writing (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 2003), 99. 37 For the Son's authority and the possibility of dissent, see Milton, Paradise Lost, 5.603-8,611-15. 38 This compatibilist position depends on distinguishing between immediate con straints on the will (for example, physical force or hypnotism) and more remote factors (for example, habits of thought, past experience, and prior choices). These remote factors are consistent with determinism but leave room for hypothetical alternative options: had the agent reasoned differently or believed different things, then she could have chosen differently. Kai Nelson describes the classic compatibilist requirements for freedom Andrew Escobedo 815</page><page sequence="30">succinctly: "we say a man is free rather than unfree when the following conditions hold: 1. He could have done otherwise if he had chosen to. 2. His actions are voluntary in the sense that the kleptomaniac's stealing is not. 3. Nobody compelled him to choose as he did" (Reason and Practice [New York: Harper and Row, 1971], 62). 39 On the libertarian account of deliberative causality, see Roderick Chisholm, "Hu man Freedom and the Self," in Free Will, ed. Robert Kane (Oxford: Blackwell, 2002), 47-57. On the distinction between indeterminism and chance, see Kane, "Respon sibility, Luck, and Chance: Reflections on Free Will and Indeterminism," Journal of Philosophy 96 (1999): 217-40. 40 It is always possible to cut against the grain of narrative's temporal orderliness by representing consciousness as a jumble of contradictory thoughts (for example, the "Proteus" chapter of James Joyce's Ulysses). But doing this precludes any coherent representation of what we might recognize as deliberate choice. 41 See Daniel Dennett, "I Could Not Have Done Otherwise?So What?" Journal of Philosophy 81 (1984): 533-67. 42 Kane, "Responsibility, Luck, and Chance," 240. 43 John S. Tanner, in a brilliant discussion of Milton's representation of evil, notes that "absolute freedom does not lend itself to realistic narrative. . . . Human evil always emerges in the context of prior evil" ("'Say First What Cause': Ricoeur and the Etiology of Evil in Paradise Lost," PMLA 103 [1988]: 55 n.7). This is quite right, except that the problem of "absolute freedom" derives from the nature of narrative, not evil. In Comus, the Lady's virtuous choice to refuse her tempter's advances would likewise be rendered arbitrary if the story gave us no earlier indications of her character or her reflections on the danger surrounding her. 44 Bear in mind that this dichotomous effect occurs in narrative, not necessarily in reality. Libertarian philosophers would certainly deny that their perspective divides real human cognition in the manner that I describe below. 45 See Dennis Danielson, Milton's Good God: A Study in Literary Theodicy (Cam bridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1982), 131-63; and Fall?n, "To Act or not': Milton's Conception of Divine Freedom," Journal of the History of Ideas 49 (1988), 425-49, esp. 427-29. See also Fall?n, Milton Among the Philosophers, 30-41. 46 Danielson, 146. 4/ For instance, in her otherwise informative discussion of the emblematics of free will in Paradise Lost, Treip confuses reason's ability to "arbitrate over sensible im ages: to sift, choose, and discard"?a function that would clearly seem to determine the will?with reason s alleged status as "preeminently bound up with the act o?free choice" ("'Reason Is Also Choice': The Emblematics of Free Will in Paradise Lost," Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900 31 [1991]: 162). 48 One can always respond, as I suspect many Milton critics would, that the chooser is free to ignore the promptings of reason and choose evil?as the example of the rebel angels demonstrates. Yes: insofar as we identify choice with power, one always has "free will and power to stand" and is likewise "free to fall" (Milton, Paradise Lost, 4.66, 3.99). Yet to say this necessarily cramps the poem's alternative formula that "reason also is choice" (Milton, Paradise Lost, 3.108). 49 Leslie Brisman, Milton's Poetry of Choice and Its Romantic Heirs (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1973), 55. 50 See Angus Fletcher, 25-69. 51 Theresa Krier, "Psychic Deadness in Allegory: Spenser's House of Mammon and Attacks on Linking," in Imagining Death in Spenser and Milton, ed.

Henry Hardy and Roger Hausheer (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997), 203. 53 Ferry argues that Milton deliberately confines Sin and Death, and allegory in general, to the world of fallen experience. See Ferry, 128-40. Maureen Quilligan, in Mutons Spenser: The Politics of Reading (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1983), suggests that in birthing Sin Satan "has authored something less than pure res. He can't do the real thing" (126). Fall?n, in "Milton's Sin and Death: The Ontology of Allegory in Paradise Lost" (ELR 17 [1987]: 329-50), has influentially interpreted Sin and Death as allegorical examples of Augustine's claim that evil does not have independent existence but rather represents the absence of good. 54Phineas Fletcher, The Locusts, Or Apollyonists, in The English Spenserians, ed. William B. Hunter, Jr. (Salt Lake City: Univ. of Utah Press, 1977), canto 1, stanzas 10 and 11, lines 1-5. 55 This implication comes into sharper relief when we consider the Biblical source for Fletcher's allegory: "when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin" (James 1:15 [KJV]). 56Phineas Fletcher, 1.18.4. 57 See Phineas Fletcher, 1.20.1-6. 58 John S. Tanner makes a similar point about Sin's birth in the context of discuss ing the representation of evil: "Milton's myth . . . acknowledges that, at the deepest level, complete self-determination begins to look more like compulsion than like free choice . . . the evil to which Satan gives birth also possesses him; he does not appear so much to choose evil, rationally and deliberately, as to succumb to it in pain and lust" ("Say First What Cause," 49). 59 That is, Lucifer/Pride rebels, then Satan/Pride couples with Eve/Lust, who gives birth to Sin. 601 derive this term in part from James Dougal Fleming s fascinating interpretation of the figure of Medusa, in Paradise Lost 2.611-12, as a "semiotic radical," a figure who is curiously undetermined by the symbolic discourse of the story around her ("Meanwhile, Medusa in Paradise Lost" ELH 69 [2002]: 1009). 61 Brisman, 151. 62Vondel, Lucifer, in Kirkconnell ed., 406. I have earlier relied on the fine and dramatic translation of Clark thus far, but here I quote KirkconnelPs less dramatic but more literal translation. 63 Contra Stephen M. Fall?n, who argues, without mentioning this line, that, un like Satan, "it is inconceivable . . . that Sin and Death could be 'stupidly good' or 'abstracted from themselves'" ("Milton's Sin and Death," 345). Steven Knapp has argued that Sin's curious literalism "suggests that historical and allegorical agency are readily interchangeable?even in the career of a single agent?and that Milton has no consistent interest either in separating or reconciling the two" (139). Yet this claim overlooks the fact that Milton has separated out allegorical and literal versions of the same event, in books 2 and 5 of his poem. 64 Consider, for example, how hopeless it would be to try to reconcile God's asser tion that "Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell" with Sin's inclusion in "the general fall" of the rebel angels from heaven into hell (Milton, Paradise Lost, 3.102, 2.773). Milton does not want us to bother to try.
