PROPOSED SEMINAR IN PSYCHOLOGY It has been suggested that a group be formed to study and discuss the relations of the various developments of psychology at the present time. Since exponents of these special developments?e.g. the medical psychologist and the academic research worker?are apt to show scant understanding or respect for one another's views, it seems the more desirable that thoughtful students should undertake some comparison of the writings of leading exponents of psychology in different fields, with a view to ascertaining their various aims and postulates, determining their distinctive contributions, and correlating their results, It is considered that a group formed for this purpose should consist of persons possessing some knowledge of general psychology and, if possible, closer acquaintance with some special branch of the subject. It is suggested that the group might meet fortnightly or monthly; that at the meetings different members should undertake to open discussion by short papers on aspects of the subject specially interesting to them ; and that the programme of reading and discussion should be arranged amongst the members. Anyone disposed to take part in such a seminar is invited to communicate with the Director of Studies. 604</page><page sequence="2">INSTITUTE NOTES LIVERPOOL CENTRE The following Committee has been elected for the Session 1927-28 :?
