<plain_text><page sequence="1">Feminine Authority in the Heptameron: A Reading of Oysille Paula Sommers The women of Marguerite de Navarre's Heptameron can be divided into two categories-the bourgeoises, nuns, princesses and serv- ing girls of the tales and the "devisantes" or narrators who exchange stories with their five male companions. Among the "devisantes" the dominant figure is that of Oysille, a woman who combines in an unusually positive synthesis traits which were regarded as negative in the satiric literature of the "querelle des femmes"-age, femininity and authority. Oysille's wise advice moderates the often passionate discussions that follow various narratives in the Heptameron and her Scriptural interpretations assume increasing importance as the book progresses. By the eighth day she is described as an embodiment of the Holy Spirit: Elle vouloit, avant que partir, mettre fin a la Canonicque de Saint Jan; en quoy elle s'acquita si bien, qu'il sembloit que le Saint Esprit, plein d'amour et de douceur, parlat par sa bouche.' Viewing this imposing figure as a "personnage a clef,' scholars have identified her with Marguerite de Navarre or distinguished members of her entourage.2 While interesting from a historical point of view, such extra-textual readings of the character attribute her authority to social status-power accorded automatically to the queen or a friend of the queen. A re-examination of Oysille's role in the Heptameron shows that her influence is based instead on a revision or refinement of contemporary ideals of age and widowhood. These ideals are particularly relevant to some of Oysille's companions at Cauterets-the newly-widowed Longa- rine and aging courtiers Geburon and Saffredan who must soon choose between spiritual detachment or continued and undignified pursuit of physical love. Oysille's authoritative presence is thus expressed syntag- matically, beginning with the prologue and including her subsequent interaction with fellow storytellers. Since she is part of an elaborate text whose complicated patterns encourage comparative readings, it is also developed in relation to the widows who populate various "contes" and with regard to the male-female axis that contributes so much dialectical tension to the Heptamron. Oysille makes her first appearance in the prologue: Mais une dame veuve, de longue experience, nommee Oysille, se delibera d'oublyer toute crainte par les mauvais chemins, jusques a ce qu'elle fut venue h Notre Dame de Serrance, non qu'elle fut si supersticieuse, qu'ell pensat que la glorieuse Vierge Marie laissat la dextre de son fiz, ou elle est, pour venir demeurer en terre deserte, mais seulement pour envye de voir le devot lieu, dequel elle avoit tant oy parler. Aussi qu'elle etoit seure, s'il y 52</page><page sequence="2">avoit moyen d'echaper d'un danger, que les moynes devoient bien trouver. Et feit tant qu'elle y arriva, passant de si etranges lieux et si difficiles a monter et decendre que son aage et poisanteur ne la garderent point d'aler la plus par du chemin h pie. (p. 12) Widowhood accounts for Oysille's being a solitary traveller, directing her servants without masculine supervision and assuming the responsibility for her own decisions. Age is related to the wisdom gleaned from expe- rience and meditation. As a practical traveller, Oysille consults the monks who can direct her to safe roads and bridges. Since the route pursued by the characters in the prologue can also be read metaphorically as the voyage of life, with bears and robbers symbolizing hazards along the way, Oysille is also the Christian traveller who places her trust in Provi- dence and successfully copes with obstacles that arise on her journey. The expression "aage et poisanteur" is Marguerite's only concession to the weaknesses brought on by advancing years and, in keeping with her positive portrayal of Oysille, she stresses the determination with which the character overcomes bodily fatigue. For Oysille, age is a season of wis- dom and a final testing of the will.3 Awareness of this testing is evident in her sustained spiritual vigilance. Indeed, she appears throughout the Heptameron as a woman whose faith produces serenity and moral strength, qualities which she attempts to instill, often unsuccessfully, in her fellow discussants. At Cauterets Oysille finds herself in a milieu where aging courtiers and ladies benefit from the rules of courtly etiquette. Because of her advanced years, Oysille is the first person consulted about an appropriate occupation for the group and she is also the first women to tell a story. Respect accorded her because of age and sex, however, provides only a partial explanation for her unique authority. Courteous treatment of women in the Heptameron coexists with dark currents of sexual tension. Saffredan, perhaps the most cynical of Marguerite's characters, delights in exposing the enduring contrast between public deference and the private reality of masculine dominance: Ma Dame, quand noz maitresses tienent leurs rengz en chambres ou en salles, assises h leurs ayses, comme noz juges, nous sommes h genouilz devant elles; ... mais, quand nous sommes a par, ou Amour seul et juge de noz contenances, nous swavons tres bien qu'elles sont femmes, et nous hommes. (p. 78) Age, wisdom and even virtue provide scant protection for the woman who thwarts the course of man's desire. In the fourth novella the lady-in- waiting, whose age and common sense place her in a category with Oysille, advises her mistress not to punish a would-be lover for fear of harming her reputation. Although the women discussants view the duenna as an ally in the struggle to defend their honor, Hircain argues that the lover should have murdered her and then raped his lady. As an obstacle in the love situation the older woman forfeits her very right to exist.4 Behind Hircain's attitude are centuries of satiric poetry embodying 53</page><page sequence="3">the perception of old women as ugly, offensive and diabolical, particu- larly when they dare to assert their sexual identity either by falling in love or interfering in the love affairs of others.5 Oysille is spared the antagonism directed towards the "vieilles" of satiric literature because she never attempts to attract masculine desire and cannot be regarded as an imme- diate obstacle to masculine will. Deep piety situates her in the domain of spiritual transcendance. Because it guarantees her acceptance of second- ary status in a patriarchal society, piety also makes her a comfortable, even reassuring, feminine presence. Nourished by Biblical readings that imply divine sanction for the male-dominated governments of the ancient world, Oysille views the subordinate role of women as part of a Providen- tial order. Her submissiveness is shown early in the Heptameron as she defers to Hircain and rejects the leadership role offered her in choosing the pastime of the group. Although she insists on feminine dignity and responsible behavior for husbands, Oysille demands that wives be faith- ful, patient and obedient. Her attitude in this matter cannot fail to endear her to the married discussants whose philandering makes them especially fearful of being cuckolded. A strong but conservative woman who presents no threat to mascu- line supremacy, Oysille can be recognized as a mother-figure by both men and women at Cauterets. At times she is content to send her compan- ions off for a good night's sleep. More often, she shares with them the spiritual nourishment she has found in Scripture. While the idea of a woman preaching the word of God would not have been welcomed by all Marguerite's contemporaries, none of the discussants suggest that she has ursurped a teaching authority vested only in men. Group discussion of the Bible effectively fulfills a spiritual need which the local clergy cannot meet. The monks, as worldly in some ways as the "devisants" gather to listen to the story-telling and, like their guests, are late for vespers. The abbot receives the unfortunate travellers only because they have political influence. In such a context Oysille's spirituality shines with compelling brilliance, but it is undoubtedly significant that her Scriptural commen- tary is situated outside the chapel in an informal setting. There is no suggestion that she anticipates moder feminists in their demand for priestly dignity. Oysille's conduct derives, in fact, from a conservative ideal based on the writings of Saint Paul and amplified by Church Fathers and Renaissance humanists. She represents the true Christian widow. Saint Paul's description of this widow emphasizes sadness and prayerfulness: Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God and contin- ueth in supplications and prayers night and day. (Tim. I.v.5) Juan Luis Vives, whose treatise De Institution Feminae Christianae reflects ideas commonly held in Renaissance Europe, greatly expands the theme of desolation: Thus Sainct Paule saieth, thus Sainct Hieronime, thus Sainct Ambrose, thus Sainct Augustine, thus all sainctes and holy men with one voyce and 54</page><page sequence="4">opinion saie, that wepyng and mournyng, solitarines and fastyng, be the moste precious dowries and ornamentes of a wydowe.6 Deprived of the husband in whom she has dutifully invested her complete identity, the widow withdraws from society, undergoing a ritual death and accepting the joylessness of her nearly solitary world. She does not, however, forget to moderate her grief. Excessive weeping is considered a sign of weak faith: Lette the wydowe make an ende of wepyng, leaste we shoulde seeme to mourne for our folkes, that are departed as thoughe we counted them cleane dead, and not absente. (p. 132)7 Vives' widow spends her remaining days in contemplation, works of charity and self denial, transferring her affection from a mortal husband to an anthropomorphic deity with masculine attributes. Her immediate rewards for this transference are social acceptance and a measure of authority. Vives encourages the widow to assume a didactic role: I woulde that a wydowe shoulde not onely speake suche wordes as might them (show) hir selfe chaste and honest, but also that might instruct the herers with learnyng, and amend them with example of hir livyng. (p. 134)8 Oysille's authority is based upon her conformity with the ideal of the Pauline widow, but she does not represent a perfect copy of the evangeli- cal model and her deviation from the expanded yet sober definition of Vives is striking. Oysille has left the cloistered environment judged suita- ble for the widow and ventures into the world. She also enjoys the pageant of life around her and combines deep piety with a sense of humor.9 The spirited exchange that follows the misogynistic novella with which Symontaut begins the story-telling draws no condemnation from Oysille. She begins her own tale "en riant" and when she sees that the discussants have been moved to tears by the edifying story she tells, she urges Saffredan to make them smile again: Si vous ne dites quelque chose pour faire rire la compagnie, je ne scai nul d'entre nous qui peut rabiller la faute que j'ai commise de la faire plorer. (p. 28) Oysille even takes some pleasure in teasing Nommerfide: Ah, par ma foy, vous en direz ce que vous voudrez, mais j'eusse mieus ayme coucher en la riviere, que de coucher avec un Cordelier. Oysille luy dit en riant; Vous scavez done bien nouer! Ce que Nommerfide trouva mauvais, pensant qu'Oysille n'eut telle estime d'elle qu'elle desyroit. Par- quoy luy dit en colere: II y en a qui ont refuse des personnes plus agr6ables qu'un Cordelier, et n'en ont point fait sonner la trompette. Oysille se prenant a rire de la voir courroucee, luy dit: Encores moins ont elle fait sonner le tabourin de ce qu'elles avoient accord6. (p. 41) Quite clearly the conventional definition of widowhood with its insistence 55</page><page sequence="5">on solitude, mourning and ritual death is being countered in the Hepta- meron by a definition based on joy, fulfillment, harmony. The word "joy" occurs repeatedly in the prologue as Oysille outlines the principles which determine her spiritual life. Reading of the Scriptures has kept her "si joyeuse et si saine," (p. 16). Meditation on the meaning of Christ's sacrifice gives her "tant de joye" (p. 16). Finally, the knowledge of God suffices to transform the character of all she experiences-"qui connoit Dieu voit toutes choses belles en luy et sans luy, tout laid," (pp. 16-17). The harmon- ious spirituality of Oysille is also foreshadowed in the prologue by her dual role as practical and spiritual traveller and emphasized throughout the text by her appearance as mother concerned with the physical and spiritual well-being of the "devisants." It is even confirmed by the diver- sity of tales she tells-the edifying example of the muleteer's wife, the evil deeds of monks, the story of the husband who makes his wife drink from the skull of her lover, the tragedy of the Chatelaine du Verger. Marguerite de Navarre's modification of the Pauline widow reflects her own joyous faith, but it also mirrors the Christian ethos of the group at Cauterets where a spirituality of gloom and asceticism is no longer acceptable. Hircain's reaction to the story of Poline and her "servi- teur" who retreat to the monastery when their love is frustrated is more than his personal opinion. It signifies general impatience with a religion too easily identified with mortification: Si melencolye et desespoir sont louables, je dirai que Poline et son serviteur sont bien dignes d'ettre louez. (p. 133) Given the prevailing distaste for melancholy, Oysille's laughter is an authentic sign of her spiritual life. The combination of benign humor with mature wisdom, of Castiglione with Saint Paul, of maternal sensitivity with the piety of the Christian widow completes the portrait of Oysille as an authoritative character whose unique influence is based on a conflation of spiritual and social ideals. Any one of Oysille's attributes can, however, generate a series of comparative readings in a text as rich as the Heptameron. We are con- cerned here only with age, widowhood and authoritative style, aspects of the character which are of primary significance in confirming or enhanc- ing her exemplary value. Oysille's role as Christian widow suggests asso- ciations with Longarine, the merchant's widow who appears in the fifty- ninth tale, and the heroine of the sixteenth novella. Since Longarine has scarcely had time to develop the character traits associated with widow- hood and the merchant's wife is linked with the topos of the "femme rusee," only the Milanese widow is a significant figure in relation to Oysille. As the tale begins she appears to be another example of the Pauline ideal, living discreetly, even "saintement" with her in-laws. The "veuve de Millan" is, however, a younger and more vulnerable woman than Oysille. She yields to her French lover after a three-year courtship and thus becomes a negative example, underscoring the uniqueness of Oysille's spiritual triumph. 56</page><page sequence="6">Frequent reference to age in the narrative frame establishes a link between Oysille, Saffredan and Geburon. The younger nobleman, Saf- fredan, is enduring a difficult transition from the abundant pleasures of youth to the relative continence of later years. There are indications that this transition is painful and that he may never achieve the serenity of Oysille. When Ennasuyte mockingly reproaches him for continuing to play the courtly lover despite his white hair, he declares himself unable to discipline his own will: Ma Damoyselle, dit Saffredan, conbien que 1'esperance m'en soit otee par celle que j'ayme, et la fureur par l'eage, si n'en scaurois diminuer la volonte. (p. 32) The fate that Saffredan may expect should he persist in his amorous behavior is not too different from that reserved for the "vieille amour- euse." Castiglione has Gaspare Pallavicino express concern over the unwielding combination of love and age in the ideal courtier: So I do not see how if he is advanced in years it is fitting for the courtier to be in love, seeing that, as has already been said this evening, in old men love is futile and what women take for agreeable courtesies pleasantries and elegance in the young are in the old inept and ridiculous follies which will cause some women to detest and everyone to deride whoever indulges them. 0 The reply to Gaspare initiates a long discussion of Neoplatonic love, an option that would logically be open to Saffredan or to Geburon who, as the eldest "devisant," seems to be a masculine parallel to Oysille. Like her, Geburon cites Biblical passages and warns against trusting the flattery of "serviteurs." Unlike Oysille, however, Geburon is inconsistent. Solemn warnings to women give way to statements that seem to encourage the very confidence he denounces. He confesses, moreover, that his moraliz- ing is founded on what Montaigne will subsequently describe as the cowardly repentance of age: II est bien vray, dit Geburon, que j'ai maintenant parle contre ce que j'ai toute ma vie tenu. Mais pour ce que j'ai les dentz si foibles que je ne puis plus macher de venaison, j'averti les pauvres biches de se garder des veneurs, pour satisfaire sur ma vieillesse des maus que j'ai desirez en ma junesse. (p. 118) The character is flawed by the admission that his virtue emanates from repressed desire and Oysille again emerges from a comparative reading as an embodiment of unparalleled spiritual excellence. The authority represented by Oysille as an attenuated and more joyous model of the Christian widow generates comparisons with an opposing authority system embedded in Hircain, Saffredan and Symon- taut. While Oysille is associated with the transcendant, the spiritual, the egoless, the three men can be considered a single actant related to the 57</page><page sequence="7">immanent, the worldly, the egotistical. As members of a patriarchical society, the Hircain-Saffredan-Symontaut triad enjoys a recognized right to command. Although expressing reverence for the Bible, these men generally cite the law of nature as the basis for their superior status. Unwritten and therefore supremely flexible, the law of nature expresses itself in their masculinity, their physical strength, their procreative capac- ity. It justifies their desires and the use of force to subdue unresponsive or impudent women. It can be used to attack chastity as in this argument identifying the virtue of the "femme de bien" with pride: C'est une gloire et cruaute, par laquelle esperent d'aquerir nom d'immortal- ite, et ainsi si glorifiantes de resister au vice de la loy de nature, si nature est vicieuse, se font non seulment semblables aus bestes inhumaines et cruelles, mais aus Diables desquelz elles prenent l'orgueil et la malice. (p. 191) Saffredan's reference to the Roman de la rose shows that nature can also be made to reflect an ideal of irresponsible copulation: Nous sommes faitz beauls filz sans doutes, Toutes pour pous, et tous pour toutes. (p. 54) Oysille never expresses herself with the arrogance or the sophistry associated with the Hircain-Saffredan-Symontaut triad and she claims no importance in secular matters. Her decision to leave the choice of a social pastime for the group to the will of the majority reflects the modest demeanor expected of a "femme de bien." When Oysille assumes an authoritative manner, she does not speak as herself but plays the role of disciple. She thus uses a borrowed voice, an apostolic voice, to reproach Hircain and his wife for their laziness or challenge the cynicism of Saffre- dan. Oysille's complete identification with this spiritual voice proves her ability to transcend the narrow categories of self. While her authority in the Heptameron is predominantly spiritual, however, Oysille's femininity cannot be ignored. The qualities that promote her mystical progress- modesty, gentleness, self-denial, submission to external authority figures (father, husband, God) are those associated with the "femme de bien" as daughter, wife and, above all, widow. The qualities cultivated by the men at Cauterets in performing their social roles-dominance, pride, the cult of honor-seem scarcely compatible with the Christian goal of moral progress. As an exemplary figure, Oysille calls attention to the superior virtues of the cheerful Christian widow and to the chronic imbalance that exists around her. She is an expression of Marguerite's confidence in feminine dignity and a reflection of her belief that virtue is rare, that it may be even more elusive for men than for women because the world which accords so many privileges to Hircain, Saffredan and Symontaut can easily distort their spiritual perspective and frustrate their moral growth.
