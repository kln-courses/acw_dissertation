<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRA n MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ Introduction Metaphysics or Hikmah, according to Mulla Sadra, is intended to gain knowledge of the ultimate reality and meaning of the objects of the universe and to judge their ontological status according to human capacity. In other words, Hikmah means a consistent intellectual understanding of the universe according to human capacity. 1 Mulla Sadra asserts that his metaphysics or Hikmah is neither scholastic polemic, nor sophistic fallacy, nor pedantic and discursive philosophy, but basically it is intellectual and gnostic intuition buttressed by revealed tradition.2 Because meticulous ratiocination can never be the purveyor of metaphysical truth. For it moves along its narrow grooves step by step groping and weighing factors for and against ? an effort comparable with the vain effort of the eye to see itself or of a kitten chasing its own tail. As Shakespeare has said, "there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy." But Intellectual intuition fulminates infinitely and is, therefore, capable of cutting the Gordian knots of metaphysical mysteries. That is why Mulls Sadra asserts that whoever is not endowed with intuitive vision, has no knowledge. (*) ^ V *J J?S~ V ^) Thus a vision of the metaphysical trans parency of things can be gained primarily with the help of revelation and intellectual intuition. To trust reason alone in philosophizing about the ultimates is to unleash the dark forces of the irrational and the arbitrary. In the view of Mulla Sadra , the quest for metaphysical truth is as old as humanity itself. It is the Sophia perennis which has always been an esoteric aspect of the Prophetic phenomenon. He, therefore, maintains that Hikmah began with the Prophet Adam and his Son, s^eeth, who handed it over to Hermes or to the Prophet Idris, who, in turn, spread it throughout the world.4 According to him, there were five pillars of Hik mah among the Greek thinkers?Pythagoras, Empedocles, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle?who acquired Hikmah from different Prophets, as Empe docles received it from David and Pythagoras from Solomon.5 Thus it</page><page sequence="2">292 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ is God who has caused ?ikmah to be diversified in different forms so as to make a thinker understand according to his particular genius.6 The religious point of view emanates from God, whereas the meta physical point of view proceeds primarily from the intellectual intuition of man. That is why Mulla Sadra compares metaphysics with the phenome non of man. Just as man is a Being composed of divine spiritual form (-ajjJ tjye) and of created sensible matter, ~&lt;oL?) or otherwise put, human soul has two dimensions, material and immaterial (*j*&gt; 3 likewise Hikmah also has become divided into two aspects or two sciences, one being theoretical and transcendental C**^** and the other practi cal and physical "4^)7 The aim of the former is to enrich human soul with metaphysical wisdom in order to actualize its ontological integrity and thus become an intelligible world (J* ^) itself. The Prophetic tradition, 'Oh, God, show as things as they are,' indicates this aspect of Hikmah. The latter is a practical procedure whose aim is to make soul rule over the body or to make the kernel dominate over the carnal. The Prophetic tradition, "adorn yourselves with the attributes of God," refers to this aspect of Hikmah.8 Thus the bipolarization of man into matter and soul, divinity and dust, accounts for the division of Hikmah into two aspects theoretical and practical?a fact to which the Qur'an refers categorically. The Qur'an describes the pre-temporal spiritual form of man as the 'best stature' (piy* Cr^]) which was the archytypal station of man in the world of divine command (^Vl ^JU) and calls his terrestrial condition condition 'the lowest of the low' JA-t) which is the temporal, spatial and worldly station of man in which he has been exiled to matter and ignorance. The verse, 'except those who believe' (yJ" d3-^ ^ ) refers to the purpose of Hikmat Nazariyyah and the verse, 'those who do good deeds,' (oUJUJi^U 3) indicates to the Hikmat 'amaliyyah.9 Mulla Sadra maintains that all theosophs have spoken of these two aspects of Hikmah of which the aim is to become Godlike in gaining a comprehensive knowledge of everything (oLjUJIj -&lt;a&gt;uVi) and in transcend ing the bondage of matter (oyu~*j| ^ ^*xJl). That is why God calls Himself Hakim in the Qur'an because He is the inexhaustible source of all know ledge and wisdom and describes Hikmah as His great gift for mankind. 10 It should be noted that man can become Godlike only in the sense that he is a theomorphic Being and this theomorphism must not be confused with anthropomorphism. Man can become Godlike in some of His qualities but God is not man-like. Man has something of God but God has nothing of man.</page><page sequence="3">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRX 293 The importance of Hikmah lies in the fact that it gives supreme priority to the knowledge of Being. According to Mulla Sadra, the problem of Being is the source of all the principles of metaphysics; it is the centre around which all the principles of metaphysical doctrines such as the knowledge of God, problem of soul, problem of creation and eschatology etc, revolve. He, therefore, maintains that whoever is ignorant of the problem of Being is ignorant of all the basic problems of metaphysics.H Theory of Being or Ontology In our previous article, we discussed a great deal Mulla Sadra's theory of Being or Ontology. Here we will furnish an account of those points which have not yet been touched on. According to Mulla Sadra, Being (-w) is an objective reality and the source of all power and action and is, therefore, principial (J^')- While Mahyiyyah ("^^) or quiddity is the limit of Being, only to be abstracted by mind without having any reality independent of Being and is, therefore, accidental and ambiguous. What includes all objects under one reality is their Being and what limits and separates them is the quiddity of their Being. Every thing is understandable only when it is considered in terms of Being, other wise everything seems ambiguous, problematic and fictitious. Because Being is the raison de'tre of everything. Being is invariably non-mani fested but metaphysically real, while quiddity is the manifestation of Being but metaphysically unreal. Being is infinite in nature and as such no object, which is finite, can be equated with it and therefore no object can be equated with God, who is the Absolute Being. Being encompasses everything under one reality in such a manner that there is not to be found anything outside of it. That is why one cannot prove Being because one cannot go outside of it. It transcends logical categories such as genus, species, differentia etc, and therefore it has no definition and what has no definition has no logical proof and direct evidence. 12 Now it is clear that Being is non-manifested, metaphysical and undefinable, nonetheless it forces itself upon us because it is the self-evident a priori truth, clearer than defin ing words, prior to all concepts and the reality of everything!3 which other wise would not exist. No thought can circumscribe it and no language can exhaust it. Now the question arises: how do we know a Being? The reply is that it is the first object that strikes our understanding. That is why Mulla ?adra asserts that the knowledge of Being can be gained only by keen</page><page sequence="4">294 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ observation and intuitive vision and by drawing conclusions from its effects, signs and symbols?a procedure by which a partial knowledge of Being can be obtained. Thus the intuitive and visionary knowledge of Being and the grasp of the ambiguous character of its quiddity will leave no doubt about the objective reality of Being. Being is the reality itself and not a thing that has been made real. 14 While elaborating this point, Mulla Sadra argues that Being as it is Being has no cause, no matter to be transformed into it, no place to alight upon and no form to be confused with it, rather it is the cause of all causes, form of all forms and the ulti mate reality of all. 15 Being has no matter and, therefore, has no form, rather it is the reality of form itself and confers forms on others. It does not need anything to be introduced and pointed out, rather everything is knowable and understandable on account of it. It does not need any evidence because it is the evidence itself and is, therefore, evidence for all. 16 Being is with all objects because it is their reality but at the same time it is irreducible to any object. For it is ubiquitous metaphysically and possesses a mysterious dimension or an infinite sphere whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere, and we, therefore, touch it every where and nowhere. Likewise, God, who is the Absolute Being, is ubi quitous despite His Ineffable transcendence and inviolable mystery and we, therefore, touch Him everywhere and nowhere.17 According to Mulla Sadra, Being is one reality and Ontological homogeneity but it has different gradations such as Absolute and relative, perfect and imperfect. It eludes our sense-perception on account of its metaphysical nature. Our eye cannot catch it because it is anterior to eye or it is identified with the reality of the eye and the eye cannot see itself, that is its reality. As God says in the Qur'an. "The eyes attain Him not, but He attains the eyes; He is All-subtle and AU-aware."i8 As Being eludes our sense-perception likewise it transcends our mental comprehen sion. Our mind is very prone to remain confined to abstract concepts and we are incapable of thinking any Being without enclosing it in our abstract concepts which is not Being, rather it is the quiddity of Being. That is why Mulla Sadra asserts that for Being there is no other mental or subjec tive existence.^ It is invariably an objective reality and the source of all power and effect. We find that objective fire burns and reduces things to ashes, whereas the abstract concept of fire cannot produce such result. Thus as an objective reality Being is the most evident and clearest of all, but its comprehension is the poorest. Moreover, in our mental analysis, Being</page><page sequence="5">METAPHYSICS OF MULLS SADR5 295 and its quiddity are different things although in objective world they are inseparable from each other. That is why Being is irreducible to the categories of quiddity; in itself it is a very subtle (^) thing.20 To sum up, we can have a glimpse of Being with the help of intuitive vision and can be faintly conscious of it by observing its effect and action. Being is not the product of human mind; it exists independently of any think ing mind. Our senses and mind can grasp only the quiddity of Being, while Being is inaccessible to our sense-perception and mental comprehension. In fact, it is quiddity which tends to be an impenetrable veil between us and our Being. Though quiddity in itself does not have the wherewithal to exist apart from Being, it appears in Being, with Being and from Being and in itself its status is very problematic and ambiguous,21 nonetheless it is identified with the limits and determinations of Being, and hence, its role of being an impregnable veil. And what is veil between us and our Being is, in the ultimate analysis, a veil between us and the Absolute Being. Thus quiddity is a veil between us and God.22 As a poet has said (jio J^Uj 1*U. jlyi Jm c-Hlji jl). In a general sense, Being partakes of two gradations, Absolute and relative or real and quasi-real. The Absolute Being is one who is immune from and transcendent of the characteristics of non Being, that is quiddity and its categories such as universals and particulars, accidents time, space, motion etc. Quiddity and its categories are called non-Being because they lack independence of existence. Thus God?who is the Absolute Being?has no quiddity or quiddity is inconceivable for Him, because He is Infinite and above all limitation and determination. The Absolute Being is also called Necessary Being. (*y?J\ v^ij) The relative Being is one who is mixed with the characteristics of non-Being, that is quiddity and its categories.23 All relative Beings are created and are also called possible Beings (oi^C^ ). A possible Being is one whose both Being and nothingness are possible at the same time.24 Thus all possible Beings are tinged with accidents and mingled with contingency. They are ontologically dis-integrated and impoverished because their Beings are embedded in quiddity or Beings diffused in separative illusion. In other words, creation is woven of ontological unity and homogeneity and accidental separation and mutliplicity. But the transcendent unity of Being lies hidden under the veil of muliplicity which is nothing but a sepa rative illusion. In one sense, Being is ambiguous because it is Absolute</page><page sequence="6">296 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ essentially, while being situated in relativity. Likewise God, despite His incommunicable Absoluteness and indecipherable mystery, is present, active and the decisive factor at the centre of every creaed order. It should be noted that Being and unity are identical with and inseparable from each other. But the unity of possible Beings is weak, rather their unity is union and union implies composition and all possible Beings are, therefore, subjected to composition in multiple forms and varied combinations &amp;j cf~ JO ("^asfy V5" j1)- For example, they are composed of Being and quiddity, unity and multiplicity, matter and form, substance and accident, body and soul, potentiality and actuality. Thus Mulla Sadra maintains that the unity of possible Beings is very poor and may be called a mere shadow of the perfect unity of the Absolute Being.24 According to Mulla Sadra, there is no possibility ( oKJ ) or possible aspect in the Absolute Being. He is the Necessary and the Absolute (^1^1) from all points of view. There is no waiting state (- ^ -aJU) i.e., potential state in Him, because He is the perfect Actuality.26 Thus God alone is the acme of all perfection, beauty and power; He alone is ontological plentitude, Infinite knowledge and unbounded consciousness and He alone is the Absolute Being of which the Beings of creation are a mere reflection and manifestation. Mulla Sadra maintains that to God, the knower (the known (and the knowledge (pi*) are one and the same thing. His knowledge knows Beings of the different ontological strata in their simultaneity as well as in their succession through temporal duration.27 While knowing their Beings, He equally knows their becom ing; while knowing their substance, He equally knows their accidents; and while knowing their ontological unity, He equally knows their tem poral multiplicity. Thus nobody should raise the question that God's knowledge is subject to change because creation is changeable. Mulla ?adra asserts that only God can furnish perfect definition of the creation, while creation can define Him only symbolically and in an imperfect manner. Because cause contains the effect totally, while effect does not contain the cause.28 Thus God is unqualified and unqualifiable as He is undefined and undefinable. According to Mulla Sadra, there is a certain object of knowledge but it is unknown and unknownable, while there is a known thing but it is not knowledge. As God is infinite knowledge and light, but is unknow able by others,29 while there is falsehood which is known but is not know ledge. He classifies knowledge into two categories, the one is subtle ()</page><page sequence="7">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRS 297 and the other is mixed (v^V*). The former implies congition or percep tion of something while one is unconscious of this cognition and is incapable of passing any judgement (ji^) on it. Everybody possesses this subtle cognition ?-*V0 of God?a cognition which is ingrained in his primordial nature.("&lt;&gt;&gt;*)30 In the view of Mulla Sadra, a direct cognition of an object implies the cognition of its Being, whether that cognition be sensible or empirical (Jy**-) or imaginative, (JW^) or intellective (J**) or intuitive (&lt;Sjy**). It is obvious that a relative Being is the reflection of the Ab solute Being, and the cognition of a relative Being will therefore, lead to the cognition of the Absolute Being in a certain manner, although one is unconscious of and indifferent to it. But this subtle cognition does not at all mean the cognition of the Ineffable Divine Aseity.31 The mixed cognition (u^r* ?-*V0 may be acquired by intuitive vision and observation.a knowledge realizable specially by sages and saints. It may be gained by genuine discursive method ? a procedure which is invariably vulnerable to errors and blunders. As a poet has said," olf I jsib jfcb . cSjlai lj oiji j? jiil.&gt;)32. It should be noted that nobody can know God with the help of formal empirical know ledge, (cSj^t Jy^i\ pU)l). Every possible Being can be conscious of the Absolute Being according to the degree of its ontological awareness. While explaining the nature of Divine ubiquity, Mulla Sadra main tains that the encompassing (~aIU) of every thing by God and His together ness with all can be compared symbolically with the enompassing of body by soul. The soul is neither inside the body, nor outside of it, not attached to it, nor detached from it, nonetheless it permeates the whole body and no particle of the Body can be independent of the soul?a fact which symbolizes the mysterious ubiquity and metaphysical togetherness of God with the whole created order (ob^) without thereby being in carnated into (J&gt;K). or united with or penetrated into (Jy-&gt;) or attached to (&lt;JWI) or detached from (juai) any object of the created order. Thus His everlasting presence with the creation is humanly ineff able and unimaginable.33 Quoting Ghazali, Mulla Sadra writes that in a whirlwind we only see the mass of dust but we don't see the wind which is the real generator of the whirlwind. While the dust does not participate in producing this movement, nonetheless it is manifested but the wind which is the real producer of the whirlwind is invariably non-manifested.34</page><page sequence="8">298 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ Thus God is mysteriously present and immanent everywhere in the universe as a Motionless Mover and as an Absolule subconscious. Creation Now let us discuss the crucial problem of creation of which Mulla Sadra has expounded a very consistent and systematic idea. According to him, creation has come into existence through two processes, one is called IbdS' (?i^0 and the other is called Takwin The process of Ibda' may be called non-formal creation which is the emanation {^) of a chain of subtle Beings from God starting from intellect, soul, nature and ultimately ending in prime matter. The process of Takwin may be called formal creation which consists of a chain of composed Beings (otT^) starting from matter, natural bodies, plant kingdom, animal world and ending in human beings. The Beings of the former are subtle (kn) because they are not composed of matter and form, rather they have only Being which is their form and are, therefore, totally immune from matter.35 And what is not composed of matter is not composed of oppo sites because matter is the matrix of all opposites and what is not composed of opposities is immune from change, decay and disintegration.36 Thus the chain of subtle Beings ( * * * * ) are imperishable and incorrup tible. But the chain of composed Beings are primarily composed of matter and form and they are, therefore, subject to change, decay, corrup tion, death and dissolution. It should be noted that the subtle Beings are subject to death only once and at a single point. While the formal com posed Beings have four causes,?active, material, formal and final?, the non-formal subtle Beings have only two causes, active and final.37 To sum up, creation as a whole starts with intellect and ends in human beings who are the bearer of this intellect, because extremes meet. In fact, crea tion is the journey of the soul form God towards God traversing many ontological ups and down, rises and falls.38 Thus the process of Ibd5' means that there is a chain of Beings starting from intellect but it has been diminished to the pole of matter; wh?le the process of Takwin, means that there is a chain of Beings starting from matter but has been elevated to the rank of intellect. In other words, Ibda' means that intellect falls and becomes reduced to matter and Takwin means matter rises to that intellect again. While explaining the process of creation, Mulla Sadra maintains that the first emanation from God could not be other than intellect. Be cause soul lacks independence in producing any effect, body lacks unity,</page><page sequence="9">metaphysics of mullx sadra 299 matter lacks actuality and accident lacks independence of Being, but intellect possesses all these qualities in a perfect manner because pure Being contains all the possibilities of weak Beings, as the higher presupposes the lower39. As the chain of Beings in the process of Ibda' descends down and becomes further removed from the centre, the principle of Being in each successive stage becomes weaker and poorer, while the manifestation of quiddity, in turn, becomes stronger and cumulative. Prime matter is, thus, the crystallization of fall, of the process of Ibda* because it is the extreme limit or border of this process.40 The Ontological integrity of the process of Ibdl' has been blurred through fall because it is a movement from ontological fluidity to the solidity of matter which is considered to be the most weighted and the most broken existence of all. As a result, the Being of matter has become problematic and its unity ambiguous41. That is why Plato called it non-Being. Its ontological status has become so obscure that matter as such is nowhere to be found or seen, it is invari ably hidden under some form. Now it is clear that the non-formal subtle Beings were at the origin of this segmented and coagulated substance we call matter. In fine, matter is a Being most remote from God?a remoteness which accounts for its fallen state. That is why, according o Mulla Sadra, it has become dissipated through all directions, its parts have sepa rated from one another; it is, as it were, indifferent to itself, absent to itself and is unable to remember and recollect itself42. Since in the first emanation?which Mulla Sadra calls by different names such as the 'extended Being' or the 'sacred Effusion' (j-urtl ^i) or the 'First Intellect' (JjVi j*Jl)-the manifestation of Being is the strongest becauses of its supreme contiguity to the centre, the influence of quiddity is not at all discernible in it except in mental analysis. But at the level of prime matter, the influence of quiddity has become the strongest and most cumulative, while the influence of Being is not at all perceptible. Thus, matter is almost indentical with quiddity or contin gency and quiddity is, according to Mulla Sadra, akin to possibility and matter is, therefore, akin to possibility.43 it is clear now that matter, possibility and quiddity are identical with one another and they go hand in hand. In other words, matter is the crystallization of possibility of which the trace is to be found in the phenomenon of creation. That is why created Beings are called possible Beings. To sum up, matter is the embodiment of chaos and disorder?a source of opposites, multiplicity,</page><page sequence="10">300 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ evil, corruption, decay and death.44 But Divine cosmic economy has conferred upon it a kind life in order to prevent it from drifting into nothingess. Thus it has been given the potentiality to accept different forms one after the other. Matter is, therefore, mere potency determinable by form?which is its actuality and neither matter nor form can exist apart, for they are inseparable as our body cannot dissociate itself from senses. Divine cosmic economy desires to start a new process of creation from matter and with matter called Takwin in order to save the process of Ibda' and to effectuate the return journey of the fallen possible Beings back to their Absolute Being. Thus the chain of formal or composed Beings starts from prime matter and ends in human Beings. Primarily this is the process of combination of opposite elements and forces. As mentioned above, matter, possibility and quiddity are identical with one another. Mulla Sadra maintains that matter wants form, possibility needs composition which is its form and quiddity seeks all kinds of acci dents.45 Thus the Beings of Takwin are composed of multiple elements, subjected to manifold accidents and are, therefore, victim of various limi tations and determination at one and the same time Just as water when shaken becomes dispersed in innumerable drops, so likewise, the Being of Takwin becomes segmented and solidified in innumerable particular sub jects?a fact which accounts for the endless and ceaseless multiplicity of the world. As speech and book represent the knowledge and creative intellect of a speaker and a writer, likewise all the gradations of Beings represent the infinite knowledge and inexhaustible creative power of God .46 But the gradations of composed Beings are, as it were, words of God written by Him with the ink of matter.47 As God says in the Qur'an, "Say: If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would be spent before the words of my Lord are spent, though we brought replenishment the like of it."48 To sum up, the process of Ibda' is a transition from unity to multiplicity (^l^l and the process of Takwin is a movement from multiplicity to unity &gt;*~?y)49 Because man is the culminating point of the whole process of creation. He is the synthetic totality of the cosmogonic unfolding. Creation of Man According to Mulla Sadra, man is the last creation in the processes of IbdS' and Takwin. He is like a reduced image of the cosmogonic</page><page sequence="11">METAPHYSICS OF MULLX SADR5 301 unveiling because all the ontological possibilities that have been unveiled in the processes of Ibda' and Takwin?intellect, soul, matter, natural ele ments, vegetative soul, animal soul and the rational soul?are synthetically integrated in man. That is why man is called the qualitative epitome of the whole creation. He reflects cosmic totality despite his littleness and limitations.50 Though he is made of matter and is, therefore, corruptible and perishable, nonetheless in the centre of his Being there is an opening towards the Infinite, that is his intellect?bound soul. Human intellect flashes out like lightning in the heaviness, hardness and opacity of matter as fiint produces fire. Mulla Sadra maintains that the supreme aim of the creation of man is that human intellect would give unqualified witness to the unity and Absoluteness of God.51 Because other species of the process of Takwin are not even capable of being conscious of the Absolute. For they are tied to many barriers of fall, imprisoned in natural blemishes and swathed in many bondages of matter. As mentioned above, matter is the crystallization of fall; it is unconscious and forgetful of itself and is therefore, unconscious and obli vious of God too. It is obvious that what is made of matter will also be characterized with the qualities of matter. That is why the process of Takwin has been aimed at the riddance (j^w) from the bondage of matter in successive stages of Beings. Thus God created with matter four kinds of species in successive stages,?inanimate objects, plant kingdom, animal world and human beings and each one is swathed in some bondage or other?in order to prove that human beings are very near to the emanci pation from the bondages of matter, from the dumbness and sedantary character of plant kingdom, and from the sensual desire and blind passion of the animal world.52 These four stages of Takwin are, as it were, four legs tied to the various bondages born of matter and fall. Thus the process of Takwin at the human level has freed itself from the bondages of three legs and the human leg remains imprisoned and it is upto man to realize com plete riddance Explaining these points, Mulla Sadra maintains that the barrier of three legs are to be found in animal world?which implies that animals are rooted in matter and steeped in the fallen state; while man possesses three signs of riddance from matter. Firstly, in animal there is the barrier of blindness to observe and understand the meaning, signs and symbols (obi) of God in creation, secondly there is to be found the barrier of deafness to listen to discussions, lectures and proof of God; thirdly there is to be seen the barrier of ignorance and forgetfulness of God.</page><page sequence="12">302 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ As God says in the Qur'an, "They have hearts, but understand not with them, they have eyes, but perceive not with them; they have ears, but they hear not with them. They are like cattle ;"53 But man possesses these three qualities which indicate to his attaining riddance from these three barriers. Mulla ?adra maintains that these three barriers are strengthened by other three barriers giving witness to them. The first is the barrier of their tongue which is a witness to their deafness because tongue is the agent of the ear; the second is the barrier of their hand which is a witness to their blindness because the forking hand is the agent of the eye; the third is the crookedness of their body which is a witness to the crookedness of their soul because body is the agent of the soul, as the curve of a scabbared is a proof of the curve of a sword.54 Thus their natural and congenital blemishes and horizontal position suffice to rivet them to animality. Only man is freed from these barriers and is, therefore, capable of restoring the broken link with the Divine kingdom. Thus plant kingdom is condemned to fixity and sedentariness and animal kingdom is rivetted to animality?a fact that symbolizes their inability to become a total and perfect Being capable of having an access to the Divine kingdom. But man with his gift of speech, mutual communication, his vertical position, detached from the ground, symbolizes his eligibility to reestabish the broken link with God.55 It should be noted that those who are in matter and form ("^ j "^u) animal are not wretched and accursed, rather those humans who have assumed animal form. As the Qur'an says, "They are like cattle; nay, rather they are further astray. Those_they are the heedless."56 Thus it is form, rather than matter, which is important and a determining factor. Thus man is very near to attaining complete riddance from matter. That is why God has opened many windows in his hard and heavy frame work of matter. Some windows are projected to the sensible world such as the external five senses and some others to the intelligible world such as imagination, apprehension, intellection and intuition. Every door is designed to be an outlet for his soul to grasp a certain cosmic reality, wonder and secret.57 It is only man who can actualize complete freedom ( * *) from matter and can, thus, neutralize the fallen state. That is why Mulla ?adra asserts that in this sense the human stage is, as it were, the resurrec tion of the whole process of Takwln,58 Because on the one hand man can become imaginatively and intellectually conscious of the Absolute, His mysterious ubiquity and and ineffable transcendence, and on the</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRA 303 other hand, he can be aware of his littleness, limitations, fallen state and manifold blemishes. This imaginative and intellectual consciousness implies detachment, outsidedness and withdrawl from matter?a fact that will lead to complete and total riddance. While explaining that man is the totality of the cosmogonic unfold ing, Mulla ?adra maintains that man has two faces or two forms, one is physical and as such is changeable, corruptible, and mortal and the other is psychic and is, therefore, subtle and immortal. The life of the former depends on the latter and if their connection is cut off, the former at once meets death and disintegration. The physical form of man originates from sperm, which is like prime matter; and then through gradual becom ing, it undergoes five stages of transition such as prime matter, natural body, plant, animal and man. Thus man, besides his human faculties, integrates into himself all the faculties of previous stages, because the higher presup poses the lower. Likewise, the psychic form of man begins with the descent of the soul in the womb of mother and getting it merged with the sperm? a stage of ambiguity like prime matter and it is, therefore, called 'pure nature.' From the stage of 'pure nature', the soul goes ahead stage by stage, accumulating various faculties and assuming new names at every stage such as the power of mixed temperament ("^el)^ the vegetative soul or growing soul (^Ul jl ?g'Ul ^i), animal soul (v'x*M ^0 the practi cal intellect (J^Jl J*Ji), the theoretical (&lt;s^ cH?)&gt; the imaginative soul (opsji ^i), the remembering soul (a&amp;wi ^l), the rational soul ^l) and at last when the soul actualizes its intuitive vision and observation and thereby experiences union with the Divine kingdom, it is called "the exalted soul" (cr-^i c^O59 or 'Acquired Intellect' (^Ux^Jl ji*Jl). This is the highest stage of the soul in which all bipolarization between body and soul, matter and form, unity and multiplicity would disappear. Body would become identified with the soul, senses would merge together, potentiality would be absorbed by actuality and all multiplicity would be fused into an ontological unity. Mulla Sadra quotes a poet to depict the idea 3 *X 3 CJLiVj s? i3&amp; - Jft&amp;j j ItAAd yM\ cij 3 Oj".60 It is now clear that at the highest stage of the soul, man becomes imma culate Intellect, while body and soul recede into the background. Accord ing to the Prophet of Islam, Intellect was the first creation of God and it was like a seed of creation. As seed contains the whole tree, likewise Intellect contains the whole universe. Thus at the stage of 'Acquired intellect,' man contains the whole univese and that is why he is called the</page><page sequence="14">304 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ reduced image or synthetic totality of the whole cosmogonic process. Thus creation begins with intellect and ends in human being who is the bearer of this intellect. Man, therefore, completes at the end what was initiated at the beginning. It should be noted that the process of Ibda' is pretemporal, non spatial and motionless, while the process of Takwln is temporal, spatial and is subjected to motion. Likewise man had also a pre-temporal, non spatial stage, an archetypal state, a state of ontological integrity and of immaculate intellect while has been described by the Qur'Sn as the 'best stature' (p*y&gt; ). While quoting a prophetic tradition that men are treasures, like the treasures of gold and silver j c-^i ojUTlpU^ o-ui) Mulla Sadra maintains that gold and silver are sacred metals and they symbolically reflect the sun and moon, spirit and soul, and also the heavenly human pair, Adam and Eve. But through fall they were exiled to matter and condemned to ignorance?a state which a has been described by the Qur'an as the "lowest of the low". Thus they fall from ontological unity to the multiplicity of matter, from metaphysical conscious ness to the scandalous physical consciousness and from eternity to time, Space and motion. To sum up, from the point of view of 'Ahsan Taqwim* man is a priori intellect, pure and simple: while from the point of view of Asfali Safilin, man is intellect but bipolarized into body and soul, divinity and dust. He is, therefore, dualism and multiplicity. But the state of 'Asfali Safilin' is not the total negation of 'Ahsan Taqwim'. As fire is dormant in a flint, likewise intellect is dormant in man. If he frees himself from the illusory bondages of matter and purifies his soul from the dross of nature, he would regain his lost station of 'Ahsan Taqwim. Thus the intellect-bound man is like a double-edged sword. If he realizes his intellect, he would reach God, otherwise he is liable to become the disciple of Satan. That is why Mulla Sadra asserts that man is a road leading either to God or to the hell.62 He, therefore, compares Satan with an evil or wretched tree ("^V^1 &gt;/*?Ji) and compares intellect with a holy tree (&lt;^&gt;"^) or a blessed tree -aTjU); it is rooted in the immutable and unfathomable divine mystery, while its branches envelop the heaven (*i?~j! J j c^ti wm); it is timeless, non-spatial, dimensionless, neither eastern nor western ("a^Vj ). It becomes the whole of creation.63 Thus human intellect is the metaphysical synthesis of the whole creation. Man is, therefore, the greatest sign of God and an abridgement of the 'Guarded Tablet" (j^~ ^3).</page><page sequence="15">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRA 305 Because he alone can give witness to what is unseen, unheard, unimaginable and indescribable.64 It should be noted that Mulla Sadra has never used the word intellect (j**) in its commonplace sense. To him it is something divine and universal and is what the Greeks used to call 'Nous'. It, therefore, should not be confused with the fragmentary intellect &lt;j^) that has been spoken of as 'reason' by Descartes.65 Moreover, Mulla Sadra dis cusses the idea of 'fall' in his metaphysics which should not be confused with the Christian concept of fall. His concept of fall is of Qur'anic origin. According to him, fall, whether be it on the global or human level, is a necessary manifestation of evil. But in another sense, it is an ineluct able aspect of the cosmogonic drama and an indispensable mode of the divine veiling and unveiling. It is the crystallization of the exteriority of the manifestation of Being. The mystery of life and death, secret of creation, illusion of time, space and motion, and the ephemeral, ambiguous and precarious nature of mundane life?all these problems are understandable and explainable only when they are considered in terms of fall. It is an undeniable cosmic fact and not mere story. It would be absurd, therefore, to recoil from such an idea on the plea that it has biblical origin. Soul As mentioned above, man is a priori intellect but bipolarized into body and soul on account of the loss of the state of 'Ahsan Taqwlm'. According to Mulla Sadra, body is like matter and soul is its form, and soul is like matter of which intellect is the form.66 In other words, body con tains soul as flint contains fire; and soul contains intellect as fire contains light. That is why Mulla Sadra maintains that the entelechy of body is soul and the entelechy of soul is intellect. According to him, human soul is created with the mortal body biologically but it is immortal spiritually ("^kjj j op*)l "aJL^ ^\ *iiJ!) 67 The creation of the soul implies its descent in the womb of mother and getting identified with the sperm and this descent is, as it were, a transition of the soul from the state of 'Ahsan Tawqim' to that of Asfal safilin. But in a deeper sense, the soul is, as it were, implanted in the human soil in order to bring about a maximum flowering of the intellect. Though it has a very lowly and poor birth, nonetheless it is pregnant with unlimited possibilities. In fact, the soul is a traveller towards God passing</page><page sequence="16">306 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ through many ontological stages and overcoming many barriers of the state of 'Asfal safilin' 68 While describing its lowly birth and the poor beginning of its journey, Mulla Sadra maintains that there is a time when the soul is at the level of materia prima unable to perform any function except the preservation of its body. It then, gradually acquires the power of growth, assimilation of food, procreation, voluntary movement etc, and, thus becomes the source of all physical powers. Viewed metaphysically, there is a time when it lacks sensation and consciousness, but gradually it acquires sensations and thereby becomes distinct from vegetative soul. It, then, develops inner perception of thinking, memory, imagination and apprehension and thereby becomes distinct from animal soul. While viewed again as a source of knowledge, the soul gradually develops the faculties of discernment, analysis, contemplation and intellection.69 Thus it is clear that human soul is pregnant with polyvalent faculties. At the intial stage, it is hardly distinguishable from the body, but the more it acquires new set of faculties, the more its undifferentiated state is abolished and, in turn, the more its immaterial nature is actualized. The gradual acquisition of a series of faculties by the soul, on the one hand, implies its riddance from the bondage of matter and the neutra lization of the state of Asfal Asafilin' and, on other hand, means its ontolo gical and intellectual perfection. That is why Mulla Sadra maintains that every perception (&lt;-*Vl) whether sensible or intellectual, is a kind of riddance from matter. Because perception implies separation, outsided ness and a sort of detachment from matter and its illusion.70 According to him all kinds of perception belong to the soul, while intellectual percep tion is the highest, and in sensible perception the faculty of touch is the lowest.7l The soul, however, at the human level acquires many faculties and, in turn, realizes riddance from matter a great deal. In spite of all this progress, the soul still seems to be swathed in matter, multiplicity, time, space and motion. Mulla Sadra, therefore, explains that when the pre temporal 'Intellect-man' ( o^'i) fell to the state of Asfali Safilin, he lost his ontological unity and equilibrium and his self, therefore, extended, his sense-faculty became dissipated in five places, and his inner faculties became divided and assumed different names. Hence our mysterious inability to be other than ouerselves, to live two lives, and to be in more the one places at the same time.72 We are unable to prevent old-age</page><page sequence="17">METAPHYSICS OF MULL A SADRA 307 and death. But essentially our soul is intellect-bound soul and this is a sign of its eventual success in realising complete riddance from matter. As mentioned above, the soul is the source and the totality of all human faculties. Using various organs as tools, it is the soul which is in reality instinctive, sensitive, imaginative, and intellective, for its power en compasses the whole body. When an act of sensation is necessary it comes down to this level and by using sensory organs becomes identified with the eyes, ears, hands etc. In like manner, it is the same soul which rises to the level of imagination, apprehension and intellection when need arises. Thus the soul is the real doer of all these activities without losing its oneness and sameness and without getting reduced to any of the faculties.73 The soul is, thus, unity under multiplicity because it is the one and the same soul which is active under the veil of multiple faculties. Likewise Being is unity under the veil of multiplicity of creation. That is why Mulla Sadra maintains that the unity of the soul is the shadow of Divine Unity. Human soul is to God what symbol is to reality or ray is to the sun. The domination of the soul over the senses and organs is a symbol of God's domination over the angelic world. The perfect knowledge of the human soul will serve as a ladder that will lead to the knowledge of God.74 Thus whoever is capable grasping the unity of the soul will also be able to grasp the unity of God. It is a meeting point between matter and spirit, seen and unseen, subtle and heavy and lastly between God and man. It is a gateway towards the Divine kingdom but it can also be a gateway towards all kinds of hell.75 Explaining that soul is the form of body but is immaterial, Mulla Sadra asserts that the sense faculties do not exist in the organs, rather or gans exist on account of them. It is the soul which is in reality endowed with the genuine five senses apart from what is visible and detectable in the body. The senses of body become inactive and listless on account of disease, sleep, unconsciousness and death, while those of the soul always remain alive and active. That is why in dream man can perform all the activities of senses. But the senses of the body are not independent of the soul, rather they are mere shadow and veil for the senses of the soul wich are original and genuine.76 According to him, the imaginative power (".ULiai ?yJl) of the soul is like a substance having separate entity or Being from the body essentially and actually. Because imagination implies outsidedness, freedom and detachment from the grip of matter. However,</page><page sequence="18">308 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ Mulla Sadra maintains that the imaginative faculty is the property of the soul exclusively. It survives the death and disintegration of the body and tastes the bitterness and agony of death. Thus it realizes the death of its own body and remains conscious of its own self even after death as an extended Being of the soul.77 According to Mulla Sadra, human soul is like a spiritual fire, for it has been created by blowing (~**&amp;) As fire is composed of light and heat, likewise the soul is composed of light and heat. (i5?j*? jjy) Light represents intellect and heat and burning represent its dark material aspect. If the soul is able to realize its highest intellective stage of 'Acquired Intellect', it would become immaculate light without any heat, burning and darkness; otherwise it would become pure heat and burning and without any light.78 That is why it has been said that on the day of judgement light would be separated from heat. Thus the soul is like a double edged sword, either it will ascend upward fulminating infinitely or it will fall headlong to the darkness of hell. Every soul undergoes many psychic transitions, and substantial motions, as it makes journey through many ontological stages. From this point of view, according to Mulla Sadra, the soul itself is a way (H**) towards God but at the same time it is also the traveller on the same way. Thus the traveller and the way 3 dUL/) are one and the same thing in case of the soul. Because its actions, theoretical and practical, will be a determining factor in moulding its form and the form is both the way and the traveller simultaneously. Thus good form will lead to God and the bad form to hellJ9 Every soul is responsible for itself and it will go alone to God as it is born alone and dies alone. As Plotinous has said, 'flight of the alone to the alone.' The natural death means independence of the soul from matter or the immortal in man escapes from the mortal limitations. That is why Mulla Sadra asserts that death befalls over temporal qualities and flimsy composition and coagulation and not over essence and perennial substance, because its function is to cause separation and not annihilation.80 At the early stage, however, the soul is dominated by matter and physical multiplicity and its intellectual unity remains mere potency. But through substantial motion and becoming, it goes ahead acquiring polyvalent faculties and actualizing multiple powers. The most important faculty among others, which the soul develops is its intellect which is its form as</page><page sequence="19">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRA 309 well as entelechy. Thus the soul gradually actualizes the four stages of its intellect. Briefly these are as follows: Material Intellect: (J^x* js*), Habitual Intellect, (~a$Ojl js*) Actual Intellect, (J**Jij ja*) and Acquired Intellect (^u^Jl jsc). According to him, ordinary soul reaches only the stage of Habitual Intellect in this world and only the Prophets and sages realize the highest state of 'Acquired Intellect,' or 'the exalted soul' (jj-osji q9^i')?a stage in which the soul becomes intellect and intelligible (Jj?*j J2*), its knowledge and action (J^j^U) become one, distinction between body and soul disappears and all faculties merge into one whole. As mentioned above, intellect is totality of creation as seed is the totality of tree. Thus the Intellect-man (Jfc jUJ!) is the totally integrated man or the perfect man (JJTuUJi) whose origin and end become one, and whose 'who he is'? (j* 6-), 'what he is'? (j* U) and 'why he is'? 0* become one.81 This is the state of 'Ahsan Taqwim' in which knowledge and Being coincide and merge together?a realization of ontological fulfilment which alone is capable of cutting the Gordian knots of existential mys teries and of the illusions of matter, motion, time, space and death. Motion, time and Space As mentioned above, creation as a whole is in a state of 'Asfal Safilln, a fallen state which has given rise to many accidents of which the life of creation is woven. Among all accidents, motion, time and space are very important and one cannot exist without the other. Creation as a whole is entangled in the wheel of motion whose quantitative dimension is time and conditional dimension is space. Motion, according to Mulla Sadra, is the gradual becoming actual of that which is potential JmJI Jl ~cy$\ &amp; *{J~A\ ?j&gt;)82 Thus motion means a movement from potency to act. We find that a seed gradually becomes a tree, a baby becomes an old man and every object in the universe in its own way is in motion?a fact which accounts for the ceaseless and innate struggle and movement of the creation towards God, towards the lost centre and towards the ontological filfilment. Matter is, therefore, in variably seeking form, form is seeking body, body is seeking soul, soul is seeking intellect and intellect is seeking God. To sum up, the creation at large is rooted in motion of varied forms. In the view of Mulla Sadra, time is the quantity of motion. Instant (oT) is the border or minimal unit of time as point is the border of line. As motion implies change and movement, it needs an agent or mover to</page><page sequence="20">310 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ bring it into existence, but since ad infinitum ( J~1~j) is impossible, there cannot be any motion and time before motion and time. As such they are created by the Motionless Mover, who is one encompassing (Jv^) every thing from eternity to eternity transcending motion, time and space.83 Space, according to Mulla Sadra, is the inner surface of a surround ing body in such a manner that nothing remains outside of that surface. This is true only in this world in relation to a particular object. But if the whole space which is found in the universe is taken as one thing, nothing can remain situated outside of it (V* j in order to become space for all. Thus there can be no space for the space of the world as there is no number for all numbers. The whole space, therefore, becomes a single point when it is taken as one thing.84 According to some Muslim philosophers, time is imaginary and fictitious without having any objective reality. While some others say that time is made up of successive chain of 'nows' ( ouT). But Mulla Sadra maintains that time is the quantity of motion and the measure of objects in motion as they are in motion. While motion is mutiple in form, time flows uniformly along the magic thread of before and after?a thread generally known as duration. Thus we experience the successive chain of the diversity of events as they stretch along this thread of duration. But time is real only an instant (oT) while this instant is almost an unseiz able entity. That is why Mulla Sadra asserts that time and motion and those who are determined by them are ontologically weak and the moment of their Being is the same moment of their nothingness. That is every moment a thing 'is' and 'is not'. Thus our Being is blended with nothing ness because every moment we die and are reborn again.85 According to Mulla Sadra, time and motion are the cause for change, newness, decay of Beings as space is the cause for absence and distance among Beings. Time and motion are connected with death and dis solution because death and dissolution mean the end of time and motion. Moreover time and space are responsible for temporal and spatial absence and separation of Beings. But on the day of judgement the illusory veil of time, space and motion will be torn asunder and the creation as a whole would gather together.86 Explaining time and eternity, Mulla Sadra maintains that the relation between two changeable and mortal Beings is called time as a stan dard to measure the quantity of motion and change. There is, therefore,</page><page sequence="21">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRX 311 no time for the persistent reality of substances as they are substance. The relation between immutable and changeable Beings is called 'dahr' (j*^) which has no temporal beginning and end but has two extremes called 'AzaP and 'abad' (-^jJji). And the relation between two im mutable Beings is called eternity (?Ur)87 We are helpless before the finite infinity of time and space. Neither can we stop time, nor can we be present everywhere at one and the same time. We are overwhelmed before the tyranny of time, riddle of space and irresitible pull or push of motion towards death and dissolution. These are the scum of all illusions of mundane life. Eschatology As mentioned above, we are in the fallen state of Asfal safllin in this world and our life is, therefore, rooted in matter and tinged with accidents. Death too is an accident among others, but it is designed to neutralize all accidents and liquidate all contingency. It is, however, ironical that death is the last thing to die, because it is an accident of life which is principle. And ultimately all accidents will perish, while principle alone will survive. Death, however, implies the neutralization of the process of Ibda' and Takwm, abolition of the State of Asfal safilln and cessation of all accidents?time, motion, space etc. It amounts to an existence and rebirth to eternal life after an illusory accidental life. The meaning of death, according to Mulla Sadra, is that it is an inevitable process of nature, a natural endeavour or an instinctive desire of creation to return to its origin.88 Thus the blending of life and death is what constitutes our earthly existence. Death is opposed to life, but life is principial, while death is accidental. In the hereafter all accidents will cease to exist, all opposition will disappear and the distinction between "I" and 'other ' will be outstripped. So death will be the last thing to die. It will be brought in the form of a sheep and the Prophet Yahya (one who is alive) will slaughter it by a knife which is the form of life. In the hereafter, life will be perfect ontologically and it will, therefore, absorb death which is an accident and opposite to life. Thus with the death of death eternity will reign supreme.89 To understand the meaning of life is to understand the meaning of death. Death, according to Mulla Sadra, is a termendous and uni maginable experience of the soul, for it is a unique transition from time to</page><page sequence="22">312 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ eternity and from the illusion of accidents to ontological integrity and reality. That is why Mulla Sadra maintains that after death right and left will disappear, every thing would turn upside down, all secrets will be out, unseen will be seen, knowledge will be crystal clear and everything will be pure ontologically and actual intellectually.90 In the hereafter, all accidents such as time, motion, space, dimension and extension will cease to exist and, therefore, the question: where is heaven or hell? will be metaphysically absurd and false. What the soul will feel, enjoy or suffer from would not be something outside the domain of the soul itself. Everything would be ontologically real, even speech and thought process. Thus the mere desire or speaking of something agreeable by the people of paradise will transform itself into a Being of enjoyment and pleasure: Likewise mere desire of some thing by the people of hell will transform itself into a Being that would be totally disagreeable and capable of causing unimaginable suffering^ Thus in the hereafter everything will be pure ontologically. The worldly objects are not perfect ontolo gically. The worldly fire is not the real fire, because it is composed of natural elements and of light and heat. That is why it disappears into air or water is capable of extinguishing it. But the ontologically perfect fire is inextinguishable and is pure heat and darkness capable of causing in calculable suffering. Only Divine mercy can extinguish it. The Prophetic tradition that the worldly fire has been washed seventy times and sent down to earth means that the corporeal fire is the lowest stage of the intelligible fire. O jU).92 In this world, bodies become prepared to accept their soul accord ing to their ontological fitness. But in the hereafter, souls will be architect of their bodies according to their form and mould. Thus in post-temporal life man would be either angel or animal, that his soul would assume a form which would be conformable to his deeds, good or bad. It is on the basis of that form that the soul would be judged Because a dog is a dog according to its animal form and not to its particular matter. Thus it is form, rather than matter, that would be a decisive factor. It is, therefore, on the basis of different forms that human soul would be diversified into different species, angels, satans, and animals93. Thus God is the Alpha and He alone is the Omega, He is the First from whence everything came out and He is the Last whither everything goes. The outward will be absorbed by the inward because outward implies unveiling and manifesta tion that involves a kind of scandal and shame.</page><page sequence="23">METAPHYSICS OF MULLS SADRA 313 Conclusion The problem of ontology has become obsolete now-a-days and has been set aside as meaningless, irrational and arbitrary. But to Mulla Sadra and to most of the Muslim Philosophers, ontology is the principle as well as the centre of all metaphysical problems. To be ignorant of ontology is to be ignorant of all metaphysical problems. Because everyth ing is understandable, intelligible and explainable only in terms of it. Be ing is its raison detre, while without Being everything is ambiguous and fictitious. According to him, Being is not subjective but objective and the source of all power and action and is, therefore, principial (J-^i). However, this principiality of Being (&gt;yjM ~&lt;UW) as expounded by Mulla Sadra should not be confused with modern existentialism. These two ideas are basically contradictory and incompatiable with each other. Existentialism has appeared in European philosophy at a time when the question of Being as expounded by S. Thomas Acquinas and other Catho lic saints ceased to exist. After Descartes and particularly in 19th and 20th centuries, nobody believed Being to be an objective reality independent of any thinking mind. Moreover, the word 'existence' means individual life or individual Being and does not imply an encompassing objective reality. Existentialism, therefore, should be interpreted as principiality of life (J^jj cJW u ~et*Jl ~aJU) and not principiality of Being (&gt;y?J\ -*JUI)94. Thus the existential philosophy of France believes only in the values of the temporal life of man. Because man is alone and he must accept the fact that his future is threatened by nothingness and total ex tinction. For him there is no transcendent, Omnipotent and Absolute Being to aspire after and feel mostalgia for. He is a poor earthling, an isolated product of biological hazard and a fortuitious mixture of nature devoid of any transcendental orientation. The aim of existential philosophy is, therefore, only to preserve and safeguard temporal human values such as fighting against social injustice and persecution of man. But the doc trine of principiality and unity of Being means that man is never indepen dent of and separated from God, who is the Absolute Being. Through his Being, man is always in touch with God and eternity. He will enjoy an eternal life when he realizes his ontological fulfilment by casting aside his earthly contingency. Whereas according to existential philosophy man is condemned to nothingness and subjected to futility. He has no future outside the short span of earthly life.95</page><page sequence="24">314 MUHAMMAD 'ABDUL-HAQ The history of ontology in Islamic philosophy and European philo sophy is different from each other. A contemporary French orientalist has made a deep research in this field which he has written in the introduc tory chapter of Mulla Sadra's book kitab al-Masha'ir. He has pointed out that in European philosophy 'Being' has been used as an infinitive 'to be' but gradually its meaning has become restricted and finally has been narrowed down to a mere mental concept devoid of any meaning and reality. On the other hand, in Islamic thought being has always been used as an imperative 'be' (uO&gt; that Being is a Divine command and, therefore, is a perennial objective reality.96 Islamic thought, however, tends to take things as they are in reality in order to ascertain their deepest nature and ultimate meaning. It aims at putting everything in its proper perspective. That is why accidents are not allowed to usurp the rank of substance and Beings are not relegated to the position of quiddity and contingency. Thus it tries to create a metaphysical vision and judgement of things in order that man may not take himself for what he is not and things may not appear to be what they are not. It therefore, judges things in their ontological context and metaphysical reality, and, thus, tends to be a discernment between the Absolute and relative, real and un-real. It is saturated with an acute consciousness of the Absolute and of the unreality and ephemeral character of what is other than the Absolute. The moderns are decentralized earthlings. They try to dispense with the Absolute and, thus, exclude Him from every area of life. They, in turn, create false absolutes which they live by. As decentralized earth lings, their mind is embedded with false images and shifting concepts, while they are oblivious of their origin and ultimate becoming. They are interested in and preoccupied with this world and their passion clings to what is wroldly only. They, therefore, recoil from the idea of the super natural Absolute Being and from the posthumous becoming and suffering. But Islamic thought sets forth a consistent and meaningful idea about creation, mystery of life and death, the miracle of existence and the illusion of time and space. Its mission is to make man conscious of his origin and end, of the Absolute and of his lost centre and thereby provide him with something to live for and something to die for.</page><page sequence="25">METAPHYSICS OF MULLA SADRA 315 Notes : 1.
