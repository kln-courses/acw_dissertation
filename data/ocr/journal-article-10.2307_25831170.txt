<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews An Anthology of Qur'anic Commentaries - Volume I: On the Nature of the Divine. Edited by Feras Hamza and Sajjad Rizvi with Farhana Mayer. Oxford: Oxford University Press and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2008. Pp. 688 + 1 map. ?65.00. This extraordinary volume is the first in a series aimed at presenting a collection of Muslim exegetical narratives on selected ay as of the Qur'an. The title of the present volume, On the Nature of the Divine, reflected the editors' belief that there was 'no other theme that is more pivotal than that of "God"' (p. 8). Discussions of the nature of the Divine, divine attributes and the relationship between the human and the Divine not only have been central to Islamic theology and philosophy from the earliest days of the faith but also have implications for the fields of 'history and, by extension, comparative religion, moral ethics and ecumenical dialogue' (p. 9). The ayas chosen for this volume were selected on the basis of the attention paid them by commentators and their 'prominence within the Muslim popular consciousness' (p. 9). These six comprise Q. 2:115, on 'God's omnipresence'; Q. 2:255, on 'God's seat/throne'; Q. 6:12, on 'Divine mercy'; Q. 24:35, on 'God's light'; Q. 54:49, on 'God's measure'; and, lastly, Q. 112, on the '"oneness" of God'. These ayas and the commentaries thereon form the volume's six chapters. As important, however, are the editors' selections of commentaries. Not content with selecting what might be termed the few 'standard' commentaries, the editors instead have chosen to cite the contributions of 20 commentators from a variety of backgrounds: the authors featured herein include those writing from the Sunni, ShicI, cIbadI, Ashcari, Muctazili, Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic philosophical and Sufi traditions. The ShicI commentaries are further subdivided into Twelver, IsmacIlI and Zaydl traditions. A separate section (pp. 21-65) includes information on all the commentators while a further 'prosopographical appendix' (pp. 577-601) includes information on each of these figures as well as other prominent individuals mentioned herein. An extensive bibliography, a subject index, and an index of Qur'anic citations round off this superb contribution. The Twelver commentators cited comprise CAH al-Qummi, Furat al-Kufi and al-cAyyashi, all from the late third/ninth century, as well as al-Tabrisi (or al-Tabarsi), Journal of Qur'anic Studies 12 (2010): 188-217 Edinburgh University Press ?

There are two IsmacTH commentators, Abu Hatim al-Razi (d. 322/934-5) and Jacfar al-Yaman (d. before 346/957), and one Zaydi scholar, the compilerc Allama al-Sharafi (d. 1062/1651). From the Sufi tradition there is Maybudi (fl. sixth/twelfth century), cAbd al-Razzaq al-Kashanl (d. 736/1336) and Ismacil Burusawi (or Bursawi) (d. 1137/1725). The SunnI commentators include al-Balkhi (d. 150/767), Hud al-Hawwari (fl. fourth/ tenth century), al-Tabarf (d. 310/923), the Muctazili al-Zamakhshahri (d. 538/1144), the Ashcaris Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 606/1209) and al-AlusI (d. 1270/1854), the Andalusian grammarian Abu Hayyan al-Gharnatl (d. 745/1344), Muhammad cAbduh (1849-1905) and Rasfrid Rida (1865-1935), and al-Mawdudl (1903-79). Each chapter commences with an introductory statement on the importance of, and key themes associated with, the aya itself. There follows a short summary of the commentary and then the (translated) commentary itself. Each of the translated selections is exceptionally well-annotated and features comparisons with the contributions of the others in that tradition. Chapter two's 171 pages on Q. 2:255, on 'God's seat/throne', the famous dyat al-kursl (called 'the throne verse' by many), one of the Qur'an's best-known ay as, is a testament to the method employed in the volume, and its success. The chapter commences with a discussion on three issues of translation and 'appellation'. The editors discuss the appropriateness of referring to this aya as 'the throne verse': the English blurs the distinction between kursl and carsh, the latter also often being translated as 'throne' even as the former is sometimes also rendered as 'seat'. Secondly, they address the translation of the divine name al-qayyum as it appears in the aya, as 'Eternal Sustained. Lastly, they discuss the phrase md bayna aydihim wa-md khalfahum (what is before them and what is after them) which they suggest has been sometimes discussed with 'contradictory understandings' (p. 130) by the commentators. The chapter then addresses five 'thematic concerns of the commentaries' selected. These are, first, the differences between the uses, and implications of the uses, of kursl and carsh as these terms appear in the Qur'an. The former as it is used in Q. 2:255, the only instance of its use, whereas carsh appears 26 times, 21 times with reference to God, four to the Queen of Sheba and once to the prophet Joseph. The issue of the use of divine names and attributes that appear in the aya is then addressed. These include such terms as al-hayy ('the Living') and al-qayyum. These two, as they appear at the beginning of the aya, suggest 'God's intimate and vital relationship with His creation' while the appearance of the terms al-caliyy ('the High') and al-cazlm ('the Tremendous') at the end suggest 'divine exalted transcendence' (p. 132). The third theme arising from the commentaries is that of the universe and creation, as God is</page><page sequence="3">190 Journal of Qur'anic Studies seen as Master of 'the heavens and the earth'. Fourth, is the theme of shafaca ('intercession') and angels. The aya is seen to qualify intercession while also 'leaving the possibility open' (p. 133). The last theme is that of the aya's devotional use in 'everyday practice' and the benefits thereof as highlighted by the commentators. The sections from the 20 selected commentaries are then cited. Each of these is prefaced by its own commentary on the style and substance of the passage, including reference to how these relate to the author's particular interests and predispositions more generally. To assist in the making of these connections the 20 selections are heavily, and helpfully, annotated. The preface to the commentary of the Ismacili Jacfar notes the manner in which his Ismacilism is on offer, pointing, for example, to the presence of and explaining particularly Ismacili terminology or meanings. The commentary of the Sufi al-Kashani is seen to reflect key 'doctrines and arguments' (p. 200) identified with the school of Ibn cArabi, including wahdat al-wujud ('the uniqueness of existence'). The Andalusian grammarian Abu Hayyan is seen to take the Muctazill al-Zamakhshari to task. Al-Mawdudi's commentary is shown to reflect his emphasis on 'the absolute sovereignty of the divine', which is directly relevant to his demand for an Islamic state 'ruled by the divine law and in accord for the divine plan for order in human society' (p. 281). The still-living Twelver Shici commentator Fadl Allah is seen to refer to the works of the earlier Twelver commentators cited herein and to be concerned to stress the immediacy and immanence of experience, and thus to have abandoned 'the scholastic language of philology and high theology' in favour of 'anthropomorphic language' to be able to communicate with 'the limited imaginations and intellects of human beings' (p. 283). It should be clear that this volume is a stunning achievement, whose breadth and depth successfully demonstrate the extraordinary diversity of the faith from its very earliest, formative years through to the present. As such, the editors, and Oxford University Press and the Ismaili Institute are to be congratulated and thanked for the service this contribution renders both the specialist and layperson alike. In his foreword (p. xi) Omar Ali-de-Unzaga of the Institute notes this is the first of a multi-volume series which aims to chart how 'historical, intellectual and social circumstances affect interpretation?' The effort involved in producing the present volume was clearly monumental. The reward for us is monumental as well. One does hope all those involved in the present undertaking maintain the stamina to bring the additional volumes to publication. Andrew J. Newman DOI: 10.3366/E1465359110001014</page></plain_text>
