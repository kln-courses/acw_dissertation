<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY (Continued) By George B. Wilbur, M. D. (South Dennis) III. In this essay we have undertaken to investigate whether Freud's Life-Death instinct theory (theorem would be a more logically ap propriate name) was not already implicit in the initial hypothesis elaborated as the result of his investigation of dreams. We have already seen that this was Freud's own feeling about the matter and as we know1 he attributed the failure to recognize this implicit theorem to having overlooked the existence of the impulse to non-erotic aggression and destruction. We do not know whether this oversight was due to a failure to think through the logical consequences of his initial theory, which had a more hypothetico deductive character than he had been willing to recognize, or whether he had been blinded to objective realities by some process of denial on the order of a repression. It is well known2 that a tacit pre supposition acquired by some process that can hardly be called repression can produce such tendencies to overlook something. We cannot investigate either of these questions in the rigorous manner required. The purely logical question must wait on a more strictly logical formulation of the theory. The question of Freud's own repressions we are neither inclined, nor have we the means, to attempt to investigate. There is, however, a third avenue of approach which we shall attempt. It will give us an op 1. Civilization and Its Discontents. New York, 1930, p. 99. 2. The disconcerting results of a tacit assumption can easily be illustrated. Most people confronted with the task of constructing 4 equilateral triangles with 6 matches will fail. They assume they are to treat the matches as if they were lines on a surface. They act as if the taskmaster had restricted the problem to be carried out in two-dimensional space like a diagram on a piece of paper. The problem is impossible under such a restriction. If the restricting assumption is removed by calling it to attention, the solution becomes obvious.</page><page sequence="2">210 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. portunity, we believe, to glance in a superficial way at both the logical and psychoanalytic aspects of the matter. And this avenue of approach is provided for us by a consideration of the psycho biological aspects of the general problem of inventing a tool, in particular of the invention or discovery of the Freudian 'fiction' as worked out in the final section of the Interpretation of Dreams3. This avenue of approach is given us by the line of thought we developed in the second chapter of this paper. It will be recalled that we there developed certain behavioristic aspects of a modern biological concept of the tendency to maintain a steady state. We shall henceforth call it an SS principle. In the preceding section we reduced a mathematical formulation of this principle by Burton to a simpler one4 for the sake of its pictorial suggestiveness: S—*►«))—»-Z where S and Z represent the inexhaustible source and sink (external world, in the beginning, the sea), (0) the organism, and the arrows the flow of substances, energies, etc., through the system. We pictured the evolutionary process as due to the invagination - incorporation - of bits of the external world which led to dif ferentiation into morphological complexity, supporting a develop ment and differentiation of behavior systems and an increase of independence with respect to the original milieu. We pictured it thus: S —*• (0) —&gt; Z develops into S —*■ (s —*■ (0) —&gt; z) —&gt; z Such invaginated bits (s and z) of the original milieu as the blood stream, gastro-intestinal tract, central nervous system, permit of the development of steady state systems within the larger whole which are dependent on the maintenance of the whole for their own existence. But the organism as a whole is as we know dependent on the maintenance of the inner steady state for its continued existence. Where the primitive or primal organism has thus a passive relation to the external world and its death is due to accidental changes in the S and Z leading to changes 3. Unless otherwise specified, references will be to the New York ed., 1933, which will be abbreviated to "TD." 4. Where in our previous symbolic pictures we used S' Z' to represent the external world, we now use S, Z.</page><page sequence="3">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 211 in the parameters which can no longer be compensated for, in the more highly developed organisms this passive relationship is shifted into the interior of the organism, which now assumes a not un limited active relation to the maintenance of the s and z. Ultimately of course all organisms preserve their passive relation to the S and Z represented by the cosmos, and some forms of death always remain accidental. This was the original dualism with which Freud started, organism vs. outerworld. That is not the question. Our question concerns this invaginated portion of the outer world and the organism's relation to it. Does the organism also, perhaps inadvertently, incorporate the accidental death aspect along with the other things? (I am not here speaking of poisons, dangerous antago nists, and other such real dangers. That happens, of course, but it is not what we have in mind when we speak of a death instinct). If death is due to changes in the S and Z now becomes s and z (i.e., internalized or accidental) does it with this change become a necessary consequence of the individual's activity? If so, we have something we would be justified in calling a Death Instinct. It would be the dualistic counterpart of the Life-Instinct, in opposition to it but not its contradiction. In our previous section we found a suggestion in a form of behavior which tradition says leads to death, - narcissism. In this section we wish to explore that suggestion in more detail, not under the label of narcissism but as the tendency to gain autonomy and self-dependence for the individual. Not all forms of it are called narcissism. The hypothesis we shall explore in this section then is this: that one mode of expression of the SS principle, its tendency to gain autonomy and self-dependence for the organism, can if it proceeds to an extremity, to the ultimate limit of cutting the organism away completely from its source and sink, result in death; in consequence it merits the name 'death instinct'. Perhaps, since we are now going to deal with the psychological level and no longer with the purely behavioristic biological, we should say rather that the organism uses the stability principle to attempt to gain autonomy and self-dependence. To impute such a motive to the stability principle itself is apparently to indulge in anthropomorphism. Or, put another way, it is to displace an ego function away from the ego, leaving that in a passive role. And one reason, perhaps the most significant, for attempting to solve</page><page sequence="4">212 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. the problem in such a fashion is that we do not yet know how to deal with such ego functions. While we do not believe that it is possible as yet to solve such problems, we do believe that a consideration of the way in which Freud's theory was developed, and certain relationships that can be brought out between what the theory is about and the structure of the theory itself, offers some interesting possibilities. The particular manifestation of this tendency to autonomy which we shall consider will be for the most part the matter of inventing a tool, e. g., a hypothetico-deductive system. Psycho analysis has, like other observational sciences, professed to make its discoveries by induction, not by formal deduction. Just what induction means exactly is I think still a moot problem among the students of scientific methodology. There is a view current, however, which we shall assume as our starting point for the reason that we think it can be shown that the history of the development of psychoanalysis is the best possible confirmation of it. The view in question is that inductive thinking does not proceed by very informal spontaneous operations, as has been commonly supposed, but by tacit rules which can be discovered and formulated into a deductive system. This view would seem to reduce even inductive thinking to unwitting deductive procedures.5 Induction like any form of human behavior is determined. It is such a view that justifies calling Freud's 'fiction' a hypothetico-deductive system. There are many problems in this field which strictly speaking need not concern us, but we shall choose to develop our topic in such a way as to notice some of these side issues. A hypothetico-deductive system is a tool constructed for the purpose of ordering data and asking further questions about them. The Freudian 'fiction' and the theory it flowered into represent an attempt at a complete picture on paper of the structure of the human mind. It can be considered a sort of map. Maps have curious properties. If they are fairly complete and give a detailed representation of the country they map, and if the map is itself a detail in that country, if the map is a map of the country in which it occurs, there will be on the map a representation of 5.

From the standpoint of the mathematician or logician such a structure presents many puzzling features that are difficult to deal with theoretically.6 Some of the difficulties that arise in psychoanalytic theory arise in this same feature. The theory must represent itself and its place in the theory. We are in no position to solve the logical difficulties that arise in an effort to think about such things, and shall not try to do so. When we consider that the inception of the idea of the death-instinct followed on the discovery of narcissism we are justified in suspecting that there is some relationship between the logical problem of self-representa tion and the psychological problem of taking the self (or an element of the self) as object. They are different aspects, perhaps, of the same problem. We can approach our problem also from another point of view with respect to maps. This particular map is one of the structure of the human psyche. If then there is in this structure or in its relation to the milieu something that can be called a 'death instinct', it should find representation of some sort in the map. Where and how? Not in the pleasure-principle itself. That much was clear to Freud from the very beginning, and was twice discussed by him.7 He points out that it would have been a self contradiction that would have prevented the coming into being of the organism from the very start. We shall come back to these questions after we have considered more fully the history 6. Philosophers, as for example Josiah Royce, have seized upon this property to construct cosmologies in terms of self-generation. Those analysts, e.g., Horney.who are disappointed in not finding any dialectic developmental principle in Freud's theory, would do well to consider the possibilities that arise in this circumstance. Cf. Jekels: Psychoanalysis and Dialectic: Psy. Rev. 28, April, 1941, for an excellent discussion of Horney's views. The 'sociological school' of analytic thought is fond of mentioning and talking about the wonders that cani be performed by a dialectic mode of thought, but it does not seem to have realized that Freud has provided the only useful tool of this sort that pictures an actual dialectic process. 7.

The map maker or the person who hired him has as often as not the definite intention of changing the state of affairs. The first step in this 'process of destruction' is the acquirement of a fairly detailed knowledge of the state of things as they are at the beginning. A recent discovery in the field of physics, which was quite as psychologically shattering in its effects as the discovery of the 'death instinct' by Freud, was Heisenberg's principle of indeterminancy. According to this the very effort to learn about things as they momentarily are changes them in incalculable ways.</page><page sequence="6">214 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. and structure of the Freudian theory. Of particular interest to us is the history of the process of construction of this theory. In spite of the many attempts that have been made to describe the process of theory construction as a characteristic feature of human behavior, there is still something to be said about it, and the theory of psychoanalysis seems to give us a peculiarly significant instance of features which have not yet been sufficiently investigated. An exposition of this does not seem to require a very elaborate and detailed account. On the contrary, a marshalling of material that is or should be so familiar to psychoanalysts as to be trite will serve our purpose.8 Perhaps the approach from a novel point of view will make it interesting. It is an old idea that a tool is an extension of and an embodiment of some human organ or structure. The particular version of this idea that we shall use was formulated by Karl Arlsberg.9 'The prin ciple of development of animals is the principle of adaptation of the soma (progressive differentiation of the body, Körperfortbildung) ... the developmental principle of mankind is the principle of the elimination of the body by means of artificial tools (Körperaussch 8. As regards purely psychoanalytic issues we believe also that nothing we shall say has not already been said many times by various analysts, even though it may not have been phrased and brought together in exactly the same way that we shall choose to follow. In partial substantiation of this we shall cite some, but not all, of these previous occasions and do not wish to be misunderstood in so doing as touching on any claims to priority or originality of conception. The history of the development of psychoanalysis is probably not unique among the sciences in being developed primarily by one man who then gathered a group around him which continued to function very much as one man in the further development of the field. In this group ideas were discussed together from all angles and held very much in common. It occurred to no one to try and be original and raise claims to priority. Or if such individualistic impulses forced themselves into the picture they were quickly disposed of as unwarranted intrusions. Of course this ideal state of affairs did not last long, but during the time it did last it is not possible to find in the literature any clear evidence for the first inception of an idea. It was often the case that an idea first appeared to Freud; he then suggested to some one of the group who chanced to have the opportunity presented by a case that this be traced out through such and such material. The following of such a course often produced unexpected and unforeseen results which then stimulated others, including Freud, to further work. These new results showed on several occasions the need for a clarification of initial interpretations and for a re definition of terms, a task which was frequently undertaken by Freud, as would be expected. Many of his later papers clearly reveal this origin. The two instances we shall be chiefly concerned with are his 'Introduction of Narcissim' (1914) and 'Beyond the Pleasure-Principle' (1918). The one was a reaction to Jung's attack on the libido theory as then formulated, the other to the discovery of an apparent exception to the pleasure-principle as then interpreted. 9.

A familiar illustration is given by the monkey wrench which is an extension of and a substitute for the human hand. By excluding the weakness and sensitivity to pain of the human fingers it permits of doing work impossible to the hand. "We wish to extend this idea to the psychological field, and in particular to the nature and function of a theory. There is nothing new in this. It has been discussed many times from various angles.10 A tool is an abstraction, a scientific theory is an abstraction. Either may be the creation of one man or of a group of men, but in either case the thing works by extracting from a complex that which is common and collective, certain relationships, and by excluding that which is purely and uniquely private and individual, we might say intimate and unrelated. We tend to regard the abstract and general as antithetical to the concrete and subjective. The latter is palpable, something we can 'feel' in more senses than one. It takes but little consideration to show that abstractions of the sort we are discussing relate somehow to the field of distance perception, the concrete subjective to the field of proprio-, intero-, and haptic sensations. I am lumping together here a lot of different categories in a way that will make some people writhe. But we are not now seeking very fine distinctions. The process of abstracting is in some respects comparable to the effects or repression. We see in patients a tendency to speak in abstract generalities when they have something that must be supressed.Presumably there are also 10. Freud TD. p. 522, 'Thinking is indeed nothing bnt a substitute for the hallucinatory wish.' Psychopathology of Everyday Life, New York, 1916, p. 309, '. . . a large portion of the mythological conception of the world***** is nothing but psychology projected into the outer world." One has only to turn to the vast Egyptian pantheon to find innumerable instances of the personification and deification of purely abstract psychological entities.

Brown: A Methodological Consideration of the Problem of Psychometrics; Erkenntnis iv, p. 46, 1934, develops the idea that the instru ment by which we measure is a law in action. A measuring process repeats the process by which a law was discovered. The law is discovered as the result of a theory. "Theory is then the starting point rather than the end point in a scientific process. If this viewpoint is true our ideas that any science is solely inductive must be abandoned. Science is the result of the contribution of the productive thinker perhaps even more than the experiments of the diligent researcher." p. 56.</page><page sequence="8">216 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. differences between the two processes, perhaps in motivation, perhaps in other respects. The distinctions are probably important for some purposes, but I believe we can ignore them. It is, no doubt, going to strike some critics of this paper that it is being written under the influence of repression rather than of abstraction, for the very good reason that apparently little or nothing is being said about the sexual aspect of things. This is one of the questions we shall not even attempt to solve even though we have to consider at some length and from various angles an important instance of it. It has been said that psychoanalytic theory is only the psychol ogy of the analyst projected on to the patient. Such a remark is ambiguous and has a disparaging quality given it by the qualifying 'only', and to be taken in by this value is to overlook the general truth of the statement. We can transform the statement, since projection is a process of substitution of values, and say:- the analyst interprets his general psychological formula which also applies to him in terms of the patient's particular values.11 The general formula he obtained by some process of recognition of his own unconscious tendencies. The important question then becomes which aspect of his formula he interprets by specific values chosen from the patient's materials, that which is general or that which is strictly individual. Freud has said that if the physician is going to use his own unconscious in this way as an instrument he can do so only if he has been analytically 'purified'.12 He must be able to distinguish his own unique personable problems from the collective and general. The analyst, like any scientist, has to lose what is individual and subjective in the general which is also abstract and verbal. He must resign himself to a certain degree of anonymity, and even to loss of priority. Now it is clear that this can be the occasion for a wound to his narcissism. But the scientist has ever been faced with the task of effacing his private individuality for the collective interest. The invention of a tool, even if it is a process of projecting some aspect of the self, has the function of carrying out an abstracting which is like a repres sing. The narcissism can be displaced from creator to creation. 11. Recommendations on Treatment. 1912. p. 328, vol. II, Coll. Works. 12. Sachs: Gemeinsame Tagetraume, Author's abstract, Int. Zeit.

They have been expressed an innumerable number of times in countless ways, probably even for psychoanalysis, which does not like vague generalities when it can get concrete clinical instances. Fortunately in this field we have some clinical evidence which was generalized for the case of the poet but could just as well have been extended to the scientific thinker. Sachs12 developed the idea, on the basis of the findings in two cases, that one of the functions of the poet was to make acceptable as a social collective property in which everybody could share that which was ordinarily regarded as the private guilty secret of the mind of an individual. The poem as embodiment of a day-dream has the function of eliminating or decreasing the guilt feeling, which is isolating and is the result of an isolation, and thus has the effect of making possible some sort of social life. But the narcissism which is sacrificed in creating the collective property is displaced and taken up by the esthetic qualities of the created object. A scientific theory, e. g. physics, does the same sort of thing.13 It began as a projection of human psychology and became or becomes in the course of time as nearly completely de-anthropomorphized as it is possible to make it. But it still retains traces of its origin in the retention of words like 'cause', 'force'.14 The purpose or aim of an effort at reasoning - let us say, the ideal of pure reason - is by age-old tradition the attainment of some thing completely anti-thetical to sensation, something completely impalpable and imperceptible, a something that occurs even without the intervention of images. Possibly it is a generalization and hypos 13. Cf. The paths of Natural Science in the Light of Psychoanalysis. Sandor Rado, Psa. Quart, i, 683, 1932. Cf. also Markus Reiner's comments in the same number. 14. Hans Kelsen: Die Entstehung des Kauseigesetzes aus dem Vergeltung sprinzip. Jour. Unified Science, viii, p. 69, 1939. Kelsen gives a long and detailed account of the semantic changes undergone by words expressing our concept of 'cause' and 'etiology,' from their initial recorded meanings of 'guilt,' 'retaliation.' etc. Previous efforts in the same direction (as for example Cornford's: From Religion to Philosophy, London, 1912) used as the basis for their inter pretation the concept of sympathetic magic and of the projection of mana, i.e., omnipotence. While guilt and mçral conceptions entered into the picture and were clearly related to anti-social factors, the interpretations were too far in ad vance of analytic developments to be completely satisfactory. Cornford was able to trace the reflection of the social milieu in the philosophical and scientific thinking of the Greeks. His work falls short since he lacked the necessary means of tracing the process of transformation through the psychology of the individual thinkers.

Whatever it may be, when we wish to give an objective representation of it we do so in terms of visual abstractions which are as nearly devoid of sensible meaning as we can make them. When in psychoanalysis we encounter any such persistent striving as this which cannot be the result of a conscious wish (even when the process is conscious) to recapture once observed external realities, we are accustomed to regard it sometimes as the creation of an unconscious wish.15 Why not always? Well, as we know, there are biological tendencies which are prior to wishes and have not yet become wishes either consciously or unconsciously. Consider for example the consonantal shift in the Indo-Germanic languages. We here touch on a field that psycho analysis has not yet gotten around to investigating. We might hazard the guess that these tendencies prior to wishes are prior to object relations, but that is not necessary nor is it true if we think of 'object relations' as a physico-chemical relation and not a psycho logical one. The purely physico-chemical manifestations of the SS principle are object relations but are not necessarily psychological ones. We spoke of the Freudian theory as a map and considered certain logical features of maps. It is essential to notice a feature that pertains to this particular map. It is a map of the structure of the psyche. One of the discoveries that resulted from its use was that the psyche itself is so constructed that it in turn can be called a map. Above we pointed out that there was a tendency to in corporate a bit of the external world into the structure of the liv ing organism. By this process a certain but ultimately limited amount of independence and self-sufficiency is achieved. We regarded this as an extension of the steady state tendency. Several expres sions of this tendency to autonomy are well known to us in psycho analysis. We see it in the creation of the super-ego. The discovery of this structure is one of the most important that has been made by psychoanalysis. This structure or institution is the representative 15. One is here speaking of a hypothetical first occasion for the race, not the individual. After some pioneer has objectified his unconscious wish and created the objcct in the external world to satisfy it, the next comer is able to say he got the notion by the observation of 'reality.' The thinker who tries to explain the existence of the primal wish no longer need go back to the beginning of things and try to account for the creation of the wish out of some innate raw material. He can now always claim that the wish was created by the intro jection of 'reality.'</page><page sequence="11">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 219 in the psyche of an important feature in the social milieu of the child. We can convert this statement in terms of our present topic thus: there is a mapping of the social milieu in the structure of the human psyche. How many instances of such mapping there may be, I do not know;16 one that has been extensively in vestigated is the super-ego. According to this the structure of the psyche maps some features in the milieu. But we have already said that the Freudian theory is a map of the structure of the psyche. If this be so, then we should expect to find a something that we can trace from the milieu17 of the child through the child and back into the theoretical picture of the child's mind. We have now to consider the details of the process of constructing our particular map. We are fortunate in now having at our service what may be the very first formulation of the basic theory of psychoanalysis.18 It is a very concise formulation of the propositions which were published and extensively discussed by Breuer three years later in the 'Studien.' This first formulation shows very clearly the logical structure of the subsequent theory. Five propositions are given with respect to the nature of the hysterical attack. The first four have to do with the nature of the repressed memory, the return of which constitutes the content of the hysterical attack. They are the formulation of clinical observations made by Breuer and his patient, in the first instance, and subsequently confirmed and deepened by Freud's later ex 16. Further consideration shows us, of course, that one of the first instances of this fact discovered by Freud was in the bisexual nature of the hysterical phantasies, whereby one individual tried to represent the roles of the Self and of the Other. 17. There need not be, as there was once for Adler, any mystery about how it got into the milieu of the child. The answer is simple: its parents put it there. It is thus a reflection in a sense of their minds. And so on back to the very beginnings. 18. J. Breuer and S. Freud: Zur Theorie des hysterischen Anfalles. Int. Zeit. Psa. u. Imago xxv, 1940. It is a paper in Freud's handwriting, dated 'late Nov. 1892,' and found among his papers after his death. Presumably it summarizes the result of a discussion between the two. In his subsequent discus sion of the theory 3 years later in the 'Studien,' Breuer attaches Freud's name to the 'principle of the tendency to maintain a constant cerebral excitement.' We may judge from the context and from Freud's subsequent remarks in his 'History'' that Freud supplied only the name, not the idea, which according to Breuer goes back at least to Cabanis.</page><page sequence="12">220 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. periences with other patients. I shall summarize them briefly, as we are not much concerned with them. 1. The content of the hysterical attack consists of the return of a memory. 2 It is not a ^random memory, but one associated with the traumatic experience that induced the attack. 3. It is an unconscious memory, belonging to the second more or less highly organized state of consciousness that occurs in the hysteric, at the moment of attack, and is otherwise absent or nearly so. 4. The question of the origin of. this memory falls together with that of the conditions favoring its return in the second state of con sciousness. Two conditions have been recognized: (1) intentional rejection of the memory from the normal state of consciousness, and (2) the second state itself favors the return of impressions re ceived during similar states. The distinctive contribution later made by Freud to this part of the theory was the clarification and enunciation of the concept of 'repression' dimly foreshadowed in the last two propositions. This concept became one of the foundation stones of the psycho analytic doctrine.19 The fifth proposition, enunciating the prin ciple of the steady state, I will translate in full; the italics are in the original: "If one starts with the proposition, which moreover has a more general bearing, that the nervous system strives in its functioning to maintain something which may be called 'sum of excitement' at a constant level, and that this is the condition of well-being which it maintains by association of every sensible impression or by discharge through appropriate motor activity, then one can arrive at a common characteristic of those psychic experiences which are found to be the content of hysterical attacks. They are always impressions which have been denied adequate discharge, either because the patient rejects them out of fear of painful psychic conflict, because they are forbidden (as for example with sexual impressions) by shame and social considerations, or because these impressions were received during a state in which the nervous 19.

One gains in this way a definition of psychic trauma useful for the theory of hysteria. A psychic trauma is formed by impression, associative elaboration or motor reaction of which creates difficulties for the nervous system." This much they clearly stated. Those familiar with psycho analytic history will find the germ of many subsequent discoveries in these remarks. There is already presupposed in this hpyothesis a radical departure from the psychological thinking of the times.20 It is implied by the words 'the nervous system strives', and again 'which it maintains by'. It was this feature that gave to the Freudian psychology the name of being a 'dynamic' psychology. Freud's view was that the organism was in its psychological behavior trying to do something. The contemporary psychological view was that the organism passively experiences something which is done to it by the external world. The sharp distinction between the two views was slow to become clearly preceptible. Prior to the discovery of the fact that the activity of the ego could also be looked upon as a libidinous process and could thus be brought within the scope of his theory, Freud's psychological theory also has seemed to many to present the organism as being largely passive. Neurotic symptoms are consciously felt to be passively experienced, not actively sought out. But where Freud for the most part placed the active seeking out in the Une. wishes, academic psychology placed it on the outer world as an attribute of the 'stimulus' or attributed it to some organic disturbance of the nervous system. All this is clearly visible today, but if one tries to find the dis tinctions being made in the literature of the times he will not find 20. To see the point, one has only to compare two books that appeared in the same year. H. L. Hollingsworth's 'Psychology of the Functional Neuroses', (New York, 1920) was, like Freud's Jenseits, the result of clinical experience of the war neuroses. Hollingsworth resurrects for his explanation of the phenom ena encountered W. Hamilton's concept of 'redintegration', i.e., tendency to total recall in response to a fragment of a complex totality. This is essentially the same idea that Freud brings up in his repetition compulsion. But redintegration is a purely passive process experienced by the neurotic. The repetition com pulsion is an active process in the individual. To be sure, it is passively ex perienced by the ego, being an unconscious tendency, but it is an active tendency in the organism. Redintegration is like the usual superficial view of the 'condi tioned reflex,' not something wished or willed by the individual, but somehow a function of the stimulus which is the active party.</page><page sequence="14">222 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. them explicitly stated. The academic psychologists of the time un doubtedly believed that they believed in will and activity on the part of the psyche. But it is hard today to find traces of evidence to justify such assertion of belief on their part. For the most part these important distinctions and the only ones that were important were concealed behind squabbles over whether or not the infant had sexual experience, and other such questions. In the end we are going to see that these important distinctions were obscured behind an ambiguity as to what constituted the outer world. There is no point in rehashing all these old polemics except to bring out that the exponents of both points of view had one thing in common, - it was familiar to them that there was a tendency to total recapture or reconstitution of certain past experiences. James gives a couple of paragraphs to the discussion of it, for instance.21 His comparison of the tendency of some old women to insufferable garrulity clearly reveals the customary attitude. He does not stop to ask himself, 'what are these women trying to accomplish by this behavior', 'what particular situation are they trying to recall, and why? But even for the Freudians it has taken a long time to become aware of all the bearings of this total recapture; of what this 'totality' consisted and when it had occurred, of how and in what way it is recalled, in part in memories, in part in at tempts to act out; of the fact that the totality comprised elements in the external world and in the individual at the time. It is an approximation perhaps not too far off the mark to say that the subsequent history of the theory of psychoanalysis has consisted in the discovery of just these details. The first Breuer-Freudian interpretation of the tendency and of its meaning was the theory of the need to abreact an unworked out experience. For this two alternative ways were open (or at least should be), 'associative elaboration' or 'motor discharge'. This hypothesis formed the basic justification for the period of'catharsis' and the mode of treatment by 'abreaction'. This therapeutic system was found to be inadequate, since as conceived in those early days it did not take into account the real meaning of the 'transference situation' as an important part of the effort at re 21. p. 569-7 Psychology vol. I. New York. 1890.</page><page sequence="15">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 223 capturing the requisite former totality. 'Abreaction' was not a matter of mere discharge of pent-up past emotions, but of the re-establishment of a particular situation with an object so that it could now be lived out. In short, Breuer and Freud were already dealing with the unrecognized 'repetition compulsion'. At that time they thought it was merely a desire to repeat actions just for the fun of the activity itself. Reference to Breurer's discussion in the 'Studien' of the con cept of the tendency to maintain a constancy of cerebral excitation clearly shows up this point. But it also shows that he was un mistakably thinking in physiological terms corresponding to those discussed in our second section. The principle which they called the stability principle, we are justified then in naming the steady state principle. Breuer's notion was explicitly derived (in part) from Exner's idea of a residual tonic excitement (tension) in the resting nervous system. Breuer states that under conditions of inactivity this tension mounts until it becomes painful and leads to the need to indulge in activity of some kind, however aimless it may be otherwise. Thus there is a kind of intrinsic nervous excitement that must be discharged in activity. The ques tion of whether this need to activity might not have arisen from a need to make good a metabolic loss that occurred just from the process of maintaining the tonic excitement, he does not seem to have asked himself. In any case it could not then have been answered by recourse to experiment. What is clear is that this need to discharge was felt to be on the same order of magnitude as the need to drink water, for instance. But it was not the broader view that came to be taken of the Pleasure-principle as a general principle applying to all needs. There was here a confusion of two levels, which I believe can still be observed in the thinking of some of our contemporaries. That is, there was considered to be a specific urge for pleasure to be gained by mere activity whenever the intrinsic tension mounted, a something on the order of the child's desire 'just to have fun.' But the P-P in Freud's hands was not a specific urge, it was a general law to which all urges must conform. We can perhaps</page><page sequence="16">224 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. see the continuation of the Breurian view in the notion of 'auto erotism.'22 All this does not exhaust our interest in Breuers discussion. He goes on to point out that besides this intrinsic nervous tension there is another type due to the great chemical needs of the body. This is not merely stimulating like the first type, but agitating. It forms the basis for the affects. The first type forms the basis for states of euphoria and general uneasiness: The second type of tension finds its avenue of discharge through preformed pathways; it does not demand 'discharge' but 'satisfaction,' as Freud later pointed out, meaning by this a change of state in the source that would nullify the condition that had induced the tension. Sexual tension and affect form a transition stage between the endogenous and the other type of affective tension derived from the great chemical needs, according to Breuer. Pubertal sexuality shows up as a vague undefined aimless increase in tension similar to the first, endogenous, type. In the later development of this type there is normally a close association of this enhancement of tension with the increase of function of the sex glands and with the perception of, or phantasies about, the other sex. The perception or phantasy comes to seem the source of the great affect that really has its origin in the sex glands. The sexual urge is certainly the greatest source of a long continued enhancement of tension and as such of neuroses. This 22. The early Freudian views of the fore-pleasure mechanism which, it stems clear when one reads over Freud's attempts to clarify his views in the various editions of the Three Contributions and in the paper on Narcissism and the other metapsychological papers, were confused and confusing, I think can be elucidated in terms of the above consideration. Auto-erotism was a kind of self-stimulation which had the function of maintaining this residual excitation. The whole system was something on the order of what the radio engineers call a self-regenerating system. Freud severed himself very definitely from his neuro-anatomical days. With some of his reasons we can concur. Nevertheless one is entitled to wonder that he appears never to have made use of one well known feature in the structure of the reflex arc, the fact that it feeds back into itself. In terms of our symbolism we can picture the situation thus: s(0) _&gt;z) z See von Uxkull. Theoretical Biology, New York, 1926, Chap. VIII.

We note still another item of interest because of its bearings on later Freudian developments. Breuer states that the psychic apparatus must be divided into at least two systems, a perceptual apparatus which must differ from the apparatus which forms and preserves the memories. For unless the perceptual apparatus can im mediately return to its prior state after functioning, no further per ception can take place. He makes use of a physical model to illustrate this: the mirror of the reflecting telescope cannot at the same time function as a photographic plate.23 In this connection he mentions the idea that the memory image may possibly stimulate the perceptu al apparatus, i.e., the sense organ, if that is in a state of enhanced excitability. This hypothetical event is one of the three things Freud called 'regression' in his later study of the dream. In the beginning we raised the question whether the psycho analytic 'stability principle' had any relation to the Fechner 'stabili ty principle.' The answer, so far as Breuer is concerned, would clearly to be no. One wonders why Freud and others following him tried after 1918 to attach Fechner's name to this principle. Of course at that time Freud was changing his interpretation in ways which we shall see later, giving up the pleasure-pain inter pretation for the 'return to a former state' connotation which he called the 'repetition compulsion.' Fechner's stability principle was one postulating the eternal return to the same. But in 1892-5 the Breuer-Freud principle was taken from the world of experimental physiology and had to do with the interpretation of physiological fact. It was not taken from the realm of metaphysics, as the Fechner principle was. The analytic principle is valid today and is in the current of modern thought, as I have tried to show above. So much for a brief glance at Breuer's thinking. Only today, perhaps, in the light of the newest findings in the physiology of the central nervous system, do these early anticipations receive their full confirmation (or rebuttal). We will restate the above in the form of a set of sentences codifying the results of observation: 23. Studien p. 154, foot note.</page><page sequence="18">226 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. A. The psychic apparatus consists of several systems (perceptu al (P), memory (M), the Une., Consciousness (c), etc.) arranged in a series having a direction from sensory percep tion to motor discharge or associative elaboration. That is, it is a reflex apparatus. This is simply a statement of con temporary views of the structure of the mind. The system Une. was added by Breuer-Freud. B. This apparatus forms a steady state system.24 It is governed by the tendency to maintain a sum of excitement at a con stant level. According to Breuer, under the name stability principle it is Freud's restatement of Exner's notion. C. It is the tendency of the sum of excitement to increase. This is felt as 'pain.' Definition: If for some reason discharge of this increased excitation is impeded or prevented, that in hibiting condition is called traumatic. D. There are two sources of increase of excitement, external and internal stimuli from needs of the body, and an in trinsic endogenous excitation arising in the central nervous system itself. E. There are two types of discharge, associative elaboration and motility. F. There is some sort of conflict in the system. G. This postulate system can be used to explain the clinical fact of repression of once experienced situations and the return from repression of this material in the form of neurotic symptoms. This last is a methodological postulate; perhaps one might prefer to call it a hypothesis. It has been amply confirmed or justified by subsequent work. Before we proceed to the consideration of the 'fiction' as stated in the Interpretation of Dreams, the material which forms the real basis for our investigation, it will be well to notice some of the historic developments of the above material. Some of the hints (pos 24. Ives Hendrick (Facts and Theories of Psychoanalysis, New York, 1934, p. 93) also put forth the suggestion that Freud's 'tendency to maintain stability' could be interpreted in terms of the steady state concept, which he called homeostasis, following Cannon. Bernfeld and Feitelberg (The Principle of Entropy and the Death Instinct. I. J. P. xii, Jan. '31) deal with the principle of stability as derived from Le Chatelier's principle, but they take it in the sense of the concept of equilibrium, not that of steady state, which was not available when they wrote. There is an important difference between the two concepts.</page><page sequence="19">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 111 sibly the term 'implications' would be justified) contained gradual ly took on a recognized existence and became matters of observa tional fact. There are two types of active tendency spoken of. As we know, Freud later speaks of having assumed a duality of hunger and love, taking a hint from Schiller. The great chemical needs (hunger, thirst, etc.)25 are types of activity that strive to acquire a needed object, the acquisition of the object 'satisfies' the need, and the need ceases during the time the body assimilates and metabolizes it. The other type of activity, the first example of which was the need that drove the hysteric into having fits, was originally pictured by Breuer in terms of simple need to discharge some kind of tension. Freud, however, eventually saw deeper into the matter. We do not know when it became clear that this type of need was not simply a matter of 'discharging' something, or 'abreacting' an emotional state, but was also a need that could be satisfied only with the aid of an object, an object with which one did something, carried on some kind of activity, not one to which one did something as in the first type, eating, drinking, etc. The prototype of this second sort of need Freud came to see in sexuality. Breuer had seen that sexuality lay behind the hysteric's need. He said: 'I do not believe I exag gerate when I assert that the greatest number of severe neuroses in women take their origin in the marital bed.'26 In a footnote he refers to Freud's 1895 paper distinguishing the anxiety neurosis from neurasthenia. But neither Freud nor Breuer apparently at this time saw anything more than a simple 'discharge' in this drive. Freud had not yet discovered that the hysteric's symptoms were that person's sexual activity and had the meaning that the patient's behavior represented simultaneously that of the actor and of the object cooperated with. The old original concept of the need to discharge some endogenous activity disappeared from the picture. 25. Today we are able to specify the exact chemical nature of some of these needs, the conditions pathological or otherwise under which they arise, and much about the kind of behavior they dictate. Cf. the extensive experimental work reported by Curt Richter: The Internal Environment and Behavior. Amer. Jour. Psych. Jan. 1941, vol. 97, pp. 878-893, Also Ross McFarland's intro ductory essay in the same symposium, discussing the role of Oxygen, ib. 26. Studien 3rd. 1916 p. 217.</page><page sequence="20">228 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. If it still persists it is perhaps under the label 'auto-erotic activity.'27 It seems to have been of no consequence. I conjecture that the first step in the recognition of sexuality as an object need and not just a 'discharge' came about by way of recognition of the transference situation. We know in a vague way that there was something about this that seemed dangerous to Breuer and drove him away from further dealings with psychoanalysis. In any case, by means of the concept of repression, with its corollary of the repression of the 'Oedipus material, Freud came to see that what had looked super ficially like auto-erotism was in fact an activity carried on with a consciously or unconsciously phantasied object. We may assume that some part of the clarification began with Freud's attempt to work out the psychology of the dream process. But the clear distinction between 'auto-erotism' and an expression of an object need which only looks like auto-erotism came about subsequent to the years 1908-15,28 during which time the concept of narcissism was being elucidated in the reports. So much for the Breuerian background. We have now to con sider how Freud took this theory, which was for the most part a purely physiological one, and converted it into a psychology. The Breuerian theory was physiological-anatomical, based on the con temporary scientific ideology. From it Freud constructed a hy pothesis regarding the psychological structure of the psyche. This he did by the tacit assumption of another postulate : H. "Consciousness arises in the memory traces."29 In the main his construction proceeds by two lines of evolution running along side by side. The Breuerian system he employed to develop the 'fiction' which he uses to explain certain phenomena in the dream. This 'fiction' later becomes the germ of his 'meta psychology,' a term and a point of view that seems to have definitely 27. The view developed in the Three Contributions to Sexuality (1905, p. 70 of the 1st American Ed.) is this: The first sexual object is the mother's breast. This object is lost 'perhaps at the very time when it becomes possible for the child to form a general picture of the person to whom the organ granting him the gratification belongs. The sexual impulse later regularly becomes auto erotic, and only after overcoming the latency period is there a resumption of the original relation.' 'Object-finding is really a refinding.' In 1914 Freud adds in a note that there is another path,—the narcissistic, which seeks its own ego as object and finds it in the other. I don't know when the view developed that the child replaces the nipple with the penis as the first step in this series of substitutions.</page><page sequence="21">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 229 28. We tend to associate the date 1914 with the recognition of the concept of narcissism. The historic facts are not manifest in the literature. As was usual in the days of the first group, i.e., after 1907, ideas were discussed in the group under such conditions that they can be said to have been held in common. In this case, as in several others, Freud's paper in 1914 on the Introduction of Narcissism was written in response to Jung's polemic against the libido theory, which he asserted to be too narrow to include the phenomena of narcissism. For the rest the outstanding bibliographical facts are: In 1898 H. Ellis called attention to the state of being in love with one's self. Nack supplied the label 'narcissism' which was apparently first used in analytic literature by Sadger in 1909. As the result of a discussion with Freud, he published comments to the effect that narcissism formed a necessary transition stage from auto-erotism to object-erotism. Tb'S was seen as one root of homosexuality; one loved oneself as projected on the object. (Jahrb. f. Psychoanalyt. u. psychopatholog. Forsch, II, S. 112.) Freud in a footnote that same year in the 2nd ed. of the Three Contributions concurs with this view of Sadger's. In 1908 Abraham published views on the "Psychosexual Differences between Hysteria and Dementia Praecox" in which he speaks of discussions with Freud by correspondence. He puts forward views which Freud later extended in his discussion of the Schreber case (1911). Abraham regarded the D. P. as having regressed to the initial stage of auto-erotism. He does not use the concept of narcissism. Sachs made use of the concept in his paper on Naturegefuhl (Imago, vol. I, 1911). In 1911 Rank published a paper "Ein Beitrage zum Narcissimus," in which he discusses a patient's dream that pictures the process, following a disap pointment in love, of falling in love with one's own image which is not recognized as such. He brings together an interesting summary of mythological and poetic attempts to deal with the topic which was introduced to the literary world, so far as our records go, by Ovid. The final wind-up was given by Freud in his paper in 1914, Intro duction to Narcissism. This present essay can be regarded as the extension of some of Freud's comments on his method of work and of the way in which he uses theory. He contrasts "barren theoretical discussion' with theoretical discussion of observations. It is noteworthy that this follows his comment on the paranoiac's 'end of the world' phantasy, which comes about as the result of the 'draining off of the whole of the libidinal cathexis from the loved object' and the 'flowing back to the ego' (paraphrased from footnote p. 33, vol. iv, Coll. Works). In our terms, 'barren theoretical discussion' is the result of the extreme actualization of the autonomy principle. Federn in his subsequent papers on narcissism distinguishes a healthy and a pathological narcissism, depending on whether or not the attempt is made completely to replace object relations by narcissistic ones. (Cf. Zur Unterscheidung des gesunden und krankhaften Narcissmus. Imago xxii, 1936. Cf. also Pfandl: Der Narzissbegriff. Versuch einer neuen Deutung. Imago, xxi, 1934, for a detailed review of the myth, and its use by the poets as a recognition of the neurosis of narcissism and an effort to deal with it which is comparable to secondary elaboration in the dream work. This interesting paper came to my attention only after I had finished this essay. 29. Notiz sur Wunderblok. 1925.

WILBUR, M. D. crystallized somewhere around 1915, I believe as the result of the working out of the concept of narcissism. The other line of develop ment consisted in the investigation of the 'content' of particular wishes and the fate of this content, the nature of the substitutive changes it underwent, the reasons for these transformations, and the way in which the ego tries to re-establish object relations on the basis of these transformations. From this second class of data Freud was able to procure more specific meanings for the unspecified variables in his metapsychological postulates and to develop the implications of these postulates. We shall see how his 'fiction' ceases to be a fiction and becomes a definite picture of the structure of the psyche. The working over of the Breuerian theory occurs in the final section of the Interpretation of Dreams in a chapter called: The Psychology of the Dream-processes. The first striking fact about the chapter is that it stands with very little alteration in the 8th edition just as it is in the 1st, and this in spite of all the apparent novelties that were later introduced into the theory. The most notable comments added subsequently are some paragraphs intro duced after the discovery of the super-ego, showing that some pain ful dreams can be interpreted as satisfying the wishes of the Pes. which in some respects corresponds to the super-ego. But that the Pes. had wishes which enter into the formation of the dream is very evident, although perhaps not very clearly stated, in the initial version. Since Freud had already proclaimed in 1900 that the anx iety problem is not properly a dream problem even when anxiety shows up as a content in dreams; it is perhaps natural not to look for any reflection of changed views relating to this item—in this chapter. In some instances notes have been appended referring to sub sequent elaborations of ideas expressed in this chapter. It is as if Freud wished to preserve inviolate this historic beginning of psycho analytic theory. It is to be noted that many changes were incor porated into the preceding chapters as new discoveries, and new in terpretations of old variables were made. Thus the final section preserves the original germ, the remainder of the book studied in its eight editions records the development and progress of the theory. So the 'Interpretation of Dreams' constitutes both the foundation of psychoanalysis and a record of its historic development. The changes incorporated do not constitute radical alterations, they are</page><page sequence="23">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 231 for the most part additions of more detailed specifications in place of initially vague variables, and in some cases involve slight changes in interpretations which seem at first of little significance but which may involve greater consequences than one could have conceived possible. The second striking fact we will note, and pass on without at tempting to read into it any significance. If we had not been in search of the presuppositions leading to the death instinct we would not have remarked it. We can tell ourselves it is merely one of those coincidents to be noted in life. The chapter begins with a report of a typical dream told Freud by a patient who had heard it in a lecture. The content of the dream deals with a dead person who is represented as living. Freud interprets this as evidence for his thesis that the dream makes it possible for the individual to go on sleeping, since neither he nor the other person is dead. We can say that the state of sleep is a steady state which it is the function of the dream to preserve when it is threatened with disruption by needs. We could call this postulate I. Since Freud takes pains at the end of this introductory section to disclaim any possibility of explaining the dream as a psychic process on the basis of what is known up to this point, he clearly means to deny that this proposition explains a dream. The phenomenon 'dream' exists, and this postulate simply deals with one of its functions or the nature of its content. The next section, A, is headed the 'Forgetting of Dreams.' It goes on to point out that we have no clear record of any dream. Instead we have a memory full of lacunae. These we fill in during our report of a dream with materials which previous writers had regarded as 'arbitrary improvisations.' We might call them sub stitutions. Freud's rule, "the fundamental rule" of psychoanalysis, was to regard even this substitute material as subject to analysis just as much as if it were the original material. The reasons for the choice of this material betrays the presence of hidden motives. The use of this rule seemed justified by the results obtained; equally valid results came from the study of the substitutions as would have come from the original material. Today no analyst would question the validity of this rule of procedure. In the beginning it needed some justification such as it receives in this section of the book. Freud goes on to point out that such substitutions,while sometimes</page><page sequence="24">232 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. presenting the appearance of having been made by the most superfi cial and trivial of association paths, are really determined by deep underlying tendencies such as led to the dream in the first place. It is the purpose of analysis to discover the nature of the substitutions so that the nature of the hidden rules of substitution may be learned. But the dream itself is already the result of a process of substitution, the manifest content is a substitution for the latent thoughts. The process of interpreting a dream is a process of reverse substitution which attempts to replace the manifest content with the latent and this in turn with an analysis of the urges active in that individual patient as conditioned by his unique biography. Speaking in terms of a subsequent insight: it amounts to a description of the condi tions and relationships of the objects effective in his milieu at the moment of the dream. Having justified his method of investigation Freud now undertakes to investigate that feature of dreams which seemed of primary importance, the presentation by the dream of the dream-thought, whatever its nature, as a now present visual scene. The conceptual content is transformed into visual images.30 How and why constitutes his problem. Freud summarizes for us the results of his preceding investiga tion of the content of dreams. The motive power of the dream is invariably a wish working against a censorship; hence the unrecog nizability of the wishes. Three other factors play a part in the con struction,—a need for condensing the material, a regard for pres entability in sensory images (chiefly visual and auditory and their juxtaposition), and a tendency to work over the heterogeneous and disordered material into a coherent and intelligible orderly story,— the secondary elaboration of the manifest content. It is this last feature which had struck previous observers, and which had served to hide the real nature of the dream. That is to say, they had looked for the meaning in the window dressing the material received, not in the material and how it got into the display window. A statement made by Fechner in his Psychophysic to the effect that the dream is staged elsewhere than in the waking ideation, gives Freud the impetus to explore the possibility of constructing a 'fiction' on the model of a compound microscope or telescope. It will be recalled that Breuer also had used a somewhat similar com 30. P. 493, Interpretation of Dreams, New York. 1933.</page><page sequence="25">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 233 parison in his discussion. The dream occurs between structures, then, rather than in them, just as the image in the instrument occurs between the lens systems and not in them. With this as a start and in conjunction with Breuer's theory, Freud constructs his psychic apparatus composed of sigma systems. Roughly speaking, these correspond to the systems of lenses in the instrument, the dream to the formation of images in the flow of light through the apparatus. On the biological plane the apparatus corresponds to the structure and physiology of the soma, the flow of light through the system to the flow of libido31 and sensory impressions through the sigma systems. This flow and its adventures in the process constituted the available data of psychology. This simple scheme does for a starter. In this model the flow of light does not alter the structure of the ap paratus. But in the living organism, as Freud discovered and as I shall try to demonstrate, the apparatus is modified by the materials that flow through it. It is as if some of them were precipitated to be come part of the structure of the apparatus (cf. hysterical conver sion) . The task Freud was confronted with is comparable to that of the man who in trying to understand the physical workings of a compound microscope has also to study the history of its develop ment. We will not attempt to follow Freud's steps in detail. Instead we will give a statement of his results, with the commentary after the fashion of a postulate system. It is necessary to notice first of all that he seems to be dealing with a steady state system within a system, the state of sleep. It is a function of the dream to preserve this SS when it is threatened with disruption. This it does by interpreting the stimuli which arise during sleep in such a way that the state of sleep is preserved and continues without recourse to motility. The sleeping psyche is a 31. It must be remembered that while Freud believed there were other kinds of energy in the psyche, such as the 'interest' he associated with the 'ego instincts,' he knew nothing about such hypothetical energies and had no satisfactory way of observing them. Psychoanalysis was then, as now, an observa tional science like physics, its 'pointer-readings' were given it by the observation of the flow of libido as revealed in its cathexes, and more particularly by the occurrence of neurotic anxiety, which was according to theory the manifestation of libido transformed by the processes of repression. A newcomer today, unless he bears this in mind when reading back into the history of psychoanalysis, will be at a loss to understand the apparent blindness of the observers of that day to the most obvious facts, such as narcissism and aggressiveness. Many things are missing in the early literature, which does not mean that they were not observed but that they could not yet be talked about.</page><page sequence="26">234 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. subsystem within a system, and we can take this as our first pos tulate, thus putting into a few words what constitutes the whole context of the final section of the book. This subsystem is obviously one composed of fewer systems than the waking psyche. In the first place the greater part of the perceptual system is not functioning, the part directed at the outer world has a greatly heightened thresh old. The psyche does continue to receive stimuli from the body itself, from its proprio-and enteroceptors. And that such organic sensa tions do influence dreams and enter into them, is a well-established fact of experimental observation. Freud gives a summary of this material in his historic survey. This inner steady state system receives stimuli from its S, in this case the soma and its needs, and only to a very small extent from the outer world. This excitation builds up a tension, 'pain,' which must be discharged. So Freud postulates a primitive system built on the order of the reflex apparatus. At that time the concept of steady state was not yet invented, but its use now clearly seems indicated. This primitive system is the Une. It is only pushed into action by the needs and can only act in one way to discharge its tension. It cannot discriminate or select by rejecting what shall satisfy it. As was said many years later, the primitive system can not say 'No!' As we shall see in a moment, the selecting of satis fying objects, the function of discrimination, is the function of a second system. Later the comparison of the primitive psyche with the amoeba was made, and we can see here how correct this was. This primitive system retains the relatively passive relation to its surrounding world characteristic of the amoeba. If death occurs to it, it is because of changes in this outer world which it can neither anticipate nor alter. As will be realized I am here introducing de scriptive points that were made much later, but they were implicit in the original specifications. But this primitive system is not an amoeba. It is a psychic system within a psyche. Its source and sink are provided for it by the perceptions of the psyche and the memory traces. Its source of tension seems to be stimuli from the organic needs, its sink the memory residues associated with the experience of the first satisfaction and the preconscious residues left by the day's in completed and 'unsolved issues' (p. 511). The current from the s (need) through primitive system to sink (memory of first sat</page><page sequence="27">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 235 isfaction) constitutes the wish. The Une. can only wish. And it -cannot achieve satisfaction by means of merely cathecting a memory image instead of the necessary object. The wish will continue, and tension builds up. Now a second and later system enters into the picture. This system, the Pes., has the function of selecting (cf. p. 526-7) which memory residues shall be cathected to produce the image of the satisfying object or the completion of the act required by the wish. This object or the activity selected shall be of such •a nature as not to awaken the sleeper, if possible (p. 542). Where we have used the word 'selecting', Freud uses 'censoring' and "criticising'. Our choice of word would seem to throw more emphasis on the Psc. than Freud did. But later developments justify our word. The fact that the Psc. also has wishes to be satisfied by the •dream is not enlarged upon in 1900. This is mentioned, and the wish to sleep is alloted to the Psc.32 But since the principal motive force of the dream seems to be the Unc.infantile wish, the stress is on that. The libido is in the Une. After the discovery of the concept of the super-ego, which came about when Freud somewhere prior to 1923 asked himself why the censorship was also uncon scious, this fact that the Psc. has wishes came into more prominence and was then incorporated into the chapter we are considering. This discovery of the super-ego led to the insertion of several paragraphs dealing with the dream of painful content as also a wish-fulfillment. Such dreams had previously seemed a possible ■exception to the rule. If the wish to sleep now assigned to the ego be regarded as an Une. wish that has become integrated into the ego, then the 32. p. 5 29 'the preconscious wants to sleep.' This statement is later recognized to be subject to correction after the discovery of the ego. Perhaps we should say rather the recognition of the ego. The concept of the ego is already almost explicit in 1900 in the notion of the 'control of motility.' On page 162 of the 7th edition (1922) the wish to sleep is assigned to the ego along with the secondary elaboration. This is obviously where they belong. Again on p. 525 he speaks of the wish to sleep on the part of the Pes. It is dear that Freud is struggling with an ambiguity due in part to his failure to recognize the institution of the ego (a failure conditioned by apparent lack of any means of investigating it) and also to his wish to have the dream wish determined like a hysterical symptom by wishes from both the Une. and the Pes. The wish to sleep is the most obvious wish he can use for this purpose. It is to be remembered that he will not discover for many years the relation of self-punishment to the Pes., and not until 1918 (Jenseits) that the ego has some powers to be considered. But even then he rejects the idea of an instinct to perfection.</page><page sequence="28">236 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. original formulation still stands: the dream is the result of Un conscious wishes. What exactly the concept of 'discharge' means in 1900 in the dream process is not clear. The Breuerian concept was based on the concept of the reflex arc and had a definite anatomico-physiological meaning. But in the case of the dream this is excluded. Freud tries to erect a psychological view in terms of which he defines his 'wish.' He tries to define 'discharge' in terms of Breuer's term 'binding', which is another unspecified variable. So far as I can gather nobody understands this later term. In any case it is simply another name for a name that had no meaning in the first place. As we shall see eventu ally, the concept of wish is ambiguous at this point. It is open to two interpretations, one physiological, the other psychological. The choice depends, as we shall see, on whether one regards libido as a. chemical or a nervous energy. But even this statement is open to correction. We will leave this point until later; at present we are leading up to a statement of the 'fiction'. So we may here simply state that Freud specifies that the Une. wish regressively cathexes a memory image of the desired object. Th Une. and its tendency Freud calls the primitive system and the primary process. On p. 520 he speaks of it in terms of the small child who, experiencing a need that seeks an outlet in motility, cries, giving 'expression to the emotions'. This does not change the situation, does not bring surcease; only an 'experience of satisfaction' can do that. If the need is for food, only the actual intake of food can bring about this satisfaction; and necessarily in the beginning this is brought about by the intervention of the mother or nurse. In this casual observation of a commonplace fact is contained the germ of many future developments in psychoanalytic theory, - among other things, the germ of the first duality (sex and hunger) that held the field until the discovery of narcissism in 1915. The primitive system can only wish, and can thus only cathect the memory image of a first satisfaction. If left to itself it would necessarily die. Especially would it do this if it were able to cathect the memory image to hallucinatory vividness and exhaust itself in the process. But by the very definition of the pleasure-principle this is a contradiction in terms, as Freud had to admit. The Une. has only this one activity, - it has no discriminating powers or perceptual facilities. It can only 'establish an identity of perception'.</page><page sequence="29">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 237 It has no way of knowing that the hallucinated object is not the real object. But the first does not and cannot bring satisfaction; the need continues and eventually a secondary activity is set up. It is just at this point that I believe Freud was guilty of an oversight. He does not seem to have asked himself what became of this overflow of energy, nor whether it was not instrumental in setting up the second system. The reason is not far to seek. The later approach to a situation from the dynamic, economic, and topographical points of view had not yet been clearly worked out. Although clearly implicit in the point of view of 1900 these, like the other implications we are considering, were not yet explicitly developed. Freud has often been taken to task for not having started with clearly defined entities among which the relationships had been clearly stated. We might call this the pre-scientific religious phil osophical point of view and method of work. More often than not it develops the meaning of names. It is not inclined to inquire deeply as to their origin and application in a given instance. This was not Freud's method of work. He has left us many descriptions of his method. He was accustomed to seek out a few salient relation ships among the phenomena under investigation. He did not try to specify what the phenomenon was; i. e., he did not try to define and explain it before he began to work with it. He gave it a tag, a name, so he could find it again. Intead of using letters or numbers like a logician or mathematician or chemist to designate his unspecified variables, - a practice which we can now see would have served equally well to stir up the logomachists, - he chose to use names such as Une., Pes., 'Pleasure', 'Pain', etc. Except for the relationship or relationships of immediate interest for the discussion he was going to make, everything was left as vague as could be; the meanings to be given these vague entities were to be, if possible, out of the initially chosen relationships. These were always given by clinical observation. He named them and the names had connotations. If Freud succeeded in keeping clearly in mind what he was denoting by his names, his readers did not. They have often reacted to the connotations, not to the denota tions. We are going to see later something of how this worked, but at the moment our immediate question relates to the origin of an apparent oversight, a surplus of energy. We have given.</page><page sequence="30">238 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. one reason, but there is another. Freud postulated a duality which •could produce a conflict in the system. It was not clear wh®'» resided nor between what two things. But to have the primary and secondary system both set up by one kind or source of energy would have seemed at that time to contemplate a monistic point of view which he was obliged to reject. Eventually he did accept this view (1918), and notes that Jung had long since put forth one somewhat similar. So also had Rank in 1907 (Kunstler), a fact which nobody seems to have noticed.33 But to stick to the state of affairs in 1900, such questions •could not then be approached; they were genetic questions which &lt;ould only be broached after the Oedipus situation and its fate had been worked out by much analytic investigation of the Une. 'content' of dreams and symptoms. The question of the origin of the secondary system could be asked only at the end of this investigation, not at the beginning of it. Before we proceed much further it will perhaps be advantageous to lift out of this discussion and its source in the Interpretation of Dreams something on the order of the postulate system which w^e have asserted to be the partly explicit, partly tacit presup position which provides the foundation for all other analytic work. We do not offer it as Freud's. I. The psychic system is a system within a system (soma). 33. Jung: The Theory of Psychoanalysis, Washington, 1915, Chap. Ill, "The Conception of Libido," does not touch on the question as raised above. Jung came to his conception (which is not clear to me) by way of rejecting the Freudian theory because of the interpretation given the word 'pleasure.' He did not take it in the sense of the stability principle as I have described it, but in the narrow sense of being synonymous with pleasure in the sexual orgasm, a sense which he attributes to Freud in the Three Contributions. He seems to be referring to a remark of Freud's (p. 40 Wash. 1910 ed.) which spçaks of a 'motor reaction in the form of an orgasm' induced by 'pleasure sucking' in the infant. No doubt this interpretation of 'pleasure' was explored, but the fact that the Three Contributions can be read today in terms of the present thesis without any feeling of incongruity shows the correctness of Freud's instinct in sticking to the postulate and not to the particular application or interpretation of it. Jung seems to have been swayed by the tentative interpretation. Rank: Der Kunstler, 1907, p. 15 (my paraphrase). The organic must (unlike the inorganic) maintain itself by constantly renewed relations to outer world . . . nevertheless it strives for purely inner satisfactions. . . . Ex pression of this immediate need is the first growth impulse of the organism. . . . With the growth of the organism grow organic needs no longer to be satisfied inwardly. This structural unrest creates a kind of instability that soon mounts to an inner impulse which becomes an impelling longing, a libido. "The libido is thus the reaction to an injury, to a pain, to the setting aside ■of which it is called into being."</page><page sequence="31">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 239 II. These systems have a tendency to maintain a steady state (the stability postulate). Definition 1. An apparatus having the SS tendency can be said to be built on the order of a reflex apparatus. This presupposes, of course, the whole body of neuro physiological knowledge, sensory intake at one of a trans mission line and discharge apparatus - muscle, gland, or secondary psychic system - at the other. Definition 2. The SS in the case of the psychic apparatus consists in an optimum level of 'nervous excitation'. This term is an undefined variable, be it noted. Further speci fication must be physiological. Definition 3. An increase in this sum of 'nervous ex citation' is felt as 'pain', a decrease as 'pleasure'. Definition 4. The sum of excitation can be increased by the stimulus from the somatic needs, the SS tendency acts in a given case to counteract this stimulus and cause it to cease. This is called 'satisfying' the 'wish' thus put into action. III. Nothing but a wish can set the psychic system into action. This postulate specifies the kind of phenomena subject to psycho analytic investigation, i. e., it specifies the universe of discourse. IV. There is a duality in the system such that the wish attains its satisfaction only after conflict. V. The psychic system is composed of several systems roughly arranged in serial order, the Perceptual system), the Une., the M(emory) system, the Pes. (preconscious), the Con scious) system. So much is simply a restatement of the Breuerian system. We have now to see how Freud added to it or modified it in applying, it to the dream. VI. Consciousness arises in the memory traces. VII. The state of sleep is a steady state within a larger SS system, the psyche. VIII. When threatened with disruption by a wish it is able to persist as an SS because of the dream. IX. A dream is the result of a conflict between two systems within the psyche. It is a manifestation of the principle of auton omy. The organism seeks to find its source and sink within</page><page sequence="32">240 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. itself. Visual images are substituted for the shut-out world of reality. X. Within this steady state two tendencies, two modes of activity, are manifested. They are the activities of two institutions in the psyche, the Une. (a primitive system) and the Pes. (a later system). Definition 1. Wish; a mode of activity exhibited by the 1st system. It is said to be dominated by the pleasure principle. It strives to find the object that will produce satisfaction and bring the wish to an end. It knows no discrimination and hence is unable to distinguish between an object and its visual representation. The energy of the wish tends to exhaust itself in the cathexis of the image. This is called 'being bound'. (TD p. 551) Definition 2. The second type of activity arises from the failure of the first type to bind the energy and still the need. The excess flows over into the kind of acting that eventually substitutes the object for its image. Freud calls this process 'bringing about an identity of perception by a detour through the world of reality'. This is the 'reality principle'. The beginnings of this mode of activity constitute the germ of the Pes. system which is thus later in development than the 1st system. It has the function of preventing the development of pain and ultimate death by the uninhibited action of the 1st system. Since we are not trying to work out anything beyond the roughest sort of scheme of postulates and presuppositions we will let this much suffice. It will serve our purpose, which is to talk about some of the many interpretations that have been offered some of the variables. As a logical postulate system it has many faults. It is probably redundant. It is certainly incomplete. Any psycho analyst could pick many flaws in it. Nothing has been said about repression and anxiety, for instance. We do not know whether they can be derived from the given postulates. And how would one go about deriving from this list three structures in the psyche, Id, Ego, Super-ego, which are now so important to us? The Id and Ego offer no difficulty since they are merely matters of renaming something already given. Perhaps all that is necessary to complete this system is what was subsequently discovered, some means of</page><page sequence="33">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 241 shifting things from the outer world into the inner, and vice-versa across the boundary which Freud later identified with the Ego. One or two further postlutes readily occur to mind. XI. There are at least two types of wish in the system, those taking their origin in hunger (and its congeners) and sex. XII. All wishes must take their origin in somatic needs. The exact status of this proposition (XII), whether postulate or hypothesis to be proven, remains to be seen. There are several things to be said about this little system. Definition 3 under II provides the only means available to the observer in the analytic situation of detecting the way the system under observation is working. It gives him his 'pointer readings'. Postulate III of course says that all the phenomena constituting the material of psychoanalytic observation are some unspecified function of a wish. This is simply the principle of psychic determinism restated. These two together provide for the translation of what is otherwise a purely physiological system manifesting random behavior into a system of psychology. It is to be noted that the hypothetico-deductive system, although primarily a statement of facts to be observed behavioristically, can also be used to infer physiological possibilities and to guide psychological research. It is a tool from which one can work both ways, from psychology into physiology or vice-versa. The 'tendency to preserve a steady state' is a physico-chemical and physiological concept. The 'wish' is its psychological equivalent. It follows as an immediate consequence of the physiological definition of the SS tendency that no wish can be satisfied within the system in which it is a wish; i. e., the Unc.wish must be satisfied outside the Une., the Pes. wish outside the Pes., and the conscious wish outside the psyche in the world of 'reality'. This is not to say that the Une. wish must not eventually be satisfied in the world of reality. This in fact is one of the questions the sys tem sets out to explore. We can put it as a general question: Can any wish whatever be completely satisfied except by ultimate resort to the world of reality? As has already been indicated several times, one possible in terpretation of a 'death instinct' would be a tendency to find sat isfaction within some less extensive field than the world of reality,</page><page sequence="34">242 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. in the sort of field that in former days used to be called a world of higher spirituality. Such a tendency as this would seem to be equivalent to what we called the tendency to autonomy. We can rephrase the question about the nature of the death instinct in terms of our system: can the tendency to autonomy become so completely independent that it is subject to no check? It is to be noted that this tendency to autonomy is not a 'wish' but is a more general principle having the same relation to wishes as has the tendency to maintain a steady state. The "wish" is merely the manifestation on the psychological plane of a more general tendency which is to be found on many planes of organic existence, including the infra- and supra- psychological. The Pleasure-Pain Principle. Under the name SS principle we have already had a good deal to say about this fundamental postulate of psychoanalysis. The validity of this present effort at reinterpretation turns on the validity of our assumption that the two names apply to the same phenomenon. We believe we have shown sufficient reason for making such an equation. This principle is, of course, the principle of psychic determinism under another name. It is also, as can be seen by Freud's definition of it on p. 552, a principle of the survival of the fittest, identical (or almost so) with the behaviorist's trial and error principle. The physico-chemical steady state statement of the principle be comes a psychological equivalent by the definition of 'pain' in terms of increase of 'excitation' in the psyche. The psyche is equated with the central nervous system. Now, there is an ambiguity about the word 'pain' (Unlust) that has long been apparent to psychoanalysts. It is not the same as our ordinary word pain (schmerz). Translators have long sought to substitute some equivalent, 'un-pleasure', 'discomfort', 'pain', as distinguished from pain, etc. But curiously enough it has struck very few that the same ambiguity also applies to the word 'pleasure'. In the original definition of the word by Breuer Freud there was no reference to any sexual connotation. It meant simply decrease of excitation to the optimum. But it was not long before the pleasure-pain principle was being equated with the word 'pleasure' taken in the sexual sense (See reference to Jung above). Some recent comments on this confusion can be found in</page><page sequence="35">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 243 Rado's recent essay on bisexuality.34 Nevertheless the notion served well enough as an indicator to distinguish two series of reactions among psychic phenomena, and did so until 1917-18 when the phenomena associated with the traumatic war neuroses forced a re examination of the principle because of their apparent incon sistency with this particular interpretation. As we know, this re-examination constitutes one of the important turning points in the history of psychoanalysis. As a result of it Freud went back to the other features of the basic principle, the repetition aspect and the 'necessity for the reinstatement of an earlier situation'.35 However Freud chose to take this last characterization not in the physico chemical meaning given in the principle of Le Chatelier, but in the psychological meaning of trying to re-unite a disrupted and dispersed former totality of organism and milieu. As I have tried to demonstrate above, this was implicitly, at least, the clinical fact with which psychoanalysis began. The important question was, and still is, the specification of the totality in question. It has been the task of nearly half a century of clinical obser vation to establish the nature of the totality which the psyche seeks to restore, the nature of the traumatic incident that disrupted it, and the real purpose of this reinstatement. Beginning with an almost trivial bit of behavior on the part of a child (an effort at mastery of a situation of separation), the observation of which is introduced as if of no great consequence (p. II Jenseits), a most important line of thought was brought fully into light. Ego phenomena which had hitherto been of necessity neglected, since they could not be understood in terms of the previous interpretation of the general theory, now became accessible to psychoanalysis. One has only to look back through a chronological list of psycho analytic publications to be convinced of this. Yet the line of thought in question is already implicit in the Interpretation of Dreams 34. Sandor Rado: A Critical Examination of the Concept of Bisexuality. Psychosomatic Med., ii, Oct., 1940, p. 465. 35. p. 74, Beyond the Pleasure-Principle. There is another ambiguity about the word 'pleasure' related to the one mentioned, but yet distinct. If this meaning is given the word 'pleasure-principle,' then the latter is not the same as 'repetition-compulsion,' a distinction that is frequently made. The root meaning of this word 'pleasure' is not very clear to me but can be understood in terms of the fore-pleasure mechanism as producing the tension necessary to lead up to the orgasm. I suspect this concept to be a tacit generalization of this particular sexual mechanism which is clearly a reflex self-regenerative mechanical process comparable to that seen in our radio tubes.</page><page sequence="36">244 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. in the tiiscussion of thinking as carried out under the guidance of the Pes. Freud discusses it there as an admission under controlled conditions of a part of the energic cathexis with the aim of exploring the possibilities of a situation. When he came to revise his theory of anxiety he did so in almost the same terms. Anxiety is a warning signal permitted by the ego which thus samples in anticipation the dreadful consequences of some intended activity. It is the deliberate (?) repetition of a part of a former situation. However, we wish to examine in somewhat more detail some of the various interpretations given the variables in the theory prior to this turning point. Wish. This term also was an uninterpreted variable which turned out in a practice to be ambiguous. The meaning given it in the Interpretation of Dreams was undoubtedly in keeping with the line of thought derived from the investigation of the hysteric. The wish of the dream exhibits its character by cathexis of the memory of a first or prior satisfaction. It is the psychological expression of a need. This is a definition completely satisfactory to our ordinary daily thinking. So long as one does not try to penetrate to stages prior to conscious object-relations, there is no difficulty. But psychoanalysts could not rest content with such a limitation on their speculative flights. Even in 1900 Freud was thinking of the dream as a regression to an early stage of infancy.30 He speaks of the dream as a 'fragment of the superseded psychic life of the child', (p. 522). Some pages later he quotes Robert and H. Ellis in support in a passage that speaks of the 'return to the embryonal standpoint of psychic life in the dream' (p. 544). It remained for Ferenczi to develop this line of thought in an essay stimulated by Freud's 1911 reconsider 36. One type of tendency which can be called a "wish" sometimes, does not seem to have been investigated. Freud speaks of sleep as having the function of recuperation. Although he compares the act of dreaming to the state of infancy. Freud, so far as I know, never frankly compared the Une. nor the psychic state of sleeping to the state of the foetus. It is my impression, however, that such a comparison was in the air and it would be justified on the basis of a comparison of the foetal state and sleep as being states of synthesis and organization, integra tion. If this comparison be allowed, then there is a real parallelism that justifies speaking of sleep as a return to the uterus. Is one going to call such a tendency a regressive wish? But one wonders what justification exists for thinking of a psychological state of affairs in the foetus and not also in the blood system which we think of as purely physico-chemical in its behavior.</page><page sequence="37">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 245 ation of the Two Principles of Mental Functioning. Ferenczi37 says: "supported by considerations which Freud has expounded in the general part of his Traumdeutung, that the first consequence of this disturbance (by birth) is the hallucinatory re-occupation of the satisfying situation that is missed, the untroubled existence in the warm, tranquil body of the mother". The "first wish" according to Ferenczi is the desire to return to this situation in the uterus. Since this line of thought bears on the meaning of the Une., we will return to this statement. But at this point we wish to notice that this first wish can be understood in terms of the SS principle. Birth has disturbed the steady state that existed in the uterus. The question will be raised: is this a steady state? The questioners will possibly have in mind the question of disturbances arising from growth. But there is no reason to suppose that is not compatible with the existence of a steady state; quite the contrary. And it has not been customary for psychoanalysis to think of the growth impulse as such as having any kind of psychological representation. Freud for one seems definitely to have rejected this notion (Beyond the Pleasure Prin ciple, p. 52-3). There is obviously a great limitation on the kind of sensory impulse the foetus can obtain by reason both of the nature of his environment and of the immaturity of his sensory motor system. Psychoanalysis has long had the view that the psychic state of the foetus is objectless. And hence without 'memories', is the tacit implication. It is customary on these occasions to talk about 'primary narcissism', - whatever that may mean. In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to think of this "1st wish" as being of the same order of hallucinatory reoccupation of memories" as the wishes Freud studies in the pro duction of a dream. In any case this line of thought seems to have received its quietus when Rank tried to work it up into the Birth-trauma speculation. The difficulty thus prematurely disposed of, and not since faced out, we can surmise as being behind Freud's difficulty in conceiving of the death instinct. Wishes were the psychological representation of the instincts expressed in terms of object relations. If the two concepts of wish, the physiological 37. Stages in the Development of the Sense of Reality, in Contributions to Psycho-analysis, Badger, Boston, 1916, p. 188.</page><page sequence="38">246 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. SS concept and the psychological concept as initially defined by Freud in terms of memories (i. e., object relations), are co extensive or equivalent, then one would expect to find something like an innate wish to die. So far as I know Freud never wrote anything on this topic. He did state many times that the Une. can have no conception of death. But the death-instinct is only one of several types of impulse or tendency to action in the organism which if represented psycho logically by wishes are difficult to think of in terms of hallucin atory cathexis of the memory of a first satisfaction. These questions arise, however, only for the speculative thinker who has gone beyond the known facts. The analyst who is dealing with matters of observable fact has to deal only with wishes derived from object relations established some time after birth. Presumably all the conscious death wishes, suicide wishes, destructive wishes, we encounter in our patients are of this late order and are not manifes tations of the death instinct.38 Probably these questions have not been looked into more deeply because the term Une. was taken clinically to mean 'repressed Une.' Freud devotes very little con sideration to any other kind. The Primary System. This was taken in a temporal as well as in a structural and genetic sense. Taken temporally a natural interpretation was: the primitive psychic apparatus corresponds to the mind of the foetus. So far as I know this was never explicitly stated. Ferenczi's statement noticed above can be taken in this sense. In a footnote to his essay on the 'Two Principles,' Freud speaks of the early days of maternal care and does not mention the foetal 38. In this connection it does not seem to have been suggested yet that the death wish against the father which is a component part of the Oedipus situa tion was a reflection of the death instinct. Some day someone is going to notice that in the Oedipus myths and the myths of the birth of the hero the possibility exists that the child's death wish against the father is derived from the father's prior death wish against the son and heir. It will be recalled that it was the clinical manifestation of this wish as indicated by the potential father's fear of sexuality taken in the sense of reproduction that formed the stimulus to Spielrein's paper 'Destruction as the Cause of Becoming.' Her essay was one of the sources of Freud's own excogitations in 'Beyond the Pleasure-Principle,' but he seems to have passed up this particular point. The questions involved here which arise from an uncertainty as to one's point of view seem to me exactly comparable to those a confused person could ask about the process of photography. There could be no photographic image without the specially pre pared film, but that by itself would show no images, i.e., potentially all possible images.</page><page sequence="39">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 247 state, but he does go on to compare the primary process to the state of the bird inside the egg, "able to satisfy even its nutritional requirements autistically (to use Bleuler's words)." As we saw above the foetal state cannot have wishes in the usual sense of the word. The organic needs of the foetus are satisfied without the intervention of the neuro-muscular system by means of the foetal blood stream. The only neuro-muscular activity involved is that of the mother. The insistence upon the interpretation that this primary system corresponds to the mind of the foetus would seem to call for the giving up of the postulate which requires that the psychic system arise out of the neuro-muscular one. This, how ever, is not necessary, as can easily be shown. If we go back to thinking in such chemical terms as Freud once suggested as a pos sible interpretation for 'libido,' we can easily clear away some of the difficulties. The vastly increased knowledge we possess today of the respiratory mechanism, of the recent findings by Cannon39 of the continuation of the action of the nervous impulse by the acetylcholine liberated by the nervous impulse, of the new dis coveries in connection with the sexual hormones, etc., easily permits us to think of cathexis by instincts in terms of chemical sensitiza tion and shows us we need not think solely in terms of nervous impulses. There is evidence tç believe that there are patterns in the neuro-anatomy which have a selective affinity for such hormones. To be sure we still have to explain how such patterns are set up, but there is no reason to anticipate any theoretical difficulty here. It is just a question of doing the work. It belongs to the field of the neuro-anatomist. It must be borne in mind that I am simply speculating here; the interpretations that are being offered for Freud's unspecified variables are purely verbal and in that sense are not real interpretations; those must come from actual ex perimental work. My speculations have only the presumptive value of clearing away some of the confusions of thought that I conceive to have clustered around some of these terms. If this chemical interpretation of the primary process be granted any cogency, then certain difficulties in the theory that have been 39. W. B. Cannon: The Argument for Chemical Mediation of Nerve Impulses. Science, 90, p. 521, Dec. 9, 1939</page><page sequence="40">248 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. briefly indicated above would seem to disappear.40 There is, for instance, no need to attempt to explain how the 2nd system grows out of the overflow of excess energy from the 1st system. There is also no need to attempt to explain the existence of memories prior to the anatomic possibility of having experienced them. If we wish to grant to psychological memory some sort of anatomical basis, let us say in neural patterns, we can still leave the investigation of the ontogeny of such patterns to the geneticist and neuro anatomist since the genesis of such patterns need not be considered as part of the data of psychology, even by way of a tacit Lamarcki anism. We accorded above to the Freudian proposition 'conscious ness arises in the memory trace,' the status of a postulate. Possibly this postulate can be derived from the others; we need not concern ourselves with that, since we are not trying to create an ideal logical system consisting of a minimum number of completely independent postulates. The problem the psychologist is confronted with is the process by which conditions existing prior to experience and memory of it get translated into psychology. And one of the paths by which we can investigate this process is the dream process as studied by Freud in this general section. The problem he was investigating was the process by which Une. wishes get translated into visual memory data which belong to the Pes. or 2nd system. The secondary system, the Pes. We have already said most of what we have to say about this system. But it may be worth while 40. However, it is possible that new difficulties will appear in their place. What now are we going to do with the concept of 'repression,' which to be sure is not yet explained? We would seem to have to shift its application from being some sort of purely psychological process to its being some sort of ego-controlled chemical process of activation and neutralization. Anticathexis, for instance, could bî explained possibly in terms of the production and ap pHcjtion to specific neurone paths of anti-hormones. The only thing against such a line of thought regarding an ego-activity is, so far as I know, its com plete novelty. What material basis, if any, it has for its support I do not know. We could doubtless find one if we looked for it. The chemical basis for it undoubtedly exists. If one finds in such a theory something he wishes violently to reject, it only serves to show how completely and unconsciously v.*e have come to think of psychology in terms only of currents travelling over neurone paths, so that we have to equate every psychological possibility with its particular kind of anatomic possibility. But our postulate system contains no postulate restricting us to such a line of thought. The important point, granting such a restriction, is the process by which the pertinent neurone paths are selected: and we know, or at least have good reason to surmise, that this is chemical in part.</page><page sequence="41">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 249 to bring it together and expand it a bit. The system which Freud calls the Pes. is undoubtedly based on a neuro-muscular system having at its service a store of memories of the visual and auditory sort, among others. It can be said to have wishes in the ordinary sense of the words. This structure, in 1900, is a very vague variable. Subsequent developments in the history of psychoanalysis gave it a fairly definite meaning. In some part at least the secondary system is constituted by, or contains as an essential part, the Super-ego. The question arises, is the Pes. the creation of precipitated psycho logical experience and only this, or was there a pre-existing rudi mentary something which was molded by experience into the super-ego? It is an open question still under investigation, and the answer to it is not immediately relevent to our problem.41 Above we have posed the question of whether the second system was not the result of the overflow of 'unbound' energy from the unsatisfied wishes of the first system. This could be called 'defused' instinctual energy. Granting this hypothesis we could then by one line of thought regard the primary and secondary systems as dif fering only in their temporal status, as being an early and a later 41. We have at birth a complete set-up of the whole picture we are discussing. It is in the respiratory system or mechanism. The primary system corresponds to the foetal circulatory system which breathes by way of the mother's lungs through the intermediary of her circulatory system: the secondary system to the neuro-muscular system of the foetus which is prepared and ready to take over at birth when the primary system no longer works because it has been cut away from its S and Z. A stimulus to the functioning of the secondary system is the chemical correlate of 'frustration,' i.e., an in creased H-ion concentration in the blood. This has certainly some relation even if r.o more than mere co-existence to the malaise and pain, discomfort we assume to exist at birth. Incidentally this occasion is the first major one in which the new personality actively takes over and carries on by means of its own motility a function previously performed by the mother of which it was the passive beneficiary. We have then the prototype of introjection of the lost object. As far back as the concept of "soul" can be traced it is associated with the word for "breath," as well as with the ghost of the dead (ancestor-father). This latter notion is presumably associated with or derived from dreams. We have reason to believe that there is some sort of a priori notion brought to bear on the idea of ghosts. Freud derived (following the anthropologists) this a priori from our repressed death wishes which return from repression in the form of guilty expectations of retaliation from the ghost of the dead. The notion of ghosts is clearly to be derived from the phenomena of visual images in our memories and dreams, and has always been so derived if we may believe the writers of antiquity. We have then in this one system, the respiratory, within the psych-somatic system, a model sufficient to justify any speculative flights we like. We could easily base some of the fears associated with death on the phenomenon of apnoea: we would simply have to show how a commonplace everyday experience gets erected into a neurotic world picture.</page><page sequence="42">250 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. manifestation along the path of development. They would then both be-- consequences of the working of the 'life-impulse,' Eros. An arrest in development in the primary stage would then lead to death and it would be possible to hypostatize a 'death instinct' to explain it. We would have only to explain the arrest. Such a line of thought seems to have been vaguely present in Freud's mind at the time of writing. This seems clearly indicated by the discussion on p. 550 et seq.42 where he develops an idea of some kind of primitive prototype of repression. What is implicit in 1900 in this general discussion becomes clear in 1911, the primary system corresponds to, or is exemplified by, the helpless struggling infant expressing its pain and frustration in random movements and outcries (the prototype of later more or less aimless aggression), the secondary system to the mother who guesses what is wrong and produces, if she can, the satisfaction desired. She also anticipates the infant's needs sometimes and acts to forestall the extreme of frustration. One could say that the ego of the sleeper gives up relations with the outer world, closes his eyes, and his continuing wishes have to be content with the visual ghosts of real objects selected for them by the Pes. The picture is analogous to that of the child crying for real satisfaction and put off by the mother's offering of a pacifying toy. But the second system is also in some part the super-ego, a tact noted in footnotes in later editions of the TD after the elucidation of the concept in the '20s. At the time of the initial composition of the book Freud was not aware that he knew anything about a super-ego. At that time little attention was paid even to guilt feeling. Possibly some dim recognition of its relation to the Oedipus complex was already in the air. But we have no reason to suppose 42. p. 551, 'hallucination maintained to point of exhaustion.' which would be the extreme manifestation of the pleasure principle, could never have been realized in actuality, as Freud points out in 1911 in a footnote to the Two Principles. As he might have said, taken alone it is a self-contradiction and therefore could never have come into being. It is interesting that in this footnote he goes on to compare implicitly the Une. to the small infant and the Pes. to the mother. Louise Karpinska in the following year in an essay published in the Inter. Zeit. Psa. II, 1914: 'Uber die psychologischen Grundlagen des Freudismus' points out that such an apparatus as Freud assumes could never have come into existence at all, since the kind of hallucinatory experience Freud postulates could never actually have existed. She would substitute as the primitively given manner of functioning the urge to projection of our psychic state.</page><page sequence="43">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 251 that Freud had in 1900 any inkling that there was any relation whatsoever between the content of the Oedipus complex and the dreams deriving from it as discussed in the early part of the book, and the Pes. as a structure in the psyche as discussed in the last section. But we do find Freud describing very clearly activities of the Pes. in terms which were later allocated to the super-ego. So, while the Pes. is in some respects comparable to the mother, it is also the father. To see this we have only to paraphrase the incest prohibition thus: it is father who says: 'You may look at mother and listen to her but you may not have her.' All this is precisely the function of the dream that Freud is trying to account for. The Pes. exercises the function of selecting the material which the wish from the Une. shall cathect. It gives Ât a visual memory image, but one of such sort that the rest of the organism can remain undisturbed. If this does not work and does not suffice, then the Pes. can wake up the Ego and real satisfaction may be had by re course to motility. Here again we can draw a parallel to the family set-up. If the Pes. is the mother handing out the pacifying toy, the ego which is waked up to produce the real satisfaction is also the father. We need only recall, to justify this comparison, that the ego is itself in some respects considered to be based on identifica tion with the parents. Now all this is very confused and confusing in the theory as stated in the past and I am not here concerned to make it any less so. Some of the confusion lies in the situation which is and was being described, some of it lies in the manner of description,—a point I am trying to bring out. If I sharpen it a bit in so doing, so much the better. The analyst in the analytic situation with a patient uses words in a critical way as a tool fitted to the occasion. That is the profession for which he was trained. When, however, he comes to the subsequent description of what he has done, that is something else again and the analyst is no better than he should be. But more to the point is that this kind of behavior can be and often is just another expression of what I am describing as the death instinct, an activity divorced from the context in which it must live. But to come back to our attempt to pick out of the history of psychoanalytic theorizing some of the obvious things which I do not believe have been previously sufficiently clearly stated.</page><page sequence="44">252 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. Looking back over this history it seems clear today that Freud was working with an implicit, and hence unconscious, set of concepts and propositions which later flowered as the body of no tions we now connote with the words 'identification,' 'introjec tion,' etc. The objection is natural that such comparisons as the above between the structure of the psyche and the family structure (some are mine, some Freud's) are mere figures of speech, the use of which is inevitable in attempts to conceive what has never yet been clearly conceived. Figures of speech they certainly are, only we would not decry them by the use of the word 'mere.' They reflect a process analogous to, and in the sense of our thesis identical with, extensions to a higher level of a process of organic differentiation clearly to be seen on lower levels. We contend that Freud was form ulating the psychological extension of the quite general process of invaginating the S and Z. As we saw above, this is one process com prised within the SS tendency. Just as lower in the scale of structural differentiation the organism incorporates a bit of the external world to form the lungs or the gastro-intestinal tract, so on the higher levels of psychological differentiation the organism in the course of its ontogeny incorporates as some kind of structural something that part of the external world represented by the struc ture and functions of the family during infancy. Such incorporation, psychologically considered, is the result of identifications. Its ana tomical basis, if any, we have no way of guessing at present. All we can say about it is that the whole process is one manifestation of Eros, and this is merely to give it a name, in terms of a theory. We have not finished with our description of what Freud did. He started with an abstraction, a 'fiction' patterned after anatomico physiological models, and it must be borne in mind that I am talk ing throughout about his writings, not what he may have done or thought while doing it, but of what he afterwards said he had done. By the process of giving various concrete interpretations to the variables in his abstraction (sometimes these were called figures Of speech) he finally arrived back at the concrete material or proto typical situation from which the abstraction had been quite un consciously derived. It was a process of rediscovery. Thus the historical development and evolution of the theory of psycho analysis itself reveals in its gradual evolution the same transitional stages we traverse in analysing a patient, from the distorted dériva</page><page sequence="45">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 253 tives of the repressed to the repressed itself. Consideration tells us that the process I have been describing seems exactly comparable to that described in Homburger's girl 'B'43 who pictured certain ele ments of a historic event in her body posture and in turn translated the whole back into a configuration of toys and blocks in the ex ternal world. And it is in connection with the becoming self-con scious of this sort of process that analysts have used the words re discovery of a repressed content.' Clearly there remains much for psychoanalysis to say even about this most basic of its materials. We shall not attempt this task here. For us it is only important to notice the parallelisms between the process of rediscovering the concrete materials from which an intellectual abstraction was derived and the rediscovery of the meaning of a repression. Freud started with an abstraction which is an ideal structure from which the accidental and individual has been eliminated. It is like a geometrical concept such as a triangle which is com posed of ideal points and lines. Such things cannot exist in reality. They are fictions. Just so, if we attempt to find in any actual person anything corresponding exactly to Freud's 'fiction,' we would find a concrete exemplification which would depart in many respects from the ideal. Therapeutically we have to deal with the concrete reality; in theorizing we try to deal with the abstraction which has eliminated what was individual and uniquely concrete and palpable. This is an old story and the only point in iterating it is to bring out that this is exactly what repression does for the individual, it creates an abstraction. As Freud puts it44: "... this is the key to the theory of repression . . . that the second system can only cathect an idea when it is in a position to inhibit any pain emanating from this idea." The technique of the formation of the manifest content of a dream (or a theory) shows something of how this is done. Things, a substance, are given up for their visual and auditory ghosts. It is a kind of substitution of a part for a whole, — a manner of condensation, so to speak. If we consider the real meaning of the phrase 'failure of repression' and 'return of the repressed,' is it not the coming back into the representation of an abstraction of a hitherto successfully eliminated particular and singular reference? Is it not that partial recall is succeeded by total recall? An abstrac 43. "Configurations in Play," Psa. Quart. VI. April, 1937, p. 142. 44. p. 553 TD italics in original.</page><page sequence="46">254 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. tion, — some word, let us say, — reminds the patient of a painful trauma which was a particular concrete reality. The result of "fail ure of repression" is that even the abstraction may have to be avoided in the future. Now of what does this 'reminder' consist, psycho logically considered, except of memories of additional concrete sensory material, tactile, kinesthetic, olfactory, etc. ?45 A dream con sists of a retrograde reactivation of the perceptual apparatus (or perhaps only of a memory with hallucinatory vividness), but only of the least purely subjective part of it, the visual representative portion. If this process is successful it means that there is no failure of repression. But if for some reason it breaks down we have a return of the repressed and a renewed fight to re-establish the former stage of repression. This is the essence of a neurosis, or a neurotic breakdown. But it is also what we attempt to do in the analytic treatment itself: establish a return of the repressed but with the elimination of that which was dangerous, its isolating effect. We do this by making use of the 'transference situation,' which in terms of our thesis can be characterized as the successful working through and elaboration of a substitute situation. A new concrete situation has replaced the old one on which the given abstraction was based. Our interest in this old familiar story is in its relation to something that might be called a death instinct. We can say: abstractions, like repressions, kill individuality, are only possible at the expense of individuality. And this is true not only as a purely intellectual abstraction but as a matter of conscious feeling. What is uniquely our own, has no scientific value. It is a private value, not a public one, to speak in terms of contemporary discussion in the world of scientific philosophy. We have been dealing in this paper with a set of printed words which constitute Freud's hypothetico-deductive system. We have taken them as unspecified variables to which we have given various concrete verbal interpretations for the sake of deducing the con sequences in the way of further propositions. We have tried to show that the creation of this theory is the creation of a tool which has the aim of reaching a highly abstract conception of something we can only know and experience as a concrete and in the main wholly 45. Ferenczi brought out this point very clearly in his essay on "Obscene Words" published in 1911 in Zentreabl. f. Psy. Jahrg. I, also in Contributions to Psa., Boston, 1916.</page><page sequence="47">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 255 personal something. It is the purpose of the user of such a tool to eliminate the purely personal and individual, which are isolated and unique, in favor of the general and abstract. With such a tool we propose to represent things not in terms of spoken words as does the super-ego, but in visual terms, like the Pes. in the process of constructing a dream. We have been trying to describe the invention of a tool that works in our conscious waking life in very much the same fashion as does the Pes. in our dreaming. We can in consequence call this tool the externalization and embodiment of our Pes. The tool, the hypothetico-deductive system, has many of the functions of a super-ego. We use it to check and guide our impulses, to prevent ourselves from self-deception and its attendant dangers. We use it to protect ourselves against intellectual sins. We cling to it in moments of danger or of anxiety when confronted with terrifying intellectual events. In moments of loss, when the world of reality fails to provide us with the object that satisfies our want and stills our anxiety, we use our theory to provide a sub stitute. It is an instrument for analysing and sampling the world in which we live. This instrument cannot work with what is strictly individual and unique, but only with the collective and general features that things have in common. All this is obvious and commonplace to those who work with the theories of the physical sciences. It is equally true of the theories of the sciences that deal with the psychology of the individual person. Such a theory has the aim of eliminating the purely individual and unique. The intrusion of these into the picture spoil the theory as an effective instrument. We set out to find among other things where in the theory the death instinct was hidden. Have we found it? We are reminded of the discovery that Poe credits to Dupin that often the hardest thing to find on a map is the biggest thing in it. But we have also had another purpose in mind in thus summarizing at length such old familiar material. We have tried in this way to demonstrate the analogies between the structure of the infant's social milieu and the structure of the psyche as worked out by Freud, and to show how these found representation in his theory. Our conten tion has been that Freud was investigating the psychological aspects of a biological tendency to incorporate significant portions of the milieu, and the written record of his theorizing constitutes in its</page><page sequence="48">256 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. turn an objectificarion in large measure of that which had previously been incorporated into the human psyche. This objectification of one man's thinking becomes for those who follow in his steps a highly significant modification in their S and Z which is thus permanently altered from its primitive state. The obvious psychological purpose of such alteration of the self and the milieu, whether considered on the level of morphological development or of spiritual growth, is acquisition of mastery of the milieu and self-preservation. To revert to our mathematical terminology, Freud was studying one type of invariance under transformation. Our problem has been to discover what, if anything in all this, could be called a manifesta tion of a death instinct. We have found several things that looked suggestive. We repeatedly found a tendency that could, if carried out to an ex treme, result in the death of the individual. This is the consequence of the tendency to gain autonomy. This tendency we have seen as a function or result of dreaming, as the form of behavior called narcissism, again in the formation of the superego and other types of introjection of the object, in the tendency to substitute theory for practice, in the tendency of'theory to eliminate the unique and individual in favor of the general. In general, in any form of dealing with illusion in place of reality. But ... is it ever possible for things to go to such extremes? To affirm this question has seemed like declaring that a self-contradiction can exist. Since the days of Aristotle this latter situation has been held to be impossible. Since in practice it is never possible to deal with the whole of any actuality, we are accustomed to make use of the makeshift af forded us by the technique of logic and theory construction. We construct a deductive theory of the actual state of affairs. According as our theory approximates to our ideal of such a theory we expect to be able to ask of it all possible questions and obtain the answers by mere mechanical manipulation of our symbols. If our manipula tions have been carried out correctly we expect that the answer we have obtained in our theory will tell us of the state of affairs in actuality where we can there demonstrate it. This is the ideal. A theory should be both consistent and complete. It should give us all the answers and a definite positive or negative answer. Only a few such theories are known to exist and these are of a very elementary sort consisting 'of a simple logical</page><page sequence="49">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 257 structure and a modest stock of concepts.'46 The classical theory of elementary geometry conforms to this ideal. The theory of arithmetic does not. It has been shown by the Austrian logician, Gödel, that it is possible to ask questions in the latter theory that cannot be answered either 'yes' or 'no.' It has also been shown that it will never be possible to construct a theory (of arithmetic) that will be consistent and complete in itself. It will always need to be embedded in a larger theory and so on without end. These results have been extended to other types of deductive theory. Whether they apply to such a theory as we have been considering will be de termined only when that theory has reached a stage of rigor far beyond anything yet attained. But it is not required that the life and death instincts be contradictories, only that they be opposed, like the colors black and white, for instance. And life is everywhere pervaded by such op positions. Such familiar oppositions, however, Freud obviously did not choose to consider manifestations of life and death instincts. But is it so obvious? In 'Civilization and Its Discontents' he returned to the struggle with his theory. One point there (p. 101-2) interests us in view of our preceding discovery of an apparent oversight in constructing his fiction. He sums up the matter of the death instinct by saying that due to the assumption of its existence being based primarily on theoretical grounds, it is open to attack on the same grounds. And lays aside the matter for future consideration. He then goes on to remark that the remainder of his discussion is based on the assumption of an innate aggressive disposition in man directed at culture. This disposition is a derivative and main representative of the Death Instinct. This assumption seems to provide us the opportunity to bring this long rambling consideration to a close by making it possible to answer one of the questions we raised in the beginning: was not the theorem of the death instinct already implicit in his initial theory? Our answer is yes and the argument would develop the consequences of the oversight in the Interpretation of Dreams above-mentioned. Thus: If we assume that at the base of every dream there is a wish motivated by a vital need, and if the Freudian analysis of the structure of a dream is correct, it would then seem 46. Alfred Tatski: Introduction to Logic. Oxford, 1941, p. 137.</page><page sequence="50">258 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. to follow that the more nearly complete the wish-fulfillment provided by the dream, the more fatal will be the consequences, since the visual ghost of an object cannot adequately replace the real ob:ect required. By so much as the dream object is inadequate, by that much will the vital need continue. And, as Freud went on to show, this surplus of instinctual energy will go on to bring about further activity on the part of the organism. Our train of thought would equate this "surplus of energy" with the term "aggression." We would say it is the kind of energy we call ag gressive.47 Freud goes on to point out that this surplus energy induces the organism to bring about a wish fulfillment by establishing an identity of perception by the detour through reality. In other words, the simulacrum not satisfying, the organism tries to get the real object. Now we come to the real point. What object does the organism go after? The object that is manifestly dreamt about, or the object required by the latent thoughts? We must remember that the dream is a disguised wish-fulfillment. Our argument would con tinue and answer the question thus: it would be the object manifest ly dreamt about. Such objects are given us in our culture for the most part, which itself is largely the creation of other men's dream ing.48 According as these objects approximate to those predicated by the dream, by just that much will they in turn fail to produce ultimate satisfaction, and like the object in the dream will give rise to tendencies which will strive to set them aside or destroy them. And along with them that part of culture that is constituted by such objects and supports them. Not the whole of culture is the result of dreamlike thinking and striving: that also we may assume. In short, man has to destroy a good deal of his past in order to achieve his future. If as above we wish to call this tendency to 47. There is physiological evidence, at least, that justifies such usage of words. One could cite here the discoveries made by Cannon as to the role of adrenin in the behavioristic economy of the organism. Cf. 'Fear, Hunger and Rage.' 48. That culture (civilization) is largely the product of man's ef forts to realize his dreams, is a long-accepted truism. Nevertheless the poet's in sight has received some substantiation by the investigations of psychoanalysis. Much material to this effect can be found in Rank's books, in particular "Seelenglaube und Psychologie," Vienna, 1930. Cf. also 'The Dream in Primitive Culture' by Lincoln, Baltimore, 1935. In particular his introductory historical review. I believe it follows anyway as a consequence from the argu ments of this essay.</page><page sequence="51">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 259 achieve real satisfaction 'aggression,' then we have reached the same conclusion as that just cited from Freud. The more of this kind of civilization we have, the more aggression we must of necessity develop, an aggression which will be directed at destroying this sort of impoverishing culture. But why call this a death instinct? It is again not difficult to find a train of thought which supports this usage. Man created his culture for his protection and sustenance, just as he created his super-ego to replace a bygone period of infancy. When the time comes to replace this outworn and hampering institution, the im pulse which has this aim looks to the individual sometimes like an impulse to destroy himself, by destroying that which he has come to believe keeps him going. To understand the many kinds of feel ings occuring to the individuals involved in sucn a situation one need consider only the play and crossplay of identifications. Using words in this way we can say that the death instinct is a necessary consequence of the life instinct, Eros. Our theory began with a life-impulse in an individual who is opposed and sustained by the milieu given by Nature. Death was the accidental consequence of unfavorable changes in this milieu, changes for which even the most adaptable individual could not compensate. We end apparently with two opposed impulses in the individual which can be called life-death instincts. And what was originally apparently an accident, has now become a self-imposed necessity. This is a consequence of the fact that while man is still a member of a diad (man vs. outer world), the outer world for man as we know him represents in addition a projected aspect of himself, and it is man's relation to this aspect of the outer world which has given rise to the appearance of an internalized death instinct. We have tried to show how this could come about by bringing together some relevant materials taken from the scattered results of other men's investigations, psychological and biological. RESTATEMENT AND RETROSPECT Having followed our train of thought as far as now seems feasible (there is obviously no definite end point) a retrospect shows that our purpose has not been as clearly and consistently followed as could have been desired. A restatement with the aim of tying the whole together seems in order.</page><page sequence="52">260 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. We set out to explore the background of presuppositions and assumptions that form the intellectual background of any such theoretical endeavor as an attempt to formulate a scientific theory, in particular that of psychoanalysis. Our aim was not only to look into those assumptions which were more or less explicitly stated by Freud in the beginning or as time went on but also, and more important, some of those that were tacitly taken for granted as being so obvious they needed no statement.49 Based on Freud's own attitude our assumption was that some where in these stated or hitherto unstated assumptions lay the secret of the mysterious Death Instinct. For ourselves we are convinced that we found the point at which an oversight was com mitted in the very beginning, the point at which arose the 'non erotic aggression' of which Freud was finally and reluctantly forced to admit the existence many years after it had been seen by some of his colleagues. To understand this event properly would involve an investigation of historical and personality materials in 49. We do not persuade ourselves that we have exhausted the topic of tacit assumptions. One important one that we did not find occasion to look into although it presumably has some bearing on our search can be stated thus: Thought, action and feeling at any given moment form a unity in which they are each appropriate to the other two. Given one the other two may be inferred. This assumption was called attention to by Dr. John A. Abbott in his paper (unpublished) at the Cincinnati meeting, Dec. 1940 of the American Psycho pathological Society. While this assumption may be true in the very beginning, that it ceases to be true as applied to conscious contents and observable behavior istic phenomena as it is applied in popular psychology is one of the unnoticed implications of the theory of repression. Popular misunderstanding of dreams is due to the continued application of this assumption to the manifest content of the dream and the accompanying emotions. The point of Freud's discoveries of the meaning of dreams was that the emotions were appropriate to the latent contents, not to the manifest ones. It is the continued application of this misunderstanding that gives rise to the death instinct in the ways we have described in our final paragraphs. The assumption in question is true of any individual's behavior up to a certain age. Beyond that age his behavior falls into two series of activities, those of which he is conscious and those of which he can become conscious under certain conditions. For example if we sit and listen to a person talk, we can easily become aware of the fact that the content of what he is saying forms one line we can follow, and that irrespective of this there is another simultaneous line we can follow: the talking itself, regardless of its content, is an act of behavior having purposes and reacting to factors that may not at all appear in the content of the talk. Either line of activity will give rise to manifestation of feelings of frustration, gratification or what not that to the person who perceives the feeling, whether speaker or hearer, will not "bear earmarks of their origin. All this is normal psychology. The manner in which any given individual disposes of his unwanted emotions will provide the phenomena which we call neurotic in some individuals.</page><page sequence="53">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 261 accessible to us. For the purpose of this paper we found a provi sional but sufficient reason for this oversight. It could be illustrated at least by the fact that Freud first defined the dream as a wish fulfillment, a statement he was later forced to amend to: attempted wish fulfillment. We started from the assumption that all forms of human behavior of whatever sort would show some things in common, that such common characteristic features would also be found in such forms of behavior as constructing a system of thought. We made the further assumption that if one took the system of thought constructed by psychoanalysis, a system of thought that purports to be a description of human behavior of any sort, that it would also apply to itself. We noticed that this circularity gave rise to very difficult logical problems which we decided to ignore, after raising the question that perhaps our search for a something that could be called a death instinct as opposed to a life instinct might lie in this circularity. Some support was given to this suggestion by the fact that the death instinct concept was discovered after and presumably as a consequence of the discovery of the concept of narcissism. For this suggestion we found additional support in the ancient myth itself. Taking several different instances of intellectual activity we tried to trace out a common pattern in each. Thus we considered: a description of what logic and mathematics does and of how it proceeds, a description of a bit of biological behavior taken to be fundamental, and the account of how Freud constructed his basic theory of psychoanalysis as well as the content of what that theory is about. All four examples seemed to come to the same thing, to exhibit a common pattern or structural relationship to its milieu. Given a rudimentary form under certain conditions it persists in its relation to a matrix, which relative to the form can be con sidered chaotic, although from other standpoints it itself may have form. The given form can only achieve actuality and continued existence (otherwise it remains a mere potentiality, a 'fiction') by virtue of an interchange of substances with this matrix. The word 'substances' here must be taken very broadly to apply not only to chemical substances but also those aspects of the phenomenon ological world that are called "formal relationships." With this extension of meaning and considered abstractly the same types of</page><page sequence="54">262 GEORGE B. WILBUR, M. D. phenomena can be found repeated on the logical, and the psycho logical planes as occur on the biological and physico-chemical. The form has 'life' and persists if the possibility of interchange exists and goes on. Otherwise it 'dies,' ceases to exist. The important ques tion arising in connection with the concept of a death instinct was: does the form itself do anything that breaks off its relation to the matrix? And does this hypothetical something arise from the very process of living? On the psychological plane we found an answer, Yes. We asserted the existence of, but did not because we could not, account for the existence of such a tendency in what we called the tendency to achieve autonomy and self-sufficiency. It is a tendency which presents the appearance of having the aim of doing away with the necessary relation to the original matrix. We saw reason to believe that this tendency goes further: it (or the person liaving the tendency) attempts to substitute a new matrix for the original one, a matrix it itself creates in its own image. In the end we saw that in this last fact lies the death instinct since such an activity if successful and to the degree that it approximates to success is death-dealing in that it eliminates the necessary relation ship to the original matrix. On the psychological plane arising out of the crossplay of identification we saw indications for the inclina tion to call such a tendency a Death Instinct. One reason, at least, for such an inclination we discovered by extending to the psycho logical plane Alsberg's dictum as to the principle of human evolu tion. These indications are capable of considerable expansion as is perhaps obvious enough. In any case they would need to be made elsewhere. We believe that this is only a development and restatement of the implication contained in a hypothesis with which Freud started in the beginning. This was the only definite point we set out to prove. Freud inferred the death instinct from a restatement of the basic stability principle. This restatement gave up the stress on the pleasure-pain aspect and placed it on another hitherto unattended one "the tendency to reinstate a former condition." That both aspects were simply different aspects of one and the same principle we were able to show if we have given a valid «interpretation of the stability principle in terms of the modern biological concept of the tendency to maintain a steady state, Cannon's homostasis -principle is what Freud called the repetition compulsion.</page><page sequence="55">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 263 Incidental to our general course we found occasion to review in preliminary summary fashion some interesting facts about psychoanalytic findings which we believe are capable of being re duced to a kind of mathematical theory of invariance under trans formation. For instance, Freud showed how the Oedipus situation is reflected in the tripartite structure of the personality by some process that can be called introjection and how this reflection is again projected onto the content of the theory and as we noticed also, is reflected in the relation of the thinker to his theory. Thus baldly stated it seems a commonplace, but it is our feeling that this point of view is capable of considerable development and expansion along hitherto unconsidered lines.50 To do so will involve a kind of think ing in terms of abstractions which so far psychoanalysts seem to have felt inclined to avoid. A theme we did not develop was that neglecting transitional and intermediate types, the world of men and the ideologies they originate can be divided into the solipsists and the passive de pendents, those for whom the center from which all things stem can be called their egos, and those who consider their egos ap pendages to some greater whole external to themselves. It probably would take no great ingenuity to show that corresponding to these two types of men are two sorts of 'complex,' the castration complex and the death complex. They would seem to bear a reciprocal relationship to each other. But we abstain from further pursuit of what seems a will-o the-wisp. And is this not after all the point we are really trying to make in this essay? Perhaps now we can state it. To the eye of the discerning psychoanalyist it will be clear that such an effort as this essay is an effort to state something that for the writer, at least, has never previously been stated and has not yet been satisfactorily stated even to himself. It is an effort to work out a 50. Freud himself indicates some of the possibilities in this direction in his final remarks in "Moses" where he speaks of the importance for man kind of having turned away from the sensory elements in life as associated with mother to the 'spiritual' as represented by the 'so-called higher intellectual processes . . . that is to say, in favor of memories, reflection, and deduction. An example of this would be the deduction that paternity is more important than maternity, although the former cannot be proved by the senses as the latter can' (p. 185). When this process which occurs in the individual is translated to the group as in religious phenomena we can say man substitutes a theory for his father.

D. theory of a frequently occuring situation, but this effort itself is an example of the very sort of situation that one is attempting to talk about. Perhaps, after all by turning our attention self-consciously to what we are trying to state we can bring out the point? The writer clearly has the feeling of not having stated what he was trying to state. Whence arises this feeling? In part at least, from his self-conscious retrospect over what he has said. He has the feeling that somehow he has not gained the response that would give the feeling of satisfaction. Response from whom? And how would he know it is a satisfactory response? What would constitute a satisfactory response? In part these questions can be answered in terms of the theory of the super-ego. But the situation seems to call for a more extensive or more general theory than that usually associated with the con cept of the super-ego. Such a sort of behavior as we are considering is a debate between a real person and a phantasied audience who is again in actuality the real person in question. It is a debate between the Ego and the Other, both residing in or being different partitionings of the same psyche. To be sure the Other is given a sort of fictitious external existence by being momentarily represented in terms of this, that or some other real opponent remembered out of the past. In other words such an essay as this could be broken down into fragmentary bits exactly as one does the details in the manifest content of the dream and analysed in equivalent ways, probably to produce cor responding results. We need not go into that. Our point is this: the writer has abstracted something from the real world, certain components from a situation that can and has occurred often. With these he is trying to carry on as if he were still in contact with the real situation. This is in anticipation of the fact that he is going to have readers, they are going to respond in one way or another, favorably or otherwise. If they were actually present here and now and the writer could judge from his observation of their behavior where and why his points were failing to get across and could modify his own endeavors in accordance only then could he obtain teal satisfaction. This being obviously not possible some substitute satisfaction must be found. What? How? Questions of literary proficiency take up some of the slack.</page><page sequence="57">FREUD'S LIFE-DEATH INSTINCT THEORY 265 It is a hackneyed observation among writers that what they write has a will of its own. It goes places they had no thought of going themselves. It becomes a separate personality with whom one can become so immersed in conflict that the outer world ceases to exist. Is it possible to force this fictitious personality to return a gratifying response so that one can cease his labors and turn to other things? By what processes does it attain a will of its own? Part of the answer is evident enough. This 'fictitious personality' is made up of words and sentences. Words are public, social proper ties which the writer has tried to appropriate for his own private use. If he were to succeed in so exploiting words they would lose some, at least, of the value that made it desirable to appropriate them in the first place. They would cease to be a means of communi cation with and influencing the real personalities hidden behind the 'fictitious personality' represented in the writing. Perhaps we have followed this line of thought, which after all is not novel, far enough to indicate the presence of phenomena that Freud wanted to call evidence of the 'Death Instinct.' We see in any case the presence of the same situation that arises in the dream and which gives rise to that surplus of energy we call aggression. We believe that even the non-analytically trained reader, if any there be, can see for themselves how behavior which was originally directed at an external conflict becomes turned in on the self and directed at an inner replica of this same sort of conflict and that by this process there is no possible end point. And that this phenomenon on the psychological plane corresponds point for point to that described on lower planes of organic behavior, biological and physico-chemical. But wait . . . would not such an end point be death? The death of what? That would clearly be relative to what one identified with. It would depend on how one partitioned the world (inner and outer) into ego and non-ego. If these questions can be answered in detail it will have to be elsewhere, on some other occasion. Which is to say that at this point it is necessary to return to the outer world for something with which to carry on.</page></plain_text>
