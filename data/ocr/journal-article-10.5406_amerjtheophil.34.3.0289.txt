Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. 288 pp. $24.95, paper.  (Reviewed by Jerome P. Soneson, University of Northern Iowa). The violence of 9/11 and its aftermath have raised in a new way the question  of the role of religion in the contemporary world. It has given urgent meaning  to the “new atheists,” such as Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris,  and Christopher Hitchens, all of whom have argued flatly, as Hitchens put it,  that “religion poisons everything.” Some of the power of their position comes  from their deep commitment to science, as practiced in the university, and the  sharp contrast they make between the methods and knowledge of science and  the absolute and dogmatic perspectives of religious traditions which generate  intolerance, fanaticism, and violence. As they accurately point out, 9/11 is only  the most recent event in the long history of violence perpetrated by religious  persons in the West. And unlike many thoughtful persons of faith, they have  argued persuasively that this violence does not belong to apostates who rep- resent an aberration of religion (which, in essence, is actually peaceful), but  that it emerges naturally out of the exclusivism that marks the very essence of  religion. The unique contribution that John Teehan’s book makes is that, while  he shares the “new atheists’” view of science and their claim that violence is  inherent in the logic of religion, he also recognizes that religion is not going  to wither away but is here to stay. Furthermore, he is able to show the extraor- dinarily positive contributions religion makes and, even more importantly, he  offers a compelling pragmatic proposal about how we might move forward to  enlarge the positive contributions of religion, while minimizing its intolerant  and destructive tendencies.  Most of Teehan’s text is an attempt to clarify how and why religion is mor- ally ambiguous. In the first chapter, he examines the origin and functions of  morality. He does this by organizing and explaining the result of current work  in cognitive psychology and evolutionary studies of the brain that have exam- ined moral development. He appeals to the principle of evolution, namely, the  idea that the current human gene pool includes those genes from early humans  that functioned to promote action protecting the survival and reproduction of  those genes. This includes genes relevant to the physiology of the brain, with  its capacities for perception, belief, emotions, aims and so on, just as much  those that give shape to muscle and organ and bone structure. This has implica- tions for moral behavior, for it means that human brains today embody what  Teehan calls “a universal template” shaped by evolution in moral contexts of  </page> <page sequence="2"> 290 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy the past. This template in turn shapes deep and fundamental human emotions  and intuitions in new moral contexts, powerfully influencing interpretation  of what is happening and how best to respond. This, of course, raises issues  of  genetic determinism and the role of  culture, and Teehan addresses these  matters, showing how human creativity has given specific cultural content to  this template. But in spite of the variety of cultures, he argues that all moral  systems have a similar structure (or grammar) due to the underlying template.  For example, the most powerful moral impulse humans have, no matter the  culture, is to nurture and protect their offspring, those who carry on their  genetic stock; this is called “kin selection,” the protection of family. The next  level of moral concern, direct altruism, is characteristic of small groups that  include but go beyond the family, groups of  persons who know each other  well; in such groups, assistance is expected to be reciprocal—I’ll help you and  yours if  you help me and mine—and if  reciprocity is not forthcoming, one is  considered a cheater and exploiter and is subject to punishment.  At both of these deepest levels of  moral intuition, Teehan argues, we see  moral ambiguity arising, since these moral structures create a divide between  an in-group and an out-group, those worthy of moral concern and those who  are not. Human history is in part the story of the gradual increase in size of the  in-group, but this has its own problem, for the larger the in-group, the easier it  is to cheat and so the more tenuous is the altruistic impulse and action. He calls  this the “problem of extension,” and solving this problem within larger societies  becomes one of the key functions of religion. Teehan, therefore, turns to the topic  of religion in his second chapter, and he argues that belief in the gods emerges  naturally out of the human attempt to interpret the environment, due in part  to the natural human propensity to project anthropomorphic pictures onto the  seemingly important but under-defined aspects of the natural environment. These  gods fall within the category of “persons,” since they are taken to have emotions,  desires, aims, just like other persons; nevertheless, their divinity lies in the fact  that they are taken to have special and unique powers unlike normal human  persons, such as invisibility and the ability to grasp the innermost thoughts and  feelings of others. Furthermore, since they are “persons with special powers”  who seem to have a stake in the persons of one’s group, they come to be seen as  moral agents, like other members of the group, but as having the unique power  to reward good behavior and to detect and punish those who take advantage of  others’ good will. This vision of the gods, Teehan argues, in many ways solves  the problem of extension, since it keeps people who belong to increasingly larger  groups in line by reinforcing the idea that genuinely bad things will happen if   one does not act in altruistic ways toward others. </page> <page sequence="3">  Volume 34, No. 3, September 2013 291  Unfortunately, while helpful to maintain stability within larger societies, the  development of such religious ideas does not overcome the in-group/out-group  problem inherent in our intrinsic moral grammar. In fact, it intensifies it, since  those who do not belong to the in-group are now seen not only as “other” but  as “evil.” By living outside of the fold, and so failing to share its beliefs, these  others get in the way of the moral purposes and aims of the gods. So, while  belief  in the gods reinforces altruistic behavior within a very large community,  it also, at the very same time, promotes suspicion, hatred and violence against  those in the out-group. Indeed, this dynamic does not change even with the  development of monotheism in the West. Even though Christianity and Islam  claim to be universal, that is to say, good for all, the “all” of  “good for all”  turns out to be only those who agree with the aims and purposes of the group’s  good God. Disagreement with these divine and moral purposes, consequently,  constitutes evil.  In Chapters 3 and 4, Teehan does an excellent job of identifying this dualistic  and ambiguous in-group/out-group pattern in Judaism and Christianity, with  all its positive consequences for group cohesion and social stability, on the one  hand, and for out-group hatred and violence, on the other. And he does this by  looking at the texts—the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament. One  of his points, of course, is that this dynamic is an intrinsic part of morality in  religion, not to be dismissed as a mere aberration of misled persons. The very  thing that promotes social well-being at one and the same time encourages  hatred and violence against those who don’t share the same religious world  view. In Chapter 5, Teehan shows in particular how violence has emerged in  Judaism and Christianity, and he concludes the chapter by identifying this  same dynamic in the rhetoric of the terrorists of 9/11 and in Bush’s response  with his War on Terrorism.  So, if  religion is here to stay, and if  it naturally perpetuates this in-group/ out-group dynamic with all its destructive consequences, what hope do we have  for the future? Teehan does offer us hope, and that hope comes in the form  of Dewey’s pragmatic moral method. While recognizing the impossibility of  transcending the in-group/out-group problem, we can mitigate it, he claims,  by recognizing the historical and therefore contingent nature of  our values  and beliefs (undercutting certainty and absolutism), by recognizing that we in  fact belong to many different in-groups (an affirmation of pluralism), and by  taking seriously the fundamental functions of morality and religion, namely,  that they stabilize communities and enhance individual flourishing by offering  opportunities to do good (a form of religious humanism). These attitudes, he  claims, free us to use our critical and creative reasoning to transform established  </page> <page sequence="4"> 292 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy moral and religious beliefs so that these significant dimensions of human life  can function at their best.  In my estimation, this is a landmark book, one that will or ought to shape  current and future reflection on the conjunction of morality and religion. Tee- han not only summarizes and organizes the most important results in the social  and natural sciences, especially in cognitive psychology and evolutionary biol- ogy, that are relevant to morality and religion, but he applies them successfully  to interpret the Western religious traditions in order to make sense of both the  positive and negative consequences of religious morality. Even more impor- tantly, he offers a compelling proposal about how we might best respond to  the deepest and most dangerous aspects of that morality. One need not agree  with him on any of his conclusions to see that it will be hard to move forward  in the field of religious morality without confronting this significant text. American Pragmatism and Democratic Faith. Robert J. Lacey. DeKalb, IL:  Northern Illinois University Press, 2008. 296 pp. $45, cloth. (Reviewed by  Daniel Morris, Augustana College). Robert J. Lacey has reservations about both the philosophical roots and the  institutional legacy of American participatory democracy. In his combination  of political philosophy and intellectual history, Lacey explores several ideas  that he takes to be central to participatory democracy in America. Although  students of  pragmatism may be unsatisfied with some of Lacey’s evaluative  conclusions, this book looks at a well-worn topic with new eyes, and offers a  fresh interpretation of democratic thought in America.  The central event around which this book pivots is the 1962 meeting of  Students for a Democratic Society, which culminated in the Port Huron State- ment. For Lacey, we can understand this moment fully only if  we understand  the political commitments of philosophical pragmatism, the intellectual tradi- tion that inspired the Port Huron Statement. The historical event provides a  compelling centerpiece for Lacey’s analysis, as it shows pragmatism’s political  potential. With Port Huron at its center, his study stretches back into the past  and forward toward the present. To appreciate the intellectual roots of the SDS,  he turns to the classical pragmatists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  To assess the influence of democratic thought, he turns to contemporary politi- cal theorists who continue the struggle for participatory democracy. The first  three chapters of this book analyze the work of C.S. Peirce, William James, and  John Dewey, each of whom stand obviously within the tradition of pragmatist  </page> </plain_text>
