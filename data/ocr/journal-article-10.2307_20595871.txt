<plain_text><page sequence="1">POETRY ANOTHER NICE DAY FOR THE RACE A line of mountains hidden by clouds. A race of purple clouds at low altitude to suggest a faraway place or a race of non-human non-anthropomorphic sea-birds. One whole coast in lavender. Another burnt almond broken into by a cape that extends past a wake of white, washed houses, inverted arches, oranges, lemons, olives, almonds, oleander. The limestone cliffs end in turrets that line the neck of the valley, connecting in a breezy funicular with everything on the Marina Grande the Marina Piccola and the rows of oranges and lemons stacked up like the olives and almonds in green shadows. A path runs up the face at intervals, joining the port road with that traveled by traffic from which the trucks that make their drops there climb and move into shadow. And reading time for space this sublimest coast creaks with sunlight. I42</page></plain_text>
