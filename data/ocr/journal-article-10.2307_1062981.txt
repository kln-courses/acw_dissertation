<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Religions Bloch claims that the empirical instances which manifest his core structure are evidence for its pervasive strength in generating similar cultural forms, and then he argues that empirical cases which can only be characterized as modifications, abortive or incomplete versions (e.g., stage 1 only), divided manifestations (e.g., across different religions found in the same society), symbolic inversions, and total rejections (e.g., in mythology) of the model can also be counted as evidence for its existence. The key to this problem is his idea that the core structure is both a generative model and a "potential" symbolic pattern available to societies' strategic, contextual, and historical manipulation. An example of this difficulty can be found in Bloch's analysis of circumcision practices: in the Merina case political resistance took the shape of intensified, public circumcision (thus mark- ing their quest for an eternal kingdom of the dead), while early Christian groups rejected Jewish circumcision as unnecessary in the face of the immanent parou- sia. Even given the opposite empirical facts Bloch cites this as an example of the "coincidence of concern with circumcision . . . [that] points to a much more fun- damental similarity" (p. 94)! Despite this methodological reservation and the acknowledged selectivity of the ethnographic illustrations, I think that Bloch has done a major service for the study of religion and ritual: this exploratory essay has provided a clearly expressed hypothesis that awaits the judgment of scholars with expertise in different cultural traditions. I cannot imagine teaching my course on ritual and mythology next time without including this book as required reading. RICHARD J. PARMENTIER Brandeis University Savoir et salut: Traditions juives et tentations dualistes dans le christianisme ancien. By GEDALIAHU GUY STROUMSA. Collection Patrimoines. Paris: Les Editions du Cerf, 1992. Pp. 408. Fr 299. This collection of twenty previously published essays by G. G. Stroumsa and one coauthored with Sarah Stroumsa (all here in French; just over half originally published in English) provides new and most welcome accessibility to some important articles treating religious phenomena in the Near East, from Second Temple Judaism to Islam. Stroumsa's perspective is primarily oriented toward the comparative history of ideas. As the volume's subtitle suggests, most of the essays are especially concerned with "temptations" to dualism. The articles in part 1 are weighted toward exploration of the Jewish roots of the problems of biblical anthropo- morphism and theodicy, and relations among Jewish, Jewish-Christian, and gnostic strategies for addressing these issues. The studies in part 2 turn more squarely to "the Gnostic temptation" within the history of ancient Christianity. Parts 3 and 4 treat aspects of Manichaean dualism, from the origins of Mani's doctrine to the influence of Manichaeans on Islamic theological debates centu- ries later. 97</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In spite of a certain amount of repetition and lack of overall unity, inevitable in such a collection and conceded by the author in the preface, one can follow consistent themes and concerns: One of these is the role in Western monotheisms of "the crucial theological problem of anthropomorphism" (p. 28, cf. p. 10) and the problem of evil, the lat- ter constituting "the principal reason for a revolt against monotheism" (p. 246). These issues Stroumsa views as inherent in Western monotheisms an a perma- nent temptation to dualistic solutions (p. 194, cf. p. 184). Guided by a scholar who moves with admirable skill across an impressive range of sources from Second Temple apocalyptic to late Byzantine patristic writers, we are treated to numerous examples of those who conquered and those who succumbed to the "dualistic temptation." The latter lacked what Stroumsa calls an "exegetical ap- proach" that would take them beyond a confrontation between the literal text of scripture and philosophy (p. 190). The exegetical approach that enabled catholic Christianity to pull and hold together a new conception of truth out of very divergent traditions and ideas is contrasted with a hermeneutical stubbornness on the part of gnostic and Manichaean dualists who more typically insisted on choosing between conflicting elements in the tradition rather than fashioning a new synthesis (pp. 106-7, 175, 189-95, 345). Thus, arguing that we have no example of "dualism in the pure state" in the history of religions, Stroumsa treats the dualistic attitude as only a particular case of monotheism, a case in which certain inherent tendencies have been ex- acerbated (p. 11). The point about dualism as a category is itself interesting and is developed in subtle analyses of the "classic" case of Manichaeism (see especially the discussion on pp. 243-58 of the structure of Manichaean dual- ism). But, more broadly, Stroumsa's focus on "built-in" generative tensions within religious traditions holds some important implications for theories of religious change. The explanatory power of theories of innovation focused pri- marily or exclusively on the role of social crisis, for example, seems colorless and two-dimensional compared with the understanding that we bring away from Stroumsa's essays about specific motivations for the emergence of (and innovative responses to) dualisms from religious movements spawned by Sec- ond Temple Jewish monotheism. A second recurring theme in the volume is the significance of these dualisms in the history of Western ethical theory. Christianity's success as a world reli- gion is credited above all to the central role that it accorded ethics in religious life, a lesson that Christianity ultimately owed to Judaism but that was inter- nalized through the fierce battle with gnostic dualism (p. 12). Stroumsa argues that this emphasis on ethics was linked to a new attitude toward the self that set the stage for the emergence of the Western notion of the individual (pp. 105, 201-3). Inheriting from Judaism the notion of the createdness of the whole human being, orthodox Christian thought approached the self in terms of the integration of soul and body and the self's potential for moral change, rather than the dualistic dissolution of the soul as static self from the material body (p. 160). While agreeing with Michel Foucault that there was a major difference between pagan and Christian thinkers on the topic of the self, Stroumsa rejects as "profoundly erroneous" Foucault's impression that Chris- 98</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions tian thought focused on the renunciation of the self (pp. 202-3). Gnosticism's dualistic anthropology was a remnant of Greco-Roman culture, Stroumsa ar- gues, and accounts for its "total lack of interest in ethics" (pp. 151, cf. pp. 177-79)-though he thinks Manichaeism differed from other gnostic currents in this respect (p. 258); the Manichaean Faustus could insist that religion was solely an ethical affair (p. 346). Though these essays tend generally to be rich in sensitivity to subtleties and complexities in historical relationships, Stroumsa also has a predilection for Weberian-like typology that occasionally works against his efforts at historical nuance. Above all, his treatment of gnosticism, one of the central topics of the volume, illustrates how this decision to press typology can seriously impede rather than facilitate our understanding of religious phenomena. Gnosticism is presented to us with the usual labels: world-hating, body-hating (pp. 150, 171, 178), and therefore lacking any interest in ethics (pp. 151, 178) or social rela- tionships (p. 179), and completely isolated from society (pp. 155, 161). Stroumsa does not see how especially this last assertion, for which we have no evidence, stands in contradiction to his own observation that evidence for the eschewing of martyrdom by some gnostics indicates that they actually per- ceived themselves less in opposition to the surrounding culture than did ortho- dox Christians (pp. 172, 180). What is needed in this particular chapter in the history of religions is the dismantling of just the kind of typological caricature of gnosticism that Stroumsa has employed because the typology has now come to distract us from the historical evidence rather than truly to clarify the latter's significance. But it is hardly possible to do full justice here to twenty-one different essays representing so much thorough research and provocative analysis, and readers from several specialties can be assured that they will benefit immensely from consulting this excellent collection of studies.
