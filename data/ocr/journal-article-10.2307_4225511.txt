Neale It is a commonplace legal axiom that a person is to be held responsible for the consequences of actions when a "reasonable man" would expect those consequences. Too often has the history of the colonial empires in Africa and Asia been treated as if the metropolitan powers were the "reasonable men" of legal tradition. First, even the most reasonable of men could not have anticipated the consequences of the actions taken by the metropolitan countries or by their nationals in the colonies. Secondly, it is an anthropomorphic fallacy to think of an imperial power as if it were a person making decisions. Rather, the different experiences, inter- ests, and points of view of different groups affected the social and political processes from which imperial policies emerged. There was no single mind considering and then deciding how to act. The metropolitan coun- tries, as the governing powers in the colonies, must bear moral responsi- bility for many institutions associated with modern colonial rule, but it would not be correct say that the metropolitan countries intended from The author is Professor of Economics, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Neale the start to impose these institutions upon the colonies, that they planned to make these institutions permanent features of colonial rule, or that they anticipaed the results of their actions. Rather, these institutions emerged in the processes of an unequal but nevertheless mutual adapta- tion of the metropolitan and the colonial cultures to each other. Each adaptive act was, of course, intended-sometimes by the govern- ment of the metropolitan power; but also often by its nationals in the colonies, in the absence of instructions from, and even in defiiance of, the metropolitan country's avowed policy to the contrary. But it does not follow that the longer-term cnsequences of the acts were foreseen, nor that the colonial powers set out to create peculiarly colonial institutions. In fact, quite the opposite was true. I take as my example British Central Africa (now Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi).' It was an unusual case in a number of respects, not the least of which was the presence of a large immigrant European popula- tion and the starkly pervasive, racist, and dominant way in which they exercised power. But these are the very traits that have made it easy to argue that metropolitan countries "knew what they were doing." If it can be shown in such a case that colonial institutions evolved in unexpected ways, then, is it not likely that colonial institutions elsewhere were not intended but evolved or emerged? To argue the point I discuss three peculiarly colonial institutions that emerged in British Central Africa: Native Reserved Areas, Compounds, and Locations. None of them had precursors in Bantu institutions, and none of them existed in British culture. Rather, they were unique to colonial Africa, products of the conflict of cultures. Native Reserved Areas were large sections of land allotted to the Bantu tribes, in which the Bantu were expected to manage their own affairs, bar raiding and warfare, according to the customs of the tribes. Native Com- missioners (British civil servants) oversaw the administration of the Areas. The idea was to allow the Bantu to live as they had until they were assimilated into a "civilized, European style of life." It was a version of "indirect rule," designed to disrupt Bantu life as little as possible. Compounds were dormitory accommodations (barracks), providing room and board for the migrant Bantu laborers who worked in the mines. Locations were "townships" for Bantu families who migrated to the new European settlements and stayed to work for extended periods of time, or even for their lifetimes. How did these institutions arise? It is easy to attribute them to straight- forward exploitation. Reserved Areas were the poor lands not wanted by the Pioneers (the name the British settlers gave themselves), and so were</page><page sequence="3">Evolution of Colonial Institutions 1179 left to those Bantu not yet needed as farm workers or miners. Migrant labor was the cheapest kind of labor. Compounds were the cheapest way to manage and to provide for migrant labor. Locations were a cheap way to provide for and to control more permanent labor. These explanations are plausible. The only trouble is that they are half truths. The more ac- curate story is more complex. The British entered Central Africa with three propositions about so- ciety and about people that they regarded as obviously true: (1) that land and movables were the property of someone; (2) that any normal person would use his land, movables, and ability to work to achieve as high a material standard of living as he could; and (3) that any normal person lacking a property income would be glad to work for wages. From the first proposition it followed, in British logic, that land that was not clearly the property of particular people (those cultivating it at the moment, for instance) was the property of the "king" as "sovereign" (both European concepts). The British South Africa Company had suc- ceeded to the position of sovereign.2 There is no question that the original invasion of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) by Cecil Rhodes, S. L. Jame- son, and the Pioneers under cover of the Company was a grand "land and cattle grab." In the eastern area not much harm was done thereby to the Shona tribes since the lands the Pioneers wanted was not the land the Shona wanted. But in the west, "virtually the whole of Ndebele land and by far the greater part of Ndebele cattle passed into white hands" during the conquest.3 If the partial restitution made after the suppression of the Ndebele rebellion hardly made up for the original seizures, it does indicate the imperial policy was not designed to "grab all the land."4 It is also im- portant to note that exhuberant, violent seizure of land and cattle oc- curred only in Southern Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Nyasaland (Malawi) did not suffer these outrages and the distribution of land in those colonies approximated to London's intentions. If the insuffi- ciency of the land left to the Ndebele in the west of southern Rhodesia is to be cited as evidence of exploitative intent, then one should also account for the sufficiency of land left to the Mashona tribes in the east. In fact, the lighter, sandy soils, which the Bantu used for slash-and-burn agriculture, were left to the Bantu-reserved for the Bantu, and Native Commis- sioners were appointed to protect and guide them. From the second proposition-that normal people try to achieve a higher material standard of living-it followed that the land should be improved. If the Bantu were not improving the land-and they were not -then they should be taught and induced to do so. The areas assigned to the Bantu, and the de facto permission for Bantu to use other lands not</page><page sequence="4">1180 Walter C. Neale yet granted to Pioneers or assigned to other uses, were thus regarded as temporary expedients to allow for the Bantu to larn to manage their land more productively or to learn all those other skills and roles that a pro- gressive society needs. Thus were the Reserved Areas created; and, in fact and as late as 1915, only some of the migratory Bantu cattle herders were deprived of land that they were using, or that they particularly wanted to use. The railways were built to transport the output of the mines and the saleable produce of the land. Since the Bantu did not want to sell, this meant the railways were built through the areas occupied by the Pioneers, and to the mines. It was only later, certainly after the First World War, that the Bantu began to want to farm for sale. By 1928 Bantu in Nyasa- land (Malawi) were leasing European-owned land for cash or a share of the crop.5 Bantu in the Central Province of Nyasaland were growing to- bacco for export between the World Wars. In Northern Rhodesia the Tonga began cash-cropping in the mid-twenties.6 Sales of "surplus" out- put above family needs increased with each good season.7 Beginning in the period between the wars the population/land ratio in the Reserved Areas became so large that the Bantu system of slash-and-burn agricul- ture and extensive grazing threatened to destroy the productivity of the land reserved for the Bantu (although William G. Barber says that it was not acute in Northern Rhodesia as late as the 1950s). 8 Thus the original division of land had not been so very inequitable-given, of course, that the Pioneers were in the position of conquerors and were going to take a considerable amount of land away. Only later did the division of the land become an inequitable deprivation of the Bantu's means of livelihood. From the third proposition-that normal people would work for wages -the British derived the expectation that Bantu would come to work on the European farms; and, shortly thereafter, in the mines. After all, every- one "knew" that the offer of a wage that would enable a person to buy more would call forth a supply of willing workers. The Bantu also had propositions about society and about people. The surface of the earth was there to be used so long as it was useful-the Bantu practiced a shifting, slash-and-burn, digging-stick agriculture-and left to nature when it lost its carrying capacity. There was always vacant land. If two clans tried to occupy the same area, one or both would move off; or, where there was a powerful kingdom, the powerful would drive the weak off, very likely killing the men and carrying off the women and children. Bantu did not have a right to land. What they had was a right to farm, which they exercised by moving onto unused land.9 Where, as among the</page><page sequence="5">Evolution of Colonial Institutions 1181 Ndebele, there was a strong king, the king told his people where to farm, but it never occurred to any Bantu that the king would not assign suffi- cient areas to cultivate and to support the cattle. The Bantu said, "The king is the land and the cattle," meaning that the king's command, his assignment of land, and his giving and taking away of cattle were the laws of the land, ignored at the peril of one's life. The British translated the statement into their own cultural norms as "The land belongs to the king," which has quite different connotations, not only of rights to sell or to lease, but also of rights to evict and to withhold from use. As to whether the Bantu worked hard, their answer would have been, "Of course." Bantu men cut the brush and burned it. They hunted. They danced. They went on raiding parties, or served in the impis of the army of the king. They herded the cattle of kraal or clan, or the cattle that the king had assigned to them-in daily life it did not make much difference which. The women prepared the soil with digging sticks. They planted, tended, and harvested the grain. They made beer. And very largely, they did as they were told. The result was that Bantu did not come forward to earn wages. They knew that women, not men, cultivated the fields. They knew what goods any reasonable person would want, and they knew that hunting and danc- ing were more rewarding activities then digging in a pit. "Why on earth," they might have asked, "would anyone choose to be transsexual or a mole in order to buy a skillet?" Consider the situation from the point of view of the Pioneers. A man who will not work for wages for himself or his family, but rather hunts and dances, must be lazy or irresponsible, or both. Only ignorance or stupidity could account for the failure of Bantu to take advantage of wages and what wages would buy. No Bantu was asked, but he could have told the Pioneers that he knew how to recognize the faces of two hundred dif- ferent cows, that he could outrun most Europeans, and that he was as careful in his own affairs as the European was in his. However, that would have been beside the point: Pioneers and mining companies did not want cowherds who could run a marathon in phalanx. Civilized people work hard. Chasing an antelope is not hard work-it is an exhausting sport, but it is not hard work. At this point in the argument one must recognize that there were dif- ferences between the British at home and the British in the colonies.10 The Pioneers were British, but they were not the sort that one found in the Colonial Office or the House of Commons. People who grab a rifle to carve out a family fortune in a strange land are acutely sensitive to imme- diate cultural differences, but less sensitive to humane imperatives, and</page><page sequence="6">1182 Walter C. Neale the Pioneers needed labor badly and were willing to use compulsion if they had to. If labor, not civilizing, was first on the Pioneers' list of priori- ties, the Pioneers did think that hard, responsible work was a necessary characteristic of civilized societies. Self-interest and duty thus coincided. The British at home looked forward to a long civilizing mission.'1 They hoped, in the end, to assimilate the Bantu into a society British in every respect except the color of the skin. These British were decent people. One of this sort, of a later generation, a member of a Methodist men's club, once asked me, "Don't you agree that, next to Christianity, the Brit- ish Empire has been the greatest civilizing influence in history?" He thought that his country had been "doing good." When his forefathers sent Native Commissioners to the Rhodesias, it was to protect and to civilize the Bantu, not to exploit them. The British at home were strongly opposed to forced labor-they abhorred anything that smacked of slav- ery. J. S. Furnivall, perhaps the most percipient historian of modern colo- nial systems, has pointed out that colonial policy is only one aspect of national policy; each generation evolves its own social philosophy with no direct reference to colonial affairs, and inevitably colonial policy is framed in terms of the broad gen- eral conceptions which dominate the national outlook.... When we came to accept the principle of freedom of person, property, and trade, con- sistency required that it be extended to colonial relations. Similarly the idea of social justice that took shape in Europe during the nineteenth century permeated colonial policy.... Liberty, Social Justice, Democ- racy, if approved as sauce for the domestic goose, are served up later with the colonial gander.'2 However, between the London goose and the Rhodesian gander stood the Pioneers. A compromise emerged. London forbade forced labor but allowed a head tax payable only in money. Young Bantu men came to the farms in order to earn the money to pay their tribe's head tax-because they had to-but they did not try hard and they went home after a few months. In this manner the compromise created a labor force that was transient and uncommitted and thus unwilling to learn the skills and habits of work needed to make it more productive. The mining companies thus faced a problem: how were they to use such a workforce? To solve the problem the companies organized the productive processes so that they could use large numbers of these un- skilled workers and a small number of skilled workers (and some not so</page><page sequence="7">Evolution of Colonial Institutions 1183 skilled) drawn from Britain. The companies paid the Bantu workers what they were worth to the companies-and what each Bantu was worth to a company was a wage too low to support a family, basic food rations, and housing in a compound.'3 It makes no difference here whether one sub- scribes to a marginal productivity theory of wages or to some other view. An appreciable increase in wages-one large enough to allow work- ers to live in houses with their families-could not have been paid out of profits. A different way of organizing production would have been neces- sary, and this would not have been possible without a different kind of labor force. The Bantu, living in compounds without families or others toward whom they felt responsible, and without prospects of advance- ment, did what any sane person would do: the minimum necessary, mov- ing from job to job. This behavior only confirmed European prejudices about the Bantu and so discouraged efforts to change the system. The pattern was set before one or two generations' experience of work- ing for wages and enjoying the things wages would buy began to change Bantu attitudes. Too late they became increasingly desirous of money incomes. At the same time, the men became less and less enamored of sharing their earnings with an extended kinship network back in the Re- served Areas, and wanted to settle with their families, at least more or lesis permanently, at their place of work.'4 The companies, meanwhile, had discovered that Bantu who settled with their families provided a more responsible workforce and began to establish locations where families could live and farm small subsistence plots nearby. It might have seemed -as it did to Godfrey Wilson'5-that a policy of slow assimilation had become possible. The system had, however, created a constituency of highly paid and privileged European workers who had much to lose-their high pay and privileged position-and nothing to gain by any policy that would have upgraded the Bantu workforce. They lived in the Rhodesias and so could make their desires effective on the spot. They voted in the elections for the colonial legislatures, which enjoyed semi-autonomous powers over the internal affairs of the colonies, and they were organized in unions that could bring mining to a halt if they struck. Thus the organization of pro- duction and the institutions of racial segregation reinforced each other. Actually Rhodesian Selection Trust, one of the two large copper min- ing companies in Northern Rhodesia, wanted to start up-grading its Bantu labor in the early 1940s and was willing to ride out a strike to do so, but was persuaded to make no changes in the interests of maintaining pro- duction during the war and, because of the dollar earnings, in the years</page><page sequence="8">1184 Walter C. Neale immediately after the war.'6 Here we have a case where metropolitan in- terests did retard Bantu development (under, one might note, a socialist as well as an earlier wartime coalition government). While the mining companies and their directors had no great long-run interest in maintaining the status quo, neither did they have strong reasons for wanting it changed. Since the skilled Europeans could quickly close down the operations of the companies, and as voters could influence local law and administration, the companies, quite naturally, chose commercial discretion over moral valor. This choice was almost certainly made more compelling by the thought that to change would be to give up a known, workable system in order to engage in a difficult, time-consuming experi- ment with an unknown system.lT So long as Europeans were powerful in Central Africa and the existing productive system continued to supply minerals, the companies were in a situation where the only sensible thing to do was to continue to hire many unskilled, migrant Bantu and a few skilled Europeans. There should be no difficulty with the ideas that the companies were sensible, the British workers were sensible, and the Bantu migrant labor- ers were sensible. Nor should there be problems with the ideas that the Bantus wre simultanously exploited and paid all that they were worth, or that the system was self-defeating. But it was not planned that way. The anthropomorphic assumption that a metropolitan country acted as if it were a person, with a control over its nationals in the colonies analogous to the control that a person exercises over his limbs, leads to the unhistorical view that a nation, like a "reasonable man," could have anticipated the long-term consequences of its actions or the actions of its nationals in the colonies. Instead of interpreting colonial histories as con- scious efforts to use power to exploit at the cost of humane values, one would do better to view the development of colonial institutions as a series of adaptations, by groups with varying interests and perceptions, to problems that arose from the conflicts of cultures in contact.

L. Jameson, the Pioneers, and the British South Africa Company during the conquest, but it is not inconsistent with the argument in this essay, and he refers (p. 90) to Mason's as a "fine book."

Only "a few eccentrics [said] that [the land] had never been alienated from the original inhabitants" (Mason, p. 258). It is a curiosity that the same issues of title and sovereignty were debated in India during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and that the British rulers there had, by the 1 840s, decided that they had completely misconceived the issues. The literature on British India that deals with these matters is now enormous, but still perhaps one of the finest short statements is George Campbell, "Tenure of Land in India," in Systems of Land Tenure in Various Coun- tries, ed. Cobden Club (London: Macmillan, 1870). More easily located would be B. H. Baden-Powell, The Land Systems of British India, 3 vols.

Throughout Revolt in Southern Rhodesia Ranger contrasts the attitudes and behavior of the white settlers with the orders from London and with the attitudes of civil servants and many other British in Southern Rho- desia and South Africa. It is important to realize that there was not one "British position" but at least two quite opposed "British positons." 11. The assertion that the long-term objective was to civilize the Bantu is not an assertion that the British in Southern Rhodesia, including colonial civil servants, began by liking or respecting the people whom they had come to civilize. On the contrary, "The reaction of settlers, missionaries</page><page sequence="10">1186 Walter C. Neale and administrators alike ... was one of contempt and dislike" (Ranger, p. 3; the following instances are also from Ranger, pp. 1, 3, 2). The Resi- dent Magistrate of Salisbury characterized them as "savages .... [w]th true kaffir deceit." A resident of Bulawayo jotted in his diary, "No one likes the Mashonas, dirty, cowardly lot. Matablele blood-thirsty devils but a fine type." Lord Grey, the third Administrator of the colony, wrote his wife that the Mashona "have the habits of a whipped cur and not infre- quently bite through terror the hand outstretched to help them." But among the colonial civil servants a change occurred. The first Native Commissioner of Mrewa later said, "We had underrated the Mashonas. We knew nothing of their past history ... [and] none of us really under- stood the people or could follow their line of thought." 12. J. S. Furnivall, Colonial Policy and Practice: A Comparative Study of Burma and Netherlands India (N.Y.: N.Y.U. Press, 1956, c1948), pp. 6-7. While Furnivall [as cited, and also especially Netherlands India: A Study of Plural Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1944, c1939)] has been standard for scholars in Southeast Asia studies, he has not been so widely read by other social scientists, perhaps because of his career as administrator and advisor to governments rather than as historian or economist. Only Lord Hailey, An African Survey, Revised 1956: A Study of Problems Arising in Africa South of the Sahara (Lon- don/N.Y./Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1957) might be considered competitive, but its 1,670 pages should be treated as an encyclopedic reference. 13. See Hla Myint, The Economics of the Developing Countries, 4th (rev.) ed. (London: Hutchison &amp; Co., 1973), pp. 42-46. Myint could hardly be described as unsympathetic to the people who made up the migrant labor forces that worked the European-managed mines and plantations. Myint's model of the colonial mining and plantation economy (pp. 41- 53) presents a general model, in more economistic terms, of the phe- nomena described in this section. Myint (pp. 29-40) also presents the processes of peasant adaptation to colonial rule in an analogous model- but without, in either case, strongly emphasizing the roles of cultural per- ceptions or of the different groups and interests involved. 14. Both Godfrey Wilson, An Essay on the Economics of Detribalization in Northern Rhodesia, Part 1 (Livingston, Northern Rhodesia: The Rhodes- Livingston Institute, 1941), chapter 3, and Margaret Read, "Migrant Labour in Africa and its Effects on Tribal Life," International Labour Review 45 (June 1942): 615-3 1 make these points. 15. Ibid. 16. Barber, The Economy of British Central Africa, p. 197. 17. That the companies were not devoted to the system was evidenced by their change of policy as it became clear that independence would soon come to Northern Rhodesia (Zambia). The companies were willing to change fast enough when the political situation changed, and they do not seem to have suffered over much by upgrading black Zambians. Myint cites Robert E. Baldwin ("A Study in Dual Economy--the Case of Cop- per Mining in Northern Rhodesia," Race 4 [November 1962]: 73-87) to the effect that the rapid increase in wages for Bantu may have halved</page><page sequence="11">Evolution of Colonial Institutions 1187 the numbers of unskilled employed. Whatever the merits or demerits of the new policy of increasing wages, the results show that at appreciably higher wages the companies preferred to reorganize the system of pro- duction in order to eliminate unskilled labor-further evidence that the unskilled were not worthwhile at much higher wages. Speaking of the gold-mining industry of Southern Rhodesia in the 1950s, Barber (The Economy of British Central Africa, pp. 249-51) says, "Rising money costs of African labour have encouraged a shift to higher techniques.... The gold mines which relied on labour-intensive techniques have gone out of production; meanwhile the larger properties have apparently in- troduced methods more capital intensive than those they found it profit- able to employ when African labour was cheaper." The argument here is not that, at an earlier time, the mining companies were paying "all they could," but that, within the system as it had evolved, they could not pay wages so much higher that the effects upon Bantu would have been sig- nificantly different.</page></plain_text>
