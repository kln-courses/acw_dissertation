<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theme and Form in The NVewcomes JULIET MCMASTER HACKERAY'S CRITICS generally agree that The Newcomes, with its painstaking detail in the depiction of a materialist upper middle-class society and its steady surge of direction toward a tragic conclusion, is a considerable achievement. It is consistently ranked as at least third among his novels and by John W. Dodds as "standing, in its scope and variety, with Vanity Fair at the head of all the novels." 1 Yet The Newcomes has received com- paratively little critical attention. As Lionel Stevenson has pointed out,2 most of Thackeray's critics have concentrated on Vanity Fair and Henry Esmond; and though in their books on Thackeray Dodds and Gordon Ray3 have made general thematic studies of The Newcomes and John Loofbourow has included a brief stylistic description,4 the kind of close scrutiny provided by articles in periodicals is noticeably lacking.5 Published over a period of twenty-three months, and containing within its thousand-odd pages scores of characters and a wide spread of locations, The Newcomes certainly presents a complex problem for structural analysis. It is a world in itself, and the Newcome family constitute a whole society. There is no single character whose fortunes we consistently follow and little of what we normally consider plot.

But, he asks, 4"what do such large loose baggy monsters, with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary, artistically mean?" 6 It is my intention to show that The Newcomes has considerably more composition than James gave it credit for, and that "mon- ster" though it is in length and scope, Thackeray's careful integra- tion of theme and form gives it both cohesion and artistic signifi- cance. In particular, his image patterns and his system of literary allusions are carefully organized to reflect the theme that he presents through character and action. The subtitle informs us that The Newcomes is the "memoirs of a most respectable family"; Thackeray's main subject is that elaborate middle-class confusion between virtue and money, good and goods, that constitutes "respectability." Such a confusion has an element of deliberate self-delusion in it, and Thackeray also attacks the mid-Victorian propensity to gloss over everything that is not, in the phrase of Dickens's Mrs. General, "perfectly proper, placid and pleasant." 7Sepulchres are skillfully whited, skeletons safely locked in cupboards-to use two of Thackeray's favorite images-and the ostrich, assured of its own irreproachable posi- tion, keeps its head firmly buried in the sand. Thackeray reflects this confusion and delusion by stylistic means: he tells a story that is principally about filthy lucre, but he simultaneously evokes fairy-tale and romance in the telling of it; so that style and matter, as wish-fulfillment and hard fact, are set in ironic counterpoint that echoes the confusion between worth and wealth and illusion and reality in the Newcome world.8 The dominating concern of the novel, permeating language and imagery and determining character and action, is money, for money is the central principle that holds the whole Newcome world together. The Newcomes, as Ethel once characterizes her family, are "unblushingly sordid" in their mercenary preoccupa- tion (425),9 and their banking business is integral to the novel. Banking for them is not just a way to make a living, but a whole existence.

As mercenary transactions dominate the action, so financial terminology pervades the language, giving a distinctive texture to the novel. Love, morality, art and faith are all discussed in financial terms. Colonel Newcome, bitterly disappointed after thirty years in India at the cold welcome accorded him by the banking brothers, betrays his emotion to the cabman who drives him away: "Very likely the cabman thought he was a disap- pointed debtor who had asked in vain to renew a bill. In fact, Thomas Newcome had overdrawn his little account. There was no such balance of affection in that bank of his brothers as the simple creature had expected to find there" (80). The same imagery is used for Clive's frustrated love for Ethel: "one great passion he had had and closed the account of it" (818). The mercenary metaphor is not used for the mercenary marriage alone. Even passion can be squandered like capital, where there is no steady income of affection to support a relationship: Many a young couple of spendthrifts get through their capital of passion in the first twelve months and have no love left for the daily demands of after-life. 0 me! for the day when the bank account is closed, and the cupboard is empty, and the firm of Damon and Phyllis insolvent! (491) Love is a commodity like any other, and with no great market value either. We hear, for instance, that the only person who might be said to love the ailing Sir Brian Newcome is his valet, "who loves him to the extent of fifty pounds a year and perquisites'' (629). Other emotions are equally reducible to pounds, shillings and pence. Hobson Newcome's grief for his mother's death can be calculated in inverse proportion to the size of his legacy, and he speaks of it in terms of "the weight of business which this present affliction entails" (42). And, as Barnes Newcome hurries to the City after his grandmother's funeral, we are reminded that "business is business, and must be attended to, though grief be ever so severe" (726). People are evaluated by their income, as we hear from Pen- dennis's long lecture when he tries to dissuade Clive from loving Ethel. Clive's intelligence, youth, goodness and love, even with</page><page sequence="4">180 Nineteenth-Century Fiction his moderate income, do not qualify him as Ethel's suitor, because he cannot "count purses with Sultan Farintosh." Thrift and prudence are the virtues that have market value, not love and generosity, and Pendennis's ironic refrain is Iago's "Put money in your purse" because "'tother coin don't pass in the market" (537). The marriage market itself is a central image in the novel, and the repetition of the mercenary marriage between various couples and its outcome is a unifying structural principle. Colonel New- come and his son Clive, Sir Brian Newcome and his children Barnes and Ethel, Leonore and her son Florac, all either marry for money or are prevented by the lack of money from marrying the person they love. According to the philosophy of Society, marriage is "but a question of money on one side and the other" (406). But those who hold this tenet, however substantial their bank balance, find through the course of the novel that there are multiple debts accruing in trust and affection. The Newcomes is a set of variations on this theme. As love is confused with money, so is faith. Religion is one of the bank's chief assets. Old Mrs. Newcome, the grand old lady of Hobson Brothers &amp; Newcome, is a Quaker, and Thomas Newcome, the founder of the family, netted this prize for a wife, along with her bank, by becoming a convert and by being careful to conciliate "the Quaker connexion" (20). The servants in her house, the "serious paradise" at Clapham, are all devotees of various bizarre dissenting religions, and the visitors are a mixture of "clerical gentlemen" and "clerks from the bank" (21). Her funeral is a grand fete testifying to the union of commerce and religion, which triumphantly carry the aristocracy in their wake: There was such a crowd you might have thought it was a Derby Day. The carriages of some of the greatest City firms, and the wealthiest Dissenting houses; several coaches full of ministers of all denomina- tions, including the Established Church; the carriage of the Right Honourable the Earl of Kew, and that of his daughter, Lady Ann Newcome, attended that revered lady's remains to their final resting- place (59). The image of religion as a commercial venture is most fully developed in the history of Charles Honeyman and Lady Whittlesea's, the chapel that is owned by a Jewish wine-merchant,</page><page sequence="5">The Newcomes 181 Sherrick, and built over his wine-cellar. Honeyman can synthesize religious fervor and convey it in calculated eloquence which he turns to good account, and his crocodile tears are current coin in certain circles of sentimental ladies. He is always "casting his eyes towards the chandelier," "beautifully smothering his emotion" (104), or, when "seraphically" playing the piano, "looking as if he would be lifted off the screw music-stool, and flutter up to the ceiling" (283). He is a genteel Chadband, a high-class religious gigolo, who makes the most of his female devotees. Sherrick, who thinks of him "as a manager would of a successful tragedian" (583), runs the chapel as a theatre: the pews are sold like boxes, and the best performers are carefully booked and billed. When Honeyman is arrested for debt by Moss the money-lender, Bay- ham reflects, "One Jew has the chapel, another Hebrew has the clergyman. It's singular, ain't it?" (322). Sherrick, a minor character in the story, has considerable thematic significance in a novel that depicts a materialistic society. For him, as for the other characters in their varying degrees, every enterprise is a commercial venture; only he is frank about the fact, whereas others try to drape their greed in virtue. He is quite as ready to talk about the chapel as "a good speculation" as he is about his theatre, his wine business, or his papers. He has no scruples of principle in his literary ventures, for instance. When he speculated in papers, he tells Pendennis, "I tried a Tory one, moderate Liberal, and out-and-out uncompromising Radical. I say, what d'ye think of a religious paper, the Catechism, or some such name? Would Honeyman do as editor?" (329) Religion, politics and the arts are equally grist to Sherrick's mill, as they are in more subtle ways to the whole Newcome society. The subordination of high ideals to money is succinctly realized in the image of the silver coconut tree which adorns Colonel New- come's table in his splendid mansion in Tyburnia. It is when the colonel is himself in the banking business, like his heartless brothers, that he delights in this emblem of prosperity: There was a superb silver coco-nut-tree, whereof the leaves were dexterously arranged for holding candles and pickles; under the coco- nut was an Indian prince on a camel giving his hand to a cavalry officer on horse-back-a howitzer, a plough, a loom, a bale of cotton, on which were the East India Company's arms, a brahmin, Britannia,</page><page sequence="6">182 Nineteenth-Century Fiction and Commerce, with a cornucopia were grouped round the principal figures (823-824). Mercantilism and imperialism, war and peace, agriculture, indus- try and nationalism, are all lumped together in silver, immor- talized in "this chaste and elegant specimen of British art," and set to carry pickles for the delectation of a Newcome family. The coconut tree wanders through the latter half of the novel, casting an ominous shadow over the colonel's household and performing its own little Odyssey, until it too ends up in the hands of "the Hebrew gentlemen." For this view of The Newcomes as a novel about money, Barnes Newcome is the focal character. He of all the Newcomes has his heart most firmly located in his pocket. He is the banker par excellence. His relations with his friends and family are governed by the bank; because they have substantial accounts, he is ready to receive both Clive and Lord Highgate into his house-one of whom would like to carry off Barnes's sister, and the other his wife. His chief information on such subjects as his sister's marriage and his wife's elopement comes in the form of a wire from the bank: "Consols, so-and-so. French Rentes, so much. Highgate's and Farintosh's accounts withdrawn" (801). In his feud with Colonel Newcome he will not accept a challenge, but he strikes "such a blow as might be expected from that quarter" that is, a financial one-and explodes the Bundelcund Banking venture by refusing to honor its bills at a critical period. He not only buys his wife, but sells her for what he can get when he finds he has made a bad bargain, exacting the last penny in damages from the man who rescued her from her husband. "In the City we have no hearts, you know," he jokes (688); and his uncle, Colonel New- come, learns the truth of this through the novel, until at the end he says bitterly, "We understand that sort of thing. London bankers have no hearts-for these last fifty years past that I have known you, . . . has there been anything in your conduct that has led me to suppose you had?" (840) It is part of the intricate structure of the novel that the great World which it depicts in such painstaking detail is reflected in miniature in numerous little microcosms through the book. Each little community, each gathering of people, even a single object like the coconut tree, has the quality of being complete in itself, with its own center of gravity and its own set of revolving satellites</page><page sequence="7">The Newcomes 183 within the major system. The most fully realized of these micro- cosms is perhaps the Ridleys' lodging-house in London: appro- priately in the garret is Fred Bayham, the embodiment of literary Bohemia; on the second floor is Charles Honeyman, the repre- sentative of fashionable religion; and on the first is Bagshot, Esq., M.P., who is more ready to discuss vintage wine than politics. The landlord is a lord's butler, and his son becomes a great painter, who is inspired by another lodger, the shabby-genteel Miss Cann. Below stairs, of course, one finds the servants and "servi servorum," Julia the cook and Slavey. Under this roof at 23 Walpole Street is the World, with all its pretensions and aspirations, its virtues and hypocrisies. The repeating microcosms, each reflecting worldliness, suggest that the world is inescapable. And it is in the context of this glittering but often suffocating world of avarice and pretension that the major characters act out their individual dramas. Ethel, who at the beginning of the novel "belongs to her belongings," as Lady Kew tells her, has to develop to the point where her belong- ings belong to her. Clive's suffering, which reaches tragic dimen- sions, is the result of the Newcome banking values, which have deprived him of his love and his art and made him a victim, be- cause a debtor, to the Campaigner. And Colonel Newcome brings disaster alike to himself and to others by applying a sentimental code of honor to the unyielding figures of a balance sheet. In each case the human situation is fully realized in the context of the acquisitive society which brings it about. The colonel's quixotic chivalry in a money-grubbing world has its stylistic counterpart in the pattern of allusion to romance, fairy- tale, and fable through the novel.10 This pattern, with the re- curring financial imagery, achieves a cross-grained texture in the novel that reproduces the contradictions in the Newcome world. "Mr. Newcome's grandfather came to London with a satchel on his back, like Whittington. Isn't it romantic?" -so gushes Clara Pulleyn as she persuades herself that Barnes Newcome will make a good husband (420). Such is the glamorized version of the origin of the Newcome family. Colonel Newcome himself is a latter-day Don Quixote, and Scott's characters and incidents are often invoked: Clive models his behavior on a character from Quentin Durward (303) and chooses an incident from Ivanhoe 10 See Loofbourow.</page><page sequence="8">184 Nineteenth-Century Fiction as the subject for one of his grandiose paintings for the Academy. Florac is another admirer of "Valtare Scott" and enjoys playing Ravenswood to his servant's Caleb Balderstone (353). Characters and relationships are frequently painted in the bright colors of fairy-tale. Lady Kew is repeatedly described as a witch and depicted as one in Doyle's illustrations. We hear that Colonel Newcome and Mrs. Mackenzie, in planning the marriage that is to turn out so disastrously, have a "kind scheme ... that their young ones should marry and be happy ever after, like the prince and princess of the fairy-tale" (332). Or a paragraph will begin, "We read in fairy-stories [of] the king and queen who lived once upon a time" (135), to introduce another of the many incongruous analogies between fairy-tale and middle-class Victo- rian England. The allusions are in ironic counterpoint to the main theme, for the world of the Newcomes is no fairyland. Their marriages no more allow them to "live happily ever after" than does Clive's to Rosey, and their rise to fortune, however like Dick Whittington's, can be called "romantic" only by a considerable feat of self- delusion. The Overture and the epilogue of jumbled but significant beast fables set the whole novel in an ironic framework. Certain of the animals in the fables have recognizable traits of characters in the novel-the owl talks like Mrs. Hobson Newcome, the donkey in the lion's skin would be Farintosh, the lamb that beds with the wolf is Lady Clara Pulleyn, the wolf in sheep's clothing of course would be Barnes himself. The difference is that whereas all the pretentious or greedy or foolish animals in the Overture come by their deserts in the manner familiar in Aesop and La Fontaine, we see no such process in the main body of the novel. After the last dramatized event, the death of Colonel Newcome, Thackeray draws a line, and speaks in his own person: "As I write the last line with a rather sad heart, Pendennis and Laura, and Ethel and Clive fade away into fable-land" (1007). The senti- mental, he realizes, will be anxious to hear of the happy endings in store for these characters, and so he briefly suggests the kind of ending that the sentimental require: My belief then is, that in fable-land somewhere, Ethel and Clive are living most comfortably together.... What about Sir Barnes Newcome</page><page sequence="9">The Newcomes 185 ultimately? My impression is that he is married again, and it is my fervent hope that his present wife bullies him. Mrs. Mackenzie cannot have the face to keep that money which Clive paid over to her, beyond her lifetime; and will certainly leave it and her savings to little Tommy. I should not be surprised if Madame de Montcontour left a smart legacy to the Pendennis children; and Lord Kew stood god-father in case-in case Mr. and Mrs. Clive wanted such an article.... Anything you like happens in fable-land. Wicked folks die 'a propos (for instance, that death of Lady Kew was most artful, for if she had not died, don't you see that Ethel would have married Lord Farintosh the next week?)-annoying folks are got out of the way; the poor are rewarded- the upstarts are set down in fable-land,-the frog bursts with wicked rage, the fox is caught in his trap, the lamb is rescued from the wolf, and so forth, just in the nick of time. And the poet of fable-land rewards and punishes absolutely (1008-1009). That phrase "in fable-land" becomes more ironically loaded with each repetition. For the whole action of the novel has been saying that the world of the Newcomes is not fable-land, any more than it is fairyland. We have no dramatic depiction of the marriage of Clive and Ethel, because according to the reality of the main body of the novel it does not happen. Everyone would like to think of Barnes as hen-pecked; but we know that Warrington's prediction for him is far more likely to represent the hard facts: "I look to see Sir Barnes Newcome prosper more and more. I make no doubt he will die an immense capitalist, and an exalted peer of this realm" (716). Lady Kew certainly did die in the course of the novel in time to prevent Ethel's marriage to Farintosh, but not in time to allow her to marry Clive. And the notion of Mrs. Mackenzie's leaving a legacy to Clive's son is quite ludicrously improbable. "Anything you like happens in fable-land"-and that is the only place it does happen. "The poet of fable-land rewards and punishes absolutely"-but a major theme of the novel is that poetic justice does not operate in life, however it operates in romance and fairy-tale. And in his "happy ending" Thackeray is exposing rather than capitulating to the kind of sentimentality by which readers like to delude themselves that everything comes out right in the end. In The Newcomes virtue is certainly not rewarded materially: Colonel Newcome dies a pauper. If "virtue is its own reward," its wages are meager enough, for the saintly Madame de Florac has no more spiritual contentment than the wicked old</page><page sequence="10">186 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Lady Kew: there is little to choose between Lady Kew's "fourscore years of lonely vanity" (725) and the "nearly fifty years dying" which is Madame de Florac's summary of her own adult life (629). Even the concept of heavenly reward after death, the last resort of the canvasser for virtue, is treated with heavy irony. These are the glib words of her director: "Not here, my daughter, is to be your happiness," says the priest; "whom Heaven loves it afflicts." And he points out to her the agonies of suffering saints of her sex; assures her of their present beatitudes and glories; exhorts her to bear her pains with a faith like theirs; and is empowered to promise her a like reward (608). Vice is no more punished than virtue is rewarded. Perhaps "crime does not pay," but greed and hypocrisy and the selfish pursuit of one's own ends certainly do. "To push on in the crowd, every male or female struggler must use his shoulders. If a better place than yours presents itself just beyond your neighbour, elbow him and take it.... The proofs of the correctness of the above re- marks I show in various members of the Newcome family" (95- 96). This is what The Newcomes is about, rather than how "the fox is caught in his trap, the lamb is rescued from the wolf, and so forth." In the Newcome world, your vices are your assets. A bad temper such as Lady Kew's, which makes her feared and respected, is "one of the most precious and fortunate gifts with which a gentleman or lady can be endowed" (427); and the man who "abuses the men and things which he uses ... is better served than more grateful persons" (482). The Newcome world is so far from being governed by justice that in it people like Barnes pro- ceed from strength to strength, and from one reward to the next, while people like Clive and his father are crushed. The animal imagery that is a connecting motif of the novel works in two ways. Much of it connects with tlhe moral fables of the opening and closing pages; the beasts with which the human characters are compared are anthropomorphic and humorous and evoke a moral response. Madame de Florac is a pelican; Honey- man's fashion-following congregation are appropriately a flock of sheep; and the social "lions" are such as belong in the drawing- room rather than the jungle. Of Clive's preference for Ethel over Rosey we hear that "the lad might ... be as happy as any young donkey that browses on this common of ours-but he must go and</page><page sequence="11">The Newcomes 187 heehaw after a zebra, forsooth!" (572) Such images present an ordered moral universe, in which behavior can be classified as good or bad, wise or foolish. But the animal imagery also suggests an amoral universe and the post-Darwinian view of nature as nothing more-or less-than a struggle for survival. These animals-and birds and snakes pre- dominate here-are drawn not from La Fontaine or the bestiaries but from natural history, and they are divided not into good and bad but into predators and victims. Creditors and bailiffs "rush like vultures upon their prey" (326); Lady Kew is an eagle, swoop- ing on Farintosh, the lamb on whom she is to feed her eaglet, Ethel (609); Clive and Hoby are again predatory birds, hunting the mouse Rosey (743), while Rosey before her mother is "a bird before a boa-constrictor" (935). The struggle for survival in the Newcome world is perhaps more refined than that among the animals, but it is not ultimately any gentler. The typical product of this world is Barnes, whom Warrington shows to be even baser than "Nature's rogues" (716). It is the carnivores like him, rather than the herbivores like the colonel, who prosper in the main stream of evolution in English society. An exposition of The Newcomes suggesting that Thackeray presented English society as a savage and predatory struggle for survival needs some qualification. Thackeray's faculty for seeing every side of a question prevented him from writing a roman a these in the manner of Zola and the naturalists. As Barnes New- come represents the refined savagery of a greedily self-seeking society, so the artist J. J. Ridley stands for the truth of human ideals. He can conceive beauty, love, and heroism in his imagina- tion, and realize them in his art; to him "splendours of Nature were revealed to vulgar sights invisible, and beauties manifest in forms, colours, shadows of common objects, where most of the world saw only what was dull, and gross, and familiar" (160); and he is a greater painter than Clive, who can paint only what he sees. The ideals of romance have a certain validity as well as the actu- alities of life as we know it, for the two are complementary and are defined in terms of each other. Colonel Newcome may be crushed, but we and characters in the novel have pity for him; and concepts like decency and honor exist and operate even in a society where the Barnes Newcomes prosper. The Newcomes is no "loose baggy monster": it is not just a</page><page sequence="12">188 Nineteenth-Century Fiction sprawling narrative that contains some amusing characters and some graphic description of manners in mid-Victorian society. It is a carefully organized novel with a unifying theme to which style and imagery, as well as character and action, contribute. The action takes place, and the characters find their moral being, in a minutely realized milieu in which "respectability" is the dominant operative standard. Thackeray's achievement is to convey society's confusion of values by stylistic means: he relates his story in language that elevates "fumbling in a greasy till" to heroism and reduces love and faith to mere commodities. The counterpoint between style and matter does more than illuminate a contem- porary vice: it reflects some of the contradictions of human existence. As the animal imagery suggests both the ordered moral universe of fable and the savage jungle of Darwinian theory, so Thackeray's pattern of contrasts between illusion and reality, fantasy and hard fact, aspiration and achievement, conveys how far human practice falls short of human ideals.</page></plain_text>
