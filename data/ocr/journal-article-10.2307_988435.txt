Augustin, 1967, xi+79 PP., 45 illus., $5.00. In a very brief but moving foreword to Palladio's Villas, Professor Ackerman re- cords the "confusion of pride and humil- ity" with which he delivered the annual Cook Lecture to his former teachers and colleagues at the Institute in New York. It is with much the same mixture of emotions that one so very recently his student dis- cusses his latest books. My task is made easy, however, by the excellence of these slim volumes: the one a historical-critical essay on Palladio's ceuvre as a whole; the other an expanded version of Chapter 2 of the former, with a catalogue of the villas, and complementary photographs. Palladio is divided into five parts. An in- troduction on the major influences in the architect's career is followed by chapters on the buildings, which are typologically di- vided into villas, civic and domestic works, and churches. A final chapter presents the author's own definition of Palladio's archi- tectural principles. Chapter I fixes Palladio in time and place. Ackerman traces his evolution from unlearned stonemason in 1538 to celebrated author (Quattro libri dell'architettura, I570) and architect of the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza at the time of his death in I580. The major factors in this development were (I) the general intellectual climate of northern Italy in the mid-sixteenth century (Vesalius, The Academy); (2) the architect- theorist-patrons Giangiorgio Trissino and Alvise Cornare; (3) the professional archi- tects Serlio, Sanmichele, Sansovino, and Giulio Romano; and (4) the buildings of ancient and modern Rome (Bramante, Raphael). All of this has been discussed be- fore. What is new in this chapter is the au- thor's conclusion that Palladio was "a part- Humanist ... not an Albertian uomo uni- versale ... [but] an early precursor of the modern expert with a... knowledge of... one discipline" (p. 21); that is to say, an architect who, in his book and in his build- ings, seems closer to us than to the Renais- sance. This view of Palladio as the fountain- head of an architectural tradition which has not yet completely expired will come as no great surprise to students of post-mediaeval architecture, but it is good to have that view restated in these terms. It does greater justice to the architect's historical r61e than recent attempts to make of him-still a stonemason at thirty-Alberti's cinque- cento twin. Ackerman's conclusion brings to mind the fact that Alberti was a Hu- manist first, and only incidentally a very good architect, whereas Palladio was a very good architect first, and incidentally a scholar. This emerges with greater clarity from the characterization of Palladio's principles in the last chapter. The next chapter is a shorter version of the Cook Lecture, so I shall momentarily turn to Palladio's Villas. The statement that "one does not build effete pleasure-domes in swamplands" (p. 7) leads into the major contribution of this essay: the exposition, as illuminating architecturally as it is his- torically, of the economic and social raisons d'etre of these rural residences. In the mid- sixteenth century the Venetian aristocracy was driven for economic reasons to turn from the risks of commerce to the greater stability offered by the reclamation and agricultural development of the terraferma. This was a major undertaking which re- quired the close supervision of the land- lords; hence the need for and location of the villas in the center of isolated land hold- ings. For the most part Palladio provided this landed gentry with cheap, unarticulat- ed brick-and-stucco boxes (based, in the author's view, upon Palladio's own dis- covery of a "stripped style of antiquity" [p. 4]), which are expressive of the villas' humble purpose as the administrative cen- ters of working farms. The wings housed the stables, and the upper story of the main block was often used as a grain elevator! To mark the owner's social standing and humanist inclinations, however, Palladio added to each of these boxes a temple-front portico, and organized the whole complex according to an anthropomorphic concep- tion (a central spine with limbs hierarchi- cally attached-symmetrical in breadth but not in depth). In thus solving the building program of these humanist-farmers, Palla- dio produced the ideogram of a country house which was to retain its force into our</page><page sequence="2">81 own time. Professor Ackerman has greatly enriched our understanding of this build- ing type in Palladio's ceuvre by expanding his research into the society which pro- duced it. The method is not new, but many art historians seem reluctant to use it. The essay in Palladio's Villas is supple- mented by notes, a bibliography, and a catalogue of the villas, including both sur- viving and destroyed or unexecuted build- ings, but not those designs from the I540os published by Zorzi in Palladio, 1954. In the catalogue Professor Ackerman summarizes the present state of knowledge about each of the villas, and adds his own observations, such as his credible suggestion of an early date for the villa at Poiana Maggiore. De- spite its brevity, and a few noisome typo- graphical errors (Lepanto 1570 rather than 1571 [p. 8]; Palladio's visit to Cicogna 1667 rather than 1567 [p. 75]; etc.), Palladio's Villas becomes a standard introduction (the author himself disclaims any attempt to be definitive) to this aspect of the architect's work. It thus replaces Burger's Die Villen des Andrea Palladio of 1909. And because of its small size it can be taken along as a handy guide by anyone making the pil- grimage to the buildings themselves, which should give it at least one advantage over Zorzi's forthcoming tome. Chapter 3, to return once again to the Penguin book, is devoted to civic as well as domestic architecture. Here we meet the strutting (when not scrapping) Vicentine nobility erecting monuments to itself in the face of imminent economic disaster. The planning is grand; the execution indicative of the uncertain times: "Vicenza has about ten Palladio fagades with barely enough original rooms behind them to furnish two dwellings" (p. 8 I); and the result a cinque- cento incarnation of the timeless urban pas- seggiata: a public parade of la bellafigura, if nothing else. Here, as with the villas, Ackerman casts a broad net. He traces Palladio's develop- ment as designer of palaces from neophyte compiler of Renaissance motifs (Fig. 44) to independent creator of the quasi-Baroque fagade of the Palazzo Porto-Breganze (Fig. 65); but in the author's comprehensive view this difference is not due to stylistic evolution alone. He sees a fagade in relation to the context for which it was created, so that the Palazzo Valmarana "is Palladio's most effective response to the narrow streets of Vicenza, because it was conceived in planes rather than in quasi-sculptural terms .... The giant pilasters, being planar, help the integration with ... neighboring facades" (p. 112), whereas "Where giant half-columns were used, as at the ... Pa- lazzo Porte-Breganze, ample squares of- fered distant and varied viewpoints" (p. I117). Whether or not we agree with such judgments, it is a pleasure to find among art historians one architectural critic whose focus goes beyond the limits of the isolated building to consider the interaction between it and its setting. The author's discussion of the Palazzo Thiene brings up the question of Giulio Romano's intervention in Vicentine archi- tectural affairs. The Mantuan master was in the city to consult on the Palazzo della Ra- gione (Palladio's Basilica), for which he prepared a model at the end of 1542, the exact date of the contract linking Palladio (as "lapicida testibus") with the Thiene palace. Despite the similarity between the lower windows of this palace and those of the Casa di Raffaello as detailed in the drawing in the RIBA attributed to Palla- dio (Fig. 3), the palace as a whole (original plan and executed elevations) would look more at home in a monograph on Giulio Romano than it does here (and are all these sketches published by Zorzi in relation to this palace and the Basilica really by Palla- dio?). As early as Inigo Jones's visit to Italy the story was abroad that Giulio had de- signed the palace, and the author himself admits that the nearly contemporary "Casa Civena has so little in common with ... the Palazzo Thiene ... that they could not be assigned to the same architect by appear- ance alone" (p. 94). Perhaps we need a new definition of authorship with regard to such architectural works; even better, we need a monographic study of Giulio Ro- mano's architecture to complement Hartt's work on the paintings. Ecclesiastical architecture, largely in Venice, is the focus of the fourth chapter. After a discussion of the central versus the longitudinal plan in the Renaissance, Pro- fessor Ackerman recognizes the precedence of the latter in the I56os, and makes a ma- jor contribution to architectural studies of the later cinquecento by recognizing an affinity among the churches of Palladio, Vignola, and Alessi. Reacting to the spirit of the Council of Trent, "They found ways to combine an ample nave for a large con- gregation and side chapels big enough for the celebration of the sacraments with the majestic domed central space" inherited from the earlier Renaissance (p. 128), in order to produce massive, vaulted masonry structures which (to draw my own conclu- sion from the author's discussion of such churches as the Redentore rather than ac- cept his own conclusion on p. 159) are the ultimate realization of the Renaissance of Roman architecture. The discussion of the fagades of Palla- dio's churches profits from the same con- cern for setting which characterized the discussion of the Vicentine palaces: "their pictorial r61le in the panorama of Venice" (p. 145) is recognized, and they are not analyzed as isolated exercises in geometric manipulation. The author's remarks leave little doubt that Palladio himself envisioned them in situ. (To the bibliography here should be added Ackerman's own study of the recently discovered drawing for the fa- gade of S. Petronia in Bologna in the Essays in the History of Architecture Presented to Ru- dolf Wittkower, London, 1967, pp. I IOff.) The final chapter, on Palladio's architec- tural principles, shows Professor Acker- man's critical faculties at their best. It is as refreshing as it is illuminating to have an essay of this kind begin with the buildings themselves rather than attempt to reach them through the labyrinth of stylistic se- mantics. In general Ackerman avoids such tiresome and fruitless questions as "Was Palladio a Mannerist?" in order to see the buildings anew. The result is worth it. Ac- cording to Ackerman, Palladio sought three-dimensional control over his works through a hierarchical, tripartite composi- tion based in part upon traditional Vene- tian house plans, an axial symmetry as orig- inal as it was implacable, and proportional relationships of all the parts and of the parts to the whole, which he found in Alberti but discovered reaffirmed by contempo- rary mathematical theory. If we think of the axis as the spine, we have the anthropo- morphic system mentioned as characteris- tic of the villas. The author demonstrates this system by an analysis of the plan of the Palazzo Chiericati in Vicenza, where the tripartite composition is woven together by interlocking axes and proportionate re- lationships. It is rather surprising to find that the actual dimensions ofexecuted build- ings are very close to the dimensions of the plans in the Quattro libri. Palladio's principles were derived from his study of antiquity, but his "inventive- ness is more to the point than his accuracy" (p. 177) in surveying the remains of the an- cients. In one case only, the Teatro Olim- pico, was Palladio's antiquity "that of the Humanist scholars-learned, archaeologi-</page><page sequence="3">82 cal, conscious of the past rather than mod- em" (p. 177). It is this freedom of inven- tion which sets Palladio off from, say, Al- berti, and reinforces the author's conclu- sion in the first chapter. But the final effect of Palladio's architec- ture is neither geometric nor antique. The author's study of the buildings in situ, be- neath the splendidly luminous skies of northern Italy, leads him to the conclusion that "Palladio was as sensual, as skilled in visual alchemy as any Venetian painter of his time" (p. 184). So the hero of Neo- classical criticism, the architect who, ac- cording to the intellectual critics, produced a cold, hard, logical architecture (as it seemed from the plates of the Quattro libri to those who had never seen the buildings themselves), emerges from this study as a fusion of the intellectual and the sensual. The author sees this fusion as the reason for Palladio's popularity with "so many gener- ations and so many different types" (p. 184). Professor Ackerman has not dismissed Palladio the geometrician; he has added Palladio the artist. It is characteristic of him that he would find a human being behind the Palladian facade. The text of the Penguin book lives up to the kind of spirited writing, full of salient facts and pregnant asides, which we have come to expect from Professor Ackerman. The occasional slips are of minor impor- tance: the early sixteenth-century Roman palace (Casa di Raffaello) is said to be a "palace/house facade formula of two stor- eys without a court.. ." (p. 29), but this is neither clear nor correct if it means that such palaces do not encompass a cortile. The col- umns of the Corinthian atrium of the mon- astery of the Carith in Venice are described as three stories high (p. 155), but the ac- companying section from the Quattro libri clearly shows them two stories high. Noth- ing better demonstrates the high quality of this essay than the pettiness of such observa- tions. The editors and publisher are to be com- mended for beginning this series of publi- cations, and we look forward to other brief essays as penetrating as this one. At the same time it must be pointed out that the publisher is responsible for several major flaws in this book: some poorly reproduced photographs (Fig. 8, etc.); the captions which fail to locate or date the monuments; the make-up of the pages which reserves a full page for the rather insignificant draw- ing attributed to Giulio Romano (Fig. 51) but provides just enough space for mere postage-stamp reproductions of plans, ele- vations, and sections from the Quattro libri; the unfortunate and insensitive choice of Palladio's one asymmetrical palace facade to decorate the title page of a book devoted in part to exposing Palladio's anthropo- morphic symmetry; and, most distressing, the partial reproduction on the back cover (of the English edition, not the American) ofthat "Veronese portrait" ofPalladio from Giacomo Leoni's edition of the Quattro libri which Wittkower long ago (Arte Veneta, 1954) proved spurious (the author himself is aware that no putative Palladio portrait "has an unassailable pedigree" [p. 35]). The brevity and readability of the text of Palladio, as well as the lack of encumbering footnotes, produce a work as enjoyable for the amateur as it is useful for the student; but these rare qualities of scholarly writing should not deceive us. The text represents an enviable distillation and critical appraisal of a vast amount of scholarship (some of it listed in the "Bibliographical Notes" after Chapter 5), as well as a wealth of original observation based upon a first-hand experi- ence of the buildings themselves. That we are able to share a little of that experience through the freshness of the text and the originally excellent photographs, taken es- pecially for this study by Phyllis Dearborn Massar, makes this work as pleasurable as it is indispensable.
