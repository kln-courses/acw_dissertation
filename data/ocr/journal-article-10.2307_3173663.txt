<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIEWPOINT Spirituality and the American Feminist Experience Gayle Graham Yates Since Anne Barstow Driver published her review essay on women's studies in religion in the Winter 1976 issue of Signs, the premises of the field have changed somewhat.1 The methodological center has become what she saw even then as the center for theory: women's experience. Of great importance from the beginning of the women's movement, con- cern for women's experience has moved to centrality in every area of women's studies, both disciplinary and interdisciplinary. Beginning in the late 1970s, feminist critical theories and methodologies began to be constructed on the foundation of personal awareness, political advocacy of women, and the body of knowledge on the subject of women that had been built in the decade before. We came to recognize that feminism is a new world view, a comprehensive framework of ideas through which all experience and action can be measured, judged, and evaluated. More precisely, we came to articulate what had happened in the minds, com- mitments, and choices of a large number of Americans over the decade. Feminism had become a set of principles and values that informed a way of life for many women and men. It had become a cognitive frame of 1.

In religious studies, feminist scholarship sometimes mirrored and sometimes directed the feminist spiritual awareness of many American women. For many, this new consciousness involved a transformation of personal and institutional orders. Rather than the word "religion," as- sociated with historically established and institutionalized forms, feminists sometimes chose the word "spirituality" to label their discovery and affirmation. For an individual, for a group of women, or for an institution, women's spirituality suggests a vital, active, energizing inte- rior perception. While I believe that a definition of spirituality includes collective and institutional attitudes, expressions, and experiences, as well as those of individuals, the word is most easily understood as the core of a person, the center from which meaning, self, and life understanding are gener- ated. Such is the meaning given it by Amanda Porterfield: "Spirituality refers to personal attitudes toward life, attitudes that engage an individ- ual's deepest feelings and most fundamental beliefs. It encompasses the religious attitudes and experiences of individuals and may often be used as a synonym for religiousness. But spirituality covers a larger domain than that staked out by religion because it does not require belief in God or commitment to institutional forms of worship."2 Amplifying this definition to include institutions and communities, Eleanor Humes Haney helps us see another piece of the framework of feminist spiri- tuality: "The vision is one of community, indeed of a new heaven and earth. It is a vision of women in all areas of life, in the legislatures and parliaments of the world as well as in the homes, villages, and cities of the earth ... Feminist vision, and thus feminism, is a values-a moral- revolution."3 The female experience informing this definition is encap- sulated at the end of Ntozake Shange's play/poemfor colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf: "i found god in myself / &amp; i loved her / i loved her fiercely."4 Feminist spirituality, then, parallels the many other facets of feminism now active in America and has (1) far-reaching implications for personal awareness and behavior of women; (2) expressions in indi- vidual and corporate actions that bear ethical significance; (3) in- stitutional forms and effects on institutions; (4) public policy ramifica- tions; (5) symbolic, mythic, ritual, literary, and aesthetic meaning; and (6) cognitive import and expressions. If one believes, as I do, that 2. Amanda Porterfield, Feminine Spirituality in America: From Sarah Edwards to Martha Graham (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1980), p. 6. 3.

Spirituality</page><page sequence="3">Autumn 1983 61 feminism is a new world view, then the spiritual aspect of it has ramifica- tions in every aspect of life. Although, as I mentioned, many feminists prefer the word "spiri- tuality" for defining the import, immediacy, and intensity of their ex- perience and understanding, "religion" has probably remained the most frequently used term for this phenomenon, and "religious studies" for its study in academe. Therefore, I shall use "women's spirituality" and "feminist religion" as synonyms in this essay. In the pages that follow I shall review a selected list of scholarly works that have risen out of an articulated feminist religious position. I shall not look at any of the myriad works that have been published in aid of practice. The materials selected for the following discussion were nearly all published in the five-year period from 1976 to 1981, rose from a stated feminist purpose, and are developed from some form of experiential methodology. Theology and Cognitive Theory Most active in the field have been the writers of cognitive theory- persons historically called theologians-the thinkers who make up, in- vent, create, express, and criticize religion's architectonic ideas. Many theorists in religious studies are radical in that they address the root questions raised by feminist consciousness. For instance, we can identify one group of thinkers who, although different from each other in im- portant ways, are crucially similar in starting their reflection and schol- arly endeavors from the premises of feminism itself. These obviously differ from premises found in history or practice of religion or in schol- arly borrowings from other disciplines or methodologies. In addition, while some of them reach conclusions that have equivalents in con- ventional scholarship, some feminist scholars offer premises and draw conclusions that are radical departures toward a new feminist inter- pretation of life, values, and meaning and that cannot be cataloged under old rubrics. Their work begins with attention to women in creative new ways and ends with advocacy on women's behalf. Among these innovative theorists I suggest that prominent names are Rosemary Radford Ruether, Mary Daly, Naomi Goldenberg, Carol Christ, Judith Plaskow, and Madonna Kolbenschlag. That group in- cludes members with loyalties to Christian, Jewish, and goddess worship, but all share points of departure and experientially drawn conclusions that are radically feminist. Similarly feminist and experiential in point of origin but more conventionally descriptive in their conclusions are such scholars as Amanda Porterfield, Carol Ochs, Joan Chamberlain Eng- elsman, and Judith Ochshorn. Of all the recognized spokespersons for American feminism, two of the best known are Mary Daly and Rosemary Radford Ruether. In her Signs</page><page sequence="4">62 Yates most significant book, New Woman/New Earth, Ruether made the wom- en's movement aware of the significant historical connection between women and nature and demonstrated the ideological interweaving of the degradation of women with a disdain for ecology.5 While she is critical of different establishments, her prolific scholarship has con- tinued to be liberationist, Marxist, and Christian. Daly, on the other hand, aroused to anger by realization of her "otherness" as a woman within the Roman Catholic church, began her published writing with an insider's critique of that institution but made a public and historic statement of departure from it in her 1972 sermon on women's exodus given in Harvard's Memorial Church. Her most significant work, Beyond God the Father, gave us consciousness of the centrality of the patriarchal God to Western civilization and its oppres- sion of women. Gyn/Ecology followed, a work that dramatically cataloged atrocities against women and crystallized poetic anger, les- bian separatism, and the injunction to make up new forms for life's expression out of women's own consciousness.6 In an article entitled "Ruether and Daly: Theologians Speaking and Sparking, Building and Burning," Carter Heyward contrasts Marxist historicism and ontological reflection to explain the differing epis- temologies of Ruether and Daly. Daly's ontological method and Ruether's Marxist historical method have brought them in the course of their productive careers to quite different positions, Heyward asserts, but both epistemological vantage points continue to be worth close at- tention. They are both experiential in my use of the term, Ruether the more activist politically, Daly the more activist expressively. Heyward writes, "I believe that it is not an either/or-Daly's fury or Ruether's fortitude, imaginative spinning or historical analysis, hard-nosed prophecy or analytical teaching, what 'might be' or 'what is.' It is, rather, a both-and-both-Daly's remarkable clarity and prophetic boldness of 5.

Rosemary Radford Ruether and Eleanor McLaughlin (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1979). Ruether is a contributing editor to Christianity and Crisis, in which she has published remarkable pieces, including "Consciousness Raising at Puebla: Women Speak to the Latin Church" (39, no. 5 [April 2, 1979]: 77-80), and "Why Socialism Needs Feminism and Vice Versa" (40, no. 7 [April 28, 1980]: 103-8). 6.

In the sense that the theologian begins theory with commitment to a belief, while the philosopher begins theory with inter- est in an idea, Daly might still be considered a theologian, but a feminist theologian rather than the Catholic theologian of her "sister self" from her past, for her faith commitment is to feminism. In Changing of the Gods, another feminist theorist of religion, Naomi Goldenberg, affirms and appropriates the identification "theologian" for feminists who theorize about basic realities. (Goldenberg prefers the spelling "thea-," however, on the grounds that thea, the Greek word for "goddess," is more appropriate for feminists.) Goldenberg's book asserts boldly that the divinities of historical Judaism and Christianity are in- adequate for contemporary women and will be overturned and replaced by new female forms of religious expressiveness. She writes sympatheti- cally of new aspects of witchcraft being practiced among women; advo- cates active dream interpretations among women, especially in groups; and equates religion and psychology.8 The body of Carol Christ's work provides a model in seeking texts for contemporary women's spiritual understanding and in analyzing the worthiness of those texts for their accuracy in representing women's lives. Like Goldenberg, Christ considers belief in a goddess necessary for contemporary women, but she differentiates women's spiritual needs (deepest longings, yearnings, fundamental beliefs) from their psychol- ogy (the makeup of personality). In her goddess theology, Christ does not fear anthropomorphism or belief in the full immanence of divinity, attitudes that male theologians have maintained throughout the cen- 7.

A liberationist theologian might insist on a central core to deity or a central focus for religiousness in order to have a locus for ethical authority and responsibility. Christ's position provides by contrast a full and sufficient faith in women's story; the narrative of women's lives demohstrates women's ability to reach moral resolution through the telling and inter- preting of their stories, factual and imaginative, individually and collec- tively. Thus, Christ's work is a contribution to the fulfillment of one of the "mottos" of women's studies, Muriel Rukeyser's question: "What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? / The world would split open."'0 In Diving Deep and Surfacing, Christ applies the methods of story theology to twentieth-century women's literary texts to understand the central aspects of women's lives, thus articulating methodologically what Rukeyser expressed poetically." Judith Plaskow published the first instance, now much anthologized, of contemporary women's intentional mythmaking, the expression in religious practice of the feminist story theology set forth by Christ. It was a retelling, and thereby a revitalizing, of the Hebrew myth of Lilith in a different idiom and with a different outcome, a transformation of the story about enmity between Lilith and Eve in their vying for the atten- tion of Adam into one describing cooperation, affection, and bonding between the two women. In 1980 Plaskow published Sex, Sin and Grace: Women's Experience and the Theologies of Reinhold Neibuhr and Paul Tillich, in which she does for theology the groundwork task needed in any discipline gaining a feminist framework: noting past neglect of women on the one hand and distortion of women by male bias on the other. Constructively criticizing the works of two male giants of mid-twentieth- century American theology, she makes the familiar feminist argument that their scholarship, specifically their doctrines of sin and grace, gen- eralized from Western male experience. Using as inspiration the writ- ings of Valerie Saiving and Doris Lessing, she argues that women's 9. Carol P.

Kolbenschlag de- mythologizes familiar fairy tales to show their misogyny and the perva- sive cultural attitudes they indicate. She presents a constructive proposal for restructuring religious belief to eradicate those attitudes and to in- clude a full measure of women's reality. Her book makes fresh and excellent use of what was an early method in American studies, her field of training: the delineation of "image, myth and symbol" as interpreters of cultural values. Yet it is first of all feminist and theologically original, and it ends with a proposal for a new mythology on behalf of women.13 These works in feminist theology raise in yet another form a ques- tion long debated not only in theology but in other areas as well, Can a committed participant in a cause also serve as its scholar? This question, relevant also in feminist social history, in anthropology, and in literary criticism, is particularly salient for feminist theologians who work out of a double commitment to their feminism and their particular form of religious belief or practice. The distinction between these two motives may be somewhat easier to make when, as in reformist Christian and Jewish works, feminist ideas are used to critique or expand a previously defined subject. One premise, the boundaries of the field, at least re- mains constant when a new viewpoint is espoused. Such differentiation becomes more problematic when both the subject matter and the ground rules for studying it have changed-as they have in the kind of work being done by Kolbenschlag, Plaskow, Christ, Goldenberg, Daly, and Ruether.14 Still another form of excellent feminist scholarship about women's religion results when the field remains constant but the point of depar- ture, the feminist premise, is the experienced feminism of the author. Such scholars are direct about their affinity to feminism and acknowl- edge its importance in their choice of women as subject of their research. Yet their treatment of their subject matter is descriptive and in- 12. Judith Plaskow, "Applesource," in Koltun, ed.

Landes despaired of their personal engagement in their work without seeing, in my view, that that itself is a feminist element, that that is what is new about their methodol- ogy.

Porterfield adroitly reveals the submerged current of uniquely womanly religiousness in America's history, especially through case studies of women of artistic genius such as Emily Dickinson, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Martha Graham. She effectively develops a thesis that his- torically American women's spirituality has been formed by the lives women lived-which were in contrast to men's lives. On more abstract religious theory itself, three recent books address the nature of God as female: Carol Ochs's Behind the Sex of God, Joan Chamberlain Engelsman's The Feminine Dimension of the Divine, and Judith Ochshorn's The Female Experience and the Nature of the Divine.15 All three books start from the new feminist premise, which is acknowledged as personal for their authors, but deal with the religious subject matter of the nature of the divine as feminine, or of the divine as inclusive of female experience, with traditional scholarly objectivity. Historical and Cultural Studies A more detached, but still deliberately feminist, effort is to re- interpret or bring out the spiritual content of women's history, whether that be the history of women's contributions and women's participation in historically identified religious groups or the reverential discovery of what women's lives were like in the past in order to provide example, enrichment, and power to contemporary women. Originally a thematic issue of the American Quarterly, Women in American Religion, edited by Janet Wilson James, is an excellent collection of studies by first-rate women's historians and American religious historians. The editor's overview is a fine summary of a subject on which we do not yet have (and badly need) a book-length volume. Two articles in it of particular merit are Mary P. Ryan's "A Women's Awakening: Evangelical Religion and the Families of Utica, New York, 1800-1840" and Barbara Welter's "She Hath Done What She Could: Protestant Women's Missionary Careers in Nineteenth-Century America." A more ambitious book, the first of two parts, is Rosemary Radford Ruether and Rosemary Skinner Keller's Women and Religion in America, which contains original source materials from nineteenth-century writers, as well as good commentary.16 15.

(It is a noteworthy fact that the great majority of this new historical scholarship about women's religion is on the nineteenth century.) Barbara Grizzuti Harrison's Visions of Glory: A History and A Memory of the Jehovah's Witnesses is an evocative personal memoir as well as a history of an interesting indigenous American sect. Its blend of the personal and the historical is similar in effect to Carol Christ's approach in her theological works, in which the method and the subject matter form original feminist insights. A significant study of women in marginal American religious groups is Mary Farrell Bed- narowski's "Outside the Mainstream." She writes that Shakerism, Spiri- tualism, Christian Science, and Theosophy were "characterized by (1) a perception of the divine that deemphasizes the masculine, (2) a temper- ing or denial of the doctrine of the Fall, (3) a denial of the need for a traditional ordained clergy, and (4) a view of marriage which does not hold that marriage and motherhood are the only acceptable role for women." Not necessarily feminist in its intent and of only modest significance in the new genre of psychobiography, a book nevertheless interesting for its topic, is Mary Baker Eddy by Julius Silberger, Jr. It is the author's thesis that Eddy's achievement can better be understood through new interpretation of trauma in her relationships in her mid- life. The fourth, Ruth Bordin's Women and Temperance, is an issue- focused study of the strong religious dimension of the women's temper- ance campaign. 7 Practice and Reflection Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion, an anthology based on the premises of an experiential method, provides a useful typology both of the movement and of the work engendered by it. The editors, Carol P. Christ and Judith Plaskow, acknowledge "experience as a new norm" and classify women whose works they present into two types: reformists who want to reshape the religious traditions out of which they come in order to include women's experience, and revolutionaries who Women and Religion in America, vol. 1, The Nineteenth Century: A Documentary History (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981). 17.

The book also serves as an important source both of theological writing and of spiritual cele- bration.18 As Christ and Plaskow point out, the practice of a new spiri- tuality for women includes many feminists who wish to remain within forms of Christianity and Judaism, and much scholarship reflects ways to reform and reinterpret Judaism and Christianity. Plaskow identifies herself as a "Jewish feminist." She is an articulate and thoughtful defender of Judaism against the use of Christian feminism as an anti-Jewish weapon.19 Claiming that "all religions are patriarchal," while acknowledging that "the Christian feminists are ten years ahead of us [Jewish feminists]," she decries the ignorant and superficial manner in which the "Jesus was a feminist"20 arguments can be used as feminist anti-Semitism and can drive a new wedge between women by recasting an old bigotry. Along with Plaskow there are several nationally prominent feminist scholars who are equally faithful in practice and thought to both their Judaism and their feminism. Prominent among them is Rita Gross, who has been interested in incorporating the notion of the goddess into con- temporary religious practice.21 One of the contributors to Beyond Androcentrism, a volume edited by Gross, is Rachel Adler, who was a very early leader in the Jewish feminist movement.

Russell, who in 1974 wrote the definitive feminist interpretation of Christian liberation theology, "Liberation Theology in a Feminist Per- spective," has a recent book entitled The Future of Partnership. 27 In it, she recasts from a biblical framework the possibilities for feminist transfor- mations of lives and social institutions by women and men together. Phyllis Trible, well-known for her 1973 article "On Depatriarchalizing in Biblical Interpretation," has written a book of"feminist hermeneutics" (biblical textual criticismi) called God and the Rhetoric of Sexuality.28 A reputable collection of the treatment-of-women-in-the-tradition genre is available in Elizabeth Clark and Herbert Richardson's Women and Religion. Feminist evangelical literature is well represented by Virginia Ramey Mollencott, author of Women, Men and the Bible and, recently, of Speech, Silence, Action! She also effectively spoke in an evangelical lan- guage to lesbian and gay concerns in Is the Homosexual My Neighbor?29 These works all articulate the Christian feminist experience of their authors while retaining traditional frameworks of thought. Other feminists have formed their own spiritual organizations or sought personal expressions of religiousness. One such movement seeks inspiration through a search for the ancient goddesses or the Great Goddess of prehistory. Another practices new forms of witchcraft or paganism. Still another creates a goddess worship out of contemporary feminist self-understanding. At times these three threads of search are blended into one effort, most commonly called "Wicca," or sometimes "the womanspirit movement." Still another feminist spirituality contrasts with Wicca in that it does not name a deity or seek to reincorporate lost ancient belief or practice but builds solely on present experience, texts, facts, and understanding of women. Related and very important to all feminist religiousness is the finding of texts suitable for the generation of modern myth and for spiritual guidance. Here contemporary women's literature and arts and the reinvigoration of past women's literary and artistic works provide both inspiration and models. 27. Letty M.

There is so much from which to choose, so many genres, such an array of good literature, that the choice of what to discuss becomes personal and experiential for me. Were I being banished to the proverbial desert island with a copy of only one such text, it would be Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.30 Dillard's book is the clearest example I can provide of a literary text embodying the writer's own experience verbalized in an overtly spiritual language. We may call Dillard a mystic, if we understand mysticism newly, for, though her idiom is scientific and modern, her quest is to know with transparency, to know in an intimate fusion of self and subject. Her subject is nature along Tinker Creek in Virginia-as well as her experiencing self. In the book her piercing, interior, relentless sense of union between nature and woman, her fiery, holy fury and peace, her exact botanical description inexorably declare philosophical truth and exhibit the feminist theoreti- cal premise that knowing and living are one. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a kind of journal spanning a seasonally changing year. The author-not the "speaker" as we used to designate literary voices-is determined to know nature inside out, all there is to know, in that one spot, beside Tinker Creek, and inside herself. The result is brilliant: a pulsating, scientific, God-revealing (hers is not a goddess), humanistic, illogical, pictorial, spiritual autobiography. While some of my friends and stu- dents hate it, baffled by its strange mixture of utter pessimism, ecstasy, and-in the end-neutrality, the book in my opinion shows us the world as it truly is: hostile or glowing, as you see it. What there is is what you make of it. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is to Thoreau's Walden31 as Willa Cather's Song of the Lark is to James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist and as Sarah Orne Jewett's Country of the Pointed Firs is to Herman Melville's Moby Dick: a womanlyjourney into a womanly place, as authentic and real as the more celebrated manly place. Dillard's is the most self-consciously spiritual journey. Her particular heritage is Christian, but her illumination is entirely her own. The works of other contemporary writers such as Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Tillie Olsen, May Sarton, and Maya Angelou offer the constant, challenging pleasure of spiritual insight, but for me the most striking perception is that of Alice Walker. She links womanhood and spirituality through her black female ancestors: "These grandmothers and mothers of ours were not 'Saints,' but Artists [gardeners]; . . . They 30.

Guided by my heritage of a love of beauty and a respect for strength-in search of my mother's garden, I found my own."32 High also on my personal list of major works is a poem by Robin Morgan called "Piecing," in which she draws all her images from the woman's work of quilting: "Frugality is not the point. Nor waste. / It's just that very little is discarded / in any honest spending of the self, / and what remains is used and used / again, worn thin by use."33 Collections of religious celebrations also fit the category of litera- ture, for they represent the ritual enactment of understood story and myth. Penelope Washbourn put together songs, poetry, ritual, prayer, myth, and story from many traditions in Seasons of Woman. Starhawk wrote about and illustrated contemporary goddess worship in The Spiral Dance. Central to it is the casting of the circle of witchcraft to the Great Goddess: "She remembers who she is" is said of each participant.34 It is out of women's stories that we have acted, out of women's stories-real and imagined, historical, literary, and theoretical-that women have begun to make sense anew out of women's lives. Such validation of experience is a place to begin and a place to end religiously. In no place other than in spirituality is the need more vivid for Rukeyser's directive that women tell the truth about their own lives. All those I have mentioned, along with other women and men, are begin- ning to piece together that truth. Robin Morgan knows that it is a patch- work, and that is as it should be.
