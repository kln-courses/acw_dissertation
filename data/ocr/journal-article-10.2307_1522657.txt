It tells of the founding of the Burmese city, Paga'n, in the dry zone of central Burma: how it became the Buddhist capital of a united Burma, including Mons and Burmans, from about io6o A.D.; and how, after a glorious century of building- national character as well as pagodas, a sudden crisis, due to Singhalese invasion, led to a weakening of the union, but also to the efflorescence of a strictly Burmese culture in the latter half of the dynasty. The 'head' (as originally planned and written) would have told what little we know of the earlier history of Burma from Negrito times: the coming of Mons, Malayans, Indians; the Sak-Kantit; the Nan-chao empire in the north; the founding of the first Pyu Buddhist capital (638 A.D.) at Sr Ksetra, at the head of the Irawady delta; the sack of their northern capital, Halin, in 832 A.D.; and finally the descent of the Burmans (Mranmd) from the eastern hills to the plains, and their first kingdom, Tam- badfpa, in Central Burma, based on the meagre ricelands there - the ii kharuin of Kyaukse and the 6 kharuin of Minbu. The whole story was too long, we felt: too discrepant in scale, too full of gaps. For while we know a good deal about gri Ksetra and Paga'n, research into the pre-history of Burma is only beginning; and many old capitals and cities in Arakan, North Burma, and South Burma remain unexplored. The 'feet' - i.e. the later history of Paga'n, based on the large and solid foundation of over 5oo stone inscriptions, with temples, pagodas and monasteries too numerous to count, is certainly ripe for telling: but the writing, all Burmese, is so different in style and content from the meagre records of the earlier period, mostly written in Mon, that it seems best to reserve it for a separate volume. This 'torso' treatment necessitates some awkward compromise. - Our present work is divided into three Parts:- (A) History in a narrow sense (pp. I-I28), based on the few original inscriptions and other records, contemporary or late. (B) Iconography (pp. I29-227), which seeks to relate the arts of Early Paga'n to those of Buddhist India. (C) Architecture (pp. 228-422), where the local evidence is plain and ample, but mostly undocu- mented; and not so abundant as it will be in the later Pagan period, where many of the pagodas are not only more or less intact, but have a dated inscription in situ telling their origin. There are striking differences in the architecture of the two periods; but there is a common root, and more similarity than difference. So that although Chapter XII, our General Survey of Pagain archi-</page><page sequence="6">viii PREFACE tecture, is based partly on written evidence fifty or a hundred years later than the buildings we describe, the buildings are there to prove that there is no serious anachronism. In Part B, where we discuss the Indian origin of art-motifs in early Pagan, it would never do to jump the intermediate links - whether at ?r4 Ksetra (Old Prome), Rdmain-nadesa (Lower Burma), or Dvdravatf (Old Siam). We hope, therefore, that the reader will be indulgent when we wander from the period in hand (IIth-I2th century A.D.) into the future or the past. * * * I am solely responsible for the writing of this book, and for the opinions expressed in it; but I could not have done it without precious help from many quarters. My colleague, Bo-hmu (Colonel) Ba Shin, has given me invaluable aid, especially since i955, when he joined the Burma Historical Commission. Whether in discovering new inscriptions or checking the readings of old ones, recording languages, or organizing work on maps, plans, drawings, etc., he has done his utmost to help his old 'Saya', now aged nearly eighty. We seldom differ, I think, in our main conclusions; and where we do, I have been careful to state both points of view. In difficult readings of stone or ink inscriptions, I have learnt to trust his eyes and judgement more than my own. Before the last War, when I was first asked to write this book, I was limited to a maximum of i0 plates or illustrations. The offer came to nothing. Hearing of this, Dr. Alfred Salmony, late lamented Editor of Artibus Asiae, wrote to me, shortly before his death, the kindest of letters, offering to publish it, with broad pages and a more liberal allowance of plates than I had dreamed of. I stipulated that the Burma Archaeological Department should be invited to supply the plates. This brought in a priceless contribution, for which I cannot adequately express my gratitude to successive Directors of the Burma Archaeological Survey:- To U Mya, a sure guide and trusted doyen of Burma archaeologists, who joined the Department soon after it was founded in i902; and who, since then, has often said the first word about its manifold discoveries, and not seldom (I think) the last. To U Lu Pe Win, Mon and Pali scholar, whose prompt and brave action during the last War in burying the smaller antiquities at the time of the Japanese invasion, saved both them and the Department's priceless collection of photo-negatives. To U Po Lat, whose devotion to Burmese epigraphy and language began long before his short spell as Director. And finally to the present incumbent, U Aung Thaw, whose careful yearly excavations are steadily enlarging our knowledge of the proto-historical period. Nor can I fail to mention my great debt to the pioneers of the Department: to the German Dr. Emil Forchhammer, who died before it was founded, but laid a reliable foundation. To the Chinese Taw Sein Ko, who joined the French General de Beylie in first excavating trl Ksetra. And to the Frenchman Charles Duroiselle, a great scholar and epigraphist, who directed the Department for a score of years. Archaeology in Burma has never been adequately supplied with staff or funds. One recalls, for instance, that when, in I94I, U Lu Pe Win wanted to excavate Tadagale, one of the old sites near Rangoon, he was given Rs. 200/- to cover all expenses! And the opening of the still older site at Kyaik D6-ap (Botahtaung) pagoda, was due, not to Government action, but to an enemy's bomb. In spite of this, as I know by years of close contact, no Department has served Burma more</page><page sequence="7">PREFACE ix loyally or fruitfully than Archaeology. Of the I937 prints and drawings published in this book, 755 have been supplied by the Archaeological Department. These sometimes include the sole surviving record, the originals being lost. We are privileged also to publish here many measured drawings, groundplans, sections, elevations, and precious eye-copies of paintings, all made by the Department. U Htwe Sein, Archaeological Engineer, as well as his artist son and the staff of Paga'n Museum, have done us innumerable kindnesses. U Htwe Sein, in particular, has contributed 9 plans and measured drawings to this volume. U Khin Maung Zaw, late Archivist to the Burma Historical Commission, also managed, in his spare time, to contribute 289 prints, as well as most of the prints of votive tablets (Pls. 6 to 74) now at Mandalay Archaeological Office. But ever since the War, conditions have been difficult for amateur photographers in Burma. Owing to limitations on foreign imports, art-photography has been, for civilians at least, almost impossible, what with lack of suitable cameras, lenses, and all kinds of photo- graphic equipment. Year-old film, poor quality paper - even 'hypo' was sometimes unobtainable. Mr. Alexander Griswold, the well-known scholar of Siamese and Buddhist art, who, since Dr. Sal- mony's death, has taken over the steering of this book, and raising its illustrations to the high standard of Ari6bus Asiae, has been indefatigable in his help and wise advice. From M. Lavaud, the famous French photographer, he has obtained 3I prints of excellent quality. But perhaps his greatest dis- covery was in Burma itself - the amateur Burmese photographer, U Tin Oo, Assistant Editor of the Burma Translation Department. To U Tin Oo's devoted patriotism and brilliant artistry we owe no less than 605 of our best prints. In matters of scholarship my primary debt has been to my first teacher in Old Mon, pioneer both in that language and in Pyu, the late Dr. C. 0. Blagden. To his memory this book is dedicated. To his worthy successor in Mon studies at the London School of Oriental and African Studies, Mr. H. L. Shorto, author of A Dictionary of Modern Spoken Mon (i962, Oxford University Press), I am also deeply indebted. In Pali, I have relied on my brother-in-law, Dr. Pe Maung Tin, late Chairman of the Burma Historical Commission, and first translator of the Visuddhimagga; also on the late lamented Professor of Pali at Rangoon University, Ahmed Cassim. In Burmese, I am obliged to many scholars: most of all to my colleague U Wun ('Minthuwun'), poet and lexicographer, whose help has been an inspiration as well as a guide. Another colleague, Daw Thin Kyi, Professor of Geography, has also helped, both in making maps and plans, and inadvising on them. ShehasoftencomewithustoPaganand elsewhere, and checked the position of ancient monuments. A brilliant guide and generous consultant, especially on Indian texts, has been the archaeologist Mon Bo Kay, Conservator of Paga'n. On contacts with Ceylon, I have had the privilege of consulting the veteran archaeologist, Dr. S. Parana- vitana. I am of course deeply indebted to the staff of the Burma Historical Commission, and its successive Chairmen, U Kaung, Dr. Htin Aung, U Thein Han and Dr. Pe Maung Tin. Our draughtsman, Maung Bo Hlaing, in particular, has contributed 24 careful plans. Successive Governments of Burma have given financial aid; and wherever we went on tour, from Arakan to Kengtung, from Myitkyina to Tenasserim, the Burma military and civil officials have done their utmost to escort, protect and entertain us. This was at times no sinecure when we had to enter rebel areas.</page><page sequence="8">X PREFACE To do justice to Pagain, its history, art and architecture, has been our single aim. A large number of plates was therefore needed, with a high standard of reproduction and so of costs. Mr. John D. Rockefeller has long been known, not only as a lover of Oriental Art in general, but, in particular, of Pagain. I can speak from personal knowledge of his constant anxiety to help and encourage us. Without the generous subvention given by the JDR III Fund, this book could not have been published. Further liberal grants have also been made by the Breezewood Foundation and by Cornell University. Our thanks are due no less to the editors of Artibus Asiae and the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, from Dr. Salmony onwards: especially to Mr. Alexander Griswold, who has been a constant friend and tower of strength from first to last. We are grateful to Mrs. M. L. Howard, Mr. Griswold's secretary, for taking charge of all the typing. We are grateful to our very competent publishers, Messrs. J. J. Augustin, of Locust Valley and Glickstadt, and to Miss C. L. Flesch, of Artibus Asiae, Ascona, who has generously cooperated over a long period of years. Finally, we remember, with honour and gratitude, the people of Paga'n in Burma: with gratitude, for their perennial sweetness and welcome. Among many, many helpers, let me only cite my first guide and guru, the late U Tha Hnint of Pyaukseikpin village. We remember the people of Paga'n with honour, for the constant daily provision they have made over 9oo years, out of their poverty, for the maintenance of the thousand living monuments of their Religion. Pagan is not a dead city. GORDON H. LUCE</page><page sequence="9">TABLE OF CONTENTS Part A .

Strongest in the deltas near the coast, where they grew their irrigated rice, they had contacts with India from very early times. Their language, which is akin to Khmer and the pre-Vietnamese dialects of the Annamite Chain, is distantly allied to Indonesian, and quite different from Burmese or Pyu, which are Tibeto- Burman. In 638 A.D. the Pyu, descending from the north-east, founded the first big Buddhist capital of Burma, Sri Ksetra. This was near modern Prome, above the head of the Irawady delta, 200 miles from the sea. The last Sri Ksetra king whose name we know, died in 7i8 A.D. Some time later, it seems, the city fell; and the Pyu fell back on Upper Burma, making their new capital Hahn, io miles south of Shw~bo. On their way north, some Pyu refugees are said to have settled near Paga6n - a group of small villages on the left bank of the Irawady, i8o miles north of Sri Ksetra. Pagan is in the Dry Zone of Central Burma, below the mouth of the Chindwin, at the point where the Irawady, after flowing in a south-westerly direction from Mandalay, turns finally south towards the sea. In 832 and 835 A.D. Halin, the Pyu capital in the north, and Mi-ch'6n, the chief Mon city in the south, were sacked by Nan-chao, the imperial lords of Yang-chti-mieh (Ta-li) on the high plateau of Western Yfinnan. The dominant peoples of Nan-chao were probably Lolo, speaking languages closely akin to Burmese. The Burmans, Mranmd, then subject to Nan-chao, and forced to fight Nan-chao's battles from Ch'eng-tu to Hanoi, took their chance to break away, and descend upon the hot malarious plains, where Nan-chao durst not follow them except on a cold-weather raid. The Mranmd occupied the two irrigated rice-granaries of the Dry Zone: Kyaukse (8o miles north north-east of Paga'n) and Minbu (60 miles south of it). They called them respectively the Eleven Kharuin and the Six Kharutin: kharuin meaning the core or hub from which government radiates. In 850, it is said, they built the walls of Pagan. It was then the advance-centre, rather than the capital, of Tambadipa, the first king- dom of the Burmans in Central Burma.....

DESCRIPTION Compared to the fertile kharuin areas, Kyaukse and Minbu, Paga'n is almost a desert. It is "the parched country", Tattadesa, of Old Mon inscriptions1. Apart from the strange eroded ravines above Nyaung-u, Pagan is just a sandy windswept plain, strewn with bright pebbles and fossil wood, and sparsely shadowed by low, straining, thorny trees: euphorbia, osyris, jujube, cutch, and beautiful white-barked acacia. A few big trees, tamarind and Indian elm and bombax, tower magnificent where there is subsoil water; also the toddy-palm, palmyra; and some of the humbler plants flower prettily enough, but are too dry for fodder, or exude blistering milk or sticky stain, or put forth pincer-thorns or little caltrop heads with barbs. No rice is grown except on islands and the riverbanks. The chief crops today are groundnut, sor- ghum, panick millet, sesamum, a little maize, a few beans, water-melon and cucumber. Maize and groundnut (Arachis) have come in recent centuries from America: otherwise the landscape can have changed little since the iith century. Reasons alleged to prove a change of climate, from mentions of broad ricelands in the inscriptions, will not bear inspection2. There is no rice-cultivation mentioned in Old Burmese around Paga'n, on more than a quite modest scale. At presentthe whole area3, some 25 square miles, supports a small riverine town and port, Nyaung-u; Paga'n, a large village, centre of the lacquer industry; the small villages of Wet-kyi-in, Myinpagan and Thiripyitsaya, where sandy streambeds discharge into the river; and inland the poor hamlets of Hnget-pyit-taung, Minnanthu, and East and West Pwazaw. Some thirty miles away to east south-east, clean cut against the dawn, rises the extinct volcanic cone of Popa, almost 5000 feet. Beyond the river as it bends from west to south, Mount Tan-kyi rears its massif and its noble crest I500 ft. against the setting sun. Eight miles south-east, there rises to the height of over a thousand feet the narrow ridge of hills now called Tuywin-daung. The nearer peaks, Turain 'the Arch' and Sakcuiw (Thetso) 'Ruler of the Sak (Thets)', are often mentioned in the inscriptions4. 1 Tattades. Epig. Birm. Vol. I, Part II, Inscr.

There are many variants in the lists; and none of the names except Noli-it (Nyaung-u) occur in Old Burmese. But there are several marks of ancientry around Tuywin-daung, as we shall see. With the same facility as that which often led new converts to Buddhism to transplant the sacred sites to their immediate neighbourhood, the Burmans soon transferred to Shak-pac-toi6, 'Hill where the Bird was shot', the P'iao-chfi-ti legend of Nan-chao. DATE OF FOUNDING When was Pagan founded? - "In this our country of Burma" says Shin Silavamsa7 (I453-I520), the first historian of Burma whose work survives, "when ioo years were complete after the passing of the Buddha, the place for the establishment of the Religion was the kingdom of Sarekhettard (sr! Ksetra) ... The kingdom of Sarekhettard was established for 6oo years. The kings were 25, beginning from Twattapon. When 700 years were complete after the passing of the Buddha, there came into existence the kingdom of Pagan, called Arimaddand. The kingdom of Pagan was established for ii28 years. The kings were 50, beginning from Pyu-mand's", i.e. Pyusawhti, "down to Tarupprefimait:" (Tarok-pye-min, 'the king who fled from the Turks'). Silavarhsa's meaning appears to be that grl Ksetra was founded in 444 B.C. It fell; and Pagan was founded about I56 A.D. Paga'n fell in i284 A.D. - If this last date is that of Tarokpye's flight from Pagan after the fatal battle of Nga-hsaung-chan (there are several variant readings in the manu- scripts), it is exactly right8. But Silavarhsa's huge mistake was to place the fall of 8ri Ksetra and the founding of Pagan six and seven hundred years before they actually occurred. The Pyu urn inscrip- tions show the Vikrama dynasty still reigning at 8ri Ksetra as late as 7i8 A.D.9. The Glass Palace Chronicle (p. 55) places the building of Paga'n in 849-850. It can scarcely have been earlier. It can hardly have preceded the Nan-chao raids of 832 and 83510; and Paga'n is not mentioned in the list of Pciao (i.e. Pyu) towns and settlements in 80211. There is an authority older than Silavarisa for the dating of Srl Ksetra. King Kyanzittha, about IIOO A.D., makes the Buddha prophesy the founding of the city in the very year of his parinirvsna12 - 544 B.C., according to Old Burmese reckoning; and he makes Gavampati foretell that "it shall 5Lists of the i9 villages are given in the Jatat6pum Rajavan (Zatabon, ed. by U Hla Tin, Rangoon, I960), p. 92; U Kala Mahayazawingyi (ed. by Saya Pwa, Rangoon, I959), Vol. 1, p. I35; and the Glass Palace Chronicle (see transl. p. 29). Common to all are the following II villages:- Nyaung-u, Ma-gyi, Kyauk-saga (mod. Lokananda), Nyaungwun, Anuradha, Kyinlo, Kokko, Taungba, My6gedwin, Y6n-hlut, and Ywasaik. For excavations in the neighbourhood, see A.S.I. I906, pp. I3I-3 and P1.

Publ. Series No. I4 (Burmese), edited by Pe Maung Tin, p. 77. 8 The Yiian-shih (ch. I3), and the anonymous text translated by Huber (BEFEO t.

III C3-6.</page><page sequence="22">6 Chapter I stand for twelve hundred years"'3, i.e. until about 656 A.D. This is much nearer the truth; but it is still over 6o years too soon. The later Chronicles are all at sea and inconsistent about the founding of Paga'n'4. They mostly date the accession of Samuddhardja from 8o to io7 A.D., and of Pyusawhti 6o years later. They are just as wrong as Silavarhsa. On the other hand, they place the building of Pagan in 849-850, which may be right. These mistakes appear to stem from a desire to raise the status and antiquity of the Burmese capital at the expense of the Pyu. Much padding therefore was necessary to eke out the odd 700 years. - The names of the first five successors of Pyusawhtil5,though legendary, are old: fortheybear the authentic stamp of the Nan-chao system of child-naming: - Pyu-saw-hti, Hti-min-yin, Yin-min-paik, Paik-thin-li, Thin-li-kyaung, Kyaung-durit. We are then introduced to the august spirits of Mt. Popa, the Mahdgiri Nats brother and sister, who dominate the plain and still sit as natural guardians, left and right, of Tharaba Gate, the main entrance to Pagan. Buddhaghosa next makes his appearance, the scene shifting to India and Ceylon. For the rest (see G.P.C. pp. 50-55), there is little but a barren list of kings and omens, with doublets such as the two Saw Rahans and Thin-li-kyaungs, Paik-thin-li and Thin-li-paik, Khanlaung-Khanlat, Htunpit-Htunchit, Peitthon-Peittaung, Htuntaik-Htuntwin, Shwelaung-Shwehmauk, etc. The Chronicle Jdtdt6pu* Rajavai (Zatabon) is generally our best guide in the dating of early Pagan: which makes its muddle at this point (see note I4) all the more remarkable. The underlying truth may well be that before the Mranmd conquerors of Tambadipa built the walls of Pagan in 850 A.D., there was an older Pyu settlement there, perhaps of Pyu refugees retreating north after the fall of Arl Ksetra. These Pyu, perhaps, were the builders of the oldest Pagan stupas, cylindrical or bulbous, such as the Bfipaya on the riverbank (P1. I05 a). CITY WALL AND MOAT Apart from these, the oldest extant monument at Pagan is doubtless the city-wall. Compared to that of 8ri Ksetra, the area enclosed is small, less than a square mile, excluding not only the pagodas of Nyaung-u, Wet-kyi-in, Myinpagan, Minnanthu, Pwazaw, etc., but also many of Pagan itself. At 8ri Ksetra, more than half the area within the wall was rice-field, intended to support the population in time of siege. Since rice will not grow at Pagan except in the riverbed, there was no reason to extend the walled area. "The date of this wall" said Duroiselle161" is about 850 A.D., the year of the foundation of Pagan; it is still clearly visible, together with the moat, on three sides of the ancient city; the fourth side, which ran along the river bank, has disappeared owing to the encroachment of the river; on this side, a kind of bastion can be seen quite near to the Circuit House, and a few traces of the wall are seen here and there." 13 Epig. Birm. I, Part II, Inscr. I F14-15. 14 Thus the jatat6puth Rajavah, which on pp. 41 and 54 gives 21I s./85o A.D. as the date for the building of "the present city of Pagan", on p. 53 gives I12 Mahd-Sakard-ja/igo A.D. for the building, by Pyuminhti, of "the city of ArimaddanA". 15 G.P.C. pp. 43-46. It was Pelliot who first noted the undoubted connection between the Old Burmese and the Nan-chao system of naming: see BEFEO t. IV, I904, pp. i65-6. 16 A.S.I. 1913, p. 136, no. 3.</page><page sequence="23">Chapter I 7 Away from the Irawady, water was always scarce at Pagan. To fill the city-moat it was necessary to breach the bank beyond the walls, and divert part of the river to enclose it. The upper breach was originally made northwest of Bu-paya, where the remaining wall is still high. High, too, here is the outer bank of the moat, I00 to I50 feet broad, running from west to east. There is an old city-gate at the point where a road descends to the main landing-place west of the derelict hotel. The wall here is about 30 ft. above the road, the upper half of coursed masonry, the lower half of earth. The back fence of the hotel runs along the top almost to the northeast corner of the city. Here wall and moat turn sharp to the south. From the top of the wall there is a good view, perhaps 40 feet below, of the moat some I50 feet broad, running from north to south, and now full of culti- vation. This continues as far as the road to Taungbi village, between Wut-kyin Gu and Zaungdan-gyi pagoda. Thereafter the moat is drier and less defined, and the wall lower, with lines of huts peering on the inner side, as far as Tharaba (Sarapd) Gate17. This chief remaining gateway, with four massive cubes of brick and vaulting between them, still guards the main eastern exit towards Nyaung-u. In its present form it dates, we suspect, from the beginning of Kyanzittha's reign (I084 A.D.). The thick- ness of the original wall at this point is i24 feet. It runs on south to another old gateway west of Nanda temple. Sharp turns in the masonry here indicate that there were once projecting bastions, guarding both sides of the gate. Heavy rain will still fill this section of the moat: the general effect, with Nanda temple mirrored in it, is shown on PI. 265 - a sight which must have gladdened the heart of the donor, king Kyanzittha, gazing from the roof of his new palace (II02 A.D.) on the inner side of the walls. Descending to the moat, one can follow the base of the wall as far as the sharp corner where it turns finally west. Here it is still high and vertical, with (what looks like) several small salients. On the inner side is Thatbyinnyu monastery and its stone bell-pillars (Pls. 379, 380). Thatbyinnyu temple, 2i2 feet high, built c. II55 A.D., dominates this southeast corner; the wall describes a large irregular arc to circumvent it. A road from the temple now cuts through the wall to the south. To the south-southwest there is a broad bastion and several salients, as the wall falls gradually back to its proper east-west orientation, due south of the Visnu temple, Nat-hlaung- gyaung. South of Pahtothamya temple it sinks to ground-level for a moment, with a path crossing it; then runs due west as far as the south road to Chauk. Here there was an old gateway, shown by the clean walling. West of this, except for a pathway cutting through to Taung-ywa-le hamlet, the wall is still fairly high; also the further bank of the moat, now dropping rapidly towards the river. The wall ends in a rough cliff west of the Circuit-house, just above the highwater mark. There is now no sign of a bend northwards. The brickwork visible along the riverbank seems to be local, the residue of fallen pagodas. The East and South sides of the city-wall are at right angles to each other, and about the same length, nearly three quarters of a mile. The North side, also at right angles, is only half that length. If we may assume that the original shape was roughly square, it is clear that erosion by the river has been serious in the north-west quarter. Now our early archaeologists who built Pagan Museum, and filled three sides of its verandah with a double line of stone inscriptions, collected nearly 30 of these 17 PI. i68. The following note is kindly supplied by Professor U Wun: "Sarapca Gate is mentioned at least twice in U Kala's Mahayazawin-gyi: Vol. I, para 324 (at Pagan), and para. 437 (at Ava). At p. 203 the Gate is called Sarapaka; in the Myadaung Sayadaw's Pagdn-myo-paya-tasS-khunasu Thamaing ('Story of I 7 Pagodas of Pagan'), it is written Sarapaka. According to the Tajjattha-dfpan1 (p. 9i) of Hle-thin-atwinwun Mahajeyyasafikhaya, the name is derived from semi-Sanskrit sarva-tankd, "defending from all enemies".</page><page sequence="24">8 Chapter I from the Mahabodhi temple-enclosure. Their dates mostly relate to the earlier half of the period: they have nothing to do with the Mahdbodhi itself. It seems likely that they were shifted thither, as to a place of safety, when erosion threatened the small river-bank pagodas to which they belonged. Perhaps many more were sunk or buried. And of those that remain, half the historical value is now lost, since we do not know to what they refer. This is one of the reasons for our scanty knowledge of the first half of the Pagan period18. FIRST MENTIONS The oldest mentions of Pagan by name, curiously enough, are in two Cham inscriptions of Phan- rang (PRnduranga), the Po-Nagar and Lom-ng6 pillars19, anterior to I050 A.D. In the former the name is written Pukam, in the latter Pukdm. In Old Mon it is written Pokdm, Pukdm, and possibly Bukdm; the earliest mention is under date I093 A.D.20. In Old Burmese (first mention: ii96 A.D.), it is usually written Puka* or Pukam21. Its classical name everywhere is Arimaddana, 'Crushing of Enemies'22. The Chu-fan-chih of Chao Ju-kua (I225 A.D.) mentions an early embassy of "P'u-kan kingdom" to the Sung capital, Kcai-feng, in I004 A.D.23: -"In the ist year of the ching-te period of the reigning dynasty (I004 A.D.), they sent envoys, together with San-fo-chci [Sri Vijaya, Palembang] and Ta- shih kingdom [Thjik, Arabs] to submit tribute at Court. They had the good fortune to witness the lamp (-festival) on the I5th day of the ist month" [Feb. 8th, I004]. CAW RAHAN Two kings before Aniruddha whose names we know, can claim to be historical. CAW RAHAN, 'the Royal Saint', is said, in an original inscription (I2I2 A.D.) still in situ on top of Mt. Turan04, to have built a theni' (sTmd) there: that is, a chapter-house for holding the uposatha and ordination ceremonies. That is all we know of him for certain. He was not, presumably, the 'Popa Saw Rahan' of the Chronicles25, wrongly said to have invented the so-called Burmese Era, starting from 638 A.D. That era, almost certainly ,was Pyu in origin, founded by the Vikrama kings of Sri Ksetra26. The 18 On p. 26 of the Preface to I.B. Portfolios IV and V, I ventured a different explanation of the mystery of these 'Shinbin-bodhi' inscriptions. I beg to withdraw it. The new explanation given in the text, I now think much more probable, after studying aerial and other maps of Pagan. Erosion has been more serious than I first imagined. 19 See Aymonier, Journal Asiatique, jan.-fev.

His story there is mostly popular folklore27. A similar tale is found in Cambojan chronicles28, and also, it seems, in Shan and Ceylon fables. His dates are variously given29, his death 43 to 94 years before the accession of Aniruddha. Modern Chronicles represent him as a heretic, a worshipper of Ndgas and mysterious spirits, and a patron of the infamous 'Ari' (aran-:)30. The original inscription, on the other hand, shows him doing an eminently orthodox work of merit, the first necessity for an active Buddhist church. All agree that he was a builder: and a building that lasted from his date (say, the end of the ioth century) till I2I2, over 200 years, was probably of brick or stone. If so, the age of Burmese temple-builders did not begin with Aniruddha. The Chronicles, from U Kala onwards (early i8th century) give Caw Rahan the title Nat-t6- kyoti: takd, "Donor of the Residence of the holy Devas". This kyon: (Tibetan groin, 'residence') has been generally taken to be the Visnu temple now called by the much less honourable title 'Nat-hlaung-gyaung', "Residence confining Devas". The Nat-hlaung-gyaung is an early master- piece of Pagan architecture, situated within the walls between Pahtothamya and Thatbyin- nyu, within a stone's throw of the palace. The remarkably advanced, but still archaic features of this temple, and its Vaisnava connections, will be treated in later chapters (see pp. 2I9-222, 283-284). Personally, I regard it, on the one hand as the last link in the old Vaisnava chain join- ing SrIksetra and Rdmafifadesa with Pagan; on the other as the Pagan prototype of the later 'Mon' temples, from Pahtothamya onwards. Its ultimate connections with north-east India, whether Bengal or Bihar, are also certain, though obscure. The intimate association in Burma, from early times, of Vaisnavism and Buddhism, cannot be doubted. So the fact that Caw Rahan built an orthodox Buddhist sTmd on Tuywindaung, eight miles from Pagan, does not conflict with the tradition that he also built (or allowed his Indian immigrants to build) this fine Visnu temple in the heart of his little kingdom. Of the five pagodas attributed to Saw Rahan in the Chronicles31, only one name can now be recog- nized - the Pahto-thamya, within the walls of Pagan. This temple32, one of the early masterpieces of 'Mon' architecture at Pagan, shows no sign of heresy. On the contrary, it is the first Paga'n temple to reap the harvest of the full texts of Singhalese Tipitaka, obtained (as we shall see) after I070 A.D. It is impossible to date it before the conquests of Aniruddha. Another traditionP, moreover, attributes it to Aniruddha's son, Man Lulan (Saw Lu), who died in i084. 27 See G.P.C. pp. 58-60.

The Arafi: were doubtless Arafiflika or Arafiffavasi, who lived in "jungle monasteries" (Old Burmese taw kloh). Their discipline was not so strict as that of the ordinary monks. Whether they were so bad as they are painted in the later Chronicles, may be doubted. Perhaps they derive from a dim memory of Tantric - Mahayanist practices from East Bengal, together with local Naga-worship, common at Pagan before Kyanzittha made the great change to Singhalese Theravada Buddhism. 31 PAhto-gyi, Pahto-ng&amp;, Pahto-thamya, Thinli-pahto, Seitti-pahto. 32 See Chapter XV, pp. 302-309 and Pls.

The story - largely the truth, it seems - is, briefly, as follows35: - Saw Rahan, a saint perhaps, but a usurper, perished in a palace- rising; and Kunhsaw Kyaungbyu, a scion of the royal line, took his place. He made his queens three sisters, wives of his predecessor, the elder two being pregnant at the time. Their children, Kyizo and Sokkate, grew up jealous of their cousin, Aniruddha, child of the youngest sister by the reigning king. By a trick they deposed Kunhsaw, and made him a monk, presumably in the 'White Monastery'. After Kyizo's death, Sokkate raped Aniruddha's mother. The brave boy, "his mother's milk yet wet upon his lips," raised forces and challenged Sokkate to single combat on horseback. They met, and Sokkate was killed. His corpse, falling into the flooded stream, was lost, and only his horse's saddle recovered: from this, Myinkaba (Mrangaba)36, the stream which flows through Myinpagan, still gets its name. About a furlong north of the stream, must have been the White Monastery, with its standing image of the Buddha set up by KloA-phlii-mait. The son asked his aged father to resume the throne; but he declined in favour of his son. Two hundred years later, the mahdthera Dhammarajaguru37, the beloved teacher and tutor of the young king Natoitmyd and his sister Acau Manlha, built the Myinkaba Kubyauk-nge temple - an early Burmese masterpiece - at the site of the White Monastery, containing Kloit- phli-maA's image. One hundred years later, at the very end of the Pagan period, an ink-inscription38, now faint and fragmentary, was written at the west end of the north wall of the hall of this temple. It says that "in 675 S./1313 A.D. the most excellent lady, Phwd Cau-krs, 'Queen Grandmother'39, in her devotion to the Lord Dhammardjaguru" [donor of the Myinkaba Kubyauk-nge temple], sent on inspection (it seems) the royal secretary, who served her and her then husband, Caw Nac, "Lord of the White Elephant", sc. the Cakravartin. He saw in ruin the standing image of Klon-phlii-man, and took steps to repair it and make permanent provision for its upkeep; and shared the merit with his relatives, including the queen and her deceased husband, the Dethroned King (nan kIa mail). The concluding prayer, half Pali half Burmese, is fragmentary. There is more here than meets the eye. Klon-phlfi-man himself had been a dethroned king, even as Phwd Cau-krf's husband, Kyawzwa (Rhuy-nan-syaA)40. After the Mongol conquest and the poisoning of the runaway king, they had avenged the murder, and done their best, with sympathy and some help from the Mongols, to revive the deserted capital. But the Shan Sihasg had meantime occupied Kyaukse, besieged Pagan, tricked and carried off her husband to Myinzaing, and finally strangled 34 fl. 20 years, 363-383 S./1ooI-21 A.D.

The dedications probably began from Natoftmya's accession, in 573 S./I2II A.D. 38 This ink-inscription is not listed nor edited. I had noted it; but it was first read by Col. Ba Shin, who showed me his readings.

In order to bluff the Mongols, Sfhasfi spared a bastard son of Kyawzwa4l aged i6, married him in haste to the queen, and ceremoniously crowned his puppet "Lord of the White Elephant", or Cakravartin: a cynical act, for he had given himself the same title four years earlier42. Horrified, the old Queen left the Court and lived at Pwazaw (the inland villages still called after her), where she, her daughter and her nephew devoted all their feverish energy to works of merit - the last masterworks of PagAn43. The ink inscription, dated I4 years after her husband's murder, shows her still defiant, the proud Queen "more powerful than thousands of beautiful women" as she liked to be called", queen of the only rightful Cakravartin45. Pagan, as a capital, died with her. At the very end of that tragic, glorious story, her thoughts went back to its beginnings - to that other dethroned king and queen, who had a son to defend them.

REGNAL DATES The primary difficulty in writing the history of Aniruddha is to fix the dates and order of events. The first certain date we know in Paga'n history, based on original stone inscriptions (the so-called 'Myazedi' inscriptions of Rajakumdir), is that of the accession of Kyanzittha: i628 A.B.1, that is 446 s./io84 A.D. - Compare this date with those given in U Kala's Great Chronicle; the Hmannan or Glass Palace Chronicle; and the Zatabon (Jatat6puti) Chronicle, as shown on the Regnal Dates Chart in Vol. II. - The Zatabon gets the date exactly right. The others make it 20 or 2I years too early. Rdjakumdr tells us that when his father Kyanzittha had reigned 28 years, i.e. till 474 S./III2 A.D., he was sick unto death2 (I think he died in III3 A.D.). Here the Zatabon is only about i year wrong, the Hmannan 20, U Kala 24 years wrong. Provisionally, therefore, we accept our earlier dates as given in the Zatabon. I do not think they are far wrong; but there is no certainty about them. For note the wide discrepancies in this Chart. U Kala and the Zatabon give Aniruddha 33 years of reign, the Hmannan 42. The Zatabon gives Aniruddha's son, Saw Lu, 7 years of reign, the Hmannan 5, U Kala 26. And note the discrepancies in the years assigned to Alaungsithu: 56 in the Zatabon, 70 in U Kala, 75 in the Hmannan. I cut this down to about 47 years. The next certain regnal date we know from original inscriptions, is the death of Kula: kya in ii65 A.D.3. Here the Zatabon is 5 years too late, the Hmannan 6 years too late, U Kala 4 years too early. TAMBADIPA My dates, then, for Aniruddha, I044-I077 A.D., are merely provisional. So, to a great extent, is the map of Burma, "Early Pagan Period, at the head of Part A, which gives some idea of Tamba- dfpa, the small original kingdom of the Mranma in Central Burma, as it was when he ascended the throne; also of its great expansion by the time of his death.

In 850 they had built the walls of Pagan6, below the mouth of the Chindwin. In the south, towards Prome, they had seized the rice- plain of Taungdwin-gyi (Tohthwah)7 on the northern edge of Lower Burma. As frontier-post down- river, they held the long KyuIndaw island (Prafitawsd klwan)8 below Migyaung-ye. In the north, they held the east-west line of the Myit-nge (Nam Tu) river and the Irawady, with one rice-rich outpost, Taungbyon (Towplun kharuin)9, a few miles north of Mandalay. North of this, the Thet (Sak) and Kadu (Kantfi) tribes'0 were left at the mercy of Nan-chao. In the "Eleven Villages"" of Kyaukse, the more enlightened Mranmd had learnt writing and Buddhism from the Mons (Rmen-) still lingering in the north of Kyaukse. At Paga'n itself, Buddhism first shows itself in the Bu-paya12, a small bulbous stupa on the river- bank, possibly inherited from the pre-Burmese inhabitants, Pyu refugees from Arl Ksetra. By IOOO A.D. Caw Rahan had built a chapter-house on Mt. Thrain, and Aniruddha's father, Klon-phlii- man, a monastery at Myinkaba. But 'Nat' worship and Ndga worship1 were still more prevalent than Buddhism. The central kharuin of Kyaukse was known as Myingondaing (MraA-khun-htui), 'Horse- leaping post,' recalling the old horse-sacrifices14. The kingdom's centre, Mt. Popa (Pupd)15, was dominated by the dread Mahdgiri Nats, brother and sister, who still mount guard at the main gate- way of Pagan 6. - Such, in brief, was the kingdom of Tambadipa17, 'the land of copper' or wealth, the region "south of the river", when Aniruddha ascended the throne. WANE OF BUDDHISM About this time Buddhism was almost everywhere on the wane. In Sung China, during the iith century, the recoil from Buddhism set in with the rise of Neo-Confucianism. In Tibet18, the 'Red Hat sect' of Padmasambhava had relapsed into demonolatry, before the Pandit Atiga (an older contem- porary of Aniruddha) came and introduced the Tantric Mahdydnism of Pdla Bengal. In North India, Muslim armies were continually raiding from the west. In I033-4 the Ghaznavid general Ahmad sacked Benares19. In I039 the Chedi prince Karnadeva invaded the Buddhist Pdla kingdom of Bihar 5 See J.B.R.S. Vol. XLII, Part I (I959), pp. 75-II2, "Old Kyaukse and the Coming of the Burmans". 6 ibid., p. 89. Cf.

II05 A.D.) says that (at some date, unspecified) the Vajrdsana temple of Bodhgayd, the very heart of Buddhism, had been "irremediably destroyed by other kings"21. In East Bengal (Samatata, 'the level country'), from the beginning of the iith century, says Bhattasali, "Buddhism had begun to decline with the fall of the Candras."22 In the Deccan, Buddhism was yielding almost everywhere before the revival of Brahmanism; and the split between Mahaydna and the southern schools of Theravdda, etc., was ever widening. In South India, early in the ioth century the 8aivite Cola empire arose, holding for a time most of the country south of the Kistna. The Colas were strong at sea. Between IOI7 and I070 they ruled most of Ceylon; but from about i050 the Singhalese prince Kfrti (afterwards Vijayabahu I) led a desperate revolt against them, from the south and centre of the island23. In I025 the Colas conquered Palembang (Sri Vijaya), including the north of Sumatra and the mainland up to the Isthmus of Kra2A. Of all that great Bud- dhist kingdom which I-tsing had admired so much in the 7th century, little remained except Nagara Srf Dharmardja (Ligor) on the east coast, just south of Kra. Dvdravati25, the Theravada stronghold in Lower Siam, the source of Mon inscriptions 400 years before the first in Burma, fell to the Khmers early in the ith century. The 8aivite court of Angkor (Mahdnagara), under Sflryavarman I, occupied Lopburi; and between I002 and I050 extended Cambojan rule over much of Siam28. There is no evi- dence, I think, that they persecuted Buddhism, but they are not likely to have supported it. They even tried, as we shall see, to invade Burma. - In this perilous period Buddhism was saved only by such valiant fighters as Vijayabdhu in Ceylon and Aniruddha in Burma, and by such ardent reformers as Pandit AtIga in Tibet, and in Burma Shin Arahan. THE KING S NAME Aniruddha was perhaps the greatest of the kings of Burma. He was certainly the king who first gave Burmans the control of the major part of their country. Other kings of Burma, Kyanzittha for example27, call themselves Cakravartin, "Universal Monarch." Aniruddha alone is so called by his successors28. There is a good deal said about him in the various sources; but when all is said, he re- mains a dim figure to the historian. The dimness begins with his very name. In his own original inscriptions he once, once only, signs his name Anuruddha29. Elsewhere, dozens of times, he writes Aniruddha. Pagan kings knew Pali better than Sanskrit; but where royal titles are concerned, they usually preferred the latter. Ani- ruddha is a Sanskrit word: a-niruddha, 'unobstructed, ungovernable, self-willed' - a good name, one 20 ibid., p. 5IO. 21 Epig. Birm. I, Part II, Inscr. VIII A4 (transl., pp. I63-4). 22 N. K.

Pali Anuruddha, 'compliant', past participle of anu-rujjhati, 'to conform oneself to', is quite a different word in origin, and (applied to kings) almost opposite in meaning, the one 'despotic', the other 'democratic'. A nuruddha, of course, was the name of the great and amiable thera, first cousin of Gotama Buddha. Malalasekera says that in Mahdydnist books his name appears as Aniruddha30. So the confusion goes back to early Buddhist times. In Old Burmese the name cakkrawatiy Anuradhd first occurs under date 569 S./I207 A.D.31 About the same time "Prince Anuruddha" appears in the I3th-century Citlavaosa of Ceylon32. U Pe Maung Tin suggests to me a possible reason for the change. In Pali, nirodha, 'suppression', is often equivalent to nirvdna. A-niriddha would imply the opposite - a name improper, therefore, for such a champion of Buddhism. But since he almost always wrote his name thus, it is best to follow his normal spelling. HIS VOTIVE TABLETS The only original inscriptions of Aniruddha3 are pious Buddhist sentences or prayers, signed by himself, on terracotta votive tablets showing Buddhas or Bodhisattvas. Already dozens of these 'Seals of Anoratha' have been recovered, in many parts of Burma; and many more will be found when we start to dig systematically. These tablets have at least 5 distinct aspects of interest:- (i) the details of the Buddhist scene shown on the obverse; (ii) the script of the various writings or stamps; (iii) the language of the writings or stamps; (iv) their content or meaning; (v) the places where the tablets are found. The size and shape of the tablet, and its artistic quality, may also, of course, be important. The practice of stamping such tablets in Burma, goes back to early Pyu times at Sri Ksetra (7th century A.D.). At Tagaung, Rangoon, Pegu, Thaton, etc., old and distinctive specimens are found, and also in Dvdravati. Nearly all the Burma tablets are arranged symmetrically34, with a central Buddha, Bodhisattva or Tdrd. Those of Sri Ksetra show great variety in the Buddha image. It may be seated or standing, in various asanas and mudras. Even in the Earth-touching attitude (bhimis- parsa mudrd) there is variety: right hand or left may be touching Earth, over shin, knee or thigh; the other hand may or may not hold the almsbowl; the legs may be in padmd'sana, both soles showing, or (more usually) right leg on left. Aniruddha's example, it seems, has put an end to most of this variety, right down to the present day. He always shows the Buddha touching Earth, always with the right hand falling straight over the shin below the knee, and the left hand empty in the lap. The physical type, too, is generally distinctive (see P1. 6 c, d): the face strong and square, the tsntsa large and conical, the shoulders 30 Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol. I, p. go. 31' .B., P1. II i6o al. The final date of this inscription is 609 S./I 247 A.D. Later inscriptional spellings are Anorathd (IV 4292); Anuradh&amp; (V 539 a3); Anoradhd (List 232); Anorattha (List 462); Norathd (List 5o a'); Anoradha (List 346 a14); etc. Note that Burmese always drops the -u- in the third syllable: as if a further confusion had occurred with the name of the 17th Naksatra, Anurxadha, or that of the ancient Singhalese capital, Anuradha. 32 Cfiavarhsa, Part I, ch. 6o, v. 5 (Pali Text Society transl., p. 214). 33 Pls. 4 to 14, 22, 54. 3 Such a beautiful asymmetrical tablet as the one from Rajapuri on the left of Plate III in Coed's' article, "Siamese Votive Tablets" (J.

He sits on a beaded mat (cammakhanaa), with double lotus below it; below that, if space permits, there may be a recessed pedestal or throne. There is always a nimbus, some- times an umbrella; never the old-fashioned wooden reredos, with makara on vydla on elephant-head; instead, a trefoil pillared arch, with or without receding roofs and sikhara-stupa; there are always dangling peepal leaves and streamers. At sides or top there are normally stupas, varying in size and number, always symmetrically placed. A gentler, finer type is found in the stupa close to Temple No. 44I, near the Seinnyet (P1. 6a, b). Here the chin is pointed and the face oval. And there are other differences. Stupas at the sides and top are missing. Receding wooden roofs are more prominent. There is a hint of Ndga-hoods at the sides. The two lines of square NMgari stamped in high relief below- Aniruddha's endorsement of the Buddhist Credo - are exceptionally fine. And Aniruddha spells his name Anuruddha.-Perhaps this is aMon design, from RMman-fiadesa rather than Bengal. Beautiful it certainly is; but it is unique. The stronger, simpler 'Aniruddha type' triumphed. Aniruddha's sim- plest tablets35 are also his largest: 2 ft. 7 in. by i ft. 6 in. broad, probably the largest in Burma. They lined the two octagonal terraces of 'Maung Di' pagoda, Khabin36, a dozen miles west of Rangoon. LOKANATHA TABLETS At the neighbouring site of Kanbe37, and also at Pagan Shwe-gu-gyi, and at Kanthit38 north of Pakokku, have been found 'seals' of Aniruddha which show, instead of the Buddha, the Bodhisattva Lokandtha, seated like a king in lalitasana, one leg hanging, right hand open on knee in varadamudrd, left arm twined with a stem of lotus. His 'dhydni Buddha', Amitabha, is faintly seen in his headdress. Yet another type of Lokanatha39, though not signed by Aniruddha, is found with Buddha tablets signed by him in the relic-chamber of his Pagoda 44I near the Seinnyet, Pagan. And duplicates of this are also found in Minbu, the 'Six kharuin'. It is probably quite wrong to regard Aniruddha as a Theravadin. He had as yet no access to the sea, and little contact, it seems, with the half-Buddhist Mons of Ramaninadesa. He doubtless had contacts with North Arakan, via the 'Six kharuin' and the An Pass, beyond which the pioneers of the Mranmd were steadily pushing their advance. Perhaps the Chronicles are right in saying that one of his queens was a princess of Vesli40, though the old Candra capital in Arakan is more likely than the Lacchavi capital in India. And there is ample evidence to prove that he and his successors had close relations, religious, cultural, and matrimonial, with Patikkard (west of Comilla) in East Bengal. There Maha- yanism, Tantrism, and various forms of Brahmanism flourished. Lokandtha, 'Lord of the World', supposed to dominate it between the death of Gotama and the coming of Maitreya, was the most popular Bodhisattva in Bengal4l. Aniruddha's Lokanatha tablets are much the same as his tablets of Gotama, except that the gloss usually begins eso Lokandtho instead of eso Bhagava.

Apart from single figures, tablets signed by Aniruddha are of four types:- (i) 5 figures". These come from various sites around Pagan. The usual Earth-touching Buddha sits enthroned in the centre. Almost as large, Lokandtha and Maitreya sit on his right and left in lalit- asana. Two small Earth-touching Buddhas sit above them. (ii) io figuress4. These are found at Pagan, at Chantha village northwest of Shwdbo, and at Nwatele deserted village in the far north of Mbng Mit state, at the top of the Shweli bend. This last site, I5 miles from Katha, is the northernmost point as yet where tablets of Aniruddha have been found. They show io Earth-touching Buddhas, the large central one enthroned in the Bodhgayd temple, with four small ones in two tiers beside him, and a row of five below. (iii) 3I figures46. These are found around Pagan, at Hsameiksh6, Meiktila district, and at Paunglin, Minbu district. The usual large Earth-touching Buddha sits in the centre, with small figures of Lo- kanatha and Maitreya sitting in lalitasana on his right and left. Around them in 5 rows sit the 28 previous Buddhas, all touching earth. (iv) 50 figures47. Found at Pagan Shwe-hsan-daw, at Minbu (?Paunglin), and inside the Bawbaw- gyi stupa at 8ri Ksetra. All are Earth-touching Buddhas, all of one size, seated in 6 rows with small stupas between their heads. Bronze, stone and terracotta moulds for tablets have been found, both at 8ri Ksetra and Pagan48; so the old controversy, whether these tablets were made in India or in Burma, need not detain us.49 The practice of moulding votive tablets, says Coedes50, "goes back to the very earliest times of Buddhism," and "appears to be exclusively Buddhist...

Of our tablets in Burma, North India was clearly the original source, Pdla Bengal, Ndlandd and Bodhgayd the distributing centres. The writing was originally Sanskrit, and the script Ndgarl, usually stamped in high relief on the obverse, often in minute characters easily rubbed off. The normal gloss was the so-called Buddhist Credo, summed up in a Sanskrit stanza :- ye dharmd hetuprabhavd hetu* tesay tathdgato hy avada tesadh ca yo nirodho evamvddf mahdsramanah or in Pali (Mahavagga I, 23, 5):- ye dhammd hetuppabhavd tesayt hetun*t tathdgato dha tesani ca yo nirodho evativddi mahdsamano ti "The things which arise from a cause, of these the Tathdgata has stated the cause. Of these also there is a means of suppression. Such is the teaching of the great Ascetic." Coedes comments5l: -"The extraordinary conciseness of this stanza, that gives in four verses the quintessence of the teaching of the Master, might alone be considered sufficient justification for its choice and explanation of its popularity. But there is more in it than that. According to the tradition preserved in the most ancient writings, it was by means of this stanza that the Buddha secured the adherence of the two disciples Sdriputta and Moggalldna, afterwards revered in the circles of the Brotherhood as second only to the Master himself. A formula which had so speedily convinced the two most notable followers of the Master, must rapidly have acquired in the eyes of the ancient Bud- dhists a sort of magic virtue, and may well have seemed to them a quite irresistible charm for the conversion to the Faith of any who had not yet heard it." We may conclude that Aniruddha's main purpose in scattering his plaques all over Burma, was a missionary one: he wished to convert all Burma to a living faith in Buddhism. So far as the plains of Burma are concerned, he certainly paved the way for this. No small feat, when one remembers that his own people had not yet emerged from Nat-worship and animal sacrifice; that Snake-worship was still powerful in the north; and that in the Mon country Buddhism had only recently triumphed over a hostile Brahmanism52. He built, of course, on old Buddhist foundations, Sri Ksetra and Halin, with Dvdravati, Ligor (Nagara SrY Dharmardja), and half the Burma Mons, at least, on his side. But early in the century, the Buddhist kingdom of Dvaravati, as we have seen, had been occupied by the largely Saivite Khmers. Full descriptions and notes on Aniruddha's 'Seals' as known to us at present, are given in the Cata- logue of Plates and the section on Iconography. THE KING S CAMPAIGNS We come now to the details of the king's gests. Here we must often depend on secondary sources, and late Chronicles, Mon., Burmese, Pali and Thai, which at first seem hopelessly confused. All are agreed that he was a champion of Buddhism, whose main purpose was to secure copies of the Tipitaka 51 ibid., pp. 5-6. See also Coedes' note at Artibus Asiae, Vol. XXII, I/2, Pp. I3-I4. 52 See G. E. Harvey, History of Burma, pp. 5-9. R. Halliday, The Talaings (Rangoon, I9I7), pp. 6-9. For old Brahmanic stone-reliefs found at That6n, see R. C.

He goes seeking them, now at Thaton, now in Ceylon, now at Angkor, now at the Nan-chao capital, presumably Ta-li. He receives an insolent rebuff, now at That6n, now at Angkor, now at the Nan-chao capital. His general Kyanzittha in one case, the king himself in another, performs feats of 'gymnastics', "piercing the Cambojans"53: the scene is now Pegu, now Angkor. Each has magic horses that can fly so fast as to give the impression of an army. Each cows his opponent with the spectre of streaks of betel-blood. The opponent in one case is the Khmer monarch, in the other that of Nan-chao. Scene, hero and villain are alike lost in folktale, and history, it seems, finally submerged in myth. To thread this maze is not, perhaps, so hopeless as it seems. External sources often come to one's assistance. But I cannot deny that one has often to depend on probability: 0 False and treacherous Probability, Enemy of Truth, and friend to wickednesse; With whose bleare eyes Opinion learnes to see, Truth's feeble party here, and barrennesse! as Fulke Greville frighteningly called it. SRI KSETRA Aniruddha began, as we have seen, with distant overland contacts mainly with the west and north- west, Arakan and East Bengal, which, if Buddhist, were Mahdydnist and Tantric. Failing to get the basic texts he needed, he turned to the south, where he heard that Thaton had them. On his way coastward from Pranitawsd kiwan, he must first encounter Prome and 8ri Ksetra. "He marched to 8ri Ksetra by land and water with a great company of elephants and horses, and destroyed the cetiya built by king Dwattabaung. And he took the frontlet-relic... He destroyed the city of 8ri Ksetra, fearing lest rebels should occupy it in time to come." (G.P.C. transl., pp. 86-87). A strange act for a champion of Buddhism, but not likely to be quite untrue. "Destroyed" is certainly too strong a word. The city was not destroyed. I guess that the Pyu/KarensM4 then living at the old capital (still called Prani, 'the capital', though now moved four miles west to the Prome riverbank), put up some show of resistance to the invader; and that Aniruddha, anxious to safeguard his rear, and also to transfer to his new capital the religious virtue still attaching to the old one, opened a hole at the base of the Bawbaw-gyi pagoda (one can still enter by it today), and removed the Relic to Pagan, leaving as receipt his own signed votive tablets of the 5o Buddhas, which General de Beylie found there in I907, and Maung Po Cho in I9II.55 53Burmese krwamwthui:, lit. 'to pierce the Cambojans', has now come to mean 'to turn somersaults'. " The Cakraw of Old Burmese we identify provisionally with the Sgaw Karens. They appear to have been the chief agents in the break-up, during the 8th century, of the Pyu kingdom of gr! Ksetra. They settled, not only in Minbu, but also on "Cakraw island to the west of Prome." - See J.B.R.S. Vol. XLII, Part I, June I959, pp. 86-87. 55 General de Beylie, accompanied by Taw Sein Ko, was the first excavator at gri Ksetra. Among his discoveries in I907, Taw Sein Ko mentions (A.S.I. i9o8, pp. 4I-42) "a broken piece of a votive tablet containing I7 effigies of the Buddha with a Sanskrit legend, found, with many others, among the debris in the core of the Bawbaw-gyi Pagoda". It was broken at both ends. Venkayya read it: . . . dm-Anirudadevena ha (a) ... A different fragment was found later at the same pagoda by the Sub-Overseer, Maung Po Cho (see A.S.B. I9I2, p. I3; A S.I. I9I2, p. I44 and PI. LXVIII, fig. 2). This one Venkayya read doubtfully: Macchakadanapati Vigaharaja grf ... The illustration shows the bottom left corner of a tablet, with about I2 (+) Earth-touching Buddhas, all of one size, with small stupas between their heads. It is clearly one of Aniruddha's 5o-Buddha tablets. Very likely de Beyli6's fragment was of the same type. The full reading should probably be:- om sahcaka-danapati maharaja s.rt aniruddhadevena kato bhagavo, "This Blessed One was made by the great king, Ar! Aniruddhadeva. donor of the mould-" 2*</page><page sequence="36">20 Chapter I KHXBIN He was now halfway to the coast. He pursued his march south another I70 miles to Khabin (Old Burm. Krapafi)56. This old moated city, I2 miles west of Rangoon, preceded Twante (Tala) as the capital of this coastal region, west of the Hlaing (Old Burm. Lhsui'n) or Rangoon river. Here he built the large pagoda (P1. 79 b) which the local people still insist on attributing to the fisherman Maung Di, who married, after long-drawn-out reluctance, the princess who pursued him. The two octagonal terraces of this pagoda are lined with the largest of Aniruddha's tablets (Pls. 4, 5) over 24 feet high by 4i feet broad, all signed by the king on the front rim in Pali, Mon script. Duroiselle was the first scholar to read these faint inscriptions57. This region was famous for its pottery58. At Twante, 7 miles to the west, a fine earthenware pot with recessed conical lid was excavated in I92o"5. Below the neck is a row of fig-leaves stencilled. A similar pot, lidless, with the same stencilled fig-leaf pattern, was found by U Mya at Pagan in the relic- chamber of the encased stupa near the Seinnyet pagodas60. It was covered with votive tablets bearing the seal of Aniruddha, including a Lokandtha tablet. It appears that Aniruddha built this pagoda, and placed in the heart of it one of these fine pots brought from Khabin/Twant 61. LOWER BURMA At Khabin Aniruddha was close to the chief port of Lower Burma, Henbuiw62 or Yhanpuiw sah- phawcshipO, approximately Rangoon on the river Hlaing, the eastern mouth of the Irawady. The population hereabouts was mixed - Indian traders, originally from Orissa, and native Mons.

The Mranma, coming from the north, appear to have called this mixed population indiscriminately "Tanluinui"65 (Talaing), i.e. Telinga/Kalinga, East Indians. When they got to know the literate and cultured Indians, they learnt to call them kid866, for kulaputra, "men of caste or family", and transferred the vulgar term Tanluiit, quite wrongly, to the Mons. Rdmainadesa, 'country of the Mons' (Old Mon Rmefi)67, doubtless included Pegu (Paykhi)68 at the head of the Gulf of Martaban, 54 miles north-northeast of Rangoon; but the purer Mon region began after the crossing east of the mouth of the Sittaung. Here was the ancient Suvannabhfimi, 'land of gold', around Mt. Kelsa, the iioo ft. 'Gibraltar' rock on the seashore 30 miles north of Thatan, where AMoka's missionaries, the theras Sona and Uttara, are said to have landed, in 253 B.C. (?), after the 3rd Buddhist Council69. For centuries before and after Christ, this coast had been infested by Malayan pirates, whose main centre was Sumatra. The local Mons and Indians called them Raksa, "cannibal monsters"; and doubtless they enlisted many of the aborigines, Semang Negritoes and Australoid Besisi, to join in their sea- raids. The coastline, from Twante east- and south-wards, is still dotted with forts70, built near the mouths of rivers against Raksa attack. The old name for Thaton was Raksapura7l. The Malayans proper were certainly not savages: they were highly expert in metalwork72. and supreme in shipping73. Few were Buddhists. Not very long before the time of Aniruddha (for the name Raksapura was still remembered) they had been expelled from Thaton, where, after a spell of Brahmanism74, Buddhism triumphed, and the city was renamed Sudhamma (=- Thatan), 'City of the Good Law'. Perhaps from Kdeicipura near Madras, they received some texts of the Tipitaka, at any rate an old recension of the Jdtaka with its commentary (a.tthakathd)75. This became immensely popular, stimulating the local arts76. Its fame, we may be sure, reached the ears of Aniruddha. CAMBOJAN INVASION OF PEGU But I think his first contacts were with Pegu rather than Thaton, sparked by a sudden invasion of the Cambojans (Old Mon Krom, Old Burm. Krwath)77. For this, one turns to the history of Camboja " At I.B., P1. II 2i621, Ussi comes next to Payku (Pegu). Cf.

Silryavarman I, one of the great kings of Camboja, reigned from i002-50 A.D. Perhaps he was of Malay origin, son of the king of Ligor. It took him 9 years of fighting before he was enthroned king at Angkor, about IOIO A.D. His reign saw a big expansion of Khmer power in the Menam basin. Dvdravati had founded a Mon Buddhist colony in the hills of North Siam, Hari- punijaya (Lamphun); but mother and colony had quarrelled and gone to war; and this gave the opportunity to the king of Ligor (Sfiryavarman's father?) to make himself master of Lower Siam, i.e. Dvdravati. From near the beginning of the century the Khmers were masters of Lopburi. They may even have made a temporary conquest of North Siam; but in the end Haripunfjaya maintained its independence. Sflriyavarman died early in I050, and his son and successor, who reigned for i6 years, had to face a series of revolts. It seems probable that the Khmer attempt to invade Pegu took place early in the reign of Aniruddha, perhaps soon after the death of Sfiriyavarman. M. Coedes has given, in Pali text and French translation, large extracts from two early Chronicles of North Siam. The older and more garrulous text is the Ccdmadevxvamsa of Bodhiraihsi (early I5th century). The more valuable text is the Jinakdlamdlinf of Ratanapanna (r5i6 A.D. ?)79. The tales they tell are often monkish, legendary and amusing, like our Burmese Chronicles, but with many odd variations. The early dates, like ours, are unreliable. Haripunijaya, the Mon colony, "Heaping of Greens", had been founded by Cdmadevi, about the 8th century, in the hills some I7 miles south of the later Thai city of Ch'ieng Mai. The Chronicles relate" that during the reign of Kamala- or Kambalardja, cholera desolated the country for six years. The whole surviving population fled to Sudhammanagara [Thaton]. But the king of Pukama or Punnakama [Pagan], instead of pitying them, harassed them and sought to occupy Sudhammanagara. So the refugees fled to Hamsavatf [Pegu]. Here the king pitied, fed and clothed them; "and as their speech was identical, without the smallest difference," they soon learnt to trust each other. After six years, when the epidemic ceased, some of the refugees returned to Haripufijaya, but many remained at Pegu; and friendly relations continued between the two cities. - This fact is confirmed by the finding of 7 Mon inscriptions at Lamphun8l, dating from the first half of the I3th century, written in a beautiful script very similar to that of Kyanzittha's in- scriptions a century earlier. The Glass Palace Chronicle, without giving a date, separates widely the offensive war against Thaton (p. 78), and the defensive war against the Krwam at Pegu (p. 92). The North Siam Chronicles combine them, and so does the 'New Chronicle' of Twinthintaikwun, who places the Pegu fighting "in the year when Thaton was destroyed"82. Certain late Burmese inscriptions or 'copies' place the date rather earlier than do the Kalydni inscriptions. The Ywalin Mahapeinne Copy83 says that in 4i6 S./I054 A.D., Aniruddha "conveyed the sacred Hair from Thaton and enshrined it." And the Pin 78 See Coedes, Etats hindouises ...... (I948), pp. 227-235.

" The Mon History of Thaton places the Krom invasion even earlier than the capture of Thaton, indeed 8 years before Aniruddha's accession. But since Talankesd (Kyanzittha) and his paladins are still the heroes in the battle, this date is not easy to admit. For the capture of Thaton, the clearest statement comes in the Pali/Mon Kalyanl inscriptions of Pegu85 (I479 A.D.). These state that after the theras Sona and Uttara had founded the Buddhist religion in Rdmafifadesa, it flourished for a long time: "In course of time, however, its power declined, because civil dissensions arose and the extensive country was broken up into separate principalities, and because the people suffered from famine and pestilence, and because, to the detriment of the propagation of the excellent Religion, the country was conquered by the armies of the Seven Kings... During the reign of Sfiriyakumdra, who bore the name of Manohor [Pali text: Manoharfj, ruling the city of Sudhuim [Thaton], the power of the kingdom became very weak... In i6oI A.B., 4I9 sakkaryJ [I057 A.D.], king Anuruddha, the lord of Arimaddanapura [Paga'n], took a community of monks together with the Tipitaka, and established the Religion in Pukdm [Pali Pugdma]." PSA KROM There is no mention of the fighting at Pegu. Elsewhere, however, there is frequent reference in these inscriptions86 to a Cambojan market and a Cambojan monastery (which gave its name to a special sect), somewhere on the west bank of the Hlaing or Rangoon river near its mouth. It was situated, say the inscriptions, "near the GapuiA river-mouth in Lakkhiyapura87 province, called the Bakdsa because of its teeming with fish, which served as food for paddy-birds. Near the monastery was a market, and not very far from the latter was a settlement where a great number of Krom prisoners of war were located. On account of this fact, the market was called the Cambojan bazaar (psa Krom)." It seems likely that this settlement dated from the time of Kyanzittha's victory over the Krom who attacked Pegu. It was still a living memory in those parts four hundred years later. If the Khmer raid took place while Aniruddha was at Khabin, building his large pagoda, one understands why his help was invoked (Pegu was only 70 miles away), and Kyanzittha hastily despatched to the rescue. One sees a reason, too, for placing the prisoners-of-war camp south of Khabin, near the sea. The lives of the Khmers had been spared; and ere long they would serve as a help rather than a liability. 84 List i8 (B. II 627).

Rainfall here is over 200 inches a year. The inscriptions, often illegible, sometimes couched in poetry, are nowhere easy to read: that is why they have not yet been edited. Neither has a legible date; but internal evidence suggests that they must precede, and very shortly precede, Aniruddha's capture of the city. They also make it possible, if not probable, that the king's name Ma'kuta (or Mukuta), misread, has become the Manuho, Manohor, Manoharf (a woman's name !), Manuhd, etc., of later records89. In Old Mon inscriptions and the oldest of Old Burmese, the sign of the vowel -u was often hung from the middle stroke of k-, and not (as always since) from the stroke on the right. It seems that this archaic ku- was misread no-, and king Makuta, "Crown of Kings", became a meaningless Manoha, with its subsequent corruptions. Our two inscriptions may be distinguished as the trdp and the pan1it inscriptions. Each begins with 3 faint lines in Pali. Then comes the name of the city:- "In the beginning, in the city called Rak- sapura, 'city of the Demons', i.e. the Malayan Vikings of the South. Each inscription continues with the name and titles of the king. These are fragmentary', but as they occur six times altogether90, there is little doubt about the reading: - Ma'kuta0 (or Mukuta0) raJandma rajddhirdja "the king of kings named king Makuta"; Paramesvara "the highest lord" (a common title of Siva); isvarardja "lord and king"; abheyamahcrdja "the fearless monarch" devctideva "god of gods"; bahunainasagaragambhfra "deep Ocean of vast knowledge"; srT nityadharmmadhara "fortunate possessor of the principle of permanence"; dhanesvara "lord of wealth"; sakalatambdviseya treylokavarmma "armour of the three worlds" (of men, devas and brahmds), (including) all the regions of copper (tamba)". The late lamented Pierre Dupont justly remarked9' that sakalatdmbdviseya fits in rather awkwardly with the following, final title treylokavarmma. - I see no other way of translating the passage: but I welcome his suggestion that there is covert allusion to Tambadfpa, kingdom of the Mranmd. This justifies the awkwardness. There is a sting in the tail. Makuta claims to be Protector, i.e. Overlord, of this little upstart kingdom of his enemy Aniruddha, as well as Lord of the Universe. The trdp inscription is made conspicuous by a relief-carving at the top, illustrating at once the First Sermon at Sdrndth and the Twin Miracle at Sdvatthi92. The upper half of this stone, its left side especially, is rarely legible. In line 23 of the main section the words lwa' kromja'ba are legible at the end of the line, but the context is obscure. Lwal is the tribal term Lawa or Wa, present in the name of the city, Lavapura (Lavo, Lopburi). Krom is the Mon word, the western word for Cambojan (Old Burm. Krwa*lt Thai Khdm). Ja'ba might be the Moan Javd of Rdma Gdihhe'A's inscription (I292 A.D.), i.e. 88 I.B., P1. IV 358 (trdp) and 359 (pal4it). The king's name is clearest at PI. 35836 (6th line from the end) - Ma'kuta; and PI. 3592 (main section) Mukuta. 89 The late Pierre Dupont (L'Archefologie Mdne de Dvaravati (Paris, I959), Text, pp. 8-j), without denying this assumption, raised some difficulties, based on modern texts. It would be best to go back to the earliest known sources of the misreading (as I take it to be): viz. (i) the Pegu Kalyan! inscriptions (1479 A.D.) - Mon face Manohor, Pali face Manoharl (see Epig. Birm. III, Part II, Face A, line i8, pp. 9i and I87, n. 13). (ii) the jinakdlamdli(Isi6 A.D.) - Manohdra (BEFEO t. XXV, pp. 6o-6i, I23-4). (iii) List 346 a, A. 7, Mandalay Palace Shed, Stone 9, North face, line 4 - Manuho. Though dated 429 s./Io68 A.D., this Burmese inscription in coarse late cursive can hardly be older than the i6th century A.D. 90 I.B., P1. IV 359 (main inscr.)243 36-38.

The last IO to I5 lines of this inscription are difficult but mostly legible. They seem to be couched in verse, alternate syllables often rhyming. The general sense seems to be that in the slothful time of peace the king would urge his people (?) to do works of merit, and give gifts of land to the Sarhgha. But in the concourse of war he would knap the spear-blade of the turbulent enemy, and gloriously shoot ... capture, daze and overturn him. He would fortify the city (?) with spears and shields, encircling it with a great moat as a place of refuge all around... with walls, battlements, glacis and beacon-fires, signalling to all the world to strive hard and harken to the orders of the king. - I cannot claim that this is an accurate translation; but I think it means some- thing of the sort. The main pauit inscription begins with a fairly clear passage of I5 lines: the king's titles (given four times on this stone); then a list in Pali verse of the 28 Buddhas. It passes into Mon., extolling Gotama Buddha, and again becomes almost illegible. The lower section contains a short summary in Mon of the ten great Jdtakas (Mahanipdta). Both inscriptions end similarly, repeating the king's titles, and saying that his people went into his presence and repeatedly saluted him, by popular vote to the sound of drums, frog-drums, and acclam- ations, as trdp "lord!" in the one case, as pan1i "wise man!" in the other. - To me, he does not sound quite like a hereditary sovereign. Was he not just a war-lord, popularly elected to meet a sudden threat of war ? CAPTURE OF THAT6N Thaton, says Professor Daw Thin Kyi", was "built with the Martaban Range flanking it on its eastern side, facing the sea on the west. . . Even today, there can be seen, besides the double walls of the city, an inner and an outer defence-line, with a fortress in between the northern wall and the outer one, built when invasion threatened from the north. But these defences did not save Thaton... Its north-south length within the walls is 6,700 feet, and east-west length 4,300 feet. It covers an area of I.2 square miles." Local tradition has it that the northern defences held, but that Kyanzittha, Aniruddha's general (magic of course assisting)95, entered by the gap through the hills to the south, and a crawl through the city-drain. Makuta's palace-site is still visible in the centre; and old stupas such as the Thagya Paya, which has the oldest series of Jdtaka-plaques in Burma, illustrating the Ma- hdnipata96; also the Kalydnf STmd, with the oldest stone carvings of the same themes, and the base of an Old Mon inscription recording its dedication97. What provoked the quarrel with Thaton, it is difficult to say. Three possible sources of trouble are suggested: - (i) the influx, to Thaton and Pegu, of Mons from North Siam, fleeing from cholera (North Siam chronicles). 93See G.

(iii) Aniruddha's demand for Buddhist texts, met with a rebuff (North Siam and Burmese chronicles). War and pestilence go together, so (i) and (ii) may well be connected. If I incline to these alternatives rather than to (iii), it is because what we find in the early temples of Pagan, suggests that the only texts Aniruddha could get from Thaton were JItaka Commentaries. The great access of Tipitaka knowledge is not visible at Paga'n until the next two reigns - well after I070 A.D., when the main texts were finally obtained from Ceylon98. It was not usual for Aniruddha to quarrel with fellow-Buddhists; and Makuta's inscriptions show him to be a Buddhist, though possibly none too orthodox. The title paramesvara sounds more Saivite than Buddhist, and syi nityadharmmadhara, "fortunate possessor of the principle of permanence", would shock a pious Theravadin. Had Makuta played a double game over the Krom invasion? - We do not know. But the infiltrators, Mon or Khmer, were closer kin to Makuta than any Burman could be. CONQUEST OF TENASSERIM Mon-Khmer speakers have everywhere been pioneers in wet-rice-cultivation. As a result, they suffered from chronic over-population. They started apparently from Tongking, and spread over all the rice-plains of Further India and East India. Most of the Mons of Burma came originally from Siam. So long as this ceaseless infiltration from Siam continued, Burmese control of Burma as a whole was impossible. The Glass Palace Chronicle gives a long account of Aniruddha's efforts to stem this flood, and seal his eastern frontier99. It names 43 towns built by him "to prevent mixture with the Shan Yuns who dwelt between the Burmese kingdom of Tambadipa and Kamboja kingdom." - The reference to "Shan Yuns" and "Maw kings of the Shan country of Maw" is an anachronism; the meaning should be Gyun (krwam:) and possibly Karens (Old Burm. karyaiz). The list of towns does not go south nearly far enough. None of our sources mentions the conquest of any place south of Thaton. Yet it is certain that Aniruddha marched south at least as far as Tenas- serim, and probable that he went beyond the Isthmus of Kra. Only so could his eastern frontier be effectively sealed. On his campaigns, north and south, he took with him his young scamp of a son, Saw Lu, the Mail Lulait of Old Burmese, who later succeeded his father with the title SrY Bajrdbharana, "Fortunate Bearer of the Thunderbolt." Saw Lu died in I084 after nearly ruining his father's life- work. Near Maunglaw, io miles south-east of Mergui, there has been discovered the beautiful top of a Pali inscription set up by SrT Bajrdbharana100. This proves that Aniruddha's conquests reached far to the south of Burma. The area then inhabited by Mons extended at least as far as Tavoy (Old Mon Dawdy), I30 miles north of Mergui. Kyanzittha, Aniruddha's general who succeeded Saw Lu as king, took care to station reliable governors to guard Tavoy. Two of them have left votive tablets 98 The earliest Pagan temple to show knowledge of the Tipitaka beyond the Jdtaka, is the Pahtothamya. I should date this temple not earlier than the latter part of the reign of Saw Lu (d. i084 A.D.). See Ch. I, p. 9 and n. 33. 9 Hmannan (Susodhita Ed.), Vol. I, pp. 273-4. G.P.C. (transl.), pp. 96-97.

A new Seal of Aniruddha has recently, I hear, been found by members of the Burma Historical Commission at Mergui, in Mingyaung monastery, Thanbo quarter. It was originally discovered onthe slope of a hill overlooking the sea, south-west of the large Legyun-hsimi sTmd and cetf. This is the southernmost point, up to now, where plaques signed by Aniruddha have been found. Except for slight damage at the top, the tablet is in good condition and beautifully made. The measurements are: - 5j inches broad at the bottom; 67 inches high; depth of frame II inches. The obverse shows 50 Earth-touching Buddhas; and appears to correspond closely with similar tablets shown on P1.I2 a, b, c of this book, and Pls. 8 and 9 (pp. I3-14) of U Mya's Votive Tablets of Burma, Part I. In ii96, a hundred and twenty years after Aniruddha's death, the Paga'n king Canisii II (Nara- patisithu) states the frontiers of his kingdom :102 _ "to the South, Tavoy, Ca -hat ( ?), Santhut (ThandAk, south-east of Mergui), Tanansare (Tenasserim), Takwd (Takua Pa on the Isthmus of Kra), Salankre (? Junk Ceylon), then several names difficult to read, the last ending with nakuiw', i.e. nagara. In ii96 Can-siu II was doing no more, I expect, than registering a claim based on former ownership. If so, Aniruddha is the king most likely to have reached so far. He was the first to realize the necessity of sealing the border right down to the Isthmus. It was probably he who made the Pagan Burmans colonize Tenas- serim. An Old Burmese inscription dated I269 A.D. has been found at Thandok, south-east of Mergui'03. He is likely also to have wished to join hands with the only surviving Buddhist kingdom in Malaya, Nagara SrT Dharmaraja. Apart from this city in the south, and Haripun-Jaya in North Siam, and Patikkard in East Bengal, Pagan stood almost alone as champion of Buddhism. A third motive may have been the dangerous one of trying to control the sea trade at the Isthmus. But this motive, which led to the ruin of Kyanzittha's great-grandson a century later'0, could not have been effective in the absence of a navy controlling the Straits of Malacca. TA-LI KINGDOM After these strenuous campaigns of the I050's, we may perhaps allowAniruddha a rest, during which he built, with the help of his Mon captives, some of his works of merit at Pagan - the Pqtakat-taik (Pls. 80-82) to house his manuscripts, and the Shwd-hsan-daw Mahdpeinne (Pls. 83-87) to enshrine the Hair-Relic given by the grateful king of Pegu. We will return to these later. To complete the sealing of the frontier, it was then necessary to visit the 'Shan States' south and north, and face the still formid- able menace of Nan-chao, now "Ta-li kingdom" (Burm. Gandhdlaraj). This expedition, in which Kyanzittha is still prominently, I should place in the io6o's. We must here be on our guard against anachronisms. References in the Chronicles to 'Tarup' (Taruk), Maw, 'Shan States' and 'sawbwas' must 101 P1. 20. A.S.B. 1924, pp. 38-40, para 4I (Duroiselle). 102 I.B., PI. I i9, lines 6-io (558 s./Ii96 A.D.).

The 'Maw' kingdom of Ming Mao/Ch&amp;lan appears only in the I4th century, when the Yuan dynasty was weakening in YUnnan107. Of the name Syam or 'Shan', the first mention in Burmese is in II20 A.D. Many Syam slaves, and one high official (santbyai), are mentioned in inscrip- tions108; but 'Shan States' or 'sawbwas' can hardly have existed in Burma till very near the end of the Pagan dynasty. In the 8th and 9th centuries, when Nan-chao ruled the north of Burma as far as Manipur and Assam, it had built a fortress, Shgn-lung ('Divine Dragon') river-stockade, facing west on the edge of the hills, "where the sun sets at the level of the grasses"109. From here the 'Udibwa'-a term derived, it seems, from titles conferred by Tibet on the Nan-chao emperor in the 8th century 110 - lorded it over the plains. SAK-KANTU Where hills and plains meet in the north of Burma, lived, and still live, the old Tibeto-Burman 'Kadu' tribes (Old Burm. Kantt) 111. They call themselves Asak. From their eastern capital, Tagaung (Old Burm. Takon), on the east bank of the Irawady, they once stretched across the Mu and Chindwin, north-west as far as the valley of Manipur (where McCulloch in i859 recorded their Andro and Seng- mai dialects)112, and west as far as North Arakan, where Sak ('Thet') is still spoken in a good many villages north of Buthidaung113. The southern 'Thet' tribes (Old Burm. Sak) were in Central Burma when the Mranmd descended from the hills and absorbed them into Tambadfpa kingdom. The Kadu of the plains are Buddhist; and probably were so already in the time of Aniruddha, for they had a good many votive tablets at Tagaung"14, one type of which has not been found at Pagan. Aniruddha and Saw Lu certainly visited Tagaung, and built pagodas and left their signatures on votive tablets far to the north, near Nga-o, south-east of Katha, in the top bend of the river Shweli115. These are the north- ernmost certain traces of Aniruddha hitherto found. Much more doubtful are references, in later 106 See J. Siam Society, Vol. XLVII, Part I, June I959, pp. I36 and i84, n. 84, 85. 107 ibid., p. I72. Apart from the Yuan-shih and Ming-shih, an important source for the Mao Shans, is the Pai-i- chuan of Li Ssui-ts'ung or Ch'ien Ku-hsiin (c. I397 A.D.). 108 ibid., p.

Later they conferred on his grandson I-mou-hsiin the title jih-tung-wang, 'King of the Sunrise'. Huber suggested to Pelliot that 'udi' (u:daii) in Udibwa may come from Sanskrit udaya, "sunrise". But bhwd: does not mean 'king' or 'lord'. - Was it added in Middle Burmese on the false analogy of 'Sawbwa', Shan chao-fa, 'lord of the sky' ? (See Pelliot, BEFEO t.

What exactly happened on this expedition, is obscure. There was little or no fighting, it seems; but the Ta-li ruler, or (more likely) his frontier-commander, was taught the lesson that the Paga'n king was not to be trifled with, and that, as champion of Buddhism, he was prepared to defend his fellow- Buddhists, the Kadu. Whether he succeeded in liquidating Shen-lung river stockade, which may have commanded the river-bend between Bhamo and In-ywa, we cannot say; but since he reached Nga-o, if not beyond, and built pagodas there, he must have ventured pretty close to it. THE MYt-LAT South of the Nam Tu kMyit-nge), Pagan influence (very likely dating from Aniruddha or earlier) is more evident than north of it. The 'My6-lat' - Lawksawk, Yawng-hwe, and the borders of Inle Lake - still bears the Pagan hallmark, vaulted temples with the pointed, radiating arch117, not found (I think) to the north. Several late 'Copies' of inscriptions'18 claim that Aniruddha built temples at Thandaung and Indein on the west side of Inle. Porisat pagoda north of Yawng-hwe is attributed to him in the Chronicles19. The eastern limits of Aniruddha's kingdom are given in the Hmannan Yazawin as "the Pan: se: (Panthay) country of Avanti to the north-east, the Paikd country of Catissa to the east, and the Gywam: (Cambojan) country of Ayo: ca (Ayudhyd) to the south-east"120- Ayudhyd (built in I350 by Rdmddhipati) is an obvious anachronism, for Lopburi. So is the mention of 'Panthay', Yiinnanese Musulman. If Pankd is, as I expect, Bifigarattha, kingdom of the Me Ping, i.e. Chcieng Mai, that too is an anachronism: Chcieng Mai was founded by Mang Ray in 1296 A.D. MLACSA II KHARUIN The Chronicles tell us little of value about Burma itself in Aniruddha's time. They give us, however, 116 (i) The clearest mention is at lines 23-24 of the obverse (west face) of the great Htupay6n inscription, Sagaing (List 963 a23), under date 804 s./f1442 A.D., where the north-west boundaries of the then kingdom are given. The submission of "brother princes of Kal6" (Kal6myo) is noted, "who rule the so-called place where Fire burns in Water, (the abode) of Big-Ear Kanti (K~du) and Small-Ear Kasaif (Manipuri)." (ii) List 82 (= List I25o -see P.P.A. p. 30) is the reverse of List 764, a stone at the north-east corner of Pag6An Shwezigon platform. The reverse is not an original inscription. Among the northern boundaries of the kingdom of Narapatisithu (= Caiisii II), it mentions "the Big-Ear Kantii, the place where Fire burns in Water." (iii) List 73, a two-faced fragment ('Stone 50 ka') now at Mandalay Palace Shed, has an unlisted reverse. Just above the date 538 s./I 176 A.D., are some of the boundaries of Narapatisithu's kingdom. One of these is Kanta Ani kyn - a mistake for AVa Nc Kyr, "Big-Ear Kadu". (iv) U Kala's Great Chronicle (B.R.S. ed., Vol. I, para 274) gives in the text KatU:Nagd:Kni:Re-twaA-mf: as the north-west boundary of Aniruddha's kingdom, and also (para. 28i) of that of the baby Alaungsithu, except that Re-po-mf: ('Fire on Water') replaces Re-twai:mf: ('Fire in Water'). (v) The Hmannan Yazawin (Susodhita ed., Vol. I, pp. 277, 285) corrects Nagd:kri: ('Big Naga') to I'a Nd:Krf: ('Big Ear'), but is otherwise the same. - Note that the 'Big-Ear Kingdom' is mentioned in Fan Chco's Man Shu, ch. IO, f. 3 ro. (863 A.D.). Ta-erh ('Big Ear') kingdom is said to have close and friendly relations with the "Little Brahmans" of the Hukong Valley, and also with Nan-chao (transl. p. 92). 117 See J.B.R.S. Vol. XVIII, Part II, pp. 69-70, "An old temple at Lawksawk." - Besides the Shw6-6nhmin temple at Lawksawk, there are two temples with the radiating arch at Indein, south-west of InlI Lake, and others around Yawng-hw6. 118 List 4 (B.

Since Khathmhfi (etc.) is sometimes written Khabu with the Mon glottal b, and since it contained Tanluih rwa na123 'the main Talaing village', it is pretty certain that Mun or Muin is an early Burmese attempt to render Old Mon Rmeni, the ethnic name for the Mons. Mons were clearly numerous in this north-west corner of the district, and also doubtless around Kyaukse itself: for there is still in situ, at the foot of Kyaukse Hill, a Mon inscription24 on mica schist set up by a Mon archbishop (mahathera) "who came to live here at Klok and Sayoit" (two of the three old villages comprised in Kyaukse town), "and built a permanent chapterhouse (baddhasim), after informing the archbishop of Bukam (Pagatn) and the king" - perhaps Kyanzittha and Shin Arahan. KYAUKSP IRRIGATION Kyaukse's irrigated rice-fields fed Pagan, and the prestige of the Eleven kharyuin - the first home of the Burmans in the plains, where they learnt writing and Buddhism from the Mons - must have rivalled that of Pagan, right down to the reign of Aniruddha. "A system of canals", says Stewart125, "fed by the Zawgyi and Panlaung rivers, irrigates that part of Kyaukse district which lies between the Samon river on the west and the Shan hills oil the east... The Zawgyi canal-system irrigates the northern part of Kyaukse district... The Panlaung canal- system irrigates the southern portion." The Chronicles126 attribute to Aniruddha the building of 7 dams or weirs, 4 taking off from the Panlaung (Kinda, Nga Naingthin, Pyaungbya and Kume') and 3 from "the Mekkhaya river", i.e. the Zawgyi (Nwadet, Kunhse, and Gutaw). None of these names, except Nwadet (Nwatak), occur in the many old inscriptions of the Pagan period. I view them all with suspicion. Some of the Kyaukse canals are old, probably much older than Aniruddha. The Mranma, when they descended from the hills, could have known little about large-scale irrigation. Mon-Khmer- speaking peoples, on the other hand, had practised it for millennia. Both in Kyaukse and Minbu, the latter were doubtless the pioneers. In Minbu, there was a Poiloi (Palaung) canal north of Sagu127. In Kyaukse, the presence of the older peoples is shown in this one sentence of Cafisfl II's Dhammardjaka inscription128, the first royal inscription in Burmese: "In Saitoi village-circle, 95 pai of rice-field... west of Lawa (Wa) village, east of Satthway (Thindwe) canal, north-east of Poiloi (Palaung) village." -The Chronicles126 roundly assert that Thindwe dam dates "from the reign of Shwenanshin of Myinzaing when the Tarops came to Myinzaing", i.e. I30I A.D.; whereas five or more original inscrip- tions prove that it existed already in ii98, and (to judge by the reference to Lawa and Palaung) probably much earlier. And the Chronicles attribute Nwdtak dam to Aniruddhal26: whereas an old inscription at Pagaln Kyaung, Myinzaing129, dates it only from I258 A.D. 122 Muin kharin, I.B., P1. I 63 b7 (582 S./1220 A.D.).

These important villages, Mronchuth-krf, Mrofchu*-iai, 'big and small Myaungzon,' were probably in Tamut kharuin. Both are shown on inch-to-the mile maps, north-west of Kyaukse: Myaungzon-gyi 3 miles west-southwest of Singing, Myaungzon-nge 4 miles south-southwest of it. An inscription, from Myaungzon131 itself, first mentions a monastery-dedication in ii69 A.D., by Mittarasincan-, minister of Alaung- sithu. North of it, perhaps, was Na Prah dam (cha-), but the reading is doubtful. South of it, was Kuld nat, 'Indian Deva.' The place is often mentioned. Mroichu*t-iai may have been on the east bank of the canal. (ii) Cheii rwd hai, 'Little village of the Dam' in Mraitkhuntui&amp;n kharuin south-east of Kyaukse, is mentioned in ii83 A.D., in Cainsfi II's Sulamani inscription132. (iii) Saithway mroui, Thindwe Canal, perhaps the oldest of the canals, is mentioned in his Dhamma- rajaka inscription, ii98 A.D., as stated above133. It takes off, says StewartlM, "from a weir on the Zawgyi near Hanmyinbo, and flows north parallel with the Shan hills, till it empties into the Sunye Tank." (iv) Canal near Paleik in the north of the district. Under date I202 A.D., the Odeindaung inscription135 mentions rice-fields at Pulim (? Paleik) "east of the canal." Presumably the Paleik canal. "The Zidaw canal" says Stewart (p. 65) "takes off from the left bank of the Zawgyi at Kyaukse. This canal, branching into the Myaungzon and Paleik Canals, irrigates all the area north of Kyaukse and west of the Zawgyi as far as the Myitnge River, which forms the northern boundary of the district." (v) Kiok chafi, 'the dam of Klok.' This famous dam gives its name to Kyaukse, a town built on the site of three old villages: Kiok (centre), Sayof (north) and PloI (west)136. The Chronicles attribute it to Canisfi II (Narapatisithu)137. This may be right. In inscriptions, it is first mentioned in connection with his successor, Natoh Skhih or Ndtohmya'38. It was then under Mlacst (Myittha). The land was so valuable, that at least two separate enquiries into it were made in the latter part of the Pagan period. There were Kiok cha ii kr and nay, 'big and small dams of Kick'; also Klok-chani mliy khlan, 'sour earth Kyaukse'. Towards the end of the period a good many other mroi, 'canals', are mentioned:- 130 Mrofichumi. I.B., P1. I 9033 (and Zeyyaput ink duplicate, line 38). The date is doubtful. Ra Prai chaii is probably all right. The name occurs also at P1. I 138 (550 s./ii88 A.D.); I 676 (593 S./1231-2 A.D.); II 17513; III 2332; IV 388w (Kuld nat to the south of it); V 492 a16, 27-28 (713 S./1351 A.D.; mentions of Mrohchuth-kri, Mrohchuti-hai). 131 Myaungz6n inscription: List 7I2-3 4 (53I s./ii69 A.D.). Final date 744 s/1383 A.D. This marble stone is now Stone i8 in the Mandalay Palace Shed. 132 List II 321 (545 s./i i83 A.D.). The inscription is in the Sulamani temple, Pagan. It is a good, early Copy. 133 See note I28, supra. 134 Kyaukse District Gazetteer, Vol. A, p. 65. 135 I read this fine two-faced Odeindaung inscription when it was moved to the gate of Paleik dak-bungalow. It has now been moved to Mandalay Palace Shed. The reference to the mroi&amp; is on line I I of the obverse, under date 56(4) S./1202 A.D. 'Paleik' (Pulip) seems to be written Pulim at line 29. The main date is 602 S./1241 A.D. 136 With the Klok Sayoh of the Kyauks6 Old Mon inscription mentioned above, cf. Sayoh Ploh rwa of I.B., P1.

We read of land "east of Krakcim (Kyetsein) village, south of JSamcwan (Ngazun) village, on the east side of the Big Canal"; also of a ricefield at "Pumna, 'Brahman' village, west of the Big Canal." -The latter still exists, half a mile north-east of Singaing. Kyetsein is 3 miles south of it. Ngazun is clearly not the distant village of that name on the Thindwe Canal. The Big Canal, one imagines, like the Paleik Canal today, took off from the Zawgyi river and flowed north, roughly parallel to the present Mandalay road. (vii) Marhak mroi, Pailai mron140. In I303 A.D. we read of land "below the Marhak (Mashet) canal and above the Pailai (Pinle) canal". Mashet is north-northwest of Myittha, and Pinle south of Kume. One wonders if these canals were two sections of a single one, the Sama Canal. "The Sama Canal" says Stewart141, "takes off from the left bank of the Panlaung at Kyime Weir, near Kume. The remodelled canal, 24 miles in length, irrigates the area between the Panlaung and Samon (west of Myittha and Ywamongyi) to a point due west of Kyaukse." (viii) Cathmd mroit142, the Sama Canal, first mentioned by this name in I296 A.D., in connection with land "west of Pwailaft (Pwinlin) on the Sama Canal, 26 pai, from Carap rait (Zayat-yin) to Can ton X (Sintaung-Q)." Other mroi (canals), busily created, it seems, during the Myinzaing/Pinya periods, must here be briefly listed:- (ix) Mroo khyap143, 67i-686 S./I309-24 A.D. Perhaps near Myinzaing. (x) Na Lakpa* mroA144, 686-696 S./I324-34 A.D. Probably near Letpan village, Thindaung, north of Kyaukse. Perhaps the Minye Canal of today (see Stewart, p. 65). (xi) Mron near Takkalai145, 7I3 S.fI35I A.D. In KhaMmlt kharuin, near Tetkale Ywagon, Paleik, I7 miles north of Kyaukse. (xii) Mroin-146 'Head of the Canal', 729 s./I367 A.D. Perhaps north of, or near, Takkalai (Tetkal'). (xiii) Mroit-ma147, 'main canal', and Mroit-tim 'shallow canal,' 714 S./I352 A.D. The latter was to the east of the former. Perhaps in Panan kharuin. (xiv) Mroi krd'48, 72I s./I359 A.D. - A place 'between the canals' (?). KHARUIN, TUIK, NUINISTAAM "So far as I can guess from the inscriptions as a whole, kharutin was a term applied only to the earliest homes of the Burmans in the plains; which they regarded more especially as their own, with (at any rate in Kyaukse) a landed aristocracy of wealth, and a regular system of land-measurement and registration. Beyond the kharuin, were the tuik areas where Burmans mixed more freely, perhaps, with other tribes.

And beyond the tuik areas, again, were the non-Bur- mese frontier-areas, nuii-ita*, lands of 'the splendour of conquest.' - The three terms all appear in the first royal inscription in Burmese, that of the Dhammarajaka pagoda, Pagan (560 S./II98 A.D.)"149. Of the tuik areas (especially Pakokku and Shwebo), the Chronicles have little or nothing to say. Perhaps, in Aniruddha's time, the penetration of these rich areas, on the right bank of the Irawady, had barely begun. But the authors of the Hmannan add an interesting list, not given by U Kala, of 43 (or 44) towns'50, alleged to have been built simultaneously, under Aniruddha's orders, to prevent infiltration from the eastern hills. The date given is near the end of 395 S./IO34 A.D., in the i6th year of his reign. The Hmannan dating is probably much too early. Accepting, as we provisionally do, the JdtdtoiP6u* dates, the i6th year would be io6I A.D., not long after the king's campaigns in the south. This is plausible enough. The campaigns had taught him that effective control of immigration, whether of friend or foe, from the eastern hills, was a sine qua non if Burma, in any large sense, was to be consolidated. The list of fortified towns is carefully arranged, running from north to south, from Kaungzin (Bhamo) to Toungoo. About a dozen of the names recur in Pagan period inscriptions; many, I fear, are anachronisms, belonging to later periods. Nearly all are pretty old, often the seat of a Burmese hereditary myothu-gyi; and since the terrain is limited, they give some idea, I suspect, of Aniruddha's strenuous efforts to solve his primary problem. Almost all the forts are in the plains; and between Bhamo and Mandalay, nearly all are on or near the banks of the Irawady. Everything east of this, at any rate above the foothills, was non-Burma, unless it came under the outer category of n'itini-iaM, lands of 'the splendour of conquest.' From the time of Caiisfi II, this outermost boundary is usually placed at the River Salween 51. Here is the list, with modern pronunciation, literal transcription, and short description.152 43 FORTRESS TOWNS i.

Kaungzin. Old Burm. Kohcan.153- If Aniruddha and his son never reached Bhamo, they came pretty near it when they built pagodas near Nga-o, at the top of the Shweli bend towards Shwegu and Katha. On the way they must have visited Tagaung, the Kadu capital. There is no hint of conquest. I suspect that they went as allies and fellow-Buddhists, to stop Nan-chao encroach- ments. Na ChoA Khyam, the fortress, is not mentioned in our list; but in ii96 A.D. Cafisfl II claims as his northern frontiers "Takoit, Na Chon Khyant, Ucho(tika ?), ...yan- plai, and the Banyan Tree"l". Later, it seems, Tagaung and the Kadu revolted; but after General Lakkhand's victorious campaign in I228155, near the end of NMtoilmyd's reign, a Governor of KoncaA was appointed, and the whole riverine north of Burma was held strongly, down to the Mongol invasions. Na Choit Khyam must have been close to KoncaA, the administrative centre, "the Town at the Head of the River" (Chiang-tcou) of Chinese sources156. It seems likely to have been modern Bhamo, at the junction of the Ta-pcing with the Irawady. Both fell to the Mongols on Dec. 9th, I283. Chinese texts say nothing about crossing the river; so either the river has changed its course since then, or the name Koitcait its meaning. 8. Katha, Old Burm. Kasd157. - The word occurs, with reference to an elephant, in an inscription dated I242 A.D., but I am not sure if it is a proper name. Elephants were kept (or caught or lost) in this thickly wooded Kadu region158. IO. Myadaung (Mratoit). - I have not found this name in Pagan inscriptions, but it was an old Bur- mese wun-ship; and I include it because of its suggestive associations. E. C. S. George, in his Ruby Mines District Gazetteer (p. i6) says that Pyin-le-bin, "the original parent village on the Lower Shweli" under its control, "was known as 'Kanthila' or 'Panthila'." Again, on p. 37, he mentions Gawdamapaya, a pagoda "situated about one mile to the east of Myadaung. Its antiquity is attested by the existence of clay votive tablets bearing Sanskrit and Bengali legends of the 8th and 9th centuries A.D." - All this reminds me, forcibly, of the votive tablets of Anirudha's son, Bajrabharana (P1. I5 d, e, f), found not only at Tagaung Odok pagoda, but also at "Kanthida old city, Katha district," said to be in Pyindaung village forest reserve, Inywa circle (see n. II5 supra). II. Tagaung. Old Burm. Takoit159. Chinese "Tuai-kung city of the Chien-ti" (Kadu). - This ancient city is first mentioned in Cafisil II's inscriptions of the Sulamani (II83) and Dhammarajaka (II96 A.D.).

It says that they had sent envoys to deliver a summons to the king of Mie (Burma), but there was no reply;" also that "Chien-tu, formerly controlled by Mien, had wanted to submit (to China)." Its king had now submitted. "Thai-kung city of the Chien-tu is Miei's nest and hole. The rebels relied on it to resist our army. We sent Buddhist monks to warn them of the consequences, good or evil, of their actions: but they were murdered. So we have advanced both by water and land, and attacked T'ai-kung city and captured it. Twelve walled towns of the Chien-tu, Gold Teeth, etc. have all submitted.

Nga Singu161 (]Va Can-' kit:). - I have not noted the name in Old Burmese, but in Chinese texts about the Mongol invasions it appears as A-che'n-kuo, A-chan-kuo or A-chen-ku. In the far north of Mandalay district, it was the southern point of the newly created Chinese province of Che'ng-mien. At the beginning of I300 Nga Singu and Male were temporarily recovered by Asailkhaya, eldest of the Shan Brothers. When the Mongols retreated after failing to capture Myinzaing, on April I4th I30I they reached Nga Singu and tried in vain to rally their forces. "The same day, by elephant, the mother of Kumdrakassapa (Tak-tau-mu-mankrT)162 arrived and said: 'The rebels held me captive in Myinzaing. I have only just managed to escape. If you had only waited five more days, the rebels would have been bound to surrender. What a pity you left so soon!"' i9. Yenatha. Old Burm.

The readings Thamoh (Khaphoii ?) and Talyuiw are not quite certain. CONTACTS WITH CEYLON After this long digression, we return to Aniruddha and the final years of his reign. His fame as a champion of Buddhism had reached Ceylon. If the Jinakdlamdlf is to be trusted, he may already have received some books of the Tipitaka from the Ceylon king. But nothing in all the temples of his reign suggests a knowledge of more than the Jataka and the Eight Scenes of Gotama Buddha's life. A typical monkish story of Ratanapannafia (I5i6 A.D.), gives the North Siam version, so like, so different from the Burma legend, and, it seems, equally old. It tells of the coming to Siam from Ceylon of the famous Emerald Buddha, the palladium of Thailand. Here is the gist of it. Anuruddha, son of Dhammardja, reigned in 656 A.D. (sic!) at Arimaddana. Full of faith in the Reli- gion, he is eager to obtain accurate copies of the Scriptures. As soon as he hears that they are ob- tainable in Ceylon, he flies thither on his magic steed, his escort following by boat. The Ceylon king offers to have them copied. "Oh, no" says Aniruddha, "let me do them myself." After copying the Tipitaka and a number of grammatical works, he returns with two sets in one boat, and two in another together with the Emerald Buddha. The former arrives at Pagan safely; the latter, caught in a storm, reaches Mahanagara or Angkor Thoim. Hearing of this, Aniruddha flies thither on his magic horse, alights near a monastery, and makes water. A monk, observing that his urine splits the rock, asks who he is. He announces himself as a servant of Anuruddha. The Khmer king refuses to resign the two copies. Anuruddha fashions a wooden sword, dips the blade in (red) chalk, mounts his magic steed, and 170 I.B., P1. I 6o b3 Ta-ui khranisiy (59I S./I229 A.D.). P1.

Each Khmer, finding the red stain on his neck, is terrified. The king surrenders the copies. Anuruddha returns with them to Pagan, but forgets to take the Emerald Buddha! It is not easy to see how a ship bound from Ceylon to the mouth of the Irawady, could be swept by a storm to the mouth of the Mekhong: but substitute the Mon, for the Khmer, capital, and the prob- lem is solved. One ship makes land successfully at Bassein; the other, driven by the south-west monsoon, is shipwrecked near Thaton, where the king flouts Aniruddha by claiming it as lawful prize. But, first, who was the king of Ceylon? - The Hmannan Chronicle, more than usually wrong, insists that he was Dhdtusena'78. Dhdtusena reigned in the latter half of the 5th century A.D.179 Ani- ruddha's contemporary must have reigned in the iith. U Kala rightly says that he was Sirisaltgha- bodhi180- a title shared by several kings of Ceylon. The young prince Kfrti (or Kitti) had started his revolt about the middle of the century. Aged i6 or i8, after disposing of his rivals, he assumed the name Vijayabcdhu I from about I055 A.D.181 He resolved to drive the 8aivite Colas out of the island. It took him I5 years of desperate fighting to do so. At some date before his I2th year (i067) he was in great straits, unable to pay his soldiers, who were beginning to desert him. He sent to his fellow- Buddhist, "the king in the Rdmani-fa country," an urgent appeal for help. Aniruddha responded. "Then arrived in the harbour many ships laden with various stuffs, camphor, sandalwood and other goods. By all kinds of valuable gifts he inclined the soldiers to him, and with large forces at his com- mand, he took up his abode in Tambalagdma."1182 This was in the south of the island. It was only in I070 A.D., the I5th year of his reign, that he recovered Pulatthinagara (Polonnaruva) and Anurddha- Pura, drove out the Colas, and made himself master of the whole of Ceylon. "Thereupon he betook himself to splendid Pulatthinagara and dwelt there, known by the name of Sirisathghabodhi."''l8 In his i8th year (4073/74) he celebrated his abhiseka at Anuradhapura. From I017 to I070 Ceylon had been subject to the Colas; and when the king took in hand the revival of Buddhism, there were not enough bhikkhlus to form a chapter for holding ordination and other ceremonies. "He sent to his friend, PrinceAnuruddha in the Ramanifia country, messengers with gifts and fetched thence bhikkhus who had thoroughly studied the three Pitakas, who were a fount of moral discipline and other virtues, and acknowledged as theras. After distinguishing them by costly gifts, the king had the ceremonies of world-renunciation and of admission into the Order 178Hmannan, Vol. I, pp. 264-5. G.P.C. (transl.), pp. 89-go. 179 G. C.

So His Majesty had Buddhist priests invited from Aramaana [Rdmafifia] (to Ceylon), and (with their aid) effected the purification of the Buddhist Order of the Three Fraternities (nikaya)." It seems unlikely that Aniruddha could have received from Ceylon more than a trickle of texts before Vijayabdhu recovered the two capitals in I070 A.D.; but very likely that he obtained as many copies as he wanted by about I075, when Burma monks (probably Mons) were busy in Ceylon helping the Singhalese to revive Buddhism in the island. If so, the main flood of the Tipitaka only reached Pagan in the closing years of Aniruddha's reign. The Glass Palace Chronicle says186 that on the capture of Thaton Aniruddha obtained, not only sacred Relics, but also 30 sets of the Pitaka and monks well versed in them. The JinakalamalT says he obtained 4 sets from Ceylon. There is a good deal of fairy-tale in both texts, and doubtless ex- aggeration in the former. Now the abundant glosses on paintings and terracottas in the early temples of Pagain, prove that the writers used standard Singhalese texts for most of the four Nikdyas, but two recensions, similar but different, for the Jataka. The earlier, possibly South Indian, recension 187 adds 3 Jdtakas (497 Velhma, 498 Mahdgovinda, 499 Sumedhapandita), thus changing the numbers of all the last 50 Jdtakas, and bringing the total up to 550. The later recension, which we can date quite closely from Kyanzittha's revision of the Tipitaka, after I090 A.D.188, is clearly Singhalese, and totals only 547. And there are a good many other minor differences between the recensions. In the Pyu temples of 8r! Ksetra (7th-8th century), the Jataka was never illustrated. Nor (I think) does it appear in Dvdravati art. Its vast popularity in Burma dates from the carvings of the Mahcdnipata at the Kalydni Simd and Thagya Paya at Thaton, and the pan1it inscription there, before its capture by Aniruddha189. The old recension, as seen on the Hpetleik pagodas at Pagan, was doubtless based on Thaton texts, possibly imported from KdAcipura. From the first Aniruddha used them to adorn the groundplinth of his Shwe-hsan-daw pagoda190, and later the corridors of Hpetleik. 184 ibid., ch. 6o, vv. 4-8. 185 See Wickremasinghe, Epig. Zeylan., II, pp. 242-255. Inscr. No. 40 (Tamil/Grantha inscription of Polonnaruva). See also the Ceylon University History of Ceylon, Vol, I, Part II, p. 434. Of the Tamil inscription Mr. C. W. Nicholas writes: - "It confirms the Ci2lavakhsa in important respects: - the victory of Vijayabahu; the arrival in Ceylon of Buddhist monks from Aramanaa(Burma) at the king's invitation and the purification of the Buddhist Order of the three Nikayas with their aid; the bestowal of money on the three Nikayas; and the king's reign of fifty-five years." On p. 436 he adds: - "Vijayabahu died in iiio/ii in the fifty-fifth year of his reign and at the age of seventy-three." 186 Hmannan I, p. 250-I. G.P.C.

In the Hmannan, even when the king is planning an expedition to Ceylon (G.P.C. p. 88), Kyanzittha volun- teers to conquer all Jambudipa for him. Four pages later (p. 92), near the end of the reign, he is sent to Pegu to fight the Krom. He returns victorious, escorting the gift-princess, daughter of the Pegu king. On the way he makes love to her: and Aniruddha, furious, tries to kill him, and forces him to become an outlaw. - The war with the Krom, as we have seen, is likely to have taken place near the beginning of the reign, not near the end. This story, therefore, is probably not historical. Apart from this, there is no hint of disloyalty on Kyanzittha's part. The general never takes up arms against the sovereign, as Labienus did against Julius Caesar. Yet there is no doubt that the breach was absolute. Kyanzittha has left a number of long inscriptions, all in Mon. Never once does he claim relationship with Aniruddha. Never once does he even mention him. He claims descent, not from the Pagan line, but from the Pyu line of Sri Ksetra, as an Avatar of Visnu, prophesied by the Buddha. Old Burmese inscriptions of the Pagan period call him simply Tciluifi mafi, 'king of Htilaing.' I have argued elsewhere191 that this Htilaing may well have been in Kyaukse. And the Chronicles agree that when he was called to the rescue during the siege of Pagan, he was "ruling the Eleven Ledwin villages,"192 i.e. Kyaukse. Later writers of the early Ava period, probably for propaganda reasons, have tampered with Kyanzittha's history. There have been both suppression veri and suggestiofalsi. Perhaps it started with the Taungbyon Hledauk inscription193, where he is described as " T'iluifi asyafi Kalancacsd, a beloved son of king Norathi." In original Burmese inscriptions he is always Tciluifi mafi, 'King of Htilaing,' never T'iluifi syafi, 'lord of Htilaing.' Here we are concerned with Aniruddha rather than Kyanzittha. But no fair judgement of Aniruddha can ignore his treatment of Kyanzittha. The quarrel went very deep. - Was its root really, one wonders, a feud between Kyaukse and Pagaln? Early Burmese chiefs, before they conquered Kyaukse (we have Fan Chco's word for it)194, were called mafi, 'king'. They would hardly have given up their rights without a struggle. Kyanzittha's reaction against the autocratic ways of his great predecessor, peeps out from this sentence in one of his own inscrip- tions: "He shall maintain the succession of all the kings of old"195. Was Kyanzittha the last of the Kyaukse mani to maintain his title against the monarchical pretensions of Pagan ? - If so, there would be strong reason for the feud. If Tciluifi was but a minor kingship buried in a large kharuin, this would only make his struggle the more heroic. And if one adds the feeling of ingratitude, which Kyanzittha must have felt towards a king whose battles he had fought from Nan-chao to the Isthmus of Kra, one can understand his refusal either to compromise or to forgive. Loyal he remained to the end. He was willing to risk his life to save Aniruddha's son, but not to bate one jot of his ancestral rights. One can understand also his resolve, which shines through his inscriptions, to unite Burma by consent rather than by force. '"I J.B.R.S.

The more subtle frauds are those which we historians, who live in a different, more sophisticated, and (dare I say it?) coarse and vulgar age, commit without being aware of it. The only cure I know is to steep oneself imaginatively in the age one writes about, until one feels instinctively the true from the sham. Let me give some instances. I distinguish three main styles in genuine old Pagan inscriptions:- (i) Early Burmese style. - "54I S., Magha year, Wednesday, full moon of Mlwaytd. Gilded all the reverend bodies of the Tuiitkhet gods, shaded them with gold umbrellas, and made them golden thrones. Gilded Lord Sdriputtrd, and gilded Lord Mokkaldn. Gilded two Lords Gavathpati. Asked for the Sermon of the Wheel of Law. And asked for the Sermon on Causal Genesis. Gave I5 monastic robes. And fed I5 monks. And gave the chief Tuifikhet monk the cooked rice-offering... And having dedicated to the Reverend One myself, wife, and two children, wrote the stone inscription196."' - This plain prosaic bone-dry factual style reads like archaic Chinese. For history, it is the per- fect material. And there is pathos in it, never overdone. (ii) Alaungsithu's Pali style. - "There was a king... great in knowledge, who took delight in hearing the good Law. This lord of men, ruling in righteousness and equity,. . . pointed and caused to be made for the great Seer, Gotama Buddha, this pleasant and delightful fragrant chamber, adorned with many cetiyas and figures of gods, as though it were raised on high ground, sheltering a wonder- working image ... like unto the living Buddha, radiant with glory, fair to look on, delightful to the mind. The supreme Three Pitakas he made and copied, and clad the monks with many a set of triple robes. Serenely happy, he fed them with his own hands at the temple-festival. Then in strong desire for Buddhahood, he cried aloud this prayer197". . . - This shows the flamboyant influence of India, with its plethora of adjectives; but underlying it, there is, I feel, native restraint and modesty. (iii) Kyanzittha's Mon Style. - "His fame shall be known over the world. His hardness shall be as iron. The goodlaws of morality he shall maintain. Vice which is even as a stench, with virtue which is even as a perfume, he shall abolish. Sins too foul for cleansing, of body, word or thought, with clear water of morality he shall wash them all away. The gods who take the clasped hollows of men's hands, who grasp their godly sceptres made of adamant, shall be his servants, his ministers of good works. Thieves who are even as thorns, enemies who are as dense jungle - throughout his kingdom there shall be none. It shall spread wide as ocean ...198" - This is fine literature, full of poetry and beauty, but with a simplicity and clarity that are Mon, I think, not Indian nor Burmese. And now for the sham:- "Now when she reached Pareimma, and Nawrahta-minzaw's child in her womb was ready to be born, there was a great earthquake. And Nawrahta-minzaw questioned his masters of white magic and black, saying, 'Why quaketh the earth'? And they spake into his ear: 'O king, one who shall be king hath been conceived in the north quarter.' And Nawrahta-minzaw, it is said, made search for all women with child in the north quarter, and put to death over seven thousand. 196 I.B., PI.

And the king questioned his masters of white magic and black, saying 'Is he dead'? And they spake into his ear: 'Not dead, but born from his mother's womb!' And he made search, it is said, for all suckling babes in the cradle, and again killed over six thousand. But Kyanzittha was hidden by the Naga youth, and died not but escaped. And the king asked: 'Is he dead'? And they answered: 'Not dead yet, but the size of a cowboy!". .. (etc.)199 - There is nothing bad about this passage as style: but it is bad history. The Massacre of the In- nocents is of course well-known folklore. But even if one does not know this, but knows Pagan inscrip- tions, one feels at once that it is sham. The relations of kings, ministers and people are quite false, as well as their mentalities. Yet simple Burmans, brought up on tales like this, may well imagine that their Pagan ancestors, notably Aniruddha, were savages! The scandals told in the Chronicles about the 'Ari' heretics in the time of Aniruddha,200are not supported by any evidence of value. The independent testimony of the Cfflavamsa, quoted already, may suffice to prove that Pagan Buddhism in the time of Aniruddha was not the degraded cult which later Burmese authors liked to imagine. It also confirms one's belief that over and above the strategic motives which no doubt guided Aniruddha, there was an intense religious impulse. It was an age of national expansion, but not of crude imperialism, such as was later to impel some kings of Burma to showy and short-lived conquests of Siam, Assam or Manipur. If the Pagan period was free, as free it seems, from the sordid, the vulgar and the pretentious, it was due chiefly to religion. It was this new- discovered soul within him which strained the energies, inspired the art and architecture, breathed through the writings, and even guided the Pagan government. WORKS OF MERIT OF THE REIGN A final word about Aniruddha's works of merit. Apart from votive tablets and Jdtaka plaques, his contribution to Pagan architecture seems small compared to Kyanzittha's, but it has its importance. He appears to have built little except stupas. Here his influence lay in the elimination of the harmikd or 'belvedere', the cubic box placed originally above the an~a or dome of the stupa. It held, rather too conspicuously, the precious relics; and also supported the pole or metal mast (Skt. yasti, Old Burm. tc:), that bore the tiers of umbrellas (chattrdvali). Already, on encased stupas at 8ri Ksetra201, the harmikci was omitted; but conservative Ceylon retained it202. So do many stupas at Paga'n, both Singhalese and pre-Singhalese. But the general tendency has been to follow Aniruddha. The Pagan stupa will reach full evolution only in the Shwezigon (Pls. i69-17I), built about io86 A.D. by Kyan- zittha, with its three square receding terraces, lined with Jdtaka plaques, crested with corner-stupas, stepped with median stairways. Aniruddha's reign was certainly of prime importance in the evolution of the Pagan temple; but it is not yet clear what part the king played in it, apart from the central fact that he captured That6n and carried off thence, not only books of the Pitaka, but also all the architects and artists he could lay his 199 U Kala, I, p. i69 (paragraph 238).

The description in the Chronicles203, though marred by ana- chronism ("forgers of cannon and muskets") and the beauty-parlour frou-frou of an idler age, catches the excitement of a new world dawning: "He brought away the sacred relics, kept in a jewelled casket and worshipped by a line of kings in Thaton. And he placed the thirty sets of the Pitaka on the king's thirty-and-two white elephants, and brought them away... Thereafter he sent away separately, without mixing, such men as were skilled in carving, turning, and painting; masons, moulders of plaster and flower-patterns; blacksmiths, silversmiths, braziers, founders of gongs and cymbals, filagree flower-workers; doctors and trainers of elephants and horses; makers of shields round and embossed, of divers kinds of shields, of shields both oblong and convex; forgers of cannon, muskets and bows; men skilled in frying, parching, baking and frizzling; yakin hair-dressers, and men cunning in perfumes, odours, flowers and the juices of flowers. Moreover to the noble Order who knew the books of the Pitaka, he made fair appeal and brought them away. He also took king Manuha and his family and returned home to Pugardma." The chief architectural works are described separately in Part C of this book. Here we may briefly list and roughly date the more certain attributions. Many of the dates assigned are guesswork. i. Myinkaba Zedi, Pagan. (P1. 79 a). The site where Aniruddha killed his half-brother on the north bank of Myinkaba Chaung. Octagonal terrace. Date: C. I044 A.D. 2. 'Maung Di' pagoda, Kha-bin (Pls. 79b). Octagonal terraces lined with Aniruddha's largest tablets (Pls. 4, 5). Date: c. I050 A.D. 3. Shwe'-hsan-daw (Mahapeinne') pagoda, Pagan (Pls. 83-87). Fivesquareterraceswithmedian stairways and corner-gnomons. Lowest plinth with unglazed unglossed Jdtaka-plaques. Also the Shinbin Thalyaung colossal reclining Buddha. Date: c. io6o A.D. 4. Lokananda Zidi, Thiripyissaya. (P1. 92). Three octagonal terraces and four median flights of steps. Date: c. io6o A.D. (?). 5. West and East Hpetleik pagodas, Thiripyissaya (Pls. 94-II8). Largely repaired by Aniruddha, who added to each a corridor housing a set of the 550 Jatakas (old recension). Date: c. I070 A.D. 6. Pitakat-taik, near the palace-site, Pagan (Pls. 80-82). 'Mon' style cube with central shrine and corridor, to hold manuscripts obtained from Thaton, etc. Date: c. io6o A.D. Other works thought to date from this, or preceding reigns:- 7. Manuha temple, Myinpagan (PlS. II9, I20), with four colossal images (3 seated, i reclining). c. io6o A.D. Attributed to the captive king of Thaton. 8. Nan-paya temple, Myinpagan (Pls. I2I-I3I). Buddhist temple, 'Mon' style, brick faced with stone. With four Brahma pillars, Kyak tri amd Makara pediments, etc. Perhaps the private chapel of the captive king of Thaton. c. Io6o-70 A.D. 9. Kyaukku Onhmin, east of Nyaung-u (Pls. I32-I42). Cave-facade with stone facing, frieze, perforated windows, carved stone jambs and wooden lintels. Colossal stone Buddha. Stone reliefs of the life of the Buddha. Date: c. I060-70 A.D. There is real breath-taking mystery about the temples of this early period. For it is hard to attribute the Nat-hlaung-gyaung, the Nan-paya, and the Kyaukku Onhmin to any later reign: each a masterpiece, 203 U Kala, Vol. I, p. i83 (paragraph 25I). Hmannan, Vol. I, pp. 250I.

They spring up suddenly, like mushrooms, from the sand and dust of Pagan. So far as we yet know, Aniruddha had no hand in them. But who had? - Do we err in stressing the 'personality-cult'? Are they rather the the natural efflorescence of a young people? Let us end this superficial chapter on the note of doubt. Archaeology is still in its infancy in Burma. Compared to India, Ceylon, Java and Camboja, we have barely scratched the soil. Until we excavate Vesdli and Mahdmuni in Arakan, Kanthida and Tagaung in the north of Burma, Tenasserim and Khabin in the south, how can we claim to know the truth about Aniruddha? From meagre and often poor materials, we have given merely the skeleton of the age and of the man. Patient sub-soil research alone will allow us to put flesh on the bones, and possibly (who knows ?) revive in just proportions the true greatness of the Maker of Burma.</page><page sequence="64">CHAPTER III MAN LULAN (Saw Lu); d. I084 A.D. Names, title and regnal dates - Nga Raman's rebellion - battle of Praitawsd-klwan - murder of king - siege of Pagan - Kyanzittha to the rescue - pact with Makuta's family (?)- works of merit of the reign. NAMES, TITLE AND REGNAL DATES Man Lulah, 'the young king', doubtless the son of Aniruddha, is mentioned in one original in- scription', as ordering a legal enquiry into a Paga6n dedication. The name occurs in a list of Paga6n kings, just before T'iluin maA (Kyanzittha). It is clearly the Burmese equivalent of the half-Nanchao 'Saw Lu' (Caw Lu, Co: Lii:) of later inscriptions2 and the Chronicles.3 U Mya, the archaeologist, first suggested to me (he is certainly right) that Saw Lu is the Pagan king who "made with his own hand" a terracotta votive tablet found in Myinpyagu temple, Pagan, with a Pali inscription similar to many of Aniruddha, but signed Maharac)ja Sirs Bajrcbharanadeva, "Fortunate Shining One, Bearer of the Thunderbolt4." The same title recurs, as we have seen, in a fragmentary Pali inscription below a noble stone relief of the Buddha seated in a forest of lotus, probably found in Maung Law kwin, south-east of Mergui5. It used to be seen in the hall of Rangoon University Library, but was blown to bits by the Japanese. The inscription mentioned the "excellent lord of the Three Existences" (the worlds of men, devas and brahmas), "Srf Bajrdbharana, famous in the world... like a lion in the forest... in the excellent city of Arimaddana. .." i.e. Pagan. Little else is legible. The donor is clearly a king of Pagan; the script shows that he was an early one. He is not Aniruddha, but copies Aniruddha's style; whereas the next king, Kyanzittha, invented a different sort of title, in which he was followed by all his successors. The king, therefore, should be Man Lulah. This stone, discovered IO miles south-east of Mergui6, indicates that Aniruddha's conquests reached to the very south of Burma, if not beyond. "It is curious" says Carapiett7, "that Mergui Burmese invariably refer to outside Burmese (i.e. those who come from any part of Burma north of Tavoy) as 'Pagan."' The oldest Burmese inscription found near Mergui8 also belongs to the Pagan period. 1 I.B., P1. 6o a2. The stone is in situ at the top of Mt. Thetso. The date at the head of the inscription is probably 573 S./I2II A.D., the year of Ndtofimyd's accession. The final date (Reverse, line 4) is 59I S./I229 A.D. 2 e.g. List 321, Mandalay Palace Shed Stone 7, 444 s./io82 A.D. 3 U Kala, Mahayazawingyi, Vol. I, pp. 205-2II.

This too was lodged in Rangoon University Library until it was blown up by the Japanese; the lower part is still extant, but the top is lost, including the date. NGA RAMAN S REBELLION Saw Lu's regnal dates, as given in the Jdtct6pu* Rdjavan9, are 439-446 s.fc. I077-84 A.D. The latter year is certainly the date of Kyanzittha's accession. Burmese Chronicles regard Saw Lu as a son of Aniruddha, and as a young scapegrace who perished by his own folly in a rebellion started by one Nga Rama6n or Nga Raman-kan'0 ('one-eyed Raman'), which - but for Kyanzittha - might well have proved the ruin of Burmese power in Burma, not only in the south, but in the centre. The story, in brief, is as follows: - BATTLE OF PRANTWSA KLWAN Nga Raman was a Pagan courtier, son of Saw Lu's tutor. Saw Lu had appointed him governor of Pegu. In hot words after dicing, Saw Lu dares him to revolt. He does so promptly, for he is plotting already. He leads an army and fleet, perhaps of Mon troops, up the Irawady. The frontier-post was then the island Kyidndaw (Prantawsd kiwan) below Migyaung-ye, in the south of Magwe district. The site of the disastrous battle, fought in the darkness of the night, is locally remembered. Saw Lu was captured; and Nga Raman advanced to Myinkaba on the outskirts of Pagan. Meantime Kyanzittha escaped and rode full speed to Pagan, where the ministers offered him the kingship. He refused, saying that first he must try and rescue the king. He was in the midst of doing so, when Saw Lu, fearing his intentions, gave the alarm. Kyanzittha could barely escape, swimming across the broad river. He fled north and reached the northern borders of Shwebo and Mandalay districts (Nga Singu, Shein-maga); then, recrossing the river and going south, he won the powerful support of the headman of Nga Singaing, north of Kyaukse'. From his fief, Htilaing (T'iluiA), apparently also in Kyaukse, he "held court in the Eleven Villages of Ledwin", i.e. the Eleven kharuin. Here he builds up an army in order to recover Pagan. MURDER OF THE KING. SIEGE OF PAGAN Nga Raman, meantime, had murdered the captive king. The Pagan ministers refuse to open their gates to him until he has conquered Kyanzittha. So he advances to Ava, at the mouth of the Myit-nge. Here first, after magic rites and a great battle, Kyanzittha defeats him and drives him back to Pagan. Driven south again from Myinkaba, the rebel was finally killed by an arrow in his good eye, shot by the Singaing headman. The site was at Lower Singu, 30 miles south of Pagan. KYANZITTHA TO THE RESCUE Tradition, and the Chronicles, are here probably not far wrong. In his own contemporary Mon inscriptions, Kyanzittha describes the crisis in poetic style, under guise of a prophecy made by Gavam- pati on behalf of the Buddha: - 9 Jdtdtopwm Rdjavafi, ed. by U Hla Tin, p. 39 (No. 43). 10 Written 9a Raman by U Kala, 9a Ramankan: in the Hmannan. Col. Ba Shin gives me the explanation. Nga Raman, according to the Chronicles, "had only one good eye." Burmese han:, 'blind' is a borrowing from Sanskrit/ Pali kdna, 'one-eyed.' Spelt kan, and meaning 'blind,' the word occurs twice in Lokahteikpan glosses (c. I120 A.D.), in some of the oldest Burmese writings extant. See Ba Shin, The Lokahteikpan (Rangoon, i962), Glosses 92, 115.</page><page sequence="66">48 Chapter mI "His Majesty's desires - quickly they shall be fulfilled. When raiding enemies come up to destroy Pagan, and all four castes of people living there are borne off captive downstream and go to other countries, by the strength, lift and energy of the king, swiftly shall they ascend upstream and take their solace in Pagan again. Of those torn from their dear ones, of those who were sick at heart, by a course of benefits, with water of compassion, with loving-kindness which is even as a hand, he shall wipe their tears, he shall wash away their snot. With his right hand rice and bread, with his left hand ornaments and apparel, he shall give to all his people. Like children resting in their mother's bosom, so shall the king keep watch over them and help them."" PACT WITH MAKUTA S FAMILY (?) Perhaps there are also references to the crisis in a few Burmese inscriptions - not very old or good ones, let us admit, but serving to explain problems else insoluble. The oldest is the reverse of the so- called 'Manuha' inscription, now Stone 9 in the Mandalay Palace Shed'2. There are also two 'Copies' in the Mahdmuni pagoda collection, Mandalay. The dates vary in all three, and all are wrong. The first, though listed as 'Original' by Duroiselle, is written in coarse late cursive - i6th century, I should guess. The king is called Narapaticanisii (Narapatisithu), a name applicable in late inscriptions to almost any king of Pagan. He has a daughter Rhwe-im-sani (Shwe-eng-thi), said in the Chronicles to be a daughter of Kyanzittha'3. The gist of the inscription is as follows: - The Thaton king, Manuho, had a son Sudhammarac, whose son was prince Asawatdhammd. The latter hid at Mt. Popa the royal golden boat of king Narapatican-sif... The king said: "Asawat- dhamma, restore the boat, and I will feed you full with rice." So he restored the boat. And when the king heard that the boat had come, he betrothed his royal daughter, Rhwe-im-sani (Shwe-eng-thi), to Asawatdhammd's son, Nakasman; and gave him also to enjoy many villages of slaves, and curry made of 30 pots of rice and I5 cattle gelded and tender... It is a strange story. If there is any truth in it, it appears that Makuta's grandson, exiled at Pagan, was planning rebellion; and to that end had managed to carry off to Mt. Popa the Pagan king's regalia. He was, however, dissuaded by the king from his intention, and handsomely rewarded in various ways, not least by his son's marriage into the Burmese royal family. If this is right, the one moment when it might easily have occurred, was at the height of Nga Rama6n's rebellion. After the battle of Prafftawsd kiwan everything was in confusion. The rebel advanced to Myinkaba, where Makuta's family was settled. Nga Raman, coming from Pegu, would have had Mon forces under him, but he was not a Mon. Makuta's family may have distrusted him, while they trusted the disgraced Kyanzittha, then withdrawn to Kyaukse'. They had no option but to attempt a counter- rebellion. They stole in the confusion some of the Pagan regalia, and set up their standard on Mt. Popa. It was a perilous moment: for many Mons would have been glad to rally round their former royalty. Nga Raman's Mons might well have joined them; and apart from these, the bulk of the population from Yamethin southwards was probably Mon. When the Burmans called Kyanzittha to the rescue, he had two rivals in the field. At this moment he may well have made the fateful pact, 11 Epig. Birm. Vol. I, Part II, Inscr.

The event shows, I think, that he went further still, and promised that his heir should be no son of his, but the offspring of his daughter's union with the Mon prince. If so, it was the sort of treaty which, however necessary and honourable at the time, later Burmese patriots may have preferred to forget. WORKS OF MERIT OF THE REIGN The Chronicles say that Shin Arahan, the mahdthera, reproached Saw Lu for failing to advance his father's works of merit: "he lived only for wordly enjoyment14." The reproach, if authentic, was undeserved. Saw Lu followed his father, as we have seen, all over Burma, scattering, like him, his votive tablets signed 9rT Bajrdbharana: at Nan-u-taik south of Mandalay (P1. I5 d); at Odok pagoda, Tagaung, and at Kanthida old city, Katha (P1. I5 e, f). Near Mergui he left a finely carved Pali inscription (P1. I5 a); only the top few lines are known, but it doubtless recorded a Buddhist dedi- cation. In the 'royal quarter' south of the walls of Pagan, both he and his father have left their tablets at Myinpyagu15: a unique stupa-temple, deeply devotional, with Mon writing, paintings and Jdtakas, which must be the work of one or the other: perhaps Saw Lu, since Aniruddha seems not to have used the Mon language. U Mya reports a tradition that Saw Lu built the encased stupa near the riverbank north of Tawyagyaung monastery, Myinpagan16. He also reproduces a post-Pagan painting with Burmese gloss in the Pahto-thamya temple, which seems to attribute that superb masterpiece to Man LulaA17. There are also lateish Burmese inscriptions which attribute dedications to Saw Lu. The earliest (Early Ava period?) mentions one of over ioo pa of land in Kyaukse, by Colu maikri, in 444 S./1Io82 A.D. The stone is now at Mandalay Palace Shed, provenance unknown'8. It does not look as if Saw Lu spent all his time gambling. He lived in the most brilliant age of Burma's art and architecture; and I do not think we can deny him a share in its development. The Pahto-thamya is not only the first fully evolved 'Mon' temple at Pagan, but in some ways the richest and the loveliest. It is the first to exploit the vast field of the Tipitaka, obtained from Ceylon probably after I070 A.D., when Vijayabdhu at last regained the whole island from the Colas, and invited monks from Burma to come and help to revive Buddhism there. The Pahto-thamya resembles Kyan- zittha's temples, but precedes them. I should therefore date it c. io8o A.D. The earlier temples show little variety of theme, either in painting or carving, apart from the Jdtaka, which was perhaps the only series of texts Aniruddha got by his capture of Thaton.

KING OF TVILUIi4, NAMES AND ORIGIN The successor of Man Lulah was the great king known nowadays as Kyanzittha. The name is a modernized form of Kalan-cacsa, a title by which he is sometimes called in late inscriptions'. It may perhaps be translated 'the kalan Inspector .' Kalan was an old term for high government officers, male or female, civil or military, found at Pagan and in the villages. Kalan and saihpyait (Old Mon kalan, sumbeAi), Mon names probably in origin, occur frequently in Pagan inscriptions; but their meaning, in Old Burmese at any rate, was already vague. Kalan ranked lower than sa~fpyai. Kyanzittha's origins are obscure. The Chronicles3 hint doubt of his paternity, but place his birth at Pareimma, on the left bank of the Lower Chindwin, outside the borders of Tambadipa. Their authority is the Pareimma Htilaingshin pagoda inscription4: "King Dhiluniisyai built (this) cetf at Parirh capital (praft), his own birthplace." It is dated 469 s./II07 A.D., within Kyanzittha's own reign, earlier than any genuine dated Burmese inscription. Both style and spelling show that it belongs to the early Ava period, about 300 years later. ' List 5o a' (S.I.P., p. 4; A. i9: from H16dauk pagoda, Taungby6n, now at Mandalay Palace Shed, Stone 4, south face). List 33 (B II 903). The name Kalan-cacsd also occurs at I.B., P1. V 47I26 and List I44I1 (A 587); but it is not clear whether the reference is to the king of that name. 2 cacsa generally means 'soldier, son of war': but cac primarily means 'to sift, investigate'; and U Wun assures me that in Middle Burmese it meant a civil official, functions unknown. Dr. Than Tun has kindly given me over a dozen references to inscriptions. Only one of these (I.B., P1. I 63 a'7) is of the Pagan period: it occurs in a village- name near Rangoon - Cacsi proit ('Honest Inspector' ?). Cacsfik4 cassd occurs at List I3293 in an inscription of the early Ava period, probably from Kyauks6. Cacsiik4 here should mean the military governor of Kyaukse. Kalancacsd, referring to a local official (?), occurs in the Chaung-u Thamantaza inscription (P1. V 47126, 705s.); also at List 6667 (734 s.), a Pinya Shwezig6n inscription, where it is the name of "the headman of Laksac, son of the tutor (atfiin) of king TryaphyJ." Another Pinya inscription (I.B., P1. V 517 b5, 7i8 s.) mentions as a witness "the headman of Llheauka, ManA Cacsi." For other references see P1. IV 424 b, V 5i65; List 7543, 843", etc. Man Cacsa:, U Wun tells me, occurs also in the Manaw-hari Pyo of Nawad6-gyi (I579 A.D.), and the Thuza Pyo of Pad6thayaza (1741 A.D.). 3 U Kala, Vol. I, pp. i68-9; Hmannan (Susodhita ed.), Vol. I, p. 236; transl.

This is well-nigh incredible in view of all the other evidence. The only legible year-date is 473 S./IIII A.D.; but there may well have been others on the flaked base, and kings Turukple and Trydphyd are mentioned on the reverse, in the same hand. Once again, both style and spelling point to the early Ava period. Neither inscription, in my opinion, is valid for determining Kyanzittha's origins. His own claims to semi-divine or miraculous birth must also be rejected. He was clearly not a native of Lower Burma (he speaks of it as "other countries"6): yet he uses Mon regularly in his in- scriptions, and handles it like a master. This fact, and his unmistakable attachment to Mon culture and religion, point to Kyaukse as the place, if not of his birth, of his upbringing. In original Old Burmese he is called T'iluiit man, "the king of Htilaing7." - Where was Htilaing? - Harvey8 places it near Wundwin in the north of Meiktila district. Duroiselle9 places it (I know not where) in Myingyan district. The Gazetteer of Burma (I944) knows three villages of the name: one 4 miles south-west of Wundwin, one 6 miles south-east of Yamethin, one a little north of Toungoo. The Upper Burma Gazetteer (Part II, Vol. I, p. 237) mentions a Htilaing village "in the west of the Maw State, Myelat district, Southern Shan States." Wundwin Htilaing is the nearest of these to Kyaukse - barely 30 miles south-southwest of Myittha; the population there in Kyanzittha's time may have been largely Mon. But it is also clear, though I cannot yet locate it, that there was an older Htilaing in Kyaukse itself. A new inscription, undated (c. 800 s./I5th century, I should guess), found at Shwe Inbe pagoda neai Pegin, 3 miles south of Than-ywa in the east of the district, mentions (line 5) a ricefield "east of T'iluini". An older inscription, dated 687 s./I325 A.D.10, from Ngazun monastery north of Myinzaing, mentions "an old dedication to T'fluitA monastery". And an inscription from the Lemyet-hna pagoda, Myingondaing, dated 789 S./I427 A.D.11, records the good works of "the prince of Mrakkhquntuin, whoisthe lord of D'iluifi:" - the date and context show that this D'iluih askyah is not Kyanzittha but Man Lha, son of the reigning king, Mohnyin Thado. Further research, one hopes, may settle the question. The details of Kyanzittha's flight after the Kydndaw battle, suggest that he had to take a roundabout route in order to reach his fief, in or near Kyaukse. His daughter, Ui Nrim San of Khah-fin12, was certainly connected with Kyaukse: Khah-un, whether her birthplace or appanage, was a famous place in the north of the district, probably in the south of Makkhard kharuin13. She owned land at Uttwait'4, possibly the Oktwin in east Myingyan, between Natogyi and Pyinzi; for in her old age she rebuilt and endowed the Shwemoktaw at Klaykan village, modern Paya-gyi, 4 miles south-east of Natogyi15. 5 List 50 a', now Stone 4 (obv.) at Mandalay Palace Shed, A ig, S.I.P., pp. 4-6. 6 des c-an (Epig.

PAGAN In post-Pagan inscriptions the term T'iluiA maA, 'king of Htilaing,' is softened to T'iluin syaA, 'lord of Htilaing.16' Man:, 'king', which originally, like the inferior term sitkr::, meant merely 'the old man, elder, senior' of a village-tract or region, soon became a term reserved for Pagan royalty. But Old Burmese has not only T'iluiii matn, but also Toittwah mai ('king of Taungdwin-gyi') 7, to prove that once the term was not confined to Pagan. Fan Chco in the 9th century called the proto-Burmans the "Mang tribes... Mang is the name they give their princes"; and he lists a series of 8 different Mang as one went south from Yung-chcangl8. When the Burmans overflowed the kharztin areas, perhaps each lending chief who founded or conquered a new region, would set up his white umbrella and call himself maw.. Perhaps the absorption of these local mail by the Pagan mai-krf ('great or senior king') dates only from Aniruddha. Anyway Kyanzittha, reacting against the autocratic methods of his pre- decessor, took care to promise in his inscriptions that he would "maintain the succession of all the kings of old19." The Chronicles attribute the quarrel between Aniruddha and Kyanzittha to the former's love, affair with Manicanda, daughter of the king of Pegu, whom Kyanzittha, after defeating the Cambojans- was escorting as a gift of gratitude to the Pagan monarch2 There is ample evidence, no doubt, in his inscriptions that Kyanzittha was sensitive to feminine charms: but, as I have argued in Ch. II (supra, p. 22), the Pegu campaign probably occurred early in Aniruddha's reign, not near the end of it; it was followed by several other campaigns in which Kyanzittha was prominent; so it could not have been the cause of the implacable feud that thenceforth divided them. The feud never led to any dis- loyalty on Kyanzittha's side: merely a complete breach. Aniruddha reigned at Pagan. Kyanzittha was probably lord of Kyaukse, always ready to come whenever Saw Lu called him, ready even to risk his life to rescue him. He never mentions Aniruddha in his inscriptions, and passes over in silence all his own exploits as a general previous to the crushing of Nga Raman. I have suggested (supra, p. 4I) that the real cause of the breach may have been the almost inevitable quarrel between Kyaukse and Pagan, between the old equal city-states and the centralized power needed to control a large united kingdom. Kyanzittha, as we shall see, had his own solution of that problem, based on consent rather than on force. What must, I think, have kept their feud within bounds, was their common devotion to the Buddhist religion. HIS VOTIVE TABLETS Kyanzittha has left some few votive tablets21 signed on the obverse with his title, both in Sanskrit (Nagari script) and Pali (Mon script). There is sometimes a short Pali prayer for Buddhahood on the under-rim. All show 50 earth-touching Buddhas, arranged differently from the similar tablets of Aniruddha22. These tablets have been found at Pagan in "the big temple east of the Nagayon" (perhaps he built both), and also in "a ruined stupa east of the Mingalazedi" (not identified). 16 T'iluinh syani.

He always calls himself by his royal title in Sanskrit/Pali: SrT Tribhuvanddityadhammard-J, "Fortunate Buddhist king, Sun of the Three Worlds" (of men, devas and brahmds). This kind of title, first used by him, becomes, with various amplifications, the regal style of most of his successors, both of the Paga'n and later dynasties, Burmese, Mon or Shan. It is widespread also in Further India. Mon 'PROPHETIC INSCRIPTIONS Thanks to the late Dr. Blagden, the Mon inscriptions of Kyanzittha are now easily accessible in English23. Most of them are couched in the form of a fictitious prophecy of the Buddha concerning the coming of Kyanzittha, and descants thereon of laudatory comment on his virtues and his reign. At first sight they seem unpromising material for history, whatever their literary value may be. We may judge the latter by an example. The chief of these 'prophetic' utterances is the great two-pillared inscription at the east entrance of Shwezigon pagoda at Nyaung-uU, and its fragmentaryduplicate found at the palace-site inside the Tharaba gate at Pagan25. It begins with the stock formula that must accompany, in Pali hagiography, a sham prophecy of the Buddha. That done, the style changes, and the king's eulogy, voiced by Gavampati the Buddha's spokesman, begins. The opening paragraph - "His fame shall be known over the world" etc.26 - has been quoted already in Chapter II (p. 42). This is followed by the account of Nga Raman's rebellion - "When raiding enemies come up to destroy Pagan" - quoted in Chapter III (p. 48). The eulogy proceeds27: - "The bar of the gate of heaven, golden and studded with gems, by the hand of holy wisdom shall the king draw it open for mankind... From the seven cities virgin-daughters of princes, bright with all manner of jewels, shaded with white umbrellas, fragrant with the fragrance of jasmine flowers, splendid as AlambitsJ, wife of In - these shall attend him. Upon the lion-throne. . , the king shall sit, and shall enjoy the beauty of sovrainty... In a palace like the Vejayanta palace, fit for delights, the jewelled diadem of the city of Pagan, the brave king, glorified by all, shall enjoy the fulness of sov- rainty... And all the women who dwell in the city of Pagan, shall see his glory and his beauty. They shall stand about at the river-ports, and in the roads and lanes and crossroads: 'Such glory, such beauty' they shall say, 'are because he did works of merit in the past. That is why he gets them.' So shall they praise the king, and go their ways."... Descending to humbler things, without much lowering of style, Gavampati continues28: - "During his reign mushrooms, bamboo shoots, flowers and fruits of trees shall abound. Poor people who find it hard to get rice and clothing, shall wear gold ornaments and fine apparel. Little children who are learning to eat cake with their fingernails, shall behave nicely like their elders. . . Throughout the king's realm, a hundred and twenty times a year the rain shall fall. Always the paddy shall be full in the ear. There shall be plenty of elephants, horses, water-buffaloes, cattle, pigs, goats and fowls. 23 See J.R.A.S. 1909, PP. IOI7-52; I9IO, pp. 799-812. Epig.

Farmers who excel in planting and harrowing, shall fill their barns and granaries with paddy, millet and all manner of grain." And finally Indra approaches Visnu, inviting him to be reborn as king Kyanzittha29: - "In order to fulfil all thy works, my lord, up in heaven am I, King In, who wield the thunderbolt. Down below is the mighty and aweful Ndga king, with coils a thousandfold. In all ten quarters the four Guardians of the World keep watch and ward. The whole company of the four castes, together with the king, stand upon a site which cannot be shaken." These quotations should suffice to prove, if the trap inscription of Makuta30 failed to do so, that in Old Mon we are dealing, not only with a language, but with literature. We do not know enough of Pyu to say if the Pyu language ever rose to the heights. But here, in Mon, the miracle has happened. Burma, though not yet Burmese, has found expression, and the great age, not only of her arts, but also of her literature, has begun. Not even the father of Thai, RMma Gdrhhehfin3, launched his people into letters more magnificently than this. The form is prose, but the matter is pure poetry. It is a great moment in the history of a country when such miracles occur. Hitherto a backward region, dependent on others for its thought and all its culture, a wholesale borrower, a hopeless debtor - suddenly there is a change! Burma has found its soul, its real independence. In the world of art it stands upon its own feet. The artistic impulse started by the Mons, will soon pulsate through Burmese also. ACCESSION AND PARENTAGE But to descend to prose once again - what do these 'prophetic' Mon inscriptions tell ? Are they pure poetry, or are they also history? - There is much history in them; but they require imaginative study. The king, one reads repeatedly in them, ascended the throne of Pagan in the year i628 or i630 after the death of the Buddha32, say I084 or io86 A.D. The former date was probably that of his actual accession, the latter certainly that of his abhiseka or anointing. The Chronicles, Burmese and Mon, generally agree that he was a Burman, possibly half-Arakanese. Looking at his portrait-statue, kneeling in the south niche of the west shrine of Nanda temple at Pagan~3, we need not conclude, as Harvey did34, that he was other than a Burman. Burmans have 29 ibid., Face H, lines 5-1 2. 30 Ch. II, p. 25. 31 See G. Coedes, Recueil des Inscriptions du Siam, Part I, Inscriptions de Sukhodaya (Bangkok I924), I.

And the one thing we know for certain about the ancient Burman, is that he was different from the modern. There are two mentions of his parentage, in Pali and in Mon. In both he says that his father was of the Sun family (ddiccavansa)35, laying claim, it seems, to some form of legitimacy. His mother, he declares in Pali, was "born of the Bael-fruit stock" (velubabbann.auja)36. In the Mon passage, which is fragmentary, she was "of the Egg (kuwbdy?) family, dwelling in the b.i dfini (? womb of the Bamboo).37 The former passage seems to be the basis of the tale in the Chronicles38, how Kyanzittha's mother, princess Paficakalydnf, was daughter of Ruciyapabhdvatf, who had been born out of the fruit of a bael-tree (Aegle marmelos, Sanskrit vilva) at Vesdli in India. Perhaps the Chronicles also confuse her with Velltvatf, a queen of Narapatisithu, who was found in "a forest of the Pyaws (Pro:) in Myinzaing Wek-win, in a giant bamboo, a little daughter born of heat and moisture, having great beauty and the signs great and small39." As for the Egg family, we recall that on the west face of the Shitthaung pillar at Mrohaung in Arakan, Vajragakti, ancestor of the donor inandacandra, belonged to the "family of the Divine Egg (devdaja)40." There may well be confusion here between Vesdli, capital of the Candras in North Arakan, and Vesdi, capital of the Lacchavis in India. Perhaps Kyanzittha is merely hinting at miraculous birth on the mother's side. In any case it was not on Aniruddha's young line of parvenu kings that Kyanzittha based his claim to legitimacy: but on a prophecy of the Buddha, and on his alleged identity with Visnu, the divine founder of the Pyu kingdom of Sri Ksetra, which still, though its site had moved four miles north- eastward to modern Prome, was recognized as PRAR, 'the capital', even by the alien founders of a new capital at Pagan. PROME INSCRIPTION, I093 A.D. In this ancient capital, at Prome Shwe-hsan-daw pagoda, on June 3rd, I093, Kyanzittha "issued an order to write down the full number of his virtues, so that all men might understand4l' He launched, in fact, the earliest version of his legend. He, a Burman, launched it from the Pyu capital, in the Mon language. Visnu, says the Buddha, after founding Sri Ksetra with the help of "my son Gavawhpati" (patron-saint of the Mons), In (Indra, king of the gods), Bissukarmma (Vi~vakarman, the celestial architect), and Katakarmma king of the Nagas, shall be reborn in the families as stated, and in I630 A.B. (io86 A.D.) shall reign in the city of Pokdm (Pagan): where, seated on the lion-throne, he shall receive the royal head-anointing in a pillared paicaprdsada (a main pavilion surrounded by four others), in the presence of his four-fold army and "all the lords Arahan" (i.e. the Buddhist clergy). The eulogy of the king which followed, is now mostly lost. 3B Epig. Birm. I, Part II, Inscr. VI24, VIII B'6. 36 ibid., VIII B16. 37 ibid., VI24. See Blagden's note 9 on p.

Nearly five years later, about April i098, Kyanzittha visited the original home of Burma Buddhism, where the theras Sona and Uttara, Asoka's missionaries, landed and converted the king and people of Suvainabhfimi, some 30 miles north of Thaton. At the foot of Mt. Keldsa he repaired "the cets of Kydk Talai"42 (the present Myatheindan pagoda at Ayetthema). Three miles north of Taungzun he repaired "the prdsdda of the great relic (mahidhdt) of Satihl43" (the present Kyaik Te pagoda south- west of Alugale). Here he left inscriptions, almost duplicates. Two other probable duplicates he left at Thaton itself, one at the top of Myathabeit pagoda hill that overlooks the town, the other two furlongs south of the foot of the hill, north-west of Nyaungwaing monastery". These inscriptions give the second version of his legend, now inflated. Following the style of the ex- king Makuta, Kyanzittha is now "the king of kings, the lord supreme (paramisvar), the mighty universal monarch (balacakkriwar), who makes his vehicle the White Elephant, the omniscient Bodhisatta, who verily shall be a Buddha and save from misery all living creatures5" etc. He follows, in fact, Makuta in setting the example of royal bombast, adopted by most (not all) of the later kings of Burma. Mahdydnist claims are added, and the legend swelled by a short series of private jdtaka, or previous births in India46, befitting his dignity as a future Buddha. He was first a pious millionaire in Benares; then a victorious king in Pdtaliputta; then a victorious son of king Rdm at Ayudhyapfir (Oudh); and finally, as in the original legend, the hermit Bisnft (Visnu) "on the silver mountain of Kelhsa." As before, his founding of Srf Kset, and his rebirth and anointing by Indra as king of Pagan in i630 A.D. (io86 A.D.), are prophesied by the Buddha, together with a short eulogy. The anointing will take place "in a pancaprdsdt adorned with 28 arch-pediments (ski' clac dheiz), on a jewelled lion-throne inlaid with stone of purple hue (tmo' sdk sriM)47." PAGAN MRAKAN AND ALAMPAGAN INSCRIPTIONS The same inflated version of the legend recurs in two undated inscriptions set up, perhaps earlier, near Pagan48, on the banks of two reservoirs dug or dammed by the king: the one called in Old (and Modern) Burmese Mrakan, 'Emerald Lake,' at the west foot of Turahtoil, 'the Arch Mountain'; the other at Alampagan, between that hill and Minnanthu. In the inscriptions both reservoirs are given Buddhist names beginning with Mahanirbban, 'Great Nirvana', the rest of the latter's name may possibly read Alabagdlik49; the former's name is given in Old Burmese - Lak cltuy khi riy, "water 42 Epig.

Kyanzittha's love of birds is evidenced elsewhere. MRAKAN LIBRARY Nearby, till recent times, when villagers and government departments have been allowed to quarry it, stood a stone lodge or library52, lonely, plain and beautiful, doubtless built at the same time by king Kyanzittha. We shall consider later the purpose of this unique building - the only pure stone monu- ment in Paga'n, perhaps in Burma. Both Mrakan lake and library are wrongly attributed in the Chronicles to a later king, Klacwd53. SHWEZIGON PILLARS Undated, but doubtless the final version of the legend, is that found on the two four-faced pillars near the east entrance of ShwezigonM4, Nyaung-u, and the duplicate set up at Kyanzittha's new palace near the Tharaba Gate55, within the walls of Paga'n. The former is still in situt, proving that the Shwezigon was the work, not of Aniruddha, but of Kyanzittha. The latter, clear but fragmentary, is now at Pagain Museum. Long extracts from this final version have been quoted already. The private ]atakas are now dropped, and the Buddha's actual prophecy somewhat shortened; but "his son Gavathpati" is told to go and explain it to Indra. This he does briefly then and there; but later, after the Buddha's parinirvdna, "in full detail." This section forms the core of the inscription (4 out of its 8 faces)56, giving under the guise of prophecy an idealized autobiography, perhaps in chronological order; but nothing is said of the king's life till just before his accession (IO84 A.D.). MAHATHERA ARAHAN This section begins, as we have seen, with an obvious reference to the king's heroic defeat of Nga Raman. It is next said that he will "make his right hand man" a virtuous mahdthera57. This prelate was doubtless the great Arahan, whose portrait-statue, opposite that of Kyanzittha, kneels in the north niche of the west shrine of Nanda temple58. The term Arahan, "Saint", was sometimes used in a general sense for members of the Buddhist Order59, but in several passages of Kyanzittha's palace- 50 ibid. Inscr.

The date of that inscription is probably 102. One is free to ask if he can be the same as the 'Shin Arahan' of the Chronicles61, alleged to have come from Thaton to Pagan half a century earlier. EMBASSY TO K'AI-FPiNG, iio6 A.D. We then read of another invasion and another victory: - "And when he reigns, if another mighty army should chance to come, the omen of victory, a happy Star, shall come before him. In time of battle the king shall ride upon a noble horse, swift as are the horses of the breed of the clouds. He shall fight, yea, he shall shine as the noonday sun62"... One is left wondering who the invader was. Most probably the old Nan-chao, "Ta-li kingdom". The lateish Burmese Hledauk inscription, Taungbyon63, mentions an invasion of Mandalay district from the side of China at the end of his reign; the victorious general is there stated to have been his grandson and heir, the Donor of Shwegu. The Hledauk date is 473 S./IIII A.D. In Chinese sources64 we read that in March-April iio6 the king had sent an embassy to the Sung court at K'ai-feng, and scored a small diplomatic success there: - "In the 5th year of ch'wng-ning (ii06 A.D.), P'u-kan [Pagan] sent envoys to submit tribute. The Emperor ordered that they be treated with the same rank and ceremony as Chu-nien [the Colas of South India]. But the Grand Council observed: 'Chu-nien is subject to the San-fo-ch'i foreigners [srl Vijaya, Palembang]. During the hsi-ning period [i068-77 A.D.] imperial decrees were addressed to it on thick-backed paper, and enclosed in box and wrapper. Now P'u-kan is king of a big kingdom. We cannot look down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire to follow the same ritual as in the case of the Ta-shik [Arabs], Chiao-chih [Annam], and other kingdoms, to whom imperial appointments and decrees are all written on white-backed, gold-flowered, damask paper, and stored in a partly gold-gilt tube with key, and forwarded in a brocade silk double wrapper as sealing envelope'.- The Emperor approved." What was the object of the embassy.? - Perhaps Nan-chao, jealous of Aniruddha's success in Upper Burma, was planning a counter-raid on the plains of Burma after his death - to sack the Burmese capital as it had sacked the Pyu in 832 A.D.; and so Kyanzittha, to win allies in its rear, sent this embassy (probably by sea) to K'ai-feng in iio6. The Sung, however, under their artist-emperor Hui Tsung, must have been too busy with their northern invaders to give any help in the south. Fortunately Kyanzittha and his young heir were strong enough to deal single-handed with Nan-chao, though its army reached as far south as Mandalay district. 60 mahathlerArahan. Epig. Birm.

We have already quoted the passage about the king's palace67, the building of which, in IIOI-2, is recorded in the longest of the king's inscriptions. He will strengthen, we read, the defences of Paga'n, and labour to repair the damage done by war, re- storing fugitive monks to their monasteries68. Colonel Ba Shin, an experienced soldier, suggests to me that Kyanzittha's first act after his accession, may well have been to repair the walls damaged in the long siege, and rebuild the Tharaba Gate69. The old walls of Pagan may date from the city's founding, c. 850 A.D.: but the main Gate, with its almost-temple mouldings, is clearly later. The Gate, moreover, resembles in style the enclosure-gateways of Nagayon70, the king's first temple (c. I090 A.D. ?) - with its vaulted middle section, buttressed at each end with high vertical masses, crossed (probably) by wooden lintels. Kyanzittha, we read, shall maintain a standing army of the bravest men, "more than one thousand in number", for service both at home and abroad.71. Contrast the army attributed to Aniruddha in the Chronicles72 - i8o million men - nine times the present total population of Burma. Heretics, the inscription concludes, shall become orthodox. Brahmans learned in the Vedas shall practise Brahmanism. Scholars shall ponder deep the eternal verities. Monks and scholars shall be the two eyes of the king. In his final existence he shall become a Buddha, saviour of the worlds of gods and men. - Indra receives his orders, and promises every support. Gavampati goes on to visit Visnu and repeat in short the prophecy; and so, in turn, does Indra. Visnu accepts their message with enthusiasm; and the inscription concludes with the identification of Visnu with the reigning king, Kyanzittha. LATER PROME INSCRIPTIONS Two of the king's Mon inscriptions remain. The one on the large two-faced slab at Prome Shwe- hsan-daw pagoda (Inscr. VIII)73 begins in the middle of a sentence. Unless we assume the total disappearance of another large slab, its fellow, that slab should either be Inscr. VI74 or Inscr. VJI75. 65 Inscr. I, Face C, lines 29-3I. 66 Duroiselle (A.S.I. I9I3-I4, pp. 64-65) gives I090 A.D. as the date of the completion of the Nanda. I think this is much too early. The Mon inscription cited by Duroiselle, which was later edited by Blagden in Vol. III, Part I, of Epig. Birm., records the building of the palace (II02 A.D.), not of the Nanda. Kyanzittha's early masterpiece, the Nagay6n, may well be dated c. i090; the Nanda was his final achievement. On general grounds I should date it c. II05 A.D. 67 Inscr.

Hmannan (Susodhita ed.), I, p. 272 (transl., G.P.C., p. 95). The desire to exaggerate is human; but it is not particularly characteristic of Old Mon, nor of Chinese, nor greatly of Old Burmese. Here it seems to start with Cafisfi II's Dhammarajaka inscription (I.B., PI. I, i9, lines IO-II, 558 s./ii96 A.D.), where the royal armies are totalled at 60,000; but the appetite grows, perhaps under Indian example. 73 Epig. Birm.

Colonel Ba Shin points out that its letters are much larger, and its pointed top and general shape, both height, breadth and thickness, are quite different from the others76. Inscription VII has now a broken flattish top, but may originally have had a broad flat arch, like Inscription VIII. Their workmanship, including lettering and border- lines, are almost exactly alike. Inscription VII has a very rough verso, not engraved: this is the chief objection - not, I think, a fatal one - to accepting VII as the first face of VIII. So far as it is legible, VII appears to duplicate VI up to the end of VI, but it had more (see Blagden's readings on p. I53). At line 29 of VII, it seems, the Buddha's prophecy ends; and there are 8 lines more to conclude the face. Inscription VI apparently belongs to the earlier part of the reign. Perhaps it contained nothing but the Buddha's prophecy. Inscription VIII, near the end of the Reverse, alludes to the prophecy, but most of what remains is in the past or present tense, recording actual happenings during the reign, each paragraph ending: - "In that respect, too, no other king is like him." It belongs presumably to the latter part of the reign. - I suggest that Kyanzittha in his old age re- turned to Prome to reinforce the truth of the Buddha's prophecy; that he began (on VII) by repeating it verbatim; followed it up (on VIII A) by citing his own gests as a Buddhist king; and concludes (on VIII B) with a short Pali eulogy on himself, and a final claim, in Mon, to have been the original founder of the Pyu kingdom of Old Prome, as well as the consolidator of the Mon-Burmese kingdom of Pagan. JAYABHUMI CETIYA If so, the earliest gests are now lost, at the flaked base of inscription VII. At the top of VIII A there is mention of a work of merit, Nirbbdnamiilabajra - and perhaps ending - Paryamahdacet77, "the great cetiya, Circle of Adamant ,Nirvdna's root." It was built by the king "on the site namedJaya- blsimi, north-east of the city of Pagan." Note the recurrence of the word Nirbbdna at the head of this name, as also in the king's names for the two lakes he dammed. The word may be called the hallmark of Theravdda Buddhism in contrast to Mahdydnism. It shows which way Kyanzittha's mind was turning at this time - the climacteric in Burma's religious history. The work of merit is certainly the Shwezigon, Burma's most 'national' pagoda, where the king's two-pillared inscription (No. I) still commands the entrance. The Chronicles78 say the pagoda was begun in I059-60 A.D. by Aniruddha, who built the three terraces, and that it was merely completed by Kyanzittha. This seems improbable. Aniruddha may conceivably have chosen the site. But the three terraces are not like those of the Shwe-hsan-daw; the Jdtaka-numbering differs from that of Hpetleik; and there is no mention of Aniruddha on the pillars. Within little more than a century, the name Jayabhlimi, "Land of Victory" 76Colonel Ba Shin's measurements are as follows: - Inscription VI, i face; height ioij inches; breadth 38 inches (at base 36j inches); thickness i8 inches. Inscription VII, i face; height 75 inches; breadth 54 inches; thickness io inches (at base 9 inches). Inscription VIII, 2 faces; height 62 inches; breadth 531 inches); thickness 8 inches. 77 Blagden ends the name (-mahawihar), but admits in a footnote (p. I56, n. 2) that wihar, "monastery", is "entirely conjectural." - I should substitute ceti. 78 U Kala, I, pp. i90-I, 2i6-7.

The actual date of building was probably about io86 A.D. REVISION OF THE TIPITAKA (ABtYADANA AND NAGAYON TEMPLES) Kyanzittha's next care (VIII A3) was to "collect and purify the Tipitaka, which had become ob- scured and corrupt." Evidence is accumulating which not only confirms the fact that Kyanzittha, early in his reign, instituted a large-scale study and revision of the Tipitaka, but also that this new recension, based on orthodox Singhalese Mahdvihdra models, led Burma out of the East Bengal Tantric Mahdydnism of Aniruddha's youth, and lodged it finally in the Theravdda fold. More lasting than his youthful vic- tories, this was Kyanzittha's main contribution to his country's history. The transition was not easy. Pagaln's natural contacts from the first were overland with North India. Her Buddhist iconography, sculpture, votive tablets, bronzes, paintings, are all North Indian in origin, based on Gandhdran, Mathuran, and Pala Bengal models. Her architecture, where it is not independent, links her to East Bengal and (perhaps) Orissa. Kyanzittha's chief queen, Abeyadana, if not of East Bengal extraction (as I suspect), was deeply committed, as her temple proves, to Thntric Mahdydnism. Nor was it a simple choice, as Burmese Chronicles like to assume, between false doctrine and the Truth, between corrupt and scandalous living and Morality. Their version of 'Ari' practices in Aniruddha's time80 has no inscriptional basis to support it. Many pious and venerated monks came, and still come, from "jungle monasteries." The Buddhist way of life, so beautifully portrayed in the Abeyadana corridors, is not Theravddin, but it is deep and noble; and its Ascent to Buddhahood breathes the same idealism as Java's Barabudur or the Talang Tuwo inscription of 8ri Vijaya81. Pandit Atisa, Thntric Mahayanist, is no less famous than Shin Arahan as a reformer of Buddhism. INFLUENCE OF CEYLON The move Ceylonward from Bengal was started, almost by accident it seems, by Aniruddha's demand for primary Buddhist texts. They were not obtainable, it seems, in East Bengal or Arakan. From his capture of Thaton he got little except texts of the Jdtaka Commentary82. These were not of Singhalese origin, but possibly South Indian. They contained 550 stories, not 547; and the numbering differed from 497 onwards. Here we can check, and date, the Kyanzittha revision. The earliest pagodas 79 At the base of the north pillar, two short later inscriptions are engraved. The upper one (of 4 lines, undated) is in Old Mon (see Epig. Birm. III, Part I, Inscription X, pp. 68-70), and records a dedication of land by Kyanzittha's grandson and successor, Cafisfi I. Here the pagoda is still called Jeyabhuzis. Below it, on the north face, is an Old Burmese inscription of 5 lines (I.B., P1. II 176 b), dated 6ii or 6I7 S./1250 or I256 A.D., recording a dedication of slaves to Caiikhxum phurka. A misreading of -bhumi as -gumi would account for the change, for the letters bh and g are often indistinguishable, and the sound -gmy, in the latter part of a dissyllable, would naturally be written -khun. Cai, of course, is the regular transcription of Jaya. 80 U Kala, I, pp. I73-4. Hmannan (Susodhita ed.), I, pp. 240-I (transl. G.P.C., pp. 70-7I). 81 See BEFEO, t. XXX, I930, pp. 29ff.

IIL p. 40 supra, and notes i87, i88.</page><page sequence="80">62 Chapter IV of Paga'n (East and West Hpetleik) follow the old recension. Kyanzittha, at the beginning of his reign, was of two minds: the Jdtaka-numbering on the Shwezigon is a muddle of several recensions; and the older numbering of the Mahdnipcdta persists, both here and in the Abeyadana; but from Nanda temple (C. II05 A.D.) onwards to the present day, the numbering, and nearly all the naming, are Singhalese. One can see the transition also in the temple-painting and sculptures. The earliest temples (e.g. the Nanpaya) have no Buddhisptaintings; the sculpture tends to be Brahmanic. The two Hpetleik, Myin- pyagu and Taungbi Mon temples have little but illustrations of Jdtakas. Scenes from the Buddha's life (e.g. in the Kyaukku Onhmin83) extend little beyond the Eight Scenes. The endless lines of Buddhas seated in dhydna, preaching or earth-touching attitudes, have nothing to distinguish them. The great change comes with the Pahtothamya, which U Mya, in just defiance of the Chronicles, seems willing to attribute to Saw Lu84. The date should be c. io8o A.D. Here we have no Jdtakas, but over 6o scenes from the life of the Buddha, boldly painted; rule after rule of the Vinaya, sutta after sutta of the Dfgha and Majjhima Nikaya, each with a written gloss to identify it, all with names and details following the Singhalese Canon. The process grows and extends, both in painting and sculpture, throughout Kyanzittha's reign, and reaches its climax in the year after his death, say III3 A.D., in the Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi temple of his son Rajakumar85. R jakumdr's aim, it appears, was to depict on its walls the whole history of the world as known to the Buddhists, and told in the Singhalese Canon, followed by the Dfpavauhsa, Mahavamsa, and Culavaisa, right down to his own day. REBUILDING OF SRI BAJRAS (BODHGAYX) "Thereafter" our inscription continues (VIII A4-7), "for the Holy One of Sri Bajrds pitruk blait (?), which had been irremediably destroyed by another king", Kyanzittha "got together all sorts of precious things, and sent a ship with the intent to (re)build the Holy Sri Bajrcs: to buy (land?), dig a reservoir, make irrigated ricefields, make dams, cause candles and lamps to be lit which should never be quenched; and give drums, frog-drums, stringed and percussion instruments, and singing and dancing better than ever before. - In that, too, no other king is like him." Sri Bajrcs is the Vajrysana temple of Bodhgayd in India, the "Seat of Adamant" where the Buddha attained Buddhahood. The three following syllables are not certain, and their meaning is obscure. What king had destroyed the Mahabodhi temple? And when? - Ghaznavid Muslims had sacked Benares in I033-4 A.D. I do not know if any of them reached Bodhgayd. Or was it the Chedi prince Karntadeva, who invaded the Buddhist Pdla kingdom of Bihar (Magadha) in I039 ? - That Kyanzittha repaired the Bodhgayd temple, as stated, there is no doubt whatever. For a proof of it, one need only turn to Plate 52-B of Benjamin Rowland's Art and Architecture of India, "Vaults of Mahd- bodhi temple before restoration86." This has all the marks of early Pagan architecture: pointed arches (main arch and relieving arch) with bricks of the voussoir flat against the arch-face; the remains of what was once an elaborate toranaa enclosing the entrance; fine brick masonry with vertical and hori- zontal courses alternating; and the regular absence of integration between the Hall or man1apa (on the right of the print), and the temple proper with its elaborate main entrance. 83 Pls. 14I, 142. 84 See A.S.I.

See our P1. i90 c, d.</page><page sequence="81">Chapter IV 63 The inscription continues (VIII A7-8): - "Thereafter, the great monuments (mahdvatthu) built by king Dharma'sok, which were old and in ruin, the king repaired and made them finer than before." - These might, of course, be also in India; but I expect the reference is to "the cets of Kyak Talan" and "the prdsdda of the great relic of Satih", near Mr. Kelasa north of Thaton, which Kyanzittha had repaired in io98 A.D.87 If so, his Bodhgayd mission took place shortly before that date; and the case for identifying the Suvsannabhfimi of the Ceylon Chronicles with the Mt. Keldsa region north of Thaton, is appreciably strengthened. Dharmadsok, of course, is the emperor AMoka, who sent his missionaries there in 253 B.C. (?), after the 3rd Buddhist Council of Pataliputta. ALLIANCE WITH COLAS A little further on (VIII A10-17), we read: - "At that time the king heard that a Colf prince had come to Pagan. So the king bethought him that apart from the Three Gems, there is naught else that can give great happiness in this world or the worlds beyond, (or bring) Nirvana to all beings: the Three Gems alone can give it. So the king wrote of the grace of the Buddha Gem, the Dharrmma Gem, the Saigha Gem on leaves of gold with vermilion ink, and sent and gave them to the Colf prince. The Col prince together with his followers... cast off adhesion to false doctrine and adhered simply to true doctrine. . . " And he showed his gratitude by presenting to Kyanzittha "a virgin daughter of his, full of beauty", together with a wish-fulfilling tree (kalpabriksa88) and other presents. Col/, one assumes, means Cola. Kyanzittha, reacting perhaps against Aniruddha's partiality for the Singhalese, though not against their religion, allied himself with the Cola bloc. A Chinese text, the Ling-zvai-tai ta of Chou Chcii-fei (II78 A.D.), confirms this intercourse between the Colas and Pagan. In its section on Chu-nien (- Cola) kingdom89, it says' - "Chu-nien kingdom is South India in the west. If one wants to go to this kingdom, one should transship from KU-oin kingdom90 (Quilon). Some say one can also go there from P'u-kan kingdom (Pagan)." The Burmese name for the Tamil peoples of South India, including the Colas, is 'Kyi-kala' (written kyan:, Old Burm. klan-). Burmese Chronicles mention them briefly near the beginning of Kyanzittha's reign9l: - "At the time of his anointing [io86 A.D.], the king's generals brought him Kyi-kala prisoners of war, saying 'We have conquered the Kala [Indian] country with Thandaung ["Iron mountain"] and Nga thon-pinle, ["Sea of Na Sui" ?]. And he made the Kalas live in quarters at Singu." Had Aniruddha, one wonders, given a token force or bodyguard of Burma troops to his old friend Vijayabdhu I ? - Prof. Nilakanta Sastri says92: "About io84-5 Vijayabdhu of Ceylon declared war on the Colas when he heard that the envoys he had sent to Vikramaditya VI [the Chalukyan king] had been mutilated. While he was preparing the expedition, the v-elaikkdra mercenaries, 'unwilling to fight their Tamil kinsmen, mutinied, and burnt the royal palace. The king fled to Wakirigala, but returning crushed the insurrection, the ringleaders being burnt at the funeral pyre of the royal generals whom they murdered.

MASS RELIGIOUS ENTHUSIASM Kyanzittha's inscription continues with a list of tribute-offerings paid monthly to the king "by people of the towns, the country and the jungle, each according to his means" - golden umbrellas, canopies, fans, couches, cushions, sandals, greaves; models of date-palms (sindi)95, iron-wood trees (kajnu)96, lions, wish-fulfilling trees,... pavilions; figures of elephants, of men, of devas and clan- spirits (kindok); lights for altars, golden flowers by the thousand, flower-umbrellas and cloth unbrellas by the hundred. "On such occasions the full-grown male elephants would pick up... flowers and come dancing and make their offerings to the king. The horses would dance. And the people, in the guise of all manner of creatures, clan-spirits and devas, would act as spirit-mediums (doA)97... and enter singing and dancing and make their offerings to the king. After the manner of singing and dancing of all the towns, countries, villages and junglefolk... they would come singing and dancing every time, and make their offerings to the king98." Mass-enthusiasm was thus exploited by Kyanzittha as a means, not only to serve religion and morality, but also to ease his subjects when they paid their taxes. They would bring him living creatures by the thousand, and he would pour holy water and release them. "By the power of lovingkindness... all the birds on the high roads, in the lanes, and at the palace, would not flee. They would lodge in cages. They would come and perch on the roofs,. . . and the king would stroke them with his hand. . . and call them 'Birds of the Dhamma' "99 - It is a pity that so much of the final face of this inscription is fragmentary. NEW PALACE INSCRIPTION, II02 A.D. Finally, there is the long Palace inscription'00, pillars and fragments of which, now at Pagan Museum, were originally found near the Tharaba Gate, on the south side of the road within the Gate, 93 G.

On the importance of the Tamil inscription, see supra, Ch. II, n. i85. 95 U Wun informs me that "Pali sindi and khajjyfi appear in the AbhidhanappadfPikh, verse 603. In the old Nissaya (iio8 B.E.) by Kyaw-aung-san-hta Sayadaw the words are identified with Burmese saipoi:, Phoenix paludosa. In the new Nissaya (I287 B.E.) by Ashin Aggadhammabhivaihsa they are rendered as cwanpalwai:, Phoenix dactylifera, the Date-Palm." Sir George Watt (The Commercial Products of India, i908, p. 882) gives both 'khajur' and 'sindhi' as names for the Date-palm. The latter name, he says, "denotes its origin from Sind." 96 Old Mon kajnu becomes in Old Burmese kamiikaw sanuiw, Mod. Burm. kam'hko6, Pali naga, Sanskrit nagakesara. It is dear to Buddhists as the Bodhi tree of 4 of the 28 Buddhas: Mafigala, Sumana, Revata and Sobhita, and also as bearing the distinctive flower of the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The botanical name is Mesua ferrea. 97 The same word (40ng) is still used for spirit-mediums in Vietnam. See Maurice Durand, Technique et Panthdon des Midiums Vie'tnamiens (Paris, I959). In Mod.

Dr. Blagden, in editing this difficult inscription for Epigraphia Birmanica, was given inadequate information and inaccurate measure- ments of the stones: with the result that his order of the faces is confused. Please see my "Note on the order of faces of the Palace-Inscription" at the end of this chapter. In the text I ignore Blagden's order of faces, and follow my own.</page><page sequence="83">Chapter IV 65 where the palace-site is still remembered. It was engraved on four tall four-sided pillars. It began, it seems, with a short section, now unfortunately fragmentary, on the actual architecture, and continued with a long account of the numerous ceremonies. The exact date and time of each event are noted, but the extant portions contain no year-date. The late Sir Robert Sewell101, however, calculated that "within the period covered by Kyanzittha's reign ,the end of the year IIOI A.D. and the early part of II02 best fit the particulars given."1102 The palace was doubtless made of wood: nothing but the site remains. Fires at Paga'n were not infrequent. Another palace (Old Burm. Tm taw, "royal house"), we read103, was built just a century later, in I204-5 A.D.; and again in I225 we hear of a great fire when "the whole capital was burnt104." Kyanzittha's palace is called in the inscription rdjasthdn Pikdm105, "Palace of Paga'n." A frag- mentary passage mentions rdjasthdn Jeyabhifm106, "Palace of the Land of Victory." The name might be applied to any auspicious site: but elsewhere (Inscription VIII A2) Kyanzittha applies it to the Shwezigon. Perhaps we may assume that while the Pagan palace was in building, the king lived in a temporary palace three miles distant, near the Shwezigon, his work of merit. His abhiseka building of io86 A.D. is described in his other inscriptionsl7 as a paftcaprdsdda, "fivefold pavilion"; and his new palace was also clearly built on the paicaprdsdda basis, namely, a " Great Pavilion" (prasst jnok) doubt- less in the centre, and four "minor pavilions" (prdsdt cindrow) set about it, very likely at the corners. If so, the quincuncial arrangement would show that Old Mon architecture in Burma - all Kyanzittha's temples were of 'Mon' type - bore some resemblance in plan to Old Khmer108. The inscription is too fragmentary to let one speak with much assurance: but one may suggest that the palace stood in a four-sided court (Old Mon cmeA ?)109, with gateways (muk)110 in the centre of each side, perhaps con- nected by an ambulatory or covered cloister (trin jiA mtk)111, which ran round the four sides. The terms for East and West offer no difficulty, either in Mon or Burmese. Those for North and South as used in Mon, and that for North in Burmese, are mysterious. In this inscription one term is cin kinta112, literally "elephant in front", which Blagden translates "the front gable-end", and takes to 101 Joint-author of The Indian Calendar (London, i896) and author of Indian Chronography (London, 19I2), etc. 102 Epig.

The inscription was found in a field half a mile west of Kyaukhpu village, about 2 miles west of Meiktila. PraR, "capital." should refer to Pagaln; but I am not sure whether here it does not mean Meiktila. 105 Epig. Birm. III, Part I, Inscription IX, Face G19. At Inscription I, Face C40, it is called simply prasad; at Inscription VIII B3 rajasthkn. Inscription IX F2 sii rajasthan. 106 Epig. Birm. III, Part I, Inscription IX, Face F44. If this was a temporary palace near the Shw~zig6n, could it have been the 'Kyanzittha Onhmin' of today? 107 Inscription III, Face C11; V35; VI27; etc. Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary defines pancaprysdda as "a temple with four pinnacles and steeple." This would apply to Old Mon temples as a whole; but the four prasat cindrow of Kyanzittha's palace appear to have been distinct from the prasdt jnok. 108 See e.g., Henri Marchal, L'Architecture comparefe dans lInde et l'Extreme-Orient (Paris, 1944), p. 156, fig. 107 "Plan de Pre Rup (Angkor)," and p. i6i, fig. 112 "Plan de la terrasse superieure de Takeo (Angkor)", and the author's comment on the quincuncial plan on p. 227 (480); on p. 23i, however, he says that this plan, "frequent in Camboja, sporadic and rather rare in India, is "tout a fait inconnue en Birmanie, au Champa et a Java."- From the Pagan period onwards, it has been the normal arrangement of the Burma pagoda: - central Stupa, with four corner-stupas. 109 cmei.

The Modern Mon for South is su*l1ui kyd, literally "above the wind"; and for North smaw kyd, "below the wind." The Old Burmese for North, miac ok (often contracted into miok), literally "below the river," is obviously coined on the same analogy; and points to the view that "above the river" in Old Mon meant the opposite, that is South, the equivalent of Modern Mon "above the wind." As for "elephant in front," it recalls the fact that the Roof-ridge is called in Mon "the elephant of the house". Citing the i8th-century Mon poem, Lokasiddhi, by the Monk of Aswo', Halliday notes that according to Mon custom (not always observed), "the front of the house would be towards the north114. - All this confirms Blagden's statements, and shows that Kyanzittha's palace, conforming to the Mon rule, had its gable-frontage facing north, towards the main road and the river. The central feature of the palace was doubtless the throne-room (sifighsin). It seems to have occu- pied the east side of the Great Pavilion, the west side being the Great Audience Hall (dirlac ciryMk)11L5. Throne-room and Audience-hall had each a porch (muk), perhaps to east and west respectively16. The four minor pavilions had no porches. An important building in the enclosure was the juA dal'17, "Foot of the Mountain", possibly the living quarters or antechambers at the foot of the "Golden Mountain" (Old Burm. rhity ton), i.e. the Throne. The jui dal had its own hall (dirlec), porch (muk), and doors. There was also the prdsct birlup118, "Ablution Pavilion", for ceremonial washing, without a porch, it seems. There were stairways (sopdn)'19 resting on posts, probably from ground to floor-level, since there is no suggestion of an upper storey. All these buildings rested on Posts kjini-ju). The main ceremonial interest centres on these, especially the posts of the throne-room and audience-hall. The posts on the two sides were distinguished as male and female'20; the central ones as "posts of fame" (jinijuin yas) and "posts of renown" (jinjJUi atas). There were also "posts of renown" at the corners121. The chief decorative feature was clearly the Archways (torin from Sanskrit torana), especially their Arch-pediments (clec or clac)122, which probably framed all the doors and windows. They appear to have fascinated Kyanzittha. His abhiseka pavilion had no less than 28 ski' clac dneA123. Perhaps it was a four-sided pavilion, with a central door on each side and three windows to left and right of it. Al- ternatively, there may have been (as in the brick monasteries) two doors near the corners of each face, with five windows between them. All were faced with arch-pediments. Here is part of the description of one in the palace: - 113 suimun Ibir. Face B4, and p. 8, n. 3; p. 39, n. 2. 114 R. Halliday, The Talaings (Rangoon, 1917), p. 27. 115 Inscription IX, Face H42. The diriac cirmuk appears to be the same as dirlec jnok (A28) and cirmuk (B25). Dirlac also occurs at S9, 11. Note that Old Mon dirlac or dirlec, "hall", passed into Old Burm. tuluik (I.B., P1.

On both sides, above the capitals of the arch-posts, there were two golden figures of devas in the act of blessing, with golden flowers and garlands within the arch, and pearl pendents and gold plantain-leaves. At every apex of the arch there was a gold stalk as a finial, and a... of gold with gold tracery (?). On each side stood a golden leogryph (byal) 25. Above each leogryph there was a golden Capricorn (mhlkar)126. Above each capricorn there was a golden duck (bip)127 holding stalk and leaf, all made of shining gold. Above the trunks of each of the capricorns there was golden scrollwork with a ruby pinnacle, and in the middle a great lotus- flower. .".128 Other decorative features of the throne-room and audience-hall were figures of dancers, drummers, etc.; lions between lionesses at the corners; jambs of arches framed with heads of elephants, and thereon leogryphs, and thereon capricorns, and thereon lotuses with bulb and flower and fruit, and thereon golden ducks with pearls pendent. Some, at least, of the figures were sheathed in glaze. Glazing - an art which in Burma goes back at least to the Pyu capital of 800 A.D.129, became very popular again from Kyanzittha's reign onwards. CEREMONIES The ceremonies began with bathing of the sites where the buildings were to go up, and frequent bathing of the various posts. The posts were put ready at their respective sites, also the arch-pediments of each side of the main building. Then (Face B42) there was singing in Burmese (mirmna)30, Mon 124 Kyek 0I occurs again at Face P9. The goddess gri (Laksm!) occupies the same central position on the top architrave of the south (the oldest) torana of Saiic! Great Stupa (see J. Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, pp. 50 and 44, n. i). In Old Mon she becomes the symbol of splendour and good fortune. The word passes into Old Burm. kyaksariy (often misspelt kraksare today). 125 byal. Sanskrit vydla, lion rampant, leogryph. 126 mhdkar. Misspelling for makar, Sanskrit/Pali makara. As a sign of the Zodiac, it corresponds to Capricornus, the "horned goat." The horns are hardly seen in Burma, but are clear on the makara stair-ramps at Polonnaruwa, Ceylon. Elephant-head, vydla and makara superposed are common in the reredos of Buddhist images of the Gupta period, and also at Pyu gr! Ksetra. 127 bip. The wild duck or goose; roughly corresponding to Sanskrit/Pali hafisa. The bird was a favourite of Kyanzittha, who, in his statuary, usually makes a pair of them perch behind the shoulders of his Buddhas. 128 Face R4-15. For details of the architecture, see especially the fragmentary faces S, N and R. 129 All the Chinese texts about the Pyu of this date mention their glazed bricks, tiles of lead and tin, and trade with neighbouring tribes in "glazed ware and earthenware jars" (J.B.R.S. Vol. XXVII, Part III, I937, pp. 250-I). The Man-shu (transl. p. go) says their city-wall (probably Halin), one day-stage in perimeter, was made of "green bricks". - In our inscription (Face S2, 14), what Blagden literally translates "clec of mirrors", I take to be the glazed sheathing of the finials of pediments, which one can still see on some Pagan temples. 130 Mirmd is the Old Mon form of Old Burmese Mranmd. The latter first occurs at I.B., PI. I I020 (552 S./II90 A.D.). The corresponding Chinese name, Mien (omitting the final syllable), seems to occur first in the dynastic history of the Mongols (Yiian-shih, ch. 2IO, Section on Mien). Mr. Michael Blackmore points out to me a much earlier use of the same character under date 432 A.D., in the inscription of Tscuan Lung-yen dated 458 A.D. at Lu-hiang chou, east of YUnnan Fu. This inscription, edited by Chavannes - "Four Inscriptions of YUnnan (Mission of Commandant d'Ollone)", Journal Asiatique, July-Aug. i909, ioth Series, Vol. XIV, p. 37 -, states that in 432 the territory of Ning-chou in south-east Ydnnan was ravaged on its eastern and western borders(?) by the soldiers of Mien. Chavan- nes adds in a note that "the name Mien denotes Burma. Our inscription appears to be the most ancient text in which it figures." - There is no other evidence, I think, to suggest that the ancestors of the Burmans were ever in south-east Yiinnan. And in view of the enormous gap in time between this and the next known mention of Mien, I imagine that the reference here is to quite a different tribe with a similar name. - In our inscription Mirmd occurs again at Faces D24 and H12. 5*</page><page sequence="86">68 Chapter IV (rmeni), 131 Pyu (tirCUl)132 and Man (... ?).132a. It is the first mention in history of the word 'Burmese', and in Burma of the word 'Mon'. On Feb. 23rd and 24th II02 A.D.133 "Brahmans (b'mnah) and astro- logers (hera), persons versed in house-building" are frequently mentioned13"; "Burmans versed in house-building, and Mons versed in housebuilding." "Saikrtin Brahmans"'35 were prominent; these were doubtless responsible for the Pagan calendar, calculating the passage (Sanskrit sahkranti) of the Sun into Aries, i.e. the vernal equinox or solar New Year. Once there is mention of buthnah daksan136, perhaps "southerners" from the Deccan. All were clearly Vaisnava, for they always began proceedings by worshipping Ndr, i.e. Ndrdyana, Visnu. Their role consisted mainly in recitation of prayers and lustration, bathing posts or sprinkling holy water. "Burmans in charge of the works"137, and once I26 Mons138, were called in to carry the less precious pots. The rites took place at any auspicious hour of day or night. Besides the Brahmans, government officials were prominent, showing that these were no uncouth foreign rites. There were sumbei (or sambei) gry and lei, "thambyin great and small". Note that gry "great" and leit "small" are almost the only Burmese words admitted into Old Mon. The "thambyin" included the chief ministers: Pra]Pu-[aftkdr, Jeysabhafi, Kaisas fr, Ra-Jasftr (or Ra-irsftr), Ripumad- dano, Mhasakti and A... bhirac139- all with Indian titles. There were also various kalan with non-Indian names: kalan siy, kalan kent, kalan sa140, here clearly junior in rank to the 'thambyin'. There were yai sait41, probably the important village worthies called in Old Burmese sai kry and sai 131 Rmeii. The name occurs again at Faces G23 and H12.-eii in Old Mon often interchanges with - dii, so it is easy to imagine an alternative form *rmdji, from which the Pali Rdmaniiiadesa is derived. The initial r- gets lost; and the modern spelling is man, pronounced mrn. Spelt Ramaii, the word first appears in a slave-name in the 7th century Khmer inscription of Snay Pol (see G. Coedes, Inscriptions du Cambodge, Vol. II, p. 52, Face A25). Spelt Roman, it recurs in the pre-Angkor inscription of Phnorh H6 Phnou (ibid. Vol. V, p. 8, line 2), which gives a list of 8 "male Rmaii slaves." Remen, Rmen occur also in Javanese inscriptions dated I02I A.D.: see Brandes and Krom, Oud- Javaansche Oorkonden (Verhandel. Batav.

These Hill-Burmese, like the Danu of today, talked the Burmese language with dialectal differences. They may well be the Mcank of Marvazi, as Prof. V. Minorsky suggests (on pp. 49, I50 of his translation).

All wore white ceremonial clothes'46 and hair-bands (juik sok). Some Brahmans wore girdles (mekhald)147 and carried tridents or forked spears (?)148. Various musical instruments, drums, trumpets, etc.149, would be struck or blown at appropriate moments, and then the audience would shout. Buddhism in this inscription yields pride of place to Vaisnava Brahmanism, NMga-worship, and other rites. Buddhist monks were called, in particular, to recite protective charms (paritta) round all the buildings, especially the throne-room'50. On Feb. 28th iio2 "offerings were made to Indra and all the devas," likewise to "all the images of Buddha which are in this city of Paga'n'5"'. The main Buddhist ceremonies took place on March ist to 2nd, when, after worship of Nar (Visnu), the ma- hMthera Arahan arrived with seven leading monks and spread lotus leaves on all the spots where the holes for the various posts were to be dug'52. Four thousand monks were distributed outside, under eight leaders in the reciting of the payit. Inside there were io8 principal monks, headed by Arahan. Near the east porch of the " Great Hall"'53 (which seems here to include the Throne-room), a sanctuary was made for gold images of the Buddha and Gavan~pati, and for a set of the Tipitaka (Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma). Drums and trumpets were sounded in honour of the Buddha, Gavarhpati, and all the 4I08 monks headed by Arahan. The officials reverently asked for the 'Refuges' ksaralasfl), the parit, and the mafgal (blessing) to be recited within, without, and all around. Arahan stood at the west side, facing the Buddha on the east, commanding (one imagines) the whole of the Great Pavilion. He held in his hand a right-voluted conch-shell (symbol of Visnu), as he gave the 'Refuges', all the 4I08 monks within and without remaining standing. 142 Pandit. Faces A37, G30. 143 trap dwitsac.

Assisted by "the children of Mon chiefs" and other officials and prominent men, they would hold a midnight service, reciting the part at the various points desired, and sprinkling from conch-shells paritta water, mixed with husked rice and 'doob' grass'55. - Apart from these mentions, Buddhism hardly enters into the proceedings; and one wonders if all of these can rightly be called Buddhist. After the averting of evil and the blessing of the site and the posts, before breaking of the soil, the NMgas (whose domain it was) had to be propitiated15. This was done (if my proposed order of faces is correct - H after A) immediately after the Buddhist ceremony, on March 2nd157. After worship of Ndr (Visnu), a sanctuary was made for the Ndgas. Sand was placed on all the spots where holes were to be dug - the spots already covered with lotus leaves by Arahan and his monks. The sambeA Praj- fldlankdr ceremoniously pressed into the ground a gold peg with seven silver cords attached, and patted the sand smooth. Then he brought gold leaf (the passage unfortunately is fragmentary), and "thread spun by virgin daughters of Brahmans, daughters of tender age,". . . and "spades with turned handles ( ?)158". Holy water was sprinkled frequently. Prajfidlafikdr and the chief architect took the lead159. The kalan siy first dug the holes for the "male side-posts"; the kalan kerh dug the holes for the "female side-posts"; the kalan sd dug the holes for the yas posts, and so on. The number of strokes of the spade at each spot was carefully fixed. Next it was the turn of the Posts to be propitiated. On March 3rd the "mat" (snal) at their bases was made of pounded stone160. On March 6th gold was applied161, and the toiwds (probably some part of the post) specially bathed162. Thirty-seven sanctuaries were made for the Posts, each one furnished with a mat, four pots of water, husked rice and 'doob' grass. Perhaps jewels were inlaid. On March 7th gold leaf, silver leaf, and copper leaf were buried at ten spots163. The bottom of each Post was covered with gold, silver and copper leaf - three layers. Their bases were wrapped with cloth inscribed with "writings of victory" (jeyyaleklu). After recitation and sprinkling, they were bound with thread spun by "virgin daughters of Brahmans, daughters of tender age," on io8 spoolsM64. Then and not before, on Friday March 7th II02, the Posts of the throne-room were set up vertically in their holes. It was the great day, when the king, "the lord abounding in merit" as he is here called'65, appears for the only time in the inscription.

" His white elephant, Eravana-mahdvijeyya-bajrabhfim, " Great Adamantine Seat of Victory", named Airdvana after Indra's elephant, was on one side, his riding horse on the other, both richly caparisoned. Palanquins - possibly for the palace ladies - followed after. The officials and Brahmans did obeisance; and the latter, after asking permission, "worshipped Ndr after the ancient manner167." Drums and trumpets sounded, and there was a great shout. All the Posts were now built up, their lotus bases wound with white cloth, their holes first fed with boiled rice, fresh milk, and the five kinds of gems; and they were all washed and worshipped168. On the following day, Saturday March 8th, the leading ministers dug holes at the four sides of the yas posts, and buried four caskets of copper containing the four treasures (gold, silver and jewels) wrapped in white cloth169. On March I2th the posts of the muk were set up - the porches of the throne- room, and the four gateways of the enclosure-wall; also the four atas poscs at the corners of the Great Pavilion1 70. On Wednesday April 2nd the hall and doors of the jui dal were completed171. On April 7th the posts were carved172. On Wednesday April 9th attention was given to the four-sided ambulatory (triit jii Mluk). 173 Before April i6th (?) the stairways (sopdn) were completed174. But all this latter part is fragmentary175. PROBLEMS OF THE REIGN Kyanzittha's palace-inscription, set beside the others, both autobiographic and 'prophetic', and the evidence of his major temples, the Nagayon and the Nanda, as well as that of his chief queen, Abeyadana, present a complex picture of intense multi-religious life. To distinguish Palace and Pagoda, and to claim that Burmese kings were Brahmanist in the one, and Buddhist in the other, may possibly be valid in a secular age; but cannot, I think, be true of early Pagan, when religion dominated every- thing. Not a Paga'n citizen by birth, Kyanzittha had devoted years of loyal service to Pagan kings. They had shown themselves ungrateful. Recalled from exile to save Paga'n from ruin, he had done so; and in I084 became king of Pagan by sheer merit, almost in spite of himself. According to the Jatbo'n Yazawin176, he was then 54 years old. This would put his birth about I030 A.D. If so, he was barely 25 when, in the middle I050's, he became Aniruddha's cavalry-general. Few Burmans, and not many Mons, could have grudged him the Pagan throne. Why, then, was he at pains to forge a Buddha- prophecy, and promulgate fantastic stories of his former lives? Why did he, a Burman, insist on tracing 166 Face F14 and onwards. Does ma say, "lower", here mean smaw kya, "north" ? The passage is difficult and the rendering doubtful.

It measures about 91 in. x 61 in., and is apparently a piece broken off from a corner of a four-sided stone column of fairly large size. The language is Old Mon, but on account of its fragmentary nature it has not been possible to make a translation of it. Palaeographically it may belong to king Kyanzittha's time (io84-III2 A.D.). The stone has now been preserved in the Archaeological Office, Mandalay" (A .S.I. I930-34, Part I, P. 247). - I have not seen this fragment; but a rubbing or photograph was presumably sent to Blagden, whose manuscript-book (p. I35), now at the London School of Oriental and African Studies, gives his first readings. There are only 6 short fragmentary lines, it seems, on one side, and 3 on another; there are 3 mentions of "litters" (Iwar), which remind one of many passages in the palace-inscription. But it must be admitted that Myinpagan is a mile from the palace-site. 178Jdtat6pumn Rdjavah, p. 40 (No. 44).</page><page sequence="90">72 Chapter IV his descent from the Pyu of Prome (Srf Ksetra), yet leave inscriptions there written, neither in Bur- mese nor Pyu, but in Mon? Why was he the only Burmese king to use, almost exclusively in writing, the Mon language? Why did he choose to build dark romantic cave-temples of 'Mon' type, so different from the solid stupas of Aniruddha, so different from the plain bright lofty Burmese temples of most of his successors? His chief queen, who, according to the legend, had faithfully followed him with food when he was a weary outlaw177, was a devoted Bengal Mahdydnist. She built the most deeply lovely Buddhist temple at Pagan, while he, on the other side of the road, was building the Nagayon - the first temple to show his complete conversion to Singhalese Theravdda. At the same time his son (not hers), Ra-jakumdr, was hard at work (at the Mrakan stone library, 1 believe), aided by the best scholars of Pagan, on Pali and Singhalese texts. His father, and the mahithera Arahan, were preaching daily sermons to the people. The best sculptors were at work producing thousands178 of stone and terracotta sculptures of the life and lives of the Buddhas, not the Bodhisattvas. The best painters were covering acres of walls in temples with illustrations of the whole Tipitaka, Vinaya, Suttanta, Abhidhamma179. All, except his loved and loving chief queen, were helping to lead Burma fast into the Theravdda fold. A sincere Buddhist, deeply religious, eager to uphold, spread and purify the religion, why did he claim to be an Avatar of Visnu? The mahdther Arahan was his "right hand man "180, the supposed importer of pure Theravdda Buddhism from Thaton. Why did they both take part in, or permit, these Vaisnava Brahmanic ceremonies, this Naga-worship, spirit-worship, and the primitive cult of House-posts? Why, finally, was he succeeded by his grandson, though his own dear royal son, Rdjakumdr, was present at his deathbed, showing a touching gratitude to a father who had disinherited him? These are hard questions. Perhaps one is on the road to solving them once one admits that Kyan- zittha was a Burma nationalist (probably the first of them) rather than a Burmese nationalist. So far as Burmans were concerned, he had no need to forge a Buddha-prophecy. But he was not content, it seems, to resume the humble role of the pre -Aniruddha kings of Tambadipa. Already, under Aniruddha, he had conquered Lower Burma: but he himself calls it "other countries'"181. It seems that he con- ceived, and was perhaps the first to conceive, a plan of high statesmanship: not merely to conquer Burma, as Aniruddha had done, but to unite it. Under the aegis of Buddhism - chiefly, but not only the Theravada - Buddhism of a wide syncretistic kind, embracing not only Mahdydnism and the earlier Thntric schools of East Bengal, but also the old Vedic and Brahmanic cults (excluding sac- rifice), especially Vai snavism, whose influence was deep in Lower Burma, both among Mon and Pyu; heedful also of the ol d NMga-worship of the north, of native Burmese animism (still prominent at his 177 "Once when Saw Lu was wroth with him, and his prosperity and followers were forfeited, he slept alone in a grazing ground for horses; and while he slept a young Naga came and watched over him. At that place, when he became king, he built the Nagayon pagoda" (G.P.C., p. io8). "His wife" adds Taw Sein Ko, "who had brought some food for him, . .. not daring to approach the spot .... waited for the disappearance of the serpent which glided away silently" (Amended List of Ancient Monuments in Burma, Rangoon I92I, Meiktila Division No. 35, p. 22). 178 Nanda temple alone contains about i6oo stone reliefs, mostly of Kyanzittha's period, and I464 green- glazed terracottas.

It was perhaps Kyan- zittha's modest and broad-minded view of the Burman's role in Burma, that was largely responsible for the remarkable stability of the kingdom, which, militarily weak as it was, lasted nearly two hun- dred years after him, disturbed by little internal strife, and only perished under the overwhelming force of alien invaders. His broad religious policy succeeded; for whatever the Chronicles may say, Paga'n Buddhism, sincere and ardent as it was, was far from pure. His language policy was not equally enduring; but under the circumstances, and granted the ends he had in view, it is hard to see what other he could have adopted. For the iith century, we have to imagine the present proportion of Burmese and Mons reversed: a small minority of conquering Bur- mans, large numbers of native Mons; among the Burmans, only a few literates, mostly in Kyaukse and the capital; among the Mons, an old evolved literature, worthy vehicle for the arts, Buddhism and government. The first necessity for a united Burma was a common written language. The only possible alternative then to Mon was, not Burmese, but Pyu. Pyu, though venerable, was now archaic, and its peculiar script a curiosity. In numbers, too, and range, the Pyu were doubtless far inferior to the Mon. In seeking to impose the Mon written language on the peoples of Burma, Kyanzittha had reason enough: but other considerations, I suspect, may have influenced his choice. Like many another conqueror in history, the victor of the Mons was vanquished by their culture. Perhaps he under- estimated the immense vitality of his own people, and the latent possibilities of their language. Shortly after his death, in III3 A.D., his own son, Rajakumar, engraved the first dated inscription in Old Burmese; and after a half-century of hesitation under his successors, Kyanzittha's language- policy was finally reversed by Can-sfi II (Narapatisithu): Burmese entered into its own, and within three centuries Burmese was influencing Mon, more than ever Mon had influenced Burmese. RAJAKUMAR'S QUADRILINGUAL INSCRIPTION, III3 A.D. Before we come to the problem of the succession, let us first look close at Rdjakumar's inscription. It records a touching scene at his father's deathbed. It is the famous inscription wrongly known as the 'Myazedi'182. The Myazedi pagoda is a solid stupa of modern date at Myinpagan, a mile south of Pagan. It stands on the north bank of the Myinkaba 'stream', which runs winding through the village. The site was once part of the precincts of the temple now called the [Myinkaba] Kubyauk-gyi, "Great Variegated Temple." The latter adjoins the Myazedi on the west, and is a dark elaborate cave-temple, typically 'Old Mon', full of Mon paintings and writings, similar to the 'Mon' temples of Kyanzittha. It is certainly this temple, and not the late stupa, which is the subject of the inscription. It was doubtless built in or about III3 A.D., shortly after Kyanzittha's death. The inscription is engraved in duplicate on two four-sided pillars, each with faces written in four languages, Pali, Mon, Pyu and Burmese. Pillar A, the smaller and better preserved one, was found in i886-7 by Dr. Forchhammer on the north side of the Myazedi; it is now Stone io at Paga'n Museum. B, the larger pillar, was found in fragments, two "within the precincts of the Kubyaukgyi temple, which adjoins the Myazedi on the west"; the lower half "deeply buried in an erect position near a small, old brick building close to the Myazedi, on the east, and which is supposed to have been a 182 PIs. 337, 338.

This last site would seem to have been its original place. The fragments have been re-erected on the platform of the Myazedi. Though damaged, the lettering of Pillar B is large and masterly and beautifully clear. The inscription illustrates the linguistic changes of the moment. Sanskrit has almost gone; Pali takes its place. Mon of course is there. Pyu remains, almost for the last time in epigraphy. Burmese enters, almost for the first. No earlier dated inscription in Burmese, genuinely contemporary, has yet been discovered, though older writings in that language may well exist. The Pali, Mon, and Burmese faces are written in the same script, derived from South India via Dvaravati in Lower Siam. The Pyu face is in a very different, though also South Indian script, Kanarese of most archaic type, almost identical with the script used for the Pyu language at Arl Ksetra and Halin from the 7th century onwards, but without the interlinear Brdhmi found in the oldest Pyu inscriptions. The Mon, Pyu, and Burmese faces are in prose, and closely correspond. The Pali is in verse, and is more free. Kyanzittha, it is said, "a powerful king, scion of the exalted Solar family"1'3, became king at Pagan in i628 A.D. -C. io84 A.D., probably the date of his actual accession. He had "a beloved queen, Trilo- kavatamtsakddevTl84, benevolent and skilful in all the affairs of the king." Her son was Rajakumdr, "a minister zealous in the affairs of state, prudent and wise." He is the donor. The king had given the queen for her support three villages of slaves: - one, Munalon (or Munalwan) of the Sak (Thets), was somewhere down the river below Pagain185; the second, Rapay, was near Legaing, north of Minbu, in the Six kharuinl86; the third, Henbuiw (elsewhere written Hyanpuiw, Yhanpuiw), was near the coast, probably not far from Rangoon187; it was the chief seaport of Burma during the dynasty. When the queen died, the king made over her property, including the three villages, to her son Rdjakumdr. After reigning righteously for 28 years, i.e. till about III2 A.D. - the accession-date of his successor is given elsewhere as III4188, so perhaps we may split the difference and date his death provisionally in III3 -"the king was seized with mortal sickness. Rajakumdr, remembering the many and great favours with which the king had nourished him," made a beautiful gold image of the Buddha, and entering with ceremony presented it to the king, saying: 'This golden Buddha I have made to help my lord. The three villages of slaves you gave me, I give to this Buddha. May my lord approve!' And the king, though "his mind was troubled by disease", rejoiced and said: 'Well done! Well done!' Then, in the presence of the compassionate mahdthera (his name is not given) and other leading monks - Muggaliputta, the scholar Sumedha, Brahmapdla, Brahmadeva, the learned Sona and the great scholar Saftghasena, the king poured on the ground the water of dedication, calling the earth to witness. Then Rdjakumdr enshrined the golden image, and built around it a cave-temple with a golden pinnacle - the Kubyauk-gyi of Myinkaba. PROBLEM OF THE SUCCESSION All the Chronicles are agreed that on his death Kyanzittha was succeeded, not by his son Rdjaku- mar, but by his grandson, Caiisfi I, known today as Alaungsithu. Perhaps the Kubyauk-gyi was not 183 Tibhuvanddicco udiccadicca vamhsajo (I.B., P1.

Describing the group of five stupas lining the ridge north of Pagan Museum, Duroiselle says189: "It was built during the reign of king Kyanzit- tha ... by, tradition has it, his own son Rajakumdr, for the restoration of his old father's health, hence its name" - Min-o-chantha, "Happiness for the old King." What lay behind the strange drama of Kyanzittha's death-bed? For drama it certainly was, unless one denies the unanimous tradition that Kyanzittha was succeeded by his grandson. The difficulty was not ignored by the Chronicles; and they are never at a loss for explanation. Kyanzittha, they say,190 had a favourite daughter, Shw6-6ng-thi. When her son was born (of somewhat dubious paterni- ty), the throne-door opened of itself, the great palace-drum sounded without anyone striking it. The baby cried incessantly, till his navel issued about a span, so that he was known thereafter as 'Chet- taw-she', "Long Navel". The astrologers warned the king that he would not stop crying until he was anointed king and heard the record of his kingdom's boundaries. This was done, and the babe was pacified. Now, long ere this,'9' when Kyanzittha was an outlaw fleeing from the wrath of Aniruddha, he had lived in the northern jungles at Kyaungbyu (KloA phlii) with Thambula, niece of a monk there. She was with child when Aniruddha died and Kyanzittha was recalled to Pagan. Before leaving, he gave her a ring saying: "If it is a girl, sell this ring and rear her. If it is a boy, bring me the son and the ring". Kyanzittha had been king two years when she came, leading her seven-year-old son. With difficulty she got admission to the palace. As soon as Kyanzittha saw her, he welcomed her and made her a queen; but embracing his son, he said: "Men say that the son is the root, and grandson the branch. Yet but now I have anointed my grandson king, and lo! the grandson is the root and the son the branch !" Unfortunately, this tale of the jungle wife with her son by the king, forcing her way into the palace, is a well-known Indian folk-tale. It occurs in the ist parvan of Vydsa's MahaCbharata (the birth of the future sovereign Bharata, by Sakuntald and king Dusyanta). The story recurs in Kaliddsa's play Sakuntald. Nearer to Burma, it recurs in the Katthahdri Jdtaka (No. 7)192, with this difference, that whereas king Brahmadatta of Benares disowns the child until forced into recognition, Kyanzittha behaves at once like a gentleman: "Great favour, verily, hath this lady shown me ...". - As for 'Chettawsh6', "Long Navel," it is a mistake (no doubt intentional) for 'ThettawshV', "Long Life," which is an authentic title of Canisfi I193. I am afraid we cannot accept these bright solutions. In Ch. III (pp. 48-49), on the basis of some late inscriptions, I have argued that Rajakumrr had to be passed over because of a pact made, at the crisis of Nga Raman's rebellion, between Kyanzittha and the Mon king's descendants: a pact which assured the stability of the Pagan kingdom by uniting it under a grandson half Mon and half Burmese. Reading between the lines, I think that Kyanzittha on his deathbed felt anew the anguish of having disinherited his beloved son; and that the son, 189 A.S.I. 1922, p. 35 and PI. XIX a.

The pact was honoured. Rajakumdr had to step down. Yet there is no hint of ill-will, jealousy or usurpation. Rdjakumdr completed his masterpiece, the Kubyaukgyi, under the reign of his nephew. RAJAKUMAR THE SCHOLAR What transpires from a study of the Mon writings in this temple, is that Rajakumdr was not only a good, loyal and unselfish son, a man of rare nobility, but also a remarkable scholar - a true Tipitaka- dhara. If Kyanzittha's pact debarred him from any prominent part in politics, I strongly suspect that his father found other uses for his great abilities. I have mentioned already (supra, p. 57) the Mrakan stone lodge or library (PI. 242) which once stood near the Mrakan lake, at the foot of Tuywindaung, 8 miles south-east of Paga'n. It was certainly built by Kyanzittha, and not - as said in the Chronicles - by Kyazwa. The Chroniclers are not likely to have read Kyanzittha's Mon inscription on the bank of the lake, but they record some vague memory of its purport and its final words. The king - "dammed the water falling from the foot of Mt. Tuywin, and made a great lake. He filled it with the five kinds of lotus and caused all manner of birds, duck, shelduck, crane, waterfowl and ruddy goose to take their joy and pastime therein ... Hard by the lake he built a pleasant royal lodge, and took delight in study seven times a day. Thus he laboured at the sacred writ of the Religion194." Kyanzittha himself was a most active king, and could not have spared much time for scholarly study, so far from his capital. But if, as stated, the lodge was built for royalty, for the intensive study of the Tipitaka, I think it likely that Kyanzittha built it for his son Rdjakumdr, at a quiet lovely spot where, far from the dangers of the Court, he could devote himself to study and translation, in the company of learned monks. Those learned monks, if so, are likely to be those who accompanied him to the bedside of his dying father. Their names have been mentioned above. Three of the seven, Suimedha, Sona, and Satghasena, are singled out as scholars (pandito, bahussuto, vayapan1ito). The thera Sumedha may well be the monk who stamped the thousand votive tablets of 'Chitsagon', east of Nanda,of which more than a hundred have been recovered, inscribed on the back with perhaps the oldest Burmese writing extant (PIs. 3I, 4I to 48). His other votive tablet (P1. 5I c, d) showing the First Sermon, with the Buddha seated with legs hanging (pralambandsana), has a Pali inscription incised on the back: - "This thera, like Ndgasena, takes keen delight in learning. By this work of making a thousand Buddhas, may he become a Buddha in his future existence. The work was done by the monk named Sumedha, with his own hand, for the sake of Deliverance." This is the first (and, I think, only) reference to the Milindapafiha in Pagan inscriptions. Ndgasena, the thera who explained Buddhism to the Indo-Greek king Milinda/Menander, was born, one remem- bers, at Kaja* gala, RdjmahMJ, on the right bank of the Ganges near its bend to the south - an important stage on the road to Assam, Burma and China'95. The thera Muggaliputta, mentioned first after the maheithera, may be the dcayiya Muggaliputta who has left us several votive tablets, always boldly engraved with his fine signature in Pali on the back. One tablet, rare and beautiful, also comes from 'Chitsagon'. It shows five earth-touching Buddhas in 194 U Kala, I, P. 278. Hmannan (Susodhita Ed.), I, pp. 341-2 (transl. G.P.C., p. 156). 95 Cf. Pelliot, BEFEO t. IV, pp. i8I-2.</page><page sequence="95">Chapter IV 77 three rows, alternating with large old-fashioned stupas and leafage. Below them, in high relief, is the Buddhist credo in 3 lines of semi-Sanskrit/Nagarl (P1. 6i a, b, c). Other tablets (P1. 59 c, d, e), found in a field south-west of Htilominlo, show the Buddha seated between Sdriputta and Moggalldna. All three figures are large-headed and plump below their leafage, not stern and tall like the Aniruddha type. Rdjakumdr's writings in his temple are all in Mon, but his mentality was not Mon, but Burmese. Burmese scholars from the first - take STlavamsa for example - like to get their dates fixed and frame- work clear and exact. A large part of the little Yazawingyawl98 is devoted to chronology. Rdjakumdr had the same instinct. He was not as deeply religious as his father. The long devotional rows of Buddhas in Nanda temple, endlessly repeated, are not to be found in his temple. Every painted panel is free- drawn and tells its story, and has a gloss below it to explain it. The esoteric side of Buddhism, in- cluding the Suttas, he omits. If he stresses the Abhidhamma, it is just the external details, not the philosophy. For the Vinaya, his main care was to picture the cities where the rules were enacted. He was, in fact, an extrovert: a man of boundless intellectual curiosity, credulous no doubt, but eager to emerge from the primitive night of doubt and superstition, into the daylight of accepted history. He set himself to master the full range of Theravdda literature, cosmology and history, and to show it clearly in his temple. He had all a Burman's love of a good tale, and a sense of humour which no access of piety could repress. A man interested in systems of government, and what they lead to. A humane man who did not forget the poor, the orphan and the starving. All this is visible on his walls. Above all, Rajakumdr's quadrilingual stone inscription shows him as perhaps unique, in his lifetime, in recognizing not only the possibilities of Burmese as a written language, but also the debt it owed, both to India, homeland of Buddhism, and to the oldest Buddhist cultures of Burma, Mon and Pyu. ARCHITECTURE OF THE REIGN The chief pagodas and other works of Kyanzittha's reign, with suggestions as to their dates, are the following: - i. Tharaba Gate of Pagan rebuilt. c. I084 A.D. (?). P1. i68. (Ch. XVI, pp. 3I0-I). 2. Pancaprdsdda for the king's abhiseka. io86 A.D. Probably of wood. Perished. 3. Jayabhfimi site. Shwdzigon pagoda, Nyaung-u. Built by the king c. io86 A.D. (?). Pis. i69-i82. (Ch. XIII, pp. 267-276). 4. Nagayon temple, south of Myinpagan, on the east side of the road. 'Mon' Theravdda temple. Built by the king c. I090 A.D. (?). PIs. I84-206. (Ch. XVI, pp. 3II-32I). 5. Abeyadana temple, south of Myinpagan, on the west side of the road. A 'Mon' Tantric-Mahayan- ist temple. Built by his chief queen, Abeyadana. c. I090 A.D. (?). Pls. 207-24I. (Ch. XVI, pp. 32I-344). 6. Alampaga'n and Mrakan reservoirs dammed. 6-8 miles S.E. of Pagan. Before I098 A.D. (?) 7. Stone Library near Mrakan Lake, at the foot of Tuywindaung. Before I098 A.D. Now perished. P1. 242 (Ch. XVII, pp. 345-347). 8. S4r Bajrds, the Vafrdsana or Mahabodhi temple at Bodhgaya, India. Rebuilt by the king before I098 A.D. (See P1. I90 d). 9. Ceti of Kyak Talan, repaired by the king in I098 A.D. Myatheindan pagoda, Ayetthema, Mt. Kelasa, Thaton district. 196 RdjaavaA kyo by Shin Thilawuntha, 1520 A.D. (87 pp., Wuntha Rakkha Pitakat Press, Rangoon).</page><page sequence="96">78 Chapter IV io. Prdsdda of the Great Relic of Satih, repaired by the king in i098 A.D. Kyaik T6 pagoda, S.W. of AlugaI6, N. of Taungzun, Thaton district. II. Shw6 Chaung Kubyauk-ng6 temple, on the east bank of the Shw6 Chaung. Large Theravada 'Mon' temple with tall sikhara of Bodhgayd type, and Jdtaka paintings with Mon glosses in the hall. I guess its date to be c. IIOO A.D. Pls. 243-245. (Ch. XVII, pp. 347-349). I2. Palace at Pagan. IIOI-2 A.D. Probably of wood. Perished. 13. 'Ananda' temple. Original name Nanda, or Nandamilla. Built by the king c. II05 A.D. (?), the crowning masterpiece of Theravdda 'Mon' architecture. Frontispiece and Pls. 264-334 (Ch. XVIII, PP. 357-373). I4. Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi temple. 'Mon' temple built by the king's son, Prince Rajakumdr. Completed shortly after his father's death, c. III3 A.D. Pls. 335-350. (Ch. XVIII, pp. 373-383). Less certainly, I would date the following pagodas to Kyanzittha's reign, largely on stylistic grounds: - i5. Gu i8o, E. of Nagayon temple. This is of 'Mon' type; and it seems that a fifty-Buddha votive tablet signed by 9rT Tribhuvanidditya, i.e. Kyanzittha, has been found within its walls. P1. 362. (Ch. XIX, p. 398). i6. Gu 20I, S. of Hsul6gon, E. of the Shw6 Chaung. This temple, furthest from the Irawady of all the 'Mon' temples, was only half excavated when I saw it. There is plain evidence of Bengal Mahayanism, which I connect with the Chronicles' account of Kyanzittha's welcome to the monks "from Mt. Gandhamadana" (G.P.C. p. iio): which led, in turn, to the building of the Nanda. Pls. 256, 257. (Ch. XVII, pp. 355-356). I7. Mydbontha Payahla. A 'Mon' two-storeyed temple N.E. of Shw6hsandaw. It has a tall s?ikhara reminiscent of Bodhgaya; carved stone windows; and a massive throne, four-sided,with rows of stone Brahmas. Pls. 248-25I (Ch. XVII, pp. 352-353). I8. Hlaing-gu I30, N.E. of Alopyi' temple. Another 'Mon' two-storeyed temple, largely in ruin. Pls. 252, 253 (Ch. XVII, pp. 353-354). I9. Hlaing-sh6 Gu 25i, near Nabedaw, west of the Shw6 Chaung. Another ruined 'Mon' temple, with stone windows, stucco carvings, and paintings of the 'Eight Scenes'. Pls. 254, 255 (Ch. XVII, pp. 354-355)- 20. Gu 4i8, S.E. of Lokananda, on the west side of the road to Chauk. A small temple with Mon paintings, Mon glosses, and fine stuccowork. Pls. 246, 247. (Ch. XVII, pp. 349-352). 2I. S6-min-gyi pagoda, south of Abeyadana temple, west of the road. This lofty stupa is lined with fine glazed carvings. There are three high terraces, without median stairways. Pls. 259c,d-262 (bis). (Ch. XIII, pp. 277-278). 22. Min-o-chantha line of five graded stupas. N.E. of Nanda. The name means "Happiness of the Old King." One tradition attributes the work to Rajakumar, anxious about his father's health. The Glass Palace Chronicle (p. IIo) attributes it to Kyanzittha himself. The Early Ava Hldauk inscription (List 5o a2) assigns the name (misspelt) to Cafisul I, who also had a long life. P1. 263 (Ch. XIII, pp. 276-277). 23. Sin'pihto, "Glazed Pagoda". A middle-sized stupa west of Alopyi' temple. The temple has an ink-inscription dated II94 A.D. which names the stupa - Can puthuiw (I.B. P1. IV 367 a8). It may go back to the early part of the century. P1. 258 c (Ch. XIII, p. 277).</page><page sequence="97">Chapter IV 79 ARCHITECTURE AND BUDDHIST EDUCATION A few general remarks in conclusion. - Harvey, speaking of the Shwezigon, attributes to Aniruddha a saying which would better suit Kyanzittha: "Men will not come for the sake of the new faith. Let them come for their old gods, and gradually they will be won over97"'. Nearly 9 centuries have passed at the Shwezigon, and the transition is still far from complete. The Nagayon, Nanda and Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi point to a much more effective method - by education, leading up to bhakti, personal commitment and devotion. The Temple proper is still reserved for worship and adoration; but the Hall, including perhaps the Corridor, is used for the education of the public. Villagers would come mostly on fast-days; and were urged, I guess, to spend much of their time in the Halls. The Nagayon has only one Hall. Here io key-sculptures were placed, with 5 or 6 more in the Corridor, covering the main events in the life of the Buddha. There were also 27 sculptures showing the previous Buddhas198. No doubt, monks or teachers were provided to explain all these to their audience. Both sides of the corridor were full of paintings, some of great size: a mixed gallery of Suttas, Jdtakas and scenes from the life of the Buddha. Kyanzittha, I suspect, was not satisfied with the result. The Nagayon was too far from the city; its corridors too dark for even these large panels to be seen clearly from below. The Nanda was just outside the city-wall. He built it with four broad Halls, forming a perfect Greek Cross in plan. Each Hall had the same i6 scenes in stone relief, all identically arranged (Pls. 298-3i2). The monks (or teachers) could cope with four audiences simultaneously. The scenes cover the whole life of the Buddha, from the Conception to the Parinirvdna. When well-grounded in these, the audience would pass to the outer wall of the outer corridor. Here, in two tiers, running around the whole corridor, are the well-known 8o scenes of Gotama's life up to the Enlightenment (Pls. 278-297). The later life of the Buddha was shown in hundreds of other stone-reliefs on the inner walls and shrines (Pls. 3I3-323). There was no painting except in the Halls, where now all is drowned in whitewash. Outside are I459 green glazed plaques (Pls. 324-334): 552 on the ground-plinth illustrate, with Mon glosses, Mdra's army and the Buddha's triumph; 532 on the middle roofs illustrate the bulk of the Jdtakas, one plaque apiece with Pali title and number; and 375 lining the upper terraces, with Mon glosses, illustrate the Mahdnipdta. RMjakumdr in his temple reverts to painting, mostly in small panels, each with explanatory glosses (Pls. 345-350): the whole giving a picture of world-history as known to the Buddhists of those days, covering not only India but Ceylon. The main purpose behind all these temples was educational. In the absence of schools (monastic schools for Burmans were only starting), it is hard to imagine a more effective method. Kyanzittha's statuary, less grand perhaps than Aniruddha's, but deeper and more intensely devotional, still dominates religious art in Burma. NOTE ON THE ORDER OF FACES OF THE PALACE-INSCRIPTION In his "Descriptive Account" introducing Mon Inscription No. IX (Epig. Birm. Vol. III, Part I, p. i ff.), Dr. Blagden admitted that he was doubtful whether his ordering of the faces (A to S) was the right one. His doubt was justified. He was not given sufficient information, nor accurate measurements 197 History of Burma, p. 33. 198 Pls. I93-202. Mon Bo Kay, Conservator of Pagan, was the first to identify these 27 Buddhas, all but one seated in dhydna mudrd.</page><page sequence="98">8o Chapter IV of the stones. As a result, he came to the erroneous conclusion that "the inscription must originally have comprised at least six columns, of which the first, preceding Faces A to D, is entirely lost. The original must have extended to over i,ooo lines, of which less than half have been preserved." The chief difficulty arises, not over Stones I and 2 (Faces A to H), which are complete four-sided pillars, but over the broken Stones 6, 7, 8 and 9. After taking my own measurements and coming, in consequence, to conclusions different from Blagden's, I asked our late Chairman of the Burma Histori- cal Commission, Sithu U Kaung, and the then Chairman of Sub-Commission B, Colonel Ba Shin, while we were on a visit to Pagan in Jan. I956, to be kind enough to take their own measurements of these stones, independently, and to draw their own conclusions. Their measurements (which agree closely with mine, but are probably more accurate) are given below; and their conclusions were identical with mine: viz. that Stone 7 was originally the upper part of Stone 6, and Stone 8 of Stone 9; but that the West face of Stone 8 (as at present set up at Pagan Museum) must have rested on the East face of Stone 9. Note that all these pillars taper slightly from top to bottom. We need assume, therefore, that there were originally no more than 4 four-sided pillars, altogether i6 complete faces (I number them below Faces I to i6). The order of faces throughout (as on all Kyanzittha's four-sided pillars) ran anti-clockwise - East, North, West, and South - providing the most convenient passage at the transitions; so that if these pillars were originally orientated (as they probably were) towards the east, Faces I, 5, 9 and I3 faced east; 2, 6, IO and I4 faced north; 3, 7, II and i5 faced west; and 4, 8, I2 and i6 faced south. If we may assume that the pillars were arranged in descending order of magnitude, that order should be: - Pillar I (Faces I to 4) - Stone 8/9. Pillar II (Faces 5 to 8) - Stone I. Pillar III (Faces 9 to I2) - Stone 2. Pillar IV (Faces I3 to i6) - Stone 7/6. Generally, the writing on each pillar will begin on one of the broader faces, and end on one of the narrower. But this is not true of the last pillar, where the inscription appears to end on the broad west face, the lower part of which is not engraved. On the strength of the above conclusions, I propose (and have adopted in my treatment of the text) the following amended order of the faces: - Order of Faces Pagan Museum Stones 8/9 - S N, R, Q, 0, P; followed by Pagan Museum Stone I - B, C, D, A; followed by Pagan Museum Stone 2 - H, E, F, G; and finally Pagan Museum Stones 7/6 - J, K, L, M. Note that rubbings of 6 half-faces were not sent to Dr. Blagden, no doubt for the reason that they were deemed illegible. I number these half-faces below in Greek: - OC, A,' r, 8, ?,</page><page sequence="99">Chapter IV 8i Confirmation (or otherwise) of the proposed order may also be sought in internal evidence, especially the order of themes and the dating of the various events.

B'1 and C17), the main dates and ceremonies fall be- tween Feb. 23rd (C21) and April i6th II02. For date-correspondences Blagden consulted the late authority on Indian chronology, Sir Robert Sewell, whose rulings would be final if one could be sure that the Mon/Burmese calendar at Pagan corresponded exactly with the Indian. But Blagden's notes (p. 39, n. I2; p. 43, n. II; p. 48, n. I5; p. 53, n. I; p. 54, n. 9) show that he often had difficulty in fitting the Mon details into the Indian pattern. I feel very doubtful whether all the Indian rules were observed in Burma, e.g. the one stated on p. 43, n. II: "the rule is that the day takes its number from the lunar day (tithi) current at sunrise." So far as Old Burmese is concerned, there were two methods of day-counting: the sasana ryak, the ordinary day of the month; and the tithi ryak, the lunar day, reckoned (presumably) by dividing by 30 the lunar month of 29.530587946 days, according to the Sfirya Siddhanta. Both methods were known: see, e.g., I.B., P1. V 609 a (a horoscope): - sasand 7 ryak hurd mha tithi 6 ryak caniy "the 7th day of the religious month, the 6th lunar day according to astrologers, a Saturday". But at PagAn, it seems, this latter reckoning was rarely made. Burmans were normally content with the sasana- ryak. If this was also true of the Mons, we may generally spare ourselves the labour of working out the tithi. But owing to the apparent irregularity in the insertion of leap days and leap months, our method, if we wish to relate the Pag~an calendar to the Julian, must be the purely empirical one, of devising a scheme of correspondence which suits best the evidence of the best actual dates in contemporary inscriptions, and breaks fewest of the Indian rules.</page><page sequence="101">CHAPTER V CANSU I (Alaungsithu), DONOR OF RHUY-KU (Shwegu); fi.

Today, as in the Chronicles2 and some lateish inscriptions3, he is called AloA-caflsfi, 'Alaungsithu' - a perfectly good name, though liable to confusion. 'Alaung' here means 'Future Buddha': a term often applied to kings, generally after their death. Several of the later kings of Pagan are called Can-si. To distinguish this king, we must either call him Can-si I, or fall back on one of his titles: either Sak-taw-rhani, "Long Royal Life", which occurs in at least one original inscription4, or Rhuykidayaka, "Donor of the Shwegu temple", which occurs in two5. In the Pali inscription set up in that temple6, he is given his regnal title: Srf Tibhuvanddityapavara- dhammardja, "Most excellent King of the Law, Sun of the three Existences" (men, Devas, and Brah- mas) - a title similar to that first used by his grandfather, but with the addition of pavara, "most excellent." 1 Caiisfi.

Tablets similarly inscribed have also been recovered from a mound west of Somingyi pagoda. INSCRIPTION AT SHE]ZIG6N The same title, SrY Tribhuvanadityapavaradhammara-jca, occurs in the four-line Old Mon inscription9 written at the base of the four faces of the second pillar of Kyanzittha's great inscription at Shwezigon. This short inscription is not dated. It merely records large gifts by the king to Jeyabhuth pagoda, of land at Marhak, Poktaw, Taksiy, MrY,10 etc. The first three of these places, at any rate, were in central Kyaukse. The inscription itself is in Old Mon, with one peculiarity of spelling: get for kit "and", and gyek for kyek or kyak "pagoda".11 Written by a king in Mon, there can be no doubt but this dedication was the work of Cafisfi I. REGNAL DATES A fragmentary Burmese inscription, oldish but not original, of which only a small piece now remains in Mandalay Palace collection, was a little fuller when first published in I9I312. It mentions a northern tour made by king Ca&amp;sii: he went up the east bank of the M4 river (then the abode of the Saw Kantsf, a tribe of the Kadu), and returned by the west bank. He dammed a big lake east of Hahsd (? Halin) ;13 and there is mention of Mranse khloh, "Dead Horse stream." The date is given as 5I3 s., roughly II5I A.D., when "the king was 63 years old, and had reigned for 37 years". - If this is trustworthy, Caiisii I was born about 450 s./Io88 A.D., and ascended the throne about 476 s./III4 A.D. Balancing this against Rajakumdr's inscription, which gives III2 A.D. as the approximate date of Kyanzittha's mortal illness, we cannot be far wrong if we date Cafisfl I's accession in III3 A.D. An original Burmese inscription of unknown provenance (possibly E. Meiktila), now at Mandalay Palace4 mentions a dedication in 507 s./c. II45 A.D., "when the king's age was 56". But the reading, 7P1. 8 c. Her tablets resemble, but are not the same as those of Aniruddha (P1. 8 a, b). 8 P1. i8.

Poktaw (Pauktaw, a Burmese name, 'Jungle of Butea frondosa trees') was in Mraikhhuntuhi kharuin (see L B., P1. II 18512; III 23436). Taksiy (Tetthe) was in Mlacsd kharuin (I.B., P1. I 639 etc.). I am not sure where Mrf was: it is mentioned elsewhere in connection with TammlhyaA (I.B., P1. III 23411w 20, 23). 11 Cf. gydk for kydk at P1. 22 c. This weakening of distinction between initial sonant and surd is a most important phonetic change in Mon-Khmer languages. 12List 73 (A 28, S.I.P., p. I3), two-faced fragment, Mandalay Palace Shed Stone 50 (obv.), dated 513 s./II5I A.D. There is a fragmentary reverse, not shown in the books, similar in hand to the obverse. It has the date 538 s./I176 A.D., which should fall near the beginning of Canisui II's reign. It begins by giving the boundaries of the kingdom: - to the E., Samkthon ...... (to the S.), up to Taluinsare, Tawai, Muttama (Tenasserim, Tavoy, Martaban). To the N. or W., the "big-eared Kantui and Klwan pa(n)" are mentioned (cf. supra, ch. II, n. iI6). The inscription may date perhaps from the Early Ava Period. 13 A khyatra (resident landowner) of Hansa, who was also a judge (sahphama), is mentioned in an early undated inscription (I.B., P1. I 9 b8). Duroiselle mentions Haiasavati and Hamhsanagara as classical names for Halin (Old Burm. Hanlait), the 8th-9th cent. Pyu capital (A.S.I. I930, p. I52). The name suits Halin better than Pegu, for wild geese and ruddy shelduck (Burm. hamsa) are regular visitants of northern Burma (B.E. Smythies, The Birds of Burma, 1940 ed., p. 548). 14 I.B., P1. II II31, Mandalay Palace Shed Stone 3.</page><page sequence="103">Chapter V 85 56, is very doubtful. If correct, it would place his birth about i089 A.D. This agrees pretty well with the fragment mentioned above, where the birthdate would fall about io88; and both would fit in with the view suggested in previous chapters, that Cafisfi I was son of Kyanzittha's daughter and the Mon prince, betrothed at the time of Kyanzittha's accession in i084. The date of Cafis-d I's death is much more open to question. He is always credited with a long life. The Jfd dtat Rdjavai - the least unreliable of the late Chronicles where early dates are concerned - gives 529 S. (c. ii67 A.D.) as the date of his death.15 The Glass Palace Chronicle (pp. I28, I32) agrees. But this, as we shall see later, cannot be right. For his successor, the builder of the vast temple Dhammayangyi, died in 1165. Cafisfi I was alive and active, it seems, as late as II5I. His death, we may guess, took place before ii60 A.D. SHWEGU-GYI PALI/SANSKRIT INSCRIPTION, II3I A.D. What little we know of him personally, is best gathered from Shwegu-gyi inscription.,l This is engraved on two stone slabs let into the walls of Shwdgu (Old Burm. Rhuykii, "Golden Cave"), a small but splendid temple (Pls. 368-375) in Early Burmese style, built by the king within the walls of Paga'n, on the west side of his grandfather's palace. It was built in i053 M.S. (II3I A.D.), in 7i months: begun on Sunday the 4th waning of Vai~Akha (Kason, say April), and finished on Wednesday the iith waning of Marga?iras (Nadaw, say November). The dates are given in Sanskrit at the end of the second slab, according to the original iaka era (dating from 78 A.D.), an era not used elsewhere in Paga'n in- scriptions. The rest of this inscription is in Pali verse, a cunning patchwork of lines taken passim from the Tipitaka, which probably indicates the already high level of Pali scholarship at Paga'n. It is true that the script, the shape of the characters engraved, may lead to the conclusion that in its present form it is not original, but dates from the Early Ava period, say the latter half of the I4th century. But there is no reason to doubt that it is a faithful copy of the original, as set up in Cafisui I's reign. The poem consists of ioo verses, mostly in the vatta metre of 4 eight-syllable lines; varied at inter- vals by the vamsa.tthd metre of 4 twelve-syllable lines, and the vasantatilakd metre of 4 fourteen- syllable lines. It begins with the praise of Gotama Buddha (2I verses). Here is an extract: - "For thirty years save one In home he dwelt, the Lord of Glory. Thence He went a monk, resolved. In his desire For highest wisdom he put forth his strength In hard ascetic practices. He sate, Tathagata, beneath the Goatherd Tree, And breaking fast went tow'rd Neranijara. 15 JtdtOputh rdjavanz, P. 40, No. 45. 16 I.B., P1. I I, 2. See J.B.R.S.

He sate Beneath the king of trees, the Lord of Men, Nor trembled, fearless as a lion maned 'Fore Mdra and his hosts; whose engines fell He brake, affrighting them. Victorious, calm, And rapt in contemplation, all that night's Three watches, He, the keen-ey'd Hero, scanned The lore of former births and sights occult: Then comprehended, in the latest watch, Backward and forward, all the Causal Chain (O glorious Sage!) and knew Omniscience, Divinest knowledge, Buddhahood! Thereby First rose the name of Buddha. There enthroned Seven days he tarried, voicing prophecy Inspired, the Light-giver, all duties done, All fever cooled, and free from poison-flux, In rapture jubilant, meditating weal." The poet then describes the Paga'n king (9 verses): - "There was a king most wise, the lord of men, Who loved the hearing of good Law; his name Tibhuvanadiccapavaradhammaraj a. This just and righteous ruler of the land Bethought him: 'Rarely, rarely in this world Are Buddhas born; and to be born a man Is hard, and hard to hear the Buddha's Law!' So truly wise with best intelligence He ordered: 'Make a pleasing lovely room, A fragrant chamber for the mighty Seer, Gotama Buddha. On a platform high Exalt it, and adorn with cetiyas And images of spirits.' This great king, Abode of virtue, ordered to be made (Most like the noble Buddha while he lived) An image glorious-wonderful and fair Of the world's Lord, the Teacher, whose five eyes Were without stain - so purely wise was He.</page><page sequence="105">Chapter V 87 Thereafter the three peerless Pitakas He copied; clad the monks with many a set Of triple robes; and with his royal hands, What time the Cave was dedicated, fain, Serenely fain, he fed; then cried aloud, In strong desire for Buddhahood, this prayer ... The prayer fills 70 verses, and includes the following passages: - "In virtue sure as earth, in fixity As Himavd, in wisdom as the heaven, Unfettered as the wind, our Lord is purged Of poison-flux and sinless. Far beyond All doubt emerging, all his karma done, From Longing, all attachment quenched, set free. He tameth others, for himself is tamed; He calmeth others, for himself is calm; Quencheth and comforteth mankind. The wise Lean on him as a prop, and they who seek Happiness, find their benefit in Him.... "As when a fisherman with subtil net Encompasseth a water, all things found Within that water needs must enter in: So divers heretics, ill-doers, who leapt Into the clutch of heresy, beguiled By specious handling, were encompassed round With the pure Buddha-vision and clean eyes, And might not pass beyond. That vision sure Whereby he reached the height of wisdom, hemmed And held the heretics. All living things, Egg-born or vapour-born or aqueous, ghosts, Crows, and all winged fowl which cross the sky, All things, both conscious and unconscious, passed Within that net, within that wisdom plunged. The world of spirits and our world had leapt To night and error: but that Wisdom shone, And night is scattered. As the rising sun Dispelleth darkness ever, so doth He, Our Best, the Buddha, Teacher, Charioteer, Tamer of men, by men and spirits adored. ...

Ay, myself Tamed, I would tame the wilful; comforted, Comfort the timid; wakened, wake the asleep; Cooled, cool the burning; freed, set free the bound.

"May I be alway conscious and aware Of kindness done me! Union of ill friends Be far from me! Beholding the distress, Birth-born distress of men and deathless gods, I would put forth mine energies and save Men, spirits, gods, from seas of endless change! . Such was the mind, very likely of the king himself, at any rate of one of his counsellors. One may search the long account (largely folktale) of Alaungsithu's reign in the Chronicles, and find no hint of the ardour and the depth of heart and spirit here displayed, which stirred the souls of Burmans at the most creative moment of their history. BATTLE AT TONPLUN, 1111 A.D. ( ?) There is a dearth of original inscriptions during this long reign, and indeed down to the accession of Cai~si II in 1174 A.D. References to the earlier period (there are not many) usually occur in late</page><page sequence="107">Chapter V 89 inscriptions, not always reliable. The Hl'dauk inscription', for instance, which we have mentioned more than once: - " ... The beloved grandson of TPiluiA-asyaA Kalan-cacsd Ma-uih [for Man-ui] -khyaitsd Satawrhaii, together with his ministers and followers, and military officers of the Left and the Right, went to attack the Tarutk army. At that time, at the place called Tonplun, he set up two mat'aw (stupas). He had just built one when the Taruk army came up. And he conquered and wiped out the Taruk army, and the son of the Taruk general also was killed. Thereupon, at the place called Tonprv, for the one remaining mat'aw he added and made a great cave-temple, and set up also a great Bud- dha" . . . The date given is 473S./IIII A.D.: but later in the inscription18 there are mentions of king Turiukple and king Trydphya: so the final date (now lost) was clearly two to three hundred years after Kyanzit- tha's reign. Moreover, the term Taruk (which I take to be 'Turk')19, appropriate in the name Turukple (Tarukpliy) for the king who in i284 fled from the Turko-Mongol armies, is not applicable to the IIII A.D. invaders, who were probably Lolos from Nan-chao. TUINKHET DEDICATIONS, II40 A.D. Another post-Paga'n inscription which tells us something about Caftsfi I, is the reverse of the Taingchut inscription20. The small Burmese temple now called 'Taingchut' stands just outside, to the east of, the Tharaba Gate, north of the Ananda monastery. On the obverse2l, dated 54I s./II79 A.D., the temple is called Tuiikhet22. By 706 s./I345 A.D., when the reverse was written, the name was already corrupted to Tuinkhywat23, 'Taingchut'. This latter face records a series of buildings and dedications made at the site in 50I-2 S./II40 A.D., "while the king was staying at Klok kan," 'the stone tank.' The donors were (i) Arimat's son, Na Puil San, and the king; (ii) Cafisfi mankrl's queen, Ratandpmwi; (iii) Caflsfi mankrf's kwa'ntausan, 'lady of the royal betel', 'Im Bhun San; (iv) 'Im Pwan San; (v) Cau Manlha (clearly a princess) and the imsfikri (mayor of the palace?, doubtless her husband) Samantasfi. BURMANS SPREAD NORTH, AND WEST OF THE IRAWADY The rice-fields dedicated were at Maiklaniyun; Muchuiwphuiw tuik (Shwebo); Muchuiwkhrum tuik (M6ks6gydn, S.E. of Shwebo); KwankataA village (E. of Shwebo, N. of M6ksogyan); Hanlan tuik (Halingyi), S. of Raykhyai village, where a canal (mroo) is mentioned; also in Raisd tuik (N. of 17 List 50 a, lines i-6 (A i9, S.I.P., pp. 4-5). 473 SfII11 A.D.

All this, added to the 5I3 s. fragment quoted above, points to the fact that during this reign colonization was active in Sundparanta, W. of the Irawady, on both banks of the Mu, and around Shwebo. Fields were also dedicated, on a smaller scale, in the kharuin areas: at CalaA (Salin, N. of Minbu); and at Makhard, Nalailpup, Panlai, Khaimlhqi and Warahtut in the Eleven kharuin (Kyaukse). Under the final date, 706 S./I345 A.D., Khaklu* tuik is also mentioned. Some of these last-named lands are defined by reference to certain "saupyaA's registers." - Whenever in old inscriptions one finds references to land in sathpyaA's registers, they refer, always it seems, to rice-fields in Kyaukse, the chief granary of Central Burma. Clearly the Eleven kharuin had already a far more elaborate system of land-organization then the tuik areas. Shw6bo, in Sundparanta, though a rich, rice-growing region, with canals, is always a tuik area, never a kharuin. SINGHALESE (?) MAIDS OF HONOUR In a genuine Pagan inscription2 we read finally of two "golden concubines" (monma rhuy san-) of the future Buddha RhItyk~itayakd, "darling (khyat ma) Miy' San and darling Ray San." The former, as we read in another inscription26, was "Lady of the Royal Fan" (yap tcw sai): she died at a great age in 576 S./I2I4 A.D. These ladies were sisters, possibly of Singhalese origin27, as we shall see. SHWEGU-GYI AND THATBYINNYU TEMPLES (EARLY BURMESE) For the rest, our surest knowledge of Cafisfi I will derive from study of the two great temples he built within the walls of Pagan: the Shwegu (II3I A.D.) and the Thatbyinnyu (Sabbainu, 'the Omniscient')28. These temples, among the grandest in the whole of Burma, will be described in Chapter XX. They are the masterpieces of the Transitional or Early Burmese style. THE 'ALAUNGSITHU 'LEGEND AND ODYSSEY. CONFUSION WITH 'NARAPATISITHU I have left till last consideration of the Alaungsithu legend as told in the Chronicles29. Is it worth considering? It is open to the criticism made already about the folklore fable of Kyanzittha's infancy (see pp. 42, 43), that of being false in style, pseudo-archaic, with a king childish, querulous and brazen. There is also confusion of authorities as to which was the king in question. The Glass Palace Chronicle30, perhaps rightly (but the whole legend invites scepticism), reserves the sea-journey for Cafisfl I; and allows land-journeys to both Cafisil I and Cafisfi II. To Cafisi I it assigns the five sarakkhan sandalwood offel ings, the Shinbyu and Shinlha images given by Indra, and the sankanak (or sahkhanak) boat given by the king of Ceylon, "which held eight hundred thousand men"; to Caisii II31 it assigns 24 Several of these names are confirmed by the Dhammarajaka inscriptions of Cafisfi II, 560 s./I i98 A.D.: Pichai tuik, Muchuiwphuiw tuik, Rathsd tuik, Muchuiwkhrum tuik, Khaklumh tuik (I.B., P1. I 20, lines 14-2i). For Fatisa, see also L B., P1. I 1213, 3I9. 25 I.B., P1. II 14511, Paga'n Museum Stone 63, 604 S./1242-3 A.D. 26 I.B., P1.

As a rough general rule for distinguishing Cafisfi I (Alaungsithu) and Cainsui II (Narapatisithu) in inscriptions, first note the dates. If the event took place between 475 and 522 s./II13 and ii6o A.D., it should refer to Cafisui I; if between 536 and 573 s./1174 and 1211 A.D., to Cafisui II. If any old writing is found at the site, note the script and the language. If it is Old Mon, it is the work of Canisui I; if Old Burmese, probably that of Canisui II. If the work of merit is a temple with corbelled arching, not radiating voussoirs, one may rule it out as post-Pagdn. 31 Hmannan, I, pp. 325, 333 (transl. G.P.C., pp. 141-2, 148).</page><page sequence="109">Chapter V 9I the temples built to enshrine the nine images carved out of the prow of the boat, and also the five "pagodas of beauty". If Aniruddha and Kyanzittha conquered, as seems certain, the whole of Tenasserim down to, and beyond, the Isthmus of Kra, the next step would naturally be to build a fleet to control and protect the trade-route across the Isthmus. So a sea-journey of reconnaissance by Cafisii I is not in itself im- probable. For Cafisfi II it would be less likely: for in the interval, in 1165 A.D., control of the Isthmus was wrested from Burma by the Ceylon armada of Pardkrama-bdhu I. The odyssey attributed to Cafisfl I was, briefly, as follows: - (i) He goes south to "the Talaing country" and descends the Kre:loh: stream to Bassein: i.e. the Nga Wun or Bassein river, which takes off from the main river above Henzada, and forms the most westerly mouth of the Irawady. (ii) At Cape Negrais, the extreme end of the ridge running south from Paga'n Tankyidaung, along the west bank of the Irawady, he observes "the glass image of the Naga king." (iii) First, it seems, he sails to Bengal (? Chittagong), where Aniruddha had left stone figures of musicians (see G.P.C., pp. 95-96), who come to life to greet him. (iv) He then sails to Ceylon, where the king offers him a daughter; an image "of Mahakassapa practising ascetic attitudes"; and the enormous boat. (v) He proceeds by this boat to the vast Jambu tree (Eugenia Rose-apple), "at the head of the Island" Jambudspa, the Southern Continent to which it gives its name. At the foot of it he sees the "rock-mat on which Buddhas have sat." He wishes to sit there himself, but finds it too dangerous. (vi) He is about to climb Mt. Meru, up to Thvatirisa, when Indra stops him, and, to console him, grants him divine anointment and a long title; also two images, 'Shinbyu' carved from the rock-mat, and 'Shinlha' from a branch of the Jambu tree; also six relics of the Buddha; and enough sarakkhan sandalwood for carving five images. (vii) On his way home he is about to fall into the Valabhcimukha32 whirlpool, when the king makes a solemn vow and the ocean goddess, Manimekhald, comes to his rescue. (viii) He visits Mallkyit island (Sumatra), where ManimekhalM again rescues the child of a Demon mother (bhih7:ma), who had fallen from her hand as she was watching the king. (The terms bhalYi: or raksa were especially applied to the early Malayan pirates. Raksapitra was the old name of Thaton.) (ix) He stops at the rock of "the white elephant Gandhilaraja33, which the king (of) Tagtfm rode." It had "died in the sky, and falling into the ocean, became a rock". Here Asoka's son, Mahinda, "was wont to walk to and fro." (x) He stops at Mdr-'oi! (Man-aung) island (Cheduba, off the coast of Arakan), and reads a lesson to its dead king, who had drowned himself sooner than pay homage. (xi) He visits Jambudzpa, and takes the tusks of an elephant in which a giant-scorpion lived. The scorpion swims after him, but failing to catch him, makes a boat-like gesture with its sting. 32 Called in Burmese Balavamukha, "the mighty mouth". Dr. Pe Maung Tin refers me to the Supparaka Jataka, No. 463, where the Valabhdmukha is the sixth and last of the strange seas crossed, after a solemn vow, by the blind pilot, on his way back to Bharukaccha. 13 For Gandharaja (?). Gandha was the name of a special family of elephants. "Each elephant" says Malalasekera (Dictionary of Pili Proper Names, I, p. 744) "has the strength of one million men." In the Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi there is a painting of smith cit Gandhram, "Gandhram, king of elephants" (see Bull. Burm. Hist. Com. II, p. 405, Gloss 224).</page><page sequence="110">92 Chapter V The land-journeys and works of merit they produced, are more credible. But here the confusion be- tween Cafisfi I and Cafisfi II darkens counsel. Many of the pagodas given below to Alaungsithu, are given, in district gazetteers and 'thamaings', to Narapatisithu. If dates permit, I generally follow the Hrnannan; for having decided that it was Alaungsithu who made the sea-voyage, it prudently awards him also the harvest of that voyage, and little besides. Local study and excavation alone may help us to the truth. All the pagodas listed below, are in Pakokku, Sagaing, Shwebo and Mandalay districts. They point to a steady advance northwards by the Burmans, especially across the river into Sundpa- ranta.

From Cafisti II's accession (536 S./II74 A.D.)40 there appears to have been a reaction against Mon styles at Paga'n. The last temple of 'Mon' type, the huge Dhammayan-gyi, was built by Cafisfi I's son, Kuld-kya, shortly before his death in ii65 A.D. It must have taken several years to build. That is why I have suggested that his father died not later than ii6o. If so, all the remaining 'Mon' temples, and some of the Transitional 'Early Burmese' temples should fall within this period. The first Early Burmese temple, Shwegu-gyi, can be dated exactly II3I A.D. Caiisfi I's next Early Burmese temple, the four-storeyed Thatbyinnyu, over 200 ft. high, registers such a bold advance in architectural skill, that it must, I think, date from near the end of his reign, c. II55 A.D. These then, in the absence of contemporary records, are my chief criteria for dating the following monuments. They are described at length in Chapter XIII (Stupas) or Chapters XVIII to XX (Temples). I. Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi temple of Rdjakumdr. C. III3 A.D. Pls. 335-350. See supra, p. 78, No. I4 (Ch. XVIII, pp. 373-383).41 2. Loka-hteikpan temple, N. of Shw6hsandaw. Of medium size, with 'Mon' paintings, and upper glosses in Mon, but lower glosses (the great majority) in archaic Burmese. Not later than II25 A.D. Pls. 35I-356 (Ch. XIX, pp. 384-388).42 3. Kyazin temple in its original form. It stands S. of Myinkaba village, N.NE. of Nagayon. The donor, Barrack, died in II25 A.D. Much of the E. side, including the three colossal images (Great Twin Miracle) and the Old Mon list of the 28 Buddhas, may well go back to this date (Ch. XIX, pp. 39I-397). 4. Alopyi' (Aluiw-plan-43) temple, Gu 228, S.E. of Htilominlo, on the north side of the inland road to Nyaung-u. 'Mon' temple with many paintings of Suttas, Buddhaisa, Vimdnavatthu, and Mahani- pdta Jctaka. All glosses in Mon. Pls. 357, 358 (Ch. XIX, pp. 388-39I). 5. Hpyatsa Shwegu 'Mon' temple and old-style stupa, W. of Myinpagan. Elaborate stucco-carving on inner torana. Jdtaka paintings with Mon glosses in the hall. Pls. 359-36i. (Ch. XIII, pp. 279-280; Ch. XIX, pp. 397-398). 39 Old Burm. Toiplun. I.B. I 348 (573 S./12II A.D.); 506 Toiblun (552 S./I 190 A.D.; 7436; 75 a40' 43, 46; 9811; III 24424 Toiplun kharuin nak Riypup arhiy rwd (636 S./I274 A.D.). 40 The accession-date of Cafisfi II rests on the evidence of the Minsawhla (for Cau Man Lha) pagoda-inscription at Khinmun, Sagaing district. The inscription has not been listed or edited. Its final date (744 s/I382 A.D.) on line i6 of the reverse, is over two centuries later. In line 8 of the obverse we read: - 11 sakarac 536 hhu ciysii maikrk rhuy ton tak pri - - - "In 536 s. king Ciysfi, after his accession to the throne - - -" There appears to be a listed copy of this inscription, List 715, "Sawminhla pagoda, Pagan," printed at B II 839.

The above five temples are all of 'Mon' type, but too ruinous to date with any precision. The source of ruin is nearly always the lean-to half-arch over the corridors, which could not stand up to earth- quakes as the full keystone voussoir could. The Old Burmans were quick to note this weakness, and to correct it. i6. Sein-nyet Ama temple and Sein-nyet Nyima stupa, south of Nagayon, on the east side of the road. Elaborate old-style stupa (Ch.

MISCELLANEOUS WRITTEN SOURCES Sung references to Pcu-kan - features of the Transition: languages, scripts, architecture, religion, etc. - votive tablets: Sanskrit, Pali, Pyu, Mon, Burmese - Chitsag6n trove (Sumedha, Muggaliputta) - inscriptions: Sanskrit, Pali, Pyu - Mon glosses and inscriptions - four dated, two undated, Burmese inscriptions - A]jwlat. SUNG REFERENCES TO P'U-KAN Aggression from the north has always been, during the historic period, the chief menace to Burma's civilizations. Since 'Ta-li kingdom', the weakened relict of Nan-chao, was still master of western Yiin- nan, the Chinese of the Sung dynasties (960-I278 A.D.) knew little of the Burmans. The Chinese name for them, Mien, does not appear (I think) before the coming of the Mongols and the Yuan dynasty. This was fortunate for Pagan, and allowed its brief but brilliant efflorescence. Pagan's embassies to Sung China, in I004 and Iio6 A.D., have been mentioned already (pp. 8, 58). The Lingwai-tai-ta of Chou Ch'fi-fei (II78 A.D.)1 gives the following account of 'P'tt-kan kingdom': - "From Ta-li kingdom in 5 stages2 one reaches this kingdom. From Wa-li kingdom3 in 6o stages one reaches it. Being cut off by the flowing mud of the Black Water4, the various kingdoms of the West [India] are unable to communicate with it. The king and officials of P'u-kan kingdom all wear on their heads caps shaped like the rhinoceros horn. They have horses, but ride them without a saddle. The king's residence has tiles made of tin. Gold and silver are used for the interior decoration of rooms and partition-walls. They have several tens of Buddhist monasteries. The monks all wear yellow robes. When the king holds his morning audience, each official holds a flower to offer to the king. The monks make a speech in Sanskrit/Pali praying that he may live long. Some flowers are taken for the king to wear on his head. The rest are taken back to the monasteries and offered to the Buddha. 1 "An officer at Kuei-lin in the 12th century." The work "contains a large amount of detail respecting the geo- graphy and inhabitants of the two Kuang provinces, and also the regions beyond, summary outlines being given regarding many Asiatic kingdoms, extending even to the far west." (A. Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, i867, p. 45). For the account of Pagan, see ch. 2, f. ii ro-v0. 2 The number of stages is obviously too small. Mr. Chen Yi-Sein (our learned Chinese Reader to the Burma Historical Commission) points out to me that the section on Pcu-kan in Ku Tsu-yii's Tu-shih-tang-yii-chi-yao (i667 A.D.; ch. ii9) begins as follows: - "The Gazetteer (chih) says that, north-east of the city, it is 5 day-stages to An-cheng-kuo [Nga Singu, N. of Mandalay district], and over 50 day-stages to Ta-li". 3 Wa-li kingdom is mentioned again in the section on Chen-la (ch. 2, f. ii ro), as adjacent to Chen-la (Cambodia). The Chu-fan-chih of Chao Ju-kua (I225 A.D.) includes it among the I2 or I3 states dependent on Chen-la. 4 Fan Ch'o, in the Man-shu (ch. 2, f. 4 vo - transl. p. 20), appears to identify the legendary Hei Shui, "Black Water", of the Yii-kung chapter of the Shu-ching, with the Irawady (Li Shui). Here, perhaps, the identification is rather with the Chindwin (Mi-no Chiang) and its sources in the Hukong Valley; beyond which, on the route from the Pyu capital to Manipur and India, Chia Tan places the Hei Shan, 'Black Mountains': see Hsin-t'ang-shu, ch. 43 (Asia).</page><page sequence="114">96 Chapter VI "In the 5th year of the chAung-ning period of Hui Tsung, 2nd month [March 8th-April 5th, iio6], they came to Court with tribute." In the following chapter5, "Roads communicating with the outer barbarians", an itinerary is given from Yung-chou to Ta-li. It continues: - "From Ta-li kingdom, in 5 stages one reaches P'u-kan kingdom, which is not far distant from the West (and) India. But one is stopped by a river of flowing mud; so there are no communications. Possibly, indeed, one might communicate; but it is extremely dangerous." As for Wa-li kingdom, we read that it was adjacent to Chen-la kingdom (Cambodia). Paga'n's connections with the Colas in Kyanzittha's reign are borne out by the following remark in the section on 'Chu-nien kingdom'6: - "Chu-nien kingdom is South India in the west. If one wants to go to this kingdom, one should transship from Ku-in kingdom7 [Quilon]. Some say one can also go there from P'u-kan kingdom." The Chu-fan-chih of Chao Ju-kua (I225 A.D.) adds the following details: - "P'u-kan kingdom8. - The officials and common people all bunch their hair on the forehead, and tie it with coloured silk. Only the lord of the land is distinguished by a golden cap. The kingdom has lots of horses, which they ride without a saddle. It is their custom to reverence the Buddha most devoutly. The monks all wear yellow robes ... In the kingdom there is a temple of the Warrior Marquis Chi- ko . . . "9 He continues with the account of the I004 embassy (see supra, p. 8) and ends, like Chou Ch'u-fei, with a mention of that of iio6 A.D. FEATURES OF THE TRANSITION: LANGUAGES The period III3 to II74 A.D. was a nimble and an eager age of transition. This is seen most obviously in language. Aniruddha had written in Sanskrit or Pali - in Sanskrit, perhaps, for dignity, in Pali for ease. Saw Lu wrote in Pali and (perhaps) Mon; Kyanzittha almost always in Mon. His son, Rdjakumdr, in III3 A.D. wrote in four languages: Pali, Pyu, Mon and Burmese, but normally in Mon. The grandson, Cafisfl I, wrote in Pali, with dates and epilogue in Sanskrit, and once (at least) in Mon. In his reign and his successor's, Burmese inscriptions begin to appear; some undated ones may well go back to Kyanzit- tha's reign, or even earlier. From Caiisfl II onwards Burmese triumphs. Pyu practically disappears. Mon almost disappears, from Pagan at any rate. Sanskrit is confined to a few scholars, and Pali mostly to monks. SCRIPTS All these were ultimately derived from India, and were written, like Brdhmi, from left to right. But there were big variations. The Pyu script of 7th century gri Ksetra, based on North Canarese in Western India, just survived into the Paga'n period. Meantime more than one type of North Indian Ndgari had spread from Pdla Bihar and Bengal to Arakan, and was at first regularly stamped on the 5 Ling-wai-tai-ta ch. 3, f. 9 vo. Yung-chou was the old name for Nan-ning in Kuang-hsi. 6 ibid., ch. 2, f. I3 V0. 7There is a section on Ku-uin kingdom, ch. 2, f. I3 ro-v0. 8 Chu-fan-chih ch. A, pp. io-ii. Transl. F. Hirth and W. W.

Very different from both, the 'Mon' script which ultimately triumphed, had come, it seems, from South India (? Kaficipura) via Dvaravati and the Gulf of Siam. ARCHITECTURE In architecture (as we shall see in later chapters), though the 'Mon' style is dominant down to Kyanzittha's death, and is seen as late as Dhammdra*t temple (c. ii6o A.D.), already in Cafisf I's reign (from II3I onwards) the Early Burmese style revealed its dazzling dawn. RELIGION In religion the change was greatest, and the most far-reaching. Started, almost unconsciously, by Aniruddha in his search for genuine Buddhist texts, it climaxed, under Kyanzittha, with a gradual but final passage from the Thntric Mahdydnism of Bengal to Singhalese Theravdda, based on the closed Canon of the Mahdvihdra. Other changes, more difficult to trace on the evidence available, were also doubtless proceeding in society, government and education. Flux everywhere, but not confusion. Direction there was, if still no conscious sense of it. External events and influences played their part. Of Mon culture, with all its poetry and beauty, the Old Burman had absorbed as much as he was able. Indian influence and ex- ample were to be seen everywhere, almost always beneficent. It is surely one of the chief glories of Indian culture that invariably it gave life, not death, to other cultures. And Buddhism - in its first impact a very midwife to a people's soul - was hard at work, bringing to the birth, informing and inspiring. Beyond all this, one feels, Nature was leading the leaders, unconscious, to their destiny. National character was being formed. There was little copying, it seems, of things Indian. Old Burmese in- scriptions are nearer to those on Chou bronzes than to any Indian pras'asti. And the Old Burman's mind was large enough to take the gifts of Mon and Indian, and add enough to make the product personal and original. Each pioneer writer, struggling to express Burmese in a script half useless to him, and lacking half of what he wanted, showed a style of his own, both in matter, spelling and calligraphy. These early inscriptions are a joy to the eye as well as to the mind. Too soon uniformity will come and eccentricity be ironed out, with spelling standardised and script flattened and deadened. For the moment everything is burstingly alive. VOTIVE TABLETS: SANSKRIT Of such a thrilling moment of birth and awakening, it is sad that the extant record is so meagre. If we exclude Thaton, dated stone inscriptions of the Pagan kingdom begin with Kyanzittha's first Mon inscription at Prome, on June 3rd I093 A.D. But terracotta votive tablets which, with the vaulted chapels, form a 'bridge' between the cultures of gri Ksetra and Pagan, are often inscribed, and are indeed among Burma's oldest epigraphic monuments. The art of making votive tablets came to Burma in the 7th century from early Pdla Bengal. In shape, votive tablets of early Pagan are usually squared at the base, and arch to a point at the top. Often they are oval or fig-leaf in shape. But the stamped oval or fig-leaf may also fit into deep</page><page sequence="116">98 Chapter VI squared rims below, arching above - a type popular at Tagaung (Pls. 49, 56). This allowed the image to stand upright in its own small shrine, for private worship. There is, indeed, an intimacy about the writings found on many of these clay tablets which distinguish them from the stone inscriptions. At first, no doubt, the only writing allowed was the Buddhist 'Credo', stamped in high relief on the ob- verse, below the throne or lotus-seat. The language was Sanskrit, and the script Ndgarl. Rarely it was stamped at the top of the tablet (PI. 53 c), or, if space was insufficient, spread up the sides (Pls. 7, 54 c). Several types of Nagarl script were employed. One very fine square type occurs on only three sorts of tablet: Aniruddha's Seinnyet tablets (PI. 6 a, b); Mahdsalini's Eight Scene tablets (P1. 71); and the heavily ornate tablets of Prince Vallabh = Yasa (PI. 38 a, b, c). Mahdsdlini's tablets are found with others signed by Aniruddha showing 3I figures (Pls. IO, ii). And other tablets of "Prince Yas" are found with those of Aniruddha (PI. 23 b, c). So it seems that this fine Nagarl writing in high relief belongs especially to Aniruddha's court. Another type of "compressed Ndgarl" in high relief, trouble- some to read, occurs on Aniruddha's io-Buddha tablets (PI. 9); the compression was doubtless due to lack of space. The high relief exposed these letters to surface-damage; and they were often written so small as to be soon illegible. The Sanskrit tended to get mixed with Pali, which, though not so venerable, was better understood at Paga'n. And soon, when additional matter of local interest was added, the local language (Pyu, Mon, Burmese) and the local script (Pyu or Mon) began to invade the back, under-rim, or side-rims of the obverse, and finally the place of honour there, hitherto reserved for NMgarl. On Aniruddha's 50-Buddha tablets (Pls. i2, I3), the line in high relief at the base is in Nagarl script, but the language (apart from srf, and om at the beginning) is Pali. The transition is clearliest seen in Kvanzittha's so-Buddha plaques (Pls. i6, I7): half the line at the base is Sanskrit/Ndgarl, the other half Pali in Mon script. When one compares the high relief writing on Aniruddha's 5-figure tablets (PI. 8 a, b) with that on the very similar one of Kyanzittha's queen, Trilokavata~sakci (P1. 8 c), one sees that the former is normal Sanskrit/Ndgarl, the latter Pali/Mon. Apart from the Buddhist 'Credo', Aniruddha's Sanskrit prayers are varied: - "Thus saith Sri Anuruddhadeva" (P1. 6 a). "Om. This is the work of the monarch, Sri Aniruddhadeva" (PI. io a). "Om. This is the pious gift of the donor of truth" [? "donor of the mould"], "the great king Sri Anirud- dhadeva" (P1. 8 a). "By me, Aniruddhadeva, has been made this mould of the Blessed One. By this, may I obtain the path to Nirvana when Maitreya is fully enlightened" (P1. 6 c). His Pali is a single stereotype, first seen on his Khabin pagoda tablets (Pls. 4, 5): - "This Blessed One" (or sometimes "This Lokandtha", if the central figure is a Bodhisattva, P1. 7 b), "is made by the great king, Sir Aniruddhadeva, with his own hands, for the sake of Deliverance" - a formula followed, mutatis mutandis, by his son Sirs Bajrdbharana (PI. I5 c), by Queen Trilokavatamsaka (P1. 8 c), and others. Kyanzittha prays for Buddhahood (Pls. i6 d, I7 c). His grandson, 0Pavarao, below the first ioo- Buddha tablet, merely claims to be the donor (P1. i8 a); his chaplain, Dhammarajapa11ita, aftermaking "athousand Buddha-image(s)," adds a finely engraved prayer forDeliverance (PI. i8 c). Kula-kya, 0Varao "lord of the Quarters" (disa1pati), makes his image of a hundred Buddhas "in order to attain perfect Buddhahood" (P1. i9 b, d). Ci'peh, who writes in Mon or Pali, was chief queen (ranio mahesT) - of which king, we know not. Perhaps she was a Mon: one of her plaques (P1. 2i c) suggests Lower Burma. She made it "with her own hands". The only other royalty mentioned is "the wife of Rajaputta" (P1. 63 a).</page><page sequence="117">Chapter VI 99 VOTIVE TABLETS: PALI The simplest and most widespread Pali tablet (found at Pagan, Taungdwin-gyi, Alanmyo, and Hpowundaung) has merely, engraved on the back, namo Buddhdya, "Honour to the Buddha" (P1. 58) - an effective way of introducing villagers to an Indian script, to Pali, and to Buddhism. The com- monest users of Pali were naturally the monks (thera, bhikkhlu, or dcariya "teacher"). Of those who accompanied Rdjakumar in III2-I3 A.D. to his father's deathbed, "the teacher Muggaliputta created" several "images of the Buddha" (P1. 59 d, f) with the monk Silapd (P1. 59 e). Muggaliputta had a fine bold hand; and his plaque of the 5 Buddhas alternating with stupas, was original and beautiful (P1. 6i a. b, c). "The monk Sumedha", probably Rdjakumdr's Sumedha-pa1ndita, "like Nagasena" in the Milindapafiha, "takes keen delight in learning. Making with his own hands the thousand Buddhas" [of Chitsagon], he prays to win Deliverance and become a Buddha (P1. 5i d). As a co-pioneer with Rajakumdr in writing Old Burmese, he must be remembered with honour. "The monk Rathapd" and "the teacher inanda created images of the Buddha," also at Chitsagon - short, plump figures quite different from those of Aniruddha (P1. 40 a, b, c, d). The thera Ananda, perhaps a different monk, has left two tablets, one of the 40 (?) Buddhas (P1. 68 b), and another of the Eight Scenes (P1. 74 b), similar to that of Mahasdlini (P1. 7I). These were found by U Htwe Sein N.E. of Upali Thein, together with the bronze cetiya Lotus (P1. 426) and an andagu slab of the Eight Scenes (P1. 404) - a notable contri- bution to Paga'n religious art. "The teacher Sangradeva" (or Sangradiva), on several heavily ornate tablets, prays that "his image of the highest Conqueror may be a means to attain Omniscience" (P1. 38 e, f). Another heavily ornate tablet, now in the 'tr6sor' of Pegu Shwehsandaw pagoda platform, was "made by the monk Abhirfipa, with his own hands, in the hope of release from sansara" (P1. 37 b). High civil officials (sambeit) were also apt to use Pali. The samben Jesalya (P1. 57 b, c) adopts Aniruddha's stereotype. "The sambeii, Prince (man) Yasa, favourite (vallabha) of the king" (probably Aniruddha), made his ornate Pwazaw plaque, with the fine Nagari stamp, "in his longing for excellent Omniscience. May the worlds of men and gods take note!" (P1. 38 a, b, c). Yasa wrote in Pali or Mon (P1. 23 c, d, e), and sometimes mixed them (P1. 64 b); but he had the Burmese title (man) as well as the Mon (trap). Several tablets of "the 28 Buddhas" (a.tthavfsati Buddha) - the number of figures shown may vary from 28 to 3I - were made by "the king's minister, the sambeA Pintfi" (P1. 65 f), and the nameless "Law-sambeA or Judge, triyd samben" (P1. 65 a, b, c). These omit the two Bodhisattvas who flank the Buddha on Aniruddha's plaques (Pls. 8 a, io a), and persist even in those of Kyanzittha's queen, mother of RMjakumar (P1. 8 c). The Judge's Pali inscriptions are varied: - "These 28 Buddhas were made by me, the Law-sambeA, in the hope of attaining Buddhahood" (P1. 65 a). "This image of the 28 Buddhas was made by me the donor, the Law-sambeA. It is made for the benefit of king, mother, father, together with sons, daughters, wives and all living beings. (May I be) a Buddha in the world to come!" (P1. 65 b). "The maker of this image of the 28 Buddhas - I, the donor, the Law-sambeA, have made it for the merit of king, mother and father. By means of this good work, may all living beings be freed from the immeasurable evils of existence! May I be a Buddha hereafter!" (P1. 65 c). - These names, at the moment, are little more than names. But if and when excavations continue, some, at least, are likely to recur. Meantime what little we know, should be placed on record. VOTIVE TABLETS: PYU Only two kinds of tablet with Pyu writing have as yet been found at Pagan. The chief one (P1. 34 c, d) comes from the relic-chamber of Shwehsandaw, built c. io6o A.D. by Aniruddha. The reverse shows 7.</page><page sequence="118">Ioo Chapter VI 6 clear lines of Pyu. "This Blessed One" it begins. The donor, SrT Band, is mentioned in line 3. He prays, it seems, that he may reach Omniscience (?) in the presence of Metriya. The other tablets (P1. 55 a, b, c) have been found at three sites: at Kyazin temple S.E. of Myinpagan; at a get W. of Sin'pahto; and in "a mound near the riverbank, close to the south of Tawyakyaung monastery, west of Nanpaya". At the last site, a rather similar bronze plaque, without the Pyu writing, was also found (P1. 55 d). A duplicate of the terracottas is now at the Indian Museum, Calcutta (P1. 55 e). This type shows three seated figui es: in the centre a Buddha in abhayamidrd; an earth-touching Buddha on his right; the Bodhisattva Maitreya on his left. On the face of the pedestal below the central lotus-throne are 5 Pyu characters which Duroiselle reads: Budha mga: psu: khau. VOTIVE TABLETS: MON The commonest writing on these early Pagan tablets is in Mon. At Shin Mokti pagoda, 6 miles south of Tavoy'0 towards the mouth of its river, many old votive tablets have been found, with Mon writing of Kyanzittha's reign. One (PI. 20 c) reads as follows: - "This (image of the) Lord Buddha is stamped and dedicated by the sammben Anantajeyyabhikrdn who guards Tavoy (Daway), servant of our lord His Majesty Srih Tribhovanidityadhammardc", i.e. Kyanzittha. The first part of the Governor's name is not quite certain. Another (PI. 20 b), similarly worded, is offered by "the sumbei YaA=khT who guards Tavoy", etc. This name, too, is not quite certain. The writer concludes: - "When our lord becomes a Buddha, may I, his servant, become an Arahant, disciple of my lord!" Other tablets (PI. 20 d) found at the site have writing also in Old Mon, though the donors' names are Old Burmese: - "The kalan Pwoit ('Blossom') stamped this Buddha. (His) daughter, Phnn phleii" ('Fulfilling virtue'), "made the clay" (lit. earth). From Pagan Shwehsandaw relic-chamber, on the back of two 'seals of Aniruddha', are found brief writings in Mon: "This (tablet) was stamped by Lord (trap) Nawur" (P1. 22 b); "the Buddha (gyak) of Vrahmasin", sc. Brahmasena (P1. 22 c). From the same chamber, on the back of a tablet similar if not the same, is the Mon signature of Prince Y.asa (PI. 23 C): "The Buddha (kyak) stamped by Lord Prince Yas (trap main Yas)." His Mon writing appears again on the obverse of a 'figleaf' tablet of unknown provenance, below the lotus-throne: "Stamped by trIP man Yas" (PI. 23 d, e). On the back of another tablet of Aniruddha type (PI. 25 a, b), there is a prayer in Mon: "The precept (against) Adultery (?) - may I be ware of it! The precept (against) Stealing - may I be ware of it! The precept (against) Murder - may I be ware of it!" Also a fragment of Old Mon, ill spelt (PI. 25 d): "I want to be a Buddha!" 10 The earliest Burmese mention of Tavoy (Taway) occurs in the Dhammarajaka inscription of Cafisa II: I.B., P1. I I97, 558 s./i i96 A.D. The name occurs again in a fragmentary list of boundaries (Taluiisare, Tawai, Muttama; Tenasserim, Tavoy, Martaban) in an early Ava fragment: line 3 of the unprinted reverse of List 73, Mandalay Palace Shed Stone 50I, 538 s./I I76 A.D. It occurs again in an Amyint inscription, l.B., P1. IV 42322, 643 s./I28I A.D.: "from Pagan upstream as far as ARa Choi Khyamdz; from Sariy-paccary downstream as far as Taway." Taluihsare and Tawai are claimed again as the southern bounds of the kingdom by the Shan Asahkkhyd near the end of the dy- nasty (I.B., P1. III 276 a, 655 S./I293 A.D.). Note that the later series of Mokti pagoda tablets recently recovered by Col. Ba Shin, are in Burmese, dated 75I s./2[389 A.D., when Prefid Sini Dhammaryjd (? the Mon king Rajadhiraj) built the Shw6gu (Hruykfi). There is mention also of the dedication of "twenty families in the township of Tavoy city (?)," maui davayah (the reading is "extremely doubtful"), as slaves to a monastery at Mergui, in line 5 of the "Tai Inscription in the Museum at Pagan" (Stone 95), translated by Cham T6ngkamwan and Mr. A. B. Griswold in Artibus Asiae, Vol. XXIV, 3/4, pp. 249-250. The year-date is mostly lost. Mr. Griswold thinks that the in- scription, "because of its resemblances to those of Sukhodaya, should probably be dated in the I4th or early Isth century."</page><page sequence="119">Chapter VI I0I Two other tablets of Aniruddha type, provenance unknown (PI. 29 c, e), have fragmentary writing to the effect that they were "stamped by the suobeii Asak rhen- who desires Nirvana". Although this official writes in Mon. his title is Old Burmese - "Long Life". From Shwehsandaw relic-chamber come also two narrow tablets (P1. 52 c, d, e) with Mon signatures engraved down the back: - "This is the Buddha of the Reverend Lady SissA" - one of the numerous proofs of the existence of Buddhist nuns at Paga'n1. From Sha-htok pagoda W. of Somingyi, comes a series of Mon tablets of the Aniruddha type, clearly engraved on the back with the name of Lord (trap) or simbeit Srs Bisannarac (the name is variously spelt), "ruler of Visand" - a variant (I suppose) of Vessavana/Kuvera, one of the four Lokapila kings, Regent of the North. There are about a dozen variants (see Pls. 26, 27, 28), which may be summarized as follows: - "This is the Buddha stamped by the lord Sriy Bi'sana'rdc with his own hands, 20 (or 50) seals a day. Honour to the Buddha! As the result of the samben SrT Bisannardc stamping this Buddha, may he get to be a Buddha himself! He yields the merit to all living beings and the many Devas." Perhaps he asked his wife, son and chaplain to add their prayers; for in the same trove we find: - "As the result of Ydsohdardh stamping this Buddha, may she get to be a Buddha!" "This is the Buddha stamped by St'dhafnmdh. I yield the merit to my mother and father!" "This is the Buddha of the Reverend (trila) Candumdh." In the same pagoda, the bottom fragment of an "Eight-Scene" (really a Nine-Scene) tablet was found, with a Mon prayer on the reverse ending exactly like that of Yasohdarah. (Pi. 70 e, f). It is curious to note the association of early Mon writing with the Aniruddha type of Buddha-image, which seems to originate in East Bengal"2. Short Mon writings, often just the names of donors, are found on almost every type of tablet - single Buddhas, 3, 5, io and 30 figure tablets, and especially Eight-Scene plaques. These last were mostly found "at a small ruined pagoda near the Mingalazedi on the road to Myinkaba", which was opened by Duroiselle in I92613. He found there tablets of the 28 Buddhas (3I figures) signed by Aniruddha, and also many of these Eight-Scene plaques with Mon reverses, which at first he thought were signed by Aniruddha's queen; but, which later, when better specimens were found, proved to be the work of Mahdsalini. Aniruddha himself, so far as we know at present, never wrote in Mon; nor did he sign his name on any tablet of the Eight Scenes (were these too common and 'popular'?): but Mahdsdlini's tablets (PI. 7I), which set a new standard for the Eight Scenes at Pagaln, appear to have emanated from his Court. From an unknown site at Paga'n comes a very different tablet of the Eight Scenes (P1. 74 d, e, f), with a fragmentary Mon inscription starting on the obverse between the two lowest scenes (the Pdrileyyaka retreat and the Nativity), and continuing on the reverse. The final words, "I ... am the Lord", suggests that it described the birth of Gotama, ending with his 'Lion's Roar'. What was the range of the Mon language at this early date? To the East no doubt it was spoken everywhere in Siam, from Haripunijaya in the north to the old Dvaravatf in the south. On the Burma side we have found it at Dawdy (Tavoy) in the south; and it must have been strong in Kyaukse, 11 With ya trila Sisfn, cf. ya tirla, "the Reverend lady", in the Mon stone fragment found at the N.E. corner of the West Hpetleik (P1. 95 e). Is the name Sisfn a corruption of Isisingin, the 'horned hermit'? 12 Cf. N. K. Bhattasali, Iconography of Buddhist and Brahmanical Sculptures in the Dacca Museum (Dacca, I929), Plate IX a, "Plaque from Raghurampur." This seems to me close to our 'Aniruddha type.' 13 A.S.I. 1927, p. i69. See my note at the head of P1. 71 (Catalogue).</page><page sequence="120">I02 Chapter VI especially in the N.E. kharuin, Khabur or Mttn, with its Tanluiin rwd ma, "Main Talaing village."'4 At Nyaungbingan, three quarters of a mile west of Hsameiksh6, two miles south of Thazi, Meiktila district, a tablet has been found (PI. 35 c, d, e) with 4 clear lines of Mon incised on the back: - "The Buddha of the Law-sumbeit (rtyah sumbeit) Pin. As the good result (dais) of this Buddha, I desire to become a Buddha." In the same village, and at Hsameiksh6 near by, other plaques with archaic Burmese on the back were also found (Pls. 53 c, d; 66 e). At Ingan village, I2 miles south-east of Kyaukpadaung, about 40 miles south-east of Paga'n, a broken plaque has been found with Mon writing on the reverse (PI. 28 e, f). We do not know if Mon was current west of the Irawady. But it was certainly strong at Pagan and Prome; and an Old Mon brick inscription has been found on Kyfindaw island, Pran-tawsd klwan, the Old Burman's frontier-post in the south of Magw6 district (PI. 398 b). Three tablets with Mon writing have even been found at Bodhgayd. They are now at the Indian Museum, Calcutta. "This is the Buddha (kydk) of Mhddew" (Mahddeva), is written on the left side-rim of two of them (PI. 30 a, b). The third has fragmentary writing on the back: "This is the Buddha of Lord (?) . . . Sri ... Nirvana" (PI. 36 c, d). No doubt they were left by pilgrims. (Note that a pi ja4 (monk) Mahddev and his parents were dedicated by the Mon archbishop of Kyaukse as chief of the pagoda-slaves serving his baddhasim (Epig. Birm. IIT, L p. 7I; Inscr. XI, lines 8-9). VOTIVE TABLETS: BURMESE. CHITSAGON TROVE (SUMEDHA, MUGGALIPUTTA) Conventional as they mostly are, it is clear that these short writings on votive tablets - Pali, Pyu and Mon - are, or may be, of historical importance. They constitute one of the few reliable sources for the first half of the Pagan period. Few types of tablets with Burmese writing of this early period have been found'5, except for the trove at 'Chitsagon' - a mound in a dry field east of Nanda, south of Pagan-hmyaw temple. The finds are now mostly in Mandalay Archaeological Office. At 'Chitsagon', on the west side of a ruined temple, two standing bronzes (PI. 432) were first discovered in I925. Then, close by, a tablet with 8 lines of archaic Burmese written on the back (PI. 31), a prayer 'Hollywood' in tone: - "The boon I want is this: when I die, if born as a man, to be the object of all men's worship; if born as a spirit, to be the object of all spirits' worship. So often as I am born in Saitsdra, never to be born to a mean existence!" The author is not named. Excavations continued: and in November I926, on the opposite side of the temple, Duroiselle dis- covered the main trove: "... a hoard of terracotta tablets nearly a thousand in number." Amongst them, (according to Duroiselle's report)'6, were tablets signed by Muggaliputta and Sumedha, whom he naturally took to be two of the monks mentioned in RMjakumar's inscription (III2-I3 A.D.). Tablets of the main series are small, thin and rimless; with a faint line of Mon (?) stamped at the squared base of the conventional obverse (PI. 4i a); and a great variety of Burmese words (about the oldest specimens of the language extant) incised on the reverses. They mostly record the names of fruits, flowers, woods, etc. accompanying the offerings. Many are shown on PIs. 4i-48, with readings and renderings given in the Catalogue of Plates. Here I have received much generous help from U Wun, our leading Burmese lexicographer and poet. This is a brief list of the more probable identifications: - musk, asafoetida, cardamom, white cardamom, black mustard (Brassica), black cummin, sesamum, 14 See supra, Ch. II, p. 3I. 15 For other tablets with Old Burmese writing, see PI. 53 d (names of donors) and 66 e (prayer for Nirvana) - both found near Thazi, Meiktila district; PI. 66 g (prayer for Nirvana), from Myoma north of Prome; Pls. 67 a, 68 c (prayers for Buddhahood or Nirvana), from Pagan. 16 A.S.I.

Offerings to religion would be of rare, rather than ordinary commodities. Several names in the above list imply contact with the remoter parts of Burma, or with India and beyond. Cardamons and Sandal- wood came, originally at least, from the far south; Musk, Long Pepper and Black Mustard from the far north. To judge by their names, Palmyra, Sesamum and Gram have reached Burma via India. Asafoetida, Cummin, Grape and Pomegranate came especially from Iran. Several of U Wun's notes (see Catalogue of Plates) suggest to me that iith-century scholars at Pagan, such as Sumedha and Muggaliputta, were familiar with the Sanskrit Arnarakosa: one would like to add also the Pali Abhi- dhdnappadTpikd of Moggalldna of Ceylon: but Prof. Renou thinks that the latter - "the only Pali lexicon which has come down to us from the ancient period, written in verse, and strongly inspired by the Amarakosa," dates probably from the I2th century'7. Many of these offerings - mustard, areca-nut, myrobalan, fig, mango, Coix, rice, etc. - are quite common; and while allowance must be made for anthropomorphic notions - the offering of flowers, perfumes and delicacies to the Buddha as to a Cakravartin - can this apply equally to medicines, febrifuge (Morinda), vermicide (Ferula), anthelmintic (Em1belia), emmenagogue (Sesbania)? - If these tablets were found singly in different pagodas, one might argue that the donors, anxious about a sick wife or child, had consulted their local medicine-men: who now, as 'Buddhists', no longer allowed to prescribe sacrifice, would order instead some rare or common plant to be offered at the pagoda. But that argument cannot apply to miscellaneous mass-offering such as this. I suspect, rather, that the Chitsagon donation is a scholar's laborious collection - made in the course of intensive work on Indian texts, with all that that implies of constant tracing of equivalents in rare Burmese for Sanskrit and Pali technical terms encountered in translation. Besides the bare statement of things offered, several Chitsagon reverses add interesting prayer or comment, homely and suggestive of the naif optimism of the time, the firm belief that Buddhism, with the patronage of a king bound for Buddhahood, would bring in a Golden Age: - "I made this likeness of the Buddha myself. May my mother also get (the reward)." "This is for His Majesty the king. - Long Pepper." "By this, may all living creatures win complete release! May they get the Boon! - Bamboo Reed." "I give (the merit) to all spirits of the four aeons (?) of universes. Bamboo Reed. May they long reign in bliss!" "(The merit is) for kings (present) and future." "These many offerings are for His Majesty. - Citrus blossom." "This is Soap Acacia. When His Majesty the king of the Law becomes a Buddha, may he have everything pure!" "This is for the righteous king, the king of the Law. When 17 See L. Renou et J. Filliozat, L'Inde Classique (Paris, I953), t. II, ? I546, I549, pp. I00-I03. See also G. P. Malalasekera, Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol. I, p. I40. He, too, gives "the I2th century" as the date of the A bhidhanappadipika. One would like to have the dating checked; for if it was a new work just available when Burma monks were working in Ceylon c. I075 A.D., it would solve our problem very nicely. On the other hand, we cannot assume that Sumedha and his fellow-workers were ignorant of Sanskrit or the Amarakofa.</page><page sequence="122">I04 Chapter VI he becomes a Buddha, may all be saved with him! - This is Hermit's Bamboo-Reed."

INSCRIPTIONS: SANSKRIT, PALI, PYU Let us finally turn to the stone and other inscriptions previous to II74 A.D., not dealt with already. Sanskrit. - Nothing to add. We have only the numerous votive tablets with the Buddhist 'Credo' in Sanskrit/NMgarl, spread over the plains of Burma, with a few additions by Aniruddha and his son. Also 3 lines of Sanskrit date (II3I A.D.), in Mon script, at the end of the Pali verse inscription of the Shw6gu, built by Cafisfi I. Pali. - One text (2 faces) of Rdjakumdr's inscriptions (III3 A.D.); one long verse inscription of Cafisii I in the Shw6gu (II3I A.D.). Many writings on votive tablets, nearly all in Mon script, covering the whole period, and spread all over the plains of Burma. Pali passages also occur in several Thaton inscriptions, notably the 'Pandit' (I.B., PI. IV 359, lines i-i6); and in a few inscriptions edited in Epigraphia Birmanica'8. Pyu. - One text (2 faces) of Rajakumar's inscriptions (III3 A.D.); two votive tablets (Pls. 34, 55); and a line on the pedestal of a bronze Maitreya (PI. 444 a, b). All from Pagan. The bronze and one tablet from the Shwehsandaw relic-chamber. MON GLOSSES AND INSCRIPTIONS Mon. - The early Thaton and Kawgun inscriptions'9, and ten out of the eleven stone inscriptions edited by Blagden in Epigraphia Birmanica (Vol. I, Part II; Vol. III, Part I), have been dealt with already. Also one text (2 faces) of Rajakumdr's inscriptions (III3 A.D.). Also many votive tablets with Mon writing spread throughout the period. Mon writings are found in the eastern plains, from Kyaukse to Tenasserim; but also at Paga'n, Kyindaw island, and Prome along the Irawady; not to mention Bodhgayd in India. But there is still much to add: - (i) At the various pagodas and temples of Early Paga'n, there are short Mon glosses on hundreds of terracotta plaques20, and thousands of painted panels2' illustrating the Tipitaka. They would fill, I am sure, hundreds of printed pages; but their vocabulary is limited. These glosses will be considered 18 Epig. Birm. I, Part II, Inscr. I, Face A, lines i-iI (with Mon nissaya). Inscr. III, Face A, lines i-6 (mostly illegible); Face D, lines I5-I7. Inscr. VIII, Face B, lines I5-2I (fragmentary). 19 I.B., P1. IV 358, 359, 360. 20 389 plaques with Mon glosses illustrating the Mahanipdta Jdtaka, have been fully edited by C. Duroiselle, in Vol. II (Parts I and II) of Epigraphia Birmanica. 21 For the 724 Mon ink glosses below paintings in the Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi of Rajakumar, see Bulletin of the Burma Historical Commission, Vol. II, pp. 277-416.</page><page sequence="123">Chapter VI I05 in Part C of this book, under their respective pagodas. Among the earliest Mon glosses may possibly be those incised in plaster on the outside wall east of West Hpetleik, describing the later Jdtakas. Before io8o A.D. or thereabouts, illustrations are mostly confined to Jdtakas; but from the date of Pahtothamya onwards, they range wide over the Tipitaka, including the history of Buddhism as told in the Ceylon Mahavathsa. At first, apart from Pali titles, nearly all the glosses are in Mon. Burmese glosses only appear in Cafisii I's reign, fiom about II20 A.D. onwards22. They finally super- sede Mon only with the accession of Cafisfi II in II74. (ii) PI. 398 b is a Mon inscription on a brick found in a pagoda-ruin on Kyindaw island (Prantawsa kiwan), a long island in the Irawady 4 miles below Migyaung-ye, in the south of Magwe district. It was the southernmost fortress of the first Burmese kingdom of TambadTpa: the site of the disastrous battle which led to the death of Aniruddha's son. The inscription - 5 short lines of good iith century cursive - may be translated thus: - "These bricks (are given by) Gan San Nay (Mr. Gdn Sant) to help his lord the Teacher (tarlecdr). As the result of this help, he desires to become a Buddha. He offers the merit (of this good act) to his mother and father. - 4000 bricks (I-at)." Tarlecar is a colloquial contraction of tarla ey acdr, "my lord the dcariya"; in Rdjakumdr's in- scription it gets still further contracted into ticir. Nay, suffixed to the donor's name (in Modern Mon it is usually prefixed), is from Pali nayaka, Mod. Mon ndai, "master, Mr." Gan Sain is probably an Old Burmese name, 'Na Kan Safi', the -san suffix implying that he was a member of the village council of freemen, the yai sai class of Old Mon. The use of Burnt Brick for building pagodas goes back to Asoka, the Pali word being itthaka. This is the origin of many South-east Asian words for Brick: Siamese ith, Old Khmer it, Old Burm. Act, Old Mon I-at, Mod. Mon dluit. Old Mon hardly distinguished between short vowels in closed syllables: so I-at was probably only a variant of *I-it, or *lzit. A noun was commonly formed from a verb by reduplication of the initial consonant. If a word began with a vowel, 1- or r- might come in as the initial. An archaic feature of the script in this inscription, is the writing of initial a- with a tail below the line. (iii) The break between the Mon and the Burmese sub-periods of the Pagan dynasty was so abrupt, that it is prudent to place all, or nearly all, the Old Mon inscriptions, of Upper Burma at any rate, before Cafisfl II's accession in 536 s./II74 A.D. I.B., PI. III 305 b (our PI. 95 e) is a small undated stone fragment found at the north-east corner of West Hpetleik pagoda23. near Lokananda. It was last seen at Pagan Museum. A certain ya tirla, "this reverend lady", is mentioned, apparently a nun. Duroiselle thought that the inscription, "which un- doubtedly recorded the foundation of the pagoda, is another proof of its age, which can be placed be- tween A.D. I057-I059." - The script is old; but the Hpetleik Jdtaka plaques are surely later than those of Shwehsandaw, though very likely the work of some of the same artists. In my opinion the original Hpetleik pagodas are much older than Aniruddha; but the Jdtaka plaques and the Mon inscription belong to his reign, probably the latter part of it, c. I070 A.D. The inscription, though clear, is a tiny fragment: I cannot make continuous sense out of it. Nothing is legible about the founding of the pagoda. 22 For the oldest series of Burmese glosses, see Bohmu Ba Shin, The Lokahteikpan (Burm. Hist. Com., Sept. i962 - 212 pages, 70 plates). 23 See Taw Sein Ko, A.S.I. I907, p. I27, Plate L (e), and Plate XLI (Plan). The find-spot is marked (5) on the Plan (our P1. 94 b). Duroiselle's statement is at A.S.I. I1913, p. 89.</page><page sequence="124">io6 Chapter VI (iv) P1. 398 a is a Mon inscription engraved on 'W~bu' stone (mica schist), still in situ at the Tawya- gyaung, at the north-west foot of Kyaukse Hill24. It reads: - "This I" (a typical Old Mon beginning), "the mahdthera .. . .Io" (part of his name or title, or his previous see), "when I came to live here at Klok SayoA" (two of the three villages now absorbed in Kyauks' town)25, I informed the mahcthera of Buktim (Pagan), and I informed the king. In the building of this baddhasim" (permanent theni' or chapter-house), "the persons who do the work in my stead at this holy place, are the ordained monk (piaii) Mahadev; his father; his mother; his grandfather (?) ..." etc. Follows a list of four more pagoda-slaves. "I dedicate these to do the work in my stead at this holy place. Seven bnani of rice- field, royal gift (mahadain), which the child of sambeA Dalei gave to me, I give to this holy place." The mahcthera concludes with a fragmentary passage distributing the merit to all living beings. The raised plinth of the samu is still visible a few yards to the east of the stone. A permanent chapter- house was always a prime necessity for valid church ceremony, ordination and discipline. The in- scription proves the existence of large numbers of Mons still resident in the northern part of Kyauks6 during the Pagan period; so that a Mon archbishop had to come and serve the needs of the Mon church there. The mahtthera of Pagan mentioned in the inscription, may well have been Arahan, and the king Kyanzittha. The ordained monk (pi'jai), possessing "the five qualifications,"26 may even be the Mhddew who left his Mon signature on two votive tablets at Bodhgayd (P1. 30 a, b). He was clearly appointed head of the pagoda-slaves serving this religious establishment. A Buddhist monk could not be a slave in the ordinary sense; but there is a good deal of evidence in Pagan in- scriptions to show that he might be a pagoda-slave, which was then an honourable profession. (v) I.B., Pls. III 300, 30I. Pagan Museum Stone 68 (E. and W. faces)27. - This inscription was not sent to Blagden for editing, presumably because it consists mainly of lists of pagoda-slaves. Its exact provenance is unknown. Since it was one of the thirty stones found at Mahdbodhi pagoda, Paga'n, I suspect that it was originally moved there from the riverbank north-west of Paga'n, where the river appears to have eaten away a considerable slice of the old city. The inscription contains no date. Judged by the script, it may belong to the middle of the Paga'n period, perhaps the middle, or latter half, of the i2th century. There are a number of lateish forms in the spelling28. And the strong com- mixture of Burmese names suggests also a lateish date. The inscription is little but a list, or rather two lists, of slaves "given as a gift to the Holy One." Two donors are mentioned, but in neither case is the name clear. At Obverse line I, he may perhaps be "Mitra, the great tra"; and at Reverse line I5 "Pa It, the great. . ." (tra again perhaps, but the 24 Blagden's Inscr. No. XI. See Epig. Birm.

To be properly ordained, a monk must be ordained at a recognized site (vatthu), properly demarcated (stmd), in the presence of an assembly parishd), after a resolution (iiatti), officially endorsed (hammavaca). 2? The Reverse (W. face) is No. I253 in Duroiselle's List of Inscriptions found in Burma, and is transcribed on p. I97 of P.P.A.

At Obverse line i, at least, tra is certain. It might be the Pyu tra: = slave, servant; tra:ba: = minister. Tra appears again at I.B., PI. IV 367 C4, the Kyazin temple ink inscription29 at Myinpagan, where the donor is called in Burmese San Tra Uil (sat is Old Mon for sangha, a monk). INa It's donation consists of 30 slaves male and female, and a number of ricefields. Mitra donates about the same number of slaves. Their leader has the title yaA sai (Obverse line 2), which occurs frequently in Kyanzittha's palace inscriptions. Yan in Old Mon is a sort of honorific definite article (cf. Malay yang "divinity"); it may also be the prefix for Mon male names (Obverse line I3, Reverse line 7, twice, line 22, twice). Yai saA, then, were the class of saA (cf. the prefix sai at Obverse line ii), members of secular societies (Pali saigha), especially the village assembly. As for other prefixes, aid is the regular prefix of Old Burmese male names; ni', uin of Old Burmese female names; ya of Old Mon female names, and (possibly) yai of Old Mon male names. At Reverse line i6, Ad is prefixed to a Mon name: "Mr. Slave of the Holy One". For the rest, the inscription is chiefly of linguistic interest. Here are some of the rarer words: - kahci (Rev. lines 22, 23) = mother-in-law; dirde" (Rev. line 3) = the youngest of the family, like Old Burm. thuy (Obv. line 6); ia myan (Rev. line i8 - the first letter is doubtful) - an unknown term of relationship; mirmd (Obv. lines I4, Rev. line 6) = Burman; brdt (Obv. line 2) = banana; maliglei- (Obv. line 3), mafglan (Rev. line i2) = tamarind, Old Burm. maklani; tbar (Obv. line 4) = marrow of the bones; kruni (Obv. line io) = lizard; mlir (Obv. line I3) = jasmine; doc (Obv. line I4) and dwac (Rev. lines 23) = young, small.3' There are also Indian names: - candramd (Obv. line 7) = moonlight; lakkhani (Rev. line 5) = possessing auspicious signs; gangt (Rev. line ii) = pure as the Ganges; mali (Rev. line 20) = dirty; tulyd (Obv. line 8) = similar; kumuit (Rev. line 2I) = the white water- lily. BURMESE INSCRIPTIONS (4 DATED, 2 UNDATED) Burmese. - Apart from one text (2 faces) of Rdjakumdr's inscriptions (III3 A.D.), and the votive tablets incised with archaic Burmese found at Paga'n and (rarely) in Meiktila and Prome districts, we know of only four dated original Burmese inscriptions previous to Cafisfi II's accession in II74 A.D. (i) I.B., PI. II iii and II2, dated 482 S./II2I A.D. Now at Paga'n Museum, Stone I35, E. and W. faces. This two-faced inscription was found in a ruined temple a few hundred yards south-east of the Nagayon. The Obverse is certainly original, only 7 or 8 years later than RMjakumar's inscription. It records a dedication (lho for lhfi) by a sangr h (say, village-president ?) of 53 slaves (kyo for kywan) to four pagodas (puttho for puthttiw, Pali vatthu). The sankri also dedicated (Obv. line 24) "3000 areca-nut trees at Hyanpuw ManT, and 300 (pe) of wet ricefield." Hyanpuw is the Henbuiw of Rajakumdr's 29 This Old Burmese inscription shows plain evidence of Mon influence, for in line 7 San Tra UZi names the Kyazin temple Trailok Iuboh buil, "Strong Comfort of the Three Worlds" (of men, devas and brahmas); lIboh is Old Mon lu4hbiih, Mod. Mon Imuh, labok, Ibuih = coolness, happiness, corresponding to Old Burm. khyaiisd. 30 See ch. IV, n. I4I- 31 Cf. the two faces of the archaic Burmese inscription at I.B., Pls.

He concludes by con- signing all those who injure his dedication to pan-cdnantarit hell - the hell reserved for doers of the five acts which bring immediate retribution. The Reverse, I.B., PI. II2, is engraved in the large old cursive of the early-middle Paga'n period, in spelling much closer than the Obverse to Standard Old Burmese. It begins with a month-date: so the year should be the same as that of the Obverse. It also records a dedication by a safikrT, Na Kil Kamh San ("Mr. Giver", a name half Mon, half Burmese), of one temple (kit) and four putltuiw. Fifty slaves are named, corresponding closely, but not exactly, to the names given on the Obverse, but with spellings brought up to date. No land-dedications are mentioned. The Reverse concludes :- "As for me, I have no kith nor kin. I have absolutely no one to give (these slaves) to. So let these many drum-musicians (can- pandyd)33 stay with these holy pittdhutiw. Let all the saints living in this monastery take charge of them. Whoever seizes these slaves whom I have dedicated, let him fall into the places of suffering (apaty), the hell (irdy) called pagcitrik. May he never get the chance to behold Lord Buddhas, though they come to the rescue, as many as the grains in this heap of earth!" The slave-names listed on each face include 6 or more Mon names: ya kunny (Rev. line 4), "Miss Monkey"; Ah doc, ia dlwac (Obv. line 9, Rev. line 7), "Mr. Small"; several Indo-Aryan names (kisar, apacy, ali, pimsc, jimmit, kanakkassh, rYmand, rufi); and one Pa Syam (Rev. line 6), "Mr. Shan." For the rest, the comparison of spellings on the two faces, is of interest :34 e.g. Burmese women's names are prefixed with the archaic i or i on the Obverse, with Standard Old Burmese 'Wi on the Reverse. (ii) I.B., PI. II II3, dated 507 s./II45 A.D., when "the king (Purizak Iyrait taw) was (5)6 years of age": but the year-name does not agree with the year, and the reading 5 in the king's age is very doubtful. The inscription, now Stone 3 at Mandalay Palace Shed, comes from a site unknown. Prac- tically all the slave-names etc. are Burmese. The inscription records dedications to a "royal chapter- house (sih teaw)" and "a royal pagoda (Pfithuiw taw)" by the Yah Ut35 safikatliera and others. San- 32 Hyanpuw Mani. Cf. Ch. IV, n. i87. These are the main early references: - At I.B., P1. I 63 a'7, 560 s./1ii98 A.D., after "3000 (pe) of ricefields at Krapafi" (Khabin, east of Twante), there is mention of "6oo (pe) of ricefields at Yhanpuiw (the village-name is Cacsapyoh) and 40 Yhanpuiw slaves." At P1. I 761, 584 S./I223 A.D., there is mention of "Indian (kula) gardeners of Kanuit Pa-uih at Yhanpuiw port (safiphawchip)." At P1. II i6420, 620 S./I259 A.D., there is mention of "Hyanpuiw garden, and ioo (p') of ricefield at the foot of the garden." In the following line "850 Sak (Thet) slaves at Mani" are also mentioned. At P1. II 2I633, 628 S/I266 A.D., there is mention of "i family of Indian runaways at Yhanpuiw"; in the same line Krapai (Khabin) and Paykhi (Pegu) are mentioned; and in line 26, after Pilan (Bilin), "ARa Plaii San's garden at Mani"; in line 28 "i garden at Mani" is again mentioned, just before another at Tarakai Pusim (Bassein). At P1. III 2898, 640 s./I278 A.D., after PFau Caywaih (Zalun in Prome district), there is mention of "iooo (pe) of Kalyak Th Pha Ran's land at Yhanpuiw, and 30 slaves"; Krapah (Khabin) is mentioned in line io. Note also List 963a", 804 s./I442 A.D. (the obverse of Sagaing Htupay6n inscrip- tion): - "In the S.W. region, where the kings of Pagan used to loosen their joints by going out along the Hinpuiw river, and worship the noble Mahe-cafikyaiz spirit." 33 Cani here, I expect, stands for caii sain = drummers - always male in Pagan inscriptions. Pandya, more usually pantya, derives from Sanskrit vadya-kaya, "musician"; but in Old Burmese pantya are always women, and usually in contrast to can sani, drummers, who were men. Pantyd combined singing and dancing. This is shown in line 3 of the reverse of a new fragment found at Pinle in the south of Kyaukse: thus 11 uiw wan tui pantya ka ciy sate" "As for Miss Cross (?), let her dance as a pantya." 34 Here are some other spelling-differences between the Obverse (P1. iii) and the Reverse (P1. II2): - rik/ryak (day of month). ni/niy' (day of week). pi/piy (to give). !lTy', iy (this). teh/te (verbal assertive suffix). lom/luth (round thing). sasn dini/sasn duin (iron post). phu~n/phun (virtue). i' kroni/ui krwaii (Miss Survivor). i'pliii/ui plan (Miss Full). 35 Yan Ut. The y of yan is not quite certain. But Col. Ba Shin has checked and approved of it.</page><page sequence="127">Chapter VI I09 ghathera, "doyen of the Sangha", is not a very common title in Pagan inscriptions. It reminds one of another fine old inscription (P1. I 22, 23, 563 S./I20I A.D.), where the chief witness of a dedication was the Ut safighadhi, "Ut Saigitathera": this inscription is in situ at Hsutaungpyi-pAhto, east of Thadun-e village, Mahlaing township, Meiktila district. There are several other old inscriptions there36. I suspect that our inscription comes from this region; and that the yai (if correctly read) before Ut is just the old Austric honorific prefix ('god'; 'His Majesty'; 'the'). The dedications of the inscription in sitit were witnessed, not only by the Safighathera, but by "all the sanghas belonging to Ut village", including "the high-seated thiss krT so) Saikrs Ut, and all the villagers" (PI. 2210-16). Ut is the Indo- Aryan word (istaki, it[hakd) for Burnt Brick, once a novelty in Burma, and used especially (after Asoka's example) for building pagodas. It is not impossible that Cafisui I, to serve the needs of Meiktila district (East), built the chapterhouse and Ut puthlutiw here, and that the senior monks contributed, and so the village became known as Ok ywa (Ut rwd), 'Brick Village.' The reading of this inscription is not easy. I offer the following tentative translation: - "In 507 s., Kdrttika year, on Friday the I4th day of the waxing moon of Kason (kichfin), when the king gave the ... boon (?)37 (to) the royal pagoda at the royal chapterhouse, (Y)aA Ut Safighathera gave the following pagoda-slaves" [6 names of women]. "Kaikasft and Mahcpitiw" [presumably ministers, Gafigasfira and Mahdbala, but the names are not certain] "gave" [about 6 names of men, including a drummer]; "a large (?) 'tank'; 3 stretches (plan) of wet ricefield; z measures (khrci) of dry field; 2 yoke of cattle. Witnesses of this my gift were the Reverend Mahdthera; the sankrT Nd Santa Sani ('Mr.Coral'); the sdAlydA KloktoA ['Stone Mountain', a place in Kyaukse38?]; the Reverend Al.y ('Middle'); all these are my witnesses. May they get the merit of all my dedications. The PrankhoA sdAkrT, 7(a Ydn Sail, gave to the ioyal thenn pahto' (si* pfithuw) the following pagoda-slaves" [2 women]; "4 (p') of ricefield at the deserted village (rwd chuw); rising ground and dry field at Khy27 (or Pyit?) village; and 2 cattle. The old ordained monk (paicaikr7) of Thf-rhcl gave to the royal pagoda" [7 slaves: 4 men, 3 women including Uih SyaPn pantyah 'the singer-dancer Miss Shan']. "La(h)iy" An(u)th7 (?) gave to the royal pagoda" [Ii slaves: 7 men including Nc Syarn ('Mr. Shan') and a drummer, and 4 women] "and Non ('Banyan') ricefield. Should (even) the saihkri's grandmothers or the Mahdthera's great-grandfathers or their children or grandchildren - whoever injures these pagoda-slaves, may the axe burst his breast! May he fall off a ladder!" The last 61 lines are faint. They record other, and perhaps later, dedications, including "one cow left to end her days in peace' (nwvd ta ma saitika tag sa). San is a word sometimes difficult to fix in Old Burmese39, since it is applied either to monks (as in Old Mon) or to laymen, according as the society (sangha) to which they belonged was religious or 36 See L B., PIs. III 323 a and 344 a, b. The former records a dispute which was reported to king Caiisfi (line I7) - probably Cafisti II. He issued orders "on Tuesday, the 7th waxing of Tazaungmon." No year is mentioned; but the handwriting is similar to that of PIs. I 22, 23, dated 563 S., Sunday, I4th waxing of Tagu. The latter inscription, P1. III 344 a, b, is one of the many versions of Klacwa's edict against thieves, 6ii S./I249 A.D. 37 I read .. fi rhiy' chu piy so. But the reading is doubtful, and the first two words baffle me. In the date the final figure 7 is certain, but 502 was a Karttika year, not 507 nor any odd number. 38 There was a Klohtoi in Saitoi kharuin: see I.B., P1. IV 453 a8, 696 s./I335 A.D. It was also the name of a fortified outpost of Myinzaing, captured by the Mongol army in February I30I (see J. Siam Soc. Vol. XLVII, Pt. I, June I959, p. i62 and n. 279). 39 See Dr. Pe Maung Tin's learned discussion of these terms at J.B.R.S. Vol. XXV, Pt. III, 1935, reprinted in B.R.S. Fiftieth Anniversary Publications No. 2 (Rangoon i960), pp. 4I4-6.</page><page sequence="128">II0 Chapter VI secular. Nor do the names that follow (PT Santd San, R1 Ydn San) often help; for monks and nuns in Old Burma were called, at will, either by their secular or their religious names. In Ch. IV (pp. 68-69) I have suggested that sat k4t, sah lyah ('saft great and small') were perhaps president and vice- president of the local village assembly. But saikrY is also commonly applied to senior monks or nuns. Thus at I.B., P1. I 537-12 (586 s./I224 A.D.), in a list of saitgha witnesses to a dedication, comes first the skhin sankathi, the Reverend Safighathera; next the Reverend (skhiA) Uiw Kra* Pan San (a nun); then, 2 lines below, sankri Uiw Lhok Sain (a nun); then sailkri nay, etc. Note that this "younger senior monk" is written sankri nay, not sanlyaii. I take it therefore that a sailyah was always a layman (or laywoman); whereas a sailkrT might be either monk or nun, layman or laywoman. But in view of the inscription we are considering, where monks and laymen are mentioned together, with monks not always taking precedence, there is still some room for doubt. The spelling of this inscription is pre-Standard40, but not nearly so archaic as that of I.B., P1. II III (25 years earlier), though that comes from Paga'n. If this comes from Meiktila, it was nearer than Paga'n to the Eleven khar'zin of Kyaukse, from which (I think) Standaid Old Burmese orthography originated. (iii) I.B., P1. I 3, dated 5I2 s./II5O A.D.41 Now at Mandalay Palace Shed, Stone I4. The person who removed it to Amarapura - probably under orders from king Bodawpaya in I793 A.D. - took care to engrave MraiikhuhtuiAi at the base of the stone. Myingondaing. (O.B. Mraik~hhnthiin) was the central kharutin south-west of Kyaukse town. That the inscription comes from Kyaukse is confirmed by the fact that it is made of 'Webu' stone (mica schist)42. 'W6bu' is the name of the hilly ridge east of Kyaukse town; and Webu stone inscriptions are confined, in space to North Kyaukse, and in time (with very few exceptions) to the Pagan period, usually the first half of it. This one records the dedication of 34 slaves and 5 p' of ricefield by the Reverend Mahlthera (Archbishop) R`jagur (Teacher of the King): - "They are slaves got by merit of the Buddha, by merit of my master, by merit of the king. My kith and kin are not to get them. Let the result of my dedication be shared between my master, the king, his beloved wife, and all the royal family (acaw). May all living beings also share in it! - We, the slaves, are witnesses to you, my lord. - So the Reverend Mahdthera Ra}aguuru, being very glad, informed the king. And the king too was right glad and said: -'I join in dedicating three persons from among my lord's relations'.. .Thereupon, entering the royal house, he dedicated these three persons by the pouring of pure water. Furthermore the king went on to declare: -'The monk (rahan), son of the goldsmith (panthin) who made the (ear-tubes?) for me -let him also be saved (from Sarh- sara).'-Those dedicated by the king's pouring of pure water, including the monk, were thus four persons." At least 7 of the 34 slave-names are Mon. Of the three relatives of the Mahdthera dedicated - very likely mother, father and daughter - the parents appear to have Mon names. If the Mahdthera 40 The chief pre-Standard feature is the indiscriminate use of long vowels, irrespective of tone: -safi, rydk (day), fun (rising ground). kan (tank), etc. Spellings like kiichfln (line 2; month of Kas6n), piirha (lines 4, i i; the Buddha, from Pali/Skt. vara), piithuw (lines ii, I3, I5; Pagoda, from Pali vatthu), mdhathi (line i8; Maha-thera), suggest that in Old Burmese there was more equality of stress between penultimate and final syllables than there is today. 41 For a fuller editing of this inscription, see Bulletin of the Burma Historical Commission, Vol. I, Part IT, pp. 231-7. 42 Wdbu stone.

The inclusion of the monk (rahan) shows that at Pagan pagoda-slavery, as distinct from ordinary slavery, was an honourable profession. For such an early inscription the spelling is remarkably close to Standard Old Burmese. One sus- pects that standard spelling was fixed in Kyaukse rather than Pagan43. AJAWLAT (iv) 1.B., Pls. I, 4 and 5, in situ in Pagan Dhammayangyi temple44. The date 527 S., Ist waning of Pyatho, may fall at the end of ii65 or the beginning of ii66 A.D. The inscription occupies the south and north faces of the pillar in the North Hall of the great Dhammdra*n temple, "Pleasance of the Law", a mile south-east of Pagan. Last of the Mon temples of Pagan, it was built on a plan almost identical with that of Nanda, but a very different elevation. It is always attributed to the son and successor of Cafisti I, now called Narathu (Narasfira) or Kulikya - the king "killed by Indians". Narathu was killed (as we shall see in the next chapter) in the Singhalese invasion and capture of Pagan near the end of ii65 - the very time when this inscription was set up. There followed, it seems, 9 years of confusion, until II74 A.D., when Canlsfi II was enthroned .The inscription dates, I think, from the very beginning of the interregnum, when Singhalese troops were patrolling or threatening the capital. Its main author was Ajdwlat (the reading is probable, though not certain), "the Middle Princess". To judge by her mental maturity, she was perhaps the daughter of Caiisfi I rather than Narathu. But what does the inscription say? - "The inscription which my mother never wrote. First written by Ajdwlat; then also written by" some senior officials: 2 kalans, one of them a woman, and a saphpydiz and (perhaps) his wife. Ajdwlat may have been the sister of the dead king; and since her (or their?) mother was afraid to provoke trouble with the army of occupation by an act recalling Narathu's merits, she undertook it as a duty. For the vast temple was complete; and it was necessary to record its dedication without delay, so as to avert vandalism, to 'release' it from secular dues, and to hand it over to the Church. - This, at least, is a possible explanation of the circumstances. But one admits that there are mysteries about this temple still to be solved: notably, the huge work of walling up the interior corridor on all sides except the east. Apart from the apex of the pillar, the inscription is quite plain except for the writing. The South face (Plate 4) has 25 lines, the North face (Plate 5) 271 lines. The letters are tall. The carving was done with exceptional care. In beauty of engraving it is fully the equal of Pillar B of Rdjakumdr. The critical situation at Pagan at the moment must account for the arid nature of the contents: no mention of the royal builder; little but bare lists of slaves dedicated, with note of the cattle, gardenland, tank, and dry weather ricefields. It concludes with a vivid curse on infringers of the property. After the opening invocation, first Sanskrit (Sr), then Pali (namo buddhlya), comes the detailed date (Old Mon style), giving the naksat (27th part of the ecliptic, with its lunar asterism); the lagna (zodacal or other sign ascendent on the eastern horizon); the p=hefr (Sanskrit prahara, 'a striking', a day-watch or period of 3 hours); and the nadT (Sanskrit n~d1ikd, two-fifteenths of a prahara, a period of 24 minutes). Such details are usually omitted in Old Burmese. 4aFor a discussion of this point, see Bull. Burm. Hist. Com. Vol. I, Part II, pp. 233-5; J.B.R.S. Vol. XLII, Part I, p. 92. 44 For a fuller editing of this two-faced inscription, see Bull. Burm. Hist. Com., Vol. I, Part II, pp. 239-255.</page><page sequence="130">II2 Chapter VI After mention of her assistants, come two long lists of pagoda-slaves. The first list of seventy slaves is headed by a kamkZn (tax-assessor?) and his wife, who has a Mon name. The names include at least 4 Mons, also a Hill-Karen (Tonsfi), a Wa (Lawa), and possibly a Kadu (Kantgih). Only indications of sex, age and relationship are added. These slaves were presumably dedicated to the Dhammayangyi. From line 2 of Plate 5 there starts a second list, "54 persons big and small," "slaves of Lu-thwot (?) pagoda," 'Crown of the World of Men.' The names are purely Burmese; they include a few pantyah, women singers and dancers. There is no other pagoda within or near the enclosure-wall. Was Lu- thwot a now-forgotten name for the temple itself, and Dhammdra* for the 'Pleasance' as a whole? - If so, the difference between the two lists might be that the former were all cultivators, working the glebelands perhaps far from the capital, while the latter lived at Paga'n and were responsible for the temple-duties there. The inscription concludes as follows: - "Total 48 cattle. Garden. Tank. 3Ody of dry-season ricefield (miwryai). The curse just implicated by me, the mother, and me, the reverend lord: - These my pagoda-slaves, cattle, ricefields, garden, tank, my monastery, my pagoda - whoever not conserves them but leaves them defective or in ruin, though they be my children or grandchildren, may the rice and curry they eat, the water they drink, the house they live in, poison them! Like as they would wish to pierce a grown male elephant, with a hundred spears may they be pierced themselves! Like as they would see a snake and want to kill it, may they be killed themselves! May Devadatta45 be above, and the destroyers beneath! Whoever conserves my dedication, whether my children or grandchildren or other persons, may it not befall them!" An archaic feature of Ajdwlat's inscription, chiefly near the end where space was short on the stone, is the running together of separate words, by placing the first consonant of the second word subscript to the last consonant of the first, thus avoiding the use of the excellent new symbol, the 'athat' or 'killer' - a short horizontal stroke placed above a final consonant to show that its inherent vowel is not to be pronounced. The orthography is peculiar, not Standard Old Burmese. While adopting the Indian alphabet, the Kyaukse Burman had employed, almost from the first, a vowel-combination, -ui-, not found in India. This occurs frequently in the Myingondaing inscription which we have just considered. Thus kti, the Objectival Suffix, is there written kiiw, as in Standard Old Burmese. Ajdwlat writes kezw, a pre- Standard combination which has not survived. In Rdjakumdr's inscription (also at Pagan), the vowel was written in many different ways: -uiw, -iw, -eiw, -ei, -"i, -i. On I.B., PI. iii it is written -uiw or -iw; on P1. II3 -uiw or -uw. But hardly less noticeable than the strangeness of Ajdwlat's spelling, is its internal consistency. Here there is none of the haphazard spellings of Rdjakumdr's inscriptions. Indeed, when one comes to study it in detail, one reaches the conviction that here we have, for the first time, a good system - not quite perfect, nor always consistently applied (in particular, on the second face) - but an unmistakable system for indicating the three 'Tones', Short, Level and Heavy, of Old Burmese. The Short Tone is shown, either (i) by adding or subscribing an apostrophe, ', after or below a final letter (the subscript form has evolved into the modern 'a-myit' or dot below the letter); or (ii) by use of a short final vowel, as in modern Burmese. The Level Tone is shown by use of a long vowel or diphthong, whether in open syllables or those closed by a consonant.

In consonant- endings it is generally shown by the use of a short vowel or diphthong to distinguish it from the Level Tone; but here some inconsistencies occur, especially with the vowel -o-, where the script does not distinguish long and short.

So she thought of using the same symbols to distinguish Tone instead, which the script failed to distinguish. The long vowel was reserved for the level tone; and for the short tone, and for the heavy tone on open vowels, she added distinguishing marks mostly based on Old Mon. It was not her fault that her system, so carefully thought out in a period of crisis, was not generally adopted; and that Burmese, in consequence, had to wait nearly six centuries to achieve an adequate orthography. The vested influence of Kyauks6 proved too strong. The system (if it deserves the name) of Standard Old Burmese was far inferior to Ajdwlat's. She deserves to be remembered with honour for having demonstrated in Burmese letters a standard of orthography far in advance of her time. So much for the dated Burmese inscriptions of this transitional period. A few more could be added if we admit undated ones. On grounds of archaic style and spelling, I should include the following: - 8</page><page sequence="132">II4 Chapter VI (v) I.B., P1. III 303, an inscription still in situ on top of Mt. Thetso (Sakcuiw), south of Tuywin- daung (Tvranton)46. i9 lines. No date. Author not named. "In this my existence as a man, I have made three Buddhas (parha). And pagodas (pfithuiw) twice. And also written the Nidan Ja (?)47 - one book. And also built a monastery. And planted two peepal trees. And built a hall of the Law (dhammasa) and a resthouse (carap)48. And dug one tank. And made two sons monks (rahan). And given five offerings (cho) of monastic robes. And given in dedication autumn gifts (?)49, almsbowls, kettles, etc. And worshipped with banners and umbrellas every year without a break. And kept the precepts every day, every night, without a break. "For doing so, I do not want (the merit) for myself alone. May Sa'krd, Bruhma, and all the spirits also get it. May the mahathe and all the saitgha also get it. May the king (main) and all mankind (lo) also get it. May lions and all four-footed beings also be saved. May the kalfn (Garuda) king and all the birds also be saved. May the great (?) Nagd king and all the Asfira get the merit. May my former (?) teacher (chdrya), my later teacher, and all the dear ones also get the merit. May my mother, father, daughter, younger sister, and all the kindred also get the merit.

After coming to know very splendid and desired (? aticetarakandthdthd) existences, I want to be born as a teacher of all men (lo) and spirits. Thus I pray every day without a break... I do indeed. And I dedicate (this) cold-water pot." Judged by its spelling-differences from Standard Old Burmese, this Thetso inscription is as archaic as any of the dated inscriptions. In its use of an unnecessary 'a-that' or Apostrophe after a short open syllable, it outdoes even Lower Burma Old Mon5l. It frequently lengthens the unaccented penulti- mate52, suggesting (as said in note 40 supra) that there was not in Old Burmese the wide difference in stress between syllables that there is today. For the -uiw vowel of Standard Old Burmese, -iw occurs twice, -uiw once; -ik occurs once for -Uik53. -i for -iy is normal54. Long and short vowels, both medial and final, tend to get mixed65: even ma 'not' is written mt. -o may stand for -i56. The writing of phloi 46 See Duroiselle, A.S.B. I926, pp. 26-27, 55 (App. G, No. io). 47 Probably the Nidanakathd, the introductory chapter of the Jdtaka Commentary, giving the life of the Buddha down to Andthapindika's dedication of the Jetavana monastery. 48 'Resthouse' is the modern meaning given to Burm. carap, as well as Old Mon jrap from which it is derived. But at I.B., PI. I 7326, 585 S./I223 A.D., we read: "He also built a permanent brick carap, in order that pious people who wish to give alms, may give their alms there." Perhaps 'almsgiving shed' would be a better translation. 49Very doubtful. I read sardaryah. 50 From Pali timitimifigala etc. Malalasekera (Dict. Pd1i Proper Names, I, p.

The date, then, is after II3I A.D., when the Shwegu was built.

We have reviewed with some thoroughness all known historical writings of the Pagan period pre- vious to the great change (II74 A.D.). It was clearly a period of transition. After the richness and poetry of Old Mon, one cannot but feel a 'drop' when one starts on Old Burmese, with its bald prosaic statements of bare fact. But alive, with all the eagerness of youth it is, and first-rate material for history. In the earlier period the focus of interest centred too narrowly on kings and royal courts. Little is said about the common man and woman, hillman and plainsman, cultivator and slave. With the writing of Burmese, the field of knowledge and interest will soon expand, to cover at any rate the plains. The five hundred and more stone inscriptions of the next century, down to the coming of the Mongols, will furnish material for a volume fuller and larger than this one. Modern Burma was fortunate in its founders: Aniruddha, Kyanzittha and Alaungsithu among the kings; Abeyadana, RMjakumdr and Aj dwlat among the courtiers; the mahdthera Arahan; such scholars as Sumedha and Muggaliputta; and the nameless architects of the Nat-hlaung-gyaung, Nanpaya, Kyaukku Onhmin, Pahtothamya, Abeyadana, Nanda, Shwegugyi, Thatbyinnyu, and many another masterpiece. All these have set standards which have never, in Burma's history, been surpassed. Each one of them is still an inspiration. But they must be judged by their own extant contemporary record, and not by coarse and fanciful reconstructions of later times.</page><page sequence="135">CHAPTER VII THE CHANGE. IM-TAW-SYAN (Kula-kya), d. ii65 A.D. Names and titles - votive tablets (Ioo Buddhas) - regnal dates - Dhammayan-gyi - version of the Chronicles: tyranny and assassination - Patikkard - Ceylon Cidavamsa version: quarrel with Parakramabahu I - the armada - capture of Papphcala, Bassein and Pagaln - Devanagala rock inscription, ii65 A.D. - interregnum - results: re- storation of the "Aniruddhas" - marriage of Caisi II and Vatapisikd - Singhalese influence supplants Mon at the capital - gradual flowering of Old Burmese culture. NAMES AND TITLES An original inscription dated 59I S./I229 A.D.1, still in situ on the top of Mt Thetso (Sakcuiw) south of Tuywindaung (Turaittoit), is our best evidence for the order of Aniruddha's successors. Unfortunately the Obverse, which contains the list of kings, is very faint, and several of the names are doubtful. The subject is the infringement of a dedication originally made by "the lady of Marhak" in Kyaukse2, probably a royal concubine, "daughter of the katkun cakhi", tax-assessor (?) and secretary. "Man Lulan was informed. An official enquiry was held; and in the time of Tciluin man exemption was granted. In the time of Sak taw rhain3 also exemption was granted. In the time of Im-taw-syah (?) also exemption was granted. In the time of Narapati (?) also exemption was granted. And now in the time of Ia (C)uin (Phayo)A and in my time, why repeat the request? Exemption has been granted a long, long time. Let there be an order(?) confirming the exemption. - The exemption was granted on Tuesday the 9th waxing (?) of Narika" (=Wagaung, say July, in 573 S./I2II A.D. - the date is repeated from line I), "and on Thursday the (ioth waxing) of Taingthalin" (Aug. i8th ?), "the king ascended the throne4." Main Lulait isAniruddha's son, Saw Lu. Then comes TViluift's king, Kyanzittha. Then Sak taw rhan-, 'Long royal life', Caflsfi I, Alaungsithu. Then Im-taw-syait (the last syllable is doubtful) - the 'Narathu' of the Chronicles. Then Narapati, i.e. Cans-i II (the reading is doubtful). Then, it seems, another king or pretender to the throne, whose name is quite doubtful. And the list concludes with a king unnamed, but certainly Ndtoitmyd, whose date of accession is confirmed from other sources5. VOTIVE TABLETS (IOO BUDDHAS) Im-taw-syait means "Lord of the Palace." Narathu (Narasfira), the name given in the Chronicles6, is not confirmed by known inscriptions of any antiquity. As for his regnal title, it appears (we think) 1 I.B., PI. I, 6o a, b. The Reverse (West face - the date 59I s. is in line 4), is clear; it is List 203, U.B. I,p.i83. The Obverse (East face) is not included in the book. A fragmentary duplicate of both faces was discovered at the same site in Jan. I956. See Ma Mya Than, "Some of the Earlier Kings of Pagan Dynasty", J.B.R.S. Vol. XXII, Part II, pp. IOI-IO2. 2 Marhak (Mashet). - See Ch. V, n. Io, and Ch. II, p. 33, n. I40. 3 Sak-taw-rhaft. - See Ch. V, p. 83, n. 4. 4 I.B., PI. I 6o a, lines. I-9. 5 Compare I.B., PI.

The Pali inscription on the reverse, in early Mon-Burmese cursive script, reads generally as follows: - sirl tribhuvandditya varadhamma disaihpati akdsi buddhapatimarh imaih sarhbodhipattiyd ti sri tribhuvandditya varadhammardjd ddnapati "SirT Tribhtvrandditya-varadhamma, Lord of the Quarters, made this image of the Buddhas with the object of attaining perfect enlightenment. - So says the donor, Sri Tribhuvancaditya-varadhammarajd." This royal title, following Kyanzittha's model, and exactly like that of Can'sfi I except that vara takes the place of pavara, appears to be that of a new king of Pagan. If so, Im-taw-syafi is the likeliest: for the script is early, and the later kings, from Cafisi II onwards, discontinued the practice of stamping personal tablets. REGNAL DATES. DHAMMAYAN-GYI The regnal dates of this king will have to be corrected. In the Jadtatop'zt RajavaA8 they are given as 529-532 S. (ii67-70 A.D.); in the Hmannan as 529-533 S. (ii67-7I A.D.)9. The accession-date of Cafisfi II, 536 s./II74 A.D., rests on the evidence of the Minsawhla inscription at Khinmun'0, whose latest date is 744 S. - more than two centuries later. There appears to have been a long interregnum between the two reigns. An earlier date for Im-taw-syafi's death, ii65 A.D., is imposed by foreign evidence, as we shall see. If so, we must assume an earlier date also for his accession. He is always credited with the building of the Dhammayan-gyi (Dhammdrath) temple at Pagan. The north hall of this temple holds a fine pillar with the Old Burmese inscription of Ajdwlat, which we considered in the last chapter". It is dated 527 s., near the end of ii65 or the beginning of ii66 A.D. - a year or more before the Chronicles' date for the king's accession. Now the Dhammayan-gyi, largest of all the giants of Paga'n and one of the most carefully constructed, must have taken several years to build. It is not likely to have been begun before the king's accession. It has therefore been suggested (supra, p. 85) that Cafisfi I's death and Im-taw-syafi's accession probably took place not later than ii6o A.D. The Dhammayan-gyi temple will be described in a later chapter: suffice it here to say that it follows the ground-plan of Nanda, but greatly heightens and weightens the superstructure. It is the last great specimen of 'Mon' architecture at Paga'n. VERSION OF THE CHRONICLES: TYRANNY AND ASSASSINATION The king was a usurper, supplanting his elder brother, Min Shin Zaw (Man: Rhai Co:)12. The Chronicles make him a parricide, who smothered his aged father within his own temple, the Shwdgu. 7 P1. i9. A note in the Catalogue of Plates lists the many Pagaln sites where Im-taw-syafi's tablets have been found. 8 Jdtdt6pu1im ra]javan, ed. by U Hla Tin, p. 40, No. 46 Kuld:kya. I U Kala's dating - 520-523 s./II58-ii6I A.D. - is about as early as that of the other Chronicles is late. 10 See Ch. V, n. 40. ilsupra, p. III. 12 Mah:rhai co:. - According to the Chronicles, Minshinzaw was twice guilty in the Court of rudeness to his old father, who therefore expelled him from the capital. He removed to the south of Mandalay district, where he "dwelt at Htunton Putek (T'wantumiz: Piitak) toward the east, founding a village and domain. There he dammed AungpinI6 lake (ONIpaiay han), 3000 ta in length and breadth; moreover he dammed the lake at Tam6kso30 (Tamut- chui :). He built three canals, creating 30,000 pe of wet rice-fields" (G.P.C., p. I27). He also invited scholarly monks to write books and teach the people the Buddhist scriptures. On his father's death, Narathu invited him to return and ascend the throne. No sooner enthroned, than he poisoned him.</page><page sequence="137">Chapter VII II9 He is described as a tyrant, the murderer of his wife Kraphan, her son Uttarasfi, and her father's younger brother, Mahdbuil the scribe. His chief wife, daughter of an Indian (kuld:) king, the king of Patikkayd :, shocked at his uncleanly personal habits, avoided him: whereat enraged, the king stabbed her. Her lather pledged eight of his fighting men to take revenge at the cost of their lives; and the eight, disguised as Brahmans, came to Pagan, entered the palace, pierced the king with their swords, and then committed suicide. Thereafter the king was known as Kuhl: kya, "killed by Indians" - a name by which he is certainly called in late inscriptions'3. Note that the Arakanese historian, Do We, in his MahdrqJavait, is said to give an entirely different version of events leading up to the assassi- nation14. PATIKKARA Patikkayd: is doubtless the same place at Patikkard, given in the Dhammarajaka inscription'5 (558 s./ii96 A.D.) as one of the western boundaries of Canfsil II's kingdom, probably to the north-west. It is mentioned similarly in the Chronicles as the kula: (Indian) country bounding Aniruddha's kingdom on the west'8, and Kyanzittha's on the south-west'7. A prince of this country, holding in his mouth a magic gem, would come by air and make love to Shw6-6ng-thi (Rhwe-im-sani), Kyanzittha's daughter, until one day, meeting on his airy way the saintly Shin Arahan, and hearing that his sweetheart was married to another, he gasped, and the live mercury dropping from his mouth, he fell from the sky and perished18. Cafisfi I is said to have been, in a former existence, that prince who fell from the sky'9. The king of Patikkard presented him with a daughter, Pabhdvati, who was the delight of his old age, but provoked to jealousy his eldest son20. Where, exactly, was Patikkard? - The late N. K. Bhattasali, Curator of Dacca Museum, identified it with a ruined city on a hill in Tipperah district:21 "-Abundant ruins all over the plateau unmis- takeably testify to the existence of an ancient town on it, of moderate dimensions. The hill is included in the pargana of Patikkara, which extends westwards from the range and includes Bad-kdmtd... We know that Pdtikdrd or Pattikerd was a famous town in pre-Muhammadan days, situated some- where in these parts. A copperplate inscription of one Ranavafika Malla, discovered somewhere on this Ld1mai range in i803 and read by Mr Colebrook in Volume II, page 24I, of his Essays, des- cribes the town of Pattikera, as adorned with forts and vihdras. This description accords with the ruins of the town on the plateau, and we have no hesitation in identifying the ruins as those of the town of Pattikera." 13 List 96 (B I, i65-6).

The Tirumalai inscription of RMjendra Chola (I025 A.D.)23 shows that Bengal was at this time under three different ruling families. Govinda Chandra held sway in Vanga, Mahipdla in Varendra and Uttara Rcdha, and Rana~fira in Daksina Radha. From the Rampal plate of ;rl Chandra Deva (Epig. Ind., Vol. XII, p. I36), we come to know of a branch of the Chandras who appear to have had their seat in Samatata. They are called the family of the Chandras who had been holding sway over the Rohitd hill. Rohitdgiri, meaning the 'red hill', appears only to be the Sanskritised name of the Lalmci (lit. 'red soil') range24 which occupies the centre of the Tippera district. It is a low picturesque range of hillocks lying five miles west of Comilld, the chief town of the Tippera district. The average height of the peaks is about 40 ft., and the breadth about a mile; but some of the peaks rise to a height of ioo ft. The range lies north to south and is about ii miles in length. Many of the hillocks were undoubtedly crowned by temples and stupas. . . The Chandras of Rohitdgiri were Buddhists, and the first man of note in the family was called Purnachandra. His son was Suvarnachandra. His son Trailokyachandra appears to have been a great warrior. He is said to have been the mainstay of the king of Harikela, which is only another name for Vanga. He appears finally to have acquired the kingship of Chandravipa, which was the name of the tract of land forming the greater part of the modern district of Backerganj. Trailokya's son Srchandra Deva appears to have mastered the whole of Vaiga. He issued his copper- plate grants from Sra Vikramapura, which town is now heard of for the first time, and which may unhesitatingly be identified with the extensive ruins of a city known at present by the name of Rdm- p5J, situated in the heart of the Vikrampur pargand of the Dacca district. The Chandras were ousted in the beginning of the iith century by the Varmmans, who in their turn made room for the Senas towards the end of the same century. Laksmana Sena, as is well-known, was ousted from his throne by Ikhtiyaruddin Muhammad-bin-Bakhtiyar in I202 A.D. Buddhism had begun to decline in these parts with the fall of the Chandras. The Varmmans and the Senas were no friends of Buddhism. With the coming of the Muhammadans, both Brahmanism and Buddhism suffered a serious set-back. Bengal sculpture went out like a lamp and the art was forgotten within half a century. Buddhism gradually bled to death and never revived." Some of the sites discovered by Bhattasali have been recently excavated by Dr. F. A. Khan25 on the Mainamati Llmdi ridge, some 5 miles west of Comilla, in East Pakistan. These Buddhist sites, as we shall see later, are important, among other reasons, for comparison with Pagan architecture, both temples and monasteries. CEYLON CULAVAMSA VERSION: QUARREL WITH PARAKRAMABAHU I Spearman, author of the British Burma Gazetteer, thought the assassins of Kul-kya came from Ceylon; and he cites in support a note on pp. 47-48 of Yule's Mission to the Court of Ava, quoting 22 N. K. Bhattasali, Iconography of Buddhist and Brahmanical Sculptures in the Dacca iVluseum (Dacca, I929), pp. 9-I2. 23Cf. Dr. Benoychandra Sen, Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal (Calcutta University, I942), PP. 57-60, 86. 24 Dr. Sen (ibid., p. 370), however, thinks "there is not much to be said in support of the theory that seeks to identify [Rohitagiri] with the Lalmai Hills in the Tippera district." See his version (pp. 368ff.) 25Dr. Khan's reports have been issued by the Government of East Pakistan, Dacca: - Mainamati (I956); Second Phase of Archaeological Excavations in East Pakistan (Jan.-March I956); Third Phase . . . (Jan.-March I957).</page><page sequence="139">Chapter VII I2I Turnour's Epitome of Singhalese Chronology2l. Duroiselle found the identification of Patikkara with Ceylon "untenable."27 One may admit this, and accept Bhattasali's fixing of the site of Patikkard, and yet regard the king of Ceylon as the prime cause of the assassination. For Ceylon history provides a different, and a much older, account of the incident. And unless we adopt the improbable alternative of believing that two kings of Burma were killed about this time by two different foreign invaders, we must choose between them. The I3th century Cfflavathsa28 of Ceylon, backed up, as it is, by an original Singhalese inscription, must be accepted as a more reliable source for this period than the late Arakanese and Burmese Chronicles. What is the Ceylon version? - It is told at length in Chapter 76 of the Cfilavathsa29. The Ceylon king was the great Pardkramabdhu I (Vi. II53-86 A.D.). No date is given for the trouble with Burma: but the old Ceylon archaeologist, H. C. P. Bell, cites the Devanagala inscription in Kegalla districts (about io miles east of Kandy) as evidence that "the war against Aramana" (=Rdmaiiia, here= Pagan), "was determined on in the I2th year of the king", i.e. about ii64 A.D.31 The Cftlavaiisa account may be summarised as follows: - Between the countries of Lankai (Ceylon) and Rdmaninia (Burma) there had never been dissension, since both were inhabited by people holding the true faith, and the kings of both were good Buddhists. All previous kings had felt deeply rooted trust in each other, were wont to exchange costly gifts, and thus had long lived in intercourse and amity. Even the then-reigning king, like his predecessors, had kept up friendly relations with king Pardkramabdhu. "But once upon a time the deluded one har- kened to the words of slanderers, of certain messengers who came back from our land." And so the trouble started. The charges made against the king of Burma were largely concerned with trade- and other missions: - He deprived envoys of the king of Lanka of "the maintenance formerly granted." He issued an order forbidding the sale of elephants to foreign countries. He greatly increased the price of elephants. He abolished "the old custom of presenting an elephant to every vessel in which gifts were conveyed." Seeing a gold letter addressed to himself, he seized envoys of the king of Lafnka on the "pretext that they were envoys sent to Kamboja, or saying something of that kind," robbed them of all their goods, and imprisoned them "in the Malaya country"32. Though he well knew that 26 British Burma Gazetteer, Vol. I, p. 242. 27 A.S.B.

The reign of this king is not far removed from the age of Parakramabahu I, and the information about his reign as given in the Ciulavathsa should be reliable and authentic to a very great degree."

When Kassapa, "a prince of Jambldipa", sent costly gifts and a gold letter, he forbade his men to land, and ordered them with insults to take the letter back. One day he summoned the Singhalese envoys and said: 'Henceforth no Singhalese vessel shall be sent to my kingdom. Sign this statement authorizing us to kill any further envoys who come: otherwise you will not be allowed to return home.' The teacher Vdgissara and the scholar Dhamma- kitti he sent off in a leaky boat into the open sea. Once he took from the king of Lafnka's envoys gifts and goods sent for the purchase of elephants, and promised them I4 elephants and silver money; but he told mere lies and gave them nothing. He also seized by force a princess sent by the king of Lafika to Kamboja. THE ARMADA CAPTURES PAPPHALA, BASSEIN AND PAGAN Pardkramabdhu was infuriated. He summoned his ministers and said: - "The king of Arimaddana must either be captured or killed." An official of the public accounts, Adicca the Damilcdhikdrin, volunteered for the task. The king gave orders "without delay to make ready ships of various kinds, many hundreds in number... Within five months he had all the ships well built, and assembled them in haste at the port of Pallavavafika"33 A year's provisions were supplied, abundance of armour and weapons, sharp-pointed iron arrows, many hundreds of thousands, "for defence against elephants", medicine in cow-horns for the healing of wounds caused by poisoned arrows, antidotes against the infected water of swamps, iron pincers for extracting broken arrow-heads, also doctors and serving- women. Then he embarked his army, "numbering many hundreds of thousands", and sent off the ships, all on one day. "Subdued by adverse winds, some of these ships went down, some drifted on to foreign shores." One landed at 'Crows' island' (Kdkadfpa)34: "they fought a battle there, captured alive several of the inhabitants, and presented them to the king of Lafnka." Troops of five vessels, headed by Nagaragiri Kitti, "landed on the territory of Rdmai--a at the port called Kusumi35. They "slew from their landing-place the troops belonging to the RMmafifa country, many thousands of them in terrible combat. Like elephants in rut, they hewed down many coconut palms and trees, set fire to the villages, and laid waste a great part of the kingdom. But the ship under the command of Adicca the Damtilddhikdrin, landed at the port of Papphalama36." They fought a gruesome battle and 33Pallavavanika.

Vijaya (Palembang) and Mon kingdoms. If so, Parakramabahu's objective is seen to be a double one: to wreak vengeance on the king of Pagan; and also to occupy the Isthmus of Kra, and so command one of the main trade-routes to the east.</page><page sequence="141">Chapter VII I23 captured alive many people of the country, and plunged Rdmafifia into sore confusion. "Thereupon the Singhalese, with terrible courage, fearful with their swords, burst into the town of Ukkama" [presumably Pagan]," and slew the monarch of the Ramanas. When they had subdued the Ramanas and brought their country into their power, the great heroes mounted a splendid white elephant, fearlessly rode around the city keeping the right side towards it, and made known by beat of drum the supremacy of the Sovereign of Lafnka. Overwhelmed with fear and seeing no other protection, the people of RMmafifa gathered in council." They sent in haste messengers to the monks of Lanfka, with letters saying: - 'Henceforward yearly we will send as tribute any number of our elephants. Ye must be merciful and pity us, and move the Sovereign of Lanfka not to lay on us burdens we cannot bear.' "Through the intercession of the three fraternities37 the king of Lanfka was moved to kindness, and while the Ramanas sent him yearly numbers of elephants, they renewed a pact of friendship with him - a king who kept his treaties faithfully." DEVANAGALA ROCK INSCRIPTION, 1165 A.D. The date of the campaign (ii65 A.D.), and much in confirmation of it, is contained in the Devana- gala rock inscription (22 lines): _8 "On the ioth day of the waxing moon in the month of Poson (May-June) in the I2th year, when His Majesty was enjoying the royal splendour in the noble city of Pulasti [Polonnaruva]. Whereas a person named Bhuvandditta39, lord of Aramana40, when reigning, said 'We shall not contract a treaty with the island of Lanka, ' and whereas, when His Majesty had commanded 'Put men on board thousands of vessels, send them and attack Aramana', and Kit Nuvaragal4' in pursuance of the said command, had taken by storm a town called Kusumrya42, and when ...... for five months, the Aramanas sent envoys saying 'We shall contract a treaty' - two y*las43 were granted as pamnwu to Kit Nuvara- gal including Malabatuva... and the sowing extent of I2 amusnas and two pdlas in (K)itsenpavu, which were granted by having this inscription engraved on this stone, so that it may last so long as the sun and moon endure."44 INTERREGNUM Whatever deduction is made for patriotic exaggeration, there can be no doubt about the fact of this invasion of Burma in 1165 A.D., and little about its momentary success in the death of the king 37 Dr. G. C. Mendis (The Early History of Ceylon, pp. 84-85) says that Parakramabahu I, "enlisting the sym- pathies of the fraternity that lived at Dimbulagala, brought about a union of the three sects associated with the Mahavihare, the Abhayagiri vihar6, and the Jetavana vihare." These were, respectively, the Theravadins, the Dhammarucikas, and the Sagalikas. For these, see A. Bareau, Les Sectes Bouddhiques du Petit Vdhicule, pp. 205-244; and V.

Pardkramabdhu I, one of the greatest kings of Ceylon, had armies steeled in 25 years of war for the conquest of the whole island. If the Burmese standing army at the time consisted of only about a thousand men, as Kyanzittha had boasted45, the troops of the six ships of Kitti and Adicca (and there is no reason to assume that none of the other ships of the armada arrived) might well have effected a lightning capture of the capital; though without reinforcements, they could hardly have held the country in subjection for very long46. An index of the confusion caused by the invasion and the devastation brought in its train, is the probable fact that it was not till II74, some nine years later, that law and order were restored with the accession of Cafisf II; and with it comes a complete break with the past. For the attempt of the Chronicles47 to fill the gap with the reign of Min Yin Naratheinhka (Mant: Yani Narasinkha), supposed son of Kuld: kya and elder brother of Cajisfi II, is a mere makeshift. The name runs together the names of two minor kings of the dynasty: - Mait: Yanf is the Mait Yan of the inscriptions48, half-brother and predecessor of Tarukpliy, and doubtless son and heir of Uccand, who reigned for a moment in 6I7 S./I256 A.D. Narasifikha, or to give him his full name, Narasiigha Ujjana49, was the elder brother of Klacwd; Klacwd succeeded him in 597 S./I235 A.D.; he may have reigned for a few years before that. Note that in the list of kings given in the Thetsodaung inscription (see p. II7 at the beginning of this chapter), there is no king named between 7mtawsyaA and Narapati. To view the invasion and its consequences in due perspective, we need to review what little we know of the relations between Burma, Camboja, Ceylon and South India from the time of Aniruddha.50 The non-Buddhist Colas of South India were rulers of Ceylon from IOI7 to I070. In I070, after I7 years of fighting, the Singhalese hero Vijayabdhu I (Sirisaitghabodhi) expelled them, made his capital at Polonnaruva, and reigned over the whole island till his death in ino0/II. While still sub-king, fighting desperately against the Colas, he had sought the help of his fellow-Buddhist, Aniruddha of Pagan, who responded instantly. After his coronation in I073-4, with Buddhism at a low ebb after half a cen- tury of Saivite domination, he asked "his friend Anuruddha" to send a chapter of monks to render possible the ceremony of valid ordination. This they did "repeatedly", and so helped to revive Bud- dhism in the island. We can well imagine, not only the popularity of Aniruddha and his line among the Buddhist Singhalese, but also their disappointment to hear of the 'usurpation' of Kyanzittha, ac- companied, as it may well have been, by a preference for Mon monks and semi-Brahmanic cults rather than Singhalese. It was no accident that Kyanzittha was visited by a Coli prince - the then enemy of the Singhalese - whom he converted to Buddhism, and who, in turn, gave him his daughter in marriage. In his youth Kyanzittha had fought and defeated the Cambojans, conquerors of the Mons in Lower Siam. Near Lakkhiyapura (Lekhkaik, between Khabin and Kungyangon) was the "Camboj an market" 45Epig. Birm. Vol. I, Part II, Inscr. I, Face E, line 33. 46 The whole incident reminds one of the story (quite possibly historical) told by the Arab merchant Sulayman about the Javanese mahdirja's lightning-conquest of the Cambojan capital, and beheading of its king, in the 8th cent. A.D. (see G. Coedes, Etats hindouisgs ..... pp. i6o-i). 47 'Min Yin Naratheinhka'. - See U Kala, I, pp. 244-248 (f. 523-526 s.). Hmannan. (Susodhita ed.), I, pp. 3I7- 321 (I. 533-536 s.).

Kyanzittha and his line, though deeply indebted to Ceylon for Buddhist texts of the Tipitaka, had allied themselves with the Mons and the Colas, while Parakramabahu sought alliance with the Cambojans. They were, in fact, in opposite blocs. One object of the latter, it seems (if "the port of Papphelama" was near the Isthmus of Kra), was to break the hold of Colas and Burmans on the narrows of the Malay Peninsula, or at least to dispute their claims to control it. ImtawsyaiX, naturally perhaps but recklessly, set a match to this train of ill-will, first by restricting the gift, sale and export of elephants5l, and finally by severing relations with the Singhalese and trying to block their passage across the isthmus. Ceylon historians, accepting the dates given in Burma history books, have naturally assumed that the enemy of Pardkramabdhu was the aged Alaungsithu (Caisfl I))52. But 529 s./ii67 A.D., the date assigned to Alaungsithu's death in the Hmannan and Jdthbon Chronicles, is contradicted by U Kala, who dates it 520 S./II58 A.D. We know nothing of him from inscriptions after II5I53. He had in his Court, we know, two favourite maids of honour who may have been of Singhalese origin54. And apart from what we know of his pious character, in contrast to the cruelty of his successor, it is more likely that so large an architectural work as the Dhammayan-gyi should have been done before the Singhalese invasion than immediately after it. RESULTS: RESTORATION OF THE 'ANIRUDDHASI And what were the results? - The main ones appear to have been the following: - (i) the end of Kyanzittha's line of Burmese-Mon kings. (ii) the restoration of the line of Aniruddha, in the person of Caiisfi II (Jeyyasfira). (iii) his marriage to a princess, Vatassikd, very likely Singhalese, apparently on terms precluding her children from the succession. (iv) the supplanting of Mon influence at the Court by Singhalese. (v) the gradual but rapid withdrawal of Mon culture and influence from Central to Lower Burma, and the apparent death of Mon literature in Burma for three centuries. (iv) the steady growth, triumph and efflorescence of Old Burmese art, literature and culture. MARRIAGE OF CANSU II AND VATAMSIKA From Can'sfi II onwards the genealogy of Pagan kings is generally clear and certain, though of course there are moot points. Before him, it is often dark and doubtful, or rests on dubious evidence of late chronicles. Caiisii II himself, in his extant inscriptions, never once mentions his ancestry. But 51 "Ceylon also exported elephants, and the Ceylon elephant was much prized from very early times for its intelligence and docility, but the Ceylon race has the lowest proportion of tuskers (about 8 per cent of the males), and the only object in importing elephants into Ceylon from Burma, would appear to have been to secure tusked animals" (University of Ceylon, History of Ceylon, Vol. I, Part II, p. 473, n. 37). 52 G.

The son of that king called SrT Tribhavandditya- dhamrnaradja, peerless in Jambudipa, eminent among the multitude (?), was born in the womb of the greatly virtuous queen by name Vataitsikd. He was greatly virtuous and known as Ra-jasfira", etc. A few lines later he adds56: 1I pita me dhammakamoti I ratanapasuto... saddho atulyo I mata me rajavaihsagata paramatara nadti se~tha atulya I "My father was desirous of the Law,... devout, peerless. My mother was of most excellent kinship in the lineage of kings, the best, peerless." Who was this queen Vataihsika? - The name was a title. A Paga'n queen, specially favoured, wore a distinctive flower or ornament on ear or forehead, which served also as her title: Vatayhsikd in Pali, C7-chok-pan in Burmese57. Kyanzittha's "beloved wife", mother of Rajakumar, was such a queen: Triloka-vatahsaka-devT58. The Uchokpan queen of Cafisfi II had a brother, "the king's minister Sulaphirac59, father of a queen Caw, and of the minister Jayavaddhana.

I 94 a, lines 4-7 (598 S./I237 A.D.), said to come from a site half a mile south of Hngetpyittaung pagoda, a mile south-east of Shwezigon. I expect this was the site of the Thawpatkh klo, 'Butter-store monastery', 2 furlongs west of Tetth6 village, where the large stone dated 598-602 s., (PIs. IV 375, 376), a four-faced temple (No. 68), and two large brickmonasteries are still in situ. P1. 375 is badly perished; but Col. Ba Shin confirms that it certainly began with a Pali exordium "the same as that of P1. I 94 a, and very similar to that of P1. 9I." P1. 94 a, b is now Stone 48 at Pagan Museum. Its Pali exordium is much the same as that of PI. 9i, with some variations: thus it has the name Jeyyasiiro instead of P1. 9i's yasataro. 56 I.B., P1. I 9i, lines io-ii. This latter passage is absent from the other texts (Pls. 94, 375). 57 The Burmese equivalent begins with ai:, 'front, forehead'. It must have sounded like Uiw', the prefix for women's names in Old Burmese. So U-chok-pan is often corrupted into Uiw' choke pan. e.g. I.B. P1.

Having approached that thera, Ananda of endless colours, that minister Jayavaddhana, son of Subhardja, having divers qualities, faith, compassion, etc., caused a monastery to be made, adorned with the Buddha, etc.". . . Vatarhsikd was a great queen, of high royal birth, mother of two proud children, Rdjasfira and Gafigasiira. These, it seems, were not eligible for the succession, but remained for long influential figures at the Court, loyal to Cafis II and his successors. There was also a third son, Pyainkhl. Pyarhkhi is shown in original inscriptions62 to have rebelled after the death of Cafisfi II. Perhaps he was put to death; his son escaped to Tavoy, and had to forfeit his property before he was allowed to return to Pagan. The evidence about Vatarhsikd is not conclusive. Her nephew, Jayavaddhana, was a strong sup- porter of the Singhalese thera Ananda, in his reform of the Paga'n Church on the strict model of the Ceylon Mahdvihdra. - I suspect that the queen herself was a Singhalese princess; that Pardkrama- bahu (possibly her father), having wreaked his vengeance, came to terms with the Burmans. Caiisii II, a descendent of Aniruddha, was approved as king, displacing Kyanzittha's line; and the restoration of the old line was cemented by a marriage with a Singhalese princess, Vatarhsikd, who comes to Paga'n with her brother as a minister, and is made the favoured, though not the principal, wife of Cafisfi II. If this was so, they were not the only courtiers of Singhalese origin. On the site of the Tazaung temple, between the Htilominlo and Wet-kyi-in west village, RMjasdra's younger brother, Gahgasitra, built a "residential monastery" for his mother's elder sister Uiw' Thak Plan- Sani, the "Lady of Titinsan"63. She, then, was an elder sister of Vatarhsika. Her mother, we read, had as younger sisters the two "golden darlings" of Cafis-d I, Ray Sali and Miy' Sani, "Lady of the royal Fan."64 If so, the influence at Pagan of some members of the Singhalese royal family, antedates the accession of Cafis-d II. Sfillphirac, too, had a younger brother, Anantasfilaphirac65. Enough has been said for the present to indicate the prominence henceforth of Singhalese at the Pagan Court. With the queens and ministers came the Singhalese monks, who became increasingly influential in the latter part of the Pagan period. Came also the Singhalese style of pagoda-building, with the large cubic harmikc revived, and left its mark at Pagan66. "1 Mahinda, son of Asoka, was the thera who converted the Singhalese to Buddhism in the 3rd cent B.c. He established the Mahavihara at Anuradhapura, which became famous as the home of the purest form of Buddhism. Ananda claims to be a loyal follower of this school. 62 See I.B., P1. I 4214 (578 s./I2i6 A.D.); II i8611 (6I7 S./I255 A.D.). 63 See I.B., P1. II I47 a, b (604 S./I242-3 A.D.). The inscriptions, now Stones 38 and 37 at Pagaln Museum, come from the hall of Tazaung temple, where the holes in the walls from which they were extracted, are still visible. P1.

Mon leaders of the Church remained important at Pagan well after the time of Caiisfi II; perhaps they conformed to Singhalese practice. But their interest lay in the religion, and in Pali rather than in Mon; and Mon literature - always a delicate plant - seems hardly to have survived, except in the hills of North Siam67, where Sabbddhisiddhi and other kings of Haripui-jaya (Lamphun) maintained a precarious indepen- dence down to the coming of the Thai in the latter half of the I3th century. When the literature of Middle Mon revives in Lower Burma in the I5th century6, under Banii Thaw (Shin Sawbu) and Raimddhipati (Dhammazedi), it has changed so much as to seem almost a new language. It is sad to reflect that Kyanzittha's attempt to found the first real Union of Burma broke down under imtaw- syafn; and that thenceforth the country tended to split into North and South. GRADUAL FLOWERING OF OLD BURMESE CULTURE As to the flowering of Old Burmese culture at Paga'n, from Cafisfl II onwards, that must be the subject of another volume. 67 See G. Coedes, B.E.F.E.O., t.

BHUMISPARSA MUDRA The events leading up to the supreme moment of the Buddha's Enlightenment, appear in different forms in the oldest texts'. The Touching of Earth, whatever its original form or meaning, is always associated with the struggle with Mdra2, the final triumph, and the attainment of Buddhahood. In Buddhist art, the Earth-touching attitude (bhfimispars'amudrd) is found first, we are told3, on the Raj Ghdt stone relief, 2nd cent. A.D., now in Mathurd Museum. This attitude, common enough but far from universal in the sculptures of Sri Ksetra, reached its present pre-eminence in Burma's icono- graphy only from the time of Aniruddha, who never shows the Buddha in any other form. That mudrd is still symbolic, like all the oldest forms of Buddhist art. Hence its permanence. For a Symbol is charged with whatever meaning or emotion the spectator may invest it with. When art turns to Representation, as it does very gradually during the Pagan period, it becomes defined and limited: obnoxious, therefore, to changing taste and fashion. Yet Earth-touching in Burma's art is not only a symbol or an idea. It is an art-form in its proper right. To take a simple instance. In the Nagay'n temple (Pls. I95-201) the 27 previous Buddhas are shown seated in dhydna mudrd, both hands in lap, on leather mat, not lotus. The robe covers both shoulders. The 28th Buddha sits in bliimispars'a mudrd, on the cleft-lotus, his hands parted, his right shoulder bare. Asymmetry and tension in the one case; symmetry, simplicity and calm in the other. Earth-touching in Burma is different from the same symbol in neighbouring countries. In Siam it seems almost as rigorous as in Burma: but the Thai artist thinks much more of the Face than of the Arm; whereas to Aniruddha, and nearly all the Burmans after him, the straight downward-plunging arm is the nerve-centre of the whole. Did he remember, one wonders, the fine passage in the Ma- hdvastu4: - "Then, 0 monks, did Mara the evil one... assemble a great fourfold army, and standing before the Bodhisattva utter a great roar 'Seize him! Drag him! Slay him!'... Then the Bodhisattva, unfearing, unterrified,... removed from his robe his golden arms with netted hands and copper-coloured nails, 1 See E. J. Thomas, The Life of Buddha as Legend and History (London, I93I), Chapter VI. 2 Mr. A. B. Griswold tells me that the Thai name for bhilmisparyamudrc is just Myravijaya, 'Victory over Mara'. 3 A. K.

Then the great Earth roared and sounded forth a deep and terrible sound. Mdra's army so mighty ... melted away"5. CAITYA On the votive tablets of Pagan the Earth-touching symbol is generally associated with the oldest symbol in Buddhist art - the caitya. The latter symbolizes the death or Parinirvana, as the former the triumph or Enlightenment. On these two poles move the axis and philosophy of Buddhism. First and clearest in Burma's art, the two appear on some of the 'triads' of grl Ksetra, where the Buddha sits touching Earth between two large stupas8. At Pagan, as at Arl Ksetra, the caityas are disposed symmetrically, on either side of the seated Buddha. There may be any number of them, from one on each side to about eleven. In one instance (PI. 30 c, d) there are 26b. Two Bodhgayd plaques with Mon writing, now at the Indian Museum, Calcutta, (P1. 30 a, b), have 40 stupas on each side and 28 below: total io8, the number of auspicious signs on the Buddha's Footprint. Latterly, they seem useful chiefly to fill gaps in the design; for while they may be large, tall, beaded, ornate, with tiers of chattrdvali, they may also be medium in size, or short, or minute, vertical or leaning, as desired. From Pga times the architectural setting of these plaques begins to intrude upon the symbolism; but even so the Aikhara and arches generally build up to a caitya-finial. And there are indications that the Caitya was meaningful if not essential. When Aniruddha designed his 50-Buddha tablets (PIs. I2, I3), he placed a stupa regularly between the shoulders of his Buddhas. His son, Arl Bajrdbharana, did the same (P1. I5 b). Kyanzittha, however, placed umbrellas over his 50 Buddhas, using stupas merely to fill gaps near the top (Pls. i6, I7). On the fine plaque (P1. 67) showing the 28 Buddhas each with two adorants, stupas again are placed over the latter, between the Buddhas. On his io-Buddha tablet (PI. 9) Aniruddha adds io stupas to correspond. Even in the 'Eight Scenes', where Buddhist art begins to pass from Symbol to Representation, and the Parinirvdna scene is shown (as almost always in Burma) by the reclining figure of the dying Master near the apex of the plaque, the old symbol, the Caitya, is still generally shown above it, in the peak8. On two Chitsagon plaques showing 5 Earth- touching Buddhas, Caityas and Buddhas alternate in equal rows, now the one in the centre, now the 5 The Mahasamaya Sutta of the Digha Nikdya, preached on a much later occasion, shows striking similarities to this passage of the Mahavastu. Both, as Malalasekera points out (Dictionary of Pdli Proper Names, Vol. II, p. 564, n. 2), contain a similar list of Devas. Mara's army attacks in both. Dr. Pe Maung Tin kindly gives me his translation of the verse-passage in the Sutta: - "Mara's armies marched against all those heavenly beings who had come along with Inda and Mahabrahma. See the folly of the Black One. 'Come, seize them, bind them, let them be bound with lust. Surround them from all sides. Let none of them escape.' Thus the Black One of many hosts sent forth his armies, striking the surface of the earth with his hand and making a terrible noise, as though the lightning-charged rain had fallen thundering. But because he could not make them do his will, he withdrew his armies in great anger . ." - But there are differences. Here it is Mara, not Gotama, who strikes the earth with his hand. In the battle at the Bodhi tree, all the Brahmas, Devas, etc., who had come to sing the praises of the Buddha, vanish when Mara attacks. Here, under the Buddha's influence, they stand firm and strive to enter jhana. Dr. Pe Maung Tin is con- vinced that the Sutta account is the original: - "The Pali Canon was closed in the 3rd cent. B.C., after the conclusion of the Third Buddhist Council. I see no reason to question the authenticity of these last I5 lines." So also Mala- lasekera, s.v. Mdra, Vol. II, pp. 614-5. 6 e.g. A.S.I. igio, PI. XLVII 3. But on votive tablets at gr! Ksetra, caityas are also associated with the dhar- macakra mudrd; e.g. ibid., PI. XLIX 5. Compare U Mya, Votive Tablets of Burma, Part II, figs. 17, 22, 36, 38, 39, 44, 5I, 52 (Earth-touching); io, ii, 6i, 87, 88 (dharmacakra mudrca). 7 I count 26.

Chanda, Medieval Indian Sculpture in the British Museum (London, I936), Plate XIII. 9*</page><page sequence="150">I32 Chapter VIII other (PI. 6i a, b). Caityas may even appear on plaques where the Bodhisattva Lokandtha is the central figure (P1. 7 a, 54 a). REREDOS Where did Aniruddha find his models for these Earth-touching Buddhas ? - Ultimately, in North India, as the Ndgarl writing on the front indicates. More closely, I think, in East Bengal9. As for models in Burma, it is hard to say. The evidence is inadequate, at any rate for coastal Burma, the Mon country. Earth-touching Buddhas are found here, from Twante to Mergui, in great variety. But it is still not easy to date them. The laterite Buddhas are probably the oldest. These are of two types: those with reredos, and those without it. Now at Sri Ksetra, in stone images, there was nearly always a reredos, sometimes of megalithic size (the megalith was probably the original object of worship), behind the seated Buddha'0. In the Mon country the oldest laterite images (at Kyaik Ball, Kyaik Hkauk, Htamalon, Pada-gyi, etc.) were probably in the round. Those with reredos (such as the larger images at the Ndgasena temple2 near Rangoon), were later work, imitating Pyu. The Pagaln Burman certainly followed the Pyu in generally retaining, and giving prominence to, the reredos. On votive tablets the Pyu reredos often follows the Gupta type (shown, e.g., on the 5th cent. seated image of Sdrndth)13, with the makara (Capricorn) spouting at shoulder-level, the vydla or yali (leogryph) rampant in the middle, and the Elephant ('caryatid of the universe')'4 at the base. On one bronze found at the Bawbaw-gyil5, there is added a kfrtimukha in the apex. A similar bronze earth-touching Buddha was photographed at Pagan Museum in I9I2-I3 (P1. 434 a)16: its provenance is not stated, and one wonders if it is Pyu, or copied from Pyu. For though Old Mon mentions the makar and the bydll7, Old Burmese never does so; and even Modern Burmese has no name for the latter. But the Old Burman certainly knew these mythical animals, used them passim in his art, and must have wondered at them - posed so stately in their quaint heraldic stance, crouching, ramping, and spouting. Were they always like that? - Two wood-carvings, (P1. 423 d), found in a ruined temple east of Hsinbaung pagoda, and now at Pagan Museum, give his idea of how they behaved when off parade: the makara swallowing the hindquarters of the vydla, who in turn, is biting the elephant's head! Such mythical animals have not as yet been found in coastal Mon art. These adorable monsters - oldtime Terrors passed into Counter-terrors - gradually distill in art's alembic into pure form, cusp, gnomon, ogee, volute, finial - and fuse finally in Architecture, framing the Buddha-image. This architectural evolution goes back to pre-Pagan days, in PdIa India, Sri Ksetra, Lower Burma and Siam. The building in the background is a temple, usually surmounted with the Indian gikhara; it is, in fact, the Sri Vajrasana temple at Bodhgayd, the actual site where the 9 See N. K.

While the Buddha's form remains in the world of symbol and art, the frame is passing into representation and history. But Pagan art abounds in architectural backgrounds irrelevantly introduced - perhaps by a sort of hieratic necessity. See, for example, Kyanzittha's stone sculptures in Nanda temple. When in the Lumbini sdla-grove the newborn Babe is taking his first steps (P1. 28i d), he is not only royally attired, but must have a palace behind him. He is already taller than the palace and twice as tall as Brahmd and Indra beside him. When he changes into monk's attire on the bank of the river Anomd (PI. 289 b), there must be a temple behind him. When Svastika offers him 8 handfuls of grass on his way to the Bodhi tree (P1. 295 a), an elaborate temple is in the background. When Mdra's daughters tempt him under the Goatherd's tree (P1. 297 b) the tree itself is passing into a dome'8. THE 'ANIRUDDHA TYPE Consider next the Buddhas themselves. Touching earth with the left hand, which is not uncommon at Srl Ksetra, is rare at Pagan'9. Where it occurs (3 instances) in the Nanda sculptures, the image has no usnisa20. Aniruddha's demand for Force in the falling hand, ensured that it falls henceforward straight over the upper shin, not over knee or thigh, as often in Pyu sculpture2. Force is also increased by giving the image a strong square head, a tall full torso tapering to the waist, with rounded shoulders. Vertical and rounded lines are reinforced by the columns and trefoil arch enclosing the figure; and the horizontal base by mat and living lotus and indented pedestal. Equipoise and calm are fixed by balanced soles and tapered legs, not hidden one by the other as is usual at grl Ksetra22. Gentleness and life are latent in the mobile left hand resting in the lap, its contrast with the forceful right nicely breaking the rigidity of the whole. Earth-touchers at 8ri Ksetra, in bronze, stone and terracotta, often hold an almsbowl in the left hand23. This feature is rare at Pagan except where the subject requires it24. Usually the usnfsa is crested with a flame-niche25. In Aniruddha's own handiwork two or more types of background can be distinguished. The barest, at Khabin (Pls. 4, 5), just frames the image in a trefoil arch, resting on turned columns. A short straight gikhara with stupa-finial above, a strong indented throne below, complete the design, apart from caityas climbing in echelon towards the peak, and little streamers fluttering from it. In the Pagan plaques found near the Seinnyet (P1. 6 a, b), the architecture is beautifully elaborated, but at some cost to the grandeur of the image. The latter's body is shortened and less square, but finely modelled; the arch broadened, and given prominence by beading; the relief deepened by three receding 18 Dome-like trees are found, of course, from the earliest times in Buddhist art. See Coomaraswamy, Hist. Ind. Indon. Art, P1. IV Io (Besnagar Kalpavrksa, Maurya dynasty); Schdtze aus Thailand, PI. Io (Ayudhya, I7th-I8th cent. ?). 19 Left hand Earth-touching: - For 8ri Ksetra, see, e.g., A.S.I. 1910, p. 121,fig. 3 (Bebe); ibid., P1. XLVII, fig. 4 (E. Zegu); P1.

T.B., Part II, fig. 45; etc. - At Pagaln some late brick-and-plaster images in niches at Hpyatsa Shw6gu, Myinpagan, are in this attitude. 20 Col. Ba Shin first pointed this out to me. See PI. 3i6 a, b, c. The right hand is placed against the breast. All three sculptures have figures on their predellas, but the scenes have not been identified. 21 See, e.g., A.S.I. i910, Pls.

XLVII I, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. This is sometimes found also in Early Pagan bronzes: Pls. 436 e, 44I C, 443 a, c, etc. 23 See, e.g., A.S.I. i910, PI. XLVIII I, 2, 3, I0, etc. U Mya, V.T.B., Part II, figs.

It is conspicuous on most of the well-preserved bronzes, and many stone reliefs, especially in the Nagay6n.</page><page sequence="152">I34 Chapter VIII roofs with cusped corners, like the column's abacus and base below them. The Buddha's shoulder- nimbus strongly fills the arch, with a weak wriggle of beads below. Mat and double-lotus are enriched. The throne has gone, to make room for the fine squared base of Nagari inscription. The gikhara is tall and curving, with peepal branches surging below the flutter of streamers. The Shw6-hsan-daw type (P1. 6 c) reverts to the plain square Khabin model, as if to counteract the weakness of its oval. Pretty sikhara, nimbus and receding roofs are gone; and the arch narrowed to admit two powerful caityas at each side, climbing in echelon to the strong umbrella at the peak, with barely room for a few peepal leaves between. The prominence of the beaded arch remains. The keynote is solidity. There are over 30 types of Pagan tablets showing single earth-touching Buddhas. Not all are of the Aniruddha type. "The saiben Prince Yassa, favourite of the king," was apparently a courtier of Aniruddha; at any rate some of his tablets (PI. 23 b, c) are found, with Aniruddha's, in the Shw6- hsandaw relic-chamber. His two-plane tablet found at Pwazaw (P1. 38 a, b) has fine square Nagar! writing similar to that on Aniruddha's tablets found near the Seinnyet (PI. 6 a). And it shows the Aniruddha type of Buddha, but set in a ponderous frame; a lotus throne resting on an elephant-head, guarded by lions at the corners, framed between massive pillars supporting an ornate gikhara-arch, each abacus weighted with acroteria and conch-shell ornament. It has a sumptuous beauty of its own: but compared with Aniruddha's free and spacious image (PI. 6 a), it is crushed and dwarfed by the frame. Similar ornate plaques are found at Pegu (P1. 37). Plumper and softer types of image appear during Kyanzittha's reign, Muggaliputta's plaque for example (P1. 59 c). But most plaques of the latter part of the period, found at Minnanthu and Pwazaw, are coarse in comparison. It was still a living art at Pagan during the 'Mon' sub-period. NON-PAGAN TYPES Pagan being the capital, Pagain tablets are found, as one would expect, at Tagaung, Sri Ksetra' Khabin/Twant6, Rangoon, Pegu, Thaton, etc. But votive tablets, bronzes or stone images found at all these places show that they too were, or had been, centres of independent artistic activity. Apart from laterite, perhaps the oldest earth-touching Buddha in Burma is on the inscribed votive tablet found in Kyaik D6-ap (Bo-ta-htaung) pagoda, Rangoon26. It is a very plain, almost triangular relief with reredos, without architecture, throne or lotus-seat: a haloed, high-headed figure with large ears, bent arms, and robe conspicuous across breast and wrist - a vastly different type from Aniruddha's. In the same relic-chamber was a large oblong plaque showing scenes from the life of the Buddha27. Below the Parinirvana at the top, there is an earth-touching Buddha under the asvattha tree, with the Earth-goddess Vasu*ddhard below, testifying his merits by wringing out the two tresses of her hair. This shows a different and more 'up-to-date' tradition about Earth-touching than the one quoted from the Mahavastu at the head of this chapter, or the one usually depicted in Pagan art. Thaton, too, has distinctive earth-touching tablets; but these are closer to Paga'n. The Buddha- type is the one favoured by Aniruddha. In the one subscribed in Ndgari28, he sits in a beaded oval, 28 See A.S.B. I948-52, P1. III a. Arch. Neg. 4706 (I948-49). U Mya, V.T.B. Part I, fig. 86. 27 Arch. Neg. 7659 (I957-58). 28 Arch.

The Bin-gyi Cave tablet of "the three kalans"29, like several other Lower Burma plaques, is a study in linear panelling. The original reference of the symbolic mudrds of the Buddha was getting confused, it seems, even in Pyu times. Thus the dharmacakra mudrd, 'Turning of the Wheel of the Law', is the right symbol for the First Sermon, preached in the Deer-park near Benares, with Wheel and Deer often shown on the pedestal. But already on the East Z6gu stone relief at 8ri Ksetra30, which Sir John Marshall dated not later than the 7th century, though Wheel and Deer are shown on the predella, the Buddha appears to be touching earth, with his left hand. On one Pagan bronze (P1. 434 c) the Deer, on another (P1. 434 b) both Wheel and Deer are visible: but the Buddha sits touching earth, between two saints on the for- mer, between Lokandtha and Maitreya on the latter. In the Nagayon, the top line of painted panels on the inner wall of the corridor, illustrates seriatim, as their glosses show, the preaching of Dfgha and Majjhima Nikaya suttas: the Buddhas sit alternately, either touching earth, or turning the wheel of law. DHARMACAKRA MUDRA In early Buddhist art the Wheel alone sufficed as symbol for the First Sermon3l. In the 2nd century A.D. Mathurd32 and Amardvati33 reliefs show the Buddha sitting crosslegged, raising his arms wide apart as he 'turns the Wheel'. In the great 5th century image at Sdrndth34, he sits crosslegged in pad- masana, with hands brought together in front of the body; Wheel (side face) and Deer (couchant and affronted) are shown on the pedestal, together with the pan-cavaggiya disciples. This becomes the general model for Burma, as shown on the Shw6-nyaungbin-yo35 and Nyaungnibin-gon36 sculptures 29 Arch. Neg. 206i (1919-20). Cf. 3642 (1933-34) from That6n, Shw6zayan pagoda.

Again, on a pretty painting in the Thayambhu temple39 at Pagan, both picture itself and Burmese gloss below it show that the Buddha, seated in dharmacakra mudrd, is in process of converting Alavakkha Yakkha. Again, on an early Buddhist sculpture at Silagiri, Kyauk-taw40, in N. Arakan, the Buddha sits sideways on a bench in dharmacakra mudrd, conversing with a royal (?) figure seated at ease on the ground before him; this, too, does not fit the First Sermon. The simplest, and perhaps oldest, Burma instances of this attitude, may be on votive tablets found at Srl Ksetra4l and Rangoon42, with the Buddha seated in padmasana between two stupas or two vydlas. This type is common at Sri Ksetra. PRALAMBANiSANA The dharmacakra mttdra is also associated from an early date with a European style of sitting, not crosslegged, but with 'feet hanging' (pralambanapdda). This pralambandsana, says Coedes43, "is seen in the sculptures of Ajan.t44, of Kanheri45, of Kdrli46, of Elira47, and generally throughout all the rock temples." "Statues seated European-wise" he says elsewhere48, "- an attitude rare, not to say un- known, in Khmer iconography, are the realization in the round of the ancient images in bas-relief" [in Siam] "representing the First Sermon (Brah Pathamacetiya) or the Great Miracles (Ayudhya, Bangkok Museum)." The attitude was not uncommon in the early Buddhist art of Dvdravati. The late Pierre Dupont, in his valuable book on Mon archaeology in Siam49, points out that whereas in Indian cave-temples of post-Gupta period, this attitude of the feet is constantly associated with dhammacakra mudrd of the hands, in Dvdravat! Mon art it is associated with the right hand in vitarka mudra (pose of Argument). Here Burma generally agrees with India rather than Dvaravati, in combining pralambandsana with dharmacakra mudra, and the presence of Wheel and Deer confirm the subject as the First Sermon. 37Votive tablet.

Here the Buddha sits under a Bodhgayd gikhara with 9 stupas on each side. Below the lotus-stool for the feet, there is a Wheel supported by two Deer; also the Buddhist 'Credo' in Ndgarl character, probably Sanskrit. Of the six or seven similar types noted at Pagan (Pls. 50-53), five at least have Wheel and Deer. The shape of the sikhara, and thickness of the columns supporting it, vary; perhaps also the number of stupas; but these details are often difficult to distinguish. All have the Nagarl inscription. Several have short Mon inscriptions on rim or reverse, in Pagan-period hand5l. One (P1. 5I c, d) has a longish inscription in Pali. A bronze mould for making such tablets (PI. 5i a, b) comes from Myinkaba, and is now in Rangoon University Library. Several Pagan specimens (PI. 50 a, b, c) are large rimmed ovals in shape. P1. 50 a measures 7 in. high by 5i in. broad. They closely resemble a smaller rimless oval tablet (P1. 50 e), 4 in. high by 3 in. broad, recovered from Twante and now heavily gilded. This, in turn, closely resembles a rimless oval tablet marked "II 384", from Sri Ksetra. This tablet, now at Mandalay Archaeological Office, is said to measure 4 in. X 24 in.52. Another widespread type of votive tablet, clearly Mahdydnist in origin, shows the Buddha seated in pralambanasana, with right hand raised from the elbow, and left resting on the thigh. On each side stand slim crowned Bodhisattvas in tribhaiga pose, their inner hands raised from the elbow, their outer hands hanging. The precise pose of all three right hands - vitarka, abhaya or other mudrd - is often in doubt.Above the three figures sit three cross-legged Dhydna-Buddhas. Coedes shows two speci- mens53- oblong plaques arched at the top, and seemingly with grooved frame, height o m. o65 (say 2 in.), one from Khao Ok Dalu, Badalung, S. of Nagara Sri Dharmaraja, the other from Brah Path- ama. He notes their identity with a small but rather clearer tablet, one of three found in Kawgun Cave by Sir Richard Temple54. A more weathered specimen5, with the same grooved pointed-oblong rim, but larger (height 31 in., breadth 2I in., max. thickness I in.), is now in the Dhammayon, near the old NMgasena temple at Tada6gal6, Rangoon, excavated by U Lu Pe Win in 1938-39. It is said to come from that temple, but is not mentioned nor illustrated in his Report56. The Bodhisattvas on this tablet, as on the previous two, appear to be crowned. A similar tablet of worn, perhaps elliptical shape, with damaged top and rounded back, comes from Sri Ksetra57. It is marked 'II 397'. The Buddha's pose is similar, but the standing figures at his side, in tribhaiiga pose, have haloes rather than crowns: I am not sure that they are not Buddhas, and the scene the Twin Miracles (yamakapratihdra). All these tablets agree in having three Dhydna-Buddhas seated at the top. As for the pose of the raised 50 J. Siam Soc. Vol. XX (Part I), I926, Plate I (top) and p. I7. At Vol. XXI (Part 3), 1928, p.

This seems to be the commonest mudrd of such images on the Dvdravati side. One further tablet (P1. 53 c, d), presumably early I2th century, since it carries an Old Burmese inscription on the reverse, was found 2 miles S. of Thazi in Central Burma59. It is almost round, and shows the haloed Buddha seated in pralambanasana, dharmacakram'udrd, between two haloed Bodhi- sattvas seated in lalitdsana, their inner legs hanging, their outer flat on their thrones. Their outer hands rest on the seat behind them; their inner hands are raised before the body. Three or four faint lines of NMgari cross the top of the tablet, on each side of the Buddha's halo. Wheel and Deer are absent. Of single figures in pralambanasana, there was a fine old bronze statuette60, now lost, found in the relic-chamber of a ruined pagoda at Twant6, which showed the Buddha seated with both hands raised in the pose of Argument (vitarkamudrd). With it was a large earthen pot with lid shaped like a stupa. Just such another pot Aniruddha took back with him to Pagan, and used it to hold his Lokanatha and other votive tablets in the ruined temple (No. 44i) near the Seinnyet6l. Finally, among the Eight Scenes, in that of the Pdrileyyaka retreat, the Buddha is normally shown seated, often sideways, in pralambana'sana, almsbowl in lap, receiving the offerings of Elephant or Monkey. Apart from the Eight Scenes, the episode is commonly shown in painting in the temples of Pagan. In stone, it is shown on the S. image in the E. Shw6natha Thein at Pegu 2, in the background on the lower left side. At Pagain, it is shown on reliefs in the Nagayan (P1. I93 b) and the Nanda (P. 3i2 b), etc. DHYANA MUDRA Mahdydnists cultivated dhydna practices much more than Theravddins, who tended to disapprove of them. So perhaps the use or disuse of dhyana mudrd, the attitude of ardent meditation, gives some measure of the local potency of the two old forms of Buddhism. Whether at Old Prome or Pagan, the Hudrd is neither rare nor common. It undergoes some apparent changes. In this pose both hands and legs are crossed, open right hand resting on open left in the lap, and - at Sri Ksetra and in coastal Rdmafifiadesa - right leg on left. Only occasionally, on the known sculptures of Sri Ksetra, is the pose padmasana, with both soles level and visible63. Moreover, at Sri Ksetra, the right shoulder is almost always bare, the robe-flap falling over the left shoulder64. Occasionally the almsbowl rests on the hands65. 58 See Dupont, op. cit., figs. 498, 499. For the inscription, see Coed's, Recueil des Inscriptions du Siam, Vol. II (Inscriptions de Dvaravat!), 1st.

Here perhaps both soles are visible, and the robe covers both shoulders, as is usual at Pagaln. For the normal right leg on left, see V.T.B. Part II, fig. 2 (Khin Ba G6n gold image). 64 The 7th century gri Ksetra type for a Buddha in dhydna mudrd corresponds closely to that of 12th century Polonnaruwa, Ceylon, See A. de Silva-Vigier, The Life of the Buddha (Phaidon Press, 1955), P1. I14. 65 See A.S.I. 1910, PI. XLVII 5 and pp. 121-2, from "a small mound close to the Bawbawgyi pagoda." Arch. Neg. 422 (9go6-o7).

I090 A.D.) with 26 stone reliefs of Dhydna Buddhas, set in every alternate niche (PIs. I95 b-20I c). All are in padmasana, both soles showing, both shoulders covered symmetrically with the robe. They are seated on plain mats, only one on lotus. They would be weilnigh indistinguishable if it were not for the carved predellas below them. From these, Mon Bo Kay, the Conservator of Paga'n, has shown convincingly that they represent the 27 Buddhas previous to Gotama, according to the Pali Buddhavaitsa, Khuddaka Nikaya. By contrast, the stone reliefs of Gotama touching Earth ('the Enlightenment') show him sitting on double lotus, his right shoulder bare, his left covered with the robe-flap, and no predella below66. About II05 A.D., towards the end of his life, Kyanzittha built his masterpiece, Nanda temple, which includes the largest collection of Buddhist sculpture in Burma. Here, in the 3 lower rows of the 2 corridors (the ones above are difficult to see and count), there are i8o Earth-touching Buddhas, I02 Preaching Buddhas, and only 34 Dhydna Buddhas. Of these last, i8 at least belong to the series showing Gotama's life before the Enlightenment. They occur chiefly at the following moments: - (i) After the Fast, when he rejects extreme Asceticism and accepts Sujdtd's rice-alms67; here occasion- ally the almsbowl is present. (ii) In the 4th week after the Enlightenment, when the Buddha sits in the House of Gems (ratanaghara), meditating the Abhidhamma68. (iii) In a scene showing on the predella a royal donor preparing a feast or offering a document69. - I take this to represent the Buddha's second visit to Rdjagaha, when king Bimbisdra entertains him at the palace, and dedicates the Bamboo Grove (Velfuvana). The dhyanamudrd is also shown in the following earlier scenes:-(iv) When, just after birth, he is received by the 4 Brahmds in a golden net (P1. 28i a); (v) When after seeing the Monk (the 4th Sign), he sits in his pleasance thinking, and Vissukamma is sent to coil his royal head- dress for the last time (P1. 286 b, c; 3i8 c ?); (vi) When, the same night, he sits up in bed and sees his women lying like corpses (P1. 278 b); (vii) When, after tonsure, he sits waiting as Ghatikara, the great Brahma, brings him the monk's robes (P1. 290 a); (viii) On his first visit to Rajagaha, when, after eating his first almsfood at the foot of Mt. Pandava, he is visited by Bimbisara (P1. 29I C). (ix) A stone relief in Kyaukku Onhmin (P1. I42 c) shows him seated in dhydna mudrd, almsbowl in lap, under the hood of Mucalinda Ndga70. A beautiful old Chinese bronze (P1. 44i a), provenance unknown, has been for years in Pagan Museum. Here the Buddha sits on double lotus in padma'sana, dhydnamitdrd; but as if to counter the rigid balance of such images which Kyanzittha liked, the artist makes the robe swing diagonally down from the left shoulder, and the flap descend in an answering curve from the right shoulder. Another dhydna bronze (P1. 44i c), of unknown origin, is closer to the Sri Ksetra type: double lotus, right shoulder bare, right foot on left, long perforated ears. It looks as if the dhydna mudrd, at Paga'n, was gradually reduced in status, in Theravadin circles, from being the equal of the bhfimisparga and dharmacakra mudrd, to being the mark of old-time or 66PIs. I92 b, C; 296 d; 297 d etc. When the Buddha sits alone on lotus, touching Earth, under the Bodhi tree (the original symbol), the scene is the Enlightenment. When Brahma holding the umbrella, and Indra sounding the conch, stand by him, I assume that he is taking his first vajrcisana seat upon the Bodhi throne (Pls. I94 e, 20i d, 296 c, 304, etc.). 67 Sujdtd. Pls. 309, a, b, c, d; 314 c. There may be an almsbowl at PI. 293 c; 294 b; 314 d. For the scene, cf. PI. 202 c (Nagay6n). There is also a painting in PAhto-thamya, E. corridor (outer wall, near N.E. corner). 68 Ratanaghara. PI. 305 a, b. Col. Ba Shin suggested the identification, which I accept. The elaborate gilded double-gable architecture supports his view. 69 Bimbiscra donates Veluvana. PI. 3Ii a, b, c. 70 Mucalinda Naga. In the similar scene shown in Myinpyagu (PI. I52 C), the Buddha touches Earth.</page><page sequence="158">I40 Chapter VIII immature Buddhas. There were doubtless exceptions to this rule, especially in a few scenes where the mudrd had become normal. In the cross-passages of Nanda temple, between the two corridors and the outer wall, there are housed a number of interesting stone sculptures, perhaps rejects (for one reason or another) from the main series. Here one finds the dAydna mudra given not only to the Buddha before Enlightenment (PI. 3i8 b, c, d, e), but also to Bodhisattvas or Devas (PI. 322 b, c) and to venerable hermits (PI. 323 a, c, d). High up in the four Shrines there are I4 Buddhas in dhydna mudra- perhaps also honoured rejects. All sit on double lotus, without predella. Six have almsbowls. (PI. 3I4 c, d). STANDING BUDDHAS Standing Buddhas in stone have not yet been found at Pyu gri Ksetra. At Khin Ba Gon, on the left side of a broken terracotta panel, there is a headless standing Buddha, beautifully posed, his right hand raised in abhaya (or vitarka) mudri, his left probably holding out the lapel of his robe". In coastal RMmaniniadesa, on the other hand, at Twant6 (Kanbe)72, Pegu, Thaton and Kawgun Cave, some fine standing images in stone relief are found, mostly damaged or 'repaired', but surely older than any at Pagan. The technique of some of them is quite distinctive: the main figure (or figures) in high relief, almost in the round; the background scenes or figures flat, or sunk in low relief.

Their right hands droop in varada, their left are raised in abhaya-mudrd. There is a caitya above each of them; and, arching the top of the slab sit the five 'Dhyani' Buddhas in their respective poses. The stone measures i6j in. x 7j in. X 3 in.

The South image shows a crowned and haloed Buddha with right hand hanging in varada mudrd, and left raised to touch the shoulder. The elaborate reredos in flat relief contains many scenes, some hard to identify. On the left (the Buddha's right) is the Nativity, and the Parileyyaka scene below it, with elephant and monkey. At bottom right is the Taming of the Nalagiri elephant. At the top is the Parinirvana; and between, on each side, six or seven small panels, mostly with seated Buddhas.

The themes, often treated with originality, are probably taken from the 'Eight Scenes': the Buddha standing between Indra and Brahmd, the Taming of Ni.lgiri Elephant, the Nativity78, the Pdrileyyaka or other scenes added perhaps in the background. The treatment does not seem to be derived from PdIa art. In India, the Gupta stone type for standing Buddhas, realized e.g. at 5th century Mathurd, was rendered wonderfully in copper in the Sultanganj image of Bengal, 7jft. high79. This set the model also for Burma. The colossus stands gracefully, with right hand raised in abhayamudry; the climbing right palm answered by the drooping left, which toys curiously with an edge or fragment of the robe. Most of the old bronze images in Burma, at ;ri Ksetra80, Old Pegu81, Thaton82, Rangoon83, as well as Pagan84, follow the pattern closely; also some stone and terracotta ones. Our archaeologists have named the type 'Dipafikara': but it was not so limited in India or Siam. And the one certain Pagan representation of Dipafikara in stone (P1. I95 a), does not con- form to this type. The Lower Burma bronzes all antedate Aniruddha. Only one, perhaps the oldest, has a halo85. All except one have both shoulders covered. The one exception is the image found at the Bawbaw-gyi, grl Ksetra8", whose right shoulder is exposed. This Buddha also differs from the others in hanging his left hand at the side instead of holding out an edge or fragment of his robe at elbow level. There is doubt, too, about this and several other damaged images, whether the right hand shows the abhaya or vitarka mudrd. The Pagan bronzes, like the Sultdngan-j colossus, always show the abhaya mudrd. The four in the Shwezigon gandhakuti (P1. I73) are taller than the Bengal image - I2 to I3 ft. high with- 77 Kawgun Cave on the right bank of the Salween, 28 miles above Maulmein. There are two large Buddhist stone reliefs, doubtless Triads originally - the Buddha royally adorned in the centre, between the crowned Brahma on his left holding the umbrella, and probably Indra on his right. The whole right side of one Triad is lost, including Indra and the head, right arm and feet of the Buddha (Arch. Neg. 77I9, I957-58). The other Buddha raises his right hand in vitarka, and hangs his left in varada-mudrd. On his right stands a small negroid-looking Indra with his conch (?). Above, on each side, sit 3 crowned figures, all in namaskdra mudrd. Height: 41 ft., breadth 2 ft. 9 in.; thickness 7 in. (Arch. Neg. 77i8). 78 From Thawka garden, Old Pegu, comes a two-faced slab, illustrating the Nativity and other scenes, and the Taming of Nalagiri Elephant (?). See A.S.B. I940, P1.

Coomaraswamy gives details of the composition of the latter87: one would like to know if the Shw6zigon bronzes are similarly made. Most Burma bronzes have a high conical usnfsa. Those of the Pagan period are usually topped with a 'flame-niche' crest. One remarkable standing bronze from Pagan (P1. 433 a) is a crowned Buddha with rich ear-ornaments: he, too, has an usntsa crested with the flame-niche. All Pagan period bronzes have both shoulders covered. The 'Burma Mon' style of face is no less dominant in the bronzes than in the stone sculptures. But another heavier type88, possibly Burmese, is sometimes seen. Other variants occur in pre-Paga'n standing images. In Kawgun Cave above Maulmein there is a splendid, royally adorned, stone Buddha with right hand raised to the shoulder in vitarka mudra and left hanging in varada mbtdrd, standing between Brahmd and Indra. The scene may be the Descent from Thvatimisa, though there is no staircase nor kneeling Sdriputta; and in this scene it is normally the right hand which is in varada mudra. The more damaged sculpture nearby, also royally adorned, with Brahmd on the Buddha's left, very likely showed the same scene89. The normal Eight-Scene plaque contains two scenes with standing Buddhas: the Descent from Thvatirhsa and the Taming of Nlgiri Elephant. On plaques where Indra and Brahmd are missing in the former, or the elephant and kneeling Sdriputta in the latter, the two scenes are often hard to distinguish. To judge by Paga'n conventions, which rarely (I think) contravene earlier ones where ascertainable, varada mudra is proper for the right hand in the Descent from Thvatirhsa; whereas in the N.lgiri scene it should hang naturally by the side. In both scenes the left hand is raised to the shoul- der, or laid against the breast. At Pagan, the Descent from Thvatifrsa is clearly shown in the Kyauk- ku Onhmin (P1. I4i e), the Nagayon (P1. I94 a), and the Nanda (Pls. 300 a, c, d; 3i9 b). Here the right hand is in varada miudrd. A standing Buddha in varada mtudra also appears on a tiny leaf or petal of a bronze lotus (P1. 428 c), found near the Sw6hsandaw. There are usually 8 of these, one for each of the Eight Scenes. If so, this one should stand for the Descent from Tavatirhsa. Varada-mtdrd means the Boon-granting attitude. Was the Boon in this case the Abhidhamma Pitaka? The context does not always show what the boon was. Was the attitude sometimes imposed by the need for balance - between the palm closed against the shoulder, and the palm open beside the thigh? Two fine wood carvings at Paga'n Museum (P1. 4i9 b, c) show the Buddha standing in this attitude between two monks, on a grand throne supported by kirtimukha, lion and leogryphs. This scene cannot be the Descent from Tdvatifrsa90. Two old stone images of Thaton, the hamhsa and red sandstone images9l, are in this pose, standing all alone. There is also the slab foundintheThawkagarden of Old Pegu92, with the Buddha standing between two monks, and the remnants (it is thought) of two 87 Su4tJngan] copper: - "Now in the Birmingham Museum ... Early 5th century. Copper over earthy core ... The figure is cast in two layers, the inner of which was moulded on an earthy, cinder-like core, composed of a mixture of sand, clay, charcoal, and rice husks. The segments of this inner layer were held together by much corroded iron bands, originally I in. thick. The outer layer of copper seems to have been cast over the inner one, presumably by the cire perdue process; it was made in several sections, one of which consisted of the face and connected parts down to the breast. The whole weighs nearly a ton" (H.I.I.A., p. 240). 88 e.g. P1. 202 b. Contrast P1. 202 a, the 'Mon' type, in the niche next to it. 89 Kawgun Buddhist images: Arch.

So does one Nanda stone relief (P1. 3I2 c). The mudra was certainly popular at Pagan. In the corner-stupas of the great Sizana (Can-cana) stupa, built by king Ndtoimyd in the far south of Pagan, there are no less than 64 standing Buddhas in this attitude. A number of life-size wooden statues, crowned, are also in this pose. Found in various Pagan pagodas, they are now mostly collected at Pagan Museum (Pls. 42I, 422): They may be Bodhisattvas; they may be kings; or (as I should guess, but Col. Ba Shin disagrees), dead royalty reborn in Devaloka, and placed perhaps in temples which they built. The N51dgiri scene, with the Buddha's right hand hanging normally by his side, is authenticated by the following sculptures: - (i) a stone relief from the top of Shw6nyaungbin ridge, S. of Taunglonnyo village, gri Ksetra93; a stone plaque at Pegu Shwemawdaw94; (iii) a stone relief at Pagan Kyaukku Onhmin, P1. I4I f; (iv) another at the Nanda, PI. 3I2 C, (v) another at Pagan Museum. PI. 4I0 f. The great Pegu Nagawun image (see n. 73 supra) would also fit, though the right arm is damaged; the elephant is clear. A similar pose is found on a number of other sculptures, not only at Pagan95, where the scene is different, or has not been determined. Perhaps the oldest is a votive tablet from Padagal6 hill, grl Ksetra, but the figure stands alone, and the right hand is slightly damaged98. Apart from Eight-Scene tablets and a few showing the Twin Miracles, this is the only terracotta tablet found in Burma showing a standing Buddha. Other old images at Pegu, one at the East, and one at the West, Shw6natha monasteries97, may possibly fit into the pattern if their modern hands follow the original mtdra. Kyanzittha, more than anyone at Pagan, was responsible for fixing the symbols of Burma's Buddhist sculpture. As a vital part of his master-plan to teach the full range of Buddhism, he concentrated more and more narrowly on stone sculpture. This meant expanding the old Eight Scenes of the Buddha's life, to cover hundreds of new ones. He attempted this, cautiously at first in the Nagayon (C. I090 A.D.), then on an enormous scale in the Nanda (c. II05 A.D.). The Eight Scenes provided symbols enough for the Seated Buddha, but not for the Standing, as distinct from the Walking Buddha. For the latter, he followed the Ndlagiri model: right hand falling naturally beside the body, left hand raised from the elbow to the left shoulder or breast. To indicate motion he swung the ex- panded robe more to the wearer's left side, and less to his right. For the Standing Buddha he had to invent a new-old mtdri, transferring to the standing figure a pose hitherto confined to the sitting - the dharmacakra. The same perfect calm and balance on which he insisted for his dhydna mudrd, he now applied to the standing figure: a stance perfectly frontal, hands brought lightly together before the body, robes thrown equally open and displayed on either side of the torso98. 93 gri Ksetra, Shwenyaungbin: - A.S.B. 1939, P1.

The mudrd - similar to abhaya mudrd ('Fear not!'), with which on worn and damaged sculptures it is easily confused - exhibits one hand, or preferably both hands, raised from the elbow, palms facing front, but with thumb touching the tip of the forefinger. The late Dr. Pierre Dupont recovered many images in this pose in Dvdravati Mon sculpture99, and indeed regarded such use of the double mudra (the same in both hands) as a key-feature of that art. In Burma, images, seated or standing, where both hands execute the same mutdra, are always, I think, archaic. Here I should readily admit Dvaravati influence: with this differ- ence, that while standing images are commoner in Dvdravati, seated images are commoner with us. Here is a summary of the Burma evidence. From Sri Ksetra come at least 4 such images, 3 seated cross-legged, i standing; 3 in bronze, i in gold. All have both hands raised in vitarka mudra. The gold image, seated right leg on left, was found south of the Tharawady Gate, in a garden just outside itlOO. A beautiful bronze, seated in much the same pose, comes from the octagonal ruin at Kan-wet-hkaung-gon'01. Here the robe covers the left shoulder only. A similar bronze image, much cruder in style, looks like a Pyu attempt to copy an Indian original, with features exaggerated, bulging almond eyes, large hands propped on the robe, and legs awkwardly superposed, right on left. It comes from a site W. of Yindaikkwin102. The standing bronze image, found by the Shwe-nyaungbin-yo abbot near his monastery S. of Taunglonnyo village'03, wears a heavy pointed crown; but in all other respects he is dressed as a monk, with an indented line across the waist, and plain robe spreading behind the legs. From the relic-chamber of a ruined pagoda at Twant6, some I5 miles W. of Rangoon, comes a fine bronze image of the Buddha seated in pralambandsana, his delicate hands raised from the elbow in vitarka mudrd. His robe covers only the left shoulder'04. At Pagan, 3 bronzes and I terracotta illustrate this feature. One small weathered bronze (PI. 443 c, d) comes perhaps from Paunggu pagoda105, now mostly fallen into the river, just N. of the junction of Myinkaba Chaung and the Irawady. It is a Buddha seated crosslegged, right leg on left, with large hands propped at the wrist, raised in abhaya mudrd. With it was found another archaic bronze of the Pyu Maitreya (PI 444 e, f). I have a note also, written in Pagan Museum years ago, of a similar "small bronze of 'Pyu' style, headless, with tiny round legs and feet barely crossing, and both large hands in abhaya mudrd." Another bronze (PI. 443 a, b), from the relic-chamber of Shw6hsandaw, shows the Buddha seated on double lotus, right leg on left, with both hands propped at the wrist. The attitude here is double vitarka mudrd; the um-sa is plain, without flame-niche. The Shw6hsandaw, built by Aniruddha c. io6o A.D., contained some of the earliest Paga'n tablets and bronzes, including Pyu106. 99 See his Archeologie mone de Dvaravatf, figs. i6o, i66, 336, 357, 358, 36i, 373, 394, 397, 404, 42I, 425 to 455, 468 to 470, 5I5, 5i6. Text volume, pp. I77-i85. R. Le May, The Culture of South-East Asia (I954, London), on p. 66, admits that the Dvaravati Mon Buddha stands "occasionally with both hands raised" in vitarka mudra. 'Occasion- ally' seems too weak a word in view of Dupont's evidence. It was the rule, rather than the exception. 100 A.S.I. I929, PI. LI g and pp. i06-7. Arch. Neg. 3097, 3098 (I928-29). Height 4 in.

XXXIXf.</page><page sequence="163">Chapter VIII I45 The Hpet-leik pagodas at Lokananda, 3 miles S. of Pagan, are certainly older than Aniruddha. It was he, doubtless, who encased them each with a corridor to hold 550 unglazed Jdtaka-plaques, the finest in Burma. In doing so, he re-orientated the pagodas so as to face East, instead of North or West where the old stairways are still visible. At the West Hpet-leik, the north steps led up to the main niche in the anda or bell. Here a row of very antique brick-like tablets can be seen in situ (PI. 95 b); there are 3 similar ones at Pagan Museum (PI. 95 c, d). They have long tenons which ran back into the bell. Faintly visible in the centre is a haloed Buddha of Dvdravati type, standing with large hands raised, palms forward, perhaps in vitarka rather than abhaya mudrd. Of the three tiers on each side of the Buddha, the upper one may hold stupas, the two lower ones worshippers'07. At least three images with only the right hand raised in vitarka mudrd are known in Burma: a silver image from Sri Ksetra, Khin Ba Gon'08, where the Buddha sits on a pedestal, crosslegged, right foot on left, right hand half-raised in vitarka mudrd, left in the lap; the large stone Triad-relief in Kawgun Cave, N. of Maulmein'09, with the standing Buddha royally adorned, raising his right hand to the shoulder in vitarka mudri, and drooping his large left hand in varada mudrd; and a gold repouss6 image from Paga'n (P1. 424 e), with a heavily crowned Buddha standing with right hand raised to the shoulder in vitarka mudrd, and left hanging at his side. As for images in single abhayamudrd, we have mentioned already (supra, notes 80-84) the many bronze and other images of the Standing Buddha so posed, with left hand holding the lapel, and one (note 86) with left hand hanging; also the Mahdydnist votive tablets of the Buddha seated in pralam- bandsana, with right hand in either abhaya or vitarka mudrd (Sn ara, pp. I37-8). Besides these, from Sri Ksetra, Khin Ba Gon trove, come a round gold plate showing the haloed Buddha seated between lotus-stems, with right hand raised in abhaya m~drd110; and a headless bronze showing the Buddha seated in padma'sana, with large hands: the right is raised in abhaya m'udrd, the left holds the edge of his thick-folded robe"'. From Paga'n, "at a mound near the river bank, close to the south of the Taw-ya-kyaung monastery on the west of the Nanpaya temple" comes "a small bronze tablet nearly 4j in. in height, containing a Buddhist triad" (P1. 55 d)112: the central Buddha sits crosslegged, right leg on left, right hand held sideways before the body in abhayamudrd, left hand supporting the right wrist. On his right sits an earth-touching Buddha, lower in height; on his left the Bodhisattva Maitreya. Here the abhayamudra takes precedence over the bhiimisparga; it is, as Coomaraswamy says113, "the commonest early pose", regular for the right hand in early Kusdna art. In the same mound similar terracotta tablets were found, bearing a short legend in Pyu (P1. 55 a, b, c, e). Duroiselle suggests that they may be imports from Sri Ksetra: but since such tablets are found (see note on PI. 55) at several places around Pagan, as well as at Sind6, Prome district, they seem rather the 'swan-song' of Pyu art, still surviving into the Pagan period. 107 W. Hpet-leik tablets: see A.S.I. I907, PI. L d, and p. I27, where Taw Sein Ko suggested that they represent "Dipankara .. . prophesying that Sumedha and Sumitta, a flower-girl, would respectively become Prince Sid- dhattha and his wife, Yasodhara" (cf. A.S.B. i906, pp. II-I2). I think this unlikely. 108 A.S.I. I927, P1. XLI e and p. I77 (no. II). Arch. Neg. 2838 (I926-27). Height 31 in. Now at Kaba-aye pagoda, Rangoon. U Mya (V.T.B.

I0</page><page sequence="164">I46 Chapter VIII VARADA MUDRA Apart from Standing Buddhas in the Descent from Thvatiihsa and other scenes mentioned above (pp. I42-3), we find the following instances of varada mudra: - (i) at Sri Ksetra, LUyindaung hill, a stone Triad relief. In the centre a headless Buddha seated right foot on left, left hand in lap, right hand open on the knee in varadamudrd, with a small round object in the palm. He sits between a flywhisk-bearer and a praying monk. On the predella are a dancer and five musicians, one playing the harp114. Is this the scene of Indra's visit, heralded by Pafica- sikha, to the Buddha in the Indasdla Cave? (ii) a bronze image found at San-ywa, Khabin, on the W. side of Maung Di pagoda. The Buddha sits crosslegged, right leg on left, right hand open on the knee in varada mudrd, with a round object in the palm. The left arm, doubled at the elbow, grasps some object, possibly a roll or fragment of the robe. There is no mat115. (iii) a small bronze image (P1. 44I f) said to come from Pagan, now at Mandalay Archaeological Office. The Buddha, with staring eyes and high bulbous usnTsa, sits in padmadsana on mat and down- turned lotus. His right hand rests on the knee in varada mudrd, with a round object in the palm. The left hand is in the lap. The flap of the robe is conspicuous on the left shoulder. (iv) a stone relief with halo broken at the top, from one of the cross-passages of the Nanda (P1. 3i8 f). The Buddha sits in padma'sana on throne, between two women kneeling in prayer. His right hand rests, palm open, on the knee in varada mudrd. His left hand is held before the body in a sort of vitarka mudrd (?). - The scene may be that at Vesali, when his aunt, Pajdpati Gotaml, obtained his reluctant consent to admit women as nuns in the Order. GANDHARAN REALISM AND INDIAN FORMALISM The strange and lovely world of original Buddhist symbol - the world of old Sarnath (Benares), of the Bharhut and Bodhgaya railings, of the Eastern and Western Caves, and finally of Sanci - started to change under impact of Indo-Greek converts in the north-west of India. The Sakas gave their name to the Era, starting from 78 A.D., by which some Buddhist peoples of S.E. Asia have dated the beginnings of human history. Gandhara introduced, not only the Buddhist image, but humanistic representation of a large cycle of Buddhist story, including some of the Jatakas. But the native Indian spirit of art and symbol soon took over the controls at Mathura, together with hieratic notions of propriety which still dominate the arts of Burma. The Buddha image is admitted, but its height and bulk are doubled to distinguish him from those around him. The model changes from a standing Greek Apollo to a standing Indian Yaksa, passing into a seated Rsi. The head is shaven, the moustache omitted. The hair, if any, takes on schematic curls. The turban becomes the usnfsa. The irxard, or woollen tuft between the eye-brows, reappears as the searchlight from which the holy Rays proceed. The pralamband'sana barely survives, but mostly changes to crosslegged attitudes, and finally padma'sana. The grass-throne yields slowly to the panther- skin or leather mat of the Ascetic, and the double lotus of the Saint. The heavy robe of the cold North-West thins to formal folds, often leaving the right shoulder bare, adheres closely to the body, or becomes so transparent as to leave it almost a sexless nude, with mere heni-line at wrist and ankle. 114 A.S.I.

The image is now with the Kanb6 village doctor.</page><page sequence="165">Chapter VIII I47 Yet even so, in standing pose, the left hand is held forward from the elbow, as if to support the heavy folds. Soon grand ideas of Mahdyanism will complicate the iconography, when the humble bhiksu with his bowl (Patra), garbed in pagukiUla (rags from the dust-heap), is suddenly transformed into the Cakravartin or Universal Monarch. (We shall revert to this in a later chapter). Many of these changes, from Gandhdra onwards, are reflected in the early iconography of Buddhist Burma, as seen at grl Ksetra, Khabin, Rangoon, Pegu, Thaton, and finally Paga'n. Almost all the influences emanate from North India. Of the Three Jewels of Burma Buddhism, the Buddha Ratna derives as certainly from Northern India, as the Dhamma Ratana from Ceylon. BUDDHAPADA One ancient Buddhist symbol (by no means confined to Buddhism) - the pdduka or Sacred Foot- print - has continued to live an independent life in Burma, from Aniruddha's time down to the present day. U Mya has written a learned 'Note on the Buddha's Footprints' (at A.S.I. I930-34, Part II, pp. 320-33i, and PI. CLIII a, b) - an article singled out for praise by the Editor of that volume as one of "outstanding interest for all students of Buddhism, as well as of ethnography, religion and symbolology". Buddha-Footprints (Buddhapada) appear in the 2nd century B.C. on the pillars of Bhdrhutll8. They are always associated with the Wheel, as prescribed in the Lakkhata Sutta of the Dfgha Nikdya. The Commentary (a5tthakathM) on the Mahapadana Suttta of the same Nikdya, adds a list of auspicious marks on each sole, which covers most of the first half of the io8 Signs we find in Burma. The list is completed by the Jinalahkdra-tfka and the Anagatavansa-atthakathd, which, says U Mya, "may on stylistic grounds be placed in the 8th-iith century A.D.". He gives these very similar lists in parallel columns, with translations or illustrations. The early Pagan Footprints shown on Pls. 92 and 93, follow these lists closely. "We may begin our history" says U Mya, "with a stone slab bearing an impression of the Buddha's left foot. It was originally found on the platform of the Lokananda pagoda, and is now preserved in the Museum, Pagan. The Lokananda was built by Anoratha, king of Pagan (I044-I077 A.D.), and the Footprint... may be assigned to the same period. It was closely followed by four other Footprints: two found on the platform of the Shw6zigon pagoda, and the other two in the west porch" [i.e. Hall] "of the Ananda temple, both of which may be attributed to king Kyailzittha (I084-III2 A.D.)." The Nanda Footprints are too worn to reproduce; instead, we show two Footprints painted on the ceilings of Lokahteikpan and Theinmazi temples, Pagan. The former temple dates from our period, the latter shortly after it. There is abundance of later Footprints, both at Pagan and elsewhere in Burma, often showing NMgas with intertwisted tails guarding the edges"7. ll6 See A. K. Coomaraswamy, La Sculpture de Bharhut (Paris, 1956), pp. 22-28, and fig. 3i. For Amaravat! Footprints (2nd cent. A.D.), now at Madras Museum, see de Silva-Vigier, The Life of the Buddha, PI. I7. 117 A stone Buddhapada (date not stated; "conserve dans le Mond6b du Vat Vang na a Bangkok") is clearly shown on P1. XXI of Vol. I of L. Fournereau, Le Siam Ancien, and analysed at length on pp. 304-308 of that volume. After brief comparison with our oldest stone Footprints in Burma, Col. Ba Shin and I concluded that the io8 Signs are all there, but that the Thai took liberties with their order and arrangement, while the Pagan artists followed the texts more closely. On the basis of the photograph, Mr. A. B. Griswold attributes this Footprint (whose present location is unknown) to the art of Sukhodaya, c. 15th century (cf. Griswold, "The Buddhas of Sukhodaya," Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America, vol. VII, I953). For a I2th century Buddhapada at Angkor Vat, Cambodia, see H.

THE 'EIGHT SCENES' IN INDIA Before his death, in answer to Ananda's question, the Buddha mentioned Four Sites in particular which should be remembered: those of his Birth, his Enlightenment, his First Sermon, and his Pari- nirvdnal. But his disciples were not long content with only these. The drama and inspiration of his life, both before and after his Enlightenment, appealed from the first to Gandhdran sculptors. Soon after the first single images, groups of scenes from the Life appear, sometimes carved on 'vertical tablets' (iirdhvaPaqt!a)2. The human figures, including that of the Buddha, were all much of a size. The aim was to tell the story with realism. At Mathurd, where Indo-Greek art under the Late Kusdnas merges into Indian, the practice of combining scenes from the Life continued, on horizontal tablets3. The choice became more selective, and the range narrower. Symbol tended to resume the place of realism; and the scene was cut down to its barest elements. Symbolic shorthand made it possible to combine several successive scenes in one. Thus in one panel Mdra's Assault (which took place at night-fall) may be combined with the Enlightenment (which came at the following dawn), and even, incongruously enough, with the Temptation by Mdra's daughters (which occurred under a different tree, several weeks later). Under the Guptas, at Sdrndth, the same tendencies continue. The number and order of scenes tend to get fixed. When only Four Scenes are shown4, they are shown vertically, starting from the bottom, all of an equal size. Thus: - 1 Dfgha Nikaya, Mahaparinibbana Suttanta (P.T. S. Pali ed.), Vol. II, p.

This alone would account for the great popularity of the art-form, especially when reduced to portable size, for sale to pilgrims. From the 8th century onwards the Buddhist art of the Pdla dynasty of Bihar, Bengal and Orissa, must have had a powerful influence on Burma. "Stylistically" says Coomaraswamy7, "the art of the Pdla school is of high technical accomplishment, elegant and even modish in design. But even the stone sculpture approximates to metal work; everything is conceived in clearcut outlines, and there is no true modelling to be compared with that of earlier schools." Writing about the Eight Scenes, Duroiselle notes8:- "It is quite possible that the big stone slab measuring I5 ft. in height by 9j in breadth, which is said to have been found at Baragaon, the old Nalanda, and shown as figure 226 in Burgess' The Ancient Moniuments, Temples and Sculptures of India, Part II, is a prototype of ours" [in Burma] "with regard to the arrangement and general treatment of the scenes represented on them." 5 Daya Ram Sahni, Guide to the Buddhist Ruins of Sarnath (I933), PI.

Ghosh's Guide to Nalandd.</page><page sequence="168">150 Chapter IX Hitherto the various scenes, however arranged, had mostly been of roughly equal size. The P5la method9 was to unite the whole by giving main prominence to a central scene. This usually, but by no means always'0, was the Enlightenment. Here the Buddha, often crowned, sits in earth-touching attitude, on an elaborate throne which may fill as much as one third of the slab. The nimbus-arch about him is flattened to a background pattern. Above him, in the peak, is shown the Parinirvdna. The other scenes, greatly reduced in size, are pushed out to the sides: standing and seated figures in alternate tiers, distinguished, if at all, by symbol. In the bottom tier the Nativity (Maya under tree) is usually seen on the left; the Pdrileyyaka scene (shown by the bowl in the lap) on the right". Standing Buddhas in one or other of the upper tiers represent the Descent from Thvatirhsa (usually on the left), and the Taming of the N5idgiri Elephant (usually on the right). A minute kneeling Sari- putta or an umbrella above the Buddha in one case, or a minute elephant in the other, may or may not be present. The middle (or upper) tier may hold seated Buddhas in preaching attitude, either crosslegged or with feet hanging. They probably represent the First Sermon and the twin Miracles, but their relative positions vary, and they are often hard to distinguish. AT SRI KSETRA (TERRACOTTA) In Burma, the earliest specimen of the Eight Scenes is a type of terracotta votive tablet from gri Ksetra (East Z6gu and LUmyet-hna temples). De Beylie and Taw Sein Ko found the first fragments at Sri Ksetra, showing only the upper half'2. Two other fragments (see PI. 70 a) were later found at Pagan Shwehsandaw pagoda, where other Pyu relics are also found. But the lowest tier was still missing until I933-34, when two clearer fragments (PI. 70 b, c) were recovered from grl Ksetra, East Z6gu temple, thus completing the picture. Squared below, and arching to a point above, the rimmed tablet was over 5 in. high and 42 in. broad at the base. The Pyu have added a ninth scene - an extra earth- touching Buddha, with almsbowl, in the middle of the lowest tier: the scene is doubtless the Offering of Milk-Rice, with Sujdtd on the right approaching the Buddha, her hands in namaskdra-muidrd. Otherwise the plan is much the same as the Pala. Thus: - 9 For specimens of Pala Eight-Scene slabs, I have used the following: - Coomaraswamy, op. cit., P1.

XXII b, he is a crowned standing Buddha; also at PI. XXIV f. 11 At A .S.I. I922, P1. XXXVII b, the Nativity is at bottom right, the Parileyyaka probably at bottom left. So too on the large slab at Old Nalanda. 12 See L. de Beyli6 Prome et Samara, PI. V, fig. 2, and L'Architecture hindoue en Extreme-Orient (Paris, I907), p. 245, fig. i98, where the same fragment is said to come from the Lemyet-hna. See also Taw Sein Ko, A.S.I. i9i0, P1. XLIX 7 and p. I23: - "Fig. 7, when entire, must have represented the eight main scenes in the life of the Buddha; his Enlightenment at Bodh Gaya occupying the centre, and his Nirvana the top." In a footnote he adds that "in i906 a complete specimen from the same die was found." At BEFEO t. XXVIII, p. i63, n. 4, M. Paul Mus adds further identifications: the Descent from Trayastriims'as and the Taming of the Nalagiri in the upper tier, and the Buddha in dharmacakra mudryd in the middle right, "which could be either the First Sermon or the Great Miracle, according to the customary arrangement of these images."</page><page sequence="169">Chapter IX I5I Parinirvdna Standing Buddha (9ikhara) Standing Buddha (NdIdgiri elephant) EARTH- (Descent from Tavatirhsa) Seated Buddha TOUCHING Seated Buddha (dharmacakra mudrd) BUDDHA (dharmacakra mudra) Pdrileyyaka (monkey) Earth-touching Buddha Nativity (pralambandsana) | (with almsbowl). (Sujdta) (Maya and Pajapati) ANDAGU STONE SCULPTURES At Pagan, the Eight Scenes, when shewn together, may be painted on a large scale, i2 or 15ft. in height, on the walls of temples: for instance, on the S. wall of the Lokahteikpan (PI. 352), a temple of the Transition (early i2th century). They may be condensed on to terracotta plaques barely 3 inches high (P1. 69 c, d, e, f). The finest are carved on dolomite stone tablets (Burm. andagif). Eight or more of these have so far been recovered (Pls 400-406), mostly at Pagan, but also at Mandalay (P1. 403 b), Yamethin (P1. 405), and Tabayin in Shwebo district (P1. 401). Duroiselle had "no doubt" of such slabs "being imported into Burma from India;... but from which part it cannot yet be stated de- finitely"13. Elsewhere he adds: "According to Dr. Vogel (J.A.S.B., I9I5, pp. 30I-2), who describes a similar sculpture from Ceylon, these Pagan sculptures may be assigned to the ancient Magadha country, i.e. Southern Bihar, and to about the IIth-I3th century A.D."14. Perhaps the earliest andagii image-fragment found in Burma (not part of the Eight Scenes), was unearthed by Taw Sein Ko at Sri Ksetra, Sin-gyi-daing pagoda: "a small headless figure of the Buddha carved in light porous stone, which the Burmans call andagfi. It is well proportioned, and its workmanship forms a striking con- trast, in neatness and finish, to that of the votive tablets15."' These andagli carvings, widespread in Old Burma, and found once, perhaps, in Siam"', are obviously based on Pala art; and though fragile, are not heavy to transport. But one needs evidence of their manufacture in Bihar or Bengal. The Sdrndth carvings of the Eight Scenes were in sandstone; the Pala carvings usually in black slate. The minimal height of the former appears to have been about 3j ft.; that of the latter about 4i ft. The largest of our andaggi plaques is only 8 in. high. Beautiful as they are, they are less simple than the best Pala slate, more intricate and crowded. The general effect is like filigree, with restless interplay of light and shadow. The arch-frame of the central Buddha bristles with the hosts of Mara. Below them, on each side, stands a slim Bodhisattva, with right hand raised in abhaya mudra. The Buddha's lotus seat is always lifted by two eager, loin-girt Naga kings, rushing in from the sides - a lovely detail, rare in Bengal carvings17, but found on some of the pensive Buddhist sculptures of MahobM, Bundelkhand, in Central Indial8. Deeper relief is given to the side 13 A.S.B. 1923, p. 31. 14 A.S.I. I929, p. II3. 15 Taw Sein Ko, A.S.I. I9IO, p. ii8 and P1. XLVIII, fig. 4. 16 See Aytibus Asiae, Vol. XXII, I/2, I959, pp. 9-I4, G.

But perhaps the stone is different from our andagui: the technique seems more solid, angular and Indian. 17 Found, however, on the Arapacana (Mafnjusri) from Jalkundi: see Bhattasali ...

Ba Shin has observed) the Seven Sites (sattatthdna) around the Bodhi tree. THE SEVEN SITES Analysis of these 8 andagi sculptures shows the following features invariable: Earth-touching Buddha between standing Bodhisattvas (centre); Parinirvdna and (probably) Cetiya (top); Ndldgiri scene (top left); Descent from Tdvatirhsa (top right); the First Sermon (mid left); the Twin Miracles (mid right). Six times the Nativity is placed in the lower left corner, and the Pdrileyyaka scene in the lower right. Twice (Pls. 40I, 402 a) these positions are reversed. Twice the central Buddha is shown crowned (Pls. 400, 40I), six times merely as a monk. The main division is between slabs with one column of 3 scenes on each side (there are 3 of these, Pls. 400, 402 a, 404), and those with two columns (there are 5 of these, PIs. 40I, 402 b, 403 a, b, 405). The former are limited to the six scenes, eked out (in P1. 400) with Mdra's assault, and Mdra's daughters. The latter, with their two columns, show I2 scenes at the sides, and usually add a fourth tier at the base with varying content, so that the total number of panels may be i8 or 14. The two columns are distinguished by being on different planes, receding from the centre to the sides; and in one case also (P1. 403 a) by the inner column being stepped a little higher than the outer. But the space is narrow: so each scene is often limited to a single figure. The inner column shows little but the Buddha in one of his normal poses: standing in the top tier; seated in dhydna mudri, with or without almsbowl, in the znd and 3rd tiers. If, as seems likely, these represent the Seven Sites and Seven Weeks spent around the Bodhi tree'9, how should we apportion them? - The 3rd tier, right side, always shows the Buddha in dhydna mudrd (with or without alms- bowl) under Ndga-hoods. Clearly this is the Mucalinda NMga, S.E. of the Bodhi tree, who protected the Buddha from rain during the sixth week after the Enlightenment. In the 3rd tier, left side, the regular presence of an almsbowl seems to imply a meal. If so, it must refer, either to Sujdta's offering of milk-rice under the Ajapdla banyan tree (nigrodha) E. of the Bodhi tree, on the eve of the En- lightenment; or to the offering of rice-cakes and honey by the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, under the rajayatana tree (Buchanania latifolia), S. of the Bodhi tree, at the end of the Seven Weeks. The two dhydna scenes of the 2nd tier, where no almsbowl is seen, may refer to the first week, spent by the Buddha under his Bodhi tree, the peepal, meditating the Chain of Causation (paticca-samuppdda); and to the fourth week spent in the House of Gems, Ratanaghara, N.W. of the Bodhi tree, meditating the Abhidhamtna. The two standing Buddhas of the top tier would refer to the second week, when the Buddha, from the N.E., gazed intently (animisa, 'without winking') at his seat under the Bodhi tree; and to the third week which he spent pacing up and down the Jewelled Walk (Ratanacahkama), N. of the Bodhi tree. Perhaps the correct attitude here is the double vitarka-mutdrd, the pose of Argu- ment (PIs. 402 b, 405): but sometimes the inner hands are raised in abhaya; and the outer drooped in varada-mudrd - poses hardly appropriate to a lonely vigil. 19 According to the Vinaya, the Buddha spent four weeks near the Bodhi tree: the First under the Bodhi tree, meditating the paticcasamupp&amp;da; the Second under the Ajapala Nigrodha tree, where Mara's daughters tempted him; the Third under the hoods of the Mucalinda Naga, who protected him from the rain; the Fourth under the Rajayatana tree, where Tapussa and Bhallika brought him his first food. The later jftaka account extends the fast to seven weeks, inserting three more (Animisa, Ratanacaftkama, and Ratanaghara) between the first and second weeks mentioned in the Vinaya (see Malalasekera, Dictionary of Pdli Proper Names, Vol. I, p 794). Pagan always follows this latter version.</page><page sequence="171">Chapter IX I53 As for the 4th tier, added on four of the double-column slabs, (PIs. 40I, 402 b, 403 a, b), the original intention, perhaps, was to include the two Aggasdvakas, Sdriputta and Moggallna, kneeling or half- kneeling in adoration at the base of the slab. This fits the evidence of the two inner columns. On PI. 403 b two similar half-kneeling figures also occupy the outer panels; but on Pls. 402 b and 403 a, these become Bodhisattvas seated in ardhaparyaikadsana, either in worship (namaskdra mudryd) or their more normal attitude - inner hand placed on raised inner knee. On PI. 40I two scenes are added in this outer panel: the Fast (diukkhacariya) on the left, with two Devas instilling ambrosia near the ears; and on the right, the Buddha seated in dhydna under the hoods of Mucalinda Ndga - a scene already shewn in the 3rd tier, inner column, of the same slab. TERRACOTTA. MAHASALINI'S PLAQUE In terracotta, Aniruddha is not known to have set his seal on any representation of the Eight Scenes. But a person of his court, Mahdsdlini, produced a fine clear open type (PI. 7I), with two beau- tiful underlines of square Sanskrit/Ndgarl, and in one scene, the Pdrileyyaka, a short identification in the same script. Mahdsdlini is U Mya's correction of Duroiselle's original reading (from inferior plaques), Mahisyadevf, whom the latter took to be Aniruddha's chief queen. The original plaques were found, together with others signed by Aniruddha, at a ruin near the Mingalazedi. U Mya found his better specimens in a field S.E. of U Kywet monastery, at the S. end of Myinpagan20. The scenes are arranged like those of the Lokahteikpan painting, like the grl Ksetra plaque, and like the minority of the andagfi slabs - with the Nativity in bottom right, and the Pdrileyyaka in bottom left corners. The thera Ananda's tablet (PI. 74 a, b) is very similar. On other terracotta tablets the handiwork is often coarse and crude, 'bondieuserie' made cheap for sale to the poor and pious. Side-scenes are often reduced to single figures of the Buddha - standing in the top, seated in the middle tier, without even a Wheel or other symbol to fix them. But they have their interest and variety, bearing the Burma stamp rather than the Indian. Sometimes additional scenes are shown. At the base of PI. 69 a, b, the Buddha's lotus-throne is borne by an elephant-head and outward-facing vyalas. Beyond them, is a kneeling figure on the left, and a horse on the right - doubtless Channa and Kanthaka, symbols of the Great Departure. In the mid-base of PI. 70 c, as mentioned already, Sujdtd's offering of milk-rice is shown. The scene recurs in P1. 70 d, e, the Buddha sitting perhaps in varada mudrd, almsbowl in lap. The rare Paga'n tablet, P1. 74 d, e, f, badly weathered as it is, is the most original. It shows Ananda kneeling at the feet of his dying Master; below this, three elephant-riders of Mdra's army attacking; at the sides, larger than usual, the two-headed Ndlhgiri elephant, and the kneeling Syriputta; the First Sermon indicated by the thickness of the throne, which was probably faced with the Wheel; in the bottom tier, the Pdrileyyaka elephant clambering up to fill the Buddha's bowl. In the centre, between this scene and the Nativity, an Old Mon inscription seems to begin (I cannot make sense of it), and to end on the reverse with the lion-roar of the infant Gotama, taking his seven steps: - "I am the Lord!" THE EIGHTY SCENES The Eight Scenes, as defined by Pdla artists in India, were merely the starting point from which the artists of Pagan went on to construct, in wood, stone and paint, a whole cycle based on the Life of the 20 A.S.I. I927, p. I69; I93-34, Part I, pp. i85-6; Part II, P1. CV d.</page><page sequence="172">I54 Chapter IX Buddha. This will reach its fullest development after the end of our period, in the Burmese temple- paintings of Minnanthu and Pwazaw. In our period Symbol is still in the ascendent, though slowly forced, by sheer number of themes and the need to distinguish them, to admit Representation. The tentative beginnings are seen in the stone relief-sculptures of Kyaukku Onhmin (Pls. I4I, I42), Nagay6n (PIs. i92-202), and Nanda (Pls. 278-323), where sculpture reached its prime; in a few bronzes (P1. 433, 434); and in the paintings of Pihto-thamya (Pls. i66 a, i67 a, b), Nagay6n (Pls. 203, 204), Abeyadana (P1. 217), etc. Much of the early painting has perished, and nearly all the woodcarving. Stone sculpture is our main surviving source. Painting, which received a new freedom and a vast field on the acres of wall-space in the temples, from the first tended to subscribe its panels with written glosses, identifying the scenes. This immense field of certain Buddhist iconography at Pagan is still largely unexplored. If the field was undoubtedly immense, and the artists' energy prolific, one notices how slow they were to break the bondage of hieraticism and symbol, and give rein to their own imagination. Still, it was a notable achievement, in sculpture, to expand the single pre-Enlightenment Scene admitted to the Eight Scenes, into the well-known 'Eighty' of the outer corridor of Nanda temple. It seems easiest to base our survey on this, with its full and learned commentary by Duroiselle2l, and to glance back, where possible, at earlier efforts at grl Ksetra and the Mon country, and especially at the common source in India. DIPAIIKARA AND SUMEDHA (SUMATI) The story is told in the Sanskrit Mahdvastt as well as the Pali Buddhavamsa. It was a favourite theme in Gandhara, where it was counted as a Jataka. The scene was even sited there, at Nagarahara =Jelaiabdd22. The earliest illustration known to Sir John Marshall was on a panel at the base of Sikri stupa23, now at Lahore Museum. He dates it at the end of the first century A.D. H. Buchthal shows another panel from the same Museum, and notes that the same general scheme was used for the Conversion of Afigulimalya24. Coomaraswamy shows a similar panel in blue slate, "Gandhara,some- what Indianized. 2nd cent. A.D."25. There is also a small relief at Mathurd Museum26. All these show a common design, with Sumati (Sumedha) seen four times: - first, on the left, at the city-gate, buying lotuses from the flower-girl who, in his final existence, was to be his wife, Yasodhard. Then he is seen throwing the bunch in welcome to the Buddha Dlpaftkara. Then he is kneeling (not lying) at the foot of Dipafkara, with his long hair spread forward for him to tread on. Then finally he is shown up aloft, bending in worship. Note that already Dipafikara is shown a good deal taller than the others. At Sikri he is attended by a monk, not by the usual Vajrapani. "The use of continuous narration" says Coomaraswamy, "is unusual in Gandhdran art." The scenes are charmingly realistic. 21 See A.S.I. I914, pp. 63-97 and PIs. XXXI to XXXIX, "The Stone Sculptures in the Ananda Temple at Pagan." Duroiselle illustrates 58 of these sculptures; we give here the full 8o (Pls. 278 to 297), and shall number them accordingly with N. (Ananda) preceding the numeral, and with Duroiselle's numbering (D.) added, where necessary, in brackets. His notes on all these scenes are learned and admirable. 22 Coomaraswamy, H.I.I.A., p. 53. 23Marshall, The Buddhist Art of Gandhdra (i960), pp. 56-57 and fig. 73. 24 The Western Aspects of Gandhara Sculpture (1945), p. 14, and figs. 32, 33. 25H.I.I.A., p. 235, and PI.

I090 A.D.), in stone relief (PI. I95 a) and also in painting (Pls. 203, 204). On the stone, Dipafikara stands very tall in the centre, with right hand hanging and left raised to the shoulder. He is flanked by monks with almsbowls. All three face stiffly front. At bottom left a tiny Sumedha lies prostrate, not kneeling, at the Buddha's feet. His hair is not outspread. At bottom right, having received the prophecy, he sits in padmasana, facing front, in worship. There is no flower-girl. Of the two large paintings on the outer wall of the E. corridor, the upper half is lost. On PI. 203 we can only see Dipafikara's foot, with Sumedha prostrate on the ground to the right of him. PI. 204 shows the sequel, the earthquake when Sumedha "grasps the Law" and realizes his destiny. There are long Mon glosses below each panel. REQUEST TO SETAKETU IN TUSITA (N. i; D. i) This is the first scene shewn in the 'Eighty-Series' of the Nanda (PI. 278 a). The Bodhisattva sits, without the lotus-stalk, but otherwise exactly like the seated Lokandtha in Pdla Bengal and Burma art: lalitasana, right hand on knee in varada mudrcd, left before the body in abhaya mudrd. He is a god in Tusita heaven, 4th of the Devalokas: he is granting the request of the Devas that he be reborn as Gotama, the future Buddha. The attitude has little in common with the Gandharan version of the scene27. In Burma, this Bodhisattva (and Green Tdrd) pose occurs first, I think, in small oval or round terracotta seals found at Sri Ksetra, Kanthonzin-daung28. At Pagan, it is regular for the seated Loka- ndtha29, but is also found in other scenes30: see, e.g., the second tier of seated Bodhisattvas on the outer wall of the corridor of Abeyadana (PI. 230). Possibly another two-tiered stone relief in a cross- passage of the Nanda (PI. 3i8 a) shows the same scene: the Bodhisattva in varadamudrd above, and four Devas in prayer below; but who are the kneeling woman and children flanking the Bodhisattva ? The scene is certainly painted on a large panel in the S. corridor of Nagayon (inner wall). Here Setaketu sits in royal robes in padmdsana, dharmacakra mudyrd, with Brahmds on both sides in the top tier, and Devas in the lower two. MAYA'S DREAM. THE BATH. THE CONCEPTION (N. 2-7, D. 2-6) This includes several different scenes. "The Nativity" says Coomaraswamy, [query, the Bath preceding the Conception ?], "is represented by a figure of Maya Devi seated or standing on lotus with or without elephants pouring water from inverted jars; this composition occurs also in Jaina usage, but after the 3rd century A.D. disappears from Buddhist and Jaina art and invariably represents the Hindu goddess Sri or Laksml." "It is highly probable" he adds in a note, "that some older image of Abun- dance underlies both forms"'31. The scene in its Buddhist sense is clearly seen at Sdfici Great Stupa (early ist century A.D.), in the centre of the top architrave of the South (the oldest) torana32. Under the name kydk srT, 'the goddess Sri', it became, at Pagan, the central feature of the Mon arch-pediment 27 See Marshall, Bud. Art Gandh., fig. I02 and pp. 79-80.

The name became, both in Mon and Old Burmese, the symbol of splendour and good fortune; but, subconsciously perhaps, the connection of this symbol with Buddh- ism remained. To regard it as a non-Buddhist intrusion in Pagan art is a mistake. For the Conception, the old symbol was the crouching White Elephant who, in Maya's Dream, entered her womb. At the S. foot of Kyaik Hkauk, Syriam pagoda, is a laterite monolith of a small crouching elephant. This is perhaps the earliest Burma rendering of the Conception. In India, the scene goes back to Bhdrhut (early ist century B.C.) and Sdficl (early Ist century A.D.). In the Bhdrhut balustrade tondo34, Maya lies with her head to the left, the huge elephant above her to the right. At Safici35, Maya's attitude is the same, the elephant descending from the top right corner. But in the Gandhdran panel from the K5Jawdn monastery at Taxila36, Maya's head is to the right, and the defaced elephant (according to Marshall) is descending from the left. And this is also Maya's pose in Amaravati panels, where the elephant is sometimes missing37. Duroiselle points out38 that according to the orthodox text (Niddnakathd), Maya lay on her left side; so Gandhdra and Amardvat! are in accord with it, but not Bhdrhut and Sdfic! - nor Burma, which always, I think, makes her lie on her right side. At Paga'n, in the Hall of Nagayon, the broad niche in the W. wall near the S.W. corner holds a damaged stone relief of the Conception (PI. I94 c), balancing the broad niche in the E. wall opposite, showing the Parinirvdna. Maya lies on a tilted couch, her head to the left propped on her right hand. Below the couch, in the corners, kneel the four Mahra-jas, sword on shoulder. Above (or behind) the couch stand their four Queens, offering lotus-buds. In the top right corner above them, the White Elephant descends. In the four Halls of Nanda (P1. 306 a, b, c, d), the general plan is the same, only the decoration is more elaborate. The minute White Elephant appears to rest on the arch above Maya's head (?). In the 'Eighty Reliefs' of the Outer Corridor, a beautiful series of 7 sculptures are devoted to the different moments of the Dream. At first Maya is sleeping naturally (P1. 278 b). Her pose becomes hieratic, when the four Maharajas carry her to Manosildtala (PI. 278 c). Their Queens bathe her in Anotatta Lake (P1. 278 d). They tire her hair and anoint her (P1. 279 a). She sleeps at ease on a divine couch (P1. 279 b). Her pose once more becomes hieratic at the Conception proper. The White Elephant is seen below her head, about to mount the couch. The four queens are seated below (PI. 279 c). The scene was also shown in painting, now faint or badly defaced, in the Pahto-thamya, on the outer wall of the S. corridor, S. E. corner. High in Rajakumdr's temple, on the outer wall of the E. corridor, starting from the N.E. corner, there are 3 panels showing her transport to the rock Manosild, her bath in Anavatapta lake, and guarding by the four Lokapalas. In the Abeyadana, on the inner wall of the N. corridor, on either side of the entrance to the Shrine, there are two broad niches, now empty, intended for sculptures of the Conception and the Paranirvdna. The niche on the E. was meant for the former. On the W. side of it, a painting shows the Robing of Maya, with the four Queens in attendance 3Kyvak Ir above the Nan-paya windows: see Pls.

(PI. 2I7 b, c). The four Queens attend on her, and offer bowls of suckets. NATIVITY The essential feature of all scenes of the Nativity, is that Maya is delivered of the Babe as she stands under the sala tree (Shorea robu sta), playing the game of slabhanjika, her hand uplifted to break a branch. The pose is that of theTree-spirits in the pre-Aryan religion of India, seen, e.g., in the Cfilakoka devatd of Bhdrhut, early ist century B.C.39; or the Yaks! bracket of the E. torana of Safci, early ist century A.D.40; or the Vrksakd of Mathurd41, 2nd cent. A.D., or Pregnancy of the agoka tree42. Even the crook of the leg kicking the tree - a fertility emblem - survives in a Paga'n bronze (PI. 433 b, c). Gandhara, as usual, is more realistic. The Honolulu Academy relief43 shows Maya standing in the centre, raising her right arm to the tree, touching it with her left foot. On the right stand her sister, Pajdpati, and an attendant. Maya rests her left arm on the shoulder of her sister, who presses her side. The Babe, "with hands stretched out"44, emerges from her right hip, where Indra (with, perhaps, Brahmd) stands ready with wrapping to receive him. Marshall's relief, now at Peshawar Museum45, shows four figures standing on the left - the Lokapalas, he thinks - but the leader, taller than the others, should perhaps be Indra. Here Pajdpati does not press the womb. She is followed by two attendants, one with a waterpot, the other "gazing in astonishment". Gandhara may combine this Birth Scene with the figure of the haloed naked Babe below, in abhaya mtdrc, taking his first Seven Steps46. Separate reliefs from Swat Valley, tiny but exquisite, show the haloed naked Babe taking his first steps, with Indra and Brahmd on the right and two male figures on the left47. A rather larger relief shows the Bath of the Babe, with Indra and Brahma pouring water from pots above his head, and two women half-kneeling below48. Amardvati reliefs49, once more, are different. Here it is the left hand which is raised to the tree: the right rests on the hip, from which the Babe (not shown) is thought to emerge. The Four Regents 39 Bharhut.

No. i8: His lion-roar: 'I have no equal!' (PI. 282 b). No. i9: He sits in dharmacakra-mudrd, worshipped by all (P1. 282 c). The Pagan series is much nearer to Gandhdra than to Amaravati. And the Nanda Hall reliefs of the Nativity (P1. 30i a, b, c, d), where the scenes are compressed, are still closer. Maya always holds the branch with her right hand. But her left leg is not usually bent5l. The Babe sits crosslegged on the hip. Indra comes flying through the air with a waterpot. The three tiers, Brahmds, Lokapdlas and Men, are shown uplifting the Babe. He is seen again at the base, taking his first steps. Nearly all these details are seen in the beautiful sculpture in Myinkaba Ku-byauk-nge, which dates a little after our period. This even adds, as Duroiselle noted, a small figure of the earth-touching Buddha on his mother's head52. See also PI. 353 c, for a Paga'n painter's version of the happy scene, in Lokahteikpan temple. Among the earliest Burma carvings of the Nativity, is the stiff but rather lovely Triad sculpture from Sri Ksetra, Shw6nyaungbin ridge53. The three figures stand on a recessed throne: the tall Babe, already clothed and crowned and haloed, standing on lotus to the left; Maya in the centre, with both feet on the throne, and left arm resting heavily on the tense-fingered Pajdpati on the right. Maya's hip is furrowed at the point where the Babe issued. At Old Pegu, on the obverse of the two- faced slab, the main scene (the lower half) is the Nativity54. On the right, holding the arching bough above her, stands Maya in tribhaiga pose, leaning on her sister. Mid-left, mounted on a pillar, is the naked Babe. On the far left, there are three tiers. In the top tier is a flying god, Indra, pouring water (?); in the second, a deva seated crosslegged with arms upraised; at the base a seated devil (?) holding the pillar. The figure on the inner side of the pillar, is said to be an elephant, symbol of the Conception. The south stone at the E. Shwdnatha monastery shows the Nativity as part of the background detail, below the right hand of the Buddha in varada mudrd: just Maya and Pajdpati under the arching bough55. The oldest Nativity at Pagan, apart from the Eight Scenes, is the broken stone-relief at Kyaukku Onhmin (PI. I41 a). Here Maya leans on Pajdpati, both very tall and delicately carved; the tiny Babe sits crosslegged on Maya's hip; then below, royally attired, takes his first steps; there is a 50 Compare with this the beautiful relief from Swat, now in Peshawar Museum: "The Interpretation of Maya's dream". shown by Marshall, op. cit., fig. 54 and pp. 42-43: "Maya, who is usually present in later versions of this scene, is absent from this one". 51 As if by compensation, in PI. 30I c, Pajapat! crooks her leg. 52 A.S.I.

A Pagan bronze (P1. 433 d), showing two women (Maya and Pajdpati?) standing against a branching tree, may well be a part of a Nativity group. PRESENTATION TO KALADEVALA56 (N. zo, D. 17) A favourite subject in early Pagan art, where it appears first in a Pahto-thamya painting (P1. i67 a), on the outer wall of the S. corridor. The panel is full of detail and charm57: the palace and coconut palms, the dress and headdress of the two queens, the king's robe, the ascetic Kdladevala facing him, with his nephew Ndlaka behind. The writing below is in Old Mon: - "This is when the hermit Kdla- devila . the Bodhisattva, and foretells that he will become a Buddha". The 'Eighty Reliefs' of the Nanda include a simple rendering of the scene in stone, king and hermit sitting knee to knee, with four nurses below (P1. 282 d)58. There is a fuller, but damaged stone relief at Pagan Museum (P1. 4Io a). The scene was certainly a subject of Gandhdran art. There are two sculptures of it in Peshawar Museum59, and two also in the Indian Museum, Calcutta60. MIRACLE AT THE PLOUGHING FESTIVAL There may be three Paga'n renderings of this scene in stone. The first, and the most interesting, is the damaged stone relief in Kyaukku Onhmin (P1. I4i b), with its realistic picture of the old-time heavy swinging cradle, hung from the tree and worked by ropes on a pulley. The crowned Babe, deserted by his nurses, is sitting up in the cradle under the unmoving shade of the Rose-apple tree, and is worshipped a second time by the king his father and his foster-mother Pajapati. The damaged base may well have shown some of the truant nurses. The 'Eighty-Series' (N. 23, 24; D. 20, 2I) devotes two reliefs to the scene. In No. 23 the Babe in tilted couch lies hieratically asleep under the leaning tree (P1. 283 c). In No. 24 the tree is vertical, the crowned Babe sitting like a saint upon his throne in padmasana, worshipped by father and foster-mother. Eight nurses kneel in prayer below (P1. 283 d). Another relief, in one of the cross-passages of the Nanda (P1. 3i8 b), may show the same scene: four children, boys and girls, in prayer below; Suddhodana and Pajdpati in admiration above; between them the Babe magnified, sitting in padmasana, dhydna mudrd between two trees. There is a painting of the scene in the P~hto-thamya, on the outer wall of the S. corridor, confirmed by an Old Mon gloss: "This is when the reverend Bodhisat performs a miracle at the foot of the Eugenia tree"; and probably two panels in Rajakumar's temple (outer wall of S. corridor, top row, 2nd and 3rd from S.E. corner): - "The king, Sri Suddhodana, goes out to the .... . " "The Bodhisat remains seated cross-legged at the Fig-tree" - a mistake for Eugenia, Rose-apple. 56 More properly called Asita: see Malalasekera, Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol. I, pp. 208-9. 57 See U Mya, A.S.I.

The Mahdvastu (II, 45), however, places it, like the Nidanakatha, soon after the prediction of Kdladevala; but while in the Niddnakathd the child is still a babe, in the Mahdvastu he is a boy roaming about the garden. The Jinatthapakdsani (p. I5) on the other hand places it when the child is a month old, but does not give any reference. Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, I50) says the wonder took place five months after the birth. Our sculptures follow, of course, the Pali tradition". Marshall shows a lateish Gandhdran sculpture from Sahri-Bahlol of "Siddhdrtha meditating at the Ploughing Festival"62. The gentle pensive Prince, full-grown, with moustache, sits in dhydna mutdry under the narrow tree. On the predella "the festival is represented .., by a ploughman and his yoke of oxen on the right, with three robed figures at prayer in front of an incense-burner to the left". ATHLETIC CONTEST (N. 28, 29, D. 23, 24) The Prince's adolescence, culminating in the athletic contest, appealed in different ways to the Gandharan artist, and to Kyanzittha. The delightful school-scenes of Gandhdra, the Bodhisattva seated in his little ram-cart63, are forgotten; also the stark wrestling scenes64, and Devadatta's felling of the elephant65. Kyanzittha, it seems, had learnt to slight his own youthful prowess as a gymnast. Even the marriage with Yasodhard is omitted in the 'Eighty Series', though it may possibly occur among the 'rejects'66. Instead, we find three cold harem-scenes (25, 26, 27), distinguished by little beyond the varying number of palace-roofs (5, 7, and 9). Then comes a scene where Gotama sits thinking, in pralambandsana (PI. 284 d). Then a three-tiered scene (PI. 285 a) where he stands frontal, broad sword in right hand, little bow in left - no vivid picture of the contest, but a mere memento of his victories. The sculptors of the Nanda had their merits, but a dramatic sense was not one of them. From the moment of birth, when the Bodhisattva (contrary to the texts) sat in dhyana mitdra on his mother's hip, Kyanzittha (or his artists) buried the whole story under a veil of sanctimony. Gotama must always have a mind above his circumstance. By so depicting him, they robbed the Great Re- nunciation of half its pathos and humanity, its tension and its wrench. In the Pahto-thamya on the other hand (so Col. Ba Shin informs me), there is far more life and realism in the two panels on the outer wall of the S. corridor, the boating scene and the archery contest. RMjakumdr also has a panel on the top row of the outer wall of his S. corridor: "The Bodhisat shows his skill in shooting with the bow." THE FOUR SIGNS (N. 30 to 33; D. 25). "The Bodhisat goes out to the garden, sees the Old Man, and goes back home" so Rajakumdr continues. "This is when the Reverend One goes out to sport in the garden. He sees the Four Pro- 61A.S.I.

They meant ob- viously far more to Kyanzittha than the athletics. His artists had to exercise all their skill in depict- ing them. Mme. de Silva-Vigier67 combines all four scenes effectively on a single plate. Superficially, there is not much to distinguish them. Repetition was necessary to ram home their meaning. In taking the chariot - wheels, horse and chassis - to pieces, and reassembling them to suit his design, the Pagan artist shows all the ease of Ndgasena in the Milindapan-ha. For a normal chariot-scene, see P1. 3I3 b: 'The Bodhisattva on his way to the pleasure-garden'; there the interest is centred on the splendid Prince. In the Four Signs the interest must be transferred from him to the small figure (or figures) in the bottom corner. The artist does this by building a high throne above the chariot, and perching the Prince high beyond the scene's focus, weighted in that low corner. Thus these little figures - the Old Man pulling at his staff, the Sick Man leaning on it, the Death-bundle, and the patient Monk, take on importance far beyond their size. For a very different, but no less moving realization of the Four Encounters, set in the wide land- scape of the Gobi Desert, compare the silk painting from Tun-huang (Mme. de Silva-Vigier's coloured plate facing p. i6). THE DEPARTURE (ABHINISKRAMANA) The Departure from the city of Kapilavatthu gradually forms a whole cycle by itself. At Sanci Great Stupa, it fills the middle architrave of the East torana (early ist. century A.D.)68 On the left is the city, with the horse Kalnthaka, riderless, issuing from the gate, the groom Chandaka holding the umbrella, Devas bearing the horse's hooves to deaden the sound. The group, moving right, repeats itself four times; then, in the bottom right corner, the horse is seen returning, Chandaka bidding farewell. The Prince continues on his way on foot, shown by the sacred Footprints with the umbrella above them. In the early sculpture of Amardvati (c. Ioo A.D.), the horse, too, is riderless, and the scene simpli- fied. There are no ground-Devas to slow the march: only Chandaka with the umbrella, flying spirits, fleeing men, and Kanthaka bursting through the city-gate with all the excitement of escape89. In later Amardvat! reliefs (c. 200 A.D.), where the rider is shown, the movement is from right to left. On one of the simpler ones, Chandaka is leading, Brahmd behind holds the umbrella, and the ground- Devas reappear7. Movement is also to the left on the four-panelled relief now in the British Museum71, where the Departure panel, with its proud horse and leaping dancers, is on the left of the panel of the Sleeping Women - both masterly sculptures. In the late Gandhdran reliefs, movement is also generally to the left. One from Loriyan Tangai, now at Calcutta Museum, Marshall dates early in the 3rd century A.D.72. Chandaka holds the umbrella 67The Life of the Buddha, Pls. 32-35. But note that the order of the first two is inverted: the top left scene shews the Sick Man, the top right the Old Man.

The city-goddess is also present, as in the Mahdvastt. The whole atmosphere is peaceful, gentle narrative, not cosmic drama. An earlier relief in three tiers, now in Lahore Museum73, is more vigorous but badly damaged. In the top tier, says Marshall, "the Life of Pleasure seems to be symbolized by the royal couple seated side by side on a couch." In the middle tier the Prince sits alone, "in the pose normally associated with the 'Sleeping Women' scene. On his right are his horse and groom... on his left a very alert guard, grasping a spear". Below, much mutilated, the Prince is shewn full-face, riding away, with "the lithe and elegant figure" of Chandaka holding the umbrella, and perhaps Indra and the city-goddess standing on the right. At Paga'n, the 'Eighty-Series' of Nanda sculptures includes a group of I2 reliefs relating the De- parture (Nos. 34 to 45, D. 27 to 35). It follows immediately after the Fourth Sign. No. 34 shows the Prince seated in his pleasance in dhydna mudrya among his ladies (P1. 286 b). No. 35 shows Visvakar- man, sent by Indra to coil his jafc0mukufa for the last time (PI. 286 c). This scene is shewn again, I think, on a cross-passage 'reject', PI. 3I8 c, where the Bodhisattva with conspicuous coiffure sits in dhydna mudryd under carved gable-roofs. On his return by chariot (No. 36) he meets a messenger who brings news of the birth of his son, Rahula. (PI. 286 d). No. 37 shows him reclining on his couch, while four women, a singer accompanied by harp, transverse flute and clappers, make music below (P1. 287 a). In No. 38 he sits up in dhydna mudrd. Below, the women lie like corpses (P1. 287 b). In No. 39 he stands between the kneeling Channa (or Chandaka) and his horse Kanthaka (P1. 287 c). In No. 40 he takes a farewell look at Yasodhard sleeping with their baby son (PI. 287 d). One circuit of the Corridor is now complete, and the Series ascends to the upper tier of niches. In No. 4I the Prince addresses Kanthaka before he mounts him (P1. 288 a). No. 42 is the Departure proper: the noble horse and rider in the centre, Channa at the tail, four standing Devas supporting the hooves below, others riding the sky with lotuses (PI. 288 b). No. 43 shows the Prince riding on with Channa following, the full Moon shining above, and Mara cushioned in the sky, tempting him (PI. 288 c). In No. 44, under coconut and fan palms, they reach the Anomd river-bank (PI. 288 d). In No. 45 the gallant horse has leapt to the farther bank (?). Stately and stilted as these reliefs are, and technically limited, their two-dimensional beauty is undoubted. If they lack life and all its sensuous glories, the solemnity and pathos of Renunciation are deeply conveyed. The Amaravati relief of the Sleeping Women74 is far more sculptural, sensual and vigorous. But the Lalitavistara says that the Prince was reflecting "I do in truth live in the midst of a graveyard": and this is accurately what the Nanda scene presents. Duroiselle notes76 that the series omits one charming incident, dear to Paga'n painters. Kisd Gotami (the Mrigi of the Mahdvastu), perhaps a cousin of Gotama, overheard from her balcony the news about the birth of a son, and looking at the father uttered a cry of joy and admiration, using the word nibbuta, 'deliverance'. This so gladdened Gotama's heart that he took off his necklace of pearls and sent it to her as a gift. Both the Pahto-thamya and Rdjakumar's temple devote panels to this incident, just before the 'Sleep of the Women' and the Departure. 73 Marshall, op. cit., fig.

The 'Eighty-Series' tells the story as follows: - In No. 46 the Prince dismounts, takes off his royal attire, and hands it to Channa, Kanthaka watching (P1. 289 b). No. 47 is the Tonsure. He sits in padmasana, and holding his hair-knot with his left hand, severs it with the sword in his right (P1. 289 c). In No. 48, to test his chance of Buddhahood, he throws up the Hair-knot. Indra catches it, and carries it off to Tdvatirhsa76, to be enshrined in the Cfirldmanicetiya. Below, Channa kneels in worship. Kanthaka, saddled, paws the ground (P1. 289 d). In No. 49, Gotama sits in dkydna mudrd. Below, the great Brahmd, Ghatfkdra, brings him a monk's robes. Channa worships the Brahmd. Kanthaka waits, still saddled (PI. 290 a). No. 50 is the final Farewell. The Monk stands, renouncing the world, between the kneeling Ghatikdra and Channa. Below stands Kanthaka, alone, unsaddled (PI. 290 b). The story of Chandaka and Kanthaka was well-known to the Gandhdran sculptor. Both horse and groom were born simultaneously with Gotama, part of his equipment as Cakravartin. The finely modelled JamMl-Garhi relief, now in Calcutta Museum, shows Chandaka's mother bathing her baby, side by side with Kanthaka's dam suckling her foal, while she eats her bran-mash, and the other horses peer over their stalls77. Sculptures 39 and 40 in the same Museum complete the story: "Although a fragment", says Majumdar, "No. 40 shows clearly the scene of Farewell. The Prince is taking off his ornaments which he hands over to Chandaka, and his favourite horse stoops to kiss his feet" (Buddha- carita, VI, 53)78. In the Pali version the horse goes out of sight and dies of a broken heart. In the Gandhdran story Gotama obtained his Yellow Robe by exchange with a passing hunter (a god in disguise), giving his princely robe of silk in return for a reddish-yellow garment of rough kdsdya cloth79. At Paga'n the god has become the ex-potter great Brahmd Ghatikdra, who carries off the robe to Brahmaloka and enshrines it in Dussa thfipa80. There is no extant Gandhdran sculpture, it appears, to illustrate the Tonsure - one of the favourite themes of Pagan art. The earliest, at Kyaukku Onhmin (PI. I4I c), has a broken top. The Prince, contrary to the text of the Niddnakathd, has undone his hair-knot. He holds the tail of it at ear-level. He is already robed as a monk. In the Wetkyi-in Ku-byauk-nge relief now at Pagan Museum (P1. 4IO c), the pose is similar, the hair undone. The left hand holds the tail of it at shoulder-level. The stone relief in the E. Hall of the Nanda (PI. 3I2 a) has the better pose81: head slightly tilted; left elbow a little higher than the right. The right hand holds the sword, the left the hair-knot above the point of severance. Very similar to this, and perhaps the strongest, is the stone in the 'Eighty-Series' (P1. 289 c), with its curving nimbus continued above the shoulder. There are also two reliefs high up in the N. and S. Shrines: (P1. 3I3 c, d): the former the loveliest, with Indra descending from above; the 76For a Gandharan relief showing the 'Adoration of the Bodhisattva's head-dress in the Trayastrihs'a Heaven,' see Marshall, fig. 62 and pp. 46-47.

There is also a large painting in the P~hto- thamya, on the outer wall of the N. corridor (P1. i66 a); here the hairknot is undone. In all these renderings the Bodhisattva sits alone, in padma'sana. The 'Eighty-Series' adds another relief (P1. 289 d) - the Launching of the Hairknot. Here Col. Ba Shin notes the first appearance of the formal Buddha-usnfsa. If the Mon/Burmese artists of Pagan were the first to invent this design, they have no reason to be ashamed: for it is a noble one, full of dignity and resolve. For other representations, see the 2nd century trapstone carving at Kanheri Cave82, with Channa and Kanthaka in close attendance, fierce- ness of resolve made doubly poignant by the pathos of parting; or again the 8th-9th century stone- carvings at Barabudur, Java83, where the Bodhisattva, standing, severs his hair with a gesture similar to ours at Paga'n, and Indra descends and ascends much as he does on the Nanda reliefs. Note the pathetic scene that follows, where Channa weeping turns to depart, and Kanthaka looks back at his master also on the verge of tears, and the umbrella-holder, seated, strokes the Prince's foot. For grace and beauty charged with pity, no sculpture in the world surpasses these. FIRST VISIT TO RAJAGAHA (N. 52-55, D. 4I) No. 5I in the 'Eighty-Series', an earth-touching Buddha, is lovely, but clearly intrusive, filling a gap. In No. 52 the intense young Monk is on the march, without almsbowl, via Anupiya (PI. 29o d). In No. 53 he collects his first alms in Rajagaha, his noble bearing noted by king Bimbisdra's messengers (PI. 29i a). In No. 54 he sits and eats his almsfood at the foot of Mt. Pandava (P1. 29i b). In No. 55 Bimbisdra visits him and offers him the kingdom. He replies that all he seeks is Buddhahood. The king makes him promise that when he has attained it, his first visit will be to RMjagaha (P1. 29I C). Three painted panels in the Pahto-thamya, on the outer wall of the N. corridor, show Gotama collecting alms in Rajagaha; visited by king Bimbisara; and seated with hermits. There is also a large painting in the Nagayon (S. corridor, inner wall). I have so far found no parallels to these scenes in Gandhdran art. The six years of Austerities which follow, the Fast and the Breaking of the Fast, were also very briefly represented in Gandhara. THE FAST AND THE BREAKING OF THE FAST (N. 56-66.D. 42-47). An early Gandhdran relief from JamMl-Garhl (ist century A.D.), now in the British Museum84, shows the Ascetic Buddha seated like an Indian yogi on a grass-covered throne. Face, arms, and legs are wasted, torso almost to a skeleton. On his left stands Brahmd and, behind him, Indra, "recog- nizable by his distinctive headress. Observe" says Marshall, "his charming, almost girlish, face and the offering of ambrosia which he bears in his hand for the starving Bodhisattva. The lady on the right of the Bodhisattva is no doubt Sujatd, as Foucher rightly divined, with an offering of more human food in her hands... The group as a whole is very attractive - the finest, I think, as it is also the earliest, version of this episode that has come down to us." Contrast is obviously intended: Sujdtd is large and plump and matronly. The scene combines three elements: the fast proper, the gods' instilling of ambrosia, and Sujdtd's offering of milk-rice. 82 Kanheri: S. Kramrisch, Op. cit., P1. 36. Now at Bombay Museum. Height c.

Gotama had two long fasts: the one before Sujdtd's offering; the other after it, during the four or seven weeks spent around the Bodhi tree. Peshawar Museum Sculpture No. 79986 shows the single figure of 'the Ascetic Gautama' in extreme emaciation. This should imply the first fast: but the predella below shows the arrival of a cart and animals, and offerings by men to a seated figure in the centre. This must be the second fast, broken by the arrival from Orissa of the caravan of the merchants Taphussa and Bhallika, and their offering of cakes and honey. The well-known Sikri image of the Ascetic Gautama, now in Lahore Museum86, also has a predella which seems to combine both food-offerings: Sujatd and Punnd on the right, Taphussa and Bhallika on the left. In Muttra Museum the stone relief from Maholi village87 comes nearest to the Burma pattern: the haloed Ascete seated on a throne between two standing worshippers. In all these scenes the Gandhdran artist aimed at cruel realism; not so those of Pagan. The latter barely hint at austerity in the sunken stomach; legs and arms are as stout as ever. They lacked, no doubt, anatomical knowledge: but they also lacked, in the Pagan period, the desire to show pain, and they set little store by realism. In the 'Eighty-Series' the tale of events is as follows: -No. 56, Gotama's first teacher, Ajdra Kdldma (P1. 29i d). No. 57, his second teacher, Uddaka Rcmaputta (P1. 292 a). No. 58, his first disciples, the Panicavaggiyd or Five Companions - Kondafifa, Assaji, Bhaddiya, Vappa and Mahandma (PI. 292 b). No. 59, the Fast; his face and torso wasted: not his arms, into which two Devas rub ambrosia (PI. 292 c). No. 6o, he falls in hieratic swoon under a tree; a Deva kneels at his feet; the Pan-cavaggiya sit in prayer below (PI. 292 d). If No. 6i is not intrusive, we must accept Duroiselle's view: "he has recovered from his faint, and the bowl shows that he is determined to eat food now"88. There are other Pagan versions of the Fast. A broken stone relief at Kyaukku Onhmin (PI. I4i d) shows the emaciated Gotama sitting crosslegged in dkycna (?) mudrd, while two young Devas, with tubes in their outer hands, press ambrosia into his ears. In a cross-passage of the Nanda there is a similar stone relief with broken top (P1. 3i8 d), showing a thinnish Gotama seated on double lotus in padma'sana, dhydna mudrd, while two young Devas, with tubes raised in their inner hands, press the ambrosia in behind his ears. Another stone relief, in the E. shed of Pagan Museum (PI. 407 d), presents Gotama with ribs all showing, seated as above, but not on lotus, the two crowned Devas merely stand- ing in prayer on either side of him. Two Devas and three Devis sit with lotus-stalks below. Finally, in the W. corridor of Myinpyagu temple (P1. I52 C), among the life-size brick-and-stucco seated Buddhas, there is a damaged image of Gotama in dydina mudrn, practising austerities. SUJATA'S OFFERING The story, beautifully told in prose in the Middle Mon Ajapaa inscription near Pegu89, was no doubt popular at Paga'n; but there the sculptors were content with a bare memento of the scene, mostly relegated to predellas.

A Kyaukku Onhmin relief with broken reredos (PI. 142 a) shows a strong Buddha seated in pad- masana on double lotus, left hand in lap, right hand taking food out of an almsbowl set before him. There is no predella showing Sujdtd or the goats; so it is doubtful if the scene is the eating of Sujdta's milk-rice. As shown in the Nagayon, N. corridor (P1. 202 c), the scene is unmistakeable. Gotama sits above in dhydna mudrd, without lotus. In the centre of the predella, facing right, a woman kneels intently worshipping or praying, between two horned goats. The 'goatherds' tree', Ajapdla, is con- spicuously absent. The scene appears to combine that of Sujitd making her original prayer to the god of the Goatherds' Banyan Tree (nigrodha, Ficus indica); and also that of her maid, Putad, sent to prepare a place for the thank-offering, and finding the tree resplendent, with Gotama seated under it. The story is one of the i6 basic scenes which Kyanzittha displayed in all four Halls of the Nanda (P1. 309 a, b, c, d). These all show Gotama seated under a tree on double lotus, in padmasana, dhydna mudrd. On the predella, left and centre, are two women (Punni and Sujdtd) facing a tethered goat. The woman in the centre has a stick over her shoulder. Two stone reliefs high up in the E. and W. Shrines of the Nanda, may also illustrate the scene (P1. 3I4 c, d). Here Gotama sits as above; below, pressed against the double lotus, are two small women facing each other, kneeling in prayer. In the 'Eighty-Series' there has been, I think, both loss and confusion. No. 63 (D 47, PI. 293 c) is the main illustration: the two women kneeling on the predella, Sujdtd on the left holding up her golden bowl; Gotama, above, already has an almsbowl. No. 64 (P1. 293 d) appears to be intrusive. Did the original relief show the Bathing at Suppatittha ford ? No. 65 (PI. 294 a) - almost identical with No. 54 (PI. 29i b) - shows him eating the milk-rice. Nos. 66 and 67 (PI. 294 b, c) may also be intrusive. Then comes the March to the Bodhi Tree. But after the Casting of the Grass, in No. 74 (P1. 296 b) Sujatd re-appears with a water-pot before the earth-touching Buddha. And this is followed by the First Sitting on the Throne. No. 74 seems clearly out of place. There are also paintings of Sujdtd's offering in the Pahto-thamya (outer wall of E. corridor, near N.E. corner), and in Rdjakumdr's temple (outer wall of N. corridor, top row, near N.W. corner). A unique relief in the Hall of the Nagayon (P1. i93 C) shows the sequel: the Launching of the golden Almsbowl in the Nerafijard river, to join the other three launched by the previous Buddhas of this kalpa, all reverently preserved by Kcaa, the old Ndga king. Gotama is shown on the riverbank (right hand lost, left before the body). The predella shows three successive scenes. On the left the bowl is sinking. On the right KdIa is sleeping. In the centre he sits up and worships the Four Bowls, wel- coming the advent of a Fourth Buddha. Kdlika, the Ndga king, appears also in Gandhdran art. After eating the milk-rice and crossing the river Niran-jand (Pali Neranfjard), Gotama sets out for the Bodhi tree. On his way, says Spooner9l, "it so chanced that he passed the abode of Kdlika, the king of the Ndgas. Perceiving the effulgence of the Master's body, Kdlika and his wife Suvarnaprabhdsd issued forth, and after uttering a hymn of 90 de Silva-Vigier, Pls. 57, 58. Zimmer, II, P1. 484 a, b.

Marshall illustrates the story with a sculpture from Sikri, now in Lahore Museum92. APPROACH TO THE BODHI TREE (N. 68-75, D. 48-50) The 'Eighty-Series' of the Nanda lingers over this crucial theme. No. 68 is a fine original sculpture showing Gotama, resolved, with both hands raised in vydkhydna and vitarka mudrd, moving slowly left under the fixed umbrella, between Devas bearing poles with gonfalons (PI. 294 d). In No. 69 he faces front with palms drooped, receiving the eight handfuls of grass which Sotthiya, standing on the left, is giving him (PI. 295 a). Arrived at the asvattha Peepal Tree, he stands or moves in doubt (Nos. 70, 7I, 72) whether to approach it from S., W., or N. (P1. 295 b, c, d). In No. 73, approaching from the E., he casts the grass (PI. 296 a), and lo! a throne arises. In No. 75 (we omit No. 74, which is out of place), he takes his Earth-touching Seat, while Brahmd on the right stands holding the umbrella, and Indra on the left sounds his conch (vijayuttara-sankka) (P1. 296 c). This last scene was clearly a fav- ourite of Kyanzittha, confident, himself also, that he was bound for Buddhahood. Eight more reliefs - Nos. VIII and IX in each of the four Halls of Nanda, placed to left and right of all four entrances to the temple proper - show this scene with little variation (PI. 304, a, b, c, d); also two more in the Nagayon (Pls. I94 e, 20i d). In every case the Buddha sits in Earth-touching attitude. The grass-cutter Svastika (Pali Sotthiya) and his gift of grass (symbol of the Rishi's throne) was well-known to Gandhdran artists. Marshall gives two very different illustrations. One is the Peshawar Museum relief, a realistic picture, showing Gotama with rimmed halo and "outsize usifssa", standing between Svastika (on the left, as at Pagan) and Vajrapdni (on the right)93. The other is the Lahore Museum relief from Sikri94, where formal Indian influence is far more obvious. There is also a sculpture of the subject, it seems, No. 45 in the Indian Museum95. Majumdar illustrates another sculpture there, No. 46, a relief which looks as if it came from Sikri: - "It shows Gautama approaching the seat under the Bodhi tree (Bodhimanda) on which grass has been spread. The bust appearing below the seat is that of the Earth-goddess who was asked by Gautama to bear witness to his having reached the stage preceding Enlightenment. Behind him is Mdra, the Evil One, carrying a sword, and there is also a devotee standing at the right hand corner. The figures to the left are probably Mdra, his wife, and other members of his party... Two angels are seen flying towards the tree96." An firdhvapatta at Peshawar Museum, Sculpture No. 787, has a top panel showing a similar scene, described by Spooner as follows: - "The seat itself is shown to be already strewn with grass. It is therefore now prepared. The expectant Earth-goddess is depicted on the front face of the seat, with merely her head and shoulders rising from the ground - which is another Greek touch, while the small figure in the back- ground is the Spirit of the Bodhi-tree. Unfortunately, the right hand side of the stone is lost, but the left shows a divine couple... gods of the Suddhdvdsa Heaven."97 92 Buddhist Art of Gandhdra, fig. 75 and p. 57. 93 ibid., fig. 6i and pp. 46-47; one of the 'Mardan group'; perhaps from Swat (pp. 40-4I). 94 ibid., fig. 76 and pp. 57-58. 95 N.

(The Naga choir is illustrated in Gandhdra sculpture, in the Kdfir-kot panel now at the British Museum98; but what the occasion of the concert was, is not clear.) But at sunset on that day, when Mara (the god of Death) launched his attack, they all, Kala, Indra, Brahma, etc., took fright and fled. After Mara's defeat they returned to celebrate the Buddha's triumph. The earliest version of the scene may be on the Prasenajit Pillar, S. torana of Bhdrhut Stupa99 (now at the Indian Museum). In the top panel is the asvattha tree with gods whistling and waving. Below this, a throne with two Iriralna symbols, worshippers, and a free-standing column with elephant- capital. The old gloss says "Enlightenment of the Lord kikyamuni." Below this, a panel shows the adoration of various divinities; and below this, their dance-concert. At Sdnfci (Great Stupa, W. toraita, lowest architrave) the scene is much more warlike. It "extends over the three sections of the architrave," says Marshall. "In the centre is the temple of Bodh-Gayd with the pipal tree and the throne of the Buddha within; to the right, the armies of Mara fleeing discomfited from the Buddha; to the left, the Devas celebrating the victory..."' 00 The N. torana middle architrave, less warlike, shows "the hosts of Mara's demons, personifying the vices, the passions and the fears of mankind. The vigour and humour with which these fantastic beings are portrayed is ... far more forceful than anything of the kind produced by the artists of Gandhdra."101 The Gandhdran scene Marshall illustrates with a sculpture of the 'Marddn group', now at Peshawar Museum102. The Buddha sits "on his grass-strewn throne beneath a canopy of leaves. He is in the Earth-touching attitude (hiimisparsa-mudrd). On his left, is Mara, sword in hand, being held in check by Indra; on his right, one of Mara's warriors, similarly held by Brahma. In front are two more fallen warriors, and above, two pairs of angels bringing offerings to the Buddha." Certainly a very tame affair compared with Sdfici. The 2nd-4th century sculpture in grey schist, from Gandhara, now in Boston Museum of Fine Arts'03, is much more vigorous as a fight, but badly damaged. None of these warriors seem monstrous. Describing sculptures 47-52 in the Indian Museum, Majumdar notes as follows104: - "In the Gandhdra School this scene is of common occurrence and usually dealt with in two parts; first the attack of Mara followed by his army, and next, his defeat. No. 47 is only a frag- ment; two of Mara's soldiers, armed with a sword and a shield, are seen tumbling down below the seat of the Bodhisattva. Another fragment is No. 48, in which the figure of the Bodhisattva is missing. It shows Mara's army divided into rows. Below, at the right hand corner, is his chariot, and one of his sons is trying to dissuade him from the campaign. Above are three archers, one mounted on an ele- phant and the other two on fabulous animals. In the uppermost row, a number of gods distinguishable 98 Marshall, Buddhist Art of Gandhara, fig. 82 and p. 6o. 99 Zimmer, II, P1. 36, "early ist century B.C." N. G. Majumdar, Guide...

At Paga'n, of the extant stone-reliefs of the 'Eighty-Series' (N. 76-80; D. 5I, 52), none show any sign of violence or assault. No. 76, a normal Earth-touching Buddha, may be intrusive (P1. 296 d). No. 77 shows a small figure of Mara standing weaponless on the left in the pose of Argu- ment. Gotama counters this by touching Earth (PI. 297 a). No. 78 shows the temptation by Mara's daughters (PI. 297 b). No. 79 shows six Devas apparently saluting Gotama's victory (PI. 297 c). No. 8o shows the final attainment of Buddhahood (P1. 297 d). In all these scenes the Buddha sits motionless, touching Earth. "He is calling the Mother-Earth to witness" says Duroiselle, "that this seat of Wis- dom belongs to him. On no other occasion prior to this event, ought he to have been represented in this attitude... The statue of the Earth bearing witness is found on almost all important pagodas [in Burma]. She is represented as a woman ... with the tresses of her hair falling in front of her breast, while with both hands she is wringing the water from it."105 She is not shown at the Nanda, nor often (I think) in Pagan pagodas. The oldest representation in Burma was probably that found by Duroiselle himself at Vesdli, the old Candra capital of N. Arakan: - "Vasundhari, or Mother Earth, wringing her hair brought in a tress in front of her breast ... It is in a sitting posture; the total height of the stone is io in., the figure itself being 7j in. high; the breadth at the bottom is 3j in."106 Another old rendering is on the oblong terracotta plaque found in the relic- chamber of Kyaik D6-ap (Bo-ta-htaung) pagoda at Rangoon'07. Here the centre panels show the Parinirvdna at the top; the Bodhi tree and Earth-touching Buddha below: Vasundharl in the third panel, kneeling towards the left but facing front, holding out the two long tresses of her hair; and in the bottom panel another kneeling figure, possibly a Naga king. Dichotomy, or at least ambivalence, in the rendering of Mara's Quarrel goes back, as we have seen, to early Gandhdran art; where, however, physical assault soon takes precedence of moral or intel- lectual Argument. But the fighters still look human. Kyanzittha and his mahathera Arahan clearly preferred to make the quarrel a battle of Minds rather than Bodies; and, as Duroiselle suggests, "must have given explicit instructions as to how they desired the scene to be presented." But Kyanzittha was no bigot. His admittance of Nat-worship at the Shw6zigon is proof of that. He allowed his wife Abeyadana to build her Mahdydnist temple almost side by side with his Theravddin Nagayon. So he gave his sculptors a free hand to portray Mara's monsters with the old North Indian extravagance around the exterior of the Nanda; while, for the devotional interior, he confined them strictly to the new canon from Ceylon. But Mara's Assault was so popular a theme, both with the public and the painters, that in their earlier temples both he and his queen had to find a place for it. This was apt to be on the back inner wall of the corridor on either side of the large Buddha in the central niche, where the battle could be displayed at large, the attack either coming from both sides against the centre, or the attack on one 105 A.S.I. I914, pp. 92-93. 106 Duroiselle, A.S.B. I92I, p. I9. 107 This Bo-ta-htaung plaque has never yet, I think, been published.</page><page sequence="188">I70 Chapter IX side and the retreat on the other. The attack is from both sides in Gandharan art108, and also that of Amardvati109 and Barabudur'"0. At Sficill" it comes from the right. In the Nagayon the attack comes from the right, the retreat on the left. In the Abeyadana, and usually at Pagan, it is the other way round. The Nagayon panel measures 26 ft. long by 8 ft. high - perhaps the largest at Paga'n. No gloss below was necessary. On the Sdrndth many-scene slab now at Calcutta Museum"2, Mara's Assault is curiously combined with Mara's daughters' Temptation. At Ajantd113 the same is true: the battle on both sides above; Mara's daughters on both sides below. Most curious of all, the Buddha sits in varadamudryi! TEMPTATION BY MARA'S DAUGHTERS (N. 78, P1. 297 b) In the later Theravdda texts the Temptation takes place in the 5th week14 after the Enlighten- ment, not under the Peepal tree (Pali assattha, Ficus religiosa) but under the Banyan (Pali nigrodha, Ficus indica), the Ajaplla, 'Goatherds' Tree'. But in North Indian art, including Ajantd as we have seen, whether for dramatic or instructional reasons, or for compression and artistic convenience, the event has been transferred to the pre-Enlightenment period. The orthodox Theravada view is that given in the Middle Mon Ajapdla inscription of Pegu"15. The scene was here illustrated by many large glazed terracottas, some of the finest in Burma16; but many of the best have found their way into Western Museums. The oldest showing of the scene in Burma is on the two-tiered oval votive tablet of Kanthonzin Hill, Arl Ksetral7. The upper tier shows the Buddha touching Earth between two Bodhisattvas. The lower shows him in the same attitude between two naked women. All the figures are seated and haloed. In the 'Eighty-Series' of Nanda (P1. 297 b), the Buddha sits touching Earth under a formal bushy tree (Besnagar type)118. Below, on the predella, are the three dancing daughters of Mara: Tanha, Arati and Raga (Greed, Hatred, Passion). The two small seated figures on the right may be Vasurhdharas, squeezing their hair. On P1. II of his valuable Life of the Buddha (facing p. 54), Dr. E. J. Thomas shows a simple two- tiered Amaravat! relief. The title of the upper scene - "Gotama meditating in his seraglio" - must surely be wrong. He is the Buddha, wearing a monk's robe. At his sides are five women, dancing or resting, and a man, doubtless their father Mara, in the top right corner. The scene is the Temptation. The Ajan.ta painting has been mentioned already. There is a beautiful and spacious treatment of the scene at Barabudur119. 108 e.g. de Silva-Vigier, PI. 70. Marshall, Buddhist Art of Gandhdra, fig. 67. 109 e.g. Zimmer, II, P1. 88 (c. 2nd cent.

Nothing, I think, can surpass the Barabudur carving shown as frontispiece to Dr. Thomas' The Life of Buddha. In Burma a reredos and double lotus seat are nor- mally added. P1. 297 d is a fine specimen of Kyanzittha's time. MUCALINDA NAGA The 3rd (or 6th) week after the Enlightenment the Buddha spent under the Mucalinda tree (Bar- riigtogia spp. ?), S.E. of the Bodhi tree, not far from the Ajapdla banyan. The Naga king of the tree sheltered the Buddha from the heavy rain and cold by winding his coils seven times round the body and holding his hood over the head. The story was well known at Pagan, if not earlier in Burma. A Kyaukku Onhmin relief (P1. I42 C) shows the Buddha seated with almsbowl on double lotus in dhy- dna mudrd, framed by the twisting coils and five hoods of the serpent. One of the brick and stucco images in the W. corridor of Myinpyagu (P1. I52 C) shows a stout Buddha touching Earth, shaded by five exiguous serpent-hoods. The central colossus, i8A ft. high, made of brick and stucco gilded, in Nagayon temple shrine, (PI. I92 a), is a standing Buddha with right hand in abhaya mudra. He is backed with a screen of I3 serpent hoods, not unlike the lateish wooden frame of Naga hoods shown in Pagan Museum. The tale was told that Kyanzittha himself had thus been sheltered by a young Naga when, a weary outlaw, he had slept on the site where afterwards he built the Nagayon120 ('overspread by the Naga'). The earliest picture of this Buddhist scene appears to be at Sahci Great Stupal21; it depicts, says Marshall, "the visit of the Naga king Mucilinda to the Buddha soon after his Illumination. The Naga king is seated in the foreground, with two of his queens on his right and a ballet troupe of dancers and musicians making up the rest of the Naga group. In the background, behind Mucilinda, is the throne of the Buddha in the shade of a nyagrodha tree, which is attended by two kinnaras and two female celestials riding, respectively, on a winged lion and a griffin." Ndga-hooded images are not confined to Buddhism. In an early Mathurd sculpture of the ist or early 2nd century A.D., it is the Jain Tirthaihkara, Pdrs'vandtha, who was thus protected by the seven- hooded Maga, Dharanendra122. In a 6th century ceiling-slab at Aihole in the Deccan, Visnu sits simi- larly protected by the five hoods of the Ananta serpent, Sesal23. So too in Baddmi Cave III, c. 578 A.D.124. On the four or five reclining images of Visnu found in Burma, at grl Ksetra125, Thaton126, Kawgun Cave127 and Paga'n28, the serpent hoods are not always visible; but he is certainly sleeping on gesa. A coiled Naga megalith can still be seen at Paya-gyi, grl Ksetra; only the four lower coils remain; so whether it ever housed an image, Vaisnava or Buddhist, is uncertain.

Dupont found four such stone images in the later strata of Mon art in Dvdravati, as well as fragments in brick and stone from near P'ra Pat'oml30. Their source he traces to Amardvati. We in Burma seem to have had little contact with the Andhras. Did our form of Ndga-hooded images reach us via Dvdravati? THE FIRST SERMON A symbolic illustration of the First Sermon is visible at Sdficl, on the torana of Stupa III31 (early Ist century A.D.): - a large Wheel with 28 spokes set on top of a pillar, with four deer grazing naturally below. In early Gandhdran art at Loriydn Tangai, when the ban on representing the human Buddha was still in force, a fragment (now at Calcutta Museum)132 still shows a carved pillar with Corinthian capital and emerging Yaksa, shaped like the Triratna symbol, supporting three overlapping Wheels (for the Three Gems). Four of the Five Companions (BhadravargTya), with shaven heads realistically carved, come out from their cell-doors to worship it. The Buddha's Footprints are shown on the torus. A late Gandhdran relief from the same placel33, carved in the same micaceous schist, shows that formalism is conquering. The Buddha, it is true, is now visible in the centre, seated on a grass-strewn throne under a mango tree, his right hand in abhaya mudrd. The five Bhadravargiyas sit to left and right of him, also on grass-strewn thrones, their features still carefully modelled. There are no haloes. The upper row shows gods with faces "doll-like" in comparison. Three Deer are crouched against the throne, and a small pillar as before, crowned with the Triratna symbol and the Wheel. In the 5th century Gupta relief at Sdrndthl34, though the grand stone carving and delicate modelling are beyond the reach of Kyanzittha's sculptors, the design is largely the same: - a carved round halo planted on the old square reredos; the medial vydlas still prominent, the crouching elephants gone, the spouting makaras passing into shoulder-lozenges or gnomons. The Buddha sits alone above, in padmasana, dharmacakra mudra, his crossed legs and cushioned seat suggesting the double lotus still to come. The side-face Wheel and two affronted Deer, the five colourless monks, and other adorants, are now relegated to the pillared base. The earliest Burma renderings of the First Sermon, from ori Ksetra, have been briefly mentioned in Chapter VIII (pp. I35-6): - (i) some worn terracotta votive tablets, recovered from a terrace of the Bawbaw-gyi, and from M6lunby6-gon, Mahtaw village'35. They are in three tiers. The upper tier shows the Buddha seated in padmadsana, dharmacakra mudra, with two figures seated in prayer on either side of him. Below is the Wheel, full-face, with three seated adorants on each side. Below are four Deer, with (probably) the Triratna symbol between them, and jungle at each end. The five monkish figures on the left side of the plaque, are doubtless the Five Companions.

The pillared Wheel (?) two front-face Deer, two monks and two celestials (?) are crushed together on the predella. (iii) The Shw6-nyaung-bin-yo sculpture137 is excessively formal: the large-headed Buddha under a fixed umbrella, seated on multiple lotus (with stalk) between two kneeling monks in prayer, all facing front. Below is the pillared Wheel, front-face, between two Deer couchant with inner legs raised. The great Brahmd, Sahampati, who had persuaded the reluctant Buddha to preach his Law, kneels in the bottom right corner; a king, probably Indra, in the bottom left. (iv) The four-tiered Nyaung-ni-bin sculpture' is the most remarkable. The second (or main) tier shows a triple-arched Bodhgayd temple, the Buddha in the centre, in dharmacakra mundra between two kneeling monks, facing front in prayer. All are on double lotus. Above them, on each side of the stupa-gikhara, stand two Buddhas in dharmacakra mudra, guarded at each corner on a lower level by a standing Brahmd facing outwards. Below the central Buddha is the Wheel, resting on the inner forelegs of two affronted Deer, couchant on double lotus. In the bottom corners, Brahmd (on the right) and Indra (?) on the left, kneel on pillar-bases . In the centre two half- kneeling figures (donors ?) hold offerings in vases on their raised knees. - This sculpture appears to combine two different scenes, that of the First Sermon below, and that of the Twin Miracles, above. A similar combination is mentioned below, under the 'Great Miracle'. At Pagan, the First Sermon was one of the basic scenes selected by Kyanzittha for display, in the Hall of Nagayon (P1. I93 a) and the four Halls of Nanda (P1. 303 a, b, c, d). There is little vari- ation in these stone reliefs: above, the Buddha sits in padma'sana, dharmacakra mudrd; on double lotus in the Nanda, without it in the Nagayon. The Wheel is never shown; but Deer with inner foreleg raised couch in each corner of the predella. Between the Deer sit four figures in the Nagayon: two monks on the left in converse, two Brahmds on the right in prayer. In the Nanda, the S. Hall has two such reliefs, one doubtless a stray from the E. Hall, which has none. This sti-ay shows at least one Brahma on the right side of the predella. I am not sure of the others: they may all be monks. The Nagayon (E. corridor, inner wall) has also a large painting of the scene. The Buddha sits as usual. Three monks on the right, two on the left, sit facing him in prayer. There are three tiers of Brahmds below. No Wheel; but up the left side twelve tiers of Deer in panels stand facing the Master with foreleg raised; tip the right side are seven tiers of Buddhas sitting sideways in dhamnmacakra rudrc. THE GREAT MIRACLE Every Buddha must perform this miracle. Its occurrence in Gotama's case is placed in the 6th year after the Enlightenment. It consisted of a large number of miracles, each of which may be a subject for representation: - (i) It begins with a challenge from the heretics (in Burma usually depicted as Ajfvaka or Naked Ascetics) to a rival display of miraculous powers in the presence of the king of Kosala, Prasenajit. Accepting the challenge, the Buddha says he will perform his miracle at the mango tree near the gate of 8rdvasti. The heretics destroy all mango trees in the neighbourhood. But the Buddha, accepting a mango from Ganda, the king's gardener, eats it, then plants and waters the seed, which springs up 137A.S.B. 1940, P1. 11 d, and pp. 12-I3. 138 A.S.I. I928, P1.

The heretics, put ultimately to shame, flee or drown themselves: - This was the favourite theme of Kyanzittha and Rajakumdr. (ii) Prasenajit, a friend of the Buddha, builds a special mandapa for the miracles. Brahmds and gods descend (devorohana). The Buddha takes his seat in the air on a golden lotus supported by the Naga kings Nanda and Upananda. - This theme (mostly absent from Pali) was popular in Gandhdran art. (iii) The Yamaka prdtihdrya or 'Twin Miracles' are the climax (though these had been performed earlier at Kapilavastu). Flames burst from the Buddha's shoulders, while water pours from his feet. Six-coloured rays from his body spread over the universe. Countless replicas of himself in different attitudes reach up to the sky. - Such themes are developed to the full, especially in Mahdydnist art. For the Gandhdran versions nearest to those in Burma, compare the Begram relief in Kabul Museum, Afghanistan139, showing the Buddha standing in abhaya mudrd, flames rising from his shoulders, and three pairs of niymdna Buddhas above and at his sides. Compare also the Takht-i- Bahi sculpture No. 835 in Peshawar Museum, where he sits in dhydna mudra, and numerous pairs fly off in all directions; or No. 280 with the Kharosthi inscription, where he sits in dharymacakra mudra on the Naga kings' thousand-petalled lotus'40; or again Plate III (facing p. 98) in E. J. Thomas' The Life of Buddha, where he sits, under the kfrtimnukha, on the Naga kings' lotus, surrounded by a gallery of pairs. For the simpler Gupta version from Sdrndth, now in Calcutta Museum, see P1. 94 of Mme. de Silva-Vigier's The Life of the Buddha. In Old Burma the number of 'Twins' is usually reduced to a minimum. A stone relief from Shw6- nyaung-bin ridge, Sri Ksetral4l, has just a formal, frontal Triad set against a plain arched backslab: the central Buddha seated in padmasana on a high seat; on each side of him a Buddha seated in pra- lambandsana - all three with hands in dharymacakra mudra. Nearby, in a field S. of Taunglonnyo village, was found a fine terracotta votive tablet142: in the centre a crowned Buddha seated cross- legged in dharmacakra mudra, between two crowned nirmdna Buddhas sitting sideways with one leg raised, one hanging, but facing front with hands also in dharmacakra mtudra. All sit on double lotuses within a large trefoil arch, set against receding roofs and stfipa-gikhara. At the side near the top are very likely two other seated Buddhas. At Thaton, Shwezayan pagoda, the peak of king Makuta's trap inscriptions similarly shows a crowned Buddha seated crosslegged in dharmacakra mudra. On each side, in pralambandsana, sits side- ways but faces front a nirmnana Buddha, crownless, also in dharmacakra muddr. The scene should be the Twin Miracle, but below the lotus seat appears the Wheel, with Deer on each side, i.e. the First Sermon! A votive tablet with deep rims, found frequently at Tagaung, 'dodk pagodal4l, and also at Myoma village in the north of Prome district'45, but not as yet at Paga6n, shows a triple archway with the Earth-touching Buddha in the centre, and standing nirmtna Buddhas in the side-arches, their outer hands hanging, their inner raised before the body.

The one on the left hangs his right hand in varada mudrd, The one on the right raises his right hand in abhaya mudry. There is Ndgarl writing below. A similar tablet may be seen in the platform-museum of Pegu, Shw6 mawdaw pagoda. A plaque flame-like or fig-leaf in shape, found at Tadagal6, Rangoon'47, serves as a link with Siam. Coedes mentions a specimen found at Bejrapuri. His specimen, better preserved than ours, he de- scribes as follows148 :- "The Buddha, with regalia, seated on a lotus throne supported by three elephant-heads, and in the attitude of touching the Earth. He is surrounded by many other Buddhas in the same attitude, those above him being seated upon long-stemmed lotus flowers. Height: O.m.T2." - He does not say it illustrates the Twin Miracles; but I expect it does. In the year following the Enlightenment, on the Buddha's first return to Kapilavatthu, he performed a Twin Miracle at the Nigrodhardma, in order to convince his proud Sdkiyan kinsmen. The scene is painted in the Nagayon (S. corridor, outer wall, near N.E. corner), but the top half is lost. It is clearly painted in the shrine of Pagan Pahto-tharnya, on the E. side of the S. window (PI. i67 b)149. The Buddha sits enthroned in the centre, in padmasana, dharmacakra rnndrd. The twin nirymna Buddhas sit on either side of him, in the same pose but with feet hanging. The Sdkiyan princes, wrapped in robes of geometrical pattern, sit in the two lower rows; monks, seated or standing, in the top row; all are in worship. There are also several small panels about Ganda's mango at Sdvatthi, on the topmost legible line of the N. recess, N. wall, in the same shrine. But the theme which Kyanzittlia chose as one of his i6 basic scenes in stone relief for display in the Hall of Nagayon (P1. I93 d) and the four Halls of Nanda (PI. 298, a, b, c, d), was the Defeat of the Heretics at Sdvatthi. Here the Buddha sits above, under Ganda's mango tree, in padmdsana, dhar- mnacakra mudrd (without lotus in the Nagayon relief). Below, on the predella, six figures are shown: king Pasenadi on the right or left of centre (in the Nagayon, conversing with one of the naked heretics). On the far right a naked heretic seems to be trying to levitate (in the Nagayon, another heretic is holding on to him). Their leader was Pfirana Kassapa. Rdjakurnmr tells the story more vividly in two panels of the inner wall, lower tier, S. corridor, of the Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi (P1. 346 a, b)'50: "The heretics perform miracles". "The heretics, ashamed, go and drown themselves in a tank." For a larger treatment of the scene of the Twin Miracles at Pagan, there is the N. shrine of Myinkaba Kubyauk- nge temple. But that is after the end of our period. DESCENT FROM TAVATIMSA At Bhdrhut (early ist century B.C.), on a panel of the Ajdtasatru pillar'51, there is the earliest showing of the Buddha's return from Trayastrirhgat Heaven.

On the left, the empty throne under the tree and the flying god above them, imply Indra, his stone seat Pan- dukambala, and his Coral Tree Pdricchattaka. Rows of welcomers fill most of the remaining space. Judged by the slab in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London'52, the Gandhdran realization of the scene was more crowded and matter-of-fact: - triple stairs down the centre; triple tiers of stairs; six tiers of welcomers, six persons on each side; horses and chariots at the base. The haloed Buddha is shown on the three tiers, right hand in abhaya mnudrd. On each tier he stands between Indra and Brahma: Indra (shown by his peculiar headdress) is on the Buddha's left, Brahma on his right (in Burma it is always the other way round). There is nothing like the triple (sc. quadruple) head of later representations to distinguish Brahma. He does not hold the umbrella, nor Indra the almsbowl or the conch, as is invariable in Burma. There is no kriputra at the base. The Andhra relief now at the Metropolitan Museum in New York,'53 shows the Buddha, happy to be back, standing on the bottom step, with the Cillamanicetiya (?) above him and two half-kneeling worshippers below. Indra and Brahma are not in attendance. No resemblance to the scene as rendered in Burma. The small Eight-Scene Sdrndth slabl54, on the other hand, comes close to it: - three standing figures: the Buddha in the centre with right hand hanging in varadamudrd; Brahma (not yet three- faced) on the right (his left), holding the umbrella; Indra on the left holding the bowl. On the huge Old Ndlanda Eight-Scene slab'55, Brahma (three-faced ?) also holds the umbrella; but he is still on the left (the Buddha's right) as in Gandhdra. "In the sculptures of Gandhara" says Duroiselle'58, "the place of honour is always on the left, but in the Ananda it is regularly on the right". Thus Indra takes precedence of Brahma. Pagan renderings, in stone or wood, of this popular theme stick close to the 'shorthand' summary in the 'Eight Scenes'. Brahma and Indra are indispensable. The earliest version is the broken relief at Kyaukku Onhmin (PI. 141 e). The legs, as usual, of all three figures are tall, the robes exaggerated. The Buddha's hand, hideously repaired, is in varada mudrd. Sdriputta once knelt in front of the grace- ful Indra. The stairway is not shown. The theme is one of the sixteen basic themes in all five of Kyan- zittha's Halls (Pls. I94 a, 300 a, b, c, d). There is little difference between them. The Buddha's feet are still, but the swinging robe indicates motion. The right hand, where not repaired, is in varada mudrd above Sdriputta's head. The tilt of heads, Indra's and Brahma's, in the N. Hall sculpture (P1. 300 d) is effective. The W. Hall sculpture (P1. 300 c) is interesting as showing, at the base, the three stairways (of jewels, gold, and silver), with Sdriputta kneeling (as Duroiselle unkindly notes) at the top instead of the bottom'5. Among the 'rejects' in a cross-passage, is a sculpture with blank 'wooden' background (P1. 3i9 b), which Kyanzittha always disliked. Yet surely, here if anywhere, the background should 152 de Silva-Vigier, P1. 2. N. G. Majumdar (op. cit., Part II, pp. 55-56) mentions a "very much damaged" version of the scene (No. 78) at the Indian Museum: "Three ladders are depicted; the Buddha is seen descending by the middle one, while Brahma and gakra by the other two, respectively on his left and right. At the foot of 8akra's ladder is his elephant, while the nun Utpalavarna appears at the foot of the middle ladder welcoming the Buddha." 153 B.

And how much more moving, as a work of art, is the rendering of the scene in wood, still extant in Pagan Museum (P1. 4i9 a) - the short self-assured bodies, the tiny ladder with extended rungs, the homespun triumph of man's infinite quest? In paint, the Pagan artist first treated the scene, very freely, in Rdjakumdr's temple (III3 A.D.)159. In his series on the history of the Abhidhamma, on the inner wall of the W. corridor, lower tier, one panel covers our scene: "At the time of the Devas' Descent" (PI. 346 d). The wooden ladder is shown diagonally, full face, with three Sakras and Brahmd balanced on the sides of them; but the glory of the scene still shines, with the arms of hidden Devas thrusting through the clouds to offer flowers. PARILEYYAKA RETREAT Duroiselle has an interesting note on this story160. In the Vinaya text (Vol. I, Mahdvagga, pp. 352-3), only the Elephant is mentioned, not the Monkey. "The Tathdgata Uddna*, on which Bigandet [The Life or Legend of Gaudama, i858] is based, also ignores the Monkey, which, however, is mentioned in the Commentary on the Dhammapada which gives the complete story [Vol. I, part I, pp. 53 if., Ko- sambaka-vatthu, Pali Text Society, I907], which is reproduced in extenso in the Jinatthapakdsani (pp. 433 if.). With the story of the Monkey as briefly narrated above, maybe compared also "L'offrande du Singe" as given by Foucher in his Art gr6co-bouddhique (p. 5I1 f.). Although in the several sources the scene of this is laid in different places, namely in Vaigdli, grdvasti, Kaugambi,...the Monkey invariably comes to an untimely end immediately after his offering, in the one story by falling into a hole or well, in the other by being impaled on a sharp stump. . ." In the Sdrndth Eight-Scene slab (Gupta period)161, the Buddha sits cross-legged, hands in lap with bowl on them. A large defaced figure of the Monkey enters on the left, bringing the honeycomb. In the right bottom corner his legs and tail are seen disappearing down the well. Above, in the top right corner, he reappears as a heavenly king. In Burma, the Monkey certainly appears in the oldest Eight-Scene tablets we find, both at Sri Ksetra (East Z6gu) and Pagan (Shw6hsandaw): see PI. 70 a, b, c, etc. At the bottom left corner of the tablet, the Buddha sits in pralambanasana, almsbowl in lap, facing front. On the right (the Buddha's left) the little Monkey is eyeing him. The Elephant is not shown. On PI. 70 d, e, too, where the scene is shown in the bottom right corner of the tablet, the Monkey appears on the left of the panel (the Buddha's right). At Pegu, East Shw6natha Thein, in the background of the larger stone image, lower left corner, the same scene is faintly shown162, with the Buddha seated in pralambandsana, facing half-left. The Monkey is visible below him, offering the honeycomb; but not the Elephant. At Pag6n, both are shewn; in the stone relief in Nagayon Hall (PI. I93 b), and in that of the W. Hall of Nanda (P1. 3I b). The designs are similar. The Buddha sits in pralambanasana, facing front, hands in lap with almsbowl. The tiny Elephant is at the Buddha's feet on the left. On the right 158 Late Gandharan art, too, passed through its architectural crisis, when formal decoration all but killed nar- rative art. See Marshall, Buddhist Art of Gandhdra, pp. 93-96.

On the Nanda relief he is shown a second time, impaled on the stake (?). The two monks seen here in worship behind the Buddha, or the single monk on the Nagayon relief, are there to remind us of the Pdrileyyaka Sutta (Satyittta Nikdya III, 95 ff.), preached by the Buddha to some monks whom Ananda led to the forest-retreat. The finest stone-relief of this scene, containing all the above elements, is in the Myinkaba Ku-byauk-ng6 temple of NdtoAimyd163, beyond the end of our period. In the Eight-Scene Mon fragment shown at P1. 74 e, note the clambering Elephant. CONVERSION OF ALAVAKA YAKKHA (XTAVIKA YAKSA) Here too Duroiselle distinguishes'" two versions of the story: the older and more sober one as told in the Sutta Nipctal65; and the later, as found in such modern works as Burmese Jinatthapakasan4 (pp. 479 ff.). The stone sculpture in the S. Hall of Nanda (P1. 3i2 d) is not exciting, merely a memento of the scene: the Buddha stands in dharmacakra mudrd with the usual architecture behind. On the right, the stout broad-faced Yakkha stands with knees part-bent, as if clinging to the Buddha for protection. He is balanced by a slim monk standing in worship on the other side. The same scene is much more prettily shewn in a painting in Sayambhfl temples' (a little beyond the end of our period). The tushy Yakkha is here seated on the left of the Buddha (the Buddha's right), with five Yakkhas etc. in the lower row, and four monks in the upper. The Buddha sits in padmasana, dharmacakra mudrd, in front of a charming wooden monastery with receding roofs, bowered in leafy trees and palms. The Burmese gloss below reads: - "Here is the Lord Buddha admonishing the ferocious ogre, Alavaka TAMING OF NALAGIRI ELEPHANT Whether for strength of design, dramatic excitement, or emotional release, the Amardvat! tondo'67 (2nd century A.D.), now in Madras Museum, is a masterpiece beyond praise. The 7th century sculpture at Sa-nici Museum168, though not lacking in dignity, is dead by comparison. In the former the Bud- dha's height is not exaggerated, nor that of the elephant diminished. The only liberty taken, for narrative purpose, is to shew the elephant twice: squared and charging on the left, slumped and rounded on the right. In the Sanicl sculpture his height is only up to the Buddha's thigh. On Pagan reliefs, as Duroiselle says'69, he "might almost be taken for a rat"; and the Buddha, instead of strok- ing him (which he could only do by stooping), droops his hand, once in varada mudra. Poses are all stiff and hieratic. The only hint of drama is that the tiny elephant has now two heads, one raised, one sunken. This disproportion in size robs all these Burmese carvings of tension, whatever other merit they possess. The dramatic sense was slow to evolve. 163 I am not sure of the Arch. Neg. number; but Nos.

At Gri Ksetra there is the Shw6nyaungbin stone sculpture with high triple nimbus'70. Here the Buddha and the monk on the left stand in easy pose, right hand hanging, left before the body. The elephant crouches in the bottom right corner (not the left, as is regular at Paga'n). His sunk head barely reaches the knee, his rampant trunk the waistline, of the monk on the right (the Buddha's left). This monk holds the almsbowl before the body, and raises his right hand a little, as if in warning. All three faces are rigid. Five miles south of Pegu, there is the tall stone sculpture at Nagawun Theinl7l. The defaced, but beautifully carved Buddha with the grand nimbus, stands turning half-left, with knees slightly bent. A plump well-modelled monk with childlike face holds the almsbowl in his left hand, and huddles behind the right leg of the Master. On the Buddha's left side, below level of his feet, is the tusked two-headed elephant, at once charging and slumped. There is a small figure in prayer above it. With all its damage and disproportion, this is still the finest carving of the scene in Burma. The childlike monk reminds one at once of that more damaged rendering, probably of the same scene, at Thaton, Shwdzayan172. There, apart from the sad-eyed childlike monk, with two arms hugging his bowl, little remains except part of the Buddha's halo and nimbus, and an Old Mon inscription (duplicate of another in Kawgun Cave)'73 which enables us to date these sculptures as pre-Aniruddha, probably ist half of the iith century A.D. Also at Pegu, the tall S. image at E. Shw6natha Thein includes in its background another version of the story'74. The main high-crowned Buddha stands 6 ft. high, on double lotus, with right hand in varada mhdrd. Against the right side of the lotus, below the level of his feet, stands the small elephant, as on the Nagawun sculpture, but not yet crouched, and with only a single head. Above the elephant's back is a carved pillar. On the left of this, above the elephant's head, stands the background Buddha of this scene, with right hand drooped as if to protect a small child standing at his feet. On the outer side of the pillar stands a tall figure, probably a monk. The original scene is thus described by Mala- lasekeral75:- "At the sight of N51dgiri all the people fled in terror. Ananda, seeing the elephant advanc- ing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha's orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. Just then, a woman, carrying a child, saw the elephant coming and fled, in her terror dropping the child at the Buddha's feet. As the elephant was about to attack the child, the Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal's fore- head. Thrilling with joy at the touch, N51dgiri sank on his knees"... Here, then, we have the whole scene in miniature. The heroic Ananda has been pushed out of harm's way behind the pillar. The Bud- dha's concern now is to save the child, and pacify the drunken elephant. He is in the act of doing so. Two more illustrations, much less interesting, are also at Pegu. One is on the reverse of the two- faced sculpture found in Thawka garden, Old Pegu176. Here the tall Buddha stands with long right 170 Shwdnyaungbin. Arch. Neg. 4126 (I938-39). A.S.B. I939, PI.

"At his feet" says U Lu Pe Win (I cannot myself see the figures, but the print is poor), "one on the right and another on the left, are what one would assume to be two weatherworn elephant-figures". If so, this is a unique posing. Finally, in the platform-museum of Shwemawdaw pagoda, there is a dark stone votive tablet, squared below, arching to a pointed top'77. The upper half is edged with large beading. It shows the Buddha standing in tribhaitga pose on lotus, right hand hanging, left raised from the elbow and holding a lappet of his robe. On the right (the Buddha's left) is a single small disciple holding the almsbowl. In the bottom left corner (note the change of side), there appears to be a minute elephant. At Pagan, we know of four relief-sculptures of the scene: - the earliest in Kyaukku Onhmin (P1. I4I f); then one in the W. Hall of Nanda (PI. 3I2 C), and one in a cross-passage (P1. 3I9 c), probably rejected because of 'wooden' technique, bare background, absence of architecture; and a sculpture, possibly late, in the E. shed of the Museum (P1. 4io f) where, although heights have been reduced, the Buddha still can barely touch the elephant's raised trunk. All are hieratic, without life or drama or even humanity. The design is identical: the elephant, probably two-headed, always on the left; the three standing figures frontal and impassive; the Buddha's right hand falling naturally except in the Ananda Hall relief (query 'repaired' ?), which is in varada mitdr. The most impressive is the Kyaukku relief, where the Buddha stands immensely tall, large and confident between his slim, long- eared and tiny-headed monks, bearing bowls and fly-whisks - without rapport, physical or spiritual, with the poor drunken beast so far beneath them. The Nagayon temple has no stone sculpture of this scene; but it has a large panel of painting which includes it, with other scenes at RMjagaha: see panel on the inner wall, W. corridor, near S.W. corner. Ndldgiri is here 'spoonerized' into Lanagiri: - "This is when Devadat let loose Lanagiri so as to kill the Lord Buddha. At that time the Lord (stroked his trunk and established him ?) in the Five ST/as. The ornaments and clothes which all the people offered." - Hence the change of the elephant's name to Ratanapdla or Dhanapdla, 'Guardian of Wealth'. PARINIRVANA A stupa (cetiya) is the symbol for this, both at Bharhut178 and Siici'79. In Gandhdra the oldest rendering known to Marshall is one of the Marddn group, now in Peshawar Museum'80. This is already close to the normal Burma pattern. The haloed Master lies on his right side, head to the left, right hand under the head, left stretched along the body. The two sala trees are said to be there, with their tree-spirits. The mourners' grief is vividly and variously shown. Every face is a study in itself. On the later slab from Nathu Upper Monastery181, now at Calcutta Museum, formalism has conquered: the Buddha "is now like a stiffly frontal statue laid on its side... All trace of sorrow has gone. Every one of the actors .., even the dying Buddha himself - wear the same pleasant and fatuous smile." The scene tends to get more and more crowded: e.g. in the Swat relief, now at Calcutta Museum'82, with 177 Arch. Neg. 769i (I957-58). Height 5j in. 178Bharhut. N. G. Majumdar, Guide ...

But simpler designs are also found, as in the Gandharan relief now in Honolulu'83. None of these appear to contain the old symbol, the Cetiya. It re-appears, however, prominently in the moving Pcla relief, now at the British Museum'84, with "heavenly music sounded in the sky". The practice of making colossal images of the Parinirva-na, either in caves or in the open air, started, I suppose, with the rock-cut image in Cave XXVI at Ajanti (Ist half of the 7th century A.D.)185. None such have yet been traced at gri Ksetra. But at Kyontu near Waw, some 20 miles N.E. of Pegu, not far from the former mouth of the Pegu River, the local abbot showed us, S.E. of his monastery, a long grass-grown mound, probably of laterite, clearly shaped like a colossal reclining image. The head (if I remember right) was toward the East. At Pagan, two colossal reclining images of brick and stucco date from the reign of Aniruddha. The one on the W. side of Manuha temple, Myinpagan (Pls. ii9, I20), is attributed to the captured Mon king of Thaton, i.e. Makuta'86. Aniruddha himself may be responsible for the other (PI. 85 b, c), the Shinbin Thalyaung image in the brick shed W. of his Shwe- hsan-daw pagoda. Describing the latter image, Taw Sein Ko writes'87: - "Its head points to the south, whereas that of the Manuha temple points to the north, a position assumed by Gotama Buddha when he was lying on his deathbed between two sdl trees at Kusinagara." Only one illustration of the Parinirvdna has yet been found at Arl Ksetra - the figure at the apex of the earliest Eight-Scene tablet, common to Sri Ksetra and Pagan (P1.] 70 a, b, c, d). Here the Buddha lies, as usual, on his right side, head to the left, upon a beaded couch, his right hand on the pillow under his cheek, his left stretched along the body. Above him is the old symbol, the Cetiya, with flowers. Three crude votive tablets from Pegu (all marked 'Pegu 40-4I'), now in Mandalay Archaeological Office, show various versions of the scene. The top row of one shows the Buddha lying on a pallet under a broad umbrella (?), with his head to the right188. On another, the top panel shows the emaciated Master lying with head to the left; and both sdla trees also on the left, to make room, it seems, for Ananda, kneeling at his Master's feet'89. The third tablet, or rather top of a tablet, shows two Buddhas reclining in the top panel, their heads towards the centre'90. A large squared-oval tablet at the Man- dalay Office, of unknown origin but probably from Lower Burma, shows faint scenes, probably of the life of the Buddha. The top panel may possibly show the Parinirvana, with the Buddha's head to the right, and three diminishing stupas on each side'91. The oblong tablet found at Kyaik De-ap (Bo-ta- htaung) pagoda, Rangoon, which shows Vasurhdhard wringing her hair under the Earth-touching Buddha'92, has a faint and formal Parinirvdna scene at the top, with head to the left.

Or were they without a text of the Maltdparinibbdna Sutta? At Pagan, it seems, the rules for carving Parinirvdna scenes in stone were strict, and mainly in the Gandhdran tradition. There is little difference of design here between the Nagayon (P1. I94 b), the four Halls of the Nanda (P1. 302 a, b, c, d), and (perhaps the finest of them) the later sculpture of the Myinkaba Ku-byauk-nge'93. Let us take the Nanda reliefs as example. In place of the symbolic Cetiya, but (I suppose) representing it, there is a square-terraced tapering Prisdda (the funeral pyre?) in the background. In the Nagayon it has elaborate corner-stupas and fills the apex of the stone; but its size and breadth are much reduced in the Nanda. Below it, is the deathbed, tilted vertically with inclined quatrefoil headpiece on the left, to set off the head of the Buddha, lying hieratically, head propped on hand and three pillows. The two visible legs of the bed are curving and massive; and between them are ranged in worship the Malla princes, on either side of incense-burners or cresset- stands (dandadip). In the bottom right corner pose a dancer and a drummer. Above them, at the foot of the bed, sits or kneels Ananda. At each top corner of the bed is a sata tree, including the tree-spirit with offerings. At top left, prominent between the tree and the prdstda stand Brahma and Indra. To right of the Prdsdda there are two rows of worshippers: four or five monks squarely seated; and above, with arms diagonally raised, bending deities with lotuses. In one of the cross-passages of Nanda, there is a simpler and more moving version (P1. 3i9 e), rejected, I expect because of its bare arching top. The top is now broken, but the older photographs show it. Below, four monks sit in formal prayer, on either side of the round cresset-stand. The floral fountain on the bier's bargeboard holds the eye. Nothing above but vacancy, and the beaded image of the Master, dead. * * THE PAGAN ILLUSTRATOR This brief survey of some of the main themes of the early Pagan sculptor-painter may suffice to shew his main affiliations as an artist: with North India, from Gandhdra to Bengal. He owed little to Andhra, Pallava or Singhalese art. His limitations are clear. He was a true artist, primarily in wood, suddenly called upon by a strong-minded king to carve in sandstone an enormous number of new subjects. He had no books nor art-galleries to refer to. He knew the old Buddhist symbols, the mudras, the dsanas, the Eight Scenes. What he could fit into that scheme, he did with skill, ease and confidence. But neither his eye nor his hand were trained in representation, and his technique was mainly con- fined to the two-dimensional. Kyanzittha, too, was an exacting master, with a taste for gilding and architectural detail. He disliked landscape and bare spaces, and thought only of foreground, where, like Keats, he sought to 'load every rift with ore.' Such knowledge as king or sculptor had of Pala and Bengal art, Mahayanist and Brahmanical, could help little in the creation of a new iconography for Theravdda texts. Imagine the problems facing the artist painting the P5hto-thamya, called on suddenly to illustrate the thirty Nissaggiya offences, or even such simple themes as the Tonsure, or the Robing of Maya. He had no precedents to follow, and no intelligible texts to guide him. He had small Pali, and less Sanskrit. 193 See supra, note i63.</page><page sequence="201">Chapter LX i83 All work on the pagodas was done at breakneck speed. "As for the painting of the temple" says one inscription (dated 1237 A.D.)194, "on Friday the ioth waxing of Tagu (work was started on) the I4,6i9 Buddhas of the temple, and the 550 Jdtakas. By Monday the i2th it was finished." Pagan temples were built in months, not (as many cathedrals in Europe) in centuries. The surprising thing is the artist's measure of success, not his failures. In sculpture, I suspect that the king, or his mahdthera Arahan, rather than the sculptor, was responsible for the great mistake (based, admittedly, on ample precedents in India)195 of splitting his design in two, giving the Symbol large prominence in the panel proper, and relegating details of the particular scene (including its emotional reactions) to the narrow limits of the predella. This generally destroyed the unity of the whole, left no room for the artist's imagination to work in, and condemned him to the role of piecework journeyman. There is ample evidence in the 'Eighty-Series' to shew that he was capable of higher things, had he been freer. We have only touched the beginnings of Pagan painting in this chapter. To be frank, we have not had time to do much more than read the thousands of glosses below the panels - so important in themselves, so useful in identifying the scenes. A vast amount of work remains to be done: - cementing the paintings to the walls they now barely adhere to, before they can be carefully cleaned, protected from insects and decay, and so made available to study. It seems that in painting, the seeds of Bengal tradition fell on fruitful ground. The Abeyadana proves that, given a free hand (the painter had far more range and freedom than the sculptor), he could do masterly work, both in general design and in calligraphic detail. But here too he was generally limited to two dimensions. There has not been space to consider the iconography of the Jdtakas, as seen both in paint and terracotta. Here is a wide and easy field for extending research, and a material in which the early Paga'n artists showed their mettle better, perhaps, than in stone. 194 I.B., P1. I 105 a6-8.

JAMBUPATI In the centre of two of the dolomite (andagii) slabs of the Eight Scenes, found near Pagan Shw6- zigon (P1. 400) and at Tabayin N.W. of Shw6bo (P1. 40I), appears the Crowned Buddha, known in Burma as Jambupati. In both cases he sits in the Earth-touching attitude. The crown also appears on at least six bronzes of Old Burma, the oldest of which was found at Sri Ksetra - a standing Buddha from Shw6-nyaung-bin ridge', heavily crowned, with both hands half-raised in vitarka mudrd. He is not a Bodhisattva; for apart from crown and ear-pendents, he wears nothing but the plain robes of a monk. A similar, heavily crowned standing Buddha in gold repouss6 plate used to be at Pagan Museum (P1. 424 e). Here the monk wears a torque or necklace as well as a crown; his right hand is raised to the shoulder in vitarka mudrd; his left hangs at his side. An effeminate standing bronze from Pagan (P1. 433 a) shows the crowned Buddha with elaborate ear-ornaments, standing on double lotus in normal attitude - right hand raised in abhaya mudra, left holding out the edge of his robe. The crown, like the usntsa, is topped with the flame-niche. The other four crowned bronzes, all different in style, though all are seated and touching Earth, come from Pagan Pahtothamya (P1. 439 a, b), from Thazi Hsameikshe, P1. 439 c, d), from Tabayin in Shw6bo district (P1. 439 e, f), and from Kyaukt'ga in Pegu district2. All sit in padmasana, both soles showing, except the Kyauktaga Buddha who has right leg on left. A votive tablet from Sri Ksetra3 shows three crowned Buddhas, all seated in dharmacakra mudrd, in a temple elaborately roofed. The central Buddha sits crosslegged, the other two sit sideways, facing front, the near leg hanging, the farther propped on the seat. The carving of the three Buddhas at the top of the trdp inscription at Thaton is strikingly similar; but there only the central Buddha wears the crown4.

The two stand- ing Buddhas in Kawgun Cave triad-sculptures8, which may possibly show the Descent from Thvatirhsa, wear royal ornaments and sacred thread (upavfta): perhaps also crowns, but the heads are lost or damaged. Figures of Bodhisattvas, of course, are commonly crowned and robed as kings, with rich ear-orna- ments, torque, sacred thread, armlets, wristlets, girdle, etc.; but these are not Bodhisattvas. Five are touching Earth; the rest are standing or sitting in normal Buddha-attitudes. Nearly all wear monastic robes, with only some of the regalia superposed. The Hsameikshe and Tabayin bronzes come closest to a Bodhisattva; and indeed would be called so but for their earth-touching attitude. Their regalia, especially ear-ornaments, epaulettes, necklaces and shawl are exceptionally rich, in the style of the bronze Maitreya of Mahdmuni, North Arakan9. The Sri Ksetra bronze wears a heavy crown,but nothing royal on the torso. The Pfhtothamya bronze has no armlets nor wristlets, and no throne except the large double lotus. On the dolomite slabs the Buddha sits, not only on the leather mat (of the ascetic) and the lotus (of the saint), but also on the large throne (of the monarch). The lotus rests on triple massive stalks, and seems to be suspended in air, with two NMga kings (or Devas), as on sculptures at Mahobd10, eagerly lifting it from below. For the thoughtful or orthodox Theravddin, one would think, the very idea of a crowned Buddha should seem strange, possibly repugnant, almost a contradiction. For though the Bodhisatta Setaketu, before he deigned to be conceived by Maya, reigned as a king in Tusita, Prince Siddhattha, at the age of 29, made the Great Renunciation; and on the bank of the river Anomd stripped off all his orna- ments and royal robes, handed them to Channa, severed his elaborate hairknot, and received monastic robes and the Eight Requisites from Brahmd Ghatikdra. From that moment till his death he remained a monk, and is normally shown as such in Buddhist art, from Gandhdra and Mathurd onwards. Yet 'Jambupati', the Crowned Buddha, is now imaged everywhere", not only in Burma, but in Siam, Laos, Camboja, etc.; and different fanciful stories are told today in the various countries about the origin of the image. We can ignore these modern local stories; for the true origin, however complex and obscure, is certainly Indian and ancient. M. Paul Mus, in his long note "Le Bouddha Pare. Son origine Indienne. gakyamuni dans le Mahdydnisme moyen"12, has gone deep into the subject, without however ex- hausting it. In what follows, I resume in rough outline the course of his conclusions in so far as they relate to Burma. For this was one of the main doors by which the plains-people of Burma had entered, or were entering, the Mahdydnist fold in the time of Aniruddha, and might (like Tibet) have been there 6 See Ch.

Mus distinguishes the "adorned" (par6) Buddha from the Buddha crowned with the mukuta. For in several instances which he considers - e.g. the final chapters of the Saddharma- puV1arfka-sfitra, and the practice (mentioned by Hsiian-tsang at Bodhgaya and elsewhere) of dressing Bud- dhas with royal ornaments - there may be no mention of a crown. The distinction hardly seems important for Burma.</page><page sequence="204">x86 Chapter X today, but for (a) the weakness of the Sanskritic link, (b) the Muslim conquest of Bengal at the end of the I2th century A.D.13, and (c) the opening of contact with Ceylon during the latter part of the iith. Crowned Buddhas, in ancient India as in Burma, are never wholly royal. The correlation and contrast between Monk and King are there, and are intended. Seen in ultimate perspective, the Wheel of the Dharma, turned by the Buddha, merges in the Wheel of Authority, turned by the Cakra- vartin. Przyluski has shown that before the first century A.D., many traditions identified the Bud- dha with the Universal Monarch. "For the primitive image of the sramaana Gautama, humbly clad in coarse pdths'ukfila (rags from the dust-heap), was substituted that of the Buddha-Cakravartin, dressed in royal robes14."' In Indian art 'Buddha' and 'Bodhisattva' were not at first sharply distinguished. "The early inscriptions" says Coomaraswamylr, "distinguish by the designation 'Buddha' and 'Bodhisattva' types which are to all appearances the same; in these cases 'Bodhisattva' must refer to Gautama, Sdkya Muni, and may be freely equated with 'Buddha'. In the early Kusana period the iconography is not yet fixed, and there is considerable variety of costume, and it would appear that prototypes of the later crowned Buddhas can already be recognized." His Plate XXIII 87 gives a clear picture of one of these, seated with right hand raised in abhaya mudrd - a mottled red sandstone relief, "evidently from Mathurd ... Early 2nd century A.D."16. These crowned figures are not attached to any particular scene or moment in the Buddha's life. Buddhas standing, in abhaya, varada or vitarka mudrd, Buddhas seated crosslegged or with legs hanging, in dhydna, bhiimisparsa or dharmacakra mudrd - any may be found crowned17. Ramaprasad Chanda shows one Pala slab of the Eight Scenes in which not only the central Buddha preaching the First Sermon is crowned, but also the side-Buddhas in the Pdrileyyaka, NM1dgiri and Descent from Thvatirhsa scenes18. Between the Mathurd relief of the early 2nd century, and the Pala ones of the 8th-ioth, there is a big gap in time. A carved panel on the lower part of the facade between the two entrances to Karl! caitya hall, may help to bridge it's. The older parts of Karli, including the massive figures of donors to left and right of the Buddha panel, are thought to date from the early 2nd century A.D. if not earlier. But these Buddha-panels, Coomaraswamy says20, are later, dating from the Gupta period. The panel in question shows the Buddha seated in pralambanasana, with hands in dharmacakra mudrd; two many-hooded Nagas below run in half-kneeling to support a column, on the top of which rests a Wheel '13 "The Chandras of RohitAgiri" (PattikerA, W. of Comilla), "were Buddhists ...

Laksmana Sena ... was ousted from his throne by Ikhtiyaruddin Muhammad-bin-Bakhtiyar in I202 A.D. Buddhism had begun to decline in these parts with the fall of the Chandras. The Varmmans and the Senas were no friends of Buddhism. With the coming of the Muhammadans, . . . Bengal sculpture went out like a lamp ... Buddhism gradually bled to death and never revived." (N. K.

The scene, at first sight, would seem to be the First Sermon in the Deer-Park near Benares. But the Buddha sits between two standing Bodhisattvas carrying flywhisks, and above are two Devas carrying a crown to set it on his monk's head. LOTUS SUTRA If this is not the First Sermon, can it be the Last -"The Last Sermon which I preach in this world, the highest of all, which I have kept to myself and never preached22" - the sermon which opened the Mahdydnist Canon, the Saddharma-pundarfka siitra, 'Lotus of the Good Law'23? - A re-interpretation of the 'Lotus Sfitra' occupies much of Mus' Note24. It was a carefully designed polemical work of the early Mahdydna, purporting to record the schism as it occurred in the apparent lifetime of the Buddha on earth. From the very beginning the dull and narrow views of the proud old Buddhist orthodoxy are made to confront the vast horizons of Mahdydnist imagining. In Chapter I Ajita (Maitreya), the old type of single Bodhisattva, admits that he does not know the 'Lotus' sermon which the Buddha is about to preach. Mafijusri, one of the leaders of the 8oooo new Bodhisattvas assembled to hear it, instructs him at length. Until he knows and accepts the 'Lotus', he cannot attain equality with the newcomers. The role of the Bodhisattva is now no longer a pale reflection of that of the Buddha, but (as Thomas says on p. i89) "one of long training, a progress rising in stages to Buddhahood". In Chapters II and III the Buddha himself addresses Sdriputra, and the old school of arhats, irdvakas and pratyekabuddhas, who have already reached Nirvdna. "Sdriputra!," he says, "there is only One Vehicle (eka ydna). No second or third Vehicle exists." But Buddhas adapt themselves to their audience: "they show Nirvana to those of low dispositions." Sdriputra is amazed, and fears it may be Mdra speaking. Five thousand of the monks and devotees of both sexes, full of pride, rise from their seats, and after worshipping the Buddha, leave the assembly. "The Buddha declares that the meeting has been cleared of rubbish, and that it is well that the proud ones are gone"25. The sermon proper is not reached till Chapter XV. The assembly has now risen from earth into space, and become a lokottara assembly; and the Buddha's audience now consists only of Bodhi- sattvas. - Why? - It is because, accepting his words which promise all of them future Buddhahood, each is now truly launched on the "Great Vehicle". The Buddha tells them that he once spent a thousand years as servant to a monk - Devadatta. "Therefore, some day, Devadatta will become a Buddha." Nirvana is an illusory idea: "the true goal is Omniscience". - At the end of the sermon the Buddha, seen in this lokottara assembly in his Body of Beatitude (sathbhoga kdya) according to the 5th century Yogdcdra School, receives the worship of his vast audience, including objects of adorn- ment "from Gadgadasvara and Avalokitesvara" (Mus, p. I97). A crown, it seems, is not mentionedin the text; iconography suggests that it was included. 21 Cf. the two standing figures supporting the column crowned with the Wheel of the Law, on the Gateway of Stupa 3 at Safic!

I95), is found already in Gandahran art on the Sikri bas-reliefs26. It is based, says Foucher, on the older group showing the Buddha preaching in Thvatiihsa between Indra and Brahmd. A sculp- ture showing the Buddha seated in pralambana'sana with hands in dharmacakra mudrd, between two standing Bodhisattvas, was found at Takht-i-Bahl. Spooner, who illustrates it27, identifies the Bo- dhisattva on the left (the Buddha's right) as Maitreya, and the one holding the lotus on the right (the Buddha's left) as Avalokitesvara. Comparing this group to "much older" triad-sculptures which he had found at Sahri-bahlol28, he notes that "the Bodhisattvas are seen to have changed sides.. . There we find Maitreya in the place of honour on the left, here in the later stone this position is given to Avalo- kite~vara. Does this not seem to harmonize with the development of Buddhist doctrine as we know it?" MAITREYA AT MAHAMUNI That Maitreya once reigned in solitary state among Burma Bodhisattvas, is seen in the iconography. What he was like, perhaps in the 7th century A.D.29, at his coming to North Arakan from East Bengal, is seen in the glorious bronze from Mahdmuni30 - in royal splendour of a young Immortal, flowerless, seated in padmasana full-face, holding the ambrosia jar3l, his breast looped and hung with jewels, the ear-ornaments and crown composing a rich many-pointed diadem above, and a buoyant lotus-throne below, with guttae spreading round him in cascade. PYU MAITREYA AT SRI KSETRA AND PAGAN The elaborate ornament of the Mahdmuni Maitreya is borne with perfect grace. This cannot be said of several dowdy bronze Maitreyas found in early Pagan. One from Shwehsandaw relic-chamber (PI. 444 a, b)32, has a line of Pyu at the base identifying it as "the honourable Metriya". Duroiselle suggests that Aniruddha, who built this pagoda, brought this small image from the old Pyu capital and enshrined it here. "The legs do not cross, but the feet meet at the middle, with the soles turned upwards. The right knee is slightly raised and rests on what appears to be a cushion. The figure pos- sesses all the attributes of a king: crown, ear-rings, necklets, armlets, bracelets, anklets and a waist- 26 See Foucher, "Les bas-reliefs du stfipa de Sikri", Journal Asiatique I903, II, pp. 232-3. The fly-whisk bearers who often stand beside the Buddha in the Karli and Ajanta Caves and gri Ksetra sculptures, also pass into Bod- hisattvas: see Sten Konow's note cited at A.S.B. i909, p.

The right arm is stretched out; the wrist resting on the knee, and the fingers are slightly bent as if holding something. The left arm has broken off just below the shoulder, but the wrist and hand may be seen resting on the knee, palm upwards"33. Two similar small Maitreyas, seated, have been found at Paga'n: one (P1. 444 c, d), at Paunggu on the riverbank between the Mingalazedi and Myinkaba; the other (P1. 444 e, f), found (if the label is trustworthy) in a "stone mound W. of the Myazedi, 4 furlongs W. of the main road"; this might also mean the Paunggu. "The Paunggu pagoda", says Duroiselle34, "now crumbled into a large mound of debris, is ascribed to king Kyanzittha". The two bronzes have no writing on them. On the former the pointed usnisa is conspicuous; on the latter the headdress is rounded, but the braided tresses hang prominently at the back. All three Maitreyas face front. All are dowdily dressed, with a broad belt across the waist, and starlike stomacher in front. All rest their hands on their knees, and sit with legs uncrossed, right knee slightly raised, left flat, toes almost meeting in the centre. All have a long upavfta trailing from left shoulder and right arm, and forming a loop in front of the feet. In no case is there a lotus throne, or flower, or stem of a flower to play with. At gri Ksetra, a stone relief found on Shw6-nyaung-bin ridge35 shows Gotama Buddha touching Earth on the left, with Maitreya seated beside him on the right (the Buddha's left). The latter, whose head reaches only as high as the Buddha's shoulder, is similar to, though much more elegant than the Pagan bronzes. He faces front, hands resting on knees, feet not crossed but toes meeting in the centre. He wears a star-like stomacher. The upavfta loops symmetrically from both shoulders to the top of the toes. A similar but less elegant stone image, now at Mandalay Archaeological Office, comes from Pagan (P1. 4Ii b), from a ruin about ioo yards W. of Kyazin temple. It shows an outsize lotus throne with plain back-slab, and two seated figures: Gotama Buddha touching Earth, with (possibly) his alms- bowl resting on his left hand in the lap; and on the right (the Buddha's left) a crowned Bodhisattva, doubtless Maitreya, almost as tall as the Buddha. His hands rest on right knee and left thigh; his right leg, here no doubt in deference to Indian tradition, hangs and rests on a projection of the lotus. The stomacher is gone. Apart from crown and torque and the usual royal ornaments, he wears only a dhoti, and a cord slung from his left shoulder. A plaster image of a high-crowned Bodhisattva, with torque, necklaces, ear-ornaments, waist-belt, etc., was found by U Mya in a small temple facing west, S.E. of the Nagayon (P1. 4II c). He sits in ardhaparyankasana, right knee raised, on a drum-like 'wooden' stool with waist. His right hand hangs naturally over his knee; his left rests on his thigh or the seat behind it. This Bodhisattva, too, may well be Maitreya. All these Maitreya images so far, except the Mahdmuni bronze, fit easily the Theravdda Canon. A distinctive Pyu type for Maitreya has clearly evolved, and been accepted. Difficulties, however, arise when two Bodhisattvas are required to fit the Mahdydnist pattern. The only instance I know of an attempt to fit the old Pyu Maitreya into a Triad, is a heavy bronze (or iron ?) tablet, and several 33 I doubt the "palm upwards". It is not confirmed by the other bronze Maitreyas mentioned below. 3 A.S.I. I927, pp. i65-6. See our PI. I53 for some stone sculptures recovered in I9I5-i6 from the Paunggu ruin.

The bronze has no writing; the terracottas have a few Pyu characters below the lotus throne in the centre. Both show the Buddha seated in the centre, right foot on left, right hand raised sideways before the body in abhaya mudra, the left sup- porting it from below. To the right, on a slightly lower throne, sits a dowdy Maitreya, similar to the other three Pagan bronzes, with star-like stomacher and upavfta looping beyond the meeting toes. To the left, also on a throne slightly lower than that of the central Buddha, sits another Buddha, touching Earth; his left hand (in the bronze, not the terracottas) holds an almsbowl. All three figures have solid stupas above them. Duroiselle regarded the figure on the left (the Buddha's right) as Maitreya, prematurely promoted to Buddhahood. The Bodhisattva on the right he took to be Avalokite~vara. While not denying that Maitreya is sometimes shown, in India at all events, as a Buddha37, I cannot ignore the Burma evi- dence. The link with Pyu in the Pagan plaque is plain; and Maitreya's seat on the right (the proper left) of the Buddha, corresponds exactly with the Shw6-nyaung-bin sculpture of Ari Ksetra. The second Buddha in this Triad I can only regard as aberrant: Earth-touching should represent the Enlighten- ment; Almsbowl in lap usually points to the Pdrileyyaka retreat. The artist, I fancy, felt the need of balance in his Triad, and was not particular how he got it. This need of Balance in the Triad, and of Contrast between the Bodhisattvas and the Buddha, was real. The Buddha in the centre must remain symbolic, foursquare, solemn, hieratic. The Bodhisattvas, on the other hand, should sit in 'attitude of pastime', diagonally posed, both legs and both hands contrasted, body often in tribhanga, twined or framed in climbing flower-stems. The stolid Pyu Maitreya was incapable of this; nor had he Indian tradition to support him. He was just a local product, seated in no known Indian dsana or mudrd. The single Bodhisattva cult is of early origin, I think, in Buddhist Burma. At grl Ksetra two carved megaliths have been found - huge thick stones faced with trefoil or cinquefoil arching and clec spires, the oldest pediments we have. Both show a crowned god or Bodhisattva beneath. Only the top part of one of them survives. It was found sunk in the ground near Kanbyin (Shw6daga N.) gate38, just south of the point where the railway cuts through the city-wall in the direction of Prome. Perhaps it served as a gate-guardian. A similar megalith, large but fragmented, was found at Nat-yaukkya-gan39, just north of the railway-line about a mile N.W. of Kyaukka Thein, where the megaliths are now housed. This latter sculpture shows a Bodhisattva (?) seated in ardhaparyakakdsana, left hand on knee, within a trefoil arch with clec pediment. A small royal figure kneels on each side near his feet. Below, sit four Guardians (Lokapalas ?), two on each side of the recessed throne, holding weapons over their shoulders. Other large stone figures in relief have been found at gri Ksetra, with clubs over their shoulders: these are clearly Dvdrapdlas40. The favourite form of early Buddhist sculpture at gri Ksetra was the Triad - the seated Buddha flanked either by two stupas, or by Devas, Bodhisattvas or adorants. Such figures are found on the 36 See also Duroiselle, A. S.I. I928, pp. I25-6 and PI. LIV a.

But it is sometimes hard to say what or who the flanking figures are meant to be. When they are standing, as in two of the LUmyet-hna sculptures42, they are heavily skirted and stand proudly, hand on hip, on either side of the earth-touching Buddha. Are they Indra and Brahmd, or Bodhisattvas ? Duroiselle describes "a piece of sculpture" from Nyaungnibin mound as "unfortunately broken... It represents a Buddhist triad carved in relief on three sides of a rect- angular block of stone. This triad is no doubt ... the Buddha with Maitreya and Avalokitegvara"43. In the East Z6gu sculptures, where the First Sermon is presented, they are pretty clearly Bodhi- sattvas passing into flywhisk-bearers. The development of the Triad is best studied in the votive tablets of trl Ksetra45. Here the influence of North Indian Mahdydna is evidenced abundantly. As the tablets take on round or oval shapes, two (or three) tiers of triads are often found. At Zokthok (Thaton district), near Kio~kdak (Htizaung) pagoda, one of the later laterite images (for it has a reredos)46 shows a Bodhisattva with high jatamukuta, seated in ardhaparyahka, right knee raised, left flat. The style reminds one of the stone Devas or Bodhisattvas found on the terraces of Mahdmuni in N. Arakan47. LOKANATHA IN BURMA From the 7th century A.D., if not earlier, a new Mahayanist Bodhisattva, Lokandtha (a form of Avalokitesvara), came to Burma from Bengal48. He must have been popular, for his single images, both votive tablets and bronzes, have already been found at grl Ksetra49, Kanbe (near Twant6)50, Pegu51, Minbu52, Kanthit (Pakokku)53, and in several parts of Pagan54. Lokandtha was said to be "the Lord of the World" during the interval between Gautama's parinirvdna and the coming of Maitreya5 . In Burma he is usually (not always56) shown seated in lalitasana on double lotus, his open 41 Buddhist megaliths: Kyaukka Thein (N. group of Triads): Arch. Neg. 424 (i906-07). A.S.I. i9i0, P1.

Both are identified by Old Burmese glosses.</page><page sequence="210">I92 Chapter X right hand stretched across his knee in varada mudrd, his left hand coiled or toying with a climbing lotus-stalk, which flowers above his left shoulder. Another lotus-stalk may also rise above his right shoulder into flower. The earliest Lokandthas so far found in Burma come from grl Ksetra, Kanthonzin hill (see note 48). They are tiny oval votive tablets, 7th century, some with Pyu writing on the rounded reverse. The central figure is the haloed Bodhisattva. who sits (as usual) in lalitasana, varada mudrd, his left hand holding the stem of a lotus which flowers above. Another lotus, rising on the left of the tablet, supports a stupa. A line of Ndgarl writing runs round the rim. The two finest specimens are from Paga'n, in bronze (PI. 446 a, b). Dr. Ray describes them57: - "In each case the right hand is in the varada mudra, and the left gracefully holds the stalk of a lotus- flower. On the right and left side there rise the stout stalks of lotus-flower in a delicate curve ending in flowers and foliage. Both figures are richly ornamented with necklace, waistband, karnapfiras [flower- ornaments for the ears], armilets, wristlets and anklets, which are all elaborately, though not very delicately, moulded. Their heads are crowned with a jajtd-mukuqta consisting of long locks of curly hair. The iconographic features of these two images conform exactly to the sddhanas devoted to the Lokandtha variety of Avalokitegvara". - There is a fascination about the Pawdawmu bronze - the smiling Bodhisattva, at once rich and ascetic, firm and spacious amid his revel of diagonals. With such a guide, one feels, the road to Buddhahood would not be arid, however difficult or long58. Aniruddha himself is connected with two distinct types of seated Lokandtha tablets: one, the Pakokku Kanthit type (P1. 7) and its duplicates from Paga'n Shw6-gu-gyi and Kanbe near Twant6 (PI. 54 a, b); the other, found with 'seals' of Aniruddha and the Twant6 pot in his ruined pagoda near the Seinnyet, Pagan (PI. 54 c), and its weathered duplicate from Minbu or Paunglin (PI. 54 d). Com- mon to both types is the essential pose of the Bodhisattva: head tilted to the left: lalitasana with right leg hanging; right hand on knee in varada mudrd; left arm coiled with lotus flowering over left shoulder; perhaps also Amitdbha Buddha, seated in dhydna mudrd in the headdress, which is certain in the Kanbe/Kanthit type, and probable in that of Minbu. The peculiarities of the Pagan/Minbu tablets are: no stupas at the sides; concave lotus bed below the double lotus, giving an oval look to the plaque as a whole; vertical lotus-stem dividing the Ndgarl inscription; large umbrella with broad streamers at the top; flame-nimbus and shoulder-frame, suggestive of the old wooden reredos, instead of the later trefoil arch and gikhara with dmalaka and stupa finial; Lokandtha's left hand does not hold the lotus-stem, but rests on the shin while the lotus climbs the crook of his elbow. The Buddhist 'Credo' in Ndgari is common to both, but its arrangement differs. MAHAYANIST TRIADS If Gandhdran India is any guide, it seems probable, and has been generally assumed, that in the Mahdydnist Triads the Bodhisattvas shown are Maitreya and Avalokite~vara (Lokanatha). On Aniruddha's own tablets showing 3I figures (the 28 Buddhas, etc. - Pls. IO, ii), and 5 figures (3 Buddhas and 2 Bodhisattvas - P1. 8), and also on queen Trilokavatarmsakd's 5 figure tablet (PI. 8 c), 57 Nihar-ranjan Ray, Sanskrit Buddhism in Burma (Calcutta, 1936), p. 48, and figs. 6, 7. 58 Another fine bronze Lokanatha, seated, comes from Yinmabin, W. of Mbnywa and the Chindwin. It is now in the possession of U Soe Tin, Commissioner of Sagaing. It may date, perhaps, from the post-Pagan or Early Ava period.</page><page sequence="211">Chapter X I93 the Bodhisattva on the left (the Buddha's right) fits perfectly with Lokandtha. He sits therefore in the place of honour. The Bodhisattva on the right (the Buddha's left) is therefore Maitreya. If so, it is clear that the old Pyu model for Maitreya has been rejected, and a new type created - the exact verso, as it were, of Lokandtha: seated with right leg flat, left hanging; left hand open on left knee in varada mudra, right hand before the body holding a flower-stalk (if any). But this arrangement will apply only to Aniruddha's court. Before him, at 8ri Ksetra, and also probably after him, the balance and contrast required between Buddha and Bodhisattvas, were obtained in other ways. The problem was not a simple matter of aesthetic preference, though (artists being what they are) aesthetics must have played a part. The sddhanas, 'realizations' or formulas for invocation, in India at all events, imposed a pretty rigid hold on Hindu and Mahdydnist iconography. Each Bodhisattva had his own fixed colour, mudra, a-sana, sometimes his vahana (vehicle), his attributes and symbols. If Aniruddha (as I think) made Maitreya the simple verso of Lokandtha, he was contravening the sddhanas. Lok- anatha's flower is the Lotus, Maitreya's the Nagakesara (Mesita ferrea, Burmese 'gangaw')59. MAITREYA IMAGES But there was certainly some freedom, or lack of rigidity, in the Indian representation of Maitreya. Bhattacharyya says80 that "when as a minor god, he accompanies others, he generally carries the chowrie [flywhisk] in the right hand and the Ndgakesara flower in the left." But "he may be re- presented as a standing figure. . .holdingin his right hand the stalk of a lotus. He is distinguished from Padmapdni mainly by the figure of a small Caitya which he bears on his crown. . . The small Caitya... is said to refer to the belief that a Stflpa in the mount Kukkutapada near Bodh-Gayd covers a spot where Kdayapa Buddha is lying. When Maitreya would descend to earth, he would go direct to the spot, which would open by magic, and receive from Kdayapa the garments of a Buddha". Alice Getty also mentions6' the Stilpa in the headdress as one of his distinctive marks. She tells the same story concerning it. She says the ndga is his flower, and either dharmacakra, varada or vitarka is his mudrd. "He may be without a crown and have the Stflpa in his hair." Fragments of a distinctive early bronze image were found in I937 at Paya-gyi, 8ri Ksetra62: per- haps a standing figure; but except for a broken hand, thought to be in vitarka mudri, nothing below the waist remains. The torso is that of a monk, with robe and flap falling diagonally from the left shoulder. But the head is not that of a monk nor Buddha: it is tightly covered with fine combed hair; surmounted with a high cylindrical jatamukuta, in front of which is a small model of a caitya. Though there are no royal ornaments characteristic of a Bodhisattva, this must be Maitreya. The technique looks more like that of a worker in stone than in bronze. The face is long, the lips and nose finely modelled. The ears have long open lobes. The profile falls straight from hair to nose-tip. Two other bronzes, found at Pagan, may also represent Maitreya. One (P1. 428 b), a tiny image, i} in. high, was found "in the debris inside a ruined temple near the Shw6hsandaw pagoda63. This appears to have formed part of the retinue of an image of the Buddha or a dhydni Buddha." He sits in 'I Old Mon hajnu', Old Burm. katikaw sanuiw. See Bhattacharyya, Ind. Bud.

The other bronze (P1. 445 a), seated in smiling ecstasy, elegant and Indian in style, was found by U Mya in a mound N. of Tawya-gyaung64: "a small but very fine bronze image of a Bodhisattva seated in the lalita mudyr on a lotus seat. The hair is done into a high muku ta, but without a crown. A sash is seen round the body, and the lower garment is a pair of close-fitting trousers. The right hand is raised in the abhaya mudrd, and the left is resting on a lotus. The total height of the figure is 34 in." - Dr Ray corrects 'lotus': "two nagakesara stems rise on two sides in delightful curves, forming a frame as it were"; and identifies the image as "probably Maitreya"65. Alice Getty notes that "the bronze and stone images of Mi-lo-fu (Maitreya) of the 6th century A.D. are usually standing, with the right hand in abhaya mudrd, and the left in vara mudra. She adds that at Yiin-kang and Lung-men in North China "there are many examples of Maitreya seated European fashion, but the feet are crossed."66 Perhaps this explains the unusual pose of our image, with the flat left leg resting on the right thigh. In Indian iconography the right hand takes precedence of the left: the mundrd of the right hand is often the determining mark. Art knows no such predilections. In Burma, no doubt, liberties were taken, with the result that it is often difficult to distinguish the Bodhisattvas of a Triad. Thus an elaborate Paga'n bronze with flaming halo and reredos (P1. 434 b) apparently illustrates the First Sermon; it has Bodhisattvas seated at the sides, both with right hands raised in abhaya mudrd. Are they different or one? At Kanbe (near Twante) an important stone sculpture (to which we shall recur) shows the two standing Bodhisattvas at the sides both hanging their right hands in varada mudra67. Can they be distinguished? On a two-tiered votive tablet from Tawadeintha Kywegyaunggon, Srl Ksetra68, the two standing Bodhisattvas of the upper tier both droop their right hands and raise their left in abhaya mudrd; while those of the lower tier, in balanced contrast, sit with their inner knees up, their outer down. - In general, it seems, the tri Ksetra artists were willing to sacrifice iconographic rules to artistic convenience; and were helped in this, no doubt, by the bewildering complexity of the former. If Avalokite~vara had, as Bhattacharyya informs us, "as many as io8 different forms"69, the Pyu artist need not be nice. AVALOKITE9VARA IMAGES As a matter of fact, a Burma image of Avalokite~vara is usually easy to identify by the figure of Amitdbha in his headdress. The "Watchful Lord"70, says Bhattacharyya, "also called Padmapani ('Lotus-Bearer'), is the spiritual son of the Dhydni Buddha Amitdbha" (p. 88). "Out of the I5 different forms of Avalokitesvara mentioned above, I4 bear the figure of Amitdbha on the crown" (p. I25). Amitdbha must be shown seated in samadhi or dhydna mudrd (p. 49): if seated in bhiisparsa (earth- 64 U Mya, A.S.I. I930-34, Part I, p. i8o; Part II, P1. C b. Arch.

The beautiful bronze standing Bodhisattva with four arms (two lost), recovered from a terrace of the Bawbaw-gyi, grl Ksetra, was first identified by Duroiselle as Avalokitesvara7l, and later corrected by Dr. Ray as Mafijugri72, for this very reason. "The two feet [of the image] are broken off, and ... also the left arm above the elbow, so that the attributes held in the two left hands have been lost. . . The second right hand, at the back of the first ... holds what appears to be the book, that is, a small bundle of palm leaves tied round with a string." The front right hand is raised in vitarka mudrd. "The right knee is slightly bent, causing the left hip to protrude slightly and grace- fully... The forehead is marked with the iuri.. The dress is that usually worn by Bodhisattvas, with necklace, armlets, girdle, and below the latter, running across the loins, a sash, tied in a graceful knot on the left hip, and falling all along the left leg. The whole figure is exquisitely worked. It is proba- bly not later than the 6th-8th century". Ray dates the image c. 7th-8th century A.D. He notes, as new to Burma, "the curve of the lips, and the rather heavy modelling of the nose"73. One or two other images of Avalokitesvara have been found at 8r! Ksetra. A hideous gold image with six arms comes from the north bank of Yindaikkwin74; "made of thin gold plate from which the mould has not been removed. Two of the hands are in the vitarka mudrd", says Duroiselle, "and the remaining ones carry... a lotus with stalk, a chowrie, a trident, and an indistinct object which may have been a noose or a rosary. Height 2J in." It is said to sit in lalitasana: perhaps rather in ardha- paryainka, or the 'old Maitreya' pose - with toes almost meeting in the centre. Another image, of bronze, from the same site shows only the head and torso of a two-armed standing Bodhisattva75 - possibly Avalokite~vara. Forearms and legs are lost. It is richly but dowdily adorned after the Pyu style; but the head (as on several Pyu bronzes of 8ri Ksetra) has character and beauty of its own. It bears a striking resemblance to two much more elegant bronze fragments - head and torso of a Bodhisattva: one at Mandalay Archaeological Office76, the other at Pegu, Shwemawdaw platform museum. Finally, there is a small bronze standing image at Pagan (P1. 447 a)77, with Amitabha clearly visible in the high crown. It "stands in a slight tribhanga pose, with the right hand in varada mudrad, and the left holding a lotus stalk". Ray dates it c. ioth-iith century. This is the correct Indian type, full of quiet dignity. 71 Duroiselle, A.S.I. I9I2, PP. I43-5 and PI. LXVIII, fig. 6. Arch. Neg. 973 (I9II-I2). Height 81 in.

There is some doubt, as Duroiselle admitted, about the right forearm of the Dhyani Buddha in the headdress. Personally, I still incline to Duroiselle's identification; if only because no certain representation of Mafijuiri (Arapacana) has yet been found in Old Burma. I do not know the stone sculpture in the Ananda Museum to which Dr. Ray refers (p. 46). Has there been confusion with the 'Tonsure Scene' ? 73 Ray thinks the image may have been brought from Cambodia. It reminds me rather of the broken stone relief of a standing figure which Duroiselle found at Let-khat-taung, Vesali, Arakan: "all that can be seen of the dress ... is a girdle tied in a knot on the left hip, the folds of which fall gracefully down just below the knee" (A.S.B.

The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Tantra, says Professor Filliozat78 (I collate his views here summarily with those of Dr. Bhattacharyya79), are generally the same as those of Mahdydna at the height of its development. But the chief ones are now assigned a cosmic role, systematically defined; and end by taking to themselves female Energies (gakti), which represents their activity in the world. Apart from the Buddhas who take human form in order to preach to men, such as kkyamuni, Diparhkara, etc., and over and above them, is formed a group of five Buddhas, called the five Jina or Tath1gata. In European books, following the information given to B. H. Hodgson in Nepal (first half of the i9th century), these are generally called Dhyini Buddha, 'Meditation Buddhas', though the term is not found in the original texts80. Corresponding to these are the Mdnusi Buddha 'human Buddhas'. "The pantheon of the Northern Buddhists" says Dr. Bhattacharyya (p. 42), "revolves round the theory of the five Dhydni Buddhas. The Buddhists believe that the world is composed of five cosmic elements or skandhas". ..: riupa (Form), vijnidna (Thought), vedand (Sensation), saijnd (Perception) and sathskdra (Conception). "These elements are eternal cosmic forces and are without a beginning or an end. These cosmic forces are deified in Vaj- rayana as the five Dhydni Buddhas." In iconography each is given a name, a sphere (mandala), an element and corresponding part of the body, a colour, a mudrd, a vehicle (vihana), and a symbol.

When scientific excavation of our oldest cities is undertaken here, we may expect to find some of them. They are generally divisible into Benign (like Lokandtha) or Terrible (like Heruka) or both (like Mdrici). Agood many are taken from Hinduism, especially 8aivism - Brahma, Ganapati (Ganesa), Jambhala, Sarasvati, Yama, Mahakdia, etc. All forces in the universe are at the disposal of the Thntric adept, exempt from shame and disgust. As for human passions, "they will not dominate him, but he them. Instead of having to break their energy in order to progress, he will employ them as a master to aid his advance." Erotic Thntrism hardly appears at Pagan until near the end of the dynasty. All five Dhydni Buddhas appear on the small slab (now lost) which was reported in I915 at Kanbe village E. of Twant682. This shows a haloed Buddha erect - right hand in abhaya, left in varada mttdrd - between two small Bodhisattvas, each standing in tribhanga pose, right hands in varada M'udrd, left holding a flower-stalk (on the left, a lotus). Above their heads are two well-carved caityas; and above these, forming an arch across the top of the slab, are the five Dhydni Buddhas, each seated on his lotus throne (with reredos), in his proper mudri. Such showing of the five Jina is common on mediaeval images in Vaitga (East Bengal). It is also found at Mahobd in Central India83. Vikramapura, modern Rdmpdl, where several of such images are seen, is south of Dacca. It was a capital or fortress under the Candra, Yddava and Sena dynasties from the ioth to the 12th centuries84. Like Patikkard south-east of it, where Cundd had a temple85, it seems to have had contacts with Burma - by sea and land, perhaps, with Lower Burma and Pagan, by land with Arakan. TARADEVI Apart from painting, three images, or types of image, of the goddess Tdrd have so far been found in Burma86: - (i) An elliptical votive tablet from Nga Shin'kan, 8ri Ksetra87, shows the graceful standing image of a two-armed Tdrd in tribhaitga pose, her right hand drooped in varada mudrd, her left arm twined with the lotus stalk, which flowers above her shoulder. To the left of her head is a caitya. Below, on (p. 24), and dates c. 300 A.D. (pp. I2-I5). "Here for the first time are found the descriptions of the five Dhydni Buddhas, their mantras, their Mandalas, and their gaktis" (p. 32). Dr. E. J. Thomas (The History of Buddhist Thought, pp. 295-6) speaks slightingly of the value of the work. - Personally, without accepting all Dr. Bhatta- charyya's large conclusions, I find it very useful. 80 Thomas (op. cit., p. 248) objects to the use of the term dhydni buddha, which has never been found, he says, outside Hodgson's writings. Prof. F. Edgerton admits the term in brackets to his Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictio- nary (I953), p. 287: "I have failed to note any actual occurrence in my texts. P. Mus calls them 'transcendent' Buddhas in his searching study" ("L'origine des Cinq Jina," Barabuqdur, p. 577ff.). 81 See also N. K. Bhattasali, Iconography ... Dacca Museum, pp. i6-22.

(ii) A bronze image, 3 in. high, comes from a ruined temple near Manawgon village, Myothit town- ship, Magw6 district (P1. 447 c, d). Here Tdradevi sits in padmasana on a down-turned lotus pedestal. Her right hand rests on her knee in varada mudrd, her left holds out the stalk of the blue lotus (utpala, Nymphaea caerulea), which flowers above. The pose is similar to that of the seated Lokandtha, but his lotus is the padma, Nelumbiitm speciosum. She wears tongue-like armlets and a tongue-like crown; her hair is flattened like a plate at the back of her head. The "deep navel, slender waist, and well- developed bosom", says Taw Sein Ko, "indicate Indian origin." Judging by Nepalese models, he dates it gth-ioth century A.D. - perhaps iith century is more probable. (iii) The small bronze standing Tdrd, which used to be at Paga'n Museum (P1. 447 b) appears to be lost.

[Ornaments: -] kundala (earrings), keyfira armletss), mekhalU (girdle), c. ioth-iith celnt."88. All these three Tdrds may well be the Green (Syamn) or Cutch-forest (Khadiravanf) Tara, an ema- nation of Amoghasiddhi89. PAINTINGS OF BODHISATTVAS We come finally to the paintings. U Mya has seen, and demonstrated, that the Tantric Mahaydnist paintings of Kyanzittha's reign were not just frivolous exercise of erotic or horrific fancy, but a deeply considered view of Buddhist life leading from earth to heaven. No less may be claimed for the Thera- vada paintings. To the thoughtful Yogacdrin of Pagan, no less than the Theravddin, Buddhism was not just a creed to be accepted, but rather a life of confident endeavour to be lived. If Pagan was, as I believe, a great period, when Mon and Burman reached their full stature, it was (I think) because so many of them joined in making it the business of their common lives to attain Bodhicitta, the Buddhist goal, or goals. In porches and other portals of Pagan temples, one often finds, on either side of the entrance, a giant Bodhisattva painted. They may have many arms, loaded with weapons, and have sometimes been taken for Visnu90, or else for Dvarap5las to warn off evil-doers. That, doubtless, was often the intention; but sometimes there was a higher aim. Study the colossal ten-armed standing Bodhisattva- paintings9 of the E. porch of Rdjakumdr's temple (III3 A.D.). All but two of his attributes seem certain; but we cannot yet give him a name. The paintings are in three tiers, "suggestive" as U Mya says, "of the hierarchy of the figures." At the bottom are the gaktis, who are his 'strength'92. But for all his size and height and physical prowess, he is still an underling, not yet promoted to the lotus throne of spiritual rebirth. Above him, higher though far smaller, sit the Brahmds, happy in 88 Ray, Sanskrit Buddhism.. . ., fig. 4, and pp. 46 (n. 2 should be n. i) and III. 89 Bhattacharyya, Ind. Bud. Ic., pp. 226-7, 307.

That state, too, is attainable by anyone who strives towards it. But it is not the highest end. Highest and smallest of all (for such is the weak nature of our human perspective), is the endless line of Arhats. That, for the Theravddin, is the goal. ABLYADANA CORRIDOR, OUTER WALL The Yogac5rin's goal, different but not far different from the Theravadin's, receives its fullest and finest statement on the outer walls of the Abeyadana corridor. That temple was built (c. I090 A.D.) by Kyanzittha's chief queen, a Bengal Malidydnist I imagine, while the king himself was building, just across the road, his first Theravdda temple. Because of the darkness and the grime of ages, the casual visitor is not likely to notice either the delicacy of the painting or the grandeur of the design. But a small typical section of the wall, from near-floor to vault, which U Mya has had faithfully copied in all its detail, gives an exact idea of the artist's method and intention9. The East, South, and West walls are each cut by three perforated windows, with two tiers of archways, upper and lower, on the inner side, each framed with rich paintings of receding roofs or terraces, climbing to a caitya at the peak. Between the two tiers of archways runs a continuous band of painting showing a series of Caves, each with a scene (often Thntric) depicted within them. Below this central band between the archways, are two tiers of seated Bodhisattvas; above it, two taller tiers showing standing Bodhisattvas, and immediately above them, seated Buddhas. - The theme is here the Mahdydnist one: the ascent, not to Arhatship (as in the Kubyauk-gyi), but to Buddhahood. ASCENT TO BUDDHAHOOD "The images in the lowest row" says U Mya, "are invariably seated in the ardhaparyanka attitude, each wearing a high mukuta, a crown, earrings and other Bodhisattva ornaments, and in some cases felt boots." They sit constricted, like kings at ease (rdjalfldsana). They have not yet attained lotus seats, nor have they yet disciples. "They are non-Tdntric in form; each has one face and two arms, and the attributes they carry in their hands are lances, clubs, cakras, daggers in various shapes, vajras, swords and books." "The images in the [second tier] are seated in lalita mudra on double lotus with the right leg pendent, and the foot resting on a lotus, the stem of which is attached to the seat. They are also in non-Tdntric form, with two arms and a face. The right hand is resting on the right knee with the palm outward in the charity mudrd; the left is brought to the breast in the abhaya mudrd. A lotus springing from the seat below is seen above the left shoulder. A book is sometimes placed on the lotus as an additional attribute. Each image is flanked by two other gods both seated sideways on their folded legs. The latter are facing the central figure and are in the namaskdra mudr'". - The Bodhisattvas in this second tier seem all to be a generalized form of Lokandtha. Above these is the Thntric Cave-band; above which are the standing Bodhisattvas and the Buddhas. - The inference appears to be that the Bodhisattva, in order to attain full height and ultimate Buddha- hood, must pass through the Thntric ordeals. The common points and differences of the various Bod- hisattvas (some I28 altogether) will be considered in Chapter XVI. Not one of all these panels has 9 P1. 227. Arch. Neg. 3426 (I93I-32). Pict.

Perhaps those of the lowest, the second, and the fourth are generalized types of three grades of attainment, and such differences in attributes and attitudes as the paintings show, are merely to avoid monotony. TANTRIC CAVE SCENES The third or Cave Tier holds altogether about I28 panels of a different sort. Possibly they illustrate a continuous narrative, but I doubt it. The order of panels seems haphazard. The few as yet identi- fied with any certainty, illustrate Jdtakas or other Indian stories94. My own analysis of the main occupants of the Caves, includes I5 Buddhas; I5 Saints or Monks; 13 Bodhisattvas; I2 Tdrds; i6 Thntric deities; 29 Hermits; a number of Animals and an AsvamtkhT (horse-faced Yakkhini). Of the i3 Bodhisattvas, all have two arms only; nearly all are seated; 2 sit in ardhaparyaitkasana, 9 in lalitd- sana. Four or five of the latter resemble Lokandtha; but some have other poses - abhaya, vykhhydna, vitarka and dharmacakra. These may well represent different Bodhisattvas. Of the I2 Tdrds, all are shown seated alone, with a single head; 9 sit in lalitasana, 3 in padmdsana. 9 have two arms; 2 have four arms, i has 6 arms. Several of the two-armed deities can be identified with the Green (5ydmd or Khadiravan) Tdrd, an emanation of Amoghasiddhi. Apart from the 'green' colour (not obvious in our Tdrds, most of whom now look brown), the essential marks are the varada mutdrd, and the blue lotus (utpala) climbing up her left side (the right side of the image). In 4 or 5 instances the dharmacakra takes the place of varada mudrd. Bhattacharyya illustrates a Mahs4ri Tara, now in the Indian Museum95, Calcutta, seated in what may be the dharmacakra mudrd. The upper right hand of one four-armed Tara appears to hold a Book. Perhaps this is the four-armed Dhanada Tara ('the Prize-giver')96. -All these three 'peaceful' Tara's are emanations of Amogha- siddhi. Of the i6 Tantric deities, none has more than one head. About half appear to be male, and half female. Five with bushy hair look more like demons than gods. 9 have two arms, 3 have four arms, 4 (2 male, 2 female) have six arms. More than half the total, mostly males, are shown in 'fierce' aspects: with tusks and tushes, lolling tongues, necklaces of skulls; holding, or twined with, snakes; carrying off women; brandishing weapons or human heads. In the case of one - a six-armed figure, standing on a corpse (P1. 234 i) - I suggest identification with the Hindu goddess Camunda, who also enters the Tantric pantheon97: - "Camunda rides on a corpse and is of red colour. She is four-armed. With the first pair of hands she holds the kartri [knife] in the right, and the kapdla [skull-bowl] in the left. In the second she exhibits the an-jali." The description agrees pretty well with our painting. Six-armed varieties (Rudra-carcika) are mentioned by Bhattasali. The lovely fourth Tier consists of Standing Bodhisattvas (Pls. 238, 239). Only one holds the Lotus, but all are framed in it. So perhaps we should call them Avalokite~vara rather than Padmapani; but Amitabha is not shown in their head-dress. 94e.g. the story of Vaccha, the Kinnar! and the Spider, identified by U Mya, A.S.I.

They are treated more fully in Chapter XV1, in the section devoted to that temple. MAHAYANISTS AT SRI KSETRA The Mahdydna, as we have seen, reached Burma long before the Pagan period, in the 7th century A.D. if not earlier. It must have been more dominant in North Arakan, where Sanskrit was already the language of culture98, than at Sri Ksetra where Pali by that date was well entrenched. The chief Sanskrit text at Sri Ksetra - Sanskrit text with Pyu nissaya - is the unedited inscription on the four- sided pedestal of the headless Buddha found at Kan-wet-hkaung-gon99. It was the joint offering (after a quarrel) by Jayacandravarman and Harivikrama. The latter, as we know from his stone urn inscrip- tion, died in 695 A.D.100. But Sanskrit, of course, does not necessarily connote the Mahdydna. Clearer evidence of Mahdydnism is provided in the sculpture and images. The Bodhisattva megalith, over 6 ft. high, found at Nat-yaukkya-gon, must go back to the early days of the old capital. The bronze Avalokitesvara (?) from the Bawbaw-gyi, the gold plate image from Yindaikkwin, votive tablets showing, instead of the Buddha, four-armed Bodhisattvas or two-armed standing Tdrds, and several other proofs, may be added to the testimony of Hsiian-tsang (648 A.D.) and I-tsing (c. 675 A.D.)101, to prove the importance of Mahayana Buddhism at Sri Ksetra in the 7th-8th centuries. Mahdydnism was then at the height of its religious, philosophical and artistic potency; but it did not succeed in smothering the older and simpler cults. MAHAYANISTS AT PAGAN In the iith century the situation was different. Almost everywhere Buddhism was in retreat: before Neo-Confucianism in China; before the Brahmanic revival in Bengal; before the advance of Islam in North India; in Dvaravati (Siam), before the ambitions of the 8aivite rulers of Angkor; in Ceylon, before the conquests of the Colas; in Malaya, before Cola raids, Javanese revolts, and ever- growing commercialism. The Mahdydnists who came in numbers to Pagan were refugees rather than missionaries. Inter-marriages between the Courts of Pagan, Pegu, Patikkard and Polonnaruwa often reflected the needs of Buddhist self-defence. If East Bengal had been able to provide Aniruddha with the texts he wanted, Burma, like Nepal and Tibet, might have been Mahdydnist today. As it is, Paga'n was deeply indebted to Bengal for models of most of its iconography, and (I suspect) for much in its architecture. The Ablyadana is the crowning point of Mahdydnist influence here. 98 Probably the oldest inscription of Arakan is the East Face of the Shitthaung (now at Mrohaung), "about ioo lines in a small neat script" which "probably belongs to the 6th century A.D., though it might be as late as early in the 7th century." (E. H. Johnston, "Some Sanskrit Inscriptions of Arakan", Bull. S.O.A.S., London, Vol. XI, Part 2, pp. 359, 364). Possibly the lower parts may prove legible. See I.B., P1. IV, 346, 347. Note that on p. 364 of his article, more than once, Johnston writes "west" for "east" face of the Shitthaung pillar. He did not live, alas, long enough to check his manuscript. 991 I.B., P1.

The necessity to seal and extend the eastern frontiers of his kingdom was a strong motive; to absorb the Mon Buddhist refugees from North and South Siam, and to repel the Khmers. Dvaravati, as Pierre Dupont's valuable book has shown, had been strongly Theravadin since the 6th century A.D. The ancient spread of Mon, both population and culture, had been from east to west, not vice versa. The oldest Mon inscriptions of Siam102, like the oldest Khmer, date from about 600 A.D.-400 years older than the oldest Burma Mon. The Theravdda influence of the Mons of Dvdravati may have been great on the 8ri Ksetra Pyu. Finot, founder of the great French School of the Far East, and editor (in I9I2) of some of the oldest Pali inscriptions of 8ri Ksetra, thought it "not impossible that Siam borrowed [Theravdda Buddhism] from Pegu, and then transmitted it to its eastern neighbours"103. This view was reasonable at the time: but Dupont's subsequent work has convinced me that it is partly wrong; and that Dvdravati, not 8ri Ksetra nor Pegu, was the original radiating centre of the Theravdda in Further India. 102 See Cinquantenaire de la foundation de l'1Acole Franpaise d'Extrgme-Orient, S6ance du 2I mars I952, pp. 27-3I.

(Kyalk Sri) - Visnu Anantasayana (sr! Ksetra, Thatdn, Kawgun, Pagan) - Visnu images and temples at PagAn - Nat-hlaung-gyaung - Avataras - Ablyadana tondoes (Tantric gaivism) - Vedic gods and Dikpalas - Revanta. COMMON ORIGINS Buddhist iconography, from its origins in India, has had close connections with Hindu and Jain. Gaja-Laksmi (Old Mon Kydk Sir) - the goddess bathed by elephants - was a fertility-emblem common to Jainism, Vaisnavism, and Buddhism (the Bath of Maya). Ndga-hooded images are common to all three. The pose characteristic of Maya in the Nativity - one hand holding the tree-branch, one leg hooked to the stem or kicking it - was another fertility-emblem taken from pre-Aryan Tree-worship. The Old Vedic gods, Indra, Sflrya, etc. appear in Buddhism almost from the first. Deva, Yaksa, Gandharva, Ndga, Garuda, Kirtimukha, Makara, Vy~la, etc. continued to live vigorously in all the arts, no matter what the religion. Visnu has his Buddha-avatdra. Kyanzittha, a most pious Buddhist, claimed to be an Avatar of Visnu. Two temples (it seems) at Pagan were dedicated to Visnu. In Arakan, there is evidence of Vaisnavism1 before the coming of Saivism or the Mahdydna. Lower Burma Buddh- ism, both at Gri Ksetra and Thaton, was almost crossed, it seems, with Vaisnava Brahmanism. Siva appears rarely in Burma Buddhism; but for centuries he was supreme in North Arakan. The Thaton relief of Siva and Pdrvati (partly blown up by the Japanese) was once the grandest sculpture in Burma. More than one image of Siva has been discovered at Pagan. And the return of Saivite and old Vedic iconography, under the wing of Thntric Buddhism, is evident in the paintings of the Abeyadana (c. I090 A.D.). What images, other than those of Gotama Buddha, were admitted to the Buddhist temples and pagodas of Pagan? - The four Buddhas who have already appeared in this present bhadra kalpa, are the favourite theme of all Liy-myak-nhl ("Four Faces") or Kydk Pan ("Four Buddhas") pagodas, from Sri Ksetra onwards. When a fifth is added, it is of course the coming Buddha, Maitreya. The building of five-equal-sided temples posed difficult mathematical problems; but they were solved 1 See Bull. S.O.A.S., London, Vol. XI, Part 2, P1. V, Coins I to 4.

Ksetra, probably the earliest, also show the Conch: see A.S.I. I927, PI. XLII f.</page><page sequence="222">204 Chapter XI successfully at least nine times at Pagan2. Fifth Buddha from the last, Vessabhk, has a separate ter- racotta image devoted to him, engraved with name and eulogy in Pali, found in a Pagan relic-chamber (P1. 409 c). The 28 Buddhas are the main subject of relief-sculpture in Nagayon corridor (Pls. i95- 20I); and in paint appear in dozens of Pagan pagodas, their name and Bodhi-tree noted in glosses, Mon or Burmese, below each panel, and often their height, age-span, and (rarely) principal disciples. The first three, Tanhafikara, Medhafikara and Saranankara, are nearly always included; often with details about them not found in the Buddhavathsa. The Taingchut (Burmese) inscription (II79 A.D.) mentions the gilding of one image each of Sari- puttrd and Mokkaldn, and two images of Gavaipati3. Triad sculptures and votive tablets of Paga'n may be divided into the Mahdydnist ones, where the Buddha sits or stands between two Bodhisattvas (Lokandtha and Maitreya ?), and the Theravdda ones, where he sits between his two chief disciples (aggasdvaka) - Sdriputta on his right, and Moggalldna on his left} these latter are shown in monk's attire, with hands usually in worship (namaskdramudra). The finest image of this triad - a gold re- pouss6 plaque found at Myinpagan (see Frontispiece to Vol. II) - was once at Pagan Museum, but is now stolen and lost. GAVAIPATI Gavarhpati, 'Lord of Cattle', acts as spokesman for the Buddha (who calls him "my son"4) in two of the 'prophetic' Mon inscriptions of Kyanzittha. He was clearly a patron saint of the Mons. Mediaeval Mon inscriptions tell how he persuaded the Buddha to visit Sudsui* (Thaton) in Suvannabhfimi, and leave Hair and Tooth relics there. For his record in Indian Pali texts, see Malala- sekera's Dictionary of Pali Proper Names (I, pp. 756-8). In the Dul-wa (the first part of the Tibetan Visaya) apparently it is said that after the Buddha's death, Mahakassapa sent Punna specially to summon Gavarhpati to the conference, but Punna found him at the point of death himself. - This does not agree with our Mon inscriptions, where Gavatipati is busy, long after the Parinirvdna, executing the Buddha's orders: he was even to be present at the founding of grl Ksetra. He seems to have been a pre-orthodox Buddhist saint, and master of magic. In Burma he is associated in some mysterious way with Ganega6.

I057: in the inscriptions8 Anawrahta is represented as having had a statue of Gavarhpati carved out of a huge teak log; statuettes of his are still used in witch-craft ... A curious feature of this bronze image is that both figures have their eyes covered with their hands ... The union of a god of the Hindu pantheon with a great Buddhist saint, is typical of the blending, in Burma, of popular Hindu and Buddhist superstitions." In I930, on the finding of "a small pot-bellied and shaven-headed figure seated on a lotus" together with the Ganega illustrated at PI. 88 e, Duroiselle recurs to the subject9: - "Ganega and this 'pot-bellied' figure were once very popular among the Buddhists in Burma, and... were combined ... in witchcraft. . . " And he adds three drawings of the bronze found in I9I3 (our P1. 89 f, g). GANE?A (Pls. 88, 89) The elephant-headed god, is thus described in Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary: - "The god of wisdom and of obstacles (son of Viva and Pdrvati. . .). Though Ganega causes obstacles, he also removes them... He is represented as a short fat man with a protuberant belly, frequently riding on a rat or attended by one, and to denote his sagacity has the head of an elephant, which however has only one tusk. . ." - As the "Remover (of obstacles)", he was also called Vindyaka, from which his Old Burmese name, Mahdpinay purUlu0, is derived. This, according to tradition, was the original name, 'Mahapeinne&amp;, of the Shw6hsandaw, Aniruddha's pagoda11. "I have seen fragments of images of Ganega" says Dr. Ray12, "within the precincts of the Shw6hsandaw pagoda, Pagan, where they along with other Hindu divinities were placed at the corners of the different pyramidal stages as guardian deities of the Buddhist shrine." Ray is certainly right in saying that stone figures of Hindu deities were placed originally at the corners of the five terraces of the Shw6hsandaw. They guard, symbolically, the ascent of Mt. Meru (Sineru), with the Cillamanicetiya (the Shwehsandaw) of Thvatirhsa at the summit. PI. 84 a shows what the S.E. corner of the first terrace looked like in I905. The Hindu deities are now in fragments at the base or corners of the upper terraces (PI. 84 b, c,d, e). Among these, I have looked in vain for the distinctive elephant-head of Ganega; but several fragmen- tary images (P1. 84 d, e) show two figures seated back to back. I expect one of them faced inwards, worshipping the cetiya, while the other surveyed the landscape. I doubt if they were ever combinations of Ganega and Gavaripati (they might have been called so at a later period). They look to me more like the double-bodied Garuda of Raghurdmpur (SrT Vikramapura), S. of Dacca13. No images of Ganega have yet, I think, been found at gri Ksetra. A photograph by F. 0. Oertel (i892)14 shows a small relief, of unknown origin but probably from Lower Burma, which he found in the 8 Oldish, but post-Pagan inscriptions: see List 23 (A I, 420 S./I058 A.D.).

Dr. Ray (I932)15 also mentions two stone images of Ganega in the Rangoon Museum, one with six arms (dancing ?), the other with the usual four. The four-armed figure is "represented as if dancing on his two slim legs, but is really seated. The two upper hands hold what seems to be a cakra (discus) and noose, while the two lower hold the vilva fruit and the trunk." The other, "also with a bulging belly, is seated in pad- masana and has six hands, but the attributes can hardly be ascertained." At Pagan, small single images of Ganega are fairly common, and are found in relic-chambers to- gether with Buddhist images. They are made of stone, mica (? rock-crystal), bronze, baked clay and white plaster (Pls. 88, 89); one is also said to be in paint, in the Abeyadana16; but I doubt this. Usually the crowned god sits in padmasana, but sometimes the right knee is raised. The belly is sometimes, but not always bulging. Both tusks, if any, are shown. The God has usually four hands: the upper ones may hold the Hook, Cakra, Fruit, or Conch; the lower may support trunk or belly; sometimes the lower right hand holds a rosary, and hangs in earth-touching attitude. The fruit, according to Dr. Ray, may be the vilva (bael) or mitulinga (citron)'7. On the front of the pedestal the god's vahana, the Rat or the Mongoose, is usually shown. The best-preserved image (P1. 88 a, b, c), from a mound W. of So-min-gyi pagoda, has three creatures on the pedestal: a Tortoise on the left, a Fish on the right, and a Mongoose (? Crocodile) on the front. This is exceptional; as also the position of the hands in the Kyauksauk bronze (P1. 89 f, g), covering the eyes. THE FAT MONK (Pls. 90. 9I) A widespread and ancient type of image frequently found in old relic-chambers - at Sri Ksetra, Rangoon, Pegu, Mandalay, Pagan, etc. - presents a Fat Monk with bulging belly, always sitting crosslegged, usually in padmasana, either in dhydna mudrd, or with both hands supporting his belly. He often sits on a double lotus throne, sometimes on a bare pedestal, rarely with a back-slab behind him. His statuettes, always small (up to 9 inches in height), are made of stone, bronze, silver-gilt, bronze-gilt, plaster, terracotta, or unburnt clay, sometimes lacquered and gilded. In one instance, Duroiselle tells us but gives no illustration1, the Fat Monk takes the place of the Buddha, on a terra- cotta votive tablet found near Pagan Htilominlo. Elsewhere he is not shown as a Buddha, nor as a Bodhisattva. He has neither firnd nor usnTsa nor mukuta. His robes are sometimes barely visible. His head is round and smooth. Possibly his oldest image in Burma is a stone statuette, 41 inches high, once lacquered and gilded, found inside a miniature stone stupa covered by a laterite cone, in the relic-chamber of Kyaik D6-ap (Bo-ta-htaung) pagoda, Rangoon (PI. 90 a, b, c). Here he sits as a sexless nude, on a bare pedestal, with a hole bored at the back of his waist, perhaps for insertion of a relic. In the same stupa was a 15 Brahmanical Gods .... p. 67.

P1. 236 d shows a two handed, three-headed elephant seated in padmdsana on double lotus, with usnfsa. Is not this a symbol of the All-Wise Buddha? - The three-headed elephant re-appears in the centre panel of the great thrones of the colossal Buddhas in the E., S., and N. Shrines of Nanda temple. As for P1. 236 c, I take it to be a four-armed A gvamukhf, and, like P1. 234 g, to be illustrative of the Padakusalamanava Jataka, No. 432. 17 Brahm.

Two images of the Fat Monk are reported from grl Ksetra: one (PI. 90 d), a stone image from Shw6-nyaung-bin ridge, seated in padmasana, diydna mudra, on lotus throne; the other a stone image in two fragments from near the W. city-gate, Kin- munchon village19. Two images in silver-gilt and soft white stone, are now in the platform-museum of Pegu Shw6mawdaw pagoda (PI. 9i h). Here the monk, with robes plainly shown - right shoulder bare, flap over left shoulder, hems on the shins - sits with right leg on left. His hands support his belly on either side of the navel. His mat rests on a fine flowered bronze throne with jewelled pedestal - probably of later date. Duroiselle mentions "a bronze figure found in a ruined pagoda in Pakokku"20; and two stone figures from the relic-chambers of Pagan Shw6hsandaw and Sittana (Canicand) pagodas (P1. 9i b). The latter was one of the first to be noticed2l. Since then, many others have been reported from various parts of Pagan, and one from Mandalay (P1. 9i c, d). The latest in date is a Paga'n bronze dated i602 A.D.22 Who is this Fat Monk? - Duroiselle hesitated. The Kinmunchon specimen, in I925, he took to be the pot-bellied Jambhala or Kubera, Lord of the Yaksas, and so the god of wealth23. Ray agreed with him24. Jambhala certainly becomes prominent in Thntric Mahdydnist art25. But when, in I922, Major C. M. Enriquez produced very similar wooden images, pot-bellied, from Kengtung in the far east of Burma, where (as in Thailand) they are called 'Mahd Kachai', Duroiselle accepted the derivation from Kaccdyana, monk, scholar, and author of the first Pali grammar26, and even considered that the images "were imported [into Burma] from the Shan States or Laos"27. Since then, Dupont discovered a re- markable 'votive tablet' from Wat P'ra Patron in Dvdravati28 - apparently similar to the one Duroi- selle discovered near Pagan Htilominlo -where the Fat Monk, seated with both hands supporting his belly (or is he in dlydnamudrd ?), takes the place of the Buddha. Or does the 'Mahd Kachai' of Thailand, Laos and Kengtung, refer rather to the eminent disciple of the Buddha, Mahdkaccdna, famous for his golden complexion? - The rich youth of Soreyya, according to the Dhammapada-aftthakath (I, 324ff.), wished that his wife were like Mahdkaccdna: a prayer that seems improbable if he was really so obese. In Burma we hardly know how to identify the Fat Monk. So many ancient images of him have now been discovered in the plains of Burma, that the theory of importation from the east has ceased to be probable. Since Jambhala was not a monk, that origin is also difficult to maintain. Taw Sein Ko, and Duroiselle at one time, thought the Fat Monk to be of 9 A.S.B. 1925, p. i6. 20A.S.B. 1922, p. 33.

But the Fat Monk was not a Buddha either. In I930, when Duroiselle found, together with Ganes'a, "the pot-bellied and shaven- headed figure seated on a lotus", he seems to have come round to the view that he was Gavarhpati3". U Lu Pe Win tells us that U Mya (who has not yet, I think, stated this view in print) holds that "these figures probably represent Gavampati, the patron saint of the Talaings"31. Although I know no text which says that Gavarhpati was abnormally fat, I lean to U Mya's opinion: because Gavadipati was a monk; because Kyanzittha's inscriptions prove that he was reverenced, not only in Lower Burma, but also at Prome and Pagan; and because both these and the Taingchut inscription and the Aniruddha 'Copies' agree that his images were made, gilded and worshipped at Pagan in the iith and I2th cen- turies. If this view is right, we may add that they appear to have been worshipped continuously from the 7th century to the I7th. In the countries east of Burma the worship was transferred, it seems, to another monk, Kaccdyana. Magic, Learning and Wealth (as in Roger Bacon's England) are easily associated in the mediaeval mind; so possibly the ultimate connection with the Yaksa Jambhala, mutatis mutandis, may also stand. One final theory, attributed by Duroiselle to Burmese scholars32, is that the Fat Monk is the great Disciple of the Left (also a master of Magic), Moggalldna, uncomfortably swelled by the naughty Mdra entering his belly, as told in the Mdratajjansya Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya. Uncomfortable he certainly looks in our illustrations - not at all like a 'Laughing Buddha'. SURYA The Sun God, has not yet been traced in any Buddhist temple in Burma. Only two stone images of him have yet been identified: one, of North Indian type, at Shin-nge-det-taung hill, Mrohaung, in North Arakan33; the other (P1. I48 e), of South Indian type, at the E. end of the outer corridor of Nat-hlaung-gyaung, Pagan. Mrohaung became a capital only in the I5th century. Duroiselle dates the Arakan stone about the 8th; Dr Ray (p. 70) 7th or 8th, (p. 92) 6th-7th. It was discovered by the late U San Shwe Bu, Hon. Archaeo- logical Officer for Arakan. "The reverse face" says Duroiselle, "is filled with a writing in North Indian characters... much defaced... From the archaic nature of a few characters that still remain, it is quite probable that it is in Gupta characters of about the 8th century A.D." Ray adds that it is in Sanskrit: "the palaeography of the record dates it in the earlier half of the 8th century." Duroiselle describes the sculpture as follows: "It depicts on the obverse face Suirya riding in his chariot drawn by seven horses. The horse in the centre is facing outward, and is placed in a niche of horse-shoe shape. The figure of the chariot-driver34 is missing. The principal figure is much defaced, but enough remains to show that it has two hands both lifted up to the level of the shoulders, each of which is carrying a circular or round object. . . It has a high headdress, large ear-lobes and a necklace, 29 See J.B.R.S. Vol. I, Part II, fig. i and p. i. A.S.I. I929, pp. io0-iio. A.S.B. I939, p. 9. 30 A.S.I. I930, p. I58. 31 A.S.B.

The one on the right is carrying a bow, and that on the left, a staff or an arrow. These two small figures probably represent the two goddesses, Usha and Pratyusha." Coomaraswamy, in his note on the Sflrya panel in the Bodhgayd railing-pillar35, says: - "In Vedic mythology the Sun has sometimes one horse, sometimes seven; but in ancient Indian iconography always four. It is only later that the image-makers will allow him seven." - This is borne out by the evidence in his History of Indian and Indonesian Art. Thus the early Sunga carving at Bhdjd36, the Bodhgayd pillar c. IOO B.C.37, and the Mathurd Saptasamudri well-carving IOO A.D.38, all show only four horses. At Bhdjd and Bodhgayd Sfirya is attended by his women; at Bodhgayd they are shooting with their bows. Seven horses only appear on the ioth century inscribed Pdla relief of Amrita in the British Museum39, and on the iith century P51a relief from Chapra, Rdjshdhi40; they are shown only on the pedestal, with the winged charioteer Aruna in the centre, and Usd and Pratyfsd on the extreme right and left, "moving threateningly with bow and arrow". But these are only minute figures; the interest has clearly passed from the chariot to the god, who stands bolt upright, holding his pair of lotuses which flower symmetrically above his shoulders. On the lifesize Siirya statue at Kondrak4l (W3th century) the women are not seen. The Mrohaung sculpture is clearly intermediate between the Mathurd and Pdla types, and may be one of the first to show the full complement of horses. This historical digression may help, perhaps, to bridge the gulf between our two Sufryas. Pagan Nat-hlaung-gyaung is a temple of Visnu. Its outer wall has perished, leaving exposed the inner wall of the outer corridor. This has ten niches for ten stone sculptures - presumably Visnu's avatkras. Only six sculptures remain. The last in the series, on the right hand side of the entrance-steps, Duroiselle describes as follows: -42 "It is standing on a lotus flower from which two other smaller ones spring; the arms are placed close to the body bent upwards at the elbows, and each hand holds a lotus bud on a level with the shoulders; it wears a crown; the distended earlobes hang down and touch the shoul- der under the weight of the large ear-ornaments. It has bracelets, armlets and anklets; the lower garment is tucked up and reaches as far as the knees; lines showing the folds are visible. I have not yet identified it. The number of niches would lead one to suppose that this also represents one of Visnu's Avatdras; but it has none of the distinctive attributes of any of these". Dr. Ray comes timely to the rescue43: "It is not one of the avatdras of Visnu, but seems in all likelihood to be an image of Sfirya of the South Indian type. The position of the two hands as well as the lotus buds held in one line with the shoulders are significant; no less significant is the number of the hands, namely two, which is a distinctive feature of South Indian Sfirya images, and the strictly erect position of standing as well... Siirya in South India does not generally wear boots nor ride a horse-drawn chariot . . ." He stresses the very intimate relation of Visnu with the Vedic Silrya.

The idea that Visnu is the Sun appears to be still maintained in the worship of the Sun as Sifrya Ndrdyana." Dr. Kramrisch illustrates an 8th century statue of Sflrya in the museum at Alampur, South Dec- can44: -"The image stands straight as a pillar with both feet firmly planted on a semicircular lotus pedestal. The image wears no garment except a very short loincloth. The delicate ornaments on crown and body and the sacred thread span and accentuate the pure and firmly modelled shape. The raised hands of the image hold each a lotus above shoulder height." For reredos there is only the halo above, and a knee-high back-slab showing in low relief the six horses (the central one is to be imagined), and a minute Aruna and a wheel above them. The only Gandhdran Sflrya shown by Marshall - a very doubtful one, in Taraki sandstone, from Sirkap (Taxila Museum)45 - does not appear to have any horses at all. Nor (I think) does that of Pagan. But Old Burmese mentions several times a word, kyak tatuiy, for some form of interior decoration of temples and monasteries. I take this, provisionally, to be an Old Mon term, *kydk they, "Sun God"; and to refer, not to Sflrya, but to the circular patterns, usually enshrining Buddhas, which cover most of the temple-ceilings of Pagan. Has this some distant connection with the circular painting of the Sun God on the niche-vault above the I20 ft. Buddha at Bdmiydn, Afghanistan46? DEVAS If only secondary figures in Pagan iconography, Devas were far from unimportant. With the passage from Mahdydnism to the Theravdda, Devas must have re-taken the place of Bodhisattvas as the immediate helpers of men. In his Pali prayer in the Shwegugyi (II3I A.D.), the first temple in Early Burmese style, Cafisf I orders: "On a platform high exalt it, and adorn with cetiyas and images of spirits"47. Pls. 372 d, 373 a, b, show part of the south face of this temple: one can still count 30 or more Devas above the glazed crenelles of the platform. More can be seen on the west face. So if we may assume that they once lined the crest of all four sides of the platform, there must have been a hundred or more. BRAHMA In later Gandhdran art the dyad, Indra and Brahmd, tend to oust Vajrapdni as the regular atten- dants on the Buddha, from his birth onwards. But they bear no resemblance to the dyad common in Pag'an art. With us, Brahmd has always three (out of four) visible faces, and holds the umbrella over the Buddha on the right (the Buddha's left). In Gandhdra he has a single face, often with long hair, stands on the Buddha's right, and carries, if anything, the Brahman's water-gourd (kamandalU)48. The dyad will pass later into Bodhisattvas. 44The Art of India, P1. 74 and p. 205. 45 The Buddhist Art of Gandhara, fig. 27 and pp. 24-25. 46 B. Rowland, op. cit., P1. 57.

The first instance I know of the three (or four)- headed Brahmd in Indian art, is in the Visnu Anantagayin sculpture at the Dagavatdra temple at Deogarh, which Zimmer dates c. 6oo A.D., and Kramrisch c. 500 A.D.50. The subject - the Creation, or rather the Re-creation of the world by Visnu - was popular from the 6th century onwards in India, and from the 7th to the iith century in Burma. In the inter- vals of creation, Visinu sleeps on the Endless World-Serpent, the sole survivor (?esa) of the previous world. At Deogarh he sleeps with his head to the right51, but in Burma always to the left. From his navel issues the lotus which supports Brahmd above him. In Burma the lotus always branches to form thrones for the Hindu Trinity, Brahmd, Visnu and Siva. With us, Brahmd sits always to the left, Visnu in the centre, and Siva to the right. Four such stone sculptures are extant in Burma: one from Sri Ksetra, Kalagangon52; two from Thaton53; and one from Kawgun Cave54, some 30 miles above Maulmein, on the right bank of the Salween. There was also a fifth, in brick and plaster, in early Pagan, in the main image niche of the Vis .nu temple, Nat-hlaung-gyaung; but nothing of it remains except Siva above, one hand of Visnu, the lotus seat and halo of Brahmd, and the ten twisted tail-ends of the endless serpent, below on the right55. On the Sri Ksetra, and the broader That^n, reliefs, Brahmd has four arms. Elsewhere he has only two, the poses and attributes varying. He generally sits crosslegged in padma'sana; in the broad Thaton relief in ardhaparyaiAkdsana, right knee raised. His crown is usually (and correctly)56 the crown of braided hair (jatamukut a); but on the narrower Thaton relief the pointed kirmaa mukuta. By far the finest representations of Brahmd in Burma, eight altogether, are seen in the Nanpaya, which adjoins on the south the Manuha temple at Myinpagan, both being attributed to the captured Mon king, Makuta, c. i060-70 A.D. The four richly carved stone pillars supporting the centre of the interior (Pls. I27-I3I) form a sort of open shrine around the central pedestal, now empty. Once (I guess) it may have borne a lifesize standing bronze image of the Buddha. Each pillar has four sides, 4 For Brahma's role in creation, see H.

The pose of hands and the lotus forest are strikingly like those of the Brahmd-pair in the porch-paintings of Myinkaba Kubyauk- gyi (P1. 345 a, b). But there the gods sit in padmasana, their heads erect, their arms symmetrical. In the Nanpaya one knee is raised; the elbow rests on it; and the head, with its gorgeous tower of braided hair and double-lotus finial, gently leans that way. The flattened knee is always toward the centre, the outer knee raised, the supported elbow slightly higher than the other. The faces, too, are more mobile in their eternal calm. Taw Sein Ko, who was in charge in I904, when the temple suffered its first unsatisfactory repairs57, noted the Brahmd pillars, the absence of a Buddha, and the "Hindu deity" (Kydk ?r4) crowning all eleven of the exterior windows; and influenced, perhaps, by the fact that Nan in modern Burmese means 'palace'58, appears to have accepted the view that the building was just "the palace of the Talaingking", and not a Buddhist temple at all. "The local Buddhists" says U Mya, "who would not allow the wearing of shoes inside a Buddhist temple, have no such scruples about this temple, as they con- sider it to be either an old palace, or a Hindu temple. It is not in present use as a religious monument, and when taken over by Government for thorough repairs, was in an utterly ruined condition." In his "Note on the Nanpaya Temple and Images of Brahma carved on the pillars inside it,"59 U Mya had little difficulty in proving, from internal evidence6, that it is a temple, and a Buddhist temple; that the Brahmds here closely parallel the Brahmds in the Kubyauk-gyi6l - unquestionably a Buddhist temple; and that the "Hindu deity" above the windows is just the Kydk 9rT of dozens of Pagan temples, and of Kyanzittha's palace and coronation pavilion. But I question strongly U Mya's provisional dating of the temple as late as the "I2th-I3th century." No stone temples were built at Pagan, so far as we know, after the reign of Kyanzittha. I see no reason to question the traditional date: indeed I regard the Nanpaya as the first extant masterpiece of 'Mon' temple-architecture at Pagan. The Mye'bontha Payahla (Pls. 248-25I), another beautiful Mon temple (early I2th century ?), tottering to ruin a furlong N.E. of the Shw6hsandaw, is now being cleaned up, and if possible repaired, by the Archaeological Department. On the four sides of the central block there are recesses with colossal brick and stucco carvings of the Four Scenes, mounted on enormous thrones. Inset in the thrones are long rows of solemn stone Brahmas, each with his pyramid of braided hair, seated cross- legged on lotus mat in padmadsana, hands in namaskara mudra, with foliations all around him. Of single stone-relief images of Brahmd, there are three more to mention (P1. 4i6 a, b, c). Two are shown and described by Dr. Ray62. The third, now in the Indian Museum at Calcutta, is similar. All have elaborate braided pyramids of hair, with double lotus finial. All sit in padmasana, on a bare pedestal against a bare backslab. All have their two hands raised together in namaskdra mudra.

Dr. Ray is a learned and sensitive scholar of Indian art, and I hesitate to disagree with him: but if, as U Mya tells me, the Rangoon and Calcutta sculptures came from Thaton, like most of the other Brahmanic images once housed in the Phayre Museum, it is not easy to date them later than the iith century, for one hears nothing of Thaton during the Pagan period after the reign of Kyanzittha. It may have been a dead city. Finally, at Paga'n Museum there is a damaged stone head of Brahmd, with single jatdmitkuta and no backslab (P1. 4i6 d). OLD COINS. .IVA giva is a deity little known in Central Burma; but his worship was ancient in pre-Burmese North Arakan, especially under the Candra dynasty of Vesdli (8 miles N. of Mrohaung), during the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. The earliest coins of Arakan63 show the Conch-shell on the obverse - the symbol of Visnu. But from the 4th king of the Candra dynasty, Devacandra (first half of the 5th century), down to Dharmacandra in the next dynasty (near the end of the 7th century), the coins substitute for the Conch of Visnu the Bull of Siva, Nandin, together with the name of the reigning king engraved above it. The further change, to Mahdydnist Buddhism, began under Vajrasakti towards the middle of the 7th century, and was confirmed by his grandson, Tnandacandra (early 8th century), author of the inscription on the W. face of the Shitthaung pillar now at Mrohaung64. But Vajrasakti's son, Dhar- macandra, father of Anandacandra, remained "in the lineage of Tsha," i.e. Siva; and he was the last king to have his name on coins showing the Bull. When proper excavation starts at Vesdii (and there is no ancient site in Burma so promising as this), no doubt gaivite images will be found. For the moment, the only one reported is a broken statue resting on a pillar, and showing a double lotus throne with Dfirgd, consort of giva, visible from the waist downwards, standing with right foot and trident proudly planted on the mahisasura, Buffalo Demon, whom she has slain65. Ray dates this sculpture c. 6th-7th century. At Ari Ksetra signs of 8aivism are scarcely to be found. The first excavators, General de Beyli6 and Taw Sein Ko, thought they found them: - (a) near Yahanda Gu - "the end of a stone trident from a bas-relief, and the four arms of a statue of 8iva near a fragment of a statue of the Buddha."66 (b) In I927 Duroiselle reported the finding at Kalagangon of "a linga I4 in. in height; an indisputable proof of the existence of Shivaism at Prome, side by side with Vishnuism and Buddhism."67 But later, by I937, he had changed his mind. After mentioning the "probably Pyu legend" of most Burmese Chronicles, that Candi and Parame~vara, i.e. Dfirgd and 8iva, assisted at the founding of the old city68, 63See E. H.

He mentions the stone trident, clay seal with liiiga, etc.; also "some very old coins of a type pretty well distributed in Central and Upper Burma, which were at one time thought to bear Saivite symbols; but they have not yet been explained satisfactorily and expert numismatists appear doubtful on this point." - Note that Nandin, the Bull of Siva, which appears so often on the Candra coins of Arakan, is absent trom the otherwise similar Pyu coins of Sri Ksetra and Halin. Elsewhere too in Burma, evidence of Saivism is more or less doubtful. Near the palace-site of Old Pegu, E. of Hintha ridge, the late Dr. J. A. Stewart dug up two stones which he took to be yoni; but he found no liitga70. At the Khemathiwun monastery near Kyaik Khauk pagoda, S. of Syriam, a small laterite yoni (?) may also be seen, with spout and groove, and an incised circle in the solid centre. The old carved terracotta tablets set in the row of pockets along the terrace of Thagya Paya (not Shwezayan pagoda), Thaton, which Dr. Ray7' and others (including myself) once thought to be Saivite, have since been proved by U Mya to be illustrations of the ten great AIahinipdta Jdtakas72. As a subsidiary figure, like Brahmnd, Siva undoubtedly appears on the Visnu Anantagayana reliefs (suara, notes 52-54), at Sri Ksetra, Thaton, Kawgun and early Paga'n Nat-hlaung-gyaung (PI. I47 d). He sits on the right side of the Triad, on the proper left of Visnu in the centre, above the feet of the sleeping god. On the two Thaton sculptures he has two arms, elsewhere four. On the Kawgun slab his lower hands are in namaskdra mudrd. The attributes may include trident (trisfila) and mallet (mudgara) in one or other of the upper hands; but all the images are different, and one cannot always be certain. The god sits either in ardhaparyanka'sana (right knee raised), or in padmdsana (crosslegged, both soles showing). He wears the pointed kirfta mukuta, except in the Nat-hlaung-gyaung group, where he has the jatldmukuta. Three (or more) Brahmanic sculptures were found at Thaton, and taken thence to the Phayre Museum, Rangoon; and when that was broken up, to Rangoon University Library. Here they were badly damaged, in April I945, when the Japanese dynamited the building on their way out. Two are the Visnu Anantagayin reliefs already mentioned. The third stone - a tapered rectangle arching to a peak - was once the grandest stone relief in Burma73. The chief deity shown on it used to be identified as Visnu74, but Dr. Ray is assuredly right in calling him Siva. Beside the lotus pedestal the God's vdshana, the Bull Nandin, crouches under his right foot, facing the Buffalo-demon (mahisusura) under his left knee; these are scarcely visible on the plates shown by Oertel and Temple, but are (or were) quite clear on the stone.

Four massive arms branch out like limbs of a swastika. The upper left hand holds the mallet, the upper right probably the trident, the lower right the rosary, the lower left the citrus fruit. The snake-garland falls over his left shoulder. Against his left thigh sits Pdrvatf, holding a yaktail flywhisk, her chin pressed between his two arms. The whole design - the weighting of the left bottom corner, the tense diagonal of the head, the zigzag energy of upper arms and knee, the fluid fall of snake-thread, lower arms and thighs - is masterly. Dr. Ray (p. 79) dates these sculptures gth-ioth century, Orissan style. At Pagan a badly damaged image of Siva (P1. 4I8 a) was exposed by flood on the riverbank, close to a tank W. of Shw6-6nhmin monastery, Myinpagan. "It is seated" says Duroiselle75 "in theaskhdsana on a stylized lotus placed on the pedestal. The right leg is pendent, the foot resting on a small figure lying on its side, which seems to be Apasmdra. This enables us to identify the image as that of a form of Siva. It has four hands... The stone measures 2 ft. 4 in. x i ft. 6 in. with a thickness about 91 in." Dr. Ray thinks the upper right hand holds the trident, and the lower left the rosary; and confirms that "the male figure that lies prostrate under his right foot is the apasmara purusa known only in South India as associated with Siva76". The apasmcra purusa ("epileptic") was the symbol of Dirt (mala). The scene is shown, says Coomaraswamy77, as early as pre-Kusdna times (ist century B.C.) on the Gudimallam Sivalifigam (North Arcot). In later times Siva Nataraja is commonly shown dancing on it. The standing four-armed statue of Siva (P1. I48 d), now at the N. door of Paga'n Museum, was found by Crawfurd in i82678, and by Phayre in I85379, lying on the floor of Nat-hlaung-gyaung. The attri- butes were clear; trident and mallet in the upper right and left hands, sword and mace in the lower ones. The crown is braided hair (jaktcmukuta). Phayre noted as follows: - "The standing figure is about 4 ft. high.80... The image is much disfigured, but its Indian anklets are visible, and beneath the feet is an animal half broken away, but which probably represents a bull. The image, no doubt, is that of Siva." Dr. Ray comments81: "It is carved out of grey soft sandstone in bold and round relief. Its form and execution is distinctly South Indian, and may on stylistic grounds be dated not earlier than the I2th century A.D.... about a century later than the Nat-hlaung-gyaung images, and of lesser artistic merit." Duroiselle adds82: - "All the other figures in this temple are Vishnuite, and it is prob- able that this Siva was brought [to this Visrnu temple] from some other temple." - Note, however, that Phayre found it lying near "two empty places for upright images right and left of the throne", and regarded it as having been "displaced" from one of them. Col. Ba Shin agrees with Phayre. Duroiselle did not observe that there is another figure of Siva, seated in the recess just above. 75Duroiselle, A.S.I. 1929, p. I12. Arch.

Johnston's chronologically arranged plate, "Coins of the Candra Dynasty"83, the first four coins of North Arakan bear the sahkha or Conch-symbol of Visnu on the obverse. There- after all bear the Bull of Siva. The change comes in the reign of Devacandra who uses both symbols, in the first half of the 5th century A.D. Coin No. 3 is similar, but bears no royal name. Coins i and 2, both obverse and reverse beautifully engraved and clear, bear no name, but appear to be the numis- matic starting point. There are small differences between them; but the Conch on the obverse, and the vardhamana (?) and ankusa on the reverse, set the model. Possibly these two go back to pre-Candra times. Visnu's Conch figures also on a few of the oldest coins of Sri Ksetra84; but here Siva's Nandin never appears. At Sri Ksetra, two of the oldest statues of Visnu show him standing on the shoulders of his winged vdhana, Garuda. He has four arms: the upper pair of hands hold perhaps the Discus (cakra) and the Conch (saihkha). The lower right hand holds a fruit (? dmalaka, Emblic Myrobalan) in front of the body; the lower left rests on, or holds, the Club (gadd). This will remain the norm for Visnu images in Burma. The two sculptures are quite different in style. The one found by General de Beyli6 in the garden of Prome Deputy Commissioner85, is a thin rectangular slab of soft sandstone, carved in bold relief. It presents Visnu and his consort LaksmT (or Srf) standing side by side, she on a double lotus. What remains of the slim, soft and supple figures is wonderfully clean and fresh; but the stone is broken at top and bottom, and both heads are missing. Visnu on the left wears a short natural loin- cloth and twisted waistband, anklets and many bracelets. Sri has only two hands: her raised right hand may hold (as Ray suggests) a bunch of lotus stems, her left hangs by her side with long, straining, sinuous fingers. Garuda, though defaced, is embellished with scales below the waist, and tail-feathers and wings outspread. The general effect is graceful and Indian, South Indian Pallava in style, according to Dr. Ray, but quite unorthodox: he knows of no other image "where Visnu and Laksmi stand side by side." And Visnu standing on Garuda is "up till now found in Burma alone." He dates the image c. 8th century A.D. It is not the only image of this type found at Sri Ksetra86. The other stone-relief, from Kalagangon87, is much less elegant: a tall triangle rimmed with lotus leaf, showing a large-headed four-armed Visnu standing on a leafy-winged Garuda. His tasselled loin- cloth, ribbed with beads and volutes, is quite unlike the softly folded dhoti of the previous sculpture. The whole is austere, heavy with ornament, but realistically Pyu.

The subject, as we have seen, was popular in India from at least the 6th century A.D. In the sculpture at the Dagavatdra temple, Deogarh89 (N.E. of Safcl), Visnu's head is to the right, and his legs do not cross. In the Bhitdrgaon terracotta relief90, and the 7th century sculpture in Mahisamandapa, Mdmallapuram9l (S. of Madras), the head is to the left (as always in Burma), but the legs do not cross. In the 8th century ceiling-panel from the hall of Haccappya Gudi (Temple No. 9) at Aiholi (S.W. Deccan)92, Visnu's pose comes nearest to that in Burma: head to the left, legs crossing at the shin. Dr. Kramrisch, in her note on the Deogarh sculpture, points out that above the sleeping god are shown, in the centre, Brahmd on the lotus; on his right Kdrttikaya on the Peacock and Indra on the White Elephant; and on his left Siva and Parvati on their Bull, and the Marut storm-gods. Visnu's hands are empty. "The lower part of the panel... shows the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, which were to be slain by Visnu. The four remaining figures are personifications of the potency of Visnu's four hands." In her note on the Aiholi panel, which also shows the god sleep- ing with hands empty, she says: "The attributes of the power of the god, the Wheel, Club, etc., are carved next to the recumbent image. They are not personified." In all four of the Burma renderings of the scene the legs are crossed. In at least three (the two from Thaton and the one at Kawgun Cave), the god holds his attributes even in sleep. In the Sri Ksetra rendering there may be only two arms, and both are damaged. From the navel of the sleeping god (not always visible, but implied) proceeds the lotus stem which branches to form thrones for the Triad seated above - Brahmd (left), Visnu (always prominent in the centre), and Siva (right). The small square Sri Ksetra relief93, like the standing Visnu from the same site, is rimmed with lotus. It is in two tiers: the sleeping god less prominent below, the Triad in high relief above. At its base, under the lotus mat on which the god lies, is seen on the left the spouting head of Makara. The Ananta serpent, Sesa, is hardly, if at all, visible. The faces are all grave, but realistic within their rigid formulas. If the sleeping god has only two arms, the seated Visnu above him has the normal four, and sits, like Siva, in pose of royal ease. The stele relief from Thaton94 is a tall rectangle in three tiers: the three stele' at the top; the seated Triad in the centre; the sleeping god below. This arrangement gives prominence to the Triad in the centre. The three stele are just the reredos (Visnu's the highest) of the gods below them, all seated in padmasana on beautifully fluid lotus cushions. Visnu in the centre has his lower hands as if in dhar- macakra mudrd, but perhaps only holding his fruit between them. There is no sign of the Ananta serpent below. There is much more beauty of design and modelling here than in the Pyu relief. The larger Thaton relief95, though worn, is also the work of a master. Square in shape, but flat- arching at the top, it reverts to the two-tiered Sri Ksetra pattern. But here the sleeping god is given more prominence and two-thirds of the surface. The five hoods or heads of the Serpent ring his peace- 88 Arch. Neg. 2067 (IgIg-20). A.S.B. I920, PI. I, fig. 3, and pp. 22-23. Ray, Brahm. Gods . ., P1. IV 4, and pp. 28-30, 89. Height I5j in.

The Kawgun stone relief96 is a tall arched rectangle in three tiers, like the stdle relief of Thaton; but the stdel tier is missing, and the sleeping god raised to first importance in the main middle tier. Here the Serpent rings him with seven heads, all crowned, and at his feet Laksm! stands on guard. The bot- tom tier consists of three niches: a kneeling worshipper at each side, two seated ones in the centre; but these are hard to distinguish. Are they, as at Deogarh, personifications of his attributes? In the top left corner, too, there appears to be a figure riding a horse (?), approaching the three seated gods. One would expect a balancing figure in the top right. Are these the Maruts? VISNU IMAGES AT PAGAN At Pagan, a standing bronze image of Visnu (P1. 448), was found by a monk "in a field at Myinkaba ... about i ft. in height, and of good workmanship"97. The god, four-armed, stands erect on double lotus. His raised right and left hands hold (or held) respectively the Discus (cakra) and the Conch (s'ahkka). The lower right hand is held out before the body in abhaya muldrd; the lower left palm rests on the top of the Mace (gads). Dr. Ray98 notes its stiff rigid modelling, hard facial expression, simple and crude workmanship; its flame-epaulettes, its distended earlobes (characteristic of Buddha images); and suggests that it was cast locally, "not earlier than the later half of the I3th century A.D." This seems difficult to reconcile with his mention of "an exactly similar bronze image from the Madras Museum, illustrated in Gopinath Rao's Hindu Iconography" (Vol. I, Part I, P1. XVIII). There is also at Pagan Museum a small sandstone image (8 in. high) of the four-armed Visnu (PI. 4i7 a), seated in padmasana on lotus. No one knows where it came from. The god wears a pointed crown. His upper right hand holds the Wheel, his upper left possibly the Club. The two hands before the body may hold a fruit and the Conch. Finally, a weathered stone fragment recently found in Shw6gu-gyi (P1. 4i7 b) shows the crowned head and torso of a four-armed god, similar to several old images of Visnu found at gri Ksetra. VISNU TEMPLES AT PAGAN Visnu is the only Hindu god to have had temples built and dedicated to him at Pagan. There was probably once a Visnu temple at Myinpagan.

Ours is in abhaya mudra (not varada, as Dr. Ray says). 99 In Nov. 1902, the Hon. A. T. Arundel of the Indian Public Works Department inspected the newly formed Archaeological Office at Pagan, and "on seeing a Tamil inscription found at Myinpagin, he suggested the despatch of a rubbing of it, for decipherment, to the Government Epigraphist at Madras". Dr. Hultzsch sent a translation and notes (later edited in Epig. Ind., Vol. VII, No. 27, pp. I97-8), from which I extract the following: ". . . 'Inthe temple of Ndnddesi Vinnagar Alvdr at Pukkam alias Ayivattanapuram, I, Irdyiran Siriydn alias Sri Kulasekhara nambi of Magodayarpattanam in Mali Mandalam, made a maxlapa, gave a door, and one fixed lamp to burn constant- ly in this mandapa . . .' Note. The inscription consists of one verse in the Sanskrit language and Grantha alphabet, and a prose passage in the Tamil language and alphabet. The Tamil characters are those of the 13th century A.D.... The Tamil passage records gifts by a native of Magodayarpattanam in Malai mandalam, i.e. Cranganore, in Malabar. His name, Sri Kulasekhara nambi, stamps him as a devotee of the Vaishnava Saint Kulasekhara, from whose Mukundamdld the opening verse is derived. The recipient of the gift was the temple of Nanddesi-Vinnagar at Pukkam .... i.e. the Vishnu temple of those coming from various countries.. ." (A.S.B. I903, p. 7).</page><page sequence="237">Chapter XI 2I9 thought to be of the I3th century, records gifts by a Vaisnava devotee. Sri KulasEkharanambi, a native of Cranganore in Malabar, to a Visnu temple at Pagan, presumably near the site of the inscrip- tion. The stone, which is now Stone 95 at Pagan Museum, was found at Myinpagan; but the exact spot is not on record. It is possible that ex-king Makuta and his followers built such a temple for their own use at Myinpag n. Note, too, the bronze statuette of Visnu (P1. 448) found "in a field at Myinkaba". NAT-HLAUNG-GYAUNG The other Visnu temple, still extant, is within the walls of Pagan. It is called Nat-hlaung-gyaung, "Residence confining Devas" (Pls. I43-I49). It stands between the Thatbyinnyu and the Pnhto- thamya, a few minutes' walk from the old palace. No more honourable site could have been chosen. We have seen'00 how prominent were Vaisnava Brahmans and the worship of Nay (Ndrdyana) at the building of Kyanzittha's palace. Kyanzittha himself often claims to be an Avatar of Visnu. And such a name as Narasifgha-Uccand'01, borne by one of the later kings of Pagan, suggests that Kyanzittha was not the only Pagan king who worshipped Visnu. The main shrine of Nat-hlaung-gyaung is the large fathom-deep recess with striped archway in the E. face of the central block (P1. I46 a). It is of bare brick, broken by treasure-hunters up to a height of about 6j ft. from the cement floor. Above this, there is faintly painted plaster with lotus stalks in relief, branching outwards and supporting two double lotus thrones. The one on the left is empty except for the mark of a halo. The one on the right (P1. I47 d) holds a four-armed god with crown of braided hair, seated in padma'sana, a mallet in his upper left hand and a knife (or mace ?) in the lower. In the centre there was probably another four-armed deity, now lost except for a lifted left arm, holding a conch. - Col. Ba Shin, who first correlated these details with the ten intertwisted snake- tails (P1. I47 e) below, on the right side of the recess, is certainly right in concluding that the main image in the temple was yet another Visnu Anantasayin, in the act of creation (or rather re-creation) of the universe; that the main image of the god, sleeping on the Ananta serpent with his head to the left, is now lost owing to treasure-hunters; and that little remains except the Siva above on the right, the top left hand of Visnu seated in the centre, and the lotus throne and halo of Brahma on the left. These are made of brick and stucco. On each side of the recess, facing front, there is a narrow round-arched shallow niche, 7 ft. high from the pedestal, and about 2 ft. broad. The standing stone image of Siva (P1. I48 d), now at Pagan Museum, which Crawfurd in i826 and Phayre in i855102 found lying on the floor of the temple, may have come from one of these niches - perhaps the one on the right, thinks Col. Ba Shin, which shows signs of damage. Above these tall niches there are strong recessed and swelling capitals, on which rest two round- topped niches, with the nine inward-curving spines of the arch-pediment (clec) between them. This kind of pediment, the Colonel notes, is archaic, typical of Sri Ksetra'03 rather than Pagan, where the spines of the Mon clec are nearly always vertical. These upper niches are 48 to 50 inches high; 2o to 100 supra, Ch. IV, pp. 68-71. 101 I.B., P1. II 1382, 2001. Narasifigha-Uccand was probably the elder brother of Klacwd. He appears to have reigned for a few years before 597 S./1235 A.D., when Klacwa succeeded him. 102 See notes 78, 79 supra. 103 e.g. above the megalithic Bodhisattvas of Kanbyin Gate and Nat-yaukkya-g6n, gr! Ksetra (Arch. Negs. 776, 2886).</page><page sequence="238">220 Chapter XI 22 inches broad; the one on the left i foot deep; the one on the right (where the image is missing) 2 feet. Misjudgement of their size led Duroiselle into several errors'04. Phayre in I855 suggested that the stone statue of Visnu seated on Garuda (P1. I47 a), which he also found lying on the floor, and which has now been taken to Berlin'05, came from the upper niche on the right. Duroiselle comments :106 - "This seated Visnu, 4 ft. high, which Yule" [read Phayre]" describes as coming from the niche above the capital on the left" [read right], "is really the central figure below; it could not have fitted in the smaller niche; moreover the counterpart of the figure now missing in this niche, is still in situ in the niche over the capital on the right" [read left] "hand, and is only two feet high; the one on the left" [read right] "was of the same size." Duroiselle gives photographs, both of the stone Visnu seated on Garuda, "4 ft. high," now in Berlin (his PI. LXXX c); and also the brick and plaster Visnu seated on Garuda, still in situ in the left upper niche, "only two feet high" (his P1. LXXIX f). -This last measurement is certainly too small. The niche is 4 ft. high; and our prints (PI. I47 b, c) prove that the height of the image (including the Garuda) is not much less than that of the niche. "The dress" of this image, Duroiselle adds'07, "is very simple and resembles that of a Buddhist monk, while the headdress is similar to that of Buddha figures. This interesting image is the Buddha Avatdra." - Here again he was misled, either by his photograph, or by looking at the image from below. His photograph, taken with a tilted camera, shows a sort of conical usn-sa on the god's head. But ours (PI. I47 c), taken from the same level as the image, shows nothing of the kind, but only a rather worn jaetdmukuta on a figure dressed in royal attire, with hands in a pose quite un-Buddhistic. We have not checked GrUnwedel's measurement of the Berlin image: but assuming it to be correct (as we have no reason to doubt), and comparing its shape with that of the niche, we think it quite possible that it fitted the niche exactly. In any case it cannot have been the central image in the recess; for that, we are confident, was a Visnu Anantagdyin. On the three other sides of the inner corridor, set in shallow niches, are three brick images of the standing four-armed god (P1. I48 a, b, c). They were once, I expect, the most beautiful brick images in Pagan; but are now, alas, so damaged that we can only guess the beauty of the whole from the delicacy of a few parts. The image on the S. face (PI. I48 a) seems to hold at least three of the usual attributes: cakra, sankha and gadd. All these walls were once covered up to the roof with painting, now difficult to read below the whitewash. Here is U Mya's description'08:- "All the paintings represent seated figures of Visnu with his devotees. In some the attributes may be distinguished; and they are the cakra, conch, lotus (?), club or sword. Some of the Visnu images have four hands, others two, and the distinguishing marks are discernible only in the case of images with four hands. The devotees are, in almost every case, ascetics wearing beards and moustaches, with the hair on the head done up into two knots, one on each side above the ear. Each ascetic is seated with the legs folded on one side, and the hands raised in the namaskdramudrc towards the fire before him in a salver." 104 Duroiselle, "The Nat-hlaung-kyaung, PagAn", A.S.I.

It contains ten niches rounded at the top: four on the E. side (two on each side of the steps up to the inner corridor), and two each on the S., W., and N. sides near the corners. Their chief purpose was to house stone reliefs showing the Avatdras ('Descents' or Incarnations) of Visnu, Preserver of the Universe. The series starts from the centre of the E. face, the worshipper keeping his right side to the temple as he makes the circuit. "Ten" says N. K. Bhattasali'09, "is the most commonly accepted number of the incarnations; but the list was smaller originally. In some enumerations only six incarnations are mentioned, while seven is the number fixed upon in other passages. The list was sometimes extended to 22 or 23, including many famous sages, as well as Rsabha, the first Tirthafikara of the Jainas, and Buddha the founder of Buddhism." According to the southern recension of the Mahabhhrata, "the Ten Incarnations are the Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the Man-Lion, the Dwarf, (Paragu) Rnma, (Ddgarathi) Rdma, (Bala) Rdma, Buddha and Kalki." There are at present only seven stone sculptures in these ten niches. If we number the niches i to IO, and the Avatdras in the order given above also as I to IO, we find (allowing for gaps) a fair degree of correspondence at the beginning, but some apparent divergencies later: - I. THE FISH (matsya). - Man", the first man, washing his hands, spares the life of a tiny fish he finds between his fingers. The Fish, in turn, now grown gigantic, saves Manu from the great Flood. - Sculpture missing. II. THE TORTOISE (kiarma). - Visnu descends in the form of a Tortoise to support Mt. Mandara, which the Asuras, in their search for ambrosia, were using as a churning rod to churn the ocean. - Sculpture missing. III. THE BOAR (vardha). - Visnu descends in the form of a Boar to rescue the young Earth (Prthivf) which had disappeared under the sea, and establish it above sea-level. - The sculpture is on the S. face, near the S.E. corner. The Boar is seen with Prthivi on his left shoulder.'10 (P1. I49 a). IV. THE MAN-LION (narasiigha). -The atheist demon Hirai.yakagipu ("Gold Cushion") ill-treats his son Prahldda for praising Visnu. "Where is he?" he asks. "Everywhere" replies his son, "even in this palace-pillar". Furious, the demon kicks the pillar. The Man-Lion emerges and tears him to pieces. (Brahmd had granted the demon the boon that he could not be slain by man nor animal). - The sculpture is on the S. face, near the S.W. corner (P1. I49 b). V. THE DWARF (vdmana). - The demon Bali, "priding himself on his empire over the three worlds, was humiliated byVisnu, who appeared before him in the form of a dwarf holding a kamandalu, and obtained from him the promise of as much land as he could pace in three steps: whereupon the dwarf expanding himself deprived him of heaven and earth in two steps, but left him the sovereignty of the lower regions""'. - The Vdmana sculpture is shown on the W. face, near the S. W. corner"2 (P1. I49 c). The sequel, the Trivikrama or Three Steps, is not shown. VI. BALARAMA HALAYUDHA, the Plough-weaponed. Elder brother of Krsna. Also called Haladhara, 'plough-holder', "carrying a peculiar weapon shaped like a plough-share""3. - The sculpture is on the W. face, near the N.W. corner (P1. I49 d). 109 N. K. Bhattasali, . . .

Kalki has not yet appeared, but will appear "mounted on a white horse and wielding a drawn sword as destroyer of the wicked"116. - This is not shown; but instead, as Dr. Ray has rightly argued, there is in this final niche a sculpture of Sfirya, the Sun God117 (PI. I48 e). Note N. K. Bhattasali's remark:118 - "Images of the Sun-god are the most numerous ones found in Eastern Bengal, next only to those of Visnu." And he adds that "the Varmans and the Senas, who followed the [Buddhist] PdIas, specifically call themselves Saura, i.e. worshippers of the Sun-God." The only unusual element in the arrangement proposed above, is the order of the three Ramas, Paragu Rama normally coming before, and Bala Rama after, RMmacandra. But a reader of N. K. Bhattasali's interesting account of these incarnations19, and in particular his analytic chart (on p. 96), will see that after No. 5, Vamana, the order of the three RMmas at any rate, is variable. Per- haps, too, it is not surprising that niche No. 9, Buddhdvatdra, near the N. corner of the E. face, was left empty. Was this avatdra even known in Burma at the time ?120 ABtYADANA TONDOES (Pls. 2i6 b, 2I9-223) Even the Vedic gods find entry, under the wing of Saivite Tantrism, into this Buddhist temple. The outer wall of the Abeyadana Corridor is Mahayanist. The upper paintings on the inner wall are generally Buddhist. But above the high plinth at the base of the inner wall, in the forks where the tall niche-pediments meet, there is a series of i8 Tondo-paintings, on the W., E., and S. walls, showing these ancient gods coming to pay their respects to the Abeyadana Buddhas. On the S. (or back) wall there are two tondoes near each corner, converging on the broad Buddha-niche in the centre. The W. and E. walls hold seven tondoes each; here the direction is from S. to N., i.e. towards the sole entrance to the Shrine. There are no tondoes on the N. wall. At each corner of this central block there is a vertical pilaster; so those nearest the corners are only half, or rather two-thirds, tondoes. Each full tondo is about I3j in. in diameter (the subject proper), plus 31 in. (the breadth of the border). 114 Monier-Williams, op. cit., p. 877. 115 Monier-Williams, op. cit., p. 589. 116 Monier-Williams, op. cit., p. 262. 117 supra, p. 209.

Dacca Museum, pp. 148, i66. 119 ibid., pp. 89-iO7. 120 Quite apart from the likelihood of causing offence to some Pagan Buddhists, there is the question of date. Note T. Bloch's remark in "Notes on Bodh Gaya" (A.S.I. 1909, p. 151): - "So far as I am aware, the earliest reference in literature to the ninth or Buddha Avatdra of Visnu, is found in Kshemendra's Dagcavatdra-charita, a work of the 12th century A.D." - The Nat-hlaung-gyaung may date from about iooo A.D.</page><page sequence="241">Chapter XI 223 VEDIC GODS AND DIKPALAS All show Vedic or post-Vedic gods and goddesses, each riding his vdhana with or without attendants, coming with offerings to worship. In the absence of written glosses, it is none too easy to identify these deities. On the W. side (Nos. I to 7, from N.W. to S.W.), U Mya has recognized the three leaders of the procession12: - No. I Brahmd, riding his Hansa or Wild Goose; No. 2 piva, riding his Bull, Nandin; No. 3 Visau, riding Garuda, who bears his stolen pot of ambrosia. Note that here giva takes the central place, always occupied by Visnu in Burma Anantagayin sculptures. On the E. side (Nos. 8 to I4, from N.E. to S.E.), Dr. Ray has identified one of the middle tondoes, No. I2, as the river- goddess Yamund (Jumma), riding her Tortoise122. Other identifications are more or less probable: I propose them tentatively. If No. i2 is Yamund, as seems certain, one expects Nos. I3 and I4 to be the other ancient river-goddesses - SarasvatT on Ha~sa, and Gangd on Makara. Makara is a curious zebra-like animal with gaping mouth; and it occurs again, I think, on the S. wall, S.W. corner, No. 17, where it may be Varwna's vahana. One or two identifications seem fairly obvious. No. 4 on the W. wall is likely to be DevT, giva's consort, on Siiha, the Lion. No. 9 on the E. wall can hardly fail to be Indra on his White Elephant, Airavata. "Indra" says Prof. J. N. Banerjea123, "was originally the most prominent of all the Vedic gods, and now... he had to be satisfied with the much more modest position of the guardian of the eastern quarter". It seems clear to me that several of these gods are Dikpalas124, Guardians of the Quarters; but Indian texts, as Dr. Banerjea shows, are not always at one in their assignments. If No. 9, Indra, represents the East, No. 8 at the N.E. corner may well be Thana (a form of Siva) on his Bull, correctly representing the North-East. Perhaps also No. IO may be Agni on his Goat, representing the South- East. Yama is Guardian of the South, and rides the Buffalo, holding the Trident in his left hand: this, then, should be No. i6 on the S. wall, second from the S.E. corner. Varuna is Guardian of the West; but if I have rightly identified him on his Makara (No. I7), I must admit that he is here placed on the S. wall, though in the S.W. corner. Nirrti (lord of the South-West), Vdyu (lord of the North-West), and Kubera (lord of the North) I fail to find; but there are no tondoes on the N. wall. Left to identify are: - No. 5 W. Wall - a six-armed goddess riding an Elephant. No. 6 W. Wall - a two-armed king riding a Monkey. No. 7 W. Wall - a four-armed king riding a Horse. No. ii E. Wall - a two-armed king riding a Buffalo. No. I5 S. Wall - a four-armed king riding a Kinnara. No. i8 S. Wall - a four-armed king riding an Eagle (?), with Cormorant in front. Sex is sometimes difficult to distinguish in these tondoes. But No. 6, the two-armed rider on the Monkey, is certainly a bearded king. Vasanta, the Hindu god of Spring, rides a Monkey, but he has normally four arms'25. Could No. 6 be Ddsarathi Rama riding his faithful ape, Hanuman 26? 121 U Mya, A.S.I. I930-34, Part I, p. i83, and Part II, PI.

Ic., pp. 420-421.</page><page sequence="242">224 Chapter XI REVANTA No. 7 in spite of his four arms (I think he normally has two), may well be Revanta, son of Surenu and the Sun-god Sfirya, the lord of horses, cavalry and hunting. One image of Revanta has been discovered in the moat at Badkdmtd, the old capital of Patikkard in East Bengal. N. K. Bhattasali describes at length the worship of Revanta 27, as the climax of "the rite of Nfrajand, the performance of which was incumbent on every king. . .performed. .. in the autumn and lasted for seven days. It was a kind of military and religious ceremony performed by kings or generals of armies... preparatory to a campaign. It was general purification, by means of sacred mantras, of the king's priests, his ministers and all the various component parts of an army, together with the arms and implements of war. It was also accompanied by a kind of triumphal march, parade and mock-fight ... Revanta is described .., as having two strong arms and his body shining with armour... He should have a whip in his left hand and a sword in the right, and he should be placed on a white horse and worshipped with the same rites as used in the worship of the Sun-god." I have long suspected that Kyanzittha's chief queen, Abeyadana, came from Patikkard. Her temple (architecture apart) is so different from any other at Pagan. There must have been a deep love and sympathy between husband and wife to bridge that wide religious gulf. (The gift-princess loved by Kyanzittha in the Chronicles128 is said to have come from Pegu: perhaps she really came from Patik- kara ?). Abeyadana was a faithful wife, and followed her husband, it seems, when he fled as an outlaw to the north. Perhaps, after the disaster of Pyidawtha-kyun 29, they meant to escape to Bengal; but when they got to Nga Singu, north of Mandalay, having won to their side the powerful headman of Singaing, they fell back on Kyaukse; and with secret pressure, no doubt, from Pagan, then under close siege by the rebel Nga Raman, they decided to make a fight for it. It was Kyanzittha's most dangerous campaign. The rebel, in full flush of victory, pursued him as far as Ava. He had but a month or two to improvise a force of raw recruits, and train them to face a seasoned, disciplined army. What did he do ? - The Chronicles'30 tell an extraordinary tale of magic rites at Ledwin (Kyauks'), performed - obviously with Kyanzittha's approval - by the Htihlaing monk, Shin Poppa: - "He recited charms over minium and cinnabar, and drew figures of the sun and moon on the frontlets of elephants, on saddle pommels, on shields of every kind.. . and on standards of war, and surrounded them with magic charms and sorceries. When he had prepared them he piled them in rows at Ledwin . . . And Kyanzittha, when he had performed divers rites of magic, fought with all his host; and the soldiers of Nga Ramain were sore afraid as though he would eat their flesh; and the mighty battle was broken." Such a story, so alien to all we know of Kyanzittha's normally austere Buddhist piety, is not likely to be untrue. But something had to be done, and done quickly, to give these raw soldiers confidence and courage. And what expedient more likely would Abeyadana suggest, or Kyanzittha adopt, than to perform the Patikkard purification ceremony before committing them to battle? If this picture of the peril of that hour is not fanciful, Abeyadana had good reason for giving Revanta a place of honour among the gods of her devotion; and Kyanzittha, both as husband and soldier, if not as pious Buddhist, must have approved. 127 N.

DECAY AND VANDALISM The chief material glory of the Pagan period is its architecture. Hundreds of stupas, temples and monasteries, built nearly all of brick, still stud the 25 square miles which, in its largest sense, we call Pagan. Yule guessed their number to be not less than eight hundred, perhaps a thousand'. The buildings range in size from small stupas ten or twenty feet high, to four-storeyed cathedrals climbing to two hundred feet. This is what remains today; but it is only half the story. Beyond the laterite coast, Burma's native architecture and carving have always chiefly been in wood. At Pagan, where now the plain is loaded with brick monuments, inscriptions show that there was once a wealth of Wood - palaces, schools, colleges and monasteries - perhaps the major glory of Pagan. With their looped and fretted eavesplates, and roofs tapering or slung like chandeliers, they must have lightened and set off to great advantage the brick masses in between. The brick monuments themselves were then less lumpish than they are now. Enclosure-walls and square-set brick monas- teries have not changed much, perhaps, except for decay; but time has blunted or levelled every spire and pinnacle; and archaeology dare do no more than clear the rubble, cement leaks, and grout the ruin. One cannot reconstruct a heap of brick, as archaeologists in Java have given new life to heaps of carved stone. But man himself has been more cruel to these monuments than time. The brick was once enriched with stucco carving, imitating wood. Tongues of foliation broke the plinth; acanthus scrollwork lifted the pilaster; tasselled monsters lolled below the cornice; rhombs of green or yellow glaze em- bossed the crenellations; horns involving Capricorn and leogryph, with spires between of leaf and bud and stalk, composed a living crown for every door and window. Many of these lovely details are now lost beneath lime whitewash, which villagers, and even temple-trustees, delight to spill all down the outside of pagodas, daub over stone inscriptions, and splash across the old paintings of the interiors. Treasure-hunters have disembowelled all the larger images. And with the coming of westerners, has come a taste for the garish, the gaudy and the foreign, fouling the old masterpieces - the Shw&amp;- zigon, the Nanda, and many others. 1 H. Yule, A Narrative of the Mission ... to the Court of Ava in I855, p. 35.</page><page sequence="248">230 Chapter XII Nor have Burmans been the only vandals. About i89i Dr. Fritz von Noetling2 ravished to Berlin over two hundred of the best glazed plaques and Jdtaka-carvings of the Mingalazedi, Dhammarajaka and So-min-gyi pagodas, and not a few stone images, reliefs and clay ex-votoes. For years they have lain unseen in dusty cellars of the Berlin Museum fur V6lkerkunde. In i899 one Th. H. Thomann3, with at least five assistants (C. von Dietrich, J. Muller, Meurer, Ronkel, Kugelmeyer, etc. - they have left their signatures upon the walls that they defaced4), sought to devastate Pagan in the interest, it seems, of the Hamburg Ethnological Museum. They were finally caught and expelled, and a small portion of their loot recovered and replaced, sometimes on wrong pagodas. But several of the smaller temples west of Htilominlo show the scars where they sawed off the fresco; and the great Shrine- Hall of the Kubyauk-gyi of Wet-kyi-in, once the pride of the Old Burmese painter, has been irrepar- ably damaged. - These have been the worst vandals; but globetrotters too, for decades past, have 'souvenired' among the ruins5, and still racket up the secret trade with native desecrators. One never sees, as once one saw in the pagodas, small images in stone or bronze still unpurloined. It is not enough to judge Pagan by what one sees of it today. One has at times to blench at gross modernities. One has continually to bear in mind what is no longer there. To read the original inscrip- tions (there are over 550 of them), each on its proper site, is the best resource: but it serves more to whet curiosity than to satisfy it. MATERIALS What, according to these inscriptions6, were the main elements of a Pagin dedication? - The question is worth answering fully, before one deals with particular pagodas; so that, regarding these, one may (with the eye of faith, justified) fill in the picture. WOOD The main materials used were wood, brick and stone. Wood is our greatest loss; for apart from a few images and carvings7, and some large lattice-doors8, sanctum-rails and lintelsg, there can be little woodwork at Pagan today surviving from its period as capital. STONE Good stone was rare, except in Kyauks6 on the edge of the hills. At Pagan it was very rarely used for whole buildings; and only in the older monuments of the 'Mon' period.

A visitor who robs it, even of a farthing 'oil-lamp', is not only denounced with terrible curses in the inscriptions, but regarded much as a Christian would regard a robber of Communion plate. 6 Inscriptions are few in the period covered by this book, but become numerous soon after it. For much of what follows in this chapter, I have had to depend on written evidence not strictly contemporary. But where possible, I cite inscriptions dating before 6oo s./I238 A.D. This date is arbitrary; there is no sudden change anywhere in the evolution. 7 e.g. PIs. 419-423; I76 a, b. 8 e.g. PIs.

Tuywin, was perhaps the only known building east of the Arakan Yoma wholly built of stone. PI. 242 shows it as it was in I905 - still an object of beauty. It is nothing now (if anything remains) but a heap of stones, used as a quarry. A few other buildings - the Nan-paya of Myinpagan (Pls. I2I-I3i), and the main storey of Kyaukku Onhmin N.E. of Nyaung-u (PIs. I32-I42) - have stone facings on a brick core. The fact that the stone was cut usually to the size of bricks, and carved after the cutting, shows that stone was none too familiar as an art-material, even to the Mons. The Old Burmese word for Sculptor or Stone-carver (tamo')10 is just the Old Mon word for Stone (tmo'). Fine stone carving and sculpture can be seen at Nanpaya and Kyaukku Onhmin; and hundreds of stone images of medium size (often plastered, lacquered or gilded) line the corridors of Nat-hlaung-gyaung, Kyaukku Onhmin, Nagayon, Nanda, etc. - mostly 'Mon' temples. Colossal stone images are few: the main image at Kyaukku Onhmin (PI. I33 a)"1; a crowned earth-touching Buddha seated in a 'tazaung' at the N.W. corner of the Nanda enclosure12; others (perhaps post-Pagan) seated in dhydta mudrd, in a cell just north of the east gandhakutf of Shwehsandaw (PI. 85 a)13, or with ablution-slab below it in the E. temple of Dham- marajaka 4; and there are doubtless more. One of the largest, about 20 ft. high, is the earth-touching Buddha of Than-daw-gyal5 south of Pitakat-taik, within the walls of Pagan. It is made of 'stone bricks' of two qualities, originally plastered, and may belong to the latter part of the period. At Shwdzigon stone was used for Buddha Footprints (PI. 93 a), images of 'Nats' or spirits (PI. I76 a, b, c, d), ten- armed Devas (PI. I76 e, f), guardian lions (PI. I77) and a horse. Perforated windows were often wrought in carved stone (PI. 82 etc.). Stone was also commonly used to strengthen brickwork, especially at corners and in arches. 'Stone bricks' were set at intervals within brick courses. Stone points may wedge the cusps below the pediments16. Stone blocks may clip the jambs of doorways, with sockets for great wooden doors to move in. Pro- jecting angles were dressed with stone cusps. A colossal brick image will often have the face, or mouth and chin, carved on a horizontal stone slab, which interlocks behind with reredos or wall'7. Stone is commonly used for small images and lotus-thrones; for model stupas placed in relic-chambers18 (PI. 4I4 c); for stair-ramps, bell-pillars (Pis. 379, 380), large votive almsbowls and umbrellas; for door- sills'9, pavements20, 'plates' for bearing wooden uprights21; for tops of parapets22; for boundary pillars23 and inscriptions24. At PagAn the stone used was almost always sandstone, though gilded 10 tamo'. I.B., PI.

I I032, 59I S./I229-30 A.D.), I think it may refer to the low brick parapet, rarely coped with stone, that forms the inner wall round several temples. 23 Stone pillars for demarcating chapter-houses or ordination halls (hence called then, Pali sfmd, 'limits'), were particularly important. See, e.g. I.B., I 3610iy simklok samuit, 574 S./I2I2 A.D. (Caw Rahan's Thein, Tuywin- daung). 24 'Stone writings' (klokca) are frequently mentioned from the first: e.g. I.B., I 44, 527 s./ii65-6 A.D.</page><page sequence="250">232 Chapter XII marble images are mentioned25, and 'andagu' stone (query: dolomite ?) was used for intricately carved small Eight-Scene slabs26. In Kyauks6, within easy reach of hill-quarries, mica schist ('Webu' stone,)27 was used for inscriptions early in the period, and marble near the end. Laterite was not used except in coastal Burma. BRICK Ut, the Burmese word for Burnt Brick, is Indo-Aryan in origin28. Its use originally came, perhaps with Buddhism, from India. The brick monastery, frequently mentioned in Paga'n inscriptions, is always 'the Indian monastery' (kuld kloji)29. The Paga'n brick, large and thin by western standards, is not usually as big as the Pyu brick of Arl Ksetra. The size varies a good deal; the average may be about I4" X 7" x 2". It varies also in quality: usually excellent, sometimes sandy and crumbling. "The good brick clinked like glass" is the phrase used in an early Ava inscription30. In building, vertical courses of brick often interrupt the horizontal; in the Nagayon temple of Kyanzittha there are almost as many of one as of the other. The average quality of brick must have been high to bear the enormous dead-weight of many of these temples and pagodas, I50 to 200 ft. in height. The Old Burmese word for Mortar comes from Mon3l. As used at Pagan, it was often poor in quality. For holding the bricks together, the masons trusted rather to a tight fit. The word for the externally applied Stucco Plaster, looks Indian32, but one does not find it in the classical dictionaries. Its quality, and the varying beauty of its carving - whether in high relief at the beginning of the period, or fine lacework at the end - are normally high, where damp and whitewash have not sodden it. It often looks as if it had been carved yesterday. Where were the bricks baked? It is a mystery. Ut-phuiw, 'brick-kiln', may occur anywhere in Old Burmese, not usually as a place-name; there was one up the Chindwin opposite Amyint33; and one, Ut-phuiw-rait, under Khamlhii34 in the north-west of Kyaukse. There are certainly old kiln-sites around Paga'n; but there must always have been a shortage of firewood there. Bricks, or firewood for that matter, could easily reach Paga'n by river. There is no need to assume that all the baking was done in or near the capital. And the supposition that once the country around Pagan was verdant forest, until the temple-builders cut it down to burn their bricks, and turned the land into a desert, is contrary to nearly all the evidence35. 25 I.B., P1.

The 'white stone' (kiok phlfi), often used for Kyauks6 inscriptions from the end of the Pagan period, wrongly defined as Alabaster on p. 227 of Judson's Dictionary (i893 Ed.), has been shown by the geologist, Dr. Tha Hla, to be Marble (see his 'Note' at J.B.R.S. June I959, Vol. XLII, Part I, pp. II3-Ii8); he has traced this stone a few miles E. of Kyauks' town; and it is pretty certain that Pagan marble came from the Kyaukse foothills rather than from the Sagyin quarries N. of Mandalay. At I.B., Preface to Portfolio IV, pp. I2-I3, for 'Alabaster' read 'Marble'. 26 Pls. 400-406. On p. 6i of Judson's Dictionary andagfi is defined as 'dolomite, or magnesian carbonate of lime'. This has not yet, I think, been confirmed by the geologists. 27 See Dr. Tha Hla's 'Note' cited supra. 28 Thai, Shan, Mon, Khmer, Burmese, etc. all take their word for 'burnt brick' from Pali itthaka. 29 The first mention of kfild kloh I have noted is at I.B., P1.

In the Nat-hlaung-gyaung (Pis. I43-I49) the standing Visnus of the inner corridor are carved in brick, while the Avatdras of what was once the outer corridor, are carved in stone: the former, though now worn and mutilated, are not inferior as art to the latter; and the main image of the temple, now alnost totally destroyed, was probably of brick. SITE Sites for building were apt to be chosen, by Burmese kings at any rate, for magical reasons: the laksana (auspicious marks) must show that the site was a 'land of victory' (Old Burm. on mliy, Pali jayabhiimi, later corrupted into cainkhu*r, 'Zigon'). The first Pagan 'Zigon', modern Shw6-zigon with the prefix 'Golden', built by Kyanzittha about io86 A.D., is still the Burman's national pagoda. Caflsfi II, the first Burmese king to use Burmese in his inscriptions, "went out towards Torah (Tuywin- daung) in the east. 'That shining thing', he asked, 'is it a fire ?' 'Yes, it is a fire,' his followers replied. But the king was ware that it was a ruby shining. He turned back his elephant. 'Ah!' he said, 'this land is truly excellent,' and he trod the site for a royal temple"36. This was the Sulamani (Cilcdmani), ii83 A.D., the model for most of the later Burmese temples. The site for his second big dedication - the Dhammardjaka at West Pwazaw - was found in much the same way. In 558 s./ii96 A.D., from his capital Paga'n, the king "went forth in search of a site with auspicious marks (bhummalaksan), to serve as a field of merit (puiiakhetta) for the building of a royal cats (cetiya). And lo! he saw a column of vapour, pure white, issuing from the ground and ascending, in height and volume like a palmyra palm. 'Ah!' he said, 'the showing of this Sign (nimit) must certainly mean .. ' Thus longingly he thought, and with a heart ...... he caused them to note the spot by driving in an iron nail at the place from which the said column of vapour issued. . ."37 TANTUIN Having found his site, the Pagan donor would first enclose it with a brick wall (Old Burm. araw tantuiii)38, nearly always square or oblong. One main purpose of the wall was to protect the buildings within from fire3. The enclosed area was planted with trees, usually the valuable palmyra palm40. Often, too, there were sacred fig-trees41, sometimes imported as seeds or seedlings from Bodhgayd42. Such trees today have mostly yielded to wild growth of thorny acacia or euphorbia. The enclosure-wall is commonly described as beautifull'; and indeed, when well constructed and preserved, it still deserves the title. When not plastered, its red colour is warm and lovely. The enclosure walls of $,'List I133-7, 545 s./1ii83 A.D. The inscription - an early, and probably a faithful, copy of the original - is in the Sulamani temple. 37 I.B., PI.

The square Nanda wall is the most impressive: i2 feet in height, 9j feet thick at the base, embossed on the outer side with exactly a thousand squared, archaic, double-banded stupas in relief, and pierced at the axial points by massive gateways 48 feet high. Elsewhere, in the centre of one, two, or all four faces of the enclosure-wall, there is usually a large gateway44, often elaborately arched and roofed. There may be 'double enclosure-walls'45, the outer high, the inner a low parapet once coped with stone46. Within the inner-wall were the more sacred buildings: caitya (cetl), temple (kii), chapter- house (sim), hall for preaching (dhammasd, tryd im),47 and perhaps the main monastery reserved for the abbot (thera). In the outer enclosure or beyond, arranged in lines, were the brick or wooden monasteries of the other monks (ariyd, aryd)48, schools49, 'tazaungs'50 or resthouses, 'zayats'51 or sheds for alms- giving, storehouses52 water-tanks53, wells5, latrines55, etc. CANKRASI The raised foundation of the major buildings (cetf, Putluiw, kit, sim, etc.) was called the cankra*i56 or promenade-platform. It is always mentioned separately in the inscriptions, as a distinct element in the dedication. Its prime purpose was to enable the worshipper to make his reverential ambit of the pagoda, keeping his right side towards it (Sanskrit pradaksina). 'The long, the beautiful, the jewelled promenade-platform, like in form to a kalasd pot' - such are the stock phrases describing it in the inscriptions57. The kalasa pot is an Indian symbol of fertility, suggestive of a woman's breasts. Applied to the platform, it can only refer to the plinth-mouldings that support it; of which, indeed, the astragal, recess and bulge often form a pot-like silhouette. The platform will be oblong, square, five-sided, cruciform, etc., according to the shape of the building it supports. In Old Mon dedications, and some of the later Burmese, it stood in the middle of the enclosure, as in Khmer architecture, at the intersection of the axes. But the Pagan Burman did not feel as keenly as the Mon or Khmer the need for symmetry; and some of the later Minnanthu and Pwazaw dedications assemble at haphazard kit, cets and kuld klotN within the common enclosure-wall. CETI, PUT(UIW The Stupa (Sanskrit stigpa, Pali thfipa), according to Gisbert Combaz58, is pre-Buddhist in origin.

It begins to take shape, e.g. (cylinder and cone) in the tomb of Tantalus in Phrygia, or (terraced cylinders with dome) in the Amrit necropolis opposite Arvad in North Phoenicia, guarded by four lions at the base. In Buddhist India, from the simple tumulus, it tends to pass into a place for relics, then into a memorial, and finally a votive monument. In Burma, the evolution is seen, well beyond the Pagan period, in such titles as SarYTaka Cetf, 'Caitya of the Bodily Relics'59. Cafisf II's DhammaraJaka pagoda (ii96-8 A.D.) is called a cdtf (i.e. caitya)60; and it certainly contained "four of the thirty Body Relics (sadra dhat) sent on request by the king of Ceylon", "together with the Lion Relic"61. But elsewhere ceUf is used without mention of relics, as if it merely meant a solid pagoda, in contrast to kit, temple62. The word 'pahto' (put'uiw), very common in the inscriptions63, usually means much the same as 'zedi' (cets). It is derived from Pali vatthis, 'the ground, the site;' and could therefore be used, like vat or wat in other parts of South-East Asia, as a general term for any religious dedication. I suspect that 'moktaw' (Old Burm. rnatlo)64, now usually confined to very ancient pagodas attributed to AMoka, is a variant, very likely a Pyu pronunciation8, of pUt'uiw. Such names as Dayin-pahto (tiaraht put'iW)66 'the site with toranas,' or Pnhto-thamya, applied to temples, still show the word used in a large sense. But usually it is confined to the solid stupa, whether the tapering pinnacles crowning the peaks of hills67 (after the manner loved by Burmans), or massive pagodas like the Shwdzigon88, Sizana69 or Mingalazedi70 lording it over the plain, or even miniatures in gold, silver, copper, sandalwood, ver- milion, orpiment, ivory or stone71, enshrined in relic-chambers. Moka, we know, in the I5th year of his reign, enlarged to double the size the stupa of Kanakamuni (Kondgamana) at Nigliva, not far from Kapilavastu72. His own brick stupa at Sa-fci was encased in stone a century later, and brought to its present dimensions73. The same method of 'repair' was em- ployed in Burma, both at Ari Ksetra and Pagan. When ruined stupas were repaired, the old ruin was just 'wrapped' (Old Burm. llwam) in a new casing. The bulk might thus give some measure of the antiquity. Several Pagan stupas, damaged by decay or treasure-hunters, reveal a number of inner 59 e.g. I.B., P1.

The title of the first, 'Buddha's Seal', is transcribed *muat-dca-myie; which suggests that the Pyu nasalized the labial in 'Buddha'. Their script proves that they had two b's, transcribed by Blagden b and b (Epig. Birm. I, I, pp. 62-63). The word 'Buddha', which occurs several times on the two stones, is usually spelt with b. Perhaps this was the pre-glottal b, which is often misheard as m. Did the Pyu use the same sound in vatthu ? 66 I.B., P1. I I073 turaihputhuiw I luhi. 67 e.g. I.B., P1.

U Mya, whose experience in opening encased stupas at Pagan is unrivalled, has noted as follows74: -"There are many more 'enveloped' stupas, varying in size from a few feet to very large sizes; none of these monuments at Pagan can be dated earlier than the iith century A.D. The date of the building of the inner stupa and of its outer envelope cannot be far removed in time; for they were built of the same type of brick, and the relics found in both belonged to almost the same age. It may be surmised that the inner stupa served as a sort of relic casket, and the outer covering was added to it immediately after its completion." The chief parts of a Paga'n cets are (i) the at'wat or metal crown; (ii) the tapering ringed spire of piled umbrellas (Sanskrit chattrdvali); (iii) the 'mansion' or 'pavilion' (harmikd) below it; (iv) the main dome or bell (Sanskrit anlda 'egg' or garbha 'womb'); and (v) the spreading terraces at the bottom (Sanskrit medhT or dlinda), with or without medial stairs (so pdna). One ceUf had a front extension (Old Burm. i-t'wak)75, a term (see infra) usually confined to the wooden hall in front of a brick monastery. AT'WAT The most brilliant and costly part of the cetT was the metal finial (Old Burm. at'wat). The word is Tibeto-Burman, meaning a 'crown'. The same word is used for the top part of a temple (Sanskrit s'ikhara, Pali thkipika). It is now made of iron, gilded; but only once in Pagan inscriptions is iron mentioned in this connection7. It was usually made of a mixture of gold, mercury and copper. The purer copper preferred was that of the Mons (Old Mon slfiy, Old Burm. salwai)78. The following de- scription of a miniature stupa, the chief piece in a relic-chamber, gives interesting details about the whole, including the atlwat79: - "At the enshrinement of the temple, the Body-Relics were placed in a sandalwood casket80. Outside that, was a casket of crystal81. Outside that, was a casket of red sandalwood82. Outside that, were Pitufiw, first of gold, then of silver, then gilded and embossed with gems, then of ivory, then copper83, and outside that the stone Put'itiw. Therein were also placed leather-mats84 of gold and silver, parched rice85 of gold and silver, and chandeliers88 of gold and silver. All these were offered in worship and 74 U Mya, A.S.I.

As for the stone putcuiw, it was painted and tied criss-cross with copper thread87. As for the crown (atcwat), it was made of gold. Above the crown a gold umbrella88 was set up. The gold umbrella was hung with pearl89 and coral90. As far as the base of the crown there were seven wrappings of cloth, with gold 'sun-gods' (kyak tanuiy9l) stamped on the cloth. One golden Buddha cast with 30 (ticals) of gold; one silver Buddha cast with 50 (ticals) of silver; one Buddha made of marble92 and gilded - all shaded with gold and silver umbrellas. All these, so finely made, were enshrined". The main crown of the temple (kit tcwat) is described as follows93: - "As materials for the crown of the temple, 47 ViSS94, 8 bjih95, 4 ticals96 of copper (kriy) were cut off and weighed into the hands of the goldsmith (panthyan97); 7 viss, 9 ticals, was lost in the cutting; so the net amount of copper left was 40 viss, 7 buih, 5 ticals. The amount of sterling gold (rhuy sd) included was 393 ticals, and of liquid mercury98 (pratd ran-) I59 ticals. With such precious things the crown of the temple was made to shine." This was the minister Anantasfira's first dedication at LUmyet-hna, Minnanthu, in I223 A.D. Four years later, when his wife died, he made another99. This time, as materials for the crowns of two cets he cut off and gave the goldsmith 47 Viss, I3 buih of copper; the wastage was 6 viss, 3 buih; and the net amount left was 4I viss, IO buih. As before, he gave also liquid mercury and sterling gold; but the quantities are illegible. Elsewhere, for a small temple crown, the amounts given were "4i viss of copper costing 3 ticals of silver; Ii (?) ticals of gold costing I2 ticals of silver; 3 ticals of mercury costing 2 ticals of silver, io ticals of silver for wages, IO ticals of silver for iron."100 Whether the iron was used for the atcwat or elsewhere, is doubtful. For another "golden temple-crown", the amounts were "55j viss of copper, and 46 ticals of gold for smearing on the temple-crown." A horse was given as a reward to the artist101. An 'umbrella-pole' went down the middle of the atcwat, was held at the base by the harmikd, and spread out at the top into an umbrella. The word for the pole, yafthi88, has passed into Burmese hti (Old Burm. Mc), 'umbrella', and is now used in architecture to comprise the whole spire, especially the metal finial. The old stone umbrellas, once a measure of the dead chieftain's range of authority, soon merged in the brick structure as a spire. Their tapering rings varied greatly in number (say, from about 7 to i9), and even in size, according as the harmikd was present or not.

Originally the relic-chamber, it was furnished with a lid; it also served as a stand for the umbrellas above it. In the Singhalese ddgaba it remained prominent, even at Polonnaruwa102. At Pagan, from Caiisii II's reign onwards, if not before, the Singhalese type of pagoda, with harmikd, is to be found103. Early attempts were made, however, both in India and Burma, to soften the square edges of the harmikd by deeply recessing it towards the sides, and deeply indenting it towards the bottom and sometimes the top104. But already, on encased stupas at Grl Ksetra, the harmikd was sometimes omitted'05; and the chattravali broadened at the base so as to taper as a cone from dome to finial. For safety perhaps, the relic-chamber was removed from its conspicuous position and secreted deep within the pile. This finally becomes the norm at Pagan, not only on the major stupas from Shwehsandaw onwards, but also on stone minia- tures found in relic-chambers106. The Paga'n spire, just below the finial, has normally an up-and-down turned lotus107, implying, as always, the special sanctity of what rests on it. Just below this, one can sometimes see a bulbous collar (see, e.g. PI. 259 b), betokening the original finial - the purifying fruit of the emblic myrobalan, Sanskrit dmalaka'08, a Vaisnava symbol. The chattrdvali usually consists of round rings simply turned; but on some of the earlier pagodas, both stupas and temples, it is a conical figure of six, eight, or twelve faces, the corners joined, the faces ribbed horizontally (e.g. P1. 258 a). The Nagayon Paw- dawmu (P1. 78 d) is peculiar, with its flat-faced, notchless pyramid. In contrast to the modern pagoda, the Paga6n spire preserves a strong straight profile, never concave. But one needs to remember that, apart from miniatures in relic-chambers, few extant spires at Pagan can really date from the Pagan period. ANDA The AMokan dome (anda, 'egg'), a flattened hemisphere of brick, was lifted by the Pyu, as it had been at Amardvati, to tall cylinder and cone. The transition thence to bell-shape, by the lowering of the cylinder, contraction of the shoulders, and spreading of the base, is nature's way. It is as if the Burmans saw and copied a Pyu ruin. But the change was gradual and uneven. Already at 8ri Ksetra the bell-shaped stupa appears, with a band round the centre105. This soon developed as the Pagan norm, though cylindrical and even bulbous forms persist (Pls. 75-77)109. The oldest bulbous stupa is 102 e.g. the Rankot, Kiri and Alahana Parivena stupas (Ceylon Hist. journ., I954-55, Polonnaruva period, Plates unnumbered). 103 e.g. the Sapada pagoda, Nyaung-u (Lu Pe Win, Pictorial Guide to Pagan, p. 23), or the Sizana stupa in the far south (Thomann, Pagan, abbildg. 6i). For earlier types with harmikd, not necessarily based on Singhalese, see P1. 78 a (Pebin-gyaung) and P1. 96 a (East Hpet-leik). The harymika is also noticeable on several of the Arakan Mrohaung pagodas, Shitthaung, Dukkanthein, etc. (A.S.B. I92I, Pls. I, II). 104 e.g. the West Hpet-leik (P1. 94 a), the stupa S. of Myinpagan school (P1. 258 a, b), Sitle pagoda (P1. 2i0 d), Seinnyet-nyima (P1. 377). 105 See A.S.I. I926, P1. LV c; I928, P1.

The largest, Nga-kywe-nadaung (P1. 75 b, c), is now sheathed in shimmering opalescent glaze. The stupa itself is old: and the large-scale use of glazed brick in Burma certainly goes back to late Pyu times (9th cent. A.D."0). But I doubt if this pagoda's lovely glaze-facing is much older than Kyanzittha's time: for the great popularity of glazed work at Paga'n seems to start with him. The Pagan anda is left occasionally plain"1; but generally it is strapped with horizontal medial bands, enforced by stucco decoration. The earlier taller cylinders may have two separate bands, above and below"12. Usually there is a single band in the centre, beaded or corded, and studded at intervals with diamond rosettes; above, a line of stucco peepal leaves or toothing; below, toothing or (more often) a 'frieze' of looping kUrtimukhas. Four niches, holding seated Buddhas, surmounted with the Bodhgayd gikhara, may be let into the four sides of the anda"3. Above the top octagonal terrace, the anda itself, like the stupas shown on votive tablets, normally rests on a round mat of double lotus, marking its sacred character. MEDHI, ALINDA Terraces at Old Prome are generally round and narrow, mere props to the cylinder above them, not rimmed with crenellated parapets nor broached by flights of steps. Where steps occur, they may be only on one side, and lead merely to the platform on which the stupa stands"14. At Pagan, round terraces, without flights of steps, persist, especially at the smaller stupas115. Octagonal pedestals or terraces occur"16. Five-sided terraces are not unknown'17. But square terracing soon becomes normal, usually with octagons above to ease transition between square and round. The number of terraces, both square and octagonal, may vary. Sizanall8 has four square terraces; Shwdhsandaw (P1. 83 a) five, crowned with two octagonal; Shw6zigon (PIs. i69-M71) three square, with octagon above; Mingalazedi'19 the same. This last becomes the norm. The combined height of the terraces in pro- portion to that of the pagoda as a whole, is greatest at Shwehsandaw: it is over twice as high as the stupa proper. At Shwe-zigon and Mingalazedi the terraces are less in total height than the stupa above them. In breadth, compared to grl Ksetra pagodas, the Pagan terraces have greatly increased their spread. The whole shape, in fact, has changed from cylinder to pyramid. With the square terracing, four 110 See my note on "The Ancient Pyu", J.B.R.S. XXVII, III, I937, pp. 250-I. The Man-shu (c. 863 A.D.) and the two T'ang Histories all confirm this: even the city-wall was said to be faced with glazed brick. Their information mostly relates to the Pyu of 8oo-802 A.D., when their capital was probably Halin, S. of Shwebo. No glazed work has yet, I think, been found at their earlier capital, gri Ksetra. Nor yet, it seems, at Halin. But excavations there are only beginning. 1ll e.g. Sapada pagoda, Nyaung-u (Pictorial Guide. .., p. 23), Nga-kyw6-nadaung (P1. 75 b, c)., Pebin-gyaung (P1. 78 a). 112 e.g. Myinkaba stupa (P1. 79 a), Lokananda stupa (P1. 92 a), W.

This meant loss of height, or rather of climb, unless ramps were steepened and steps made precipitously narrow. Some- times the steps reach only the lower terraces'21. Sometimes they are absent'22. But the squareing and broadening of the terraces brought new architectural possibilities. At gri Ksetra the stupa stood alone, aloof, towering, almost two-dimensional, for the profile hardly varied. At Paga'n with the round 'bell' planted on the square terrace, an octagon between, there were corner-spaces to be filled with corner-stupas, miniatures maybe of the central stupa, picked out in glazed bricks, green or yellow'23. At the corners of the lower terraces, where less space was available, vase-like cornucopias'24, double- bodied lions, masks of monsters, or stepped-up gnomons'25 modelled on wooden eaves-plates, capped with stone Devas each guarding his dlinda, might serve as pieces d'accent. Stone lions, too, might guard the bottom corners or the medial steps, or stone umbrellas at their base, or pedimented arch- ways crowning successive flights. On the Buddha's descent from Tdvatihsa to Safikassa, three stairways, of jewels, gold and silver, for himself, Indra and Brahmd, were built by Visvakarman. Makara is said to have supported the base: and so he is represented in a painting in Gu 449, between the Tawya-gyaung and Thiripyit- saya'26. From the latter part of the Paga'n period the makara motif becomes regular on stairways in Burma, both at pagodas and monasteries. Possibly it was copied from Polonnaruwa, where balustrades showing the horned makara (Capricornus) are conspicuous at the entrance to Tivafika image house, the Laftkdtilaka temple, etc., built by Pardkramabdhu 1127. Beauty and grandeur enter into the moulding of the plinth, with bold outlines modelled perhaps on the Mon stupas of Thatonl28. The plain cube of the terrace is nearly always broken in plan by a series of small recessions towards the corners129; which end, in modern Burma, by breaking down the corners altogether'30. It is also broken in section by dado, waistband, cornice, parapet, and a whole series of astragal, ovolo and ogee curves and cordage joining them. Tropic light and shade are thus delight- fully broken and distributed, each moving abreast, but not together, and leaping like a living thing from vantage to vantage, all the livelong day. Terrace-mouldings may consist of framed rows of pots or stupas in reliefl3l, plinth-mouldings of kneeling elephants'32. Parapets are usually embattled, 120 cf. Thaton, Thagya-paya (A.S.I.

Sometimes the battlements or masked angle- pieces are picked out in glaze, or cornices enriched with green-glazed foliations, beaker-mouldings, diamonds or beaded stud-medallions, set in a running band of lotus or acanthus135. The Somin-gyi glazed work (Pls. 259-262 bis), not sunk in pockets, but braving the weather on every convex course, is alive with little dancers and drummers, and small vignettes of frolic animals and birds. JATAKA-PLAQUES Illustrations of Jdtaka stories in stone have an ancient history in India, from Bhdrhut (2nd cent. B.C.), Sficl and Gandhdra onwards. In Burma they appear chiefly on terracotta reliefs outside pagodas, or in paint within them. Neither have yet been found at Srl Ksetra136; both are visible everywhere at Pagan. Large terracotta tablets of good quality and design, illustrating the ten Mahdnipcta Jdtakas, once lined the middle terrace of Thagya-paya at Thaton137. Stone relief-carvings of the same Ten Jdtakas adorn the boundary pillars of the Kalydnl ssmcd there 138. The Ten Jdtakas are also listed on king Makuta's pandit inscription at Thaton Shw6zayanl39. So it seems likely that the art of Jdtaka illustration was carried to Pagan (c. I057 A.D.) by captives from Thaton. Three pagodas attributed to Aniruddha, the Shw6hsandaw and the two Hpet-leik, were lined with Jdtakas in terracotta. These were unglazed. Those of the Shwehsandaw (Pls. 86, 87), being exposed to sun and rain, have mostly weathered away. Those of the two Hpet-leik (Pls. 97-Ii6), being set in rows along the vaulted corridors surrounding the base of the stupas, have preserved a fresh nicety of design and detail not to be found elsewhere. But buried in dark corridors, they lose their architectural value, which depends, not on their design or detail, but on the life and colour they inspire when spaced along exteriors. Kyanzittha, from the first, loved glazes, and used them freely on all his pagodas. Perhaps it was fear of terracotta weathering that made him take the extraordinary bold step of glazing sandstone. This was used (c. 133 See PI. 372 d. On both the inner and outer sides of Nagayon enclosure-wall, there are also battlements below the skyline. 1'4 See Pls. 329-334. 135 Specimens of such glazed work can be seen at Pagan Museum. 136 A Khin Ba Gon terracotta panel (Arch. Negs. 2875, 75I0) shows a king seated in pralambandsana on lion- throne between two standing attendants bearing regalia (?). Duroiselle (A.S.I. I927, p. I73 and P1.

He reverted to glazed terracotta for the Jdtakas on his final pagoda, Nanda140 (c. II05 A.D.). These (Pls. 324-328) are fairly preserved, and in spite of the ruin wrought by white- wash, still retain some semblance of their lovely green. But he had no ceramists to match in carving the skill of Aniruddha's artists. And the poses, dress and general arrangement of Jdtaka plaques at the Dhammardjaka, Mingalazedi, etc. 41, show little variety, and are inferior as art to those of Hpet- leik. But more important was their colour; and this maintained an admirable consistency throughout the Paga'n period, and beyond it142. In his Nagayon temple (Pls. i84-i87) Kyanzittha used plain glazed tiles with excellent effect to give life, unity and tone to masses of stuccoed brick. GLAZE No glazed work has yet been found at the first Pyu capital, gri Ksetra. But at Halin (if that was the Pyu capital which, in 800-2 A.D., sent missions to Ch'ang-an) there was a thriving industry in glazed ware. "They use green bricks," says the Man-sh/M43 (c. 863 A.D.), "to make the walls surrounding their city. It is one day's journey to walk round it." "The compass of the city-wall," says the Chi i- t'ang-shj1s44, "is faced with glazed brick. It is i6o ii in circumference." "They make their tiles of lead and tin," says the Hsin-t'ang-shu; "....... They traffic with the neighbouring tribes in ... glazed ware and earthenware jars." "Whenever persons are sent," adds the Man-shu, to the Nan-chao capital near Ta-li Lake, "they take ... glazed jars for barter or trade." In their contemporary accounts of coastal Burma, the Chinese make no mention of glazed ware. The second Pyu capital was sacked by Nan-chao in 832 A.D., only i8 years before the founding of Pagan. If it is probable that Aniruddha got his Jdtaka-artists from Thaton, there is no evidence that they brought glazing with them. Glazing may have been an art native to Upper Burma. In any case, in the 8th-9th century, it had overland contact with India via Assam 45. Recently, at our request, the Burmese glazing expert, U Kyaw Nyein, and the American expert Sergio R. Dello Strologo, visited Pagan. Guided by Mon Bo Kay the archaeologist and Col. Ba Shin, they made a quick survey of twelve temples and pagodas with glazing, and excavated a small glazing kiln S.E. of Myinkaba. Specimens were taken and given spectrographic analysis at the Union of Burma Applied Research Institute. From their report I quote the following extracts: - 140 See Pls. 324-328 for JAtaka terracottas. The Nanda also contains (as 'rejects' perhaps, in the cross-passages) some stone relief-sculptures of Jatakas: see Pls. 320-323. 141 See Duroiselle, "Pictorial Representations of Jatakas in Burma", A .S.I.

KU Pyu go, Old Mon guol, Old Burmese kit - all from Sanskrit guha, "secret place, cave". Once hollowed out of rock, both in Eastern and Western India; in Burma, already by Pyu times (7th cent. A.D.), it was constructed above ground. The large Pagan kfi, 'temple', evolved naturally from the vaulted chapels of Sri Ksetra147. Small models of most types of Pagan architecture can be found there: the simple Cella-Shrine; the Four-faced Shrine; Shrine and Corridor; Shrine and Hall; Shrine, Corridor and Hall. Few of the metaphysical connotations of the word guha in Indian Mahdydnism seem to enter into the Burmese ku. Its main purpose was to enshrine the Buddha image'48. Until the Buddha is enshrined within, it is nothing but a shell. He is the Purha - the centre of the idea, as of the design, the whole temple standing like a crown about him. For monk as he is, he is also, in Mahdydnist mysticism, the supreme king, and is often shown as such, not only in PM1a art, but also in that of Burma and Siam. By a natural anthropomorphy the temple itself was simply 'the Holy One'. The Buddha image, of course, came late into Indian iconography; but once come, it slowly revolu- tionized the old symbolic art. Already at Mathurd niches for images invaded the base of the stupas 49. The same is seen in Burma in relief-carvings on Sri Ksetra relic-chambers'50. Enlarge the niche, or the 146 Note that glazed sandstone tiles had also been reported, as early as I906-07, at Htilominlo temple: - "In place of terracotta tiles, it is decorated with pieces of sandstone glazed in a green colour.

BUDDHA IMAGE151 The central Buddha or Buddhas are generally of brick, colossal, measured by cubits. They mostly sit touching Earth, cross-legged in padmdsana, both soles showing; but a good many of the older ones sit with right leg on left, as is normal at Sri Ksetra. They sit on thrones equally colossal, indented and recessed. The word for 'throne' (Old Burm. panlai) is derived from the Indian word meaning 'cross- legged'152. The throne was gilded, and over it was a gold umbrella (Old Burm. tNi)'53; sometimes it was decorated with golden 'sun-gods"54. It was rich with pockets for glazed colourwork or jewels, lions, three-headed elephants, or praying deities155. Behind the throne is usually a large brick screen or, "jewelled reredos'"56, plain or painted with the Bodhi tree, which arches almost to the roof. The image itself is held upright by a vertical wooden post which passes down the centre of the torso. At neck-level, a horizontal stone 'plank', fixed in the wall or screen against which the image sits, is perforated to admit the post rising to the forehead, and projects to a bevelled end to form the chin15. The cores of timber and stone, thus locked, are bodied out with carved bricks, rarely glazed at the surface, usually faced with painted stucco. The method is clever but unsound. The wood rots. Treasure-hunters rummage in the torso. The head-bricks slip and fall. And soon a fine interior is disfigured by a headless disemboweled image. The image usually presents the last Buddha, Gotama; but when there are four back to back, they may be the four Buddhas of the present kalpa: Kakusandha (N. ?), Konagamana (E.), Kassapa Dasabala (S.), and Gotama (W.). In five-faced temples the fifth, of course, is the coming Buddha, Maitreya. In four-faced ones, sometimes four principal scenes of Gotama's life are shown: the Enlight- enment (Touching of Earth) usually in the front; the Parinirvdna at the back; and on the other sides perhaps the Nativity, the Twin Miracles or the First Sermon.'58 INTERIOR The interior of the kih varied in shape considerably. The core might be a solid pier, four-sided, with the four Buddhas seated or standing, back to back, against or within its four faces, with single or 151 Old Mon kyak, kyek. Pyu bd: hra (I.B., PI.

Such a symmetric temple, found already at gri Ksetra'59, was called in Mon kydk pan, 'the Four Buddhas', or in Old Burmese liy-rnyak-nhd, 'the Four Faces'"60. Or again, the core might be a hollow cell containing the image, the four walls groining in four pendentives to a peak, like petals meeting above the Buddha's head. About this shrine'61, there might or might not be a corridor. The Mon, who affected dim religious light, usually had the corridor; the Burman, who loved brightness and air, dispensed with it. The Mons at first, like the Orissans'62, would have a hall or antechamber (Sanskrit mandapa) on one side of the main square block (the temple proper), its inner archwayl3 elaborately embossed and guarded, serving as the real door of the temple. With the Burman builders this grandiose inner archway tends to disappear, and hall and shrine finally to merge in a single nave leading to the image'84. Walls and vaults alike were plastered, coated with a hard smooth surface, and painted with countless figures and designs. In our (Mon) period the rough-cast roofs were not properly watertight: so the ceiling-paintings of temples treated in this book are nearly all lost or damaged, as well as those on the upper parts of the corridor-walls. Those that survive are often saved by the projecting cornice or corbels above them. The Burmans, learning from Mon mis- takes, greatly improved the quality and drainage of roofs: with the result that many of their ceilings are in beautiful preservation even today. PAINTINGS Vaults are usually ringed with innumerable golden 'sun-gods'165, each normally enshrining a seated Buddha'6 . The soffit-peak of the shrine may show a Lotus Lake187, symbol of Creation and Brahmd; that of the hall may hold the sacred Footprints168, with their io8 auspicious signs169. All around in floral mazes may be shown the i6 (or 20) worlds of Brahmds and the 6 worlds of Devas 170.Below these, there may be rows of panels showing the 28 Buddhas, from Tanhafikara onwards, each under his proper bodhi tree, with the future Gotama in his earlier births paying them reverence71. The'frieze' below will show loops of pearl suspended from the mouths of kfrtimukhas, or a line of dangled peepal leaves or birds. The main panels on the walls are mostly reserved for the life of Gotama, not only the Eight Scenes, but also his journeys, interviews, Lents, sermons, miracles, conversions. In the earlier pagodas, before Tipitaka texts arrived from Ceylon and were translated, there was little but Jdtakas for the Pagan artist to illustrated'; and these remain a constant source throughout 15r9 ir Ksetra Lemyet-hna shrine.

In all, but especially in the last ten Mahdnipata Jdtaka, there was ample field for narrative. And the Pagan artist, if he had little dramatic sense, was a good storyteller. His first medium was the terracotta plaque. This taught him to reduce his theme to minimal proportions. When the vast wealth of the Tipitaka, and the acres of wall-space in the large temples, were at his disposal, he must have been embarrassed by his riches. He started, in the Pghto-thamya, by illustrating seriatim all the ecclesiastical offences of the Vinaya, and all the Suttas of the Dfgha and Majjhima Nikaya. In the Nagayon he added a selection from the Sainyutta, in the Alopyi? temple from the Aitguttara Nikhya. From the Khuddaka Nikdya, apart from the Jataka, both Mon and Burman artists chose stories from the Vimdna Vatthu73, the 'Mansions of the Blest'. But apart from the ink glosses below their panels, there is rarely anything to distinguish one theme from another. However, their pleasant colouring filled space, especially in the high vaults or the awkward pockets between the carved niches and the windows. And so, it seems, a division of labour was arranged between the journeymen painters who, with extraordinary speed174 (like the lacquer-workers today), could cover a wall with conven- tional sutta-paintings, and the few master-artists who designed the large main panels at eye-level. Even these could hardly cope with their enormous areas, 7 to I2 ft. broad175; and usually filled the sides and lower tiers of their paintings with dull rows of ordinary worshippers. Kyanzittha's son, Rajakumdr, was a great scholar, to whom the Singhalese Mahdvamsa came as a new source of inspiration. In his temple, Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi (III3 A.D.), the panels are generally smaller; and fresh and freehand painting is the rule, not the exception. Here, for the first time in Paga'n, the later history of the Religion is portrayed176: the three Councils, life of Agoka, coming of Mahinda and Safighamittd to Ceylon, king Devdnampiyatissa, the wars of Dutthagdmani, kings Ussabho, Saighabodhi and Buddhadds, and finally Aniruddha's friend, Vijayabdhu, who died just about the time when this temple was built. I doubt if much can be made of the paintings as they are now; but the subjects are certainly there. The later Burmese painters also generally preferred small panels to big. The long side-walls of the hall-shrine of Wet-kyi-in Kubyauk-gyi - the walls half-ruined by Thomann - were a fine specimen of their work. Fortunately his book contains photographs of the two walls'77 before he savaged them. Below the high and broad-arched ceiling with its Footprints and great bellying squares of kyaktahuiy, 173 The Vimdna vatthu is illustrated in the Myinkaba Kubyaukgyi and the Alopyi' ('Mon' temples), and also in Gu 338 of the Winido group. For the Burmese glosses in this last temple, see S.I.P., pp. 148-155. 174 From I.B., PI. I 105 a, lines 6 to 8 (598 S./1237 A.D.), it would appear that the painting of one kii, including 14,6i9 pictures of the Buddha and the 550 Jatakas, took only three or four days to complete. 175 7 to 8 ft. is the normal breadth of the main panels in Nagayon, but i i ft. 9 in. panels occur in the N.corridor. The height may be about 4 ft., but the tops of these panels are mostly lost. Much the broadest panels are generally those showing the Assault and Retreat of Mara's army, often placed on the back inner wall, on either side of the main Buddha-recess. 176 Especially on the S. wall of the entrance to the Shrine; but in several other places also. The Burma Historical Commission Bulletin Vol. II (pp. 277-4I5) is a monograph on the paintings and glosses in this temple.

At each corner these rest on two tiers of two panels equally tall, 8 on each wall. Those of the N. wall portray the Sattatthana, the Seven Sites near the Bodhi tree, where the Buddha spent the first seven weeks after his Enlighten- ment (4 of the panels remain). The S. wall very likely showed 8 scenes from the rest of his life (only 2, the Dhanapdla Elephant and Drona's division of the Relics, remain). What still survives is lovely and unusual. Between these corner-panels, were some 537 panels (each measuring 51 x 61 in.), picturing all the Jdtakas except the Mahdnipdta (of these 537 panels, only 228 remain). To impress on the spectator what all these birth-stories lead up to, there was a large panel of the Preaching Buddha in the centre of each face (both now are lost). The colour of the walls is still fresh and lovely. Certain paintings, including some of the best, stand out as different from the others: - the faint Vaisnava paintings in Nathlaung-gyaung; the Hindu tondoes and Mahdydnist panels of the Ascent to Buddhahood in Abeyadana, including a number of Thntric panels of horrific type; and some temples, mostly at Minnanthu, built near the end of the dynasty, suggestive of a rather more erotic school of Tdntrism'78. These are exceptional. Nine-tenths (I guess) of all the paintings of Pagan are Theravdda. Many, perhaps a quarter, have glosses below them, in Mon, Burmese or Pali, fixing the scene. There was obviously close cooperation between painter, sculptor and architect. At first the sculptor was dominant, pocketing the walls with niches for images. The painter was called in to frame and crown these with patterns of receding roofs and stupa-finials, and to fill the spandrels with flying Devas or Gandharvas, offering lotus or music to the Buddha in the niche'79. Each window, arch and corner was enriched with appropriate facings, each wall-face bound or looped with friezes, each pen- dentive banded at the groins right up to the painted boss. Floral and geometric patterns are endless in variety and charm'80. As for the technique and materials used in these paintings, U Mya has written as follows'8': "As far as I have been able to ascertain, 'fresco' in its true sense is totally unknown in Burma, and such a term cannot possibly be applied to the mural paintings of the Abeyadana and Kubyauk-gyi temples. The paintings were executed on a plaster surface which had been probably allowed to dry. The colours used were few; they were mainly black, white, yellow, red, blue and green. The latter two colours are rare. For adhesive purposes gum obtained from nim trees" [Melia indica] "was used, but it is said that for black colour for that purpose gall of a certain kind of fish was much preferable. It was mixed with lamp-black to obtain the necessary colour and adhesive quality. That is to say, the pigments were mixed with water and a binding substance and used; and accordingly, the work can in no sense be called frescoes, but tempera paintings." EXTERIOR Outside, the kfi was crowned, either with a 'bell' tapering to its ringed finial like the spire of a cetf; or else with a square bulging pyramidal gikhara of North Indian type (usually minus the dmalaka), 178 e.g. Payath6nzu, Nandaminya, North Kathapa Gu 289, Maung Yoi' Ku (No. ii), all at Minnanthu.

Similar small Sikharas or bell-pagodas'83 may crown the upper corners or the lower centres. All cubic masses are framed with corner-pilasters, beautifully moulded with up-and-down-turned Vs and a diamond between. Pilasters also empanel the large surfaces between the windows. Ground- plinth and terraces will have long lines of pockets in their waists, often holding glazed tiles or Jdtaka- carvings. Kfrtimukha demon-masks, disgorging loops of pearls, supply the stucco 'frieze' below the crenellated cornice. KTrtimukhas often reappear at top or bottom of the 'V' pilasters, or again below the bell-band of the anda. Inverted V's or (rarely) fig-leaf and bulb, or a long gaggle of wild geese (hamsa) 84, will supply the dado. CLEC TORIN The most striking feature of exterior ornament is the Arch-facade'85, especially its upper part, the pediment or fronton186, which encloses singly (P1. 394 c), doubly (P1. 394 b), or trebly (P1. 393 a), almost every door, archway and window, When double, the upper fronton and pilasters which support it, simply enclose the lower. When treble'87, these are further buttressed at the sides by two half- frontons and pilasters, lower and recessed. In the middle centuries of the first millenium A.D., the Mon clec must have evolved out of the Indian torana. The latter, at the Great Stupa of Siici (ist cent. B.C.), was the gateway through the stone railing. Its triple architraves are horizontal, modelled from wooden beams; but their ends are ringed with volutes, and the centre span is already lifting to the arch. In the middle of the top architrave of the South torana'88, which is the oldest, stands a female figure on a full blown lotus, with elephants to left and right pouring water over her head. Originally, it seems, a fertility-emblem, this scene has come to represent, in Buddhism, Mahamaya's Bath, previous to the conception and birth of the future Buddha. As such, late in the Ist century B.C., it figures again on the tympanum at the entrance to the caitya-cave at Mdnmoda hill, Junndr189, north of Poona. Earlier, about IOO B.C., it reappears on a tympanum-doorway at the Jaina cave, Anantagumpha, at Khandagiri in Orissa; where Coom- araswamy wonders if it may stand for the birth of Mahdvira'90. But soon the figure becomes identified with 8ri or Laksmi, wife of Visnu; and as such, passes into Old Mon as kyak sr'I91, 'the goddess Sri', 182 See, e.g., P1. 268. 183 Old Burm. mwaim khoin (I.B., P1.

In Kyanzittha's palace inscription she keeps her place in the top-centre of the arch-pediment'93, though her elephants in Pagan temples have all passed into floral arabesques194. Some of the finest are seen on the window- exteriors of Nan-paya (PIs. I22-I24). At Mathurd (ist cent. A.D.) the torana sometimes detaches itself, and arches to form a two-sided tympanum; and the ends between the ribs or architraves have turned into makaras, spouting in- wards'95. Makaras at the shoulders of doorway-arches appear first in the Udayagiri Buddhist caves, Orissa: they all face inwards'96. They still face inwards on the makara-torana lintel at Bijdpur, c. IIOO A.D.197. In Burma, the takara was well-known at grl Ksetra, especially as the top member of the trio, makara/vydla/elephant, composing the reredos of the Buddha. Here they spout outwards'98. At Pagan where the makara tends to pass into architecture behind the Buddha's throne, it is seen every- where, usually in 'horns' facing outwards, at the sides of pediments. But the 'horns' once established as a convention, the makara head was free to revert to its original direction, spouting inwards (e.g. PI. 247 C, e, f). At first, in the 'Mon' sub-period, the clec still tended to look wooden, stepped, and horizontal (PI. I24). Later, as one passes into the Burmese period, verticals are superimposed on horizontals (PI. 339), and finally supplant them (PI. 394 a, b, c). The acroteria or spines upon the backs of the makaras build up a triangle of leaf and bud, that breaks free near the top, like flames licking up the walls (Pls. 39I, 393). The clec has returned in style to wood, but to wood-carving. Seen in all its floral and animal detail, as one can still see hints of it on ruined shrines and monasteries at Minnanthu and Pwazaw'99, heightened by sheathing of coloured glazes, green or yellow, the effect must once have been dazzlingly alive. It is also seen in paintings in dozens of interiors. On the larger temples most of the brick and plaster specimens are now killed by whitewash. Perhaps the finest effects were once visible in wood. Kyanzittha's abkiseka-pavilion had 28 clec200. They were numerous too on all sides of his palace: see supra, p. 67, for translation of a contemporary description of them201. Note, finally, that kit were sometimes built near graves, by wives in memory of their husbands202. KLON, KULA KLON The Mon word for Monastery, pea, is Indian (Old Mon bihar).

Even the brick monasteries (Old Burm. kuha kloM 'Indian monasteries') that survive, vary considerably204; the native wooden types, which have all perished, were perhaps more varied still. In ancient India, says Sir John Marshall205, "wherever important stupas... were erected, monas- teries were also provided for the accommodation of the monks or nuns residing on the spot, and chapels or caitya-halls in which they could assemble for their devotions. The monasteries, as might be expected, were designed on the same plan as private houses: that is, with an open square courtyard in the centre, surrounded on the four sides by a range of cells. Perhaps the earliest existing example of such a monas- tery is one by the side of Piprdhwd stupa" [in Nepal, Maurya period]. ".. . -As a rule, however, the early architects built their structural monasteries and caitya halls either wholly of wood, or with a superstructure of wood set on a stylobate of stone." Some of the big monastic colleges at Pagan were similar206: a two-storeyed east facade of brick, with projecting hall; staircases on the corners; lines of brick cells along each side, with square-arched windows and pointed niches; passages between; the central yard (as shown by rows of stone 'plates'207 for posts to stand on) filled with a wooden structure of two storeys; in the centre of the west side, set back, the main shrines rising to two storeys, the lower one with square pradaksina corridor running round it. Of the many types of brick monastery extant at Pagan, the simplest208 is a plain flat-roofed cube, pierced with square-arched entrances at the lower corners, and above only with carved stone gargoyles, and either square stone slabs fretted in quatrefoil, or brick mullions and bars forming perforated windows. Inside, a four-sided vaulted corridor connects the doorways, and leaves a central pier con- taining a dark celia, doubtless the shrine. Within the thickness ('thinness' would be a truer term) of the outer walls, a narrow staircase may lead to an upper storey, similarly arranged. Holes may sometimes be seen for beams or bamboo poles crossing the vault of the corridor, where the monks might make a loft for sleeping, against small ventilation-holes or stone windows. But roofs were rarely water-tight, and the walls were too thin; and though sometimes slightly abattered, they had no but- tresses to take the outward thrust of the vault. So these monasteries are always found more or less in ruin. Outside, in the centre of the main facade, flanked by the entrance-archways, there is often a tall shallow arched recess for a standing image. In front of this, there will be a platform with rows of stone plates for wooden uprights, and high gaping square holes for beams in the brick facade to corres- pond. Here there was once a wooden "front-extension",209 with nave and aisles and gabled roof. The 204 See W. B. Sinclair, "Monasteries of Pagan," J.B.R.S. Vol. X, Part I, pp. I-4 (both Anniversary Publ.

To break the severity of the plain cube, large central bays may project from the outer walls of the corridor, emphasized without, maybe, by clec torin over false doors. The roof may be crowned with a central storeyed clec shrine and corner turrets, each with lines tapering above, battered below. Such a monastery, of which specimens may be seen at Dayin-pahto2ll north-east of Minnanthu, may be the kzdd kloN calac of the inscriptions2"2, or "the high monastery"213, probably reserved for the chief monk.214. The outer walls of the corridor on both storeys may be flanked with cells on three sides, leaving a long high-vaulted hall on the fourth215. In the larger monastery-groups, at T'mani216, Pwazaw, Minnanthu and Wet-kyi-in, one finds the greatest variety of internal arrangement, some intended, it would seem, mainly for devotional use, others rather for educational. Schools are often mentioned in the inscriptions217; and some of these buildings would accommodate large numbers. One vaulted hall at LUmyet-hna, Minnanthu218, measures 44 X 20 ft.; and it is set at right angles to another measuring 40 X I5 ft., with a mezzanine corridor crossing the haunches between the vaults, and leading to a third storey and the roof. The internal brick walls were plastered and finished, says Sinclair, "with very plain frescoes, con- sisting chiefly of black and gold lines cutting the wall surface up into panels, and marking the cornices and skirting lines, and picking out the niches with ogee-shaped arch-heads. The whole effect was most refined and well lighted." "As for the kuld klon," reads one inscription1, "he painted with orpi- ment, vermilion, etc, all the posts, walls, cross-beams, wall-plates, rafters and roofs, and applied gold kyaktanhuiy ('sun-gods'?). As for the ceiling above, he made it splendid with gold lotuses." Such a monastery was called k/NA prok, 'variegated monastery'220. PRASAT ('PYATTHAT') The Indian prdsada - a palatial building Qr pavilion with multiple roofs - has had a long and notable posterity in Mon and Burmese architecture, both civil and religious. The Modern Burmese word, 210 Pict. Guide. . ., p. 69, shows merely one part of one side of the clec with the wall of the brick monastery behind it (Hsutaungbyi, West Pwazaw). 211 Sinclair's article, P1. 2, "Monastery at Dayinpato". 212 I.B., PI.

The date of this remarkable monastery of Anantasfira (see I.B., P1. I 731) should be 585 S./I223 A.D. I have only found two earlier mentions of kuld kloh: PI. I 487, 582 S./1220 A.D., and P1. I 646, 585 s./1223 A.D. One might therefore be tempted to confine this type of building to the Burmese sub-period; but, on reflection, it is obvious that Anantasi's kula kloh has a long history of evolution behind it, going back to the early days of Pagan. A Shwezig6n inscription dated 603 S./124i A.D. (I.B. P1. 13924) mentions a dedication to "the old Zig6n (Cankkut) monastery." - Was this the kuldkloh a hundred yards south of the pagoda, shown on our P1. I83 ? 219 I.B., PI.

Carved and painted illustrations of prdsdda are still to be seen in plenty in the temples of Pagan221; in stone, for instance, in the five-roofed, seven- roofed, and nine-roofed palaces of Prince Siddhattha in the Nanda (PI. 284 a, b, c). It would seem that the form has not changed much. It was doubtless built mostly in wood, but also in brick. In the earlier Mon wooden architecture, the 'fivefold pavilion' (panicaprdsdt) of Kyanzittha's abhiseka, with its 28 clec pediments222, has been mentioned already; also the ablution-pavilion (prdsat birlkp) of his new palace, and the five pavilions (prdsdt jnok and four prdsdt cindrow), built (one imagines) in the form of a quincunx223. In Burmese inscriptions the word occurs frequently224, especially in connection with Buddhist monasteries. Such phrases as prasat calac Zi-thwak225, prasat tuluik calac zT-thwak226, "front-extensions with pediments and a hall (tuluik) with multiple roofs", might refer to the wooden front rather than the brick monastery itself. But the huge brick temple started by king Klacwcd in I248 A.D., was, and still is, called 'the Great Prasdda' (Pyatthada-gyi)227. Its lower storey has all the appearance of a kit. Above, there were terraces with corner-stupas, and perhaps a small upper storey; but as the building is unfinished and in ruin, one cannot speak for certain of its roofing. SIM ('THEIN') Of the other buildings, the most important was the theni' or chapter-house. It should also, perhaps, be the easiest to identify, for it was often determined by stone boundary posts228 or 'limits' (Sanskrit/ Pali ssmd), from which it takes its name. The word is often translated 'ordination hall': and it was used for that purpose. But it was also regularly used as the uposathdgdra or chapter-house, for the recitation of the Pdtimokkha, where, as a Burmese inscription says, 'the lords of the Saiighei might confess their sins beginning with dpattukat'229. The inscription is at the Hsutaungbyi pagoda, West Pwazaw, where a low brick platform paved with stone, in the south-east corner of the inner enclosure, may mark the site. In any big revival or reform of the Buddhist Church in Burma, the erection of a 'permanent sTmd' (Old Mon baddhasim), carefully constructed according to the rules of the Vinaya, and so fit for the conferring of valid ordination, was a sine qua non. At Pegu, in I477 A.D., when the Mon ex-monk, king Rdmadhipati (Dhammazedi), reformed the church of Lower Burma in cooperation with the Mahdvihdra of Ceylon, the erection of the Kalydnf STmd is described, both in Pali and Mon. with 221 For a painted 'pyatthat', see e.g. A.S.I.

At Thaton, before its conquest by Aniruddha, perhaps after the Buddhist victory over gaivism, an earlier Kalydn! baddhasim was erected south of Shw6zayan pagoda. It is still marked by stone pillars finely carved with the Ten Great Jdtakas, and more than one fragmentary stone inscription231. Another undated Old Mon inscription232, still in sitt at the north-west end of Kyaukse Hill, records the erection of a baddhasim there, when a Mon archbishopric was created, it appears, for the numerous Mons of Kyaukse, with the permission of the archbishop (mahather) of Pagan (Shin Arahan?) and of the king (Kyanzittha?). The oldest-mentioned building at Paga'n itself was a theni' built by Caw Rahan on top of Mt. Turait (Tuywin-daung), which (the inscription tells us) was repaired by two ladies of the court in I2I2 A.D.233. A theni' always contained an image of the Buddha. It was attached to a monastery, pagoda or temple in the neighbourhood234. On the north side of the road from Pagan to Nyaung-u, opposite the mouth of the lane leading to Htilominlo, there is a rectangular building, with narrow arches of entrance abnormally placed in the centre of the two longer sides. It is called the UPALI THEIN235. There is no inscription; but possibly, in its original form, it may go back to the Pagan period236. The vaulting is old; also the perforated stone ventilation-slabs set in the walls on each side of the entrances. But almost everything else about it - the roof-battlements, stucco-work, archways, enclosure-wall and painting - belongs to a much later date, and is of little help in fixing the form of the old Pagan samun. The paintings, which Duroiselle dates "late I7th or early i8th century", are staringly bright and theatrical, lacking the deep peace of Buddhist art at its meridian. LIBRARY There is one mention of a library (catuik)237. Copies of the Tipitaka, in 'golden coffers' (rhuy tala), were housed in brick monasteries238 or else in 'golden temples' (rhuy kij)239.

The Glass Palace Chronicle (transl. pp. I55-6) mentions an elder, Siha-maha-upali, whom the former king invited to Pagan, and for whom the latter built a monastery at Sagu in 597 S./1235 A.D.

TIPITAKA Sets or parts of the Tipitaka are frequently mentioned in the inscriptions. In 171 A.D. a district headman (tuik sfikri) at Sagaing dedicated land for the upkeep of the Pitaka "made by my son Anu- dhe"241. In II97 A.D a whole set was dedicated at Sunye, Kyaukse242. In I207 A.D., four years before his accession, a set was dedicated at Pagan by Ndtofnmyd243. In I223 A.D. Anantasfira included a full set in his dedication at Minnanthu244. Elsewhere we read of "26 books" (klyam) of the Pitaka being dedicated245. Another Pagan dedication246 includes the making of "the Silakhandhavd, at the beginning of the Pitaka247, one book (klam); the Abhidha*masanginn248, one book; the Ten Jdtakas (tassa jat)249, one book; the Dha*mapada250, one book; the Wine I (Vinaya), one 'heap' (pUM)"251. Another mentions the building of a 'golden cave' (rhuy kut), and giving of "three books at the beginning of the Pitaka"252. DHAMMASA, TRYA IM 'Halls of the Law' (Pali dhammasdla)253, or 'Houses of the Law' (Burm. tryd ijM)254 - the probable Burmese equivalent, are mentioned frequently from the first.

Anantasfira's inscription mentions "a peaceful Hall of the Law, built of stone bricks, where all the congregation may assemble to listen to the Law, with a golden throne for the preaching of the Law, and a gold umbrella over it, and thereabove a canopy (pitdn)"255. TANCHOII, CARAP, KAPPIYAKUTIY "Outside the monastery," says the same inscription, "within a fine enclosure-wall, I built a large and pleasant 'tazaung' (tanchoit) magnificent with all manner of figures, where pious people coming from the four quarters may be at liberty to stay or sleep or stand. Behind it also I built a 'zayat' (carap), of solid brick, where pious people, wishing to give alms, may give their alms. At the entering- in of the capital also I made a storehouse (kappiyak.tiy), built solidly of brick, for the comfort of the Three Gems in this my monastery; and I have left there also many attendants"256. 'Tazaung' is a Burmese word for buildings with roofs like chandeliers (Old Burm. tanchoit) 257. This dissyllabic word seems to be composed on the Mon model, possibly from Old Mon coil 'to burn, to light a lamp', with infix and reduplication. Carap258 is a Mon word (Old Mon jrap259); it is now used for a rest-house. It seems that 'zayat' and 'tazaung' have interchanged their old meanings in modern parlance. But tanchoiz was used for more purposes than one. When king Klacwda in I249 issued his edict against thieves, he ordered that "those who set up the inscription-pillar, should construct a screen against the sun (?), and build a tanchoft (to set it up in), with a nice big ceiling (pitan)"280. A kappiyakutiy, one reads elsewhere more than once, was used "to house objects of dedication'"261. TANKUP There are mentions of satan tahkUp2f2, sheds where laymen might come and observe Buddhist fast- days (satan niy'), doubtless near a monastery or pagoda. TUIK, 'enclosures, walled buildings', sometimes "of burnt brick"263, included libraries (cd tuik264, pitakat tuik), schools (ca san tuik) 265, and buildings where monks might "eat areca-nut" (kwa* cd tUik)266. RIY-IM, 'water-houses', i.e. latrines, are mentioned267. 255 I.B., P1.

III 24711 (mentioned between klon kyf and kappiyakutiy), and P1. III 27I37 (tanchon kyr mentioned before ca san tuik). The same word (perhaps pronounced in a different tone) has other meanings which I do not understand: see I.B., P1. I 235, 7311, 8o14-15; III 3io b7 10-12; IV 37211."

Two grand, but broken, stone pillars, finely carved in 'Mon' style (Pls. 379, 380), still stand near the south-west corner of the city wall. If they originally upheld, as tradition says, the great bell of the neighbouring Thatbyinnyu temple, the bell must have been a very large one. KAN, RIY TWAN, TANTHAH, etc. The digging of tanks or reservoirs (kan)269 and wells (niy twaA)270, and the making of causeways or bridges (tanthah)271 near monasteries, are often mentioned. The fullest account of tanks is that given by Anantasiira of the 'Square Tank' (liy thoW kan, Lddaunggan as it is still called today), east of his dedication at Minnanthu (I223 A.D.): - "I also dug a square tank, built entirely of brick. To the east of this I dug two big tanks at [higher] levels; and in order that the water might enter, I made it beauti- ful with pipes (piwan) and basons (tlad). And all around the tanks I planted a garden (uydn)"272. Before the last World War, the old wooden pipes were still visible. The wells dug by Anantasfira were "permanent ones, of brick"273. There is mention of a porch (chaiwai, where 'the elephant enters')274; also of a wooden outhouse (kand prahi)275. An architectural term in connection with pagodas which baffles me at present, is samaruiw, sa*Mruiw276. This well-nigh completes the list of religious buildings and major objects of dedication found in Pagan inscriptions. As for the king's palace, it has been discussed at length in Chapter IV. UMAN After the end of the dynasty, 'devious' caves (Old Burm. umah, from Pali ummagga, ummaitga), excavated in the sandstone cliffs and hillocks around Nyaung-u277, become increasingly common. There are still monks who dig them today, as a work of merit. One 'umait at least, the main storey of Kyauk-ku Onhmin, with its magnificent facade of carved stone on brick, must go back to the early days of the dynasty (Pls. I32-I42). Another umaA, S.W. of Shw6zigon, which contains paintings dating from the Mongol conquest of Paga'n at the end of the 13th century278, is now called 'Kyanzittha's Onhmin.2 It has been suggested above (see Chapter IV, n. io6) that it may well have been the rajas- thdn Jeyabhfim of Kyanzittha's palace-inscription, a temporary palace near his work of merit, occu- pied by the king while his new palace was being built within the walls of Pagan. 268 I.B., P1.

DATING OF STUPAS The dating of solid stupas is more hazardous than the dating of temples. There is less evidence in the building itself to go on. Rarely is there any old record in ink or stone inscription. They are often small and ruinous, or (what is worse) 'repaired'. Their history is either forgotten or fabulous. And the practice of building them is so old, the lines of development so various, and the achieved shapes so different, that the range of possibility seems infinite. In I9I2, when I first came to Burma, archaeologists were excited about the excavations at gri Ksetra. The great 7th century stupas there - Bawbaw-gyi, Paya-gyi and Paya-mal - were obviously, in origin, tall and cylindrical, with (probably) a flat cone on top. They were no less different from the hemispheres of SUMci than from the tapering 'bells' of Shw6dag n and other pagodas of modern Burma. I noticed that the Paya-gyi and Paya-ma were less cylindrical than the Bawbaw-gyi, and more sprawl- ing at the base. What they had lost at the shoulder, they had added at the foot. Hearing that it was the custom of Burmans, when repairing an old pagoda, just to encase the ruin as it lay, I jumped to the conclusion that the present spread at the base was not buried terraces, but just debris from the shoulders. The theory seemed to explain the whole history of the stupa in Burma - from the pure convex of the original 'egg', to the pretty concave bell-shapes of today. An Indian pandit confirmed my view by assuring me that the bell-shaped stupa was quite unknown in India. The theory worked until I926-28, when two big mounds at Thaungby6gon, gri Ksetra, were excavated, and found to contain - almost as fresh as new - two very modern-looking 'bell'-pagodas2. - The 'bell' pagoda, alas, was just as old as the cylindrical! STUPAS BEFORE ANIRUDDHA We must feel our way more cautiously. The high-cylindrical Bawbaw-gyi has but a single stairway on the north, leading to the round platform3. Above this, there are only two round narrow terraces - 1 See A. SI. 1i9io, P1. XLV I, 2, 3. 2 See A.S.B. 1926, PIs. I, II; A.S.I. 1928, P1. LVI b and p. 133. 3 A.S.B. 1924, PIs. I, and II and pp. 23-25. '7</page><page sequence="276">258 Chapter XIII mere buttresses to the mass above them. Such high-cylindrical stupas with round buttress-terraces are old. Possibly they derive from those of Amardvati in the Deccan. PI. 76 a shows a tall ruin, probably of this type, about a hundred yards south of Shwe-gwincha pagoda, Taungbi, N.E. of Paga'n. BU-PAYA Another type, with round terraces more prominent and decorated, and the anda bulbous rather than high cylindrical, is seen in the BU-PAYA (PI. 75 a)4. It stands small, but solid and prominent, above the riverbank at the N.W. corner of the walls of Paga'n, where in the past there has been maxi- mum erosion. Only the bulbous part is really old; this, and possibly the circular terracing, relate it to the 7th century stupas of irl Ksetra. Another bulbous stupa within the walls (PI. 76 b, c, d), stands a few yards N.W. of Mimalaung-kyaung, on the E. side of the road to Thiripyitsaya. Three miles south, on the W. side of the same road, N.NE. of Thiripyitsaya village, is a row of four bulbous stupas (P1. 77), ruinous, but still about 35 ft. high. This bulbous type is not confined to Paga'n. It is widespread in Upper and Lower Burma. It is typical of the Tibetan chorten. In India, it goes back to the later cave-temples, Kanheri (Cave ii, 3rd cent. A.D.), Ajantd (Caves XIX and XXVI, 6th-7th cent.), and Elfird (Cave X, 8th cent.)5. Pyu refugees from Sri Ksetra, who are said in the Chronicles6 to have settled at Pagan, in the middle of the 8th century, before the coming of the Mranma-, may have built the Bu-paya, and also stupas around Thiripyitsava, the old port of Pagan. WVe shall find evidence at West Hpet-leik also, of pagoda- building much older than Aniruddha's. NGA-KYWt-NA-DAUNG The largest and most striking of these bulbous pagodas is the Nga-kywe-nadaung (P1. 75 b, c). It stands N. of Nat-hlaung-gyaung, W. of Thatbyinnyu, in the southern part of the old city. Even in ruin 44 ft. high, and 8z ft. in circumference, it is splendidly encased in glazed tiles of iridescent hues. In I904-5 Sir John Marshall recommended it for conservation: "Covered with green glazed tiles, it is of an elongated bulbous shape, which bespeaks its great antiquity"7. Taw Sein Ko added some re- markable statements: - "It is like an empty egg-shell"8; "crowned by a small chamber which is now roofless"9; "the oldest of the shrines" of Pagan, "crowned with what looks like a small domed chapel, thereby bespeaking its Chinese origin"10. In I907 he repeats his claim that the stupa is Chinese in origin'1; but this appears to conflict with his other statement that it is "one of the five pagodas built 4Bu-paya. "Built by Pyusawdi, the third king of Paga'n, who reigned in i68-243 A.D." (Taw Sein Ko, A.S.B. 1905, p. 23, item 6). I do not find this attribution in the Chronicles. "The Bu Paya is much later than those at Prome, and only a copy of the latter" (Duroiselle, A.S.I. 1924, p. 82 fn.) 5See supra, Chapter XII, note iog. 6 U Kala, Mahayazawingyi, I, pp. 134-5; Hmannan (Susodhita Ed.) I, pp. i89-i90 (translation, G.P.C., pp. 28-29). 7A.S.B. 1905, App. B, p. 25, item 3. Coomaraswamy (H.I.I.A. p. 170) compares it to the Dhamekh stupa at Sarnath. This is hardly bulbous, but consists of two cylinders superposed, stone and brick. Without further exca- vation it is hard to say whether the base of Nga-kywe-na-daung was cylindrical, or a series of round terraces, possibly with spiral stairs. 8A.S.B. i9ii, p. io. 10 A.S.B. 1907, p. 12. 9 A.S.B.

Its name, however, is not in- cluded in the five attributed to that king in the Chronicles13. Taw Sein Ko went to considerable pains and expense in keeping the so-called "sanctum" water-tight14. How worshippers ever succeeded in getting up to and into it, he leaves unexplained. At my request, and some considerable risk to life and limb, Colonel Ba Shin has investigated this 'sanctum' at the top of Nga-kywe-nadaung. His note is given at length in the Catalogue of Plates. The sanctum proves to be no more than "a large pit which, to all appearances, was left by treasure- hunters". As for the date of this solid pagoda, in its original form it was doubtless old. The terrace or terraces at the base were probably circular. But the casing must be much later. The large-scale practice of glazing brick at Pagan hardly appears before Kyanzittha's reign (I084-III3 A.D.)15. STUPAS OF ANIRUDDHA. - MYINKABA ZE]DI (P1. 79 a) Aniruddha's earliest stupa stands on the N. bank of Myinkaba Chaung, where it enters the village of Myinpagan. It is remembered as the site where he recovered the saddle (mrai:ka) of his half- brother, king Sokkat6, after killing him in single combat. "And Sokkate's horse ran away with him to the river, and there he died. The place is known as Myinkaba to this day"16. The small stupa (height 44 ft.) was presumably built shortly after Aniruddha's accession, which the Jatdpu* Rd-javanl7 dates 406 S./1044 A.D. It has a tall double-banded an1a, beginning to flare out at the base. There is no harmika above. The top, seemingly original as far as it goes (the finial is lost), is a heavy cone of slowly tapering chattrdvali, roughly straight in profile. KHABIN MAUNG DI Z1iDI (P1. 79 b) Perhaps his next work of merit was the one now called Maung Di pagoda at Khabin, 7 miles east of Twante in the direction of Rangoon. Khabin (Old Burm. Krapai)18, a small walled and moated eminence set in paddy-fields, preceded Twant619 as the capital of these parts; and was doubtless still the local capital when Aniruddha, on his early expedition to the south (c. I050A.D. ?), occupied it and built this pagoda at San-ywa, half a mile south of it. Modern legend, based on Burmese misinterpretations of the local Old Mon place-names, ascribes it to the poor fisherman, Maung Di, who had to marry a princess who chased him thirty miles or more. But the two upper octagonal terraces of the pagoda, as Duroiselle has proved20, were formerly lined with large terracotta tablets (Pls. 4, 5) signed byAniruddha 12A.S.B. 1905, App. B, p. 25, item 3. 13 U Kala, Mahayazawingyi, I, p. i6o; Hmannan, I, p. 227 (transl.

Their colour appears to be white from a distance, but on looking at close range it is faintly green. The glazed surfaces appear to be of strong texture." 16 G.

These are the largest, simplest, and perhaps earliest, of his votive tablets; and the large pagoda itself (now under repair) may well antedate his capture of Thaton. The lowest terrace, below the two octagonal ones, is of laterite. There are neither corner-stupas nor stairways. Only the lower part of the an1a, including the terraces, can claim to be original. LOKANANDA Lokananda Pagoda, 'Joy of the World' (P1. 92), stands on a bluff just above the Irawady, at the point where it finally turns south towards the sea. It is 3 miles below Pagan, near the village of Thiripyitsaya (SYr Vajra)21. It was the river-port of Pagan for boats coming upstream; at Pagan itself the river is somewhat rocky, and the currents at the bend are strong. According to the Glass Palace Chronicle (p. 9i), the Tooth-Relic duplicate sent by the friendly king of Ceylon was enshrined at the site of Shwezigon pagoda; but at Aniruddha's solemn prayer, replicas of the Tooth 'proceeded', and were placed on the White Elephant. Wherever the elephant knelt, Aniruddha built a pagoda: at the top of Mt. Tankyi across the river; then "at Lokananda where the ship from Ceylon had put in. There he built a cetiya and enshrined it"; then at the top of Mt. Tuywin, etc. Taw Sein Ko, perhaps on manu- script authority (?), dated the building I059 A.D.22. This tall pagoda (height 86 ft.) has an elongated 'bell' resting on three octagonal terraces. There are no corner-stupas; but there are four median flights of steps leading to the middle terrace. There is no harmikd. The top is modernized. See PI. 92 b for the stone Footprint of the Buddha - the oldest at Pagan - found on the stone-paved platform, and now lying in three fragments at Pagan Museum. There are two stone inscriptions still in situ. One, an interesting bilingual inscription in Pali and Burmese, is dated I23I A.D.23. The other mentions a dedication in I207 A.D. to "the monastery of the Cakravartin Anuradhd"; it also mentions the name of the pagoda, Lokanantd24. SHWE-HSAN-DAW Pagoda of 'the Golden Holy Hair' (Pls. 83-87), stands half a mile south of the south-east corner of Pagan city-wall. According to the Glass Palace Chronicle (p. 94)25, Aniruddha "built a 'zigon' pagoda over the sacred Hair-relic presented by the king of Ussd", i.e. Pegu, "and worshipped it. That pagoda he named Mahapeinne (Mahdpinnai:) "26, i.e. Ganega pagoda. Many stone fragments of (apparently) Hindu deities (PI. 84), sometimes placed back to back, once guarded the corners of the terraces. They now lie at the base or corners of the upper terraces. I have not found the elephant-headed god amongst them; but he may have been there originally. Those that one sees remind me rather of the beautiful double-bodied wooden image of Garuda found at Raghurdmpur (Vikramapura), south of Dacca27. 21 lB., P1.

Some of the oldest votive tablets and bronzes of Pagan have been found in its relic-chamber, including several signed by Aniruddha28, or inscribed in Sanskrit/Ndgarl, Pyu, Mon, etc. Taw Sein Ko calls it "the first pagoda built ... after the conquest of Thaton"29. At first sight this great pagoda (I351 ft. high) looks different from the others. The five steep square terraces, with four plain median flights of steps, exalt, but also dwarf, the single-banded bell-like stupa proper, with its two octagonal top-terraces. The explanation lies in the purport of this stupa. Built to enshrine the Hair-relic, it sets out to copy the Cfildmani cetiya of Thvatiihsa, built by Sakka at the top of Mt. Sineru to enshrine the Hairknot cut by Gotama on his first becoming a monk. The five square terraces, therefore, represent the five dlinda of that sacred mountain, guarded by stone Devas. Those Devas, facing outward on guard, inward in worship, sat on gnomon-like projections of stepped brick (copying wooden quoins)30 at the four corners of the upper terraces. There are no corner- stupas. Lions with divided bodies guard the corners at the base. Only the ground plinth, it seems, was utilized to show a limited number (288 ?) of unglazed Jdtaka plaques. These are likely to be the oldest at Pagan. They measure about Iol in. in height, ii in. in breadth, and iw in. in thickness. Till recently we only knew of 5 genuine ones, 3 illustrated by Duroi- selle3l. On a recent visit to Paga'n, Colonel Ba Shin made search at the Museum and found over 20 Shwehsandaw plaques and fragments (I4 almost complete). On Pls. 86 and 87 we show them, almost all. Small and broken as they are, and hard to identify (for there is no writing and little detail to help one, and their original places on the pagoda are not on record), they are not to be despised. They are the work of artists, who could put grace into all their handiwork, even conventional poses. They are almost the earliest extant specimens of Pagan art, and lead direct to the great Hpet-leik series, the finest in Burma. Indeed, some of the Shw6hsandaw artists, I suspect, with acquired skill and exper- ience, went on to do the Hpet-leik. The Shwehsandaw garth is paved with stone and lined with stone umbrellas, altars and almsbowls. The central archways in the sides of the enclosure-wall are mostly in ruin; also the four gandhakuqti, 'perfumed chambers' for images, between the gateways and the stupa. These had clec pediments and small halls with paintings. Some in the south gandhakuti show the 28 Buddhas inscribed with names in post-Aniruddha writing. On the N. side of the east gandhakumti (C on the site-plan, P1. 83 b), there is still in fair preservation yet another small vaulted temple with four doorways and three seated stone images (P1. 85 a). The two set back in the corners against the E. wall are earth-touching Buddhas. The one in the centre is a more-than-lifesize monolith, without reredos, 51 ft. high above its pedestal, 28 Pis. 6 c; I3 a, b; I4 g; 22 a (votive tablets); 428 b, c; 429 a, b, c; 433 d; 44i b, 442 a, b, c; 443 a, b; 444 a, b (bronzes). 29 A.S.B.

This massive-headed Buddha, lacquered and gilded, sits in padmasana, dlydnamudrd. There are several such massive monoliths at Pagan (e.g. at the Dhammardjaka), generally Buddhas seated in dhydnamudra. They cannot, I think, go back to Aniruddha's time; they may be of post-Paga'n date. It is evident that Temple C was no part of Aniruddha's original plan. I suspect that such monolithic images belong to the Early Ava period, when wars and disorder led to the looting of pagodas. SHINBIN-THALYAUNG (P1. 85 b, c) The building marked B on the site-plan is let into the W. wall of the enclosure, south of the W. entrance. It houses a colossal reclining image of the Buddha entering Parinirvana (length 69 ft. 9 in.). This image, also, may not have been part of the original plan; but I suspect it was an after-thought of Aniruddha, perhaps in friendly rivalry with the similar reclining image set up by the captive Mon king at the back of the Manuha temple (Pls. nI, i20). That image is sited, correctly according to the texts, with head to the north. Here it is to the south. If it had been sited correctly to the north (Col. Ba Shin points out to me), the Buddha would have had to turn his back on the Shwehsandaw pagoda. &gt;'EST AND EAST HPET-LEIK, pagodas 'of the curling leaf' (Pls. 94-ii8). These are N.E. of, and near to, the Lokananda, on the south side of the village of Thiripyitsaya. In their present state they look strange. It is due to bad repair-work done in the early days of the Archaeo- logical Department, when engineers rather than archaeologists had the final voice. Both pagodas certainly go back to pre-Aniruddha days; and there are also, I think, post-Aniruddha additions. But the main features of interest belong to his reign, and are due, I imagine, to his personal interest and patronage. Fine 'seals' of Aniruddha (PI. io) have been recovered from the debris; also a fragment of Old Mon inscription32 (PI. 95 e). Some 446 Jdtaka plaques (out of a total of over iioo - there may well be more underground) have been recovered from the site. They are the finest in Burma, unglazed, some still in good, if not excellent, condition. The writing on them - just the Pali name and number of the Jataka, engraved across the top of the plaque - is wonderfully clear and bold, in the early Mon script of Aniruddha's reign. The numbering from Jdtaka 497 onwards differs from normal Singhalese numbering33, as found in Kyanzittha's series at the Nanda. The latter generally agrees with Faus- boll's edition, based on Singhalese manuscripts; and it has remained the norm in Burma ever since II00 A.D. The two Hpet-leik series clearly belong to a similar, but different, recension. The West Hpet-leik was the first to be excavated34. The pagoda had originally a single stairway on the N. side35, leading up to the gikhara-niche in the anda. Here were found embedded a number of large oblong terracotta plaques, with tenons. They measure about 9 to io in. in height, 5 to 51 in. in 32 See supra, Chapter VI, p. 105. 33 The main difference lies in the addition, at this point, of 3 new (? old) Jatakas, viz. Veldma 497, Mahagovinda 498, and Sumedhapandita 499. This brings the total number of Jatakas up to 550, instead of the Singhalese 547. Even today, Burmans still speak of the '550 Jatakas', never (I think) of the '547 Jatakas'. 34 See Taw Sein Ko's 'Excavation Plan,' A. S.L. I907, PI. XLI, reproduced at our PI. 94 b. 35 The East Hpet-leik also had originally a single stairway, but on its W. side. These stairways account for the lesser number of JAtaka-pockets available on these two faces than on the others. Both stairways are still there.</page><page sequence="281">Chapter XIII 263 breadth, and 9 to ii in. in depth, including the tenon. Five or more are still visible in situ, and three more at Paga'n Museum. Archaic in style (P1. 95 b, c, d), they recall one of the chief features of Dvd- ravatI Mon standing Buddhas, as noted by the late Pierre Dupont36, namely that both hands execute the same mudra. They show the Buddha standing with both large hands raised vertical from the elbow in vitarka mudrya, between two tiers of adorants and a top tier of stupas37. These plaques are so different from those of the Jataka series, that one is sure they belong to an older structure, now en- cased in Aniruddha's. "The pagoda, as it stands", said Taw Sein Ko, its first excavator, "appears to have been added to from time to time. At one or two places, where the brickwork of the basement has broken away, mouldings of different patterns and of different periods can be traced beneath"38. The sorry story of 'repairs' is told year by year in the archaeological reports. In I907 Sir John Marshall, wise and enthusiastic, promised a subsidy "to enable the Executive Engineer to excavate completely" both pagodas, and "to conserve both structures on the lines indicated by him"39. In the same year excavations revealed the existence of vaulted corridors or ambulatories at both pagodas40. The corridors are narrow and low, and the roof had fallen in on several sides; but enough remained, and still remains on the E. side of East Hpet-leik, to guide rebuilders, and the cost would not be high; but in the following year, we read, "a sloped terrace-roof of re-inforced concrete was constructed around the [West Hpet-leik] pagoda to afford protection to the tiles"41. Duroiselle took over temporary charge in I9I2, when the East Hpet-leik repairs were in progress. He joined Taw Sein Ko in deciding to "restore the building by reconstructing the ambulatory cor- ridors. . . However, the Executive Engineer, Pakokku Division, suggested, from an economical point of view, roofs of reinforced concrete, as had been done in the case of the West Hpet-leik, thereby spoiling the latter, making it a hybrid building, half of the iith and half of the 2oth centuries, and therefore most ugly"42. Government agreed to Duroiselle's plan, and a rough estimate of only Rs. 6,536 was submitted, covering full repairs to this priceless pagoda. But there were delays; Taw Sein Ko resumed charge; and in I9I5 a revised estimate was approved: "to restore the vaulted corridor on its eastern face; to construct a reinforced concrete roof on the remaining three faces;... and to cover up the reinforced concrete roof with loose brick, so as to detract from it the appearance of modernity"43. Today, after less than half a century, the reinforced concrete roofs are beginning to break down. Fortunately it is not too late nor too difficult to repair our mistakes, abolish the reinforced concrete on both pagodas, rebuild the vaulted corridors on the East Hpet-leik pattern, and in saving two of Burma's principal monuments, to save Burma from ridicule and reproach. 36 L'Archeologie MOne de Dvaravati, Text p. i8i, Plates figs. 373, 397, 404, 42I, 425 to 455, 468 to 470, 5I5, 5i6. 37 Taw Sein Ko thought they represented "Dipafikara. . prophesying that Sumedha and Sumitta, a flower-girl, would respectively become Prince Siddhattha and his wife, Yasodhara" (A.S.I. I907, p. I27; cf. A.S.B. i908, p. i i). - This was certainly a popular motif in Gandharan art: but our plaque has little or nothing in common with the GandhAran versions (see supra, Chapter IX, pp. I54-5). 38 A.S.B. i908, p. ii. He points, also, to the varying breadth of the corridors: 3 ft. 3 in. on the east, 4 ft. on the three other faces. Here my measurements, taken at ground level, do not agree with his: East corridor 3 ft. 8 in.; North 3 ft. io in.; West 3 ft. i i in.; South 3 ft. 9 in. - not very striking differences. The chief discrepancy I noted was at East Hpet-leik, South corridor, which is 4 ft. 4 in. wide at the S.E. corner, and 3 ft. 9 in. at the S.W. 39 A.S.B.

This does not agree with Taw Sein Ko's statement at A.S.B. I9I5, p. II. 43 A.S.B. I915, p. 12.</page><page sequence="282">264 Chapter XIII HPET-LEIK JATAKA-PLAQUES The present order of the Jdtaka plaques on the west pagoda is chaotic. We may be sure that it was not so in Aniruddha's day. In I9I5-i6 it was decided to refix the loose plaques of the East Hpet- leik in their places, and "Maung Pe, Head Burmese Writer, was placed on this duty, which was discharged" says Taw Sein Ko, "satisfactorily"44. Saya Pe, it seems, made the important discovery that "the series begins at the first inner row at the S.E. corner45, and proceeding northward encircles the core, till the second inner row is reached. The process is repeated till the 489th number is reached." - The direction therefore was anticlockwise. This is true of both pagodas. If the Department had acted on this principle, the plaque-order today, I am convinced, would approximate to the original arrangement. But the Department had already made spasmodic efforts at West Hpet-leik to arrange the plaques in the opposite, clockwise, direction46. Taw Sein Ko tells us that i5i plaques of West Hpet-leik were "found to be firmly fixed in their original position"47- over three-fifths of the present total (240) on that pagoda. At East Hpet-leik we read that "I7i entire plaques were found and I78 fragments"48. We are not told that the former were in situ, but probably most of them were, for if they fell, they broke. There are now only about 206 plaques, including fragments, on this pagoda. What has happened to the odd I43 fragments here, and the odd 29 fragments at West Hpet-leik, one can only guess. There is, obviously, still plenty of evidence about the original arrangement: our task is merely to disentangle it from the mistakes made by repairers. The latter, in general, would replace a fallen plaque in a tier near the point where it lay; but it might be the wrong tier, or in the wrong order, or on the wrong side of the corridor. More serious disorder was caused by the experts who tried (half-heartedly, one is glad to say) a new system of arrangement. After trying to recover the original system from the written evidence, I asked Col. Ba Shin to join me in checking this on the spot. Owing to damage, especially at the corners, we were sometimes doubtful of the exact point where the face begins and ends; but allowing for such minor errors, we believe that, so far as the inner sides of the corridors are concerned, the following was the original arrangement: - WEST HPET-LEIK Inner side of corridor. Three tiers Top tier: Jdtakas I to 113. (Evidence meagre; distribution should be approximately as follows: - E. I to 30; N. 3I to 54; W. 55 to 84; S. 85 to II3.) Middle tier: Jatakas II4 to 227. (Evidence meagre; distribution should be approximately as follows: - E. II4 to I43; N. I44 to i67; W. i68 to I97; S. I98 to 227.) Bottom tier: Jdtakas 228-340. (Evidence ample; distribution should be approximately as follows: E. 228 to 257; N. 258 to 28i; W. 282 to 3II; S. 3I2 to 340.) 44 A.S.B. i9i6, p. II. 45 Contrast the Jataka series of the Nanda, which starts at the S.W. corner of the lowest roof-terrace. 46Witness West Hpet-leik, S. corridor, outer wall, lower tier. 47 A.S.B. i908, p. 8. "ii8 had fallen down to the ground", he adds. "Of the latter, only 49 could be restored to their original places, the remaining 28 not being provided with niches in a consecutive order, and the balance, 41, remaining unidentified." The W. Hpet-leik total of plaques and fragments, therefore, was I5I + ii8 = 269. Of these 240 are still there. 48A.S.B. I9I3, pp. I0, I3.</page><page sequence="283">Chapter XIII 265 EAST HPET-LEIK Inner side of corridor. Four tiers Top tier: Jatakas I to I23. (E. I to 32; N. 33 to 63; W. 64 to 92; S. 93 to I23.) 2nd tier: Jdtakas I24 to 245. (E. I24 to I54; N. I55 to i85; W. i86 to 2I4; S. 2I5 to 245.) 3rd tier: JTtakas 246 to 368. (E. 246 to 277; N. 278 to 308; W. 309 to 337; S. 338 to 368.) Bottom tier: Jdtakas 369 to 490. (E. 369 to 400; N. 40I to 43I; W. 432 to 459; S. 460 to 490.). Since the earlier Jdtakas were in the upper rows, and had further to fall, these were inevitably the chief sufferers at both pagodas. Many more of the later Jdtakas survive in fair condition. The order on the East Hpet-leikis clear, though these plaques, as a rule, are more fragmented than those on the West Hpet-leik. The credit is therefore largely due to Saya Pe's careful and accurate work. At West Hpet-leik the ample evidence of the bottom tier enables us to be roughly sure about the distribution of the two upper ones. The order on the outer side of the corridor is less evident. At East Hpet-leik our repairers seem to have used the S., W. and N. outer sides as a receptacle for fragments and misfits. Only 2 rows on one face were needed here, for the 6o or 6i remaining plaques to complete the series. It seems that these were lodged on the two tiers (outer wall) of the E. side, starting from the lower, and ending with the upper tier. It was probably Saya Pe49 who first noticed that the last Jdtaka, Vessantara, was allotted several plaques on East Hpet-leik. The third plaque from the end on the E. side, top tier, is probably Ndrada Jdtaka (No. 548). The next is blank. The last, presumably Vessantara, shows a rider on an elephant facing a king seated on a stool under an umbrella. Continuing on the S. side, we find a plaque (writing illegible) showing Vessantara, seated in his hermitage on the right, speaking to JUjaka standing with a pole on the left, the two children kneeling between them. The next plaque, numbered ... 550, shows Vessantara (the two children kneeling at his feet) pouring the water of dedication before a headless J'jaka. On the next plaque, which has no writing, a king, seated in the centre, hands a longish object to a figure kneeling on the left. The two children are shown in tiers, with a stout figure on the right. Beyond, there is only the right side of a plaque, showing a robed woman (? Maddi) standing near a tree. All these plaques have the number '550' painted above them, pre- sumably by Saya Pe. The East Hpet-leik, in both tiers of the outer side of its W. corridor, has over a dozen plaques il- lustrating tortures in the hells (Pls. II7, ii8). A few have legible glosses: sahkha-mundika, 'shell- tonsure, a kind of torture' (P.T.S. Dictionary); tftldkfita niriya*, 'False Weights Hell'; sunakha nirayau, 'Dogs' Hell,' etc. - Such illustrations of Hell are rare at Pagan. At the West Hpet-leik 210 plaques (Jdtakas 34I to 550) still remain to be placed: the two tiers on the outer sides of the corridor have at least 2I3 pockets available. Evidence still extant on the E., N. and S. walls is compatible with the view that (approximately) Jdtakas 34I to 454 were housed on the upper tier, and 455 to 550 on the lower tier. No. 550 is now astray on the top tier of the inner wall in the middle of the S. face. If this came originally from the lower tier of the opposite wall, it would indicate roughly where the original series ended. 49 Saya Pe noticed the last of the East Hpet-leik plaques "representing king Vessantard giving away his white elephant ... The parapet walls of the western entrance are covered by plaques illustrating scenes in the Buddhist hell." (A.S.B. i9i6, p. ii).</page><page sequence="284">266 Chapter XIII But on the outer side of the outer wall on the East - the side to which Aniruddha clearly reorien- tated the approach to both pagodas - there is another, almost complete, series of the final Jdtakas, from 493 onwards. They are not later additions; they include some of the best in the series; and they date, in their present location, from early Pagan days. This is proved by the fact (first discovered by Saya Mon Bo Kay's sharp eye-sight) that where the original plaster on the wall around the Jdtaka- pockets is intact, on the lower tier, it contains short glosses in Old Mon written above the plaques, summarizing their story. Some I4 of these Old Mon plaster-glosses still survive. I guess - it is little more than a guess - that Kyanzittha, eager as always to educate his people in Buddhism, removed a number of these splendid plaques from their original places in the lower tier of the dark corridor, and re-set them in the bright eastern wall50, where they were bound to attract an inquisitive audience. Four of these (Nos. 493, 494, 496, 498) duplicate others still in their original places. They were pro- bably taken from East Hpet-leik. The two pagodas adjoin one another; and there is no doubt that in the course of excavation the two series got sometimes confused51. This matters little, since both ob- viously come from the same workshop. The plaques are approximately square: height generally I5 to I4 in., breadth I5 to I3 in.; thickness 3j to 2 in. But there is a good deal of variation. To young ceramists at Pagan, the making of these Jdtaka plaques meant good discipline in narrative art. To extract the gist of a long story in a foreign tongue, and then reduce and reproduce it on a panel I5 inches square, was a feat in itself. Of course they often failed. The wonder is how often they succeeded. And there is simple beauty in many of those which fail as narrative. There is nothing stilted, formal or exaggerated; and not overmuch that is conventional or repetitive. One would call them realistic, but for their constant simple dignity and grace. Calm, not dramatic nor theatrical, they tell their story and have done. Take the East Hpet-leik plaque of Paduma Jdtaka52 for example (PI. I02 c). The title is neatly engraved along the top. The lotus tank is shown vertically down the centre, a full-blown lotus in each corner. The noseless guardian of the tank, elegantly coiffed, sits or kneels in the centre, holding a lotus. He faces the two snobs, sons of the rich man, on the left. Their cynic rudeness is shown by the way the leader thrusts his begging hand towards that sensitive face. The third, plainspoken son, the Bodhisattva, stands on the other side, in pose of courteous address, his merit shown by the thin pedestal he stands on. All alike are simply clad in tasselled loincloths, their hair their only luxury. There is nothing here to spare, and nothing sanctimonious. The figures live and tell their tale with bare economy and grace. The animals shown on these plaques are all delightfully natural: the little deer (PI. 97 c), the monkeys (PI. I03 c), horses (Pls. 97 d, iii a), pigs, oxen (PI. I03 d), crab, elephant (PI. I03 b), snakes (PI. I02 b, ii6 c), barking dog (P1. II3 c), lizard (PI. 99 b), rhinoceros, hare, lion, buffalo, etc. (PI. I05 d); and especially the birds: partridge (PI. I05 b), ospreys (PI. iio a), cranes, crows, owls, wild geese, wild fowl (Pls. io6 c, d). 50 Note that he did much the same with the Mahanipata plaques at the Shwezigon (inira, p. 273). 51 The West Hpet-leik has now 2 plaques illustrating each of the following Jatakas: 10, 296, 322, 447, 493, 494, 496, 498 (MahAgovinda) and 5I3 (Ayoghara). The East Hpet-leik has now 2 plaques illustrating each of the following Jatakas: 26, 54, 96, 257, 3II, 382, and 40I. The extra plaque in each case properly belongs to the other pagoda, where it is always missing, except (possibly) I Io. 52 See P1. I02 c. A.S.B. I9I3, PI. II 4. Duroiselle, alert as always to artistic merit, was the first to note the beauty of this plaque.</page><page sequence="285">Chapter XIII 267 Where did this delightful art originate? - It is seen in embryo in the Shwdhsandaw plaques at Pagan Museum (PIs. 86,87); and is generally supposed (I think rightly) to have come with coastal Mon artists, after the capture of Thaton. It has little in common with the coarse vigour of Paharpur plaques in N.E. Bengal53, and little or nothing with the highly sophisticated terracottas of West Bengal54. Is it a native Mon art, based on early wood-carving? Or is it rather, or also, a legacy from the Andhra artists of Kalinga, who seem to have taught the coastal people their early sculpture, and spread their noble three-dimensional art as far as Barabudur? As stupas, the East Hpet-leik is larger than the West, in height, girth and breadth at the base. Both have a tall double-banded an1a, not at all bell-like, with sikhara-niches at the four points of the compass. Above the anda, West Hpet-leik has a recessed and indented harmika and strong tapering cone of chattrdvali. East Hpet-leik has a similar conical chattravali, above an enormous cubic harmikd55. The latter outdoes the Singhalese. Is it really original? Aniruddha's work (if we may attribute it to the king) in enclosing the base of the pagodas with squared corridors, had the effect of changing the frontage of both, from North or West to East. Probably at a later date, mandapas were added on the east of each. A broad oblong brick structure (P1. 96 c, d) was built against East Hpet-leik, with high wooden roof now lost. It has large corbelled niches for images in the side and outer walls, amd a flat-roofed passage leading to the E. corridor. At West Hpet-leik a sort of 'front-projection' (Old Burm. i-t'wak) was added, floored with brick and supported on wooden posts, whose round brick bases are still visible ii ft. E. of the corridor-wall. This i7-t'wak, it seems, was destroyed by fire. Taw Sein Ko mentions "the approach to the entrance lined with stone and masonry figures of a Deer and Dragon, fragments of which were found"56. - These must be the crouching stone deer (or bull ?) and the stone lion-head now leaning against the W. steps of East Hpet-leik. The latter -not unlike the Shw6zigon stone lions (P1. I77), and the older terracotta one at Waw, Ky0ntu57 - has a square mouth, a mane, two beard-tassels, and a collar with bells suspended. SHWEJ-ZIGON PAGODA (Pls. I69-I83) The next moment in stupa-building comes near the beginning of Kyanzittha's reign, say io86 A.D., with the building of Shw6zigon, II2 ft. high. This fixes the Norm (there will, of course, be exceptions and developments) for the large Burma stupa of the Pagan period, down to the Mingalazedi of the mid- I3th century: - one octagonal terrace holding the large round double lotus-bed of the stupa proper; a bell-shaped anda with single band; no square harmika above, but slowly tapering chattrdvali, straight- lined in profile, ending in the small amalaka and double-lotus clasping the finial; at the base, three square terraces crossed with median flights of steps - terraces lined with green terracotta plaques in pockets along the waist; the top terrace corners, where space allows, filled with models of the central stupa, the others with peaked jars or stupa-pinnacles. 53 See, e.g., A.S.I.

He liked to prefix his works of merit with the word Nirvdia59, implying (I imagine) that he was no longer in the Mahdydnist fold (which regarded Nirvana as a sort of opium for the masses), but a Theravddin with Nirvana as his declared goal. If this is right, the Shwdzigon marks the final break with Mahdydnism, and stands as the first great monument of the Reformed Church in Burma. It was built, he says, "on the site named JA YABH CTMI, north-east of the city of Pagnin"60. The name 'Zigon', now written can-:khtui, is an old corruption of the original name, Jayabhimi, 'Land of Victory', i.e. Auspicious Site. The stages of the corruption of the name are shown on the north face of Pillar II of Kyanzittha's own inscription at the site. The four-line Mon inscription written, doubtless by his grandson CanIsgi I, immediately below the four faces of this pillar, names the pagoda Jeyabhuii61. Immediately below this, on the north face, is a five-line old Burmese inscription, dated either 6ii or 6I7 S./I25o or I256 A.D. Here the name is written CaikhU*62. Can is the norma Old Burmese form of Pali jaya, 'victory'. The change from buh to klu* probably came by misreading, through an inter- mediate *gul, the letters g and bh being often indistinguishable. The Chronicles63 say that the pagoda was built to enshrine the Frontlet-relic removed by Aniruddha from Dwattabaung's ceti at 8ri Ksetra (probably the Bawbaw-gyi, where plaques signed by Aniruddha are found64); also the Tooth-relic duplicate supplied by the king of Ceylon. They attribute the building of the three terraces to Aniruddha in 42I S./Io59-60 A.D., and only its completion to Kyanzittha65. But there is no hint of this in Kyanzittha's original inscription66 - the two great pillars, still in situ on either side of the approach to the East Gate. It contains no mention of Aniruddha in all its eight long faces of Old Mon. Large extracts from it have been given in translation supra, in Chapters II, III and IV67. The inscription is not dated; but as it gives the final version of the Kyanzittha legend and the Buddha's prophecy concerning him68, it should come after the second version, io98 A.D. We may date it provisionally C.IIO2 A.D. A fragmentary replica of the inscription, once set up at the Palace-site near Tharaba Gate, is now at Pagan Museum69. The pagoda may be sixteen years or more older than the inscription. The name of the pagoda and the site, as quoted above, comes at the top of another inscription, No. VIII, set up at Prome Shw6- --Epig. Birm., I, II, p. I56, Inscr. VIII A'. - I have altered Blagden's final word wihkir, which he admits (n. 2) to be "entirely conjectural", to ceti which is much more probable. Blagden had never been to Pagan, so could not know what sort of building was referred to. 59 To the tanks he dug at Mrakan and Alampagan, he gave names prefixed with Mahdnirbbdn (Epig. Birm.

Here, near the end of his life, Kyanzittha lists the chief events of his reign, very likely in chronological order. If so, the building of Shw6zigon comes near the beginning, immediately preceding his revision of the Tipitaka. The name Jeyabhfim occurs once again, in a fragmentary passage of his palace-inscription7". This mentions "the palace of Jeyabhiim". - I take this to refer to a tem- porary palace near the pagoda - possibly the enclosed cave-site S.W. of it, still called 'Kyanzittha Onhmin'72, - occupied by the king, either when he was building the Shw6zigon, or while his new palace, within the walls of Pagan, was being built. This new palace, we know, was building in IIOI-2 A.D. SHWEZIG6N JATAKA-PLAQUES One way of checking the date of the pagoda, is to note the numbering of the later Jdtakas73, as shown on the three lowest terrace-plinths. Does the Shw6zigon follow the earlier, 550-Jdtaka recension, as found in the two Hpet-leik series? Or the later Singhalese, 547-Jataka recension, as adopted by Kyanzittha (no doubt as a result of his revision of the Tipitaka) in the Nanda series, c. II05 A.D. ? The short answer is that he followed both and neither; and, in consequence, there was an egregious muddle. The Shwdzigon plaques are usually difficult ro read, and sometimes impossible to identify. To be just to Kyanzittha, we must first eliminate all later muddles, and discover the original arrange- ment. A few years ago, six members of the Burma Historical Commission spent a week reading the writings, and trying to get at the original pattern. It was not easy. The following is my provisional summary of the evidence collected. Kyanzittha followed the Hpet-leik numbering and arrangement of the last ten Jatakas (Mahani- pdta), thus74: - 54I. Temiya = Singhalese 538 Miiga-pakkha. 544. NemT - ,, 54i Nimi. 545. Mahosatha 546 Mahd-ummagga. 546. Cantikumc 542 Khandhahbla. 547. [Bhfridatta] 543 BhUridatta. 548.

For the critical numbers 497 to 540, he does not follow the Hpet-leik. He usually, but by no means always, follows the Singhalese numbering, thus (I give the Singhalese number first, then the readings on the plaques): - 497. Mdtahga 4(9)7. 498. Cittasamlbhuta 498.

There are a good many duplicate and a few triplicate plaques, for some of the middle and later Jdtakas (none, I think, on the ground plinth).

The Shwdzigon Jataka-plaque is more oblong than the Hpet-leik: much the same in breadth (I4J inches), but not quite so high (I31 inches). There is beading all round the plaque, and a ledge near the bottom separating the carving from the writing. The latter is rough: not elegant like that of the Hpet-leik. Like the Hpet-leik, it gives merely the name and number of the Jataka. As distinct from Hpet-leik, the plaques are all glazed. Some are even made of stone. When Colonel Ba Shin pointed this out to our pottery expert, U Kyaw Nyein, he was amazed, and thought it unique. He noticed, how- ever, that the stone was badly crazed: which indicates that the optimum adjustment of temperature in firing between glaze and stone had not been achieved. Glazed stone is also found later at Htilominlo; but Kyanzittha was apparently dissatisfied with his Shw6zigon experiment, and reverted to terracotta in the glazed tiles of the Nanda. If the Glass Palace Chronicle is to be believed, this great pagoda, the Shwdzigon, was "rebuilt and finished in seven months and seven days" (p. 109).

Super- vision and co-ordination must have been faulty. But Kyanzittha's later temples, Nagayon and Nanda, were built with meticulous care. There is evidence in the Nanda to show that he would not hesitate to reject anything below standard. Personally, I believe that the Shwdzigon muddle stemmed less from carelessness or neglect on the king's part, than from sheer ignorance of the Jftaka Canon. The Ceylon manuscripts had only recently arrived, and RMjakumdr's revision (if I am right in thinking that the work was placed under him) was only just started. Kyanzittha had decided, in principle, to substitute the Singhalese Canon for that used by Aniruddha: but for the time being he had to depend on miscellaneous copies and conflicting texts from Thaton (?). The muddle would not have occurred if he had followed Aniruddha's method, of assigning the work to a single reputable and unhurried workshop. But Kyanzittha was more democratic, and, like most military men, he was in a hurry. As at the Nanda, lhe appears to have called for specimens from various workshops, each working from manuscripts with a different numbering. Unable to decide which was right, and which wrong, he played for safety by including all the variants. This made for speed in building; but commercialized the whole process of plaque-making, and degraded it from art to journey-work. As was usual, he started his series from the centre of the E. face of the ground plinth. That plinth has 58 pockets for plaques on each face, 29 on each half-face, 232 altogether. II2 of these are now empty; and a good many that are there, are intrusive and not original. An interesting old one (PI. I75 f) on the W. face, 4th from the N.W. corner, reads: kassapamandi jat I1 3I2. This is clearly an intruder from Hpet-leik. If we number these pockets I to 232, we can check them against the Jdtaka plaques with legible names or numbers. On the page opposite we give our summary of the evidence on the three plinths. It is only on the Ground Plinth that one can be really fair to the evidence. Here there are no duplicates, and no important differences in numbering. Some 26 plaques (numbers shown in heavy type) are exactly in situ; there may be a few more if one looks closer at the details and allows for minor displacements. The evidence, if not ample, is sufficient, I think, to prove that the suggested arrange- ment is correct. Note, incidentally, the interesting variant name for No. ii8, Vattaka Jdtaka - Cintaphala, i.e. the Cittaphala 'Thought-fruit', of the gdthM. In the Middle Plinth, while the evidence proves abundantly that the suggested arrangement is not far wrong, one cannot say for certain that it is right. What with duplicate plaques and variant Jdtaka numbers, confusion enters and gets rapidly worse. The column 'Jdtakas expected' gives the arrange- ment as it would have been, had these numbers been invariable and one pocket assigned to each. It will be seen that the tendency gradually increases for 'actuals' to lag behind 'expected' numbers; and little effort is any longer made to arrange the plaques in serial order, provided the numbers come fairly close together. Of the 8 lines devoted to the Top Plinth, in lines (vii) and (viii) muddle has passed into morass. Line (ii) may be the sequel to the Middle Plinth. If 540 is to be reached at the end of line (vi), the natural divisions would approximately be: - Line (ii), 436-456; Line (iii), 457-477; Line (iv), 478-498; Line (v), 499-5I9; Line (vi), 520-540. Line (i) (East face), instead of following on from the Middle Plinth, gives the last Ten Jdtakas in good Hpet-leik order: - 54I, blank, blank, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550. The East face is the main face; and Kyanzittha may have wanted the Mahdniptita shown here, just as, at West Hpet-leik, I guess it was he who brought out to the front Aniruddha's final plaques, previously hidden in the lower row at the back. x8</page><page sequence="294">274 Chapter XIII It was, I suspect, Kyanzittha's own deep consciousness of muddle due to ignorance, which drove him to the conclusion that a thoroughgoing revision of Tipitaka texts was urgently necessary, if he was not to lead his people into a morass of conflicting detail and consequent heresy. It was this revision which finally aligned him, and with him Burma, firmly on the side of Singhalese Mahdvihdra tradition. FOOTPRINTS, COLOSSAL BRONZES, STONE LIONS, WOODEN DOOR A large stupa at Paga'n did not usually stand alone. If it does today, one suspects that it once had at least one covered building made of perishable materials, now lost. Sometimes, as at Shwehsandaw, there are detached gandhakutf built of vaulted brick at the axial points, with Buddha images for worship in stone, bronze or brick; sometimes carved wooden doorways; stone Footprints of the Buddha; shrines for 'Nats' or Devas; stone inscriptions; and massive lions in stone or brick guarding the approaches. All these, and more, are to be found at Shwezigon. One of the stone Footprints is shown at PI. 93 a. They are in the 'tazaung' N.E. of the N. gandhakutf, marked G on the site-plan (PI. I70 b). In the four grand gandhakutf, stand four colossal bronze Buddhas, glorious images, modelled on the colossal Gupta image of Sultdngafij, now in Birmingham Museum (Coomaraswamy describes it as made of "copper over earthy core, 7 ft. 6 in.")75. The Shw6zigon bronzes (P1. I73) are taller: I2 to I3 ft. high, excluding the lotus pedestal. Each Buddha stands with right hand raised from the elbow in abhayamudrd. The left hand is held out level from the elbow, holding, or as if holding, the lapel of the robe. The hands, as one sees them today, are probably not original; the feet, in one instance, are of stone. The bronze is thin; one would like to know the chemical analysis. To Duroiselle we owe the rediscovery, in I922, of two of the finest subsidiary features of Shw6zigon: the two stone Lions at the far end of the West approach (P1. I77); and the carved wooden Door, formerly in the N. gandhakuty (Pls. I78-i82). He first reported as follows76: - "Two figures of Lions in stone placed on pedestals ... were found in fragments carelessly pieced together and in a neglected state ... They still look, in their bad state of preservation, as works of no mean order. The manes are carefully delineated, and the nose and mouth are finely sculptured. They form ... the earliest figures of lions in the round that are now extant at Pagan77. They are contemporaneous with the pagoda itself ... With a view to have the fragments pieced together properly, I saw the Chairman of the Trustees of the said pagoda, and ... asked him to have them carefully preserved"78. The North Lion stands 4 ft. 9 in. high, without the pedestal, and 4 ft. 6 in. long. As for the South Lion, Col. Ba Shin reports as follows: - "Broken pieces ... are still to be found in two groups in the field immediately S. of the approach. The stone plinth on which the Lion sat, the broken head, the fore and hind parts are there; and if these pieces can be put together, I think it may be possible to restore the Lion in its old position, perhaps with some parts missing . 75 Hist.

II, figs. 2 and 3. 77 Duroiselle forgets the lion-head at the Hpet-leik (supra, p. 267), which should be older. 78 Note that the Chronicles also make special mention of the Lions, but get their orientation wrong: - "Sakra with his own hand began and finished the Lion-figures at the S.E. corner" (U Kala, Vol. I, p. 2I7; Hmannan (Susodhita ed.), I p. 289; G.P.C. transl. p. i09).</page><page sequence="295">Chapter XLII 275 Duroiselle also spoke to the Chairman of the Trustees "about the conservation of a wooden door found in a temple on the N. side . . ., which appears to me to be very old and almost contemporaneous with the pagoda itself. The door itself, which is formed of two leaves each measuring I3 ft. 2 in. in height by 3 ft. in breadth, is of simple design. It is formed of vertical pieces of boards or battens re- bated and held together by cross braces and horizontal struts. But the interest lies in the carvings on the outer surface ... These carvings ... are among the earliest that are now extant at Paga'n, of which only a few examples remain. They consist of scrollwork of floral design and roses within beaded borders of a bold type, with quaint figures of men and women, some dancing and others playing on musical instruments, placed at the ... junctions between the horizontal and vertical pieces of the frame. They are carved on separate pieces of wood and framed on the door from outside, forming panels ... Compared with the stolid stone figures belonging to the same period, they are full of life and activity ... This door is a unique piece of work, and with a little care and trouble it may yet be preserved for a long time to come. All that will be required of the Trustees is to have it earth-oiled once or twice a year, to see that no candles are lighted near it, and that it is kept free from white ants." Duroiselle went further. He got his artists to take photographs of the Lions, and measured drawings of the Door, and most of the figures on it. These we are privileged to reproduce (Pls. I78-i82). How much attention was paid to his simple requests by the Pagoda Trustees, is shown by a comparison between these drawings (I922) and our photographs of the door (i960, P1. i82 b to f). The door was removed from the N. gandhakugt, placed on its side in the dust in an annexe of the S. gandhakuti, and left to the mercy of the insects. NAT -WORSHIP The Shw6zigon is the most 'national', of all Burma's pagodas. A score of original in- scriptions are distributed in various parts of the site, covering most periods of the Burman's history. Why has it always been so loved and venerated? For even a foreigner, mixing in the crowd of worship- pers on holy days, is soon made conscious of the fact. The Shwdzigon is indeed a grand, a glorious pagoda; but there are others at Pagan just as fine aesthetically, and others far more purely Buddhist, sounding a deeper note of spirituality. - I suggest that this special feeling for the Shwdzigon goes back to its origin. Kyanzittha, like Aniruddha, was bent above all things on propagating the Religion. There are two main ways of propagating any religion. One - which we may call the Clovis method - is by sudden Conversion: "What I loved, I hate. What I hated, now I love." The other is to admit the old gods to pay service to the new, and so induce gradual transfer of devotion from the one to the other. Kyanzittha's policy was the latter. His method here is obvious. On the main platform of the pagoda, near the S.W. corner (F on the Site-plan), is a shrine containing two 'Nat' images in gilded stone, one placed high above the other (PI. I76 c, d). They are sea-spirits called by the strange name: 'Apha-htet- tha-ta-la-gyi', "Son one month older than the Father". Daw Khwe Ma, 'Nat-htein' of the shrine, told Col. Ba Shin the story as follows: - "When the building of Shwezigon was complete, the king, by means of his magic wand Arindama, summoned the spirits of the sea. The Nats Shw6 Myo Zin and Shwe Zags, father and son, and the Broker Nat, Pwe-min-gyi U N6 Dun, came up to Paga.n from the south. On the way, the father Shw6 Myo Zin and the Broker Nat had to break their journey in order to attend a conference of spirits; so ,8*</page><page sequence="296">276 Chapter XII they sent Shwe Zaga' ahead of them to Pagan. After the conference they followed up, arriving at Paga'n just one month late. The king had summoned the Nats with a view to accommodate them within the precincts of the pagoda, so that they might act as guardians of the Religion. As Shw6 Zaga' arrived first, he was given a higher position and a higher shrine. The late-comers were given a status lower than Shw6 Zaga', who was thus one month senior to his father in service of the king and the Religion. The father was given a seat lower than the son, but on a platform in the same shrine. The Broker Nat was given a separate shrine on ground-level." The Thirty-Seven Nats, still powerful in men's minds today, are assigned a long chapel (E on the Site-plan) within the outer wall of the enclosure, between the E. entrance and the S.E. corner. In the E. sanctum of the same building stands the Lord of the Spirits, the Bo-bo-gyi Nat, heavily gilded, dowdily loaded with votive shawls and garments. Under these, one discovers an ancient wooden image of Sakka or Indra, king of the Sakra Devas (P1. I76 a, b). He stands facing west, 8 ft. 8 in. high from feet to top of crown. He wears a fine loincloth with kfrtimukha pattern and bead tassels. The long left hand hanging at his side may hold the Vajra (?). The right arm, bent upwards at the elbow, holds perhaps the Conch (?). The feet have been repaired. Other Devas in stone, ten-handed, 6 ft. IO in. high, stand on guard as Dvdrap51as on each side of the S. Gate (P1. I76 e, f). They are passing, slowly but steadily, out of the world of Indian Devas into that of Burmese Nats: plain evidence and symbol of popular Buddhism in Burma. It cannot be called a high form of the Religion; but it is a living one. MIN-O-CHANTHA, 'Happiness of the Old King' (P1. 263) The name is given to a line of five similar stupas, graded in height along a natural ridge running north and south, 1 mile N.E. of the Nanda. The Chronicles79, after mention of Kyanzittha's building of Nanda, continue: - "When he had built these works of merit, nine holy relics of the Lord's Body arrived from the Ceylon king. He built a 'pahto' and called it Min-o-chantha. " Duroiselle com- ments80: - "It was built during the reignl of king Kyanzittha . .. by, tradition has it, his own son RMjakumdr, for the restoration of his old father's health, hence its name." In the 'tazaung' on the W. side of the main stupa, there are two gilded stone images of the Earth-touching Buddha that may well have come from the original Nanda workshop. Perhaps, then, we may date the building of the Min- o-chantha group c. IIIO A.D., between the building of Nanda (c. II05) and Kyanzittha's death (III3 A.D.). The five stupas follow the norm. They are set on platforms varying in height, but with a common base and walled enclosure surrounding them. The tallest, in the centre, is approached only from the west, up three flights of steps: height 42j ft. above the top terrace, 53j ft. above the enclosure base. The first flight takes one to the level of the broad enclosure and its wall. The second plinth has pockets for plaques and a crenellated top, and only a narrow terrace. This plinth separates the central stupa from its two neighbours, which are about Io ft. lower. The third plinth has a parapet of perforated brick. The top terrace is a wide one, commanding a fine view towards the east. The crenellated terrace here drops sheer down to the enclosure. Each of the five stupas has a 'bell' with central band, and 79U Kala, I, p. 2i8. Hmannan, I, p. 290. G.P.C. (transl.), p. iio. 80 Duroiselle, A.S.I. 1922, pp. 35-36 and P1.

They have recently been whitewashed; so the details of the old carving have been ruined. At the N. stupa was found a Burmese stone inscription81, doubtfully dated 542-3 s./ii80-82 A.D., recording death-bed gifts of slaves and rice-fields by the ministers Can-saiigh and the Hon.'ble Caiikray. The wooden roofing over the main stairway, perhaps a century old, used to show interesting carvings of monkeys, etc., and rows of large nude figures, male and female, facing each other across the stairs. These have now been removed. SIN'-PAHT, 'Glazed Pagoda' (PI. 258 c) This medium-sized stupa (height about 50 ft.; breadth at square base about 64 ft.) stands a few yards W. of Alopyi' temple, S.E. of Htilominlo. The Burmese ink inscription in the Alopyi', dated 556 S./II94 A.D.82, records a dedication in the presence of the "chief monk (saikYi) of Can put'uw", i.e. Sin'-pahto, "iVc Cuit Sait". - I should date it provisionally near the beginning of the 12th cen- tury A.D. Only the top part of the pagoda still shows glaze - the strong-banded 'bell' and the chattrdvali. It is broken at the top. At the base are two bold receding terraces, deeply recessed with a broad central panel, large enough to admit Jdtaka plaques, but without pockets for them. A plain steep stairway runs up the centre of each face. Low crenelles edge the top of the terraces, with small stupas at the lower corners, and larger ones above set in the spaces left by the top octagonal terrace. The stairs lead on up this to the narrow round top-terrace below the 'bell', which may once have had the ring of double lotus, no longer visible at the base. There is no stonework at the corners. The Sin'-pghto follows the norm closely. SO-MIN-GYI STUPA (Pls. 259-262 bis) The date of this great stupa is open to question. It stands S.W. of Nagayon, about a furlong S. of Abeyadana, on the W. side of the road. Its position not far from the river, in the neighbourhood of early temples and pagodas, its distinctive character, fine workmanship and magnificent glazed work, suggest to me a date near the beginning of the i2th century A.D. But what of the name? A Burmese stone inscription dated 566 s./I2o4-5 A.D.83, records dedications by "Cuiw Main (So-min), daughter of Pyatkhk." Pyaxikhi, probably a son of Caiisil II by queen Vataiisikd, perished, it seems, in a rebellion at the time of Ndtofimyd's accession in 12II A.D. Pyarhkhl's son fled to Tavoy, but was allowed to return to Pagan on payment of a heavy fine84. Another inscription8, dated 603-4 S./I24I-2 A.D., at Letputkan temple, Minnanthu, records perhaps a deathbed dedication by "Cuiw Mail, grand- daughter of Lady Phwa kry" (Klacwd's grandmother?). If the builder of the great stupa So-min-gyi ('the elder So-min'?) is the same as the lady (or ladies?) of these inscriptions, it will have to be dated at least a generation after the end of our period. But perhaps 'So-min' was merely a title for a senior queen 81 I.B., P1. I 7. Now Stone ii at Pagan Museum. Cf. List io6, B. II 768. 82 I.B., PI. IV 367 a6, 556 s-/ I94 A.D. 83 I.B., PI.

The Archaeological Department (I know not on what evidence) dates the building of SO- min-gyi pagoda in i2i8 A.D.86. This large and lofty stupa was once as high as it is broad at the base - about ioo ft. each way. There are three high terraces supporting a massive single-banded 'bell'. The relative height of terraces and stupa proper, as at Sin'pahto, is about half and half. But here there are no median stairways, and so a much steeper climb. The top terrace still has square-based corner-stupas. There were none, it seems, on the lower terraces. The massive squareness of these cubes is only broken by three slight recessions towards the corners, with lines hinting at the pyramid. Each corner, so Col. Ba Shin tells me, is strengthened by stone tenons running back into the mass. The bricks used are large: i6-1 in. x 8- in. X 3 in. The three terrace-plinths, almost vertical in section, are not weakened, as at Sin'pahto, by a sunk medial waist-band. Instead, below the low crenelles of the parapets, each terrace has a series of four indentings, the projecting parts between them being embossed with glazed stucco. These glazed bosses, panels and corner-masks, green and yellow, are the chief glory of the monument. So certain, now, were the Pagan ceramists of their firings, that instead of sinking the glazed work in pockets as usual, they dared to emboss them on their fronts; and if, after all these centuries, many have perished, it was the fault of the plaster that held them, not of the glazings themselves. Much, especially from the lowest plinth, has fallen or been removed: some to Pagan Museum87, much (by Fritz von Noetling) to Berlin Museum fur V6lkerkunde88. I do not know if it has survived the War. In four plates (260-262 bis) we give a selection of this glazed work. But parted from the mountain mass they once threaded and enlightened, like Kinnarls on Himava, half their gaiety and glory fade. The So-min-gyi has a strong character and beauty of its own. It does not vary far from the norm; its variations are fully justified by the purpose and by the result. It is a RatanaceUf. THE HARMIKA Parallel to the norm as fixed by Aniruddha and Kyanzittha, there was an older tradition of pagoda- building which remains common throughout our period, and persists after it. On the stupas of Safici, above the hemispherical anda, there is always a fenced harmikd, pedestal or box for relics, which also served to hold in position the one or more umbrellas (chattra) above it89. In the earliest caitya-hall at Ajant5. (Cave X, first century B.C.), the fenced harmikd has a square flat 'cap' with three recessions below90. In Cave XIX (c. 500-550 A.D.) the harmika cap is not only recessed, but also once indented towards the corners9l. The Visvakarman Cave at Eliird (Cave X, c. 700-750 A.D.)92 comes nearest to the Paga'n harmikd, cap and harmikei being merged, and so indented and recessed as to annul all sense of squareness. 86 Amended List of Ancient Monuments in Burma (I92I), Meiktila Division, p. 28, Serial No. 6o. "This shrine rests on 4 terraces". - Actually, there are only three. 87 See A.S.B. I904, p. II. I take the liberty of quoting U Kyaw Nyein's comment: - "The glazed decorative tiles used on the S6mingyi pagoda are most beautiful. They were designed and made with meticulous care to fit with each other perfectly. A much better glaze-fitness to the body is noticed in these tiles, and they are still in perfect condition. The combined achievement of the sculptors, artists and ceramists of Pagan reached their highest level in making the glazed decorative tiles for this pagoda." 88 See Chapter XII, note 2. 89 See Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, II, Pls. 6, 25. 90 Zimmer, II, PI. i65. I" ibid., PI. i8o. 92 ibid., PI. I97.</page><page sequence="299">Chapter XIII 279 Aniruddha, following perhaps the example of Sri Ksetra, had transferred the Relics from the top to the bottom of his stupas, sinking them under their centres or corners93. This allowed him to omit the harmika from the first, and spread the base of the chattrdvali (no more suggestive of the umbrella) directly on the top of the 'bell'. Kyanzittha did the same. But old practices, even when they cease to be useful, are loth to die. In origin the two Hpet-leik pagodas are doubtless older than Aniruddha. Both retain the harmikai. At East Hpet-leik (PI. 96 a), possibly owing to 'repairs', it looks like an enormous box. At West Hpet-leik (PI. 94 a), damaged as it is, it was probably indented and recessed, both at top and bottom. In the Indian cave-caitya at Elhir only the lower portion was so treated. At Paga'n the effect of this double recessing was not only to introduce a new intricate and beautiful member, but also to reduce the heavy harmikd to something vaguely resembling the dmalaka94. At Amardvat! (2nd cent. A.D.)95 and the later Caves at Ajantd96 and Eldra97, niches for standing or seated Buddhas invade the anda. They do the same at Pagan Hpet-leik, but on all four points of the compass. The tops of the niches are usually enriched with elaborate ?ikhara-facings, similar to those on many of the votive tablets. These niches check the tendency to flare the base of the 'bell'. To counteract the breaking of the anda, the horizontal band binding it is given prominence by decoration. Finally, this new-old fashion of enriching stupas, spreads also to the temples, especially those with tall mitre-like sikharas, where tapering tiers of niches were possible98. ABItYADANA GROUP The beautiful recessed and indented harmikd is a feature of the ABPYADANA temple, which has a plain banded bell-like anda (PI. 2Ii a). Just outside the present enclosure-wall on the south, there is the ruined SITLE-PA YA (PI. 2io d), opened by Taw Sein Ko in I90599: - "a small stupa ... 5 ft. to the S.E. of the Abeyadana temple, . . . a miniature cylindrical structure rising to a height of 12 ft., and covered by an outer casing indicating that a larger stupa has been built over a smaller one." It has a banded 'bell' with fig-leaf stucco decoration above and below the band; deeply recessed and indented harmikd; and round, seemingly octagonal, chattrdvali, slitted but joined at the 'corners' - all very like the top of Abeyadana. The nameless STUPA S. OF MYINPAGAN SCHOOL (P1. 258 a, b), S.E. of Nan-paya, is very similar, and beautifully preserved except at the base: the same 'octagonal' chattrdvali, the same recessed and indented harmika; the same strongly banded anda, with lines of fig- leaf above the band, but kzrtimitkha loops below. This stupa is 251 ft. high; it ought to be conserved. - All this group should date from the early part of Kyanzittha's reign, say c. I090 A.D. HPYATSA SHWE-GU STUPA (PI. 359-36i) The Hpyatsa Shw6gu, W. of Myinpagan village towards the river, is a temple of Mon type, dating perhaps from the earlier half of Cafisil I's reign.

The stupa proper, which is well preserved, resembles West Hpet-leik. It has the same tight-tall chattrdvali cone (not joined at the 'corners', like those of the Abeyadana group); the same indented and recessed harmikd; the same high- shouldered anda, with four sikhara-topped niches (missing in the Abeyadana group) facing the cardinal points. It has also a beautiful horizontal band round the anda; inverted V's (or fig-leaves ?) above, and kfrtimukha loops below with floral pendents. The shape of the narrow terraces at the base, could doubtless be ascertained by clearing the debris. The Archaeological Department has now started to repair it. SEINNYET-NYIMA (P1. 377) This, too, is the cetiya-member of a pair of pagodas on the E. side of the road S. of the Nagayon. It is more ornate and better preserved than the Hypatsa Shw6gu stupa. Its strongly piled chattrdvali, minutely recessed and indented harmikd, anda with four gikhara-topped niches, 'bell'-band with fig- leaves above and kfrtimukha floral loops below, are almost the same. But here three square terraces, each with pillared corner-stupas but no median stairways, form the foundation. Its fellow, the Sein- nyet-ama temple to the west of it, shows 'Mon' influence in architecture and painting; but Jdtaka- glosses in the Hall are carelessly written in Old Burmese. Quite possibly it may date beyond the end of our period. This stupa forms the link between the old harmikd stupa and the norm. It is often assumed that the presence of the harmikd on a Burma pagoda argues Singhalese influence. This may be true of Sapada pagoda'00 S. of Nyaung-u, built in Cafisil II's reign, when Singhalese in- fluence became strong at Paga'n. Before then, in the period covered by this book, it is improbable. The oldest harmikd at Paga6n is probably that on Pebin-gyaung (P1. 78 a), which must surely be earlier than Aniruddha. It is not at all unlike the Singhalese harmikd: but here direct influence is almost ruled out. In Burma, as in Ceylon, the harmika is an ancient Buddhist heirloom from India. In each country it has lived its own art-life more or less independently. Ceylon's conservatism in things Buddhist is well known. The Sapada harmika is archaic and Singhalese in form, when compared to the typical evolved harmika at Paga'n, as found on Seinnyet-nyima. ENCASED STUPAS These are just as common at Paga'n as they were at 8ri Ksetra. One is apt to accept them as old, or at least older than the stupas encasing them. One needs to remember U Mya's warning, quoted at length supra (Chapter XII, p. 236): -"None of these monuments at Pagan can be dated earlier than the iith century A.D."101 Encased stupas are precious to the student when they are found complete, especially at the top. Most of the famous pagodas of Burma have been repaired so often that one can say little for certain about the original shape of their upper parts. Our best evidence comes from encased stupas, and from small models found in relic-chambers. 100 Sapada pagoda: A.S.B. i9i6, P1. IV 2; Pictorial Guide to Pagan, p. 23. 101 U Mya, A.S.I.

Nothing is known of its origin. Taw Sein Ko guessed that it might "be ascribed to the ioth century or earlier' 02. Old as it is, perhaps U Mya is right in dating it not earlier than the iith. The firm hexagonal base, with its recessions, stands breast-high. Then circular recessions lead to the up-and-down-turned lotus and the stupa proper. Above this, there is a short andia, with band of cording between rows of fig-leaf along the middle. At the top of the anda, a squared recession recalling the old harmikd projects, just like the recessed harmikd,-cap of Kanheri or Cave X at Ajanti103, to form the base of a pyramidal apex, gikhara-shaped but flat-faced (like the Vajrdsana temple at Bodhgayd), except for one recession on each side of the central plane. The pyramid tapers to the dmalaka-lotus holding the bulbous finial. Such a pyramidal top is unique at Paga'n. The stupa, says Taw Sein Ko, "was exposed to view by removing its brick casing'104. ENCASED STUPA N. OF TAWYA-GYAUNG (P1. 259 a)'05 This stupa, opened by U Mya, is on the river-bank S.W. of So-min-gyi pagoda, about 2 furlongs N. of Tawya-gyaung monastery. The print shows the stupa still half-encased. It is of normal type, bell- shaped, with square terraces and no harmikd - probably post-Aniruddha. It is distinguished by two bands of sunk crenelles, with indented band and pockets between them. The top of the chattravali is unfortunately lost. SCOVELL S' PAWDAWMU (P1. 259 b)106 This massive little stupa, 2I1 ft. high. was discovered and opened, at his own expense, by Mr. C. E. Scovell, late Executive Engineer in charge at Pagan. It is therefore often distinguished from the Nagayon Pawdawmu as 'Scovell's Pawdawmu'. It stands on the E. side of the branch-road to Dham- mayan-gyi, i mile N.NW. of that temple. The plain squared terrace base, with two recessions towards the corners and many horizontal lines, makes it look massive. The stupa proper is of normal bell-shape, without harmikd, distinguished by extra tiers of climbing lotus petals, and bulbous dmalaka, near the top of the chattravali. Taw Sein Ko's view, based on Pagan U Tin's, "that it should be ascribed to the 9th century A.D.", seems to me pure fantasy. I should date it not earlier than the latter part of the iith century. Many interesting bronze images, including a beautiful seated Lokanatha'07, were found on the west side of this stupa: see Pls. 435, 436 a, b, 446 a. 102 A.S.B. I9I8, p. i9. Coomaraswamy (H.I.I.A., p. I70) merely says that it "has evident Indian affinities". 103 Kanheri: - A.S.B. I9I6, P1. I. Ajanta Cave io: - Zimmer, II, P1. I65. 104 A.S.B. I9I6, p. 27. 105 A.S.I. I930-34, Part I, p.

If, under the terms Shrine and Temple, we include all pagodas with an interior that can be entered, it will not always be easy to distinguish them from Stupas. The Maniydr Math at Rajgir1 in India is hollow, and also some Buddhist stupas in Gandhdra. The Bawbawgyi at Sri Ksetra has a vast hollow interior2, not intended perhaps for entry, though tempting to the spoiler. The very hole through which one enters today, may have been made by Aniruddha, about I050 A.D., when, according to the Chron- icles, he "destroyed the ceUf built by king Dwattabaung, and took the Frontlet-relic"3, leaving within votive tablets signed by himself. Conversely, as we have seen at Nga Kywe Nadaung (supra, pp. 258-9), even an experienced archaeologist may mistake for a "domed chapel" a "'large pit ... left by treasure hunters". Like the Gandhdran Greek, the ancient Pyu and Burman were not satisfied with the bare Stupa as an object of worship. Two stone lids of relic-chambers found at Khinbagon, Sri Ksetra, show stupas with a terraced base, pierced with rows of niches holding on one side five Buddhas seated in dhydna mudri4. Seeking for the origin of Pagan temple architecture, one may well turn ultimately to India; but the first source is likely to have been Sri Ksetra. Here the small vaulted shrines, 7th to 8th century A.D. - Bebe, L6myet-hna, East Zegu, and several others less well preserved - provide, on a much smaller scale, prototypes of many of the large temples of Pagan. About i050 A.D., doubtless on his march down to the coast, Aniruddha occupied both Old and Modern Prome, before his conquest of Thaton and Tenasserim. But I do not think the Pyu source was the only one. Temple-architecture at Pagan can be divided into four main periods: - I. Pre-Aniruddha period. - There is inscriptional proof (see Chapter I, pp. 8-9) that at least one early king, Caw Rahan, set up religious buildings in or near Pagan. His regnal dates, according to the 1M. H. Kuraishi and A. Ghosh, A Guide to Rajgir, pp. 22-23; A.S.I. i9o8, p. 42, n. i. The Stupa-dome, says Gisbert Combaz (I translate from the French), "normally covers a hollow containing the urn with ashes or the relic- casket... There is generally no access to the exterior. However, in Gandhara, at the Gudara stupa and two others, Masson discovered a sort of tunnel, from the centre of the building to its circumference. This peculiarity, already noticed in certain tombs of Hither-Asia, would explain the deposit of relics after the completion of the building" (L'Evolution du Stfipa en Asie, p. I79). 2 A.S.I. i908, p. 42 (J. H. Marshall). The Atwin M6ktaw stupa at gr! Ksetra is also hollow: see A.S.I. i9i0, pp. II5, ii9. Perhaps all of them were. 3 G.P.C. (transl.), p. 86. For an attempt to explain this remarkable allegation, see supra, Chapter II, p. 22-23. 4 A.S.I. 1927, P. I74 and PI. XXXVIII (d).</page><page sequence="303">Chapter XIV 283 Jdtdtodpu* were 956-iOOI A.D. If so, he died some 43 years before Aniruddha's accession. The Buddhist chapter-house he built on top of Mt. Tuywin, was still standing in I2I2 A.D., when it was repaired. It must have been built of durable materials. The same king, from U Kala's Chronicle onwards (early i8th century), is styled Nat-to-kyoui: takM, "Donor of the Residence of the holy Devas."5 This seems to imply that he also built the Visnu temple, Nat-hlaung-gyaung, still extant in the heart of the City. I see no reason to question this, and good reason to believe it. This temple, and another early shrine, Pibin-gyautng, are discussed infra. It was a period of widespread paganism; and, in court circles, of peaceful co-existence between Buddhism and Vaishnavism - the latter, perhaps, the older culture in these parts. Such co-existence was a common feature, not only of Pyu Sri Ksetra and the coastal country of the Mons, but also, bye and large, of the whole period covered in this book. II. Reign of Aniruddha (c. I044-77 A.D.). - Buddhism, under royal patronage, tends now to be in the ascendent; but in the absence of canonical texts was thinly spread, and still in balance between the Mahdydna of East Bengal and Arakan, and the Theravada of Dvdravati and Old Prome. Pyu influence is strong in architecture, seen especially in the ground-plans and the invariable radiating arch. But after the capture of Thaton, Mon beauty of colour, ornament and design combines with Pdla Bengal strength to produce the typical art-forms of Early Paga'n. It is full of variety: the plan and windows of Pitakat-taik; Shinbin-thalyaung with its reclining Buddha (both attributed to Aniruddha); Manuha temple's colossal images; the lovely stone-faced Nanpaya (both assigned to the captive king of Thaton; the grand stone-faced facade and hall of Kyaukku Onhmin; the bold design and deep devoutness of Myinpyagu. It is the best period of unglazed Jdtaka terracottas. 1II. Reigns of Sawlt, Kyanzittha, and (in part) Can-sfi I - After the arrival of the full Tipitaka from Ceylon (c. I075 A.D.) comes the ever-expanding triumph of Theravdda Buddhism, and the splendid series of what I call (with some slight hesitation) the 'Mon' temples. They are all similar in plan, with many features common to the older and freer periods. There are now countless themes for sculpture and painting, and wide wall-spaces. But the architect is still the master-artist; sculpture remains largely conventional, and painting mainly decorative. The first masterpiece is Pdhtothacmya; the climax Nanda temple (c. II05 A.D.). IV. Transitional period (III3-74 A.D.). - This period witnesses the gradual passage from Old Mon dominance to Old Burmese. The first flowering of the latter is at Shwegu-gyi (II3I A.D.); the first masterpiece Thatbyinnyu temple (c. II55 A.D.). With the capture of Pagan by Pardkramabahu's armada in ii65 A.D., Singhalese influence tends to supplant Mon at the capital; but this soon leads to the efflorescence of Burmese culture under Cafisf II and his successors. PRE-ANIRUDDHA PERIOD Caw Rahan's 'Thein' (sfmd,), on top of Mt. Tuywin (Turahtoit), 8 miles S.E. of Pagan. Nothing of this remains. The sharpness of the summit proves that the chapter-house was a small one. But the fact that it lasted from about IOOO to I2I2 A.D. (when it was repaired) suggests that it was built of strong material, very likely the sandstone easily available on the spot. NAT-HLAUNG-GYAUNG (Pls. I43-I49) This name - "Residence confining Devas" - is a modern, and a rude, variant of the term used in the Chronicles: 'Nat-taw-gyaung', "Residence of the holy Devas." Honourably sited, little more than 5 U Kala, Mahayazawingyi, Vol. I, p. i6o (para 228). Hmannan (Susodhita Ed.). I, p. 227 (G.P.C.transl., p. 59).</page><page sequence="304">284 Chapter XIV a stone's throw from the palace, this Visnu temple stands within the city, near its south wall. The Brahmanic features of the temple have been discussed in Chapter XI (supra, pp. 2I9-222). Here we are concerned only with the architecture and the date. Duroiselle mentions a "late" Burmese manuscript, 'Thamaing of the Pagodas of Pagan', which says "it was built by king Anoratha after his return from the conquest of Thaton (Io57A.D.)."6 Aniruddha was the champion of Buddhism rather than Vaishnavism; and he built Caityas rather than temples. So the attribution, improbable in itself, must yield to U Kala's testimony, which goes back at least to the early i8th century. There are moreover, to confirm it, markedly archaic and distinctive features in this temple, noted by my learned colleague, Col. Ba Shin: - (i) The stone jambs, lintel and sill framing the entrance to the upper corridor or shrine.7 (ii) The arch-pediment over the image-recess, with inward-bending spines, typical of grl Ksetra rather than Pagan.8 (iii) The fact that the central image (now mostly lost) was certainly of Visnu Anantasayana, not found elsewhere at Pagan, but found four times at older sites - 8ri Ksetra, Kawgun Cave and That6n.9 (iv) On all these five images of the Hindu Trinity, Visnu is given precedence, whereas in Abeyadana's temple (c. I090 A.D.) 8iva is pre-eminent.10 As for the distinctive features, note the apparent preference for fine terracotta carving of most of the main images, as against stone for the Avatdras of the lower corridor. Note, too, the difference in level between the inner corridor and the outer, permitting the unique feature of clerestorey windows above the latter. Note, finally, that the broken rounded spire, resting on intricate horizontal facets, is Drdvida rather than Ndgara in style. On the other hand, the loss of the outer wall, due perhaps to earthquake and the lean-to vaulting of the lower corridor, is the fault typical of the 'Mon' period. Viewed as a whole, this quite extraordinary jewel of a temple suggests Indian influences different from, and older than, the usual East Bengal models. The original form of the superstructure is not easy to grasp from ground-level, nor yet from the interior of the shrine. Above the lean-to vault of the outer corridor, there seems to have been a low- vaulted top corridor enclosing the clerestorey. Above this, the top of the temple, below the breakage, is still in fair preservation: a square roof-terrace with triple corner recessions and pockets for plaques. Above this, the corners were weighted, and the roofs slope back up to the base of the fikhara, the much-indented corners of diminished squares passing easily into tapering round. Seen at sunset from a distance, their jewel facets shine. One cannot but feel amazement in the presence of a pioneer masterpiece such as this. For the temple sculptures and paintings, see Chapter XI. PEBIN GYAUNG (P1. 78 a, b, c). This small Cetiya temple is in the N.W. part of the old city, S. of Bu Paya and N.W. of Mahabodhi temple. The name means 'Corypha Palm Monastery': but it bears no resemblance to a monastery. 6 C. Duroiselle, "The Nat-hlaung-kyaung, Pagan", A.S.I. I9I3, p. I36. 7ibid., P1. LXXVIII b. 8 See our P1. I46 a. 9 See Chapter XI, pp. 217-220. - Since this volume went to press, yet another stone relief of Visnu Ananta- s'ayana has been reported from Pagan: "in Cave No. i6I2/920 W. of the Mimalaung Kyaung" (to quote the local press). This would be presumably within the walls of the city, not far west of Nat-hlaung-gyaung. 10 PI. 219.</page><page sequence="305">Chapter XIV 285 Perhaps it was the devotional shrine attached to a monastery now perished. Externally, it looks like an archaic type of Cetiya, strong and plain in its proportions, with round narrow terrace (or terraces) now ruined, cylindrical dome, large square'belvedere' harmikd", and thick round 'pole' (ya~sti) sup- porting a tight cone of tapering chattravali. The top is as repaired. The pagoda looks more stumpy than it should, like many of the old buildings within the city-walls, part buried by the drifting sand of centuries.'2 The total height of Pebin-gyaung is over 40 ft. For the interior, see the plan and section (PI. 78 b, c). It is quite unlike any other shrine at Paga'n. Entrance is on the east, by a low passage 2 ft. high; one steps down into the tiny hall (less than 41 ft. high), and so enters the square shrine (io ft. high, 5 ft. i0 in. square). The solid mass and weight of the building is all around and above one. There was once, no doubt, an image to worship. It brings home to one the real meaning of kit (or gil, Sanskrit guhd) - not 'temple' but 'cave'; not 'cave' but 'secret place', somewhere in the bowels of the earth. "Tradition" says Taw Sein Ko, "ascribes this pagoda to the ioth century".13 There is no need nor likelihood, on ground of its harmikd, to seek its origins in Ceylon.14 ANIRUDDHA S REIGN. - PITAKAT-TAIK (Pls. 80-82) This 'Library for the Pitaka' stands within the walls of Pagan, next to the palace-site, on the S. side of the road shortly after it enters at the Tharaba Gate. Aniruddha is thought to have built it to house his texts of the Tipitaka after the capture of Thaton.15 If so, its date would be I057 A.D. or shortly after. It is said to have been repaired by king Bodawpaya in I78316. The angle- and centre-pieces and finial of the five receding roofs, may well belong to the latter date; also the stepped approaches on the east; but the main structure, with its thick walls, broad dark lean-to corridor, and darker shrine, llt only by the three doorways on the east, and the three perforated stone windows'7 on each of the other faces, must surely be original. It is the beginning of that 'Mon' style, which dominates most of Pagan architecture for a century, down to the end of the period covered by this book. SHINBIN-THALYAUNG (PI. 85 b, c) Aniruddha, it seems, rarely ventured beyond the Stupa in architecture. But it was probably he who added the foursquare vaulted corridors housing the Jdtaka-plaques around the two Hpetleik. And he was also doubtless responsible for the Shinbin-thalyaung recumbent image, and the brick building that encloses it, at his chief work of merit, the Shwehsandaw. The building forms part of the actual 11 Cf. the sketch of the Bharhut harmika, fig. I4, p. I95, of G. Combaz, L'Evolution du Stispa en Asie. It is probably the oldest in existence. 12 It would be a real work of merit to clear the drift and debris from these city-monuments, and drain their sites, and let them stand their proper height. 13 Taw Sein Ko, A.S.B. I9I5, p. 44; i9i6, PI. III I (before repairs). 14 P6bin Gyaung is "of the old Sihhalese hemispherical type" (Coomaraswamy, Hist. Ind. Indon. Art, p.

The colossal image made of brick and plaster, nearly 70 ft. long'8, shows the Buddha entering parinirvana. The dying Master lies (as usual in Burma) on his right side; but his head (contrary to the texts) is here towards the south. No doubt (as Col. Ba Shin has pointed out) it was felt proper that the image should face the pagoda, and not turn his back on it. The vaulted building makes no pretence to show off its colossal image to advantage. It is merely a broad-vaulted, cleverly built shed-covering, with a narrow passage all round and many small niches for images. Incidentally, it gives M. Lavaud a chance to show his brilliant photography (PI. 85 b). Between the broad front and narrow back vaults, there is a long vaulted passage high up, in the spandrels above the reclining figure. MANUHA TEMPLE (Pis. II9, I20) About the same time Makuta, ex-king of Thaton (his name is now corrupted into 'Manuha'), must have built his colossal images at Myinpagan, where he was living in captivity, a mile S. of Pagan. "Stricken with remorse", says the Glass Palace Chronicle,"9 "he built a colossal Buddha with legs crossed, and a dying Buddha as it were making Parinirvata; and he prayed saying 'Whithersoever I migrate in sathsdra, may I never be conquered by another!' The temple is called Manuha to this day." - The attribution is also made in a number of late inscriptions or 'copies' under dates of dubious value.20 According to the Pegu Kalydni inscriptions (I479 A.D.), Aniruddha's capture of Manohor (Pali Mano- hari) took place in 4I9 S./Io57 A.D.21 What little we read of his family in later inscriptions, suggests that he did not live long in captivity. At Manuha temple, on the W. side of the main road, there are three colossal images in a row, facing E., the largest (47 ft. from knee to knee) in the centre; all sit in Earth-touching attitude. At the back, facing W., is the reclining image (90 ft. long), the head here correctly orientated towards the north. We may date this temple, or at any rate its colossal Buddhas, c. io6o A.D. NAN-PAYA (Pls. I2I to I3I) To pass from Manuha temple, which has little architectural merit22, to the neighbouring Nanpaya, is (to me) a breath-taking experience. This lovely little temple, the earliest masterpiece of 'Mon' temple architecture, lies just south of the Manuha. It is also attributed to the captive Thaton king, i.e. Makuta. I should date it c. Io6o-70 A.D. The date and nature of the building have been discussed in Chapter XI (supra, pp. 2II-2). Briefly speaking, I follow U Mya (as against Taw Sein Ko) in regarding the Nanpaya as a Buddhist temple: but not in his proposed dating of it as late as the I2th to I3th century"23. It may well have been Makuta's private chapel. The small central pedes- tal, now empty, may once (I suggest) have borne a life-size standing bronze image of the Buddha, 18 Our checked measurement is 69 ft. io in.

The four stone pillars that form a sort of open shrine about it, are each carved on their two inner faces with beautiful stone figures of Brahmd: eight altogether, in low relief, seated with outer knee raised, in ardhaparyaitkdsana, amid a forest of lotus, their hands sustaining each a pair of them. They do not sit in namaskdra mudra, for they are bearing offerings. Their pose is similar to that of the Brahmds in the Myinkaba Kubyauk- gyi porch-paintings (PI. 345), or those of stone inset in the thrones of Myebontha Paya-hla (PI. 25I) - both undoubtedly Buddhist temples. The four arches joining the Brahmd pillars on the outer side are crowned with Buddhist stupas at the peak (PI. I26 f.). The temple is built of brick, faced everywhere with stone, like the main storey of Kyaukku Onhmin (PI. I32 b). This large-scale use of carved stone is confined to the earlier reigns of the dynasty. I do not think it occurs after about IIOO A.D. The stone, cut small like bricks, as is usual at Pagan, is often beautifully carved. If this slicing of good stone shocks one at first sight, one soon forgets it in delight at the carving. The stone roofing is smooth and solid. The plan of the temple (PI. I25 b) is simple: a square main block; three windows on each face except the E. This last is the side of entry, with Hall (one window on each side) and porch (the only entrance, now defaced). The four central pillars of the Shrine, without much blocking of light and space, serve to support the roof and mark off the sanctum. The arches of the 'Corridor' surrounding the four pillars, are half-arches, climbing and leaning in towards the centre. Above the arches the exterior cube passes into the pyramid, fenced with three receding crenellated crests, rising to the base of the gikhara. Here weight is lightened by dormer skylights on each face, filling with the sun's splendour the well or lantern just above the (missing) Buddha's head (P1. I27 b): so that the S'ikhara sits lightly, like a crown above him. Each face of the sikhara has three retreating planes, once studded (like the Vajrasana temple at Bodhgayd) with medallions of lotus set on lotus-altars. PI. I26 a gives some idea of this crown before time and repairs coarsened it. Of corner-stupas little but the stumps remain, their corners still delicately carved with kneeling caryatids (PI. I26 d). Decoration, even now, is rich. All i6 sides of the four interior pillars repay study, and nearly all the ii windows of the exterior. These windows, with 5 x 6 diamond-apertures on the main block, and squarer 5 x 5 diamonds on the Hall, are all crowned with the Early Mon clec or pediment, horizontal rather than vertical. The goddess Sri (Kydk Sri) sits in every apex, her arms drooping and outspread, holding lotus stalks. Her elephants with showering pots are gone. Makara heads with tight-coiled trunks are clear above the capitals, with Devas pillared on their necks. One recalls Kyanzittha's palace-inscription :24 - "In the centre, above the pedimented arch, there was the goddess ?rT made of shining gold, adorned with gems. On the two sides, above the capitals of the arch-pillars, were two golden figures of Devas in the act of blessing, with golden flowers in bouquets within the arch, together with hanging pearls and golden plantain-leaves." The cornucopia stands, as at Mrakan stone lodge (PI. 242 a) and the Dhammayan-gyi (P1. 39I), in the gable-hollow, between the mnakaras, under the Kydk Sir. The lines of small stone bricks emphasize the horizontality of the clec, derived from the barely arching architraves of S5Aci. The gradual passage from Mon horizontal, to Burmese vertical, treatment of the clec, is always noteworthy. Here, in the Nanpaya, the horizontal dominates. And the long down-tapering V's of the corner-pilasters rest these horizontal masses on two needle-points in air. 24 Epig. Birm. III, Part I, Inscr. IX, Face R.</page><page sequence="308">288 Chapter XIV Owing to faulty drainage at the cornice, one suspects, the stone kfrtimukha frieze is the worst preserved feature of the temple. P1. I23 c shows how strongly modelled it was once, and how rich in detail. In squareness and relief it rivals the long stone frieze of Kyaukku Onhmin (P1. I34 a, b), but excels it in beauty, especially at the corner-pilasters which still, in spite of decay, are among the glories of this temple (P1. I23 a). The lovely haisa dado (P1. I23 d), much better preserved, in its long train of arabesque and broken foliations, captures and refracts the endless play of fierce light and shadow on the basement. Such architectural splendours cannot be seen or matched, except for an occasional moment, outside the drier tropics. Below the dado, the high kalas'a-pot plinth-moulding (P1. I22 b) achieves by mastery of light and shade both beauty and stability, and sets a high standard for later Pagaln architects to follow. They do not always follow it. The plinth mouldings of the 'Mon' sub- period, modelled perhaps on those of Old Thaton, are far superior, in general, to those of the latter half of the dynasty. The plain Hall has no staircase leading to the roof. The outer wall of the 'Corridor' has two deep corbelled niches on the side of entrance. The other walls have two small niches each between their three windows. "Faint traces of painting" says U Mya, "can be discerned on the plastered surface of the walls of the temple by slight moistening with a wet cloth." The Nanpaya is sometimes cited as different from 'Mon' temples in not having paintings. This is true neither of the Nanpaya, the Nat- hlaung-gyaung, the Kyaukku Onhmin, nor the Nanda. It is not true, either, of the Early Burmese temples, the Shw6gu and the Thatbyinnyu. If a Pagan temple has no interior paintings, it may be because it was never finished; but usually it is due to the disastrous work of whitewashers. Each face of the square central pillars has a flat panel in the centre, with one recession near the corners. The Brahmd faces (Pls. 128-I30) have been described above, on pp. 2II-2. Above them, the kfrtimukha frieze runs round all four sides of the pillars. Loops and tassels are like those of the exterior, but richer. The flat central plane of all eight floral sides (Pls. I29 b, I3I) shows a long kfrti- mukha V down the centre, with beaded tassels on each side sprouting into lotus buds below. Each projecting angle of each recession has its corner-kTrtimukha, with the V divided down its two faces, and tassel down the re-entrant. The much-damaged capitals and cornice above each pillar (P1. I27 a), are shown in something of their ancient richness in P1. I26 e. Above the cornice are the shoulders of the four pagoda-arches joining the four pillars. These, on the 'Corridor' side (P1. 126 f), show five receding roofs climbing to a lion-guarded platform, dmalaka, double lotus, and stupa with lotus finial. On the inner side they hold the well or lantern (P1. I27 b), which catches all the sunlight flooding down the medial skylights of the roof. KYAUKKU 6NHMIN (Pls. I32-I42) Two miles N.E. of Nyaung-u, beyond the Chauk-hpala ravine, is the Kyaukku Onhmin, 'Stone Temple-cave and Tunnels', sunk in a romantic gully strewn with fossil wood and pebbles bright like jewels. M. Lavaud's beautiful photograph (P1. 132 a), taken from the roof-top and looking N.E. up the river, gives a good idea of this strange eroded cliff-country. It is not a detached building, but the facade of a high sandstone cliff, hollowed with cells for ascetics. The receding upper terraces of brick</page><page sequence="309">Chapter XIV 289 are old, but later additions. The stone-faced Hall below, of "tender green" as Forchhammer described it,25 is the original. This noble stone facade (P1. I32 b), 30 ft. high, facing N., with kfrtimukha frieze unbroken (P1. I34 a), flat projecting porch resting on round black shadow between flat perforated windows (P1. I33 b): - the whole based on a strong graded plinth (PI. I33 d) beautifully enriched with dado-carvings (P1. 134 c) - could only date from Early Paga'n. The interior now holds a stone inscription beginning with the date 550 s./ii88 A.D., recording a dedication of land by king Cefisfi (Narapatisithu) to "the Buddha of the Rev. Thaftpd (? DhammapJIa) who received food from heaven" (lit. 'rice of the spirits'). It had another date below, 632 S./I270 A.D., now lost owing to breakage and cementing of the fragments.26 Taw Sein Ko, with the first date of this inscription (I imagine) as his authority, says the site was "originally dedicated as the residence of the celebrated Pamsukilla Mahathera by king Narapisithu in ii88 A.D.'"27 I am by no means certain that this inscription belongs to Kyaukku Onhmin. I do not remember seeing it there on my first visit in i9i8. Duroiselle describes it as being "within a cave at Chaukpala",28 which may cover any of the numerous caves in the neighbourhood. Forchhammer certainly included a facsimile in his original edition, but there is no mention of it in the text. At the top of p. I2 of the reprint he writes: "There are not now any ... inscriptions in the caves, except a small inscribed stone slab (see Plate No. VII, No. I4) found in the circular cell t." - I have read this last fragment, which is undated and post-Pagan, from his own Plate in India Office Vol. 3I5/2. D. i. It is not our inscription, but List I256, shown at P.P.A. p. 3I5. Nor is our inscription either of the two illegible ones mentioned at the end of his report. These are List I257 and i258 mentioned at P.P.A. 3i6, 3I7, as found "about 500 ft. S.E. of Kyaukku Onhmnin." In a scribble made on the spot before the last War, when our inscription was already set up in the temple, I noted with reference to the That1pd purhd of line 3: "Perhaps it comes from Dhammapa pagoda." - Col. Ba Shin has discovered that there is a pagoda now named Dd:mapd "about 300 yds N. NE. of Kyaukku." The main storey of Kyaukku must be at least a century older than Narapatisithu. Though less refined in workmanship, it has (as Forchhammer noticed) much in common with Nanpaya, attributed to the captured king of Thaton. If the Nanpaya may be dated i060-70 A.D., I should date Kyaukku a few years earlier. Forchhammer (p. I5) even suggested a date "before Anawratha". But so eatly a 25 Emil Forchhammer, Pagan I. The Kyaukku Temple. This original report published in Rangoon in i89i, included a number of valuable photographs and facsimiles not contained in the reprint, Report on the Kyaukku Temple at Pagan (Aug. igig, Government Press, Rangoon). The copy of the former that used to be in the British Museum, was destroyed by bombing during the last War. Complete copies are still, I think, accessible in the London Library and India Office Library, in collections entitled "Papers on subjects relating to the Archaeology of Burma" (Forchhammer). 26 See I.B., Preface to Portfolios II and III, p. 3: - "Plate 228 b" (the inscription now in Kyaukku Onhmin) "has the appearance of a fairly complete inscription dated 550 s./ii88 A.D. One must have recourse, however, to the facsimile shown in the first edition [of Forchhammer] ... in order to see that the stone has been broken across the middle and cemented together again in such a way as to omit four lines and a date 632 S./I270 A.D., which is the real date of the inscription." 27A.S.B.

'9</page><page sequence="310">290 Chapter XIV date is hardly probable. There is this difference between the two temples: that whereas Nanpaya shows obvious Brahmanic influence, Kyaukku is purely Theravada Buddhist.29 The great facade is built of stone or stone-faced brick, as at Nanpaya. The stone kfrtimukhas, as at Nanpaya, are boldly modelled, tusked and armless, disgorging loops of beading; their cheeks, here, are rather more squared and bulging. But the general effect is more stern and ascetic. Apart from the great round arch and small window-perforations, all main lines are horizontal. No gri and Makara pediments. No corner-pilasters even. No soft dado of Harhsas: but instead, a beaded base with pointed climbers, alternate leaf and chalice, all elaborately inwrought. These are unique at Pagan. The level- headed windows appealed to Forchhammer's careful German mind. He gives a long description of them. The one entrance, facing N., is a round high-shouldered archway of stone, iZ ft. high. Deep within it, is the real doorway, each jamb (P1. I34 e) having three recessions and five faces, bridged at the shoulders with wooden lintels. These five stone faces are carved with a luxuriant jungle, growing rather than empanelled (Pls. I35-I40): beads and pellets, shield, capital, medallion, bird and beast, lotus, cornucopias of flower and fruit and tendril, diapers enclosing gods with lifted arms sustaining lotuses. At the base (P1. I35), fixed in the projecting angles (forehead, nose and chin resting on their clubs), are pairs of tushy Rdksasas, crouched on guard to frighten villainy; and between them and the door, a comely girl in swaying stance as she upholds her jar, inviting piety to enter.30 There were once carved wooden door-wings of diamond lattice, moving in stone cusps above and below. Within, there is a vast dim Hall, 25 ft. deep, 42 ft. from side to side. The outer wall curves over to meet two great stone pillars in the centre. These rise to form a pointed vault, 32 ft. high, leading to the colossal Buddha (PI. I33 a). His enormous lotus-throne (9 ft. high, i8 ft. broad, and I2 ft. 3 in. deep), built of carved stone slabs, projects from a deep recess, roofed at a great height with three pendentives. High on the walls beside the Buddha are square panels of old painting, 'Mon' style, without writing. Above, carved in stucco below the painted vault, are several rows, including over a hundred Buddhas. The stone pillars, 8 ft. square, are sheathed at the base in elaborate dadoes of acanthus, swaying outward from the centre (PI. I34 d). The outer walls of the Hall have three tiers of niches holding stone reliefs (Pls. I4I, I42). Mostly broken and defaced (the result, probably, of earthquake), they are still precious, showing scenes from the life of the Buddha older than those of Nagayon and 29 "I believe the Kyaukku temple" says Forchhammer (Reprint, p. I7), "to be, like the Mahamuni shrine in Arakan, a remnant of North Indian Buddhism, which existed in Burma before the introduction and establishment of the Southern Buddhist school from Ceylon and Pegu." -This statement, I think, needs correction. North Arakan, as contemporary inscriptions and images prove, was a centre of Sanskrit Mahayanism from the middle of the 7th century onwards. There is nothing of Sanskrit or Mahayanism at Kyaukku Onhmin. The iconography and architecture of Kyaukku owe little or nothing to Ceylon: but, like nearly all the older art of Central Burma, derive mainly from North India. The religious influence of the Mons, both of Burma and of Dvaravati, may have been considerable; but in architecture, from the vaulted temples of the Pyu onwards, Central Burma was very likely ahead of all its neighbours. 30 For a somewhat similar figure on a Chaitya window at Patna Museum, see R. D. Banerji, E. Ind. School of Med. Sculpt., PI. go (a). For a still more remarkable analogy, recently reported by Mr. A. B. Griswold, between the lowest tier of carvings at Kyaukku and a door-jamb from Bangarh, Dinajpur, in N.W. Bengal, see our PI. 135 (bis) and Catalogue of Plates. We are grateful to the Dacca Museum authorities for permission to reproduce this plate, and for their valuable note on the subject.</page><page sequence="311">Chapter XIV 29I Nanda, and in some respects more vivid. The Nativity, Ploughing Festival, Tonsure, Fast, Mucalinda Ndga, Descent from Thvatirhsa, Ndlgiri elephant, etc. have all been noticed in Chapter VIII. In the Ploughing Festival (P1. I4i b), the swinging cradle is realistic. In the Fast (P1. I4i d), the two Devas are not massaging the Bodhisattva, but pressing tubes of ambrosia into his ears. The distinguishing feature of all the standing figures, great and small, is length of legs in proportion to torso. This adds to their grandeur; and though their surface has deteriorated, it seems likely (see, e.g., the Nativity, P1. I4i a) that the modelling too had life in it. Forchhammer, in his Plate II No. 5, shows another stone sculpture: "Gotama in the calm repose of Parinirvana, with adoring monks above and laymen beneath, some in praying attitude, others dancing." This sculpture is not now to be seen; it is not even remembered by the monks in residence. And what has happened to the "I2 wooden carved figures" (pp. I4-I5) which Forchhammer found? - "The third chamber" (a on his Plate IX) . . . "is 9'4" broad and 9' high; the ceiling is vaulted; two- thirds of the exit to the east is roughly walled up with bricks; the room is perfectly plain ... But against the wall recline I2 wooden carved figures 5'8" to 6'2" high; the elaborately wrought head-gear and necklaces leave no doubt that they are the effigies of royal personages. The body is plainly dressed; a mantle, open in front, falls almost down to the feet; the body is wrapped in a close-fitting, sackcloth- like garment; the right arm hangs straight down in the inner fold of the mantle, the left hand lies over the heart; the feet are without covering. Round the neck are tigerclaws and strings of pearl-pattern; the eyes are nearly closed; the face reflects the repose of death. The features are stern, the nose promi- nent and acquiline, chin and jaws broad and heavy; the axis of the eyes straight; the individual ex- pression of the various faces differ, but they are not Mongoloid. The head-dress and ear-ornaments are gorgeous; it is a mitre ... The statues are very much damaged. I think they represent Paga6n kings who, when grown old, assumed the yellow robe and died here in the hope by such a meritorious deed to have attained the state of embryo-Buddhas." These I2 wooden statues have also disappeared. Did Fritz von Noetling (who was a friend of Forch- hammer) carry these, and the Parinirvdna sculpture, off to Berlin, together with his numerous other thefts ?31 It seems to me almost certain that these statues were similar to, though not the same as, the 14 royal figures in wood now at Pagan Museum (Pls. 42I, 422). The latter were found in various temples: I found one myself lying in Hpyatsa Shw6gu, and photographed it then and there, leaning it against the porch of that temple (P1. 360 a). What exactly they represent, is a moot point. Col. Ba Shin thinks they are just 'crowned Buddhas' or Bodhisattvas. He has found similar ones, he tells me, in pagodas at other places besides Pagan. If we had more of the wooden statuary of this period, it would be easier to judge whether these statues, so different (especially in headdress and ear-ornaments) from the stone images, are just conventional, of no particular significance, or whether (as I still incline to believe, with Forchhammer) they represent, in half-idealized portraiture, dead kings and princes of Pagan, now gods in Devaloka. If so, the temples where these statues are found, may well have been the work of the kings found deified within them: e.g. the statue found at Hpyatsa Shw6gu may be the likeness of Caiisfi I. Such deification of dead royalty is normal in other countries of South-east Asia, and need surprise no one. But why so many should have been found at Kyaukku Onhmin, I leave the reader to guess. 31 supya, Chapter XII, p. 230. 19*</page><page sequence="312">292 Chapter XIV MYINPYAGU temple (Pls. 150-,52) This grand stupa-temple stands S. of the city wall, i mile S. of Pahtothamya. PI. I5o a shows it as it was after the War, buried in jungle and alive with snakes. PI. I5i a shows it as it is now, neatly restored by the engineer U Tun Saing and the Archaeological Department.32 Though of 'Early Mon' type in the main, it has many unique features. It dates doubtless from the reign of Caw Lu (Main Lulaiz), or the end of the reign of his father, Aniruddha. Votive tablets signed by both kings have been found within it;33 also tablets with four lines of Mon, and others with two lines of Pali in Nagari characters (ye dhammd, etc.).34 From the outside, before repairs, one might have taken it to be a solid stupa of normal type, without harmikd, with conical chattrdvali, 'bell' with single band and fig-leaf dressings, recessed octagon, and three sprawling terraces without corner-stupas. But the low basement with its few plain perforated windows (without pediments; like those of Pdhtothamya), points to a four-sided corridor within. Each side of the corridor has a deep-set perforated window at each end35; and on three sides there is a square medial chapel projecting, with a seated or standing Buddha against the outer wall, between two perforated windows, and diamond-shaped air-holes at each side. Each chapel is lined with 'Mon' devotional paintings. The standing Buddha in the S. chapel is slim- waisted like a Hindu god. At the foot of this image I found the stone head with tenon illustrated on PI. I5I f. Such tenons were made to interlock with the masonry. Above these chapel-extensions there were medial stupas, probably copying the one in the centre. On the W. side, instead of a chapel, there is the only entrance - a long narrow passage, with porch and hall. The porch is arched differently from the hall, and is perhaps a later addition, breaking the symmetry of the whole. The walls, seen from the outside, are framed in recessed panels, the same size as the windows, but solid. The corners, though low, are massive, as if to bear the thrust of the terraces and stupa within them. There is no internal staircase. The corridors (nearly 70 ft. long each side) are fully vaulted, and are exceptionally broad (over 9 ft.). On the inner side are long rows of tall trefoil niches, highly carved. Here sit Earth-touching Buddhas, lifesize, on lotus thrones and long platforms, projecting and recessed, stretching from centre to corner. The original plan was probably to have arched niches for I4 Buddhas on each corridor: and so the 28 Buddhas on each half of the temple. But on the S. and E. corridors there are a few reclining and standing images, slightly reducing the total. Each image is of brick, plastered and painted red, a few in fair preservation. They are of the 'Aniruddha type', with long torso, conical usnisa and flame-niche (this last generally lost). Ears touch shoulders. Little lions (P1. I52 d) stand on guard between the Buddhas, and large double-bodied lions at the corners, with standing Guardians on the ledge above them. Each tall niche is framed with strong pillars, squared capitals and beading. Fan-shaped flowers rise between the niches. Ha'hsas perch on either side of the capitals. In a long slot above the niches are wooden beams still in situ (P1. I50 b), with squared holes at intervals between the niches: perhaps to support baldachins (Pali vitdna) over each Buddha. Below the beams, in the spandrels, pairs of flying Devas are painted, bringing music or offerings to the Buddha below. Few of the Buddhas are 32 U Tun Saing informs me that the alternate zigzag projection of the bricks for better holding of the plaster - which reminds one of the original brick-laying of the Bawbawgyi, 8r! Ksetra - is here not an original feature. I venture one complaint. The perforated windows which had originally diamond-shaped holes on the main block and round holes on the chapels, have been coarsely repaired with square perforations, often clashing with the fine original work. This should be easy to correct. 33 PIs. I4 a, b, c, (signed by Aniruddha); 15 b, c (signed by 8r!

I52 e) sits in dhydna mudra, practising austerities; another in the W. corridor (P1. I52 C) touches Earth under the seven-headed Mucalinda Naga; two, in the E. and S. corridors, are shewn entering Parinirvdna; one, in the S. corridor near the S.W. corner, stands in varada mudrd, left hand before breast. These are not the principal images, which are hidden deep within the mass. From the centre of each inner side of the corridor, a narrow tunnel runs into the heart of the pile, to a secret small image3,6 cunningly lit by a medial skylight from the middle terrace (see Section, PI. I5i b). Climbing by ladder up to the top of any chapel roof, one can enter, stooping, these medial sky-lights, and find oneself in a clerestorey - under a relieving half-vault above the main corridor-lit by sky-lights also at each corner; here one can stand upright and walk all round within the temple.37 On the outer wall of the corridor there are three tiers of large Jdtaka panels, divided by broad floral bands, all richly painted. Each panel is i ft. 5j in. high by I ft. 4 in. broad, excluding the writing below: usually a single line of Mon in coarse largeish matters, or three or more crushed lines, rarely legible except in fragments. Thus on the W. wall, near the N.W. corner, one reads ikMy andabhfita jat gohil kMy takka j at gohii "It is the occasion of the Andabhiita Jdtaka" (No. 62); "of the Takka Jdtaka" (No. 63). On this top tier we could read parts of about 35 entries. There are some 44 panels on the S. and N. walls, 42 on the W., and about 36 on the E.: total i66, or nearly 500 for the three tiers. The top tier starts on the W. wall, just N. of the entrance, with a panel showing Sumedha before Dipafikara Buddha. The same scene introduces the Jdtaka Series, both in the hall of Abeyadana and the outer corridor of Myinkaba Kubyaukgyi. Not all the JTtakas, I think, are illustrated; and they are not always shown in the usual order. Thus the top tier ends on the S. side of the W. entrance with Jdtakas 252 (Tilamuthi) and 25I (Sankappadhota), Tika Nipata," in that order. Even when the writing is lost or absent, the panel is sometimes clear and colourful. We could see little and read nothing on the two lower tiers. The broad soffit of the vault is covered with simple paintings, architecturally designed. Above the niches, rows of stupas, white and gold, with recessed harmikds, alternate with golden flowers of lotus on brown stalks. Above, there is a 'frieze' of bold floral arabesque, still rich in white, gold and red. Then bands of ringed 'sun-gods' cross the vault in different colours, white and gold, with brown borders. On the outer side, above the Jdtakas, are rows of seated Buddhas in various attitudes, dharmacakra, bhfimisparsa, dhyana mudra, etc., each with a pair of disciples facing him, and a pair of flying gods with garlands above. Niche-soffits, too, are alive with painted 'sun-gods' and geometric patterns. This temple is more cave-like than other got. It is unique. From without, the effect, like that of Pcfhtothamya, is to lose the square in the polygon. This is due to the absence (or loss ?) of corner-stupas, 36 Such tunnels and secret images remind one of the fine pagoda with its lovely images at Ho-p6ng, beyond Taunggyi, S. Shan States, where the oldest parts of the vaulting (on the E. and N. sides, if I remember right) employ the Pagan radiating arch. 37 Possibly there was something like this at Nat-hlaung-gyaung, perhaps only an upper gallery or triforium. One would need ladders to investigate. 38 Extant evidence at Pagan shows that this Singhalese subdivision of the jftaka into Nipdta and vagga, occurs, first in Myinpyagu, the Abeyadana, and the 'Mon' temple W. of Taungbi tank. The Taungbi temple follows the pattern more strictly than the others. This subdivision is not found in Kyanzittha's early pagodas, Shwezig6n and Nagay6n.</page><page sequence="314">294 Chapter XIV and the presence of strong bays projecting in the centres, weighted with medial stupas. The interior is not sombre nor cold, but always richly dark and devotional. Apart from Jdtakas on the outer wall, there is little to distract attention from pious contemplation of the Buddha. As a means to fix the mind, and awake devotion to the Master, this temple has few equals at Pagan. PAUNG-GU temple (P1. I53) Paunggu temple is, or was, on the N. bank of Myinkaba Chaung at its junction with the Irawady, on the edge of a precipitous riverbank about a mile S. of Pagan. It has been constantly eroded by flood-water, so that now there is little left of it on top of the cliff. In i9i6 Taw Sein Ko reported39 that U Tin, Subdivisional Officer, Paga'n, had acquired for Pagan Museum ii stone and 2 bronze figures from this temple: "one of the stone figures represents the dancing of two mythical beings with human heads and the bodies of birds; a second depicts a monkey-headed man with four hands; and a third a creature having two heads of birds. One of the bronze figures is that of a deva or Nat, and the second is that of a seated image of the Buddha. The collection appears to bear traces of South Indian influence." On p. 5, para II, of the same Report, Duroiselle, inspecting Pagan Museum, found "three small slabs of soft white stone, on which are beautifully sculptured musicians, animals, gandharvas and other mythological beings, the technique of some of which is easily traceable to the old school of Indian sculpture, from which they have probably been copied... The action of the water has greatly damaged the building, and a few months ago, caused a small portion of it to crumble down, exposing to view the exquisite sculptures above mentioned. I inspected the Paung-gu, and am convinced that many more such and probably other sculptures are buried among the debris. It is advisable to clear the debris and try and recover what may remain of these sculptures before the river at high flood washes them away. The building is ascribed to Kyanzittha (i084-iII2 A.D.)". On p. 52, Appendix E of the same Report, only 4 photographs of these ii Paunggu stone sculptures (none of the bronzes) are listed, viz.: "45/I535. Figures of birds with the head of elephant carved in relief on a slab of stone. CC46/I536. Figures of monkeys carved in relief on a slab of stone. "47/I537. Figures of Kinnaras, carved in relief on a slab of stone. (48/I538. Figures of men, one beating a drum, and the other holding cymbals, carved in relief on a slab of stone." "Nos. 45-48 were discovered at the Paunggu pagoda, and now placed in the Museum, Pagan." The same list is repeated, under Nos. I535-I538, on p. 24 of List of Archaeological Photo-Negatives of Burma (Delhi, I936). These are shown on PI. I53. In I92740 Duroiselle reported further efforts to clear the debris; but these had to be abandoned because of the danger to the workmen: "When the monument was examined in November last, it was found that the central relic-chamber had all but been washed away, the only parts that remained being portions of its walls on the E. and N. sides. It was also observed that the mound was honeycombed at A.S.B. i9i6, p. 37, para 86. 40 A.SI. I927, pp. i65-6.</page><page sequence="315">Chapter XIV 295 with trenches, probably the work of treasure hunters, dating some years back." Yet he still held that "it is for consideration whether it would not be prudent to tackle the mound again and try and re- cover whatever antiquarian objects it may still contain." Of the two bronzes recovered, one is to be seen at Mandalay Archaeological Office: it is the archaic 'Pyu' figure of the Bodhisattva Maitreya (P1. 444 c, d). A close parallel to this was found in the relic- chamber of Aniruddha's Shw6hsandaw pagoda (PI. 4 a, b), with identification in Pyu writing. A third specimen, without inscription, is also at Pagan Museum: said to come "from a stone mound W. of the Myazedi, Pagan, 4 furlongs W. of the main road", together with a small bronze seated Buddha with large hands, both raised in abhaya mudrd. The description points also, pretty certainly, to Paunggu temple (see Pls. 444 e, f; 443 c, d). The two last-mentioned bronzes were found later at the site; the bronze found in i9i6 at Paung-gu, together with the first'Pyu' Maitreya, was a Lokandtha of Indian type (P1. 446 b, c). Of the 7 other stone sculptures deposited at the Museum by U Tin, two are said to be the small stone lions at the entrance to Pagan Museum (P1. 153 g, h). These Pyu bronzes and Dvdravati type of Buddha, raising both hands in abhaya-mudrd, clearly go back to the early days of the dynasty, c. io6o A.D., when Aniruddha built the Shw6hsandaw, if not earlier. I expect the Paunggu temple itself goes back to Aniruddha's reign. U Htwe Sein has recently done a neat job of excavating at the top of the cliff. But the site is complex, and the walls low; so it is difficult to say where the stone sculptures were originally sited, and even what was the original shape of the temple. Apart from a votive tablet showing 5 Earth-touching Buddhas (P1. 6i e), with a faint inscription in Old Mon on the obverse, nothing remarkable was found. Perhaps he will be luckier if he digs at the base of the cliff when the river is low. One feature common to all these early images is that while Indian motifs are adopted, and indeed welcomed, there is a strong local, native element in the style of representation. This is seen in the Paunggu sculptures no less than in the bronzes. Look at the human faces - attitudes - clothes - head- dress - instruments. There is a striking, and (to me) most interesting contrast between the Indian motif and the Burma treatment of it. By Kyanzittha's time, with all his vast numbers of sculptures, that contrast is rarely apparent. With the loss of a good deal of vigour and vitality, a compromise was reached - a rich, dignified, solemn and hieratic style, which henceforth governs most of Buddhist art in the plains of Burma. But in spite of the half-century between them, there is (I suspect) a debt which Nanda owes to Paunggu. The basement plinth of the former holds 552 terracotta plaques. These show, on the W. side, the various monsters (usually 2 on each plaque) of Mdra's army, who vainly attacked the Buddha on the eve of his Enlightenment. On the E. side, Devas and other mighty beings celebrate his triumph. Possibly - but the evidence is still, I admit, inadequate - some such pair of themes were first illustrated in the small stone sculptures of Paunggu. If so, the fierce Monkey-Men and the Bird-Elephants would be part of Mara's army; while the Drummers, Cymbalists and flute-playing Kinnaras would be participators in the Triumph. Good stone is rare at Pagan: so these sculptures are small - only about 12 to 14 in. in length, and 8 in. in height. The change to terracotta on the Nanda was doubtless inevitable. Much the same</page><page sequence="316">296 Chapter XIV change occurred in the illustration of Jitakas. The cross-passages of the Nanda contain a good number of Jdtaka-carvings in stone. These were rejected, it seems, by Kyanzittha in favour of ter- racotta plaques, which could be made large, and were cheaper and easier to work than stone, and, thanks to the bright green glaze with which he dressed them, better suited for exteriors. GU BIZAT TEMPLE (P1. I54) In the N.W. sector of the city, a furlong E. of P6bingyaung, W. of the road running N. from Ma- habodhi to the riverbank, there are two neglected 'Mon' temples, deep sunk in cowdung, called Gil Bizat. The larger one, Gi Bizat-gyi, is still, structurally, in fair condition, worthy of conservation. It has a 'bell' top and three sprawling terraces, roofs probably sloping, crenelated parapet, corner- pilasters, and ruined corner-stupas. If weignore later accretions, there was only one arched entrance, on the E., with a square perforated window near each corner of that face. The other faces had each 3 perforated windows, with horizontal caps and 5 X 5 square holes, the outer windows commanding the corridor within. There is a central Shrine (i2@ ft. broad by iol ft. deep) with broad vaulted en- trance on the E., and a tall perforated window (3 X 7 holes) on each side. The colossal Buddha sits under a painted Bodhi tree, Kinnaras perching near the shoulders. There is also a fine painted Buddha in the centre of the W. inner face of the Corridor. A good deal of dark painting remains on the walls, but none on the lean-to vault. We did not notice any old writing; but the gloom and the dirt dis- couraged search. The Corridor is broad (nearly 9 ft.), and runs round all four faces (over 50 ft. square without, and nearly 40 ft. within). There are many empty niches for images on both walls, 48 (Ithink) altogether. - It looks as if this is a 'Mon' temple of early symmetric, pre-Kyanzittha type. PASADA ZEDI (No. 789, called 'Hsinpyagu' on U Htw6 Sein's map) This great ruined temple (PI. I55) - somewhat similar to Gil Bizat-gyi in type - is outside the city- walls S. of the Man-aung group, W. of Lokahteikpan, N.E. of Penatha, on a road S. of the old central road. Its main mass (some 73 ft. square ?) supports a huge well-preserved gikhara, 96 ft. high, with 3 tiers of corbelled niches on each side. Below, on all four sides, is a broad - too broad a corridor with lean-to vaulting, now mostly fallen in. On the W. face, which was doubtless the front, the outer wall, including the entrance and the whole facade, has collapsed. The central mass has no ground- floor inner shrine: only 4 broad vaulted recesses (about 6 ft. deep and i2 ft. broad) for colossal Buddhas. One headless Earth-touching Buddha is still visible in the W. recess. There may be a small vaulted upper shrine below the gikhara (as the view from the west suggests): if so, it is possible that a staircase led up to it in the thickness of the outer wall. But this is quite doubtful. The N., S., and E. outer walls had each 5 vaulted archways over pedimented windows, the outer ones command- ing the corridor, the central one facing the recess. Such decoration as remains, especially the stucco edging of the recesses arching from the floor - pellet, cording, pellet, and intricate foliation - is typically 'Mon': short toransa, 5 receding horizontal tiers, climbing to a recessed karmnikd and stupa-finial, just below the cornice at the top of the high wall. 6 corbelled niches in 2 tiers flank each recess. There are no niches in the outer wall. This temple, too, is worth conserving as a ruin.</page><page sequence="317">Chapter XIV 297 MON' TEMPLE W. Of TAUNGBI TANK (P1. I56, I57) Not far beyond the N.E. corner of Pagan city-wall, on the W. side of Taungbi village, there is a circular brick tank. About ioo yards N.W. of this, at the top of a sloping millet field, is a group of small pagodas, the Mon temple in the middle facing east. It has a single entrance, now 'repaired' with corbel-arching. In i96i, while listing ink-inscriptions for the Burma Historical Commission, Aung Myat Kyaw and Bo Hlaing re-discovered it. They reported Old Mon writing on the walls. In nearly all respects this is a typical 'Mon' temple. It consists of a main square block (38 ft.), with a broad corridor on the four sides of a central mass; and a Hall of entrance on the east (I4 X i6 ft.). It is crowned with receding terraces and a 'bell 'stupa, now ravaged by treasure-hunters. Corner- stupas, if any, are lost. No 'frieze' is visible. There are corner-pilasters and cornice. The main block has two perforated windows each on the S., W., and N. sides. All have pediments (clec) with vertical spires and 3 X 4 perforations. Each of these faces had diamond-shaped openings (3 above, i in the centre below), giving light to the corridor and images within. There is no Shrine, but the square central mass has a deep recess on each side, holding a lotus throne and colossal Earth-touching Buddha. Mon Bo Kay points out to me that the central figure in the throne-band, as on several thrones in the Nanda shrines, is the three- headed Elephant (symbol of supreme wisdom ?), between lions with reverted heads, and dancers. The recess is crowned with a broad finely sculptured Mon clec-torin, arching from base to peak, with five receding horizontal roofs supporting an old-style stupa with double lotus, square-banded anda, recessed harmikd and tapering squared chattravali, reaching to the cornice - all very like the Pdsdda Ceti (supra). There are tall corner-pilasters with capitals. All the walls are covered with painting, including the recesses. These show halo and bodhi tree, architectural background with elaborate corner-shields, and two saints below in prayer or holding lotus-stems. In the W. recess Kinnaras, painted red, perch at shoulder- level. Eleven tiers of Buddhas (without glosses) are painted on this central mass; there is a floral band below, and Indra blowing his conch and Brahmd with closed umbrella standing on either side of the recess. The Corridor had a lean-to vault too broad for its weight. It has mostly fallen in on the S. side, where, curiously enough, the Jdtaka-glosses, now exposed to the elements, are still often legible below the mire, though illegible on the N. side, where the vault is intact. Cattle may have rubbed away the surface on this side. On each side of the entrance to the Corridor there is a tall trefoil niche, and three more, one each in the centre of the other faces. The large Hall has side-walls arching from the floor; the E. and W. walls are vertical, the latter not integrated with the main block, i.e. the temple proper. There is a high pointed window on each side, between two niches, these side-walls are thick, with deep stepped embrasures. The bricks in the main walls are large: i8 in. X 9 in. X 3 in. The inner entrance-arch is rounder than the others, with three orders of recession. The Hall is covered with dim paintings; there is no writing, I think, below the panels. At the top of the outer wall of the Corridor, there are 5 tiers of haloed Buddhas seated in dhar- maacakra mudra, a saint on each side. There is no writing below them. Then comes a band of floral arabesque; then 5 tiers of small Jdtaka panels (14 in. broad, I5j in. high) with Old Mon glosses below each. The series starts with the top tier, E. wall, S. of the entrance-arch. Here is a brief analysis of what we found on the four walls, and what (more or less) we could read: -</page><page sequence="318">298 Chapter XIV Top tier E. i wall 5 panels S. wall 15 W. i6 N. I4 E. 4 wall 7 Total 57. Jatakas 1-57. Legible 42 2nd tier 5 panels S. wall 12 W. 12 N. 12 5 46. 58-i03. 39 3rd tier 9 panels S. wall 24 W. 24 N. 24 9 90. ,, 104-193. ,, 55 4th tier 9 panels S. wall 24 W. 24 N. 24 9 ,, 90. | 9, 14-283. 37 5th tier Nothing legible (?) Glosses c. 173 legible. In the lower tiers, space in the niches is utilized, thus greatly increasing the number of panels. The floor at present is silted up high. If we may imagine 3 more tiers (5th, 6th and 7th) available at the base, it should provide space for 90 X 3 Jatakas, bringing the total to 553. But already on the N. wall of the entrance arch between Hall and Corridor, 3 of the later Jdtakas are provided for: Cit- tasambhfita (498/50I), Sivi (499/502), Sirimin pan-ha (500/503): no numbers are given, so we cannot say whether the Nanda numbering or that of the Hpetleik was followed. (The latter is more probable if the temple antedates the accession of Kyanzittha). Perhaps there were only 2 more bottom tiers, space being found elsewhere (query in the Hall?) for the odd 87 panels. There is room for 7 tiers altogether: but the bottom one would reach a point only 8 inches above the brick-paved floor. The writing is careful and accurate, not slovenly as in many of the later temples. The spelling tends to be archaic: thus "King", always written smin' in Kyanzittha's inscriptions, is here usually smen. And some Sanskritic forms seem to be preferred to Pali: dharmma to dhamma, prasnd to pan-ha, prdmokkha to pdmokkha. All these facts, and, most of all perhaps, the absence of any documentation other than the Jdtaka, cause me to date this temple earlier than Kyanzittha's reign. The first temple to reveal the wider Buddhist horizons, shown in the Singhalese texts (first got, I think, near the end of Aniruddha's reign), is the PRfhtothamya. If that great temple dates, as seems probable, near the end of Caw Lu's reign, this Taungbi temple should be dated rather earlier. The Archaeological Department has started to conserve it.</page><page sequence="319">CHAPTER XV EVOLUTION OF THE BURMA TEMPLE The 'Mon' temples - P~htothAmya. THE 'MON' TEMPLES Before we proceed to detail about the 'Mon' temples, let us cast an eye on the evolution of the Burma temple in general. We start with the solid Stfipa or Cetiya, which was essentially circular. Even the buttresses or terraces supporting it at grl Ksetra were normally round. The big change comes with the squaring of the circle: not by tampering with its shape, but by building it up from below, placing the square under it, usually with an octagon in between. The lotus mat on which the cetiya rests, with perhaps the dmalaka fruit below it or the Vaisnava Sikhara, remains circular and topmost; but as the squareness below grows larger, the circle above gets less. The square terrace invited decoration: in Aniruddha's pagodas usually Jdtaka plaques, lining the plinth in pockets, at first plain, then coloured. But 550 pockets were too many for the single terrace, and the unglazed plaques needed protection: so he added a low vaulted corridor, where the whole series could be fitted on both sides, and the pious visitor could combine study and pradaksina, heedless of sun or rain. Kyanzittha loved colour, and revived the Late Pyu art of glazing, as a better means both for protection and for show. By enlarging the Stupa, he found that three terraces sufficed to house the whole 550. Such methods we may call Extravert, intended for display. If Jdtakas were missing, both Pyu and Mon and Burman had long learnt to substitute the Four Buddhas of the present kalpa, seated back to back against a common pile, facing the four cardinal points. But the Mon, like the Indian, was more of an Introvert. He had been under Indian influence a thousand years longer than the Burman. Bhakti, and the need for Worship, moved him more than the need for Display. He pushed his image ever further back into the pile, until it sat alone in darkening splendour, with himself prostrate before it. Having learnt, perhaps from the Pyu, the art of the Pen- dentive, of intersecting arches, he could build vaulted Shrines and keep them dark and dry by means of perforated windows. At the same time he could satisfy Extravert desires by enriching the outer wall of his Shrine with grand plinth-mouldings, dado, pilasters, tall niches embossed with stucco carvings, crowned with frieze and cornice. He too, like the Extravert, felt the need for the pradaksina corridor: but marked its lesser status by employing only a lean-to vault, with the outer wall plain except for painting, while still maintaining all the embellishments of the inner wall. Soon, also, like the Indian, he felt the need for a man.dapa or Hall, where other images could be kept, or sermons preached, or alms given. Within the thick side-walls of the Hall a staircase could be built to reach the roof, or kamm~a((hdna cells hollowed for meditation. But the Hall stood always lower than the Temple, and though it leaned against the Temple face, it was not integrated with it .The masonry of each was separate. One entered the Temple proper only by crossing the great stone sill</page><page sequence="320">300 Chapter XV dividing Hall and Corridor. Here, at the inner archway, not the outer, stood the giant Guardians, the wooden lattice doors, the richest pediment. Shrine, Corridor walls, and Hall were thus nicely graded from the first, and all are generally present in the CMon' temples of Kyanzittha's time. Attempts, of course, were made by architects to impose unity on the asymmetric complex. The most successful means, seen in the later temples, Nanda and Dhammayan-gyi, was to build four Halls instead of one, with the four Buddhas at the centre. But several of the earlier buildings listed in the last chapter - Pitakat - taik, Myinpyagu, Gu Bizat and Pdsdda Ceti - prove that Symmetry was always at the base of the 'Mon' temple proper, and that the asymmetric appearance of the 'Mon' temples we are about to describe, is more apparent than real. In some of these, the Pahtothamya and Abeyadana in particular, the Hall is less essential than in others: such temples are seen best from back or side rather than from front. At the beginning of the last chapter, I divided Pagan temple-architecture into four main phases: - the second 'free phase' roughly coinciding with the reign of Aniruddha; the third, CMon" centred in Kyanzittha's reign (io84-iII3 A.D.); the fourth, plainly Burmese, from the accession of Canisfl II (Narapatisithu) in II74 A.D. In a broad sense we may call the whole middle period-from I057 A.D. (capture of Thaton) down to II74-the 'Mon' period; for temples of the third phase (which we must now consider) take off closely from those of the second. In the restricted sense the 'Mon' style centres in the temples of Kyanzittha's reign, but emerged a little earlier, in the Taungbi and Pghtothamya temples. In the transitional period after Kyanzittha's death (III3-II74 A.D.), there are temples of both 'Mon' and Burmese styles, the 'Mon' gradually yielding to, or merging in, the Burmese. I use the latter term with confidence; the former, 'Mon', with some hesitation and inverted commas. Right or wrong in its implications, it is at any rate a convenient label for a style quite distinctive. The old-style 'Mon' temple, as found at Pagan, is normally of one storey, and in plan apparently asymmetric. It consists, as we have said, of a square main block, the temple proper, containing a central Shrine or recess for images; a half-arched corridor (or corridors) surrounding it; and a vaulted Hall (with the only means of entrance) on one side. The main block is always dark, for the windows (2 to 5 on each of the other sides) are of perforated stone or brick. Even the Corridor is dim; and the Shrine containing the colossal image would often be pitch-dark, if it were not for one, or three, sky- lights casting mysterious rays on the face of the Buddha. Such temples, if not ruined, have nearly always Old Mon writing, never Old Burmese. The taste for dim religious light may have owed something, perhaps, to the basic meaning of guMh - a secret place", with all its metaphysical connotations in philosophic India. It owed more, I sus- pect, to the romantic and poetic temperament of Old Mons, who, like the painters of AjanIta, wanted to live in the immediate presence of their Holy Ones. The Old Burman, a more earthy and prosaic person, as soon as he began to control the building, cleared the perforated windows, drove out the bats, opened large doorways on each face, and placed the main Shrine high above him on a platform, which soon became an upper storey. The great difference in style between Old Mon and Old Burmese inscriptions confirms my view of this temperamental difference. The doubt is whether one is right in calling this style of architecture</page><page sequence="321">Chapter XV 30I 'Mon'. Burmese historians, of course, freely acknowledge the great debt of Paga'n art to that of Thaton. One of the principal features of these temples, which Kyanzittha, by his frequent references to it, clearly regarded as of great importance, was the clec or pediment over arch or window. Clec is a pure Mon word, not Indian, nor Burmese (though borrowed), nor (so far as we can judge) Pyu. And there are several other Mon words connected with architecture which have passed into Old Burmese., The Mon clec is found early, but not often, at grl Ksetra.2 It becomes an essential feature of Pagan architecture from Kyanzittha onwards. Before him it is none too common at Pagan. It is not found on PNbingyaung, nor on the older parts of Kyaukku Ohnmin, nor at Myinpyagu. In archaic form it crowns the central recess in Nat-hlaung-gyaung. At Pahtothamya it is found on the Hall, but not on the ground floor of the temple proper. It appears first in all its glory on the Nanpaya, a temple attributed to the captured king of Thaton. It is there closely associated with Kydk SrT, the goddess Laksmi, Visnu's wife, and with Makara, Visnu's ear-ornament. The same temple has 8 large figures of Brahmd. Such Brahmanic figures are typical of coastal Lower Burma and the Mon country. Pagan at first had closer contact, it seems, with N. Arakan and E. Bengal. The Pyu of Prome, lying in between, felt the influence of both. Kyanzittha - a lover of Mon, a uniter of Mon, Pyu and Burman - standardized Pagan architecture by fusing the Mon clec finally onto the Pyu/Burmese vaulted temple. But if we would call the resultant style 'Mon', where is the Mon original to be found? - The late Pierre Dupont found not one single radiating arch in the Mon art of Dvdravatf (Siam).3 It has not yet been found at Thaton. In I9I3-I4 the late Dr. J. A. Stewart excavated a vaulted shrine with four pendentives within the walls of Old Pegu.4 East of the old city near Kamanat, Theinbyu pagoda still shows evidence of vaulting. But neither of these bear much resemblance in plan to the 'Mon' temples of Pagan. The vaulted chapels of Sri Ksetra, on the other hand, though small, are clear prototypes of Pagan architecture: - the B6b6 (perhaps the oldest, 7th century A.D.) - a plain vaulted cella with crude groining;5 the L6myet-hna - central solid pier and vaulted corridor on all four sides, with four entrances ;6 the East Zegu - Shrine and Hall, a masterpiece of (perhaps) 8th century vaulting.7 There are other Pyu temples too, now roofless. One is in "Saw Maung's mound at Shw6-gyobin village. The structure brought to light is the remains of a square building of brick measuring 36 ft. within. The inner chamber is surrounded by a 3 ft. wide corridor with a doorway on the south, which is also 3 ft. wide".8 This type -Shrine and Corridor surrounding it-is pretty close to the plan of the 'Mon' temples of Paga6n. If so, why not call this type of temple 'Pyu' rather than 'Mon'? - Partly because the writing within is Mon, never Pyu. Mainly, perhaps, because the Pyu (who never seem to repeat themselves in temple- architecture) show no preference for this plan as against others; whereas the early Pagan builders used it over a score of times, counting only extant examples. If they did not invent the type, they may 1 See J.B.R.S. Vol. XXX, Part i (I940). p. 306, n. 36; XLII, Part I (I959) pp. I02-5. 2 See the Kanbyin Gate and Nat-yaukkya-g6n megaliths (Arch. Neg. 776 of i909-io, and 2886 of I926-27). 3 See his remarks on this subject at L'Archeologie Mone de Dvaravati (Paris, I959), Texte, p. I25. It was quite wrong, however, to say that the radiating arch was not used in Burma monasteries. Every single kul/kloo at Pagan refutes this: they include some of the largest of our vaulted spans. 4 "Excavation and Exploration in Pegu", J.B.R.S. Vol. VII, Part i (I9I7), pp. I7-i8.

And finally, can we be sure that the Pyu builders were still living and working at Paga'n around IIOO A.D.? Or would the term be almost an anachronism? In view of the difference in yearly rainfall between Prome and the coast - Prome 47 inches, Pegu I27, Thaton 2i6 - may it not be an accident that vaulted temples survive at Prome and not at Thatonn? And again, in view of the contacts between Burma and Bengal from the 7th century, may not East Bengal (with one of the heaviest rainfalls in the world) have provided the original model, both for Pyu and Mon? For I find it difficult to accept the view, proposed both by Marchal and Dupont,9 that keystone vaulting reached Burma "from China or Central Asia". At Pagan, as at Sri Ksetra, the broad surface of the brick is always laid parallel to the arch-face, never as in Han dynasty tombs,'0 at right angles to it. The Burma method is no doubt the same (as de BeyliU pointed out)1' as that in Central Asia. The common source (if Burma did not invent it independently) is likely to have been India. The 'Mon' temples of Paga'n, in spite of all their beauty, show that the builder (whoever he was) was less expert than the Pyu in vaulting. Though never emphasizing the keystone or keybrick with bosses, he was good enough at groining the four pendentives of a shrine up to the peak. But when he had to build a broad archway at the entrance of the Hall or temple proper, the central order or orders of the arch were usually of wood, fossilwood or stone; and here great doors of wooden lattice may be added. The elaborate plinth, pilasters, dado, cornice and carved niches on the inner wall of the Corridor (really the outer wall of the Shrine), point to the fact that the latter, a mere Cella, was once the original temple, exposed to the air on all four sides. The pradaksitna Corridor and Hall were added later: the Hall with side-walls arching from the floor, and leaning against, not interlocking with the original facade; the Corridor, a broad lean-to half-vault, ending on top of the original cornice. Its roof was just ogee, following the curve of the half-vault. As a result of this weak vaulting, under stress of earthquake, most of the Mon temples are in ruin, the lean-to corridor-vault having fallen in on all sides, perhaps, except the front, where the two masses of Shrine and Hall help to buttress it. The Old Burmans, who learnt so much from the Mons, were quick to learn from Mon mistakes. Few of the later temples of Minnanthu and Pwazaw are structurally unsound. Where they failed (a not inglorious failure) was in the Brick Monasteries. PAHTOTHAMYA TEMPLE (Pis. 158-i67). This lovely brick temple, in form perhaps the most beautiful of all the 'Mon' temples of Pagan, stands inside the city near the S. wall, on the W. side of Nat-hlaung-gyaung. The Chronicles attribute it to Caw Rahan,'2 who may have died c. IOOO A.D. The attribution must be rejected: for not only is the temple full of Old Mon writings, but its paintings are clearly based on numerous texts of the Singh- alese Tipitaka, which could hardly have reached Pagatn till near the end of Aniruddha's reign.

He appears to argue that Pahtothamya was built by Mant Lulai, i.e. Caw Lu, Aniruddha's son and successor.14 If I hesitate to accept all the steps in his argument, I readily accept the conclusion: for while the evi- dence suggests that it is not the work of Kyanzittha, it is pretty certainly the immediate parent of Kyanzittha's temples. I propose a date c. io8o A.D. The temple faces East. The three doorways of the large Hall have prominent arch-pediments. There is also a grand inner one of carved stucco, on the way to the Shrine. There are no other clec on the temple proper, not even above the perforated windows. This would be strange if the builder were Kyanzittha. But the position, size and content of the temple, quite apart from its artistic eminence, show it to be royal. The staircase climbs east from the N. doorway of the Hall. The first glory of the temple is its exterior. Its plinth-moulding, the noblest in Pagan,15 derives from the profile of a simple pot. Each of the three plain sides of the main block projects a medial bay with perforated window; on each side of the bay are two more windows. All are of plain brick, with holes square or round, rather more tall than broad. There is no reliance for effect on stone or stucco decor- ation. Such surface beauties as the temple had, are mostly lost. The windows, which are perfect, have no more ornament than three flat orders of recession. There are no pediments nor frieze nor dado. The bare pilasters are important, but are too faint to catch the eye. Few of these gu have suffered more from time's rough finger, blurring and blotching edge and cope and finial. It matters little: for its proportions, great and small, are so just that it can scale and shale and still be beautiful. The master-stroke of the architect was his decision to project these medial bays (like those of Myin- pyagu), and build out large medial gal above them, matching the square-framed medial skylights of the top terrace. Not only did this make the union of these fronts organic: but by transferring emphasis above to the centres rather than the corners, not dwarfing the latter but granting them their strength and denying them their dominance, he gave his roof a grand perspective, kept the majesty of the cube and yet achieved the richness of the polygon. Enforcing this, he designed a simple but unique Sikhara, a dodekahedron. The chattrdvalT is like that of Abeyadana, but has I2 sides instead of 8. The plinth below it also is twelve-sided, descending into square with two recessions on each side. And the main dome, with twelve broad foliated ribs rising up and over it, both bulges to a ridge at the four corners, and presents a square retreating frontage to each face. The way was then open to enrich the roof, the Buddha's diadem (jatdmitkuta). The roof of the Hall is broad and flat. The two upper roofs are sloping. The corners of the lowest terrace are broken by round stupas embossed against their sides. Below, there is a continuum of large crenelles. The second terrace has a parapet of large round pots with cornice-band of lotus flowers. The third terrace has as plinth small frames of inset square urns, with gnomons of stucco scrollwork at the corners, and round urns above as parapet. The top terrace has only the medial skylights, and ruined tiers retreating on the dome. The medial gu of the lowest terrace, and the dormer skylights above and behind them, are arched within, but square-framed without, like all the windows below them, so as not to squander in flamboyance the soaring lines of the pyramid. Each miniature roof-shrine harbours a Buddha throned 13 A.S.I. I930-34, Part I, pp. I92-3; Part II, PI. CXI e. 14 A.S.I.

The medial gu above the back of the Hall is larger than the others. 'Pghtothamya' appears to mean 'Pagoda with many children.' - The title may serve to indicate its second glory - that of Pioneer in spreading the gospel of Singhalese Buddhism. Before it was built, there is no evidence that Pagan had more than hearsay knowledge of the deeper truths of Buddhism or the vast field of the Tipitaka. It may well have known more of Tantric Mahaydnism and Brahman- ism than of the Theravdda. The Jdtaka Commentary was already familiar, and of course the Eight Scenes. But even the Life of the Buddha is not much illustrated beyond thesein the sculptures of Kyaukku Onhmin. And if the endless rows of Preaching and Earth-touching Buddhas in the Taungbi temple and Myinpyagu, are meant to illustrate particular Suttas, there is no gloss below them to prove it. They seem rather to serve as devotional wallpaper, proper for fixing the mind in the presence of the Master. From the Pnhtothamya onwards all this is changed. During the next generation the pendulum of purpose will swing from Devotion to Instruction. If I am right in arguing that, apart from the Jdtaka, little in thewayof texts couldreach Paga'n till after I070 A.D., when,withthe help of monks from Burma, Vijayabdhu I set about reviving Buddhism in Ceylon, scholars at Pagan had had little time, by io8o A.D., to acquaint themselves with primary Buddhist texts, written in an unknown script and little known language. We can but admire their devotion, industry and accurate scholarship. We may guess that they first studied texts of the Vinaya, the Discipline of the Order; and then went on to the Suttanta, first the Digha, then the Majjhima Nikdya. Meantime, with the help of the Niddnakathd and other texts, they greatly enlarged their knowledge of the life of Gotama, both before the Enlighten- ment and after. All these themes are abundantly illustrated, for the first time, in paintings on the walls of Pghtothamya. These facts are confirmed by hundreds of ink-glosses, not all of which are legible, but more than enough to prove that the matter, order and naming of the various sikkhdpada of the Vinaya follow closely the Singhalese Canon; so do the matter, order and naming of the various Suttas of the first two Nikdyas. There is also a short text about Padumuttara Buddha, which we have not been able to locate. We can do little more at present than indicate the position on the walls of scenes, whose glosses we were able to read and identify. Scenes from the life of Gotama fill the main panels on the outer wall of the Corridor, excluding the bays. On the S., W., and N. sides there are two windows on each side of the central bays, also a niche between the bay and the nearest window. On the E. side there is only one window near each corner, and two niches between it and the entrance. There is room for 6 panels on each wall. All are of equal height (3 ft. 8 in.). They vary in breadth: broad between windows (about 6 ft. 8 in.), narrow where niches intervene (4 to 5 ft.). I number the panels I to 24: - E. Wall, S. of entrance arch.

Glosses under panels 2I-24 are illegible. On the inner side of the Corridor, East wall, there are 6 panels, over 6j ft. high and 5 ft. broad. On the S. side of the Shrine-entrance, the scenes may be the first sitting under the Bodhi tree (Brahma visible on the left); the Twin Miracles; and the Descent from Thvatirhsa. On the N. side the inner panel shows the Parinirvdna. There are 6 panels also on the W. wall, and 8 each on the S. and N. walls (subjects not clear)16. Above these freehand carefully-painted panels there are tiers of smaller panels (4 tiers on the outer wall, 5 on the inner), showing only Buddhas seated between saints. On the N. and S. sides of the Hall, too, are 7 similar rows, i9 panels in each row and 7 rows on each side of the entrance-arch. These are just conventional, and have no glosses below them. Scenes from the Buddha's life7 with glosses, are resumed in the Shrine, on the lowest tier of panels with writing, well above eye-level. Will the reader kindly turn to the Plan of the temple shown at PI. i6i b? -The Shrine, it will be seen, is divided roughly into two halves, at the side-windows giving onto the bay-windows of the Corridor. The part E. of this, we call the Front of the Shrine. The 16 I am not sure whether this was the original arrangement. Evidence on the W. inner wall suggests that originally there were simple corbelled niches for images, three on each side of the centre; and that shortly afterwards these were closed, and large Buddha-panels of painting took their place. These did not include, at PAhtothAmya, illus- trations of the assault and flight of Mara's army - a theme usually assigned to the back inner wall of the Corridor in 'Mon' temples. Note that the roofing of the Hall was less porous than the roughcast roofs of Kyanzittha's reign: for 'Sun-god' tondoes still cover half the ceiling above the top floral band. 17 Fuller details of all these scenes, with references, can be found in Dr. G. P. Malalasekera's Dictionary of Pali Proper Names (2 vols. London, 1937). See, e.g., s.v. Gotama (Vol. T, pp. 788-8io). 20</page><page sequence="326">306 Chapter XV recessed part to the W., containing the three colossal images, the central one reaching almost to the roof, we call the N. and S. Recess. The last panel on the outer wall of the Corridor may have shown the Enlightenment. The first panel in the Shrine appears to continue the story with the First Sermon in the Deer-park at Sdrnath: - 25. N. Recess, N. wall, W. of window: "Our Lord stays in the Deer-park. Assaji and his companions become Saints." 26. N. Recess, N. wall, E. of window: "Our Lord stays in the Kol [Koliya] forest." The 30 young Bhaddivaggi ("Good Companions") attain one or other of the Three States ('Stream-winner', 'Once- returner', or 'Non-returner'). 27. N. Recess, E. wall: "Our Lord comes to keep his promise to king Bimbasar. Uruvela Kds [Kdsyapa] floats in the sky" . . . The Buddha preaches to Bimbisdra. 28. Front of Shrine, N.

Wall, S.E. corner: He "preaches the Law at Veluvan [Bamboo Grove near Rdjagaha]. All 8 ministers [sent from Kapilavatthu] become Saints." 33. Front of Shrine, S. Wall, S.E. corner: The same story, continued. 34. Front of Shrine, S. Wall, S.W. corner: The final envoy of Suddhodana, Uddyi Ther [Kaluddyi] conveys his message to the Buddha at Rajagaha. 35. S. Recess, E. wall (See PI. i67 b): The Buddha returns to Kapilavatthu, and performs the Twin Miracle before Suddhodana and the princes of the Sdkyan clan. For further scenes from the life of the Buddha, one has to climb to the topmost legible tier of glosses in the Shrine. Here, in the N. recess, W. wall, above the reredos of the side-Buddha, there are 5 small panels with legible glosses, showing: (i) "the novice Cunda", younger brother of Sdriputta. (ii) " Uppalavanna Theri", one of the two chief women-disciples of the Buddha. (iii) "KisagotamiT Theri", distracted with grief at the death of her son, was converted by the Buddha. (iv) "Cfila Andthapin", the wealthy lay-disciple who fed the multitude at Sdvatthi waiting for the Buddha's descent from Thvatiihsa. (v) "DharanT Upj" - Is this Updli gahapati? Or Vinayadhara Updli Thera? Query Gharanf uqplsika? At the same level, on the N. wall of the N. Recess, there is a series of panels leading up to, and beyond, the performance of the Great Miracles at Savatthi: - (vi) "This is when the Rev. Ananda gives".... "...to the Buddha." (vii) "This is when our Lord with water pot... Ganda's Mango (?)". (viii) "This is when our Lord enjoys the juice of the Mango." (ix) ".. buries the seed of the Mango." (x) "This is when our Lord washes his hands above the seed of the Mango." Four panels follow without writing. Then, on the E. wall: - (xi) "This is when the Buddha ascends and preaches the Law in Thvatiihsa. The lord Moggalldn explains the Law afterwards to the congregation of the four castes."</page><page sequence="327">Chapter XV 307 Two panels follow with fragmentary glosses; and this appears to be all that is legible on this highest tier. There may well have been other tiers above it, now flaked. Ignoring a possible intermediate line with practically nothing legible, we come to the 2nd tier (originally, perhaps, the top main tier), with illustrations of the Vinaya, Sutta Vibhatga'8. I suspect that it started on the W. wall, from the S.W. corner of the Shrine, with the 4 Pdrajikd offences, involving "Defeat" and expulsion from the Order. This would be followed, N. of the centre of this wall, with the I3 Sailghddisesa rules - for offences requiring a "Formal Meeting of the Order". The first clearly legible gloss is under the ioth of these1. Here are specimens: - 2nd Tier, N. Recess, N. Wall (4th panel from N.W. corner) - "The Buddha was staying at Veluvan" (near Rdjagaha). "With reference to Devadat, he laid down the Sanghabheda sagighddises (rules con- cerning a schism in the Order)." - H. I, pp. 296-303. ibid. (5th panel) - "The Buddha was staying at Veluvan. With reference to the Rev ........... (he laid down) the Safghabheddnuvattaka" (rules concerning the followers of a schism in the Order). - H.I, pp. 3044. ibid. (6th panel) - "The Buddha was staying at Ghositdrdm" (Ghosita's monastery in Kosambi). "With reference to the Rev. Chan, he laid down the Dubbaca satghddises" (rules concerning the Obstinate). - H.I. pp. 309-3I3. ibid. (7th panel) - "The Buddha was staying at Jetavan" (at Sdvatthi). "With reference to the Rev. Assuji and Punabbasu, he laid down the Kiilddfisa sagighudises, the i3th rule concerning offences requiring a meeting of the Order". - H.I. pp. 3I4-327. ibid. (8th panel) - "The Buddha was staying at Jetavan. With reference to the Rev. Uddyi. Patha- maniyat", (i.e. the ist Aniyata sikkhdpada, 'Undetermined case Rule'). - H.T, pp. 330-5. ibid. (9th panel) - " ............ (with reference to) the Rev. Uddyi who sat with a certain woman, the Buddha laid down the 2nd Aniyat." - H., I. pp. 336-9. ibid. (ioth panel - "The Buddha was staying at ............. He laid down the ist nisaggi", i.e. Nissaggiya offences, involving "Forfeiture". - H. II, pp. i-II. N. Recess E.

It is evident that the painters of Pahtothamya used a text strictly corresponding (apart from minor differences of spelling) with the modern Singhalese and Burmese Vinaya: The i3 chapters of Saighddisesa Kanda are followed by the 2 chapters of Aniyata Kanda20; then the 30 of Nissaggiya Kanda; and the 92 of Pdcittaya Kanda (offences involving "Expiation"). There are legible glosses for about half of the 30 Nissaggiya. They end on the 3rd tier: - 18 For the English translation of the Vinaya, see I. B. Horner, The Book of the Discipline (Vinaya Pitaka), 6 vols. (Luzac, 1938-66), Pali Text Society (Sacred Books of the Buddhists, Vols. X, XI, XIII, XIV, XX, XXV) - I refer to these volumes below as H. I, H. II, etc. 1s H. I, pp. 296-303. 20 Miss Horner's first volume of translation ends with the two Aniyata chapters. Her second volume includes all the Nissaggiya and the first 6o of the Pacittiya. 20*</page><page sequence="328">308 Chapter XV 3rd tier. N.

Not all the 92 Pccit are illustrated. There is evidence to show that the panels continue along the N. and E. walls of the N. Recess, then cross to the S. Recess. The ioth Pdcit is reached on the E. wall in the S.E. corner, ending vaggo pathamno, i.e. the ist Chapter (Musdvdda Vagga). The i2th pdcit is probably shown on the S. wall. Perhaps the whole Vinaya section of the painting ended on this wall at the S.W. corner. The three skylights or stepped windows, which throw light on the faces of the colossal Buddhas from E., S., and N., have also thrown a stream of water, whenever it rains, down the middle of those faces, cutting three broad furrows through all these panels and glosses. On the E. Wall, Front of the Shrine, a floral band crosses the whole wall just above the top of the great entrance-arch. Above this, only i long tier survives, with glosses legible on the N. side: - "This is when the lord Buddha Padumuttar made Parinirvdna. The reverend Mhakas (Mihdkassapa) offered in worship a plantain-leaf banner (?, tban), a ceremonial spear (Ijehh), and a vase (klas). The reverend thera, Khadiravaniya Revata (Revata of the Cutch Forest), had ferried the lord Buddha Pad umuttar in a boat ............. The lord Buddha Padumuttar blossomed (into Buddhahood)... ..... Padumuinttar ....... by Punna, son of MantanT. Punna came (?) ..............." - These incidents are not mentioned in the Buddhava'sa.21 On the tier below this, we find a series of panels and glosses relating to the Dfgha Nikdya, which has 34 Suttas.22 The series probably started on the N. wall of the Front of the Shrine, from the N.E. corner. Here are a few specimens: - Front of Shrine. E. Wall, below floral band, on N. side of entrance-arch. N.E. corner: - (8th Sutta) "........ came and asked a question. Sihandda sut." (9th Sutta) "The Buddha was staying at Jetavan ...... The wandering ascetic Puddhapdtha came and asked a question. Puddhapdtha sut.'" (ioth Sutta) "In the house of the young brahman Subha, the reverend Ananda together with a company of monks ............ (Subha) sut." (iith Sutta) "The Buddha was staying in Pdva(rika) ......... Kevat(tha)sut." The series continues on the S. side of the entrance-arch (Makagovinda slut No. i9). Then on the S. wall (Pdtika sut No. 24; Udumbarika sut No. 25). It then crosses to the lower (3rd) tier on the N. wall, Front of Shrine, and ends near the N.E. corner (Dasuttara sot, No. 34). 21 Khuddaka Nikdya, Buddhavamisa, Ch. I2. See Malalasekera, II, p. 478 (Mahakassapa); ibid. pp. 752-4 ('Revata of the Cutch Forest'): - "In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Revata was a boatman at Payaga on the Ganges, and once took the Buddha and his thousand followers across the river in a boat decked with canopies, flowers, etc.... s; the references given are to Theragdthd Commentary, I. io8, and the Manorathapfiranf, I, I26; ibid. p. 222 (Punna-Mantaniputta; for his worship of Padumuttara, the reference given is to Theragiathd Commentary, 37ff.). 22 The Dfgha Nikaya in Pali (Roman type) has been published in 3 vols. by the Pali Text Society. There are also reprints (I947-9 and i965-6) of the English translation in 3 vols. by T. W. Rhys Davids etc. Suttas I to I3 form Vol. I, 14-23 Vol. II, 24-34 Vol. III.</page><page sequence="329">Chapter XV 309 It is followed immediately on the E. wall, by the Majjhima Nikdya, which has 152 Suttas.23 Here are a few key points, indicating the arrangement: - Frontt of Shrine.

Recess, probably starting from the N.W. corner. It reappears in glosses on this face, near the N.E. corner: - N. Recess. N. wall (between window and N.E. corner). - Vammika sut No. 23. ,, ',,Y E. wall (from N.E. corner of Recess) - Rathavinfta sut No. 24. Nivipa sut No. 25, etc. The series continues, with only a few gaps, round the Front of the Shrine, to the S. Recess, E. and S. walls. Probably it ended in the S.W. corner. The last gloss we could read on the S. wall was (A ttha)- kandgara sutt, No. 52. The tier below this, giving scenes from the life of the Buddha, has been dealt with above. Before leaving this Mother of Theravdda temples, so full of beauty without and scholarship within, spare a glance at some remarkable Sikharas on the inner wall of the Corridor: the ones above the windows in the S. and N. walls (PI. i64 a), the other above the central niche in the W. wall (PI. i64 b). They are unique. Note also the wooden lintels in nearly all window-embrasures. And one final apology. Climbing with difficulty these dark high coigns, Col. Ba Shin and I could do little but try and read the broken lines of frittered gloss. The time for describing or judging the quality of the painting is yet to come. The first necessity is to find a means to pump in cement between the painted surface and the brick wall, and so to fix the former before it safely can be cleaned. The lowest panels, showing the life of the Buddha, impress me as rich and deep in colour, and sometimes grand in design: but distant and dim and vague until the work of fixing and cleaning is accomplished. Such suspended judgement applies particularly to P~htothamya, which set the standard in painting for the later temples. 23 The Majjhima Nikdya in Pali has been published in 3 vols. by the Pali Text Society (i887-I902). A translation, also in 3 vols., by Miss I. B. Horner, has been published: "The Collection of the Middle Length Sayings" (Luzac, London, I954-59), 50 suttas in each.</page><page sequence="330">CHAPTER XVI KYANZITTHA'S REIGN (i084-III3 A.D.), I. Tharaba gate - Nagay6n - Abeyadana. A distinguished western architect was leaving Burma after years of service. He had never shown much interest in pagodas; and I suggested that before leaving for good, he ought at least to visit Pagan. He did so, for a few days; and on his return I asked him how he liked it. "Wedding-cake architecture!" was his reply. When I pressed him to explain, I gathered that he thought the temples looked nice outside, but had nothing of interest inside them. The criticism is wrong: but it is often held by westerners; and owing to the neglect of centuries, and the appalling vandalism of those who blot out fine old fresco and drown stuccowork in whitewash, and call it a work of merit so to 'repair' a pagoda, the criticism is not surprising. The object of our final chapters is to show, by detailed report on some principal temples of our period, what in fact they do, or did, contain. The inventory, even of these, will not be complete. For most are dark and high, and the walls flaked and ruinous. Without step-ladders, bamboo scaffolding, and strong lamps, Col. Ba Shin and I could not in most cases have discovered what we have. Fortunately, many of these temples have, or had, writing in Old Mon, identifying the painted scenes. I read many of these glosses thirty years ago, when they were better preserved than they are now. The Burma Historical Commis- sion hopes to publish the more important ones, which add, incidentally, to our knowledge of this fine old language. THARABA (Sarapd) GATE (PI. i68). Now in ruin, it was the main East Gate of Paga'n. The name is thought to derive from Sans- krit sarva, "all" - an abbreviation, perhaps, of some such title as sarvasatritmnardana, "crushing all enemies". If we are right (as we argue below) in thinking that the present gate is the work of Kyan- zittha, the Sanskrit name would be due to his known fondness for conferring learned titles on works of merit which he built. The common people, not understanding them, would retain only the first syllables. At present, in front of both sides of the gateway, are the high-vaulted shrines and brick and stucco images of Mt. Popa's Mahdgiri spirits, Brother ('Maung daw') on the south, and Sister ('Hnama daw') on the north.' These shrines half-hide Paga'n dynasty stucco-work on corner-pilasters and capitals - 1 For their macabre story, see Glass Palace Chronicle (transl.), pp. 45-46. Note, incidentally, that a different "guardian spirit for Pagan city-gate, Sarapd" is mentioned under variant names in the Chronicles, as wounded in the "war of Spirits" that synchronized with the disastrous battle of Ngahsaungchan (Dec. I283 A.D.). His name is given as 1&lt;a Tapd:Sak by U Kala (Vol. I, p. 300); as Tepasah in the Hmannan (Susodhita Vol. I, P. 36i; G.P.C. p. I74). The latter cites also the name SathpasaA as given in the "New Chronicle" (Yazawinthit of Twinthin Ma- hasithu).</page><page sequence="331">Chapter XVI 3II kfrtimukha frieze, cord-mouldings, climbing lotus petals, fig leaf and pellet beading - similar to that found on Mon temples of Kyanzittha's time. It seems, therefore, that the shrines are post-Pagan accretions to a Pagan gateway. Excluding the Shrines, the ruined gate has a length of about 50 ft. on either side of the roadway, and a similar breadth across it. Two vertical towers stand at the outer, and two at the inner ends, each probably about I5 ft. square in plan. Their height was over 25 ft. (the present maximum). Joining the outer and the inner towers was a central recess, about 24 ft. square, arching from the ground, and once vaulted at the top, horizontal and vertical courses alternating in the brick work. The breadth of passage between the towers was I5 ft.; between the recessed sides 24; ft. We may guess that once the outer towers were joined across the roadway by wooden beams as lintels; so also the inner towers. Down the roadway sides of the outer towers there is still a vertical groove, about 2A ft. broad, through which some sort of portcullis was once raised or lowered. It is not likely that this elaborate gate, with almost temple embellishments, could date back to 850 A.D., when the city-wall was built.2 Col. Ba Shin has noticed its general similarity, not merely in stucco-decoration, to the four Nagayon enclosure-gateways, built by Kyanzittha about I090 A.D. There is the same vaulted interior, with lintel-arching at back and front. Kyanzittha came to the throne in I084 A.D., after defeating the rebel Nga Raman and relieving the besieged city. It is likely enough that the old city-gate suffered severely during the long siege; and that Kyanzittha's first duty, as a soldier-king, was to rebuild the gateway on a more worthy scale. NAGAYON TEMPLE (Pls. i84-206) Handsomest, and in some ways best-preserved of these 'Mon' temples, the Nagayon stands, facing north towards the city, at the top of the high ground S. of Myinpagin, on the E. side of the road. The legend, as given in the Chronicles,3 is as follows: - "Once when Saw Lu was wroth with him, and his prosperity and followers were forfeited, king Hti-hlaing-shin [Kyanzittha] slept alone in a grazing- ground for horses; and while he slept a young NMga came and watched over him. At that place, when he became a king, he built the Nagayon pagoda." Nagayon means 'over-spread by a serpent.' The temple, I think, should be dated early in Kyanzittha's reign, c. I090 A.D., perhaps after the building of Shwezigon, while the revision of the Tipitaka was in progress. It is full, as we shall see, of orthodox Theravdda of the Singhalese school. "This building" says Taw Sein Ko, "is the prototype of the Ananda."4 It is a large temple (I37 X 821 ft.), carefully built, mostly of brick; but there are stone 'bricks' spaced regularly along the voussoirs, and at intervals in the wall-masonry (P1. i90 a, b, c). There is glazed paving, both of brick and stone. The large enclosure-wall is still in good condition, with sunk crenelle-facings on both sides, and four great gateways, one in the centre of each face. (P1. I89 a, b, c).

Each gateway-roof has four small corner-stupas, and in the centre three indented low receding terraces, and a sort of dmalaka. with tapering chattrdvali. Inside, each gate has a cella arched with four pendentives, filled with tondoes of large lotus. The arched niches to left and right hold Bodhisattva Guardians, seated in pose of royal pastime. Short arched halls extend at entrance and exit. In the angles of the main enclosure-wall stand four shapely stupas. There is a low inner wall or parapet of brick. The temple itself has the usual grouping of Hall, dark Corridor, and Shrine, with 5 brick perforated windows faced with clec toranas on all three sides of the main block. Above, there are sloping roofs and three terraces with lessening corner-stupas, a gikhara with three tiers of trefoil niches, and a stupa- finial. Medial stupa-skylights on the second terrace admit light from three sides into the central Shrine. Roofs are all sloping, with low crenelle-lines, pranked out at the corners with green-glazed facings. The Hall has three entrances, and a long rolling roof, divided at the sides with a parapet, and warped upwards at the ends. Double-pedimented gables crown the main N. entrance, the clec behind rising over the clec in front. Carved wooden lintels (P1. i9i) cross the main doorway, also that of the Shrine, also the entrance and exit arches of the enclosure-gateways. The pockets of the three upper terraces have squared glazed tiles, also the sides of the Hall-roof. Within the inner enclosure-wall the floor is of glazed brick. Masonry is neat and good, vertical courses alternating with horizontal. Plinth- mouldings are simple. Stucco was of poor quality, but probably good design (P1. i89 d). Cornice- facings and kfrtimukha frieze are largely lost. The five windows on each side are weak; but their bases break pleasantly through the main plinth, forming little bays (P1. i87 d, e, f). Ornament, as a whole, touched with colour, shows a refined simplicity and restraint. Hall, Corridor and Shrine are paved with green-glazed stone flags. The side-walls of the Hall arch from the floor, and also the outer wall of the Corridor. The Hall has Io niches, 2 on each side of the small side-doorways, and I on each side of the main entrance: all but one still hold painted stone reliefs of the life of the Buddha. Against the S. wall, on each side of the archway, gigantic brick and stucco 'Guardians' stand in haunched tribhaitga pose. The inner arch is simpler and narrower than usual. This is a Theravada temple almost wholly: but Mon Bo Kay has detected a Mahdydnist painting in the archway between Hall and Corridor, on the W. wall. Here, under the whitewash, is a large panel showing a Tard standing (?) in the centre, between two crowned Bodhisattvas. At the N.W. and N.E. corners of the Corridor, stairs lead up through the corner-stupas to the roof. Cinquefoil arched niches line the Corridor-walls, 8 on each side of the E., S. and W. corridors; 8 on the outer side, and 4 on the inner side of the N. - 6o altogether, or 70 including those of the Hall: an important storehouse of Pagan sculpture. The inner wall of the Corridor shows, as usual, a fine plinth-moulding, cornice and corner-pilasters. In the low central band of the plinth, as in Abaeyadana, there are painted figures of dancers, male and female, drummers, cymbalists, players on percussion instruments (see, e.g., the E. corridor, near the S.E. corner): here they are not single, as in Abeyadana, but in groups, the groups divided by diamond panels. The corridor-arch is a lean-to half-arch, disappearing behind the cornice of the inner-wall. Between Corridor and Shrine there is a big glazed stone sill as threshold. E. and W. windows giving on the Shrine permit a vista-view across the heart of this temple, and admit more light than these 'Mon' shrines usually allow. The Shrine holds 3 colossal standing Buddhas of brick and stucco, gilded (P1. 192 a). The height of the central one, excluding the lotus-pedestal, is</page><page sequence="333">Chapter XVI 3I3 I8 ft. 4 in. That of the other two is over I2 ft. The central Buddha, cased in Naga hoods, has hands obviously repaired. Originally - like the four colossal bronzes at Shwezigon - the right hand was doubtless raised in abhayamudrd, and the left perhaps held out, as usual, a lappet of the robe. Whether the Ndga hoods, fresh-painted, are original, may be doubted; they rather resemble the smaller wooden frame of Naga hoods shown in Pagan Museum, but the latter have glass mosaic. The pose of the two standing Buddhas at the sides - based on the dharmacakra mitdra of seated images in India - is not uncommon at Pagan, but hardly found (I think) elsewhere. It has the perfect calm and balance which Kyanzittha loved; and he perhaps invented it. Kyanzittha's use of images in stone relief was here not haphazard. His proximate model, I suppose, was the sculpture in Kyaukku Onhmin. Numerous in Nagayon, images are twenty times more numer- ous in the Nanda. Some, especially those placed in the Halls, served (as we shall see) an educational purpose: to instruct half-pagan, illiterate villagers in the story of their religion. Those in Nagayon Hall are arranged as follows, starting from the N. wall, N.W. corner: - N. Wall. (i) PI. I93 a. The First Sermon at Isipattana. (No Wheel. 2 Deer. 2 Panicavaggiyd. 2 Mahdbrahmd.) (ii) PI. I93 b. Pdrileyyaka retreat. Buddha sits in pralambanadsana. (Monkey, Elephant and Monk) E. Wall. (iii) PI. I93 c. Gotama launches the golden bowl. Kdlanaga awakes and worships the four bowls. (Later sculpture) (iv) PI. I93 d. Defeat of the heretics at Sdvatthi. The Buddha preaches to Pasenadi under Ganda's mango-tree. Naked ascetics try to fly5. (v) P1. I94 a. Descent from Thvatiihsa, between Indra and Brahma. The Buddha stands in varada mudrd above the kneeling Sdriputta. (vi) PI. I94 b. Parinirvdna and the bier. (Sala trees and 5 monks above. 4 Malla kings below. Ananda in bottom right corner.) W. Wall. (vii) P1. I94 c. The Conception. Maya's dream. (White Elephant in top right corner above the 4 Queens. The 4 Mahdrdjas below) (viii) P1. I94 d. The Buddha in dhydnamtdra. Request of Sahampati and the Brahmas. (ix) (missing) (x) PI. I94 e. Gotama takes seat in vajrasana under the Bodhi tree. (Indra winds the Vijayuttara conch. Brahma upholds the chattra) As for the 6o stone reliefs on either side of the Corridor, Mon Bo Kay has brilliantly found the key to identify the more obscure of them. He noticed that here miscellaneous images, mostly in earth- touching attitude, alternate with Buddhas seated in dhydnamudrd, each of the latter with predella below. 5We had realized that the scene was the defeat of the heretics at Savatthi. But I thought that the running figure on the right side of the predella, both here and in Nanda Halls (see PI. 298), was Pfirana Kassapa on his way to drown himself (as shown in PI. 346 b, Myinkaba Kubyaukgyi), with another heretic trying to stop him. But Mon Bo Kay tells me of a similar scene painted in Maung Y6n Gu., No. ii, Minnanthu, with the following Old Burmese gloss below it: "I ka takkatwan kofikaf pyaxi amh hfi so khd tape) tway luik sa "Here is a heretic saying that he is going to fly in the sky, and his disciple hanging on to him."</page><page sequence="334">3I4 Chapter XVI The predellas vary, the Buddhas hardly at all. All sit alone in padmdsana, facing front, right hand on left, both soles showing, without lotus seat or throne; with high uskTsa, large ears drooping, robe covering both shoulders, folds perfectly symmetrical. A calm, gentle, concentrated type, which appealed deeply to Kyanzittha - quite different from the strong dominant Buddhas of Aniruddha's plaques. Their background is architectural, with only minor variations: up to the shoulders generally brick mouldings, horizontal, supporting the nimbus, and at the sides either raying, floral diamonds or hamsas dangling pearls (a favourite bird, which Kyanzittha usually substitutes for kinnaras). Behind these, a plain wooden gable-roof, or tree, or both. One relief on the inner side of the E. corridor (P1. I95 a), 3rd from the N.E. corner, breaks the series: here there is no predella; the scene obviously shows Sumedha prostrate before the feet of the Buddha Dipafikara (4th of the 28 Buddhas). The predellas themselves are not very distinctive: usually 4 figures - monks, kings, hermits or Ndgas - praying or making offerings. But one (P1. i96 d), on the inner side of the W. corridor, near the S.W. corner, shows a lion roaring. Is this not Paduma, the 8th Buddha, worshipped by the future Gotama, then a lion? - Once these were identified, the rest fell easily into place. These dhydna Buddhas all present the 27 Buddhas leading up to Gotama; their predellas show the future Gotama in his previous lives, receiving from them the prophecy of Buddhahood. The illustrations follow pretty closely the text of the Buddhavamsa, Khuddaka Nikdya. The series starts with Tanhafikara (P1. 20i b) in the N. corridor, inner walk, N.W. corner, and proceeds clockwise in alternate niches up to Sumedha Buddha (P1. I97 C) in the W. corridor near the S.W. corner; then crosses to Sujdta Buddha (P1. I97 d) in the outer wall of the N. corridor, 3rd from the N.W. corner. It ends, perhaps with Kassapa and Jotipdla (P1. 200 d) in the W. corridor, perhaps (by a slight irregularity) with Gotama and Ajita (Metteyya) (P1. 20i a). Plates I95 to 20I show all these reliefs, and details are given in the Catalogue of Plates. A few other reliefs of interest (now in the N.W. corner, outer wall of the Corridor) show more scenes of the life of Gotama Buddha: - P1. 20I c. Gotama Buddha (?) in dhydna mudrd. Similar to the many others of the Corridor in this mudrd, but here seated on double lotus, without predella. P1. 20i d. Gotama seated in vajrasana, touching Earth, between Indra and Brahma. The relief is similar to P1. I94 e in the Hall; and both are similar to the pairs of reliefs found in the Nanda Halls (P1. 304), where they are placed to left and right of the entrance to the temple proper. Were they not once similarly placed in the Nagayon, as if to invite, from both sides, the young Buddhist entering the temple to make the great resolve, like Gotama, to attain Buddhahood? P1. 202 a. Standing Buddha, 'Mon' type (hands as in dharmacakra mudrd). Pl. 202 b. Walking Buddha, more Burmese in type. Both themes recur in the series of the Nanda Halls (PIs. 307, 308). P1. 202 C. Gotama seated in dhydnamudra, without mat or lotus. The predella shows Sujata praying between two goats, i.e. at the Ajapi1a banyan tree. Compare the scene in the Nanda Hall series (P1. 309). P1. 202 d. Gotama, on his way to the Bodhi tree, receives 8 handfuls of grass. Sotthiya is shown twice: on the right carrying his load of grass; on the left offering it to Gotama, who accepts it. Compare the Nanda Corridor relief (P1. 295 a). This is a more vivid later Burmese rendering of the scene6. 6 We owe to Mon Bo Kay, once again, this quite certain identification of the scene.</page><page sequence="335">Chapter XVI 315 The walls of Nagayon corridors are still rich in large paintings, both conventional and freehand, with Old Mon glosses written in durable ink. But the poor roughcast roofing, admitting damp, has caused the ruin, not only of the ceiling tondoes, but also the upper half of most wall-panels - the more in- teresting half, for the lower half consists often of little more than rows of seated worshippers. Fortu- nately the inner wall has the usual cornice at the top, and the outer wall projecting corbels, which partly stop the rot. But it is sad that so many freehand panels, some of the largest in Paga'n, ranged in a row along both sides of the Corridor, are now half ruined. Apart from continuous loss by damp and flaking, the clouds of dust raised by lorries on the main road coat these paintings, particularly in the west corridor, thicker and thicker each year. It will be a happy day, for Pagan art as well as villagers, when the government decides to metal all these roads. On the inner wall the top line of panels, starting at the middle of the N. face and going E. from the entrance-arch, illustrates the 34 suttas of the Dfgha Nikdya: about I5 names can still be read. The Dfgha ends on the E. face; and the Majjlsima Nikdya follows, about as far as Sutta 76, to the point of starting: some 25 names can still be read. These panels (2 ft. 6 in. high, i ft. 8 in. broad) are con- ventional: showing (as a rule) alternate Buddhas seated, either touching Earth (bhfimisparsa mudrd). or turning the Wheel of Law (dharmacakra mudra). Below, there is a 6 inch floral band. Below this are the main panels, no longer conventional, but elaborately designed and painted. Each has a long gloss in Old Mon below it, sometimes clear, but often flaked or illegible. We give below a serial list of the subjects treated, with translation, where possible, of the Mon glosses below them. The arrangement of subjects is haphazard. The order I adopt starts on the N. wall (from the N.W. corner for the outer wall; from the N.E. corner for the inner wall), and then follows the order of the writing (clockwise for the outer wall; anticlockwise for the inner). This is not necessarily the right order; it is certainly not the chronological order; but it is the most convenient for finding one's place. My impression is that when he built this pagoda, Kyanzittha's revision of the Tipitaka had made a good start with the earlier Nikdyas; but that he was still muddled (as he well might be) about the order of the later events in Gotama's life. Thus early and late happenings at Rdjagaha, with Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha, are obviously confused. Intermixed with them are several of the longer Jdtakas outside the Mahlnnipdta, and illustrations of a few Suttas, especially those useful for 'defence' (paritta) against the powers of darkness. Nagayon Corridor Paintings - Inner side (from N.E. corner): - N. Wall. i. Preaching of Mahalsamaya Sutta (Dfgha Nikdya 20).

Devadatta's second attempt to kill the Buddha by hurling a rock upon him as he was walking below the Vulture Peak (Gijjhakuta) near RMjagaha. (See introduction to CU11ahafhsa Jataka, No. 533). "This is when the lord Buddha is walking up and down at the foot of a mountain. Devadat goes up to the top of the mountain and stones him (?). Two rocks come to intercept (?) and give warning (?) ..... the Buddha's foot. At that time three monks carry him back between them on a bedstead.

Devadatta sends the drunken Nalagiri elephant to charge the Buddha. Bimbisdra invites the Buddha and presents him with the "Bamboo Garden", Veluvana. - The occasion is the same as in Gloss 7, except for Devadatta's third attempt to kill the Buddha, which took place also in Rdjagaha, but much later, after Ajdtasattu's killing of his father, Bimbisdra: see introduction to the Cullaha'tsa Jdtaka, No. 533. "This is when the lord Buddha enters the city of Rdjigrihh. King In goes dancing in front. This is when Devadat lets loose Lanagiri [i.e. the N51dgiri elephant] in order to kill the lord Buddha.

Wall. i2. Sattapannkguhd - "A cave in Rajagaha, on the slope of Mt. Vebhdra. Once, when the Buddha was staying there, he gave to Ananda the opportunity of asking him to live for an aeon; but Ananda, because of his unmindfulness, failed to take it". (Malalasekera, II, p. ioo0. Dfgha Nikdya I6, ii6-7). . the lord Buddha was staying in the Sattapannagohd ('Cave of the seven-leafed tree,' Alstonia scholaris). The king, with the Devas of Tdvatii and the Devas of the Catumahdraja (sc. the Cdtum- maharajika heaven), all male and female, arrived, and caused (Paftcasikha to play the harp (?). Then king In came and questioned the lord Buddha, who explained the Law of life of king In). All that day also there was opportunity to listen to the Law of the reverend Buddha, and so increase his life-span and be born as king Indra again." If this translation is correct, "the king" is Indra; and there has been confusion with the Sakka- pan-ha Sutta (Dfgha Nikdya 2I), the scene of which was the Indasdla guMh in Mt. Vediya. There it was Indra (Sakka) who faced death, and was reborn as Sakka in the course of the Sermon (see Commentary on Dfgha Nikdya, iii, 732). I3. While the Buddha is hesitating under the Goatherd banyan tree, the great Brahma Sahampati comes to persuade him to preach his Dhamma. "The lord Buddha is staying at the Ajapdla nigrodha tree, considering.. . 'This Law is very deep. I do not want to preach the Law to all the worlds of men.'

Perhaps these point to a North Indian, Sanskrit derivation. "King Yudhichcir sends Surucibrdm to go and search and ask the question about the Service of Truth (dharmayaga) in Jambudipa. He comes and asks, first the Brahman Vidhura, then (San-jay), then Bhadrakdr. All these fail completely.

On the outer wall of the Corridor these main panels are 5 ft. 4 in. high, and usually arranged in several tiers of figures. The breadth is round about 7 ft. The top part is usually lost or damaged. For specimen photographs, see Plates 203 and 204 (Dipafikara and Sumedha, 22 and 23 supra); P1. 205 (king Kusa's forces, 25 supra); P1. 206 (battle-scene from Sonananda Jdtaka, 42 supra). On the inner wall measurements are larger and more variable. Thus on the N. face the Mahdsamaya Sutta panel (i supra) extends ii ft. 9 in. from the N.E. corner to the Shrine-entrance. But it is divided crosswise into 4 sections, each about 4 ft. high. On the W. face, N.W. corner, the scene showing Ajdtasatru's visit to the Buddha (3 supra) is over 8 ft. long and probably 8 ft. high including floral borders. So is the corresponding scene on the E. face, N.E. corner, showing the Hatthipdla and Ayoghara Jdtaka (i6, I7 supra). The centre of the S. face is filled with the scene of Mdra's army, attacking on the right (the East), retreating on the left (the West). Usually, e.g. in Abeyadana temple, it is the other way round. The whole panel, 26 ft. in length and 8 ft. in height, is perhaps the largest in Pagan. Since the scene was well known, there is no written gloss below it. Below these main panels, on the inner wall of the Corridor, there are small panels illustrating the shorter Jdtakas, from No. i to about No. 284, each with Pali name (no number) and Mon gloss stating what the 'Bodhisat' was in that existence. The series starts a little E. of the centre of the S. face, and continues on the W., N., E., and S. faces. The panels are fitted into irregular pockets between the carved niches for images. There are 6 pockets each in the N. and S. faces, and i0 each in the W. and E. The division is approximately as follows: - S. face. 6 pockets (from centre to S.W. corner). Roughly covers Jdtakas I-33(?). W. face. io pockets (from S.W. to N.W. corners). Roughly covers Jdtakas 34(?)-I27. N. face. 6 pockets (from N.W. to N.E. corners). Roughly covers Jdtakas I28-i85. E. face. io pockets (from N.E. to S.E. corners) Roughly covers JTtakas i86-276. S. face. I pocket (?) Roughly covers Jatakas 278-284+ In general the pockets are consecutive, but their size and arrangement varies. Each has about 5 short tiers, with an average of about 9 Jatakas in each. Of the 284 glosses we could read nearly half.</page><page sequence="341">Chapter XVI 32I On the outer wall of the Corridor, below the main panels, there is another series of pockets between niches and windows, similarly fitted with small panels and glosses below them. These illustrate the preaching of Suttas. There are I4 pockets each on the E., S., and W. sides; and 12 (6+6) on the N. side, divided by the entrance arch. Each pocket may have up to 6 tiers of short glosses; but much is flaked or lost. From these 54 pockets we collected altogether about i86 names of Suttas; but many are fragmentary. So far as I can judge, they relate mostly to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Vagga of the Samsyutta Nikdya (Niddna, Khandhdu and Saldyatana). Identification is not easy. This Nikdya is said to contain 7,762 suttas; and indexes give only a selection of them. Titles, too, are variable, and repeat themselves. And the order of the panels does not follow strictly the order of the text. The walls of Hall and Shrine are at present without painting. Remembering the PAhtothamya, one may well believe that they too, the ceilings at any rate, were originally painted. ABtYADANA TEMPLE (Pls. 207-24I) This lovely temple stands about ioo yards N.W. of the much larger Nagayon temple, on the W. side of the road. Its old enclosure-wall, a few yards outside the present one on N., W., and S., once extended much further towards the E., almost up to the road facing the Nagayon, enclosing the five or more small pagodas now intervening. The temple stood in the S.W. corner of the enclosure. Both temples face N. towards Pagan, at the top of the rising ground S. of Myinpagan village. In the Chro- nicles8 Apayratand ('Beloved Jewel') was the name of the first of Kyanzittha's queens, mother of his daughter Shw&amp;-6ng-thi (Rhwe-'im-sani). "At the place called Apayratand [the king] built a temple (goi) and called it Apayratana".9 Two ink inscriptions, neither of them contemporary with the building, are written on the E. and W. sides of the arch leading into the Shrine. The E. inscription, 3 lines of Pali, is written in large square letters of about the 16th century. It mentions the building of the temple by "the chief queen (aggamahesi)." The 4-line inscription on the opposite wall, in Middle Burmese, has no legible date: but it names the Pairatand-bkrud (i.e. Abeyadana pagoda) as "the good work of the great queen, beloved wife of Kyancacsd, king Dhiluinshyah." According to the legend,10 the wife had brought food for her husband, then an outlaw; and found him sleeping, sheltered by a Ndga, at the site where, later, he built the Nagayon. Not daring to approach, she waited at a distance (the site of the Abeyadana), till the serpent disappeared. Her effigy, in brick and plaster, is doubtless the one still visible in the Shrine, seated at the Buddha's feet (PIs. 2I5 e, f; 2i6 a). In their perfect 'Mon' style of architecture, the two temples are similar; and were very likely built by king and queen simultaneously, near the beginning of Kyanzittha's reign, c. 1090 A.D. - perhaps after the building of Shwezigon, when the revision of the Tipitaka was in progress. In other respects the two temples are very different. The Nagayon, as we have seen, may be the immediate result or first fruit of that revision, showing the king's mind directed to the orthodox Theravdda of the Singhalese school. 7The Abbyadana is io6 ft. long, the Nagay6n I37 ft. The former is 63 ft. io in. broad, the latter 82 ft. 3 in. 8 U Kala, I, p. 211 (Apayratand, Rhwe-'im-safi). Hmannan (Susodhita ed). I, p. 284. G.P.C. (transl.), p. 105. 9 U Kala, I, p. 215.

Apart from the Jataka series in the Hall, the paintings in the Abeyadana - certainly the finest in our period, and perhaps the best in Pagan - are largely Tantric-Mahdydnist of the Bengal School, admitting also Vedic and later Hindu deities, notably Siva. Queen Abeyadana's daughter, Shw&amp;6ng-thi, is said in the Chronicles11 to have had as lover the Prince of Patikkard in East Bengal. Kyanzittha was very fond of her: but his ministers persuaded him to disallow the match: "If thy daughter wed the prince of Patikkara, erelong this will be naught but a Kala country!" - If her mother herself was of Vahga (E. Bengal) extraction, it would explain, not only the story in the Chronicles, but also the unique character of the main paintings in her temple. The temple has the usual components - hall and main block, with dark corridor and darker shrine. Seen from without, it combines simplicity and grandeur. The main block is roughly square: but, like the Nagayon, a little longer at the sides (E. and W.) and shorter at the ends (N. &amp; S.). The plinth, with kalasa pot profile (PI. 2I3 b), runs round the whole main block, and also the corners of the Hall, but drops at the main and side-entrances, where the upper recession and 'cornice' are omitted. On each of the three closed sides there are three perforated windows (PI. 2II), made of brick and stucco; more elaborate than those of Nagayon, but not projecting; simpler than those of Myinkaba Kuby- aukgyi. They are well spaced and square, with flame-pediments; the holes are round and rimmed with lotus in the central windows, beaded diamond in those of the corners, with diamond rosettes between. Apart from windows and plinth, there is little external ornament: no kfrtimukha frieze nor dado; no glazed crenelle-tiles; no stonework anywhere; only plain plaster on brick surface, setting off beautiful proportions. Roofs are sloping. There is no staircase up to them. No medial skylights to cast light on the image. The lowest corner-stupas are small models of the crown: a simple banded 'bell' on double lotus, supporting a deeply indented and recessed harmikd, and tall octagonal chattrdvali with rounded base, its eight edges unbroken, but with tiers of notches in between.12 Tall square deep-waisted jars mark the corners of the middle terrace; gnomons (imitating wood) those of the topmost. At the front corners of the broad Hall, instead of corner-stupas, there are two double-bodied lions, facing outwards. The large Hall is sadly mutilated. The three entrance-arches have lost their pediments; all combine pointed brick voussoirs with square wooden lintels. The side-archways on both sides had lifesize paint- ings of standing Yaksas with striped loincloths and one foot raised to kick (originally the trunk of a tree) behind. Such fertility-emblems carry one back over the centuries to Bhdrhut and Sdfici. Bricks are mostly large; but not quite so large as those of Nagay6n13. There are no vertical courses between the horizontal, and no stone courses at all. The flooring of the Nagayon was mostly of glazed stone. Here it seems to be pebble rough cast below, overlaid with two layers of smooth hard plaster. Much the same composition was used, it seems, for the roofing; but it absorbs moisture; and here, as in Nagay6n, ceiling painting is almost all lost; and the remarkable paintings on the corridor-walls survive only because of cornice and corbelling below the vaults. The corridor has a lean-to arch. The 11 U Kala, I, pp. 211-2. Hmannan (Susodhita Ed.) I, p. 284. G.P.C. (transI.) p.

Nagay6n 17" x 8" x 3".</page><page sequence="343">Chapter XVI 323 three outer walls of the Hall arch from the floor; the inner S. wall is vertical. The standing Guardian Bodhisattvas to left and right of the archway are lost; their pedestals remain. There are no niches for images in the Hall. Most of the space on all the three front walls was needed for a complete set of Jdtakas. These were painted in 8 tiers (now overpainted in parts, and blackened with smoke and grime), stretching across the W., N., and E. walls. What remains, mostly on the N. wall, has only about I50 panels with legible writing. As one faces N, towards the entrance, the 8 tiers cover the inclined space, from the W. wall to the E. The top line appears to have begun with other matters, concluding with Dipafikara's prophecy about the hermit Sumedha; so that the Jdtaka proper only starts in the N.E. corner. Dipafikara's prophecy similarly introduces the Jdtaka both in Myin- pyagu and in Myinkaba Kubyaukgyi. For each Jdtaka the Pali title is given, a short description in Mon of the then Bodhisat, and the number within the chapter (vagga) or the series (nipata), the latter being inserted at the end of each series. The JItaka is divided, both in Burma and Ceylon, into 22 'descending series' (nipdta), according to the number of stanzas (gdtha) in each. The nipdta are numbered accordingly i to I3 (J. I to 483); then 'Miscellaneous' (pakimnaka); then 20, 30, 40, 50, 6o, 70, 8o; and finally 'Great' (makdnipata), a term reserved for the last Ten only. At Paga6n this curious system first appears, it seems, in Myinpyagu and the Taungbi 'Mon' temple (supra, ch. XIV, n. 38). We may probably attribute it, together with the reduction in the total of Jdtakas from 550 to 547, to the new recension, based on the Singhalese. Within the nipdta (down to J. 370) there is the subdivision into chapters (vagga), each containing io Jdtakas. In the ist Nipdta (J. I to I50) and the 2nd (J. I5I to 250), the Abeyadana may give the 'tens' in full, and the intervening numbers merely as i to 9. Thus J. 2Io is numbered 6o (sc. of the 2nd Nipdta), J2I5 merely as 5. But the later numbering is full of inconsistency: an amalgam of old and new. On the one hand the new Singhalese divisions are known: the 4th ni"pt ends at 350, the 7th at 4I5/4i6, the 8th at 426, and (probably) the iith at 463; but at times the num- bers suggest other and older divisions. There was a series (io or more panels) numbered from 200 to 300: e.g. 268/68 - conflicting with the 2io/60 series mentioned above. The 4th nipat, from 30I to 350 agrees with the Singhalese: e.g. 350/50 is the last. But there are at least 8 panels of an older series counting from 3I2, e.g. 353/4I, 36I/49, etc. There is another series counting from 333 (e.g. 384/5I), which runs at least as far as 425/92; and yet another (with only 4 legible panels) from 329 (e.g. 4I3/84). Two panels illustrate J. 4i6, one numbered 87 (the old number counting from 329), the other i (the new numbering of the 8th Nipdta ?). The 5th Nipdta should begin at 35i and end at 375: but here are 4 Jdtakas as late as 453/102, which appear to follow the 5th Nipdta numbering. On the other hand we find 7 Jdtakas (455 to 46i) with numbers counting from 44I. The last Ten Jdtakas are numbered in a series starting from 50I (e.g. Nimi 44) and follow exactly the old order of the Hpetleik, ending with (Vessantara 550 ?). Numbering is not important in itself. Variations may be accidental, due to the fact that a particular manuscript began or ended at a particular point. But given his main object - to unite Burma under the aegis of Buddhism, Kyanzittha's first need was to standardize the texts. The Ab- yadana Jdtakas show but little advance beyond the muddles of the Shwezigon. I doubt if queen Abeyadana had any hand in this Jdtaka series. It has nothing in common with the other exquisite paintings in her temple. The following rough table, using the ordinary Singhalese numbers for Jatakas, may enable the student to locate them in the Hall of Abeyadana. Numbers in brackets are pure guesswork, serving only to bridge the gaps: - 2! *</page><page sequence="344">324 Chapter XVI TIER WEST WALL NORTH WALL EAST WALL OPEN ARCHWAY Viii (36 to 6i) 62 to7? ,,|,, I to 9 |I (to 35) VII (I07 to I28), I29 to I32 I33 to 142 ,, ,, 7I to 79 So (to io6) VI 4(79 to 198), I99 to 205 205 to 209 (+4 ,,I,, 143 to I5I (I52 to I78) muscelaneous) V (247 to 267), 268 to 274 275 to 283 ,, ,, 2I0 to 2i8 2I9 to 223, (224 to 246) IV (32I to 346) 347 to 350;384 to 388,, ,, 284to 293 294to 299, (300 to 320) III (389 to 4II) 4I2 to 4i6; 450 to 453,, ,, 352to 362 363 to 364, (365 to 383) II (490 to 5I3) (illegible) ,, ,, 418 to 427 428 (to 449) I (5I4 to 537) 538 to 547 (?550) ,, ,, 455 to 464 465 to 467, (468 to 489) As one prepares to enter the Corridor of the temple, the vision of the Buddha through the starred inner archway, shouldered by jewelled Kinnaras, framed within the tiered pediment of the sanctum- arch, buttressed with elephants and lions rampant, is one that haunts the memory (P1. 2I4 a). To left and right are long (empty) niches, for Maya's Dream on the left, for the Parinirvdna on the right. The inner block, in plan, is almost square (c. 3I ft.). There are no windows through to the dark Shrine. There is the strong plinth below, projecting cornice-capitals above, pilasters at the corners. Resting on the high plinth are rows of tall trefoil niches, with columned sides and soaring leaf-pediments, all richly carved. On the E. and W. sides there are 6 of these, on the S., 4, with a large sikhara-recess in the centre, reaching to the cornice. On the N., there are only the two long niches, with the tiered pediment above the entrance-arch, all three crowned with elaborate stupas. The outer wall of the Corridor has plain niches between the windows - 6 on each face in the lower tier, and 6 in the upper tier, except on the windowless N. wall, where there are io. These are not embossed, but level with the wall. Even these cinquefoil corbelled niches of the outer wall are richly painted; their ceilings with 'sun-gods'; kfitimukha frieze below the first corbel, and bare panels of beautiful proportions below the second. The central window-embrasures are painted with round lotus patterns; the outer ones with square panels and great variety of content. The stone images which these 70 niches held are mostly lost. Of those that remain, the majority are small, modern and conventional. Two earth-touching Buddhas, possibly original, are shown on P1. 215 b, c. The loss is sad because the more we study these walls, the more clear it becomes that here, more successfully than anywhere at Paga6n, an attempt was made to integrate in one interior the three rival arts of architecture, sculpture and painting. In the oldest temples architecture dominated, with sculpture confined to the central Buddha and his throne. The Niche, especially the tall embossed Niche opened in the outer wall of the Shrine (the original temple), represents the Architect's concession to the Sculptor. But these had to be protected; so the lean-to Corridors were added, with their marked contrast of smooth outer, and embossed inner wall, the latter with plinth, pilasters, cornice, frieze and all the trappings of an exterior. The smooth outer wall gave the Painter his chance; and the plain niches soon attracted him. The later history of Pagain architecture will show the triumph of the Painter. In the Abeyadana he had a difficult task: to cope with curving, broken and embossed wall-surface at</page><page sequence="345">Chapter XVI 325 every point, recesses, steps, niches, arches, windows, embrasures, cells, pediments and gikharas. He rose to the challenge. On the plain outer wall he deployed his main theme - the Ascent to Buddha- hood. For this he adds no frame to those already set by Sculptor and Architect: the windows, arches and niches. He accepts these in his design, and gives each one its independent value, and yet manages to absorb them into the central theme. While some Gandharvas are hurrying one way to voice the glories of an incipient Buddha, others speed in the opposite direction to hymn a Buddha throned in his niche. There is never a straight line anywhere, yet no confusion. The whole has the unity in com- plexity of a Persian carpet, the ever-varied weaving of contrasted themes as in a symphony. Paintings on the Inner Walls of the Corridor. - At the top, hardly visible from below, five conventional tiers run all round the four sides, with little variation. Tiers I and III show a line of stupas with pal- myra palms between'4- a theme modified from the one in Myinpyagu. Tiers II and IV show a line of seated Buddhas with reredos and shoulder-diamonds, alternately touching Earth or preaching' - a theme like the one similarly placed in Nagayon. Tier V is a broad floral band.'6 Perhaps the next two tiers were also meant to be conventional: but the painters in this temple were artists in their own right and went their own way. Tier VI shows a series generally of red-robed Buddhas, touching earth or preaching, with worshippers.'7 Their audience may include Devas with flywhisks or streamers, tall figures of Sdriputta and Moggalldna, or other monks in separate cells with coconut palms between. On the E. side (where the artist took liberties), the Buddhas become 24 saints without usnJsa, seated in dhydnartudrd with almsbowls. Tier VII, a narrow tier'8 (PI. 218), on the N., W., and S. sides, shows the worship of the Dandadip by monks, Brahmds, Devas, Yaksas, kings, queens with coronets, bearing shawls, swords, lidded ricebowls, etc. Dan1adfp, "lamp-stands", look like rectangular branching sconces. Though not included in the io8 auspicious signs on the Buddha's Footprint, they figure frequently on the plaques at the base of the Nanda, among the emblems brought by Devas to the Bodhi tree, to celebrate the Buddha's triumph (P1. 333 c). On a stone relief of the Parinirvdna in a Nanda cross-passage (P1. 3i9 e) a dandadIp stands in the centre below the floral couch on which the Buddha lies. On a Nagayon painting (P1. 203 a), there is one below the feet of Dipafikara Buddha. It seems that the danladfp carried a profound symbolic meaning. Could it possibly stand for the Triratna ? - The E. face omits the dani4adfp, and substitutes a homelier series of panels'9: a lady seated, facing front, with right or left knee raised, holding in her lap a bowl of lotus. She wears dark yellow knickers with black markings. On each side of her there is a maid rolling bark for face-powder, on a stone tray with metal stand (P1. 2I7 d). Between each panel are seen the head and forelegs of a white elephant. - Are these the ladies attendant on Queen Maya during her pregnancy, in continuation of the scenes on the N. face? The two broad niches dominate the N. side (Pls. 2I4 b, c; 215 a). Empty as they now are, they must have once held sculptures showing the Conception (Dream of Maya) on the E. side of the entrance to the Shrine, and the Parinirvdna (Death of the Buddha) on the W.

On the right of the E. stupa is a large panel (P1. 2I7 a) depicting Maya's Robing. She sits in padmdsana, hands on knees, between the wives of the four Mahdrdjas, who bring her toilet-requisites. On the left of the stupa is a similar panel (P1. 2I7 b, c), showing her seated in great beauty, the Future Buddha shining in her womb. The four queens offer her delicacies, or wait in adoration. In the narrow panel above this, a line of Devas keeps watch over her, 9 to the left of the stupa base, and I4 to the right of it. On the W. side of the archway, the large lower panels of paint- ing on both sides of the Parinirvdna niche show lines of mourners: men and kings in the lowest tier; above them, drummers; above them, Devas dancing on the left, Devis drumming, dancing and making offerings on the right; above them, lines of Brahmds. Above these, below the dan1adfp tier, there is a row of painted stupas, 6 on each side of the embossed niche-stupa, worshipped by rows of Devas, Brahmrns, Ndgas, kings, etc. On the E., W., and S. sides, in the forks where the tall niche-pediments meet each other (or the corner pilasters), there are the i8 Tondoes20 (or half-Tondoes) described already in Chapter XI (supnra, pp. 222-4; Pls. 2I9-223. All show Vedic or later Hindu gods and goddesses, each riding his vdhana, and coming with offerings to worship at this Buddhist shrine. There are no glosses to identify them. My suggestions (argued in Ch. XI) are, briefly, as follows. The 7 deities of the W. wall tondoes, starting from the N.W. corner, include: - i. Brahmd on Harhsa. 2. Siva on Nandin. 3. Visnu on Garuda. 4. Devi on Siriha. 5. Six-armed god on a charging Elephant. 6. Rdma on Hanuman. 7. Revanta on Horse. The 7 deities of the E. wall tondoes, starting from the N.E. corner, include: - 8. Thdna on Bull. 9. Indra, with Indrani, on Airdvata. Io. Agni on Goat. II. Two-armed god on Buffalo. 12. The river-goddess Yamund on Tortoise. I3. The river-goddess Saras- vati on Harhsa. I4. The river-goddess Gafigd on Makara. All these face N., on their way towards the only entrance to the Shrine, on the N. face. The deities in the remaining 4 Tondoes on the S. wall, face inwards, towards the Buddha image which once occupied the central sikhara-recess: - I5. (S.E. corner) Four-armed goddess riding a Kinnarl. i6. Yama and Dhfrmr0rnd on Buffalo. I7. (S.W. cor- ner) Varuna on Makara. i8. Four-armed deity on Eagle (?), with Cormorant in front. Between these 4 tondoes, the painting on this S. face shows the Mdra-dharsana -the same scene as that similarly placed in Nagayon. But here the panel is less than half the size21, and the arrangement is more normal: Mdra attacking from the left, retreating on the right (PI. 225 a, b). Above the tondoes on all three faces, on each side of the tops of the niche-pediments, there are pairs of celestial musicians, Gandharvas and Apsarasas, with their various instruments, trailing clouds behind them as they fly to celebrate the Buddha in each niche.22 There are 6 pairs each on the E. and W. walls, and 3 on the S. (P1. 224 a, b, c, d). Finally, as in Nagayon (supra, p. 3I2), on the low band of plinth-moulding on the inner wall, there are tiny panels of painted dancers, drummers and musicians (P1. 24I). 20 The diameter of each tondo is about I4 inches plus 3 inches of border. 21 Mdradharsana panel: ii ft. 8 in. broad; nearly 4 ft. on each side of the recess. Height: 3 ft. 22 Musicians: - Height i ft. i in. Max. breadth i ft. 8 in. The instruments they carry are not easy to identify. Col.

The only omission is the flaked or defaced panel at the bottom. Below the 8 inch band of foliation shown at the base of the drawing, there is a larger band, about 2 ft. 6 in. high, reaching to the floor. In the N.E. corner, one can still see a fragment of it, filled with large coiling arabesque of rampant leafage; also big jars; and probably pilaster-panelling at intervals. The total height of plane painted wall-surface is about I4 ft. The main tiers, as they were and as they are, may be roughly summarised as follows: - OUTER WALL OF CORRIDOR Extant .~ ~~~~Mx . i.na Tier Subject Height Moral (in whole Breadth Total Topmost Buddhahood attained (PI. 240) 32 in. 271 in. 52 to 56 i (at top) 4th Standing Bodhisattvas (Pls. 238, 239) 321 in.

I9j in. 38 35 (PIs. 228, 229) Lowest Floral bands 38 in. In seeking to interpret this wall, we have nothing but the paintings themselves to go on. There are no written glosses, either here or on the inner wall of the corridor. Are the Bodhisattvas individual or generalized ? Why do those of the ist and 4th tiers hold weapons, but not those of the 2nd ? Does the long series of Cave-scenes (broken only at the windows) imply a narrative, based perhaps on an original Tdntric-Mahdydnist text ? - I am not sure; and ever since the War, when Burma lost all its research libraries, vital books of reference are wanting. All we can do is to list and summarize the evidence in proper sequence, tier by tier. We made efforts to record the colour of each Bodhisattva, in case this should be significant. The skin-colour ranges now from muddy white to darkish brown. The original colour was doubtless different, and we cannot fix it. The "Green Tara", who recurs fairly often in the Caves, is now much nearer to Brown than Green. My own eyesight is weakening; so I rely here entirely on my colleague Col. Ba Shin. The corridor is always dark. With candle, electric torch and 'Storm King' oil-lamp, it was still often difficult to trace the forms. The reader must be prepared to find dis- crepancy between U Mya's copies and Ba Shin's description. I have not softened it; nor can I decide between them: e.g., in Cave No. 49 (PI. 233 a), whether the Colonel is right in questioning (he does not absolutely deny) the Mouse in the Bodhisattva's hand. These hundred-and-more graceful Bodhisattvas, in form always tilted and diagonal, do not easily lend themselves to piling upwards in tiers. Strong frames are necessary to hold them in position. Hence the architectural framing of the tiered niches. Hence the narrow but continuous Cave-band</page><page sequence="348">328 Chapter XVI binding the whole. They form the Second Subject, as in the Classical Symphony, contrasting with the First, and so enforcing it. Jewelled pilasters frame, not only the niches, but also the Bodhisattvas standing between them. Strong horizontal roofs support their finials, but even more the lolling Bod- hisattvas. Between these roofs, only the seated Buddha at the top is stable on his jetting stem. Span- drels of the arches, too, upper and lower, allowed the artist to develop the Opening-of-the-Flower motif - symbol of Buddhahood attained. The undivine beginner at the base, constricted in his strength, his armour and felt boots, flowers to unarmed divinity on lotus, with gods adorant on each side. And still there is room for flying gods in clouds to bring their offerings, not to him, but to the Bud- dhas in the splendid niches beside him. Only in the top spandrels is there no cross-motif: king, ministers, clouds, Apsaras and Gardharva, all combine to form, as to adore, the Flower of Buddha- hood. ist Tier (Pls. 228, 229). - Each Bodhisattva sits alone in ardhaparyaftkdsana, on plain low platform, with triple-arching reredos, including the nimbus of his tilted head, and sometimes jewelled diamonds at the shoulders. Each has two arms with distinct attributes: spear, arrow, vajra, discus (plain, saw- toothed or lotus-edged); axe, broadsword, leafy falchion, two-edged sword or scimitar; shield, trident, dagger, scabbard-knife (?), club, ladle, twelve-spoked wheel, hooded cobra, wriggling snake, etc. Each has a pointed diadem and lotus-cone of hair, ear-tubes, and royal ornaments, necklaces, armlets, wristlets, epaulettes, and sash or upavfta slung across the body from left shoulder to right hip. All wear striped loincloths of various colours. Some wear felt boots, plain, striped or variegated. Others have only anklets. Usually the right knee is raised, at varying angles, and the left knee flat. If so, the head is tilted to the left, and the right elbow propped on the raised knee or thigh. Where (as in the four E. of the entrance-arch) the head is tilted to the right, the left knee is raised and the left elbow rests on it. The only Bodhisattvas of this tier yet identified by scholars, are No. 2 on the E. wall (Pls. 228 a, 229 b) which Dr. Ray names Saptasatika Hayagriva, chiefly because "over his crown peeps out the head of a horse"23; and No. 6 on the W. wall (P1. 228 f), which he finally identifies with giva.24 For the latter, his first judgement (on his p. 6o) is to be preferred: "it certainly belongs to the varied pantheon of the Vajraydna"; for on this outer wall of the corridor we are wholly in the Buddhist world, not the Hindu. U Mya's outline sketch of the Bodhisattva25 is nearer the truth: his left hand holds a long spear, not a trident: and the so-called rosary in the right is the result of damage by insects; there is nothing but an open palm. As for No. 2, illustrated here both by outline copy and photograph, since neither Ba Shin nor I can discover the horse's head, we hesitate to accept Dr. Ray's suggestion. Perhaps all these Bodhisattvas are just generalized symbols of power still self-imprisoned. 2nd Tier (P1. 230) - A higher type of Bodhisattvas, all seated like kings in lalitdsana, like gods on lovely lotus cushions, with gods kneeling in worship beside them. The model for the central figure was the seated Lokanitha, "Lord of the World", whom Aniruddha worshipped. He sits with left leg flat, and right hanging or resting on a lotus footstool. His right hand, palm open, is stretched across the right knee in gesture of Charity, varada muidra. On the right (his left) rises a long lotus stalk which, 23 Sanskrit Buddhism in Burma, fig. i8 and pp. 6o-6i and II5. 24 ibid, fig. 26, pp. 6o, ii6. 25 A.S.I. I930-34, Part II, P1. CI (a) - our P1. 228 f, (W.6).</page><page sequence="349">Chapter XVI 329 twining with his left hand raised before the body in abhaya, vydkhydna or other mOdrd, or climbing the crook of his left elbow, flowers, half-flowers, or half-fades above his left shoulder. This may or may not be balanced by another lotus, rising freely on the left (his right). He has two arms, and carries no weapon. There are no felt-boots nor anklets. Bodhisattvas of the lower tier held symbols of worldly power: but these are gods, objects of reverence. There are a good many minor variations, perhaps just to avoid monotony. In one case only (W. io) the right leg is flat and the left hanging. In six the right hand is in abhaya, not varada mudra; in four perhaps dharmacakra mudra; vydkhydna (pose of exposition) and vitarka (pose of argument) are also possibilities. The two devotees are always in namaskira mudrd, rarely offering flowers. Crowns, royal ornaments, sashes and loincloths of all three are beautifully varied. Perhaps they are not meant to give more than a general picture of Advanced Bodhisattvahood. The 'Second Subject' at this point is worth regard. Above the abacus of the niche-frame, holding the lower tier of Bodhisattvas, at the corners of the crenellated terrace stand kinnaras, facing outward on each side (compare those at the corners on the lowest terrace of Seinnyetnyima). On the next re- ceding terrace sit or crouch guardian Lions with tails rampant. On the third crenellated terrace sit Devas. On the fourth, Lions again, with mouths agape and outer forepaw raised. All these appear to guard, in echelon, not only the Buddha-stupa behind them, but also the Bodhisattvas whom they face. 3rd Tier Caves (Pis. 231-237). - The panels are small: only I31 inches high by IIJ inches broad. There are 30 on each of the three sides, E., S., and W. Much on the N. side has flaked; but here too we can distinguish i9 Caves, with the possibility of a good many more. In appendix to this chapter we give, in serial order and tabular form, brief descriptions of these io9 panels. 54 of them are shown in the Plates. It is my impression (right or wrong) that the artist, or Queen Abeyadana, implies that the lower heights of Buddhist attainment, up to Lokandtha level (2nd tier), are within reach of every strenuous Hinaydnist believer. To rise beyond this, a course of Thntric and other discipline, symbolized by the Caves, is necessary before one can attain full stature as a perfected Bodhisattva (4th Tier); after which one rises straight to Buddhahood (topmost Tier). But since we have not yet found the key to the interpretation of the Caves (it may be some Indian text known to better scholars), all we can do for the present is to summarise, in order, the scenes depicted, and illustrate a selection of them with photo- graphs and eye-copies made by the Archaeological Department. My descriptions are based on Col. Ba Shin's keen observation. He does not always see what the copyists saw; and he often sees details which they overlooked. In particular, they often omit the ldnichana or 'marks' (as my Indian friends call them) - seemingly irrelevant figures (hunters, birds, animals, etc.) shown on top of the Caves, to left and right of the peak. Possibly these may help to identify the scenes. U Mya26 has traced 5 of these io9 scenes to the story of the hermit Vaccha and the Kinnarz, who persuaded him to kill the monstrous Spider; as told in Mahosadha (MahM-Ummagga) Jctaka27. The 5 scenes he identifies, in my serial numbering are Panel 34, the Refusal; 36, the Acceptance; 37, the Family Life; 38, the Killing of the Spider; 39, the three Kinnari (the Invitation ?). And a sixth scene, Panel 50, which we call the Negotiation, shows a human go-between entreating the hermit, with one Kinnarf turning away, and spiders on both side-walls of the Cave. The narrative order one would 26 A.S.I. I93-34, Part I, p. i83, and Part II, Pls. CII d, CIII a, b. 27 Fausb6ll (Pali text), Vol. VI, p. 422. Cowell (transl.), Vol. VI, p. 2I7.</page><page sequence="350">330 Chapter XVI expect is: 39, Invitation; 34, Refusal; 50, Negotiation; 36, Acceptance; 38, Killing of the Spider; and 37, Family Life. Panel 35, in the middle of the series, shows a monk seated in dharmacakra mudrd. This has nothing to do with the story. - I infer from this that the order of these panels is not necessarily consecutive. If one story is taken from the Jdtaka (I cannot question the identity of Vaccha), others may also be traced there. A probable one, I think, is Padakusala-mdnava, No. 43228. Cave 68 (PI. 234 g) shows the horse-faced Yakkhini (Assamukhi) two-armed, seated in her lonely cave among the snakes, Cave IOO (PI. 236 c) shows her son, the Bodhisattva, questioning her about the limits of her domain. Here she has four arms and weapons, and sits devouring gobbets of human flesh. Other identifications are more doubtful. Panels 45 and 52 show a maned lion couchant in a cave. In 52, without fear, a dog-like animal crouches in front and below him. If the dog is really a jackal, the story may well be that of the Virocana Jdtaka, No. I4329. Panels 46 and 85 show a hermit seated in a cave, with a small deer standing before him. This reminds one of Alambusd Jdtaka No. 523, or Nalinikd Jdtaka No. 52630, the story of Isisifiga3l. But there are other possibilities, e.g. Migapotaka Jdtaka, No. 37232. Panel 6o shows a hermit in a cave threatening a monkey. This might illustrate either Makkata Jdtaka No. I73, or Kapi Jdtaka, No. 25o33. But if so, the monkey has already discarded his ascetic robes. And here, too, there are other possibilities. In Panel I3, the arrival of the Bird-Elephant (Pali vdrana, hatthilinga) with a Babe on its head reminds me of the birth of Vessantara34, but the other details hardly agree; it reminds Col. Ba Shin of the story in Dhammapada Commentary about the birth of Udena in the forest, and his rearing by the hermit Allakappa, after Udena's mother was carried off by the monstrous bird.35 Panel 73 shows a hermit seated in converse (his varadamudrd pose is denied by the Colonel) with a Ndga King: this might illustrate either Pandara Jdttaka No. qi8. or Saikhapila Jdtaka, No. 524.36 But even if all these suggestions were accepted, U Mya would still be right in asserting37: -"There are certainly clearer evidences of Thntrism in the paintings along the same band; they display Ma- hayanist gods and goddesses in their fierce forms or holding attributes of a Thntric nature." Note, however, that the erotic side of Thntrism, traceable in a few I3th century Burmese temples of Min- nanthu, is not to be found in the Abeyadana. Who are the occupants of these Caves? - (i) BUDDHAS: I5. See Caves I, 7, I5, 2I, 27, 44, 5I, 55, 57, 83, 96, I07 and 3 illustrated: Pls.234 a (6i), 235 e (8o), 236 a (88). They are always shown seated in padmasana, 4 times in dharmacakra, 4 times in dhydna mudra (with or without almsbowl), 3 times each in abhaya and bhkimisparga mudrd. 28Cowell, Vol. III, pp. 298-300.

CIII, c, d.</page><page sequence="351">Chapter XVI 33I In one panel the attitude is not clear. Once there seem to be a beard and moustache (80). The us~n.sa varies - conical, or knobbed, or sharp-cut as if in metal. The right shoulder may or may not be bare. The colour of the robe is usually dark purple. Sometimes there is a reredos, with shoulder-diamonds. In 3 panels other figures are present: - In 44, on the right (the Buddha's left), a lion sits on his haunches facing him (Is this Padutma Buddha? Cf. PI. i96 d). In 57, on the left (the Buddha's right), is a white elephant with trunk raised. In 6i (P1. 234 a) a figure naked to the waist, knees slightly bent, enters on the right, holding in his left hand a piece of cloth (?), brandishing in his right a large bone (?), as if about to strike the Buddha. - I take this to be Alavaka Yakkha brandishing the dussavudha. See Malalasekera, Vol. I, p. IIOO. (ii) SAINTS AND MONKS: I5. See Caves 3, i8, 23, 3I, 35, 4I, 47, 79, 92, I04 and 5 illustrated: Pls. 23i a (5), 23I C (9), 234 c (63), 234 e (66), and 236 d (ioi). These have no usnfsa; otherwise they resemble Buddhas. IO sit in padmadsana on lotus, 4 each in dharmacakra and dhydna mutdra; 3 perhaps in vitarka mudrd. Their robes are mostly deep purple. Rarely there is a reredos with shoulder-diamonds. Their right shoulder may or may not be bare. In 4 Caves the monk sits sideways, facing right or left. In Cave 3 he faces a praying hermit on the right. In 66 (PI. 234 e), two monks sit sideways on low pedestals facing each other, their outer hands in vitarka mudrd. With his inner hand, the monk on the right upholds the stem of a large blue lotus. In 63 (PI. 234 c), the monk with shoulder-diamonds sits sideways on a lotus pedestal, pointing to the right at a maned lion rampant before him, tail between legs. In 4i he sits facing left with hands raised before him. Outside the cave stands a monkey offering fruits. Before the monk, crouches a leopard (?). Between monk and leopard is a large bowl with conical lid. In 3i he sits in dhydnamudrd between two hairy men, the one on the left kneeling in prayer, the one on the right holding a gold staff with tassels diagonally across the monk's body. Cave 9 (PI. 23I C) shows two saintly boys seated, facing left, with short black hair and long topknot hanging out behind. The front boy holds a large lotus bud. The younger boy behind him, perhaps also a monkey in front of him, are in namaskdra mudrd. Cave ioi (P1. 236 d) shows a three-headed elephant with three trunks, but human body and two hands, seated in padmdsana on double lotus. He seems to have the usni-sa (is this a symbol for the All-Wise, the Buddha ?). (iii) BODHISA TTVAS: I3. See Caves II, I9, 25, 30, 82, 91, 95, I03 and 5 illustrated: Pls. 232 f (42), 233 a and 237 f (49), 233 g (58), 235 c (77), 235 i (87). All I3 have two arms, and all but one are seated. One doubtful figure (IO3) is shown standing - perhaps a royal personage, hand on hip. Two (Ii, i9) sit in ardhaparyankasana, right knee raised; nine in lalitasana, right or left leg hanging, with or without a lotus footstool. Four (30, 87, 9I, 95) sit like Lokandtha, right hand open on the knee in varada mudrd, with or without climbing lotus stems. No 42 (PI. 232 f) has left leg hanging, and left hand open on the knee in varada mudrd, while the right hand brandishes the vajra. No. 77 (PI. 235 c), with left leg hang- ing, holds the stem of a full blown lotus in the left hand, and another in the crook of his right elbow. No. 87 (P1. 235 i), a Lokandtha without lotuses, holds his left hand, with jewel, open before the body in abhayamitdrd. No. 95, too, has the left hand in abhayamudrd. No. i9 has the right hand probably in vitarkamudrd. No. 30 has the left hand before the body in mantramudrd. Whether 49 (P1. 233 a) really holds a mouse in his left hand is doubtful. Only two of these Bodhisattvas are given adorants. No. 42 (P1. 232 f) sits between two, human and divine. One lovely figure, 58 (P1. 233 g), sits facing right on patterned mat and double lotus, left shin resting on right thigh. The pose is dharinacakra</page><page sequence="352">332 Chapter XVI mudrd, both elbows twined with half-blown blue lotus. He looks askance, benignly, on a slim kneeling figure on the right, whose palms are open for offering. But is the figure really a Tdrd, Mahdgrl Tdrd? (iv) TARAS: I2. See Caves 74, 89, 97, i09 and 8 illustrated: PIS.23i e (i6), 23I g (20), 23I i (24), 232 i (48), 233 h (59), 237 d (76), 235 g (84), 236 b (93). Whether No. i09, a figure seated crosslegged in royal attire, is a Tdrd or a Bodhisattva, is not certain. Including this, there are 9 Tdrds with two arms; two (Nos. 48, 74) with four arms; and one (No. 20) with six. Three (Nos. 20, 24, and i09) sit in padmasana on lotus; the others sit in lalitasana, the right leg usually hanging; but the left in Nos. i6 and 7638 All wear coronets, and have the firnd in their foreheads. All are 'peaceful'. The majority are twined with stems of lotus, often with flowers half blown.39 The pose is generally either varada, or dharmacakra mudri. These Tdrds have been considered at length in Ch. X (supra, p. 200). The conclusion reached is that they are all 'peaceful' eman- ations, probably of the Jima ('Dhydni Buddha') Amoghasiddhi.40 Several of the two-armed Tdrds in varadamudra are the Green (Sydma or Khadiravanf) Tdrd. The four in dharmacakra mudrd (Nos. i6, 59' 89, 93) may be Mahksrf Tdrd.41 The four-armed goddess holding a Book (No. 48, PI. 232 i) may be Dhamadd Tdrd.42 The six-armed Tdrd (No. 20, PI. 23I g) has not been identified. Perhaps the beautiful 'Bodhisattva' of Cave 58 (PI. 233 g) is really Mahksrf Tdrd. The two blue lotuses and dhar- macakra mudrd would fit. (v) TANTRIC DEITIES: i6. See Caves 32, 33, 69, I05, io6 and ii illustrated: PIs. 237 a (29), 237 b (40), 233 d (53), 233 e (54), 234 b (62), 234 d (65), 234 f (67), 234 h (70), 234 i (7I), 235 h (86), 237 e (99). These have also been considered in Ch. X (supra, p. 200). Not all wear crowns or coronets. Those with bushy hair (Nos. 54, 65, 67,7i and 99 - all illustrated) are perhaps demons rather than gods. Their sex is not always easy to fix. Of the 9 with two arms, about half are male, half female. Of the 3 with four arms, one (No. 65) is male, two (Nos. I05, io6) probably female. Of the 4 with six arms (Nos. 40, 67, 7I, 99) all perhaps are female. The 'fierce' deities include Nos. 53, 62, 69, 70 and the 5 bushy-haired ones. No. 71 (P1. 234 i), the six-armed goddess (?) standing on a corpse, may perhaps be the Hindu-Thntric goddess Cdmundd,43 in her six-armed form as Rudra-carcikd. Could No. 29 (PI. 237 a), a seated lady holding the tress of her long hair, be Vasundhard, the Earth-goddess? (vi) HERMITS: 28. See Caves 3,4,6, I2, I4,28,64,75,85,94,98 and I7 illustrated: Pls. 23i b (8), 23i d (I3), 23I f (I), 23i h (22), 232 a (34), 232 b (36), 232 C (37), 232 d (38), 237 C (43), 232 h (46), 38 Cf. R. D. Banerji, E. Indian School of Mediaeval Sculpture, PI. XL e, f. It does not seem to matter if the right leg (as usual) is hanging, or the left. In the latter case, positions may be reversed, left arm on left knee in varada mudrd. 39 The half-blown lotuses do not appear in the first outline copy shown at A.S.I. 1930-34, Part II, P1. CII (c), and Ray, Sansk. Buddhism fig. ig, but are seen in the later copy (No. 20, PI. 23I g). Col. Ba Shin confirms the half- blown lotus in the upper right hand, but is doubtful about the upper left. The middle left, he thinks, may be in abhayamudrd before the body. 40 For Amoghasiddhi and the 'Cutch Forest' Tara, see Bhattasali, . Dacca Museum, pp. 2I, 56-58 and PI.

All are emaciated. They usually sit sideways, on a low pedestal, with or without a tiger-skin mat, on the left side of the Cave. Two (Nos. I7, 94) hold rosaries, one (No. 43) ladles. Of the 28 Hermits, 2I wear the two horned headdress - a 'horn' (9'ihga) or coil of hair on each side of the head. Most of the others wear the tall jutting 'single horn' (ekasriga; Old Burm. tukkhyd)44, rather like a fool's cap. The style of headdress seems unimportant. The hermit Vaccha, usually shown with the two 'horns' (Nos. 36, 37, 38), has only the one 'horn' in No. 50; and in No. 34 has only the hair-knot on the nape of the neck. Their visitors (monkeys, dogs, deer, a pig, a bird-elephant, flying Deva, Naga, Kinnaris and humans) kneel, sit or stand on the right side of the Cave. A monkey is shown massaging their feet (No. 8), extracting a thorn (?) from the sole (No. 78), or being threatened for a fault (No. 6o). The Monk takes precedence of the Hermit. In No. 3 a Monk, in vitarkamudrd, sits on the left (the side of honour), with a Hermit on the right doing him reverence. There is little sign of Thntrism except in one (No. 56, P1. 233 f), where the hermit holds in his right hand a blanched human face. For further detail about the Caves, see the appendix to this chapter. 4th Tier. Standing Bodhisattvas (Pls. 238, 239). - The upper parts of the outer wall of the Corridor are in much worse preservation than the lower parts. These Bodhisattvas, each about 2 ft. 8 in. high, stand between the upper tier of niches and the windows. On the E. and W. outer walls there are 6 niches and 3 windows, all flanked by standing Bodhisattvas (total IO + IO = 20). On the S. outer wall there are only 8 Bodhisattvas, 4 on each side of the central window. For the badly flaked N. outer wall I estimate the same, 4 on each side of the entrance-arch (total 8 + 8 _ i6); but this may be an underestimate. Of these 36 Bodhisattvas, parts of 28 or more can be seen; but much is lost above the 41 inch floral band over the Caves, especially on the N. and E. walls. The best preserved panels are on both walls about the S.W. corner. We may call them Avalokites'vara perhaps, rather than Padmapdni, since only one (in the N.E. corner) appears to hold the Lotus. But each in his youthful beauty stands framed in it - the Womb of all Creation. From the round double-lotus 'tray' on which his bare feet are planted, rises a forest of fertility - stem, petiole, leaf, bud, calyx, pericarp, corolla - to flower above his shoulders. One knee is slightly bent, the other hip haunched; toes point outwards; the head and oval halo are slightly tilted. Each has the firnd in the centre of the forehead. The royal clothes and ornaments are beautiful and simple. :a broadening upavfta falling from left shoulder to right thigh; loincloth with variegated lines or stripes; blue waistband tied with loop and lappets dangling at will; short half-sleeved, close- fitting jacket, setting off the gold and pearl necklace, wristlets, armlets, coiling ear-tubes, jewelled crown and braided hair. The Bodhisattvas have but two hands, and carry various weapons: discus (cakra, the commonest), sword (kha~dga), dagger (kartari), spear (s9ila), trident (tris'iila), spear-trident (spear with trident at the butt end), thunderbolt (vajra), hook (atikus'a), conch (s'ankha), lotus stalk, etc. In this respect they resemble the Bodhisattvas of the Ist Tier rather than the 2nd, who only exhibit mudrds. Are these symbols here to be given a metaphysical sense? Or have we confused, e.g., the cakra with the sudar- sala ? 44 For tukkhyd, see I.B. PI. I 77 (542 s./ii8o A.D.).</page><page sequence="354">334 Chapter XVI 5th (Topmost) Tier. Buddhahood attained (PI. 240). - After centuries of moistening through the porous roof, few of these remain, even in part - perhaps I7 out of a total of over 50; and of these, hardly more than 6, on both walls of the S.W. corner, are fairly complete. As planned, I imagine, between each frame of upper niche and window, a strong stem rose direct above each standing Bod- hisattva to bear a Buddha seated in dharmacakra mudrd. The narrowing arch-tops left ample space, especially at corners and above the windows, for extra Buddhas; so that the original total was very likely over 50. The number of adorants varies with the space available: but the general design is always the same. From the base of the inverted triangle formed by adjacent spandrels, immediately above the Bod- hisattva's crown, rises a strong pillared stem or peduncle, with attendant petioles supporting leaf, pericarp and bud. The stem expands to form the rich krdpap, fitted with double range of pedicels, on which the Buddha spreads his stippled leather mat. There he sits against a reredos or triple nimbus the arch broken by diamond at the shoulders, under the white umbrella. In purple robe covering both shoulders, with high conical usntisa, he sits in vajrasana, turning his Wheel of Law. Crowned kings and bearded ministers, in tiers nicely graded, each wrapped in coloured robes of patterned wheel or diaper, kneel in worship from below. From above, trailing their rhizome-patterned clouds, float and run the orchestra of heaven, flying (as children kites) their ever-climbing lotus-stems. ABLYADANA.

The temples and other buildings treated in this chapter include the more damaged or ruinous ones which we are inclined to attribute to Kyanzittha's reign, mainly on grounds of style. It is easy for pioneers to go wrong in such dating. But even so, we do not think their dates could be much earlier than Kyanzittha's accession (io84 A.D.), or later than the middle of the I2th century A.D. MRAKAN STONE LIBRARY (P1. 242) This building, which formerly stood at the N.W. foot of Mt. Tura* (Tuywindaung), was commonly called the 'Setkudaik' or Library. According to the Glass Palace Chronicle', king Kyazwa (Klacwd), who reigned from I235 to C. I249 A.D., "in the year 598 s. (I236 A.D.) dammed the water falling from the foot of Mt. Tuywin, and made a great lake. He filled it with the five kinds of lotus, and caused all manner of birds, duck, shelduck, crane, waterfowl and ruddy goose, to take their joy and pastime therein. Near the lake he laid out many ta of cultivated fields: it is said that he ate three crops a year. Hard by the lake he built a pleasant royal lodge [Burm. manit:tai:], and took delight in study seven times a day." The four-faced stone pillar recording the digging of Mra-kan tank, 'the Emerald Lake', stood till recently on the bank at the N.E. end of the lake. It is now set up in the N. shed, Pagan Museum. The inscription, in Old Mon, is by Kyanzittha, not by Kyazwa; it has been edited by Blagden.2 On Face D, lines II-I2, we are told the original name3, half Sanskrit, half Burmese, given by Kyanzittha to the lake: Mahanirbban Lak-chuy-khi-riy, "Mahanirvana. Water raised by pulling with the hand." It was made, says the inscription, "for the benefit of all men, all classes of animals and winged birds." There is no date; but the inscription is almost a duplicate of Kyanzittha's two inscriptions near Mt. Kelasa, I G.P.C. (transl.), p. I56. Hmanman, Susodhita ed., Vol. I, pp. 34I-2.

It gives 'the second version' of his legend (see suara, pp. 56-57) - obviously later than the first, dated I093 A.D.5 A short distance N. of the lake, the royal lodge, or 'Setkudaik' "Library" as it came to be known - the only all-stone building at Pagan - was still standing in I905 (P1. 242 a)6. In i9i8-i9, when I first visited it, the N. wall was in ruin, and the stone was being pilfered by villagers; but the rest was well enough preserved for me to take a rough measured plan (P1. 242 c). But the spasmodic demands of the Public Works Department for roadmetal for the nearby Nyaung-U - Kyaukpadaung road (only recently completed), took precedence of the claims of art and archaeology. When the Burma Historical Commission visited the site in I957, all we found was a hole in the ground, and two neat piles of stone bricks placed ready for removal. Searching through these, we recovered one with bead-and-egg carving on the narrow side (PI. 242 b), from either the capital or the torus of the E. window pilasters shown in (a). It is now at Pagan Museum. There can be no doubt that Kyanzittha built the library as well as the tank. All existing stone or half-stone buildings at Pag6n - Nanpaya and Kyaukku Onhmin - belong to the first half of the Pagan period. It is a lovely spot, quiet except for the music of the birds. I have argued elsewhere7 that here Kyanzittha placed his son Rdjakumdr (whom he had been forced by circumstances to disinherit), together with other learned scholars and monks from Ceylon and Thaton, to revise and standardize the text of the Tipitaka on Singhalese models; and so to lay the foundation for the subsequent reli- gious, literary and artistic life of Burma. It is perhaps worth while to leave on record here some extracts from my note made on the spot in i9i8-i9. "Interior. Entrance-projection at W. end. The building stretches E. and W., with two perforated windows each on N. and S. sides; and one high, but deep and narrow one at the E. end. All are of stone, through and through. The E. window was faced with stucco and probably painted (was there an image at this end ?). Each arch is finely marked with flat stone wedges joggled into the horizontal courses. At the shoulders of the vault a horizontal band runs all around the building, higher on the E. and W. walls than on the N. and S. The N. side has now fallen in, and the stone is being stolen. Exterior. Two windows on S. side. The perforations of the one on the E. are clear - plain square holes, 4 X 4. No carving. Stone pilaster between the two windows. The single window on the E. is the best preserved. Here the window is taller, and the holes bigger, 3 X 5. Above is the flame-pedi- ment (clec), curvilinear below, with slight carving apart from the beautiful bead-and-egg mouldings below the capital, and above the torus, of the jamb-pilasters. Under the curvilinear clec (as at Nanpaya) there is a small kalaga pot in relief. Above it, and above the flat cornice-band, in the gable (as at Dhammayan-gyi), there is a large kalasa pot in relief. There were two other large kalasa 4One was set up at the foot of the mountain, at Myatheindan pagoda, Ayetthema. It was moved to Phayre Museum, Rangoon, and is now at Rangoon University Library.

SHWE-CHAUNG KU-BYAUK-NG? temple (Pls. 243-245) It stands on the E. bank of the Shw6 Chaung, about a furlong above the point where the Pagan - Nyaung-u road crosses it. One of Kyanzittha's notable works of merit was to send an expedition by sea to repair the Sri Vajrasana temple at Bodhgayd, where Gotama attained Buddhahood.8 The brick- work, voussoir and relieving voussoir there, visible before the last repairs (see P1. i90 d) have all the marks of Early Pagan workmanship. In the inscriptional list (probably chronological) of Kyanzittha's works of merit, this mission is placed immediately after his revision of the Tipitaka, and before his repairs to Dharmasok's ruined pagodas. The latter may well be those near Mt. Keldsa, N. of Thaton, repaired by the king in i098 A.D.9 I should therefore date, provisionally, the mission to India c. I095 A.D. The returning architects, in turn, made popular at Pagan the overgrown Bodhgayd Sikhara, with tier on tier and row on row of carved panels, amalakas and tondoes.10. rf Bajrds, as it was called, had long been known at Paga'n from illustrations on votive tablets, and a short fragmentary copy can still be seen in the Nanpaya gikhara (P1. I26 a), c. i060-70 A.D. Perhaps the first large copy is the one crowning Shwe Chaung Ku-byauk-nge (P1. 244 a). The curving mitre-like profile of the Pagan Sikhara (based, I suppose, on the Saka cap11 or Indian jatdmukuta) is still maintained; but in other respects the Bodhgayd model is followed on a reduced scale: the projecting central triangle with squared doors at the base; the two recessions towards each side; and the climbing lines of tondoes interrupted by the jagged edge of dmalakas. The temple is otherwise of pure 'Mon' type, and on a grand scale. It is much larger than the Abe- yadana, larger too than Rdjakumdr's Kubyauk-gyi, but not so large as Nagayon12. If it is not the work of Kyanzittha himself (and the general absence of stonework, as in the Abeyadana, rather suggests this), it may well be that of a great person of his court, say (but this is guesswork) the ma- hathera Arahan, or Rajakumar's mother, queen Trilokavatahsika. So far as one can judge at present, there is little writing on the walls. There is certainly a Jataka series painted on the side-walls of the Hall. Col. Ba Shin has been able to read about 40 fragmentary glosses in Old Mon beneath them. Script and spelling correspond almost exactly to those of Kyanzittha. I have also noticed a few bits of writing in the W. bay at the back of the temple; so the present bareness may be partly due to poor quality of the ink. But this is not a common fault at Pagan; and I prefer to believe that the lack of writing other than Jatakas points to an early date, before Kyanzittha's publishing of the Tipitaka had taken much effect. The temple faces E. There is no glazed-work except, perhaps, at the lower corners of the roof. In spite of ruin, the stucco-carving, both in variety and excellence, far surpasses that of Nagayon and 8 See Epig. Birm. I, Part II, Inscr. VIII, Face A, lines 4-7. 9 See note 4 supra. 10 For the Bodhgaya temple, see H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, Vol. II, PI. 99. But I doubt if this should be dated "VIIth to VIIIth century A.D." Kyanzittha's inscription says it was destroyed ka das patika, "beyond repair" (Epig. Birm. I, Part II, p. 156, n. 7, 8). 11 For the 8aka conical cap of the Kusana period, cf. V.S.

In our period none except the Myin- kaba Kubyaukgyi and Myeb6ntha Payahla can rival it. The crowning stupa is lost, but the sikhara below it is almost complete. The gikhara-motif reappears on the squared corner-stupas of the lowest roof terrace, and again on the central pediments of the S., W. and N. sides. The two upper terraces had rounded pillar-stupas at their corners, rather like the Bodhgayd pinnacles. Apart from the Corri- dor's half-vaulting (always a danger in these 'Mon' temples), the weakest part of the structure is the vertical plinth-moulding at the base. The Shw6 Chaung, normally a dry riverbed, can sometimes rise in spate. Possibly it has sapped the sand-foundations of the temple. Or else the weakness may be due to the absence of those stone tenons at the corners, which still keep firm the almost vertical plinths of Somin-gyi. But that is on high ground. Above the plinth the double lotus band embraces the whole temple. On this, an elaborate leaf-dado rests, broken on each closed side by three tall pedimented windows, and four pilasters with high in- verted V's and delicately carved capitals and tori. Corner-pilasters have a floral diamond embossed in the centre, and at the base a tall trefoil two-faced 'niche' of stucco, sheltering the guardian Deva, seated with one knee raised. The kfrtimukha frieze of looping beads and tassels is one of the loveliest at Paga'n. It lacks, of course, the prominence of the stone friezes of Nanpaya and Kyaukku Onhmin; but in its grace and beauty forms, with the pilasters and the lotus plinth, a perfect frame for each per- forated window, with fronton tapering step by step up to its crowning gikhara or stupa. Note the delicious detail of the under-cornice and cornice (PI. 245 a, b, c); the diamond sheathing of the cord moulding; the up-swaying lines of lotus petals; the lozenge chevrons; the long floral arabesque with smiling kirtimukha masks at the corners; the carved crenelle-parapet picked out in colour at the ends. The Hall is given importance, not only by its long porch and remarkable double pediment on the E., but also by double pediments over the broad and high side-windows, and a median gu (as at Pahto- thamya) at the back of its roof. It has a lower terrace of its own, with stupas at the four corners, and double-bodied lions (as at Abeyadana) in front of the roof proper. Immediately above the entrance there is a cinquefoil arch embossed over the vault. In the centre is a stupa-finial on tiers of carved roofing. At the lower corners, in place of Makaras, there are large Vydlas standing on small Elephants. From the mouths of the Vyalas depend long vertical tassels of flowers. All this is enclosed in a tall square frame of double-V pilasters, supporting a high Makara pediment, buttressed by two half- pediments at the sides. Large and long as it is, the Hall has no side-entrances. Here, within the thick side-walls, single openings with square-arched facing lead to two kammatthan cells on the N. side, and one on the S. In- stead of the 4th cell (see Plan at PI. 243 c) there is a staircase mounting westwards to the roof. Jdtaka paintings with faint Mon glosses line both walls. Five rows are still visible. The series begins with the top row on the S. wall above the window; then crosses to the N. wall; then to the 2nd row on the S. wall, and so on. The last gloss Col. Ba Shin could read was Jdtaka 283 in the 5th row on the S. wall, W. of the window. The inner wall has two high pedimented niches with giant standing Bodhisattvas. The central pediment is traceable, but mostly lost. Between Hall and Corridor there is a long stone sill. The half-vault of the broad Corridor has partly fallen at the S.W., S.E., and N.E. corners; but it is not beyond repair. The inner wall is very high. At the E. entrance to the Shrine there is a Makara</page><page sequence="369">Chapter XVII 349 archway of the old type, with spires inclining to the centre, under the stupa-finial. At the N. and S. sides, above the open windows giving on the Shrine, there are tall Mon horizontal pediments faced with Makara verticals, under ?ikhara-stupas. The W. inner wall has a deep recess in the centre, with throne and colossal Earth-touching Buddha, under a massive Makara-pediment backed on Mon horizontals. The colossal throned Buddha in the Shrine, now headless, was also touching Earth, with two small figures (Sdriputta and Moggalldna) kneeling in the corners behind his knees. A large stone tenon, now fallen, apparently joined the Buddha's body to the thin wall behind. The inner wall of the Corridor has high corner-pilasters, and a short plinth recessed with pockets for plaques. Many painted trefoil niches can be seen on both sides, but images and paintings are mostly lost. On the N. and S. sides of the outer wall, above a broad floral band, there are five tiers of seated Buddhas, painted, reaching to the roof, where the ceiling paintings are all lost. At each corner of the outer wall of the Corridor, beyond the windows, there are tall trefoil niches, holding brick and plaster images of the Eight Scenes. All are more or less in ruin; but they were pro- bably as follows: - S. wall, S.E. corner - A large niche. Query Maya's dream ? (Mountains are shown in the background.) S. wall, S.W. corner - Pdrileyyaka scene. (The Buddha sits in pralambandsana.) W. wall, S.W. corner - NdIdgiri elephant scene. (Elephant not visible. The Buddha stands in varada mudrd between two monks with almsbowls.) W. wall, N.W. corner - Descent from Thvatirhsa. (The Buddha stands between Brahmd and Indra.) N. wall, N.W. corner - Seated Buddha. N. wall, N.E. corner - First Sermon (The Buddha seated in dharmacakramutdrd. Three praying Brahmds painted above.) E. wall, N.E. corner - Parinirvdna. (Praying monks painted above.) E. wall, S.E. corner - (lost) There are other sculptures on each side of the E. entrance, in large niches on the outer wall of the Corridor. The two nearest to the entrance have Standing Buddhas with hands raised before the breast (Kyanzittha's favourite mudra). Next on the S., is a large Earth-touching Buddha, representing the Enlightenment. In the corresponding middle niche on the N., there is a Buddha seated in dharmacakra- mudra, with two rows of 7 kings painted on each side. It is good to see that the Burma Archaeological Department has started on repairs to this temple - one of the great monuments of Pagan. MON GU 4i8 (PIs. 246,247) This is a small temple S.E. of Lokananda, N. of Sittana, on the W. side of the main road 3 miles S. of Paga'n. We include it in this chapter because all the writing in it is in Old Mon; and because the paint- ing, stucco-work, and general originality and workmanship are of the best 'Mon' type, with none of the cliche carelessness which creeps in after Kyanzittha's death. Much smaller than Lokahteikpan, it is similar in plan (cf. PIs. 246 e and 35I c). It has one entrance facing E.; porch, small hall, and shrine - all in a row. The Shrine is roofed with four pendentives, and lit by two small windows at the sides. The image (almost all lost) sat against the W. wall, on a throne still in fair preservation. At the top is the 'leather mat' and double lotus, with triple petal-and-tongue mouldings in stucco. Then a pellet- moulding. Then the main 'cornice' with two recessions towards the corners, all faced with foliation</page><page sequence="370">350 Chapter XVII branching from the jaws of lion-kirtimukhas: there is one lion in the centre, two at the corners, and two more at the recession-corners. Climbing lotus petals support this 'cornice'; then pellet-mouldings above and below the 'waist' of the throne. Here the central pocket-occupant is lost; but in the side- pockets are praying Brahmrs, and in the outer, lions in profile. Between the pockets are struts with diamond rosettes. Below these again are pellets; then flattened lotus spreading to the base projection, also faced with foliation branching from the mouths of kfrtimukhas. The W. wall has lost nearly all its paintings. The soffit centre has a small round lotus with overlap- ping petals within a series of floral bands, set within a frame of elaborate kyaktaiuiy (this is Brahma- loka); then a frame of small lotus and a floral band inset with Devas (this is Devaloka); then another lotus frame and 3 tiers of preaching Buddhas, seated between saints; then a broad lotus band or 'frieze'. Below all these are 6 tiers of panels, i6 inches high, and variable width. Some of the 3 upper tiers have Mon glosses, the lower 3 are mostly lost. The top two tiers show scenes from the Buddha's life. Thus: - N. wall (W. side) Top line: "This (shows) the lord Buddha... arriving at Sankassanagir" - after the descent from Thvatiihsa. N. wall (W. side) Top line: "This (shows) the lord Buddha staying in ....... city" (?) S. wall (W. side). Top line: "This is when the lord Buddha stayed in Mohclen." i.e. under the hood of the Mucalinda serpent. S. wall (W. side). Top line: "This is when the lord Buddha admonishes (ret) Dhanapal." - i.e. Dhana- pala, the Ndlgiri elephant. S. wall (W. side). 2nd line: "This is when the lord Buddha received the almsbowls of the four Lo- kap5ia kings (cattralokkapdl pan)" - on the occasion when the merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka offered their rice-cakes and honey.13 S. wall (W. side). 2nd line: "This is when the lord Buddha rotated (tuget) the Wheel of Law." - i.e. the First Sermon (Dhammacakkappavattana Suzta). The 3rd line (starting perhaps on the W. face) was devoted, it seems, to the ten Jdtakas of the Ma- hanipata: - N. wall (E. side): "(Mosatha) Jataka. The Bodhisat was ....... a wise man (pandit)." - i.e. Maho- sadha or Maha-ummagga Jataka. N. wall (E. side): "Candakumdra Jdtaka. The Bodhisat was the son of a king." -i.e. Khandahala Jataka. E. wall (N. side): "This is (Ndrada ?) JItaka. The Bodhisat was ............ E. wall (N. side): "This is Widhir... lJataka. The Bodhisat goes and seizes the tail of the horse of the Yakkha Punnaka." -'i.e. Vidhurapanita Jataka. S. Wall (E. side): "Vesantar gives his children as a gift to the brahman Juc" (Jfjaka). S. wall (E. side): "Tiger, Lion and Leopard bar the way (cir)" -against Maddi's return to the hermitage. S. wall (E. side): "This is when the queen comes ............. "-probably Phusati (see Cowell's transl., Vol. VI, p. 301). S. wall (E. side): "This is when ..... Vesantar goes out of the city" - Jetuttara (?). 13 The scene had also been carved in stone relief by the Pyu of Sri Ksetra: see A.S.I. 1928, pp. 128-9, items (a), (b). Arch.

Below (P1. 247 b), there is a short 'frieze', I5 " high, of bold arabesque, Hathsa and lotus alternating. Below these there were 5 or more tiers of large Jdtaka panels, 3 in each tier. The lowest tiers are faded. - S. side of archway. E. panel: (lost) S. side of archway. Centre panel: " .........

From the picture of the two Jdtakas (P1. 247 b), it is pretty certain that the centre panel portrays Samuddavdnija Jdtaka, No. 466, and the W. panel Kdma Jdtaka, No. 467. The latter is about the sting (salla) of desire (kdma). Two Jdtakas on the N. wall have fragmentary glosses: - N. side of archway. W. panel: .......... Jdtaka. The reverend Bodhisat is ........ the Law to the people." N. side of archway. E. panel: ............... the reverend Bodhisat is king Indra." The Hall had once lovely-coloured kyaktahuiy on the ceiling, each inset with 4 hatsas. Below is a painted kfrtimukha 'frieze' with bead tassels (P1. 247 a). Below these are fragmentary panels, without glosses to identify them. The centre panel on the S. wall shows the top of a high prasada, with wor- shippers at the sides. The top left panel shows 6 standing figures facing each other with a small um- brella in the centre: perhaps a prince and two followers on the left, and a monk and two ladies on the right. In the top right there is a caitya, and a panel showing a Bodhisattva seated in abhayamudra, with two worshippers on each side. On the N. wall there are two big panels. On the left there are two great serpents enclosing a monastery prasdda. In the top left corner the Buddha is approaching with two worshippers, and a monk (?) in clouds below. On the right of the serpents are two beaked monsters. In the right panel the Buddha stands between two tiers of flying Devas. The lower parts of all these panels are flaked. - I suspect that the pictures on the N. wall portray some of the many miracles that led up to the conversion of Uruvela Kassapa and his brothers. Those of the S. wall may possibly present Sakka's Vejayanta pdsdda in Tavatirmsa, and either the Cfildmanicetiya there or the Dussa stupa in Brahmaloka (cf. Loka-hteikpan, P1. 354). The temple has recently been repaired by the Archaeological Department. What remains of the exterior stucco work is boldly wrought after the old style. From the original brick-paved floor, sunk 4 ft. deep in the ground, rises the doubly-recessed ground plinth; and above this, a line of crenelles topped with beading and figleaf dado. Resting on the plinth-top below, and piercing the tasselled kirtimukha frieze above, are the two flame-pedimented trefoil windows. Here (P1. 247 c, e, f) the makaras spout inwards (as on the tympana and architraves of Mathurd)14, not outwards as is usual at Pagan. Vydlas with heads reverted spring from the makara jaws. Above the windows runs the astragal cord-band with its sheathing and rosettes, and climbing lotus petals leading to the foliated cornice. Three strong crenellated main terraces, and two above the Hall, lead up to what was once (I suppose) 14 See V. S. Agrawala, Sculptures... Muttra, PIs.

MYtBONTHA PAYA-HLA (Pls. 248-25I) This great temple, still in grave risk of collapse, stands in a field a quarter-mile N.E. of Shwehsan- daw pagoda. It faces East. It is one of the "five pagodas of beauty ('paya-hla')", wrongly attributed in the Chronicles15 to Narapatisithu (Caiisfi II, /1. 536 to 573 S./II74 to I211 A.D.). "They were like the work of merit made of sarakkkan sandalwood by Pasenadi king of Kosala in the lifetime of the Lord.'6 Sakra himself with his own hand madetheplaster forthesefivepagodas andoverlaid it." - Theplaster carving is, indeed, exceptionally fine. The late archaeological engineer, U Tun Saing, has pointed out to me that in some places the underlying brickwork has been specially carved to receive it. No Mon writing has yet been found in the temple; but its general plan and detail, at any rate of the ground floor, are purely 'Mon' of the best type. The chief original feature was an interesting, but hardly successful, attempt to add an upper storey. This is difficult of access now, owing to the falling-in of corridor-vaults. So far as one can judge from below, the 8ikhara is a compromise with the Bodh- gaya type, as seen on Shw6 Chaung Kubyauk-nge. A series of small tondoes runs up the central triangle, with a squared opening at the base. Below the sikhara, the roof expands so as to hold 3 arched cells on the W., N., and S. sides, their crests crowned with a large tondo answering to the smaller ones above them. On the front or E. side, the old median gu, as built out on the back of the Hall roofs of Pahtothamya, Kubyauk-nge, and other 'Mon' temples, has been integrated with the base of the gikhara, and lengthened and broadened with vaulted porch and corner-pillars and narrow high side-entrances. But until one can climb to the roof, description must remain provisional. It was the Burman architects who, from the Shw6gugyi (II3I A.D.) onwards, attempted - much more successfully - to multiply storeys and so 'achieve the pyramidal'. The Mons were usually content with a single storey; even their largest temples, Nanda and Dhammayan-gyi, are essentially one- storeyed, with a 'false' upper storey superposed. My6bontha, and also Hlaing-gu (No. I30), show that Mon architects were feeling their way in a similar direction. But whereas the Burmans added their second storey easily at the bottom, the Mons tried to add theirs by inserting it between gikhara and ground floor - a much more difficult problem of integration. At Myebontha the sikhara motif repeats itself effectively, as usual, on the corner-stupas of the lowest roof-terrace. But the long projection of the low Porch, repeating the projection of the upper storey, and the loading of its roof with yet a sixth gikhara, was not a happy solution; and the many subsidiary pillar-stupas at corners of Hall-roof and terrace and even the Porch terrace, merely bewilder. 15 U Kala, Vol. I, p. 260. Hmannan (Susodhita ed.), I, pp. 332-3. G.P.C. (transl.), p. I48. 16 Cf. the legend recorded by Fa Hsien in his Fo-kuo-chi (he stayed in Magadha for 6 years from 405 A.D. on- wards): - "When Buddha ascended into the Trayastrirhsas heavens to preach for the sake of his mother, after go days' absence, king Prasenajit desiring to see him again, carved out of the sandalwood called Gogiryacandana ('ox- head') an image of the Buddha and placed it on Buddha's throne. When Buddha returned and entered the vihara, the image, immediately quitting its place, went forward to meet him. On this, Buddha addressed these words to it: 'Return, I pray you, to your seat. After my nirvana you will be the model from which my followers shall carve their images'. On this, the figure returned to its seat. This image, as it was the very first made of all the figures of Buddha, is the one which all subsequent ages have followed as a model." (S. Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, I, Introduction p. xliv).

This is in fair condition up to the E. face of the central mass, but has fallen in on the S. and W. faces, causing their outer walls to tilt dangerously, and also on the W. half of the N. face, which remains vertical. The central pier is faced with four colossal damaged images. On the E., without recess, sat probably an Earth-touching Buddha under a painted tree. On the N., within an arched recess, was shown the Nativity: Maya and Pajdpatl, with lovely sala trees painted behind them, and the three tiers of Brahmds, Devas and Men kneeling on the left. On the S., also in an arched recess below a stupa top, sits the Preaching Buddha in dharmacakra mudra. On the W., without recess, is the Parinirvana, the Buddha lying on his couch with head to the north. Below these, all round the four sides stretches an enormous and very beautiful throne, inset with 50 stone images of Brahmd - I4 each on the S. and N. faces, ii each on the E. and W. Each Brahmd has 3 visible heads, and sits facing front in worship with- in a floral shrine. Short pillar-struts with capitals and tori divide them. Throne-mouldings above and below the Brahmds correspond exactly: first, astragal cording with sheaths and diamonds; then beading; then lotus petals climbing up or down; then bold floral arabesque along the 'cornice' above or the 'dado' below. On the outer walls 6 high steps lead up from corridor to windows (3 on each side). Each step is bordered with earthen Buddhas touching Earth. The ceiling was lined, it seems, with small tiers of preaching Buddhas. Below the corbels of these outer walls are twelve tiers of larger painted Buddhas, also in dharmacakra mudra. No glosses are visible. In the broad entrance-arch to the corridor, the soffit is painted with a central lotus surrounded by a square of many lotus-petal kyaktaiuiy. Below this, on each side there are 3 rows of preaching Buddhas. Below these on the S. wall, the Buddha is shown preaching the Abhidhamma in TavatiMsa, with stair- cases visible on either side. In the dark Hall, below the many rows of preaching Buddhas, there are various scenes - probably of the Buddha's life - on the S. wall. On the N. wall three large panels appear to show the worship of the Buddha in three mttdrds: dhydna, bhitmispars'a and dharmacakra. The arrangement of staircase and 3 kammatthihn cells in the side-walls of the Hall, is as in Shw6- chaung Kubyauk-nge. At the entrance to both Porch and Hall there are huge stone sills. After the Brahmd throne, the chief beauty of the temple is its exterior walls - a precarious beauty: for there are ominous cracks and breaks near the S.W. and N.W. corners; the W. wall is beginning to tilt; and the S. wall is tilting badly. Yet all three walls have long sections in almost perfect condition: continuous kxrtimukha frieze with beaded loops and anchor-tassels; most of the 9 stone windows'7, with 4 X 5 round holes, each edged with leaflet and bead, and diamonds between; their richly decor- ated toranas and cinquefoil flame-pediments, backed on to horizontal tiers with stupa-finials; gorgeous V and diamond corner-pilasters; peepal leaf and beaded dado; all-embracing lotus-bed; bulging kalas'a plinth; and elaborate cornice-mouldings similar to those of Shwe-chaung Kubyauk-nge. One notices the floral and jewelled nature of most of this decoration. There are no Makaras, no Srt; no birds nor living things, apart from the kUrtimukha and saints on lotuses on the porch. HLAING GU I30 (PIs. 252, 253) This temple stands in ruin about a hundred yards N.E. of A16pyi' temple. Whatever its date may be, we place it next to Mydbontha Payahla, because both represent similar 'Mon' attempts to add a 17 Add the 2 taller windows of the Hall, with 4 x 6 perforations and plain horizontal caps. 23</page><page sequence="374">354 Chapter XVII second storey, between ground floor and gikhara. It is smaller in plan than Myebontha, but much higher. The main storey is so high that no attempt was made to connect base and cornice in the beautiful way this is done on My6bontha, Shwe Chaung Kubyauk-ng6 or Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi. The peak of the floral flame-pediments above the Hlaing Gu windows only reaches half way up the walls. Its gikhara is of normal Pagan pattern, without reference to the Bodhgayd model. The gikhara-motif may have been repeated on the terrace corner-stupas: I doubt if there was also a gikhara on the porch: it looks more like a triple pediment. The upper storey is also probably higher than that of My6bontha. It is similarly placed below the gikhara, with 3 high narrow pedimented archways of entrance to the upper hall, and a through vista from side to side. The upper shrine had narrow side windows immediately below the gikhara. But not being able to climb the ruin, I cannot speak with assurance. The staircase, as in Myebontha and Kubyauk-nge, climbs from the S. side-archway of the main Hall, and emerges in the S.W. corner of the terrace below the flat Hall-roof. Both storeys have the kTrtimukha frieze, climbing lotus petals, and low crenellated parapets. On the ground floor the plinth-mouldings are weak below the main double-lotus bed. The S. and E. walls are still in fair condition; but the N. wall has all fallen, exposing the bare central pier, and the lean-to vaulting fallen in on the N. and W. There is also a hole in the Hall roof near the entrance. But this ruined temple is not without its beauties. The Hall, long, broad and high, has its inner wall embossed with a cinquefoil torana, and a great Kyak Sri and Makara pediment, with thrones for seated Bodhisattvas in the bottom corners. The jambs of the torana still have good floral ornament of 'Mon' type. The inner orders of the arch were painted. Beyond the archway, in almost perfect con- dition, is the S4r and Makara pediment framing the main Earth-touching Buddha (half defaced) in his recess. His throne is buried in debris, but the toratia is one of the finest in Pagan. There are faded paintings of saints in the recess, and a large Apsaras. The walls of the corridors are blank. The broad side-entrances of the Hall have the Mon horizontal pediment and squared stupa at the top. HLAING-SHt GU 25I (Pls. 254, 255). 1 mile S.E. of Alopyi', near Nab~daw, W. of the Shwe Chaung, is another 'Mon' half-ruin of the best period. It faces E., and has all the usual components: porch, hall, corridor and shrine, with staircase climbing from the centre of the S. side of the hall. In ground plan it comes close to Hlaing Gu, but it is far less high; and with its central shrine and richly decorated outer walls it is much closer to Shw6 Chaung Kubyauk-nge. The corridor roof has fallen on all sides except the E., leaving the hall intact but more or less isolated, and the central section of the W. wall (perhaps the finest part extant) completely so. The S. wall has entirely collapsed. Bricks are large, but sandy. Where the stucco-work remains, it has a beauty and a delicacy hard to match on any other temple. In the stone carving of its perforated windows, it cannot equal Myebontha in quantity, but excells it in variety. The Sikhara top shows no influence of Bodhgaya. The central triangle on the W. has a gorgeous flower-fountain (P1. 254 b), supported on the head and hands of a bird-eared kfrtim~ukha. There were the usual 3 windows on each of the 3 closed sides. But the masonry was rather thin; and (as at My6-</page><page sequence="375">Chapter XVII 355 bontha) earthquake attacked first the half-vaults and the windows, especially the corner-windows, causing the outer walls to crack open, tilt or fall. The isolated W. wall gives the clearest view of the original design. Upon the plinth-mouldings (largely buried) rested the main double lotus bed enclosing the whole temple. On this was set the beaded figleaf dado, broken by the jambs of the window- toranas (PI. 255 b). The W. window consists of perforated stone squares: in the centre, squared seg- ments of circles with four hearts at the corners. The highly decorated capitals support a floral flame- pediment, the horizontals of the stupa-terraces now confined to the peak. Makaras have now passed into crested volutes. To support the cornice, the peak of the pediment cuts across the large square loops of kfrtimukha frieze, enclosing long flower-tassels, with dangled bulbs between the loops. Above these, there is a delicious arching mouth-teeth-and-tongue moulding; then astragal cording, with sheaths and flower-diamonds between them; then climbing lotus petals; then flat cornice with floral arabesque; and finally, the parapet of low crenelles. Over the E. entrance there is a fine floral triple pediment; with a cornucopia between the clec, all foliated and various, like that of Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi. The N. and S. windows of the dark Hall are also of stone, quite different from the W. window: diamond squares with diamond holes (3 x 4), each diamond edged with beading, enclosing two layers of lotus petal and central bud, with floral tongues to fill the corners. The pediment bears a flower-fountain in the centre, two 'flames' and a double beaded volute on each side. Cinquefoil below, it is backed on to 'Mon' horizontals, tapering to double lotus and the stupa-finial. The same klrtimukha frieze, dado and lotus bed embrace both hall and temple. There were probably the usual corner-pilasters, embossed with up-and-down-turned V's and flower-diamond between. Prof. Daw Thin Kyi first pointed out to me that there are large paintings of the Eight Scenes all round the Shrine. Including (I) the central image of the Earth-touching Buddha to represent the Enlightenment, the painted panels are as follows: - (2) . N. wall, N.E. corner: - the Nativity. (3). N. wall, Centre: - the Twin Miracles. (4). N. wall, N. W. corner: - the Descent from Tavatirisa. (5). S. wall, S.E. corner: - Taming of the Nalagiri elephant. Height of panel: 4 ft. 3 in. Breadth: 3 ft. 4 in. (the breadth of the panels varies). (6). S. wall, Centre: - the First Sermon. Deer on either side of the Wheel below the throne. (7). S. wall, S.W. corner: - Parileyyaka retreat. The Buddha sits in pralambanasana, facing W. (8) Above the E. entrance-arch to the Shrine: - the Parinirvana. In the soffit above are probably the sacred Footprints; also lines of flower-medallions, large lotus arabesque, and a lower line of Buddhas seated between saints. No written glosses were noticed.

It is at present under excavation by the Archaeological Department, and can only be mentioned briefly here. Externally, it looks like a typical 'Mon' temple in ruin: gikhara top, roofs ruinous, corridor vaults fallen in, wholly on the E. (the back), mostly on the N., and partly on the S. There is a long vaulted porch on the W. The square Hall, with two side-entrances, is 'Mon' in style: side-walls arching from the floor, and inner wall vertical, hall and temple not integrated. Painted panels cover the walls, but no longer the ceiling. Instead of Bodhisattva Guardians there are kammatthdn cells in the inner corners, and also in the adjacent corners of the corridor. The main block has the usual 3 perforated brick win- dows in each closed face, with foliated flame-pediments and 4 x 6 holes, diamond-shaped in the central window, round in those near the corners. A larger diamond-hole is opened above, below the lobes of the pediment. Apart from cornice, plain corner-pilasters and damaged plinth-mouldings, there is little more to be seen outside but ruin. Within, there is a central pier with four large recesses all elaborately carved with stucco hard as stone. On the W., the headless main image was probably the Earth-touching Buddha. He sits on a great carved throne, under a seven-lobed Makara flame-pediment, a flower-fountain taking the place of ?rT at the apex. In the S. recess, the image - though head, arms and right leg are lost - is clearly a Bodhisattva, possibly Lokandtha, with rich breast and thigh ornaments. The face of the pediment above him is finely carved. At the peak of the innermost band grins the Kfrtimukha, with elbows, cheeks and fingers busy holding the stalks from which intricate floral arabesques descend to the torana-capitals. Behind and above him, spreads a smooth elliptic orb - symbol (it seems) of the Sun rising over Mt. Yugandhara. All around are the serried peaks or beaks of mountains, Mt. Sineru, with four empty pedimented caves (for Pacceka-Buddhas), and above them the five trefoil niches (also empty) reserved for the Five Jina or Dhydni-Buddhas. Demon faces peer, or are shown in paint, worshipping. A similar KfrtimkIkha crowns the N. recess, with Mt. Sineru's jostling peaks and jungles; but when we visited the temple, the N. and E. recess were still awaiting excavation. Surely there is here some East Bengal Mahdydnist element, comparable to that in the Abeyadana. One remembers what the Chronicles say of Kyanzittha in his old age: - "One day eight noble saints stood for alms at the king's palace. And the king took the bowl and fed them. And he asked 'Whence come ye?' And they said 'From Mt. Gandhamadana'.... And he built and offered them a monastery for the rainy season... Once he entreated them to call up by their power the likeness of Nandamfila Cave on Mt. Gandhamadana. And they did so. And the king made a great goi after the likeness of Nandam-ila gil, and called it Nanda ....... '9 U Kala, VoL I, p. 217. Hmannan (Susodhita ed.) I, p. 29o. G.P.C.

At the end of the last Chapter we quoted a passage from the Chronicles about the visit to Pagan, during the latter part of Kyanzittha's reign, of eight monks from Mt. Gandhamddana in the Hima- layas, and the building of Nanda temple. Kyanzittha had obvious links, through his chief queen Abeyadana, with the Thntric Mahdydnists of East Bengal. Now ever since the time of the Pala prince, Pandit Atiga, before the middle of the iith century, the close connections of East Bengal with Tibet and Nepal had caused a Buddhist revival in those regions. "Tibetan art" says Rens Grousset', "de- rives directly from Indian art. Tibetan painting ..... connects with Bengali and Nepalese miniatures, and Tibetan bronzes similarly recall those of Nepal. Nothing is more remarkable than the fidelity with which Tibet has thus preserved across the centuries, even in minutest details, the arrangement of Indian compositions." - There is good reason to believe that this Bengali-Nepalese art, both in bronze- work and painting, had its influence on that of Paga'n. Whether it equally influenced Paga'n archi- tecture is much more doubtful. The Nanda (PIs. 264-334) was probably the last of Kyanzittha's temples. It is not mentioned in his Prome Inscription No. VIII, in which he reviews the chief events of his reign. It may be dated, I suggest, c. II05 A.D. From the roof of his new palace built in II02 A.D., it spread full in view above the city's wall, and was also mirrored in the moat.2 On this west side, the two main niches to left and right of the colossal standing Buddha, hold statues, above life-size, of a kneeling king on the right, and a kneeling monk on the left - doubtless the royal donor and his primate the mahdthera Arahan (PI. 276 a, b). The modern name Ananda is a corruption of Nanda or Nandamzila, the famous caves in the Hima- laya. There is no reason to connect it with the great thera, first cousin and loving follower of the Buddha. There is nothing Thntric or Mahdydnist about it. Indeed I suspect that it reflects the Thera- vadin ideals of Mahdthera Arahan rather than those of the king. There are a good many indications that Kyanzittha remained to the last large-minded in his attitude to Buddhism. He certainly had a habit of prefixing the term Nirbbdn to his works of merit, as if to remind himself that Nirvana is the true goal of the Theravadin. But his unswerving claims to be an Avatar of Visnu, and also a Future Buddha, and his obvious attachment to his Mahdydnist and (I suspect) Bengali queen, pulled him in a different direction. Perhaps in his old age he found comfort in the thought that he would be reborn, as a Pacceka Buddha, on Mt. Gandhamadana. 1 Histoire de l'Extryeme-0rient (1929 ed.), p. 365 (translated from the French). 2 One can still see it so, after heavy rain: see P1. 265.</page><page sequence="378">358 Chapter XVIII Gandhamddana, says Malalasekera3, "is one of the five mountain ranges that encircle Anotatta..... In the range is an inclined slope named Nandamfilaka, containing three caves, Suvanna-, Mani-, and Rajata-guhd, which are the abodes of Pacceka Buddhas." There are frequent references in the Jdtakas4 to the Nandamfila caves. As an ageing Christian saint will dream of Paradise, so would Kyanzittha of Nandarniila Cave, his destined heaven of rebirth. Most of the 'Mon' temples hitherto described are asymmetric. No building in the world is more perfectly symmetrical than Nanda. Artistic preference may well have influenced Kyanzittha; and several of the earlier 'Mon' temples were symmetric, as we have seen; but there were other reasons for the change, as we shall see. Noting the story about Nandamfila Cave, Duroiselle, in his important memoir on the temple5, looked for its prototype in N. Bengal, and found it in the vast symmetrical temple at Paharpur6, RMjshahi district (Paun4ravardhana). A closer model, both for the Nanda and the 'Old Mon' style of architecture generally, could be found in the recent 'Mainamati' excavations on the Lal Mai ridge W. of Comilla (Samatata) in East Pakistan.7 This area, the Patikkard of Old Burmese, contains the Buddhist Salban Vihdra, which originally "took the form of a cross measuring I70 feet from arm to arm, and resembling the Paharpur cruciform monument...." None of these monuments appear to use the radiating Arch, which was certainly known in Burma from the 7th - 8th century A.D. The closest model for all these Pagan temples, symmetric or asym- metric, are the small vaulted brick temples of 8ri Ksetra (Old Prome): Bebe, Lemyet-hna, East Zegu, etc. The East Zegu, the most advanced in style, is asymmetric. The LUmyet-hna is perfectly symmetric, and holds Pyu stone reliefs on all four sides, and a vaulted corridor surrounding them. It is quite possible that the ultimate model for all the vaulted temples of 8ri Ksetra should be sought in Bihar or Bengal, Gupta period. But in IIOO A.D. Pagan had little need to go to Bengal for lessons in archi- tecture, though in other arts that influence was potent. Kyanzittha himself had sent his architects to repair the Sri VajrAsana temple at Bodhgayd; and their fine Pagan masonry, typical even in ruin, can still be seen in photographs taken before the last repairs (PI. i90 d). Nanda temple, Kyanzittha's masterpiece, the climax of 'Old Mon' architecture, stands just outside the walls of Pagan, S.E. of Tharaba Gate. It enshrines the four Buddhas of the present kalpa: Kakusandha (N.), Konagamana (E.), Kassapa (S.), and Gotama (W.). They were already a favourite theme of Pyu art. 8ri Prabhuvarma's round Tree-casket, found in Khin Ba's mound at 8ri Ksetra8, is embossed with these four Earth-touching Buddhas, seated facing the four quarters, each with his disciple. Another square silver stupa in the same mound shows the four seated alone in dhydna 3 Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol. I, pp. 746-8. 4 See Cowell, The jftaka, Index Vol., s.v.

But here, at Nanda, the scale is grand. - In the centre a great cube, 87 ft. broad rises i6o ft. to the spire. Within its four faces, in deep recesses 52 ft. high, stand the four stately Buddhas, wooden statues 32 ft. high above their 8 ft. thrones. Two Corridors, outer and inner, surround the central cube, their half-vaults heaving inwards and upwards in darkening epicycle. Great wooden doors, 25j ft. high, on all four fronts divide the Temple proper from the Halls. Beyond this square of nearly 200 ft., extend four broad four-pillared Halls, 56 ft. long by 93 ft. wide, with main and side entrances. Thus Square and Halls compose a Greek cross, more than 250 ft. each way along the axes. The whole is set within a square enclosure, nearly 200 yards across, bounded by a wall I2 ft. high, 91 ft. thick at the base, embossed on the outer side with a thousand squared archaic stupas in relief, and pierced at the axial points by massive gateways 48 ft. high. The four gateways (muk) are cubic masses vaulted with four pendentives within, faced with broad makara pediments without. They have no corner stupas. The lower ogee roof, topped by five small retreating terraces, supports a short thick sikhara, dmalaka, and stupa-finial. The cella of each gate holds two side-niches for guardian Bodhisattvas, made of brick and painted stucco, seated in ardhaparyaitkdsana. Seen from without, behind the great triple makara toraVas enclosing the four entrances and windows of the Halls, and the other shorter ones framing a false upper storey, towers the graceful central gikhara, with its four guardian Devas and five tiers of Buddha-niches. It rests on three crenelle- terraces with medial arches, guarded at the corners by two-bodied lions. Below, four square corner- stupas distribute the gikhara-motif, and accentuate that of the false upper storey which projects medially. Thereafter the roof pours down in spreading ogee curves over the corridors, stemmed by crenellated parapets and 'bell'-pagodas at the corners, and breaks to left and right over the long roof- ridges of the halls. Double-bodied lions alternate with guardian Devas at all corners. Lions facing sideways guard the flanks above the 'flames' of the facades. The sikhara-motif, this time in relief, recurs above the dvdrapdla-niches to left and right of each main entrance. All terraces from top to bottom were once brilliantly inlaid with green-glazed plaques (now mostly matt with whitewash), I464 altogether." Those of the parapets above the corridors and halls (537) present the bulk of the Jdtakas, each identified by Pali name and number. It is the most complete series of Jdtaka-plaques at Paga'n. Above them, plaques of the top four terraces present 375 scenes, each with Old Mon gloss, to illustrate the last ten Jitakas. Plaques of the ground-plinth, 552 in all, each with Old Mon gloss, show on the W. side the various monsters of Mdra's army, who vainly attacked the Buddha on the eve of his Enlightenment. On the E. side the Gods celebrate the Buddha's triumph - a procession of Devas and other mighty beings swelling his pomp, holding auspicious emblems. 9 ibid., PI. XL (f). Note also the four-faced gold image-stupa found in the relic-chamber of Kyaik De: ap, Bo-t&amp;- htaung pagoda, Rangoon. Here all the Buddhas sit in diydna mudrd (Arch.

These measure about I41 inches square, by 3 inches thick. The scene of Mdra's attack is not presented dramatically, as on the S. corridor-walls of Nagayon and Abeyadana; but piecemeal, showing the components of his army: - First, the Riders on Animals: Elephants, Horses, Lions, Tigers, Rhinoceros, clmcf (Tapirs ? or another kind of Rhino- ceros ?), Buffaloes, Cattle, Capricorn (makara), Camel, Leopard, Pigs, Hog-deer, Hares, Jackals, Leogryphs (vylla), the Ram (Aries), Ndgas, Suparnas, Vultures, Wild Duck, and Bears.13 Then, Monsters with the faces of Men, Lions, Elephants, Vultures, Cattle, Tigers, Ravens (kil-dk), Ndgas, Buffaloes and Horses. Then, Monsters with Snakes (jrunt) issuing from eyes, ears, nose, mouth or head; or again with Snakes as eyes, ears, nose, mouth or head. The heavenly and other mighty beings who celebrate the Buddha's triumph along the E. side of the ground-plinth, include Mon clan-spirits (kindok), Suparnas, NMgas, Kumbhandas, Devas and Devis; the 4 Yama kings of Death at the 4 gates of hell; the Regents of the Four Quarters - Dalaratha (E.), Vilfirak (S.), Virfipakkha (W.), and Kuver (N.). The last, Kubera or Vaisravana, lord of the Yaksas, is near the N. entrance, together with his 28 Generals (yakkha sendpati)14 as listed in the Mahdsamaya and Ajtndtiya Suttas (Nos. 20, 32) of the Dfgha Nikdya. Four Asuras are also in the procession: Asurinda, Vepacitti, Sucitti and perhaps Pahdrdda, also Brumha and In (Brahmd and Indra) on a single plaque at the E. entrance. The 20 auspicious Emblems which they bear, though each is shown in relief on several plaques, are not all easy to identify. U Mya made a good beginning by comparison with the io8 auspicious Signs on the Footprint of the Buddha.15 So many of the Emblems and Signs agree, that one is led to expect that all the 2o are included in the io8. Perhaps i5 are there: but dandadfp (Lampstand), bac (Vajra, Thunderbolt) 16, and dial (Mirror) are not to be found; and troit and timbait have not been certainly identified. Troi is shown on the plaques to be a pot-like receptacle, rather more rectangular than thmbdy, the ordinary pot.

Why four Halls instead of the usual one ? - In changing from One Hall architecture to Four, Kyanzittha was mainly guided, I believe, by conditions of the time. No less than Aniruddha, he was a devotee of Buddhism. But he knew that his common people, still illiterate and animist, were only skin-deep Buddhists. Many passages in his in- scriptions prove that both he and his mahdthera Arahan made popular religious education their prime concern. Barely a generation had passed since they first got copies of the Tipitaka from Ceylon, and began to study and collate them. In this early part of the Pagan period, "Indian monasteries" of brick (kild kloii) are much rarer than they will be later at Minnanthu, where there are scores of them. But there were doubtless many of wood; and there is ample evidence to show that from the first these monasteries undertook the education of the young.22 The older villagers were encouraged, I believe, to spend their four fast days a month at the pagoda, where the king found by experience (like the Indo- Greeks of Gandhdra) that the most effective way to teach them Buddhism was to give them a large number of images to worship. In the Nagayon he had tried both painting and sculpture. Paintings on the corridor-walls were too dark and too high to serve his purpose. In the well-lighted Halls of Nanda, under the whitewash, one can still descry rows of original painting in the soffits of the lower arches. But stone sculpture easily dominates. The Nanda is, indeed, the first great storehouse of Buddhist sculpture in Burma. And the vast majority of the stone reliefs, at any rate those visible from below, appear to date from Kyanzittha's time or not long after. Duroiselle counts "about I420" images.23 Our total, for the in- terior niches only, is I535. The topmost rows of niches in the corridors are difficult to reach, and even 17 See PI. 204, painting No. 23 in Nagay6n temple (supra, p. 3i8). 18 Epig. Birm. III, Part I, Inscr.

The only internal staircases (in the raised cross-passages of the E. outer corridor, on either side of the central doors) lead only to dangerous ledges, where one may sit in space and medi- tate on vanity. The Eight Scenes of the Buddha's life have an iconography going back many centuries in India. Here not many liberties could be taken by the Paga'n sculptor. But scope for carving lay in the back- ground, especially the reredos, ('tig&amp; (Old Burm. tankkay). Some stone reliefs in the E. shed at Pagan Museum have an almost plain 'tage'.24 But before the Pagan period, the Mons of Pegu had found that greater depth and richness could be got by setting the human form in bold relief against a reredos in faint and flat relief.25 The 't g&amp; was useful for suggesting landscape, trees, flowers, mountain caves, clouds and spirits of the sky, and, incidentally, for supplying nimbus or halo to the saints portrayed. Here they were not always nice: omitting the Buddha's halo perhaps, and giving one even to the villain in the piece.26 On Gupta reliefs in India, and also on the votive tablets of Sri Ksetra, the Buddha- image was often set in a frame of Makara/Vydla/Elephant. These tended to pass into geometric and architectural forms. The horizontal lines of plinth and cornice gave firmness and unity to the figures they framed; and at the shoulders, instead of the Makara, pairs of Hatihsas would perch, depending pearls; or Kinnara musicians, half-man half-bird; or geometric diamonds would jut, suggesting radiant strength.27 The twelve reliefs still left at Kyaukku Onhmin, perhaps the first stone images extant at Pagan, make use of architecture as background to the Buddha, seated or standing.28 Kyanzittha made per- haps excessive use of it, at both the Nagayan and the Nanda. (His wife, so far as we know, made little or no use of it in the Abeyadana.) It was a time of transition from native wooden architecture and sculpture to the brick and stucco learnt from India. Both types are seen in backgrounds to Kyan- zittha's images, sometimes combined, especially in Nagayon - brick facades roofed with wooden gables. But in general, wooden posts and lintels framed interior scenes, while cornice and plinth-mouldings and facades denoted exteriors. One must not be surprised to find a palace set just behind or under the peepal, banyan, ironwood or sdla tree, on the banks of the river Anomd, or in Pdrileyya or Miga- davana forests.29 They serve a purely artistic purpose, and have no relevance to the story. If we may take as 'rejects' the many old reliefs relegated to the cross-passages of Nanda (Pls. 318-323), we have perhaps some measure of Kyanzittha's likes and dislikes. He insisted on symmetry. Any sculpture is rejected where, e.g., the throne is not set in the exact centre.30 For stone images he rejected woodcarving techniques, the smooth and supple modelling of the Old Burma wood-carver, with his plain blank surfaces alternating with intricately carved ones. Like Keats, he preferred to "load every rift with ore." In consequence he rejected some of the best and simplest carvings of the older school.3' But many other carvings which he rejected, show that he was right to impose discipline 24 See PIs. 407 a, b, c; 4og d. 25 e.g. the Nagawun Thein sculpture 5 miles S. of Pegu (Arch. Neg. 4207, 7710, 7711), or that in the theni' at East Shwenatha Kyaungdaik (Arch. Neg. 7698). 26 At P1. 297 (a), where Myra is arguing with the Buddha just before the Enlightenment, he has a halo. 27 "Elements of sun- and fire-worship are certainly indicated in early Buddhist art; we find the worship of a flaming pillar, and later, Buddhas, givas and kings (coins of Kaniska) with flames rising from their shoulders, while the nimbus is of solar origin and must have originated either in India or Persia."

Often there was no unity of design: a seated figure on one side, a standing figure on the other, and nothing between to connect them;32 or a relief divided, top and bottom, into two almost equal unrelated panels.33 Predellas he approved: a large Buddha above, in one or other of the accepted poses; below, a small predella, to identify the scene. But the means to do so are often meagre: four monks in worship hardly suffice. And though the total effect of such a relief may please, or even move the devout, it gets monotonous. If the architectural background forced some unity in design, it also numbed movement, life and action. P1. 320 (c) shows the curious effect of a fixed facade serving as background to a moving boat. The tendency has been to petrify religious sculpture in a lifeless, hier- atic groove; and by cutting out distance, chiaroscuro, and perspective, to confine it to two-dimensional decoration. The Indian sculptor's device to make the Buddha twice as tall as those around him, while satisfying to piety (Kyanzittha was very pious),34 also served to unify, but deaden. Nanda sculptures may be classified in four main divisions: - (i) The educational series in the Halls. (ii) the Life of Gotama up to the moment of Enlightenment, as told in 8o sculptures in two tiers of the outer wall of the outer corridor. (iii) the devotional series as found in most of the other niches in the inner walls. (iv) the miscellaneous collection of smaller sculptures, rejects (?), some early and unconventional, found in the raised cross-passages on either side of the outer corridor. (i) HALL SCULPTURES. (PIs. 298-3i2). - The stone reliefs in the four Halls give a selection of scenes covering the whole life of the Buddha, from the Conception (Maya's Dream) to the Parinir- vana. lEach Hall holds i6 sculptures: similar to those of the outer corridor, but generally more worn (especially at the base) and less gilded.35 After brief comparison one sees that these i6 sculptures formed originally a closed series, almost the same, and following the same arrangement, in each of the four Halls. We have seen in the Nagayon Hall a smaller, but similar, arrangement of sculptures, fore- running the Nanda. Let us number these niches and sculptures serially i to i6, starting with the first niche (i) on one's left as one enters the Hall, and then going the round of the Hall so as to end with the last niche (i6) on one's right at the same entrance: - Sculpture 4 in all 4 Halls illustrates the Descent from Thvatiihsa (E.4, S.4, W.4, N.4). Sculpture 5 in all 4 Halls illustrates the Nativity (E.5, S.5, W.5, N.5). Sculpture 6 in all 4 Halls illustrates the Parinirvana (E.6, S.6, W.6, N.6). Sculpture ii in all 4 Halls illustrates the Conception or Maya's Dream (E.ii, S.II, W.ii, N.ii). Sculpture I4 in all 4 Halls illustrates Sujata and her Goats (E.I4, S.14, W.14, N.I4). What of the remainder? - By comparison, one can sometimes trace the original subject, allowing for subsequent loss, transfer, or intrusion intended to fill gaps. Thus: - 32e.g. Pls. 32ia, d; 322 a. 33 e.g. Pls. 3i8 a, 3i9 d, 32i e, 322 d. 34 P1. 3i8 f is a fine relief. Was it rejected because, compared with the two kneeling women, the Buddha was not large enough? 35 The Hall niches, enclosing the sculptures, are generally 40 to 45 inches high, and 20 to 25 inches broad at the base. The Conception and Parinirvana niches are larger - about 50 inches broad.</page><page sequence="385">Chapter XVIU 365 Sculpture I in 3 Halls illustrates the Buddha preaching, with a naked (?) figure in the right corner of the predella striding or running away (E.i, S.i, N.i). Sculpture 7 in 3 Halls illustrates the First Sermon, shown by the preaching attitude and the Deer at each end of the predella. The Wheel is not shown. (S.7, W.7, N.7). Sculpture 8 in 3 Halls illustrates the first triumphal sitting, in bhkimisparfalnudrd under the Bodhi tree, with Indra and Brahma in attendance (E.8, S.8, N.8). Sculpture 9 in 3 Halls illustrates the same scene, a second time (E.9, S.9, N.9). Sculpture I2 in 3 Halls illustrates the Buddha standing with both hands raised together before the breast (E.I2, S.J2, W.J2). Sculpture i6 in 3 Halls illustrates the Buddha seated in dhydnamudrd, with a tall king and others making offerings on the predella (E.i6, W.i6, N.i6). ii out of the original i6 subjects have thus been found and located, with certainty or probability. If one asks why it was necessary to have 2 illustrations of the same scene (8 and 9), we may note that Niches 8 and 9 are one on each side of the entrance to the temple proper, the corridors and the shrine. It was thought right, I suggest, for one mounting the steps to Buddhahood to receive acclaim from both sides rather than from one. And we remember that Kyanzittha has left two sculptures of the same scene in Nagayon (PIs. I94 e, 20i d). Certain well-known scenes occur: at W.2 the Pdrileyyaka retreat; at W.3 the NdIdgiri elephant; at S.3 the conversion of Alavaka Yakkha; at E.io the Tonsure. But these stand alone, and perhaps may be intrusive. The S. Hall holds 2 illustrations of the First Sermon (S.7, S.io); the E. Hall is the only one without this scene; I suspect, therefore, that S.io originally belonged to Niche E.7. Sculpture i, with the Buddha preaching, and a listener on the right side of the predella trying to flee or fly, is absent from W.i: but it is present at W.I5, only 2 niches away. Sculpture i2, with the Buddha standing, both hands raised before the breast, is only absent from N.i2; but it is still present in N.I3. Sculpture I3 in 2 of the Halls (E.I3, W.I3) shows the Buddha standing, right hand hanging by the side, left raised to the shoulder. This is the normal pose in the Ndlagiri scene; but here neither elephant nor monks are shown. If N.i2 and N.I3 have interchanged their original positions, it would suit the placing of both. S.15 shows the same pose. Sculpture IO in 2 of the Halls (W.io, N.io) shows a fine Buddha, almost in the round, seated in dhyina mudrU on double lotus against an elaborate double gable, the lower gable broken in order to admit his head and halo. The identification of a few scenes remains more or less doubtful. This last scene, Sculpture io, is thought to represent the Ratanaghara, N.W. of the Bodhi tree, where the Buddha spent the 4th week after the Enlightenment, meditating the Abhidhamma. This identification, first suggested by Col. Ba Shin, seems to me highly probable. In Sculpture i6, if the tall king is Binibisdra, king of Magadha, the scene should be the dedication of Veluvana. Sculpture i, certainly I think, shows the Defeat of the Heretics under Ganda's niango-tree at the gate of Sdvatthi, in the presence of king Pasenadi, just before the Buddha's performance of the Great Miracles. Kyanzittha showed the same scene in Nagayon Hall (PI. I93 d); and Mon Bo Kay has proved that the heretics are here not running away, but trying to fly. In the Nagayon, in neighbouring niches, Kyanzittha has left reliefs of the Standing Buddha (P1. 202 a) and the Walking Buddha (PI. 202 b). Similar reliefs neighbour each other in the Nanda Halls: Sculpture [2 (the Standing Buddha), and Sculpture 13 (the Walking Buddha). For Sculpture 2 we find a variety of scenes. The clearest (E.2) shows the Earth-touching Buddha seated between two praying Brahmas, with a row of 6 Deva-kings on the predella, also in prayer. E.3, next to it, shows the</page><page sequence="386">366 Chapter XVIII Earth-touching Buddha without the Brahmds, but with 4 Deva-kings in prayer on the predella. S.2 shows the Buddha seated in dhydnamudrd, with 6 figures, all in prayer on the predella - 3 men on the left, 3 women on the right. N.2 shows the Buddha in dhydnamudrd, with 8 praying figures below, mostly women (?). - Are these all aspects of one scene: the request made to the Buddha, when in doubt whether to preach his Law, by a vast deputation of Brahmas, Devas, etc., headed by Saham- pati Brahmd? - The scene is paralleled in Nagayon Hall (P1. I94 d), where the Buddha sits in dhydna- mudrd, with 6 Brahnids on the predella below. We have now accounted for I4 out of the i6 Sculptures in each Hall. Nos. 3 and i5 remain quite doubtful. Perhaps Niche 3 contained a variety of well-known scenes: Taming of Ndldgiri elephant (W.3), Conversion of Alavaka Yakkha (S.3), Pdrileyyaka retreat (W.2), the Tonsure (E.io): we put these together in P1. 3I2. Of these, only the Pdrileyyaka scene is given in Nagayon Hall (P1. I93 b). Niche I5 holds a different scene in all four Halls; two of them (W. I5 and S. I5) have been accounted for already. E. I5 shows a Preaching, N. I5 an Earth-touching Buddha. All the Nagayon scenes from the Life of the Buddha appear to have parallels in the Nanda Halls, except the Kdlandga and Sot- thiya reliefs (Pls. I93 C, 202 d), which are probably post-Kyanzitthan in date. The only additions made to the list in these Halls are the Nativity (P1. 30i) and Bimbisdra's dedication (P1. 3II), and a few stray scenes (Tonsure, Nalagiri, Alavaka, etc. - P1. 3I2). To sum up.

Why did Kyanzittha design this fourfold, almost identical, gallery of sculpture on each side of the Nanda ? - His object, I believe, and that of his mahathera Arahan, was educational. The Jataka plaques provided at several of Aniruddha's pagodas must have intrigued the Pagan villagers greatly. But their connection with Gotama Buddha was remote. Bhakti, the sense of personal involvement and devotion, had to be awakened. The Old Burman was not romantic nor sentimental. The known facts of the Buddha's life must first be placed in concrete form before him. Pictures in the dark corridors of the older temples were ineffective. Kyanzittha and Arahan relied on stone sculpture in well-lighted Halls to lead the way to bhtakti, and so to the dim religious light still thought proper for the Shrine.</page><page sequence="387">Chapter XVIII 367 In the broad Halls of Nanda they planned to cope with fast-day crowds: where, simultaneously, official Guides or Monks explained and shewed the villagers carefully selected scenes from the life of the Master. (ii) OUTER CORRIDOR. THE 8o SCENES. (Pls. 278-297). - They were then ready to enter the temple proper. Most, coming from the city, would enter by the W. Hall. The moment they passed through the great Doors into the Outer Corridor, they would turn left and make their Pradaksina ambit round the temple before entering further. At this point began the second stage of their religious education: the detailed record in chronological order of the early life of Gotama, from the time when the gods requested him, as the Bodhisatta Setaketu in Tusita heaven, to become incarnate as man. The story, conveyed in 8o relief-sculptures,36 requires a double circuit of the corridor, first following the lower tier of cinquefoil niches in the outer wall, and then the upper tier seen easily from below. Much more varied demands were made here on the skill and imagination of the sculptors; and the Eighty Reliefs, though often conventional and hieratic, include some of the best stone sculptures at Paga'n. They are also among the best preserved. So far, they have only once, I think, been fully illus- trated in print.37 They are given again here (PIs. 278-297); for the detailed list, in serial order, see the Catalogue of Plates. The story is strictly Theravdda, based mainly on the NiddnakathM, the introductory chapter of the Jctaka commentary (A vidire Niddna). Pagan scholars' study of the Singhalese Tipitaka has now had time to arrest the trend towards Mahdydnism, evident in Aniruddha, and still more so in Kyanzittha's own queen, Ablyadana. The marvellous element in the Mahdvastu and Lalitavistara is greatly re- duced in the life of Gotama as shown in the Nanda sculptures. (iii) DEVOTIONAL SERIES. - The stone sculptures of the inner wall of the outer corridor, and of both walls of the inner corridor, may be classed provisionally as 'devotional'. We know very little about them. Most, if not all, appear to relate to the period after the attainment of Buddhahood. The Buddha is always shown seated, either in bhiimisparga or dharmacakra mudrd. Perhaps here they are used interchangeably, as in the sutta-paintings of the older temples. So far as one can see from below, there is only one instance (on the innermost wall) of dhydna mudrd. A very few (see Pls. 3i6, 3I7) show the Buddha seated in unusual mudrds: (i) without usnsa, touching the Earth with the left hand, right hand against the breast; (ii) without usnTsa, right hand against breast, left in lap. All the sculptures have predellas below them to identify the scene, except those on the innermost wall, lowest tier, where only 3 out of 24 have them. Sermons, dedications, conversions and other events in the long life of the Buddha, seem to be the themes. Taken separately, few of these sculptures explain themselves. But Kyanzittha was a careful, thoughtful, and pious man; and our experience of him suggests that these sculptures are not placed haphazard: there should be an order and a system behind them. In the Series of Eighty, the order is chronological. Does this apply also to the inner corridor, and the inner face of the outer ? And if so, 36 Average height of the 8o sculptures about 40 inches, average breadth about 22 inches. 37 The full series was excellently illustrated by K. Seidenstiicker in his Siid-buddhistiche Studien. i. Die Buddha- Legende in den Skulpturen des Ananda-Tempels zu Pagan, Mitteilungen aus dem Museum fur Vdlkerkunde in Ham- burg. IV (Hamburg, i9i6). A selection (more than half, not so well illustrated) is given by Duroiselle in his learned and useful article "The Stone Sculptures in the Ananda Temple at Pagan," A.S.I. I9I4, pp. 63-97, and Pls. XXXI to XXXIX.</page><page sequence="388">368 Chapter XVIII where do they start and end ? Or do they follow the order of the Suttanta-Dfgha, Majjlima Nikaya, etc. ? - To solve such questions, the first need is to photograph,38 in serial order, at least the lower and larger rows; to identify, if possible (as Mon Bo Kay has done in the Nagayon), some scenes on the predellas, and use them as a clue to discover the system of arrangement. For the earlier years of Buddhahood, the order of events is told in texts as accessible to us, probably, as it was to scholars of Kyanzittha's time. So if there is a system, it should not be beyond our power to discover it. The discovery would surely open up vistas. A word about the Niches. - The outer sides of both corridors are plain, without gikhara-facings for the niches. Above the Series of Eighty, on the outer wall of the outer corridor, there is the narrow projecting ledge reached by staircases. Above this, there are 2 rows of (altogether) 88 niches for images, divided by the 3 upper windows on each half-face. The inner wall of the outer corridor (see P1. 270 a) is the best-lighted. It has a waist-high plinth- moulding and corner-pilasters. Each half-wall is elaborately designed and heavily gilded. Two broad and high window-openings face the raised cross-passages in the outer wall. Each window has a richly foliated kydk W torana and pediment.39 On each side of the windows, in two tiers, are 8 gikhara- topped niches holding sculptures. Above these is a horizontal band supporting another pair of pedi- mented windows, equally splendid, with a single tier of asikhara-topped niches. Thus two tiers of vistas at two points near each corner, cross the whole temple, giving graded light to both corridors. Above the third tier of asikhara-niches, another horizontal band supports a row of IO smaller gilded niches; and above these, in 3 tiers, are 47 plain small niches. These figures for the half-face must be multiplied by 8 to give the total for this inner wall of the outer corridor. None of the windows are blocked with perforated stone or brick. They are wide open: yet still bats haunt the inner corridor. Its inner wall has low, waist-high, but very strong plinth-mouldings, mas- sively projecting at the corners. The 3 main tiers of niches on this face are all topped with gikharas. The table opposite gives a brief summary of the stone sculptures visible from the floor: - (iv) SCULPTURES IN CROSS-PASSAGES (? REJECTS). -Between the inner and the outer corridor, there are raised cross-passages, admitting air, light, and often pleasing vistas. There are four such passages (I to IV) on each face, two on either side of the central doors. Between the outer corridor and the exterior (or the Halls), where the area is greater, six such passages are practised (I to VI), three on either side of the centre. On either side of each passage there is a cinquefoil image niche, about 34 inches high, 2I inches broad at the base, and i2 inches deep. There are thus i6 passages between the corridors, with 32 niches for images; and from the outer corridor outwards 24 passages with 48 (actually 46)40 niches for images. Not all these 78 niches hold images; and several that they hold are broken, conventional or post-Pagan. Splashes of lime whitewash, as usual, have contributed to the general deterioration. There is here no orderly arrangement and conservation of images such as we find elsewhere. 38 The photographer should not omit to examine the backs of the sculptures, some of which (to judge by those in the cross-passages) may bear signatures of donors, artists, etc. 39 See PI. XIV (2) of A.S.I. Memoir No. 56. 40 On the E. side, Outer Cross-passages in the N. wall of Passage III and the S. wall of Passage IV, on either side of the central doors, two sunk staircases leading up to 'the Ledge', take the place of two niches.</page><page sequence="389">Chapter XVIII 369 NANDA BUDDHA-IMAGES OUTER CORRIDOR | i | No. of Bhitmi- Dharma- D With Tier N. ~ Dhyacna Pe Niches sparsa cakra Pre- dellas O Lowest 40 4 4 I Series of Eighty.

Of the 32 sculptures illustrated here (Pls. 3i8-323), about io, telling the life of Gotama, may be an overflow from the corridors. They include (Pls. 3i8, 3I9) some of the best we have: Pajdpati Gotami's request (Outer N. II W.), Conversion of Yasa (?, Inner S. III W.), Descent from Thvatirhsa (Inner E. I N.), Ndlagiri elephant (Outer N. V E.), Parinirvdna (Inner E. II N.). - To explain our method of locating them, take this last scene as an instance: it will be found in the niche on the north wall of the I~nd cross-passage (counting clock-wise from the N.E. corner), on the E. side of the temple, between the two corridors. Apart from scenes of the Buddha's life, the majority of these sculptures perhaps illustrate Jdtakas. There is no writing to identify the scene; but in about a dozen cases the identification seems probable; and in many others one suspects a derivation from that source. The desire to illustrate the Jdtaka was one of the main artistic urges of our period, from Aniruddha onwards. At Shwdhsandaw, following Thaton precedent it seems, the carvers were content to show the story in unglazed terracotta, without gloss. At Hpet-leik they engraved name and number of the Jdtaka across the top of the plaque, still unglazed. Kyanzittha, at Shwdzigon and Nanda, transfers the writing to a label at the base. He glazed his plaques of stone or terracotta, rightly feeling the importance of colour for plaques set in pockets along the exterior. Later kings were apt to find the colour more important than the Jataka, so the glazed Jdtaka Plaque survives only spasmodically after our period. Meantime, in Kyanzittha's reign, experiments were made in the Nanda to render Jdtakas in stone: not very successful ones. Anyway the experiment was soon dropped. Perhaps it was felt that Stone (a precious material at Pagaln) should properly be confined to rendering the last life of the Master. THE FOUR SHRINES. - According to Bhattasali,41 Krakitcandra (Kakusandha) is the manusT Buddha corresponding to 'dhydni' Buddha Vairocana. Quarter: Centre. Kanakamuni (Kondgamana) is the mcdnusT Buddha corresponding to 'dhydni' Buddha Aksobhya. Quarter: East. Kas'yapa (Kassapa Dasabala) is the mdnusT Buddha corresponding to 'dhydni' Buddha Ratna- sambhava. Quarter: South. Gautama (Gotama) is the mdnusT Buddha corresponding to 'dhydni' Buddha Amitdbha. Quarter: West. The colossal wooden statue in the W. Shrine, therefore, should represent Gotama. Duroiselle says42 that only the S. and N. statues (P1. 277 a, b) are original, contemporary with the founding of the temple. Both these images have their hands raised together before the breast, as in dharmacakra miidra - a pose for the standing Buddha not uncommon at Pagaln, from the Kyaukku Onhmin (P1. I42 f) onwards. The statue in the E. Shrine has both hands hanging - an unusual pose for a Buddha. Gotama Buddha in the W. Shrine has his right hand raised from the elbow in abhaya mudrd, and left hand held out level from the elbow, palm upward. The pose is ancient, especially in bronze images; but the statue shows clear signs of repair, and does not look old. Each Buddha stands on a great double lotus, horseshoe-shaped. This rests on a huge throne which fills the breadth of the recess, and projects at the sides to form thrones for the two principal figures kneeling in the niches. Those in the W. recess would normally be the two chief disciples of Gotama, 41 N. K. Bhattasali, . . . Dacca Museum, pp. i6, i9. 42A.S.I. Memoir No. 56, p. I2 and P1. VII I, 2.</page><page sequence="391">Chapter XVIII 37I Sdriputta and Moggalldna. But here, in the principal shrine, their places are taken by the king-donor and his Mahdthera Arahan (Plate 276 b, a). The monk, in the N. wall on the right side of the colossal Buddha, "is distinguishable by his clean-shaven head and the lack of ornaments," says Duroiselle.43 He certainly looks young: not like the octogenarian which he would have been if in fact, according to the Chronicles, he first came from Thaton to Paga'n early in Aniruddha's reign. Inscriptions prove that he was Kyanzittha's "right hand man"44 right down to the building of Nanda; whether he was also that of Aniruddha, is open to question. Kyanzittha, kneeling in the S. wall, on the left side of the colossal Buddha, "has the usual royal ornaments, viz. a crown, a necklace or breastplate and anklets. His dress consists of a close-fitting jacket and a lower garment of which the folds are clearly discernible"45 - Anklets, I think, are not visible; but crown, ear-ornaments, ear-plugs, breastplate, jacket, wristlets and epaulettes are certainly there. Both faces though damaged and repaired, have a grave beauty of their own: the monk's passive but firm; the king's responsive and alert. The statues - at any rate the king's statue - is not of stone (see Mr Griswold's note in the Catalogue under P1. 276). In the three other Shrines the Buddhas are attended, each by two kneeling monks, presumably their chief disciples as named in the Buddhavaotsa, viz. North (?). Kakusandha, with disciples Vidhura and SaiiTva. East. Konigamana, with disciples Bhfyya and Uttara. South. Kassapa Dasabala, with disciples Tissa and Bhdradvaja. But Burma artists were not always accurate in these matters. On the silver-gilt casket of the Pyu king Srl Prabhuvarman and queen Srl Prabhudevi, found at Khinbagon, Srl Ksetra, the names of the four seated Buddhas are given as Gonagamona, Gagusadha, Kasyaba, and Godara. Standing on their left, are their four monks in attendance, named respectively Kasaba, Molana, Sari and .... da; i.e. Kassapa, Moggallhna, Sdriputta, and (?) Ananda. - All four, Duroiselle points out,46 were chief disciples of Gotarna Buddha, not of his predecessors. The great Thrones of the Four Buddhas, here, as in those of the 'Mon' temple W. of Taungbi tank (supra, p. 297), show in their central panels the three-headed Elephant (symbol of Omniscience ?),47 with Devas and outward-facing Lions alternating in the throne-recessions. The outer edge of the Shrine-recess is barred by a gilded openwork wooden fence (vedikd) of I2 + I2 knobbed poles, nearly a man's height. In the centre are two swing-doors, pointed upwards to the centre, their frames filled with metal diamond lattice.48 Outside, at the corners of the recess are two stupas with squared base, supporting kalpavrksa trees, about I2 ft. high, hung with stars and peepal leaf.49 High up on the side-walls of each recess are 3 niches in 2 tiers, with gilded stone reliefs. Of these 24 images, 9 are in bhfimisparsa mudra, 9 in dhydna miidrc. The latter mudrd, common in Nagayon sculptures, is rare in those of Nanda, at any rate for the period after the Enlightenment.

CENTRAL DOORS (Pls. 27i a, 272-275) The four great teakwood doors of Nanda guard the four entrances to the temple proper, be- tween Halls and Outer Corridor. At the centre, their highest point, they reach 25 ft. 71 in.; at the side-hinges 2I ft. 7 in. Each door has two wings, the wing with the median overlap being broader than the other. When closed, the two wings fill the breadth of the entrance-arch, 6 ft. At the top there is an arch, and not a lintel: so this is filled by making the inner sides of each wing higher than the outer, and adding a diagonal top-piece from one to the other, leaving a space roughly triangular, which is filled with large panels of carving - strange birds or animals affronted. The E. doors show a pair of high-backed, heavy-winged and feathered birds, with small crested pheasant-heads. The N. doors show a pair of low-backed birds of hathsa type, beaked and crested, with long curving wings and wing-tips. The W. doors confront two long-tailed staglike horned animals, with mouths agape and belling. The S. doors confront two similar animals, taller, with slighter horns, but pointed double mane and spotted breast. - The local woodcarver here let himself go, at once free from Indian conventions and from all bondage of realism. The main black oblong frame of each door-wing consists of four great batters, 8 in. square in section, mortised and criss-crossed diagonally by thinner beams (4 in. X 3 in. thick), the intersecting points of lattice studded with four-point gilded metal stars. The inner sides of each wing end in a knobbed finial. They are held in position by an iron ring at the top, braced by iron bands at the sides, and move in a stone cup below. Against this black background starred witn gold, there is set around the borders a broad plank, thickening towards the middle, of vermilion-painted wood. Here are the main carvings, I ft. broad all round. Covering top and bottom mitre-joints, there is broad flat lotus leaf (E. and N. doors), with angular overlapping oak leaf (W. and S. doors). The horizontal frames be- tween the lotus leaves are set with io round crinkled lotus flowers and beading; the vertical frames with about 54 (E. and N. doors). Oak-leaf involved at intervals with lily-leaf forms the frame of the W. doors. A rugged looped and twisted oak leaf pattern frames the S. doors. The richest carving is reserved for the median overlap, where the two door-wings meet. Here all four doors differ. And the difficult question arises, how far any or all of these doors, or parts of these doors, go back to the time of Kyanzittha. At the base of all four 'overlaps', there is a drum- like stool with banded waist, on which sits or squats the Door-Guardian - a tiny comic figure, most unlike the giant standing Bodhisattvas who guard the inner entrance to many of the older temples. The E. and N. doors provide him with a square winged pavilion arched with flame- pediments, backed against a towered stupa tapering in terraces to a pinnacle with parrots perching. On the W. door he squats heavily robed, with right knee raised and left leg twisted so as to show</page><page sequence="393">Chapter XVIII 373 the sole, brandishing a leaf-falchion. On the S. door he squats bulging, with beard, 'horns' and coiled topknot, a sword over each shoulder. Above him, on the W. and S. doors, simple and less simple pat- terns of pairs of oak leaves rise and fall symmetrically in curves, one above the other - masterly work. They are in high relief in the centre, flattened and simplified at the sides. On the E. and N. doors the crossing oakleaf pattern alternates with ribbed lotus flowers. At the top of the 'overlap', rising from luxuriant lotus, there appears to be a stupa, ringed with oakleaf. This is all very different from the carvings of the Shwezigon gandhakuti door (PIs. I78-i82). But it is all very like the doors of the Shw6gu-gyi (P1. 374 a), a temple built in II3I A.D. Top 'triangle,' hathsa carvings, lotus leaves at corners, row of crinkled lotus flowers between, overlapping oak-leaves, diamond lattice, star-shaped metal nails, 'overlaps' with drum like stools at the base, comic round- faced Guardians with cockatoo hairlocks - all are common to both. Both may be post-Pagan, but hardly one. One would expect such enormous costly doors, so skilfully elaborated, to date from the time when Paga'n was the capital. If both sets of doors were restored, say in the Konbaung dynasty, surely there would be some record of it? One must make liberal allowance for partial repairs along the centuries, copying the old more or less closely. For big repairs, the 'overlap,' more liable to damage than any other part, would be the easiest to change. The 'overlap' of Shwdgu-gyi W. door is an instance of late repair-work, far inferior to the old. In the Nanda doors I do not notice such degeneration. And as for discrepancy of style, should one not expect it at Pagan, with great artists, Mon and Burmese, both with long experience of wood-work, but widely different in origin, temperament and culture ? VAULTING A final word about the vaulting. The arching of both corridors is still mostly lean-to half-vaults, both high, those of the inner corridor higher than those of the outer. Why, then, have not the Nanda roofs collapsed by earthquake, as have so many half-vaulted 'Mon' corridors at Pagan ? - Fortunately, the builders strengthened and bonded the fabric at some critical points. On each side of the central doors, below the level of their tops, the outer corridor has a I5 ft. section of pointed vault complete, some 20 ft. lower than the half-vault. At the corridor-corners, too, there is a short section, about I2 ft. long on each side of the corner, where the half-vault descends perhaps IO ft. to bind and buttress. The inner corridor has a similar full-vaulted section on each side of the central archway, binding the corridors together; but there is no lowering of the half-vault at the corners. The inner plinth here projects massively to bear the weight of the roof, which, though high in the centre, is narrow overall, owing to the absence of a second storey. - But while admitting that I am no architect, I confess to some anxiety about this priceless monument. MYINKABA KUBYAUK-GYI OF RAJAKUMAR, C. III3 A.D. (Pls. 335 to 350) With this great temple we are approaching the end of the 'Mon' temples of the old asymmetric plan. It was built by Prince Rajakrunur, son of Kyanzittha's rnaluidevt, Trilokavatamisikti His quadri- lingual inscriptions (now inaccurately called 'the Myazedi', after the modern stupa built in the pre- cincts of the old temple) give the date of his father's accession, 1628 A.13. (446 s.11o84 A.D.), and 28</page><page sequence="394">374 Chapter XVIII years later (c. 474 S./III2 A.D.) his mortal illness. The inscription and the temple were doubtless completed shortly after his father's death, say 475 S./III3 A.D., which was probably the date of Caftsfi I's accession. The important question, why the grandson succeeded and not the son, has been considered in Chapters III and IV (supra. pp. 48-49, 74-76). The temple stands on the N. Bank of Myinkaba Chaung, north of Aniruddha's Myinkaba Zedi, about a hundred yards E. of the main road to the south. It faces East. Though shorn of all its pinnacles and most of the pediments of the Hall, it has its own exterior beauties, notably the stucco facing on the brickwork. M/iuch of this is well-preserved. The pot-like moulded plinth is topped with the sacring bed of up-and-down turned lotus. This is reduced in scale, but not in shape, along the Hall-bays and porch-projections. Above the lotus is a dado of pointed fig-leaf, broken only by windows and doorway and the pilasters at the corners. Pilasters, in their up-and-down turned V's with diamond rosettes between, are rich with motifs of piled urns and foliation. Those supporting the main double pediment at the entrance have a lovely coiling arabesque pattern. The stone perforated windows - one in each side of the Hall, three in each of the closed sides of the main block - are among the chief exterior beauties. These tall oblongs of stone slab - those of the Hall larger than those of the main block - are fretted to form patterns of four hearts, surrounding now a circle, now a diamond, now a square. In the centre windows the pattern subtly changes to jewelled squares held in tension in their frames on all four sides. There are 3 light-holes also above the lintels. All the windows are thickly set in stucco- mouldings: beading first, then chamfered lotus-leaf and tongue. Pilasters at each side support the double pediment - the makara-motif now dissolved in climbing cinquefoil scrollwork, backed against tiers that taper to a stupa finial. Above, the kUrtimukha frieze suspends its loops of pearl, enclosing floral pendents. Above the frieze there is a thick round band, sheathed with sharp rosettes and vajras. Above this, a course ot upturned leaf of lotus reaches the narrow cornice-band. This has scrolls of arabesque, and gorgon masques at the corners, like those of Shwe Chaung Kubyauk-nge or Somin-gyi pagoda, but here not glazed. Above the cornice the walls recede; there is another band of sheathing, and finally an up-and-down-turned lotus course reaches the terrace-parapet. The crowning Sikhara has three tiers of niches down its centre panels, the sikharas repeated on the four well-spaced corner-cells cresting the main block. There are four lower ones above the Hall, the inner two enclosing the heads of original staircases. There are no higher terraces, only a recessed plinth of quiet beauty, with four median skylights now stopped up except on the east. But at the back of the Hall-roof there is set a median gu with throne, painted reredos and haloed Buddha, four penden- tives above, arched niches at the sides, and pedimented hall - a miniature temple, with lovely-coloured paintings covering all the walls. Outside, four cinquefoil clec archways, double-tiered in front, bind the gu, and a gikhara crowns it, modelled on the large main gikhara behind and above it. It makes, in fact, a sort of second storey, not yet worked into the body of the first, but helping to unite the whole. Plainly it recalls the Pahtothamya; and no less plainly succeeds, where Myebontha and Hlainggu fail. The corner cells are similar but smaller, with stone images and paintings. The roof of the Hall is slightly rounded. The East is the only entrance, high and narrow, the arch pointed without, receding (as often in this temple) to curvilinear within. The inner sides of the Hall have a low moulded plinth, ending in ledge- seats, which serve as shoulders from which the vault springs. Where the side-windows project, there</page><page sequence="395">Chapter XVII 375 are deep bays containing square-arched kammaftthd cells and a staircase on the south. The bays are faced with plain-arched toranas, backed on 'Mon' horizontal roofs, climbing to a large double-terraced stupa with crenellated pockets. The E. and W. walls of the Hall are vertical. The W. archway (P1. 343) leading to the Shrine, projects a high floral flame-pediment, embossed above the arch, with scrolling cinquefoil below. After three painted orders of recession the cinquefoil repeats itself, jagging the arch- edge: and yet again above the entrance to the Shrine. On each side of the Hall archway stand slim gigantic Bodhisattvas, encased in tall toranas, also with jagged cinquefoil backed with roofs tapering to a stupa top. Beyond the long archway to the Shrine sits the colossal Buddha on a great panelled throne; but badly damaged, so that the grandeur of vista seen in Abeyadana is partly lost. Two tall and open windows throw dim side-lights upon the image. On the Corridor-side these side-windows are framed with pilasters, supporting a scroll arch with short flame-pediment, backed on tiers that taper to a sikhara-stupa just below the cornice. On the W. side (the back), instead of a window, there is an elaborate central recess similarly framed; within the scroll arch are painted three tasselled umbrellas above the cinquefoil shading the seated Buddha. There are four niches on either side of the Shrine-windows and W. recess; some contain stone reliefs (Kyanzittha style) of seated Buddhas, preaching or touching Earth (P1. 344); a few, inscribed with names of donors, have been moved to Pagan Museum. The Corridor-vault is the usual lean-to half- arch. The inner wall has a massive plinth, with broad flat bands prominent at top and bottom, two round bands between, projecting cornice, and corner-pilasters. The outer wall has deep window em- brasures, with three high steps climbing to all of them. Bodhisattva-paintings in this temple are of interest. On either inset of the E. porch is painted a colossal ten-armed standing Bodhisattva, attended by two seated Saktis (P1. 345). Two of his hands are raised in prayer, two hang in gestures of charity, two clasp stems of lotus, the rest hold discus, wheel, elephant-hook, etc. High above him, in their lotus paradise, a pair of Brahmas sit in padmdisana on lotus-cushions, their hands sustaining (as in Nanpaya) lotus-buds. Still higher, at the very top, is a narrow endless row of haloed saints standing on lotus trays. - The argument seems clear: powerful as the young Bodhisattva may be, with his Saktis ("strengths") to support him, the Brahmr.s, first and highest beings in the World of Form, take precedence; but the Buddhist Arhat (the Theravadin ideal), small as he may seem in our low human perspective, excels them all. Two other Bodhisattvas (mentioned already), stand, slim and tall, beside the entrance-arch of the Hall; two are painted in the archway leading to the corridor; two (smaller but lovelier), seven-armed figures (?), on the front face of the arch leading into the Shrine. There is nothing else of Mahaydnist kind in the temple. One of the chief glories of this temple (there are many) are the paintings on the walls, and in par- ticular the glosses below them. They show the great advance in Buddhist scholarship that had been in progress before and during Kyanzittha's reign. The Burma Historical Commission has recently published a number of its Bulletin50 devoted to these glosses. The following extracts are taken from its Introduction: - 'The great change in Burma - from the Thntric Mahdydnism of East Bengal to Singhalese Theravdda - which has so largely determined the subsequent religious thought, art and literature of Burma, must 50 Bulletin of the Burma Historical Commission, Vol. II, i96i, pp. 277-4i6.

The extraordinary range of Rajakumar's reading, considering the limitations of his time, argues a lifetime largely spent in study .......... He set himself to master the full range of Theravdda thought, cosmology and history, and to show it clearly in his temple ....... But only half of it survives. Apart from local flaking, the Corridor galleries are fairly complete, especially the inner wall. But in the large Hall, covered with painting, we could read little except in the window-embrasures, and in the Shrine proper nothing at all." Here we can only summarise and locate the main themes illustrated by Rajakumar. We begin with the ii rows on the outer wall of the Corridor. OUTER WALL OF CORRIDOR ROW II (from the top).

This is the fullest of the painted Jataka series with Old Mon glosses. About 496 panels, often fragmentary, have useful glosses. The ink, which is excellent, has usually survived better than the paint. For each story the Pali title is given but no number; and a brief description in Mon: "the Bodhisat was a-." The series follows closely the Singhalese recension. See V. Fausb6ll: The Jataka together with its commentary... (i877-97, 6 vols. and index). ROW I (topmost). - Early life of the future Buddha Gotama. Glosses I-43. The paintings show a series of scenes from the early life of Gotama, with Mon glosses (often fragmentary) written in ink below then. The main source appears to be the Nidanakatha, the introductory chapter of the Jdtaka Commentary (Aviduire and</page><page sequence="397">Chapter XVIII 377 Santike Niddna). The scenes begin with the Conception (M5.ya's Dream) on the E. wall from the N.E. corner, and end with Andthapindika's gift of the Jetavana monas- tery at Sdvatthi (N. wall, N.E. corner). This is the point where the Niddnakatha ends. Probably i6 scenes were shown on each wall, 64 altogether, but we could only count 43 glosses remaining. ROW IX (beyond the end of the Jdtaka), Row X and Row XI on the Outer Wall of the Corridor, are miscellaneous - often interesting, but fragmentary, with large gaps. ROW IX, N. wall (just W. of central window): - Glosses 84-86 Story of the hermit Bdvarf and Rucirdjattd'. For Bdvar!, see Sutta Nipdta, Pari- yana vagga. I have not located "Shining Locks."

ENTRANCE ARCHWAY TO SHRINE. S. WALL The longest and most interesting of all the ink glosses in Rajakumdr's temple are on both sides of the archway leading into the Shrine. The S. wall is the better preserved. It has six tiers (A, B, C, D, E, F) from top to bottom, with a varying number of panels with inscribed glosses (A i, A 2 etc.) in each, counting from left to right, that is from E. to W. Most of the panels are devoted to Singhalese history, as recorded in the Mahdvahsa and its continuation, the Cf4avaisa Vol. I. The story (with wide gaps of course) is brought right down to Vijayabahu I, Aniruddha's friend, who died in IIIO-I A.D., shortly before this temple was built. Tier A is arranged chronologically, from left to right. Also Tier B. These record the two first visits of the Buddha to Ceylon (Mahiyafigana and Ndgadipa). For the rest the order of panels is not chronological. Tiers B 5, E 4 and D i (GI. i94, I95, i96) are concerned with the Emperor Asoka and his friend Devdnaihpiyatissa, king of Ceylon (fi. 250-2I0 B.C.). With Tier E 6 and 7 (Gi. I97, i98) we pass to the reign of DutthagdmaniAbhaya (fi. i6I-I37 B.C.). E 2 (GI. i99) is about the reign of Ussabho, i.e. Vasabha, who reigned from 65-109 A.D. E I (GI. 200) is about king Sangha- bodhi who reigned 2 years, from 25I-253 A.D. E 3 (GI. 20I) is about the doctor-king Buddhadds (. 340-368 A.D.). Tier D 3 and 4 (GI. 202, 203) both mention Vijayabdhu I (i. I055-III0 A.D.); but little except the name is legible. - R5jakumdr has thus covered the whole history of the world as known to the Buddhists, from its creation down to the (then) present day. Because of their rarity, we translate these glosses more fully than the previous ones. Tier A i. Gi. I85. "At Ndgavana garden, all the spirits dwelling in Laikt (Ceylon) were about to fight.

These short glosses, written in tiny letters a few inches above the present floor, appear to record further scenes from the Vimdna vatthu of the Khuddaka Nikaya. Col. Ba Shin could only read one name, Anekavannaka biman (F 3, GI. 2o6), which should be No. 82 in the last, Sunikkhitta Vagga; but the gloss mentions a needle and a "cetf of the Rev. Kas (Kassapa)," which are not to be found in this story. ENTRANCE ARCHWAY TO SHRINE. N. WALL This wall has now only 3 visible tiers of panels. The large-lettered Top Tier has 4 panels, with glosses of i line apiece, partly written above previous writing - all going back to the early days of the temple. The present glosses (209-2I2) all deal with the life of Asoka in India. The Middle Tier has all flaked except for the panel on the extreme right, the E. edge of the arch. This has 3 lines (GI. 2I3) of small lettering, telling the story of the rich man of Soreyya, who twice changed his sex. The story, which comes in the Commentary on the Dhammapada, is told in Malalasekera's Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol. II, pp. I3Ii-i2. The Bottom Tier (GI. 2I4-2i8) has 5 panels with small lettering. The first panel (on the left or W.) is difficult to read and identify. The second treats of the death and obsequies of Mahdmdya's sister, Pajdpat! Gotaml. The third reverts to the theme of the rich man of Savatthi, Migar, his son Siri Vaddhi, and his 'mother' or rather daughter-in-law, Visdkhd, Migdra- mata; her physical strength, and her descendants. The fourth panel treats of Old Delhi (Inda patha) and the 'Law of the Kurus'; of the long drought in Kalihga, only broken when the king learnt to practise the Kuru Law. The fifth (on the E. side) is none too clear. It treats of a poor woman-slave who, after 3 years' work, earned a scarlet robe. When, after bathing, she was about to wear it, she met a monk whose robe had been stolen by robbers, and gave it to him. She was reborn as Uppalavaryna, one of Gotama Buddha's two 'Chief Disciples of the Left'. - The story combines part of that of Um- madanti (Jataka No. 537) with that of the great ther4, Uppalavanna.

LOKA-HTEIKPAN TEMPLE Temple "adorning the top of the world" (Pls. 35I-356). - My colleague on the Burma Historical Commission, Bohmu Ba Shin, has devoted to this temple a volume of 2I2 pages with 70 plates.' There is no need for me, therefore, to write at large about its priceless value. Once this was explained, the Burma Government has lost no time in repairing and conserving it. It was, I believe, the archaeo- logist U Lu Pe Win, who first discovered and photographed the Mon inscriptions at the top of the W. wall. So much for a happy cooperation - As an old man, I cannot refrain from drawing the moral. Once, at a meeting of our Historical Commission, one of us - probably Ba Shin - proposed to send relays of parties to copy all the ink inscriptions on the walls of Pagan. "Surely that is unnecessary!" remarked one elderly member: "Hasn't the Archaeological Department done it long ago?" - "They have cer- tainly done a tremendous lot" came the reply; "and our debt to the Department is beyond counting. I think they have published about ioo of these ink inscriptions altogether. But on his last visit, in the Myinkaba Kubyauk-nge temple alone, Ba Shin copied ioo others." (One remembers Yule's estimate of the number of pagodas at Pagan as not less than 8oo, perhaps i000). Quantity there cer- tainly is. But what about quality ? - The Archaeological Department, year by year from the first, has discovered gem on gem of Burma's ancient glories. But the Loka-hteikpan is there to show how easily some gems can be overlooked; and how necessary it is for all to cooperate, if some, even of the finest gems, are not to be missed. The temple faces N.; it is a furlong N. of Shw6hsandaw, and about 1 mile S. of the S.E. corner of Pagan city-wall. It is of medium size, 52 ft. long by 32 ft. at the broadest. It is full of paintings and writings, mostly Burmese, but also Mon. It falls, therefore, into the Transitional Period (III3 to II74 A.D.). But is the date nearer to the first terminus or the last ? - The Mon spellings are practically the same as those in Kyanzittha's inscriptions, or those of his son Rajakumar. Excluding words of Indo- 1 The Loka-hteikpan, published by the Burma Historical Commission on a grant by the Asia Foundation, Rangoon University Press, Sept. I962.</page><page sequence="405">Chapter XIX 385 Aryan origin, there are barely 40 altogether.2 So far as the Mon writing and spelling are concerned, it might date from II00 A.D. In Cafisf I's reign Mon orthography soon tends to get careless. In the 4 lines of the king's own (undated) postscript to his grandfather's Shwezigon inscription, already 2 unusual spellings occur: gyek for kyek, and gu (but also kit) for ku.3 In the later Mon temples (Alapyi', Hpyatsa Shwegu) and votive tablets, such variations will multiply. The accurate dating of this temple is of still greater importance for the history of the Burmese written language. It contains much the largest text of Archaic Burmese yet discovered. The 5 dated Burmese inscriptions of our period discussed in Chapter VI (su/'ra, pp. I07-Ii6), if we exclude dupli- cates, contain only I70 lines of stone writing altogether. The printed Burmese text of Lokahteikpan fills 20 pages. The two chief stone inscriptions - RMjakumdr's duplicate faces and Ajdwlat's two-faced pillar in Dhammayangyi - come conveniently near the beginning and the end of the Transitional Period, c. III3 and ii65-6 A.D. respectively. Another short but precious text (I. B., PI. TI III) is dated II2I A.D., barely 8 years after that of Rajakumdr. In the Comparative Chart at the end of this chapter (pp. 403-405), taking as basis the complete Burmese vocabulary of Rajakumar, we compare it with those of the two other inscriptions and of Lokahteikpan. Bohmu Ba Shin and I are agreed that Lokahteikpan Burmese, if not quite so archaic as Rdjakumdr's is a good deal closer to it than to Ajdwlat's. The Colonel is also convinced that there is no gap in time between the Mon writing in the temple and the Burmese: indeed, he regards the handwriting as identical throughout. On the E. wall of the Shrine, for instance, both sides of the top line are in Mon; half of the 2nd line is in Burmese, and half in Mon; while the bottom line is all Burmese.4 On the W. wall the differences one notices in the writing are due to varying pressure on the available space. The glosses were drafted without reference to the wall-space: so the writer had to reduce or crush his letters accordingly.5 -Taking both the Mon and the Burmese writing into consideration, we conclude that the temple can hardly be dated later than II25 A.D., and may well be earlier. Lokahteikpan is not one of the large 'Mon' temples with corridor surrounding a closed shrine. Under its high gikhara, supported by three terraces with corner-stupas, within an open Shrine roofed with four pendentives, the well-preserved Earth-touching Buddha sits on his high detached throne, facing north towards the entrance. Three perforated brick windows with high steps admit some light to the shrine from sides and back. There are no windows in the Hall: only the plain and gentle expansion, from porch to painted Hall, from hall to jewelled Shrine. Instead of corridor, there is just room to make one's circuit of respect around the image.

The throne hides the window at the back; but light suffices to reveal the first beauty of the temple - the foreground Buddha seated as on Pdla reliefs, against a painted back- ground of the Eight Scenes (atthamahatthdna) filling the S. wall behind him (PI. 352). The plane sur- face of this wall is about i8 ft. square. The painter has skilfully designed his panels so as to enclose within his frame, not only the window in the centre, but also the Buddha seated in front of it. The frame is similar to the Eight Scene votive tablets and 'andagu' stone carvings of Paga'n, but on a far larger scale, with lots of detail and some subsidiary scenes. The whole recalls, in fact, the scale, as well as the design, of the great P5la slab at Baragaon, Ndlanda.6 The scenes were so well known at Pagan that it was not necessary to add glosses below them. Maung Bo Hlaing's four plans of the scenes shown on the four walls of the Shrine,7 with the Colonel's full and accurate descriptions, make it unnecessary for me to do more than draw attention to some points of interest. The photographs, alas, do scant justice to these paintings. The two aggasavaka are shown large, seated at the Buddha's feet - Sdriputta on the left (the Buddha's right), Moggalldna on the right (the Buddha's left). Perched on top of the architectural frame at the shoulders, are two Kinnara (Lok., PI. ii a), below the Rays and Tree. The Attack and Retreat of Mdra's army no longer invade the tall narrow panels at the sides of the archway. These are here devoted to the Worship by Devas (io tiers, with 2 in each) on the left, and by Brahmds (similarly grouped - Lok. PI. I2 a) on the right. Above his Devas Indra sits blowing his conch, with Mahdbrahmd seated on the other side, holding a three-tiered umbrella. In the spandrels above these, a long divided panel shows Mdra's attack on the left, his Retreat on the right. The Pcarinirvana crowns, as usual, the apex of the arch; the sides of the squared frame filled in with Dona's Intervention on the left, the Distribution of the Relics on the right, and 2 stupas in each corner. Below are the 6 side-panels: Taming of Ndlagiri elephant, First Sermon, and Pdrileyyaka retreat on the left; Descent from Thvatirhsa, Twin Miracles, and Nativity on the right. A drawing by U Aye Myint, design-master at Amarapura Weaving Institute, shows the delightful detail of the Nativity scene (PI. 353 c). The N. Wall, opposite, divided by the broad archway (I4 ft. high, I2 ft. broad) between Hall and Shrine, is devoted to the 28 Buddhas, Tanhafikara to Gotama, with their respective Bodhi trees, identified in Mon. The two top rows of panels (8 Buddhas in each) cross the whole wall above the archway from W. to E. The third row shows 3 Buddhas (Atthadassi, Dhammadassi and Siddhattha) on the W. side of the arch, and 3 more on the E. The last 6 Buddhas are shown singly in tiers - Sikhi, Vessabhf and Kakusandha on the E. side; Kondgamana, Kassapa and Gotama on the W. The N. wall has been damaged by leaks down the staircase and partial subsidence: so that half the writing is lost. The list of Bodhi trees is useful for comparison with the only other lists in Old Mon so far dis- covered - in the Alopyi' and Kyazin temples. These are translated below (pp. 392-397) in extenso, together with an Old Burmese list, and collated with the Pali text of Buddhavamsa, and the text of Nidanakathi as printed at the head of Fausbtll's edition of the Jftaka. The E. wall of the Shrine (i8 ft. square), divided below by the 3 ft. broad window, has several large but faint panels of painting, with 3 lines of barely legible glosses: Mon at the top, Burmese at the 6 See ibid., PI. 21, for an illustration of this. 7 ibid., facing p. io (S. wall), p. 13 (E. wall), p. i6 (N. Wall), p. I7 (W. wall). Chapter II of the book (pp. 9-i9) gives a full description of these walls and those of the Hall.</page><page sequence="407">Chapter XIX 387 bottom, both in the middle. The top right corner shows the Dussa Cetiya in Brahmaloka, where Ghatikdra enshrined the royal robes which Gotama discarded on the bank of the river Anomd. The top left corner shows the Ciilma'tni Cetiya in Tdvatirhsa, where Sakka enshrined the royal coif of braided hair which Gotama severed at the same spot. The main subject, above the central window, shows Vejayanta flying palace of Indra, king of the Sakra Devas, with the Buddha seated in the centre on the stone throne, Pandukarnbala, under the Red Coral tree, Pdricchattaka, preaching the Abhi- dharnma to his mother and innumerable Devas. Indra's palace is at the top of Mt. Sineru, with its 7 ranges of mountains resting on the sea. These are shown as 7 ascending pillars on either side of the throne, with fishes swimming at the base, and suns rising over Mt. Yugandhara at the top. King Pasenadi kneeling at the base shows the Buddha's line of Ascent on the right, the triple ladder his means of Descent on the left. The bottom tier has two large panels, each 74 ft. long by 31 ft. high). On the right (or S.) side Dipaftkara Buddha is making his prophecy about Sumedha prostrate before him. On the left (or N.) side, at Bimbisdra's request, accompanied by boats of gold, silver and ruby. the Buddha is on his triumphal way to Vesdli to stop the pestilence. He does this by teaching Ananda to recite the Ratana Suita.8 (Once again one notices the great value set at Paga'n on these paritta Suttas). Note also the affinity between Lokahteikpan and the small Mon Gu No. 4IS S.E. of Lokananda (supra, Ch. XVII, p. 35I): not only in general shape, but also in detail. The subjects painted on the S. wall of the Hall in the latter, may well be those shown here in Lokahteikpan: Vejayanta palace, between Cdllmani and Dussa Cetiyas. Perhaps also the preaching of A bhidhamma in the centre; but there the painting has flaked. The W. Wall of the Shrine, mostly in good condition considering its age (81 centuries), has I4 rows of painting illustrating the Jdtaka, with full descriptive glosses, usually legible. The two top rows (I, II) have each i0 separate panels, with short glosses in Mon. The remaining i2 rows have lengthy epigraphs in Archaic Burmese. In Pali, the Jctaka is divided into 22 books (nipdta), the last, Maha- nipata, containing the io great final Jdtakas. The Lokahteikpan is mainly concerned with the Mahdni pdta. The 2I previous books are dismissed briefly with one panel apiece, illustrating usually (not al- ways) the first Jdtaka in the nipata. Thus the top two rows, with their 20 panels and glosses in Mon, dispose of the first 20 nipdta. The first panel in Row III, Sutasoma Jdtaka, with the first gloss in Bur- mese, completes the series up to the beginning of the Mahanipata. This is introduced with a panel showing the Buddha preaching in response to his disciples' request for a 'repetition' (anuvdc) of these. And detailed scenes from each of these io Jdtakas fill the remaining walls of the temple: not only the I2 lower rows on the W. Wall of the Shrine, but also the W. and E. side-walls of the Hall. The latter are reserved, respectively, for the Mahosadha and Vessantara Jdtakas, doubtless because they are much longer than the others. The distribution is as follows: - Temi (Mflgapakkha) Jdtaka - Shrine, W. Wall. Rows III, IV. Mahdjanaka Jdtaka -Shrine, W. Wall. Rows V, VI. Sdma (Suvannasdma) Jdtaka - Shrine, W. Wall. Row VII.

Rows IX, X, XI (N. side of window). 8 Khuddaka Nikdya, Khuddaka Patha 6; Sutta Nipata 13. 25*</page><page sequence="408">388 Chapter XIX Narada (Mahdndradakassapa) Jdtaka - Shrine, W. Wall. Rows XII, XIII, XIV (S. side of window). Vidhura (Vidhurapandita) Jdtaka - Shrine, W. Wall. Rows XII, XIII, XIV (N. side of window). Mahosadha (Mahd-ummagga) Jdtaka - Hall, W. Wall. 6 rows (probably 8 originally). Vessantara Jataka - Hall, E. Wall. 7 rows (probably 8 originally). The panels in the Hall are not so high as those on the W. wall of the Shrine. The 7 rows on the E. wall are only 5 ft. 4 in. in total height; their length II ft 3 in. The height of the W. wall of the Shrine is nearly I7 ft.; its breadth, including the window, I7 ft. io in. The window is 2 ft. Iol in. broad, and 5 ft. 9 in. from the apex down to the bottom row of painting. The top 8 lines of writing run the whole breadth of the wall. The 6 lower lines measure about 7 ft. 2 in. on each side of the window. A good deal of Row III is lost; and there are a number of gaps, due to damp or flaking, on the walls of the Hall. Apart from this, the chief difficulty in reading several of the lines is due to the fact mentioned above, namely that the length of the gloss was not properly related to the length of the panel. When space permitted, the writer wrote clearly and well; but often he had to crush his words into a space too narrow to admit them. In the Hall, note that whereas the glosses on the W. Wall (Mahosadha Jataka) read naturally from S. to N. (from left to right), those on the E. Wall (Vessantara Jataka) should be read retreating from S. to N. (from right to left), if the chronological sequence is to be kept. There are lots of lovely details, floral patterns and rich old colouring in these paintings. For these, see Bohmu Ba Shin's plates. The Sacred Footprints on the Hall ceiling are shewn on our P1. 353 a. The painter lacks the mastery and delicacy of the Abeyadana artist; but he has a style and skill of his own, and is rarely conventional or arid. AL6-PYI' (ALUIW-PLAfi) temple, Gu 228 (Pls. 357,358) This temple stands, facing E., 3 mile S.E. of Htilominlo, on the N. side of the inland road to Nyaung-u. Original ink-writings on the painted walls (there is plenty, often legible, both in Corridor and Hall) are all in Mon. But on the S. side of the arch between the two, there is a i6-line ink-inscription,9 dated 556 s./II94 A.D., in still-archaic Burmese, recording gifts of musical instruments to the kuiw', i.e.gii, 'Temple', "called Al hiwplafl, 'Wish fulfilled."' The first witness was "the chief monk of Can puthuiw", i.e. Sin' pahto, 'Glazed Pagoda,' the adjoining stupa on the west. The temple was probably built at least half a century earlier. Its style follows the old 'Mon' asym- metric pattern, with porch, hall, corridor, perforated brick windows, wooden lintels, lean-to vaults, and richly painted niches. The chief change (in line with Old Burmese taste) was to brighten and lighten the interior by eliminating the Shrine: by making the inner sides of the Corridor one solid block, with four tall niches in the centres (as in the Nanda), where Buddhas stand within painted toranas under trefoil floral pediments. This central block has still modest corner - pilasters, capitals, cornice, and moulded plinth below, with recesses painted at intervals with flower-patterns. There is still a lean-to 9 I.B. PI. IV 367 a, lines 4-7. A.S.B. igi6, p. 2i, and App. G, p. 55, Nos. 7-I3.</page><page sequence="409">Chapter XIX 389 vault over the Corridor. The outer wall has a staircase-opening and two niches on the east; each of the other sides has three high window-embrasures with stepped arches, and two niches between them. Vaults and niches are all painted with free patterns of 'sun-god' lotuses. Walls have become smoother and plainer, and paint clearly replaces carving in the interiors. The exterior, even in ruin, still shows good proportion and simplicity. There is a bell-shaped crown and three roof-terraces, with octagonal 'bell'-topped stupas at the main corners (lowest terrace), and two others at the far corners of the broad Hall. Windows, except those of the Hall, have floral pediments. The makara is gone. There is no klrtimukha frieze. The dormer exit at the top of the stair- case casts a deep shadow in the centre above the Hall. The outer walls of the Hall-interior are vertical up to the shoulders; the W. wall, as usual, is not integrated with the temple proper. The main arch between Hall and Corridor is pointed within and without, but had (till recently) wooden lintels in the centre. It has no elaborate pediment. But tall painted Bodhisattvas (replacing the old brick and stucco ones) still stand to left and right; and even larger ones (nearly 9 ft. high) are painted on the inner faces of the arch Bricks are exceptionally large: one we measured was i6l in. long X 7j in. broad X 3 in. thick. Both outer and inner walls of the Corridor are filled with painted panels showing, with scant variety, the Buddha preaching his various Suttas. The scenes are simply painted in gold, indigo and white; the gold generally reserved for the frames and the exposed parts of the body. The seated Buddha fills the main panel. Below is a 'predella' with four monks seated facing each other in prayer. Below this, is the Mon gloss, e.g. "At this time the Lord Buddha preached the Sela Sut to the monks." The whole panel measures about 20 in. high by i0 in. broad. On each side of the central block there are 8 tiers of such panels, above and on either side of the tall Buddha-niche: some 48 on each face, total I92. Of the 7 tiers on the outer wall of the corridor, the glosses on the lowest tier are all lost, and many on the tier above it; and nearly half of the topmost tier is occupied by a series showing the 28 Buddhas with their Bodhi-trees. Out of a total of nearly 650 Sutta panels, which I reckon for the temple as a whole, we could read about 440 - the biggest total, I think, for any temple at Pagan. If only the names had been entered in proper order, the list would have been valuable. The order was confused by interference of the 9 arched windows and 8 niches breaking the wall-surface. The top two tiers generally follow a horizontal sequence. The lower tiers may or may not prefer the vertical: down, or across the 'pockets' between windows and niches. And even so, the order was haphazard. One imagines that a number of writers were given separate lists of Suttas to write on the walls; and that they were not particular where they wrote them, since there was nothing in the paintings to distinguish one scene from another. It is often difficult to identify the names. The spelling is apt to be queer, as if the writer had little knowledge of Pali. But the strange names in some cases may go back to an original variant in the title. Taking only my more probable identifications, I arrive provisionally at the following analysis: - DTgha Nikaya - io names (out of a maximum of 34). Majjhimna Nikdya - about 8o names (out of I52). Sa~myntta Nikvya - Sag.tha Vagga over 50 names, Nidana Vagga about 20, Khandha and Sal- yatana hardly any, Maha Vagga over 30. Ai~guttara Nikcaya, Tika Nipata - over 70 names. Hardly any from the other Nipatas. Total identified: about 275 out of 440 partly legible.</page><page sequence="410">390 Chapter XIX In the top tier on the outer wall of the Corridor, the Buddhavafsa series starts from the centre of the E. face, continues along the S. face, and ends a quarter-way down the W. face. The writings are fuller and better preserved than those of Lokahteikpan and Kyazin temples: e.g. "Anomadassi blossomed (Pkth) at the kloN tree (Terminalia Arjuna). When Anomadassi made his prophecy, the Bodhisat [i.e. the future Gotama] was a Yakkha general." These lists, together with an Old Burmese list, are given in detail infra (pp. 392-397). On three walls of the Hall one can still read about a dozen glosses below pictures of the Vimdna vatthu (Khuddaka Nikaya). Here, too, the descriptions are fuller than those in Myinkaba Kubyaukgyi:- S.wall. W. side. (I) "This man .... gave gifts of the Four Requisites to the lord Buddha. Therefore he got .a wish-fulfilling tree (kapparak), a lake, and retinue of a thousand women. Sona- dinna vimdn." - Cittalatd Vagga, 23. Sonadinnd Vimdna.

Phaladayaka Vimana.</page><page sequence="411">Chapter XIX 39I There are several other more fragmentary glosses from the Vimana vattku. Perhaps these filled two (or more ?) of the lower tiers on the N., E. and S. walls of the Hall. There was also a top tier briefly illustrating the Mahiniptta Jdtaka. Only 3 or 4 glosses are legible: the last one on the S. wall, W. of the window: - "This is when king Vessantar gives as a gift Jals and Kanhq-jin to the Brahman Jfic." Two or three of the Old Mon spellings in this temple - jreai for jrey 'fig-tree', treaty for trey "the reverend" - suggest a date later than Kyanzittha's reign, perhaps a little later than Lokahteikpan. KYAZIN TEMPLE (NO. 555) AND THE 28 BUDDHAS Kyazin temple, a very high two-storeyed temple of Early Burmese type, stands S. of Myinkaba village, W mile N.E. of Nagayon. It faces E.; and its early history is told in two short ink inscriptions, Old Burmese10 and Pali, on either side of the great torana at the back of the Hall, the entrance-arch to the temple proper. The Pali (too faint for my eyes) has been read by the Archaeological Department. The gist of the Burmese is as follows: - "In 487 S. [II25 A.D.] on the New Moon of Kason [April-May], the donor of this pagoda [or Buddha ?], called BdrucT, died. In 579 S. [I2I7 A.D.] ... San Tra URi enshrined (the Buddha in) this BdrucT temple (kit). In 585 S. [I223 A.D.] ... San Tra URi gave the following name to this pagoda: Trai-lok-luboh-buil, 'Strong Comfort of the Three Worlds."' The Pali is said to repeat the name Trai-lok-luboh-buil, but gives only the final date, I767 A.B. [I223 A.D.], and the title of the repairer as Sumaigala Thera. BdrucT and San Tra URi are not Burmese names. San is Pali/Mon for Satgha. Tra may be Pyu tra? 'slave', tra? ba ? 'minister.'11 Trai-lok-l3tboh-buil is a mixture of Sanskrit and Old Mon. Luboh (or lbmfth), 'cold, coolness,' is doubtless the basis of Old Burmese khyatstsa, 'pleasant cold, happiness.' Such names point to the early days of the dynasty. The temple, though now mainly Burmese, is also of mixed origin, the older portion towards the east. Perhaps from the first it contained 3 colossal images, seated facing E. on a massive lion-guarded throne: Earth-touching Buddha in the centre, between two Buddhas seated (Europeanwise) in pralambandsana. In spite of the bhfimisparsa mudrd, the scene implied must be the Great Miracle of Sdvatthi, with the Buddha seated between two nirmdna Buddhas of his own creation. The walls facing them, on N., E. and S., have Old Mon writings (first noticed by Mon Bo Kay) listing the 28 Buddhas.12 They have no paintings above them, apart from the kfrtimukha frieze, and, above it, a row of kneeling Devas between coconut palms. The writing is faint, but often legible; and interesting for comparison with the two other Old Mon lists (all fragmentary) in Alopyi' (A.) and Lokahteikpan (L.). All three are translated below seriatim, together with one of the earliest Old Burmese lists, in the Hall of Wetkyi-in Kubyauk-gyi (W.K.) - a temple dating perhaps from Caiisfi II's reign (II74-I2II A.D.). Except those of the first three Buddhas, the Pali tree-names agree with those of the Buddhavamsa. The trees of the first three Buddhas, which are nearly always mentioned in Pagan lists,13 are not 10 I.f, P1. IV 367 b. 11 Both terms occur frequently in Rajakumar's inscriptions (Pyu face). On the two-faced Old Mon inscription (I.B., PI. III 3001), now Stone 68 at Pagan Museum, the chief donor of slaves to a pagoda is tra jnok mitra(?), 'the great minister Mitra.' 12 The list starts on the S. wall (from the S.W.), continues on the E. wall (S. &amp; N. of the entrance arch), and ends on the N. wall. 13 Not mentioned, however, in the Wetkyi-in Kubyauk-gyi list, given infra.</page><page sequence="412">392 Chapter XIX given in the Buddhavahsa: but they are mentioned, so Mon Bo Kay tells me, in the Pali SotatthakT, a work attributed to Cillabuddhaghosa,14 said to be Buddhaghosa's contemporary.

HPYATSA-SHW]tGU temple (Pis. 359-361) This temple stands facing E., on the W. of Myinpagan village, not far from the river. Ten yards to the N. of it, there is the fine stupa described in Ch. XIII (supra, pp. 279-28o). Both doubtless belong to the same group; and both may date from Cafisfi I's reign. The temple is of normal 'Mon' type, with Sikhara, square central block with 3 perforated windows on each of the 3 closed sides, square hall with side windows, and porch. As in Alopyi', the Corridor surrounds no dark shrine, but a central mass with 4 images. Outside, below the corner-stupas and projecting cornice, the walls are bare, without frieze: just plain corner-pilasters, tall windows, and strong 'kalasa pot' plinth-mouldings. The window-pediments are all embossed with tapering hori- zontal tiers, with stupas as finials at the sides, Sikharas in the centre. The Hall windows have also 'flame' facings. What little stucco still clings to the exterior is on the damaged porch, which once perhaps had a double pediment with makaras at the sides, praying kinnaras within the arch-lobes, and, below them., kTrtimukha frieze and 'V' pilasters. The sides of the Hall still arch from the floor. Its window-embrasures hold kammatthdn cells, except on the W. side of the S. window, which has a staircase leading to the roof. The E. and WV. walls of the Hall are vertical. The whole W. wall is occupied by a very elaborate and massive torana, flanked by brick and stucco Bodhisattvas standing in tnibhaitga pose. This toran'a is the most striking feature of the temple. The arch is pointed, with 3 orders of recession; all faces are carved in stucco, rather like the entrance to Kyaukku OSnhmin, though that is in stone. The bottom tier, on both sides of the arch,</page><page sequence="418">398 Chapter XIX is carved with Halsas within, then Yaksas on three elephants, then Garudas without. Above these, the outer and inner orders are carved with acanthus, the middle order with floral arabesque, and ksrtimukha at the peak. Beyond and behind all this, the 'Mon' pediment has floral horns instead of makaras, with praying kinnaras near the necks, and outgrowing lotus-thrones for saints in shrines, above each end of the 5 receding tiers. Above the peak is a large lotus throne, elaborately recessed, perhaps for a seated Buddha. Both side-walls of the Hall are painted with Jdtakas, with Mon glosses. We read over 20; and many more, no doubt, may be deciphered. Here are specimens: - On the S. wall: - "The reverend One was a hermit. Samiddhi Jdt. i67." On the N. wall: - "Our lord was a parrot. Rddha Jdt. i98". Perhaps there were two complete sets of Jdtakas. For one can count about 43I panels on the S. wall, 424 on the N., and 224 on the E. wall - total I079. The 'corridor' is still vaulted with the lean-to arch. Its outer wall has 3 tiers of niches, with damaged brick and stucco images, often Buddhas crudely carved, some touching Earth with the left hand. They date, perhaps, from later periods. Many years ago I found lying here a fine life-size 'Bodhisattva- King' carved in wood, and photographed it then and there, leaning it against the temple porch (see P1. 360 a). If this (as I still half-suspect) is the idealized portrait of the king who built the temple, it should be Ca&amp;sii I (Alaungsithu). But my colleague, Col. Ba Shin, thinks that such wooden images (which he has found in other places besides Pagan) have no connection with Pagan royalty. GU i8o, E. OF NAGAY6N (P1. 362) ioo yards E. of Nagayon enclosure-wall. The top is ruinous, also the porch, but the rest is still repairable. Considering the size of the temple (75i ft. long by 40 ft. broad), one finds it curious that there is only I central window on each of the 3 main sides. These, no doubt, were needed to throw light on the recesses in the central pier. The N. recess has a Nativity scene, the W. a Parinirvana. Note (i) the broad inner archway of the Hall iol ft. wide), with its fine Srf and Makara pediment, and standing Bodhisattvas at the sides; (ii) the six-armed straddling Bodhisattva (Thntric in type) on either side of the inner archway; (iii) the 'Mon' floral stucco-carving, edging the recesses; (iv) the clear 7-line ink-inscription on the N. wall of the inner archway, attributing the (re-)painting to "the mahd- sanghardjd, teacher of Prince Anantasiira" (Early Ava period ?). The same archbishop has left his signatures in several other temples, e.g. on paintings in the Halls of Dhammayan-gyi. The fifty-Buddha votive tablet signed by SrT Tribhuvandditya (see P1. i6 a, b), marked I i87 I926, from a "big temple east of Nagayon," was very likely found here. If so, Kyanzittha may have been the builder. GU N.W. OF SCOVELL S PAWDAWMU (Pls. 363, 364) This large unnumbered temple (89 ft. long by 521 ft. broad), now in grave ruin, was once one of the glories of Pagan. It faces W., and has but a single entrance. There are all the usual components - porch, square Hall, square corridor with perforated windows, and inner Shrine. The fine gikhara, faced with stucco flower-fountains, ends above the dmalaka base of the stupa-finial. Four delicate square corner-stupas nestle at the base of it; and are repeated in the splendid ones at the corners of the main wall, and again in front of the Hall. All had square bases, 3 small bulging terraces, 'bell' tops and indented lsarmikd. Between top and bottom terraces, most of the corridor vaults have fallen in, in- cluding nearly all the E. (back) side. This inner wall has a broad seven-lobed recess for a Parnirv~an</page><page sequence="419">Chapter XIX 399 (with the Buddha's head to the S.). The N. and S. side-walls have beautiful perforated brick windows, simply made with Greek-cross fillings; also the sides of the Hall, where the windows are broadest; but the horizontal pediments are mostly lost, and almost all the plaster. Only the faint corner-pilasters, and good 'kalasa-pot' plinths, remain. The side-walls of the Hall still arch from the ground, with front and back walls vertical. Against the inner wall stand giant haunched Bodhisattvas with great painted nimbi. The archway within had wooden lintels. The pediment has fallen; but that of the Shrine entrance shows the 'flame' verticals backed on Mon horizontals, tapering to the amalaka and lotus stupa-finial. Kinnaras perch at the shoulders of the savaged image on his neat throne, between large painted aggasdvakas. There are two tiers of many niches lining both W., N. and S. corridors. On their stone or stucco thrones of double lotus, sit many stucco Earth-touching Buddhas, still wearing robes, it seems, of painted cloth. A few in the upper tiers are still amazingly well-preserved (P1. 364 c). The inner plinth is noteworthy, with sun-god' tondoes painted on the broad band at the top. A brick we measured was i5 I" long by 74" broad and 3k" thick. HSULEGON GU 202 (P1. 365 a, b) This medium-large temple (75 ft. long by 4I ft. broad) stands facing N. towards the Shwezigon, visible I42 miles to N. NE. It is one of a small group'8 in this sparse area E. of the Shwe Chaung, called SaraPttiy'9 in Old Burmese inscriptions. It has only one entrance, on the N.; and like Gu i8o E. of Nagayon, it is poorly lighted considering its size: only one perforated window each, on the E. and W. sides of Hall and Shrine. All four have square holes and flame-pediments. Large lozenge-shaped holes are also practised above the taller windows of the Shrine to improve the lighting. There is no window at the back. Apart from strong plint h and cornice mouldings, and corner-pilasters joining them, the outer walls are bare, without frieze or dado. The small bell-top rests lightly on two crenellated upper terraces, well-spaced, with similar small bell-topped corner-stupas. A wooden lintel crosses the main entrance-arch. The whole temple is in fair preservation. Of the 8 empty niches in the Hall, the two broad ones, on either side of the entrance, were clearly meant to house reliefs of Maya's Dream and the Parinirva-na; so the whole probably was intended for the Eight Scenes, with the Conception Scene (as in Shwe Chaung Kubyauk-nge) doing duty for the Nativity. There are discoveries to be made in this temple, which we visited only recently, under Mon Bo Kay's guidance. In the Shrine, around the colossal Earth-touching Buddha seated against the S. wall, there are many tiers of painted panels, some with Mon glosses. But without high steps or ade- quate lighting or leisure to investigate, we can only report our first impression that the subjects do not look like Jatakas or Suttas. There are also painted panels in the broad archway leading to the Shrine, as well as 'sun-gods' in the soffit, and floral bands of Mon arabesque. WUTKYIN PAYA, S.W. of Taungbi village (P1. 365 c, d) This is a small temple (42 ft. X 25 ft.) on the N. side of the road S.W. of Taungbi village, just beyond Paga'n city-moat. It faces E., in shape rather like Lokahteikpan - half-hall, half-shrine. But here there are no windows at all. The temple has a large sikhara, with 3 tiers of niches in the'triangles' 18 Note that in our photograph of the temple, the broad chattrdvali, visible on the right, has no connection with this temple, but belongs to the Burmese pagoda immediately behind it. 19 supya, Ch. XVII, n. i8.</page><page sequence="420">400 Chapter XIX of each face. Below the ?ikhara, the roof descends in small terraces without corner-stupas to the crenellated parapet and cornice-projections above the plain walls. High above the pedimented entrance-arch, a large-lobed climbing pediment which rims the whole wall of entrance, show marks of an old wooden 'front-extension' (O. Burm. Xi tOwak), of the type one often finds on the front of brick monasteries (kuldklofi), but nowhere else on that of a temple. Perhaps it is a later addition. Plinth- mouldings, if any, appear to be sunk under the present ground-level. Within, there are a few niches, and a narrow passage round the back of the well-preserved image, a large Earth-touching Buddha of fine Mon-Indian type, with its massive reredos reaching to the ceiling. The side-walls of the Shrine are painted in 'Mon' style with tiers of seated Buddhas of varying size; there is a fig-leaf 'frieze' above, and lotus 'sun-gods' in the soffit. It is hard to fix the date of this temple. Col. Ba Shin regards it as one of the earliest 'Mon' temples. He may be right. GU S.E. OF MYAZIG6N (P1. 366 a, b, c) A largeish ruined temple (781 ft. X 443 ft.), facing W., on the E. side of the path from Upali Thein to Myazigon. It has a banded 'bell' top, with finely recessed harrnika above; also 'bell'-topped square corner-stupas on the main crenellated terrace; and others in front of the Hall. The porch was not inte- grated with the Hall, and now leans forward. Front and back archways of the square Hall are broad and round; the front and back walls vertical; the side-walls arching independently from the floor. There are high steps up to the vaulted windows, but no staircase. The Hall-roof is still in fair condition, but all the walls are bare. No frieze. The Corridor-roof has fallen in on all sides except near the entrance. Here there is a large and deep recess for the seated Buddha, with cinquefoil flame-pediment embossed over the front, the 'flames' inclining towards the centre, as in Nat-hlaung-gyaung. Similar recesses crowned with flame-pediments are found also on the other sides of the central mass. Of the outer walls of the corridor, the N. is the best preserved, but tilting. There are flame-pediments on the square central windows, with flat tops on the side-windows and those of the Hall, where there are also cre- nelles. The S. wall is similar, but more damaged. An old wooden sill at the base of a window is still visible on the S. side, near the S.E. corner. The E. (back) wall has entirely collapsed. GU N.W. OF MYINPYAGU (P1. 366 e) A nameless ruin facing W., some 50 yards N.W. of Myinpyagu. Once, no doubt, it was a temple of medium size; but the Hall has fallen, and the whole outer wall of the Corridor: so that little but the Shrine remains. This has a Buddha seated, with reredos, against the back wall, with ledges projecting on the N. and S. sides, where there are windows with round perforations. The four-pendentive roof is still in fair condition; but all paintings and plaster work are lost. The inner side of the Corridor, N. and S. (all that is left except the Shrine), has 4 tall corbelled niches for images, 2 on each side of the pedi- mented windows. On the E. (or back) side, there is a large vaulted recess, probably with stupa-top holding a seated Buddha, a corbelled niche on either side. GU S.E. OF MIN-O-CHANTHA (P1. 366 f) A small nameless ruin ioo yards S.E. of Min-o-chantha, i mile N.E. of Nanda, on the S. side of the old central road. It is 30 ft. broad, and 40j ft. long, not counting the ruined porch. It faces W.}</page><page sequence="421">Chapter XIX 40I and had probably a terraced sikhara top. The Hall has fallen in. The central pier, 8 ft. 8 in. square, had on each side a pedimented torana enclosing a deep painted recess. No images remain. There is still some full vaulting on the front and N. sides. In the outer walls of the corridor there are large central perforated windows, deep and vaulted, between smaller windows above an image-niche on each side; an image-niche also on either side of the broad entrance-arch on the W. There is quite a large enclosure-wall, with another small four-faced gii and ruins to the S.W. GU N.E OF NGA KYWi-NADAUNG (P1. 366 d) A small gfi without name or number, N. of Nat-hlaung-gyaung. It is just a Shrine with porch facing E., and a large Earth-touching Buddha against the W. wall. On either side there is a high vaulted square window of perforated brick, originally with wooden lintel. There was a broad entrance-arch. The four-pendentive roof has mostly fallen. Outside, above the S. window, there is a curious line of crenelles, instead of the horizontal Mon pediment. At the top was probably a 'bell' stupa. Large bricks were noticed: i6h" X 7j" X 3". GU S.W OF SEIN-NYET (P1. 367 a, b) A ruin 2 miles S. of Pagan, about I mile S.W. of the Seinnyet group, on the W. side of the road. This was once a fair-sized temple, 6oJ ft. long by 36 ft. broad. It faces E., with Hall, Corridor and Shrine now mostly fallen in. On the N., and doubtless the S., faces there were two windows, with flame pediments but no makaras. No frieze. The Hall had a porch, and one pedimented window on each side. There was a corridor 7 ft. broad, and a central pier IO to I2 ft. square, with a large image- recess only on the E. Perhaps also a staircase in the S.W. corner of the Hall. GU N.W. OF SEIN-NYET (P1. 367 c, d) A ruin facing E., about a furlong N.W. of the Sein-nyet group, on the W. side of the road. This gii was smaller: 54 ft. long by 28 ft. broad, without corridor or central pier; only porch, Hall and Shrine, with large image against the W. wall. 4 pedimented windows, i on either side both of Shrine and Hall. Roofs have mostly fallen in. No frieze. ANALYSIS None of these 'Mon' temples has yet been found at Minnanthu or Pwazaw, where the temples seem to be all Burmese. The furthest point the former reach inland is Hsul6gOn and a little S. of it, barely 2 miles from the river. On the river side (if we exclude Kyaukku Onhmin) they extend nearly 6 miles, from the S.E. of Myazigon to a point S.E. of Lokananda. And there may well be other 'Mon' ruins which we have overlooked. When one comes to analyse these 'Mon' asymmetric temples, over 20 in number, three obvious points of comparison occur to one: - (i) Which type of top is preferred? - the round 'Bell', or the mitre-shaped Sikhara ? (ii) Which temples have the dark central Shrine, and which the solid central pier (with recesses for images) ? (iii) How many perforated windows are found on the three closed sides of the temple proper ? To some extent, but not entirely, the answer depends on the size of temple.</page><page sequence="422">402 Chapter XIX (i) 'Bell' or ?ikhara.

Gu N.E. of Nga Kywe-Nadaung. Gu W. of Taungbi tank. Pahtothamya. Abeyadana. Gu S.E. of Myazigon. Hsulegon Gu 202 (7). It is difficult to give priority to either type. Both are well-authenticated almost from the first. But the preference given to the Vaisnava Sikhara marks the antiquity of Hinduism in Burma. (ii) Dark Shrine: - Pitakat-taik. Nanpaya (?). Gu Bizat. Pahtothamya. Nagayon. Abeyadana. Shwe Chaung Kubyauk-nge. Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi. Hlaingshe. Gu W. of Scovell's Pawdawmu. Gu N.W. of Myinpyagu (ii). Central Pier: - Pasada Zedi. Gu W. of Taungbi tank. Hpyatsa Shwegu. Alopyi'. Myebontha. Hlainggu. Gu S.E. of Myazigon. Gu S.E. of Min-o-chantha. Gu S.W. of Seinnyet. Gu E. of Nagayon (io). The count cuts out the smaller temples which have no corridor. Though numbers are divided fairly equally, the earlier norm was surely the Central Shrine, found even in such a small building as Ani- ruddha's Pitakat-taik (54I ft. square), and implied (I think) in the nucleus of the four great pillars of Makuta's Nanpaya. (iii) Corridor Windows: - 5 a side - Pasada Zedi. Pahtothamya. Nagayon (3). All exceptionally large temples. 3 a side - Pitakat taik. Gu Bizat. Nanpaya. Abeyadana. Shwe Chaung Kubyauk-nge. Myinkaba Kubyauk-gyi. Gu 20I S. of Hsulegon. Hlaingshe. Myebontha. Hlainggu. Hpyatsa Shwegu. Alopyi'. Gu W. of Scovell's Pawdawmu. Gu S.E. of Myazigon. Gu S.E. of Min-o-chantha (I5). - This was clearly the norm for large and medium-large temples. It gave some light not only to the corridors, but also to a central image-recess. 2 a side - Gu W. of Taungbi tank. Gu S.W. of Seinnyet. - Both medium-sized temples where the 2 end-windows sufficed to light the corridor. The former also had high lozenge-shaped light-holes on all three faces. i a side - Lokahteikpan. Gu E. of Nagayon. - Both medium-sized temples. In the former the corridor is not important. In the latter the object was to light the central image-recess rather than the corridor. I window on 2 sides only - Gu S.E of Lokananda. Hsulegon Gu 202. Gu N.E. of Nga Kywe Nadaung. Gu N.W. of Seinnyet. - All fairly small gu, without corridor, the image filling the back wall. Two have additional windows in the Hall. No window - Wutkyin Paya. This temple has a sort of corridor. It is not short nor small, and is probably old, perhaps one of the oldest. From all this evidence I infer that sufficient light was required to discourage snakes (but not bats, famous in the history of Abhidhamrnta!); but that the Mon need for 'dim religious light' was a very real one, which had to compete (e.g. in Rajakumar's temple) with the urgent need for clarity and religious instruction. There was here a big temperamental difference between Mon and Burman.</page><page sequence="423">Chapter XIX 403 COMPA RA TI VE CHA RT OF OLDEST WRI TTEN BURMESE Rajakumdr I.B., PI. II III.

The previous chapter, and this the final one, repeat the titles given (in our History Section) to Chapter VI "Transitional Period," and Chapter VII "The Change." But the periods are not identical. Moments in History follow an order more strictly chronological than they do in Art. The "Change" in Paga'n history was the direct and sudden result of Pardkramabdhu's invasion of ii65 A.D., leading to the restoration of Aniruddha's line with Canisii II in II74. The "Change" in Pagan architecture, from the 'Mon' temple to the Burmese, was a much more gradual process, no doubt with advances and recessions, lasting half a century. If the process begins unmistakeably in II3I A.D., with Can-sfi I's building of Shw6gu-gyi, the final triumph of the new style can hardly be placed earlier than ii83, beyond the end of our period, when Canisii II built the Sulamani (Ciddmani)1, and the Burmese temple finally reached maturity. It must not be assumed, then, that the new-style temples dealt with in this chapter were all built later than those treated in the last. Nor even that they are all in the new style. The last to be mentioned, Dhammayan-gyi, c. ii6o A.D., is really the swan-song of the dying 'Old Mon' style. The Old Burman, one feels, was in temperament different from the Mon-less sensitive, simpler, rougher and more vigorous. Written in prose or verse, Old Mon is full of poetry. Old Burmese is empty of it. But it would be quite wrong to conclude that the fine arts were beyond him. His early architec- ture refutes any such idea. Here, almost from the first, as if by magic, he strikes a note of grandeur, which Old Mon architecture, with all its mystery and beauty, hardly attained. The Mon romantic style - the gradual passage from blaze of tropic sunshine to dim religious and awe-inspiring gloom - soon ceased to appeal to the Pagan Burman. Plain, prosaic, matter-of-fact, he hated gloom and loved brightness and clarity. He wanted height, strength and grandeur. The hori- zontal Mon arch-pediment he made vertical and flamboyant. He cleared away the perforated windows, opened large doorways in each face, and reduced the pitch-dark central shrine (if he did not abolish it) to a solid core of masonry, with or without recesses. So far, he followed the example of Late Mon Nanda, or Pyu Lemyet-hna at Old Prome. He was quick to notice the structural weakness of many of the Mon temples: their roughcast roofing letting in the damp; their lean-to corridor-vaulting, liable to fall with a shake; their wooden lintels; their strange reluctance to trust the radiating arch. Whenever earthquake shook their vous- soirs, he could (if he knew Old Prome) contrast the greater stability of Pyu vaults, built several centuries earlier. Though prone to lapse into carelessness about finish, symmetry and detail, he soon I See List ii3, PPA I45-6, S.I.P. i8-i9, inscription in Sulamani temple, Pagan, dated 545 s./Ii83 A.D.</page><page sequence="427">Chapter XX 407 learnt (by Mon example and warning) to be a better architect. Of all the hundreds of Burmese temples at Minnanthu and Pwazaw, few are structurally unsound. Justly conscious of his power to build, his main change, almost from the first, was to add another storey or storeys. He did not do this, one may guess, for purely aesthetic reasons; he did not set himself consciously 'to achieve the pyramidal.' We do not know if sumptuary laws played any part: confining storeyed buildings to Burmese royalty, and so, in effect, prescribing them. His method was not just to add another storey on top of the first (as the Mons were trying to do at Myebontha and Hlainggu); for the Shrine with its great Buddha must always occupy the highest central point. He just raised it higher on a platform. The platform was at first solid; then hollowed by corridors to form a second storey below the first. Burman and Pyu have always loved to crown their hills with pagodas. So the main urge was very likely one of religious propriety. People and peoples differ widely in their religious needs. To some the essential is to bring the divine down to earth, to human level. To others (such as the builders of Barabudur) the path of salvation lies in climbing step by step the ascent to where the Buddha sits, or seems to sit, and so beyond it to Nirvana, or to Buddhahood. SHWE-GU-GYI, "Great Golden Cave" (Pls. 368-375) The Shwegu temple, S.W. of Kyanzittha's palace-site, is the first specimen of Early Burmese Transitional architecture. Two stone slabs let into the N. wall of the corridor, engraved in Pali verse with dates at the end in Sanskrit, enable us to fix it exactly: I053 MS., c. 493 s./II3I A.D.2 It was built in 74 months, between April and November, by Cansii I, ever since known as 'Shwegu-ddyaka', "Donor of Shwegu." The inscription may not be original; but if not, it is an early copy, and there is no reason to question the date. Caflsfi I "pointed and caused to be made for the great Seer, Gotama Buddha, this pleasant and delightful fragrant chamber, adorned with many cetiyas and figures of gods, as though it were raised on high ground, sheltering a wonder-working image of the Lord of the World."3 "As though it were raised on high ground (santhdnavantarn uccena padhabyd uggatamt viya)" - that is the main new feature. It is not yet two-storeyed; but it stands on a brick platform I3 to ig ft. high, measuring I5I ft. from N. to S. and nearly 8o ft. from E. to W. It faces N.; and the modest flight of steps at the N.W. corner is the only means of access, giving, as one tops the platform, a beautiful perspective of the whole. The platform has no mouldings at the base (now buried); but those above its cornice are remarkable (P1. 372 d): three receding parapets, the lowest faced with up-and-down turned lotus leaves; above them, a parapet inset with crenellations, picked out with green-glazed tiles; at the top, just below the platform-crest, a third parapet faced with lines of Devas, all seated in padmasana, namaskara mtdra, wearing crowns. Perhaps they once surrounded the whole platform. Today one counts only about 28 (the best preserved) in the centre of the S. face (P1. 373 a, b), and 34 on the W. face towards the S.W. corner. 2 For this inscription, see supra, Ch. V, pp. 85-88; I.B., P1. I 2, lines 43-45 (the Sanskrit date). The inscription has been re-edited by Pe Maung Tin and the author in Bulletin of the Burma Historical Commission, Vol. I, Part i, pp. I-28 (June i960). 3 Face A, vv. 25-27.</page><page sequence="428">408 Chapter XX The inscription mentions a "copy of the supreme Tip~taka"4 made and dedicated to the temple. Perhaps this is why, in Old Burmese inscriptions, the term 'Shwegu' (rlwy kt')5 usually implies a library of the sacred books. The temple itself, exclusive of the platform, measures almost ioo ft. in length, and 671 ft. at broad- est. Exterior decoration, drowned now in ghastly whitewash, was once magnificent. All doorways have side-niches for dvirapcdas, and above them flamboyant arch-pediments. The main entrance-arch (P1. 370) has the treble cinquefoil pediment: the inner clec has the goddess 'rt (Mon kydk Sri) seated in the centre, gods bearing lotuses kneeling on each of the spires, and Makaras at the sides, with Devas seated on lotus above and below the Makara's neck. All other doorways (P1. 372 d) have the double pediment: the inner clec with kydk srW and Makaras. Sri has lost her elephants, and is now reduced to a crosslegged seated figure, holding lotuses. The outer clec on the main entrance-arches is of Makara type, with pointed spires; at the sides of the Hall they are backed on horizontal roofs of Mon type, with lotus seats at the ends, tapering to a squared stupa. The kRrtimukha frieze is splendid all round. The clec and sikhara-framing of the two side-windows on each main face, are also notable, and the square, arched window, wreathed in tendrils, lighting the staircase near the N.W. corner. The stucco-carving of pilasters is most varied and intricate (P1. 374 b). The windswept soaring of the corner-pilasters is equalled by that on the Ratanabiman Payahla (No. 79I), S. of Man-aung temple (P1. 375 b); but nowhere else, I think, at Pagan. Plinth-mouldings, though low, still retain the strong Mon profile. Doorways have finally rejected wooden lintels, but still keep more or less in ruin, their wooden lattice-doors on all four sides of the main block. Though half the height of the Nanda doors, they are so like them, both in patterns and style of construction, that it is difficult to deny that both are original, or at any rate co-eval. The broad double doors between Hall and Shrine have wings each nearly 6 ft. wide and over IO ft. high, excluding the top 'triangle'. These doors have broad grooves at the base, controlling the swing. As at the Nanda, the top corners of each wing show a broad lotus leaf, the bottom corners double leaves overlapping, with lines of crinkled lotus flowers filling in the frames, and star-shaped metal nails at points of intersection. Only one wing of the E. door survives, similar but narrow (8 ft. high, 3 ft. 5 in. broad). On the S. doors the similar carving of the 8 ft. frames is mostly lost; but the median overlap (I3 ft. high) shows, as at the Nanda, a stool with waistband at the base, and a comic round-faced standing 'guardian', with skirt girt between his legs, and crest of hair above his head. He holds a lily leaf, from which a beautifully balanced pattern of overlapping oak-leaves rises, broader than those of the Nanda. The top 'triangles' are rounded to fit the arch. That of the W. wing alone retains its lovely hamsa filling. Of the W. doors, both wings are almost complete, with diamond lattice, plank covering, studs, small crinkled lotus, and large lotus leaves, as usual, at the mitre-joints. At the top a beautiful pair of hamsas face other, holding stalks in their beaks (P1. 374 a). The median overlap, however, is of late date, coarse and finicky in carving, quite different from the bold broad overlap of the S. door. The airy Hall (25 ft. square) is roughly 'Mon' in style. Perhaps to give added breadth to the inner doorway, the usual Guardian Bodhisattvas are omitted. At the N.W. corner there is a staircase leading 4 ibid. V. 29. 5 I.B. P1.

The Hall contains a small Burmese inscription in clear coarse cursive, set up by Bayin- naung in 9I3 s./155I A.D., shortly after his accession, confirming former gifts to religion and fixing taxes as usual.6 Mounting the three steps into what, in a 'Mon' temple, would have been the dim corridor surround- ing the dark shrine, one notices the main change. There is no gloom, no flitter of bats. Thanks to the doorways and open windows, light is spread evenly almost everywhere. Half-arched corridor and shrine have become one broad room. The shrine has dwindled to a recess. But the change is clumsily effected. What astounds me about the Shwegu-gyi is, on the one hand, the supreme confidence, com- petence and originality of the Burman architect in designing his exterior; and, on the other, his plain incompetence in planning the interior. Its present bareness, it is true, is due in part to vandals of a later age, who blotted out with whitewash all the paintings, still faintly visible in patches almost everywhere. The central mass has still, almost at eye-level, heavy mouldings, crenellations, up-and-down turned lotus, cornice with floral arabesque, and kxrtimukha frieze - all ugly and quite out of place. To right and left of the entrance-arch, let into the outer wall, are the stones of the great Pali/Sanskrit inscription. There is also a late ink-inscription (I3 lines) on the inner wall. Above the pedimented niches Burmese flamboyants are clumsily embossed on Mon horizontals. Apart from the large brick Buddhas, there are no reliefs in richly stuccoed niches. All the beauty and splendour of a Mon interior have been lost, and little but good lighting has been gained. But climb the staircase to the roof over the hall, and stand back against the north front: you will feel the concentrated beauty of this rich diadem above the Buddha's head. Ogee roofs are gone, but not the grandeur of the high plinth-mouldings, at once delicate and massive. The ups and downs of lotus, swaying to the corners, are divided to admit string-courses enclosing flower-medallions and plain plaques of glazing. The finials stand firm; and bright light (sunlight or moonlight) thrids the corner-stupas. These are topped with neither Aikhara nor 'bell'. Each is an open casket crowned with tiers of jewelled lids and elongated finials. The Chronicles,7 right or wrong, tell the grim story of the death of Shwegu-d yaka: - "Now when he reached the age of ioi, he fell grievously sick. His son Narathu removed him from the throne and kept him within Shwegu pagoda. And the king recovered consciousness awhile and said 'This is not my palace, surely!' And the handmaid spake into his ear saying 'Not thy palace, but thy work of merit!' 'Whose trickery is this ?' he cried. She answered 'Thy son Narathu decreed it.' And the king was convulsed with anger; his whole body burned like fire. Then his son Narathu bethought him: 'If the king ariseth from his sickness I shall be utterly destroyed!' So with clothes and garments he pressed down the king until he died. Some Chronicles say that he was placed beneath a pergola of gourds, and that it fell on him and so he died." SEIN-NYET AMA TEMPLE (P1. 376) The grand Sein-nyet pair are on the E. side of the road S. of Nagayon, at the crest of high ground about a mile S. of Myinpagan. The elaborate cetiya, Sein-nyet Nyima ('younger sister', P1. 377) has 6 List 107I, PPA i98, II lines, 2095 A.B./9I3 S/I55I A.D. 7 U Kala, Vol. I, p. 238. Hmannan Yazawin (Susodhita ed.), I, p. 31o. G.P.C. (transl.), pp. I27-8.</page><page sequence="430">4I0 Chapter XX been described in Ch. XIII (p. 280). It remains to describe the contemporary temple, Sein-nyet Ama ('elder sister'), which stands within the same enclosure-wall, a few yards W. of the cetiya. A Sein-nyet (Cim: Oak) Prince is just mentioned in the Chronicles,8 in the middle of the reign of Alaungsithu (Can-sfi I). He was a monk, who was appointed Primate on the death of Shin Arahan.9 I do not think the name occurs in original inscriptions of that reign; but since it still lives on the lips of the people, there is no reason for doubt. The two Sein-nyet pagodas, both of similar height (c. go ft.), are meatly placed in the central E./W. axis of a broad-topped brick enclosure-wall, still in fair condition on all sides, especially the north. A low inner parapet-wall runs parallel from the W. outer wall so as to enclose the pair, leaving a broad area on three sides, for wooden monasteries etc., within the outer enclosure. The only approach is from the W. It leads direct from road to temple. The cetiya is on the E. The temple is thus entered from the back: for its broad Hall is on the E., facing the cetiya. There are 3 bare openings in the inner wall: on the E. beyond the cetiya, and on the N. and S. between the pagodas. The inner enclosure is paved with brick. The temple stands impressively firm and high upon its windy hill. It has a sikhara top above 4 steep terraces, the lower 3 with medial stairways and corner-stupas. On the E., the lowest terrace has a small medial gfi, intended (not very effectively) to hold together Temple and Hall. The latter, though large, is low, with two perforated windows, capped with flame-pediments, on each side. The three other sides of the temple have equally wide arches of entrance, but porches rather than halls. All entrances were grandly framed with triple pediments; but little except the inner one survives, with SrT seated in the centre. Much of the stucco-work is lost; but what remains, especially on the jambs, is n otable: climbing arabesque, sometimes enclosing vya-las crouching on elephants; haphsas holding flowers in beaks; dragons with heads reverted; seated Devas; crested cocks or peacocks; kfrti- mukhas at top or bottom corners; lions; kfrtimukha frieze-loops enclosing floral 'anchors'. High flights of steps lead up to all the entrances. Occasional stonework is seen in the masonry; but plinth mouldings are rather weak, with projecting 'cornice' and deep recesses with small empty pockets. The interior of the temple proper is bare. There are bricked-up arches near the corners, perhaps leading to kammaftthan cells; but these were closed and painted over almost from the first. The general 8 Cim:niak.

U Kala's printed text (I, p. 230) reads Cimiiak. 9 Shin Arahan, it appears, had accompanied the king on an arduous expedition to quell rebellions in various parts of Tenasserim, and died on his return. If he really came first to Pagaln early in Aniruddha's reign, as the Chronicles assert - say 1050 A.D., he must have been about a hundred years old at the time of this expedition. There is, however, some late-inscriptional basis for the story. List 277, a stone inscription found in "Izagona monastery, Minnanthu," and now unfortunately set up in Nandaminya temple, with which (I think) it has no connection, is dated 6io s./ 1248 A.D. It tells how king Narapaticafisg (Narapatisithu) asks his minister Kyoaucwd (Kyawzwa) to join him in building a pagoda; and how, under dream-orders from Sakka king of Devas, Shin Arahan is sent to Tanajisari praii ('Tenasserim kingdom') to get holy Relics. - This would make Shin Arahan over 200 years old when he died. In 6io s. the reigning king was Kyazwa (Klacwd), not Narapatisithu. And no mention of a minister Kyawzwa occurs in original inscriptions of either reign. List 277 is clearly a late, unreliable inscription. But Caiisi I was, likely enough, a far-traveller by sea; and the mahathera Arahan certainly flourished under Kyanzittha's reign, and possibly beyond it. I suspect that the primary mistake of the Chronicles was to bring him from Thaton to Pagan as early as I050 A.D. He was Kyanzittha's "right-hand man" rather than Aniruddha's.</page><page sequence="431">Chapter XX 4II effect here is Burmese rather than 'Mon', though such painting as survives is Mon in style and colouring. The chief interest lies in the Hall, which has a gabled top, ribbed (as at Nagayon and Nanda), not flat nor topped with corner-stupas as is usual on the 'Mon' temple. The entrance-arch has good kyaktanAuiy tondoes on the ceiling. The topmost painted tier on both sides shows a row of the 28 Buddhas, but no writing below them. Below these, all three walls and window-embrasures have tiers of Jdtaka panels, with Burmese glosses though the painting is Mon. The series starts on the S. wall from the S.E. corner, and goes round the S., N., and E. walls of the Hall, approximately as follows:- Tier I - Jdt. I to 50. Tier 6 - Jdt. 225 to 255. Tier 2 - Jat. 5I to I03. Tier 7 - Jdt. 256 to 326. Tier 3 - Jat. I04 to I53. Tier 8 - Jat. 327 to 395. Tier 4 - Jat. I54 to I92. Tier 9 - Jat. 396 to 463. Tier 5 - Jat. I93 to 224. Tier IO - Jat. 464 etc. The number of Jdtakas per tier varies according as the window-embrasures are, or are not, utilized. There appear to be II tiers altogether. Each panel is about II inches square, including the line of writing at the base. The actual handwriting is old and good, though faint and often illegible. But the work was carelessly done, and sometimes the writing is missing though the painting is complete. Numbers are not given. Here are two typical specimens (E. wall, 3rd tier, S.E. corner): - I52. Sigdla Jdtaka. - sikdla jat purhalofi khrafisiy phlac so "The Future Buddha being a Lion." I53. Sfikara Jataka. - sil..ra jat purhaloft khrafi phlac so "The Future Buddha being a Mosquito." The latter gloss intrigued us as a novelty, until we realized that khran 'mosquito' was just a careless mistake for khransiy 'lion'! We tried to read about 8o of these glosses, but few readings are certain. Perhaps the following variant titles are worth mentioning: - I94. Manicora Jataka. - Sakkatithiya jat. (See the story.) 255. Suka Jataka. - Our fragmentary reading supports the regular Paga'n name: Ydvasomatta(nu). 270. Ulfika Jataka. - . . Hansa jat. In this story the Hansa (Wild Goose) was preferred, as king of birds, to Ulfika (the Owl). 395. Kaka Jataka. - Mandika jat. 47I. Mendaka Jataka. - Mandika jat. - This latter is the Question about the Ram (Pali menda). There is no Ram in Jataka 395, where Pigeon and Crow are at issue. Perhaps the sense is manda "stupid"? TAINGCHUT (TUINIKHET) temple (P1. 378) A small temple (54 ft. by 36 ft.), facing W., about IOO yds. outside Tharaba Gate, on the N. of Ananda monastery. An important inscription, with two distinct faces, was found here, and is now Stone 57 at Pagan Museum nearby. The Obverse (or W.) face10 three times (in lines 2, 9, i8) names the temple Tuih-khet.

This face, interesting for other reasons, tells us little about the temple itself, which was probably built a generation earlier. The donor, it says, had gilded all its images of the Buddha, those of Siri- puttra and Mokkalait, and two of Lord Gavatpati, before dedicating himself and all his family as pagoda slaves. The Reverse,"2 much later in date, 706 s./I345 A.D., mentions its earlier history from 50I-2 S./II40 A.D., in the reign of king Cautsei - perhaps the date of its building. Dedications were then made by the king and members of his Court, including his queen Ratandprti," his "lady of the royal Betel", his mayor of the palace, etc. For a fuller account, see supra, Ch. V, p. 89. By I345 A.D. the temple's name had already been corrupted into its modern form 'Taingchut' (Tufihkhywat, lines 2, I2, I7, 27). This little temple, thoroughly Burmese, still keeps its beauty of external form, though sadly spoiled by centuries of repair and whitewash. With its shapely s'ikhara and now elongated spire, its two ter- races lined with low crenelles, its strange bell-casket corner-stupas, its strong plinth, its flame-pediments, triple over the W. entrance, double over N. and S. side-windows, and even the false-window at the back - it still gives eye-joy, dulled with doubt, to the archaeologist. The interior has I7 deep niches and images; but neither (surely) are original. The three bhiXmisparsa Buddhas on one throne - the one on the right touching Earth with his right hand, the one on the left with his left - cannot be original. The finely designed old paintings on the four pendentives are now splashed with whitewash; the tiers of old panels on the walls obliterated; the old complex foliated soffit of the broad central arch ruined. THATBYINNYU TEMPLE (Pali Sabbanniu, "the Omniscient"). The noblest monument (I feel) of Burmese, and Burma's, architecture (P1. 379 to 390). When Yule in i855 wrote of "the stupendous architectural majesty of the Thapinyu and the Ananda,"13 he was not exaggerating. His Chapter II, "The Remains at Pagan" (pp. 30-54), is in itself a masterpiece of rapid work, accurate description, careful measurement, and beautiful reproduction.14 Plate 386 a of our book is still taken from Plate 7 of Yule's. The temple stands in the S.E. corner of the city-walls, which have been extended to contain it. The earliest mention of the name applied to the temple (kit), occurs, after the fall of Paga'n as capital, in 696 s./333-4 A.D., on a small inscription now Stone 89 at Pagan Museum,15 which appears to come from the temple. It records a dedication by a monk (MafilyaA or Sanlyah chryi) of the five-cubit cross- legged image of the Buddha on the N. face in Sabbaniu kit; also 6 male slaves and 30 ticals of silver, the interest on which was to cover the daily food-offering. He shares the merit with his teacher, the royal Mahlithera and the king of Paga'n (Pukaxh maitkrf). 12 I.B., P1. V 476, 706 s./I345 A.D.

These are com- monly regarded as the bell-pillars of the temple (Pls. 379, 380). There is now no evidence of similar bell-pillars at Shwegu-gyi. Taw Sein Ko dated the building of the temple in II44 A.D.18 He did not state his authority; and I suspect that this date - only I3 years after the building of Shw6gu - is rather too early. The advance in building-technique - from one storey to four, achieved with perfect confidence and skill - seems to me too great. And the temple, though complete as a structure, is so ascetic, so bare of ornament, that I wonder whether the king died while the interior decoration, and some of the exterior, was still to do. It is true that that the present absence, or near-absence, of wall-painting may be due to other causes. In his I904 Report19 Taw Sein Ko writes: - "I noticed, with great regret, that whitewash had been applied too indiscriminately through- out the building, and that a number of mural paintings had disappeared under the white- wash." One can still see taint traces of Buddhas under the whitewash in the upper storeys.20 It is also true that Caiisfi I's mind, as revealed in his Shw6gu inscription21, was ascetic: Longings of sense for all delicious things, Sounds, sights and touches, odours, relishes, Pregnant of immorality, begone! He was moved only by pure religious aspiration. Still I think that he did not live to complete all that he had in mind. Apart from the grand flame-pediments, there is hardly any decoration. No stucco-carving on pilasters. No dado. No ktrtimukha frieze. No cornice-mouldings. How different from the Shwegu! The upper terrace-plinths mostly have large pockets, as if for Jitaka plaques. On the lowest roof- terrace there are 250 pockets measuring i8j in. by i6 in. On the second roof-terrace i89, measuring I7j in. by I5j in. Those of the main upper storey measure only 9 in. by 5j in., intended probably for points of colour only, so as not to distract attention from the main Buddha of the temple.

In the early days of the Archaeological Department, repairs were sometimes reckless; and I fear the Thatbyinnyu was one of the worst sufferers: - "At the entrance of the Thatbyinnyu pagoda, the two figures of Nats have been badly restored, notwithstanding the existence of good models in the Ananda, which is close by. I have, therefore, suggested the removal of the restored figures, which are hideous. The images of Buddha have also been renovated most unsatisfactorily. A yellow paint has been used to indicate the colour of the flesh, and the robes have been painted red. The black lines of the eyes, eyebrows, mouth and nose have been touched up in such a way as to impart a most ludicrous expression to the features- " (ibid., p. 6). "The two figures of Nats at the entrance have not yet been improved, as suggested by me. Only two of the images of the Buddha have had their features painted; the others have merely been whitewashed" (ibid., 1905, p. 5). 20 P1. 390 c shows the last survivor (I think) of original painting in the Thatbyinnyu - on the ceiling of the ground floor, West Hall. Ex pede Herculem. 21 Face B, v. 8o.</page><page sequence="434">4I4 Chapter XX pockets of the next upper terrace measure I7 in. by I5 in. These large pockets, 250 + i89 + i00, total 539: just enough to admit all the Jdtakas except the Mahdnipdta. These ten great Jdtakas, which are assigned many more than a single plaque apiece, though reduced in size, on the Nanda and Mingalazedi, might well have received similar treatment on the three top terraces of Thatbyinnyu, where the pockets still measure about I4 in. by i2 in. - This Jdtaka series, I suggest, was intended, but never realized. I have argued in Chapter V (p. 85) that Caiisfi I died before ii6o A.D.; for his successor, who was killed in ii65, had had time to build the enormous Dhammayan-gyi temple before his assassination. I should therefore date the Thatbyinnyu c. II50-55 A.D. The first impression of this great temple, 2I0 ft. high, is of two massive cubes superposed, with three receding terraces between them, and three more terraces above, supporting a short gikhara. The two cubes contain the two main storeys (ist and 3rd); the terraced sections the two entresols (2nd and 4th). The best approach is from the N.W., from the side of Nanda, where the two main cubes are stepped up to by the lower cubes, only less massive, of the East Halls. The lower Hall matches in breadth (io6 ft.), though not in depth, the whole upper cube. Both Halls are faced with a similar triple pediment, magnificent, the lower one rather more solid, and propped with minor archways at the sides, the upper one more delicate. The other three Halls of the ground storey are little more than porches, serving to break the hard lines of the cube. Their doorways have a single clec, with Srf in the high centre, makaras at the sides. A large medial stupa above these halls conducts the eye through the long crenellated terraces to the upper cube, which has no halls except on the E., but only double pediments, always with CAD and makaras, their spires licking up the walls like flames. These, again, conduct the eye to the three medial pediments above the upper stairways leading to the peak. All pediments are of vertical Burmese type, except those of the minor doorways on the ground- floor, which are weighted with Mon horizontals behind their vertical facings (P1. 387 b). The cusped windows of the ist entresol have a double lotus base above the band. The side-windows of the main upper storey are crowned with sikharas, like those of Shwegu-gyi. Above them, for the upper entresol, there are square windows edged with lotus. Larger square windows flank the main Hall. Only the topmost spires of the two Hall-pediments with their Srf apex, break loose from the walls behind them, and blaze upwards into space. Another binding force, descending from the summit, lies in the recession-lines of the faces of the tikhara. These spread cascading down to the ever-broadening recessions of the upper terraces, where they are held by the firm line of climbing corner-stupas. Water and Fire - the Twin Miracle! Strength is the keynote of the whole, based on the cubes. But proportions are so carefully designed and distributed, that there is rarely any sense of undue weight or mass. As one climbs the numerous stairways and wanders along the passages, one often comes on vaulted rooms or karnmattl1an cells, lightening the load or playing with it. Ground floor. A glance at Yule's longitudinal section (P1. 386 a) will show how like a solid platform, how like the Shwegu-gyi in fact, the ground storey of Thatpyinnyu, and even the entresol above it, still remain: a single corridor going round the ground floor, a double one round the entresol. The dominance of the 3rd (main) storey, with its Buddha, is also apparent. Each side of the ground floor has 7 archways of entrance, 3 on each side of the smaller Halls with their one central doorway, and 2 on each side of the East Hall with its three.</page><page sequence="435">Chapter XX 4I5 The general plan of the E. Hall, with its cross-vista between the two side-entrances and four central pillars, is copied, on a larger scale, from that of the Nanda Halls. But the central feature - the base of the main staircase - is different. The Old Mon tradition is here changing, but still strong: entry to the temple proper, at the back of the Hall, should be given emphasis by a great pedimented toraia, guarded by giant standing Bodhisattvas at the sides. The two gay painted Bodhisattva Nats - not Mon, but frank Burmese (P1. 387 a) - whom Taw Sein Ko wished to abolish or "improve," are still there; but now dwarfed by the torana. Narrowed to enclose the staircase, this torana has become thick and massive: crenelles at the bottom sides; Burmese verticals in front; triple Mon horizontals behind with 'chilli' finials; and behind these, 5 tiers of larger Mon horizontals, supporting a bulbous stupa with 8 vertical bands (rather like the top of Pahtothamya). To the normal Western mind, a staircase is just a staircase; and all this fuss about its base seems otiose or ugly. To the pious Buddhist, on the other hand, starting on his long ascent to Buddhahood, c'est toujours le premier pas qui cofite. In the Nanda Halls Kyanzittha quietly enforced this by placing his favourite pair of identical sculptures on either side of the steps: the Buddha taking his first seat below the Bodhi tree, amid the acclaim of Devas and Brahmns. There are two other staircases in the Hall, one on each side of the main entrance, which climb to the lowest roof-terrace. The ground floor corridor is paved with stone. There is full vaulting, but not high; and the crosslights down the corridor are half-blocked at the centres by the large projecting thrones in the S., W., and N. porches. These little Halls or porches were clearly meant to form small private chapels: the large throned Buddha in back centre; two smaller Buddhas, on black rosetted lotus thrones, filling the large and deep side-niches; a small square altar in the centre; the ceiling painted with 'sun-gods' white and gold (P1. 390 c), with the mat of sacred Footprints in the centre. The in- scription of I333-4 A.D., mentioned above, suggests that the Buddhas in some of these chapels, date from shortly after the Pagan period; but all are of one pattern, both beautiful and old. Those of the N. Hall are perhaps the best. There are several smaller gilded Earth-touching images on thrones along the corridor; and one (on the N., near the N.E. corner) seated in pralambandsana, dharma- cakramudrd; but these are mostly modernized or modern. There are several late ink-inscriptions in the porches. ist Entresol (or 2nd Storey). The E. Hall facade shows two tiers - of Archway, band and lotus- pedimented window - on each side of the great triple Flame-pediment. To reach the lowest roof- terrace, take one of the corner staircases on either side of the main entrance. On the way up, you pass the square side-windows (as in Shwegu) and the long vaulted rooms meant to lighten weight, and emerge on the S. or N. face in the re-entrant between E. Hall and main block. Nearly half the Jdtaka- pockets line this terrace. One can walk all round. The lower tiers of corner-stupas have all passages through them, which make them glow by day or moonlight. The peak of the main flame-pediment on the E. soars io ft. above the centre of this terrace. The young may clamber up thence to the 2nd terrace. The old will prefer to descend to the Hall and mount the central steps between the Bodhi- sattva - Nats. The stretchers of the top steps were once inlaid with jewel medallions. This brings one to the ist Entresol. It has a double corridor, the outer one half-vaulted, the inner a full vault. Even the inner corridor is fairly lighted by windows at the end of each face, and by two cross-passages and one arched central light-hole from the outer corridor. The outer corridor is well lighted on three sides by 6 level windows on each face, and an arched light-hole in the centre, practised</page><page sequence="436">4i6 Chapter XX above the central Buddhas in the porches below. But this outer Corridor is blocked in the E. centre by the main staircases ascending and descending.22 From the top of the central flight, two others im- mediately to right or left, will take you up to the E., to emerge on either side of a broad open ramp, leading to the upper storey and the Shrine. The stone ramp is triple, simulating the three stairways of jewel, gold and silver, borne below by Makara, by which the Buddha, attended by Indra and Brahmd, came down from Thvatiihsa. Under the ramp (Pls. 387 c, 389 a), four steps lead down to a large vaulted room, running into the mass some 20 ft. The platform at the foot of the ramp has corner-stupas on the E. with central shrines facing each other. Descend a few steps to left or right, to the 2nd terrace, lined with i89 large Jdtaka pockets. The view is glorious. Not only the landscape, but the temple: the three long terraces and plinths; the bulbous medial stupa on its platform on the tier below; the noble forms and spacing of the corner- stupas (P1. 388 a, b, c). Finest of all, perhaps, the simple ramp and triple pediment above it, with seated Bodhisattvas. Main (3rd) Storey. The small plinth-pockets here are meant for coloured jewel-glazings. The Hall, though bright and airy, with its two side-archways vaulted from the shoulders, not the floor, is still of 'Mon' type, the E. and W. walls vertical. The rSY and Makara pediment still frames the inner doorway, with thrones on either side, now holding giant almsbowls, but once perhaps standing Bodhisattvas. The upper staircase climbs from the S. E. corner. Five steps now divide Hall and Corridor-Shrine. The Shrine has tall side-archways, now barred against bats, though full light enters from all three sides. The colossal throned image (P1. 390 a) is well preserved, but post-Paga'n. The Corridor has still the lean-to vault. It is well lit by high trefoil ?ikhara-windows at each corner, with 7 steps leading up to them from within. On the W. inner side there is a deep image-niche, strongly embossed with throne and small makara-pediment. The broad platform round this main storey holds the 3rd tier of bulbous corner-stupas, not pierced for passage as are those of the two narrow tiers below. They are empty cells, facing each other on the E. side, both facing E. on the W. side. The crenellated border of the platform is here low, so as to let this upper cube stand its full height, with no porch-projections except on the E. 2nd Entresol (4th Storey). The top staircase leads out inconspicuously on to the well-parapeted platform at the base of the main external flights of steps. The peak of the main Shrine Pediment almost reaches to this level. From the small porch-terrace 5 steps below this platform, 6 steps on the inner side lead up to the 2nd entresol, the top storey. Here is a single corridor, 7 ft. 8 in. broad, and about 75 ft. square, half-vaulted. The interior walls are blank, everything whitewashed. At each corner 6 or 7 steps descend to the square windows; in the middle of each face 6 to 8 steps ascend to square upper light-holes in the terrace wall above, now mostly blocked against rain. Steps on the N. side descend to the porch terrace. This has solid bell-shaped stupas at the front, with the peak of the great Shrine Pediment below rising in the centre. Even this porch-terrace provides some 3I pockets available for small plaques, about a foot square. The next full terrace above it has ioo full-size pockets, I7 in. x I5 in.; and the two top terraces 8o + 6i pockets, of size varying from I2 in. to IO in. 22 Children! Beware! - If you turn E. at the block, you will soon find yourself on the brink of a precipice! - Fifty years ago, romping down these passages after dark, I kicked a low stone sill and put my foot over it. There was, thank God!, a ledge on the far side. Wondering where I was, I fumbled for a match and found myself on the brink, with a clear drop of 24 ft. to the stone pavement of the Hall.</page><page sequence="437">Chapter XX 4I7 Top terraces and ?ikhara. From the E. platform 48 steep steps lead up through the three top ter- races to the spire. All three have grand bulbous corner-stupas, pierced for passage. In the centre of each face, the lower two are crowned with pedimented archways (Mon-Burmese, vertical spines backed on horizontals). The top terrace has just jambs and knobs, without flame-pediments, and no parapet but just crenelles flush with the floor. The reason was to expose the short but massive Sikhara, mounted on its high and cushioned throne. This has the usual broad flat 'triangle' down the centre. Beyond this rock-like band, the Sikhara-surface is slitted to the corners; with two recessions curved like water falling from the stupa-finial. Four cusps at the top of the gikhara hold the recessed square platform below the banded bell. The stupa is not round, but also a recessed square. Even the slitted tiers of the chattravali are squared and recessed towards their corners, always emphasizing the Water motif, as the clec emphasize the Flame. This is no lifeless pile of brick and plaster. It is the Puryhd, the Buddha, exhibiting the Great Miracle. See the Deluge descending from his shoulders! See the Holocaust ascending from his feet! DHAMMAYAN GYI TEMPLE (Dhammdrama, 'Pleasance of the Law'). This great temple (Pls. 39I-397) stands about a mile S.E. of Pagan city, in the centre of the whole area - S.W. of Wet-kyi-in, W.NW. of Minnanthu, N.W. of Pwazaw, N.E. of Myinpagan. It contains three old inscription-stones, with four separate dated in- scriptions. In the N. Hall there is a four-faced pillar, including, on its S. and N. faces, a Burmese inscription dated 527 s./ii65-6 A.D.23 This records the dedication of "the Middle Princess," Ajdwlat(?), on behalf of her mother. This finely engraved inscription, important both for historical and linguistic reasons, has been discussed at length in Chapters VI and VII (supra, pp. III-II3, ii8). It has also been edited in the Bulletin of the Burma Historical Commission. The temple was presumably built before this date. A different small inscription, dated 582 S./I22o A.D.,24 is engraved on the E. face of the same pillar. It records a dedication, in that year, by Khan Mi Pay Puiw (probably a royal concubine) of 5 slaves to her sT pttrhM (?' Thein'). In the W. Hall are two other stone inscriptions. The older, dated 578 s./I2i6 A.D.,25 records a royal gift of land in Kyaukse by king Natoil Skhii to the minister Mittrasincai: who dedicates part of it, together with 2 elephants and io slaves, for the support of the chief monk of the pagoda (purh sailkrT) and the 5 junior monks (pancai). The later inscription is dated (line i6) 6I5 s./I254 A.D.,26 and records gifts of slaves, etc. It also records (line i) a dedication in 567 S./I205 A.D. when king Cansit (Narapatisithu, N. II74-I2II A.D.) tells "the lord of Dhammara', the royal teacher Mahdpamwit, to build a temple (ki) here on this W. side of the Dhammdram." - This is the earliest mention of the name 'Dhammayan-gyi'. Burmese Chronicles27 attribute the temple to Narathu Kulagya, the tyrant king "killed by the Indians": - "The people completed not the Dhammarait, his work of merit, for they were sore afraid 23 I.B., P1.

According to the Devanagala rock-inscription (P1. 399), this was planned in May-June of the I2th regnal year of that king, ii65 A.D. It appears that after the storming of Bassein (KusitmTya), Pagan was temporarily occupied and the king killed. I have suggested that his death took place probably in the latter part of ii65, shortly before the date of our inscription, when the Singhalese were still in occupation of the capital. The building of the temple I should date c. ii60-65 A.D.28 There are mysteries about this temple still to be solved. It is the last of the great 'Mon' temples of Pagan, symmetrical, and in ground-plan much the same as the Nanda: a Greek cross, with central pier, two concentric corridors, and four halls projecting one on each side.29 In bare structure it is far more than complete, for the inner corridor, and all the passages leading to it, are walled up on all sides except the East. - Why? - There is no sign of weakness or subsidence above. The masonry is as fine as any at Pagan. The legend of the monk-alchemist,30 200 years ago, walling himself in (I suppose by magic), may be dismissed. The work involved was enormous, and apparently meaningless. - I can only think of one possible explanation. The blocking was done almost as soon as the temple was built. The Singhalese monarch had felt himself insulted, and his fury is shown in the C,51avafsa: "The king of Arimaddana must either be captured or killed !"31 - The invaders arrived just when the temple was complete, when the donor's merit was at its highest. Not content with killing the king, and doubtless anxious to disarm his ghost, they used their troops and captives to desecrate his temple. Not totally, for they were largely Buddhist themselves; and perhaps the palace women, like Ajdwlat, always bravest in despair, pro- tested; and got leave to keep the East approach open, and conduct privately the dedication-ceremony. - Right or wrong, some such explanation would fit the facts. The Mon-Burmese king, son of Cafisil I, had seen in his youth the glory of the Nanda, the 'Mon' masterpiece; and in middle age the grandeur of the Early Burmese temple, Thatbyinnyu. In the Dhammayan he set out, I think, to combine the excellence of each, and to surpass it. He preferred the perfect symmetry of the Nanda. He chose also to place his main images on the ground floor: seated rather than standing, and raised higher than those of the Nanda, so that one could see them fully from the entrance. Pious persons, entering Thatbyinnyu, may well have been surprised to see in front of them, not the Buddha, but a staircase. On the other hand, the majesty of Thatbyinnyu, its super- posed masses, its flaming pediments and perfect terracing, must have impressed him. The ground plan, as said above, is close to that of Nanda (N.), but a little larger: - Exterior: 4 Halls - Length 55 ft. (N.) - 542 ft. (D). 4 Halls - Breadth 931 ft. (N.) - 97 ft. (D.). Main block - Square i84 ft. (N.) - I94 ft. (D.). 28 II70 A.D., the date assigned by Taw Sein Ko (A.S.B. I905, p. io) is clearly too late. At the end of that Report he gives a useful ground-plan of the temple, on which our own is based (P1. 397 b), showing the bricked-up passages. 29 "The base of the pagoda consists of a huge block of masonry measuring 96 ft. square, which is surrounded by two corridors each measuring 9 ft. in width. There are four main entrances facing the cardinal points, and also intermediate passages joining the two corridors. The passages marked red in the plan are found to be bricked up, but not up to the level of the soffit, leaving a narrow opening throughout the length of the inner corridor" (A.S.B., I905, p. Io). 30A.S.B. 1904, p. io. 31 Cilavamisa, Part II, p. 67 (transl.).</page><page sequence="439">Chapter XX 4I9 Interior: Outer Corridor - Square I481 ft. (N.) - i6I ft. (D.).

There is more difference in the total height: i6o ft. (N.) - i8i+ft. (D.). On first entering the temple enclosure, and noting the fine, though damaged, masonry of the sur- rounding wall, my first impression, on a direct approach to any of the Halls, is of the great height and steep climb of the triple fronton framing the entrance. That of the Nanda sprawls, in comparison, so as to enclose one window on either side of the entrance. At Dhammayan-gyi there are three entrance-archways, the side ones heavy-weighted with Mon horizontal tapering clec, thinly faced with 'flames', and an upper tier of flame-pedimented windows above the band. The main triple pediment rises within these, not enclosing them. An upper band, flush with the roof-cornice, divides the lower from the upper pediment; so that the latter, with its cornucopia, stands out clear above the Hall. One notices also the wide easy spacing of the two lower tiers of corner-stupas, where the corridor roofs are broad and sloping, in contrast to the steep tightness of those of the three top terraces, where plinths are vertical. Here, both Nanda and Thatbyinnyu are superior. Nanda has only 3 tiers of corner-stupas, well spaced because of the ogee roofs; no stupas, but only lions, guard the corners of the three top terraces. Thatbyinnyu has 6 terraces with corner-stupas; but being separated, 3 from 3, by the upper cube, there is no sense of greater tightness or steeper climb; all combine to form a grand perspective. From below, the corner-view of Dhammayan-gyi is more impressive than the front view. Here one sees, at the back of each Hall fronton, another triple pediment, narrower but almost equally high, framing the entrance of what looks like an upper storey. They are only false storeys. If one climbs the wall blocking the entrance of each, one finds oneself in a room over 25 ft. long by 9 ft. broad, with walls arching from the floor on all four sides. There is no through passage from one such room to another. But on the E. side, from the inner wall of the room, a long narrowing light-hole descends to throw some light on the main image of the temple. These false-storey rooms, therefore, are merely large versions of the medial sky-light common in 'Mon' temples from Nanpaya onwards. A more mysterious feature, found on the front of each Hall-roof between the two great pediments, is a high screen with small flat top, pilasters and curving sides, pierced with three corbelled arches. One reaches the roof by the high staircase on the S. side of the E. Hall, which brings one out on to the lowest roof-terrace. Here there are 4 square sikhara-topped corner-cells, slightly lower than those at the corners of the main block. Two long-sloping roofs over the corridors brings one to the upper roof terrace behind the top of the upper pediment. Thence a flight of 38 steps on each face ascends through 4 vertical terraces to the base of the brick pile, over 40 ft. square, which once, no doubt, was a huge crowning gikhara. The lowest corner-stupas, both those of the Halls and of the main block, have gikhara-tops; also those of the 3rd terrace. Those of the 2nd and 4th terraces were bell-topped. Those of the 5th or topmost terrace are blunted. Brs Makara and the gorgon-mask of Ktrtimukha are prominent on most of the pediments. The inner dlec of the main pediments, both upper and lower, have Srt with her arms drooped, seated cross- legged in the central spire. She sits on double lotus above the gorgon-mask, with Makaras at the sides. 27*</page><page sequence="440">420 Chapter XX Pediments on the side-entrances to the halls are double, and massive. Each has SYr in the centre, and Makaras, a yard thick, at the sides. The upper clec has no gorgon-mask, but a flower-fountain sup- porting the double lotus on which Sry sits. The main block, as on the Nanda, has two tiers of flame- pedimented windows. These show the gorgon head at low centre, flower-fountain above, Makaras at the sides, but no ?rf. On the main clec the Makara heads spout Vydlas; the former's bovine hind- quarters and legs are shown. Pilasters supporting the upper pediments, and probably also the lower, had small floral V's at top and bottom, with jewelled diamonds in the centre (P1. 395 b). Lions may face inwards at the sides. Much of the stucco work has perished, but enough remains to show that it was of high standard and originality. Brickwork is extraordinarily tight and fine; the bricks are often thin and short, with little sign of mortar between them. The square-arched windows (P1. 395 a, c), at the sides of all the Halls near the outer corners, delighted Yule: - "Here, to my delight, I discovered a perfect flat brick arch over a window. There were two of these in each wing of the temple, and one of them in particular was as perfect in construction, in joints and radiation, as any London builder could turn out ...... I doubt if in the I2th century the flat brick arch was known in Europe ........ (Mission . to the Court of Ava in i855, P1. 9, fig. 3, and p. 48). Similar square-arched windows are already found at Shwdgu-gyi (II3I A.D.). Stonework is also conspicuous, in the cusps below the clec,32 both trefoil and cinquefoil. There are stone sills in the windows, and strong stone cusps at all jutting corners. Stone bricks occur at intervals in corner-pilasters and re-entrant angles. The W. Hall is paved with stone slabs. The ground-plinth is not remarkable. Vertical up to the stone cusps, it then recedes to the two cord- mouldings enclosing the small centre-band with pockets. In the 'cornice' projections all bricks are packed, as usual, vertically on their sides. The ground-plinth pockets we measured were I24 in. broad by 9 in. high. From the 2nd terrace upwards, all terraces have similar pockets for plaques, roughly ii in. by IO in. These are hardly large enough for Jdtaka scenes. Glazed tiles may well have been intended; and would have vastly brightened this sombre monument; but they are not there. In the interior, what little remains of interest - until the inner corridor is cleared - is in the four Halls. The outer Corridor is bare, apart from late paintings on the walls. From the little evidence available, it seems that the inner corridor, as in the Nanda, was not quite so broad as the outer. The latter was paved with glazed brick. All the Halls had the same scheme of 'architectural' painting of excellent Old Mon type (see P1. 397a): broad bands of warm brown colour framing arches, arch- recessions and pilasters, with lotus rings within and S-shaped floral arabesques without. The four great pillars, too, are painted with lines of lotus-flowers along the capitals and beaded kfrtimukla frieze. E. Hall. - Modern plaster and patching have spoiled most of the old architectural paintings. There are also gilded Buddha-paintings of the early Ava period (?), often signed (as in the Mon Gu E. of Nagayon, and other temples): "the good work of the Sahghayardj, teacher (chryyi) of Anantasiira." On either side of the 4 or 5 steps leading up to the corridor, there are two stone tenons projecting from 32 For clear drawings, taken from the Dhammayan-gyi and Sulamani temples, of the use of stone for pointing the brick cusps of the clec, see Henri Marchal, L'Architecture compare'e dans l'Inde et l'Extreme-Orient, fig. 47, p. 94.</page><page sequence="441">Chapter XX 42I the W. wall, with a brick throne below one of them. These are clearly the remains of the usual two giant Bodhisattvas, standing on guard at the entrance of the temple proper. The Hall is bare except for a large monolithic image of the Buddha, seated in dhydna mudra against the inner pillar. Such stout monoliths in dhydna mudrd, found also at Shw6hsandaw, Dhammardjaka, etc., may perhaps be dated shortly after the fall of Pagan. Above this image, an ink inscription of io lines, dated 705 S./1343 A.D., tells how a pious person called MaIAthail ('royal officer'), "not being able to bear the sight of the ruin done by wicked heretics to the noble pagoda [or Buddha] called Dham- mara*, the ancestral site (aruit ?) of king Caflsfi," spent all his life-savings, won by painful endeavour, in setting up (it seems) this diydna monolith. - This suggests the reason for the making of these mono- liths. In the troubled period before and after the fall of Paga'n, many 'heretics' were driven by poverty to rummage in the brick images of Pagan in search of treasure. The only answer for a pious Buddhist was to carve monoliths, which could not easily be disembowelled. Note that the name Caisii in the above inscription must refer to Narathu Kulagya: it had already become generic, it seems, for any king of Old Pagan. S. Hall. - The architectural painting here is better preserved than in the E. Hall. There is also a colossal Earth-touching Buddha, painted red, on a high-recessed throne. N. Hall. - This also has the architectural painting, and stone door-sills at the sides of entrance with cusps for wooden doors to swing in. As in the S. Hall, on the inner side there is a high-pointed reredos, with a colossal Earth-touching Buddha on his throne, all painted red. On the W. side, near the outer pillar, is Ajdwlat's inscription-stone. W. Hall. - Here, besides the architectural painting, there are the two stone inscriptions mentioned above. The later one begins with the request of Narapatisithu, in 567 S./I205 A.D. towards the end of his reign, addressed to his teacher, Mahdpanita, "lord of Dhammdraii, to build a ki7 (temple) on this West face of Dhammdraii. So I enshrined this phurhi" (Buddha-image ? ). - Mon Bo Kay holds (and I agree with him) that the reference must be to the remarkable double-image in this Hall, set against the broad entrance-archway to the corridor. The front shows a great red-painted throne, bearing two Earth-touching Buddhas seated side by side, each with a normal stupa above his head. Between and above them, there is a third stupa of strange type, with a door or doors, and resting on a long lotus- stalk visible both in front and behind. At the back of the throne, in a long recess, is a Parinirvana scene: the Buddha, with a round, gentle, Burmese face, long tapering fingers and toes carefully model- led, lies with his head to the S. The hand near his head holds long leaves or a kerchief. Mon Bo Kay has given us the key to this extraordinary sculpture of plaster and brick. It is the well- known Mahdydnist scene in the Saddharmapundarska Sfitra, the 'Lotus Sfltra.' Here is E. J. Thomas' account of it: - "The discourse now becomes fantastic, but it is important in showing what the popular con- ception of a Buddha had become. A stupa of jewels appears, and a voice comes from it praising Buddha for uttering this siltra. It is the stupa containing the body of the past Buddha Pra- bhiUaratna, which this Buddha wished to be present whenever the Lotus was being recited, and the Tathgatas from other Buddha-fields are to be present as well. Buddha, therefore, darts a ray which makes millions of worlds visible in all directions with Buddhas preaching the Doctrine in each. They arrive in numbers like the sands of the Ganges, so that there is no room for any gods, and ask Buddha to open the stupa. He does so. Prabhiitaratna is seen</page><page sequence="442">422 Chapter XX sitting crosslegged within, and Buddha sits down by him on half the seat." (History of Buddhist Thought, p. i83). A similar tale, both in India and Tibet, is foretold about the Coming Buddha, Maitreya: - "The small Caitya on the crown of Maitreya is said to refer to the belief that a stilpa in the mount Kukkutapdda near Bodh-Gaya covers a spot where Kasyapa Buddha is lying. When Maitreya would descend to earth, he would go direct to the spot, which would open by magic, and receive from Kasyapa the garments of a Buddha." (B. Bhattacharyya, The Indian Buddhist Iconography, p. 8o; compare A. Getty, The Gods of Northern Buddhism, pp. 2I-24). The greatest moment known to the pious Theravadin is when Buddha meets Future Buddha, and the Prophecy is made. To the Mahdydnist, a greater moment is when two Buddhas, the old and the new, sit for one brief moment together on one throne: symbol, at once of the Change, and of the Con- tinuity of the Dharma. Therein lies the strength of Buddhism as a world-religion. Mahdpanita's message, then, in one of hope. Buddhas release imprisoned Buddhas. They die, but the Dharma remains. The "lord of Dhammara*n "knew that there were Buddhas imprisoned in his temple, whom he and all his meagre staff were powerless to release, But that will surely be done with the coming of a new Buddha. Perhaps, with modern appliances, there is no need to wait till then. When peace at last returns to Burma, before swords are bent into pruning hooks, could they not first be flattened into spades, and join in opening, as a symbol of a new Burma, this old and priceless temple?</page><page sequence="443">ADDENDA, ERRATA ET CORRIGENDA VOLUME I page page viii (1. 15 of Preface) After more than my own.
