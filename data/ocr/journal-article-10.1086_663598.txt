         <p>WHEN, IN 1972, THE SOCIOLOGIST AMOS HAWLEY reflected on the study of the city, he noted that not since the interwar era had one “heard so much about density.” Seeking to explain this surge of interest in space and numbers, he turned his attention to a “curious phenomenon.” In the late 1950s a series of experiments had been instigated at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) by the ecologist John B. Calhoun. They were designed to explore the detrimental effects of crowding among rats and mice. In a 1962 number of <italic>Scientific American</italic>, Calhoun documented in graphic detail the range of “deviant” behaviors that emerged—violence, cannibalism, withdrawal, and homosexuality. This publication rapidly became one of the most widely referenced in psychology, urban sociology, and the design professions and has since been anthologized as one of “Forty Studies That Changed Psychology.”1</p>
         <p>Crowding was a problem to which Calhoun dedicated his entire professional life as a scientist, in ways that traversed boundaries between scientific disciplines and social worlds. This essay will first explore the development of Calhoun's program of research—from the attempt to control rodent populations in the city of Baltimore, to his model “rat cities” in the laboratory, to their representation through publications such as his article in <italic>Scientific American</italic>. I will focus on the two most important elements that he identifies: his “experimental subjects”—or, more precisely, his “experimental societies” of rats and mice—and his “experimental environment”—or, better, his “experimental architecture.” With his explicit focus on the technical and the material, his crowding studies are most fruitfully analyzed historically as “experimental systems,” as defined by Hans-Jörg Rheinberger. Here the focus of the history of science is extended to encompass the “technical objects” of the experimental process that contain, articulate, and continually redefine the “scientific object” or “epistemic thing,” such as crowding pathology.2 While there has been much historical attention given to the model organism as technical object, we are also encouraged to examine the equally important <italic>model environment</italic> in which the organisms are, in turn, contained, restricted, and determined.3</p>
         <p>When historians have discussed the technical objects of the laboratory, the emphasis has been on sanitation, standardization, order, and control. Yet, as Rheinberger argues, the key to a successful experimental system is its ability to generate novelty, and thus new epistemic things, through its technical objects.4 The value of a model organism stems not only from its use as a technical artifact representing nature but as a sample “selected from nature's very own workshop.”5 As such, it is an active and unpredictable material, generating as many questions as answers. Calhoun was explicit in his recognition of the animal as a source of novelty, particularly when allowed to interact with others. He even wrote of the need to allow the animals to “speak” to him. They spoke through the expression of a range of pathological behaviors that he controlled through the design of the pens. For Calhoun, it was not just the animals that were active in an experimental system, but the spaces in which they existed. Space organized and determined communication, hierarchy, and behavior. As one of Calhoun's most prominent allies declared: “space speaks.”6 Thus, while Calhoun used standardized laboratory animals and machinery, in his experimental systems neither the rodent societies nor the laboratory spaces they inhabited were stable. They were unpredictable, ever changing, open ended, resulting in a continuous shift and interchange between technical and scientific object.7 As he describes in his copious research notes and memoranda, by continuously tinkering with the design—placing a partition here, a water bottle there, or by choosing an alternative foodstuff—Calhoun was able to generate and ameliorate a range of often unexpected behaviors. Calhoun perceived his systems to have direct relevance to human behavior and the design of urban environments; they were, quite literally, “machines for making the future”—not only in the laboratory, but in the social world.8</p>
         <p>By placing his model organisms in a model “urban” space, complete with tower blocks, cafeterias, and congested stairwells, he would generate behaviors seemingly synonymous with those of urban man; the combination of abstraction, precision, vivid language, and graphic illustration used in his publications further heightened their appeal. Calhoun's success in generating renewed interest among social scientists in the problem of the crowd is notable, particularly when we consider their troubled historical relations with radical behaviorism—in work based on studies of dogs, rats, and pigeons—and with hereditary determinism and eugenics—which many believed to have reemerged with the greylag geese and fire ants of ethology and sociobiology.9 As the psychotherapist Carl Rogers declared when drawing attention to the problems of population and urbanization: “Imagine me involving a rat study!” It was for this reason that Hawley found the interest in Calhoun's work so “curious”: “This from people who have so studiously held their work aloof from any comparison with findings of biological researches is rather ironic.”10</p>
         <p>After exploring why Calhoun's experiments captured the scientific and public imagination, the essay will turn to the studies of human crowding that his work inspired. We will focus our attention on two subfields of sociology and social psychology: human ecology and environmental psychology. For these promulgators of an earlier “spatial turn” in the social and behavioral sciences, the materialities of numbers, space, and place were crucial, yet too often overlooked, components of social systems. Calhoun's work provided an opportunity to reorient these fields to take account of the effects of the physical environment on behavior. While scientists first merely looked to identify the various pathologies of Calhoun's crowded rats in the human city, they increasingly sought to generate and ameliorate these pathologies in the social laboratory. Thus, they began to adapt not just his ideas and theories, but elements of his experimental systems, to the human species. There emerged an interdisciplinary experimental culture that shared a material style of research focused on the crowd.11 Scientists were not simply legitimating visions of moral and social order through reference to animal behavior; they were beginning to think with animals <italic>and</italic> the material spaces they inhabited—identifying new opportunities for managing individuals and populations in, and through, the design of the physical environment.12</p>
         <p>Through exploring the uptake of Calhoun's systems, we will see how the objects of his laboratory—his model animals and model environments—not only shaped theories of the crowd but continuously determined experimental approaches and applications in the human world. Calhoun's objects mediated between life inside and outside the laboratory. However, while Rheinberger's approach has emphasized the importance of practice, this does not mean that social interests and intellectual commitments do not have an important role in the design of experimental systems. What Paolo Palladino describes as the inevitable “co-constitution of theories and tools” is particularly apparent in the transfer and mediation of systems from one place to another.13 For those adapting Calhoun's systems to human populations, both research practicalities and theoretical inclinations resulted in some objects being privileged over others, redefining the relation between the technical and the epistemic.</p>
         <p>Environmental psychologists differentiated between density—a physical <italic>measure</italic> of numbers per square unit area, as defined by the ecologist—and crowding—a subjective <italic>experience</italic> of too little space and too many people, an object of interest to the psychologist. In doing so, they established a boundary between the human and the nonhuman animal. Yet, as density was further refined as concept and measure, it was retained as a variable of considerable import, and Calhoun's experiments continued to be perceived as complementary studies of interactive social systems determined by the design of material spaces. Psychologists focused their attention on the intricacies of Calhoun's model environments, which, crucially, existed not only as technical conditions but as scientific objects. The design of the built environment was the target of experimental inquiry: space was <italic>active</italic>, determining social interactions, relationships, life. They saw in the rodent pens analogues of the various institutions that made up the urban world in which people were constrained in large numbers. Hospitals, dormitories, and prisons were comparable “urban laboratories”—what Robert Kohler describes as “placeless places”—allowing for similar processes of precision, abstraction, manipulation, replication, and innovation.14 In making such connections and distinctions, social scientists continued to draw significant scientific and social capital from Calhoun's systems while simultaneously promoting a more optimistic alternative: through the better design of physical spaces to control social interaction—whether in rodent laboratories or in human homes, prisons, schools, or hospitals—it was possible not only to create, but also to ameliorate, crowding pathology.</p>
         <p>While psychologists focused on the model environment, others focused on Calhoun's model organism. This approach was particularly prominent among sociologists concerned that, with the growing obsession over physical variables, the social factors and individual actions that determined the desirability of urban places were being overlooked. They carried out their own studies of human beings to test a simplified version of Calhoun's systems: the physical elements of density and crowding (the stimulus of individuals per square unit area) became standardized and stabilized as a technical object, leading directly, and inevitably, to social pathology (a behavioral response). By examining this relationship, and continuously failing to generate pathology through their own research practices, they could counter a growing and unwanted design or architectural determinism among psychologists. Yet by stabilizing the crowd as a mere physical entity of limited significance, they were also able to emphasize the fundamental differences between rodents and people as organisms and thus to address an even greater danger: an emergent biological determinism that they believed inherent in ethological thinking. Through their intelligence, adaptability, and capacity to make the world around them, humans were capable of coping with crowding. As these sociologists developed their critique of crowding studies, Calhoun's perceived assumption that men were like rats became a point of attack, a means of tainting and stigmatizing the obsession with the crowd as dangerous in itself. Calhoun's initial and considerable influence among social scientists had made him a target; critics sought to denigrate crowding studies as driven by biological and behavioral reductionism and, as such, by a conservative, even reactionary, ideology.</p>

         <title>DECLARING WAR ON THE NORWAY RAT</title>
         <p>In 1942, a project to reduce the rat population of Baltimore was instigated at Johns Hopkins University—the disease and losses to stores of food inflicted by rodents being deemed more than usually problematic in a time of war.15 The Rodent Control Project's first director, Curt P. Richter, was renowned as an expert on the internal, spontaneous, and biologically determined rhythms of the rodent body. For Richter, physiologically motivated behavior ensured the internal stability of the organism in the face of environmental change. He had identified a “wisdom of the body” in the rat's selection of necessary nutrients: adrenalectomy prompted an increased intake of sodium chloride; removal of the parathyroid glands led to an increased intake of calcium. Having studied how homeostatic behavioral mechanisms ensured survival, he was now using them to poison the rodent body more effectively, and thus “war was declared on the Norway rat.”16</p>
         <p>In spite of Richter's successes, a rat population devastated by poisoning would quickly recover as a result of migration and high rates of fertility. Attention soon shifted from chemical to ecological control—controlling rats through controlling space—and, with it, from the individual cages of Richter's psychobiology laboratory to the “urban laboratories” of the ecologists John T. Emlen, Jr., and David E. Davis at the School of Hygiene and Public Health. Ecologists found that the number of rats could be reduced significantly by removing harborage, garbage, and access to water. In the view of Davis, who directed the renamed Rodent Ecology Project from 1946, rat populations were made up of aggressive individuals in competition, their hierarchy established through fighting. Reduced resources led to increased violence, “social pressure,” and “social strife,” as described by Davis's one-time student John J. Christian.17</p>
         <p>Here ecologists were contributing to a long-running debate in animal ecology over the existence of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms internal to a population that ensured that a species did not outstrip the resources required for subsistence. It was Christian who first suggested that “stress” might be the mechanism that served to regulate population density. Christian was drawing from the work of the physiologist Hans Selye, who had applied acute, nonspecific nocuous agents to rodent bodies—extreme cold, surgical injury, injections of sublethal doses of various drugs. All produced a typical “general adaptation syndrome”: the adrenal glands released hormones that maintained the homeostatic conditions of the body. Yet with prolonged stress metabolic changes became “diseases of adaptation.” As Christian showed, they increased mortality through hypertension, ulcers, and kidney and heart disease, while lowering reproduction by inhibiting gonadal function, lactation, and estrus. By altering the physical parameters in which a population existed, scientists, city planners, and public health officials enrolled the agency of the rat to limit rodent numbers.18</p>
         <p>Crucial to understanding the organization and behavior of the rat were the experiments of John B. Calhoun. Born in Elkton, Tennessee, on 11 May 1917, Calhoun describes having had continuously to subsidize his study of nature through trapping and collecting—initially for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, from which he graduated in 1939. In the Rodent Ecology Project, he was able to combine his considerable skills in the field with the theoretical perspective gained from his Ph.D. supervisor, Orlando Park, at Northwestern, and Warder C. Allee of Chicago, which privileged sociality, community, and cooperation among animals, and the methodology of the population biologist Raymond Pearl and his one-time student Thomas Park, who studied animals in enclosed environments.19 As a research assistant with the project from 1946 to 1949, Calhoun constructed a quarter-acre pen—a “Garden of Eden”—in the woodland behind his house in Towson, Maryland. In it he placed five pairs of wild Norway rats that had been captured on (the suitably named) Parsons Island, a 150-acre tract in Chesapeake Bay. Believing that he had created an ideal environment for rats, where the animals did not want for food, water, or nesting materials and were safe from predation and free of disease, he described the setup as a “rodent utopia.” The one thing they did lack, however, was space. As the community grew into a “rat city,” this became increasingly problematic. Dominant rats were able to secure territories in the corners of the pen, where they lived relatively normal lives with a “harem” of females. Crowding elsewhere prevented the emergence of dominance hierarchies, ensuring that the rats' lives were marked by constant violence, struggle, and disruption. Thus, it was Calhoun's rat city that allowed ecologists to observe directly, and for the first time, the potential of hierarchy, territoriality, and competition for reducing rat numbers.20 (See Figure 1.)<fig id="fg1" position="float">

         <p>Calhoun's experimental systems proved most successful—numerous scientists visited his rat city, and many more would request precise details, such as the number and type of animals to be used and the size, shape, and structure of his pens.21 Indeed, Calhoun's method of crowding rodents in an enclosed space continued to be used by Christian and Davis long after the termination of the Rodent Ecology Project in 1952. They were joined by a new generation of crowding researchers in ecology, who were similarly seeking to isolate the density-dependent mechanisms regulating population growth in a range of species: lemmings, snowshoe hares, voles, mice, deer, crabs, stickleback fish, cats, and even primates.22 However, Christian and Davis increasingly black-boxed crowding processes and behaviors—a common feature, Rheinberger argues, of successful systems that transform epistemic things into technical conditions. Their animals were simply “crowded”; their published papers merely documented the number of rodent bodies in a confined space before turning to detail the various physiological pathologies that resulted from stress—their scientific object.23 Calhoun, in contrast, continued to analyze and graphically represent the behavior of the organism and the structure of society, while carefully detailing the experimental architecture in which the animals were contained. In Calhoun's systems, the problem of crowding—of animal behavior in relation to space and numbers—was more than the technical means of analysis; it was the object of research.</p>
         <p>After moving to the NIMH psychology laboratories in 1954 (following a series of short-term posts), Calhoun continued his experiments, placing various numbers of Osborne-Mendel rats in various pens in a converted barn. He hoped to establish the level of density the rats could tolerate and the point at which their society was tipped into anarchy—moving from rat city to “rat slum.” In one particularly famous experiment, he divided this 10- x 14-foot “rodent universe” into four parts, connected by ramps, and again ensured “an always replete cafeteria … no epidemic disease, no famine.”24 He allowed the population to grow, this time to eighty adults. Once again, dominant rats, so-called “despots,” aristocrats,” or “king-pins,” established territories in which there was only one entrance, living in relative comfort with eight to ten females in the “high-rise apartments” provided. For the other sixty, crowded conditions were further exacerbated by a process Calhoun described as a “behavioral sink.” Because they were given hard food pellets, the animals spent long periods of time in the presence of others while eating. There emerged a “pathological togetherness,” animals becoming conditioned to seek each other out: “The unhealthy connotations of the term are not accidental: a behavioral sink does act to aggravate all forms of pathology that can be found within a group.” These forms included violence: Calhoun described males “going berserk, attacking females, juveniles, and less active males.” Among the subordinates, one group became “homosexual,” another hypersexual, while a further suffered such extreme withdrawal that they “moved through the community like somnambulists.”25 With males failing to protect nesting sites, the role was taken up by females, who then generalized this pattern of violence to their young.

         <p>Calhoun then studied the patterns of withdrawal in greater detail through long-running experiments in “mouse paradise.” Here a large group of BALB/c males took to huddling in a vacant mass on the floor. Fundamentally “de-stressed,” asexual, and nonaggressive, these animals were nicknamed “beautiful ones.” Well fed and well groomed, they looked like healthy mice. But this was because “they failed to remain mice,” no longer competing for status, territory, or females. They had ensured their physical survival, but at an immense psychological cost. So devastating was this form of withdrawal that Calhoun dubbed it the “ultimate pathology.” In the words of his research assistant: “Utopia had become hell.”26 (See Figure 3.)<fig id="fg3" position="float">

         <title>FROM RAT SLUM TO INHUMAN CITY</title>
         <p>We can identify some critical differences in the descriptions of crowding experiments offered by Calhoun and contemporary ecologists. Christian and Davis's analysis of rodent social structure and behavior extended as far as positing an aggregation of competing individuals, their aggression heightened by restricted resources. Calhoun was documenting a far greater range of social pathologies emerging from the structure of physical spaces. Further, while Calhoun had joined Christian and Davis in emphasizing caution in extrapolating to human populations, this was belied by his language.27 By the 1970s he had added further anthropomorphic terms to his list of behavioral anomalies: “pied pipers” described a group of females that followed objects obsessively; the withdrawn were “social dropouts,” “bar-flies,” and “autistics”; the hypersexual and excessively violent were “juvenile delinquents”; and aggressive females were “Amazons.” The rats' treatment of their young was akin to “child abuse” and “battery”: Calhoun described the shift from disciplining pups through “mild spankings” to their “murder” in acts of “berserk violence.”28 His apartment buildings and city blocks—vividly represented through written descriptions, drawings, and photographs—functioned as anthropomorphic spaces, serving to make their occupants seem more human. Against those who would characterize his rodent environments as “unnatural,” Calhoun argued that he was not addressing population processes among free-ranging animals so much as simulating mankind's future in vast, sprawling, “unnatural” urban environments.

         <p>Calhoun not only shared Allee's interest in the role of density in the development (and destruction) of cooperative animal communities. He also shared his concern to bridge the biological and social sciences, Allee having attempted (with limited success) to build connections between animal ecologists and the human ecologists of the “Chicago School” of sociology.29 For both schools, population density was a source of adaptation, evolution, and complexity and yet also posed a significant threat to social and psychological organization.30 For the sociologist Robert Park, density contributed to a division of labor and led to a rational and advanced “public”; for his mentor Georg Simmel and colleague Louis Wirth, the overload of interactions in the city encouraged social distance, anomie, loneliness, and even mental breakdown. Following his employment at the NIMH, Calhoun saw himself less as a student of natural ecological systems and more as a contributor to the debate over the well-being of urban man, even describing himself as having “rejected, though not lost sight of, my ‘father,’ the discipline of animal ecology.”31</p>
         <p>Calhoun's experience as a student of ecology, combined with his continued reading in the social sciences and humanities, led him to conclude that many social animals, including man, had become biologically adapted for life in a group of no more than twelve adults. Just as Simmel had argued, Calhoun noted, individual responses to encounters seemed to become “less intense or shallower as the size of the group increases.”32 While this behavior allowed individuals the resources to maintain their more intense and fulfilling relationships, as encounters become more meaningless and rejection more frequent there was a danger that aggression and withdrawal would be extended into the more intimate aspects of social life, becoming a “self-generating process.” Calhoun held that this process could be measured on a scale of “social velocity.” This scale was based on the degree of time an individual—whether a rat, a mouse, or a man—spent in places where interaction was likely: those with the highest social velocity scores were the dominant males and the best mothers; those with the lowest scores were so damaged by rejection that they lived in social isolation, even a “state of catatonic schizophrenia.”33</p>
         <p>Yet, as was consistent with sociological theory, not all elements of population density were “bad.” In Calhoun's rodent universes, social pressure and psychological disorganization resulted in adaptive and creative acts. In his view, even the development of “homosexuality represents a form of creativity.” By forming “another class outside the dominance hierarchy,” subordinate males could avoid sanctions from dominants while maintaining a relatively high social velocity. He was particularly taken by a group of “homosexual” males who, when digging their burrows, did not adopt the standard approach of carrying out small wads of dirt but instead packed it into a large ball that they then rolled out. Disorganization had resulted in increased efficiency. Among rats, limited as they were, this adaptation would not be taken up by dominants; among human beings, however, such creative breakthroughs could result in real social advances. This was what social scientists would describe as a dynamic density, leading to new social roles, new technological advances, and intellectual breakthroughs: <disp-quote>
               <p>If man is unique, it's the result of his ability to develop new ideas; yet perhaps these can only arise in a social milieu that represses him somewhat, leading to deviant behavior and a disorganization which allow him to re-organize in new ways after the social pressure has been withdrawn. … Human beings thus face a predicament: If we try to make everybody totally happy, we'll destroy mankind. So the criterion for mental health might include some happiness and frustration.34</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>In Calhoun's view, humankind had helped relieve some of the frustrations engendered by a decrease in physical space by constructing a new kind of space—a “conceptual space”—involving new social roles and methods of communication that allowed for the maintenance of gratifying social relations. Yet while humans had escaped the ecological laws that bound a population directly to its environment, there was a point of no return, where physical and conceptual space would be overwhelmed, self-destruction inevitable. Man needed to build on the benefits of high density, designing more efficient physical and social structures. With such adaptations would emerge a new sense of responsibility and compassion, leading to a decline in fertility without the need for implementing coercive and conservative restrictions limiting couples to two children, as advocated by the “zero population growth” movement.</p>
         <p>Calhoun transferred this interest in amelioration to the rodent laboratory; he was now directing his own Unit for Research on Behavioral Systems at the NIMH. Here the technical objects of his laboratory were further unpacked. When he altered the foodstuff from hard to soft pellets, he found that he reduced the time a rat spent in the presence of others, thereby preventing the emergence of the behavioral sink. He introduced more partitions, allowing for increased privacy, and created smaller subcommunities by determining which animals lived, slept, and ate together, thereby preventing the emergence of the “ultimate pathology.” (See Figure 5.)<fig id="fg5" position="float">

         <p>Calhoun's laboratory was increasingly reminiscent of that of the behaviorist.35 He experimented with operant conditioning, forcing rats to cooperate with one another to receive water, which he then interpreted in terms of the emergence of “trust” and “ethical behavior.” Beginning in 1984, each of his animals had a metal coil (passive resonator) implanted in its skin, so that its every movement could be detected, recorded, and controlled as it passed through electronic portals in the pen.36 Through this rather Orwellian modification Calhoun was attempting to develop ever more advanced rodent communities that were able to withstand increased population density. Many saw his work as the inspiration for <italic>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</italic>, a children's novel in which a group of rats and mice escape an experiment that endows them with high intelligence and go on to build their own (ecologically sustainable) community.37 Calhoun encouraged such a connection. As pessimistic as his simulation of mankind's future may have seemed, it was one he sought to temper with optimism. His interest in providing solutions would, however, be lost on the public imagination, as his experiments came to stand for all that was wrong with the crowd.</p>

         <p>The power of Calhoun's representations of urban animals in urban spaces can be seen from the breadth of interest in his research—from social and biological scientists, medical, planning, and design professionals, writers, filmmakers, and religious and political leaders. We may find Calhoun's language overly dramatic, yet it was often surpassed by those referring to his studies. The British biologist A. S. Parkes described Calhoun's rats in terms of “unmaternal mothers, homosexuals and zombies”; the writer-cum-ethologist Robert Ardrey saw “an essentially criminal class,” roaming in “gangs”; the psychologist Jonathan Freedman portrayed “apathetic street fighters,” “marauders and recluses.” For Carl Rogers, “The resemblance to human behavior is frightening. In humans we see poor family relationships, the lack of caring, the complete alienation, the magnetic attraction of overcrowding, the lack of involvement which is so great that it permits people to watch a long drawn out murder without so much as calling the police—perhaps all city dwellers are inhabitants of a behavioral sink, cannibalism and all.”38</p>
         <p>The murder was that of Kitty Genovese in Queens in 1964. It had been the subject of intense public debate because of the failure of any of the thirty-eight witnesses to contact the police, let alone intervene. The attention given to the murder reflected a growing concern over the well-being of the American city, with its social and sexual deviance, growing drug culture, increasingly visible gay community, and “free love” movement. The violence that had erupted during demonstrations against the Vietnam War was dwarfed by a rising tide of urban rioting, the most famous being the five-day Watts riot in 1965 that left thirty-four people dead and more than a thousand injured. Given the apparent violence and apathy of the urban resident, we can see why the lesson offered by the behavior of Calhoun's rats and mice was so appealing. One might see criminality and delinquency among his young males, the breakdown of the family among his unmaternal mothers, a drop-out drug culture among his “beautiful ones.” Calhoun's influence was far from “curious.” Within the rodent universe, the ills of the city were explained by the very variable that gave it definition—its population; the problem of the city was, in a sense, the city itself.</p>
         <p>Particularly significant to this success was Calhoun's experimental subject. As Richard Burkhardt has explored in his historical study of ethology, the choice of animal is a powerful means of transmitting a message.39 Konrad Lorenz promoted the idea that aggression was an instinct present in all animals, describing an accidental “experiment” in which he placed two doves in a cage. Expecting that they would mate, he returned to find that one, a female ringdove, had nearly pecked its suitor, a male turtledove, to death. For Lorenz, the message was clear: the dove had not evolved innate inhibitions to violence, as had animals with more powerful weapons of destruction such as the wolf or the lion. In using the dove, the symbol of peace, he was drawing on shared cultural capital: if the dove was capable of such destruction, what of man?</p>
         <p>The message conveyed by the rat was no less powerful. Drawing on Lorenz's work, Anthony Storr argued that, apart from the rodent, man was the only vertebrate that “habitually destroys members of its own species.” Rats have also been associated with vice, sexuality, and fertility, with thieving, rapacity, disease, defilement, and dirt; at times they have seemed “to represent evil itself.” They are also synonymous with the city: not only do they thrive in areas most dense and degraded, such as the ghetto and the slum; they are also associated with the day-to-day stresses of the elite, with the “rat race”—the modern colloquial term for an “urban working life regarded as an unremitting struggle for wealth, status.” Even their positive qualities—adaptability and intelligence—have destructive consequences. Like man, they increase their numbers to plague-like proportions. In the words of Jonathan Burt: “Because the rat is so bound up with ideas of mass and number it seems to be a totemic animal for the modern world.”40 Considering this long association between the rat, pathology, population, and the city, it is perhaps unsurprising that so many referenced Calhoun's work, rather than the numerous other studies of voles, mice, deer, or snowshoe hares.</p>
         <p>Lorenz's dove experiment had revealed another innate pattern of behavior shared and expressed by animals— the need for territory and space. With increased density, territorial boundaries were more likely to be transgressed and the social behaviors that maintained them overwhelmed. Paul Leyhausen described how, when cats were crowded together in a cage, “the community turns into a spiteful mob.” Yet, as Leyhausen argued, it was Calhoun who had made “the really important contributions in this field,” moving beyond violence to address neglect, indifference, apathy. Calhoun reinforced and extended ethological concerns with the problems of modernity, and his work was used to great effect in the popularizations of Robert Ardrey and Desmond Morris: “Each kind of animal has evolved to exist in a certain amount of living space. In both the animal and the human zoo this space is severely curtailed and the consequences can be serious.”41</p>
         <p>As attractive as the crowd was in its simplicity as a cause, how did one provide a solution? Many were drawn to the <italic>habitat</italic> of Calhoun's rats. The Kerner Commission, established to examine the causes of urban rioting, identified, among many variables, “crowded ghetto living conditions, worsened by summer heat.” The failure of government to approve a rat extermination program, let alone improve housing, only reinforced concern at its apparent disregard for those that suffered from urban blight. Indeed, for David Davis, rodent control had long suggested a solution. The most effective method of rat-proofing was to eradicate slum housing: <disp-quote>
               <p>The beauty of this ecological method of control is that it improves the housing and living conditions of the human population, in addition to reducing the rat population … replacing dilapidated unsanitary structures with clean, modern, substantial ones. … When whole blocks of tenements were razed on Manhattan's East Side to make room for Stuyvesant Town, the rat population was reduced by many thousands. The same may be said of the numerous other replacements of slums with modern apartment developments.42</p>
            </disp-quote> Stuyvesant Town, a large private modernist residential development in Manhattan, admitted its first residents in 1947. By the early 1950s, it was proving a successful (if controversial) venture, bringing order to a once impoverished area. With the construction of Stuyvesant's large apartment complexes, unwanted residents—rodent and human—were driven out.43 Members of the Rodent Ecology Project saw how their research addressed problems of human ecology directly—that the methods of wildlife management applied to the city would remedy more than just the vermin problem.44</p>
         <p>For Calhoun, however, Stuyvesant Town was an anathema. In the ensuing debate between the project's champion, Robert Moses, and one of its most famed critics, Lewis Mumford, Calhoun expressed sympathy for the latter.45 Yet Calhoun also noted that Mumford lacked the empirical data he needed to promote smaller cities with spacious green parks as opposed to a high-density megalopolis. This Calhoun would provide through his rat cities. By the early 1970s, when it seemed clear that urban problems were only exacerbated by the construction of modern public housing projects, many turned to Calhoun's experiments. Referring to the infamous Pruitt-Igoe development in St. Louis, the sociologist A. R. Gillis described how “social conditions in the project deteriorated to a level close to Calhoun's (1962) description of a ‘behavioral sink.’ The level of disorganization and conflict was sufficient to produce the Spinks brothers, outstanding in their boxing skills and motor offences.”46</p>
         <p>Others focused on the problem of rodent <italic>numbers</italic>, seeing the effects of population growth in the animals' aberrant behavior. The scientist and planner Richard Meier, noting the consequences of overcrowding witnessed among animals, suggested that the “last great plague of the cities can be productively viewed as an epidemic of violence.” An associate of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Meier was a leader in assessing and publicizing the detrimental impact of population growth on the well-being of individuals and society. Calhoun's rats made regular appearances in the propaganda materials of the birth control movement: the association between excessive fertility and family breakdown was there for all to see in the crowded rodent pens. Reducing the level of unwanted pregnancies among poor and black mothers, birth control advocates argued, was a significant preventative health and welfare measure.47</p>

         <title>NEGOTIATING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN RODENTS AND MAN</title>
         <p>In an era that saw the rapid rise of the environmentalist and population control movements, Calhoun's results justified the belief that population growth was dangerous, the city a perversion of nature. Yet, considering the importance attributed to the crowd, where was the research among human beings? Demands that the social scientist focus attention on the problems of numbers and space were becoming more frequent and were increasingly justified through reference to animal studies. The psychologist Wayne Bartz declared: “Personally, I feel like an impotent observer standing on the deck of the Titanic as it sails toward destruction. … I suspect that the population biologists are correct in their pessimistic predictions; the human community is not going to be willing to recognize the enormity of the problem until it is too late.”48</p>
         <p>Bartz's concerns were shared by an emerging community of environmental psychologists in the 1960s. Irwin Altman described its members as either older, peripheral social psychologists or recent Ph.D.'s. They were united by a perception of a social psychology in “crisis,” its methodology geared toward generating precise, basic, and general properties of human behavior. As a result, they were failing to contribute to the resolution of real, lived problems at a time of great social and political turbulence. They focused their attention on the problem of the crowd, attracted to the possibility of a simple, physical, and objectively measurable variable with significant consequences that demanded a policy response.49 With the challenge set by Calhoun, there was an opportunity for the resolution of real world issues—ecological destruction, population growth, mental health problems in the city—and, in the process, for innovative research and disciplinary development focused on <italic>physical</italic> phenomena.</p>
         <p>Similarly, the sociologist William Michelson declared that “these rat experiments gave some clue as to the social concomitants of the physical pathologies observed in previous behavioral sinks. … With these findings as incentive, one might well imagine a groundswell of activity among human ecologists to apply this perspective to human life.” There was now an opportunity of reinvigorating and reorienting the field of human ecology, correcting the failures of the interwar pioneers who, with their near-exclusive focus on the social, had “left the study of these crucial phenomena behind them in the dust.”50</p>
         <p>The first studies, beginning in the late 1960s, applied and reinvigorated more traditional methods: statistical data collected through censuses and surveys in such cities as Hong Kong, Honolulu, New York, and, of course, Chicago. The influence of Calhoun was explicit, a group of urban sociologists declaring: “We … take the animal studies as a serious model for human populations.”51 They began to correlate measures of urban density with social pathologies seen to match those exhibited by Calhoun's rats: aggression was to be measured by crime and delinquency, withdrawal by admissions to mental hospitals, sexual deviance not only by sexual assault but also by divorce, and, most controversially, the breakdown in maternal behavior by the need for welfare measures, such as a family's acceptance of Aid for Dependent Children.52</p>
         <p>Such sociological approaches were soon joined by those of the psychologist. Edward Pohlman suggested: “Animal studies of population density (e.g., Calhoun, 1962) provide possibilities for experimental approaches.” These possibilities were first realized by the psychologist Jonathan Freedman in the late 1960s at the behest of Paul Ehrlich, his colleague at Stanford and a leading population control activist. With a number of collaborators, Freedman employed high school and university students to carry out a series of tasks in different-sized rooms, while keeping the size of the group constant.53 He sought to measure objectively the effect of varying degrees of density on behavior and to document increased instances of aggression and competitiveness.</p>
         <p>The results were inconsistent, however. Some studies did reveal positive correlations between density and pathology, such as in R. C. Schmitt's study of Honolulu. Yet Schmitt's study of Hong Kong did not.54 There was even evidence that the more crowded a city, the lower its rates of morbidity and the higher its fertility—the opposite of what had been predicted by the so-called “rodent model.”55 In Freedman's laboratory there were few instances of stress, aggression, and withdrawal and none of people “going berserk.” As a consequence, some began to express doubts as to how well the pathologies of Calhoun's rats translated to the behavior of urban man. Others reflected further on the concepts of density and crowding.</p>
         <p>The psychologist Daniel Stokols explained how “animal studies portray crowding as a stress situation,” a situation determined by the physical condition of spatial limitation: “As population density increases, spatial constraints become more acute until, finally, they eventuate in social disorganization and physiological pathology.” Nevertheless, in the human situation, it had become clear that “spatial restriction serves as a necessary antecedent of, but not always a sufficient condition for, the arousal of crowding stress.” Stokols suggested that it was necessary to differentiate between density—a physical measure involving the limitation of space—and crowding—an individual's perception of having too little space. With this focus on perception, some observed that making a direct link between rats and man was now difficult: “We know very little about what constitutes crowding in the eyes—or noses or whiskers—of rodents.” Density was a technical object, crowding the epistemic thing of interest to the psychologist—a truly individual, psychological, and experiential phenomenon, and a negative one at that. While density was a “stressor situation,” crowding was a “stress syndrome” mediated by a range of other social and psychological variables that were often unique to human beings.56 The role of the psychologist was now to explore this process of mediation.</p>
         <p>A wider range of variables were now included: an individual's life history, gender, age, class, social interests and roles, and relations to others present. However, three approaches dominated. Stanley Milgram at CUNY revived the theory of “stimulus overload” developed by Simmel and Wirth: with the complexity and excess of environmental inputs in the city, according to this theory, individuals cannot process all the information and interact meaningfully with all social contacts. As a result, they are forced to withdraw. To do so selectively, and thus successfully, is costly, resulting in superficial relationships and norms legitimizing noninvolvement. To fail to do so is even more costly, resulting in indiscriminate aggression, withdrawal, and stress-related illness. The second approach focused on man's inherent need for personal space and privacy and, while drawing on ethological concepts of territoriality, emphasized the role of various personal and cultural factors. Finally, a so-called “behavioral constraint” model proposed that crowding is a situation in which the presence of others places restrictions on an individual's range of personal freedoms and choices.57 What united these perspectives was the notion of control. The more power an individual had over the social and physical environment, the less likely he or she was to experience crowding stress.</p>
         <p>Environmental psychologists were contributing to new approaches in the understanding of stress. Led in the late 1960s by Richard Lazarus, a key figure in the so-called “cognitive turn” in psychology, the focus was shifting from the “stress state” to the process of “coping”: researchers were trying to understand how various stressors are negotiated by the individual in specific environments. Lazarus interpreted this shift in the context of a move away from simplistic animal models: “Thus, from Calhoun's work … [we] begin with a simple S-R model, namely, that crowding is an environmental stressor producing disruption of the social fabric and a high rate of mortality. … As we shift to the human context, we begin to realize that psychosocial mediation determines when moderate to high population density will be reacted to as crowding and so can be thought of as an environmental stressor.”58</p>
         <p>For those seeking to emphasize this shift, it was still common to begin with a discussion (albeit a brief one) of Calhoun's research—a dramatic means of securing the reader's attention. With the distinction drawn between density and crowding, however, it was now possible “to view crowding under a new light.” Unlike earlier models that assumed a general behavioral malaise to follow directly from increased density, this distinction brought hope: <disp-quote>
               <p>A second function of the distinction between density and crowding was to lift somewhat the doom created by the realization that the population was expanding but that space was not. … Since “they aren't making more land,” the only way to reduce crowding would be to reduce the number of people. … However, if crowding is only the distant cousin rather than the Siamese twin of density, it may be possible to reduce the experience of crowding without increasing space.59</p>

         <title>TURNING TO THE MODEL ENVIRONMENT</title>
         <p>With the development of the crowding construct, a boundary between rats and man was reinforced. Nevertheless, social scientists were concerned not to lose sight of the key environmental variables identified in Calhoun's work. Just because crowding was a “subjective state,” this did not mean that they should ignore density as the material and “objective condition.”60 Going too far in emphasizing personal factors could direct attention away from significant physical factors that resulted in common experiences across individuals and groups. Density may not have been the “Siamese twin” of crowding, but it was not as far removed as a “distant cousin.” To understand its relevance, however, it was necessary to refine it as a concept and measure: What, exactly, did density consist of?</p>
         <p>Environmental psychologists and human ecologists now made a further differentiation: physical density was the amount of space per person, social density the numbers of individuals in a given space. The latter was deemed more significant, as overwhelming social density resulted in unwanted interactions whose effects were particularly damaging in so-called “primary” environments where individuals spent the majority of their lives and in which “personal” encounters took place.61 The focus of crowding studies was changing, moving away from simplistic studies of census and laboratory to the household, the prison, the hospital. It was in these places, these “pseudo-laboratories” or “quasi-experiments,” where researchers found people crowded for long periods of time, often against their will.62 Here density was a real, lived problem, and its component parts could be controlled and analyzed by the researcher, just as in Calhoun's pens.</p>
         <p>In 1973 Andrew Baum and Stuart Valins began a series of influential studies of the college dormitory. Combining perusal of institutional records, interviews, observation, and physical examination, they revealed a “consistent and disturbing picture of the dynamics of corridor dormitory life.” In the corridor environment, thirty-four individuals shared washroom and lounge areas. Because of the uncontrolled space of the corridor and high social density, individuals would continually “collide.”63 As a consequence of this unwanted and uncontrollable interaction, students perceived the environment as crowded and exhibited increased stress levels. While they did not go “berserk,” conditions did affect health and academic success. This was in contrast to the experience of students housed in an alternative “suite-style” dorm, who were divided up into subcommunities of four to six. As a consequence of being able to control the number and nature of their interactions, these students did not experience crowding and had generally good relations with their peers. Interestingly, the physical density of the two environments was almost identical.</p>
         <p>A study of the prison environment soon followed, directed by Paul Paulus at the University of Texas at Arlington. Here researchers found crowded conditions that were “intense, prolonged, inescapable, and realistic.” Working closely with Baum, now at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, they found correlations between crowding and “increased suicides, psychiatric commitments, disciplinary infractions, violent deaths, and deaths due to natural causes.” As numbers (social density) were again more important than space (physical density), they recommended more single cells, even at the cost of reducing the amount of space per person, so as to avoid moving individuals into dormitories to meet simplistic space-per-person standards.64</p>
         <p>Thanks to the distinction between physical and social density, crowding was retained as a scientific object of immense significance to human health. Solutions were also provided through the control of environmental conditions: “While we may not be able to control population growth at zero level or we may not be able to eliminate high-density situations, we may be able to … minimize psychological and physiological costs.” Baum and Paulus were realizing the aims of environmental psychology, becoming increasingly engaged in policy issues surrounding the effects of the built environment. Recommendations for dormitory design were taken up by colleges, and new standards of housing and public health were introduced following a series of well-publicized legal cases involving prison overcrowding.65</p>
         <p>These researchers were also united in giving credit to Calhoun as a source of inspiration, Paulus describing the work of environmental psychologists as having been “stimulated by Calhoun's (1962) widely publicized studies with rodents showing a variety of deleterious effects of crowding.”66 Yet they did more than this. Unlike the authors of earlier statistical and laboratory studies, they recognized that Calhoun's object of concern was not simply the effects of density in a physical sense, as number of individuals per square unit area. He was concerned with degrees of social interaction and “social velocity”—which were open to manipulation.67 Those who had interpreted Calhoun's systems as a simplistic matter of a stressor stimulus leading directly to a stress response, devoid of mediatory factors, were mistaken: space, as both a real physical entity and a social product, mediated between density and pathology. Baum and Paulus often collaborated with psychologists who had experience working with laboratory animals and thus were better placed to interpret the intricacies of Calhoun's complex systems.68 By focusing attention on the details of Calhoun's model environments, as scientific as well as technical objects, they saw constructive solutions to the crowding problem. While adopting his theories about the unique power of man's “intellectual skills” and “conceptual space” in coping with density, they also recognized, more importantly, that not all of Calhoun's rats had suffered from crowding stress. Those that had some control over space and interaction—the despots and their harems—led relatively normal lives, in direct contrast to their subordinates.69 Psychologists had, like Calhoun, divided their experimental universes into compartments, reducing frustration and increasing gratifying social encounters. In both the rodent laboratory and human society, the key was control; the method was more effective design of physical spaces to limit unwanted interaction.</p>
         <p>Calhoun had acted as an advisor for Baum's research and had encouraged this perspective. Baum, in turn, encouraged others to think of Calhoun's experiments in this light. In a textbook on environmental psychology, Baum and his colleagues not only asked of the student: “Can you think of any areas in the human environment that would qualify as ‘behavioral sinks’?” but also, “Can you think of a similar means of eliminating the human behavioral sinks you thought of earlier?”70 For Calhoun: “no single area of intellectual effort can exert a greater influence on human welfare than that contributing to better design of the built environment.” And, considering man's unique ability to build, design, and control, the future was marked by “hope rather than darkness.”71</p>

      <sec id="sc7">
         <title>SAVING SCIENCE AND THE CITY FROM THE CROWD</title>
         <p>Psychologists had shifted attention away from the psychological laboratory and the statistical measurement of neighborhoods and cities. It was in the nation's prisons, hospitals, homes, and schools where the effects of social density were most keenly felt—situations of “real world” crowding, consistent with those experienced by Calhoun's rats and mice. It was in the institution that change was most easily effected through design and results assessed and circulated; what Kohler describes as a “hybrid space,” the institution allowed for a synthesis of the objectivity of the laboratory with the reality of the field. However, as these psychologists made clear, their gaze had never shifted from the city—the site where Calhoun's work had the most immediate impact, where it had first captured the imagination of scientists and the public. Valins and Baum reflected: “the corridor-design dormitories represent overloaded social environments, very much like cities.”72 Yet the city was also the site where extrapolations from Calhoun's work encountered most resistance.</p>
         <p>With the city in mind, Freedman described how he had expected to find that crowding in the laboratory would be “very stressful” and “produce tension.” In contrast to such a “familiar naive assumption,” the researchers had instead found themselves “startled” by their results. Freedman quickly turned these results to his advantage, developing a density-intensity model in which crowding intensified existing emotional states, both negative and positive. While population growth was a problem, the city could provide a solution: concentration protected the environment from suburban sprawl, generated social and technological advances, and increased efficiency. He concluded his influential book on the crowd with an optimistic chapter, “In Praise of Cities,” in which he declared that “ethologists are wrong about crowding”: “As the population of the world increases, there will not be an increase in aggressiveness and antisocial behavior and a general breakdown in society. Homo sapiens is not doomed to extinction because of population density; the race will not destroy itself simply because it will be crowded.”73</p>
         <p>Others went further, criticizing the very fixation of social scientists on the problem of the crowd: “Foremost, this is because research on animals reported dramatic behavioral problems and illnesses among caged, crowded populations.”74 In the view of the urban sociologist Mark Baldassare, the theories and methods of the social sciences had been abandoned in favor of a simplistic model: “crowding leads to stress, which leads inevitably to pathology.” The argument was one of crude analogy: the crowded human was “like” a crowded rat. For Baldassare and his fellow sociologists: “loose analogies drawn from animal behavior will simply not do. Unfortunately, Calhoun's rats are pulling a fast-moving bandwagon. Many scientists have jumped on this bandwagon, and, with few exceptions …, left proper theoretical and scientific procedure behind.”75</p>
         <p>While they credited exceptions (such as Stokols) for providing much needed theoretical sophistication, they were concerned that the crowding construct continued to define a fundamentally pathological state. Baldassare, like Freedman, did not avail himself of the distinction between density and crowding. As Freedman argued, retaining crowding as a simple, physical variable, as “amount of space per person,” was “more basic and more interesting. Once people feel crowded, virtually by definition this is a negative state, and, presumably, they will respond in ways people always respond to negative states. As far as I can tell, there is nothing that distinguishes this negative emotional state from others, and, therefore, it is not of special interest to the environmental psychologist.”76</p>
         <p>As Rheinberger argues, the technical conditions of an experimental practice determine the possible range of representations. By paying individuals to accomplish tasks in relatively “crowded” rooms for short periods of time, Freedman had generated data that questioned the positive correlation between density and pathology. This made his research attractive to Baldassare and his collaborators, in spite of its positivistic naïveté, and they drew on Freedman's results to challenge the obsession with the crowd <italic>per se</italic>. By using similarly simplistic definitions of crowding and density in their own household studies, they were able to declare the ill-effects of high density to be “trivial.”77</p>
         <p>Baldassare was challenging what he considered to be the twin threats to sociological explanations of urban living—design determinism and ethological determinism—both of which reflected the unwanted influence of animal experiments. The claim by psychologists and designers that physical spaces had the power both to create and to ameliorate crowding stress was, declared Baldassare, “overstated.” Spaces were not “active agents in determining social behaviors and attitudes.” Rather, places were imbued with significant meaning only through the ideas, lives, and actions of the people that inhabited them. Social networks and communities were more significant than the physical environment, as the sociologist Claude Fischer argued: “the small, social worlds within which people live are so resilient and powerful as to be largely impervious to factors like size and density… there are <italic>no</italic> psychological consequences of urbanization.”78 By failing to identify density-dependent pathology, they sought to stabilize crowding as a technical object—a straightforward physical entity producing predictable results of limited significance.</p>
         <p>With this stabilization, the explanation for the differing behaviors among animals and man now shifted to the experimental subject. Given that there were few instances of humans “going berserk,” it seemed that man reacted differently to crowding than did the rat or mouse. Where pathologies did exist, they were trivial and determined by more significant social variables, such as power differentials, poverty, and discrimination. Crowding was one of many physical variables that humans adapted to in their day-to-day lives, often with positive consequences. The human being was not, as the ethologists would have it, a passive victim of density, but a conscious, rational, active, social animal, well adapted to life in the crowd.</p>
         <p>While Fischer and Baldassare sought to promote a sociological understanding of urban life at the expense of the ecological and psychological picture, what they shared with Freedman was a concern to counter those determined, in the words of Jane Jacobs, “to do the city in.” Reclaiming the positive elements of the sociology of Park and Simmel, Baldassare argued that selective withdrawal in public spaces allowed for the maintenance of close, fulfilling relationships that were often more meaningful in the city—based as they were on shared interests and concerns. Criticism of crowding research was combined with a new “sub-cultural” theory. For Fischer, higher rates of “deviance and disorganization” were not the direct result of crowding but, rather, of the congregation of large numbers of people, “critical masses” that allowed for the development of deviant subcultures. While these cultures might often seem to express “immoral” behaviors, such as sexual deviancy, drug use, and violence, they also contributed creativity, community, and solidarity. As the “evil” of urbanism was balanced by the “good,” it was necessary to “live with the irony that the blessings of urban life perhaps cannot be achieved without also accepting some of its curses.”79</p>
         <p>As we have seen, Calhoun would not have objected. He accepted that human beings, as <italic>both</italic> biological and cultural animals, had continuously adapted to density, exhibiting and spurring innovation, creativity, new social roles, and technological advances. However, this more complicated message was generally ignored; most of those critical of the influence of animal ecology and ethology focused solely on his more popular paper in <italic>Scientific American</italic>. In their criticisms, the arguments of Calhoun were combined with those of more radical ethologists whose animal studies were increasingly conceived as a considerable threat to social scientific understanding of human behavior and institutions.80 For Fischer, the “Territorial Animal” of Ardrey and Lorenz lay behind Calhoun's “extrapolations from rat pens to cities.”81 He declared, with Baldassare: “A red-eyed, sharp-fanged obsession about urban life stalks contemporary thought.”82 This was an obsession that needed to be repelled, based as it was on an inherently pessimistic biological view “that density is inevitably a problem and that the only solution to crowding is to uncrowd.” Similarly, for those critical of policies targeting the high fertility of poor and minority groups, Calhoun's influence was a point of attack. David Kleinman described how Freedman had shown that “population had little to do with humanity's ills.” Concern with density was “largely a reflection of the well articulated disquietude of elites. This concern often is a boon to many political leaders who then attribute the lack of progress in improving social welfare to fertility behavior.”83</p>
         <p>Calhoun's influence, they argued, was turning attention away from the real problem of the city, the real object of investigation for the social scientist: power differentials between social and racial groups. For Baldassare, space was a “resource”; those with power over it were able “to conduct desired activities with less interference, while less power would lead to more interruptions and the inability to conduct preferred activities.”84 The role of the social scientist was to aid in the empowerment of the urban poor, not blame them for their high fertility or collude in the tweaking of architectural design to ameliorate the symptoms of their subordination. That not all of Calhoun's rats suffered from crowding stress because they were given increased control over their space was disregarded—or, if recognized, was rarely an insight attributed to Calhoun himself.85 As the social and intellectual focus shifted in the 1980s, away from the dangers of the crowded city toward the monotony and isolation of the suburbs, and away from fear of the population explosion to concern with the so-called “birth dearth,” critical treatments of Calhoun's experiments only intensified—they came to be used as shorthand for the “myth” of the evils of population density.86 Having once embodied all that was wrong with urban life, Calhoun's rats now reflected a far greater danger: mankind's enduring obsession with the menace of the crowd.</p>

         <title>CONCLUSION</title>
         <p>From the 1960s, a group of psychologists and sociologists concerned with real world problems and disillusioned with the methods and theories of their parent disciplines turned to a series of rat experiments for solutions. This was a generation for whom the city seemed to be in trouble. Diagnoses of urban discontent led to intense deliberation over the composition and definition of the city. Physical variables seemed crucial: the city comprises large numbers of persons, big buildings, busy streets, noise, pace, stress, and, above all, perhaps, the “whirl of the crowd.”87 Given the concern over the impact of such intense social and physical stimuli, coupled with broader fears pertaining to population growth and ecological destruction, we can see how the intellectual climate was well suited to receiving Calhoun's work.</p>
         <p>What Calhoun's experiments provided was a near-perfect correlation of parts, the “right tools for the job” of creating and representing the problem of the crowd.88 He had generated, in experiments using a quintessentially urban animal, a wide range of pathologies deemed all too present in the city—violence, apathy, narcissism, and sexual depravity; he was invigorating older sociological and sanitarian treatments of the city that depicted its structures and institutions as disorganized, deviant, or “sick”; with the “behavioral sink,” the social and the physical were united in a concept that vividly presented the city as a cess-pit, or a drain, in which the dregs of humanity were collected, their pathologies exacerbated. He also provided, through the measure of density, a quantifiable, replicable, and controllable quality that had real and important effects—one that seemed easy to translate from the rodent laboratory to the human world. For those concerned with realizing change through the application of social and behavioral science, Calhoun's work was understandably attractive. This was what previous generations had missed: in always privileging social relationships, organizations, and norms they had forgotten that all that was social was physically grounded and physically expressed. The significance of Calhoun's work for social thought was unquestionable; where there was disagreement was over whether this was to the benefit or the detriment of science and policy.</p>
         <p>As not only ideas but also experimental systems were translated from the animal laboratory to the social world, we can see how Calhoun's objects and material practices continued to influence the degree to which crowding among human beings was constituted as a problem. When adapting Calhoun's systems to human populations, researchers faced obvious ethical restrictions: they could not place human beings in a confined space and breed them to extinction. They therefore devised strategies to uncover processes of crowding in situations faced by human beings that were deemed analogous to those seen in Calhoun's rats and mice. The practicalities of these adaptations determined results, theories, and concerns; in turn, the choice of practice reflected broader social interests.</p>
         <p>The first studies to follow from Calhoun were certainly simplistic. When authors spoke of a “model” provided through animal studies, they were merely seeking to map rodent pathologies onto human laboratory subjects and statistical data, justifying social and scientific interest in the problems of space and numbers. Inconsistent results did not lead to the abandonment of Calhoun's systems, but to further reflection over their structure and meaning. Social scientists began to examine the objects of Calhoun's systems more closely—the distinctions made between, and the significance granted to, his model organisms or his model environments proving crucial to the perception of crowding as either a stable technical object of minor concern or an epistemic object of considerable import.</p>
         <p>By differentiating between density as a physical measure and crowding as an experiential phenomenon, social scientists distinguished between rodents and man while maintaining a focus on the pathology of the crowd. By further differentiating between physical and social density, they established how unwanted social interaction and crowding stress could be created and ameliorated through alterations in the physical environment. For an emerging community of environmental psychologists, Calhoun's experimental architecture was not simply a technical condition but the very target of inquiry; its power was observable and measurable in model environments “analogous to those present in the behavioral sink.”89 Policy applications were also realized, as few would declare that increased numbers in institutions aided healing, education, or rehabilitation. In the hospital, school, or prison, it seemed clear that crowding caused problems.</p>
         <p>The city was a different matter. Urban sociologists, in particular, sought to defend and understand it through the study and application of fundamentally sociological theories and variables. In spite of the increased sophistication of crowding studies, Calhoun's systems were interpreted in terms that were utterly simplistic, even naive: density was held to lead directly and inevitably to pathology, irrespective of the ordering of experimental architecture, social structure, new social roles, adaptations, and advances in response to high density. Certainly, sociologists were justified in looking beyond animal experiments for inspiration: stimulus overload, selective withdrawal, and power relations in relation to space and numbers have been of long-standing interest to social scientists.90 What is striking, however, is the degree to which critics sought to charge Calhoun with a failure to examine these elements and then to use that failure to draw points of distinction between crowded rodents and man. In disavowing the distinction between density and crowding—and thus continuing to generate data that questioned the premise that increasing the concentration of individuals caused them to “go berserk”—they were able to promote a more positive vision of man's future in an urban world. Thus, by defining crowding <italic>as</italic> density, stabilizing it as a crude physical and predictable technical object of limited importance, Calhoun was more effectively denied. The cause of differing responses to density could then be explained only by fundamental differences between humans and other animals. Continued references to Calhoun reveal the degree to which he now served as a point of attack. The work of those fearful of the crowd was not only flawed because of its dependence on Calhoun's rodent studies; it was dangerous, for perceiving the urban masses as aggressive, pathetic, and deviant animals—as uncultured rats—would only reinforce their treatment as such.</p>
