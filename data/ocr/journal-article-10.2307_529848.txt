<plain_text><page sequence="1">23 Architecture and Symbolism in Transitional Pueblo Development in the Mimbres Valley, sw New Mexico Harry J. Shafer Texas A&amp;M University College Station, Texas Data from the NAN Ruin in the Mimbres Valley, sw New Mexico, are used to trace ar- chitectural changes from pithouse to pueblo. These changes co-occur with changes in hearth type, storage practices, mortuary custom, and ceramic style. The architectural changes are traced from extended-entrance pithouses, a transition of modified pithouses beginning in the early 10th century A.C., to sunken floor rooms with cobble-adobe wall construction, and ending with surface pueblos of the Classic Mimbres Period in the early 11th century. Taxonomically, the period in question has been labeled the Mangas phase, and a critique of the concept is presented. The architectural changes have been linked to a greater reliance on agriculture and changing storage practices brought about by popu- lation increase. The shift to ceiling hatchways, slab-lined hearths, and sub-floor burials, however, are changes that may be linked to symbolic expressions of the multi-layered universe and passage to the Otherworld, a cosmology common not only throughout the Puebloan and Mesoamerican areas, but traceable back to the Chihuahuan Desert Archaic. Introduction Most scenarios in the Mogollon region of the American Southwest imply an abrupt change from pit houses to cobble-adobe, pueblo-style architecture in the late Three Circle Phase between A.C. 900 and 1000 (Anyon, Gilman, and LeBlanc 1981; Gilman 1980; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 187-192; LeBlanc 1983: 75-88). To the contrary, using the recently acquired data from the NAN Ruin, a large Mimbres pithouse/pueblo community in the Mim- bres Valley Grant County, New Mexico (Shafer 1990, 1991a, 1991b, 1991d; Shafer and Taylor 1986) (FIGS. 1,2), it appears that the process, once started in the early 10th century (about A.C. 900 if not earlier), took at least a century to complete. This architectural shift marked sig- nificant changes in Mimbres community organization and ritual behavior. Excavations at the NAN Ruin were conducted by Texas A&amp;M University under the direction of the author from 1978 to 1989 (Shafer 1990, 1991a, 1991b). Initial occu- pation at the site occurred in the Georgetown phase (An- yon, Gilman, and LeBlanc 1981) and ended with the final pueblo abandonment at the end of the Classic Mimbres phase about A.C. 1130. This paper presents the architectural evidence of transi- tional pueblo development at NAN Ruin. Changes in the basic house design are correlated with changes in the interior features such as hearth type, entrance location, and mortuary customs, as well as ceramic style variability. Shifts in house design and space use have been explained by Patricia Gilman (1983, 1987) as systemic changes in tech- nology commensurate with agricultural intensification. In addition, I argue that changes in house design, mortuary practices, and ceramic style also can be correlated with changes in the material expression of Mimbres symbolism and cosmology. The pithouse to pueblo transition at the NAN Ruin began sometime in the early or mid-900s when residents blocked the extended lateral entrances and added ventila- tor shafts and ceiling entrances to some existing pithouses. These changes correlated with or were followed by the construction of cobble-adobe structures with sunken floors in the mid-900s. Additions to some of the modified pit rooms, sunken floor rooms, and early surface rooms formed the first pueblo room units sometime between A.C. 1000 and 1025. There is no evidence to suggest that all pit structures occupied in the early or mid-900s were so converted; indeed, the use of pit structures for communal purposes lingered into the Classic Mimbres Period at some localities (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 137). The architectural changes documented at the NAN Ruin were accompanied by a shift in mortuary customs and changes in hearth location and form, storage facilities,</page><page sequence="2">24 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer / Ork e West Fork Ruin Saige- McFarland Gilo Riveri /o ~' / O miles 25 o,"" / ( Mattocks I' Galaz e / Swarts / Cameron * NAN Ranch / Creek SRuin &amp; NEW MEXICO *Old Town Mimbres River "' Figure 1.

A general understanding of the architectural transition was mentioned by both Bradfield (1931) at Cameron Creek Ruin and Cosgrove and Cosgrove (1932) at Swarts Ruin, and a review of the extant data confirms that the same process took place at these sites. Changes in architec- ture, mortuary customs, and ceramic style were recognized by later researchers, and were used to refine previous taxonomic divisions (Anyon, Gilman, and LeBlanc 1981; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984). Although the general trend in architectural and material culture changes were recog- nized, the co-occurring shifts have not been seen clearly before because of the lack of visibility. This lack of visibility was due in part to different excavation strategies, pothunt- ing, and later pueblo construction that wiped out a consid- erable amount of the evidence, thus making it difficult to trace (Lekson 1988, 1990). The NAN Ruin preserved the evidence needed to examine specific changes within the context of overall transitional processes. Lekson (1988, 1990) has recognized a transitional time unit, which he calls the Mangas Phase, following Gladwin and Gladwin (1934) between earlier Mimbres pithouses and later surface pueblos in the upper Gila River area. How Lekson's Mangas phase applies to the NAN Ruin data is another issue addressed in this paper. Mimbres Mogollon Culture History The Mimbres culture is an indigenous, agriculturally oriented lifeway that began ca. A.C. 200, and is one of several regional expressions born out of the broader Mo- gollon tradition. The heartland of the Mimbres culture is the Mimbres River drainage in sw New Mexico. The Mimbres sequence can be traced back to the appearance of oval pithouses with extended entrances constructed on high points of land overlooking the larger streams. These Early Pithouse period settlements are associated with a plain brownware pottery. About A.C. 550, oval pithouses began to be constructed in the lower elevations of the valleys. This shift, presumably tied to an increasing com- mitment to agriculture, is marked by other changes as well and signals the beginning of the late Pithouse Period. A general shift from oval to rectangular pithouse form can be traced throughout the Late Pithouse period. The appear- ance of decorated pottery, first red-slipped (San Francisco Red) with red-on-brown (Mogollon R/B), followed by red-on-white (Three Circle R/W), and eventually by black-on-white (Mimbres Style I and II), provides the hallmark of the Late Pithouse period. The ceramics, mortuary customs, and general evolution of pithouse form and characteristics have been used to define three cultural phases within the Late Pithouse pe- riod: Georgetown (A.c. 550-650), San Francisco (A.C. 650-750), and Three Circle (A.c. 750-1000) (Anyon, Gilman, and LeBlanc 1981). The evolution from pithouses to surface pueblos-the topic of this paper-occurred be- tween A.C. 900 and 1025. Eventually, contiguous-room pueblos of the Classic Mimbres period replaced single- room pithouse and sunken floor rooms; the exquisite Mimbres Style III black-on-white and polychrome ceram- ics are associated with the pueblo phase.

Schematic drawings of the house forms are shown in Figure 3. Pithouses Thirteen Three Circle Phase structures provide suffi- cient excavation data to be used in tracing architectural evolution (FIG. 2). The locations of nine other pithouse structures not included here have been identified during the course of excavations and test pit exploration. Entrances, where known, were extended ones (Rooms 17, 43, 52, 83A, 95, 102, 108B, 113, and 116; FIGS. 4A,4B). Entrances to three pithouses were blocked during the course of their use and converted to structures with ceiling entrances (Rooms 43, 83A, and 116; FIGS. 3B, 5A). None of the Three Circle Phase pithouses at the NAN Ruin had slab-lined hearths; the first floor hearth in Room 83 was rectangular adobe lined without a deflector stone, and the hearth in Room 116 had a stone forming one side plus a deflector stone. Hearths in Rooms 14, 17, 43, 52, 95, 102, 108B, and 113 were adobe-lined basins with deflector stones. Rooms 71 and 83A lacked formal hearths, but had ash deposits on</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 27 the floor. Mimbres Style I Black-on-white ceramic vessels were found either on the floor or in features associated with Rooms 14, 52, 83B, 95, and 102; Mimbres Style II Black-on-white vessels were recovered from floor or fea- ture contexts in Rooms 17, 83A, and 116. No vessels were found associated with Room 43, but the painted sherds recovered from the floor were predominantly Mimbres Style II Black-on-white. Transitional Structures Twenty-three rooms at the NAN Ruin have yielded information on the pithouse-pueblo transition. Three are modified pithouses with blocked entrances mentioned above (Rooms 43, 83, and 116; FIGS. 3B, 5A). Sixteen structures have sunken floors (13, 23B, 51, 57, 61, 80, 82, 89B, 91, 97, 98, 99, 101, 104, 112, and 115-see FIG. 2 for locations within the ruin). Four rooms, 12, 58, 76, and 89A, were incorporated into Classic Mimbres Period sur- face room blocks (FIG. 2). Eighteen of the 23 structures are identified as habitation rooms, two are civic ceremonial (Rooms 43 and 91), and two are granaries (Rooms 51 and 76). Sunken Floor Rooms The 16 sunken floor rooms (FIGS. 3C, 4B, 5B) are identified on the basis of floor construction, which includes leveling or shallow excavation into the underlying hardpan surface. The stratigraphic position of these rooms is secure (FIG. 4B), and is based on their superposition over deeper and earlier pithouses and position beneath later Classic Mimbres rooms. Previously, sunken floor rooms were described as shallow pithouses, and are generally attributed to the Three Circle Phase (Anyon 1980). At the NAN Ruin, it is clear that some of these rooms were single structures, while others may have become core rooms for Classic Mimbres surface room clusters. None of the sunken floor rooms had extended en- trances, and therefore ceiling entrances are assumed; one, Room 91 (FIG. 5B), had a ventilator shaft. Evidence of cobble-adobe wall construction was present for rooms 51, 57, 61, 80, 82, 89B, 91, 98, 99, 101, 104, 112, and 115. Hearths were identified in Rooms 80, 82, 89B, 91, 98, and 112. Hearths in sunken floor rooms are of three kinds, basin- shaped adobe-lined (Room 91), rectangular adobe-lined (Rooms 98, 112), and rectangular slab-lined (Rooms 80, 82, and 89B). Painted ceramics associated with features in sunken floor rooms are predominantly Mimbres Style II Black-on- white. Style II vessels were recovered from Rooms 57, 89, 91, 98, 104, and 112. A Mimbres red-filmed, brownware bowl also was recovered from Room 98. Painted sherds from the floor of Room 91 were almost exclusively Mim- bres Style II Black-on-white. None of the sunken floor rooms were associated with Mimbres Style I or Style III ceramics. Hearth Design Fire hearths in Three Circle Phase pithouses at the NAN Ruin with extended entrance ways consist of circular, adobe-lined basins approximately 30-40 cm in diameter (FIGS. 4A, 4B). These circular hearths are located about midway between the room's center and the extended en- tranceway. A deflector stone is part of this hearth construc- tion; it is placed in the floor on the side of the hearth facing the entrance and protrudes 3 to 5 cm above the floor (FIG. 3A). The circular basin hearth is a continuation from the Georgetown/San Francisco phases judging from its occur- rence at both the Mogollon Village and the Harris Village (Haury 1936a). None of the structures excavated by Haury had slab-lined hearths, and House 2 at Mogollon Village, dated to A.C. 898 on the basis of numerous tree- ring specimens, had a basin hearth. Some time in the late Three Circle Phase, a change in hearth design occurs. The new hearth form is rectangular, either completely or partly framed with stone slabs set in adobe (FIG. 6A), or simply adobe-lined (FIG. 5A). Rectangu- lar slab-lined hearths occur in some sunken floor habita- tion rooms and most Classic Period habitation rooms at the NAN Ruin (FIG. 6B). The rectangular, slab-lined hearths lack deflector stones; such stones would not be necessary if there were ceiling entrance hatchways. Seven pithouses with extended entrances at the Galaz Ruin are reported by Anyon and LeBlanc (1984: 31-95) to have had slab-lined hearths (FIG. 1). As noted below, however, this account requires careful reconsideration. The earliest tree-ring dates for a Galaz Ruin room with a slab-lined hearth are from Room 29, a modified pithouse, and range from A.C. 859 to 893 (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 70-76). Anyon and LeBlanc (1984) believe that the building episodes for this room are represented by two clusters of dates, A.C. 859 for the first building episode and A.C. 870 for the second. Problems arise, however, because Style II pottery is reported (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: fig. 136) from Burials F, G, and I, which were assigned to the first building episode. Vessels illustrated from Room 29 (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: pl. 135F and pl. 136 A-F) appear to be Style I or early Style II. Since the dates for the first building episode are too early for Style II ceramics based on the NAN data, there may be problems of inter- pretation with respect to this structure, or with ceramic</page><page sequence="6">28 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer -7/'* '74 elk.. ri .  .... .! ?......

If the non-cutting date of A.C. 893+ applies to the last building episode, however, then this could place the slab-lined hearth construction and features yielding early Style II pottery after this date or possibly into the 900s. A similar problem lies in the interpretation of Room 18 at the Galaz Ruin, another remodeled pithouse with an extended entranceway. The remodeled hearth was rectan- gular and slab-lined. Tree-ring dates from this room were non-cutting ones but culminate at A.C. 866. Mimbres Style I/II Black-on-white pottery is reported from associated features in the room, again suggesting that the latest occupation may date into the 900s. A shift from basin hearths to slab-lined hearths was also noted at Cameron Creek Ruin (FIG. 1) by Bradfield (1931: 19) in late pit rooms both with and without extended entrances. It is possible to grossly seriate certain rooms at Cameron Creek Ruin using associated ceramics, but one must be very cautious in doing so because burials in several pit rooms that underlie surface rooms are identified as having Mimbres Style III Black-on-white pottery. These burials are most likely intrusive from overlying surface rooms; with the possible exception of Pit Room 118, those pithouses not overlain by surface rooms curiously lack Style III pottery. Circular basin-shaped hearths were retained in some Mimbres communal pit structures well into the Classic Mimbres Period (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 137; Shafer</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 29 , t Mik NNW 1991a). A large, circular cobble-lined hearth was present in Room 39, a surface communal room in the South Room Block at the NAN Ruin (Shafer 1991a). Rectangular hearths in pit structures with extended en- trances are placed between the center post and the en- trance. Similar hearths in sunken floor and surface rooms are placed off-center; if the room has two vertical support posts, the hearth will be between the posts about midway from the room's centerline to one wall. If the room has only one vertical support post, the hearth again will be off-center, about midway between the post and a corner. Air vents usually occur in the wall nearest the hearth if that is an outside wall. The shift in hearth location in sunken floor rooms presumably was meant to accommodate the location of the ceiling entrance. Entrance Type Two types of entrances are documented or inferred during the transition: extended and ceiling hatchways. The following Three Circle Phase pithouses had known ex- tended entrances (that is, they were identified and/or excavated): 14, 17, 36, 43, 52, 83B, 95, 102, 110, 113, and 116 (FIGS. 3A, 4A, 4B). Three (Rooms 43, 83B, and 116) were modified by blocking the extended entrance (FIGS. 3B, 5A); Room 83B was refloored to make 83A, and the hearth area was relocated when the entrance was blocked. The archaeological evidence for the presence of ceiling hatchways in transitional rooms is largely circumstantial but is inferred on the basis of hearth location and type, absence of extended entrances, presence of ventilators, and blocked entrances correlated with a shift in hearth loca- tion. Reuse of the space once occupied by the room and recycling the stones for later construction are probable reasons why the ruins of hatchway frames were not found. Another possibility is that the frames were of wood. Evi- dence for ceiling hatchways in Classic Period rooms is much stronger; there are numerous examples of collapsed hatchway frames constructed of stone slabs in Classic Pe-</page><page sequence="8">30 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer A Figure 5.

Characteristically, these hatchway remnants in Classic Period rooms occur as slab concentrations often partly overlying the slab-lined hearths (Shafer 1982). The location of collapsed hatchway frames shows their location was above the hearths. Storage Facilities The first recognized appearance of surface granaries in the Mimbres sequence at the NAN Ruin occurs during the transition, indicating a shift in storage technology. Grana- ries are identified by such features as unusually thick adobe floors (Room 51), adobe floor reinforced by slabs or cobbles (Room 76), and the presence of unshelled, burned corn (both Rooms 51 and 76). Storage facilities in the earlier pithouse periods may have comprised only the use of large pits or cists such as those recorded at the Galaz Ruin (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 88), but evidence that such pits were used for storage has not been demonstrated empirically. Public Plazas Another notable feature present only at the larger Mim- bres pueblo sites are public plazas. Exactly when public plazas became a focal point of Mimbres community or- ganization is not clear from the archaeological record (see Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 140 for a more thorough dis- cussion of Mimbres Phases). Part of the problem of ascer- taining the presence of plazas lies in the absence of infor- mation on outdoor space use in Late Pithouse Period villages. Open plaza space in the Three Circle Phase might be suggested by the pithouse distribution at the NAN Ruin (Creel 1989a: fig. 2). It is rarely possible, however, to determine which pithouses were contemporaneous, and which spaces were or were not occupied at any one time. Two Classic Period plazas-east plaza and west plaza (FIG. 2)-have been identified at the NAN Ruin; while pithouses and sunken floor rooms have been found be- neath the Classic Period east plaza, part of the east plaza area may have been public space during the transition, although this cannot be demonstrated with existing data. Mortuary Variability Mortuary customs during the Three Circle Phase in- clude burial outdoors, in the fill of abandoned rooms, and beneath the floors of occupied rooms. Burials beneath the floor of occupied rooms (i.e., subfloor) are rare in the early half of the phase, based on reports by Haury (1936a), Figure 7.

Burial 204 in sunken floor Room 104 showing killed bowl placed over the head. Bussey (1975), and Anyon and LeBlanc (1984: 31-89). When burials are found beneath the floor, associations often include one or more smashed mortuary vessels in the grave fill above the corpse (FIG. 7), jewelry, and occasionally a palette. Vessel "killing" by smashing occurs as the pre- dominant method only for a very short period of time, and that pattern gives way to placing the mortuary vessel over the head after killing by punching a hole in the bottom. Smashing vessels as a method of killing continued, albeit rarely, into the Classic Mimbres period, however. Subfloor burials associated with smashed pottery vessels at the NAN Ruin occurred only in Rooms 14 (three burials) and 83B (one burial). Ceramics in two of these burials (Burial 86 in Room 14 and Burial 104 in Room 83B) included Mimbres Style I (FIG. 7); and a smashed Mimbres Style I-II bowl was included in the fill of Burial 90 in Room 14 (Shafer 1985; Shafer and Taylor 1986). Mortuary practices during the transitional period be- tween A.C. 900 and 1000 included both inhumations and cremations. There is a major shift toward subfloor burials associated with killed hemispherical bowls in the late Three Circle Phase (FIG. 8). Of the 42 burials that can be dated to the Three Circle Phase and the transition on the basis of either stratigraphy, room association, or ceramic style, 26 or 64% were subfloor and 16 or 36% were outdoors. When only the 26 transitional burials are considered, 82% are</page><page sequence="12">34 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer A Figure 9.

Haury's (1936a) data from Harris Village, where slightly over 4% of the 48 Three Circle Phase burials were subfloor, provides support for the assumption that a significant shift toward subfloor burial occurred during the transition. All four of the Late Pithouse Period cremations exca- vated at the NAN Ruin were outdoors. One primary creation (Burial 175) dates to the middle Three Circle Phase (Creel 1989a), and three secondary cremations are dated to the mid-900s based on ceramic associations. The primary cremation was in a crematory pit associated with charred remains of the rack and pyre. The secondary cremations are deposits of calcined bones placed in pits; the calcined bones, ash, and burned shell of jewelry of Burial 218 were placed in four small pits roughly forming a square, each capped with a concentration of sherds (FIG. 9A) (Shafer 1991b). Four vessels (including three Style II bowls and a Three-Circle Neck Corrugated pitcher) were partly restored with sherds from each of the four concen- trations (FIG. 9B). Calcined bones of another cremation (Burial 224) were placed similarly in a small pit capped with sherds from a Style II bowl; a third (Burial 227) was placed in a Three-Circle Neck Corrugated pitcher covered with a Style II bowl. Ceramic Variability The pottery associated with the transitional rooms and features comprises Mimbres Style II Black-on-white, Three-Circle Neck Corrugated, and Mimbres red-slipped brownware. Stylistic variation within late Mimbres Style II is considerable (FIGS. 9B, 10A-F, 11A-F), however, more so than indicated by the original definition of Style II by Scott (1983). Style II evolves subtly out of Style I, the four-quadrant format common for Style I carrying over (FIG. 10A). The main difference is that wavy lines are used as space fillers in Style I, and straight lines in Style II. As Style II develops, the border line is notably thicker than the hachure lines. The designs for both Style I and early Style II extend to the rim (FIG. 10A-E). On the later end of the Style II continuum some vessels are framed with a heavy line, and the interior design is suspended from this line (FIG. 10F). Alternatively, a design band composed of fine lines bordered by bold lines (FIG. 11A) or geometric motifs (FIG. 11B) may frame the upper part of the bowl; the band of fine lines bordered on top by a bold line is carried over into Style III (FIG. 11D). The framing band quickly gives way to the framing lines characteristic of Style III (Shafer and Brewington in press; FIG. 11C-F). Mimbres red-slipped brownware is the same as Haury's (1936b) San Francisco Red. It first appears as a polished, red-slipped brownware in earlier phases but becomes much less polished during the transition. The vessels are mainly bowls, seed jars, and narrow-neck jars. The red- slipped brownware vessels are common during the transi- tion, but never number more than about 5% of all the vessels, and ceased to be made after about A.C. 1000 (Shafer 1991c). Changes in ceramic style are correlated with the change from the domestic pithouses to pueblos associated with more public space. Mimbres pottery was made to serve three basic needs: cooking, serving, and storage. To some degree the functional role of a vessel was determined by its form and how it was made and decorated. Brewington (1992a; see also Brewington, Dockall, and Shafer in press) has provided a useful explanation for the different kinds of pottery and why some forms were decorated and others were not by relating the differences to technological style and social style. Technological style is related to methods of pottery manufacture and use (Sackett 1990), while social style relates to information exchange through display in social settings (Wobst 1977; Wyckoff 1990: 115-126). According to Brewington (1992a) and Sackett (1990), not all vessel forms or clay and temper mixtures are equally suited for the various tasks. The potter had to choose the proper mixture, vessel form, and surface treatment. The neck banded and corrugated cooking and storage jars represent technological style since their coarse temper, roughened exterior, and size suggest vessel function. By contrast, the white slipped wares have a finer paste and a greater variation in the amount and constituents of the temper. There is a remarkable continuity in technology of the neck banded and corrugated vessels through time (McCol- lum 1992), with few if any differences throughout the Mimbres region. A Three-Circle Neck Corrugated jar made in the upper Mimbres Valley looks and appears very much the same as one made in the lower Valley. Only subtle differences in the minerals used in tempering the clays are detectable. Contrasting with technological style, Brewington (1992a) and Wobst (1977) argue that social style carries social information in the displayed designs that are inter- pretable outside the immediate household. Wobst (1977) defines three spheres of social interaction. Sphere 1 refers to the interaction between members in the immediate household and close relatives. Sphere 2 applies to those such as distant relatives, friends, or exchange partners who are not seen on a daily basis and are not as intimately known as those in Sphere 1. Sphere 3 includes people who are socially distant: people in distant villages with whom</page><page sequence="14">36 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer A.i i i C.......

It is the people in Sphere 2 who are most likely to respond to the symbols displayed. Brewington (1992a), in her model of ceramics, refers to Sphere 1 as the domestic arena. It is in the domestic arena that vessels used for cooking, serving, and storage were used daily. Plain vessels or those with plastic designs (made when the clay was wet, such as corrugations) will occur most frequently. Cooking and serving activities may also involve people in Sphere 2-the extra-domestic arena but the context would likely include public feasting, cere- monies, ritual displays, or gift-giving between members of a community or nearby communities (see Wyckoff 1990: 115-126 for Hopi examples of this process). Symbols displayed-in dress, costumes, or on ceramics-would be understood by the people in Sphere 2 since they would carry shared iconographic symbols of social identification, status, and information exchange. People in Sphere 3, the distant arena, would likely recognize iconographic sym- bols, but may not be able to decode the meanings. The evolution of Mimbres painted pottery and the pro- duction of the finest Style III painted wares have been attributed to the rise of ceramic craft specialists by LeBlanc (1983: 139; see Shafer 1985 for further discussion of Mimbres craft specialization). LeBlanc (1983: 138, 139) suggested that most of the elaborately painted bowls were made at the larger pueblos. Gilman (1989), however, has argued that the production of Style III vessels never devel- oped beyond the household level. While Brewington (1992a) does not shed light on the craft specialization issue, her model does suggest that the production and distribution of elaborately painted vessels correlate with the activities carried out involving other members of the community, as in public rituals and cere- monies and gift giving where the display of specific sym- bols carries the greatest meaning. Therefore, the evolution of Mimbres painted pottery may correlate with the grow- ing importance of plaza ceremonies and rituals. When Brewington's model is applied to the evolution of Mimbres painted pottery, it supports Gilman's (1983) ecological model-which is discussed below in more de- tail-in that both incorporate growth in population and social complexity from the Georgetown Phase through the Classic Mimbres Phase. Brewington's model is also sup- ported by Wyckoff's (1990) study of Hopi traditional and progressive potters that seemingly documents the very process Brewington is modeling. Wyckoff (1990: 146) observed that Hopi pottery was decorated for religious, economic, and aesthetic reasons and clearly expressed ele- ments of Hopi world view. Gilman's model traces the technological response to population growth and subsis- tence shift, whereas Brewington's model helps to under- stand why the decorations on the serving dishes were elaborated. The bottom line of this discussion is that as the Mimbres emphasis in public ceremonies increased with agricultural intensification and population growth during the transi- tion, so did the complexity of painted pottery art, which became a medium for the display of religious and social symbols. Dating the Transition The succession of building episodes at the NAN Ruin spanning two Mimbres periods and four phases has stimu- lated archaeologists to obtain datable materials at every opportunity. The mere fact that a number of these phases are themselves poorly dated justifies placing chronometric dating as a high priority. Several dating tools have been utilized in developing the NAN Ruin occupation sequence and architectural development (Shafer and Taylor 1986). Relative dating has been employed using superposition of building episodes and deposits, horizontal stratigraphy using wall bonding patterns for the surface rooms, ceramic seriation, and ceramic cross-dating. Chronometric dates have been obtained using dendrochronology, archaeomag- netism, obsidian hydration, and radiocarbon. Relative dating on the basis of vertical stratigraphy and ceramic cross-dating has proven valuable in ordering the sequence of building episodes in large, block area excava- tions. It has been necessary, however, to rely on chro- nometric techniques to establish a general time period for specific structures or features. The main reasons for this are that the respective phases in the Late Pithouse Period are poorly dated (Anyon 1980), and the degree of architec- tural variability is not well known. Most Mogollon archae- ologists rely on Haury's (1936a) phase definitions and corresponding pithouse forms for phase placement, but the NAN Ruin excavations have shown more variability in pithouse form than one might expect. Unfortunately, only one tree-ring date was obtained from any of the NAN Ruin pithouses; the building materi- als turn out to be primarily riparian species or juniper, woods not suitable for tree-ring dating. The single date is A.C. 859vv'1 from Room 52, a Three Circle Phase civic- ceremonial room; this room also yielded an archaeomag- netic date ofA.C. 820-860 (at the 63% confidence level). Other archaeomagnetic samples were dated from 1. The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona uses the symbol "vv" when there is no way of estimating how far the last ring is from the outside. Based on the structure style and associated ceramics, however, I feel that the tree-ring date is within a few years of the construction date.</page><page sequence="16">38 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? :!. ..............i C1 E - F 1:..:.:::::;-Bs:9:11'?? :.::! ? ~ :...i-..? : i EI Figure 11.

A beginning date of A.C. 900-925 ? 30 for the early part of the transition was obtained for the burned wall plaster of Room 113, a Three-Circle Phase pithouse with an extended entryway and basin-shaped hearth. The date relates to the time the structure was burned. Room 113 was filled in rapidly with midden debris, judging from the early Style II ceramics in the fill. Overlying the pithouse was Room 112, a sunken floor room with a rectangular, adobe-lined hearth, and one adult burial beneath the floor with a Mimbres Style II bowl in association. A series of 12 obsidian hydration dates was obtained from a sequence of fill on and between the floors of Rooms 103, 102, 104, and 39. Four of these are B.c. dates and apparently represent obsidian scavenged from earlier sites in the area. Several of the dates, however, may provide a chronometric sequence for this series of structures. The earliest was Room 103, which was probably a San Fran- cisco Phase house, and which yielded one sample date of A.C. 620 ? 92. Room 103 was cut into by Room 102, a Three Circle Phase structure. One obsidian specimen from above the floor of Room 102, in probable burial pit fill (originating from Room 104 above), yielded a date of A.C. 970 ? 40. The fill above the floor of Room 104-a sunken floor room-yielded an obsidian specimen that dated to A.C. 947 ? 41. The latter two dates most likely provide the approximate age for Room 104 if we assume that the dates are accurate; the dates were calculated from an effected surface temperature rather than one measured from the soil (Christopher Stevenson, personal communication, 1988). I am inclined, however, to tentatively accept the accuracy of these dates based on the A.C. 1063 ? 30 date for a specimen from the floor of Room 39, a Classic Mimbres civic-ceremonial room overlying Room 104. Room 39 was added to a suite of rooms about A.C. 1066 based on tree-ring dates from Room 29, which Room 39 abutts (Shafer 1991a). Dating the late end of the transition is based on tree-ring specimens from the earliest suite of surface rooms iden- tified at the NAN Ruin, a suite that includes Rooms 76 and 89. Room 76 was a granary with a thick adobe floor over a pavement of slabs and cobbles. Burned corn, still on the cob, was found on the floor of this structure. Two tree- ring dates, 1008r and 1008+r,2 were obtained from the burned superstructure. These dates are in accord with the ceramics from Room 89, which was originally part of the suite that included Room 76; when Room 89 was in use, the two rooms shared a common wall. Room 89 yielded one burial with a late Style II bowl in association and another with a large early Style III sherd. Pueblo Transition and the Mangas Phase Lekson (1988, 1990) uses the Mangas phase as a taxo- nomic unit in the Mimbres area based on architectural patterns and associated ceramics at the Saige-McFarland site in the Upper Gila area. The Mangas phase was origi- nally used by Gladwin and Gladwin (1934) as an interim phase of small surface pueblos that preceded larger pueblos (see LeBlanc 1986 and Lekson 1990 for discussions on the Mangas phase). While the data interpretation on which the original phase definition was based has proven to be in error (Brewington 1992b: 45), Lekson believes the con- cept was valid. His argument rests largely on his analysis of ceramics in Room Block A and Pithouse 3. He dates surface-pueblo Room Block A to the time of production of Mimbres pottery Styles I and II, or sometime in the 900s. Pithouse 3, on the other hand, has the earmarks of a Classic Mimbres pithouse kiva according to the criteria defined by Anyon and LeBlanc (1984: 137), but yielded predominantly Styles I and II pottery in the fill. In brief, Lekson believes that the first surface pueblos were built in the Late Three Circle phase and were associated with Mimbres Style I and II pottery; this is his basis for reviving the Mangas phase as intermediate between the Three Circle phase and the Classic Mimbres phase. There are several issues that deserve to be debated before Lekson's thesis can be accepted. The first rests on the assumption that the Mimbres chronology and ceramic styles developed from the analysis of large pueblos in the Mimbres Valley proper are equally valid for the upper Gila. Brewington (1992b) questions this assumption on the basis of her analysis of the architecture and ceramics from the West Fork Ruin upstream on the West Fork of the Gila River from the Saige-McFarland site. Brewington's (1992a) model cited above would also predict that some ceramic style variation would occur between the upper Gila area and the Mimbres Valley settlements. The assumption in this case is that the upper Gila people would interact more frequently in the public arena with each other rather than with the people in the Mimbres Valley, and vice versa. Certainly, Mimbres ceramics are very similar to each other across what has been defined as the Mimbres area (LeBlanc 1983: fig. 1); local differences do exist, however. Another issue of concern regarding the definition of the Mangas phase is that far too little excavated data is available from the upper Gila area to resolve the local chronological 2. The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona uses the symbol "r" to mean that less than a full section is present, but the outermost ring is continuous around the available circumference. The symbol may in fact be a cutting date, and therefore may provide a date for the year the room was built. When one or more rings may be missing near the end of the ring series whose presence or absence cannot be determined, the symbol "+" is used.</page><page sequence="18">40 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer problems, much less to extend any applied concept across the Mimbres world. Likewise, we should be cautious in assuming that the Mimbres Valley patterns are going to apply equally to the upper Gila area. There are substantive archaeological differences between the two areas as indi- cated by the mortuary patterns (Gilman 1980), as Lekson (1988) clearly recognized. I accept Lekson's (1990) use of the Mangas phase as a taxonomic unit between the periods of pithouses and surface pueblos in the upper Gila area where the archaeological systematics are yet to be clearly defined and dated. In the Mimbres Valley, however, where the archaeological database and dating are much better than that in the upper Gila, it is possible to go beyond merely distinguishing taxonomic units and view the transi- tion from pithouses to pueblos in much finer detail. The changes in architectural patterns, mortuary cus- toms, and ceramic style were gradual and did not all take place at the same time in the Mimbres Valley proper. Pithouse use lingered; hearth styles do not correlate pre- cisely with shifts to ceiling hatchways; and Style II ceramics occur in pithouses with both extended and blocked en- trances, with sunken floor rooms, and with surface rooms incorporated into room clusters. Together they form a continuum of change that began well into the Three Circle phase and culminated with the Classic Mimbres phase. While there is no place to conveniently draw taxonomic lines, the complex of changes identifies a transition from one kind of community and material complex to another. To label this transition the Mangas phase would imply a discrete temporal entity, which clearly it is not; yet Lek- son's (1988, 1990) point in re-introducing the Mangas phase was to define an intermediate phase between the earlier pithouses and the later surface pueblos in the upper Gila area, the same point addressed in this paper for the Mimbres River Valley. Gilman's Space-use Model The shift from pithouses to pueblos has been examined by Patricia Gilman (1983, 1987) from the perspective of how space was used with regard to food preparation and storage. She associates these changes with population growth, agricultural intensification, and increasing seden- tism. Factors that Gilman sees as leading to the shift include: the length of time required for food preparation and the need for secure, long-term storage of food crops. She supported her case using both ethnographic and ar- chaeological sources. Gilman's explanation of the pithouse to pueblo transi- tion was framed in terms of human ecology, and how it relates to changes in subsistence, settlement, and technol- ogy. It is an important contribution that addresses a major archaeological issue in the Southwest. The changes and growth traced in the NAN Ruin community fit Gilman's model well. The restructuring of the NAN settlement from Three- Circle phase pithouses to a multi-roomblock Classic Mim- bres pueblo community was due to responses to popula- tion increase and agricultural intensification throughout the Mimbres Valley. Analysis of the NAN faunal remains showed an emphasis on small animal exploitation-le- porids and gophers-through time, with an increased use of gophers in the Classic Mimbres Period (Shaffer 1991: 156); Shaffer (1992) suggests that gopher exploitation is related to field maintenance. Formal granaries with either thick adobe floors or stone- paved floors capped with thick adobe were incorporated into room suites early in the Classic Mimbres phase (Shafer 1991d). Wall bases on some granaries were also reinforced by vertical slabs set on the outside and inside of the room. The location and nature of granaries at the NAN Ruin in the Late Pithouse Period are unknown, but presumably they were pits or detached buildings of less substantial construction. The construction of granaries and their incorporation into room suites represents a major shift in storage behav- ior and technology, a process predicted by Gilman (1987) as a consequence of agricultural intensification and popula- tion increase. These rooms were secured from burrowing rodents and presumably from moisture that would create spoilage. In brief, I agree with Gilman's (1983) explanation for the shift from pithouses to pueblos based on the inde- pendent observations of the NAN Ruin data. In fact, the process documented here follows her predictions (Gilman 1987) very closely. Symbolism and Shifting World View I now advance an explanation that relates not to techno- logical function but to symbolic function regarding the shifting patterns in architecture and related features. There are a number of factors left unexplained during the transi- tion. For instance, why was there a shift to ceiling hatch- ways, rectangular hearths, and subfloor burials for Mim- bres habitation rooms? These manifestations are not readily explained by changes in food preparation and storage. For example, there is reason to doubt that a change in hearth design correlates with changes in food preparation. Among the western pueblos, most cooking was done outdoors (Min- deleff 1891: 162, 163). Outdoor excavations at the NAN Ruin have documented over 70 oval, basin-shaped hearths</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 41 prepared in adobe surfaces adjacent to pueblo rooms. These are virtually identical to those described by Min- deleff(1891: 162, 163). The next question is: are the rectangular hearths more efficient in radiating heat? There is no empirical evidence presently available to answer this question. A third possibil- ity is that the new house design was somehow related to changing storage practices, as suggested by Gilman (1983, 1987). This explanation cannot be either supported or ruled out with the present data. In an effort to understand why Mimbres habitation rooms assumed new forms, I will consider their cosmology and world view.3 Pithouses and pueblos are examples of what Deetz (1977: 92-93) describes as vernacular architecture. Ver- nacular-or folk-structures are made by the users and are sensitive indicators of what these people considered appro- priate, right, and useful. According to Deetz (1977: 93) "changes in attitudes, values, and world view are very likely to be reflected in changes in vernacular architectural forms." Mimbres symbolism has been a subject of interest for a long time, but the focus has been on the painted pottery. Fewkes' (1914, 1923) initial interest in Mimbres pottery was due not to the technology-which is not that good- but to the symbolism. Despite the widespread speculation regarding the meaning of Mimbres symbols (Gladwin 1957: 224-231), some effort has been made to seriously interpret their meaning; among the more substantive of these studies are Kabotie (1949), Carr (1977), Brody (1977: 200-210, 1978, 1983), and Moulard (1981). Kabotie, a renowned Hopi artist, examined certain Mim- bres figurative designs and provided an interpretation based on modern Hopi world view. Carr (1977) related graphic symbolism in Mimbres figurative bowls to pan- puebloan myths. Unlike Carr, Moulard's interest in sym- bolism was in not only the painted symbols, but in the ideological context of the mortuary ceramics. Using a direct historical approach based on Pueblo ethnographies, she argued that the mortuary vessel was a metaphor for sky dome and the kill hole served as the portal for emergence into the Otherworld. She is the first to be concerned with the symbolism in the ideological context of Mimbres mor- tuary customs. Brody (1977: 200, 1978) cautiously sug- gested the four quadrant design on Mimbres pottery may represent the multi-layered universe concept. Brody (1978, 1983) also makes the point that Mimbres icono- graphy might best be interpreted in the context of Pueb- loan ethnographies and world view, and suggests an even deeper relationship may have been shared with the Maya world. There are a number of lines of evidence in the Mimbres material record to support the notion that the shift from pithouse to pueblo during the 10th century was accompa- nied by a major change of emphasis in Mimbres symbolism and the way the symbols of the world view were displayed as part of the religion. One example is the symbolism of the Mimbres house or habitation room. An example of this characteristic in Native American cultures is described by Zingg (1938: 676), who states that the house of the Huichol in Jalisco and Nayarit, Mexico, was built to replicate the cosmology of the people. Farther afield, Brundage (1979: 4) emphasizes the close relation- ship between the Aztecs' concept of the universe and their architecture. Schele and Friedel (1990: 67) describe Maya architecture as being a human-made matrix complemen- tary to the sacred landscape of the gods. Assuming that the Mimbres people followed a similar belief regarding the way a house should be built, I offer a possible explanation for a series of features in Mimbres houses that co-occur in the period of transition, with the caveat that often too much can be read into ancient sym- bols. There is the danger that once one becomes aware of the meaning of simple symbols, this meaning is read into everything that remotely resembles the symbol in actuality or metaphor. I believe, however, that the search for mean- ing in Mimbres symbolism can be fruitful by taking a more direct historical approach. If the sources for the meanings are taken from Chichimec (includes hunting and gathering and formative cultures of northern Mexico and parts of sw United States), Puebloan, and Mesoamerican ethnogra- phies and histories, there is a greater likelihood that mean- ings will be applicable. Common themes in Chichimec, Puebloan, and Mesoamerican belief systems are: a multi-layered universe (sometimes projected as a parallel universe), emergence from the Underworld, shamanism, altered states of con- sciousness, human sacrifice and/or bloodletting, death as a continuation of life, and variations on the theme of ances- tors equated with clouds, rain, and crystals, among others (Zingg 1938: 148-168; Tyler 1964: 49-80; Meyerhoff 1974; Brundage 1979: 6-8; Schele and Freidel 1990: 3. The use of the term "cosmology" follows that of Eliade (1987), and my use of "world view" encompasses both Eliade's (1987) and Ortiz' (1972) definitions. Eliade (1987) uses the term cosmology for both the study of cosmic views in general and the views concerning the universe in specific cultures or religions. To him cosmology "refers to more consciously entertained images, doctrines, and scientific views concerning the universe," while world viewv "is the term for a more general, less precisely delineated, but commonly accepted set of ideas (an 'ideology') concerning life and world" (Eliade 1987: 101). Ortiz (1972) gives a more detailed definition of world view; to him "it defines, classifies and orders the 'really real' in the universe, in their world, and in their society," and "denotes a system of symbols by means of which a people impose meaning and order on their world" (Ortiz 1972: 136, 137).</page><page sequence="20">42 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer 64-95; and Carolyn Boyd, personal communication, 1993). The concept of a multi-layered universe is well docu- mented in prehistoric cultures whose subsistence econo- mies ranged from hunter-gatherer to state level. For exam- ple, the tiered universe can be seen in the Archaic rock art of the Chihuahuan Desert (Carolyn Boyd, personal com- munication, 1993) and among the Pueblo peoples (Tyler 1964: 49-80), Maya (Schele and Friedel 1990: 64-95), Huichol (Zingg 1938), and Aztecs (Brundage 1979: 7). If we assume that: 1) the Mimbres shared a belief system that included the multi-layered universe, emergence, and ancestor worship (among other beliefs) that were common throughout sw North America and Mesoamerica; and 2) that such symbolism may be expressed in the folk architec- ture, then it follows that a major shift in house design could signal a change in either the cosmology or the way their world view was materially expressed. I suggest that the Mimbres house with the hatchway and associated features became symbolic of, or a metaphor for, the multi- tiered universe, a theme that is prevalent in Puebloan world view, particularly in the symbolism associated with Anasazi kivas (Waters 1963; Tyler 1964: 56). Like the Huichol round house and the Hopi kiva, the space within the Mimbres room may have symbolized the Middleworld or the living world; that above was the Otherworld, and that below the floor was the Underworld (FIG. 12). A characteristic feature in many Anasazi kivas is a small hole or sipapu (symbolic of the entryway from the Under- world) in the floor (Mindeleff 1891: 122; Cattanach 1980: 49-135). This may have been a feature in Mimbres civic- ceremonial rooms as well; a possible Mimbres example of a sipapu is reported by Anyon and LeBlanc (1984: 53) in pithouse Room 18 at the Galaz Ruin, which had an extended entryway and a slab-lined hearth. Myerhoff (1974: 109) describes a capped hole in the floor of the Huichol ceremonial house, analogous to the Anasazi sipapu, that symbolized the entry from the Under- world into the present world. Zingg (1938: 180-186), who also acknowledges a similarity with the sipapu, states the sacred hole beneath the fireplace (which he notes was missed by Lumholtz) was the holiest place of the Huichol. The sacred hole was capped with a "god-disc," and offer- ings were made in it to the earth, rain, and cloud goddesses (Zingg 1938: 180-183). When the Mimbres first appear in the archaeological record, their hunting practices and use of desert plants were much the same as the earlier Archaic people of the Chihuahuan Desert; only the use of corn, pottery, and more permanent pithouses separate them materially from their Archaic ancestors. No comparable rock art or vertical shaft caves occur in this part of the Chihuahuan Desert to trace a continuation of the behaviors observed in the Archaic. When Mimbres symbolism in architecture, mor- tuary practices, and ceramics became more graphic in the material record about A.C. 900, a world view incorporating the emergence myths and cosmology of a multi-layered universe is recognizable. The Mimbres shift to the rectangular slab-lined hearth generally correlates with a shift to the ceiling hatchway in the early 900s, although the Galaz Ruin data (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984) suggests the slab-lined hearth may have preceded the shift to ceiling hatchways by about a genera- Figure 12. Proposed multi-layered universe model for the Mimbres house. Otherworld Middle / World Hearth ... .. Underworld</page><page sequence="21">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 43 tion or so. What functional advantages, if any, were pro- vided by the slab-lined hearth are unknown, but in addi- tion, it may have provided a symbolic portal or hatchway into the underworld; its rectangular design may have sym- bolized the cardinal directions while its placement beneath the ceiling hatchway may have provided a vertical axis. The ceiling hatchway may have represented the portal with the ladder being the axis mundi between the worlds. Passage up the ladder may have been a symbolic reenact- ment of the emergence from one world to another; the ladder, as Waters (1963: 56) describes for the Hopi, repre- sents the reed up which people climbed during their origi- nal emergence. The common placement of a mortuary vessel with a hole punched in the bottom over the head of the deceased is another change that occurs in the 900s about the same time as the shift to rectangular slab-lined hearths and ceiling hatchways. When burials first appear beneath the floor prior to this time in the Three Circle phase, they were often accompanied by several smashed vessels in the grave fill. Placing a single bowl with a punched hole over the head represents a significant behavioral change. Barbara Moulard (1981: xxvii) has convincingly argued the sym- bolism or meaning of vessel killing and appropriately re- lated it to the emergence. When the Mimbres ceramic hemispheric vessel is considered in its role as a mortuary offering during a funerary rite, it takes on several aspects that are associated with death, the Underworld, emergence and rebirth. The ceramic form rep- resents a barrier between two metaphysical realms, the realm of the dead in the Underworld and the Upperworld. Confined on the interior of the form are restraining lines which mark the boundaries of this realm. Other lines define the directional cosmology of the Underworld, and the sym- bolism of representational forms reinforces this cosmological description and describes the activities of its inhabitants. When the vessel was broken during the rite of passage for the dead and the vessel was placed over the head or face of the individual, the lines of constraint and the house of the Un- derworld were opened. The spirit of the dead was allowed to pass out and move to the Upperworld as an ancestor of the Mimbres. This practice of placing symbols for the passageway in the grave was widespread and varied among the groups in northern Mexico and the Southwest. The use of a killed mortuary vessel is but one method of symbolizing the emergence; placing a reed in the grave-as among the Tarahumara (Lumholtz 1902: 384; Bennett and Zingg 1935: 359), Huichol (Zingg 1938: 155), and Mayo (Beals 1943: 53, 54)-is another. Among the preclassic Ho- hokam (and a minor occurrence among the Mimbres) cremation was the pattern of disposal of the dead, i.e., reducing the body to ash (Haury 1976). Given that ash is a widespread symbol for smoke, clouds, and ancestors- cremating the dead may have been yet another way of entering that person into the Otherworld as ash and smoke. Correlating with the hatchway and intramural burial practice is a development in the symbolism depicted on the Mimbres Style II ceramics near the end of the transition, ca. A.C. 975-1000. A bordering, framing line or framing band (FIGS. 10F, 11A, 11B) were motifs added to Style II; the framing line is one distinguishing trait of Mimbres Style III (FIGS. 11C-F) where it occurs with numerous variations. Moulard (1981: xx) recognizes the framing line as the division defining the Underworld and the Otherworld. Among the Huichol, for example, the rim line on their pottery-sometimes described as a serpent, or serpent sky band (Myerhoff 1974)-also depicts the division between the "real world" and the "Otherworld" (Lumholtz 1900). Moulard (1981: xxi) suggests that the black and white colors, associated with Zenith and Nadir in pueblo beliefs, "are associated with specific concepts and personages relat- ing to death and the Pueblo Underworld realm of spirits." The world view represented by the multi-layered uni- verse and emergence themes in Mimbres material expres- sion may not have diffused from Mesoamerica as suggested by some (Brody 1977: 200-209; KI(elley 1971, 1974, 1986), and implied by others (DiPeso 1974: 299-309). The multi-tiered universe and emergence themes are not necessarily Mesoamerican in origin, nor are they indige- nous to the American Southwest. They are present in the ancient Archaic hunter-gatherer belief systems of the southern North American deserts, especially in the Chi- huahuan Desert where they can most easily be traced back in mortuary practices and in rock art (Carolyn Boyd, personal communication, 1993).4 Similarities in ritual themes as expressed by the Mim- bres, other Southwestern, and Mesoamerican cultures may result not from diffusion, but from common origins in the Chihuahuan/Sonoran Archaic traditions. Differences in these ritual themes may be understood as the result of different specific histories and geographic variability, as well as reflecting the various stages of subsistence level, 4. Carolyn Boyd's (1993) recent analysis of Lower Pecos River Style rock art, using comparative ethnographic and archaeological examples from northern Mexico, demonstrates that the emergence and tiered universe themes date back to at least 2000 B.C. in the Chihuahuan Desert. The organic binder for these rock paintings has been successfully removed using a pioneering approach perfected by researchers at Texas A&amp;M University (Russ et al. 1990; Hyman and Rowe 1992) and dated by accelerator mass spectrometry. The dating of the Lower Pecos picto- graphic art is critical and counters Kelley's (1974) view that this art emanated from Mesoamerica. The AMS dating demonstrates that the Lower Pecos River Style predates the Classic and Postclassic Periods in Mesoamerica.</page><page sequence="22">44 Architecture and Symbolism in the Mimbres Valley/Shafer sociocultural development, and complexity reached by these groups. The idea that the Mogollon either descended from or were part of a population that ranged along the eastern side of the Sierra Madres in northern Mexico was sug- gested by Kelley (1971). This theory is supported by Turner's (1993) analysis of discrete dental traits comparing the NAN Ruin population to other existing skeletal popu- lations in the Southwest and northern Mexico. Turner found the Mimbres more closely related genetically to the indigenous populations of northern Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Sonora) than to the Pueblo groups of the South- west. The Mimbres do stand apart from the Hohokam and Chaco regional systems. Their ancestral tie is more to the south, to an area that-save for the later development at Casas Grandes-is largely unknown archaeologically. In sum, the symbolism behind such patterns as ceiling hatchways, rectangular hearths, subfloor burials, placing a killed mortuary vessel over the head of the corpse, and ceramic design change-material patterns that we recog- nize as distinctively Mimbres-emerge as part of Mimbres world view and religion during the pithouse-pueblo transi- tion beginning in the Three Circle phase. The shift in architecture away from the individually-oriented, shaman- istic pithouse society to the Pueblo community, with its plazas and public rituals requiring visual symbols, are part of this overall symbolic expression. Some of the patterns in the Mimbres area described by Patricia Gilman (1983) can be understood as technological changes in subsistence practices to accommodate the needs of expanding popula- tions. Other things such as the subfloor mortuary pattern, rectangular hearths, hatchways, and symbolism on ceram- ics expressed the shift in world view and religion, and were equally necessary for societal reorganization to structure the technological changes relating to corn agriculture. Conclusions Changes in house construction, hearth type, mortuary custom, and ceramic style are used to define a period of transition at the NAN Ruin from Three Circle phase pithouse villages to surface pueblo room clusters of the Classic Mimbres phase. These changes began about A.C. 900 and, together, culminated in the basic patterns that identify the Classic Mimbres phase by A.c. 1025. The transition from Late Pithouse Period communities to surface pueblo communities occurred throughout the Mimbres heartland, based on comparative data now recog- nizable at NAN, Cameron Creek, Galaz, and Swarts ruins. Gilman (1983) attributes the changes to a growing em- phasis on agriculture which required altering traditional practices of storage and food preparation. The technological changes are understandable in the context of growing populations, greater food demands, agricultural intensification, and shifting emphasis in land use practices. Changes in house design, hearth design, ceramic style, and mortuary customs cannot be so easily explained on the basis of technological change, however, but may best be understood as changes in the symbolism and behaviors expressing the world view in accordance with Mimbres cosmology. The house with the ceiling hatchway, ladder, rectangular hearth, and subfloor burial may have become a metaphor for a multi-layered universe, a concept pervasive in the world views of Native Americans in the Southwest, northern Mexico, and Mesoamerica. Beliefs articulated with this world view are the notions of emergence and ancestor worship. The emergence theme, which is shown to have a history predating Classic Mesoamerica in the Chihuahuan Desert, involves the pas- sage between layers or worlds through an opening or portal; the Mimbres symbolized the portal by the kill hole in mortuary bowls, possibly-as argued here-by the slab- lined rectangular hearth and the hatchway into the house. The ladder served as the axis mundi for passage through the portal. The Anasazi kiva with its sipapu, ladder, and hatchway is seen as a direct prehistoric analogue in the Southwest. The Mimbres display of symbols both figuratively and metaphorically is seen as the expression of their religious behavior. The shift toward public rituals and symbolic display involving ancestor worship and rain-making that occurred as the Pueblo communities evolved may signify fundamental changes in emphasis of their world view to accommodate the increased importance of corn (as sug- gested by the development of special storage rooms or granaries) during the pithouse-pueblo transition. This shift may have come at the expense of, or surpassed the impor- tance of, shamanic journeys to the Otherworld, which were common to the hunter-gatherer groups of the Chi- huahuan and Sonoran Desert (Griffen 1969; Whitley 1992; Carolyn Boyd, personal communication, 1993). These Chichimecan hunter-gatherer groups may have shared a common ancestry with the Mimbres as well as with the Classic and Postclassic Mesoamerican societies to the south.
