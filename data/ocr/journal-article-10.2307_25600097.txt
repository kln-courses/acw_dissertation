<plain_text><page sequence="1">JACK ZIPES The Revolutionary Rise of the Romantic Fairy Tale in Germany Most studies of the Romantic fairy tale (Kunstmarchen)1 generally agree that its development marked the beginnings of a new form which broke radically with the traditional folk tale (Volksmdrchen) and con tained the essence of Romantic aesthetic and philosophical theories.2 For the most part these studies have focused on the formal experiments of the Ro mantics and have made careful distinctions between the different kinds of fairy tales. Though this scholarly research has provided valuable insights into the particular intentions and designs of Romantic authors, the underlying socio-historical forces which governed the rise of the fairy tale in the late eighteenth century have not been sufficiently elaborated, and misconcep tions still exist about the meaning and rise of the fairy tale.3 Whatever ap Unless otherwise indicated, all translations in this essay are my own. 1. In order to make a clear-cut distinction between the Volksmdrchen and the Kunst marchen, I shall use the terms "folk tale" and "fairy tale" respectively. For an elaboration of the distinctions between the folk and fairy tale, see my article "Breaking the Magic Spell: Politics and the Fairy Tale," New German Critique, 6 (1975), 114-35. 2.

The profound socio-political impulse behind the creation of the new fairy tales has rarely been accorded its due, and, therefore, most at tempts to develop a theory of the Romantic fairy tale have remained on a formalist descriptive level or have surveyed the idiosyncrasies of a Romantic writer and his fairy tales in sketchy chronological order. It is true that there have also been Jungian and Freudian "plunges"4 into the mysterious depths of the tales. But these research expeditions have been deceptive. In fact, it is almost meaningless to describe them as "research" since they only fish for what their psychological premises dictate. The overall lack of a general the oretical base appropriate to the historical rise of the fairy tale has been evi dent, and this has been unfortunate since the Romantics' contribution to German culture was truly revolutionary in both an aesthetic and political sense. Revolutionary in form, revolutionary in statement. Here we have the basis for comprehending the rise of the Romantic fairy tale in Germany. This does not mean that all fairy tales preached revolution nor that the Ro mantics were all political revolutionaries in disguise. However, this premise does assume that the Romantics were consciously aware of revolutionizing an older form of art under new socio-economic conditions which they per ceived to be problematic. No matter what the individual political or aes thetic bias of a Romantic writer was, all the Romantics sought to contain, comprehend, and comment on the essence of the changing times in and through the fairy tale, and this common goal has stamped the contours of the fairy tale up through the present. To understand the historical rise of the Romantic fairy tale and its ramifi cations for the present, it is necessary to begin developing an adequate theory which accounts for the socio-political aspects in relation to the aesthetics of the tales. Such a task cannot be accomplished in a short essay, and, therefore, the ideas I want to develop in this paper will be confined to two areas. First, I want to discuss the significance of August Nitschke's Soziale Ordnungen im Annales Littitaires de VUniversite de Besancon, 80 (1966). Despite the remarkable analysis of the relationship between the French contes des fees and the German fairy tale, Fink studies this development only as part of a literary tradition and does not consider the relationship of the fairy tale to socio-economic developments. 4. One of the bigger plunges along these lines is Anniela Jaffe's "Bilder und Symbole aus E. T. A. Hofmanns Marchen 'Der goldene Topf,' " Gestaltungen des Unbewussten, ed. C. G. Jung (Zurich: Rasher, 1950), pp. 239-616. This exhaustive and exhausting Jungian study is twice as long as Hoffmann's original tale.</page><page sequence="3">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 411 Spiegel der Marchen5 and Ferenc Feher's "Is the Novel Problematic?"6 for a theoretical comprehension of the revolutionary nature of the German Ro mantic fairy tale in comparison to other pertinent research. Second, I want to synthesize and apply the findings of these studies to several Romantic fairy tales in order to test the validity of my own premises. Neither Nitschke's book nor Feher's essay deals explicitly with the fairy tale. However, their methodological approaches and findings have great relevance for developing a theory about the German Romantic fairy tale. Both are innovative studies about genres related to the fairy tale and provide useful insights for grasping the revolutionizing forms and radical implications of this genre. I The difficulty with most general studies of the German fairy tale is that they do not deal adequately enough with the folk tale. Yet, without a thorough historical grasp of the aesthetics and social significance of the folk tale, it is impossible to develop a theory about the origins and meaning of the fairy tale. This becomes abundantly clear if one reviews the most recent study of the German fairy tale, Narziss an der Quelle, by Hans Schuhmacher.7 There are only eight pages devoted to the pre-history of the fairy tale, and they are limited to a discussion of the French contes des fees and the literary debates about aesthetics in Germany during the eighteenth century.8 Schuhmacher sees these antecedents as important for the Romantic notion of allegories and myths and comes to the following conclusion: While the folk tale is a natural form, lives in a veiled symbolism, neither self-explanatory nor self-conscious, and not only introduces secrets but is a secret unto itself, the romantic fairy tale is in no way a secret unto itself. It only reflects upon such a secret and would like to become one. In other words, it is the product of a certain ideology which bases itself upon and harks back to forgotten, sunken, repressed, and misunder stood traditions. This results from the fact that it seeks to interpret and reevaluate them in a positive new way within the framework of a new future vision of human society. However, since it is, as already stated, a product of art, since it is reflected myth, it loses the binding force of 5- Published in two volumes.

The socio-historical context is ig nored, and art forms seem to have thrived solely upon themselves. In fact, the folk tale was never a secret unto itself, and the fairy tale never sought to become such a secret. Folk tales were consciously created to expound upon natural occurrences and social behavior in an oral tradition that involved participation by the audience which sought clarification of social and natural processes. The meanings of the folk tales were eminently clear to the original audiences. The symbols were significations, and only later did they become "secrets" which remained unlocked until anthropologists and literary scholars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries began unveiling how they related directly to the experiences of primitive peoples who had conceived and cared for them. This change came about as the cultural needs of society changed in the transition from feudalism to capitalism. Thus, the socio cultural basis of the fairy tale is intricately linked to that of the folk tale which must first be defined if a theory about the origins of the fairy tale is to have substantial worth. Numerous scholars have endeavored to situate and clarify the origins of the folk tale,10 but August Nitschke has developed the most convincing method not only for dating the origins of the folk tales but also for defining their socio-historical context. The overall aim of his two-volume study is to demonstrate how the reflections of social orders in the folk tales from the Ice Age through the twentieth century can help us derive prognostications about the capacity of different societies to adjust to the demands of industrializa tion. Neither his prognostications nor the application of his method is of major concern here. What is significant for our understanding of the fairy tale's rise is that Nitschke provides ample evidence to show that 1) the folk tales were part of a socio-historical process and reflected symbolically upon this process revealing how social behavior changed from one historical epoch to the next; 2) these reflections also demonstrated that substantive and con stitutional changes in society did not occur only because there was a change in the mode of production, but that changes in perception, attitude, and be havior could lead to the rise of a new social order; 3) the German folk tale 9.

By establishing the manner in which the folk tale evolved in relation to social attitudes and behavior, Nitschke enables us to grasp why there was a gradual shift from the oral folk tale to the literary fairy tale in eighteenth-century Germany. Moreover, it becomes apparent from the evidence he presents that the fairy tale's radical departure from the folk tale cannot be simply considered a literary phenomenon but is based on a historical transformation of social attitudes and behavior. Since these find ings have great import for a theory of the fairy tale, they need further expli cation. Here only those ideas will be explored which help us understand what the relationship of the folk tale was to the transformation of social behavior and why the folk tale began to yield to the literary fairy tale in the period of transition from feudalism to capitalism. Nitschke borrows research principles from biology, physics, and anthro pology to develop his own method of historical epoch research. Production for him is not the key to societal change. In fact, the purpose of the first volume of his study is to go beyond the traditional Marxist theory of value and base-superstructure analyses in order to seek other historical-sociological factors which may be just as significant in contributing to change in the social order of things as the relations of production. Thus, he uses the dis coveries of biologists to demonstrate that human beings from primitive times to the present, like animals, have ordered themselves in groups accord ing to their mode of behavior. These orders are characterized by autody namics where people depend on their own strength for survival, hetero dynamics where people depend on the help of others for survival, and meta morphosis where people transform themselves for survival. In addition, Nitschke draws upon anthropological studies to show that the behavior in these social orders has a dialectical relationship to the manner in which the people perceive phenomena in regard to time. In other words, people have established different sorts of relationships to their environment depending on whether they have tended to see time as continuity (in which case social torms and figures tend to seem unchangeable), or as having distinct se quences (in which case there is more receptivity to social change), or finally as being characterized by distinct sequences which are significantly parallel in some way (in which case perception of similarities dominates their attitude toward social change). Socialized perception and behavior are crucial in de termining transitions in social orders. The special connection between the behavior of human beings and their socialized mode of perception in relation to time is described as follows: In every order the relation of the temporal parts to another and the re lation of physical bodies to another is of a special kind. Every order in</page><page sequence="6">414 JACK ZIPES which human beings of a society are joined together with the forms (Gestalten) of their environment is correspondingly characterized by a temporal-corporeal arrangement. Since this order originates in the ar rangement of all figures in an environment, it has also been called a con figuration. . . . Human beings impart a different significance to indi vidual movements according to the temporal-corporeal arrangement in which they live. They attribute special importance either to the move ments which confront unchangeable forms or movements which are commensurate with change in a temporal-corporeal arrangement.11 In sum, Nitschke holds that every society in history can be characterized by the way human beings arrange themselves (autodynamics, heterody namics, metamorphosis) and perceive time, and this gives rise to a domi nant activity (also called a line of motion). The perspectives and positions assumed by the members of society toward the dominant activity amount to a configuration. The configuration designates the character of a social order since the temporal-corporeal arrangement is designed around a dom inant activity that shapes the attitudes of the people toward work, educa tion, social development, and death. Hence, the configuration of society is the pattern of arrangement and rearrangement of social behavior related to a socialized mode of perception. It has its analogue in paintings and folk tales because they are dependent on the same socialized mode of perception. In the folk tale the temporal-corporeal arrangement reflects whether there are perceived to be new possibilities for participation in the social order or whether there must be a confrontation when possibilities for change do not exist. Thus, the most important factors deciding whether there could be participation or confrontation in primitive societies were not necessarily the modes of labor but social attitudes and behavior which depended on how the people perceived things. For example, in the early Ice Age, animals were considered sacred as they were the prime source of the maintenance and re production of society. The activity of the members of society was governed chiefly by their perception of animals and their attitude toward them. Con sequently, their behavior assumed a line of motion (action) which illustrated the high priority given to the animals. The corporeal-temporal arrangement of this period was stamped by the positions all human beings and things as sumed with respect to the hunting, caring, killing, and worshiping of ani mals. The social configuration was reflected in paintings and folk tales where the lines of motion were predicated on attitudes toward animals. Nitschke shows in his discussion of wall paintings and Indian folk tales and other tales like Van den Machandelboom and Die Hochzeit zwischen Tier und Mensch that 11. Nitschke, Soziale Ordnungen im Spiegel der Marchen, n, 19. Hereafter all page references will be made in the text.</page><page sequence="7">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 415 animals had an elevated position in the Ice Age. The tales show that people felt vitalized, strengthened, and powerful by being close to animals. The large animals endowed human beings with a feeling of strength and vitality, and the actions of animals were imitated in cults showing how human beings sought contact with animals and depended on them for the continuation of the society. As primitive peoples in the Ice and Megalithic Ages began to perceive the relations between themselves and things and time in a different light and to desire change, they transformed their behavior, thereby causing a temporal-corporeal rearrangement which imparted new meaning to the social order. This often occurred without the mode of production's being changed. Thus, positions assumed by human beings by acting upon their new awareness led to placing priorities on another dominant activity which allowed for fulfilling new needs and desires. Power was endowed in a class or group of people who might best facilitate the achievement of the desired goals of the society, or who, at least, made it appear that they could help everyone achieve those goals. The modes of behavior cause human beings to develop the structure of a society in which they can match the desired behavior. This leads them to accord women a dominant influence in society at a certain time. In the case of the early Indo-Germans, the ruling class was accorded the decisive role whereas the later Indo-Germans accorded the warriors the decisive role. This decision influences then the social hierarchy. Of course, there are also other factors which have an impact on social struc tures such as the economy, climate, and geographical location. How ever, what is more significant?and often underestimated?is the desire of a society to be able to realize a behavior which allows for new simi larities and, along with that, for new connections between things being perceived and to the same degree offers the possibilities for confronta tion crucial for life or for participation in changes crucial for life, (i, 193) By studying and comparing the socially determined configurations in the folk tales of the Ice Age, Megalithic Period, and the Indo-Germanic Epoch, Nitschke demonstrates that changes in behavioral attitudes (toward the social function of animals and women) were more important for historical transi tions in the social order than work, climate, or geography. For instance, he takes such tales as The Twelve Brothers, The Seven Ravens, and The Six Swans and demonstrates how they reflect a situation in the late Ice Age when the attitude toward women was assuming a more significant role than the at titude toward animals in the hunting and grazing society and women were considered the key in providing participation and integration in society. In contrast to the previous period (when hunting and grazing were also the dominant modes of production and animals were considered central for the</page><page sequence="8">416 JACK ZIPES preservation of society) women were now worshiped as the guardians of culture who provided for the maintenance and continuation of life. The change in attitudes and behavior toward women led to matrilineal societies in which the intercession of the women allowed for participation and develop ment in society. All of this is substantiated by comparing the similarities and differences in the art objects, folk tales, and social activities of peoples from one historical epoch to the next. Nitschke's findings are significant in that he convincingly overturns mech anistic Marxist theories which have continuously insisted that it is a change in the relations of production or market conditions which determines and ac counts for a change in the social order. Though he does not discuss impor tant factors as class struggle and ideological determination, thereby mini mizing Marxist theories of historical development, he still does attribute a crucial role to production and the market in defining a social order, but they are not always primary. This is essential for understanding the change from the folk tale to the fairy tale, which reflects a change in the social order of Germany in the eighteenth century while the same type of agrarian produc tion remains dominant. The move from absolutism to enlightened mon archy or constitutional monarchy in eighteenth-century Germany did not arise because there was a change in the mode of production or market condi tions but because the behavior and attitudes of the Germans based on theories and the perception of time, free will, rationalism, the natural man, and revo lution led to a conflict with the dominant activity of the older social order which had to be opened up for more participation on the part of the bour geoisie.12 As Nitschke has demonstrated, the change in social attitudes and modes of behavior can forge a new temporal-corporeal arrangement or con figuration which imbues the historical epoch with new meaning. At the end of the eighteenth century a new configuration emerged which established favorable preconditions for the rise of the industrial society. Hence, the period was endowed with a new meaning in this config uration. Like all living phenomena, human beings could experience a change in the future. Thus, hope was born that social conditions could become better in the future. Owing to this basic attitude, Europeans be gan preparing themselves ever since the end of the eighteenth century to deny themselves in the present for the future they hoped to realize. With the help of this "inner worldly asceticism," industrialization could be accomplished in an ideal way. To put it simply, human beings 12. See Helmut Bohme, Prolegomena zu einer Sozial und Wirtschaftsgeschichte Deutsch lands im 19. und 20.Jahrhundert (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1968), and Henri Brun schwig, Enlightenment and Romanticism in Eighteenth-Century Prussia (Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 1974).</page><page sequence="9">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 417 refused to make use of capital gains to set up a pleasant or comfortable life. Instead they used them to build up branches of industrial produc tion for the purpose of attaining more favorable living conditions in later times. . . . Human beings switched to the new industrial produc tion technology only when they took for granted that a sacrifice in the present would bring a better future. In turn this presupposed that they were in the new configuration and thus generally believed that the con ditions on earth could change. Whoever did not share in this view of the world was not ready to work in an industry which produced for a future. The fact that this form of society was able to institute itself so quickly is attributable to the Europeans' autodynamic mode of behavior on their own continent and in America, (n, 157-58) Here the autodynamic mode of behavior needs more explanation. In his examination of the folk tales in various historical epochs, Nitschke was able to observe three distinct dynamic forms of action developed by protagonists. As we have seen, these forms of action are significant in that they are related to the modes of behavior which social groups evolved to defend themselves, prevail over others, or to assert themselves. In this respect one can talk about autodynamics in a folk tale where the fate of a hero depends on himself, het erodynamics where the hero is dependent on another figure for survival, and metamorphosis where the hero undergoes a change to have an impact beyond his life. On the basis of the social and artistic configurations in given epochs, Nitschke studies and compares samples of tales from different countries to determine the major characteristics of a particular culture. For example, most protagonists in the German folk tale are autodynamic, and they gener ally rise in social class at the end. For the most part, the rise or self-assertion is made possible not so much because of a struggle (Kampf) but because of industriousness (Tiichtigkeit). The industrious action in and by itself is not the means by which the protagonist rises; rather the efforts made by the protagonist to show his or her industrious nature and reliability bring recog nition and reward. In other words, "the German variants of the tales demand from their listeners?for a long time peasants and craftsmen?that they pur sue their lightly regarded activities in an industrious and orderly way even in difficult situations. They promise a marriage that will bring happiness, wealth, and social prestige" (p. 31). These acute observations about the dis tinct nature of the German folk tales are most significant when we con sider that the Germans have been susceptible to authoritarian governments and have a long history of accommodating themselves to the demands of the upper classes, i.e., a long history of servility and of reliance on state authoritarianism. If we carry Nitschke's conclusions about the characteristics of the German</page><page sequence="10">418 JACK ZIPES folk tale one step further, it becomes more clear why (almost out of his torical necessity) the fairy tale was bound to develop. The new social order which received its contours from the Age of Enlightenment could not be depicted in folk tales which had evolved from primitive times and had be come centered in form and content on the concerns of feudalism.13 Although it is true, as Nitschke has shown, that the German folk-tale type stressing the virtue of industriousness for rising in social station continued to exist up through the twentieth century, this oral folk-tale tradition remained tied to the agrarian pursuits of the peasantry and feudal notions and faded in social significance as the need for change in social behavior was perceived and acted upon by the dominant groups in German society. Along with the institutionalization of the ideas of the Enlightenment, the way was pre pared for the development of free-market enterprise and capitalist produc tion. The new configuration in Germany of the eighteenth century encom passed the economic changes made in England and France and brought forth cultural forms of art and music more commensurate with the needs and behavior of the age, among them the Kunstmarchen or fairy tale. Created largely by bourgeois writers of the eighteenth century, the fairy tale tran scended the folk tale in Germany by showing how autodynamics could give rise to a new world that breaks radically with the norms of an older, more confining social order. In this respect the fairy tale corresponded to the growing needs of an audience which was becoming more literate, enlight ened, emancipated, and assertive. In its early phase the fairy tale reflected conflict, in other words, the lack of room in society or the lack of real pos sibilities for social participation desired by talented members of the bour geois intelligentsia who wanted to create something new and questioned all existing institutions. Out of this conflict or chaos, the Romantics sought to open up society, to develop ideas and lines of motion based on a progressive Utopian notion and the longing for non-alienating conditions of existence. Thus, the aesthetic design had its point of departure in the gradual forma tion of a new social configuration stamped by the Enlightenment, particu larly by the awareness and attitude that human beings had the free will to rationally determine their destinies. Consequently, the aesthetics of the fairy tale, derived in large part from the folk tale, were imbued with a revolu tionary sense that originated in the behavioral and material changes of the social order. Such studies on the aesthetics of the folk tale as the recent ones by Volker Klotz and Max Luthi14 miss the mark because they reduce the 13- Cf. my article "Breaking the Magic Spell: Politics and the Fairy Tale" and Linda Degh, Erzdhler und Erzdhlgemeinschaft (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1962). 14.

For some other important works by Liithi, see: Das europdische Volksmdrchen, Form und Wesen (Bern:</page><page sequence="11">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 419 contents of the tales to an amalgamation of aesthetic principles derived from the dominant structural features of the tales from all epochs. Their disregard of sociology and history in developing their aesthetics of the folk tale makes their efforts at explaining the meaning of patterns, style, and configurations questionable in light of Nitschke's historical epoch research. In sum, Nitschke's study illustrates the historical dynamics between social processes and artistic creation. His focus on the configurations within the society and their reflection in the tales during different historical epochs makes clear that the allegedly indecipherable magic and symbols of folk tales are decipherable and that the key to their interpretation lies in grasping social attitudes and behavior. Important to note is that the tales were never meant to mystify or enchant listeners for the purpose of leaving them in an enthralled state of reverence for the supernatural. Folk tales consciously made and make sense. They served to clarify the socialization process and problems of social conflict and participation. Though Nitschke never discusses the relationship of the folk tale to the fairy tale, it was apparent that by the end of the eighteenth century?and here he does talk about the new configura tion?the changes wrought by ideas and attitudes of the Enlightenment ren dered the oral folk tale as such inadequate to reflect and explain the new style and content of that period. The gradual rearrangement of temporal and corporeal elements under enlightened rulers which prepared the way for industrialization altered artistic production and themes, and the new so cial configuration burst the seams of the more traditional folk tale. The con solidation of middle-class attitudes and the incipient development of capi talist technology provided the impetus and subject matter for writers to create something new out of an antiquated form. In addition, we must con sider the increased rate of literacy, the vast development of publishing, and the growth of a bourgeois public sphere to understand why the Romantics seized upon the fairy tale as a form to convey their visions of a new social order. The Romantic fairy tale, particularly in Germany, was the outcome of attempts by educated writers beginning with the Italians Straparola and Basile in the sixteenth century and Perrault and writers of the cabinet des fees in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to appropriate a popular or folk form of art for a new middle-class reading public. These appropriations as sumed different aesthetic shapes and had different ideological tendencies and implications, but the process depended on one common factor: the temporal corporeal social order was being rearranged in the transition from absolut Francke, 1947); Volksmdrchen und Volkssage (Bern: Francke, 1961); Marchen (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1962); Es war einmal. . . Vom Wesen des Volksmarchens (Gottingen: Vanden hoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1962), which has been translated into English as Once upon a Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales, trans. Lee Chadeayne and Paul Gottwald (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1970).</page><page sequence="12">420 JACK ZIPES ism to enlightened absolutism and early forms of bourgeois hegemony and capitalism. In Germany, the impact of the rearrangement was greatest about the time of the French Revolution and in the period following this. It was during this epoch that the Romantic fairy tale as Kunstmarchen developed as a fully autonomous genre, i.e., an artistic form which took as its innate sub stance the material conditions of the time. Given the rearrangement of the temporal-corporeal social order and discernible trends toward industriali zation, the material conditions influenced the particular perspective and form of the Romantic fairy tale, setting it apart from the folk tale. Once it is recognized that the fairy tale is not only a diachronic product of a literary tradition which began orally in the Ice Age but also the result of a socio historical process that gives artistic expression to the revolutionary condi tions in Europe of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we can begin to develop an appropriate theory and method to grasp the reasons for the rise of this new genre. II Any theory about the rise of the Romantic fairy tale in Germany must con cern itself with the question why the Kunstmarchen seized the imagination of Romantic writers and why it became a prevailing form to express the con cerns of the Romantics at that particular point in history. Novalis elevated the fairy tale to the "Canon of poesie as it were?everything must be like a fairy tale."15 Almost all Romantic writers were drawn to the fairy tale and experimented with this form in highly original ways. In fact, it became so ingrained in the German literary tradition that there is hardly a major Ger man writer since the beginning of the nineteenth century who has not in some manner used or created a fairy tale up through the present. All the more reason to ground our theory historically in the material conditions of the late eighteenth century. Before examining the relevance of Feher's essay "Is the Novel Problem atic?" for such a theory, I want to remark on two recent studies which touch upon the original project and impetus of the German Romantics in con ceiving fairy tales. By project I mean the manner in which the Romantics desired to project a vision of reality upon the world utilizing a particular art form in order to elucidate the ambivalent reality of their ontological situa tion and the social forces acting upon them. Jens Tismar sums up this project succinctly: The poetical function of the romantic fairy tales should be understood as a social one. .. . The apparent or symbolically encoded reference to the contemporary social reality is linked to a reflection about the disparity 15- Werke und Briefe, ed. Alfred Kelletat (Munich: Winkler, 1962), p. 505.</page><page sequence="13">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 421 with original conditions. On the basis of reality the fairy tale and folk song appear transparent to the conditions. The major focus of many romantic fairy tales centers on the attempt to imagine non-alienating world conditions?fairy tale is the "code" for this?with an innocence which is achieved again through reflection and by the effort to con ceive the split in the world as (at least partially) reconcilable without forgetting that this conception is literature.16 Claus Trager has gone beyond Tismar in providing us with a broader frame work in which to situate the Romantic fairy tale. He sees the origins and direction of Romanticism in general emanating from . . . the futile struggle around the problem to provide non-alienating work and to secure the development of human individuality. One must keep in mind this positive critical premise which was common to all progressive humanitarian thinking of the time in order to gain a sense at the same time of the anti-bourgeois, bourgeois-humanitarian essence of Romanticism. Before and along with the early German Romantics, the best thinkers of the continent were challenged by the same phenom enon: the development of capitalist division of labor and its conse quences for the integrity of human beings. The essence of the Romantic world view is tied to this unresolved problematic. More than anything else, this reveals the genuine Utopian character of the Romantic models for a life worth living in a most profound manner.17 Although Trager resorts to political doctrine borrowed from Lenin to prove how the German Romantics' subjective class position ultimately led them to conceive of reactionary Utopias which did not serve the progressive visionary needs of the working class, his essay is most useful for defining the dilemma of the German Romantics. No matter what became of German Romanticism, it began as a progres sive avant-garde literary movement. Its thrust not only depended on a nega tion of the philistine substance and life style of the emerging bourgeoisie and a protest against the utilitarian ordering of life to further industry but it was also a reaction against the backward feudal ideology and conditions of au thoritarianism. This is most explicit in the manner in which the Romantics supported the principles of the French Revolution,18 a point which Trager forgets when he tries to define the Romantics as regressive, i.e., turning away from reality to construct impossible dreams of self-realization which i6.

On the contrary, the Romantics?and here distinctions must be made?could not avoid the ambivalence of their situation: caught between the critique of the philistine quality of their own middle class and a critique of the decadence of the nobility and faced with a transi tional period when neither peasants nor workers constituted a united revo lutionary force in Germany, the Romantics conceived artistic forms to clarify the social limitations of personal freedom and to imagine possible situations in which subjective fulfillment might be reinforced by objective conditions that lead to creativity, love, and equality. The topos of the golden age had a socio-psychological significance for them which was intended both to af firm their radical visions and critiques and to compensate for the voids in their everyday lives.19 There is a fine line dividing escapism and progressive utopianism in the other-worldly constructs of the Romantics. But I think one misses the point if one assumes that the Romantics actually believed they could escape their real situations in fairy tales or project feasible models for future worlds. The struggle to conceive a "golden age," another world, was the struggle to detach themselves from an ambivalent situation in order to gain perspective for change. The locus of this ambivalent situation was the period in which they were most creative: 1796-1816?from revolution to restoration. Their work was marked and marred by a transitional change in German society from feudalism to early capitalism: the changing con tours of the French Revolution from emancipatory movement to nationalist militancy and dictatorship; the constant wars on German soil; the introduc tion and enforcement of the Code Napoleon in the Rhineland; the reduction of over 300 principalities to 80; the continual censorship of the art, journals, newspapers, etc.; the changing loyalties of the German states; the growth of the German military and bureaucracy; the improvement and spread of early capitalist technology; the philosophical pursuit of principles of the Enlight enment as well as their betrayal and perversion?all these factors influenced to some degree the substance and form of the Romantic project. Certainly? and this is the most significant factor?the emancipation of the individual, eagerly sought by the Enlightenment writers of the eighteenth century, be came fraught with difficulties by the end of the eighteenth century since it was no longer possible to assume that the individual could posit himself or herself in the world and become at one with it. This again points to the quandary of the Romantic writer: the overcoming of alienating conditions 19. Cf. H.-J. Heiner, "Das 'goldene Zeitalter' in der deutschen Romantik. Zur sozial psychologischen Funktion eines Topos," Zeitschriftfiir deutsche Philologie, 91 (1972), 206 34. Also interesting for its historical presentation of the literary development of this topos is Hans-Joachim MahPs Die Idee desgoldenen Zeitalters im Werk des Novalis: Studien zur Wesenbestimmung der fruhromantischen Utopie und zu ihren ideengeschichtlichen Voraus setzungen (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1965).</page><page sequence="15">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 423 for self-development and social emancipation could not be accomplished while the socio-political changes fostered conditions which led to the reifi cation of the individual, i.e., the production and use of human beings as (though they were) tools and commodities. Ironically, the Romantics had to attack the Enlightenment to try to enrich and fulfill its legacy of hu manitarianism. This quandary has been examined in detail by Henri Brunschwig, who has remarked on how difficult it was for the Romantics as children of the Enlightenment to pursue their goals when the conservative forces in power primarily made use of the Enlightenment to maintain their own power.20 Thus, the Romantic attack on the Enlightenment was in actuality an attack on the betrayal of the Enlightenment: The interest of the first Romantic generation lies in the fact that it brings together the typical representatives of a transitional generation hesitat ing between two different modes of thought (i.e., the Enlightenment and romanticism). This hesitation originates in the social crisis, which casts doubt on the validity of the promises of the Aufklarung. The young dissidents, assembled by chance in the most tolerant and most liberal capital in Europe, believe that the time has come to transform a society which has proved incapable of absorbing them. They proclaim a new era; they are to be its founders, and, worthy ideologues and disciples of the Aufklarung that they are, they harness themselves to a gigantic task which they try to perform simultaneously in thought and action. ... In Prussia the young are consciously revolutionaries, however, and not from the political standpoint alone, on ground where opposition to the existing regime is common, but even more so in the realm of morals; their aim is to destroy the old world in order to create a new. They form a party of the revolution, which they envisage in the broadest sense. All the institutions of the society into which they were born?religion, morals, politics, and art?must disappear.21 The ambivalent situation of the Romantics who sought a progressive transformation of modes of living, thinking and political systems is reflected in the art forms they developed, and this ambivalence has been most thor oughly studied by Ferenc Feher in "Is the Novel Problematic?" His main points which have a bearing for the theory of the Romantic fairy tale will be examined here. Feher's essay has a twofold purpose: to criticize Georg Lukacs' Theory of the Novel and at the same time to develop his own theory 20. Enlightenment and Romanticism in Eighteenth-Century Prussia. Though he concen trates largely on Prussia, his remarks have great validity for the entire Romantic move ment. 21. Ibid., pp. 244-45.</page><page sequence="16">424 JACK ZIPES from the critique. In contrast to Lukacs, who saw the rise of the novel as problematic because it could not (like the epic) provide resolution, Feher is more positive and incisive about the origins and future of the novel because he does not hold to a formal ideali2ation of the more classical epic, nor does he claim that the depiction of totality within a harmonious structure con tains superior moral and aesthetic values per se. The novel's "formlessness" and "prosaic character" corresponds struc turally to the formless and chaotic progress through which bourgeois society annihilated the first islands of realized human substance, while also generating a major development of the powers of the species. Thus, the novel expresses a stage in human emancipation not only in its con tent, i.e., in the notions of collectivity structured by its categories, but also in its form. The form of the novel could not have come into being without the appearance of the categories of "purely social" society, and the birth of this society is an enrichment, even if we take into account the unequal evolution it produces.22 Feher does not call the form of the novel problematic but rather focuses on the objective problems caused by a change in the socio-economic system which provided a great measure of human emancipation on the one hand and led to capitalist forms of reification and fetishism on the other. Thus, it is the ambivalence of early capitalism which constitutes the nature of the novel: Methodologically, all of this forces the general analysis of the novel as a new epic genre equal to the classical epic to develop "on two fronts." First, in a detailed confrontation with the classical epic, it must prove that the novel entails an increase in emancipation, in spite of the loss of the specificity and the formal symmetry of the epic. Secondly, it must show the ambivalence and the striving for autonomy of those elements that within the framework of the bourgeois social phenomenon can no longer achieve high artistic fulfillment_The novel is born in a society without community; the structure of its world is not communal. The world of the novel is not substantial (to use the term of The Theory of the Novel). It is dominated by the duality of the Self and the external world. This duality means that the individual is neither the direct personifica tion of the prevalent forces in the described sphere of existence, nor are the self-objectifications of the hero immediately given, in forms that can be appropriated and used. This is the source of dilemmas, but it is not in principle "problematic." (pp. 50-51) 22. "Is the Novel Problematic?" p. 48. Hereafter all page references will be cited in the text.</page><page sequence="17">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 425 After making this argument, Feher examines those aspects of the novel which reflect its ambivalent nature: the drive of the protagonist to build his or her own world, the duality of the self and its environment, the exclu sion of the public sphere, the role of coincidence, and the fortuitous indi vidual. Essentially he sees all bourgeois novels which can be considered sig nificant (i.e., which make a cultural contribution) asking one basic, crucial question: "What can man make of himself?" The very fact that the novel can envision (in contrast to the epic) the possibility of a human being's con trolling his or her own destiny "represents a humanizing element that goes beyond the function fulfilled by the epic" (p. 67). Moreover, in direct re lation to the Age of Enlightenment and the growth of free-market enter prise, the novel problematizes the pursuit of freedom by the individual whose choices and alternatives are governed by accidents of competition and strug gle and by the quality of his or her activity. Hence, Feher uses the term "for tuitous" to describe the modern protagonist whose actions are governed by chance. One could pose the central problem of the novel in this way: the fortuitous individual is fated to be free in a realm where freedom is illusory. The education of the hero in regard to the conditions of socialization in a fetishized world also allows for making the consciousness of the reader more aware about the processes determining the alternatives for the making of one self in the actual world. The structure of the novel is governed then by the dialectic of what is predestined and what can be changed within the limits of a predestined framework of activity. Resolution of the contradiction be tween emancipation and reification in the novel is predicated on socio economic forces which are constantly changing and moving to constitute a new form of the epic. For the present, the achievement of the novel lies in its refusal to give harmonious form to incongruities and disparities which beset the individual's drive to realize a world with non-alienating conditions. The rise of the bourgeois novel roughly parallels the rise of the literary fairy tale in Europe. Certainly in Germany the Romantic fairy tale assumes a function in relation to the folk tale and the needs of the emerging bour geois class as did the novel in relation to the epic and the interests of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, much of what Feher has written about the novel is applicable to the fairy tale. Naturally, there are generic distinctions to be made, but it will be helpful to outline where his ideas are applicable and where they might inform a theory of the Romantic fairy tale. First of all, the Romantic fairy tale is a thorough confrontation with the "classical" folk tale and demonstrates that there is an increase of human emancipation in the fairy tale despite the loss of formal symmetry and social harmony contained in the folk tale. The formlessness of the tale itself and ac tivity of the major protagonist, a fortuitous individual, indicate this. Whereas one marvels at the tightly-knit aesthetic composition and clear purpose of</page><page sequence="18">426 JACK ZIPES folk tales which allow for "happy" and "beautiful resolutions," one is taken aback by the formlessness, apparent lack of design, and open-endedness of the Romantic fairy tale. Perhaps one should say "challenged." Indeed, the Romantic fairy tale is a challenge to the folk tale and to the reader as well. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the Romantic fairy tale is revolu tionary. It explodes the tightly-knit composition of the more feudal-oriented folk tale to articulate the needs and tastes of a bourgeois avant-garde critical both of the archaic nature of feudal societies and of the utilitarian rationalism of the emerging bourgeoisie. The boundlessness of its form and the open problematic endings suggest possibilities for human emancipation which could be realized in worlds (utopias) where creativity and eros are honored. What is striking about the Romantic fairy tale in its inception is that the Romantics play off the folk-tale symbols, motifs, and themes to transcend the conservative notions of both the nobility and bourgeoisie. This is why the early Romantics became so critical of Goethe and Schiller, who abandoned their earlier, more radical Sturm und Drang positions and sought to integrate their progressive notions within the institutions of the enlightened aristoc racy. Novalis' Klingsohr Marchen was in part a radical response to Goethe's Marchen and a Utopian effort to transcend the confining institutions of aris tocratic and bourgeois conservatism. The same can be said about the early endeavors of Wackenroder and Novalis and the later fairy tales of Brentano, Eichendorff, and Hoffmann with some qualifications. Certainly it is possible to argue from FeheVs point of view that the Romantic fairy tale was bound to develop on two fronts: 1) in confrontation with the traditional folk tale; 2) in conflict with the exploitative tendencies and interests of the German bourgeoisie in collusion with the aristocracy.23 Here it is important that we become more specific than Feher and point out the peculiar German nature of the Romantic dilemma. In describing the national character of the Germans, particularly the German bourgeoisie, Marxists have often used the term Misere to refer to the wretched way the German third estate became crippled during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and divided against itself. The result was that, unlike the French and British, the German middle classes sought ways of compromise with the nobility which would enable them to share in the government and safeguard their vested interests. Ultimately, these compromises led to the bourgeoisie's dependence on the state, no matter what form it took, and to the perversion 23.

Rudolf Vierhaus and Manfred Botzenhart (Miinster: Aschendorff, 1966), pp. 337-60, and Giinter Birtsch, "Zur sozialen und politischen Rolle des deutschen, vornehmilch preussischen Adels am Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts," Der Adel vor der Revolution, ed. Rudolf Vierhaus (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1971), pp. 77-95.</page><page sequence="19">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 427 of the bourgeois public sphere.24 Characteristic of the German bourgeoisie was its effort through industriousness (Tuchtigkeit), duty, and morality to establish a public sphere consisting of institutionalized structures which fa cilitated rational discourse in a formal democratic manner, i.e., public as semblies, schools, theaters, journals, meeting places, etc. The formation of the bourgeois public sphere at the end of the eighteenth century was a positive re sult of the bourgeois movement for Enlightenment, but, at the same time, the manner in which it was established also indicated how the ideas of the Enlightenment would be betrayed. Not revolution but compromise and accommodation were the decisive building blocks of the German bourgeois public sphere. The middle-class patricians, guildsmen, entrepreneurs, and intelligentsia generally sided with the nobility to maintain the interests of monarchical rule and to repress the uprisings of peasants, apprentices, and journeymen. Undoubtedly, the conservative movement of the bourgeoisie and nobility was enhanced when the Revolution was turned into a dictator ship in France. The Napoleonic Wars enabled the ruling classes to make it seem that the French were at the root of the German people's oppression, and they made false promises of democratic rule and participation to the people if they would fight against their French "oppressors." In any case, the role played by the German bourgeoisie during the Romantic period was one which led to the stabilization of the society in transition from late feudal ism to early capitalism and a reinforcement of aristocratic rule. As Helmut Bohme has noted, Germany experienced the Enlightenment only as absolutism, and that had its consequences. Above all, it was due to "enlightened absolutism" that the spark of 1789 did not set off an explosion in Germany. As con vinced supporters of governmental reforms, members of the third estate did not desire a radical altercation with the nobility and church. They wanted?mindful of the efforts by the princes to eliminate the worst conditions of the ancien regime by themselves?a constitutional monarchy in which the government provided for possibilities to develop industry, kept the priests in check, irrigated swamplands, built state schools, took care of the poor, protected the poor against the rich, the peasants against the aristocrats, and the industrious against those people who inherited wealth. In other words, they wanted a bureaucratic state (Beamtenstaat) 24. For a discussion of the meaning of the public sphere, see Jiirgen Habermas, Struk turwandel der Offentlichkeit (Berlin: Luchterhand, 1962), and "The Public Sphere," New German Critique, 3 (1974), 49-55. See also Peter Hohendahl's "Introduction to Haber mas* The Public Sphere," in the same issue of New German Critique, pp. 45-48.</page><page sequence="20">428 JACK ZIPES which was not to be run in a corrupt way but according to "rational" principles.25 Bohme makes it clear that, although the industrial revolution was not as fully developed in Germany as it was in England and France, the socio economic conditions in Germany were not "underdeveloped." They were different, and the difference depended on how the middle classes absorbed and elaborated the principles of the Enlightenment and developed them within a system of absolutism. Thus, while the principal mode of produc tion remained agrarian in the eighteenth century, social attitudes and be havior in the urban centers of the German principalities changed and caused a shift in the social order to enlightened monarchy and a gradual change in industrial technology. This transition from feudalism to capitalism was not marked in Germany by a violent coup d'etat as in England and France. Nev ertheless, the German states could not have functioned socially and eco nomically at the end of the eighteenth century without giving the bour geoisie more privileges, and, as the third estate assumed more control and authority in the regulated states of the princes, the economic conditions for a "better future" under industrial capitalism were being sown. The profit motive and accumulation of capital by the bourgeois class were justified by a utilitarian rationalism (as opposed to the real egalitarian principles of the Enlightenment) and by a hypocritical moralism buffered by the Protestant work ethos which received full articulation in the family novels of this pe riod, the plays by Iffland and Kotzebue, and the didactic stories which were being widely distributed. The energies and capacities of the divided and dis united German people were harnessed by "bureaucratic states" in the name of nationalism and freedom to oppose the tyranny of the French or some outside invader, but in actuality the emancipation bestowed upon the people by the "enlightened aristocrats" from above with the help of the bourgeoisie led to new forms of enslavement. The German Romantics were bent on exposing both the new and old forms of enslavement. This is not to say that they had the concerns of the common people at heart. But there is a tendency to forget (especially among critics who like to debunk them) that the Romantics were in their early phase socially concerned artists,26 who generally supported the principles of the French Revolution, often wrote essays, articles, or statements about the state, received legal training, and assumed positions which made it impera tive that they concern themselves with debates about government. Aside 25. Prolegomena zu einer Sozial und Wirtschaftsgeschichte Deutschlands im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, p. 23. 26. Cf. Brunschwig, Enlightenment and Romanticism in Eighteenth-Century Prussia, pp. 223-45.</page><page sequence="21">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 429 from vocational training and pursuits, the French Revolution, the Napo leonic Wars, and changing governments all contributed to the conception of Utopias in their works which must be considered as critical reflections of ex isting conditions. Since the folk tale inevitably dealt with power and how to order one's life within a realm that greatly resembled a medieval hierarchy, it was natural for the Romantics to reutilize this genre for their own pur poses, particularly because they wanted to clarify for themselves the am bivalent situation which caused them so much distress. It is foolish to think of the Romantics as escapists. Their distress was tied to the common wretch edness of the German people, and they sought to strike a common chord to which the German people might respond. In the tradition of the Sturm und Drang writers, the Romantics' literary protest was not made solely in their own behalf but also expressed the needs of the oppressed. Their efforts were made in the name of the German national bourgeois movement which failed to realize its revolutionary potential that had been discharged by the En lightenment. Nevertheless, the folk tale itself was revolutionized to enable the Roman tics to depict the ambivalent nature of the rise of enlightened ideas, ratio nalism, and free enterprise. This undertaking was both conscious and un conscious and represented one of the major accomplishments of the Ro mantics. From an aesthetic point of view, the Romantic fairy tale was con ceived for a small bourgeois reading public, and it was intended to question and problematize the state of the reader, i.e., the reader's objective and sub jective situation. The length and form of a tale was arbitrary as long as the tale took as its point of departure a folk tale or another type of Kunstmarchen. The composition of each fairy tale had its roots in the social configuration of that period. Obviously, then, each tale demands its own specific analysis be cause its contours are historically marked. Given the subtle literary dimen sion and the degree of historical specificity, the fairy tale cannot be changed and remoulded the same way that the oral folk tale has been. In other words, it may have timeless or universal qualities like the folk tale, but its historical origins inform and even limit in a positive way its universal appeal. The Ro mantic fairy tale marks a historical rupture in form and content in literary tradition. The subjective stance of the author vis-a-vis the changes of this pe riod sets the mood and dis-position of the tale. What is remarkable about the rise of the fairy tale is that valid generalizations can still be made despite their singular qualities. These generalizations reveal the extent to which the Romantic authors participated in and contributed to an avant-garde experi ment. Beginning with the pattern of the Romantic tale, we can note the follow ing characteristics which distinguish it from the folk tale, l) Though there is no prescribed form or style for a fairy tale, most use a folk tale or another</page><page sequence="22">430 JACK ZIPES fairy tale as a point of departure to give expression to the social configura tion of the time. Most styles are informed by the social configuration and audience expectations and are open-ended if not problematical. 2) The nar rative is often multi-dimensional in contrast to the one-dimensional con crete perspective of the folk tale. The impossibility of bridging the gap be tween self and existence is stressed. This heightens the antagonistic dualities which reflect the major themes of loneliness, alienation, and fetishism. 3) To announce the emancipation of the self, the fulfillment of the Enlighten ment's struggle, the fairy tale puts the unusual potential of the imagination on display. In contrast to the sparse description of the folk tale, there is a more elaborate portrayal of inner and outer worlds, unusual use of color schemes, and the reversal of the traditional stock requisites of the folk tale. The reversal and reutilization of traditional requisities are intended to es trange the reader: to make the familiar appear strange so that the reader will be compelled to take a more critical and creative approach to daily life. 4) The protagonist, generally a male, is displaced, becomes homeless in a world without community. His goal is to transcend the alienating world, i.e., to seek or even create a new world more conducive to his needs. The protag onist is often an artist. At the very least he is associated with creativity. The creative nature of the protagonist, the potential of the individual to develop naturally, is in danger of being confined, regulated, or manipulated. The quest of the hero, his course of movement, is characterized by an active question ing of what makes man, which suggests its reverse: how can man make so ciety so that man knows and controls the forces acting upon him? The goal of the fairy tale is humanistic but not in a vague sense. It is specific and con crete in its anthropomorphic concern. At a time when the human relations constituting the order of work and play were being administered, ratio nalized, and instrumentalized in preparation for a new mode of industrial pro duction, the Romantics sought to humanize society by revealing the dangers of a growing reification (Verdinglichung) and opposing those oppressive forces which blocked self-development and self-government. The bourgeois hero of the Romantic fairy tale is by no means a revolutionary, but he does rep resent the ultimate human refusal to become a cog in the wheel of growing state regulation, industrialization, and bureaucratization. 5) Rarely is there a happy end to a Romantic fairy tale, and if so, it is not envisioned on this earth but in another world. The other-worldly Utopia offers both a critique of and alternative to conditions in the real world of the author and reader. 6) The configuration of conflict and unbridgeable duality suggests, to return to Nitschke, that participation in the socialization process has become dif ficult and that confrontation is necessary to allow for human development. The configuration reveals the ambivalence of the new temporal-corporeal arrangement. New space is provided for the protagonist to move, and time</page><page sequence="23">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 431 is uplifted for him to become master of his destiny, but the temporal and corporeal relationships confine the emancipation within state-administered, socio-economic conditions of enlightened monarchical rule. The protago nist is often asked to sell himself in some manner to a repressive, regulated social order, to sell out, to abandon his true worth. Whatever the case may be, he is pitted against demeaning and dehumanizing forces. His resistance remains the key to understanding the revolutionary impulse of the Romantic fairy tale. Ill As the literary fairy tale broke away from the folk tale and assumed its own proper form during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries in Europe, it set certain parameters within which the Romantics worked. In other words, despite the great differences among the Romantic writers in terms of their style, concerns, and ideologies, they commonly took part in developing a new genre which had its roots in the changing social configu ration which stamped the character of the social order in its transition from feudalism to early capitalism. Thus, they shared formally in revolutionizing an older art form and substantively reflected on the new social configuration through the new form of the fairy tale. In particular, as artists or, to be more exact, as professional writers who were confronted by the breakdown of the feudal patronage system they received little financial support from the bour geois publishing enterprises which replaced feudal patronage. Hence they be came acutely aware of the ambivalence of freedom when the socio-economic forces set new standards of production which drove these artists to the mar gins of society.27 Not that they led what one might call marginal existences, but they came up against, were confronted by and confronted, the solid margins of the new social configuration. Utilitarian rationalism and hypocritical mor alism, profit-making and accumulation, state censorship and strict adminis tration of production and commerce, exploitation and alienation?these were the living conditions which set the margins of the Romantics' existence and also forged the parameters of the Romantic fairy tale. 27. See E.J. Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution 1780-1848 (New York: New American Library, 1964), p. 308: "The real problem was that of the artist cut off from a recogniz able function, patron, or public and left to cast his soul as a commodity upon a blind market, to be bought or not; or to work within a system of patronage which would generally have been economically untenable even if the French Revolution had not established its human dignity. The artist therefore stood alone, shouting into the night, uncertain of even an echo. It was only natural that he should turn himself into the ge nius, who created only what was within him, regardless of the world and in defiance of a public whose only right was to accept him on his own terms or not at all."</page><page sequence="24">432 JACK ZIPES The situation of the professional writer28 needs some amplification before we begin examining the Romantic fairy tales in detail. As is well known, Lessing was the first prominent professional writer in Germany whose expe riences as a "freier Schriftsteller" prefigured generations of bourgeois writers up through the nineteenth century. The fact that publishers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were not capable of paying writers enough so that they could live off their art, i.e., their production, forced most of them to maintain two professions. Generally speaking, writers took such jobs as teacher, librarian, state official, lawyer, or private secretary just to earn money to subsist. At the same time they were active as critics, editors, and poets, which brought them little money. In one situation they had to accommodate themselves to the dictates of a system which they despised; in the other, they were free to express themselves and to pursue what they desired to a great extent. No wonder, then, that art and the artist were described as "divine." And this is not an elitist notion. If we understand the concrete material con ditions under which Romantics labored?the division of their lives related to the division of labor and the rise of schizophrenia?then it becomes under standable that the artist's vocation represented a free pursuit, a total dedica tion of one's powers to bring about self-realization and unity with objective conditions, and that the realm of art represented a sphere in which the pos sibilities for overcoming alienation and exploitation might be explored. As it became more clear to the Romantics that it would be impossible to realize non-alienating conditions in the German society, they distanced them selves more and more from the industrious strivings of the citizenry to ac commodate themselves to forms of socio-economic rationalization which furthered the domination of the nobility. Again this was not because of their "elitism" but because of their disappointment in the social changes which were occurring. Nor did they seek flight in their art from daily occupations or were they immune to forces of co-optation. As we know, they were all actively involved in mundane positions as lawyer, private secretary, teacher, judge, farmer, etc., and were obliged to make compromises for which they often detested themselves or which they accepted later in resignation. They saw the deficiency in society as linked to their own self-deficiency as some critics have suggested?no one would ever deny the general psychological compensatory value of art. Their art assumed "divine" proportions and high value because it was an elaboration of their forthright critique of society 28. For informative studies of this situation, see W. H. Bruford, Germany in the Eigh teenth Century: The Social Background of the Literary Revival (London: Cambridge U. Press, 1935); Hans J. Haferkorn, "Zur Entstehung der burgerlichliterarischen Intelli genz des Schriftstellers in Deutschland zwischen 1750 und 1800," in Literaturwissen schaft und Sozialwissenschaften 3: Deutsches Burgertum und literarische Intelligenz 1750-1800, ed.

As J. H. Heiner has pointed out: It was precisely the critical reception of Rousseau in Germany which shows that the writers and their readers began to form a progressive anti-feudal and democratic consciousness. After making their careers in the service of the princes and the church, they turned against the state and religion as it became apparent that the political reform efforts of enlightened absolutism would not be sufficient to realize civil rights. Their experience proved to them that, even in its enlightened version, the absolutist monarchy tended to conserve the old estate privileges of the aristocracy, church, and guilds. The hopes which writers had for the future were hopes for a free, politically united, and democratic Germany.29 Heiner maintains that the progressive tendency of the early Romantics be came adulterated with religious and monarchical strains of thought and dreams. To a certain extent this is true, but it is irrelevant when we consider that the anti-authoritarian impulses of the Romantics remained the governing ones even when they made great compromises with the state and church. (Incidentally this can be seen in the case of the late Romantic composer Richard Wagner.) The Romantics were realistically in touch with the forces splitting them and Germany at the same time, and the value of their work lies in the man ner in which they were able to depict their ambivalent situation in Germany. Solutions were impossible. Alternatives for the future were hoped for. The Utopian realms, whether designed in their fairy tales as monarchical, repub lican, or Christian, were other than the oppressive, authoritarian regimes of Germany, and they pointed to non-alienating conditions. The dominant forces in these realms were not the people themselves, but eros and art. Here eros must be understood in the Freudian sense as "life instinct." And as Herbert Marcuse has pointed out, art gives form to and can retain the re pressed image of liberation which comes from the erotic element in phan tasy. This element "aims at an 'erotic reality' where the life instincts would come to rest in fulfillment without repression. This is the ultimate content of the phantasy-process in its opposition to the reality principle."30 Most important for the Romantics was the retention of "the repressed image of liberation." Here another, longer quotation by Marcuse might help us sum up the project of the Romantics, particularly as it assumed aesthetic shape in the fairy tale. 29.

At the individual level, the primal revolt is contained within the frame work of the normal Oedipus conflict. At the societal level, recurrent re bellions and revolutions have been followed by counter-revolutions and restorations. From the slave revolts in the ancient world to the socialist revolution, the struggle of the oppressed has ended in establishing a new, "better" system of domination; progress has taken place through an improving chain of control. Each revolution has been the conscious effort to replace one ruling group by another; but each revolution has also released forces that have "overshot the goal," that have striven for the abolition of domination and exploitation. The ease with which they have been defeated demands explanations. Neither the prevailing con stellation of power, nor immaturity of the production forces, nor ab sence of class consciousness provides an adequate answer. In every revo lution, there seems to have been a historical moment when the struggle against domination might have been victorious?but the moment passed. An element of self-defeat seems to be involved in this dynamic (regard less of the validity of such reasons as the prematurity and inequality of forces). In this sense, every revolution has also been a betrayed revolu tion.31 The anti-authoritarian and erotic symbols in the Romantic fairy tales in dicate to what extent the Romantics were aware of the "betrayed revolu tion" in Germany. The French Revolution, the wars on German soil, the promises of the German princes all led to a new social order of domination, but they also "released forces which overshot their goal," and which, we shall see, can be found in the Romantic fairy tale. Since it would take a more exhaustive study to cover the entire develop ment of the Romantic fairy tale, I have selected four tales written between 1796 and 1820 which substantiate the theoretical premises I have outlined. These tales?W. H. Wackenroder's Ein wunderbares morgenlandisches Marchen von einem nackten Heiligen (1786), Novalis' Klingsohr'sMarchen (1801), Clemens Brentano's Schulmeister Klopstock und seine fiinf Sonne (1814), and E. T. A. Hoffmann's Klein Zaches genannt Zinnober (1818)?represent different histor ical stages of the German Romantic movement. Most studies of Romanticism have divided the movement into three periods: early Romanticism or the Jena School, 1798-1801 (Tieck, the Schlegel Brothers, Novalis, Schelling, Fichte, Schleiermacher, etc.); middle Romanticism or the Heidelberg School, 1805 09 (Arnim, Brentano, the Grimm Brothers, Eichendorff, etc.); and late Ro manticism or the Berlin School, 1814-19 (Hoffmann, Chamisso, Fouque, 31. Ibid., pp. 82-83.</page><page sequence="27">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 435 etc.). Though these divisions are helpful, they fail to take into account other groups and individuals such as the Swabian Romantics, Kleist, Forster, Gorres, Holderlin, and Jean Paul, who partook in the spirit of this move ment. In general it seems to me to be more accurate to consider Romanti cism as comprising three overlapping stages from 1796 to 1820: the theo retical and innovative period which was characterized by radical experi mentation; the folk period, which led to the exploration of national history and tradition; and the conventional period, which reduced the originally complex motifs and themes to formulae for a larger reading public. In this regard, my selection of tales is an attempt to understand the specific histor ical relation of each tale to a stage in the Romantic movement: Wacken roder prefigured in form and content the great experimentation of the early Romantics; Novalis' tale is an example of this great experimentation; Bren tano imbued the fairy tale with a German folk quality; Hoffmann showed to what extent the already conventionalized forms of the fairy tale could still be used to present a unique critique of society. Wackenroder's Ein wunderbares morgenldndisches Marchen von einem nack ten Heiligen (A Wonderful Oriental Tale about a Naked Saint) was written during the last years of his short life when he was under great duress.32 His father, one of the leading citizens of Berlin and an upholder of rationalism, opposed his becoming a musician or artist of any kind, and Wackenroder was obliged to conceal his writing endeavors. In the period between 1792 and 1796 he wrote letters to Tieck, his closest friend, which are filled with complaints about the confining, desultory conditions in Germany, and which also expressed hopes for a better life symbolized by art and the French Revo lution. "Only creativity brings us closer to divinity; and the artist, the poet, is creator. Long live art! It alone elevates us above the earth and makes us worthy of heaven."33 "You don't say anything about the French. I cer tainly hope that you have not become indifferent about them, that you really are interested in them. Oh, if only I were a Frenchman now! Then I would not be sitting here?But unfortunately I was born in a monarchy which fought against freedom, among people who were barbaric enough to despise the French. . . . What is life without freedom? I greet the genius of Greece with joy which I see floating above Gaul. France is in my thoughts day and night now?if France is unhappy, then I despise the entire world and have doubts about its strength. Then the dream is too beautiful for 32.

Press, 1971), pp. 3-75. 33. W. H. Wackenroder, Werke und Briefe (Heidelberg: Lambert Schneider, 1967), P- 387.</page><page sequence="28">436 JACK ZIPES our century. Then we are decadent, strange creatures, not at all related to those who once fell at Thermopylae, then Europe is destined to become a prison."34 Wackenroder praised art in a manner that might seem elitist or escapist to some critics, but there is enough evidence in his works35 and reports by con temporaries to argue that he actually opposed such art for art's sake ten dencies and even maintained that subjective feelings must find a universal, ideal language so that they become intelligible and reach a larger audience. The fairy tale was one way Wackenroder could manifest in such "ideal" language his love for art which would make his complaint about repression intelligible. Simply put, the morgenlandisches Marchen is Wackenroder's critique of utilitarian rationalism. It concerns a naked saint who in some strange way wanders from the heavenly firmament and assumes the shape of a human being on earth. He makes his home in a cave on the fringe of society and suffers from a delusion: he hears the "wheel of time" droning in his ears continually, and he becomes caught up in it. That is, he spends most of his time turning an imaginary wheel in fear that it might some day stop. He scorns and attacks all those who come near him and question his work, es pecially those who do petty mundane things in his vicinity. Nothing can stop him from turning the wheel, although he wants more than anything else to be set free from the wheel. He especially longs for beautiful things. Then, one night, two lovers take a boatride on a river, and the harmony of their souls touches off such a remarkable music that it makes the droning of the wheel disappear. It is the first time that music had penetrated the saint's hermitage, and it frees him from his earthly form. He ascends into the fir mament where he assumes the form of the genius of love and music. The introductory remarks by the narrator of the tale are significant, for he begins right off by remarking that there are strange creatures who are hon ored in the Orient as holy beings but who are called insane in his society. This is an explicit attack on the narrow-mindedness of the rationalists of Wackenroder's day and a defense of imaginative non-conformists. The be havior of the saint sets him apart from other people because he has an ambiv alent relation to time. On the one hand, he is caught up in the wheel of time which he keeps turning, and, on the other hand, he wants more than any thing else to be released from time. Thus, the predicament of the naked saint announced what was to be a major problem for the Romantics in an epoch when time was being rationalized to fit into a rigid pattern. As Henri Brunschwig has noted, the Romantics "are very conscious of the flight of 34. Ibid., p. 405. 35. Ibid., p. 404.</page><page sequence="29">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 437 time. They feel that every moment is pregnant with possibilities, and they despair of their inability to choose among them, that is to say, to exclude whatever they would not themselves have elected. But to abstain from choosing means that the passage of time itself makes the choice for them, and this embitters their soul with a melancholy engendered by their impo tence to affect the flight of time. This feeling is at the root of their philos ophy. What would really suit them would be to live several lives at once. ... This thirst forever unquenched, this jealously cherished feeling that body and soul must at all times be free to break off any attachment, this abhor rence of the finite?all lead to the perpetual flight toward an ever more distant and ever more exalted ideal uniting contraries in an impossible, a non-human, and miraculous perfection and so removing the necessity for choice."36 Wackenroder's tale is almost an artistic paradigm about the Ro mantics' notion of time. The saint can be saved only by love and music which uplift him from the monotony of regulated time. He is set free and moves toward an ideal of infinite time. This ideal serves as a positive con trast to mundane reality which is associated with images of confinement and enforced regulation. It is also indicative of the Romantics' quest to become masters of time. This is why music and love are the two most important components of the Utopian vision. They offer compensation for the deficit of a regulated reality in that they allow for the free expansion of the saint's spirit. His creative energies, held in check by the wheel of time, are dis charged and find their genius in another world. The position assumed by the naked saint with respect to the wheel of time and to the other characters of the tale reveals Wackenroder's critical attitude toward the dominant activity of his times. Industriousness and ad ministered behavior which benefited authoritarian rulers set the basis for a mode of life rejected by him, Tieck, and the other early Romantics. Partic ularly in Prussia the principles of the Enlightenment had become terribly vulgarized and were used to rationalize the arbitrary domination of the state. Hence the ambivalent behavior of the saint toward time is interesting since it reflects Wackenroder's dilemma. As a child of the Enlightenment, he was drawn to notions of reason and regulation; however, upon perceiving how these enlightened notions were applied to enslave man's creative spirit, he sought alternative forms of behavior. In capsule form, then, Wackenroder's tale lays out the needs of a young generation of intellectuals who sought to overcome the contradictions of their time through their critical spirit and oppositional behavior. Moreover, his fairy tale departs radically in design from the folk tale. Gone are kings, queens, struggles for power and wealth, marriage, and the rise in social status. Instead we have an outsider who remains 36. Enlightenment and Romanticism in Eighteenth-Century Prussia, pp. 227-28.</page><page sequence="30">438 JACK ZIPES an outsider, an artist type, who becomes the genius of love and music. Power is not pursued, rather freedom and non-alienating conditions. As it takes shape, the tale is a celebration of the imagination in protest against the banal existence to which people on earth are sentenced. Unlike what is the case in the folk tale, the narrator editorializes and evinces a dramatic sympathy for his protagonist. His is a perspective which sees the exemplary in non-con formist behavior. Hence, again in contrast to the folk tale, the ending is left open. The infinite goal, though reached, cannot be attained on earth. Con ditions are not yet ripe for individuals like the saint to be accepted in the society of the wheel of time. Most of Wackenroder's work in Herzensergiessungen eines Kunstliebenden Klosterbruders and Phantasien uber die Kunst can be considered a prelude to the great experimentation of the early Romantics. Certainly Novalis was much more experimental, abstract, and erotic, and in this regard he was much more of a revolutionary than Wackenroder. He constantly sought to work out a radical position in his poems, essays, novels, and fairy tales, and the fact that he made numerous enigmatic and contradictory remarks about monarchy and religion did not detract from his basic effort to conceive a realm in opposition to the position of the decadent aristocracy.37 His pietistic upbringing, support of the French Revolution, and serious study of idealist philosophy led him consistently to place great faith in the democratic poten tial of human willpower and creativity. His disappointment in the failure of the Germans to realign society along more egalitarian lines led him to postulate ideas about government and self-government which might pro vide the basis for realizing more harmonious conditions for establishing the rights of human beings as humane creatures. Absolute equality is the greatest trick possible?the ideal?but not natural. ?According to their natural disposition human beings are only relatively equal?which is the old inequality?the stronger also has a stronger right. Likewise, human beings are according to their natural disposition not free but, rather, more or less bound. There are few human beings who are human beings?this is the rea son why there is so much difficulty in establishing the rights of human beings, as really extant. Be human beings, then the rights of human beings will devolve upon you by themselves.38 37- The best study of his life which examines Novalis as a progressive thinker and writer is Gerhard Schulz, Novalis (Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowholt, 1969). See also Richard Faber's Novalis: Die Phantasie an die Macht (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1970), which links Novalis' ideas to those of Ernst Bloch and Walter Benjamin and tendencies of contemporary revolutionary movements. 38. Novalis, Werke und Briefe (Munich: Winkler, 1962), p. 508.</page><page sequence="31">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 439 Most of his creative work which was completed in the last three years (1798-1801) of his life was aimed at humanizing human beings, and there is no doubt that the fairy tale assumed the most significant place among his radical writings: "The genuine fairy tale must be simultaneously prophetic por trayal?ideal portrayal?absolutely necessary portrayal. The genuine writer of fairy tales is a seer of the future. (With time, history must become a fairy tale?it will become once again what it was at its inception.)"39 Underlying all of Novalis' three major fairy tales?Hyazinth und Rosen bltite from Die Lehrlinge zu Sais and the Atlantis-Marchen and Klingsohrs Marchen from Heinrich von Ofterdingen?is the same notion of time which was developed by Wackenroder. Regulated time must be uplifted so that the creative spirit can be set free to reorder the universe more in keeping with the erotic needs of human beings. For history to be man-made, the orderly components of restrictive time must disintegrate, and out of chaos a new creative principle will emerge to give shape to a new world. How ever, this does not occur easily. As Sophie says at the end of Klingsohrs Marchen: "the new world is born out of pain, and the ashes will become dis solved in tears and made into the drink of the eternal life."40 The line of motion in Klingsohrs Marchen is indeed characterized by dislocation, disorder, and confrontation. The major force of conservatism and petrifaction is the Scribe, who is constantly associated with the vulgar Enlightenment. It is he who controls the spinners of fate, kills Sophie, and endeavors to legislate how life should be conducted according to rational principles. Only in con frontation with the Scribe can a new world come into being, and it is sig nificantly Fable (art) who binds love (Eros), peace (Freya), and wisdom (Sophie) together to conquer the Scribe and unite three different realms. Consequently a new world does come into being, but it is a transcendent world, a world apart which serves as a measure for the reader's real world. The ideal propensities of this fairy-tale world, however, are meant to be the possible historical dimensions of the real world, for we know that Novalis envisioned history's becoming a fairy tale. Clearly, his fairy tale is forward looking and has nothing to do with medieval concepts and absolutism. Nor is Novalis unrealistic in his expectations. The world will become as human beings are, and the erotic nature of the new realm is made convincingly manifest. The behavior exhibited by Fable, Eros, Freya, Arctur, the mother, father, and Sophie reveals a sensual mode of relating which allows for mu tual self-respect and equality. When Eros loses control, it is Fable, i.e., art, which brings the life instincts back to their senses, gives them shape, pro vides them peace (Freya). Non-alienating conditions must first be estab 39- Ibid., p. 506. 40. Ibid., p. 271.</page><page sequence="32">440 JACK ZIPES lished for human beings to become human, for a state to rise which will humanely meet the needs of those same human beings. So Klingsohrs Marchen teaches us a lesson about the future: Nature will be moral?when it does what art wants out of genuine love for art?when it abandons itself to art?and art will become moral when it lives and works for nature?out of genuine love for nature. Both must do it simultaneously, out of their own choice?for their own sake?and out of another's choice for something else's sake. They must come to gether in themselves with the other and with themselves in the other. When our intelligence and our world harmonize?then we are like God.41 The aesthetic design of Klingsohrs Marchen is intended to bring out the di vine nature of art and the creativity of human beings. Novalis was fond of saying that to become a human being is an art, and his stress on the sublime role of the artist in society had nothing to do with elitism. Quite clearly, he recognized that society was an artifact, i.e., a product of human work manship, and that nature?the environment and human nature?had to be moulded in such a way that the elemental drives of nature would be given free rein by the human intelligence which could construe democratic and egalitarian principles for social behavior. In Klingsohrs Marchen, the thread of action woven by Fable makes up the fabric of a new world that unites a "genuine love for nature" with a "genuine love for art." The focus of the tale is on Fable who "loves and works for nature"; that is, she endeavors to comprehend the essence of all things in order to bring about a sense of jus tice and balance. Her answers to the Sphinx reveal to what extent she is cap able of fulfilling such a task: " 'What is more sudden than lightning?'? 'Revenge,' said Fable.?'What is most perishable?'?'Unlawful possession.' ?'Who knows the world?'?'Whoever knows himself.' 'What is the eternal secret?'?'Love.'?'Where can we find love?' 'With Sophie.' "42 Here we must expand upon Novalis' notion of love if we are to under stand how it is related to creativity and underscores the aesthetic pattern of the tale. In her book, Weiblicher Lebenszusammenhang, Ulrike Prokop makes the following significant observation: Like the early romantics, the young Hegel sees the model for non alienating institutions in the example of love as a communicative rela tionship. Thus, he interprets the concept of Christian love as that free flowing of social needs and interests which does not necessitate the reg imentation by legal institutions since it emanates from spontaneous 41. Ibid., p. 519. 42. Ibid., p. 266.</page><page sequence="33">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 441 agreement. Hegel describes love as a principle which lifts barriers and creates vital relations among human beings and, because of this, also makes the human being really alive for himself or herself. . . . Love is the expression for the bourgeois-revolutionary concept of the univer sally developed human being and for the relations which he or she un dertakes. This is still the thematic of the romantic protest: love, as rec onciliation in the dialogistic recognition of the other, in which the I rec ognizes itself again, is not limited to the family.43 Novalis' fairy tale gives full expression to this notion of Romantic love. Freya is desperate because conditions in the kingdom of Arctur have become petrified. In the bourgeois realm on earth, Eros is still in his infancy and does not know how to control his instinctual impulses. Otherwise, there is, at first, a beautiful image of sensuous, fluent, and erotic communication among the father, Ginnistan, Sophie, and the mother. All this is destroyed once Eros departs with Ginnistan for the kingdom of Arctur, and once the Scribe in carcerates and destroys the members of the family. Fable's artistic task is to overcome barriers of rationalism set by the Scribe so that there can be free love. This is not to be understood in the sense of licentiousness. Like most of the early Romantics, Novalis objected to love as possession, and he wanted to open channels so that love might consist of genuine communication and respect for the needs of others. In turn, this would allow for recognition of the self and free self-development. For this to occur, the old forms of be havior had to be destroyed and replaced. Thus, the conflict with the Scribe is in effect Romanticism's struggle against the restrictions of the vulgar Enlightenment. Like Wackenroder, Novalis conceives the movement in the fairy tale as a process of self-realization and creativity. Love and art can flourish only if a new corporeal-temporal order is brought about. Thus, the aesthetic pattern depends upon constant movement between different realms and consists of metaphorical associations with old and new worlds. Novalis consciously played off folk tales and Goethe's Das Marchen. The complex network of mythical and allegorical figures defies exact interpretation, but the creative process of Fable does make it clear that the art work of the fairy tale criti cally reflects the reified artificiality of human relations in society at the end of the eighteenth century. Paradoxically the artistically conceived relations in Novalis' fairy tale?sensuous, free-flowing, democratic?are more natural than those in real society. This is the historical mission of the fairy tale: the uplifting of barriers and prescribed time to allow for love and creativity to take their natural course can lead to man's making history in a true sense. 43- Weiblicher Lebenszusammenhang: Von der Beschrdnktheit der Strategien und der Unan gemessenheit der WiXnsche (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1976), pp. 162-63.</page><page sequence="34">442 JACK ZIPES Real history can only commence when human beings are not treated as tools and subject to the whim of chance but when they creatively make full use of their human nature and use time for creating non-alienating conditions of work and play. Whereas Wackenroder, Novalis, and the other early Romantics were cos mopolitan, if not international in their outlook, even if they did treat dis tinct German themes, the middle Romantics were influenced by the ram pant nationalism of the early nineteenth century. Brentano, Arnim, and the Grimm Brothers all studied German folklore, and there was a definite con servative tinge and anti-French bias to their writings. The conservatism was not necessarily reactionary. The middle Romantics sought to give the Ger mans a national identity and unify the people around a Germanic tradition which was based on plebeian values of honesty, courage, fidelity, purity, etc. At any rate, nationalism at that time was associated with the movement for freedom against oppressive rule, and the Romantics of this period en deavored to awaken a national consciousness so that the German people might realize their emancipation themselves. At the same time, these writers were trying to establish their own identity as writers. Brentano particularly suffered from self-doubts throughout most of his life.44 He was a type of purist and hoped either through religion or art to be able to lead a life with out pretensions, an open life without inhibitions. This was one of the reasons he was drawn to the folk or nationalist movement. On the one hand, there was something idyllic and pure in the way of life of the German common people. On the other hand, he mocked their simple ways. This love-hate attraction drew him to a serious study of folklore. In 1798 he moved to Jena where he met the early Romantics who en couraged him to pursue a literary career. After the composition of his re markable, what he called wild, Romantic novel, Godwi, he traveled in the Rhine region from 1799 to 1803 and collected material for folk songs and tales. About this time he conceived the idea to adapt Basile's tales from the Pentameron for German readers?the original impetus coming from the early Romantics, especially Tieck, despite the fact that he found Tieck's humor lacking. He began this project in 1805 and completed the short Italian fairy tales in 1807. The longer ones were finished in the period between 1813 and 1817 when he spent most of his time in Bohemia and Berlin. Brentano's fairy tales mark a definite break with the ones written by the early Romantics. Not that his themes changed radically, nor the critical per spective on society. Brentano's tone and disposition were different. He en 44- For a complete study of Brentano's life and a discussion of other works about him, see Werner Hoffmann, Clemens Brentano (Bern: Francke, 1966).

Often struck with depressions, Brentano used the brisk humor and music of his fairy tales to maintain a balance between his moods of ecstasy and despair. In a letter to Frau von Ahlefeld about the Gockel-Marchen, he wrote: "If the fairy tale pleased you, that's good. I wrote it mainly under great distress and could not for a moment allow my great sufferings to be noticed. So I assumed the attitude of a child in order to fool people and cover my torn heart."45 Schulmeister Klopstock und seine funf Sohne (The Schoolmaster Klopstock and His Five Sons) was written during the same period as the Gockel-Marchen. It is based on Basile's The Five Sons and is approximately ten times its length. Both tales are derived from the traditional folk-tale scheme of a father who has five good-for-nothing sons. He sends them out into the world to learn a trade. They return after a year, all having learned skills which then enable them to unite to save a princess. Since there are five, the king does not know which son to choose for his daughter's husband. So he chooses their father, and all are happy. Basile basically follows this scheme, but Brentano makes great alterations which indicate his German perspective. First of all, the father Klopstock is a schoolmaster, and a catastrophe has destroyed his town. Not only has the school been burned down but all the farmers and schoolchildren have been killed. This devastation is an immedi ate allusion to the Napoleonic Wars and the upheavals experienced during that time. Secondly, the father does not send his sons out into the world be cause they are good-for-nothing but because he wants them to become good for something. The five of them, Gripsgraps, Pitschpatsch, Piffpaff, Pinke pank, and Trilltrall, are to learn a calling, and, since Brentano constantly delighted in using puns, their names indicate their callings, and they comi cally run off when they hear themselves "called." After a year, they return, and here Brentano makes radical changes in the original Basile tale. Not only does he amplify the narrative by having each son tell a humorous anec dote of how he discovered his calling, but the focus of the tale switches to Trilltrall, the poet. At first, since Trilltrall looks wild and ragged and be haves strangely, his father calls him a fool. With his long hair, tanned face, and counter-cultural habits, the young man certainly resembles the first of the hippie poets. But soon the attention focuses on TrilltraU's story of how he met a hermit who taught him the song of the birds and other animals. TrilltraU's adventures are also connected to the princess Pimperlein, who has been abducted by the nightwatchman Knarrasper. He convinces his father and brothers to form a rescue party to return her to the kingdom of Glock 45- Clemens Brentano, Briefe, ed. F. Seebass (Nuremberg: H. Carl, 1951), n, 7.</page><page sequence="36">444 JACK ZIPES tonia. They are, of course, successful, but instead of the father Klopstock's marrying the princess, it is Trilltrall who is chosen by the princess, and they set up an animal park and breeding place for birds on the small property allotted them. Though there is little indication of the "torn nature" of the poet Bren tano in this tale, the movement again suggests the impossibility of living freely and according to one's calling in the real world. The father and five sons are literally burned out of their home, dispossessed. Their skills are de veloped to move to a new world. This world of Glocktonia, obviously one of music and harmony, is threatened by a nightwatchman, who is associated with the police and forces of darkness. This intruder is overcome by the unity of the sons whose creative skills are exhibited in the course of the struggle. In the end they are equally rewarded and can pursue their callings in peace. This realm, as the narrator remarks, is not of this world, but it does exist, for he claims that he had been there once. Brentano's light humor here masks an anguish and disappointment, for he must contend with a different type of reality. As in most Romantic tales, the mirth and humor serve to mark a critical distance so that the author can maintain a balanced perspective on the chang ing times without being overrun and devastated as happened in the begin ning of Brentano's story. Rooting a traditional folk tale in German condi tions was also an uprooting of the original themes and motifs. Brentano celebrates a life of the carefree imagination, the Bohemian, in contrast to the folk tale which reasserts the position of the father as the justifying principle. Trilltrall is chosen by the princess, not the father by the king. So it is love and music again which are elevated to the guiding forces of an ideal realm, and these forces are more democratic than the ones which existed in the folk tale. After all they have been set free by the unified power of the sons who have become good for something. Barriers are broken by the artist's being chosen by a princess and the democratic partition of the reward. As in No valis' Klingsohrs Marchen, the pattern of the tale is a process of creativity. In Brentano the words and metaphors resound musically and exude a German folk quality which rings pure in contrast to the artificial tones of German society. Though Brentano does not address the problem of decadence and repression directly in the tale, it is clear that the nightwatchman represents the intrusion of repressive forces (be they the French or Prussians), and his imaginative play is a spoof about rationalism, his defiance of the enemies of fantasy. If Brentano "nationalized" the fairy tale, so to speak, to keep the imagi nation alive for the German people, then Hoffmann "conventionalized" the fairy tale to show how the German people were in danger of losing not only their imagination but also their humor. Toward the end of Hoffmann's tale</page><page sequence="37">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 445 about Klein Zaches, the crude and pompous dwarf, who has become a min ister, ends his career ignominiously by drowning in a silver pot, and the court doctor tries to explain the cause of death to the Prince Barsanuph: "If I were content to swim around in superficialities, I could say that the minister's death was caused by his lack of breath which was brought about by the impossibility to get his breath, and this impossibility was in turn in duced only by a certain factor, by humor, which overthrew the minister. I could say that in this way the minister died a humorous death, but far be it from me to be so shallow, far be it from me to cherish such a desire to use vile, physical principles to explain things which can only find their natural irrefutable substantiation in the field of pure psychology."46 But the fact is that the ugly runt Zaches was killed by humor, and that Hoffmann's irony was used consistently as compositional and substantive principle for his tales and novels. As the most consummate Romantic writer of fairy tales, Hoff mann learned to conventionalize and then play with the fairy tales of other Romantics as well as with folk tales. Being among the last and the most ex plicitly political of the Romantics, he learned to disguise his sharp barbs against the Prussian state with humor which afforded him the distance to survive an existence of travail and pursue a life of creativity. Certainly he would have died a much earlier death figuratively had he not used his humor to gain a hold on himself and "to kill off" his enemies. Beginning with his first major tale, Der goldene Topf (1814), Hoffmann served notice on the "society of enlightenment" that he would be judging it severely. He has his protagonist Anselmus reject a secure career as privy councillor for life in poetry with the salamander Serpentina. By 1818, Hoff mann as a judge in Berlin had not only seen the dawn of the restoration but had experienced the brutal force of political repression and recrimination against which he fought. Thus his depiction of society in Klein Zaches ge nannt Zinnober is even more harsh than it was in his earlier tales. In the prin cipality of Kerepes where everything takes place, we learn that what once had been a paradise for poets, elves, fairies, i.e., the imagination, under the rule of Prince Demetrius, has been transformed into a police state by his successor Prince Paphnutius, who decides to introduce the principles of the Enlightenment into his kingdom. But, as the prime minister explains to the prince, "Before we go ahead with the Enlightenment, that is, before we cut down forests, make the rivers navigable, plant potatoes, improve the village schools, plant acacia and poplar trees, teach the young to sing evening and morning songs in two voices, lay out roads, and introduce vaccinations, we must banish all people from the state who hold dangerous opinions, do not 46.

"Their work with the miracu lous is pernicious, and they do not hesitate to use the name of poetry to spread a secret poison which makes the people totally incapable of serving the Enlightenment. Furthermore, they have such insufferable habits which go against the police that they therefore should not be tolerated in any cul tivated state."48 The arguments of this minister are so persuasive that most of the fairies are exiled to Dschinistan, and a police action begins which lays the conditions for Klein Zaches later under the rule of Prince Barsanuph to take over the state as minister. This misbegotten, ugly dwarf, who screeches when he talks and treats people in mean and nasty ways, ironically becomes the protege of Rosabelverde, one of the few remaining good fairies in the kingdom, who takes pity on him in hopes that he may further the cause of the imagination. She endows him with the potential to make it seem that all his mean actions and ugly features are attributed to other people while everything good is attributed to him. For the most part, however, his actions only bring out the insufferable qualities of the "enlightened" world. Be cause of this he is soon promoted to minister and will marry the lovely Candida, daughter of the famous professor of physics Mosch Terpin. This leads the real protagonist of the narrative, the gifted poet and student Bal thasar, who is in love with Candida and who sees through Klein Zaches (now named Zinnober), to seek help from the magician Prosper Alpanus, who had managed to survive the police action of the Enlightenment and works to save the poetic forces in the kingdom. Since Alpanus realizes that Balthasar has great poetical talents and that the forces for true enlighten ment and imagination are endangered by the barbaric, crude behavior of Zinnober, he gives Balthasar the secret which will expose the dwarf. Once this occurs, Klein Zaches dies a humorous death. He tries to escape the out raged people who now recognize how he has deceived them, and he falls and drowns. Balthasar marries Candida and settles down on an estate be queathed to him by Alpanus before the magician leaves for the Orient. Alpanus has made such a gesture because Balthasar understands the "won drous voices of nature" and possesses "the pure heart of which yearning and love are fused."49 Indeed, Balthasar becomes a good poet and Candida de velops her natural talents in the wondrous realm in which they are privi leged to live. Throughout this long, complex narrative the narrator constantly inter jects ironical remarks which belittle the presumptuousness not only of the 47- Ibid., p. 16. 48. Ibid., p. 17. 49.

Like Novalis?and, in fact, all the early Romantics?Hoffmann was just as much against the misuse of the imagination (Schwarmerei) as he was against the abuse of the imagination. The imagination and art were serious,50 and it was not until the talented in dividual underwent severe tests that the title of poet could be bestowed upon him. In Klein Zaches, there is a clear indictment of the new social order of utilitarian enlightenment which leaves little room for the development of creative individuals. Thus, what does "develop" is misshapen. What is mis shapen is also due in part to a poor use of imagination and reason. This per version of the imagination and reason is the outcome of material conditions in a policed state. The skills used by the magician Prosper Alpanus are directed to offset repression and develop creativity so that hypocrisy and treachery will be exposed. Art is not used for its own sake?something which Bal thasar must learn. And even when the young man does learn what it takes to become a poet, he must settle on the fringes of society. Happiness is im possible in society. The movement toward resolution does not mean that participation is possible in the socialization process. On the contrary, this allegedly "enlightened" process is confronted, turned inside out, and ex posed as an actual betrayal of the real humanitarian principles of the En lightenment. Moreover, the revolutionizing force of movement in the tale speaks in the name of the betrayed principles of the French Revolution. Yet Hoffmann's mode of presentation and the motifs which he employs are anything but revolutionary. He is the great conventionalizer of the Ro mantic movement. This is not meant in a pejorative sense. His achievement lies in his ability to conventionalize the early Romantic notions of love and art with plots and characters reminiscent of the commedia delYarte so that they typify characters and situations which were easily recognizable for a larger reading public. At the same time he retains the original anti-capitalist im pulse and critique which he adroitly weaves with strands of both the folk tale and fairy-tale motifs to make the borders between reality and the imag ination disappear. Thus we have the conventional Romantic story of the aspiring young poet who falls in love with the seemingly unobtainable beauty from the upper class, a "princess," and there is a magician, who helps him not only win the princess but become a full-fledged poet. This fantastic level of the fairy tale (a transformation of folk-tale motifs) also contains a fairy god-mother, a grotesque dwarf, a comic foil, and a foolish prince. But there is another level and more real side to all these events and characters that concerns a story about police repression in Prussia with which Hoff 50. Though somewhat outdated in its overall approach to the Romantic period, Harvey Hewett-Thayer's biography is still one of the most comprehensive for grasping the seriousness of Hoffmann's artistic endeavors.

The exaggerated features of his droll characters and the ridiculous melodramatic situations in which they find themselves were purposely elaborated to let the readers uninhibitedly enjoy the critical power of the imagination. Thus the intricate pattern of flash backs, interludes, and narrative irony suggests how difficult the creative pro cess joining art with love had become by 1818. The conventionalization of the early Romantic project was an attempt to locate and typify the absurdity of a social reality that had lost its sense of humor and was busy repressing the forces of the imagination. When we talk about the revolutionizing force of the Romantic fairy tale, we must first begin to talk about the way the Romantics revolutionized composition to conceive their worlds. In the short synopses of the tales which I have presented, I have not attempted to explore in depth the re markable aesthetic experiments undertaken by the Romantics. Nor shall I begin such an analysis at this point since each tale would demand a long, detailed explication. However, I should like to conclude by examining cer tain common features which link the revolutionizing of forms to the revo lutionary impulse of the period. Feher talks about the "formlessness" of the novel, and certainly this is the case with the Romantic fairy tale. Unlike the compact pattern of the folk tale which, as V. Propp has demonstrated,51 can be structurally charted, the fairy tale knows no such limits or perimeters. Wackenroder's narrative is about six pages in length, utilizes poetry, and maintains a serious, but ironic, perspective. Brentano's carefree tale is about sixty pages, contains poetry, subtle puns, and stories within stories, and evokes a musical mood. Hoff mann's Klein Zaches is over a hundred pages and contains flashbacks, stories within stories, and ironical interjections. Each one of the Romantic fairy tales is distinctly different in composition, but they are the same in that they explode the bounds of the folk tale. Not only that, they explode the bounds of other Kunstmarchen. Novalis transcended Goethe's tale as a model when he wrote Klingsohrs Marchen, and Hoffmann endeavored to surpass the fairy tales of Tieck, Fouque, and other Romantics as well as his own when he wrote Klein Zaches. The "formlessness" of the fairy tale obviously emanates from writers brimming over with exuberance at the discovery of the self and the power of the imagination to proclaim independence from the severe strictures of eighteenth-century regimentation. The freedom sought by the imagination was a result of the establishment of a new social configuration. 51. Morphology of the Folktale, 2nd rev. ed. (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana U. Press, 1968).</page><page sequence="41">THE GERMAN ROMANTIC FAIRY TALE 449 Thus form representative of a past or passing social and cultural order could not dictate a new artistic conception. It could only help determine new no tions in that it provided a pole, a pattern, against which the writers rebelled and measured their new-found worth. Formlessness then became form which had its own determinants when understood in light of the transition from one socio-political order to a new one and the ambivalent attitude of the Romantics toward the Enlightenment and incipient modes of capitalist ra tionalization. Here, too, one must consider the temporal aspect in the fairy tales. Most of them involve an "uplifting of time." By this I mean that they dissolve normal sequential patterns and fuse the boundaries between fantasy and the real world. Time becomes timeless so that the protagonist can create his or her own time, so that the temporal-corporeal arrangement can be moulded to the pursuits of creative individuals. The mastery of time by human beings in a period when time was becoming more rationalized according to the needs of bureaucratic administration and early modes of industrial produc tion is a significant theme in the Romantic protest against reification. Self mastery and self-determination are crucial aspects for the Romantic notions of creating new social orders. Their anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist po sition takes form in the formlessness and timelessness of their tales. What are the determining elements in the formlessness and timelessness of the Romantic fairy tale? All the Romantic writers argued for taking the imagination more seriously. They aimed at making the line between the fantastic and the realistic disappear to show the unlimited potential of the human being for self-realization. The aesthetics called for reversing the al ready reversed principles of Enlightenment which were being utilized to deplete and enslave the humane essence of human beings. The flux of lines in the fairy tale causes an upheaval of categories of specialization which are looked at critically from the narrative point of view. This flux gives birth to a configuration which measures the marginal limits of the extant social con figuration. For instance, in the folk tale there is a definite hierarchical struc ture. Participation in this structure is (depending on the historical period) generally desired, and power and wealth are the dominant concerns of the protagonists. Folk-tale heroes want to rule over others or want power used justly. In the fairy tales of Wackenroder, Novalis, Brentano, Hoffmann, and other Romantics the old social order is upset, burned down, destroyed, or made to seem ridiculous. Out of the needs of the major protagonist?gen erally speaking an artist, explorer, or creative individual?a new realm arises which levels false distinctions and is based on egalitarian principles. The de sign of the tale is predicated on dislocation and confrontation in which imag inative energies are used to conceive of a realm apart from the real world which is stifling or has fallen apart. Imagination and self-realization are cele</page><page sequence="42">450 JACK ZIPES brated as activities in contrast to the celebration of power, i.e., "might makes right," in the folk tale. The protagonist in the fairy tale does not want to rule over other people but over the dualities in his or her own life. The naked saint wants to be freed from the wheel of time and become the genius of music and love. Fable wants to unite the "erotic" forces gone astray and create a new world free of restraint. Trilltrall wants to follow his creative calling and realize his love for the princess. Balthasar wants to become a poet and consummate his love for Candida. The center of attention in the configu ration of these tales was a side issue in the social configuration in Germany; i.e., the social concerns of the Romantics were shunted aside by ruling classes. Thus the movement of the tales ultimately revolves around conflict and the projection of alternatives to the socialization process which was becoming institutionalized in the German principalities. The conflict was not a simple black/white issue. The Romantics were not fools. They recognized the great accomplishments of the Enlightenment and saw the powerful potential of early capitalist technology. But they also saw how these advances in thinking and industry were being used to affect and enslave their own consciousness and behavior as well as those of the people in general. And their tales sought to recover the revolutionary potential of the new inventions and thought for the in-formation and formation of a new social order which was still in transition. Their awareness of the ambivalence of what was called progress and enlightenment caused them to point to the deficiencies they noted in their own lives and in the living conditions in Germany. The stress on free play, love, harmony as activities and the formlessness and timelessness of the tales point to the revolutionary impulse behind their designs. The fact that these activities were not realized in new, life-giving, non-alienating forms cannot be attributed to the inactivity or resignation of the Romantics, a small group of artists who were divided against themselves and their audi ence. As the tales amply demonstrate, creative individuals were made into fortuitous creatures whose qualities were determined by the material condi tions and their choices of action. Generally speaking, the actions of the pro tagonists led to an opposition with society which divided them, set them apart. Their value as revolutionary figures does not lie in the fact that they show us how to build the new "socialist society," but in the fact that their failures realistically show the deficit of the times. It is in their "great refusal" to be formed by powers of domination that the failures and formlessness of the fairy tales are revolutionary. The University of Wisconsin?Milwaukee</page></plain_text>
