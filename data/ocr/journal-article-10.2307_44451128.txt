As a reader of Science and the publications of the American Physiological Society, I am repeatedly appalled by the historical, philosophical, and political naiveté of many defenders of animal experimentation in the United States. Their arrogance and ad hominem venom (e.g., labelling as "terrorists" animal rights activists who have, at worst, destroyed property) are matched only by the fanaticism and self-righteousness of their extreme anti-vivisectionist opponents. Despite the best efforts of moderate commentators on both sides of the debate, there is little reason to expect a full and happy compromise. The two sides are at odds over fundamental and incommensu- rable values. The divide may be deeper now than ever, especially insofar as current activists draw inspiration from the radical attack against "speciesism" (by analogy with sexism and racism) in Peter Singer's Animal Rights (1975), which logically pro- hibits animal experimentation along with less vivid forms of human "exploitation" of other species. But if, in this dispute, there remain any fence-sitters in search of dis- passionate historical perspective, they will find Vivisection in Historical Perspective a valuable resource indeed. The fifteen essays in this well-edited volume achieve a uniformly high level of scholarship and a remarkably balanced tone. Errors of fact are almost absent, and the book is nicely produced, with one egregious exception: the publisher's decision to separate William Schupbach's interesting discussion of the iconography of animal experiments by 130 pages from the five striking illustrations to which his text refers. Several useful graphs and charts enhance the volume, which also includes a service- able index. Despite their high scholarly quality, the essays are not equally interesting or origi- nal. In fact, the impact of the book as a whole, especially the five essays focusing on the late Victorian British scene, is dimmed by the long shadow cast by Richard D. French's pioneering book Antivivisection and Medical Science in Victorian Society (1975). French there addressed so many of the themes discussed here that the reader will sometimes experience a sense of déjà vu. It would have helped if the editor and other contributors had been more emphatic about the ways in which they amplify, challenge, or otherwise go beyond French's book, whose influence most of them duly acknowledge. Of the thirteen essays sandwiched between the editor's introduction and a brief epilogue by Sir William Paton, all but three focus on the nineteenth century. Andreas-Holger Maehle and Ulrich Tröhler skillfully survey attitudes toward animals and animal experimentation from antiquity through the eighteenth century. At the opposite end of the chronological scale, Judith Hampson's contribution is barely historical at all. She focuses on the nuts and bolts of Britain's new Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act - which in May 1986 replaced the famous 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act - and on the current state of analogous legislation in continental Europe and the United States. The third essay outside the nineteenth-century boundary is the gem of the collec- tion: Christopher Lawrence's brilliant analysis of a 1928 film of Harvey's experiments 652 Bull. Hist.

From Lawrence's detective work, it is clear that the filmed experiments were performed "illegally," though the administrators of the Cruelty to Animals Act obligingly concealed the technical violation. More deeply, Lawrence argues that the film served the professional ends of modern experimental medicine by promoting a naively positivist conception of science in two intertwined ways: (1) because it smoothly "reproduces" experiments, the film conceals the local contin- gencies encountered in real attempts at experimental replication, and (2) the film severely constrains the context and meaning of the experiments it depicts. Lawrence's essay is a tour de force, with major implications for all films about experi- mental science. It would have been better still had he emphasized that the powerful 1928 Harvey film (which I have seen) is a travesty of the historical record, distorting beyond recognition the work and significance not only of Harvey himself but also of Galen, Servetus, and Vesalius. The nine essays in the chronological core of the volume, for all their scholarly virtues, do not match Lawrence's essay in originality or impact. Leaving aside Schup- bach's piece on iconography, this core consists of four essays on the vivisection controversy in Victorian Britain; four on the dispute in Europe (one each on France, Germany plus Switzerland, Italy, and Sweden); and one on the controversy in the United States from 1880 to World War I. Two of the four British-centered pieces, Diana Manuel on Marshall Hall and Stew- art Richards on Burdon Sanderson's 1873 Handbook of Physiology, are noteworthy because they alone of the essays in the collection pay close attention to the "inter- nalist" side of things - to the actual experimental techniques used by nineteenth- century physiologists and the scientific knowledge gained thereby. Rupke empha- sizes the extent to which the vivisection debate pitted established "estates" (aris- tocracy, clergy, and judiciary) against an ascendant professional science whose repre- sentatives defended animal experimentation even when they did not practice it themselves (his exemplar being the comparative anatomist Richard Owen). Mary Ann Elston's rich discussion of the links between anti-vivisection and the women's movement in Victorian Britain includes an uncommonly sympathetic portrait of the leading anti-vivisection "agitator," Frances Power Cobbe. Even collectively, however, these four essays on the late Victorian British period do little to alter the basic out- lines of the story as already told by French. Surprisingly, that is almost equally true of the essays on the vivisection debates in late nineteenth-century Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States, debates that French's book largely ignored. The problem here is two-fold. As the contributors recognize but do not adequately stress, anti-vivisectionist agitation in these countries was confined to a tiny and ineffectual minority who failed to achieve national legislative success. Second, insofar as anti-vivisection sentiment was mobi- lized at all in these countries, it followed and depended upon the English movement. In defense of vivisection, T. H. Huxley once claimed that legislation against the prac- tice would mean that Britain would end up importing its physiology, like its best wines, from France and Germany. What these essays show is that England had some- thing to export in exchange, namely, anti-vivisectionist agitation - as French, once again, noted long ago. Rupke suggests that the vivisection debates were similar everywhere (p. 4), but that was partly because of the role of "outside agitators" from England. In èia, there</page><page sequence="3">654 BOOK REVIEWS, Bull Hist Med, 1989, 6$ were some interesting national differences even within the anti-vivisectionist move- ment itself. In Switzerland and Germany, as Tröhler and Maehle point out, the des- perate movement sought to benefit from anti-Semitism, including a simultaneous campaign against kosher butchering. More generally, Continental anti-vivisectionists could draw on philosophical and especially Kantian themes, while their Anglo- American counterparts had to exploit more "sentimental" arguments in the face of pervasive utilitarian attitudes. (Interestingly, only Susan Lederer, in her fine discus- sion of the American debate, displays any real skepticism toward the medical utility of vivisection, which the editor and other contributors simply take for granted.) Most important, there were (and are) very striking differences between predomi- nantly Protestant and Catholic countries in attitudes toward animals and animal experimentation. Anti-vivisectionism is clearly a Protestant and above all an English phenomenon; the issue has never aroused comparable passion in largely Catholic countries (indeed, Spain lacks any pertinent legislation to this day). Rupke draws attention to this pattern in his introduction, but he is too cautious in suggesting that further research is required to clarify and explain it. Among the contributing factors - national differences in social stratification, the role of women, and levels of urban- ization, industrialization, and "modernization" - one is paramount: deeply rooted religious-cultural attitudes toward animals and our relation to them. In the Roman Catholic tradition, as Maehle and Tröhler amply demonstrate in chapter 2, animals have ever been denied a soul and have thus been sharply distin- guished from humans both in their capacity to feel pain and in their "rights" or claims on human compassion. In late nineteenth-century Protestant England, by con- trast, where industrialization and urbanization evoked nostalgia for an Arcadian past and where evolutionary (if by no means always Darwinian) modes of thought were widely disseminated, the distinction between humans and animals was less sharply drawn. Especially in the case of pets and above all dogs of proper pedigree, the English attitude toward animals reeked of anthropomorphism, sometimes bizarrely so. Given these national-cum-religious differences, it is unfortunate that this volume contains only two essays on predominantly Catholic countries. And one of them, Paul Elliott's piece on nineteenth-century France, is less about the vivisection controversy per se than about the rise of physiology as an independent discipline there. (Elliott's main goal is to dispute John Lesch's thesis, in his Science and Medicine in France [1984], that experimental physiology emerged from the Paris Faculty of Medicine. In his valuable if somewhat intemperate corrective, Elliott briefly directs our attention to the neglected French veterinary schools but deals mainly with the more familiar role of the Parisian Academy of Sciences.) Far more pertinent here is the other essay about a predominantly Catholic setting, Patrizia Guarnieri's piece on Moritz Schiff and the vivisection controversy in Flor- ence, here translated from the original Italian. In her witty but dismissive portrayal of "Florentine" anti-vivisectionism as a feeble English import (chiefly through Cobbe) which appealed only to a declining local aristocracy, Guarnieri provides a wonderful exemplification of her thesis that the history of the vivisection controversy "is also the story of a cultural confrontation . . . [that] can reveal a great deal about different values and mentalities." That message, if sometimes muted in the individual contri- butions to this volume and in the editor's arrangement of them, is the central lesson of this important book.
