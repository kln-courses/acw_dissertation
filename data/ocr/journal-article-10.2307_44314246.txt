<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol 57 y No. 1 (Autumn 2007) From Ahasvérus to Orpheus: Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke Johannes Wich-Schwarz The Prague-born poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) provides an important case study for the ambivalent appropriation of Christian discourse in modernist literature. His crowning poetic achievements of the Duino Elegies (1912-22) and the Sonnets to Orpheus (1922) are milestones in twentieth-century attempts to create a mythology that no longer relies on the philosophical and religious framework of Christianity. Yet in contrast to many other modernist writers, Rilke is still deeply involved in an (albeit discarded) Christian heritage. In this essay, I want to demonstrate that - paradoxically - he crucially draws on Christ imagery to express a post- Christian worldview. I offer an interpretation of two Rilke texts neglected by previous scholarship: Visions of Christ (1896-98) and The Letter of the Young Worker (1922). These texts, despite their status as "minor works," play a key role in Rilke's oeuvre. In the following, I present these two texts and show how they demonstrate Rilke's literary re-imagining and transformation of Christian tropes and narratives.1 Much has been made of Rilke's intense Catholic upbringing. Critics have frequently admonished his mother, Sophie Rilke (1851-1931), for her alleged religious fanaticism in raising her only child. Various anecdotes have provided material for those who want to explain Rilkes "almost excessive anti-Christian attitude"2 (letter to Marie von Thum und Taxis, December 1 7, 1912 [Rilke Briefe 379]) by referring to harrowing childhood experiences.3 But regardless of the possible biographical roots for Rilkes rejection of Christianity, his mother's efforts at providing a religious education did bear fruit in one respect: the ubiquitous presence of Christian imagery and narratives during his upbringing furnished Rilke with a point of reference against which he could develop his personal notions of the spiritual life. 87</page><page sequence="2">88 Johannes Wich-Schwarz Visions of Christ Arguably, Visions of Christ represents Rilkes first substantial literary work. lhe eleven pieces that make up the cycle of narrative poems certainly do not possess the poetic finesse of the later New Poems, but in terms of original thought they are more compelling than the majority of the juvenilia written before the Book of Hours . This originality may be a result of the personal urgency with which the topic of religion presented itself to Rilke. From a biographical perspective, the cycle is of special significance because it provided Rilke with the occasion to come into initial contact with Lou Andreas-Salomé (1861-1937), who for a brief time would become his lover and who remained a close friend and confidante throughout his life. In 1897, in his first letter to her, he praises her essay "Jesus the Jew," published the previous year. Two aspects of the essay may have particularly resonated with him.4 Andreas-Salomé places Jesus into the context of the this-worldliness of Judaism, which stands in stark contrast to the focus on the afterlife common to other religious traditions (Andreas-Salomé 347). A similar rejection of a hereafter would become a recurring topic in Rilkes critique of Christianity. Furthermore, Andreas-Salomes essay conflates the religious and the aesthetic spheres: But it may happen that what a religious genius internally experiences on an individual and hidden level ... produces an absolutely appropriate articulation in words and images, so that, as in the work of a poet the highest artistic dream appears, the highest religious dream of humankind appears before us in complete perfection as if it were graspable and shaped [plastisch]. (344) In his response to Andreas-Salomé, Rilke relates the essay to his work in progress, the Visions of Christ: Dr. Conrad sent me the April 96 issue of the Neue Deutsche Rundschau. A letter of Conrad pointed me to an essay in it, Jesus the Jew . Why? At the time, Dr. Conrad had read a few parts of my Christ-Visions (five are supposed to be published shortly in the "Gesellschaft") and assumed that sparkling essay would be of interest to me. He was wrong. It wasn't interest that drew me further and further into this revelation; a trusting faith led me upon the earnest path, and finally it was like jubilation inside me: finding what my dream epics give in visions to be articulated in such masterly clarity with the gigantic thrust of a holy conviction.</page><page sequence="3">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 89 [T]hrough the uncompromising force of your words my work received in my mind a blessing, a sanctification. I felt like one whose great dreams with all their good and evil have been fulfilled because your essay corresponded to my poems like dream to reality [,] like wish to fulfillment.5 (letter to Lou Andreas-Salomé, May 13, 1897; Briefwechsel 9-10) The rhetorical gestures of this passage include various religious terms. Andreas-Salomes essay engenders a "sanctification" of Rilkes poetry- a reversal of sorts is taking place here: whereas Andreas-Salomé infuses the religious sphere with aesthetic terminology, Rilke uses the language of the sacred to characterize the elevation of his poetic work. Both essay and poetry cycle for the most part renounce conventional religious beliefs but continue nonetheless to adhere to the linguistic forms of sacred discourse. Rilke ultimately withdrew the poems from publication. He may have feared offending the conventional Christian attitudes of his surroundings or may have felt that these poems were an integral part of his personality and were still in the process of becoming. In response to a request for their publication, he wrote: "I have many reasons to suppress the Christ images - for a long, long time to come. They are what is developing, that which accompanies me my whole life" (letter to Wilhelm von Scholz, February 19, 1899; qtd. in Schnack 80). Rilke continued to hold the cycle in the highest esteem. In 1912, after having written the New Poems and the Malte novel, he still referred to the Visions of Christ as "great poems" (letter to Lou Andreas-Salomé, January 10, 1912, Briefwechsel 258) and once more considered their publication. One year later, Andreas-Salomé argued for a continuity between the Visions of Christ and the Duino Elegies (at this time, the first two elegies had been written): In terms of tone they stand so far apart from the two present, latest poems,- but all that you have created moves unfailingly [einheitlich] between these bygone Christ visions and the coming angel visions. (letter to Rilke, July 24, 1913; Briefwechsel 301) In Andreas-Salomés reading, the Visions of Christ possess the status of an anticipatory work: a direct line can be drawn from them to Rilkes mature oeuvre. But the poems were not made public until after Rilkes death. A few excerpts appeared in the 1930s, but only in 1957, over half a century after their composition, were the poems published in their entirety.</page><page sequence="4">90 Johannes Wich-Schwarz The cycle is unfinished. On a manuscript sheet, Rilke jotted down the titles for seven of the eleven existing poems. Ernst Zinn, the editor of the Sämtliche Werke - the standard edition of Rilkes works - added one untitled poem to this list, and published them as the first series. The three remaining poems comprise the second series, which, in Rilke's intention, was projected to bring the cycle to its conclusion.6 The cycles title, Visions of Christ, points to a structural aspect that unites the poems. With the exception of the final poem, "The Nun," all pieces revolve around the mysterious appearance of a male figure, for the most part in a contemporary turn-of-the century setting. This figure carries traits of Jesus, yet virtually always appears in a context of suffering rather than of salvation. This early cycle already encapsulates two primary components of Rilke's understanding of the Jesus figure:7 a profound empathy with the suffering Jesus combined with a refusal to ascribe any kind of salvific power to him. Similarly, the notion of vision that underlies the cycle does not imply prophetic writing in the vein of poets such as Blake and Hölderlin. Rilke's visions do not intend to usher in a process of religious renewal; rather, they seem like religious nightmares gesturing towards the loss of faith. Jesus, the founding figure of Christianity, is transformed into a figure that suggests the irrelevance of the faith derivative of his name. The fifth poem, "The Fair," - at 165 lines the longest of the eleven poems- functions as narrative hub of the cycle. It is the only piece that introduces a first-person narrator into the plot.8 The poem's events take place during the Oktoberfest in Munich, with its plethora of frivolous, even coarse amusements. The narrator explicitly includes himself in the ribald atmosphere of the festivities: I also moved aimlessly through the labyrinth of paths and idly glanced into the full light, and sometimes, like other rascals, I'd touch the face of a pretty girl coming my way with my gallant and daring peacock-feather. And afterwards a silvery giggle from blossoming lips could assure me that the dear little one was not upset. (11. 42-49; S W 3:144) Sauntering along the fair-ground and moving from attraction to attraction, the narrator finally reaches the outskirts of the fair. Above the door of an</page><page sequence="5">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 91 obscure stall he reads the inscription, '"The Life of Jesus Christ and his Suffering" (1. 63; SW 3:145). He pays the admission fee, and finds himself alone inside the booth. The poem does not furnish exact details, but it is clear that the narrator witnesses an uncanny staging of the gospel story. Apparently, images of central events in the life of Jesus are projected on a screen, while a hidden voice delivers various lines from dialogues between Jesus and his adversaries.9 The poems I finds himself irresistibly drawn into the drama of the crucifixion, culminating in Jesus s desperate lament found in Matt. 27:46 and Mark 15:34 (the opening line of Psalm 22): "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" In its reformulation of the biblical text, the poem pushes Jesus s question precariously close to being a proposition: "My God, my God- how you have forsaken me?" (1. 1 10; SW 3:146). The transition in the German original is made from "Mein Gott, mein Gott, warum hast du mich verlassen?" (Gospels and psalm) to "Mein Gott, mein Gott, was hast du mich verlassen?" (1. 1 10). 10 Replacing "warum" by "was" metrically levels the line into iambic pentameter while semantically intensifying the tone of despair. Using "was" as a substitute for "warum" is possible in colloquial German; this usage frequently adds an implication of reproach. In the context of the poem, this word choice amounts to a switching of speech acts. The original biblical formulation retains a scope of faith because the question need not be read as a rhetorical question; it may still be implying (or hoping) that a divine plan is in place. Rilkes reformulation pronounces the finality and unredeeming nature of being forsaken by God. At this point in the poem, a crucial perceptual shift occurs, formally indicated by a move into the present tense. The narrator, spellbound by the image of the crucifix, suddenly experiences a vision of Jesus loosening his hands from the cross, and uttering an even darker truth while addressing the narrator directly: his white hands lightly remove themselves from the cross, and he moans: "Its me." For a long while I listen; and his words fade,- Then it whispers again: this is my curse. Ever since the disciples, deceived by the vainglorious boasting of their faith, stole me from the grave, there is no pit left that will keep me. As long as stars are reflected in brooks,</page><page sequence="6">92 Johannes Wich-Schwarz as long as the sun calls spring with its bacchanals to redeemed valleys, I will have to roam through the world. From cross to cross I have to pay penance: wherever they plant a cross into the ground, I have to go there in bloody sandals Do you know the legend of the Wandering Jew? I myself am that old Ahasvérus. (11. 114-16, 120-30, 143-44; SW 3:147- 48) These lines initiate a radical transformation of the Christ figure. The poems Christ proclaims the atonement, the salvific aspects of his death on the cross, to be a hoax; in a grim parody of the resurrection, Rilkes Christ equates himself with Ahasvérus, the Wandering Jew. The original Christian legend depicts this figure as a person who had refused to grant Christ a moment of rest while he was carrying his cross to Golgotha. As a result, Christ condemned him never to die but to walk the earth eternally, never being allowed to remain in one place until the Second Coming. In Rilkes poem, it is Christ who must wander the earth, doomed to a resurrection that is only the resuscitation of a corpse.11 Rilkes equation of Christ with the Wandering Jew makes apparent the narrative device underlying the entire cycle. The appearances of Christ in the various settings of the other poems can be read as manifestations of this tortured and restless figure. The poem "The Fair" is the conceptual center from which the Christ figure commences on its various journeys. Very much in accord with the legend of Ahasvérus, Rilke s Wandering Christ shows up in all kinds of unexpected locations. Just as Ahasvérus is destined to wander the earth, the Christ of the cycle must "pay penance" (1. 164) for the alleged hoax by appearing in diverse roles throughout the poetic geography of the Visions of Christy taking on human guilt but without the ability to provide redemption. In the first three poems of the cycle, Christ appears among a gathering of children. The first, "The Orphan," is set in a cemetery where a little girl has just witnessed the beggarly, "last rate" (1. 2; SW 3:129) funeral of her mother. Mourning her loss, the girl attempts to console herself by imagining how wonderful and comforting it must be in heaven. But then she interrupts her solitary musing and begins to take note of her surroundings:</page><page sequence="7">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 93 Then the little one looks up from her musings: Spring waits around her with a thousand blossoms Oh, how glorious is God s world and how new, as if God has created it just now; its a jubilation to the little one- and she laughs. (11. 27-28, 32-34; SW 3:130) The lines represent a central aspect in Rilkes rejection of Christianity. He envisions a movement away from meditations on life after death to an opening up toward the present moment. Spring is the season symbolizing this presence; it is no coincidence that this is the season most often mentioned in the poem cycle. Echoing Romanticisms turn toward nature, Rilke celebrates the replenishing of life in the external world; significantly, he foregoes all references to Easter, the Christian narrative associated with the season of renewal. In "The Orphan," the anticipation of this-worldly fulfillment is interrupted by the appearance of a "man so motionless and so tired" (1. 36). His desolate demeanor prompts the girl to ask him whether his mother has also died (1. 47-48); his presence renews the girls wish to be reunited with her mother and rekindles her anxieties concerning the next world: Then the little one is afraid again. Again, it gnaws at her heart like a wild pain; she huddles up closer to the gray one: "Isn't it true, you know it, I'll see her again in heaven- isn't it true - it's what the pastor says?" The word dissipates, a quiet cricket hums, the little one listens, a white moth flutters, the little one listens, from far-away huts rises a quivering smoke ... The tall gray one is silent. (11. 59-67; SW 3:131) The mans reaction to her imploring questions brings to the surface the religious crisis underlying the narrative. The girls eager expectation of an affirmative response, underlined by the repetition of "the little one listens," is frustrated by the poems final words, "the tall gray one is silent." This silence indicates the loss of assurance in a transcendent realm; the mans lack of response signifies a reluctance to admit that the comfort of a life hereafter is illusory. The figure to which the girl turns to find comfort is not capable of providing this comfort. The poems end throws a new light on its title: the</page><page sequence="8">94 Johannes Wich-Schwarz girl is an orphan not only because her mother has died but also because the notion of a transcendent realm that would restore meaning is all but lost. The second poem, "The Idiot," sets in with a depiction of joyous children in summer, teasing each other on the way home from school. The idyllic scene is interrupted by the appearance of "the idiot." Initially, he is described as a threatening, horrific figure, causing the children to flee in panic: Pale as in death he stands and searches. And the children in panic and in sweat rush past. Also Anna. And now he sees her - a scream. He breaks through the ranks and grabs her and tears her dress in two: "Stand!" And the poor child feels she's about to die. (11. 52-63; SW 3:133) These lines imply a disturbing interpretation: it sounds as if the "idiot," the cycles second manifestation of the Christ figure, is about to abuse the child sexually. Again, Rilke creates an image far removed from the conventional notion of Christ as redeemer of humankinds sins. But at this point, the poem turns. As Anna looks into the terrifying mans face, a change occurs: Has he performed a miracle? She looks at him in amazement: the stranger s eyes are not strange to her. And a great sense of trust comes over her. (11. 68-71; SW 3:133-34) What follows is a peculiar scene of recognition and consolation. It remains unclear whether the man is actually Annas long-lost father, or whether he is simply playing that role in order to comfort her. After this portrayal of mutual affection, the mysterious figure confesses his powerlessness: ... "I can give you nothing, little one-" He throws only a tired smile towards her: Tm so much poorer than you are." (11. 1 12-14; SW 3:135)</page><page sequence="9">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 95 The figure takes on the characteristics of Christ- the poems final lines, Annas statement, '"Mother, I saw a man Jhe was- like the man on the cross!"(l'Ę 126-27), substantiate the Christ allusion- but with an important qualification. Like Jesus on the cross, he is completely powerless. Yet in contrast to the Christ of the Church tradition, this powerlessness does not transform into any kind of salvific sacrifice. Instead, we find here two main aspects of Rilkes understanding of Jesus: profound empathy for the human suffering of Jesus but a refusal to grant him divine attributes. The third poem, "The Children," draws together several of the previous motifs. Once again Christ is found among children. Yet this time, he is not placed in opposition to the joyfulness of spring; on the contrary, the Christ figure and the season of renewal merge: And as around an early day in spring the blossoms, suddenly awake, in amazement gather, the children came to the wondrous one whom none of the elders wants to acknowledge. (11. 5-8; SW 3:136) This poem gives the most positive rendition of the Christ figure in the whole cycle. As in the first two poems, Christ is depicted as a figure of sorrow; yet this time, he is able to give comfort to those in need, specifically to a little boy who has lost his mother. His comforting becomes possible because the boy has already encountered the impact of human suffering. Another recurrent topic of the cycle is the anguished relation between religion and sensuality. In this respect, these early poems already anticipate Rilkes critique of Christianity voiced in The Letter of the Young Worker. In the Visions , two poems thematize this issue. In "The Night," the Christ figure is transported into the setting of a sordid night club. For the biblical Christ, such surroundings fit his preference of keeping company with marginalized groups of society. But Rilkes Christ is not out to extend any kind of salvation; he himself indulges in the sensual bacchanal. He confesses to his female companion that he once did think that he was God and recounts a biblical encounter with the high priests. Yet he no longer believes in his own divinity; his final lines, addressed to the woman, express his shedding of all such pretensions: We are the eternal hereditary curse of this world: I the eternal delusion- you the eternal whore. (11. 115-16; SW 3:152)</page><page sequence="10">96 Johannes Wich-Schwarz These lines present a sweeping rejection of Christianity. The world seems to offer only two equally desperate alternatives: the "eternal delusion," which allegedly characterizes all religious truth claims, or the degeneration of human love into prostitution. Neither a sustaining religious impulse nor a notion of flourishing human relationships comes into view. A different perspective is taken in "The Nun" The poem presents a dialogue between a nun and her "blonde sister" (1. 1; SW 3:166) visiting the convent.12 The narrative essentially relates a conversion attempt gone awry. Initially, the sister asks the nun to share with her the mystery of faith: Tell me of Christ, whose bride you are, who has chosen you. And open my ear to his love, whose voice you are. Let me also live in his sadness, whose comfort you are! (11. 24-29; SW 3:167) The nun then begins to describe the bliss she experiences in following Jesus; yet amidst her words, the sisters embrace and kiss each other, and the scene takes on an erotic quality: The girls bent towards one another, body to body: it was as if the same storm touched and flowed around them, and then lifted the blonde one up into a summer, in which she matured -into a woman. Because she kissed the sister with unfamiliar kiss, and smiled in unfamiliar fashion: "Forgive me, - I have to. - Do you still remember the blond companion? And towards white targets we threw slender lances in the old park: That one is now strong." (11. 61-72; SW 3:168-69) What began as an initiation into the wonders of faith has turned into a charged sexual scene, shifting between homo- and heterosexual impulses. The blonde sisters kiss has become "unfamiliar" (fremd); it is no longer merely a sisterly sign of affection but the gesture of a sexually mature woman. The evocation of a childhood scene underscores the eroticism; with</page><page sequence="11">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 97 its intense phallic imagery ("is now strong" may refer to either "companion" or "lance"), the narrative is pushed into heterosexual terrain. The scene is not concerned with the eroticism often found in the medieval mystical discourse of Christ as bridegroom and female believer as bride. Rather, the sexual tension reverberates between the two sisters. The blonde sister s longing for God is replaced by a sensual yearning devoid of any religious aspirations. This shift from the religious to the secular sphere indicates a narrative reversal. Initially, the sister had come to the nun in order to find solace in the religious realm. But as a result of their encounter she asserts her sexual coming of age. The nun is petrified by this turn of events and is incapable of giving her sister the blessing the latter yearns for: The blonde one was frightened; for no blessing came, and fearfully she asked: "So are you angry with me?" The holy one dreamed: I care about you. And held out her hand to the sister, empty,- as if she were pleading: give. (11. 77-82; SW 3:169) The final lines indicate a defeat of the spiritual path. The nun, who originally was depicted as the resourceful one, now stretches out her hands in a gesture of longing. She has nothing to give to her sister, the representative of the outside world; instead, she urgently wants to receive something from the world beyond the convent, wants to take part in the sensual aspects of earthly life. The poem amounts to a rejection of monastic life in favor of embracing a world that is not in need of religious grounding. The Letter of the Young Worker In his mature poetry, beginning with the New Poems (1903-1908), Rilke continues to employ biblical motifs, yet for the most part he draws on imagery from the Hebrew Bible. When he does use explicitly Christian topics, as for example in the poem "Mount of Olives" of 1906, he focuses on the vulnerability and human suffering of Jesus, who laments the absence of God. Similarly, the late poem, "Christs Descent into Hell" (1919), portrays a Christ disrobed of his salvatory powers. The descent pictured in the poem is a counter story to the medieval Church narrative of a victorious Christ ("The Harrowing of Hell") recovering souls from the "kingdom of death."</page><page sequence="12">98 Johannes Wich-Schwarz The poem ends with Christs anguished silence, signifying his inability of providing help. Finally, the Duino Elegies and The Sonnets to Orpheus , both completed in February 1922, have overcome almost all reliance on Christian imagery and narratives; in its place, they develop a mythic language that revolves around the figures of the angel and the ancient singer Orpheus. But matters things are complicated by an astonishing prose text, eventually titled The Letter of the Young Worker , which Rilke wrote as a companion piece to the Elegies and Sonnets . It was written between February 12 and 15, 1922- that is, between the completion of the tenth and the composition of the fifth elegy. At this point, the first series of the sonnets had also been completed. In the Letter , Christianity and the figure of Christ, both conspicuously absent from the lyrical output of February 1922, take center stage. The text sets up the following writing situation: a young, unnamed factory worker is writing down his thoughts on Christianity in a letter to "Mr. VT (SW 6:1111) who is generally assumed to be the Flemish poet Émile Verhaeren (1855-1916), one of Rilkes Paris friends. Three years after Verhaerens death, Rilke wrote: This great poet, who was killed in such brutal fashion in the middle of the war at the train station of Rouen, was to me a wondrous and mighty friend; some time I will tell you about him, how more and more he was able to direct all the force and wooing [Werbung], which people throw towards God, upon humans ... I have lost in him, the great one, that person who most fervently was able to encourage me in my tasks. (letter to Adelheid von der Marwitz, January 14, 1919; Briefe 569-70 [emphasis in the original]) This passage posits Verhaeren as a role model for Rilkes own poetic goals; Verhaerens movement away from God toward the mortal realm indicates the trajectory of Rilkes late writings. But what exactly is the link between The Letter of the Young Worker and Verhaeren? That "Mr. VT stands in for Verhaeren is suggested by the original title of the Letter , "Erinnerung in Verhaeren" ("Recollection in Verhaeren") (SW 6:1507). Initially, the young worker implies that he needs to write to Verhaeren because he has been moved by the reading of the poems. But he then immediately subverts this interpretation:</page><page sequence="13">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 99 The day after the reading I found myself by chance amidst a Christian congregation, and maybe this event was the actual thrust which caused the ignition that is generating so much movement and pressure that I am steering towards you with all my force. (SW 6:1 1 1 1) The passage indicates that Verhaerens work itself is not the initial reason for the worker s epistolary activity; a quite different reason is given, that is, the experience of a Christian congregation. An antagonism is being built up here between the Christian environment and the sphere of Verhaeren. It is as if the young worker has been so shocked by the encounter with Christianity that he needs to seek refuge in Verhaeren. As we come to realize at the end of the Letter , Verhaeren stands in for a literature that praises this world instead of seeking an other-worldly realm, the kind of.escapism which Rilke associated with Christianity. The movement from the Christian meeting toward Verhaeren is framed in explicitly technological terms. Fittingly, the factory worker employs the imagery of a car being started and set into motion with full force. More precisely, he casts himself into the role of a car being propelled forward toward Verhaeren. The imagery points to Rilkes confrontation with the age of modern technology, which was a cause of unease for him. In several of the Sonnets to Orpheus he attempts to come to terms with the technological aspect of modernity.13 Sonnet 18 of the first series (SW 1:742) registers the "droning and vibrating" of the new things and acknowledges, in ironic fashion, the "prophets" - the reader may be reminded of the Futurist movement with its pervasive praise of the technological era- that want to "elevate" the machines. The poems second half paints an ambivalent picture of the new era: See the machine: how it careens and takes revenge and distorts and weakens us. Even if it has force from us, it should, without passion, move and serve. (11. 9-14; S W 1: 742) Rilke finds himself in a dilemma. He wants to do away with allegedly outdated metaphysical frames of reference but is unwilling to fill in the void of meaning with a straightforward praise of technology. Yet in the Letter , in prose, he is able to use technological imagery without qualms. The persona of the young factory worker helps Rilke reach a new level of expressivity.</page><page sequence="14">100 Johannes Wich-Schwarz The main part of the letter consists of an extended discussion of Christ and Christianity. The workers initial criticism of Christ is related to the question of modern civilization and technology: who then is this Christ, who imposes himself on everything.- who knew nothing about us, nothing of our work, nothing of our wretchedness, nothing of our joy, which we achieve, experience and generate today - , and who nonetheless, it seems, again and again demands to be the /irsi in our life. Or is that only put into his mouth? What does he want from us? They say he wants to help us. Yes, but he is quite at a loss near us. His situation was so different. Or would the circumstances really not matter, if he entered here, at my place, in my room, or there in the factory- would everything immediately change, become good? Would my heart beat stronger and continue to move in a different sphere, as it were, and always towards him? My feeling tells me that he cannot come. That there would be no sense to it. Our world is not just externally a different one,- it has no entrance for him. He would not shine through a ready-made garment; it is not true, he would not shine through. It is no coincidence that he walked around in a seamless garment, and I think that the kernel of light, that what made him glow so intensely, has long been dissolved and distributed differently. But I would think that would be the least we could ask of him, if he was that great, that he should have somehow dissolved himself without residue, yes, completely without residue- traceless. (S W 6:1111-12; emphasis in original) At first glance, the passage voices a plain rejection of Christs saving powers. The worker questions Christs ability to help us because the circumstances of his life were so different from the present technological age. Christ would simply not be able to understand our form of life and would therefore be limited in his empathy, and he would be powerless to bring about substantial change. Yet a closer look uncovers how the text subverts this straightforward reading. First, the question, "Or is that only put into his mouth?" points to a distinction between the figure of Christ and the distortions brought about by Christianity that the letter will later expand upon. Second, despite the workers doubts concerning Christs abilities, he nonetheless voices a tentative hope of salvation, "if he entered here ... would everything immediately change, become good?" This fleeting vision of rescue is then connected with imagery we previously encountered in the Letter , "would my</page><page sequence="15">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 101 heart ... continue to move in a different sphere ... always towards him?" This phrase echoes the technological image of the young worker "steering towards [Verhaeren]." For a brief moment, Christ is placed alongside Verhaeren and posited as an ideal that the young worker is heading toward. This possibility seems to be immediately rejected: "Our world is not just externally a different one, - it has no entrance for him. He would not shine through a ready-made garment." The critique of modern civilization is akin to Rilkes juxtaposition of tradition and modernity in his famous letter to Witold von Hulewicz: For our grandparents, a "house," a "well," a tower familiar to them, yes even their own dress, their coat, was still infinitely more, infinitely more intimate [unendlich mehr ; unendlich vertrauter]; almost every thing was a vessel in which they found something human and added something human. Now, arriving from America, empty meaningless things are making their appearance, pseudo-things, life-dummies. (letter to Witold von Hulewicz, November 15, 1925; Briefe 898-99) The Letter also associates Jesus with a past time in which the things of our everyday environment ("a 'house,' a 'well,' a tower") allegedly were filled with meaningfulness. More precisely, it implies that the artificial, "ready- made" things of the present "American" age prevent meaning from shining forth. The Letter enacts a shift in the perception of Christ that has the effect of integrating his Christ into the world of Rilkes mature oeuvre. This integration proceeds in two steps. First, the Letter introduces the idea of Christ dissolving his essence: "we could ask of him, if he was that great, that he should have somehow dissolved himself without residue." This image is a direct reflex of the poetry Rilke had been writing only a few days before the Letter . The final poem of the first series of the Sonnets to Orpheus takes up the myth of Orpheuss death - according to Ovid, he was torn to pieces by the Maenads - and celebrates the reverberations of Orpheuss dismemberment: O you lost God! You infinite trace! Only because finally hate tore you apart and dispersed you, are we now the listeners and a mouthpiece of nature. (11. 12-14; S W 1:748) The dissolution of Orpheus constitutes an immanent pantheistic "spreading out" of the divine. This event gives humans the ability not only to listen to</page><page sequence="16">102 Johannes Wich-Schwarz nature but also to give nature a voice. In similar fashion, the young worker contemplates a dissolution of Christ. The idea of a "vanishing Christ" is further developed in the following passage; it is here that the Letter envisions a completely new version of the figure of Christ. This reimagining is centered in the cross: I cannot imagine that the cross , which was only a crossroad, was supposed to remain. It certainly was not intended that we would be marked with it everywhere, like a brand [Brandmal]. It was supposed to be dissolved in himself. After all, is it not like this : he simply wished to create the higher tree, upon which we would be better able to ripen. He, on the cross, is this new tree in God, and we are supposed to be warm, joyous fruits at its top. ... And once I attempted to read the Koran; I did not get very far, but I did understand that here again [as in the Old Testament] there is a powerful index finger, and God stands at the end of its direction, involved in his eternal rising, in an East that never is depleted. Christ Certainly aimed for the same thing. Pointing [Zeigen]. But humans here have been like the dogs that do not understand an index finger and think they are supposed to nip at the hand. Instead of moving on from the crossroad, where the sign-post had been erected into the night of sacrifice, instead of moving on from this crossroad, Christianity has taken its abode in it and has claimed to live there in Christ, although there was no room in him, not even for his mother or for Mary Magdalene, as it is the case with everyone that points, everyone who is a gesture and not a dwelling-place. (SW 6:1112-14; emphasis in original) This passage pronounces a far-reaching shift in the conception of Christ. In The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge (1904-10), Rilkes major prose work, Christ was regarded as a hindrance and blockage on the infinite path to God: Malte wonders why Abelone, his lost lover, did not direct her love toward God; he asks himself: "did she want to avoid Christ? Did she fear to be held up by him half-way, to become a beloved through him?" (S W 6:937 [section # 70]). But in the Letter , Christ is envisioned as someone who wanted to avoid becoming an obstacle on the infinite journey to God. The image of the crucified Christ is radically re-envisioned: the emphasis is not put on the suffering of Christ but on the gesture of pointing. The outstretched limbs of Christ serve as signposts pointing toward the infinite, asking us not to stay in Christ, in whom there is, in fact, "no room." This statement brings</page><page sequence="17">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 103 to mind the pronouncement in the first of the Duino Elegies that "dwelling is nowhere" (1. 53; SW 1:687). By not taking seriously his gesture of pointing, Christianity, while presuming to dwell in Christ, gravely misunderstands Christs original intention. The Letter reclaims Christ for Rilkes worldview. Christ is no longer regarded as promoting forms of escapism and delusional hope for the hereafter but is seen as a figure that potentially can provide help in the this-worldly, though nonetheless infinite, journey toward God. The young worker asserts that Christ simply wanted to point toward the "eternal rising" of God. Christ is no longer an obstacle but an aid on the infinite journey to God. To criticize Christianity for betraying Christs intentions is of course nothing new. The texts originality lies in the explanation it offers for this alleged distortion. The misunderstanding comes about by failing to realize that Christ was pointing not to himself but to God. From this misunderstanding comes Christianity's neglect of this world. The implicit logic at work here states that focusing merely on the figure of Christ and his work of salvation implies that this world is still in need of salvation, is "fallen," and not worthy of praise. Until now, the young worker has presented a kind of theological treatise that integrates the figure of Christ into Rilkes late worldview. At this point, the Letter changes its perspective. The worker relates several personal experiences. He recounts his friendship with a young painter whom he met in Marseille, and with whom he then spent a few days in Avignon in the spring. In Avignon, the young worker experiences for the first time in his life what it means to be on a holiday: And so when I think back to it, those tender and at the same time passionate spring days seem to have been the only holidays I have experienced in my life. The time was ridiculously short, [but] to me, who is not used to spending free days, it seemed expansive. Even more, it almost seems wrong to me to still call something time which was more a new state of freedom, quite palpably a space , a being- surrounded by openness; no fading away. (SW 6:1 1 17; emphasis in original) What is meant by the transformation of time into space? It points toward a release from the shackles of linear time, which is always rushing towards death. The passage gives us an indication of the significance that lies in Rilkes insistence in the Elegies to overcome the dichotomy of life and death.</page><page sequence="18">104 Johannes Wich-Schwarz These two categories imply that time is progressing and that there will be a transition from life to death. But if time is gathered into one space, thereby breaking through the tyranny of linearity, a sense of timelessness may ensue. Two sentences later, this experience is connected with the notion of God: "from these days also stems my experience that to say 'God' was so easy, so truthful, so-as my friend would have said- unproblematically simple" (SW 6:1118). The experience of timelessness has given the young worker the incentive and courage to speak of God. This does not mean arriving at a conviction concerning the existence or nonexistence of God. Rather, the worker s form of life has developed in a fashion that makes using the word "God" a simple and natural affair. The fullness of time and the presence of being become for the young worker synonymous with God. The Letters final main theme concerns the strained manner in which Christianity has dealt with the sphere of sexuality. The worker s critique of Christianity revolves around its attempt to marginalize sexuality: And here, in this love which they call (in an unbearable mixture of derision, craving and curiosity) "sensual" love, it is here that where we probably find the most awful effects of the disparagement of earthly life that Christianity deemed necessary. Here everything is distortion and suppression, although we come into the world out of this deepest event and possess in it the center of our ecstasies. It seems to me, if I may say this, more and more incomprehensible that a teaching which does injustice to us in that realm in which all of creation enjoys its most blissful right is still allowed to persevere, although not proving to be valid, with such consistency. (SW 6:1122-23) The young worker criticizes Christianity for suppressing and denigrating the sexual realm, which makes up the essential expression of our existence here on earth. What the worker asks for is a concept of God that does not exclude and deny but rather supports this aspect of human life: "why do we not belong to God from this place?" (SW 6:1124 [emphasis in original]). The "this" refers to human sexuality in general as well as specifically to the genitalia. This all-encompassing perspective fits into Rilkes project of developing the idea of a "phallic godhead." One month after the Letter , Rilke commented on the necessity to find religious expression for the sexual realm:</page><page sequence="19">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 105 The awful truth is that we do not possess a religion in which these experiences ... are allowed to be lifted into the god, into the protection of a phallic godhead, which may have to be the first [godhead] with which the gods impose themselves [einbrechen] again upon humanity, after such a long absence, (letter to Rudolf Bodländer, March 23, 1922; Briefe 778-79 [emphasis in original]) Similar notions had already been articulated in the "Seven Poems" of 1915 (SW 2:435-38). The third poem anticipates the idea of the crossroad, which has such a prominent function in the Letter , and connects it with phallic imagery. The poem addresses the beloved whose presence is causing sexual arousal in the poems speaker: Already your unknowing call erects the column in my pubic copse. established by you, the image of the god stands at the quiet crossroad beneath my clothes. (11. 3-6; SW 2:436) The "quiet crossroad beneath my clothes" refers to the pubic area, in which the "image of the god" - the phallus - becomes prominent. Extrapolating from the poem, we may say that Christs gesture of pointing toward God includes the concept of Christ receiving his power from the intersection of his limbs, that is, his genitalia.14 In its emphasis on the crucial importance of sexuality for a truthful understanding of Christ, the Letter goes beyond the position of the Visions of Christ. In the poem "The Nun," Christian spirituality and secular sexuality were presented as opposites. Yet in the Letter , Rilke envisions a convergence of the two realms. By integrating Christ into his late worldview, Rilke manages to create a new religious narrative that acknowledges and celebrates human sexuality. The Visions of Christ and The Letter of the Young Worker demonstrate two variant appropriations of a purportedly obsolete religious tradition. In the Visions , Christ imagery paradoxically serves to undermine conventional representations of Christ. But the Letter , written 25 years later, does not merely criticize Christianity; more importantly, it is an artistic attempt to indicate a positive and inclusive version of Christian faith, in accordance with modern sensibilities. By offering a contemporary appropriation of Christianity, Rilke moves beyond the sterile dichotomy of either rejecting</page><page sequence="20">106 Johannes Wich-Schwarz the Christian tradition or blindly embracing it without regard to the realities of twentieth- (and, by extension, twenty-first-) century human life and consciousness. Maryville University NOTES *In her landmark study on poetic re-imaginings of the Jesus figure in world literature, Rosenthal discusses Rilkes appropriation of Christ in the poetry of his middle period, 1904-1913. She contends that "at the very time that modernists were bemoaning the loss of belief in a divine Christ, Rilke took this for granted and turned the loss to his gain. Jesus could still carry the mythic meaning of immanent transcendence" (116). My argument for the two texts discussed here is comparable: the Jesus of the Visions of Christ is explicitly imagined as lacking any kind of salvific power, while in The Letter of the Young Worker , Jesus is envisioned as a figure that points toward "immanent transcendence." 2A11 translations are mine. 3Sieber s biography of the young Rilke, published in 1932, provided the starting point for what Ritmeester calls "particularly crass examples of heterosexism, misogyny, and mother-hatred" that pervade Rilke scholarship (64). See Kuschel 97-100 for a fair-minded account of Rilkes childhood encounters with Christianity. The standard biographies by Freedman and Prater give further information in the context of the overall arc of Rilkes life. 4Windfuhr (138-39) emphasizes a different aspect of Andreas- Salome s essay pertinent to Rilkes concerns: he focuses on her thesis that God, while originally being an anthropomorphic projection, nonetheless undergoes a dynamic development independent of human influence. 5Rilke evidently mixed up the paired expressions in the final sentence. The gist of the passage is that the poems correspond to the essay "as dream to reality" and "wish to fulfillment." 6For further details, see Zinns commentary in S W 3: 790-91. Of the three poems of the second series, only "The Church of Nago" ( SW 3: 161-64) was titled by Rilke. 7Throughout his writings, Rilke almost invariably employs the term "Christ," but it is obvious that his usage of the term does not imply the ascription of any kind of messianic or divine qualities to Jesus. 8The only other, very brief, appearance of a narrating I is found in lines 57 to 59 of "The Church of Nago." The I here personifies the poems voice; it stands outside the actual narrative but is part of the poems dialogical structure: the you whom it addresses is Christ.</page><page sequence="21">Transformations of Christ in Rainer Maria Rilke 107 9Arguably, the poem, written in Munich in October 1896 (presumably after a visit to the Oktoberfest ), describes one of the very first performances of the cinématographe in Germany. According to Prinzler, the invention of the Brothers Lumière had had its Munich premiere on July 11, 1896 (3). Although Prinzler mentions cinematic performances as an attraction of the Oktoberfest only for the following year (5), it is reasonable to assume that Rilke is describing a cinematic encounter here. This assumption is corroborated by the fact that Carl Gabriel, who organized the 1896 premiere, was one of the most important managers ( Schausteller ) of the Oktoberfest (cf. Möhler 108-10). In the early days of the cinema, fairs and amusement parks were the main sites of this new medium. 10A11 standard German Bible translations render Jesuss words on the cross as "Mein Gott, mein Gott, warum hast du mich verlassen?" Despite his Catholic background, Rilke owned and read an edition of Luther s Bible translation. Rilkes copy was published in 1770 in Minden. See Sieverss valuable study of biblical motifs in Rilke for further philological details (8-12). Rilkes stunning familiarity with biblical narratives is well attested. In a letter to his wife he describes his daily routine while composing the New Poems (1903-08): "and mornings and afternoons with the Bible on the reading desk, and evenings without boundaries, and nights rising out of my heart,- and all of this is mine" (letter to Clara Rilke, February 22, 1906; Briefe 117). nThe definitive study examining the literary afterlife of the myth of the Wandering Jew is the book by Anderson. Of all the transformations this motif has undergone in Western literature, none comes near to the drastic re-imagining and reversal in Rilkes poem. 12That "sister" refers to the nuns sibling, and not another nun, is made plausible by the poems end, in which the sister relates a scene that refers to shared childhood memories. 13Mandelkow points out that the Sonnets to Orpheus do not reject technology per se; rather, "the machine has become also for Rilke the ubiquitous symbol of the new era" (403); the poet has to reassess how the literary realm can continue to express the "timelessness of origin" (404) amidst the technological age. 14Rilkes sexualizing of Christ bears remarkable resemblance to D. H. Lawrences depiction of Christ in "The Man Who Died": Lawrence visualizes Christs sexual energy in an encounter, after his return from the dead, with a priestess from the temple of Isis: "He crouched to her, and he felt the blaze of his manhood and his power rise up in his loins, magnificent. / 'I am risen !'"
