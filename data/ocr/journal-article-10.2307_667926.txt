<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Converging Lines of Influence in Cultural Evolutionary Theory MORRIS E. OPLER Cornell University IN A RECENT article Betty Meggers comments favorably on the view that "all cultures are composed of three general classes of phenomena:tech- nology, social organization, and philosophy" and that "of these, technology is primary and determines the content and form of the other two components." She believes that this "reduces the explanation of cultural development to the same terms that physicists use to describe the rest of nature:matter and energy" and that the content of any particular culture depends "on the amount of energy that can be controlled and the efficiency of the technological means of putting this energy to use" (1960:302-3). She tells us that "the law of energy and cultural evolution" was "first set forth" in 1943 by an American anthropologist. So far as I know, Leslie White, the anthropologist whom she names, has made no claim of priority or originality in respect to these doc- trines, and I am sure he will not take it amiss if I call attention to the exis- tence, long before this date, of such formulations and convictions. To begin our appraisal of theories about energy and technology with 1943 cuts us off from ideas and attitudes which I am convinced have been formative and significant for some of the tendencies in anthropology today. It would be surprising if, of all the natural scientists who dealt before 1943 with the transformation and control of power, not one concerned himself with the implications for culture of the harnessing of different forms and amounts of energy. Of course, this is not the case; and anyone who is at all familiar with scientific thought and developments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries will think at once in this connection of the influential German chemist and Nobel laureate, Wilhelm Ostwald, who was interested enough in the relationship of energy to human affairs to espouse a doctrine with declared evolutionary implications which he called "energetics.T1 I call attention to the views of Ostwald not only because they indicate that the conception of a cultural evolution spurred by energy and technology occurred considerably earlier than some realize but because, in their fuller di- mension, they constitute a nexus of associated concepts which coalesced during the industrial and scientific revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries and which continue as a force in the thinking of the 20th century. In my opinion, anthropology, as well as other disciplines, has been and continues to be significantly affected by this constellation of ideas. The impersonal quality of science and natural law, the reproducibility of experiments, and the fact that the products of science increasingly dwarf their creators in size, efficiency, and power tended to focus attention on culture as such, rather than on its 524</page><page sequence="2">Cultural Evolutionary Theory 525 carriers. The dependence of science and technology on the conservation and communication of knowledge-on the development of common labels and vocabularies dramatized the role of the symbol in culture building and stimulated the study of the relationship between language and culture. The success in probing the secrets of nature-the development through scientific research of marvels that overshadow even those pictured in Holy Writ- fostered an impatience with revelation and a generous optimism concerning what could be accomplished in man's interests through the application of science, conceived in practical form as the control and utilization of energy for human purposes. All of these tendencies and convictions are present in the writings of Ostwald and many of his contemporaries. Moreover, although Ostwald, as a chemist, translated the doctrines of the time into terms of energy, the tenets which have been summarized and which he held can be discerned just as readily in the work of the anthropologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Whether or not they were evolutionists, a large number of American anthropologists, including Lewis H. Morgan, John W. Powell, Clark Wissler, and Franz Boas, saw in man's growing ration- ality and application of knowledge to his problems the prospects of a happier and more abundant future. Lewis Morgan envisaged "experience, intelligence and knowledge" ushering in "democracy in government, brotherhood in society, equality in rights and privileges, and universal education (1877:561- 62). Powell was optimistic enough to predict a stage of Enlightenment that would follow mere Civilization (Hallowell 1960:55). Wissler saw mechaniza- tion, spurred by reflective thought and rationalization, as the glory of Western Civilization and the promise of things to come. Religious faith, in his view, was no longer one of the very significant factors in the western world; de- pendence on education and science had supplanted reliance on traditional beliefs (1923:5-10, 187-88, 326-29, 361-64). We can turn as well to Franz Boas for echoes of scientism of this general order. The message of the 12th chapter of The Mind of Primitive Man is that the transition from primitive life to civilization is essentially the substitution of actions performed as means to a rational end for behavior carried out in response to emotional associations. Thus impersonal control or science gradually displaces warm belief (1938: 239-42, 248-52). Nor do we have to search far to find indications in American anthropology of other elements of the idea cluster we are concerned with. A. L. Kroeber's delineation of the cultural realm and the relation of tools and symbols to its emergence is too well known to labor (1952:22-51). Robert Lowie, who, like Ostwald, was much influenced by Ernst Mach and who contributed the article on Mach to the 1924 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana, describes in an autobiographical note his "earlier anticlericalism" and that of his "elders and contemporaries" in the scientific world (Du Bois 1960:10). Much more could be said about the manner in which American anthropologists reflected and shared the scientific postulates which grew up in the 19th century, but we are concerned at the moment with the particular organization of these ideas which Ostwald achieved. [OPLER]</page><page sequence="3">[64, 1962 526 A merican A nthropologist In the first place Ostwald emphasized the importance of the kind of usable energy being considered and the relation of this to the storing-up process, i.e., to the amount likely to remain available. On this point he writes: ... as we have already learned, chemical energy is permanent, while radiant energy is an ex- tremely transitory form of energy, that is, it changes very readily. The very fact that, owing to the change from day to night, the supply of radiant energy periodically ceases, makes the storing- up of energy for the night necessary to the existence of a form dependent upon it. Thus, we recog- nize in the photochemical processes, that is, in the transformation of radiant energy into chemical energy, the foundation of life on earth (Ostwald 1910:169). In another place, with greater stress on its meaning for culture, he phrases the matter thus: We know that we all live by virtue of the free energy that streams from the sun to the earth like a broad and powerful flood, available in an infinitesimal portion for affecting human beings; and that we, who live on the shores of this flood, can draw off a part of this mighty river by dams and machines, and can take possession of it for our purposes. This takes place in the first instance through agriculture and the (still somewhat primitive) cattle breeding by which the chemical en- ergy collected by the plants from the sun's rays can be assigned to the service of man, and changed into the form of nourishment for his various kinds of aims (1913:30). Ostwald is very explicit also about the dependence of progress or evolution, both biological and cultural, upon the efficiency with which the various forms of energy are utilized. In respect to this he declares: Since our opinion as to what constitutes a higher and a lower organism is doubtless arbitrary, let us ask whether it is not possible to find an objective standard by which to measure the relative per- fection of the different organisms. The question must be answered in the affirmative when we take into consideration the following. Since the quantity of available free energy upon the earth is limited, the organism which transforms the energy at its disposal more completely with the least loss into the forms of energy necessary for the function of life, must be regarded as the more per- fect organism. In fact, we observe that with increasing complexity of the organisms there is for the most part also an increasing improvement in that direction, and we can therefore speak of some beings as more perfect than others. This view-point is especially significant in the evaluation of human progress, appearing, as it does, as the general standard of all civilization (1910:176). A little further on in this same volume, under the caption "Civilization," he has this to say about the central place of technology in the development of culture and, indeed, in the very survival of a culture-bearing animal: Everything which serves the social progress of mankind is appropriately called civilization or cul- ture, and the objective characteristic of progress consists in improved methods for seizing and utilizing the raw energies of nature for human purposes. Thus it was a cultural act when a primi- tive man discovered that by throwing a stone he could send his muscle energy a distance of many meters to the desired point. The effect of the knife, the spear, the arrow, and of all the other primitive implements can be called in each case a purposive transformation of energy. And at the other end of the scale of civilization the most abstract scientific discovery, by reason of its general- ization and simplification, signified a corresponding economy of energy for all the coming genera- tions that may have anything to do with the matter. Thus, in fact, the concept of progress as here defined embraces the entire sweep of human endeavor for perfection, or the entire field of culture, and at the same time it shows the great scientific value of the concept of energy. If we consider further that, according to the second fundamental principle,2 the free energy ac- cessible to us can only decrease, but not increase, while the number of men whose existence de- pends directly on the consumption of a due amount of free energy is constantly on the increase, then we at once see the objective necessity of the development of civilization in that sense (1910: 184-85). The key role of technological efficiency in transforming energy into cultural</page><page sequence="4">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 527 materials and in stimulating progress is a refrain to which Ostwald returns again and again. One of his most vivid statements of it is the following: Now the decisive law for the application of the free energy, on which therefore all life depends, is to the effect that the whole of the free energy is never transmutable into the desired object-form, but only a part of it, while the remaining part, as waste matter corresponding to the shavings or the dust in other technical operations, is not transmutable for the object which is the result of the effort. But exactly as in technical operations the more rationally the construction is managed, the less is the amount of waste matter, mankind also strives quite universally and fundamentally to make the waste of free energy, which it transmutes to its purposes, as small as possible. By that means it is brought about that the mass of transmutable energy devoted to the object becomes so much greater, that man can therefore dispose in his interest of so much greater values. This tendency of world-occurrences and of the small human share in them is avowedly to be grasped in the energetic imperative "Waste no energy; turn it all to account!" And we can easily point out in fact that there is no human action which could not be brought within the viewpoint of this energetic imperative. Here, therefore, we have a genuine and far reaching Monism. From the simplest technical trade, yes from the daily acts of our half-animal life, to the very highest socio- logical and ethical problems, it is the same energetic imperative which teaches us in every case the how and what of our business, which in every case puts a measure into our hands by which we can judge whether the manner in which we transform the free energy for our aims and the aims of the collectivity is actually the best conceivable, or whether there is a still better way. The whole culture-evolution, which has led us from the invention of the slingstone, the lever, fire and what- ever else the primitive human tools are called, to a modern giant steamer, all this technical evolu- tion signifies nothing further than an always finer and more multiform manifestation of the ener- getic imperative (1913: 30-31 ).3 By the turn of the century Ostwald taught, as these citations illustrate, that culture and cultural evolution depend "on the amount of energy that can be controlled and the efficiency of the technical means of putting this energy to use." It is not enough, however, to correct mistaken notions of who first held this particular conception. In order to understand the historical stream of ideas, of which Ostwald's contribution is a part, and in order to comprehend the forces that have shaped our own intellectual life, some other interests and postulates of this gifted scientist should be mentioned. He had, for instance, very strong convictions concerning the importance of symbolism and communication. He felt that science and culture depend heavily upon the ability to husband, share, and communicate experience and knowledge. One of his complaints about organized religion was that it tended to place limits on what could be expressed, investigated, and discussed. In his field of specialization, chemistry, he is noted for his labors in expanding and clarifying the technical vocabulary. He spent his Nobel prize money and much time and effort in an attempt to develop and promote Ido, an international auxiliary language which he con- sidered an improvement upon Esperanto. One who reads and studies Ostwald is also soon aware of his emphasis on the social, collective, and cultural, rather than on the individual, personal, or idiosyncratic. He was impressed by "the powerful effectiveness of organiza- tion" in human affairs. He visualized science and the "energetic imperative" as the forces which would raise standards of living and education everywhere, muting national and international contrasts and jealousies, and paving the way finally for a harmonious, if rather undifferentiated, world community.</page><page sequence="5">528 American Anthropologist [64, 1962 This was, of course, an aspect of his monistic philosophy and vision. At a time when he himself was being singled out as a "leader" in his field, he asserted: At present mankind is in a state of development in which progress depends much less upon the leadership of a few distinguished individuals than upon the collective labor of all workers. Proof of this is that it is coming to be more and more the fact that the great scientific discoveries are made simultaneously by a number of independent investigators-an indication that society creates in several places the individual conditions requisite for such discoveries. Thus we are living at a time when men are gradually approximating one another very closely in their natures, and when the social organization therefore demands and strives for as thorough an equalization as possible in the conditions of existence of all men (1910:185). Even personal satisfaction, according to Ostwald, is to be found not in the exercise of the will, but in the identification of the self with others or with some larger whole. In this vein he wrote: It seems pretty certain that increase of culture tends to diminish the differences between men .... Now if we recall the happiest moments of our lives, they will be found in every case to be con- nected with a curious loss of personality. In the happiness of love this fact will be at once dis- covered. And if you are enjoying intensely a work of art, a symphony of Beethoven's, for example, you find yourself relieved of the burden of personality and carried away by the stream of music as a drop is carried by a wave. The same feeling comes with the grand impressions nature gives us. Even when I am sitting quietly sketching in the open there comes to me in a happy moment a sweet feeling of being united with the nature about me, which is distinctly characterized by com- plete forgetfulness of my poor self. We may conclude from this that individuality means limitations and unhappiness, or is at least closely connected with them (1906).4 It is an interesting and revealing choice of words that leads him to speak of the "burden" of personality. The two other postulates which are prominent in Ostwald's thinking and which are constantly encountered in his writings are scientism and anti- clericism. He had complete confidence in the ability of science ultimately to overcome man's difficulties and to provide handsomely for his needs, practical and ethical. He was impatient with organized religion, which he felt had early capitalized on man's scientific ignorance and which now fostered a "coined" philosophical dualism to protect its domain from the incursions of scientific knowledge. To him this affirmation and negation are opposite sides of the same coin. The advancement of science is dependent upon the diminishing influence of religion. He describes the claims of religion and the dualism on which it is based as follows: The chief means of methodically and purposely accomplishing the independence and where possible the superiority of religion over science consists in the assertion that an insuperable barrier exists between the provinces which religion claims for itself and covers, and those to which science has access. Of course, the province of religion is in that case regarded as the higher, for which there is of course wont to be a lack of theoretical or scientific information. From the asserted existence of these two provinces, separated from one another, the well known reproaches are accordingly brought against science that it abandons the field conceded to it, and undertakes unlawful tres- passes into the other province, that of religion (1913:19). In answer to the argument that religion is an individual, mystical phenom- enon and therefore inaccessible to science, Ostwald points to the work of William James. James, he says, has shown in religious behavior "the com- pletely fixed conformity to law, in accordance with which this appearance is produced? wholly independent of the question whether it fulfils itself within</page><page sequence="6">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 529 Christian or Hindu, Mohammedan or any other form of mysticism." The practical result of William James' researches, according to Ostwald, is "that the absolute boundary maintained by the priests between the respective de- partments of science and of religion does not exist, that rather even if the boundary did formerly exist, it has been more and more pushed back in favor of science, and properly speaking has reached the vanishing point" (1913: 22). While religion divides and clouds men's minds with its claims, science busies itself with prediction ("prophecy" in Ostwald's terminology) and "the rational shaping of life": We know that all sciences have their origin in technique, that is in the solution of some sort of problems which concern practical life. We know, for example, that geometry arose in Egypt out of the fact that the Nile in its annual overflows obliterated the boundaries between the different tracts of land, and that it was consequently necessary to reestablish by fixed structures these boundaries, the physical indications of which were no longer recognizable. We likewise know that chemistry arose out of medicine, out of the art of the restoration and working of metals, out of dyeing and a succession of other arts. Every time, therefore, the case has been that the individual has first transmitted to his immediate successors, who undertook the business, certain recurrent and reproducible experiments which he has made. This knowledge has then slowly grown, until it finally became so rich and complex that it had to be systematically arranged, that its single ele- ments might be available. That then brought about the beginning of a science in the modern sense (1913:29). In this struggle between science and religion, the goal, as Ostwald sees it, is to rescue all branches of knowledge from priestly influence: We have seen in a previous analysis how originally all human knowledge had become united in a single class or rank, that of the priesthood, which controlled not only the religious phase, but also the technical branches of the knowledge of that period; and we have seen how subsequently one branch after another withdrew itself from the control of the priesthood and made itself inde- pendent. .. (1913:33). Logic, mathematics, physics, and chemistry are not "in any important degree any longer subject to the authority of the church." Darwinism was still under fire from religious quarters when Ostwald wrote, and he acidly com- plained: "At present the church conducts itself toward this doctrine just as did Catholicism toward the teaching of Copernicus of the movement of the earth around the sun." Nevertheless, he felt that the battle for the indepen- dence of biology was essentially won and remarks, "After all, biological sci- ence also is at present so far freed from the control of the church that its teachings, even the most modern of them, can without serious outward resist- ance, even if perhaps against many phases of inward opposition, be publicly expounded and applied" (1913:33). The emancipation of psychology was, in his opinion, not so far advanced, "but here too the defence has already become rather weak; and the decisive victory is without great difficulty to be fore- seen" (1913:34). The disciplines which are still under the sway of religious doctrine, accord- ing to Oswald, are political science, sociology, and ethics.5 He is particularly concerned over the continued subordination of ethics to religious belief and voices his objections to this situation and his hopes for the future in these words:</page><page sequence="7">[64, 1962 530 American Anthropologist In particular, however, applied sociology, the doctrine of the mutual relations of men in their community, otherwise known as ethics, is still at present entirely credited to the church as her special domain, in which science has nothing to do, and from which it must accordingly keep away in all respects. The popular religio-moral collections, which are found incessantly repeated in the writings of the churchmen of our day, have no other aim than to keep alive the suggestion that virtue is possible only in the path of religion; while on the contrary, it is at present more and more recognized that to link the hitherto existing technique, the moral conceptions, to religious faith, must lead and has led, owing to the fragile nature of such faith, to a farreaching weakening and even to the destruction of practical morality. In fact, therefore, the matter is in this condition, that just as the other sciences have gradually freed themselves from the influence of the church, ethics must now also be set free from the old influences which the different churches have exerted on it, and still at present claim to exert (1913:34-35). It is interesting to note that what most repels Ostwald about religious doc- trine in the ethical sphere is what he takes to be its static and nonevolutionary nature: But the fundamental unchangeableness of every religious conception which rests with respect to the content of its doctrine on a belief in revelation, and is thus systematically and organically bound up with the whole doctrine, so unconditionally contradicts the fundamental law of all or- ganic life, the fundamental law of evolution, that even without special examination of the separate contents of the doctrine, we must say that no religion can ever exist, which can establish a code of ethics for all time. For if it establishes a system of ethics which may possibly be usable for the twenty-fifth century, this is certainly not available for the twentieth century; and if on the other hand it establishes a system of ethics which was serviceable two thousand years ago, we can then say with the same or even much greater certainty that this system of ethics in its entirety can in- dubitably not be available in the twentieth century. Accordingly, at the present time, the principal task of scientific or Monistic thought and labor is manifestly to free the final science in the succes- sion of sciences, sociology, from the hitherto existing influence of the priesthood, and to establish in place of the traditional ethics dependent on a revelation a rational scientific ethics, based on facts, and taking into consideration the present condition of mankind as well as the course of its evolution into a better future (1913:35).6 The closing paragraphs of the essay from which I have been quoting are a good example of Ostwald's scientism, for in them he asserts that technology is creating on earth for all men the paradise that religion can only promise as a heavenly reward to the faithful: We wish to become finally free from the tutelage of earlier centuries and ages; we wish our life, which we have placed technically and scientifically on a new and better basis in such a fundamental manner, also in our consciousness to be placed by us on a new and better basis. We do not wish to let ourselves be told by a priesthood (largely influenced by self-interest) that we are sinful and cannot reach the heights by our own strength: whereas we can daily convince ourselves of the fact that all which is good and honorable, that has occurred on earth, has been brought to earth by men, and that we daily are winning new victories in our war against misery and disease, against misfortune and the assaults of an untamed nature (1913:35-36). Ostwald's final picture is of a world culture based on the energies provided to man by nature and harnessed by science, a culture which transcends the limitations of the slave-based social and economic order of ancient Greece and the other-worldly barriers of medieval Europe's intellectual life: ... in the mass, when we eliminate the other-worldly tendency of Christianity; in the mass, when we do not merely grasp with the intellect but realize with our whole being that we are children of this world and that the good and the beautiful, in a word the paradise for which we all strive, must be achieved step by step in this world and cannot be postponed to a future over which we have no control; in the mass, we free ourselves from that other-worldly tendency of Christianity, which leads us off the track, and bring ourselves nearer to a unified, in other words a monistic civilization. This possesses in itself the guarantee of a much stronger, greater and more comprehensive life than</page><page sequence="8">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 531 that Greek civilization which was onesidedly directed toward art. For our civilization is founded on labor, in other words on the subjugation and guidance of the rough energies which man finds existing on the surface of the earth, and through the management of which he can make his life increasingly better, happier, richer and more worth living; and it therefore finally extends to all men, instead of remaining like that Greek civilization confined to a certain few (1913:36-37). If Ostwald conceived of a wordly paradise in the making, one in which man's group and personal relations would be as wholesome and supportive as his machines were mighty, it was because he assumed that ideology and social organization are inextricably linked with energy and technology in an evolu- tionary spiral and respond to the same general law. After describing a sequence of inventions or a "technical evolution" as a "manifestation of the energetic imperative," Ostwald declares: The same can be said of our moral evolution. If we no longer carry on the rude warfare of all against all among individuals, but live in a constitutional state, this change in the last analysis signifies nothing but an economy of the energy which the individual formerly had to apply to attack and defence, while he can not apply it to useful work. And if now the farthest-sighted and most eminent men of all nations unite their efforts to overcome the cruel madness of war, and also to find for the opposition of wills among the nations the same way of legal agreement, as it has existed for individuals during centuries, this effort, . . . has no other final ground. The need of dealing as economically as possible with the highest energy of which mankind disposes, namely, human energy, and not destroying it in great masses, as happens in a modern war without any corresponding equivalent whatever, is the final ground of Pacificism (1913:31-32). It is sobering to have to record that this sturdy pacifist, who confidently expected an evolution of morals and social relations that would parallel the strides of the technology in whose service he labored, was the inventor of the Ostwald process for the preparation of nitric acid by the oxidation of am- monia, a process used in Germany during World War I to obtain the nitric acid necessary for the manufacture of explosives. This man who saw such hope- ful evolutionary implications in the emergence of the constitutional state was to die in 1932 with the boastings of the Fascists and the heils of the Nazis ring- ing in his ears. These precepts of the subordination of the individual to the social and of the psychological to the cultural, of the importance of symbols and symbol systems in conserving and perpetuating discovery, of impatience with super- naturalism, of almost unlimited confidence in science, and of the inevitability of an evolution of all aspects of culture stemming from the application of sci- ence to the control of energy and to the perfection of technology are alike shared by Ostwald and by neo-evolutionsits in anthropology. There is good reason for this correspondence or convergence. Both Ostwald and the neo- evolutionists have drunk deep of scientism; they reflect the optimism and the confidence in progress that swept through intellectual life when the triumphs and discoveries of the new physics and chemistry seemed to expand the frontiers of knowledge almost limitlessly and the prospects of their practical application seemed to make poverty an anachronism. But Ostwald was much closer to the source in these matters and spoke out much earlier; there is usually a lag of some decades before one discipline can digest and translate the findings of another. The wheel has continued to turn in natural science. By</page><page sequence="9">532 A merican Anthropologist [64, 1962 this time there are a good many physical scientists who doubt that it is dis- coveries of new forms of energy alone or new technological devices that will lead us out of the wilderness. We hear as much about "nuclear anxiety" as about the "new science" today. I have used Ostwald as an example of the evolutionary scientism which was prominent in his field and in related fields in his day because he was so articu- late and so unequivocal in his position. Yet Ostwald did not stand alone. He had been much influenced by Ernst Mach, the physicist, and both Mach and Ostwald influenced many others. During the very period when evolutionary scientism was emerging, a parallel, and in some respects a competing, doctrine was developing which had its origin in the philosophy of process and change. This doctrine, too, was influenced by the thought currents of the times, and it agrees at many points with the tenets of evolutionary scientism. For one thing it is evolutionary; it pictures a progression of changes in the organization of the state and in prop- erty relations. It emphasizes the overriding importance of social groups and social forces as compared to the individual and the individual will. It considers religion an impediment to progress. It asserts that social relations and idea systems are determined by the technology, and it exploits to the hilt the philo- sophical materialism implied in this determinism. This doctrine, of course, is Marxism. Its main difference from evolutionary scientism is that it stresses the disruptive and painful nature of the shifts in the social and political spheres that necessarily accompany or follow substantial changes in the technology, and that it advocates political action and force to overcome what it considers to be selfish and ill-advised resistance to a higher form of equilibrium. In other words, it demands that, whenever necessary, revolution be a handmaiden to the cultural evolutionary processes. It is also more self-consciously ma- terialistic on the philosophical side. One could quote from almost any of the early Marxists of prominence, beginning with Marx himself, to demonstrate that members of the group be- lieved in an evolution of culture based on advances in technology, an evolution in which all other aspects of culture are shaped and ordered by the state of the technology. Certain of them, including Marx and Bukharin, refer to energy in much the same manner as Ostwald and White do.7 1 shall use as my example of Marxist thought, however, a work by G. V. Plekhanov, the man who is usually considered the founder of Russian philosophic Marxism and who had such a strong influence on Lenin. It was of this man's theoretical work that Lenin said in 1921, " . . . it is the best of its kind in international Marxist literature." It will not be too difficult to find in his writings the Marxist prescriptions we have summarized. The particular work of G. V. Plekhanov which I have in mind, Unaddressed Letters, is not a long one; it runs to only 146 pages. These "letters" are, in fact, related or continued essays on a single topic, the origin and development of art. The author began six such "letters" or essays. Of these, three were pub- lished during his lifetime. The fourth letter was only begun, and the fragment</page><page sequence="10">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 533 of manuscript has not been deemed worth publishing. The fifth and sixth letters were never quite completed and were not published before the death of the author in 1918. The first three letters appeared in Marxist journals in 1899 and 1900 and were included in Volume XIV of Plekhanov's Collected Works after his death. It was not until 1936 that the fifth and sixth letters were edited and found a place in Volume III of the Literary Remains of G. V. Plekhanov. These five "letters" have now been translated into English by A. Fineberg and have been published in book form by the Foreign Languages Publishing House together with another shorter work by Plekhanov.8 The titles and subtitles of the letters give some clue to their contents. When Plekhanov initially published part of the first letter, he called it "Art. A Socio- logical Study." Then he published it in full and called it "Unaddressed Let- ters. First Letter." When the second letter appeared, it was called, more ac- curately, "Unaddressed Letters. The Art of Primitive Peoples." The third epistle bore the title, "Once More on the Art of Primitive Peoples." In other words, this is a treatise on the origin and development of art based on anthro- pological materials. In it Plekhanov attempts to interpret what is often said to be the most subtle and difficult of the fields of human endeavor and to dem- onstrate that even its beginnings and its evolution can be best explained by the materialist conception of history. We are used to thinking that the classic example of the utilization of anthropological materials by a Marxist is the em- ployment of Lewis Morgan's Ancient Society by Frederick Engels in the writ- ing of his The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. Of course, Engels, especially in the revised edition of 1891 of this work, draws also upon the writings of Bachofen, Westermarck, McLennan, Tylor, Kovalevsky, Cunow, Fison, and Howitt. But Engels' command of anthropological materials is extremely modest compared with Plekhanov's tour de force. For Plekhanov shows complete familiarity with the ethnological work of the Americans, Brit- ish, French, Germans, Russians, Scandinavians, Italians, and Poles which was available in his day. He quotes copiously from his sources. He is capable of correcting Herbert Spencer if he misquotes or misinterprets Tylor. He is most ingenious in marshaling his evidence and is, of course, clever and imaginative in making his thrusts and points. When he deals with North American Indian materials, he not only shows familiarity with Morgan but quotes from Boas, Matilda Stevenson, Schoolcraft, John Powell, Lafitau, George Catlin, and James Dorsey, as well. He is no less familiar with the writings of the English; he uses the works of explorers such as Richard Burton, Sir James Tennent, Prescott, Stanley, and Livingstone, of theorists such as Spencer, Maine, Tylor, and Frazer, and of ethnographers such as Edward Eyre, R. H. Mathews, and E. H. Man. He draws examples as readily from the Scandinavians, Norden- skjold and Stolpe, as from the Russians, Kovalevsky and Jochelson. Waitz, Ratzel, Heinrich Cunow, Paul Ehrenreich, von den Steinen, Ernst Grosse, and Wilhelm Wundt are a few of the German authorities to whom he appeals. Among the French scholars, explorers, and anthropologists whose data he utilizes are Gabriel Mortillet, Paul Topinard, Paul du Chaillu, Comte, Tarde,</page><page sequence="11">534 American Anthropologist [64, 1962 Reclus, Renan, and Letourneau. In all, he draws from the writings of ap- proximately 60 anthropologists and travelers. The study of a volume such as this raises interesting questions concerning the place of anthropological ma- terials in the formation of Marxist theory, and the manner in which the rela- tionship between anthropology and Marxist theory has developed since Plek- hanov's day. Plekhanov begins his first letter with a consideration of definitions of art. After quoting Count Tolstoi's opinion that "art begins when a man, with a view to conveying to others an emotion he has experienced, re-evokes it in himself and expresses it in certain outward signs," Plekhanov expresses his dissatisfaction with this and offers his own definition, as follows: I, however, think that art begins when a man re-evokes in himself emotions and thoughts which he has experienced under the influence of surrounding reality and expresses them in definite images. It goes without saying that in the vast majority of cases he does so with the object of conveying what he has rethought and re-felt to other men. Art is a social phenomenon (pp. 8-9). He then quotes another statement of Tolstoi on art in which the author of War and Peace says: "Always, in every period and in every human society, there is a religious consciousness, common to all the members of that society, of what is good and bad, and it is this religious consciousness that determines the values of the emotions conveyed by art." In order to make clear his strong negative position on statements of this kind, Plekhanov explains, he must make sure his readers understand the difference between the idealist concep- tion of history and "its opposite, the materialist conception of history" (p. 9). This leads our author to discuss the views of Auguste Comte, Hegel, and Saint- Simon on the ruling forces in Greek culture. He brands all three idealists and contrasts his own stand with that of the last named: Whereas Saint-Simon, looking at history from the idealist standpoint, thought that the social relations of the Greeks were due to their religious opinions, I, a believer in the materialist view, would say that the republican Olympus of the Greeks was a reflection of their social system. And whereas Saint-Simon, in answer to the question where the religious views of the Greeks came from, replied that they stemmed from their scientific outlook on the world, I think that the scientific outlook of the Greeks was itself determined, in its historical development, by the development of the productive forces at the disposal of the Hellenic peoples (p. 11). Plekhanov asks that his readers assume that his materialist view of history is correct and with him take it as a starting point in the inquiry on art. And he adds, "Needless to say, this inquiry on the particular question of art will at the same time be a test of my general view of history. For indeed, if this gen- eral view is erroneous, we shall not, by taking it as our starting-point, get very far in explaining the evolution of art. But if we find that this evolution is better explained with its help than with the help of other views, we shall have a new and powerful argument in its favour" (pp. 11-12). Thus the evolution of art is to be tested to determine to what degree it can be considered a conse- quence of the evolution of the technology or productive forces, and to the ex- tent that it proves to be a dependent variable, the theory of a cultural evolu- tion paced by the development of the technology will be strengthened. Plekhanov next grapples with the argument that the esthetic sense is innate</page><page sequence="12">OPLER ] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 535 or biologically given. He notes that no less an authority than Charles Darwin has credited the lower animals with an appreciation of beauty and symmetry. If the esthetic sense is inborn, why should it be explained in terms of economics or technology? But Plekhanov calls attention at this point to Darwin's note, "With cultivated men such (esthetic) sensations are, however, intimately as- sociated with complex ideas and trains of thought." This gives Plekhanov his opening, and he makes the most of it. The North American Indians are fond of ornaments made of the skins, claws, and teeth of animals. It is impossible to conceive that the characteristics of color and line of these objects account for their popularity among these Indians. It is "far more likely . . . that these objects were first worn solely as a badge of courage, agility or strength, and only later, and precisely because they were a badge of courage, agility and strength, did they begin to excite esthetic sensations and acquire the character of ornaments" (p. 15). Why does a woman of the Dinka tribe of Africa feel that her beauty is enhanced when she wears 20 pounds of iron rings on arms and legs rather than two? Because her tribe is passing through an iron age and iron is a precious metal. "Precious things seem beautiful because they are as- sociated with the idea of wealth.... Clearly, what counts here is not the beauty of the rings, but the idea of wealth that is associated with them" (p. 16). The Batokas of upper Zambezi knock out their upper incisor teeth because they wish to resemble ruminating animals. "But the Batokas are a pastoral tribe and almost worship their cows and oxen. Here again, that which is precious is beautiful, and esthetic concepts spring from ideas of quite a different order" (p. 16). How are these different orders of esthetic ideas to be accounted for? Plekhanov hints strongly at the answer and tries to make his peace with Dar- winism at the same time when he says: And if the materialist view of history is better adapted to facilitate a solution than any other; if we find that the aforesaid associations and complex ideas are, in the final analysis, determined and shaped by the state of the productive forces of the given society and its economy, it will have to be admitted that Darwinism in no way contradicts the materialist view of history which I have tried to describe (p. 17). Men, and many animals, have a sense of the beautiful, that is, they have the faculty of experienc- ing a particular kind of pleasure ("esthetic") under the influence of certain objects and phenomena. But exactly which objects and phenomena afford them this pleasure depends on the conditions in which they grow up, live and function. It is because of human nature that man may have esthetic tastes and concepts. It is the conditions surrounding him that determine the conversion of this possibility into a reality; they explain why a given social man (that is, a given society, a given people, or class) possesses particular tastes and concepts and not others (p. 20). Now Plekhanov attempts to dispose of Tarde and his laws of imitation. To the argument that imitation plays a large part in the history of ideas, manners, tastes, and customs he replies that we usually imitate those who stand with us against some menacing situation and that contradiction or the principle of antithesis does more to explain matters of taste and cannons of beauty and art than can imitation. In Senegambia, he says, wealthy women wear shoes so small they can walk only with an awkward gait. Yet this gait is</page><page sequence="13">A merican A nthropologist [64, 1962 536 considered very attractive. The gait, he asserts, acquires significance only by virtue of its contrast to the gait of the poor working woman. "Here," he con- tinues, "the operation of the 'principle of antithesis' is plain. But mark that it is induced by social causes, namely, the existence of property inequality among the Senegambia Negroes" (p. 27). Thus Plekhanov manages to pay his respects to the dialectic of Hegel, Engels, and Marx. To the suggestion that it is nature that stimulates esthetic feelings Plek- hanov returns a vigorous denial. He points out that in some periods landscape painting is in high esteem; in others it is ignored or considered tedious. The stimulus is the same; it is the artistic reaction that is different. There are sound historical and social reasons for such differing responses, he claims. Some peoples exaggerate the difference between themselves and other animal life. Others knock out or file teeth or plait their hair into the shape of horns to re- semble more closely various forms of animal life. It begs the question to say these latter are imitating animals for religious reasons: For if primitive man had looked on lower animals with our eyes, they would probably have found no place in his religious ideas. He looks at them differently. Why differently? Because he stands on a different level of culture. Hence, if in one case man strives to resemble lower animals and in another to differentiate himself from them, this depends on the state of his culture, that is, again on those social conditions to which I have referred. Here, however, I can express myself more precisely: I would say that it depends on the degree of development of his productive forces, on his mode oj production . . . At any rate, it is very well known that the ornamental art of primitive-more exactly, hunting- peoples borrows its motifs from the animal world, and that plants have no place in them. And modern science attributes this, too, to nothing but the state of the productive forces .... The Bushmen, for example, draw human and animal forms very readily and comparatively well. Some grottoes in their places of habitation are regular picture galleries. But the Bushmen never draw plants. In the only known exception to this general rule-a depiction of a hunter hiding behind a bush-the clumsy way in which the bush is drawn shows most effectively how unusual this subject was for the primitive artist. If all this is true, we can now modify as follows the conclusion we drew from Darwin's words: it is the psychological nature of primitive man which determines that he may have esthetic tastes and concepts generally, but it is the state of his productive forces, his hunter's mode of life, which leads to his acquiring particular esthetic tastes and concepts, and not others. This conclusion, while throwing vivid light on the art of the hunting tribes, is at the same time another argument in favour of the materialist view of history. With civilized peoples the technique of production exercises a direct influence on art far more rarely. This fact, which would seem to testify against the materialist view of history, actually pro- vides brilliant confirmation of it (pp. 35-37). From cave paintings Plekhanov passes to an interpretation of the develop- ment of primitive music and musical instruments. Primitive peoples, he claims, are weak in melody and harmony but do extremely well in respect to rhythm. This is because music developed to accompany and alleviate the tedium of work. Darwin says that the ability at least to perceive, if not to enjoy, musical time and rhythm is ap- parently common to all animals and is undoubtedly connected with the physiological nature of their nervous system. In view of this, it might be presumed that the appearance of this ability, which man shares with other animals, was not connected with the conditions of his social life in general, or with the state of his productive forces in particular ....</page><page sequence="14">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 537 As is apparent from the facts I have quoted, it is because of man's ability to perceive and enjoy rhythm that the primitive producer readily conforms in the course of his work to a definite time, and accompanies his bodily movements with measured sounds of the voice or the rhythmical clang of objects suspended from his person. But what determines the time observed by the primitive producer? Why do his bodily movements in the process of production conform to a particular meas- ure, and not another? This depends on the technological character of the given production process, on the technique of the given form of production. With primitive tribes each kind of work has its own chant, whose tune is precisely adapted to the rhythm of the production movements characteristic of that kind of work. With the development of the productive forces the importance of rhythmic activity in the production process diminishes, but even with civilized peoples-the German peasants, for example-each season of the year, according to Buicher, has its own work sounds, and each kind of work its own music. (pp. 38-39). Musical instruments are next explained. Plekhanov assumes that at one time primitive man indulged his delight in rhythm by striking his instruments of labor on their objects. To obtain a variety in rhythm it became necessary "to modify the instruments of labour, which in this way became transformed into musical instruments" (p. 40).9 Plekhanov is aware of the argument that primitive and civilized man are so different that the same theory will not serve for both. He makes it plain that he will have none of this: For example, the well-known historian of art, Wilhelm Liibke, says that the art productions of primitive peoples bear the stamp of natural necessity, whereas those of the civilized nations are infused with intellectual consciousness. This differentiation rests on nothing but idealist prejudice. In reality, the art of civilized peoples is no less under the sway of necessity than primitive art. The only difference is that with civilized peoples the direct dependence of art on technology and mode of production disappears. I know, of course, that this is a very big difference. But I also know that it is determined by nothing else than the development of the social productive forces, which leads to the division of social labour among different classes. Far from refuting the materialist view of the history of art, it provides convincing evidence in its favour (p. 41). The first letter is the longest of the series, running to 44 pages and laying the theoretical foundation for the others. The second letter is less than half as long. Like the first it salutes the imaginary recipient as "Dear Sir" and is written in the first person, in an intimate, chatty style with many an appeal to the good sense and the understanding of the hypothetical "you." Though the subtitle of the second letter is "The Art of Primitive Peoples," there is really little direct reference to art in it. The opening sentences are a guide to the content of the whole. "There is always, in my opinion," asserts Plek- hanov, "a close causal connection between the art of a people and its economy. I must, therefore, when proceeding to examine the art of primitive peoples, first indicate the principal distinguishing features of a primitive economy" (p. 52). The rest of the essay is an attempt to demonstrate that economists like Karl Biicher, who regard primitive economy as individualistic rather than group-oriented and who scoff at the notion of communism in primitive econ- omy, are badly in error. The reason for Plekhanov's stern view of Buicher is not far to seek, for he explains- These questions are not only important for the history of economic development; they are of immense moment to all who investigate one or another aspect of primitive culture. It is not with- out reason, indeed, that art is called a reflection of life. If the "savage" really is such an individual- ist as Buicher says he is, then the features of his inherent individualism must inevitably be repro-</page><page sequence="15">American Anthropologist [64, 1962 538 duced in his art. Moreover, art is principally a reflection of social life; and if you look at the savage with the eyes of Bucher, you would be quite consistent if you should tell me that there can be no art where an "individual search for food" prevails, and where people practically engage in no com- mon activity (p. 55). Plekhanov then marshals a wide variety of evidence from anthropologists and travelers to prove that primitive man does share food, work, and common danger and engages in communal enterprises. "The manner in which people live," he continues, "naturally and inevitably determines their whole cast of character." If an "individual search for food" prevailed among the-savages, "they would necessarily have become complete individualists and egotists, . . . " (p. 65). Not only is this untrue of primitive man, but it is untrue even of monkeys and apes. He agrees with Darwin that our anthropomorphic pro- genitors lived in societies, and he ends the essay by asking rhetorically and sarcastically, "And if our anthropomorphic progenitors lived in societies, then it is proper to ask when, at which moment in their subsequent zoological development-and why-should their social instincts have given way to the individualism that is supposedly characteristic of primitive man?" (p. 72). In his third letter, which is 26 pages in length, Plekhanov is mainly con- cerned with the relation of art to play and work. He notes Buicher's opinion that it is now almost impossible to determine how an economy evolved out of the individual search for food. Plekhanov answers that the difficulty disappears if it is understood that "originally the search for food was not individual, but social" (p. 73). There is, to him, nothing incomprehensible in recognizing that man first worked in groups, gathering the ready-made gifts of nature, and then moved by a series of "almost imperceptible transitions" to production. Bticher cannot see this because for him a true economy begins when appropria- tion of the gifts of nature for immediate consumption is superseded by produc- tion directed toward a more distant end, and the nearer one gets to the point at which economic development presumably began, the closer, in Buicher's opinion, do man's economic activities resemble play in form and content. Plekhanov quotes Buicher as follows: It is probable that man is prompted to go beyond the mere search for food by instincts similar to those which are to be observed among the higher animals, especially the imitative instinct and the instinctive inclination for experiments of every kind. Domestication of animals, for example, be gins not with useful animals, but with such as man keeps solely for his pleasure. Everywhere, ap- parently, the development of manufacturing industry begins with ornamentation of the body, tattooing, piercing or other means of deforming various parts of the body, after which the making of ornaments, masks, drawings on bark, hieroglyphs and similar occupations develop little by little .... Hence, technical skills are acquired in the course of play, and are put to practical use only gradually. The hitherto accepted succession in the stages of development must therefore be replaced by its very opposite: play is older than work, and art is older than the production of useful things (pp. 75-76). Plekhanov is quite aware of the dangers to Marxism and to his theory of art implicit in an acceptance of Bticher's viewpoint: If play really were older than work, and art really older than the production of useful things, then the materialist explanation of history-at least in the form the author of Capital imparts to it- would not stand up to the criticism of facts, and my whole argument would have to be turned upside</page><page sequence="16">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 539 down: I would have to argue from the dependence of economic activity on art, not from the de- pendence of art on economic activity (p. 76). Plekhanov accepts the explanation of Herbert Spencer that play is the artificial exercise of energy not entirely needed in higher organisms for utili- tarian activities. This is the origin of play. What is its content? He notes that Spencer says the play of beasts of prey consists in sham hunting and sham fighting. He takes this to mean that "the content of the play of animals is determined by the activity by which they maintain their existence," and he asks triumphantly, "which, then, is anterior to the other: play to utilitarian activity, or utilitarian activity to play?" And he answers his question by say- ing, "It is obvious that utilitarian activity is anterior to play, that the former is 'older' than the latter" (p. 77). Then Plekhanov offers a number of examples to vindicate his thesis. The games of children such as the nursing of dolls and the giving of tea parties are dramatizations of adult activities. Most of these adult activities have utilitarian purposes. Hence in the case of human beings, too, "activity essential to the life of the individual and of society, is anterior to play and determines its content" (p. 78). He quotes Wilhelm Wundt's state- ment, "Play is the child of work" (p. 78), and he sets out to validate it. The dances of members of hunting societies often reproduce the movements of animals. They learn to recognize these movements during the serious business of hunting. Obviously, hunting must be anterior to the dance that draws from it. Von den Steinen saw Brazilian natives execute a dance which depicted the death of a wounded warrior. Surely war must have arisen before the creation of dances based on warlike scenes. After recounting a number of examples of this sort, Plekhanov addresses himself to the argument that, since children are often trained for adult pursuits by play, it is plain that play can precede and even act as a training ground for later occupations. But this, he says, is only true in the life of the individual. In the life of the society the work is older than the play. This type of play is encouraged during the early years of the individual only because the long-standing requirements of society are kept in mind. In order to make clear the significance of the social for primitive man and therefore for primitive art, Plekhanov challenges the notion that the destruc- tion of a person's property at his death or the burial of his possessions with his body proves that primitive man is an arrant individualist who will not share with others, even in death. His answer is that it is vastly more important and social to pass along the techniques of manufacture rather than the objects themselves, and this all primitive peoples do. To the charge that infanticide and abandonment of the aged in primitive society prove boundless egotism and lack of social conscience, Plekhanov replies that the actual number of such cases has been greatly exaggerated and in the cases that have been authenti- cated it is the harsh economic conditions that must be held responsible and not the psychology of the people. Finally, Plekhanov attacks Buicher's notion that manufacturing began with the ornamentation of the body. He points to data about peoples who are de-</page><page sequence="17">540 A merican A nthropologist [64, 1962 scribed as having very little ornamentation but who nevertheless have a con- siderable number of artifacts and industries. He expresses doubt that the tools and industries developed only after these peoples acquired their ornaments. Nor does he think that, because simple hunting peoples like the Bushmen and Australians were capable of graphic art of high quality, it can be said that they probably engaged in art before they produced useful things. "On the contrary, the character of the artistic activity of the primitive hunter testifies quite unequivocally that with him the production of useful things and economic activity generally preceded the beginnings of artistic activity and laid a very strong impress upon it. What do the drawings of the Chukchi depict? They depict scenes from the hunting mode of life. Clearly, the Chukchi engaged in hunting before they began to reproduce it in their drawings" (p. 98). And he closes his third letter with this strong statement: Similarly, if the Bushmen draw animals almost exclusively ... it is because animals play an im- mense and decisive part in their life as hunters. At first, man came to stand in a definite relation to animals (began to hunt them), and only then-and precisely because he stood in such a relation to them-did he conceive the desire to draw these animals. Which was anterior to which: work to art, or art to work? No, sir, I am firmly convinced that the history of primitive art will be totally incomprehensible if we do not grasp that work is older than art, and that, generally, man first looked upon objects and phenomena from the utilitarian standpoint, and only later did he begin to regard them from the esthetic standpoint (pp. 98-99). Plekhanov, as has been mentioned, never completed enough of the fourth letter to make its publication worthwhile, but his fifth letter is a substantial one of 35 pages. He begins it with what is essentially a justification of the content of the whole series: Why do we examine the art of primitive peoples separately from the art of civilized peoples? Be- cause with the latter technological and economic influences are greatly obscured by the division of society into classes and the resultant class antagonisms. Consequently, the more remote a tribe is from such division, the more does it provide suitable data for my investigation. Which tribes are most remote from the social system characteristic of civilized peoples, that is, from division of so- ciety into classes? Those whose productive forces are least developed. And the tribes whose produc- tive forces are least developed are the so-called hunting tribes, which subsist by fishing, hunting, and the gathering of the fruits and roots of wild plants. I shall therefore turn primarily to them, and to those which are nearest to them in cultural development. Higher tribes, the African Negroes for instance, will be called into service only to the extent that they modify or corroborate the re- sults obtained from the study of the hunting tribes (pp. 101-2). Our author first examines dances. He finds that some of them imitate the movements of animals of economic importance. Others, such as the Australian scullers' dance, are a simple representation of production processes. Where warfare is incessant, war dances are common. Where there is a sharp division of labor between the sexes, this is reflected in the dances: each sex will have its own separate dances. Because the dances are associated with war, religion, love, or something else, this does not disprove that they are the consequence of the productive forces. On this point in regard to war dances Plekhanov says: Thus the war dances of the primitive hunting peoples are artistic productions which express emotions and ideals that must have developed necessarily and naturally in the conditions of their specific mode of life. And as their mode of life was entirely determined by the state of their produc-</page><page sequence="18">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 541 tive forces, we have to admit that, in the final analysis, the state of the productive forces deter- mined the character of their war dances. This is the more evident since with them, as I have al- ready said, every warrior is at the same time a hunter, and they employ the same weapons in war as in the chase (p. 105). In his effort to clarify his position, PIekhanov gives one of the clearest statements extant of the Marxist view of the dependence of the social organ- izational and the ideological upon the technological: The love dances of primitive peoples are to our eyes the height of indecency. It goes without saying that dances of this type have no direct connection with any economic activity. Their mimicry is an unconcealed expression of an elementary physiological need and, probably, has no little in com- mon with the love mimicry of the anthropoid apes. Of course the hunting mode of life is not with- out its influence on these dances too, but it could influence them only to the extent that it deter- mined the mutual relations of the sexes in primitive society. I see you, sir, rubbing your hands in satisfaction. "Aha," you exclaim, "so even with primitive man not all his needs by far are connected with his particular modes of production and forms of economy! His love emotion shows this very clearly. But once we grant even a single exception to the general rule, then however great the importance of the economic factor may be, it cannot be regarded as exclusive, and therefore your whole materialist explanation of history falls to the ground." I hasten to explain. It has never entered the head of any supporter of the materialist explanation to assert that men's economic relations create and determine their basic physiological needs. The sexual emotion existed, of course, with our ape-like progenitors already in those remote times when they were still unfamiliar even with the slightest rudiments of productive activity. The relations between the sexes are indeed determined by this emotion. But at the various stages of man's cultural development these relations assume different forms, depending on the develop- ment of the family, which, in its turn, is determined by the development of the productive forces and the character of the social and economic relations. The same must be said of religious ideas. Nothing occurs in nature without cause. In man's psy- chology, this is reflected in a need to discover the cause of the phenomena which interest him. His stock of knowledge being extremely small, primitive man "judges from himself" and ascribes natural phenomena to the deliberate action of conscious forces. This is the origin of animism. The relation in which animism stands to the productive forces of primitive man is that its sphere grows narrower in direct proportion to the growth of man's power over nature. But this, of course, does not mean that animism owes its origin to the economic form of primitive society. No, animistic ideas owe their origin to man's nature, but their development, and the influence they exert on man's social conduct, are determined in the final analysis by economic relations .... Therefore, if primitive religion acquires importance as a factor of social development, that im- portance is entirely rooted in economics (pp. 106-8).1? The fact that the character of dance and art is decided by the level of the technology and by social need does not, according to Plekhanov, necessarily mean that individuals are conscious of this relationship or that the individual does not derive esthetic satisfaction quite apart from any utilitarian end, for "the individual may enjoy quite disinterestedly that which is very beneficial to the race (society)'} (p. 110) and "enjoyment of artistic productions is the enjoyment of that . . . which is benficial to the race, irrespective of any conscious consideration of benefit" (p. 111). Yet it should be remembered, he declares, "that, historically speaking, the consciously utilitarian attitude to objects often preceded the esthetic attitude to them" (p. 111). Primitive man first daubed his body with clay, sap, or grease to protect himself from insects and the sun's rays, and only later did anointing the body take on esthetic meaning. The warrior noted the terrifying effect it had on his enemy when his face was</page><page sequence="19">[64, 1962 542 A merican A nthropologist inadvertently smeared with blood and consequently decided to paint his face red before battle. Tattooing and cicatrization had their origin in puncturing the skin to reduce inflammation and in marking an individual to indicate, for very practical reasons, the social group to which he belonged. Feathers were first inserted in lips, ears, or septum to demonstrate ability to withstand pain, a valuable quality in a hunter and warrior. Metal rings on arms or legs make a rhythmic sound that facilitates walking. The tinkling noise must have en- couraged female labor, such as the grinding of grains on handmills. In Africa men of the Bongo tribe wear metal ornaments covering the arms from wrist to elbow. At first this must have been done for protection in battle. In all these instances "the approach to objects from the standpoint of use was anterior to the approach to them from the standpoint of esthetic pleasure" (p. 126). In regard to metallic ornaments Plekhanov sums the matter up by stating: We therefore see that if certain metallic objects were gradually transformed from useful articles into such whose appearance excited esthetic pleasure, this was due to the operation of the most diverse "factors," but that here, as in all the instances I have examined, some of the factors were themselves a result of the development of the productive forces, while others could operate in this way, and in no other, precisely because the productive forces were at the given, and not any other, stage of development (p. 129). Thus female ornaments developed and changed under the influence of several "factors," but, mark, all the latter either arose as a result of the particular state of the productive forces of primitive society (the enslavement of woman by man being one such "factor"); or, being a perma- nent feature of human nature, they operated in the particular way they did, and in no other, owing to the direct influence of the pride in the rich attire of their womenfolk; such, too, were other and similar properties of the human character (p. 126). In answer to a question raised by a lecture on "the politico-economic ideas of primitive peoples," Plekhanov turns to the subject of the value which orna- mental objects have to primitive people: If use-value is meant, then it may be said quite confidently that the objects which serve primitive peoples as ornaments were first considered useful, or were a sign that their owner possessed qualities useful to the tribe, and only later began to appear beautiful. Use-value is anterior to esthetic value. But once the given objects have acquired a definite esthetic value in the eyes of primitive man, he strives to obtain them on account of this value alone, forgetting, or never even thinking of its genesis. When exchange among different tribes begins, objects of adornment become one of the chief articles of exchange, and then the ability of a thing to serve as an ornament is sometimes (but not always) the only psychological motive that induces the buyer to acquire it. As to exchange- value, we know that it is an historical category, which develops very slowly, and of which the primitive hunting tribes-for very understandable reasons-have only the vaguest notion, and therefore the quantitative ratio in which one article was exchanged for another was originally for the most part fortuitous (pp. 129-30). In concluding this fifth letter Plekhanov gives evidence again in his sum- mary of the sweeping, central, and dynamic role that he reserves for the tech- nology in determining art or, for that matter, any other aspect or even any other trait of culture: I have said time and again that even in primitive hunting societies esthetic tastes are not always determined by technology and economics directly. Not infrequently, rather numerous and diversi- fied intermediate "factors" exert their influence. But even an indirect causal connection is still a causal connection. If A in one instance engenders C directly, and, in another, does so through</page><page sequence="20">Cultural Evolutionary Theory OPLER] 543 B which it has itself engendered previously, can it be said that C does not owe its origin to A? If a given custom, say, sprang from a superstition, or from vanity, or from the desire to terrify enemies, this does not provide the ultimate explanation of the origin of the custom. We still have to ask whether the superstition from which it sprang was not characteristic of the given mode of life-the hunting mode, for example-and whether the way in which man satisfied his vanity or terrified his enemies was not determined by the productive forces of society and its economy. We have only to ask this question, and the irrefutable logic of facts compels us to answer it in the affirmative (p. 133). The sixth letter is the shortest of all, being only 12 pages in length. It ends abruptly, unfinished, in the middle of a sentence. Shortly before it breaks off there is an allusion to "one of our next letters." Thus we know that the work, as planned by the author, was to be considerably longer than the version we have. In what he was able to write of the sixth letter, Plekhanov makes two main assertions. The first is that the manner in which objects are decorated often shows that "the approach to the object from the standpoint of use was anterior to the approach to it from the standpoint of esthetic pleasure" (p. 134). Thus, combs of Central Brazil and New Guinea consist simply of sticks tied together. "In a further stage of its evolution," as it is found among the Borotse Kaffirs, for instance, the comb is made of an entire piece of board in which teeth have been cut. Such combs are often ornamented with intersecting rows of parallel lines "obviously intended" to represent the thongs which originally bound together the sticks of the "first stage in the development of the comb." The decoration on stone axes, clay pots, and metal objects are accounted for by similar reasoning (pp. 134-36).nl The second point which Plekhanov seeks to make is that hunting peoples are in general superior in the graphic arts to the settled agriculturists and herders. Once more the explanation is found in the mode of life. The hunter needs a deft hand and keen powers of observation. These same assets, less essential to the tiller or herdsman, lend themselves superlatively to painting and sculpting. What more is needed to explain the art of the Eskimo, the Bushman, the Yukagir, or the Chukchi! (pp. 139-46). It is not too difficult to find flaws in Plekhanov's logic and examples. After all, he was a burning political partisan and not a judicious scholar. And he worked from material available 62 years ago. From my own field experience and data I can refute his claim that hunting peoples never use plant motifs in their art. It is strange that our materialist should assert this, for most hunting peoples are also gatherers of wild plants, and we shall want to know why these "useful" edibles are not also represented in their art. I have wit- nessed play of American Indian children in which the practices of adults are imitated. But I have also watched these same children play "formal" games which have nothing to do with the activities of adults or the productive processes of the culture so far as I can detect. It must hearten all good Calvin- ists to learn that play is ultimately serious training and that there is no frivolity in fun, but the utility of the stave game or the hidden ball game is still shrouded in mystery. It may be that red was a logical color to put on the</page><page sequence="21">544 A merican A nthropologist [64, 1962 face at a time of war; but why then were white and yellow streaks added by some Indians I studied? And in reference to color symbolism we might also ask what aspect of the economy dictates to the Southern Athapaskans that blue represent the male principle and white the female principle. The Navaho practice a rather sharp division of labor, but any male who has tried to escape from a Navaho woman who has "tagged" him as a dancing partner without paying her handsomely will testify that the "separate labor-separate dancing" law enunciated by Plekhanov has somehow misfired in this case. The carving of the Eskimo hunters is excellent, but a good word can be said, too, for the carving of the Polynesians and Melanesians who practice cultivation. On the other hand, there is not too much to be said for the art of many hunting groups such as the Ute, Comanche, and Apache. If Plekhanov thought that aborigines had no conception of exchange value, perhaps it was because he never saw buckskins being shrewdly bartered for meat. I am sure that Plekhanov would have said that the mimic shooting of deer-in a ritual dance of Apache hunters is a clear case of the influence of the hunting mode of life on the art. But what would he have said about the appearance in the same dance of impersonators of the abstract supernatural powers which exist during light and darkness? In none of his letters did he tell us what instruments of labor, beaten on what objects, were transformed into what musical instruments; and I doubt that he could do so satisfactorily. The corn-grinding songs of the Pueblo Indians seem like convincing evidence of the use of music as an aid to work. But what "work" prompted the racy love songs that accompany certain social dances of the Apache? One could go on in this vein at great length. But my interest is less in discrediting or correcting Plekhanov's particulars than in coming to grips with the basic principles he accepted and helped to perpetuate. For, whatever we think of the examples he assembled and his selectivity and bias in present- ing his material, the postulates which Plekhanov advanced are quite clear and can be summed up in this fashion: 1) There is an evolution of culture as such and of particular cultures which is progressive and total (involves all aspects of the culture simul- taneously). 2) It is the evolution of technology (the development of the productive forces; the expansion of the control over nature) which provides the motive force for the evolution. 3) The evolution of art, or of any other aspect of culture for that matter, is determined by the evolution and state of the technology. Conse- quently, art is in the first instance utilitarian and is explicable in materialistic, rather than idealistic, terms. 4) Animism and religion are rooted in fear and ignorance, and they lose ground as the evolutionary advance proceeds and man's knowledge of and control over nature grow. There is religious art, of course; but, as religion wanes, art will reflect other interests.</page><page sequence="22">OPLER] Cultural Evolutionary Theory 545 5) The evolution operates in terms of social groups and societal needs. The feelings and rationalizations of the individual, esthetic or other- wise, are irrelevant to it. Plekhanov, it will be remembered, explained that the primitive peoples about whom he wrote in his "letters" had not, for the most part, evolved to the point of class distinctions and class antagonisms. Consequently, he had very little need for revolutionary slogans and even invoked the dialectic sparingly. Shorn of its revolutionary fervor, his formulation obviously over- laps a good deal with the evolutionary scientism of Ostwald. It is these two related and converging streams of thought, Marxism and evolutionary scientism, children of their time, doctrines fully developed by the turn of the century, and not something that someone wrote in 1943 or 1949, that account for the view quoted at the beginning of this paper. The fact that an individual became aware of these concepts in 1943 through a particular scholar does not change the larger historical picture a whit, if I may apply to this case the culturological, nonpsychological type of analysis of which Plekhanov was so fond. Before 1899 Plekhanov was well acquainted with the products of American anthropology. In 1962 American anthropolo- gists might with profit make an effort to appraise the degree to which the postulates of Plekhanov and his school influence their thinking and their re- search. NOTES l Edwin E. Slosson, in his essay on Ostwald, summarizes "energetics" in these words: "To catch what we can of this stream of energy and to utilize it to best advantage, is the aim of human endeavor, the measure of civilization .... Wealth in all ages consists essentially of the command of energy, whether counted by slave power, horsepower, or kilowatt hours" (1914:201). 2 Ostwald is here referring to the second law of thermodynamics. 3 In several of his books and articles Leslie White refers to a number of the works of Ostwald, credits him with an early use of the term "culturology," and names him as one of the persons who has "contributed to the development of the energy theory of cultural development" (White 1959:39). White quotes a passage from Ostwald's article "Efficiency," which reads as follows: "... Progress of technical science is characterized by the fact: first, that more and more energy is utilized for human purposes, and secondly, that the transformation of the raw energies into useful forms of energy is attended by ever-increasing efficiency." White's comment is: "Ostwald is here speaking of technical science. But if cultural development as a whole rests upon and is determined by technological advance, what he says here would apply to the evolution of culture in its entirety." Apparently when he wrote, White was unaware that in papers such as "Monism as the Goal of Civilization" Ostwald does apply his yardstick of amount of energy and efficiency of technology not only to technical science but "to the evolution of culture in its entirety." Thus Ostwald seems to have anticipated White's general conception by at least three decades. (See White 1949b:363, 411; 1951; 1954; and 1959:53, 55, 56 fn.) According to his own account, White came upon the work of Ostwald in 1949 while his compilation of essays, The Science of Culture was in press. 4 Ostwald found relaxation in painting and sketching. 6 Actually Ostwald uses the term "sociology" for these fields but defines it very broadly to include "juridical existence" and "ethics." 6 See also White (1949b:55-117) for an article on "The Expansion of the Scope of Science" which invites comparison with Ostwald's views.</page><page sequence="23">546 American Anthropologist [ 64, 1962 7 See Opler, 1961, for a discussion of the use of the energy principle by Marx and Marxists and for evidence of the degree to which Marxist leaders like Lenin viewed scientists like Mach and Ostwald as competitors and threats. In an essay contributed to Sellars, Leslie White (1949a) quotes Radin to the effect that Boas ignored Marx and Engels, mentions Goldenweiser's article dealing with his rejection of Marxism (Goldenweiser 1935), and states that Herskovits on pages 458-59 of his Economic Life of Primitive Peoples "almost alone among anthropologists, dis- tinguishes between 'historical materialism' and 'economic determinism.' " White here mentions "Marx's classic statement of the materialist conception of history in the preface to Critique of Political Economy" and points out that Herskovits "... -again unlike most anthropologists- quotes it." Yet the only appraisal of Marx I can find in White's own writings is a footnote at page 186 of his The Science of Culture in which he says, "After, or within, the science of culture, human reality is seen to consist of a network of socio-cultural relations, with the individual a function of the system as a whole. Karl Marx saw this clearly over a hundred years ago when he wrote, in the Sixth Thesis on Feuerbach: 'The essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each separate indi- vidual. In its reality it is the ensemble of social relations.' As the science of culture grows and ex- tends its influence among students of human behavior, this view, this understanding, will become commonplace." In fact, in his contribution to the Sellars volume, White credits Lewis H. Morgan with introducing materialism into anthropology. This would have been quite a feat, for by any test of which I can think Morgan must be considered a philosophical idealist. 8 Plekhanov, 1957. Art and Social Life, the second work of the volume, continues the argu- ment of Unaddressed Letters but does not draw from anthropological materials. 9 Plekhanov seems unaware that by having his primitives transform instruments of labor into musical instruments to gratify a delight in rhythm he is suggesting a subordination of the useful and practical to the esthetic and is challenging the applicability of the materialist con- ception of history to art as directly as does any critic of materialism he assails. 10 In a footnote at this point Plekhanov, mindful that the introduction of "factors" weakens a deterministic position, explains his use of the term thus: "I want to remark that I use the term 'factor' in this case very reluctantly. Strictly speaking, there is only one factor of social develop- ment, namely, social man, who acts, thinks, feels and believes in one or another way, depending on what form his economy takes with the development of his productive forces. People who dis- pute about the historical significance of various factors often, without themselves observing it, hypostatize abstract concepts." n Note the unilinear evolutionary process that is implied in this development of the comb.
