<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Awareness of the Natural World in S hin j in Shinran's Concept o/Jinen Dennis Hirota Ryukoku University ATTAINMENT OF SHINJIN AND TRUTH The primary issue regarding knowledge that Shinran (1 173-1263) treats in his writ- ings concerns the commonplace, "natural" presupposition that it is constituted by an ego-subject relating itself to stable objects in the world. From his stance within Bud- dhist tradition, Shinran identifies the crucial problem as the human tendency toward the reification of both sides of this dichotomy - resulting in an autonomous self and substantial things - with the consequent attachments fueling the afflictions ("blind passions") of habitual pain and conflict for oneself and others. The focus of Shinran's treatment of this basic Buddhist concern is the point of engagement with dharma or true reality. In this, he draws into the arena of religious faith the probing scrutiny of lingering attachments to self, even in the dedicated practitioner, that is fundamental to the critical attitude of Mahayana Buddhist tradition. My aim in taking up the issue of truth in my article "Shinran and Heidegger on Truth" in The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science 1 is to sug- gest a way of reading Shinran that both avoids a common pitfall that Shinran himself cautions against - an engagement with Pure Land teachings that adheres to the sub- ject-object dichotomy of ordinary awareness - and opens up his vision to resonances with contemporary western thought, particularly continental philosophy. This latter concern is not to claim that Shinran adumbrates contemporary thought or is affirmed by resemblances, but rather seeks to cast light on compelling aspects of his thought not often treated in traditional Shin scholastics. There are, therefore, both therapeutic and constructive sides in my attempt to engage Martin Heidegger's (1889-1976) thought from a perspective rooted in Shinran's Buddhism. The pitfall in reading Shinran indicated in my article is crystallized in the assump- tion, prevalent in Western scholarship but also widely seen in Japan, that his Shin Buddhist path centers on a simple faith in the Pure Land teachings, with such faith understood as the subjective acceptance of the truth of doctrinal propositions.

This difficulty is frequently compounded by formulations of the supposed tenets of belief that are heavily molded and colored by Protestant Christian notions of self, sin, eschatology, and atonement. It is impossible to take up such com- parative theological issues here.2 In a sense, I have sought in my article to circumvent a hasty assessment of conceptual equivalence by pointing out the possibility of an encompassing or prior dissonance. Since Shinran's concept of "attaining shinjin " (true entrusting, which is also the Buddha-mind given to the practitioner) is built on the endeavor to deconstruct the reification of this dichotomy in engagement with the Pure Land Buddhist path, the unconsciousness reinstatement of it in reading his writings can lead one to a thor- ough but easily accomplished misconstrual of his thought. My suggestion in my article is that consideration of the analogues in Heidegger's thought can help us see all this. Such comparison also appears to present a relatively untested avenue for Buddhist-Christian conversation, particularly in view of Heidegger's early indebted- ness to Luther's "theology of the cross" and the notion of the "alien work of God" as the critical stripping away of attachments to human capacities (destructio in the "Hei- delberg Disputation"), and also his approach to Paul's letters to the Thessalonians in The Phenomenology of Religious Life .3 The keystone in such interreligious conversation remains, however, not simply human fallibility as subject or culpability as agent, but the persistent challenge to the subject-object dichotomy, which may form a locus of refractory difference between the religious traditions. The constructive side of the comparison concerns two general dimensions of Shin- ran's thought that are highlighted in an approach to his writings that might be called phenomenological. One includes a shift from a reading based on scriptural founda- tionalism and doctrinal reasoning to a dialogical reading, one attentive to Shinran's effort to articulate the living experience of the nembutsu practitioner and her ordinary apperception of self and world.4 This is a reading of Shinran's writings as emerging from his own awareness of his heart as "always and already residing" or "dwelling" in the Pure Land,5 of standing in "winds of perfect virtue,"6 his "heart and mind rooted in the Buddha-ground of the universal Vow," his "thoughts and feelings flow- ing within the dharma-ocean."7 Further, it sees those writings as efforts to call the reader from the usual "calculative thinking" (J. hakarai) of daily life, just as Hõnen (1133-1212) called to Shinran, "Just come wherever I may be!" (J. ShUjushõ ).8 Such a reading is of potential aid in considering responses to the practical social and global issues that confront us today as citizens of a threatened, conflict-ridden world. The second constructive aspect is the highly distinctive but largely overlooked complex of themes that emerge with special force in the light of comparison. Central among these is Shinran's effort to clarify the new temporalization in the awareness of the person who has attained shinjin ? Traditional Shin scholarship has had relatively little to say about the temporality of present life in the realization of shinjin , although the simultaneity of alreadiness and futurity, or ongoing existence and realized teleol- ogy of compassionate action, is a fully developed theme in Shinran's writings. Also</page><page sequence="3">AWARENESS OF THE NATURAL WORLD IN S H INJ IN 191 of importance is his concept of jinen (spontaneous working of wisdom-compassion), which gains in clarity and significance for ordinary life as its role in Shinran's concep- tion of truth is brought to light. In the present article, I will briefly revisit the primary issue of faith, knowledge, and truth, focusing this time on a passage from Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy ( From Enowning ), and then turn to a consideration of Shinran's concept jinen , which perhaps offers an opening - little recognized in traditional Shin scholarship but illu- minated in comparison with Heidegger's treatment of phusis - for regarding knowl- edge of the concrete world around us. PHILOSOPHICAL THINKING AND FAITH, WISDOM AND KNOWING In my article in The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science , I have sought to suggest, through a comparison with Heidegger's thinking in "On the Essence of Truth," a model for grasping the contours of Shinran's conceptions of truth and shinjin without adopting the subject-object dualism implied in the notion of Shin as a "simple doctrine of salvation through faith alone." As outlined in the article, the critical issues confronted by both Shinran and Heidegger concern the nature and significance of truth in human existence, given the always situated, conditioned char- acter of our understanding. Clearly we cannot assume for Shinran and his historical setting a modern Western sense of transcendent subject and transparent fact; never- theless, when he addresses as the primary obstacle to human fulfillment a "calcula- tive," "self-power" mind-set in engagement with the Buddhist path, his fundamental concern is, like Heidegger's, an ingrained attachment to a falsely absolutized self and its imagined capacities for detached perception and judgment. Heidegger's interest in the relationship of truth and faith may be noted from the original title of the lecture published in 1943 as "On the Essence of Truth." When delivered to the Faculty of Protestant Theology at Marburg in 1930, the title was "Philosophizing and Believing: The Essence of Truth."10 Since "believing" is not taken up directly as a topic in the essay, the meaning of the title is open to conjecture, but in part it appears that Heidegger was seeking to bring the mode of thinking he terms "philosophizing" ("the thinking of Being") into convergence with a conception of believing, once such believing has been freed, like the conception of truth with which it is intertwined, from common dualistic presuppositions. Here, a parallel may be seen in Shinran's effort to clarify the nature and significance of shinjin , likewise distinguishing it fundamentally from ordinary notions of faith as conviction or assent. Moreover, an exploration of believing may be found in Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy written several years later (1936-1938), in the section titled "Faith and Truth." There, in a move perhaps similar to Shinran's central critique of self-power, Heidegger rejects a notion of faith as "a self-seeking grabbing of a self-made secu- rity."11 He defines it instead as "holding-for-true that which withdraws from know- ing in the sense of an explanation intuiting," initially drawing on the commonly accepted distinction between the directness that is assumed to characterize genuine knowing versus the indirectness of belief.12 He goes on, however, to state that know-</page><page sequence="4">192 BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES ing is essentially a "knowing that knows what is own most to truth and accordingly determines it primarily in the turning [die Kehre ] from within this own most."13 In the terms developed in "On the Essence of Truth," Heidegger points here to a turn toward the untruth or concealment that lies at the heart of truth. Further, "if one takes 'knowing' in the heretofore sense of representation and possession of represen- tation, then of course essential knowing is not a 'knowing' but a 'faith.' However, this word ('faith') then has an entirely different meaning, no longer that of hold- ing-for-true, whereby truth is already known - even confusedly - but rather that of holding-oneself-in-truth. " 1 4 Here, Heidegger brings into convergence the hiddenness that is the enabling, opposite dimension of truth or knowing as unconcealment with the common notion of faith as "holding-for-true that which withdraws from knowing." He points out, however, that in this case, faith must have "an entirely different meaning." It cannot be merely a different way of arriving at a grasp of accordance between assertion and fact. Instead of the self "holding-for-true" the facts or objects it grasps within the hori- zon of ordinary discriminative thought, there is a "holding-oneself-in-truth," which is perhaps synonymous with the freedom of existence, the openness to become bound by acknowledgment of the other. Where truth as the object of knowledge is removed from notions of assertion and representation, it converges with faith that is likewise removed from presuppositions of intellectual acceptance and belief. Here, Heidegger traces a conception of faith that approaches the "thinking of Being" and also Shinran's conception of shinjin, for it allows for awareness of the processes of awareness itself, including the mystery of the concomitant withdrawal and concealment. In Pure Land Buddhist thought, there is a conception of the structure of awareness analogous to that in Heidegger, similarly rooted in a critical attitude toward substan- tialist assumptions. It is seen, for example, in a passage, quoted by Shinran, from the Chinese Pure Land master Tanluan (476-542) on wisdom-compassion as simultane- ously knowing and nondiscriminative non-knowing: "True and real wisdom is wis- dom that is true reality. Because true reality is formless, true wisdom is no-knowing. Uncreated dharma-body is the body of dharma-nature. Because dharma-nature is tranquility, dharma-body is formless. Because it is formless, it never fails to manifest every kind of form. . . . Because it is no-knowing, it never fails to know all things."15 Further: Prajna is a term for insight (e) that realizes suchness; upaya is a term for intel- ligence {chi) that thoroughly knows the accommodated and temporary. If one realizes suchness, one's mental activity becomes quiescent. If one knows the accommodated and temporary, one sees beings in full particularity; while the intelligence (chi) that sees beings fully adapts itself to them, it is no-know- ing. Insight of quiescence is also no-knowing and yet sees in full particularity. Thus, prajna (chi-e) and upaya , through their mutual dependence, are active, and through their mutual dependence are tranquil.16 The wisdom ( chi-e ) of the Mahayana bodhisattva arises where ordinary discrimina- tive thinking, typified by the subject-object dichotomy, has been stilled and brought</page><page sequence="5">AWARENESS OF THE NATURAL WORLD IN SHINJIN 193 to quiescence. Here, wisdom is "no-knowing" and nondual ("wisdom that is true reality") with its object, which is formless, ungraspable suchness or emptiness. Simul- taneously, however, it is said that in such wisdom intelligence emerges, inseparable from nondiscrimination and formlessness, and that this intelligence "sees beings in full particularity," becoming the basis of compassionate action in the world. We see here in both Heidegger and Pure Land Buddhist thought as quoted by Shinran the attempt to give an account of thinking and perception that does not found itself on a reified subject-object dichotomy. For our concerns here, what is implied in such accounts is the undercutting of commonsense notions of faith as based on dichotomous thinking. In rejecting notions of a transcendent subject, both Shinran and Heidegger focus on an event or occurrence of truth, rather than a state of consciousness or subjective experience, and on that which allows or empowers truth to emerge for the always situated being. Shinran calls the event "the one thought- moment of [attaining] shinjin (true mind given by Amida Buddha)" and Heidegger uses the term "the open region"17 or "clearing" in which unconcealment or disclosure occurs. Within the limitations of space here, I will build on my earlier article on truth by tracing one further step: a comparative consideration of the dynamic that enables the occurrence of truth in the two thinkers. THE EMERGING FROM FORMLESSNESS In his discussion of truth as "freedom" in "On the Essence of Truth," Heidegger states that, on the side of the perceiving subject, human beings expose themselves in openness and approachability. At the same time, with regard to beings or things, he expresses a more dynamic aspect: "Beings as a whole reveal themselves as (J)Ù01Ç, 'nature,' which here does not yet mean a particular sphere of beings but rather beings as such as a whole, specifically in the sense of upsurgent presenting [aufgehendes Anwesen ]."18 Heidegger employs the term phusis ((¡)Ú01Ç) for the active appearing of the things of the world, the emergence itself that may be distinguished as the ungraspable "worlding" of beings "as a whole" prior to any specific form. There is no further clari- fication of the term phusis in "On the Essence of Truth," but it is discussed through- out Introduction to Metaphysics y a lecture course given five years later in 1935. There Heidegger states "the Greek essence of truth is possible only together with the Greek essence of Being as phusis ."19 Concerning the meaning of the word phusis : "It [ phu- sis ] says what emerges from itself (for example, the emergence, the blossoming, of a rose), the unfolding that opens itself up, the coming-into-appearance in such unfold- ing, and holding itself and persisting in appearance - in short, the emerging-abiding sway. . . . Phusis is Being itself, by virtue of which beings first become and remain observable."20 There are two central points here that may be brought into comparison with Shin- ran's thought. First, Being as phusis , although enabling beings as apprehended things and objects of understanding to "become and remain observable," is in itself, as the "upsurgent presenting" of "beings as such as a whole," beyond concrete apprehension</page><page sequence="6">194 BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES or conceptual grasp. Second, although Being or phusis is not itself a being - is not to be grasped as any thing, such as reality as substratum - but rather is a dynamic "coming-into-appearance," it may nevertheless be said to "emer gt from itself " as the beings we apprehend. On the one hand, Being is ungraspable even though beings are precisely all that we perceive and comprehend; on the other hand, to borrow Heidegger's metaphor, Being "blossoms" from itself, thus enabling beings to become observable and humans to apprehend them. Both Shinran and Heidegger, in displacing the commonsense model of knowing agents grasping objects, face the question of the ultimate horizon of intelligibility and how it is traversed and entered from beyond, with an "inward" movement in the direction of conditioned human existence. Without such "emerging from itself" or "unfolding that opens itself up," human conceptuality would be no more than chimerical construct and Heidegger's thought would become a form of rootless ideal- ism. Heidegger identifies this approaching movement into the field of receptivity or "coming-into-appearance" using the term phusis, which is to be understood as a dynamic power ( Walten , "sway"). A delicate balance, however, is required to preserve this emergence from reifi- cation. As a Greek word for "beings," phusis was translated into the Latin natura , but according to Heidegger, for the early Greeks it "does not yet mean a particular sphere of beings but rather beings as such as a whole."21 In other words, it does not indicate primarily the things themselves of the natural environment perceived around us, but rather the very unfolding of an intelligible world. The focal mean- ing of phusis concerns the "event of standing forth, arising from the concealed."22 This emergence of the intelligibility of things is the arising of a horizon or "world" that, even though ungraspable itself, functions as a matrix for engaging and understanding what appears and "takes its stand" within. Shinran, quite late in life, adopted as a crucial term for reality (suchness, dharma- nature, uncreated dharma-body, nirvana, etc.) the word jinen in modern Japa- nese, shizen ), which, like the Latin translation of phusis , came to be used to indicate the world of nature. The word jinen is made up of two Chinese characters,//, meaning "oneself" or "itself," and nen , imparting an affirmative or adverbial sense, meaning "thus" or "in this way" and indicating the manner of becoming or occurring, hence, "of itself" or "spontaneously." Originally jinen indicated the modality of occurrence seen in Heidegger's example of the "blossoming of a rose," naturally, spontaneously occurring out of itself, free of human contrivance. Shinran's usage of jinen holds a number of correspondences with Heidegger's discussion of the Greek phusis , for in both cases the terms identify a dynamic of activity that functions centrally to resolve the shared problematic, outlined above, of characterizing the enabling of apprehen- sion of what is by human beings. A detailed discussion of Shinran's use of jinen is not possible here; I will merely mention several parallels that may be drawn with Heidegger's phusis , which suggests that to some extent these two concepts serve an analogical role in the structures of thought of the two thinkers. First, Shinran adopted jinen as a term synonymous with traditional terms for inconceivable reality; thus he states: "Supreme Buddha is form-</page><page sequence="7">AWARENESS OF THE NATURAL WORLD IN SHINJIN 195 less, and because of being formless is called jinen. " 23 Like Heidegger's Being, jinen is understood to lie beyond the horizon of intelligibility. Again like Heidegger's Being, however, jinen must not be taken to refer to a transcendent absolute. Rather, as with Being as phusis , the basic meaning of jinen is dynamic and inseparable from beings: "Jinen signifies 'being made to become so from the very beginning.'"24 For Shinran , jinen points in particular to the inward traversing across the horizon of human understanding and the manifesting of intelligible form. The fundamental model of this movement for Shinran is Amida Buddha: "Amida Tathagata comes forth from suchness and manifests various bodies - fulfilled, accom- modated, and transformed."25 That is , jinen expresses not only the formlessness that lies beyond human conceptuality, but also the dynamic manifesting of form as that which is formless. Thus Shinran states: "Buddha, when appearing with form, is not called supreme nirvana. In order to make it known that supreme Buddha is formless, the name 'Amida Buddha' is expressly used; so I have been taught. Amida Buddha fulfills the purpose of making us know the significance oi jinen Г 26 Just as Heidegger speaks of phusis as "what emerges from itself . . . , the unfolding that opens itself up" Shinran also points to a continuity across the horizon of intelligibility that binds formlessness and form or concealment and disclosure. It is in comparison with Heidegger here that we find a means for grasping the potentially broad significance of Shinran's У/яея. Within Shin Buddhist tradition, the meaning of jinen is largely restricted to the soteriological realm of Amida Buddha as arising from inconceivable reality and becoming known to human beings. Pursuing a Heideggerian emphasis on phusis as the dynamic of the emerging of "beings as a whole" suggests the possibility of an understanding of jinen as likewise expressing Shinran's engagement with the larger issue of human awareness within the appre- hension of reality as dynamic. Here, the things of the world are indeed, as with Hei- degger, pervaded by reality and in some sense sacralized. This vision carries an ethical force, which we will discuss below. ENTERING THE FIELD OF DISCRIMINATIVE AWARENESS A further similarity between the conceptual structure of Shinran's jinen and Hei- degger's discussion of phusis is that both terms are employed to offer an account of (1) the apprehension of what is real although (2) at the same time maintaining a dimen- sion of nonduality between object and subject. Once again, this pattern of thought arises from confronting a shared problematic in the effort to avoid reification or an absolutized dichotomy. Heidegger speaks of the historical "narrowing of phusis in the direction of the 'physical'"27 in opposition to the "psychical," but for early Greek thinkers like Parmenides, "Being and thinking, in the sense of contending against each other, are unified."28 Heidegger explains: "How are we to understand this? Let us base our answer on Being, which as phusis has become clearer to us in various respects. Being means: standing in the light, appearing, stepping into unconcealment. Where this happens, that is, where being holds sway, apprehension holds sway too and hap- pens too, as belonging to Being."29</page><page sequence="8">196 BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES In further explicating Parmenides: "Apprehension happens for the sake of Being. Being essentially unfolds as appearing, as stepping into unconcealment, only if unconcealment happens, only if a self-opening happens. . . . Apprehension belongs to phusis' the sway of phusis shares its sway with apprehension."30 If the arising of truth to finite human existence is possible, apprehension must occur as the opposite face of the emergence of beings and not as the mere imposition of a conceptual grasp by a transcendent subject. Human apprehension also is thus an aspect of the unfolding of Being, and it may be said that "apprehension belongs to phusis ," where phusis itself is a dimension of Being. Shinran makes a structurally similar assertion when he states: "Tathagata [formless reality, suchness, dharma-nature, etc.] pervades the countless worlds; it fills the hearts and minds of the ocean of all beings. Thus, plants, trees, and land all attain Buddha- hood. Since it is with this heart and mind of all sentient beings that they entrust themselves to the Vow of the dharma-body as compassionate means (i.e., Amida), this shinjin is none other than Buddha-nature."31 In other words, shinjin as the apprehen- sion of Amida Buddha, who brings beings to know that supreme Buddha is formless, itself belongs to Tathagata or Buddha-nature. Shinran states that shinjin as the Bud- dha-mind is directed to or given to beings. We will take up this sense of givenness and the response of gratitude below. When Heidegger states that "apprehension happens for the sake of Being" in the passage quoted earlier, there is a suggestion of anthropomorphism that is perhaps inescapable in seeking to express the dynamic of an underlying nonduality of subject and object in the arising of human truth. Shinran goes further in this direction in his development of the concept of jinen, asserting that its functioning in taking form is specifically directed to awakening persons to formlessness. His assessment of the depth of the ignorant self-attachment that must be broken through for apprehension of truth to take place results in a conception of jinen as the active creation of form (Amida, Vow, Name) that awakens beings to formlessness: "As the essential purport of the Vow, [Amida] vowed to bring us all to become supreme Buddha."32 In "On the Essence of Truth," Heidegger appears more optimistic that absorption in the dimension of forgetfulness of the mystery can be overcome through a shift toward "philosophical thinking": "The glimpse into the mystery out of errancy is a question- ing - in the sense of that unique question of what beings as such are as a whole."33 Nevertheless, the fundamental structural elements in Shinran have their echo in those more generally applied in Heidegger. Shinran treats the polarity of the movement across the threshold of intelligibility in terms of the twofold dharma-body, a concept he borrows from Tanluan, who states: "All Buddhas and bodhisattvas have dharma-bodies of two dimensions: dharma-body as dharma-nature and dharma-body as compassionate means. Dharma-body as com- passionate means arises from dharma-body as dharma-nature, and dharma-body as dharma-nature emerges [into human awareness] from dharma-body as compassionate means."34 Dharma-body as dharma-nature is synonymous with suchness or formless reality, and Shinran takes dharma-body as compassionate means to refer specifically to Amida</page><page sequence="9">AWARENESS OF THE NATURAL WORLD IN SHINJIN 197 Buddha, whose vow to liberate all beings and whose name provides conceptual form: " Compassionate means refers to manifesting form, revealing a name, and making itself known to sentient beings."35 As we have seen, Shinran states that "Amida Buddha fulfills the purpose of making us know the significance of jinen" The two poles that embody the dynamic of jinen and between which it moves may be identified as the dimension of formlessness and nondiscrimination, beyond word and conception, and the dimension of discriminative apprehension, thought, and language. For both Shin- ran and Heidegger, the tendency of persons is to become absorbed solely in practical concerns within the realm of the latter dimension, condemning oneself to a truncated life of clinging. Shinran calls this attitude "afflicting passions" (which are inherent in human existence) and "calculative thinking" (which falls away); in "On the Essence of Truth," Heidegger calls it errancy, oblivion, and forgetfulness of the mystery. Heidegger develops his notion of Being as phusis , "emergent self-upraising,"36 by adopting the term polemos from Heraclitus in order to treat the polarity informing the movement of entrance into the field of discriminative apprehension. In Introduction to Metaphysics , he quotes Heraclitus (translated here according to Heidegger's interpre- tation): "Confrontation {polemos ) is indeed for all (that comes to presence) the sire (who lets emerge), but (also) for all the preserver that holds sway. For it lets some appear as gods, others as human beings, some it produces (sets forth) as slaves, but others as the free."37 Heidegger explains polemos : "As Heraclitus thinks it, struggle (polemos) first and foremost allows what essentially unfolds to step apart in opposition, first allows position and status and rank to establish themselves in coming to presence. ... In confrontation, world comes to be. . . . The struggle meant here is originary struggle, for it allows those that struggle to originate as such in the first place."38 Although Heraclitus's polemos may strongly suggest conflict and strife, Heidegger's emphasis falls rather on the rendering of the differentiation inherent in apprehen- sion: "struggle in the sense of the confrontation, the setting-apart-from-each-other ( Aus-einander-setzung )."39 Here, Heidegger's concern appears to be the discriminative nature of human awareness, distinguishing subject from object and thing from thing that is also a central issue in Shinran's Buddhist thought. As Shinran states in a com- mentary, "The word 'to encounter' implies form,"40 suggesting that a person's uncal- culated "encounter" with what is real (Vow, Name, etc.) requires the compassionate activity of self-manifestation in apprehensible form. JINEN AS DHARMICNESS It may be objected that, despite the structural parallels in their thought, Shinran's conception o ï jinen is specifically soteriological, although Heidegger explicitly avoids an overtly theological orientation in seeking to illuminate human existence in the world. Thus, although jinen indicates the working of reality moving beings toward awakening, phusis , in Heidegger's thought, bespeaks the general "worlding" of the world. For this reason, although Shinran interprets the motive force moving in his concept of jinen in anthropomorphic terms such as wisdom-compassion, Heidegger employs neutral, impersonal concepts of sway and polemos.</page><page sequence="10">198 BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES Here, simply one point may be briefly noted regarding this objection. Although in Shinran the metaphor of emergence into the field of human apprehension is applied particularly to the salvific working of reality (formless supreme Buddha, suchness, dharma-nature, etc.), this does not necessarily mean that his concept of jinen is restricted to overt manifestations of Buddhist transmission such as Amida's Vow and Name, Sãkyamuni Buddha's teaching, or Honen's preaching. Jinen as becoming so "of itself, not through the practitioner's calculation"41 also characterizes the modality of the practitioner's present existence and the existence of the things of the world in which the person carries on her life. This is because, as we have seen, the world of the practitioner is one in which "Tathagata (true reality, suchness, etc.) pervades the countless worlds; it fills the hearts and minds of the ocean of all beings. Thus, plants, trees, and land all attain Buddhahood."42 Formless reality is said to fill the mind of the practitioner and all the things of the world. The practitioner comes to apprehend this reality through its realization as shinjin , and in such apprehension Shinran states: "How joyous I am, realizing as I humbly reflect that my heart and mind stand rooted in the Buddha-ground of the universal Vow, and that my thoughts and feelings flow within the dharma-ocean, which is beyond comprehension."43 The "Buddha-ground" or "dharma-ocean, which is beyond comprehension" may be said to indicate the dimension of formless reality that "pervades the countless worlds" and the locus in which both the practitioner and all things have their exis- tence. Perhaps the parallel concept in Heidegger is the "open region" in which beings "can properly take their stand and become capable of being said"44 or Being as "clear- ing." According to Shinran, jinen may be said to be a synonym for truth as "dharmic- ness" {hõsoku Ü'FJJ), meaning "the way that things have become settled to be" {"koto no sadamaritaru arisama ," sakun annotation),45 that is, as they are in themselves in the world and in human involvement, not as objects of calculative thinking empirically observed by the self. Thus: " Dharmicness expresses the natural working {jinen) in the life of the person who realizes shinjin and says the Name once."46 It may be said that a conception of the apprehension or occurrence of truth - one that does not violate the rejection of a reified dichotomy of subject and object - is developed by both Shinran and Heidegger, each in his own way. For both thinkers, it involves the emerging of meaningful form from formlessness, on the one hand, and the drawing or summoning of finite beings to what is real, together the human openness of awaiting and hearing, on the other. A treatment of this second aspect, however, must await another occasion. NOTES 1. Dennis Hirota, "Shinran and Heidegger on Truth," in Paul D.

The subtitle [i.e., 'The Essence of Truth'] states how we are to set about the task . . . , [viz.,] by question concerning the essence of truth" (43). 11.
