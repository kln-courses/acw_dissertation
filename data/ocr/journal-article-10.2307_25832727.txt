<plain_text><page sequence="1">48 French Studies EARLY MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By A. E. Cobby, University of Cambridge, and Finn E. Sinclair The following abbreviations have been used as particular to this section: Sturm-Maddox, Transtextualities, for Transtextualities of Cycles and Cyc licity in Medieval French Literature, ed. Sara Sturm-Maddox and Donald Maddox (MRTS, 149), 1996, vi + 203 pp.; and Kelly, Medieval Opus, for Douglas Kelly, The Medieval Opus: Imitation, Rewriting, and Transmis sion in the French Tradition, Amsterdam, Rodopi, xv + 427 pp. 1. General Richard Barber, The Knight and Chivalry, rev. edn, Woodbridge, Boydell, 1995, xvi + 4i5pp., is a much expanded and updated revision of the 1970 work (TWMLS, 32:210), taking new research into account. Also expanded since the previous (1990) edition is the Repertoire international des medievistes (International Directory of Medievalists), 8th edn, Turnhout, Brepols, 1995, xxiii + 670 pp., whose coverage, theoretically of medievalists working in all countries and disciplines, continues to be somewhat eclectic. Michel Zink, Medieval French Literature: An Introduction, trans. Jeff Rider (MRTS, no), 1995, xii + 171 pp., is a translation of Le Moyen Age: litteraturefrangaise, 1990 (TWMLS, 53:52), with a conclusion taken from the longer, 1992 edition; the translation offers additional notes and an expanded bibliography and chronology. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (GRLH, 932: Garland Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages, 2), ed. William W. Kibler and Grover A. Zinn, 1995, xxvi + 1047 pp., is a welcome new reference work, which devotes much space to literature in its mixture of short reference items and substantive articles, written by interna tional authorities. Rita Copeland, Rhetoric, Hermeneutics, and Translation in the Middle Ages: Academic Traditions and Vernacular Texts, CUP, 1995, xiv + 295 pp., examines the relationship between rhetoric and hermeneutics, positing this as the nexus within which the character of medieval vernacular translation is defined. Jean Flori, La Chevalerie en France au moyen age (Que sais-je?, 972), PUF, 1995, 128 pp., replaces La Chevalerie by P. du Puy de Clinchamps in the same series. F. outlines the history and nature of knighthood and chivalry, together with its social and literary manifestations, its ritual, chivalric myths, the religious role of chivalry, and its links with courtesy, courtly love and the epic. D. R. Howlett, The English Origins of Old French Literature, Dublin, Four Courts Press, x + 180 pp., maintains that the maturity of the oldest extant French literature, and the abundance of insular</page><page sequence="2">Early Medieval Literature 49 manuscripts, are to be explained by the literature's being not of continental but of insular, specifically Anglo-Latin, origin. He uses patterns of repetition as evidence that the repetitivity characteristic of Old French literature derives from its Latin origins; much weight is placed on line-, word-, syllable-, and letter-counts. Burt Kimmelman, The Poetics of Authorship in the Later Middle Ages: The Emergence of the Modern Literary Persona, NY, Lang, 288 pp., examines the development of literary autocitation from the early to the late Middle Ages and the changing relationship of individual to text. The increase in authorial involvement, from the textual inclusion of signatory anagrams through the use of the character-narrator, is seen as leading to the evolution of the modern literary persona. Sarah Spence, Texts and the Self in the Twelfth Century, CUP, xi + 167 pp., argues that the development of a notion of selfhood parallels the rise of vernacular literature. The i2th-c. 'self is defined in spatial and visual terms, relating body and vernacular text in a way which transcends the perceived temporality and self-sufficiency of Latin literature, and allows for the intrusion of partiality and difference. Jacques Stiennon, LEcriture (Typologie des sources du moyen age occidental, 72), Turnhout, Brepols, 1995, 132 pp. + 5 pis, studies medieval writing from the points of view of physiology, materials, scribal skills, and training (including the identification of hands), and in relation to medieval mentalities. There is considerable discussion of the role of the written word in medieval society, and both Latin and vernacular literature are cited in evidence for the use of and attitude to the written and the scribe. Theresa Tinkle, Medieval Venuses and Cupids: Sexuality, Hermeneutics, and English Poetry, Stanford U.P., 294 pp., examines the multiple representations and transformations of Venus and Cupid in response to varying codes of sexual morality reflected in Latin, French, and English poetry. Cupid is linked with the Ovidian tradition in French literature, a culturally specific use of mythography which is read as displaced in favour of Venus by the nationalistic and classicizing trends of Chaucerian poetry. Jean Verdon, Le Plaisir au moyen age, Perrin, 200 pp., uses literary sources liberally in investigation of sexual and other pleasures, and discusses the relationship between the literary representations and reality. Nigel Wilkins, Catalogue des manuscrits frangais de la bibliotheque Parker (Parker Library), Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 1995, 189 pp., describes 65 MSS containing medieval French in this rich collection. K. Ciggaar, 'La dame combattante: theme epique et theme courtois au temps des croisades', Actes (Groningen), 121-30, looks for fighting women in literature and history, finding them in Eastern and Western crusade sources, in romances and, later, in chansons de geste, where they remain courtly</page><page sequence="3">50 French Studies figures. M. A. Jubb, 'Enemies in the Holy War, but brothers in chivalry: the Crusaders' view of their Saracen opponents', ib., 251-59, argues that the reality of Muslim behaviour, as seen in the East in the later 12th c, and as exemplified especially by Saladin, led to a change of spirit in the portrayal of some of the enemy in chansons de geste and chronicles composed after 1180. These show a climate of mutual respect and the figure of the good Saracen; it is not essential in them to be a Christian in order to be a knight, though Christianity is a sine qua non for salvation. S. Marnette, 'Reflexions sur le discours indirect libre en francais medieval', Romania, 114:1-2, considers a range of medieval texts in order to define the characteristics of 'discours indirect libre'. Ambiguity and polyvalence are seen as key traits in its use. E. J. Mickel, 'Les germes de la culpabilite au moyen age', TLit, 8, 1995:25-41, mines a variety of early French literary texts for instances of the greatest crimes (impiety and its results, treachery and betrayal), and finds their origin in the ancient world. J.-C. Miihle thaler, 'Mourir a table: contextualisation et enjeux d'une sequence narrative au XIIe siecle (de la Chanson de Guillaume a Erec et Enide)\ Banquets, 217-33, finds that death at table has negative connotations, always being associated with loss of self-control; one so killed is either guilty (a traitor or a tyrant) or, if innocent, has to have his death justified. D. Staines, 'The medieval cycle: mapping a trope', Sturm Maddox, Transtextualities, 15-37, is a wide-ranging essay which traces the history of the term 'cycle' from the 9th c. to the present day. M. Zink, 'Trente ans avec la litterature medievale: note breve sur de longues annees', CCMe, 39:27-40, sums up trends and reflects on the development of the field over the last 30 years. 2. Epic general. C. Blons-Pierre, 'L'expression de la rapidite dans La Chanson de Roland et dans La Chanson de Guillaume: une maniere d'etablir une distinction entre Francs et Sarrasins', Actes (Groningen), 111-20, shows how the poets use the verbs saillir, curre, fair and brochier of individuals and groups and so reveal their vision of the two sides. The author of Guillaume may mock Franks as individuals but shows only Saracens fleeing en masse, the Roland poet never mocks Franks or shows them fleeing but praises them through the use of brochier. B. Finet-van der Schaaf, 'L'image de la Frise et des Frisons dans la litterature en ancien et en moyen frangais et dans quelques chroniques en moyen neerlandais', ib., 441-50, finds that in i2th-c. and I3th-c. epic texts the image of Frisians is positive, before becoming predomi nantly negative in later French texts as in Middle Dutch. M. Gosman,</page><page sequence="4">Early Medieval Literature 51 ' "Rex Franciae, Rex Francorum": la chanson de geste et la propa gande de la royaute', ib., 451-60, links language and power in Capetian history and the chanson de geste, seeing epic poets as royalists helping the kings of Paris to build the kingdom of France. He studies the way in which the Capetians used language to underpin their authority, the chanson de geste as a propaganda vehicle (by considering the language used of France, the French and Charlemagne), and finally the role of Saint-Denis both in the consolidation of Capetian power and in literature. S. Kay, 'Le probleme de l'ennemi dans les chansons de geste', ib., 261-68, discovers a change of attitude in the 12th c, as the enemy changes from being the outsider to being perceived also within one's own society. She focuses on the opposition between external and internal, showing how the early chanson de geste projects evil outwards while later texts, in reaction against the romance and courtly culture, increasingly find it within, rejecting individuality and the interior life and the traitors who manifest these. A. V. Murray, 'Coroscane: homeland of the Saracens in the chansons de geste and the historiography of the Crusades', ib., 177-84, studies the origins and connotations of this place name, showing how Latin historiography and eschatological traditions combine to influence the vernacular epic. F. Suard, cLes heros chretiens face au monde sarrasin', ib., 187-208, examines the links between the two religious worlds as ensembles, taking examples from a wide range of epic texts and finding that none is altogether lacking in Saracen presence. S. describes the Saracen world, which is huge, monstrous, marvellous, splendid, characterized by violence, medicine and beautiful women, and the complex, paradoxical attitude of Christian heroes to it. Though it is a hostile, demoniac world it needs to be worthy of the Christians, and it informs not only the narrative but also the poetics of the texts. T. Venckeleer, 'Les valeurs chevaleresques et leur expression dans l'epopee', ib., 517-22, looks at the epithets expressing conformity of characters or actions to the approved code of chivalry or to valued characteristics, asking whether (and implicitly showing that) this vocabulary develops semantically as the fixation of formulaic collocations leads to fusions and transfers of sense. P. Verelst, 'L'art de Tolede ou le huitieme des arts liberaux: une approche du merveilleux epique', ib., 3-41, uses a wide range of chansons de geste to find examples of the (non-Christian) marvellous and magic, in people and in many different objects. D. Collomp, 'Le motif du pape combattant dans l'epopee', Colloque (Aix-en-Provence), 91-112, shows that the figure of the pope is rare in. early chansons de geste, and that where present he is a function, representing church values and authority, rather than an individual. In later medieval texts fighting clerics are more common, and with them the fighting pope,</page><page sequence="5">52 French Studies reflecting reality. S. Kay, 'The life of the dead body: death and the sacred in the chansons de geste', TFS, 86, 1994:94-108, uses Freud and Girard's work on the primitive sacred to identify the primitive beliefs showing through epic deaths. She illustrates the spiritual (but not uniquely Christian) qualities of deaths in several chansons de geste, then interprets and illuminates these deaths with the aid of Freud and Girard, ending with a close reading of the death of Bernier in Raoul de Cambrai. J.-P. Martin, 'Histoire ou mythes: Pexemple de la chanson de geste', Litterales, 19:5-20, starts from the discrepancy between history and chanson de geste. In a brief history of chanson de geste criticism he reviews the stances and problems of the traditionalist and individualist positions, showing that what is important is not how history is deformed but how it is reformed. He discusses the role of invention, adaptation, ideology, folklore, and myth, concluding that we can no longer study the chanson de geste without considering its links with Indo-European myths and their Carolingian manifestations. F. Suard, 'L'eau dans les chansons de geste', Colloque (Orleans), 132-47, analyses examples of four roles of water: drinking, a perilous frontier, an incentive to daring which enables the demonstration of power, and baptism. roland and gharlemagne. Song of Roland, trans, with an introd. by Janet Shirley, Felinfach, Llanerch, xvi + [162] pp., has a brief introduction for the general reader and a translation into blank verse, with some paraphrase, based upon all the modern editions. R. Middleton and K. Pratt, 'A fragment of an unknown "Roland" epic', Pratt, Roland and Charlemagne, 205-13, is a photographic reproduction and edition of a fragment of 120 lines or part-lines of a text of c. 1200, in decasyllabic, monorhymed laisses, mentioning Roland and Oliver along with other names known from other texts but hitherto found together in no one text. H. Legros, 'Entre Chretiens et Sarrasins, des amities paradoxales: liberte de l'imaginaire ou reve d'un monde reconcilie', Actes (Groningen), 269-78, examines the nature of the friendship between Naime and Balan in Aspremont and that between Ogier and Karaeus in La Chevalerie d'Ogier de Danemarche. The first shows up the strength and uniqueness of the bond between Naime and Charles, the second shows the values of the individual triumphing over society. The contrast reflects the changing mentality between the Third Crusade and the period after the sack of Constantinople. M.-L. Oilier, 'Le discours collectif dans le Roland', ib., 491-99, shows how group speech expresses what the group has in common and is linked to a certain political vision of society and of the relations between individuals and society. Collective discourse by the pagans in Roland (and in the romance), is contrasted with that of the Franks. Y. Otaka, 'La langue du Voyage de Charlemagne a Jerusalem et a</page><page sequence="6">Early Medieval Literature 53 Constantinople: assonances', ib., 279-89, exhaustively lists the asson ances, with remarks on phonetics, graphy, Anglo-Norman and southern characteristics, and anomalies, finding I2th-c. and i3th-c. traits together with one from the 14th century. M. C. Vos, 'Saragossa once more: the fortress on a height', ib., 225-32, draws out the Biblical symbolism and overtones of Saragossa's being placed on a mountain by the Roland poet. J. B. Williamson, 'The figure of the griffin in the Chanson dAspremonf, ib., 83-89, links the griffin to Saracens and to a morally reprehensible attitude to wealth, con trasting this with Charlemagne's Christian largesse. S. L. Burch, 'Bramimunde: her name, her nature', Pratt, Roland and Charlemagne, 67-81, discusses the problematical etymology of this name. She concludes that 'munde', with its Germanic ring and use (as '-monde') for other heroines, may have overtones of 'noble (foreign) lady'; 'bram' she relates to brame, embramir 'impassion, inflame', with Bramimunde's ardent desire being in the form of anger and grief at women's impotence and men's incompetence, 'passionate desire for effective action'. J. Simpson, 'The gifts of the Roland: the Old French Gui de Bourgogne\ ib., 31-65, applies the theory of the gift to Gui de Bourgogne, concentrating on monetary terminology and on father-son tension, and arguing that economic and genealogical metaphors reflect inter- and intratextual relationships, the later text paying a 'poisonous tribute' to the Roland. W. G. van Emden, in a pair of articles, 'The reception of Roland in some Old French epics', ib., 1-30, and 'La reception du personnage de Roland dans quelques oeuvres plus ou moins epiques des i2e, i3e et i4e siecles', Actes (Groningen), 353-62, studies the presentation of Roland in many texts, paying particular attention to the question of his demesure, which van E. finds to be significant for contemporaries as for modern critics. While the reception in some texts is entirely positive, others show him as guilty of overweening pride, add a religious dimension perceived to be lacking in the Chanson de Roland, or criticize him indirectly through another hero. M. de Combarieu du Gres, 'Ysore "for" et "clerc" dans Aiquin (fin XIIe-debut XIIP siecle)', Colloque (Aix-en Provence), 605-18, draws out the character of Ysore as a fighting cleric and a representative and guarantor of local liberty. Y. Foehr Janssens, 'La mort en fleurs: violence et poesie dans Ami et Amile\ CCMe, 39:263-74, shows how the flowered meadow where heroes meet is also a battlefield, so that the floral decor helps the expression of all aspects of interpersonal relationships, while also linking the epic and romance sides of this inter-generic text. J. H. Grisward, Ami et Amileet les trois peches du guerrier', Litterales, 19:21-32, links Lubias's three lying accusations with the Dumezilian concept of the warrior's three sins, sacrilege, cowardice, and lust or venality. He</page><page sequence="7">54 French Studies suggests that this expression of the trifunctional system was integrated into the pre-existing story of Ami et Amile because it offered a ready series of sins, fitted the repetitive nature of the chanson de geste and usefully structured the tale, which is notable for threesomes and may have been delivered in three sessions. J. Kjaer, 'La reception scandinave de la litterature courtoise et l'exemple de la Chanson de Roland / Af Runzivals bardaga: une epopee feodale transformee en roman courtois?', Romania, 114:50-69, compares Roland with its more courtly Old Norse translation, and finds that the changes are in matters very close to the heart of French feudal society but antipath etic to Hakon Hakonarson, the translator's patron; while the style remains epic the ideology undergoes a thorough renewal and becomes courtly. A. Roncaglia, 'Geografia storica di leggende e fiabe: da Roland a Auberon\ CJV, 56:45-99, studies the problematical place names in the Roland, then considers similarly problematical names in the Roman dAuberon and finds them surprisingly realistic. C. Segre, 'Comment presenter la Chanson de Roland a l'universite', RLiR, 60:5-23, compares in detail the editions and translations of Short (TWMLS, 52:49) and Jean Dufournet, *La Chanson de Roland (Collec tion bilingue), Flammarion, 1993, 450 pp. S. reflects on the principles which should inform student editions, finds both of these lacking in justification and explanation for editorial decisions, and fears they may mislead students by hiding problems. guillaume d'orange and the garin cygle. Le Cycle de Guillaume d'Orange: anthologie, ed. Dominique Boutet (Lettres gothiques, 23), Livre de Poche, 672 pp., publishes excerpts from standard editions of ten texts in the cycle and of the Chanson de Guillaume, with facing translations, notes, introduction and bibliography. E. A. Heinemann, 'Existe-t-il une chanson de geste aussi brillante que le Charroi de NvmesT, Actes (Groningen), 461-69, continues H.'s work on complex internal and external repetition, showing how they produce in this text a range of effects founded on echo and rhythm, and how subtle detail produces comic and other results. J.-P. Martin, 'De la Chanson de Guillaume a Aliscans: l'emploi des motifs rhetoriques', ib., 471-79, considers examples of amplification in Aliscans and finds not simple inflation but real aesthetic value. He concludes that Aliscans is the work of a master not only of traditional methods but of late i2th-c. innovations, in whose hands repetition is not gratuitous, stereotypes not sterile. A. Moisan, 'L'abbe Henri et ses moines dans le Moniage Guillaume et le Moniage Rainouart, ou la perfidie dans l'etat monastique', Collogue (Aix-en-Provence), 435-47, analyses the entry of Guillaume and of Rainouart into monastic life, and the monastery's reactions. He finds satire, not of monastic life as such but of possible abuses, expressed through a picture of a fossilized community of silly, greedy,</page><page sequence="8">Early Medieval Literature 55 treacherous, cowardly monks with no understanding of their new brethren. Id., 'De la cuisine a la chevalerie et a la vie monastique, ou les trois "fonctions" chez le Rainouart epique', Banquets, 337'-52, approaches the character of Rainouart as laborator turned first bellator and then orator, who sums up in himself the social ascent through the three estates (these being the medieval manifestation of the primitive division of functions in the Dumezilian sense). M. de Combarieu du Gres, 'Bonnes et mauvaises manieres de table dans La Chanson de Guillaume et Aliscans\ ib., 281-301, considers banquets, meals, and food in general in these poems and shows how they manifest mesure or demesure,folie or sens, with abundant examples and detail. L. H. Frey, "'Monday in the evening": refrain and formulism in La Chanson de Guillaume', FSB, 60:1-4, looks at the content of the hisses with a refrain in the light of the limitations imposed a century earlier in northern France by the Treuga Dei. L. Schosler, 'New methods in textual criticism: the case of the Charroi de Nimes\ pp. 225-76 of Medieval Dialectology, ed. Jacek Fisiak (Trends in Linguistics Studies and Monographs, 79), Berlin-NY, Mouton de Gruyter, 1995, xviii + 331 pp., is a dialect-based discussion of the text's stemma, which gives a result similar to the traditional one but obtained in a new way. S. groups the MSS in three independent families and dates the A family later than hitherto. She localizes the MSS and the archetypes according to Dees's method, concluding that the original was from eastern France. An edition of the F fragment is included. S.'s methods are discussed at length, and unfavourably, in a posthumous article by D. McMillan, 'Le Charroi de Mimes: stemmatis ation et delocalisation des manuscrits', CN, 56:411?33, who calls S.'s contribution 'science-fiction'. A. Soutou, 'Le vrai embleme de saint Guillem: le cor noir, et non le court nez ou le nez courbe', RLaR, 100.1:131-34, follows A. Colby-Hall's interpretation of William's emblem, using evidence from Occitan and heraldry. the epic of revolt. Raoul de Cambrai: chanson de geste du XIIe siecle, introd. and trans. William Kibler (Lettres gothiques, 20), Livre de Poche, 540 pp., uses Kay's 1992 text (TWMLS, 54:54) and adds facing translation and editorial matter. W. Calin, 'Evolution de la chanson de geste: merveilleux et melodrame dans Renaut de Montau ban\ Actes (Groningen), 43-48, reads Renaut de Montauban as an intertext whose most powerful scenes are melodramatic, seeing it as a new kind of chanson de geste which marginalizes the previous model. F. Denis, 'Le heros et son double: Bernier face aux Sarrasins dans Raoul de Cambrai, ib., 233-39, shows how Bernier's behaviour reflects the more complex approach to Saracens which appears in the late i2th-c. epic, when negative stereotypes are tempered by good qualities. The same oscillation is found in clerical texts, and the</page><page sequence="9">56 French Studies literary tensions probably reflect the contemporary climate, contact having generated inconsistent attitudes. B. Duijvestijn, 'Maugis aux Pays-Bas', ib., 49-56, studies the relationship between Maugis dAigre mont and its two Dutch versions. P. Noble, 'Maugis and the role of magic', ib., 71-75, describes the role of Maugis and the importance of magic in Renaut de Montauban. Maugis (and the poet) recognize the conflict between magic and Christianity, but the threat is neutralized by Maugis's rejection of his past life. M. de Combarieu du Gres and A. Labbe, 'Figures de clercs dans Girart de Roussillort, Colloque (Aix-en Provence), 113-32, survey and classify clerics in this text, finding it to be unusually positive in its attitude, as it uses the topoi of epic clerics but sets itself in opposition to them, stressing their role as peace makers rather than fighters. A. Labbe, 'Un repas ridicule dans Renaut de Montauban: Maugis servi par Charlemagne', Banquets, 319-35, finds that disturbed meals indicate grave institutional dysfunction. This particular meal, though comic, also demythifies, for it undermines Charlemagne's authority. L. tentatively outlines a possible Dumezil ian approach, in which this episode attacks Charlemagne's sustaining function after the thefts of his crown and his arms have attacked his warrior and sacral functions. M. Tyssens, 'Espaciun (Gormont etlsembart, v. 269)', CN, 55, 1995*137-47, surveys the interpretations of this hapax offered by editors and lexicographers, and concludes that it is an error for esparnison (Anglo-Norman esparnisun). crusade cycle. R. F. Cook, 'Les epopees de la croisade', Actes (Groningen), 93-110, offers an overview of crusade epics and of the problems they pose, especially the questions of cyclical development and the relations between chanson de geste, history and ideologies. He identifies the link between crusade epics as ideological: they are propaganda works, inspiring respect for crusading ancestors, while their relationship with history is complex. G. H. M. Classens, 'Some notes on the proto-Saladin', ib., 131-40, uses comparison with the Middle Dutch Roman van Saladin, Roman van Cassant and especially Dystorie van Saladine to discover features of the proto-Saladin, the lost source of all the known Saladin-texts. H. Diament, 'Place names and personal names in medieval French and Provencal crusade epics', ib., 151-58, focuses on the Chanson dAntioche and the Chanson de la croisade albigeoise, studying a selection of names in each and calling for further work. P. R. Grillo, 'The Saladin material in the Continuations of the First Crusade Cycle', ib., 159-64, examines the presentation of the figure of Saladin in the 'short' and 'long' Continuations, and the influence of the Chronicle of Ernoul and the Estoires d'Outremer. F. Suard, 'La decouverte du monde paien dans les chansons de geste de la croisade', Procs (Oporto), 107-18, shows that in spite of similarities with chronicle material, the crusade epic is seeking to do</page><page sequence="10">Early Medieval Literature 57 something different, as revealed by its method of conveying the novelty of the East less by topographical details than by the role of the marvellous. In addition to fantastic elements derived from romance, there is a new form of Christian marvellous, in which eastern saints help the crusaders. other epics. K. A. Campbell has two essays on Hervis de Metz. A note on crusade and bourgeois in Hervis de Mes\ Actes (Groningen), 217-23, argues that the text reflects the growing social conflict of its era and the need of the nobility for the wealth of the bourgeois, while going further than this context inasmuch as crusade validates the mesalliance of the duke's daughter. C. sees the crusades as a focus for the expression of a certain ideal social order, in which the merchant is as necessary as the knight and the moral rhetoric of crusade justifies social mobility. 'The reiterated self: cyclical temporality and ritual renewal in Hervis de Metz\ Sturm-Maddox, Transtextualities, 157-77, examines cyclicity in the Geste des Lorrains as a whole and Hervis de Metz in particular. Cyclic temporality links the individual narratives to form one 'mega-narrative', in which the repetition of heroic deeds affirms collective identity. J.-C. Herbin, 'Les enfances "romanesques" de Hervis de Metz', PRIS-MA, 12: 27-37, shows how the first half of the poem fits Gautier's definition of enfances as the time which precedes the elevation to knightly status, but in an original way on account of Hervis's non-aristocratic background; only when he is dubbed do he and the poem become epic. D. Ion compares Garin le Lorrain and Gerbert de Metz in two articles. In 'Banquet, conflit et fidelite dans Garin le Lorrain et Gerbert de Metz\ Banquets, 303?18, she views banquets as a focus for social relations, and shows how they act as a meeting-point and play on the relations established between lineages. In 'Remarques sur les relations de parente dans Garin le Lorrain et Gerbert de Metz\ Litterales, 19:133-51, she considers two variations on the theme of kinship. Different forms of lineage appear in the two poems: in Garin the Lorrain clan, limited at the beginning, grows in strength and wealth while the Bordelais are left in shadow; in Gerbert, the few Lorrains keep their position while the numerous Bordelais move towards extinction as a group. I. sees the contrast as manifesting the poets' skill but also the rise in importance of the individual. P. Le Rider, 'Le rire dans AioF, PRIS-MA, 12:57-74, draws out the comedy of several episodes and features in the early, decasyllabic part of Aiol. The poet uses verbal comedy widely, with Aiol being mocked in the text but not by the audience. S. C. Obergfell, 'The role of manuscript illumination in the chanson de geste AM, Romania, 114:316-34, offers a codicological review and finds evidence of a planned programme of illumination. She proposes several functions: to fix the subject of the poem in the memory, to</page><page sequence="11">58 French Studies mark major divisions and to act as the visual equivalent of rhetorical topoi and narrative amplification. 3. Romance general. E. Baumgartner, 'Sur quelques "marines" medievales', Colloque (Orleans), 11-22, considers the seashore as a rhetorical space, often with a symbolic dimension. F. Dubost, 'Merveilleux et fant astique au Moyen Age: positions et prepositions', RLaR, 100:1-35, links the entry of the 'merveilleux' into literature with the birth of romance. The layering of Christian and pre-Christian myth is seen to create a double dynamic generating a duality and ambiguity where 'senefiance' is superimposed on 'semblance'. C. S. Jaeger, 'Patrons and the beginnings of courtly romance', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 45-58, questions the influence of patronage on the 'origins of romance'. A. Planche, 'Enfance et ressemblance: regards sur quelques textes medievaux', PRIS-MA, 12:95-103, examines three types of 'twinship': twins separated at birth and reunited; resemblance between children of different sexes raised together; physical doubles. The double is read as acting as intermediary between the self and the external world, being simultaneously same and other. Wolfzettel, Arthurian Romance, provides an introductory overview of the impor tance of Gender Studies to the study of Arthurian romance. The notion of sex/gender as a social construct and semiotic sign is related to the collective unconscious or 'imaginaire', manifested in artistic and literary production. A systematic study across the genre uses a variety of methods to examine the ideological problems linked with gender and the status of women, and their relation to the evolution of Arthurianism. The volume contains several articles relevant to OF studies: A. Putter, Arthurian literature and the rhetoric of "effeminacy" ' (34-49), traces the changes in the cultural perception of male heroism in the 12th c; R. Deist, 'Sun and moon: constellations of character in Gottfried's Tristan and Chretien's Yvairi (50-65), examines the triangular relationship between the lady, her compan ion, and the lover, relating this to the myth of sun and moon as principles determining character; A. Rieger, 'Balade des demoiselles du temps jadis. Essai sur l'entree en scene des personnages feminins dans les romans de Chretien de Troyes' (79-103), analyses the meetings of the male protagonists with other characters. The lack of individuality ascribed to women marks them as narrative elements, rather than as fully-fledged characters; C. Blons-Pierre, 'Discours feminin et discours masculin dans les romans de Chretien de Troyes' (104-18), distinguishes between two types of discourse: the rigid social code which marks gender and social rank, and the code of</page><page sequence="12">Early Medieval Literature 59 courtly literature which projects a fictional and idealised image of the romance protagonists; D. Kullmann, 'Hommes amoureux et femmes raisonnables, Erec et Enide et la doctrine ecclesiastique du mariage' (119-29), considers the relation of Chretien's attitude towards love within marriage to contemporary ecclesiastical doctrine; J. Nightin gale, 'Erec in the mirror: the feminization of the self and the reinvention of the chivalric hero in Chretien's first romance' (130-46), draws a parallel between Erec et Enide and the Song of Songs, linking Enide to the image of the Bride. The 'femme-image' constructed by the poet acts as idealized mirror and instrument of self-revelation, allowing the hero to be remodelled according to the 'exemplum' presented by his feminine 'alter ego'; P. Ihring, 'Die uberlistete Laudine. Korrektur eines antihofischen Weiblichkeitskonzepts in Chretien's Yvairi (147-59), views Laudine as possessing a double identity, her romance persona overlying an original connection with the mythical 'fairy of the fountain'; A. Saly, 'Masculin-Feminin dans le Conte du GraaF (160-64), measures the balance of male/female relations in the text against the Perceval/Gauvain relationship, concluding there exists a symmetrical correspondence between the two; J.-G. Gouttebroze, 'Un phenomene d'intertextualite biblique dans le Conte du Graal: "Qu'il soient une char andui"' (165-75), suggests that the problem of incest is symbolically present in the first section of the narrative. Only a reciprocal silence regarding the identity of future marriage partners neutralizes its potential to develop openly in the second section; and L. de Looze, 'Feminine "contre diction" of the masculine in Le Chevalier a Vepee" (183-95), uses neo-Freudian, particularly Lacanian, theory to explore the narrative paradoxes which are expressed in terms of gender and genre. The heroic nature of Gauvain is questioned by this romance, while the author contradicts its generic 'givens' through a fabliau-type conclusion. Chretien de troyes. M. T. Bruckner, 'Rewriting Chretien's Conte du Graal ? mothers and sons: questions, contradictions, and connections', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 213-44, posits the mother as the site of contradictions and oppositions in the 'mother text' of Perceval and in the Continuations. Brigitte Cazelles, The Unholy Grail: A Social Reading of Chretien de Troyes's cConte du Graal', California, Stanford U.P., 325 pp., attests to the political factionalism and strife inherent in the Conte. The division between Grail lineage and Arthurian society is represented by the characters of Perceval and Gauvain, their parallel quest for power indicating the lack of coherency and stability of the chivalric world and the failure of traditional chivalry. C. argues convincingly for a reading which grounds the romance in its 12th-c. socio-historical context. La Copie de Guiot: fol. ygv-iojr du manuscritffr.</page><page sequence="13">6o French Studies 794 de la Bibliotheque Nationale eli chevaliers au lyeon3 de Crestien de Troyes, ed. Kajsa Meyer, Amsterdam, Rodopi, 1995, 345 pp., is the first published facsimile of the Guiot MS, containing what is probably the clearest version of Chretien's text. Particular interest lies in the relatively simple form of orthography which appears to correspond closely to the phonetic reality of the period. The edition contains a transcription of the text, together with notes on variants, a full description of the MS and its transcription, classification of MSS and notes on previous editions. J. Flori, 'La notion de chevalerie dans les romans de Chretien de Troves', Romania, 114:289-315, views Chretien's romances as reflections and instigators of a chivalric ideal in which the 'chevalier' is primarily a warrior, a conception which links more closely with the 12th-c. epic than with the 13th-c. romance. The vocabulary pertaining to chivalry provides a particular focus of study. J.-G. Gouttebroze, 'A quoi sert le repas du Graal? Remarques sur la liturgie du Graal dans Le Conte du GraaP, Banquets, 467-78, gives an anthropological reading of the Conte which links the motif of feasting to both Celtic and Oedipal myth. J. Helm, 'Deus si beles ymages, une molt bele conjointure', AUMLA, 84:85-110, is a numerological and mythological reading of Free et Enide. Emphasis lies on the harmonious nature of the medieval universe, where truth transcends through allegory, and on the disparity between modern and medieval frames of reference. Sandra Hindman, Sealed in Parchment: Rereadings of Knighthood in the Illuminated Manuscripts of Chretien de Troyes, Chicago U.P., xiv + 225 pp., divides the depiction of the knight into five categories: 'Clerc', 'Bachelor', 'Seignor', 'Combat eur', and 'Roi'. Each aspect provides comment on the sociopolitical background of Northern France in the 13th c, and the political crisis of the aristocracy under a newly-centralised monarchy. The study also focuses on the manuscripts as evidence of the uneasy transition from oral to written culture. E. Kennedy, 'Who is to be believed? Conflicting presentations of events in the Lancelot-Grail cycle', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 169-80, sets Perceval against Galahad as Grailwinner, a substitution which marks the conflicting nature of the voice of authority across the pre-cyclical and cyclical narrative tradition. N. J. Lacy, 'Motif transfer in Arthurian romance', ib., 157-68, suggests motif transfer is significant to the study of reader reception theory, as well as to an intertextual analysis of the Arthurian corpus conceived as a whole. D. Maddox, 'Cyclicity, transtextual coherence, and the romances of Chretien de Troyes', Sturm-Maddox, Transtextualities, 39-52, discerns two criteria, genealogy and customs, whose elements recur throughout the corpus of Chretien's romances, giving them a 'protocyclic coherence'. This becomes significant in relation to the cyclifying tendencies of later Arthurian romance. B. Marache, 'Arthur</page><page sequence="14">Early Medieval Literature 61 entre coutume et aventure', PRIS-MA, 11:165-73, views the depic tion of Arthur in Erec et Enide as the beginning of his metamorphosis from historical personage (as in Monmouth and Wace) to ambiguous symbol. Later romances continue this progression, opposing the feudal ideal of kingship to an exploration of the individual conscience. Per Nykrog, Chretien de Troyes: romancier discutable, Geneva, Droz, 230 pp., provides a critical discussion of commentaries on, and interpretations of, Chretien's romances, from the Middle Ages to the present, advocating a return to critical study based on the texts themselves. L. Oliver, 'Spilled wine and lost sovereignty in Chretien's PercevaF, NMi, 97:91-102, presents an examination of the 'spilled wine episode' in Perceval and in the Welsh Peredur. Specific differences regarding the recipient of the insult appear between the two versions when the incident is related back to Celtic sources. A. Saly, 'Les Enfances Perceval', PRIS-MA, 12:221-35, considers the topos of vengeance in relation to Chretien's Perceval and the variants Parzival, Perlesvaus, Peredur, and Percyvell. Since vengeance does not form a primary source of intrigue in Perceval or Parzival, but is present in the other three variants, S. concludes that the theme is not derived from Chretien. Claudia Seebass-Linggi, Lecture d'Erec: traces epiques et trouhadouresques dans le conte de Chretien de Troyes, Bern, Lang, 295 pp., analyses intergeneric influences to claim that Erech 'contamination' by epic and Provencal 'cansos' in its depiction of chivalry and love marks the birth of a new literary form, that of courtly romance. J.-J. Vincensini, 'Echange de mets, echange de mots, echange de corps dans Le Conte du GraaP, Banquets, 493?509, examines the geometric balance between the four episodes in which Perceval shares a meal. Excess is opposed to frugality, speech to silence, men to women, in an attempt to illustrate Perceval's alienation from society in three different spheres: sexual relations, language, and gastronomy. other Arthurian. *Three Arthurian Romances: Poems from Medieval France ? 'Caradoc'; 'The Knight with the Sword'; 'The Perilous Graveyard', trans. Ross G. Arthur, with introd. and notes, NY-London, Dent, xviii + 216 pp. *ArLit, 14, ed. James P. Carley and Felicity Riddy, Woodbridge, Brewer, 160 pp. R. Baudry, 'La Vertu nourriciere du GraaP, Banquets, 433-50, considers the image of the Grail as a source of nourishment across a wide range of Arthurian texts, concluding with a brief glance at its modern image. Although the form and context of the nourishing Grail is seen to be in constant flux, the durability of this primary attribute is read as evidence of the fundamental laws of human imagination. A. Berthelot, 'Le Graal nourricier', ib., 451-66, suggests that the ambiguity of Chretien's Grail is replaced in the Continuations by a dual focus on the Grail as magical artefact and as Christian symbol. F. Brandsma, 'The</page><page sequence="15">62 French Studies presentation of direct discourse in Arthurian romance: changing modes of performance and reception?', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 245-60, demonstrates the alteration in the presentation of direct discourse from verse to prose, as one aspect of medieval stylistics. M.-L. Chenerie, 'Vengeance et chevalerie dans le Tristan en Prose", Romania, 113, 1992-95 [1996]: 194-226, links the theme of vengeance to pagan prehistory and to the 'chanson de geste'. Its presence in the romance destabilises the notion of the courtly ideal. R. Colliot, Arthur, roi de la chevalerie terrienne dans le Roman de Laurin\ PRIS MA, 11:211-20, points to the simplification and impoverishment inherent in Arthur's depiction, despite his noble attributes. Two pieces by M. de Combarieu [du Gres]: 'Enfantines (etude sur les enfances de Lionel et Bohort dans le Lancelot en prose)', ib., 12:133-55, which relates the depiction of the two cousins to that of Lancelot, with emphasis on their dominant 'humour' and tempera ment; and 'Les queteurs de merveilles: etude sur la Queste del Saint GraatRLaR, 100:63-90, associating 'semblance' and 'senefiance' in the Queste with 'merveilles' and their meaning. The capacity to discover the 'merveilleux' is ultimately linked to the quester's capacity to appreciate and to interpret, a concept which is carried over into the area of reader response theory. A. Combes, 'L'atre perilleux. Cenotaphe d'un heros retrouve', Romania, 113, 1992?95 [1996]: 140-74, focuses on the text's haunting by death on the levels of content, metaphor, and allegory. G. D'Amours, 'Merlin et le Tao', DFS, 35:3-18, posits the notion that the spiritual themes of Merlin literature form fundamental 'mythemes' which connect with Taoism. Parallels are drawn between the Grail and the Tao, and between the mythical oriental beast the Ky-Lin and the unicorn, while Merlin is presented as an atemporal figure allowing Western access to Oriental spiritualism. J. R. Doner, 'Scribal whim and miniature allocation in the illustrated manuscripts of the Continuation-Gauvain', MAe, 65:72-95, discerns an evolution in the historiated initials and miniatures of this collection of MSS. Although there appear to be no direct links between them, they do apparently share common trends and ascribe to discernible patterns of illustration. L. Gowans, 'The Grail in the West: prose, verse and geography in the Joseph of Robert de Boron', NFS, 35:1-17, studies the relationship between the one extant verse MS, Paris BN fr.20047, and the 15 prose versions of Joseph, concluding that Robert composed in prose and that the narratorial voice of the verse version is therefore supplied by the redactor. *Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post Vulgate in Translation, vol. 5, ed. Norris J. Lacy, NY, Garland, xi + 438 pp. M. Mikhailova, 'Le Clerc: personnage de la fiction/ personnage-fiction. Le clerc ecrivant dans la litterature arthurienne',</page><page sequence="16">Early Medieval Literature 63 Colloque (Aix-en-Provence), 417-34, studies the polyvalent nature of the role of the clerc/hermit in the Queste del Saint Graal. His tripartite function, as narrator, reader and character, posits him as mimetic double of the author, an ambiguous producer of rhetoric and signification. L. Morin, 'De la souverainete dans le Roman d'Yder: la deloyaute d'Arthur et l'excellence d'Yder', PRIS-MA, 11:185-98, examines the opposition between Yder and Arthur as ideal and anti type of sovereignty. K. Pratt, 'The Cistercians and the Queste del Saint Graal\ RMS, 21:69-96, suggests that the cumulative effect of themes and motifs in the Queste does indicate that the author had a particular connection with, or interest in, the Cistercian order. Moral and religious didacticism is, however, ultimately seen to cede to a secular focus, as the romance exalts an elite group of fighting men, rather than a religious order or calling. Ad Putter, * 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight3 and the French Arthurian Romance, OUP, 1995, 292 pp. A. Saly, 'Le Roi Arthur dans le Perlesvaus: le mauvais roi et la chauve au bras bande', PRIS-MA, 11:199-209, examines the symbolic and mythical value of the mutilated maiden as allegory of the king's deficiencies. The Formation of Culture in Medieval Britain: Celtic, Latin, and Norman Influences on English Music, Literature, History, and Art, ed. Franchise H. M. Le Saux, Lampeter, Mellen, 1995, xiv + 197 pp., provides an overview of intercultural influences. Of particular interest to OF studies is N. Thomas, 'The politics of romance: some observations on the political content of the Roman d'Yder' (171-81). This considers the anti-Arthurian stance of the romance, concluding that Yder is concerned with the 'renovatio' of the courtly ideal from within, rather than with an unmitigated assault on the chivalric ethos. P. Simons, 'The "Bel Sanblant": reading Le Bel Inconnu", FS, 50:257-74, examines the use of 'sanbler' and 'sanblant' as ambiguous signs in a textual frame of reference which is itself marked as unstable. The generic codes of romance and lay are deconstructed and subverted by an author who consistently blurs the boundaries between fiction and 'reality', highlighting the unreliability of meaning generated through text. Richard Trachsler, Clotures du cycle arthurien: etude et textes, Geneva, Droz, 570 pp., studies the closure of the Arthurian cycles and the solutions offered by a range of texts and MSS, focusing in particular on the death of Arthur. The romance tradition is related to the chronicle: while the latter traces a historical continuum, the romance envisages no possibility of a narrative extending beyond the death of Arthur. The Arthurian cycle thus exists in a self-perpetuating spatial and temporal vortex. The principal aim of the study is to provide an intertextual analysis of the themes which serve to link and to differentiate between the corpus of selected texts. M. Seguy, 'L'ordre du discours dans le desordre du monde. La recherche de la</page><page sequence="17">64 French Studies transparence dans la Quatrieme Continuation', Romania, 113, 1992-95 [1996]: 175-93, considers Perceval as the means of reducing the ambiguity of linguistic signs in a world depicted as torn between the forces of good and evil. R. S. Sturges, 'Desire, allegory, and the structure of the Prose Lancelot', DFS, 34:3-15, concentrates in particular on the structure of the Queste. Allegorical interpretation of the Grail is divided into four categories: historical; allegorical; topological; anagogical, which apply to the different experiences of each of the questing knights, according with their differing spiritual states. La Suite du Roman de Merlin, ed. Gilles Roussineau, 2 vols, Geneva, Droz, cxlv + 326, 327-804 pp., is a continuation of the prose Merlin attributed to Robert de Boron. This is the first full edition to take account of Cambridge University Library, Additional 7071 (MS B), unknown to previous editors. The relation of MS B to the other MS versions of the text is examined in the Introduction, which also provides a critical and linguistic analysis. J.-R. Valette, 'La merveille et son interpretation: l'exemple du Lancelot propre', RLaR, 100:163-208, is a semiotic reading of the 'merveille' and the 'merveilleux'. The reader's capacity to comprehend and interpret literary allegory is dependent on knowledge of its particular system of signs. I. Weill, 'Le clerc et 'Thermite preudome" dans le Lancelot GraaP, Colloque (Aix-en-Provence), 579-89, divides the religious world into a tripartite structure in which each type of cleric/holy man fulfils a different function. This Christian ethos overlies the idealized Celtic world of the text and points the way to a greater 'senefiance'. F. Wolfzettel, 'Les "Enfances" de Lancelot du Lac. Pour une approche generique du theme', PRIS-MA, 12:105-16, draws an opposition between the model of the 'enfances' narrative in epic and in romance. In the romance the hero's search for self and identity replaces the father with the Lacanian 'nom-du-pere', typifying the rejection of lineage and prolonging the 'espace d'enfance'. M. Zink, 'Traduire saint Bernard: quand la parabole devient roman', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 29-42, focuses on the influence of Cistercian spirituality on Arthurian romance, particularly the Quite du Graal. Rather than the narrative being impoverished through the addition of allegory, the contrary occurs, with religious spirituality becoming absorbed by romance literature. tristan and iseut. G. J. Brault, ' "Entre ces quatre ot estrange amor". Thomas' analysis of the tangled relationships of Mark, Isolt, Tristan and Isolt of the White Hands', Romania, 114: 70-95, examines Thomas's discourse on the universal nature of anguish in love with reference to the 'La Salle aux Images' episode, contained only in the Turin manuscript. J. Chocheyras, 'Le personnage d'Arthur dans le Tristan de BerouP, PRIS-MA, 11:159-63, considers the chronological</page><page sequence="18">Early Medieval Literature 65 relationship of Tristan and Chretien's Cliges, proposing that the former's depiction of Arthur as powerful sovereign and 'romance hero' provides a counterpoint to the criticism of the king in Cliges. C.R. Dover, 'From non-cyclic to cyclic Lancelot: recycling the heart', Sturm-Maddox, Transtextualities, 53-70, traces the narrative strategies by which an earlier 'non-cyclic' version is incorporated into the Lancelot. The theme of the heart provides a key element in this adaptation. Y. Foehr-Janssens, 'Lit d'amour, dit de mort. Thomas d'Angleterre et l'esthetique romanesque', MA, 102:403-17, considers the introspective nature of discourse in Tristan, the distinction drawn between 'voleir' and 'desir', and death as the last resort of love (beyond the pleasure principal). A. Gross and J. Thibault-Schaefer, 'Semiotique de la tonsure de l'"insipiens" a Tristan et aux fous de Dieu', Colloque (Aix-en-Provence), 243-75, remark on the semiotic complexity inherent in the interpretation of the tonsure: sign of madness, sign of a cleric. The image of the tonsured Tristan which appears in several MS illuminations signals his marginalization and assimilates lay madness to sacred or expiatory madness. Christiane Marchello-Nizia, *Tristan et Tseut: les premieres versions europeennes, Gallimard, 1995, lx + 1728pp. Roger Pensom, Reading BerouVs Tristan: A Poetic Narrative and the Anthropology of its Reception, Bern, Lang, 116 pp., studies two problematic areas: the text's aesthetic unity, and the set of relations which link text and society. A stylistic and semantic analysis examines the text in terms of its paradoxes and discontinuit ies, relating these to the influence of two distinct schemes of social ordering, Germanic and Celtic. This 'liminality' and confusion of a world in transition is balanced against the text's poetic form, which gives aesthetic order and coherence. P. V. Rockwell, ' "Je ne suiz mie soffisanz": insufficiency and cyclicity in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle', Sturm-Maddox, Transtextualities, 71-91, assesses the cyclical connec tion among the texts of this cycle, concentrating on the continuous deferral of a notion of heroic sufficiency which propels the narrative onward from text to text without its gaining closure. Le Roman de Tristan en prose, vol. 8, ed. P. Menard, B. Guidot, and J. Subrenat (TLF, 462), 1995, 405 pp., is the penultimate volume in this edition of the Vulgate. As previously, the text is preceded by an analysis of the MSS, together with a critical appreciation of the text. A section on 'literary problems' considers the implications of the romance's focus on Galahad at this point and the introduction of a predominant religious ethos. This is influential on both literary and ideological levels of analysis, juxtaposing the themes of secular and holy knighthood to produce a thematically 'complete' narrative and emphasising the function of Galahad as metaphor of the chivalric ideal. J. R. Scheidegger, 'Flux et reflux de la maree et du desir dans 3</page><page sequence="19">66 French Studies Tristan etlseuf, Colloque (Orleans), 111-31, links the image of the tide with desire. The fluctuation and instability of both is further linked with the ambiguity of a discourse which confounds its signifiers; 'la mer', Tamer' (aimer), and Tamer' (amer); 'l'amur' and 'la mort'. B. Schlyter, 'Le Roman de Tristan en prose: une edition longtemps attendue', NMi, 97:113-20, describes the content of each of the seven published volumes, relating this to their style, particularly the increasing use of 'entrelacement'. lais. P. F. Ainsworth, '"The letter killeth": law and spirit in Marie de France's lay of La Fresne\ FS, 50:1-14, delineates and explores the spiritual allegory underlying the lay, and the implicit contrast between law and grace. The twin 'merveille' is here aesthetic and spiritual; Marie weaves her tale through a skilful and provocative rewriting of Biblical themes, provoking questions on the nature of grace and man's place in the divine scheme. Margaret M. Boland, Architectural Structure in the 'Lais' of Marie de France, NY, Lang, 1995, x + 226 pp., analyses the order and structure of the lais as they appear in Harley MS 978, concluding that they form a coherent and balanced unity. Analogy is drawn with the structure of the medieval cathedral, balance and harmony being glossed as allegorical reference to the Christian universe. J. Brumlik, 'The lyric "malmariee": Marie's subtext in Guigemaf, RoQ 43:67-80, points to Guigemar\ synthesis of the fey mistress and the lyric malmariee, evoking an image which problematizes literary models of women. Marie de France, *Lais, ed. A. Ewert, Bristol Classic Press, 1995, lxxii + 223 pp. B. A. Masters, 'Involution of meaning in the Harley CheuerefoiP, Parergon, 13:81-115, views the polyphonic form of the text (as in Harley MS 978) as a visual inscription of its content. This symbiotic relationship mirrors that of the lais two lovers, and signals the necessary complicity of narrator and reader in a process which produces meaning through the manipulation of known formulae. J.-L. Picherit, 'Le chatiment des amants dans le lai d'Equitan de Marie de France', MA, 102:419-24, considers the punishment of the 'amants' in the light of 12th-c. law, linking adultery and treason, and playing on the semantic duality of the Latin 'adulter': adultery and counterfeiting. B. Semple, 'The male psyche and the female sacred body in Marie de France and Christine de Pisan', YFS, 86:164-86, examines the status of the male/female body in regard to sanctity and desire. The traditional denial of female accession to the 'logos' (Christian teaching) is overturned in the work of Marie and Christine, creating the paradox of a body at once sexual and sacred. M. Stanesco, 'Du demon du midi a l'Eros melancolique: topologie du feerique dans le lai narratif breton', Poetique, 106:131 -59, links the hour of midday with both fairy encounters and death/passage to the 'Otherworld'.

Romans d5 antiquite. E. Baumgartner, 'Benoit de Sainte-Maure et "Puevre de Troie"', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 15-28, discusses the complex relation between Benoit and his sources, the subsequent work appearing a mosaic drawn from diverse models. C. Croizy Naquet, 'La description de Troie et ses avatars dans le Roman de Troie en prose du XIIIe siecle5, CCMe, 39:305-20, contrasts the description of the city in Benoit's verse romance and in its later prose adaptation. From an accumulation of verbal elements emphasizing the supernat ural, unquantifiable, and inaccessible nature of Troie, its prose image is reduced to one which is historical, accessible, and spatially specific. L. Harf-Lancner, 'De la biographie au roman d5 Alexandre: Alexan dre de Paris et Part de la conjointure5, Kelly, Medieval Opus, 59-74, examines the diverse intertextual themes, motifs and 'senefiances' which reveal Alexandre as an 'author-architect5 of romance. other romances. Alexandre du Pont, Le Roman de Mahomet, ed. and trans. Yvan G. Lepage, Leuven, Peeters, ix + 173 pp., replaces the 1977 edition, providing a modern French translation of the OF text in place of the Latin version of the poem, as previously. The introductory analysis does, however, make much comparison between the Latin and OF poems. A. Eskenazi, ' "Variantes gra phiques" dans Guillaume de Dole', RLiR, 60:147-83, is a philological study of the Lecoy edition of the text. E. Gauchier, 'Enfances diaboliques: Robert le Diable', PRIS-MA, 12:17-26, relates Robert to the motif of 'enfances5 as it appears in I3th-c. prose cycles. The nature/nurture debate which these present is here overshadowed by the concept of 'anti-nature5, while the linear progression towards identity is replaced by a cyclical return to a state of infancy and madness.

Penny Eley, London, King's College, liii + 228 pp., provides a full literary analysis, comparing the interrelation of MSS P and W, and con sidering intertextual influences on the romance. A new translation into English is added. J.-L. Leclanche, 'Le clerc et la clergie a travers les Dolopathos de Jean de Haute-Seille et d5Herbert', Colloque (Aix-en Provence), 363-84, considers the emphasis on Christian sanctity which appears in both the Latin and French versions of the Dolopathos.

Speer, '"Translatio" as "inventio": Gaston Paris and the "Treasure of Rhampsinitus" (Gaza) in the Dolopathos romance', Sturm-Maddox, Transtextualities, 125-55, dem onstrates how autonomous brief narratives can be assimilated to a larger narrative coherence through an examination of the transtextual 'mouvance' of three sections of the Seven Sages cycle. N. Thomas, 'The Old French Durmart le Galois: a demystified version of the Perceval story?', Parergon, 13:117-28, notes how Durmart opposes the Grail tradition of the 'chevalier-messianique' through its relocation of the quest to a recognizable and unequivocal moral universe, that of the Crusades. R. Trachsler, 'Parler d'amour. Les strategies de seduction dans Joufroi de Poitiers', Romania, 113, 1992-95 [1996]: 118-39, traces the way in which the text exploits the possibilities offered by the Occitan tradition, focusing attention on the declaration and expression of love. 4. Religious Writings Two editions treat the work of Pierre d'Abernon of Fetcham: La Lumere as Lais, vol. 1, ed. Glynn Hesketh, London, ANTS, 212 pp., is the first of three volumes presenting what is probably the earliest of P.'s three works, using as base Oxford, Bodleian Library, Bodl. 399 (MS B). Vol. 11 will conclude the text and give variant readings; vol. hi will provide the Introduction, Glossary, and Notes. Id., La Vie seint Richard, ed. D. W. Russell, London, ANTS, 1995, xiii + 175 pp., is the Anglo-Norman translation of an earlier Latin 'vita' by Ralph of Bocking. This is the first edition of the complete text, including both 'le premier livre' (the 'Vie') and 'le secund livre' (the Miracles section). The Medieval Translator, vol. v, ed. Roger Ellis and Rene Tixier, Turnhout, Brepols, xvi -f- 488 pp., is the latest volume in an ongoing series which covers a wide variety of texts, genres and languages.

The Legend of Mary of Egypt in Medieval Insular Hagiography, ed. Erich Poppe and Bianca Ross, Dublin, Four Courts Press, vii + 299 pp., traces the reception of a single 9th-c. Latin source in insular vernaculars during the Early and Late Middle Ages; of particular relevance is J. Weiss, 'The metaphor of madness in the Anglo-Norman Lives of St. Mary the Egyptian' (161-73), which compares the three versions of the text as 'exempla'. Robert le Chapelain, 'Corset3: A Rhymed Commentary on the Seven Sacraments, ed. K. V. Sinclair, London, ANTS, 1995, x + 150 pp., is the earliest known account of the Seven Sacraments in Anglo-Norman, providing previously undocumented evidence of early I3th-c. religious practices. 5. Other Genres lyric. M. Gerard, 'Quand la lepre fleurit... Corps et ecriture dans les Conges de Jean Bodel et Baude Fastoul', Litterature, 102:14-28, reflects on the language used of leprosy by the two poets. drama. Le Jeu dAdam, ed. and trans. Wolfgang van Emden (British Rencesvals Publications, 1), Edinburgh, Societe Rencesvals British Branch, xviii + 83 pp., opens a new series of student texts. The edition is conservative, the English translation is free, being designed for acting, the introduction, bibliography, notes, and glossary are aimed at students. A. Cowell, 'Feminine semiotics and masculine desires: Courtois dArras and the proper male reader in the Middle Ages', Symposium, 50:16-27, examines the links between usury, prostitution, and transgressive poetics in contemporary philo sophy and in the jeu. M. Infurna, 'Esotismo e teatro medievale: Jean Bodel', MedRom, 20:45-55, relates the Jeu de saint Nicolas to contem porary tales of and attitudes to the Orient, focusing particularly on the arbre sec. He finds a blend of contemporary Arras, anti-Muslim propaganda and eastern exoticism. historical. E. Baumgartner, 'Brut et les ancetres d'Arthur', PRIS-MA, 11:139-48, considers the retrospective importance attached to the figure of Arthur in the modern reading of Wace's Brut, a perspective influenced by his significance in the medieval romance. P. E. Bennett, 'L'epique dans 1'historiographie anglo-normande: Gaimar, Wace, Jordan Fantosme', Actes (Groningen), 321-30, exam ines the vernacular influence evident in early chronicles. The study thus forges a link between chronicle and epic in addition to the clear influence exerted on the chronicle by Latin poetry (both medieval and ancient). P. Eley, 'Epic elements in the Chronique des Dues de Normandie\ ib., 345-51, points to the greater use of formulaic language in Benoit's Chronique than in his earlier Roman de Troie. This shift</page><page sequence="23">70 French Studies towards epic mode serves to signal the historical aim of the work, written for the English king, as well as to imbue the somewhat obscure source material with a borrowed glory. The political context obviates a more emphatic linkage between epic and chronicle, avoiding uncomfortable parallels being drawn between English royal ancestors and French heroes. E. Freeman, 'Geffrai Gaimar, vernacular histori ography, and the assertion of authority', SP, 93:188-206, analyses the methods used by the Estoire des Engleis to assert and facilitate its own acceptance as an authoritative version of the past. J.-G. Gouttebroze, 'Entre les historiographes d'expression latine et les jongleurs, le clerc lisant', Colloque (Aix-en-Provence), 215-30, seeks to define the term 'clerc lisant' with reference to Gaimar's Estoire des Engleis, Wace, and the chanson degeste. The 'clerc' functions as mediator at the politically powerful juncture between the written Latin corpus and its vernacular interpretation/adaptation. V. B. Jordan, 'The multiple narratives of Matthew Paris' Estoire de seint Aedward le rei: Cambridge University Library MS Ee.iii.59', Parergon, 13:77-92, studies the tripartite structure of the MS which presents three separate, but interconnected pictorial or narrative versions of the 'estoire'. L. Lofstedt, 6Li quatre livre des reis et la traduction en ancien francais du decret de Gratien', NMi, 97: 315-28, examines the differing aim and audience of the French translations of each of the above texts, considering the interrelation of the two translators. A Partial Edition of Les Fais des Rommains\ with a Study of its Style and Syntax, ed. Thomas J. McCormick, Jr, Lampeter, Mellen, 1995, 252 pp., studies the stylistic and syntactical changes which took place between the I3th-c. OF version of the text and the i5th-c. MS copy (British Museum Old Royal 20 C 1). It is the i5th-c. version which is edited here, with accompanying notes of changes from the original. Gabrielle M.

Evdokimova, 'Dispositions des lettrines dans les manuscrits du Bestiaire d'amour et sa composition: des lectures possibles de l'oeuvre (i6re partie)', MA, 102 ."465-78, considers the arrangement of the illuminated initials in the different MS versions as marking different forms of textual interpretation. M.-R.Jung, 'Ovide, texte, translateur et gloses dans les manuscrits de YOvide moralise', Kelly, Medieval Opus, 75-98, remarks on the importance attached to the French author/translator of the Metamorphoses. This, together with his multi-faceted role, is revealed by textual glosses, illuminations and rubrics. C.

Simpson, Animal Body, Literary Corpus: The Old French 'Roman de Renart'(FauxTitre, 11 o), Amsterdam-Adanta, Rodopi, [v] + 242 pp., argues that the narrative of the Renart and its thematic concerns can be viewed as both historically determined and as a self-generating literary system, and that it offers an important insight into the changing relations between power and writing in the emerging Capetian state. S. uses different branches to explore ideas of imitation and tradition, of literacy and performance, the treatment of lineage, the representation of change and transition, conversion and epiphany, royal ambitions and their failure, commemoration and forgetting. He concludes that the branches of the Renart are 'in part shaped by a reaction to a project to control' on the part of 12th-c. Capetian Paris. R. Bellon, 'Levi-Strauss en Renardie: manieres de table, cru et cuit dans Le Roman de Renart', Banquets, 393-405, views eating habits and table manners as a social marker, but above all as a point of comparison in the play of anthropomorphism and zoomorph ism in the Renart, they express the shifting identities and metamorph oses in the text. M. Bonafin, 'Le nom du loup et le trickster-renard: la discussion sur les stratifications ethniques dans le Roman de Renart, Reinardus, 9:3-13, approaches animal names and animal nature from a folklore point of view, arguing that they represent the remains of totemic beliefs and seeking traces of such extra-textual ethnic connections in the text. N. Harano, 'Le texte y de la Branche IV du Roman de Renart, ib., 51-58, asks whether the y family represents a third version or an amplification of a and P, without coming to a definitive decision. C. de Saulnier, 'Le clerc auteur et personnage dans Renart le Contrefait, Colloque (Aix-en-Provence), 515-28, finds that the author (an ex-priest) is confused with the clerical characters in the text, who not only represent stereotypes of wealth and sensuality but also reflect the author's personal situation of being denounced and unfrocked for bigamy. The character of Renart completes his anthropomorphism by becoming a clerk, and the author takes his revenge by identifying with him and perverting the traditional faults of the clerical character.

Medieval Comic Tales, ed. Derek Brewer, 2nd edn, Woodbridge, Brewer, xxxiv + 190 pp., is a revised and expanded edition, with a completely new introduction, of the 1973 collection (TWMLS, 35:217). It includes ten French fabliaux, and the non French sections contain some useful analogues. The introduction discusses humour in general and medieval humour in particular, relating the medieval comic tale to other traditional literary forms and to parallels in folklore, before presenting the various corpora featured in the anthology, with particular attention being paid to fabliaux (including recent scholarship) and trickster tales. Two new volumes of the Nouveau recueil complet des fabliaux (JVRCF), ed. Willem Noomen, Assen, van Gorcum, vol. vm, 1994, xxvi + 438 pp., vol. ix, xxvi -f 366 pp., add a further 31 fabliaux to this definitive new edition, leaving only one more volume to come. Like their predecessors they contain a general introduction, inventory of MSS, index of proper names and glossary, and give for each text diplomatic editions of all MSS, a critical edition, an introduction and notes. Each contains a list of errata in previous volumes. L. C. Brook, 'The moral of La Housse partie\ RF, 107, 1995:396-401, shows how the text can be read both from a worldly and from an anagogical viewpoint, and must be so read if its meaning is to be discerned. The moral, which at first seems superficial in relation to the tale, covers a dual deeper significance, a description of the world as cynical and self-seeking, and a parallel with the life of Christ. The hero is like the Christian man who acknowledges the richness of God's gift and responds with the gift of himself. K. Busby, 'The respectable fabliau: Jean Bodel, Rutebeuf, and Jean de Conde', Reinardus, 9:17-31, approaches these three accomplished writers from the point of view of non-parodic intertextuality, and shows by study of the stylistic, rhetorical and structural features which their work shares with the rest of OF literature that it belongs to a far from marginal genre, and that it is less scandalous and more respectable than tends to be thought. B. J. Levy, '"Tant va la cruche a l'eau...": parodies et perils hydriques dans les fabliaux francais', Colloque (Orleans), 41-60, mines a wide variety of fabliaux for occurrences of water as a source of laughter or disaster, finding it in the form of river, spring, and bath, and drawing out its parodic exploitation, its dangers and its relation to obscenity. M.-T. Lorcin, 'Le statut de l'objet dans les fabliaux francais',</page><page sequence="26">Early Medieval Literature 73 Reinardus, 9:75-85, counts and classifies objects (other than food, places or animals), and shows that they are not a mere background but contribute to the tales: they may show class or wealth, they contribute to theatricality by making the action more visual, they may play a central narrative role. She concludes that they deserve further study, and draws attention to the value placed by the characters upon such objects. J.-B. Renard, ' "Out of the mouth of babes": the child who unwittingly betrays its mother's adultery', Folklore, 106, 1995:77-83, adduces medieval and modern manifesta tions of this fabliau theme. In modern instances there tends to be a suggestion of incest, in the fabliaux a kind of spiritual incest since the parish priest is involved, so that the adultery is aggravated. R. ends with a psychoanalytical interpretation of the theme. P. Sosso, 'Le Vilain de Bailleul et la nouvelle de Ferondo', SFr, 39, 1995:201-12, compares the fabliau with Decameron m, 8 and finds in Boccaccio's version greater complexity and motivation, greater depth of character and a more sophisticated style. J. M. Ziolkowski, 'The erotic pater noster, redux', JVM, 97:329-32, is a reply to Lofstedt's 1988 reply (JVM, 89:212-14) to Z.'s 1987 article (NMi, 88:31-34) on erotic meaning in medieval Latin, French, and English. He brings new evidence from literature and canon law to indicate that 'a cele aprist sa patrenostre' in FrereDenise means 'had sexual intercourse with her'. miscellaneous. T. Hunt, 'A burlesque tale of adventure', FMLS, 315 *995:117-27) publishes a formerly unedited dit from MS B.N. fr. 837, in four-line rhyming stanzas of 176 Franco-Picard alexandrines (no date is proposed). H. warns against the dangers of too lightly attributing parody, and calls this dit neither parody nor satire but an entertaining skit.</page></plain_text>
