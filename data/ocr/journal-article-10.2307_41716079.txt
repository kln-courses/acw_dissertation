HOW of many the Nile of us, on who our have to travelled and from up leave, and down realise the that Haifa the Reach rocks of the Nile on our way to and from leave, realise that the rocks and cliffs, all the way from Wadi Haifa to Assuan, are covered with hundreds of thousands of rock pictures ? Though they are so numerous, and despite the universal attention aroused in recent years by petroglyphic art, very few of these Nubian engravings have yet been published. Nevertheless there are many valuable references to them in the works of the Egyptologists, and par- ticularly are we indebted to A. E. P. Weigall's survey in 190 7.1 Another most important contribution, this time from the geologists, is the chapter on " Rock Pictures " in Sandford and Arkell's recent work2 though, as they rightly observe, " The subject is in need of a compre- hensive survey of the Nile Valley akin to those made by Breuil and Newbold for the western deserts." There remains quite an amount of work to be done before the last word can be written on the Nubian petroglyphs. I should like to acknowledge, at the outset, the personal help and encouragement I have received from Prof, and Mrs. F. LI. Griffith, Dr. K. S. Sandford, Mr. A. Lucas, Mr. G. W. Grabham and Prof. G. Steindorff. I am also greatly indebted to officials of the British Museum, of the Egyptian Archaeological Survey, and of the French and American Research Schools in Palestine. It seems to me that the Nubian rock engravings can be studied best under five headings : Distribution, Subject-Matter, Stratigraphy, Tech- nique and Weathering. After looking at the engravings from these 1 " A Report on the Antiquities of Lower Nubia." A. E. P. Weigall.

" " When ? " and " Why ?" Distribution. An idea of the distribution of the engravings can be obtained most quickly and conveniently from the accompanying map though, as I have marked certain other remains as well, a short explanatory note is necessary. The course of the river is between north and north-east but is by no means straight. There are many bends, of which the most notable are those at Tomas and Korosko. This can be seen even on a small map* but for a detailed study the fifteen sheets that comprise the i : 50000 map of the Egyptian Survey Department should be consulted. It will be seen that, broadly speaking, the rock pictures and the Middle Nubian or C. Group cemeteries are concentrated between Toshki and Gerf Hussein, but, while the engravings are equally common to both banks, the cemeteries are generally confined to the west bank. There is no concentration of engravings between Toshki West and Aneiba to match the cemeteries, but this is explained by the lack of suitable rocks. We are concerned in this article only with such rock engravings as are to be found in Nubia, and it must not be imagined that Wadi Haifa and Assuan mark the limits of petroglyphic art in the Nile Valley. There are many recorded from Egypt. I have seen a very fine giraffe hammered on a rock at Gemmai, and there are other engravings, a little higher upstream, near Semnah. Many have been found in the Batn el Hagar by H. C. Jackson, who has very kindly shown me unpublished photo- graphs of some at Sabu and Akasha, and who tells me of these pictures that " they appear to date from, at any rate, the old Egyptian occupation as they depict, inter alia , typical Nile geese, an ancient type of boat, and the Egyptian ankh. There are also obvious later additions in the shape of Arabic scrawls, camels, Christian crosses, etc. Many of these pictures are exceedingly well delineated and show an amazing amount of life and motion." Whereas the rock pictures are plentiful all along the river banks the dynastic inscriptions are found, as a rule, at the termini of the short cuts</page><page sequence="3">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="4">SOME NUBIAN ROCK PICTURES 141 across the river bends. The natural inference is, surely, that the pictures were done by people who lived in the valley, while the inscriptions are the work of travellers. The best example of this is between Mediq and Tomas-Amada for, although there are engravings and cemeteries all along this bend, the only known inscription is that of Amenemhat I at Korosko. I have shown on the map only such dynastic and Christian inscrip- tions as are cut on the naked rocks. I have not indicated the temples and churches nor have I made any reference to Christian paintings in the many chapels. For example, Faras is shown as the site of a C. Group cemetery whereas it has a continuous recorded occupation from proto- dynastic times to the present day, and is perhaps best known from the fact that it was the largest Christian centre in Nubia. I have marked a concentration of rock engravings at Gudhi though this may be considered as hardly justified, for the number of pictures at this station does not compare with the tremendous concentrations at Gerf Hussein or Toshki. Gudhi gets a place on the map because it seems to indicate, as far as we know now, the northern limit, in Nubia, of both the rock pictures and the C. Group cemeteries. We must bear in mind, however, that, as is the case with the engravings, there are C. Group cemeteries in Egypt. It will be noticed that Tomas was the junction of the great caravan routes and it is here, as one would expect, that dynastic inscrip- tions of the Old and Middle Kingdoms are most plentiful. The Greek inscription shown at Abu Simbel is the famous one of the time of Psammetichus I on the left leg of the headless colossus. Though it is an exception to our purpose in that it is not cut in the naked rock its importance makes it worthy of mention. Subject-Matter. The subjects most frequently depicted on the rocks are boats, cattle, antelopes and giraffes. Not so common, though quite plentiful, are ostriches, human figures, camels, dogs and elephants. Very rare are donkeys or wild asses, wild sheep, horses and arabesques resembling basket-work patterns. There are a few subjects that are, so far as my experience goes, unique, for example, a hare, a lion, a cat (curiously with two tails as though the first one did not satisfy the artist), a crocodile, an ape, a large water bird, and a small sparrow-like bird. Of these the</page><page sequence="5">142 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS lion and the cat may be open to doubt as they are not now sufficiently clear for certainty. There seem to be no extinct fauna such as are found in the European caves or in North Africa, nor are there any fantastic animals like those on the Ancient Egyptian palettes, unless one so considers some of the sub- jects at Toshki East, though these I feel inclined to interpret as repre- senting that strange animal, the okapl. I have not encountered the antlered deer nor, which is perhaps more remarkable, have I ever seen (except for two scratchings by present-day children at Kasr Ibrim) a single example of a fish. There are no stencilled hands such as are as common elsewhere as are cup stones,1 though in this connexion the following account of a present day practice amongst nomad Arabs is most interesting. " Whenever a sheep is slaughtered some sort of ceremony is performed. Either an offering is made to the shades of the departed or the hand is dipped in the blood of the sacrificial animal, and the imprint of the bloody hand is put upon some favourite beast to guard it from evil or to make it prolific." 2 The boats are just the same as those on the Ancient Egyptian monu- ments. They range from the primitive papyrus-reed canoe to twenty- five-oared craft with cabins, masts and sails. Some of them display, raised on masts or poles, various cult-object signs. The picture of boats being hauled upstream by a score of men on a rope seems peculiar, in Nubia, to Gerf Hussein, and it is significant that the men are sometimes in charge of an overseer armed with a whip. These particular boat engravings are quite imposing, for though the individual men measure only a few inches in height, a score or more of them on a rope, together with the boat result in a picture that is from six to eight feet long. A similar subject with thirty-three men on the rope giving a picture ten feet long has been found eight miles north of Assuan, and is thought to represent a predynastic picture of men hauling a boat up the First Cataract.3 Amongst the cattle, the variety with long, widely spread horns (Bos africanus or B. macroceros) is by far the most common, though one 1 " Ancient Hunters."

When one remembers that Bos africanus is generally considered to have come from Central Africa it is most interesting to learn that the present day Beja, who possess both short horns and long horns, say that the former are indigenous and the latter a comparatively recent importation from the south.1 I have seen very few cattle like those on the predynastic palettes whose horns form a nearly closed ellipse, or a crescent of which the points nearly touch. The aurochs ( Bos primigenius) seems to be absent from the engravings, though he was known in Egypt as late as Old Kingdom times. Not infrequently associated with the cattle are human figures, and a spirited drawing at Gerf Hussein of a boy leading, at a run, a bull (which appears to have a halter round its neck) might be a subject from Dinka or Shilluk life to-day. Of the antelope family the ibex is plentiful and, like the oryx, which is fairly common, and the kudu, which is very rare, it is easily recognised by its distinctive horns. The ordinary gazelle (Gazella dorcas) is found frequently and, amongst the others, one is tempted to recognise the reed- buck and the addax. As the engravings of antelopes sometimes measure only a few inches one cannot always be certain of the subject and it is possible that there are a few sheep and goats. Giraffes and ostriches are, as a rule, particularly well done and the former are sometimes shown as being led by men with lassoes. When one looks at some of the ostriches at Gerf Hussein the question springs to one's mind, " Did the temple builders have anything to do with these engravings ? " and one recollects the rock sculptures up the Wadi Hammamat. The human figures are treated in a variety of ways. Some are like frogs standing on their hind legs though this is partially explained by the technique, for in these cases, of which there are examples at Wadi el Arab, the arms and legs look very thin while the whole of the body is intagliated. Some are like animated musical crochets and quavers, and these are nearly always in a state of poise as though dancing or skipping or walking a tightrope. Some stand on one leg with the other knee bent in the familiar Hadendoa attitude. Some are armed with bows and arrows, 1 I am indebted for this piece of information to G. E. R. Sandars, formerly District Commissioner, Beja.</page><page sequence="7">144 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS have a feather in the hair and look rather like hieroglyphic signs. Finally there are schematic figures, some of which resemble camel brands or perhaps letters of the Tifinagh alphabet. Rock engravings of dynastic figures, as distinct from temple and shrine sculptures, are extremely rare, and one, about a quarter of a mile up a khor at Tomas, is unique. It portrays four figures and no doubt represents a man petitioning the Gods of the Cataracts. Dogs seem to be of two kinds ; one looks like a perky terrier and the other, though different from the salugi dog, like a hound of some sort. Perhaps the latter is a form of the animal symbol of Set, twin brother of Osiris. It might be a jackal or wolf or hyaena, or even an animal type representing this group of the canine family. There are a few unusual pictures. A sakia wheel and a shadoof look quite recent. A flower or plant, perhaps a lotus, is strikingly like a Meroitic pottery decoration.1 There is, high up on the west cliff at Amada, a charming picture of a man with a bow. It is exceptionally large and the bow is taller than the man, who is posed in a most non- chalant attitude. When looking at the picture there springs to mind that Nubia was once " The Land of the Bow," and one remembers the story of the Nubian bow that was sent to Camby ses with the injunction that, until his archers were capable of drawing it, he should not think of attacking his southern neighbours. All the Nubian rock engravings are naturalistic and of subjects easily recognised. There are no therianthropic, zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, or theophanic representations. There is nothing anywhere that can be equated with the " Sorcerers " of Lourdes and Les Trois Frères, or with Barth's pictures from Murzuk. Out of all the human figures I remember only two (of which one is steatopygous) that are phallic. One recalls Newbold's tailed and phallic men from the South Libyan desert.2 More often than not all the various subjects are to be found at the same station. You do not find elephants at one place, giraffes at another, cattle at a third, and so on. Can we interpret this as meaning that the pictures do not represent the totems of tribes or nomes ?

For example, at Ashkeit, antelopes and cattle predominate and there are no boats, hieroglyphs, giraffes, or ostriches. Up a khor at Wadi el Arab there are elephants, giraffes, ostriches and antelopes, but no cattle, boats, or hieroglyphs, though all of these last are found lower down near the river bank. At Gerf Hussein the position is curious, for there the temple stands between two markedly different groups of engravings. South of the temple is a game-animal group with a few boats, cattle, hieroglyphs and camels, while north of the temple the pictures are almost all of boats and cattle. Weigall remarked on this ubiquity of the subjects, for in his frequent references to the " prehistoric," " archaic," or "very ancient" engravings, he says : " The early inhabitants were good draughtsmen and delighted in covering the rocks with drawings of the gazelles, oxen, giraffes, elephants and other animals which they saw around them, as well as with drawings of boats and sometimes of themselves." 1 Stratigraphy. Every student of prehistory has seen, or has resolved to see, the French cave art. One of the most interesting sights in the neighbourhood of Les Eyzies is, to my mind, the grotto of Laugerie Basse. At this station there are no engravings, except those housed in the adjacent museum, but part of the grotto has been cut in cross section and is as plainly stratified as is a pile of ham sandwiches. In Nubia the prehistorian is not so fortunate for, in the sandstone, there are no caves such as are found in limestone formations and stratifica- tion, in the European sense, is of particularly rare occurrence. Do the rock pictures bear any relation to river levels ? It is an established fact that river level has fallen continuously in Nubia, from the Lower Palaeolithic Age down to the present day. That there has been a slight lowering even in historic times is demonstrated by " the shifting of the cultivation from higher to lower terraces between the Predynastic Period and the Old Kingdom," 2 though such a big drop, since the Middle Kingdom, as that of twenty-six feet at Semnah3 is quite local. 1 A.

While it is a fact that engravings do occur at different heights (for example there is a crowded vertical range of thirty feet at Gerf Hussein) I have yet to find on one face of rock a series of parallel friezes descending in what looks like a chronological sequence. Very often, when there are many pictures at a station, those higher up on the rocks are such as would be dated, from other points of view, as younger than those lower down. At Toshki East there is a good instance of the seeming paradox of inverted stratigraphy. There are five groups of pictures, one above the other, and one would certainly say that, on all grounds except stratigraphy, the highest pictures are the youngest and that the others get older and older as they descend in the vertical scale. No doubt the explanation is that the first artist selected what was, to his mind, the choicest rock surface, and his successors fitted in their contributions to the picture gallery as best they could, being driven higher and higher up the rock. It seems to me that what really matters is not how high up the cliffs the pictures are, but rather how low down are those pictures which, from other considerations, one has reason to regard as the oldest. One could draw to-day pictures at Lower Palaeolithic level, but only a man in a diver's suit could have drawn, in Lower Palaeolithic times, pictures at to-day's level. From the levels I have taken there emerges a suggestion that would seem to be of the highest importance. It is that all of what I regard as the very oldest pictures are above Upper Sebilian flood level. I have used as my datum lines a present day flood of 98 metres at Assuan corresponding with 123-87 metres at Wadi Haifa (correcting zero on the Haifa gauge to 115 • 87 at Assuan and taking 8 metres as the Haifa flood), and Sandford and Arkell's Upper Sebilian levels (40 feet at Haifa and 25 feet at Assuan above modern flood). I took all my readings, making occasional checks against temples and survey bench marks, with a care- fully tested Direct Reading Tacheometer. My lowest level for a picture of an elephant worked out at five feet above Sandford and Arkell's Upper Sebilian line. At Amada, about three miles downstream from the temple,</page><page sequence="10">SOME NUBIAN ROCK PICTURES I47 there is an isolated and very conspicuous boulder measuring nine or ten feet cube. It lies half way up the beach between present high water mark and the foot of the cliffs. It is surely significant that this comparatively low lying boulder, which was awash in Upper Sebilian times, is smothered on all sides with dynastic inscriptions but does not bear a single rock picture. High up on the cliffs behind this boulder, at 140 feet above present-day flood, there are a few pictures that clearly date from the Middle Kingdom or New Empire. Perhaps in time we shall be able, by measuring all the lowest levels at which the various picture-subjects occur, to work out a comprehensive stratigraphical scheme for the whole of Nubia, but I feel that this will only be possible after a comparison of many more levels than I have yet been able to take. One might mention here some rock engravings at Thebes which, though at Lower Palaeolithic level, are regarded as not earlier than Neolithic times.1 Fortunately the case, from the stratigraphical point of view, is not as discouraging as might at first sight appear, for there are several palimpsests and superpositions that furnish us with most valuable evidence. Either the defacement is a picture over an earlier picture, or, more rarely, an inscription over a picture. The elephant is, invariably, in my experience, at the bottom of the sequence and inscriptions are always at the top. Intermediate subjects are not so definite, for example, at Tomas, there is a giraffe over a boat and, quite close to it, a boat over a giraffe. At Toshki East there is an interesting Hyksos Period inscription cut across some giraffes and gazelles, while at Ashkeit there is a Greek Christian inscrip- tion cut over an antelope. Among Breastead's pictures from the desert north-west of Abu Simbel there is an ostrich on top of a giraffe. I have never seen an instance of a human figure or of a camel as a palimpsest or superposition. It would seem established from these superpositions that the elephant is the oldest subject and that the inscriptions are later than the latest animal drawings. The sandstone boulders and cliffs are darkened or blackened by weathering except when they have been quarried by the Ancient Egyptians or fractured by landslides. It is significant that the rock engravings, with 1 " Gravures Protohistoriques de la Montagne Thébaine." Rémy Cottevieille- Giraudet. Bulletin de l'Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale du Caire.

Similarly, though you often see engravings on the rocks near the temples, as for example at Derr or Gerf Hussein, you never find them on the dressed stone of the temples themselves. In Nubia, where there are no flint bearing strata, artifacts were made of sandstone, quartz, ironstone, and hard rocks from the cataracts. By far the commonest surface finds are the Late Sebilian microliths of agate and chalcedony, though I should be most reluctant to say that I have found any recognised industry in actual association with the engravings as has been the case with Capsian flints in North Africa. Cup stones and hammer stones are common everywhere on the Haifa Reach but do not help us as they have no cultural or chronological significance. One type of implement, of which I found a few examples at the foot of engraved rocks and so probably in association with the engravings, is unusual, but makes an ideal tool for rock drawing. It is an isosceles triangle with the long sides measuring three to four inches, a base of two- and-a-half inches, and is from a quarter to half an inch thick. It is of recemented sandstone and might be described as a flat coup-de-poing . It affords a perfect grip on all three sides and any apex can be used with equal facility so that it is, in effect, three tools in one. It is very hard and very well weathered all over. There are two other considerations which might be regarded as stratigraphical lines of approach. On the distribution of fauna in the Lower Nile Valley in ancient times there is the greatest diversity of opinion. For example, one view is that the Lower Nile in predynastic times was like the White Nile to-day1, whereas another opinion is that, even in predynastic times, the elephant and the giraffe did not penetrate north of where now stands Khartoum2, 8. There seems to be no doubt that the elephant disappeared from Egypt not later than the beginning of the historic period for he plays no part in Egyptian mytho- logy. Nevertheless the general opinion that he retreated southwards 1 " Egypt as a Field for Anthropological Kesearch." P. K. Newberry.

If Nubia had lost its rainfall by Lower Sebilian times and Upper Egypt not until Upper Sebilian times1 it follows that Nubia dried up before Egypt, so that the elephant and the giraffe would survive in Egypt longer than in Nubia. We thus have reason to suppose that rock engravings of elephants in Nubia may be very early indeed. In the temple mural decorations, for example at Bët el Wali where the king is shown as receiving tribute from the Ethiopians, the offerings include ostriches, giraffes and elephant's tusks. Presumably such offerings were rarities from the south and the elephant was so far south, by the XlXth Dynasty, that only his tusks could be brought. If we add to these considerations the extreme probability that there has been no local change of climate during historic times2, we may reasonably assume that the retreat of the elephant from Nubia began in what cor- responded with the Upper Palaeolithic Period in Europe, and that he was followed successively by the giraffe, the ostrich and the antelope. The last stratigraphical line of approach is by way of the ancient pottery, palettes, ivories and such like or, if we may so express it, a com- parison between the petroglyphs and the local art mobilier. There are many striking resemblances between the pottery decorations and the rock engravings, and the similarity seems to hold more particularly in pre- dynastic and C. Group times. Any good museum will furnish examples, and there are copious descriptions and illustrations in various publications.3 The predynastic pottery is classified in the Cairo Museum in six groups, ranging from the earliest Black Topped ware to the latest Pink Decorated ware. Unfortunately it is impossible to work out an exact chronological subject sequence from the pottery, though valuable clues are by no means missing. The earliest Black Topped ware has scratchings of antelopes amongst which the ibex is to be clearly distinguished. Then there seems to be no animal decoration until Group V, the Cross Line ware, which displays lizards or crocodiles, scorpions and gazelles, in red paint on a pink ground. Group VI, the Pink Decorated ware, is 1 Sandford and Ar kell, op cit., p. 85. 2 " The Geography of the Mediterranean Region. Its Relation to Ancient History." E. C.

It would seem important that elephants are very rare and of very early date, and it is curious that the arabesque basket pattern on the rocks is matched to perfection on the protodynastic and C. Group pottery.1 Of the protodynastic finds at Faras " only those types of pottery which are found also in Egypt and are probably of Egyptian fabric, bear engraved figures : - animals, birds, fishes, stars, oars, ropes and other objects difficult to identify. The same scratched designs are met with in Egypt, and may have been put on the vessels as distinctive marks by their owners, or simply for ornament."2 The slate palettes afford many good examples of elephants, for not only are some of them elephant-shaped but many are also incised with very fine figures of elephants. It may be that these palettes, like the bear palettes, were inspired from Syria. Elliot Smith sees on some of the slate palettes " certain mammals and birds whose habitat is Abyssinia and the adjoining part of Somaliland."3 Opinion is divided as to the source of the predynastic ivory supply. It may be that the elephant was still in Egypt (and, from the pottery marks, the giraffe and the strange okapi too)4 though I feel it is much more likely that he had already gone, and that the ivory was imported from the south5 or perhaps from Syria. There are other objects, too, that afford interesting comparisons. The distinctive Badarian ivory spoons mostly end in animal forms of which the ibex is a favourite, while an Early Dynastic mace from Lower Nubia had a gold mounted handle covered with figures of animals including elephant, giraffe, antlered deer, bull, cow, lion, leopard and Prof. Peet gives a timely reminder that some of the present pottery classification terms are misnomers.

This beautiful piece of work has been stolen, unfortunately, from the Cairo Museum.1 Technique. In Nubia, as in other parts of the world, the rock engravings are executed in . a number of different ways. Sometimes the figures are shown in dotted or continuous outline and sometimes as complete shadows or silhouettes. In the last case the whole body of the subject is as though stencilled but, invariably, it is the figure and never its surround that is removed from the rock, or, in other words, the pictures may be intaglios but are never cameos. This is rather curious for in Ancient Egyptian sculpture the bas relief is older than the sunk relief, and, in the case of the painted hands of palaeolithic art, the stencils are both positive and negative. There is also a great variation in the sizes of the engravings for, though they are generally from about nine inches to two feet, they do range from life-size to diminutive representations measuring only three or four inches. In a word, the technique in Nubia is just the same as it is all over Africa or as far afield as Australia.2 It is generally considered that, in North Africa, the incised line, dotted line, and hammered surface techniques, as also the variations in size, represent a chronological sequence, though it is recognised, too, that subject matter and patination play important parts.3 Cottevieille- Giraudet would seem to regard subject-matter as a more reliable guide than technique, and considers that the different styles, rather than affording a continuous sequence, are evidences of a recurring fashion cycle.4 My own opinion is that, in Nubia, the techniques fall into two main divisions which I propose to call Ancient and Modern. I regard as Ancient such styles as are executed with stone tools, and as modern the 1 This gold handle is described and illustrated in the Archaeological Survey of Nubia. Report for 1910-1911. C. M.

In this respect there is an interesting resemblance between the Nubian engravings and those in South Africa.1 The Nubian Ancient group is subdivided into the orthodox dotted line, incised line, and hammered or bruised surface techniques. I do not see in these subdivisions a chronological sequence but feel that, while technique is influenced sometimes by fashion or by individual caprice, and sometimes by the time factor, it is imposed primarily by the materials used. Patinated Nubian sandstone is often so hard, superficially, that it can be worked only by pecking, pocking, hammering, or bruising, and cannot be graved unless with an infinitude of patience resulting in sore fingers. I have tried to draw pictures with various stones, with sherds, with little scrapers made of beaten copper and hardened steel, and with files mounted in convenient holders. The only really suitable tool is that of a type resembling the isosceles triangle already described, and to give the best results it should be of a size that can both be held comfortably in the palm of the hand and, at the same time, delicately controlled by the fingers. Once the patina of the rock is broken, rather like chipping an enamel, the softer stone underneath, being no harder than bath brick, can be rubbed or scraped with the greatest of ease. It seems reasonable to suppose that when ancient man wished to draw a rock picture he set about it just as we should to-day. He selected his face of rock and then sketched or roughed out his subject, in dotted line, by pecking away the patina. He would proceed to put in more and more dots, and the closer the dots the more nearly continuous the line would be until, eventually, a fair line would result. In practice the line is generally about half-an-inch wide by a quarter-of-an-inch deep, and is like a shallow " U " in cross section. In some of the very small pictures the line is of necessity finer, so that undoubtedly tools of different sizes, or at least of different thicknesses, were used. As an example of small pictures one might mention ibex measuring only four inches, in which the horns are shown by two most clearly defined parallel curves. Having completed his outline the artist, given sufficient time, would think about elaborating his sketch (for example by giving the giraffe its lozenge markings) and perhaps the ultimate result of this would be the bruising or hammering of the whole of the surface enclosed by his line, so that his 1 " South Africa's Past in Stone and Paint."

All these Ancient techniques seem equally common to every subject, and I am unable to equate any particular technique with a picture that would be assigned, from other considerations, to a definite period. The position as regards the Modern, or metal tool, technique is clear and admits of no doubt. This technique includes such subjects as camels, feluccas, cattle, donkeys, horses and crudely drawn men. A curious Modern subject is the outline of the foot and brings to mind the stencilled hands of palaeolithic art. The foot is placed on the rock and a line scratched round it just as one would draw an outline on a self-measurement form for a pair of new shoes. Quite a number, one could safely say the majority, of present-day engravings are done in the horizontal plane, that is to say " on the floor " as though by someone kneeling or sitting down. The Modern line is narrower and deeper than the Ancient line, is usually a " V " in cross section, and is drawn with a knife, dagger, nail, or perhaps even a sherd, for the Modern engravings are on unweathered, or on lightly weathered, rock. To clinch matters the present inhabitants can tell you when many of the Modern engravings were done, while they know so little about the others that they do not even attribute them to the " Anag." There are associated with the Modern engravings Arabic names and prayers, and marks for the native games resembling Draughts and Nine Mens' Morris. The standard of the Modern work is vastly inferior to that of the Ancient which is, in many instances, of a very high order. " The older the better " is a fairly safe maxim in Nubia as elsewhere. This may be explained by the fact that most of the Modern pictures are done by children, but is chiefly due to the type of tool used. It is easy to draw any curve in the Ancient style, but a metal tool always gives a " quad- rangular " effect which looks very crude and puerile. The Nubian pictures resemble so closely those at Owenat that some of my photographs are interchangeable with those taken by Hassanein Bey,1 and it may be that " they were drawn by somebody who was trying to compose a scene " though this is very much open to question. Some of the little men with bows and arrows might well seem to be shooting at animals, but the rocks are so crowded that they cannot fail to appear 1 " Crossing the Untraversed Libyan Desert." A. M.

I have seen a gazelle with its kid, also an elephant with its calf, and Weigall mentions a gazelle attacked by four dogs ; while at Wadi el Arab the large panel with men and game animals, and, at Gerf Hussein, the men hauling the boats, two horses playing or fighting unconscious of a crocodile that is about to attack one of them, and the lassoed giraffes and cattle might also be regarded as compositions. There is, however, hardly anything in Nubia to m^tch those com- posed scenes of the hunt, the dance, and everyday life that we know from Eastern Spain, North Africa and Australia. Special mention must be made of a quite unusual picture at Amada, half a mile inland and half a mile upstream from the boulder on the west bank previously described. There are five horses, two being riderless but the other three carrying men who are brandishing cross-hilted swords. The horses are saddled and bridled, the saddles having high pommels and cantles. Leading the horses, or perhaps fighting with the mounted men (of whom they have dislodged two) are men on foot, apparently unarmed. To the left of the horses are two armed and crouching men who seem to be having a duel, sword and shield against spear and shield, or it may be that they are attacking an animal. At the left, too, there is a boat, and there are also, on the same rock, two camels and three buffaloes. The whole panel is most intriguing and seems capable of two interpretations. Either it represents a raid (perhaps Blemmye) successfully beaten off, and the raiders are cutting their way to their boat to get back to the east bank, or it represents a ceremonial procession, possibly in connexion with the horse burial of a dead chief. Whatever the picture may mean I should say there is little doubt that it is to be assigned to the time of the civilisa- tion recently unearthed by W. B. Emery and L. Kirwan near Abu Simbel, in which the horse, the sword, and the spear played so great a part. Enquiry from the local " oldest inhabitant " elicited the reply : " Did not the Roman do them and do not the English always ask questions about such things ? " Tomas is the only other station at which I have seen these mounted men armed with swords and spears, and there, only three such figures. One of them was so red that I thought, at first, it was coloured, but a closer examination revealed thát the sandstone, under its weathering, was brick red. I have noticed this brick red sandstone at a few other places, but it is by no means common. All the mounted men with swords and spears were found on my last, and nineteenth, survey.</page><page sequence="21">Sudan Notes and Records.

A very distinctive feature of some of the Nubian engravings suggests that they are not altogether haphazard. The animals, more particularly the giraffes and ostriches, are often in processions of four, five or six. It is possible that these processional representations, or regular repetitions, have a magical import, or they may be evidences of an instinct for rhythm and order.1 When I asked a particularly intelligent native why he thought the giraffes and ostriches were shown in processions he replied : " Why not ? Do they not go about in real life like that ? Have you ever seen a lone ostrich or giraffe ?" If you buy an ivory elephant in Omdur- man do you not afterwards buy others and arrange them all in a pro- cession on your table or mantelpiece ? Why ? The similarity of the Nubian engravings to those at Owenat opens up the question of any possible relationship between the petroglyphic art of the Nile Valley and that in other parts of the world. The late E. H. L. Schwarz seems not only to attribute to the Bushmen the pictures dis- covered by Newbold, Hassanein Bay and Prince Kemal ed Din, but also to see Bushmen affinities in Spain, France, Austria and predynastic Egypt. His suggestion that Owenat may be identified with the Uhat of the Vlth Dynasty2 is not convincing. It is most unlikely that there is any philological connexion between the two names, and, in any case, Uhat meant any oasis or, even more generally, any water and not any one particular oasis. The Abbé Breuil also writes of the analogy between Owenat, South Africa, and Eastern Spain, and considers it too close to be fortuitous.3 Frobenius journeyed through the Nubian desert and the Atbai in 1926, and particularly searched those regions for rock engravings and paintings. As far as I know he has not yet published his finds, though it is said that they indicate a resemblance between Nubia and the Sahara.4 All the engravings in Nubia that I have seen are simple and straightforward. There are no " suggestive " or " impressionist " pictures, such as we know both from the art mobilier and the cave paintings in palaeolithic Europe. 1 The question of animal " thematic groupings " on the predynastic ivories is discussed by G. Bénédite, op cit, pp. 226-228. 2 " The Kalahari and its Native Races." E. H. L. Schwarz, 1928, p. 143, et seq. 8 L. Frobenius and H. Breuil, op cit, p. 97, et seq. 4 " Bushman Art. H.

It is inconceivable that, had there ever been paintings, they could all have disappeared, and this lack is all the more curious when one recalls rock paintings so near home as those at Gebel Geili,1 Gebel Moya, Gebel Segadi and in Northern Kordofan.2 Newbold also mentions a procession of cattle in the South Libyan desert which, while not painted, is nevertheless coloured red by rubbing with friable red sandstone.3 It may be, though the idea is questioned,4 that there is something in Stow's theory that the Bushmen are descended from two remote northern tribes, one of which, cave dwellers, were painters and the other, open air folk, were sculptors. Weathering. Weathering, or patination, is generally considered by prehistorians as a somewhat capricious factor, and therefore is regarded rather as a check, or cross reference, than as a sure guide or absolute criterion. In Nubia where there has been little, if any, rain since the earliest rock pictures could have been drawn, the sandstone has been weathered under conditions that are, for our purpose, ideal, and we have much more confidence in patination than would be justified in less favoured localities. Those, Egyptologists and others, who have studied the rock pictures in the Nile Valley and have compared them with the dynastic inscriptions are all agreed that, if any reliance can be placed upon patination, the former must date very much farther than the latter. As long ago as 1893 Sir Flinders Petrie wrote : " All over this district (i.e., Silsileh) are many rude figures of animals, marked on the rock by hammering : they are of various ages, some perhaps modern, but the earlier ones certainly before the eighteenth Dynasty ; and, to judge by the weathering of the rock, it seems probable that they were begun here long before any of the monu- ments of Egypt that we know. The usual figures are of men, horses and boats, but there are also camels, ostriches and elephants to be seen.5" 1 " Meroitic Remains." G. O. Whitehead and F. Addison. Sudan Notes and Records.

This is very misleading, for there are degrees of patination and it is by no means confined to the pictures. The term " desert varnish," suggesting, as it does, a glaze or polish applied externally, is not a happy one, for the film is not bright but dull or matt, and comes from within the rock itself. Expressed clearly but crudely the film is petrified perspiration. It is to be understood that we are considering only desert film on Nubian sandstone. We are not concerned with river film or with lime- stone and granite, for all our engravings are on sandstone and are, and always have been, above high water mark.1 Can we arrive at any idea as to how long sandstone takes to weather ? General opinion seem to be on the side of Gautier when he says : " Mais nous ne savons pas du tout quel temps il faut pour patiner une gravure.2" I feel that this is an unnecessarily pessimistic conviction, at least in the Nile Valley where there are criteria that are more helpful than may be the case in North Africa. Nubian sandstone is, when freshly broken, as pale as straw or honey. It may even, on very rare occasion, be white. When it has completely weathered it is generally soot-black. If we compose a spectrum with chrome yellow at one end and lamp-black at the other, with intermediate ochre, sienna and umber, we have a very fair idea of the different shades seen on the rocks. The weathering of sandstone is like the case-hardening of steel in that the farther the material is penetrated the softer it becomes. On a com- pletely weathered rock there is a crust that may be as much as an inch thick, and which sometimes may be stripped from the rock-like bark from a tree. This crust is covered with a film that is sometimes as hard as glass but is so thin that it cannot be measured. On its inner side the crust is crumbly and looks like seed cake. As the crust shades in colour from darkest at the film to palest at the rock juncture, it follows that the more deeply an engraving is cut into the rock the fresher and less weathered it looks. The degree of blackness of the film depends, naturally, on the man- ganese content of the stone, so that it is quite possible for two films to be 1 For a full discussion of the weathering of Nubian sandstone see The Blackened Rocks of the Nile Cataracts and of the Egyptian Deserts." A. Lucas, Cairo, Ministry of Finance, 1905. .b. .r . Gautier, op cit , p. 120.</page><page sequence="26">158 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS of the same age though of slightly different colour. Also film has varying degrees of hardness and is on occasion so soft that pecking would not be a compulsory technique, but a picture could be rubbed or graved on the rock. The rate of weathering may be affected, possibly, by the texture of the stone, for it seems to me that a close grained, hard sandstone does not weather as quickly as a coarser and softer variety. Such factors as comparative exposure to wind and sun do certainly have an influence on weathering. I once whitened, for photographic purposes, some inscrip- tions on a boulder and, having very little time, did not brush off the whitening. Three years later I revisited the boulder. On the side facing the prevailing wind all the whitening had disappeared, while on the other side it was still as clear as I had left it. It is not unreasonable to suppose that any particular piece of stone will weather, there being no variation in climatic conditions, at a uniform rate, so that, if we can look upon umber as being twice as dark as ochre, the probability is that it takes twice as long to weather to umber as to ochre. If we bear all these considerations in mind then, in such a localised area as the Nubian Nile, it should not be impossible to arrive at some idea of the comparative ages of two engravings. Naturally, the ideal com- parison is of two engravings close together on the same rock and cut to the same depth. In any case it is not solely the colour of the engraving that is important, but that colour compared with the colour of the contiguous rock surface, and considered in conjunction with the depth to which the crust has been penetrated. Given sufficient time, and an adequate number of observations, one might work out a spectrum sequence that would date most of the engravings. There is one insuperable difficulty, and that is that no such spectrum could determine the date of the upper limit, for, once the rock has weathered to black, it cannot weather any more or get any darker in colour or older in appearance, so that if a black picture may be as little as 7,000 years old it may equally well be as much as 70,000 years old. Expressed otherwise " une patine noire est un terminus ad quern , mais pas a quo 1 It is fortunate that, in the Nile Valley, history goes back so far, for this does give us an opportunity of partially testing our theories of patina- tion. There is an uninterrupted series of rock inscriptions from Old 1 " L' Adrar Ahnet." Th. Monod. Institut d'Ethnologie, Paris, T. 19, 1932, p. 83.

It is also a fact that the oldest inscrip- tions are very much less weathered than are some of the pictures. This patinatory evidence of the rock inscriptions is confirmed by similar con- siderations of tho rock temples and quarries. Abu Simbel and Kirtassi at once spring to mind, for the former has been defaced by a succession of vandals, while the latter, which has hardly been disturbed since Roman times, bears the tool marks, the votive inscriptions, and some interesting engravings (a lion, a snake, two wine jars and some hawks) of the priests and the stone cutters. The votive inscriptions are cut into the quarry face and look like brasses in a church, and both inscriptions and engravings are clearly the work of professional sculptors. From considerations of weathering I feel that the upper limit of the rock pictures is marked by elephant engravings, which are always black, and the lower limit by scratchings, which are not weathered at all and belong to the present day. Between these extremes I should place, in descending order, giraffes, antelopes, ostriches, cattle, dogs, horses and camels. Naturally there are no strictly defined dividing lines but a shading from one group to another with a certain amount of overlapping, and, here and there, an exception to any rule that could be formulated ; nor would the various divisions in any scheme be of equal duration. Some subjects persist for a very long time and span two or more groups ; for example, the antelopes are both older and younger than the ostriches, while the boats and human figures have an even wider straddle. Conclusions. Are we now in a position to attempt answers to the questions " Who drew the rock pictures ?" " When ? " and " Why ? " I feel that they fall into three main groups, a game-animal group, a cattle group and a boat group. I feel, too, that these three groups form, broadly speaking, a continuous sequence and that they are the work of successive inhabitants of Nubia, whom we may describe as hunters, farmers and traders. The last group has a particularly wide straddle, and though the majority of the boats are comparatively late the earliest of them must be considered as anterior to the cattle. We might be justified in subdividing the boat group into Early, Middle and Late, but this would</page><page sequence="29">l60 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS unnecessarily complicate matters for it was continuous and progressive and was not separated into distinct phases by the cattle group. It seems probable that the boat group has its modest beginnings before the cattle period, then ran parallel with the cattle group, and reached its full develop- ment after the days of the cattle group were over. The argument that the engravings were the work of the inhabitants of the country may not be altogether convincing, and it is possible that some of them were drawn by visitors. One recalls Breasted's rock pictures of boats some miles inland from Abu Simbel and, more par- ticularly, the graffiti between Kharga and Dakhla of which Harding King wrote : " The drawings of ostriches and the fragments of their shells which are often to be found in the Libyan Desert, even in the neighbourhood of the Egyptian oases, has been held to show that they once existed wild in this part of the desert. But the argument is by no means conclusive ; ostrich eggs used frequently to be brought from the Sudan by the old slave raiding caravans who used them as food, and the drawings no more show that ostriches inhabited this part than the pictures of boats show that dahabiehs once sailed over the desert in the neighbourhood say of Dakhla oasis. The occurence of these and of drawings of antelopes and other wild animals merely show that some of the travellers who used these roads came from districts where the creatures they represented could be seen." 1 I think that we have already accounted satisfactorily, in Nubia, for the travellers by caravan when we pointed out that inscriptions are found at the termini of the short cuts across the river bends, whereas the pictures are to be seen all along the river banks. One might mention here the rock engravings of boats and animals up the Wadi Abad, thirty- seven miles east of Edfu.2 How far back may we reasonably expect the Nubian rock pictures to take us ? I assume that we will neither quarrel with Osborn when he says, "No trace of artistic instinct whatever has been found among the Neanderthals," 3 nor question Elliot Smith's dictum that the period of the artist hunters is the beginning of the Neanthropic Age.4 We thus rule out palaeanthropic man altogether and start our investigations with 1 " Mysteries of the Libyan Desert."

Even the earliest history of neanthropic man is not very relevant to the matter in hand, for it does not greatly concern us here whether his cradle was in North Africa or in Asia. What is important is that Homo sapiens was established in North Africa at a very early date, say at a time corresponding with the Laufen retreat in Europe, and that the Sahara became a centre of dispersion for neanthropic culture (the primary centre if neanthropic man originated in North Africa, or a secondary centre if he came from Asia). From the Sahara neanthropic man set out on his travels, and it is generally believed that he advanced in three great waves taking with him his Capsian industries and his petroglyphic art. It would seem that only the last migration with its Final Capsian or microlithic industry was towards the east, and that it reached the Nile Valley in the distinctive form of the Upper Sebilian. If this is so we should expect the rock pictures in the Nile Valley to be younger than some of those in Europe and South Africa and much younger than the oldest in North Africa. Perhaps the first two migrations were from choice and followed the lines of least resistance, north to Europe and south down the length of Africa, there being no way to the east by reason of the swamps. This would explain the common origin of Bushman and Eastern Spanish art. The last migration was undoubtedly from necessity, caused by the dessication of the Sahara, and dispersion was in all possible directions. Not only was the road to the east now open but the Nile Valley would have been a comparative paradise. Many authorities consider that the North African petroglyphs may be palaeolithic, but that they are more usually described as neolithic does not necessarily mean that they are younger than the European cave art. In those days North Africa was a cultural stage ahead of Europe, and Egyptian Neolithic may possibly have gone back as much as 12,000 years further than the corresponding phase in Europe.1 We are on firmer ground when we equate the earliest Egyptian Predynastic with the Magdalenian of Europe, and such an equation will serve as a very con- venient datum line2 1 " Fossil Men."

Can we suggest á date for a rock picture in Nubia that (a) was drawn when the elephant was roaming the country ; (b) was drawn when the Nile at Haifa may have been not more than forty feet higher than it is now ; (c) is so old that it is weathered to the same colour as the surrounding rock ; (d) must have been drawn with a stone tool, most probably some form of coup-de-poing ; ( e ) attains a high artistic standard ? Surely a picture that fulfils these conditions must go back to Upper Palaeolithic times. When we remember that no pottery has ever been associated with even the uppermost Sebilian discoveries, and that we have reason for equating the earliest Predynastic with the Magdalenian, it follows that the oldest Nubian rock pictures are in all probability as old as those of the Middle Aurignacian Period in the European caves. If one must hazard a date I should put it at about 10,000 B.C. Sir H. H. Johnston, writing in 1911, suggested that the Egyptian rock pictures might go back 20,000 years or so.1 On the other hand, J. W. Crowfoot in his descriptions of the drawings at Gebel Geili, which are similar in subject (except for the absence of boats and ostriches), technique and weathering, to the Nubian engravings, hesitates to assign to them a date more remote than " the close of the Roman period."2 The Roman period has been suggested, too, as a probable date for some " rude drawings of men and animals " near Amada,3 and I should regard it as not unlikely that the earliest camels, at Gerf Hussein, are of about this age. If we ascribe the Nubian pictures of elephants to Upper Palaeolithic times then all the other pictures fall neatly into place, and the result is a general scheme that is harmonious and accords convincingly with all that we know of local geology, archaeology and history. Following upon the heels of the elephants I should place the giraffes, antelopes and ostriches, and it seems reasonable to assign the earliest of these to the Predynastic Period, when the inhabitants of Nubia were great hunters of the desert 1 " The Opening up of Africa."

I think that the giraffes would disappear before the ostriches, which would be followed in their turn by the various antelopes. During the past five years I have seen three gazelles in the Faras district but nowhere an ibex or an oryx. From what we know of the C. Group, or Middle Nubians, there can hardly be any doubt that they played a very great part in the engraving of the boats and cattle, especially the cattle. Whether they were Temehu from the west, whether they came from Darfur and Kordofan or even from the ancient land of Punt, is still a matter for speculation, though it is agreed that they were of the same Hamitic stock as were the earliest neanthropic inhabitants of North Africa. Can we say of rock engraving, as has been said of the throwing stick and the spiked wheel-trap, that it is an example of " the early generalised Hamitic culture of northern and eastern Africa ?" 1 That the earliest Nubian engravings, good as some of them are, do not attain to the amazing standard of European palaeo- lithic art is perhaps due to the fact that they are purely Hamitic and have not the added inspiration of culture contact.2 What would be more natural for man, soon after he reached the Nile, than to try and cross it ? We might therefore expect the boat to be amongst the early subjects portrayed on the rocks. As man settled down in the valley he no doubt built bigger and bigger boats until, in C. Group times, he came to occupy himself largely with trade and river transport. Perhaps the pictures, at Gerf Hussein, showing a score of men dragging a boat upstream under the whip of an overseer may be dated to the end of the C. Group period, and mark the subjection of Nubia under the Middle Kingdom. We cannot leave the C. Group people without expressing surprise at the total lack of rock paintings. When we remember their love of colour as exampled by their beautiful pottery with its incised patterns filled in with red, yellow, blue, green and white, and their dyed skin garments, we must wonder greatly why they have left us no rock paintings. The Ancient rock pictures seem to come to an end with the close of the New Empire and to be linked, by the straggling continuity of a few camels and Greek inscriptions, with the Modern engravings and Arabic scrawls 1 " Egyptian Influence in Negro Africa."

It is a significant fact that the Modern engravings generally stand apart as conspicuously in space as in time, for Ancient and Modern are very rarely found on the same rocks, and never have I seen the Modern superposed on the Ancient. What is the explanation of the rock pictures ? Are they the natural outcome of an instinctive urge for artistic expression ? Were the first ones done out of sheer boredom and the others in imitation ? Is it only now, in Nubia, that there is so very little to do and such an infinitude of time in which to do it, or was it always so except for periodic but widely spaced upheavals ? Have the engravings any magical or religious import ? Were the ancient pictures drawn for the same reason as are the modern ones ? At Ashkeit, on the top of the sandstone hill on whose western face are the Ancient pictures, is a little stone zariba, enclosing an uninscribed headstone and the usual pots and bowls associated with a sheikh's tomb. The inhabitants protest that no one is buried there but that the site used to serve, until a few years ago, as the pulpit of a local holy man who preached there every Friday and Monday, though why Monday seems a mystery. The whole village used to gather round, and while the elders listened to the sermon the children scratched on the rocks. The inhabit- ants are quite clear about this and are in no confusion whatever between the Modern work and the near-by Ancient engravings. The scratchings include innumerable Arabic inscriptions, lines for games like our " noughts and crosses," and two horses, all done with a nail or a knife or perhaps a sherd. At many other places, too, one learns that the pictures of camels, donkeys, human figures and feluccas, are drawn by boys who have nothing better to do. Although rock drawing is not nowadays an adult pastime it is inconceivable that the Ancient pictures are the work of children. They are far too good and are undoubtedly the work of men and even, sometimes, of artists. The concentrations of Ancient engravings are usually found where the present cultivation is particularly extensive and where no doubt there has always been a population above the average, so that the sites may well mark tribal meeting places. Perhaps the rock pictures up the khors indicate where the hunters lay in wait for the game near the favourite drinking spots. At some places where, on historical grounds, one might expect to find concentrations of pictures, as for example at Aneiba and Faras, the rocks are both far back</page><page sequence="36">Sudan Notes and Records.

We know, from animal cults, tomb paintings, and other sources, that the Ancient Egyptians were very superstitious, and that magic was a potent influence in their lives. If between the primitive and the historic there is no great gulf fixed, but the latter is a development of or an evolution from the former, then it is reasonable to argue that magic must have played an important part from man's earliest days. It is widely agreed that this is so and that, making due allowance for the temporary ascendancy of intrusive cults, the gods of the Dynastic Egyptians were the development of the spirits and ghosts of the earlier inhabitants of the Nile Valley, whose beliefs were much the same as those that obtain amongst the tribes of Central Africa to-day. Can we go so far as to suggest that the sacrificial animals and sacred barques that decorate the tombs bear the same import as the animals and boats that are carved on the rocks ? At least one authority thinks that we can and that magic, totems, cults and ceremonies meant just the same to the primitive Egyptians as to the dynastic Egyptians, the palaeolithic Europeans and the aboriginal Australians.1 It has also been suggested that the incised and coloured figures of cows and calves on the C. Group stelae might have a magical significance and that their purpose was to ensure perhaps a supply of milk for the dead.2 Perhaps Weigall had magic in his mind when he wrote of the rock pictures at Gerf Hussein : " From the earliest times the cliffs of the western bank at this spot seem to have been sacred." 3 There can be very few people nowadays who do not think that magic was the mainspring of European glacial art. This conclusion is based upon such features as the drawing of arrows sticking into the animals, the situation of the pictures in the deepest and darkest cave recesses, the portrayal of masked dancers or " sorcerers," the custom of shooting at the pictures, and the attempts to draw magic itself.4 The nearest approach I know to a magical picture in early Egyptian art is the decora- tion on a predynastic bowl,5 but I have seen nothing like this on the 1 " Primitive Art in Egypt."

I see no evidence of a magical element in any of the Nubian rock pictures, unless there be a possible magical interpretation of the little men with bows and arrows, and the " processional representa- tions " or " thematic groupings " previously mentioned. When one stands in a palaeolithic cave in the Dordogne, even though it is lighted by electricity, one cannot but feel that there is something ghostly and sinister about the place. One imagines it as a proper setting for all sorts of weird cults and ceremonies. There is, most assuredly, magic in the air. No doubt one would experience the same eerie feeling in the depths of an equatorial forest. Things are quite different in Nubia where there is nothing of which to be afraid. One looks at the rock pictures. There they are in the full light of day. They are candid and simple. There is nothing furtive or frightening about them. There is no need to call upon magic for their explanation. Perhaps, though, even in Nubia, the sun was not always so genial or the sand so golden. The stillness, up the Wadi el Arab where the best elephant pictures are, that one finds so soothing for a few hours may well have been a silence that was terrifying to those who lived there long ago. Notwithstanding all this, the negative evidence may have an important magical significance. Among the animals that were sacred to the Ancient Egyptians from the earliest times were the bull, cow, sow, ram (particularly perhaps in Nubia as it was the symbol of Khnum at Elephantine), goat, hippopotamus, crocodile, lion, cat, dog, dog-headed ape, wolf, jackal, hare, ichneumon, hawk, vulture, ibis, swallow, dove, heron, serpent, frog, beetle, grasshopper, mantis, scorpion, shrewmouse, and various kinds of fish. How many of these are found amongst the rock pictures ? Only the cattle, which may have been regarded differently by the C. Group people, and the dog, which, on the rocks, looks more like a caricature than an object of veneration. Now take the animals that are depicted on the rocks, the elephant, giraffe, ostrich and antelope. None of these seems ever to ha,ve been sacred except that the gazelle, as a destroyer of crops, was regarded, like the wild ass and the pig, as a noxious Set-animal. Does this tempt us to think that the rock artists had such a dread of magic that sacred animals were taboo, and that they drew only Set-animals or animals outside the cults and ceremonies ?</page><page sequence="39">Sudan Notes and Records.

It seems to me that magic, like Bushman or Eastern Spanish affinities, or like beauty, is largely " in the eye of the beholder." If we all look into the same fire we do not all see the same pictures. 3A</page></plain_text>
