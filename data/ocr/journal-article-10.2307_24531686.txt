Shimkin, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N. J. This paper sketches the main forms of unwritten literature among the Wind River Shoshone of Wyoming: the myth (in its two forms of heroic novelette and incidental story or personality sketch), the anecdote, the poetic song, the public prayer, minor invocations, and the jokes of daily life. These materials illustrate the inherent and distinctive artistry, the breadth of indi vidual variability, and the depth of emo tional expressiveness which may exist among a simple folk. My illustrations are limited by a paucity of materials and warped by incomplete knowledge of the language. They can but hint at the full richness and vitality of Shoshonean tradi tions, both at Wind River and elsewhere. Other subsidiary goals exist within the framework of this essay. One is the typo logical delineation of the principal Shoshone literary forms in regard to structure, con tent, and style.2 Another is the characteri zation of the relations between mythology and the rest of culture: the social setting and social functions of storytelling, the nature and variations of attitudes toward mythology, and the reflections of archaic and modern culture in the myth. A third is the indication of interactions between narrators and the tales they tell; how each narrator tends to pattern myth-stuff ac cording to his mood, and how, in doing so, he reveals much of his basic personality.3 1 Received May 5, 1947. 2 Taylor has indicated the need for such types of study. (Cf. A. Taylor: Some trends and prob lems in studies of the folk-tale, Studies in Philology 37: 1-25. 1940; p. 18). 3 Technically, this is the "projective" tech nique of modern clinical psychology. Helpful ref erences in regard to this method are H. Rors chach: Psychodiagnostik, Bern, 1921 (1st ed.); H. Prinzhorn: Bildnerei der Geisteskranken, Berlin, 1923; H. A. Murray: Explorations in personality, Cambridge, 1938. MYTH AND CULTURE The relations between myth and culture among the Shoshone are varied and com plex. Partly, they are functions of the set ting in which the tales are told, and of the purposes—magical, pedagogical, and psy chological—which impel narration. To some degree, they result from the infiltration of mythological concepts into the fields of philosophy and religion, and the ensuing interaction. Finally they reflect the impacts of constant cultural change upon habits of thought, impacts that have yielded quaint anachronisms and conscious archaisms among these people. On cold winter nights, old people, us ually men, tell tales for the edification of young and old. Although good storytellers are generally well known and in demand, no private rights to particular stories exist, nor is there any special etiquette involving audience and narrator4 or calling for a round robin of tales.5 The only requirement is that a tale, once started, must be told to completion. My informant, Tassitsie, told me: My father, Coyote's Tail, used to tell stories. In those days, two or three young fellows would come to bis tipi in the evening, in winter, give him a smoke, and ask him to tell tales. This was not for amusement but for instruction. The myths relate happenings in the days when animals and birds were people. They did various things. In time, one of the animals became old, and started telling stories; he died, another started. It is in this manner that narrators have descended. 4 As among the Crow. Polly Shoyo, who had visited that tribe, mentioned, however, that audiences were required to say "Yes" every so often to indicate that they were awake. Other informants denied this. (See R. H. Lowie: The Crow Indians, New York, 1935.) 5 G. W. Jones: Fox texts. Publ. Amer. Ethnol.

Their bodies were cloaked in a hide with the hair on it: that of a two-year buffalo, tail and all. Around their feet were wrappings to make them large. They held nothing in their hands.
