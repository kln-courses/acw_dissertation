<plain_text><page sequence="1">Water and Power in Modern France* Peter Soppelsa University of Oklahoma Chandra Mukerji, Impossible Engineering: Technology and Territoriality on the Canal du Midi (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009). Sara Prit chard, Confluence: The Nature of Technology and the Remaking of the Rhône (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2011). Two recent studies of French waterways—sociologist Chandra Mukerji's Impos sible Engineering and historian Sara Pritchard's Confluence—tell stories of humans modifying nature and nature pushing back. For these authors, because water is both socially constructed and an independent actor in human history, it can either buoy or sink the power of states and nations. Both authors build innovative interdisciplinary methods with techniques from environmental studies, science and technology studies, the sociology of knowledge, and geography. These methods, which Mukerji calls "posthuman ist" and Pritchard calls "envirotechnical," are based on a concept that theorists like Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway have called "nature-culture" or "naturecultures," while environmental historians and geographers speak of "hybrids" of nature and culture.1 Mukerji and Pritchard bring these hybrids to bear on central questions in the cultural and political history of modern France. This essay situates these books with respect to the emerging interdiscipli nary field of water history in order to reflect on what French history and water history can offer one another. In the decade since the International Water His tory Association (IWHA) was founded (2001), the wave of new research looks like a ten-year flood. Recent landmarks include several significant edited vol umes in the global environmental history of water between 2006 and 2010, and the 2009 launch of the journal Water History.2 The intervening years have also seen significant work on water among historians of technology, a schol arly community in which Mukerji and Pritchard play prominent roles.

Medical historian David Barnes has deftly re-contextualized debates between environmental (miasma) theorists of disease and Pasteurian germ theorists within Paris's nagging (and stinking) nineteenth-century crisis of wastewater management. Margaret Cohen analyzed how Haussmannization helped physically and symbolically erase waterways like the Canal Saint-Martin and the Bièvre from Paris's urban landscape. Jeffrey Jackson's Paris Under Water combines an elegant narrative microhistory of the dramatic 1910 flood with reflection on how human com munities cope with, respond to, survive, and recover from, natural disasters.7 These new works by Mukerji and Pritchard herald a more self-assured French water history, looking beyond Paris and bubbling over with method ological and theoretical insights. Chief among them: a distinctly Latourian combination of soft social constructivism and soft environmental determin ism. They seek to preserve some trace of nature's objectivity, if only in the last instance, in order to explain its historical agency—its unpredictability, its independence from human action, and its power to undo human artifice and infrastructure. They attempt this in a robustly non-reductionist way, which privileges neither nature nor culture, neither the material nor the symbolic. This approach contrasts sharply with the traditions of both French environ mental history, whose stories of environmental modification and cultivated landscapes tend to foreground human agency, and American environmental history, which long clung to concepts of wilderness, objectivity, and the force of nature.8 Mukerji and Pritchard offer lessons about state and nation formation, France's neoclassical heritage, the nature of public works, the constant entan glement of ecology and culture, and the historical agency, autonomy, and power of nonhumans. Most significantly, they offer a thorough materialist analysis of power and related concepts like resistance and centralization. State formation and nation formation, they contend, depend as much on the mate rial construction of landscapes as on the symbolic construction of communi ties. Centralization is ironically tied to distributed sites of expertise and legitimacy. Power and resistance spring from both human and nonhuman agency. These contentions add to analyses of state territorial power commonly</page><page sequence="3">Water and Power in Modern France 119 associated with James Scott's 1998 landmark Seeing Like a State, referenced by both authors. Mukerji's story of the Canal du Midi's construction between 1667 and 1681 is simultaneously a genealogy of absolutism. She argues that the canal's unexpected success helped add a new dimension to French politics. Previously built around patronage, the "personal rule" of kings and nobles, the state grad ually modernized under Louis XIV and Colbert through new forms of "imper sonal rule." Personal rule or patronage politics worked by exchanging favors and information, what she calls "strategics," the power of words over people. Impersonal rule or stewardship politics took the form of environmental inter vention into a territory, which she calls "logistics," the power of works over things. Colbert's term in office saw a range of efforts at environmental knowl edge and engineering: the early 1660s forest surveys, the Royal Academy of Sciences (1666), Royal Observatory (1667), expansion of the Botanical Garden, and the 1669 edict regulating water and forests (28). The combination of per sonal and impersonal rule, she argues, created the novel form of power called absolutism (26-27, 203-204). By connecting the Atlantic and the Mediterranean the canal offered sev eral practical advantages. First, it could facilitate French shipping and com merce by shortening trips from west-coast ports like Bordeaux and Nantes to the Mediterranean. By avoiding the Atlantic and Gibraltar, it could reduce time in rough waters, as well as maritime liabilities like tolls, piracy, and fric tion with English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch neighbors. Second, it plunged Versailles's tentacles deeper into far corners of France, helping inte grate national territory by reining in Languedoc, a wealthy, independent, and sometimes rebellious province (4, 8). Mukerji's story follows Pierre-Paul Riquet, a Languedoc tax farmer who managed the canal project until his death in 1680, one year before its com pletion. Riquet is the fulcrum of Mukerji's important contributions to the soci ology of knowledge and of work, anchoring the title concept of "impossible engineering." She explains that the canal began as an administrative "dream" (16). Initial surveys and studies by state geographers, engineers, and other experts deemed the project well beyond current hydrological and engineering knowledge. The canal's eventual success was therefore unlikely, even "uncanny" (1-2, 9, 13, 183, 192, 200). Contemporaries greeted the finished canal—among the longest and most technically advanced of its era—as magi cal and mysterious. Riquet solved this shortage of centralized natural and technical knowl edge through regional recruitment. He enrolled local actors to pool their own vernacular, sometimes tacit, knowledge to form a collaborative, collective praxis, for which Mukerji borrows the term "distributed cognition" (8-14, esp. 10). Fishermen, peasant women, salt makers, engineers, mathematicians, geo graphers, and so on—these diverse actors brought unique competence and expertise to the project. They carried contextual knowledge of water born of</page><page sequence="4">120 Peter Soppelsa their varied experiences with practices of construction, fortification, fishing, irrigation, laundry, and surveying. These experiences were rooted in various geographies where water behaved differently—from the Pyrenees to Mediter ranean coastal marshes and everywhere in between. An equally important reason for the canal's daunting "impossibility" was the independent force of nature—water's weight and buoyancy, rock's brute passivity, the slippage of sand, and the build-up of silt. In order to make the canal cross dry valleys and a continental divide, Riquet's diverse collective had to work both with and against nature. Hence, following Michel Serres, Mukerji calls her tale a "posthumanist" one (204, 217-19), in which humans are a part of nature, not distinct from it. She taps the idea of "nonhuman actants" flow ing from Latour and Callon's Actor Network Theory—agents that can be enrolled and steered, but never fully mastered, never fixed, and always fully contingent. There is no clearer example than the fugitive fluidity of water, eternally overflowing its bounds, a classic metaphor for becoming, change, flux, and time. Water's perpetual potential energy ensures that it can quickly slip through human fingers or walls with one crack or tremor.9 The added force of sand, soil, wind, and wood only strengthens Mukerji's contention that posthuman ontology can help illuminate such ambitious schemes for dominating nature. This helps explain why massive public works and envi ronmental engineering projects often teeter on the brink of durability and dis aster. Such projects entail routine risks, and challenge efforts at legibility and calculability, due to the unpredictability of nature. The question was, to use an instructive pun, would the canal "hold water"? True to Actor Network Theory, Mukerji pours the canal's natural impos sibility and its social impossibility into the same analytic vessel. While soil and water "evaded" the control of canal builders (204), "[tjhe waterway eluded easy understanding" (220). This double natural-and-social impossibil ity explains the political risks and payoffs of impersonal rule. The canal was as "impossible to erase" as it was "impossible to control" (208); it embodied both weakness and strength, ignorance and genius, delicacy and durability; it paradoxically reflected both humanity's mastery of nature and nature's ulti mate superiority over humanity. Nature could thus both convey and undo state power, by supporting or contradicting claims to legitimacy, knowledge, and stewardship. Had the project failed, it would have made Riquet, Colbert, and Louis look like bad stewards of their territory, compromising their power. But when the project succeeded, it conveyed even more legitimacy, honor, and grandeur. Achieving what had been socially constructed as impossible seemed magical and uncanny. Propagandists claimed the monumental undertaking for King Louis; Riquet explained it as God's work; a few incredulous contemporaries saw it as the Devil's (xix). The canal became the object of long-standing polit ical mythologizing, which credited Louis, Colbert, Riquet, the absolutist state, even France itself, with genius, grandeur, legitimacy, and power. Epistemolog</page><page sequence="5">Water and Power in Modern France 121 ical and political work ran together, as political legitimacy depended on the credibility of the collective forms of natural knowledge and material work behind the canal. Nature and culture, knowledge and practice, words and works all had to be coordinated—and once they were, they conveyed a new kind of power, much more "absolute," "technocratic" (xiii, 7, 231), and "impersonal" than previous patronage politics. This new power was "deper sonalized" (7, 223-24), "territorialized" (see Chapter 2, 15-35) and thereby gradually modernized. One of the most fascinating and controversial parts of Mukerji's argument is her claim that crucial peasant construction techniques—including struc tural arches and the use of hydraulic cement made with volcanic ash—were inheritances from Roman engineering that became "indigenized" (153) over centuries as they slid from theory to practice, from codified to customary. "Classical knowledge was passed unknowingly," she writes, "transmitted through practice" (121). Mountain peasants, especially women who tradition ally handled irrigation and laundry in the Pyrenees, became idiot savants, so to speak, who taught long-lost Roman water-control techniques to state engi neers struggling to make Louis's kingdom a "New Rome." Here the long-stand ing neoclassical orientation of French intellectual and political cultures met in unexpected ways with some surprisingly durable Roman residues and rou tines. So perhaps the King and his court were also idiot savants, not realizing how appropriate their imagery of a "New Rome" was. Because this neoclassi cal orientation is both familiar and hegemonic in French history from Charle magne to Napoleon and beyond, several previous reviewers of the book have questioned Mukerji's claim, asking to what extent, and with what conse quences, we could call seventeenth-century Pyrenees peasants or Versailles absolutists "Romans."10 Still, even these critics agree that such neoclassical discourse served to negotiate French national identity and its Roman heritage. Although it might seem difficult to bridge the historical ravine between Mukerji's story and Sara Pritchard's account of postwar hydroelectric and nuclear development along the French Rhône, their theoretical concerns run together quite smoothly. Like Mukerji, Pritchard offers a simultaneous analy sis of water engineering and politics with reference to James Scott and Actor Network Theory, along with a similarly rich feel for geography and ecology. The neoclassical refrains of national mythmaking are present here as well. Her account of the Rhone's remaking after 1945 is both a bid to define "envi rotechnical" analysis and a story of France's postwar reconstruction amid the triple stresses of the Cold War, decolonization, and European integration. But unlike Mukerji, who saves theoretical reflection for her conclusion, and discusses methodology in an open-ended rather than programmatic way, Pritchard begins with a thorough and lucid attempt to explicate and package envirotechnical analysis as a portable toolkit. During the same decade that French environmental history and water history have consolidated them selves as research fields, "envirotech" was becoming a recognized subfield in</page><page sequence="6">122 Peter Soppelsa the history of technology and environmental history. Pritchard was a found ing member of the Envirotech special interest group within the Society for the History of Technology and the American Society for Environmental His tory in 1999. So it is fitting that hers is the most in-depth attempt yet to define envirotechnical analysis.11 As a historian of postwar French technology and ecology, Pritchard draws major inspiration from Gabrielle Hecht and Michael Bess.12 For her the goal of envirotechnical analysis is to "treat both nature and technology critically without resorting to the determinism, reductionism, or realism of early work" in technological and environmental history (14). This means thinking of both nature and technology as socially constructed, while remembering that nature is not only constructed because it also "presents con straints to both technological and historical possibilities" (17). For her tech nology is the interface between humans and nature; technologies are both "artifacts" produced by human-nature relations and "mediators" steering human-nature relations (13). Hence her core theoretical contribution builds on that familiar intersection of soft social constructivism and soft environ mental determinism. Like Mukerji, she promotes water engineering as a useful site for investigating hybrids of nature and culture. Pritchard coins two key conceptual terms. The first is "envirotechnical systems," complex assemblages of "artifacts, practices, people, institutions, and ecologies" (19). The second is "envirotechnical regimes," sets of pre scriptive practices that "justify, build, and maintain a particular envirotech nical system as normative" (23). The former term plots the field in which hybrids of nature and technology are produced, while the latter explains their consistent entanglement with power. The consequence of these concepts is clear: the "separation or conflation of 'nature' and 'technology'" is always political and strategic (23). Environmental interventions can be legitimized in two conflicting ways. Naturalizing them serves to objectivize and depoliticize them, by conflating nature and technology or reducing technology to nature. Separating nature and technology, by contrast, can legitimize environmental interventions by construing them as human technological mastery of nature. Either way, the nature-technology relationship is being modulated or denied for political purposes. Beginning where Mukerji's narrative ends, Pritchard opens with a broad survey of French water management and state power from the 1600s to the 1940s. From the Old Regime through the mid-1800s, water engineering helped centralize state power in its monarchic, imperial, and republican forms (29-34). Government focus on the Rhône expanded following the devastating floods of 1840 and 1856, which inspired Napoleon Ill's efforts at controlling nature.13 In 1878 the young Third Republic declared the lower Rhône, from Lyon to the Mediterranean, a "public utility," granting the state control of river development (35-36). Starting in the 1890s, a norm of "multipurpose development" was consolidated, which enlisted the Rhône for: (i) irrigation</page><page sequence="7">Water and Power in Modem France 123 and agriculture, (ii) power generation and industry, and (iii) navigation and commerce (36-45). Pritchard argues that these three basic uses guided the waterway's remaking through the late twentieth century. The bulk of her narrative begins in the interwar period, with the 1921 cre ation of the CNR (Compagnie nationale du Rhône), a public-private agency charged with overseeing the Rhone's multipurpose development. The CNR is Pritchard's Riquet. The agency was initially composed of four sets of stakes- or shareholders: Paris and the Seine department, local and regional political bod ies, the PLM railway company, and industrial interests like electrical compa nies and nuclear agencies (46). This complex public-private formation ensured that the CNR never spoke with one voice, but rather continued a long French administration tradition that Pritchard calls "fragmented centralization" (33). Throughout her story, the CNR wages a many-sided struggle with both exter nal forces (whether social, political, or natural) and internal divisions—even after being largely nationalized along with the railways and electrical indus tries in 1946 (52-54). The overall flow of her story leads toward increasing cen tralization, which, however, was always contested and never complete. Pritchard joins scholars like Gabrielle Hecht, Kristin Ross, and Rosemary Wakeman in arguing that the practical, political-economic demands of post war reconstruction were always entangled in the symbolic work of remaking French national identity (Chapter 2, 55-77).14 One of the CNR's first missions was securing France's energy independence, first through hydroelectric, and later nuclear, development. Such practical infrastructure was simultaneously a "spectacle that ... enacted national redemption, renewal, and regeneration" (57). Thus CNR projects like the massive Donzère-Mondragon hydroelectric installation built between 1952 and 1956 were both the "means" of postwar reconstruction and its "symbols" (73). Constructions of nature were as essential here as constructions of tech nology. By imagining the river as wild beast (bull) to be tamed or civilized, politicians, engineers, and journalists cast the Rhone's development as part of France's civilizing mission and national grandeur (59-60). Neoclassical imagery of the Rhône as a pagan god and references to Roman Gaul flowed freely. This dominant image of a struggle against nature was countered by CNR attempts to "naturalize" the Rhone's technological remaking. In this view, actors like the CNR and EDF merely tapped the river's ancient and inher ent flows of energy (63-66). Whether technology and nature were contrasted or ran together, their intersection at the Rhône could be mobilized to support the radiance of France. Technology and nature were co-constructed, as were technology and culture—and both in the service of reforming national iden tity and state power (77). Chapter three—the book's central, longest, and most technical (78-131)— explains how the Rhone's multiple uses both depended on and conflicted with one another. The chapter revolves around the CNR's technique of diversion— creating a new channel parallel to the river, steering a controlled quantity of</page><page sequence="8">124 Peter Soppelsa water into it for irrigation, hydroelectric generation, or cooling a nuclear plant, and finally draining it back into the river downstream. The crucial envirotechnical problem here was whether enough water could be captured to be useful without compromising the independent flow (or "reserved flow," 96)—of the existing river, navigability across the diversion area, or water sup ply downstream. Using diversions to structure the Rhone's multi-use develop ment thus required balancing water's multiple uses. Because the resulting systems were envirotechnical, technological ambi tions had to be balanced with natural limits. CNR engineers conducted detailed studies of Rhône hydrology, which brought controversial debates over measurements and methods—exactly how much water could be diverted? How could the Rhone's average or normal flow be calculated? Engineers strug gled with the Rhone's essential variability: from 560 to 9,500 cubic meters per second (92-93). In the end, the CNR managed to "reverse" the river's natural and technological aspects by steering more than 90 percent of original flow into the diversion channel, relegating the original riverbed to the "former Rhône" or "dead Rhône." The CNR killed the "natural" Rhône by giving birth to a new cyborg waterway: "a rationalized, industrialized, and simplified Rhône" (100). Such inherently difficult questions of water flow and nature-or-technol ogy only grew more complicated as the postwar era wore on thanks to France's increasing reliance on nuclear power, especially after 1974's "all nuclear" pol icy. Three major nuclear facilities were built along Donzère-Mondragon's diversion canal between the 1950s and 1970s. Soon the EDF and CEA were vying for access to the Rhône. For cooling nuclear reactors, they preferred the CNR's diversion canal to the original riverbed for its steady, regulated flow of water. Envirotechnical schemes thus "nested" (187, 192) or stacked as nuclear projects built on existing hydroelectric projects, raising complex questions about where nuclear plants could draw and dump water. This caused conflict between various agencies and their envirotechnical regimes. CNR means and motives did not always agree with those of the CEA and EDF. CNR hydroelectric plants had minimum water needs, and less impact on the temperature and chemistry of the water they used. By contrast, CEA and EDF nuclear plants were increasingly thirsty, and released wastewater that was significantly warmer and sometimes modified by chemicals or radiation. The CNR had to secure adequate water supplies for their hydroelectric plants, while maintaining groundwater quality, flood prevention, and irrigation, and balancing growing demand from the CEA and EDF (100-109). These conflicts between envirotechnical regimes flared up most at moments of high or low water; when nature exerted more force, social and institutional conflict fol lowed (110). This pattern illustrates Pritchard's claim that natural forces are unpredictable and independent components in envirotechnical systems. Hydroelectric and nuclear technologies thus "reworked and altered" the Rhône as much as they "depended on" it (130). For Prit chard as for Mukerji,</page><page sequence="9">Water and Power in Modem France 125 nature acts on, with, for, and against human schemes for environmental engi neering; its agency flows with and against currents in social, political, and technological history. Chapter four adds another layer to Pritchard's complex tale of conflicts among communities, institutions, and ecologies. From the first CNR con struction in the 1940s, locals along the lower Rhône noticed groundwater shortages in some areas and soggy, flooded fields in others. Local groups soon organized to demand greater groundwater and flood protection, and the CNR "found itself in a quagmire of environmental change, competing knowledge claims, and the problem of uncertainty" (133). Faced with this multifaceted natural, technological, and social pressure, the CNR made a number of con flicting claims about who or what should be blamed for environmental changes. Sometimes the CNR accepted responsibility, other times it natural ized environmental problems to diffuse responsibility (140-62). This waffling over responsibility clearly illustrates Pritchard's central claim that separating nature and technology is always strategic and political. Chapter five situates the Rhône within regional development schemes, which aimed to restabilize France's shifting geopolitical position amid decolo nization and European integration in the 1960s and 1970s. Struggling with decolonization, France transferred its imperial projects of aménagement and mise en valeur (174) to France's southeast in the form of regional development projects, turning the Rhône delta into Marseilles's hinterland and the entire region into a new internal colony for Paris. Regional development thus replaced France's slipping grip on its overseas colonies with redoubled efforts at stabilizing the nation's peripheral regions; internal colonialism stood in for France's lost external empire. Particularly important in developing the south east was steering rapid urbanization created by former colonies "coming home" in the form of repatriated pieds-noirs and postcolonial immigrants. This chapter showcases Pritchard's use of geographic scale as an analytic tool by shifting from local to regional to national and global, while she shows how envirotechnical analysis could contribute to colonial and post-colonial stud ies. Chapters six and seven examine two cancelled CNR projects in the 1980s and 1990s to reflect on the power of environmentalism in greening French politics and moderating envirotechnical ambitions. But even amid this recent deceleration of CNR work, the path-dependence of its history remains clear. The Rhône had already been so modified by the 1980s that any efforts to con serve or preserve it would lead to a different hybrid, envirotechnical waterway rather than some pristine original nature. French landscapes and environ mental policies have remained "light-green," always combining care for nature with the stubborn human transformation of the environment. These two studies—one of an artificial waterway constructed in the 1600s, the other of an independently existing waterway heavily modified by human intervention after 1945—have remarkably similar consequences. Although Pritchard speaks of "envirotech" and Mukerji of the "posthuman," their theo</page><page sequence="10">126 Peter Soppelsa retical and methodological contributions are quite compatible, even overlap ping, and flowing with the currents of the young field of water history. As the editors of Water History put it, their field studies "the nexus between" or "intrinsic proximity" of "natural and human worlds." Hence, water history is necessarily interdisciplinary, demanding both attention to water's physical (chemical, geological, geographical, and ecological) "nature" and the human (social, cultural, political) contexts in which water is employed.15 Meanwhile Terje Tvedte et al. argue that water "is nature and a social factor at the same time and in the same form," so that "by its very exis tence it refutes the dominant, rigid and dichotomic distinction between soci ety and nature."16 Water therefore demands a multi-level analysis via: (i) its physical properties, (ii) human modification of water landscapes, and (iii) institutions (politics) and ideas (culture) of water. All this, they argue, follows closely on Bruno Latour's view of history as produced by both human and nonhuman actors.17 The broader global-comparative and longue durée orientation of water his tory shows that France is by no means alone in its so-called politique de l'eau. Because water is universal—a critical resource for all humans across space and time—its control and management have been a basic part of governance since at least Hammurabi. There is no state without water management; water and power belong together. In addition, because water sustains life, water history points to an environmental history of biopower. State efforts to maintain a vital population necessarily require the management of basic resources like food, fuel, and water. As geographer Erik Swyngedouw pithily puts it, flows of water are "flows of power."18 Contextualizing the works of Mukerji and Pritchard in this broader field of water history helps show how their new methodological vocabularies are applicable well beyond hydrology and the hexagon. Their interest in using water to enrich the study of state and nation formation is widely shared by others in water history, while other historians of technology share their inter est in the material and environmental aspects of power. More specifically, Mukerji and Pritchard offer a robust rethinking of concepts of power and resis tance. If power requires both controlling people and controlling things, then resistance to power can come not only from social actors (i.e., contestation), but also from the active or passive powers of technology, nature, and other nonhuman actors. Similarly, Daniel Headrick's recent global survey of tech nology and environments in Western imperialism starts from the observation that natural forces have been both aids and obstacles to imperial power.19 Mukerji and Pritchard also contribute to long-standing debates about cen tralization in France. Pritchard's story of the high modernist state strongly contrasts with Mukerji's story of its early modern origins, because while Riquet required local knowledge and skill to make his projects work, CNR projects often proceeded without even consulting locals (Pritchard, 116). And yet, both books document provincial resistance to Paris and its envirotechnical projects.</page><page sequence="11">Water and Power in Modem France 127 Moreover, Mukerji's "distributed cognition" and Pritchard's "fragmented cen tralization" point to a similar irony in centralized power: it depends on coor dinated networks of local and regional power. If local nodes had no power—whether knowledge, expertise, legitimacy, or human and natural resources—tying them together in a network (or "knot" to use Latour and Mukerji's term) would confer no power on the network's hub, the state. Cen tralization always pulls against this decentralization, necessitating a delicate balance between co-optation and collaboration, concentration and diffusion. Center-periphery conflicts concern not only sovereignty and representation, but also territory and resources. As francophone studies continues to globalize under the influence of global history, Atlantic studies, and post/colonial studies, envirotechnical or posthuman analysis could also revivify work on the French Atlantic, the French Pacific, and the Mediterranean. David Biggs, for example, has argued that American nation-building in Vietnam was "modified and subverted" by French colonial heritage in institutions, planning, and technology, Viet namese resistance, and finally the unpredictable non-human agency of land and water in the Mekong Delta. This sank American and Vietnamese authori ties into a literal and figurative "quagmire."20 Other analyses of French colo nial Asia, from Matt Matsuda's expansive survey of the Pacific to Eric Jennings's rich microhistory of Dalat, would have differed significantly if they evoked nature as more than a black-box and backdrop. Environmental notions like altitude, heat, and humidity play some role in these studies, but nature's agency is never foregrounded or interrogated.21 French colonial power was envirotechnical from the start; the mise en valeur was deeply tied to land-use, resource extraction, agriculture, forestry, and so on. A Ponts et Chaussées engi neer in 1860s Senegal revealed this when he said, "the lack of water is one of the principal obstacles to the extension of our domination."22 Other directions for further research include animal studies and disaster studies. Work in animal studies might take cues from Richard White, Michel Callon and others in studying aquatic life from microorganisms to plants, amphibians, and fish. These nonhuman characters are notably absent from Mukerji's narrative and only briefly mentioned in Pritchard's, in spite of both authors' familiarity with White's salmon and Callon's scallops.23 Studies of animate nonhumans could add an important dimension to Mukerji and Pritchard's project of rethinking historical agency. Animal agency is arguably more active and overt than that of water, wind, and wood, which act on the human world through passive resistance born of physical properties like solidity, flammability, or fluidity. Like water history, recent work in animal studies pushes the boundaries of environmental history by constructing interdisciplinary methods to interrogate the nature-culture binary and rethink the concept of agency.24 Plants can be as instructive as animals; the human engagement with wood is as old as that with water. Hence forest history has been another</page><page sequence="12">128 Peter Soppelsa important site in recent French environmental studies of both plantation and deforestation.25 Samuel Temple, for example, goes beyond showing that some French forests are constructed, human-made landscapes. He argues that nat ural forces like forest fire, flooding, climate change, and pest infestation can both be unleashed by human activity and act independently and unpre dictably on the human world. Temple shows that state-sponsored monocul ture forests continually evade human control in spite of their human-made status, presenting risk and uncertainty with consequences for economic sta bility and environmental justice. This connects his work in significant ways with recent disaster studies of Paris by scholars like Jeffrey Jackson, Richard Keller, and myself. The question of whether any individual catastrophic event is "natural," "social" or "tech nological" may be crucial in adjudicating lawsuits and insurance claims, but scholars like Pritchard, Mukerji, Temple, and myself suggest that this is largely moot analytically. For disaster studies, this signals the possibility of seeing dis asters as envirotechnical, hybrid, or posthuman events, set off by the inde pendent force of nature, human modification of nature, or the complex interplay between the two. Most large catastrophic events—from Paris in win ter 1910 or summer 2003 to Katrina and Fukushima—have both causes and effects that are social-technical-natural.26 As Pritchard convincingly argues, those who would evade responsibility for such events have the most incentive to depoliticize and naturalize them, casting them as "acts of God." Reducing a complex, hybrid disaster to a "natural" one is essentially strategic, saturated with politics. Likewise, reducing supposedly natural disasters to "social" ones is also tactical, but usually in opposing, critical-political ways.27 As this brief discussion of animal studies and disaster studies shows, the consequences of Mukerji's and Prit chard's works are potentially expansive. We can conclude by considering the politics of nature-culture hybrids in the recent case of José Bové, whose activism concerns McDonalds, Monsanto, mad cow disease, and milk. His cultural claims about French cuisine, environmen tal claims about agriculture, health claims about hormones and GMOs, and political claims about mass media and globalization have been necessarily entangled. His story adds another chapter to Mukerji's and Pritchard's tales of rebellious rural regions resisting Paris's expanding power across the modern era. It also suggests how nature-culture hybrids could be useful for studying agriculture, food, and medicine. Bové's battles to protect fertile soil, regional culture, and people's power reveal as much about the power of corporations as they do about state power. This has important echoes in several recent works about "water wars," struggles over water rights and resources between local communities, large corporations, and various levels of government from municipal to transnational.28 Amid the flood of recent work in water history, Mukerji and Pritchard unleash a cascade of potentially useful methodological consequences. As other scholars work to apply their hybrid forms of analysis to new nature-cultures</page><page sequence="13">Water and Power in Modem France 129 and nonhuman agents such as animals and plants, food and drugs, they will encounter new objects of study like agriculture, medicine, corporate power, and conflicts over fresh water and wastewater. In so doing, further study will continue to map fertile floodplains of inquiry into the nature of power. Peter Soppelsa is an Assistant Professor in the History of Science Department and Managing Editor of Technology and Culture at the University of Oklahoma. His research examines conflicts over infrastructure in Paris after Haussmann as responses to the complexity and fragility of networked systems that are social-technological-ecological in character. His work has appeared in Tech nology and Culture, History and Technology, French Historical Studies, and several edited volumes.
